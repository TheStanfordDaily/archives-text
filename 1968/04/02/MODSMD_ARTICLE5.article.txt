## Kennedy To Meet With LBJ 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — A sol
emn Sen. Robert F. Kennedy
said Monday he has asked Presi
dent Johnson for an early meet
ing to discuss "how we might
work together in the interest of
national unity."
Kennedy became a likely
front-runner for his party's
presidential nomination when
Johnson stunned the world Sun
day night by announcing he will
not seek renomination.
President Johnson said he will
"surely" honor Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy's request at a time
"convenient for him."
Johnson made this statement
in response to questions put to
him by a group of reporters as
he flew back to the capital from
a speaking engagement in Chi
cago.
Two weeks ago Kennedy op
ened what was then his chal
lenge to Johnson by charging
the President with responsibility
for disunity and divisiveness in
the United States.
But the tone was different
Monday as Kennedy told a
crowded news conference and a
nationwide radio-television audi
ence:
"The President's action re
flects both courage and generosi
ty of spirit."
• U.S. Hits DMZ Area
SAIGON (AP)—U.S. planes
pounded the southern panhandle
of North Vietnam Monday, pos
sibly a prelude to intensified at
tacks on enemy supply lines now
that most of the North is off
limits to air blows.
President Johnson's order to
end the bombing of most of
North Vietnam, including the

heartland around Hanoi, the
capital, and the chief port of
Haiphong, could mean harder
blows at supply lines.
But he permitted air raids in
the southern panhandle of the
North around the demilitarized
zone.
Informed sources said most of
the day's strikes were aimed at
truck convoys, storage areas
and weapons positions in the
Dong Hoi area about 50 miles
north of the demilitarized zone
between North and South Viet
nam.
The sharp curtailment of
bombing in the North meant
that Air Force planes and Navy
fighter-bombers from carriers in
the Gulf of Tonkin can strike
heavier blows around the demili
tarized zone and the Ho Chi
Minh trail route of supply
through Laos.

MILWAUKEE, Wis. (AP) —
Wisconsin citizens log the first
voter reaction to President

votes toward the Democratic
nomination.
The extent of a vote of confi

plans to retire next year could
affect not only McCarthy's
standing but the fortunes of
former Vice Porsident Richard

• Reserve Call-Up Due
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
administration plans to tap as
many as 60,000 reservists to
back the Vietnam war effort and
bolster the readiness of uncom

the home front.
Defense officials disclosed the
planned moves Monday while
cautioning that the exact size of
the reserve mobilization could
vary up or down depending on
Pentagon studies now under
way.
The first impact will come
Wednesday when the Pentagon
is due to order up perhaps 15,-

Several thousand are needed
in Vietnam to provide support
for combat units which were
rushed to South Vietnam in Feb

In addition, Gen. William C.
Westmoreland has asked that
one of the units which was
flown to Vietnam during the
emergency buildup — the 27th

troops. A few thousand new
troops—some regular, some re

• Stock Market Soars
NEW YORK (AP) — A 39-
year record for volume toppled
Monday as the stock market
made a huge gain in turbulent
trading following President
Johnson's surprise announce

North Vietnam and his decision
not to seek reelection.
Turnover on the New York
Stock Exchange soared to 17.73
million shares smashing the
previous record of 16.41 million
shares made on the "Black
Tuesday" of Oct. 29, 1929.
The Dow Jones industrial av

greatest rise by this average
since another day which was
notably a Johnson day on Wall

after President Kennedy's fu

32.03 then, exceeding the pre

on Oct. 30, 1929, a session ol

Tuesday" and other noteworthy
plunges of the Great Crash.
• Court Applies Vote
Rule To Grassroots
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Supreme Court brought the
"one-man, one-vote" rule home
to grassroots government Mon
day.
Some 80,000 town, city and
county governing bodies were
admonished in a 5-3 decision
that the Constitution "forbids
the election of local government
officials from districts of dis
parate size."
Thus the court made history
by applying the same reading of
the Constitution's equal protec
tion clause to local government
as it did, beginning in 1962, to
state legislatures and U.S.
congressional districts.
That is: Where governing offi
cials are elected by districts the
district lines must be drawn so
that citizens' votes are substan
tially equal in weight.
The ruling came on a case
from Midland County, Tex.,
where the governing Commis
sioners Court is elected under a
four-district system in which
about 95 per cent of the popula
tion — the people of Midland
City — all are in one of the dis
tricts.
• Draft Pleas Fail
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
Tried of approximately 100 draft
evasion cases was given a go
ahead Monday when U.S. Dis
trict Judge Alfonso J. Zirpoli
rejected a mass attack by a
panel of 102 attorneys on the
constitutionality of the Selec
tivity Service Act.
Judge Zirpoli said in a leng
thy memorandum that some of
the issues, such as attacks on
the complexion of grand juries
impaneled at the time of indict
ment, might be raised at indi
vidual trials.
The judge denied motions for
dismissal of test cases on 35
points.
Thursday, at the conclusion of
two days of arguments, the
judge then said that only two
contentions merited further
study.
One was the constitutionality
of draft board regulations and
the other was the handling of
youths conscientiously opposed
to the draft.
Monday he denied these as
earlier he had dismissed argu

ments that the Vietnam war vi
olates international law and
treaties. He also had ruled
against there being a showing of
blanket discrimination in grand
jury selection.

that very much of the country
should probably remain in Viet

Galbraith, former United

spoke to 3,000 persons at Cali
