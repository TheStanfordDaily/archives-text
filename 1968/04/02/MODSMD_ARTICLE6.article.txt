# SES Committee Recommends Greater Minority Recruitment
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
In a sharply critical interim
report released today on Stan
ford's record in minority-group
admissions, the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford (SES) com
mittee on admissions and fi
nancial aids recommends great
ly augmenting recruitment and
Increasing financial support to
expand enrollment of under
privileged students.
The committee, however,
strongly urges that such expan
sion not come at the expense of
quality and academic strength
students accepted, and clearly
rules out a large remedial pro
gram at Stanford to provide
quality after acceptance.
The committee states "Stan
ford's educational role ... is
to seek out and educate the
best young talent in the coun
try." At present, the committee
feels, Stanford fails to do so.
Students "have been, and to a
lesser extent are now, effective
ly denied an opportunity to at
tend Stanford."
Noting that Stanford has
"long been a white, middle and
upper-middle-class university"
with a "non-history" of minor
ity-group student involvement
in higher education, the report
points to recent improvement

so the record "can now be char
acterized as merely bad."
The report, researched and in
itially drafted by Robert N.
Rosenzweig, associate provost,
and John Black, director of the
Counseling and Testing Service,
makes recommendations dealing
with "Recruiting, Admissions
Standards, Financial Aid, and
After Admission."
Taking the example of Ne
gTo student admissions, the
report finds that the first ap
preciable data begins with ap
plication and enrollment fig
ures in 1960. That year there
were six Negro applicants.
The committee feels 1965
marks a "kind of watershed"
when applications and accept
ances doubled from '64. By 1967,
114 Negro students applied, 52
were accepted, and 37 are at
tending.
Overall minority-group enroll
ment in the university this year
totals about 430 students, 148
Negroes and 282 from other
minorities. Of this total, 275
are undergraduates.
The report states, "It is clear
that admission of Negro stu
dents has become more selec
tive, judged by admissions com
pared to applications. We feel
this is largely the result of more
vigorous recruiting efforts."
It appears that in choosing
Negro applicants, the admis
sions department weighs SAT
verbal results more heavily
than math, but in the overall
picture they are judged "es
sentially outside the competi
tion."
"That is to say they, like ath
letes and children of faculty
members, must meet the basic
entrance requirements but they
need npt be more qualified than
all rejected applicants.
Before making recommen
dations, the committee brief

ly examines procedures at
other universities including
Harvard, Cornell, Berkeley,
and Wesleyan. At Harvard
the emphasis is on careful
recruitment and evaluation of
applicants whereas at Berke
ley more attention is directed
to remedial programs for stu
dents who ordinarily wouldn't
be qualified for admission.
The report next describes
some of the committee's obser
vations on the nature of Stan
ford, observations it feels must
guide its admission procedures
for minority-group students.
These fall into four main con
clusions.
Because a large fraction of
faculty effort at Stanford is de

voted to graduate instruction
and research, there are "very
real practical limits on the abil
ity of the faculty to give extra
attention to any group of under
graduates."
Secondly, the faculty here
are accustomed to and want
to teach "the best students
available." The report defines
"best" as "the ability to per
form intellectual manipula
tions." The committee thus
feels the dominant view among
the faculty is that remedial
teaching is not to be part of
its business.
A third characteristic of Stan
ford discussed is the "culture
of the community" which the
committee states, "is not very
supportive of those who have
problems, be they social or aca
demic. The norm is achievement,
competitive achievement."
The report continues, "Under
present conditions, to recruit
to this community students who
can be expected to have extreme
problems of academic or social
adjustment would be cruel, fruit
less, and self-defeating." The
committee, however, hopes this
situation is not beyond change.
The committee concludes
"Our argument is not that un
qualified students should be ad
mitted to Stanford because they
happen ... to be the best pre
pared of their social, economic,
ethnic, or racial group; our
point is that talent exists which
Stanford is missing."
The committe realizes, the re
port states, that any contribu
tion Stanford might make to rec
tify the educational plight of
Negroes would be "more sym
bolic than significant.
"Nevertheless, we think that
special efforts to enroll Negroes
are essential from a moral point
of view. Moreover, the education
of our white students requires
that they have greater oppor
tunity for contact with black
students."
Specific recommendations be
gin with recruiting. The com
mittee calls for more intensive
recruiting, including outside
Calfiornia schools. It also sug
gests that minority-group stu
dents already at Stanford be
involved in recruiting "to pro
vide the bridge between the uni
versity and the cultures that
have long been alien to it."
On admissions standards, the
report indicates the need for
"built-in exceptions for students
from minority groups."
It suggests that reference to
the experiences of such stu
dents already enrolled be a con
sideration in admission guide
lines.
The committee has a simple
prescription' for putting high
priority efforts to raise mon
ey for financial aid: "Find it."
In the shorter run, the com
mittee recommends "that ad
missible minority group stu
-0

dents be accommodated first
from available resources, with
out regard to their 'quality
group' ranking."
The report ends with two
recommendations for "After
Admissions." First, freshman
year pressures should be alle
viated by modifying grading
policies and reducing competi
tion for all students, and sec
ond, a tutorial program should
be established.
The report will now be re
viewed by the Steering Commit
tee of the SES.
