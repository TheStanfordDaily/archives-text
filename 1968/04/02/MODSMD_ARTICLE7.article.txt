# Grad Admissions Policy Unchanged
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Stanford has decided to gam
hie that the number of seniors
and first-year graduate students
drafted this year will be rather
small, and is keeping its gradu
ate admissions policy basically
the same as in the past.
"We have just about the same
policy as last year," said Virgil
K. Whitaker, dean of the gradu
ate division. "We will admit a
few extra students in selected
departments only."
The decision was made de
spite a recent rebuff from Gen.
Lewis B. Hershey, director of
the Selective Service System.
Hershey had turned down a re
quest from representatives of
several higher education asso
ciations early last month asking
that students who registered in
the fall in graduate school be

allowed to continue for the rest
of the academic year without
being drafted.
Despite this, the school is ad
mitting about the same number
of graduate students as it usual
ly does.
The basis for this decision
was stated in a memo from
Whitaker to all department
heads, which said, "We have
concluded, in fact, that national
pressures are developing to the
point that the impact upon pres
ent and prospective graduate
students will be considerably
less than would result from a
rigid application of the present
directives."
Whitaker feels, for example,
that the Department of De
fense might request a prime
age group, despite Selective
Service System resistance to
such a plan. This would mean
less seniors and graduates
would be drafted.
Therefore, the Dean says, "we
are now following the policy on
overaliocation that we used last
year."
Normally this overaliocation,
or admission of more students
than there is room for because
of those who are accepted but
do not attend, is around 40 per
cent.
There have been some slight
increases this year, Whitaker
says, but "in no department
have we gone beyond an addi
tional 20 per cent.
"In other words, we have
been pretty cautious. We
could wind up without a grad
uate school, but we are living
in hop*'."
The additions have come in
the larger departments, ones
where there are usually "a large
number of turndowns," Whi
taker said.
In his memo, Whitaker noted
that some additional financial
assistance offers were also be
ing made.
According to the memo, "the
Graduate Awards office is now
writing to offer financial aid to
a relatively small number of ad
ditional students in those depart
ments that seem most vulner
able."
These departments are in sci
ence and engineering, Whitaker
said.

of the academic year without
being drafted.
Despite this, the school is ad
mitting about the same number
of graduate students as it usual
ly does.
The basis for this decision
was stated in a memo from
Whitaker to all department
heads, which said, "We have
concluded, in fact, that national
pressures are developing to the
point that the impact upon pres
ent and prospective graduate
students will be considerably
less than would result from a
rigid application of the present
directives."
Whitaker feels, for example,
that the Department of De
fense might request a prime
age group, despite Selective
Service System resistance to
such a plan. This would mean
less seniors and graduates
would be drafted.
Therefore, the Dean says, "we
are now following the policy on
overaliocation that we used last
year."
Normally this overaliocation,
or admission of more students
than there is room for because
of those who are accepted but
do not attend, is around 40 per
cent.
There have been some slight
increases this year, Whitaker
says, but "in no department
have we gone beyond an addi
tional 20 per cent.
"In other words, we have
been pretty cautious. We
could wind up without a grad
uate school, but we are living
in hop*'."
The additions have come in
the larger departments, ones
where there are usually "a large
number of turndowns," Whi
taker said.
In his memo, Whitaker noted
that some additional financial
assistance offers were also be
ing made.
According to the memo, "the
Graduate Awards office is now
writing to offer financial aid to
a relatively small number of ad
ditional students in those depart
ments that seem most vulner
able."
These departments are in sci
ence and engineering, Whitaker
said.
Stanford has decided to gam
hie that the number of seniors
and first-year graduate students
drafted this year will be rather
small, and is keeping its gradu
ate admissions policy basically
the same as in the past.
"We have just about the same
policy as last year," said Virgil
K. Whitaker, dean of the gradu
ate division. "We will admit a
few extra students in selected
departments only."
The decision was made de
spite a recent rebuff from Gen.
Lewis B. Hershey, director of
the Selective Service System.
Hershey had turned down a re
quest from representatives of
several higher education asso
ciations early last month asking
that students who registered in
the fall in graduate school be

allowed to continue for the rest
of the academic year without
being drafted.
