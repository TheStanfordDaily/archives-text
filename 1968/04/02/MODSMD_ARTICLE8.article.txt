# Plans For Madrid Group Not Affected By Shutdown
## 
### 
The Spanish government
closed down the violence-torn
University of Madrid Thursday,
but Stanford officials are going
ahead with plans to send 15 un
dergraduates to the University
next fall.
The unrest that led to the
closing of the University of Ma
drid and also of Valencia Uni
versity stemmed reportedly
from a government decision to
give police new powers to enter
university buildings without
permission from the deans.
Another source of unrest was
the presence of American mili
tary bases in Spain. Last week
the American embassy was the
center of several protests, and
two bombs exploded near it. The
agreement establishing the bases
expires in September, and stu
dents wish to pressure the gov
ernment to end the agreement.
Paul Hanley, assistant direc
tor of Stanford's overseas cam
puses, said yesterday. "Th"re is
no change in our plans at the
present time, In each of our
overseas programs we have con
tingency plans to deal with dis-

ruptions of the course of study."
Bernard Gieovate, professor of
Spanish, who is scheduled to
lead the Stanford group next
fall, said preparations for the
program wero going ahead just
as if the University of Madrid
were not closed.
"I expect the university to be
open in October," he said. But
he pointed out that he and his
assistant could carry on class
instruction for the 15 Stanford
students during a strike or if
the university remains closed.
Gieovate said the decision of
whether to carry through the
program would probably be
made in June. Hanley said Rob
ert Walker, director of the Over
seas Campus Program, would
visit Madrid on his trip to over
seas campuses starting near the
end of April.
The 15 Stanford students plan
to enroll in the equivalent of 15
units of Stanford work. Included
in this load will be a daily course
taught by Gicavote and his as
sistant, Maria Carmen Ochoa, a
graduate of the University of
Madrid. (Se<« related story on
