Resist the Draft —
Help End the War
WE CALL UPON ALL MEN AND WOMEN, INELIGIBLE FOR CONSCRIPTION,
TO DECLARE THEIR SUPPORT OF ALL YOUNG MEN WHO ARE OPENLY RESISTING THE DRAFT.
• An ever growing number of young American men are finding that the American War in Vietnam so outrages their deepest moral and religious sense that
they cannot contribute to it in any way.
• We and others throughout the country, like the majority of Americans not among those called upon to offer our lives in Vietnam, share this moral
outrage. We believe that any American is morally and legally justified in working actively to end this war, in avoiding collusion with it, and in
encouraging others to do the same.
• Therefore, we call upon all men of good will to join with us in the statement below, if they believe as we do that we must step forward at this time with
those young men who are openly resisting an unjust military draft serving a disastrous military policy.
