Sometime between World War
II and the demise of Sen. Joseph
McCarthy, a general attitude
that has been described as liberal
anti-communism became the pre
vailing attitude of the American
intellectual community.
The basic premises of liberal
anti-communism were two: that
the Government should be en
couraged to pursue its policy of
containing Communism abroad,
and that it should be prodded to
cure whatever social ills might
still be in existence at home.
At the time liberal anti-Com
munism was blossoming, there
is no doubt that many of its ad
vocates believed they were tak
ing a stand that was both ideal
istic and sensible. Stalin's re
pressive and cynical methods of
ruling seemed to discredit Com
munism as a means of achieving
social progress while the United
States seemed to be taking a
genuinely progressive role in the
world with such programs as
the Marshall Plan.
Whatever the validity of this
view of the world, it permitted
academics and intellectuals to go
to work for the government, or
at least to work on Government
sponsored projects, in good con
science. Criticism, if it was en
couraged at all, was directed at
particular programs or parts of
programs rather than at the for
eign policy or the society's struc
ture as a whole.
Government, under pressure
to keep up with the Soviets in
the missile race, the space race,
and in other races, threw off its
traditional distrust of the intel
lectual community and began
funding research programs at
the universities.

While the amount of money
that has gone out as research
grants to universities is not
small, it is nothing compared to
the indirect subsidies that uni
versities have received in states
where industries were getting
fat on Government contracts. In
California, for example, the
aerospace industries needed en
gineers and scientists, and there
fore provided much of the po
litical pressure that led to the
massive growth of the Univer
sity of California system.
The consequences of the post
war romance between universi
ties and the Government are
what most, though not all, of
the eleven contributors to The
Dissenting Academy talk about.
Although it is clear that the
war in Vietnam is the starting
point for all of them, they do
not write so much about where
academics have failed in trying
to end the war as about the
larger failure of the universities
to criticize a society that would
get into such a war.
Incredible Failings
As described in this book,
some of the failings of academ
ics are almost incredible. Sum
ner Rosen, an economist writing
about the deficiencies of econom
ic work in this country, says
that the Impact of military
spending in the economy has
been all but ignored by profes
sional economists. According to
Rosen, "war and preparation for
war" is the most important sin
gle force in the economy today.
Why, then, has this area been
neglected?
It's hard to avoid the conclu
sion that economists, the group
that has come closest to the in
ner circles of power in this coun
try (what other discipline boasts
anything like the President's
Council of Economic Advisors?),
just plain don't want to point

out how dependent our economy
is on war-spending because it
would spoil their cozy relation
ship with the Government.
Economists, in other words,
accept the structure of the econ
omy, in the large, and address
to limited t°°h
nical aspects of it.
A similar criticism of anthro
pologists is made by Kathleen
Gough. She says that anthropol
ogists in general study primitive
cultures, and sometimes even
examine the impact of Western
society of these cultures, with
out considering the larger ques
tion of Western imperialism, its
origins and overall impact.
Miss Gough, who is on the
faculty at Simon Fraser Uni
versity in Canada (she has also
taught at American institu
tions), suggests that the tradi
tion of concentrating on out-of
the-way cultures has given an
thropologists a means of evad
ing the larger questions, which
in turn has meant that they can
take Government research
grants without qualms about
what their.Government may be
doing to non-Western peoples
around the world.
Few Public Stands
Some of the contributors to
the Dissenting Academy discuss
the role, or non-role of profes
sional associations in their re
spective disciplines with regard
to taking public stands on is
sues.
Louis Kampf, an associate pro
fessor of Humanities at MIT,
says the Modern Language As

sociation is more a "trade asso
ciation" than a professional as
sociation, a group whose "natu
ral drift is toward the councils
of the Chamber of Commerce."
He describes the total lack of
concern with public issues, such
as Vietnam, at a recent MLA
convention as a consequence of
the understanding by its mem
bership that their affluence ulti
mately depends on the Cold
War. "The buffonery at the MLA
convention," writes Kampf, "is
the visible sign of a competitive
spirit, of an acquisitiveness,
which is ready to cut throats;
further, it pictures not only pri
vate feelings, but the structure
of a society which is learning to
exploit its men of learning."
Marshall Windmiller, an asso
ciate professor of international
relations at San Francisco State
College, describes how the Amer
ican Political Science Associa
tion reacted last year when it
was disclosed that two of its top
officers were also running a re
search firm funded by the CIA.
An investigation was held. In
reporting its results to the mem
bership, the ASA leadership
thanked the two men for their
"dedication and services" to the
Association, and otherwise con
centrated on proving that the
APSA itself was not a CIA
front.
Windmiller suggests that the
APSA was open to compromise
because many of its members
are involved in Government
work that compromises their
professional integrity. "When

scholars accept secret contracts,
go on secret missions, ask ques
tions abroad in behalf of intel
ligence agencies, refuse to Sis
cuss the purposes for which the
government funded their re
search, then that is both decep
tion and subversion of the aca
demic tradition," Windmiller
concludes.
Switch To Teaching
Windmiller suggests that the
solution to these corrupting ties
between Government and schol
ars is to get military and intel
ligence research off the campus,
to push for legislation that will
ensure funding for researchers
opposed to the Government's
policies as well as those in favor,
re-examine the assumptions that
underlie the United States' for
eign policy, and, finally, concen
trate more on teaching.
Windmiller is not the only
contributor to suggest solutions
for the present low condition of
universities. Theodore Roszak,
associate professor of history at
California State College in Hay
ward, and editor of this book,
suggests that scholars must be
come more actively involved in
political and social issues, and
that universities should make
it more rewarding for them to
do so.

get into such a war.
Incredible Failings
As described in this book,
some of the failings of academ
ics are almost incredible. Sum
ner Rosen, an economist writing
about the deficiencies of econom
ic work in this country, says
that the Impact of military
spending in the economy has
been all but ignored by profes
sional economists. According to
Rosen, "war and preparation for
war" is the most important sin
gle force in the economy today.
Why, then, has this area been
neglected?
It's hard to avoid the conclu
sion that economists, the group
that has come closest to the in
ner circles of power in this coun
try (what other discipline boasts
anything like the President's
Council of Economic Advisors?),
just plain don't want to point

out how dependent our economy
is on war-spending because it
would spoil their cozy relation
ship with the Government.
Economists, in other words,
accept the structure of the econ
omy, in the large, and address
to limited t°°h
nical aspects of it.
A similar criticism of anthro
pologists is made by Kathleen
Gough. She says that anthropol
ogists in general study primitive
cultures, and sometimes even
examine the impact of Western
society of these cultures, with
out considering the larger ques
tion of Western imperialism, its
origins and overall impact.
Miss Gough, who is on the
faculty at Simon Fraser Uni
versity in Canada (she has also
taught at American institu
tions), suggests that the tradi
tion of concentrating on out-of
the-way cultures has given an
thropologists a means of evad
ing the larger questions, which
in turn has meant that they can
take Government research
grants without qualms about
what their.Government may be
doing to non-Western peoples
around the world.
Few Public Stands
Some of the contributors to
the Dissenting Academy discuss
the role, or non-role of profes
sional associations in their re
spective disciplines with regard
to taking public stands on is
sues.
Louis Kampf, an associate pro
fessor of Humanities at MIT,
says the Modern Language As

sociation is more a "trade asso
ciation" than a professional as
sociation, a group whose "natu
ral drift is toward the councils
of the Chamber of Commerce."
He describes the total lack of
concern with public issues, such
as Vietnam, at a recent MLA
convention as a consequence of
the understanding by its mem
bership that their affluence ulti
mately depends on the Cold
War. "The buffonery at the MLA
convention," writes Kampf, "is
the visible sign of a competitive
spirit, of an acquisitiveness,
which is ready to cut throats;
further, it pictures not only pri
vate feelings, but the structure
of a society which is learning to
exploit its men of learning."
Marshall Windmiller, an asso
ciate professor of international
relations at San Francisco State
College, describes how the Amer
ican Political Science Associa
tion reacted last year when it
was disclosed that two of its top
officers were also running a re
search firm funded by the CIA.
An investigation was held. In
reporting its results to the mem
bership, the ASA leadership
thanked the two men for their
"dedication and services" to the
Association, and otherwise con
centrated on proving that the
APSA itself was not a CIA
front.
Windmiller suggests that the
APSA was open to compromise
because many of its members
are involved in Government
work that compromises their
professional integrity. "When

scholars accept secret contracts,
go on secret missions, ask ques
tions abroad in behalf of intel
ligence agencies, refuse to Sis
cuss the purposes for which the
government funded their re
search, then that is both decep
tion and subversion of the aca
demic tradition," Windmiller
concludes.
Switch To Teaching
Windmiller suggests that the
solution to these corrupting ties
between Government and schol
ars is to get military and intel
ligence research off the campus,
to push for legislation that will
ensure funding for researchers
opposed to the Government's
policies as well as those in favor,
re-examine the assumptions that
underlie the United States' for
eign policy, and, finally, concen
trate more on teaching.
Windmiller is not the only
contributor to suggest solutions
for the present low condition of
universities. Theodore Roszak,
associate professor of history at
California State College in Hay
ward, and editor of this book,
suggests that scholars must be
come more actively involved in
political and social issues, and
that universities should make
it more rewarding for them to
do so.

Sometime between World War
II and the demise of Sen. Joseph
McCarthy, a general attitude
that has been described as liberal
anti-communism became the pre
vailing attitude of the American
intellectual community.
The basic premises of liberal
anti-communism were two: that
the Government should be en
couraged to pursue its policy of
containing Communism abroad,
and that it should be prodded to
cure whatever social ills might
still be in existence at home.
At the time liberal anti-Com
munism was blossoming, there
is no doubt that many of its ad
vocates believed they were tak
ing a stand that was both ideal
istic and sensible. Stalin's re
pressive and cynical methods of
ruling seemed to discredit Com
munism as a means of achieving
social progress while the United
States seemed to be taking a
genuinely progressive role in the
world with such programs as
the Marshall Plan.
Whatever the validity of this
view of the world, it permitted
academics and intellectuals to go
to work for the government, or
at least to work on Government
sponsored projects, in good con
science. Criticism, if it was en
couraged at all, was directed at
particular programs or parts of
programs rather than at the for
eign policy or the society's struc
ture as a whole.
Government, under pressure
to keep up with the Soviets in
the missile race, the space race,
and in other races, threw off its
traditional distrust of the intel
lectual community and began
funding research programs at
the universities.

While the amount of money
that has gone out as research
grants to universities is not
small, it is nothing compared to
the indirect subsidies that uni
versities have received in states
where industries were getting
fat on Government contracts. In
California, for example, the
aerospace industries needed en
gineers and scientists, and there
fore provided much of the po
litical pressure that led to the
massive growth of the Univer
sity of California system.
The consequences of the post
war romance between universi
ties and the Government are
what most, though not all, of
the eleven contributors to The
Dissenting Academy talk about.
Although it is clear that the
war in Vietnam is the starting
point for all of them, they do
not write so much about where
academics have failed in trying
to end the war as about the
larger failure of the universities
to criticize a society that would
get into such a war.

the visible sign of a competitive
spirit, of an acquisitiveness,
which is ready to cut throats;
further, it pictures not only pri
vate feelings, but the structure
of a society which is learning to
exploit its men of learning."
Marshall Windmiller, an asso

relations at San Francisco State
College, describes how the Amer
ican Political Science Associa
tion reacted last year when it
was disclosed that two of its top
officers were also running a re
search firm funded by the CIA.
An investigation was held. In
reporting its results to the mem
bership, the ASA leadership
thanked the two men for their
"dedication and services" to the
Association, and otherwise con
centrated on proving that the
APSA itself was not a CIA
front.
Windmiller suggests that the
APSA was open to compromise
because many of its members
are involved in Government
work that compromises their
professional integrity. "When

scholars accept secret contracts,
go on secret missions, ask ques
tions abroad in behalf of intel
ligence agencies, refuse to Sis
cuss the purposes for which the
government funded their re
search, then that is both decep
tion and subversion of the aca
demic tradition," Windmiller
concludes.
Switch To Teaching
Windmiller suggests that the
solution to these corrupting ties
between Government and schol
ars is to get military and intel
ligence research off the campus,
to push for legislation that will
ensure funding for researchers
opposed to the Government's
policies as well as those in favor,
re-examine the assumptions that
underlie the United States' for
eign policy, and, finally, concen
trate more on teaching.
Windmiller is not the only
contributor to suggest solutions
for the present low condition of
universities. Theodore Roszak,
associate professor of history at
California State College in Hay
ward, and editor of this book,
suggests that scholars must be
come more actively involved in
political and social issues, and
that universities should make
it more rewarding for them to
do so.

Sometime between World War
II and the demise of Sen. Joseph
McCarthy, a general attitude
that has been described as liberal
anti-communism became the pre
vailing attitude of the American
intellectual community.
The basic premises of liberal
anti-communism were two: that
the Government should be en
couraged to pursue its policy of
containing Communism abroad,
and that it should be prodded to
cure whatever social ills might
still be in existence at home.
At the time liberal anti-Com
munism was blossoming, there
is no doubt that many of its ad
vocates believed they were tak
ing a stand that was both ideal
istic and sensible. Stalin's re
pressive and cynical methods of
ruling seemed to discredit Com
munism as a means of achieving
social progress while the United
States seemed to be taking a
genuinely progressive role in the
world with such programs as
the Marshall Plan.
Whatever the validity of this
view of the world, it permitted
academics and intellectuals to go
to work for the government, or
at least to work on Government
sponsored projects, in good con
science. Criticism, if it was en
couraged at all, was directed at
particular programs or parts of
programs rather than at the for
eign policy or the society's struc
ture as a whole.
Government, under pressure
to keep up with the Soviets in
the missile race, the space race,
and in other races, threw off its
traditional distrust of the intel
lectual community and began
funding research programs at
the universities.

While the amount of money
that has gone out as research
grants to universities is not
small, it is nothing compared to
the indirect subsidies that uni
versities have received in states
where industries were getting
fat on Government contracts. In
California, for example, the
aerospace industries needed en
gineers and scientists, and there
fore provided much of the po
litical pressure that led to the
massive growth of the Univer
sity of California system.
The consequences of the post
war romance between universi
ties and the Government are
what most, though not all, of
the eleven contributors to The
Dissenting Academy talk about.
Although it is clear that the
war in Vietnam is the starting
point for all of them, they do
not write so much about where
academics have failed in trying
to end the war as about the
larger failure of the universities
to criticize a society that would
get into such a war.
Incredible Failings
As described in this book,
some of the failings of academ
ics are almost incredible. Sum
ner Rosen, an economist writing
about the deficiencies of econom
ic work in this country, says
that the Impact of military
spending in the economy has
been all but ignored by profes
sional economists. According to
Rosen, "war and preparation for
war" is the most important sin
gle force in the economy today.
Why, then, has this area been
neglected?
It's hard to avoid the conclu
sion that economists, the group
that has come closest to the in
ner circles of power in this coun
try (what other discipline boasts
anything like the President's
Council of Economic Advisors?),
just plain don't want to point

out how dependent our economy
is on war-spending because it
would spoil their cozy relation
ship with the Government.
Economists, in other words,
accept the structure of the econ
omy, in the large, and address
to limited t°°h
nical aspects of it.
A similar criticism of anthro
pologists is made by Kathleen
Gough. She says that anthropol
ogists in general study primitive
cultures, and sometimes even
examine the impact of Western
society of these cultures, with
out considering the larger ques
tion of Western imperialism, its
origins and overall impact.
Miss Gough, who is on the
faculty at Simon Fraser Uni
versity in Canada (she has also
taught at American institu
tions), suggests that the tradi
tion of concentrating on out-of
the-way cultures has given an
thropologists a means of evad
ing the larger questions, which
in turn has meant that they can
take Government research
grants without qualms about
what their.Government may be
doing to non-Western peoples
around the world.
Few Public Stands
Some of the contributors to
the Dissenting Academy discuss
the role, or non-role of profes
sional associations in their re
spective disciplines with regard
to taking public stands on is
sues.
Louis Kampf, an associate pro
fessor of Humanities at MIT,
says the Modern Language As

sociation is more a "trade asso
ciation" than a professional as
sociation, a group whose "natu
ral drift is toward the councils
of the Chamber of Commerce."
He describes the total lack of
concern with public issues, such
as Vietnam, at a recent MLA
convention as a consequence of
the understanding by its mem
bership that their affluence ulti
mately depends on the Cold
War. "The buffonery at the MLA
convention," writes Kampf, "is
the visible sign of a competitive
spirit, of an acquisitiveness,
which is ready to cut throats;
further, it pictures not only pri

and that it should be prodded to
cure whatever social ills might
still be in existence at home.
At the time liberal anti-Com
munism was blossoming, there
is no doubt that many of its ad
vocates believed they were tak
ing a stand that was both ideal
istic and sensible. Stalin's re
pressive and cynical methods of
ruling seemed to discredit Com
munism as a means of achieving
social progress while the United
States seemed to be taking a
genuinely progressive role in the
world with such programs as
the Marshall Plan.
Whatever the validity of this
view of the world, it permitted
academics and intellectuals to go
to work for the government, or
at least to work on Government
sponsored projects, in good con
science. Criticism, if it was en
couraged at all, was directed at
particular programs or parts of
programs rather than at the for
eign policy or the society's struc
ture as a whole.
Government, under pressure
to keep up with the Soviets in
the missile race, the space race,
and in other races, threw off its
traditional distrust of the intel
lectual community and began
funding research programs at
the universities.

While the amount of money
that has gone out as research
grants to universities is not
small, it is nothing compared to
the indirect subsidies that uni
versities have received in states
where industries were getting
fat on Government contracts. In
California, for example, the
aerospace industries needed en
gineers and scientists, and there
fore provided much of the po
litical pressure that led to the
massive growth of the Univer
sity of California system.
The consequences of the post
war romance between universi
ties and the Government are
what most, though not all, of
the eleven contributors to The
Dissenting Academy talk about.
Although it is clear that the
war in Vietnam is the starting
point for all of them, they do
not write so much about where
academics have failed in trying
to end the war as about the
larger failure of the universities
to criticize a society that would
get into such a war.
Incredible Failings
As described in this book,
some of the failings of academ
ics are almost incredible. Sum
ner Rosen, an economist writing
about the deficiencies of econom
ic work in this country, says
that the Impact of military
spending in the economy has
been all but ignored by profes
sional economists. According to
Rosen, "war and preparation for
war" is the most important sin
gle force in the economy today.
Why, then, has this area been
neglected?
It's hard to avoid the conclu
sion that economists, the group
that has come closest to the in
ner circles of power in this coun
try (what other discipline boasts
anything like the President's
Council of Economic Advisors?),
just plain don't want to point

out how dependent our economy
is on war-spending because it
would spoil their cozy relation
ship with the Government.
Economists, in other words,
accept the structure of the econ
omy, in the large, and address
to limited t°°h
nical aspects of it.
A similar criticism of anthro
pologists is made by Kathleen
Gough. She says that anthropol
ogists in general study primitive
cultures, and sometimes even
examine the impact of Western
society of these cultures, with
out considering the larger ques
tion of Western imperialism, its
origins and overall impact.
Miss Gough, who is on the
faculty at Simon Fraser Uni
versity in Canada (she has also
taught at American institu
tions), suggests that the tradi
tion of concentrating on out-of
the-way cultures has given an
thropologists a means of evad
ing the larger questions, which
in turn has meant that they can
take Government research
grants without qualms about
what their.Government may be
doing to non-Western peoples
around the world.
Few Public Stands
Some of the contributors to
the Dissenting Academy discuss
the role, or non-role of profes
sional associations in their re
spective disciplines with regard
to taking public stands on is
sues.
Louis Kampf, an associate pro
fessor of Humanities at MIT,
says the Modern Language As

sociation is more a "trade asso
ciation" than a professional as
sociation, a group whose "natu
ral drift is toward the councils
of the Chamber of Commerce."
He describes the total lack of
concern with public issues, such
as Vietnam, at a recent MLA
convention as a consequence of
the understanding by its mem
bership that their affluence ulti
mately depends on the Cold
War. "The buffonery at the MLA
convention," writes Kampf, "is
the visible sign of a competitive
spirit, of an acquisitiveness,
which is ready to cut throats;
further, it pictures not only pri
vate feelings, but the structure
of a society which is learning to
exploit its men of learning."
Marshall Windmiller, an asso
ciate professor of international
relations at San Francisco State
College, describes how the Amer
ican Political Science Associa
tion reacted last year when it
was disclosed that two of its top
officers were also running a re
search firm funded by the CIA.
An investigation was held. In
reporting its results to the mem
bership, the ASA leadership
thanked the two men for their
"dedication and services" to the
Association, and otherwise con
centrated on proving that the
APSA itself was not a CIA
front.
Windmiller suggests that the
APSA was open to compromise
because many of its members
are involved in Government
work that compromises their
professional integrity. "When

scholars accept secret contracts,
go on secret missions, ask ques
tions abroad in behalf of intel
ligence agencies, refuse to Sis
cuss the purposes for which the
government funded their re
search, then that is both decep
tion and subversion of the aca
demic tradition," Windmiller
concludes.
Switch To Teaching
Windmiller suggests that the
solution to these corrupting ties
between Government and schol
ars is to get military and intel
ligence research off the campus,
to push for legislation that will
ensure funding for researchers
opposed to the Government's
policies as well as those in favor,
re-examine the assumptions that
underlie the United States' for
eign policy, and, finally, concen
trate more on teaching.
Windmiller is not the only
contributor to suggest solutions
for the present low condition of
universities. Theodore Roszak,
associate professor of history at
California State College in Hay
ward, and editor of this book,
suggests that scholars must be
come more actively involved in
political and social issues, and
that universities should make
it more rewarding for them to
do so.

Sometime between World War
II and the demise of Sen. Joseph
McCarthy, a general attitude
that has been described as liberal
anti-communism became the pre
vailing attitude of the American
intellectual community.
The basic premises of liberal
anti-communism were two: that
the Government should be en
couraged to pursue its policy of
containing Communism abroad,
and that it should be prodded to
cure whatever social ills might
still be in existence at home.
At the time liberal anti-Com
munism was blossoming, there
is no doubt that many of its ad
vocates believed they were tak
ing a stand that was both ideal
istic and sensible. Stalin's re
pressive and cynical methods of
ruling seemed to discredit Com
munism as a means of achieving
social progress while the United
States seemed to be taking a
genuinely progressive role in the
world with such programs as

view of the world, it permitted
