# The 						Washington Merry-Go-Round
## Johnson Made Sacrifice 
### Drew Pearson 
WASHINGTON — There was
something a little sad about the
way Lyndon Johnson bowed out
of the Presidential race the oth
er night. It was not merely the
sight of an old battler retiring
from the ring, but because so
many commentators interpreted
it as a surrender to the political
polls where he was licked.
Those who know him well,
however — and I have known
him 35 years — knew that he
acted from conviction; and that
he was making a great sacri
fice, with the country's unity
in his heart.
There had been telltale hints
before that he would not run
again. I recall a remark he made
privately just one year ago this
spring. "There is so much to do
and so little time to do it,"he
said. This column published,
Dec. 26, 1966, "President John
son's intimates hint that he may
not seek re-election in 1968."
Again, on Dec. 11, '67, the col
umn repeated, "LBJ, in the pres
ence of Mrs. Johnson, recently
told intimates, including Secre
tary of State Dean Rusk, that
he definitely did not intend to

run for re-election next year."
Only last week he was quite
philosophic about the fact he
had no organization in the field
to combat the fervid goings and
comings of Bobby Kennedy.
"I know what he's doing," the
President told a friend. "One
Democratic leader came in here
to tell us that he had six tele
grams and phone calls from dif
ferent Kennedy people in one
day. Bobby's been sending tele
grams saying, "I know you are
pledged to Johnson, but I feel
a bond of affection with you.'
He's made hundreds of phone
calls all over the country. He
has the son-in-law of Bill Paley,
head of CBS, working for him.
NBC puts him on three times
a day.
"However, I can't do anything
about it. I've got too much to do
here. I'm not going to go out
and campaign. They're going to
have to take me or leave me. If
I'm defeated, that's just too bad.
If they want Bobby Kennedy,
that's what they'll get; and they
may wind up "with Nixon in the
end."
I suspect that it was two years

ago that the President first came
to a semi-conclusion that he
would not run for another term.
It was just after his gallstone
operation — the second abdomi
nal operation in about 12
months. While he was recover
ing from that operation, Bill
Moyers, a young man upon
whom he had leaned heavily, re
tired to become publisher of
Newsday.
The President has no sons and,
to some extent, Bill Moyers oc
cupied a son's place with him.
LBJ can be pretty gruff and de
manding with those around him.
Outwardly he doesn't seem to
appreciate their work, and some
times it was that way with
Moyers. Underneath, however,
there was genuine personal af
fection.
But Moyers wanted to be Un
der Secretary of State when Geo
rge Ball retired, and the Presi
dent wouldn't go for that. Bill
was only 30, had no real experi
ence in foreign affairs; so Attor
ney General Nick Katzenbach
was appointed instead.
At about that time, Moyers
had become intimate with Bobby

Kennedy, who had opposed LBJ
almost from the minute he was
picked for Vice President; and
it was Bobby who got Moyers
his new post with Newsday.
The President knew some
thing of this and, although he
said nothing, Moyer's retirement
was a deeper blow than anyone
knew.
Regardless of when he made
the decision, however, I am con
vinced that he made it because
he felt it was good for the unity
of the country.
LBJ Is Idealist
There is one thing most peo
ple don't understand about Lyn
don Johnson. He looks like a
politician. He acts like a politi
cian. He is a politician. But also
he's a great idealist. When he
talks about his country and
what's good for his country, he
means it. When he talks about
education and school teachers
and helping children, he means
it.
Orville Freeman, who has
served as Secretary of Agricul
ture longer than anyone in his
tory, put it this way privately
last week:
"I campaigned my head off
for Jack Kennedy. I'm a Luth
eran and was head of my Ma
sonic lodge, but I was convinc
ed we must break the taboo
against a Catholic as President.
I worked so hard that I was de
feated for another term as gov
ernor of Minnesota.
"When Kennedy took Lyndon
on as Vice President, no one was
more surprised than I. Along
with labor, I didn't like it. Then
I got to know this guy and his
convictions. He doesn't come
across well on television or with
the public. He looks like a poli
tician. But what other President
has put across the educational
program he has? Why? Because
he believes in it. Or the civil
rights program? It has hurt him
politically. It cost him votes.
Why did he do it? Because he
believes in it.
"Take home rule for the Dis
trict of Columbia. There was no
political mileage in that; not a
single vote. But he thought it
was right. And no man in his
tory has worked harder for
home rule than Lyndon John
son."
So spoke a Kennedy member
of the Cabinet.
It will take the public a long
time to understand Lyndon John
son. But I am convinced, hav
ing known him since he was a
gangling young Congressman
from Texas, that he is bowing
out of the Presidency because
he thinks it's right.

Only last week he was quite
philosophic about the fact he
had no organization in the field
to combat the fervid goings and
comings of Bobby Kennedy.
"I know what he's doing," the
President told a friend. "One
Democratic leader came in here
to tell us that he had six tele
grams and phone calls from dif
ferent Kennedy people in one
day. Bobby's been sending tele
grams saying, "I know you are
pledged to Johnson, but I feel
a bond of affection with you.'
He's made hundreds of phone
calls all over the country. He
has the son-in-law of Bill Paley,
head of CBS, working for him.
NBC puts him on three times
a day.
"However, I can't do anything
about it. I've got too much to do
here. I'm not going to go out
and campaign. They're going to
have to take me or leave me. If
I'm defeated, that's just too bad.
If they want Bobby Kennedy,
that's what they'll get; and they
may wind up "with Nixon in the
end."
I suspect that it was two years

ago that the President first came
to a semi-conclusion that he
would not run for another term.
It was just after his gallstone
operation — the second abdomi
nal operation in about 12
months. While he was recover
ing from that operation, Bill
Moyers, a young man upon
whom he had leaned heavily, re
tired to become publisher of
Newsday.
The President has no sons and,
to some extent, Bill Moyers oc
cupied a son's place with him.
LBJ can be pretty gruff and de
manding with those around him.
Outwardly he doesn't seem to
appreciate their work, and some
times it was that way with
Moyers. Underneath, however,
there was genuine personal af
fection.
But Moyers wanted to be Un
der Secretary of State when Geo
rge Ball retired, and the Presi
dent wouldn't go for that. Bill
was only 30, had no real experi
ence in foreign affairs; so Attor
ney General Nick Katzenbach
was appointed instead.
At about that time, Moyers
had become intimate with Bobby

Kennedy, who had opposed LBJ
almost from the minute he was
picked for Vice President; and
it was Bobby who got Moyers
his new post with Newsday.
The President knew some
thing of this and, although he
said nothing, Moyer's retirement
was a deeper blow than anyone
knew.
Regardless of when he made
the decision, however, I am con
vinced that he made it because
he felt it was good for the unity
of the country.
LBJ Is Idealist
There is one thing most peo
ple don't understand about Lyn
don Johnson. He looks like a
politician. He acts like a politi
cian. He is a politician. But also
he's a great idealist. When he
talks about his country and
what's good for his country, he
means it. When he talks about
education and school teachers
and helping children, he means
it.
Orville Freeman, who has
served as Secretary of Agricul
ture longer than anyone in his
tory, put it this way privately
last week:
"I campaigned my head off
for Jack Kennedy. I'm a Luth
eran and was head of my Ma
sonic lodge, but I was convinc
ed we must break the taboo
against a Catholic as President.
I worked so hard that I was de
feated for another term as gov
ernor of Minnesota.
"When Kennedy took Lyndon
on as Vice President, no one was
more surprised than I. Along
with labor, I didn't like it. Then
I got to know this guy and his
convictions. He doesn't come
across well on television or with
the public. He looks like a poli
tician. But what other President
has put across the educational
program he has? Why? Because
he believes in it. Or the civil
rights program? It has hurt him
politically. It cost him votes.
Why did he do it? Because he
believes in it.
"Take home rule for the Dis
trict of Columbia. There was no
political mileage in that; not a
single vote. But he thought it
was right. And no man in his
tory has worked harder for
home rule than Lyndon John
son."
So spoke a Kennedy member
of the Cabinet.
It will take the public a long
time to understand Lyndon John
son. But I am convinced, hav
ing known him since he was a
gangling young Congressman
from Texas, that he is bowing
out of the Presidency because
he thinks it's right.

WASHINGTON — There was
something a little sad about the
way Lyndon Johnson bowed out
of the Presidential race the oth
er night. It was not merely the
sight of an old battler retiring
from the ring, but because so
many commentators interpreted
it as a surrender to the political
polls where he was licked.
Those who know him well,
however — and I have known
him 35 years — knew that he
acted from conviction; and that

It was just after his gallstone
operation — the second abdomi
nal operation in about 12
months. While he was recover
ing from that operation, Bill
Moyers, a young man upon
whom he had leaned heavily, re
tired to become publisher of
Newsday.
The President has no sons and,
to some extent, Bill Moyers oc
cupied a son's place with him.
LBJ can be pretty gruff and de
manding with those around him.
Outwardly he doesn't seem to
appreciate their work, and some
times it was that way with
Moyers. Underneath, however,
there was genuine personal af
fection.
But Moyers wanted to be Un
der Secretary of State when Geo
rge Ball retired, and the Presi
dent wouldn't go for that. Bill
was only 30, had no real experi
ence in foreign affairs; so Attor
ney General Nick Katzenbach
was appointed instead.
At about that time, Moyers
had become intimate with Bobby

Kennedy, who had opposed LBJ
almost from the minute he was
picked for Vice President; and
it was Bobby who got Moyers
his new post with Newsday.
The President knew some
thing of this and, although he
said nothing, Moyer's retirement
was a deeper blow than anyone
knew.
Regardless of when he made
the decision, however, I am con
vinced that he made it because
he felt it was good for the unity
of the country.
LBJ Is Idealist
There is one thing most peo
ple don't understand about Lyn
don Johnson. He looks like a
politician. He acts like a politi
cian. He is a politician. But also
he's a great idealist. When he
talks about his country and
what's good for his country, he
means it. When he talks about
education and school teachers
and helping children, he means
it.
Orville Freeman, who has
served as Secretary of Agricul
ture longer than anyone in his
tory, put it this way privately
last week:
"I campaigned my head off
for Jack Kennedy. I'm a Luth
eran and was head of my Ma
sonic lodge, but I was convinc
ed we must break the taboo
against a Catholic as President.
I worked so hard that I was de
feated for another term as gov
ernor of Minnesota.
"When Kennedy took Lyndon
on as Vice President, no one was
more surprised than I. Along
with labor, I didn't like it. Then
I got to know this guy and his
convictions. He doesn't come
across well on television or with
the public. He looks like a poli
tician. But what other President
has put across the educational
program he has? Why? Because
he believes in it. Or the civil
rights program? It has hurt him
politically. It cost him votes.
Why did he do it? Because he
believes in it.
"Take home rule for the Dis
trict of Columbia. There was no
political mileage in that; not a
single vote. But he thought it
was right. And no man in his
tory has worked harder for
home rule than Lyndon John
son."
So spoke a Kennedy member
of the Cabinet.
It will take the public a long
time to understand Lyndon John
son. But I am convinced, hav
ing known him since he was a
gangling young Congressman
from Texas, that he is bowing
out of the Presidency because
he thinks it's right.

WASHINGTON — There was
something a little sad about the
way Lyndon Johnson bowed out
of the Presidential race the oth
er night. It was not merely the
sight of an old battler retiring
from the ring, but because so
many commentators interpreted
it as a surrender to the political
polls where he was licked.
Those who know him well,
however — and I have known
him 35 years — knew that he
acted from conviction; and that
he was making a great sacri
fice, with the country's unity
in his heart.
There had been telltale hints
before that he would not run
again. I recall a remark he made
privately just one year ago this
spring. "There is so much to do
and so little time to do it,"he
said. This column published,
Dec. 26, 1966, "President John
son's intimates hint that he may
not seek re-election in 1968."
Again, on Dec. 11, '67, the col
umn repeated, "LBJ, in the pres
ence of Mrs. Johnson, recently
told intimates, including Secre
tary of State Dean Rusk, that
he definitely did not intend to

run for re-election next year."
Only last week he was quite
philosophic about the fact he
had no organization in the field
to combat the fervid goings and
comings of Bobby Kennedy.
"I know what he's doing," the
President told a friend. "One
Democratic leader came in here
to tell us that he had six tele
grams and phone calls from dif
ferent Kennedy people in one
day. Bobby's been sending tele
grams saying, "I know you are
pledged to Johnson, but I feel
a bond of affection with you.'
He's made hundreds of phone
calls all over the country. He
has the son-in-law of Bill Paley,
head of CBS, working for him.
NBC puts him on three times
a day.
"However, I can't do anything
about it. I've got too much to do
here. I'm not going to go out
and campaign. They're going to
have to take me or leave me. If
I'm defeated, that's just too bad.
If they want Bobby Kennedy,
that's what they'll get; and they
may wind up "with Nixon in the
end."
I suspect that it was two years

ago that the President first came
to a semi-conclusion that he
would not run for another term.
