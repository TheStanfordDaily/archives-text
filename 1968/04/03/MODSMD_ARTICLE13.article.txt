# BSU Head Hits Racism Here

(The following interview took
place by written correspondence
last quarter between DAILY re
porter Steve Rutkus and Kenny
Washington, co-chairman of the
Stanford Black Students Union.
It is printed in full.)
Q: On the increased admis
sions of black students: should
the emphasis be placed on re
cruitment, scholarships, lower
ing admission standards, or
what?
A. When one takes into con
sideration one of the more ob
vious and oft-repeated results
of white social oppression as it
works on Blacks, Indians, and
Mexican-Americans, from an in
stitution that directly and vicar
iously has always reaped the
full economic and social fruits
of America's peculiar system,
the question of monetary assis
tance is at best disgustingly
gratuitous.
Of course there should be
economic assistance. To con
sider any equitable increase in
Black student enrollment, we
are automatically speaking of
America's most acute economic
disenfranchisement.

What is not so well known—
even by certain Stanford ad
ministrators who speak from
personal sicknesses and hang
ups that are meant as authorita
tive truth —is that, of the two
categories of studehts admitted
to Stanford, "automatic" and
"competitive-judge m en t," a
smaller percentage of Black Stu
dents at Stanford than white
students fall into the latter cate
gory. And of the Black students
rejected last year, 50 per cent
were as academically qualified
as most of the students now en
rolled, and the reason for their
rejection was Economic.
My own feeling is that for
any young Black person (or
white or Red) motivated by
strong desires for an education
that in some dynamic way,
speaks to him as a human be
ing in this society and in this
world today, I would be setting
a trap for four years of (with
few exceptions) systematic
emptiness in trying to interest
him in Stanford.
Stanford's educational benefit
is not comensurate with Stan
ford's student tax, in terms of
time from one's life or money.
You may guess my feelings on
"recruitment" accordingly.
Q: What do you say to the
argument that there are not
enough black students who
qualify under Stanford's aca
demic standards to meet the
broad new admissions quotas
for black students that are now
being proposed in some circles?
A: Bull shit.
Q: Should scholastically un
prepared blacks be admitted to
Stanford? If yes, how might
such persons adapt themselves
to the competitive nature of
Stanford academic life?
A: The intelligence behind a
competitive learning system of
equitable "opportunity for all"
is questionable. Determining the
appropriateness of crude com
petition infused into a system of
educating People, hinges upon
more than those People's schol
astic preparedness for the sys
tem; academic preparedness is a
very narrow sphere to sensitive
people. It is merely academic.

I am not convinced of what
people are truly scholastically
unprepared for Stanford. How
ever, assuming a continuance of
the limited terms of the present
system of admissions, and most
importantly, the limited terms
of personal worth and success
after arrival, no.
Q: How acurately and mean
ingfully have the news media at
Stanford reported the activities
of black students and the issues
which particularly relate to
black students?
A: The great bulk of activity
that takes place throughout the
Black Student's Union we have
little or no desire in seeing re
produced and inevitably miscon
strued in The Daily. The Dally
has considerable problems
enough dealing accurately with
events of its own culturally
familiar White-Middle-Class
quasi-racial frame of reference.
For it to meaningfully report
or interpret Black events is ob
viously out of the question: e.g.,

The Daily's childishly banal crit
ique of Black On Black; its lu
dicrous build-up of a "letter of
resignation"from four BSU'ers,
resignations which were wel
comed by all other members
as the uneventful exit of buf
foonery and self-service.
Relative to the whole of the
Afro-American movement to
day, the news media have re
ceived very little notification.
For obvious reasons of the mass
media's own ineffectuality in
in dealing with issues that don't
serve to some extent america's
historical and racial norm, we
no longer expect accuracy in
news interpretation and thusly
the whole issue becomes unim
portant.
From our stance. The Daily is
all the more heinous (and there
fore expendable) because it is
not as vulnerable to the stulti
fying effects of competition as
they work to undermine unpal
atable truths.

LAKE MISTAKE? — Perhaps, but we like to think this placid little body of water on the west side
of Outer Quad was planned that way. Workers at the site, their aesthetic sense apparently of
fended, however, searched for a drain pipe yesterday — in vain, we are happy to report, but even
after the springtime sun dries it up or someone pumps it out, may we long think of Lake Mistake as
a touching reminder that engineering disasters sometimes have temporarily happy endings.
