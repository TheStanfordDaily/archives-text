# UC Expels Senior For Role In Mill-In
## 
### 
University of California at
Berkeley officials announced
Monday they have dismissed
Marion Cohen, a 23 year old sen
ior and given lesser punish
ments to six other students for
their roles in demonstrations
against Dow Chemical Company
and the CIA last November.
The punishments were the
last of a series that had involved
more than 130 students and
stemmed from a campus contro
versy that had begun with Stop
the Draft Week last October.
During the October disagree
ment, five "unauthorized rallies"
were conducted on the Berkeley
campus and 81 students were
cited.
About a month later, student
activists protested the presence
of Dow and CIA recruiters on
campus and broke through a po

lice line to picket the campus
placement center. Thirty-four
students were cited.
Then, late in December, Chan
cellor Roger W. Heyns an
nounced that two students had
been suspended for the Stop the
Draft Week rallies and the ac
tivists responded with three days
of "mill-ins" in campus adminis
tration buildings. University of
ficials cited 41 students for the
demonstrations.
In all, University officials said,
the punishments comprised
these groups: dismissed, 1; sus
pended, 8; given suspended sus
pensions and put on disciplinary
probation, 12; placed on disci
plinary probation 22; censured
and warned, 8; warned 57;
charges dropped, 40; and one
student left before his case
could be heard.
