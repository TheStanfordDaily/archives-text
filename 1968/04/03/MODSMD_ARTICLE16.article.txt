## 'Tarluffe' Is Here Tonight 
### ROBIN LAKE 
Le Treteau de Paris came
through San Francisco last
month with La Comedie des Al
pes' production of En Attendant
Godot. They played at Berkeley,
but due to scheduling problems
were unable to appear at Stan
ford as they have in the past.
However, all is not lost. Their
follow-up company will be in
Memorial Auditorium at 8 p.m.
tonight with a new staging of
Moliere's classic Tartuffe, direct
ed by Yves Gasc, who plays the
title role.
Artistic director for Le Tre
teau is Jean de Rigault, the
man who Introduced Marcel
Marceau to America. Thanks
to de Rigault North Ameri
cans have, since 1955, had an
nual opportunity to see the
world's foremost exponent of
the art of MIME.
In 1958, de Rigault produced
the first tour of American uni
versity theatres ever made by a
troupe of professional French
actors. Eleven campuses were
visited on that tour with Ra
cine's tragedy, Brltannlcus — a
bold choice—starring Marguer
ite Jamois.
The second tour, in 1960, fea
tured Le Misanthrope from coast
to coast, then went on to com
plete the first round-the-world
tour of a professional French
troupe since Sarah Bernhardt's
in 1891.
From then on the enthusias
tic public reception and sup-

port from the sponsors estab
lished the North American
tour as an annual undertak
ing, prompting Jean de Ri
fault to found Le Treteau de
Paris "the portable boards of
Paris," as a permanent pro
duction management.
From 1958 to 1968, coast-to
coast tours, all sponsored and
subsidized by the Association
Francaise d'Action Artistique
have totalled 600 performances
before campus audiences of over
550,000 spectators.
Alert to producing plays pro
vocative for the American audi
ences, Jean de Rigault chooses
each season from among classi
cal and modern French play
wrights. The troupe members
are engaged in Paris for each
individual tour. Plays are pre
sented as they are done in
France and the casts, headed by
outstanding actors, read like a
Who's Who of the French
stage.
The inventiveness of each pro
duction is assured by directors
like Nicolas Bataille, Pierre
Franck, Jacques Charon, Yves
Gasc, and is enhanced by design
ers like Jacques Noel, Jean-Den
is Malcles, Andre Levasseur, and
Andre Acquart.
Tartuffe Is probably known
well enough to need no intro
duction.
For those who have never
seen or read it and are hesitant
about the language barrier. I
suggest the bilingual parallel

edition of the text. Translated by
Herr van Laun, it is the first in
a new series—another indication
of the particular popularity of
this play.
In addition (and a golden op
portunity for comparative criti
cism not to be missed by serious
students of the theater as well
as the serious theater-goer) I
recommend a visit to ACTs
TartufTe now playing in reper
tory in San Francisco.
It is one of their most success
ful productions. The next pre
sentations are at 2:00 p.m. to
morrow and 8:30 p.m. April 9.
ACT director William Ball uses
the new Richard Wilbur transla
tion, and while purists may not
agree with the interpretation, I
can promise a thoroughly enter
taining evening of typically
stylistic staging.
Incidentally it is a new cast
from last season when Rene Au
berjonois played an unforgetta
ble title role—so if you saw it
then, go again.
A particularly acclaimed re
cent production was a Brech
tian style TartufTe staged by
Roger Planchon at the Thea
tre de France in 1964. Some
readers will undoubtedly re
member the memorable local
performance in 1965 with
Stanford's own Gerry Hiken
in the title role.
Well, there you are! If you
kicked yourself for missing
Godot and Marceau there's no

excuse for missing Tartuffe
right here on your front door
step.
Curtain time Is 8 p.m. Tickets
at Tresidder or at the door.
Although we might expect
a basic setting with a road
show, I have no hints as to
interpretation. The two lead
ing French approaches are le
sinistra of Louis Jmi vet and
le bon vivant of du Croisy,
the original creator of the
role.
The cast will include Jacques
Sereys, who was for ten years
until 1965 a "societaire of La
Comedie Francaise, played the
lead in the Treteau's 1965 tour
of Feu la Mere de Madanie, by
Feydeau.
Marcelle Ransom has per
formed often with the Theatre
National Populaire, was a mem
ber of La Compagnie Jean-Louis
Barrault, and had a lead in the
1965 production at the Theatre
de France-Odeon of Genet's The
Screens.
She also played Albine in the
1958 pioneering tour of North
America in Racine's Brltannicus.
Giselle Touret will be remem
bered as Arsinoe in the 1960
production of Le Misanthrope.
The role of Orgen is played by
Gilles Leger.
By the way, if you really can't
make it on Wednesday, there
will be two shows the following
day in San Francisco at the Vet
erans' Auditorium. Curtain
times are 2:30 and 8:30 p.m.

For those who have never
seen or read it and are hesitant
about the language barrier. I
suggest the bilingual parallel

edition of the text. Translated by
Herr van Laun, it is the first in
a new series—another indication
of the particular popularity of
this play.
In addition (and a golden op
portunity for comparative criti
cism not to be missed by serious
students of the theater as well
as the serious theater-goer) I
recommend a visit to ACTs
TartufTe now playing in reper
tory in San Francisco.
It is one of their most success
ful productions. The next pre
sentations are at 2:00 p.m. to
morrow and 8:30 p.m. April 9.
ACT director William Ball uses
the new Richard Wilbur transla
tion, and while purists may not
agree with the interpretation, I
can promise a thoroughly enter
taining evening of typically
stylistic staging.
Incidentally it is a new cast
from last season when Rene Au
berjonois played an unforgetta
ble title role—so if you saw it
then, go again.
A particularly acclaimed re
cent production was a Brech
tian style TartufTe staged by
Roger Planchon at the Thea
tre de France in 1964. Some
readers will undoubtedly re
member the memorable local
performance in 1965 with
Stanford's own Gerry Hiken
in the title role.
Well, there you are! If you
kicked yourself for missing
Godot and Marceau there's no

excuse for missing Tartuffe
right here on your front door
step.
Curtain time Is 8 p.m. Tickets
at Tresidder or at the door.
Although we might expect
a basic setting with a road
show, I have no hints as to
interpretation. The two lead
ing French approaches are le
sinistra of Louis Jmi vet and
le bon vivant of du Croisy,
the original creator of the
role.
The cast will include Jacques
Sereys, who was for ten years
until 1965 a "societaire of La
Comedie Francaise, played the
lead in the Treteau's 1965 tour
of Feu la Mere de Madanie, by
Feydeau.
Marcelle Ransom has per
formed often with the Theatre
National Populaire, was a mem
ber of La Compagnie Jean-Louis
Barrault, and had a lead in the
1965 production at the Theatre
de France-Odeon of Genet's The
Screens.
She also played Albine in the
1958 pioneering tour of North
America in Racine's Brltannicus.
Giselle Touret will be remem
bered as Arsinoe in the 1960
production of Le Misanthrope.
The role of Orgen is played by
Gilles Leger.
By the way, if you really can't
make it on Wednesday, there
will be two shows the following
day in San Francisco at the Vet
erans' Auditorium. Curtain
times are 2:30 and 8:30 p.m.
Le Treteau de Paris came
through San Francisco last
month with La Comedie des Al
pes' production of En Attendant
Godot. They played at Berkeley,
but due to scheduling problems
were unable to appear at Stan
ford as they have in the past.
However, all is not lost. Their
follow-up company will be in
Memorial Auditorium at 8 p.m.
tonight with a new staging of
Moliere's classic Tartuffe, direct
ed by Yves Gasc, who plays the
title role.
Artistic director for Le Tre
teau is Jean de Rigault, the
man who Introduced Marcel
Marceau to America. Thanks
to de Rigault North Ameri
cans have, since 1955, had an
nual opportunity to see the
world's foremost exponent of
the art of MIME.
In 1958, de Rigault produced
the first tour of American uni
versity theatres ever made by a
troupe of professional French
actors. Eleven campuses were
visited on that tour with Ra
cine's tragedy, Brltannlcus — a
bold choice—starring Marguer
ite Jamois.
The second tour, in 1960, fea
tured Le Misanthrope from coast
to coast, then went on to com
plete the first round-the-world
tour of a professional French
troupe since Sarah Bernhardt's
in 1891.
From then on the enthusias
tic public reception and sup-

port from the sponsors estab
lished the North American
tour as an annual undertak
ing, prompting Jean de Ri
fault to found Le Treteau de
Paris "the portable boards of
Paris," as a permanent pro
duction management.
From 1958 to 1968, coast-to
coast tours, all sponsored and
subsidized by the Association
Francaise d'Action Artistique
have totalled 600 performances
before campus audiences of over
550,000 spectators.
Alert to producing plays pro
vocative for the American audi
ences, Jean de Rigault chooses
each season from among classi
cal and modern French play
wrights. The troupe members
are engaged in Paris for each
individual tour. Plays are pre
sented as they are done in
France and the casts, headed by
outstanding actors, read like a
Who's Who of the French
stage.
The inventiveness of each pro
duction is assured by directors
like Nicolas Bataille, Pierre
Franck, Jacques Charon, Yves
Gasc, and is enhanced by design
ers like Jacques Noel, Jean-Den
is Malcles, Andre Levasseur, and
Andre Acquart.
Tartuffe Is probably known
well enough to need no intro
duction.

production of Le Misanthrope.
The role of Orgen is played by
Gilles Leger.
By the way, if you really can't
make it on Wednesday, there
will be two shows the following
day in San Francisco at the Vet
erans' Auditorium. Curtain
times are 2:30 and 8:30 p.m.
Le Treteau de Paris came
through San Francisco last
month with La Comedie des Al
pes' production of En Attendant
Godot. They played at Berkeley,
but due to scheduling problems
were unable to appear at Stan
ford as they have in the past.
However, all is not lost. Their
follow-up company will be in
Memorial Auditorium at 8 p.m.
tonight with a new staging of
Moliere's classic Tartuffe, direct
ed by Yves Gasc, who plays the
title role.
Artistic director for Le Tre
teau is Jean de Rigault, the
man who Introduced Marcel
Marceau to America. Thanks
to de Rigault North Ameri
cans have, since 1955, had an
nual opportunity to see the
world's foremost exponent of
the art of MIME.
In 1958, de Rigault produced
the first tour of American uni
versity theatres ever made by a
troupe of professional French
actors. Eleven campuses were
visited on that tour with Ra
cine's tragedy, Brltannlcus — a
bold choice—starring Marguer
ite Jamois.
The second tour, in 1960, fea
tured Le Misanthrope from coast
to coast, then went on to com
plete the first round-the-world
tour of a professional French
troupe since Sarah Bernhardt's
in 1891.
From then on the enthusias
tic public reception and sup-

port from the sponsors estab
lished the North American
tour as an annual undertak
ing, prompting Jean de Ri
fault to found Le Treteau de
Paris "the portable boards of
Paris," as a permanent pro
duction management.
From 1958 to 1968, coast-to
coast tours, all sponsored and
subsidized by the Association
Francaise d'Action Artistique
have totalled 600 performances
before campus audiences of over
550,000 spectators.
Alert to producing plays pro
vocative for the American audi
ences, Jean de Rigault chooses
each season from among classi
cal and modern French play
wrights. The troupe members
are engaged in Paris for each
individual tour. Plays are pre
sented as they are done in
France and the casts, headed by
outstanding actors, read like a
Who's Who of the French
stage.
The inventiveness of each pro
duction is assured by directors
like Nicolas Bataille, Pierre
Franck, Jacques Charon, Yves
Gasc, and is enhanced by design
ers like Jacques Noel, Jean-Den
is Malcles, Andre Levasseur, and
Andre Acquart.
Tartuffe Is probably known
well enough to need no intro
duction.
For those who have never
seen or read it and are hesitant
about the language barrier. I
suggest the bilingual parallel

edition of the text. Translated by
Herr van Laun, it is the first in
a new series—another indication
of the particular popularity of
this play.
In addition (and a golden op
portunity for comparative criti
cism not to be missed by serious
students of the theater as well
as the serious theater-goer) I
recommend a visit to ACTs
TartufTe now playing in reper
tory in San Francisco.
It is one of their most success
ful productions. The next pre
sentations are at 2:00 p.m. to
morrow and 8:30 p.m. April 9.
ACT director William Ball uses
the new Richard Wilbur transla
tion, and while purists may not
agree with the interpretation, I
can promise a thoroughly enter
taining evening of typically
stylistic staging.
Incidentally it is a new cast
from last season when Rene Au
berjonois played an unforgetta
ble title role—so if you saw it
then, go again.
A particularly acclaimed re
cent production was a Brech
tian style TartufTe staged by
Roger Planchon at the Thea
tre de France in 1964. Some
readers will undoubtedly re
member the memorable local
performance in 1965 with
Stanford's own Gerry Hiken
in the title role.
Well, there you are! If you
kicked yourself for missing
Godot and Marceau there's no

excuse for missing Tartuffe
right here on your front door
step.
Curtain time Is 8 p.m. Tickets
at Tresidder or at the door.
Although we might expect
a basic setting with a road
show, I have no hints as to
interpretation. The two lead
ing French approaches are le
sinistra of Louis Jmi vet and
le bon vivant of du Croisy,
the original creator of the
role.
The cast will include Jacques
Sereys, who was for ten years
until 1965 a "societaire of La
Comedie Francaise, played the
lead in the Treteau's 1965 tour
of Feu la Mere de Madanie, by
Feydeau.
Marcelle Ransom has per
formed often with the Theatre
National Populaire, was a mem
ber of La Compagnie Jean-Louis
Barrault, and had a lead in the
1965 production at the Theatre
de France-Odeon of Genet's The
Screens.
She also played Albine in the
1958 pioneering tour of North
America in Racine's Brltannicus.
Giselle Touret will be remem
bered as Arsinoe in the 1960
production of Le Misanthrope.
