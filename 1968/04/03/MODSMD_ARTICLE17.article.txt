# Saroyan, O'Casey Plays Set In Nitery
## 
### 
"A Pair of Aces," two one-act
plays, will have a two-day run
at Stanford Repertory Theater
Friday and Saturday, April 12
and 13.
A project of M.F.A. students
and SRT acting fellows, the dou
ble bill includes Sean O'Casey's
"Pound on Demand" and Wil
liam Saroyan's "Hello Out
There."
Both performances begin at 8
p.m. in The Nitery, located in

the Old Union Building on the
Stanford campus. Tickets are
available at Tresidder Union
Box Office.
Written 20 years ago, "Hello
Out There" deals with the rela
tionship which develops between
an innocent tramp trapped be
hind bars and the young girl
who cooks meals for the inmates
of a small Texas town's lonely
Jail. Through the dialogue there
develops a celebration of the
common man—a drama, ending
in tragedy, about important no
bodies.
Heading the cast are Stephen
D. Newman as the Young Man
and Jennifer Haefele as The
Girl, with Kurtwood Smith as
The Man and Sally Kemp as The
Woman. Director is Ruth Hunt.
"A Pound on Demand," dubbed
by playwright O'Casey as "a
sketch in one act," treats a fa
miliar theme with contemporary
relevance: man against his own
government. In the O'Casey vig
nette, Man, unable to hold his
own against the bureaucracy of
the postal service, is the inevita
ble loser.
