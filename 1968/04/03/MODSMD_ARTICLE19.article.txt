## Students Expect Kennedy Victory 
### 
The comments from Stan
ford students were registered
before President Johnson made
his announcement that he
would not be a candidate for
the presidential election.
The candidacies of Senators
Eugene McCarthy and Robert
Kennedy for the Democratic
nomination for the presidency
have caused much political theo
rizing among Stanford students.
In a recent random opinion poll,
the majority of the students
concluded that they would pre
fer McCarthy, but think Ken
nedy has a better chance of
winning the nomination.
"They are both well needed,"

said senior Bob Loehr. "How
ever, eventually Kennedy will re
ceive most of McCarthy's sup
port. Kennedy is the more dom
inant candidate."
Dominant was about the mild
est word used to describe Ken
nedy. Most students used strong
er terms. Sophomore Bill Ra
ciot felt that "Kennedy has a
better chance than McCarthy,
Johnson, or Nixon of winning.
Kennedy is an opportunist, but
I don't mind since that's the
name of the game. That's poli
tics."
"Kennedy is a ruthless char
acter and an opportunist,"
believes sophomore David

â€¢Johnson. "1 would like to see
McCarthy win but doubt if lie
will get the nomination. I like
his 'Professor' image."
Most vehement about Ken
nedy was junior Anne Gault.
"He is power mad," she ex
claimed. "He is wiser about pub
lic opinion than Johnson but
other than that there would be
little difference with him as
President. Because he was so
hesitant about putting himself
on the line about his candidacy,
I wonder if he would put him
self on the line in other mat
ters."
Not all students jumped to the
conclusion that the nomination
would go to either McCarthy or
Kennedy. Law Student Carol
Zeldon stated that he was afraid
that "both candidates would
stand little chance against John
son if he were to start negotia
tions over Vielnam. People
would then swing to his side
since many are only against his
Vietnam policy but favor his
domestic policy."
While many McCarthy back
ers felt Kennedy would be the
ultimate winner, few had de
cided to change over to active
ly work for Kennedy. One who
did shift his efforts was sopho
more Byron Georgiou. He re
plied that he "was for McCarthy
before Kennedy came out, but
is now behind Kennedy." He
added, "I would rather have
McCarthy because he is a less

slithery character but I have to
be realistic and Kennedy has a
better chance of winning. When
Kennedy made his announce
ment right after the New Hamp
shire primary, I thought he was
a political opportunist, but it
probably was the best way for
him to attack the problem."
There was some student hope
that the two candidates would
combine forces. Said sophomore
Betty Brown Smith, "They
would get together with Ken
nedy as president and McCarthy
as vice-president."
Stanford reaction to the can
didacies of Kennedy and Mc-
Carthy seem to follow closely
the reactions of students
across the nation.
A University of Michigan sur
vey showed that many students
were supporting Kennedy, but
only because it is thought that
he has a better chance of win
ning. Students also indicated
that they had more respect for
McCarthy. Campus Young Dem
ocrats plan to support McCarthy
as long as he stays in the race.
Campus newspapers seem to
be as divided as students. For
example, last Thursday a Michi
gan Daily editorial by Execu
tive Editor David Knoke attack
ed Kennedy as a "cynical oppor
tunist." On Saturday Daily Edit
or Mark Levin wrote an editor

ial saying McCarthy may bo the
bettor man but the expediency
of beating Johnson dictates sup
port for Kennedy. Levin says
the paper is badly split and ex
pects an exchange among the
editors in the editorial columns.
The Crimson at Harvard Uni
versity, of which Kennedy is a
graduate, quickly shifted its sup
port from McCarthy to Kennedy
when the latter announced. But
they remain the only paper to
have done that. Other Ivy Lea
gue papers, such as the Yale
Daily News and The Daily Pen
nsylvanian support McCarthy.
Susie Schmidt, editor of the
University of Colorado Daily,
which supported McCarthy im
mediately after he announced
his candidacy, said Kennedy's
entry may be good because it
will mean more anti-Johnson
delegates at the Democratic con
vention. But she still favors Mc-
Carthy. "I like his ideas better.
Kennedy wants to be President
but McCarthy wants to end the
war."
The editors of the Daily Cali
fornian at the University of
California at Berkeley are re
evaluating their early support of
McCarthy. Editor Mike Kersten
says Kennedy's entry will gen
erate much more enthusiasm
among students about the elec
tion.
