## Pentagon Says Bomb Halt Only North Of 20th Parallel 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Pentagon said Tuesday that
U.S. bombing attacks are being
conducted against North Viet
nam from the 20th parallel
south, but said 90 per cent of the
strikes have been limited to
within 60 miles of the demilitar
ized zone.
This was the first official clar
ification of the extent of the
area which may still be bombed
under President Johnson's order
restricting air and naval gun
fire attacks in a bid to get North
Vietnam to the peace talk table.
It means that Johnson's order
permits wide ranging bombing
assaults along a more than 200-
mile stretch of North Vietnam's
panhandle — a much greater
area than his announcement sug
gested.
The impression left with most
people by Johnson's wording
Sunday night was that the
bombing would be limited to a
relatively few miles above the
DMZ.
But U.S. bombers struck at
points more than 200 miles from
the DMZ subsequent to the
President's order.
• Hanoi Responds
TOKYO (AP) — North Viet
nam's official press was quoted
Tuesday as saying President
Johnson has not agreed to halt
all bombings unconditionally

and is trying to mislead public
opinion.
This seemed an oblique indi
cation that Hanoi is unready to
go to the peace table now de
spite Johnson's order Sunday
curtailing bombing in the North.
Both the Soviet news agency
Tass and Peking radio quoted
the North Vietnamese army
newspaper Quan Doi Nhan Dan
as saying Johnson was trying to
mislead public opinion.
• Anti-Stalinist Dead
TYNEC, Czechoslovakia (AP)
—The body of Czechoslovakia's
top investigator of Stalin era
crimes was found hanging from
an oak tree Tuesday, five days
after he vanished on the heels of
a report charging he served as
judge in a Communist kangaroo
court in 1955.
Police said they were "99 per
cent certain" that Dr. Jozef
Brestansky, 42, deputy president
of the Supreme Court, was a
suicide, but a fellow judge indi
cated he was doubtful consider
ing Brestansky's "strong char
acter."
In Prague, the riptide of po
litical change was still running
high. A key supporter of liberal
ization demanded the resigna
tion of the entire government so
that "no single member of the
new government could be held
in doubt" by the nation.

• Open Housing Hit
SACRAMENTO (AP) — For
the first time, Gov. Reagan de
clared Tuesday that he would
veto legislation repealing the
Rumford open housing law.
Last week's statewide meet
ings with Negro and Mexican-
American leaders left hi m
"greatly surprised to find out
how much a symbol this is in
many areas" of hope for minori
ty groups, the governor told his
weekly news conference.
Any attempt to change the
controversial law, he said, should
"start with modifications rather
than tear down a symbol."
Pressed on whether he would
veto pending legislation to sim
ply wipe the legislation off the
books, the governor replied:
"Yes, I'd have to."
• Priests Quitting
NEW YORK (AP) —At least
711 Roman Catholic clergymen
left the priesthood in the United
States in 1966 and 1967, a sur
vey report said Tuesday. The
Catholic group which made the
survey termed the findings
alarming.
It was the first documented
compilation of current statistics
on the matter in his country.
Assembly by the National As
sociation of Pastoral Renewal,
the report said:
"The departure of priests
from the active ministry in
volves such an alarming num
ber of men as to demand a pub
lic, fully financed study by the
American bishops."
• Tax Bill Passed
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Senate broke the logjam on
President Johnson's long sought
10 per cent income tax surtax
Tuesday—at least temporarily—
by passing an Easter basket bill
loaded with an assortment of
other tax provisions.
Included was a $6-billion fed
eral spending cut and continua
tion of excise tax rates on autos
and telephone service which
technically dropped on Monday.
The measure now goes to a
conference with the House,
which originally passed it pri
marily as an extension of the 7
per cent auto and 10 per cent
telephone taxes. In seven days
of debate the Senate loaded on
18 amendments on other sub
