## Pentagon Says Bomb Halt Only North Of 20th Parallel 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Pentagon said Tuesday that
U.S. bombing attacks are being
conducted against North Viet
nam from the 20th parallel
south, but said 90 per cent of the
strikes have been limited to
within 60 miles of the demilitar
ized zone.
This was the first official clar
ification of the extent of the
area which may still be bombed
under President Johnson's order
restricting air and naval gun
fire attacks in a bid to get North
Vietnam to the peace talk table.
It means that Johnson's order
permits wide ranging bombing
assaults along a more than 200-
mile stretch of North Vietnam's
panhandle — a much greater
area than his announcement sug
gested.
The impression left with most
people by Johnson's wording
Sunday night was that the
bombing would be limited to a
relatively few miles above the
DMZ.
But U.S. bombers struck at
points more than 200 miles from
the DMZ subsequent to the
President's order.
• Hanoi Responds
TOKYO (AP) — North Viet
nam's official press was quoted
Tuesday as saying President
Johnson has not agreed to halt
all bombings unconditionally

and is trying to mislead public
opinion.
This seemed an oblique indi
cation that Hanoi is unready to
go to the peace table now de
spite Johnson's order Sunday
curtailing bombing in the North.
Both the Soviet news agency
Tass and Peking radio quoted
the North Vietnamese army
newspaper Quan Doi Nhan Dan
as saying Johnson was trying to
mislead public opinion.
• Anti-Stalinist Dead
TYNEC, Czechoslovakia (AP)
—The body of Czechoslovakia's
top investigator of Stalin era
crimes was found hanging from
an oak tree Tuesday, five days
after he vanished on the heels of
a report charging he served as
judge in a Communist kangaroo
court in 1955.
Police said they were "99 per
cent certain" that Dr. Jozef
Brestansky, 42, deputy president
of the Supreme Court, was a
suicide, but a fellow judge indi
cated he was doubtful consider
ing Brestansky's "strong char
acter."
In Prague, the riptide of po
litical change was still running
high. A key supporter of liberal
ization demanded the resigna
tion of the entire government so
that "no single member of the
new government could be held
in doubt" by the nation.

• Open Housing Hit
SACRAMENTO (AP) — For
the first time, Gov. Reagan de
clared Tuesday that he would
veto legislation repealing the
Rumford open housing law.
Last week's statewide meet
ings with Negro and Mexican-
American leaders left hi m
"greatly surprised to find out
how much a symbol this is in
many areas" of hope for minori
ty groups, the governor told his
weekly news conference.
Any attempt to change the
controversial law, he said, should
"start with modifications rather
than tear down a symbol."
Pressed on whether he would
veto pending legislation to sim
ply wipe the legislation off the
books, the governor replied:
"Yes, I'd have to."
• Priests Quitting
NEW YORK (AP) —At least
711 Roman Catholic clergymen
left the priesthood in the United
States in 1966 and 1967, a sur
vey report said Tuesday. The
Catholic group which made the
survey termed the findings
alarming.
It was the first documented
compilation of current statistics
on the matter in his country.
Assembly by the National As
sociation of Pastoral Renewal,
the report said:
"The departure of priests
from the active ministry in
volves such an alarming num
ber of men as to demand a pub
lic, fully financed study by the
American bishops."
• Tax Bill Passed
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Senate broke the logjam on
President Johnson's long sought
10 per cent income tax surtax
Tuesday—at least temporarily—
by passing an Easter basket bill
loaded with an assortment of
other tax provisions.
Included was a $6-billion fed
eral spending cut and continua
tion of excise tax rates on autos
and telephone service which
technically dropped on Monday.
The measure now goes to a
conference with the House,
which originally passed it pri
marily as an extension of the 7
per cent auto and 10 per cent
telephone taxes. In seven days
of debate the Senate loaded on
18 amendments on other sub
jects, which caused some mem
bers to label it an "Easter bas
ket bill."
• Political Pressure
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
FBI launched a criminal inves
tigation Monday into allegations
that high-level employes of the
Maritime Administration were
pressured by their boss to con
tribute to a Democratic party
fund-raising dinner.
The investigation was request
ed by the Criminal Division of
the Justice Department, The As
sociated Press learned Tuesday.
A veteran civil servant
charged last week that 79 Mari
time Administration employes
were summoned to a business
hours meeting on federal prop
erty and pressured to contribute
to the dinner.
Such pressure would be a vio
lation of election laws prohibit
ing federal employes from seek
ing political contributions from
other federal employes on feder
al property.
• North Bombed Again
SAIGON (AP) — American
bombers ranged up to 225 miles
north of the demilitarized zone
Tuesday on the second day of
President Johnson's restricted
bombing campaign of North
Vietnam, the U.S. Command
said.
A communique listed the far
thest penetration north as a
strike by carrier-based Navy
planes against a railroad siding
12 miles north-northeast of the
city of Thanh Hoa or about 225
miles north of the DMZ which
divides the two Vietnams.
This strike exceeded the
northernmost raid of Monday
when Navy bombers hit just be
low Thanh Hoa, 209 miles above
the DMZ.
Most of North Vietnam's terri
tory and its most densely popu
lated areas lie north of the 20th
parallel.
• Reagan 6 Flattered'
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Gov.
Reagan said Tuesday he was
surprised and flattered by the
turnout on his behalf in the Wis
consin primary election, but said
it moves him no closer to be

coming a Republican candidate
for President.
"I can't change my position,"
Reagan toid reporters as they
questioned him on his front
lawn in a quite residential area
of Sacramento.
Reagan said he would have
been surprised to get 5 per cent
of the GOP vote in Wisconsin.
Instead he was getting about 11
per cent.
• Humphrey Waiting
WASHINGTON (AP) — A
close associate of Hubert H.
Humphrey said Tuesday the vice
president won't decide whether
to become a presidential candi
date "for a couple of weeks or
more."
"The vice president is going
to take time to appraise his
chances and he is not going to
be hurried," the associate said.
He added that Humphrey, who
was in Mexico on a diplomatic
mission when President Johnson
announced Sunday night that he
would not seek re-election, has
told his staff he "is not a candi
date yet."

Landau, one of the world's lead
ing physicists and winner of the
1962 Nobel Prize for physics,

ment announced Tuesday. He

Landau never returned to re
search after an automobile acci
dent six years ago in which he
suffered brain damage. He re
mained in a hospital for two
years and nine months.
