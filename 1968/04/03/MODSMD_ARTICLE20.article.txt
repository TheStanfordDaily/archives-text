# Researcher Sues For Army Report
## 
### 
What is believed to be the first
citizen's suit seeking to declassi
fy a government document un
der the new Freedom of Infor
mation Act has been filed by
Julius Epstein, research associ
ate at the Hoover Institution,
Stanford University.
Under this act, which became
effective last year, individuals
may petition a federal district
court to obtain a classified docu
ment. The court must decide if
its release would seriously en
danger national defense and se
curity.
Filed this week in the federal
district court, San Francisco, the
suit is the latest step in a 14-
year effort by Epstein to obtain
a U.S. Army report on the
forced repatriation of nearly a
million anti-communist Russian
prisoners and displaced persons
from Germany to the Soviet Un
ion at the end of World War 11.
According to Epstein, about
900,000 anti-communist Russians
who were forced to return to
their homeland were executed or
died in slave camps.
The Army report which he
seeks to declassify was written
in 1948 and is titled, "Operation
Keelhaul"â€”a German and Dutch
term for throwing bound prison
ers beneath a ship's keel and
propellers.

Epstein has been trying to ob
tain a copy since 1954. He told
members of the Senate Internal
Security Subcommittee about
the document's existence in 1956.
but they also were unable to ob
tain it.
"It could be embarrassing to
many people in the Administra
tion, but embarrassment is no
basis for classification," Epstein
says.
He was successful in getting
John Foster Dulles, the late
Secretary of State, to provide
him a note written by Joseph C.
Grew, the late U.S. ambassador
to Japan and Under Secretary of
State, to the Soviet Embassy in
Washington stating that anti
communist Russians who joined
the German Army and fought
in uniform during the closing
days of World War II would
never be forcibly repatriated be
cause they had broken no inter
national law. Grew's superiors
apparently overruled this deci
sion.
Epstein, who fled Germany
when Hitler came to power in
1939, served as an editor with
the Office of War Information
and then became a foreign cor
respondent. He intends to incor
porate "Operation Keelhaul"
into a book he is writing on the
anti-communist Russian repatri
ates.
