# Minorities Favored In Job Placements
## 
### 
Under a new program for
minority employment, the Uni
versity has hired 39 individuals
from minority groups. This ac
counts for about one-fourth of
the job vacancies referred to
the Personnel Office.
Mike Ravizza, the officer pri
marily responsible for minority
employment, calls this "a step
in the right direction," but em
phasizes that "a great deal re
mains to be done before the new
minority employment program
can be considered a success by
either the University or the mi
nority community.
During the first four months
of this new program, 25 Ne
groes, nine Orientals, four Mex
ican-Americans, and one Amer
ican Indian have filled 39 of the
171 vacancies.
The number of minority ap
plicants has increased 30 to 40
per cent during the same four
months. Each applicant receives
a personal interview.
Under the Youth Opportunity
Program, Stanford provides 28
high school students with after
school employment. It also has
committed itself to 75 summer
jobs for high school students
from minority groups.
The University currently is
seeking $25,000 in private sup
port to establish an interim
training program to serve as a
link between existing commu
nity training programs and reg
ular University employment.
Two-thirds of the funds would
go directly to 50 individual par
ticipants in the program.
Stanford is the second largest
employer on the San Francisco
Peninsula. In February, Univer
sity President Wallace Sterling
described Ravizza's appointment
and several related as "active

expressions of (our) commit
ment to fair employment and
(our) responsibilities as a ma
jor employer on the mid-Penin
sula.
"This is a commitment and
a responsibility which each of us
should share," the president told
faculty and staff members. "The
policy is unambiguous, the pro
grams are in motion, the results
can be gratifying to all."
