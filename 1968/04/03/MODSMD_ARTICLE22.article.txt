Stanford's Theater of the Con
gressional Record will present
the 1868 debate in the House of
Representatives on the impeach
ment of President Andrew John
son for high crimes and misde
meanors.
The two performances of this
century-old historic debate will
take place at 8 p.m. Friday and
Saturday, April 12 and 13, in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Curt Keck, a senior history
student, prepared the three-hour
script from the 20-hour debate
as recorded in the Congressional
Globe of 1868. He will also direct
the show. The Speech and Dra
ma Department will sponsor the
production.
The centennial of this contro

by more than 100 students, fac
ulty and staff who will play the
roles of congressmen. The actors
will be costumed in the dress of
the time and Dinkelspiel Audi
torium will be converted into a
replica of the House chamber.
Over the past year, The Thea
ter of the Congressional Record
has reenacted three other de
bates in the Congress: The Dec
laration of War with Germany,
1917, The Conscription Bill o£
1917 and the Sedition Act of
1918.
There will be a general admis
sion charge, with a discount for
students.
