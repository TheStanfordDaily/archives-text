# The 						Inside Track
## When Number Two Beats Number One 
### Gary Cavalli 
The recent rout of Houston in the NCAA semi-finals by a poised
and polished UCLA quintet casts a dark shadow on the 1968 na
tional wire service rankings. On both polls, which ended just before
the NCAA tournament began, Houston retained the now ludicrous
distinction of being the number one basketball team in the
country.
A pertinent question at this juncture would inquire how the
voters in these polls (college coaches, broadcasters and sports
writers) could have been so totally duped as to put Houston ahead
of UCLA.
Undoubtedly the Cougars' upset 71-69 win on January 20 had
a lot to do with it. On that historic evening Elvin Hayes completely
dominated the ballgame and Lew Alcindor, as Houston shattered
UCLA's dream of a second straight undefeated season.
What happened that night was not a case of the number one
team in the country squeaking by the number two team on Hayes'
two free throws with 28 seconds left in the game. It was simply
a matter of a good team catching a great team on a bad night,
a night when Alcindor was literally playing at half strength. The
big guy, hampered by an eye injury sustained against Cal, hit just
4 of 18 shots and was only a shadow of his usual self on the boards.
Failing to see the January 20 game for what it was — a fluke —
the voters on the two wire service polls rated Houston the top
team in the nation. Houston is not the top team in the nation —
not by 32 points.
Both teams went undefeated through the rest of the season, earn
ing the right to meet in a much-anticipated remath in the NCAA
semi-finals. But perhaps Houston's path to that March 22 meeting
was too smooth. Perhaps the Cougars were buoyed up by a sche
dule of soft touches.
The names of schools like Fairfield, West Texas State, Hardin-
Simmons, Virginia Tech, Valparaiso, Texas at Arlington, and Cen
tenary do not exactly inspire cold fear into the hearts of most col
lege coaches. And despite actually having trouble beating some
of these unheard-of ballclubs, Houston held on to the country's
number one ranking.
UCLA meanwhile ,had to topple such strong opponents as USC,
Washington State, New Mexico State and Santa Clara to make
the NCAA's final foursome.
Alcindor and company found out how sweet revenge can be by
totally devastating the Cougars by 32 points, 101-69, in that semi
final encounter. The next night Ohio State, an unranked Cinderella
team, added insult to injury by upending the mighty Cougars
89-95.
To complete the humiliation of the pollsters (who by now were
searching for a nice place to hide), previously unbeaten, number
three ranked St. Bonaventure lost both games played in NCAA
tournament competition. The Bonnies provided another example
of a good team taking advantage of an easy schedule to achieve
national recognition.
Perhaps Stanford coach Howie Dallmar put it best when he ex
plained his objection to national basketball rankings early in the
season, even before the first Houston-UCLA titanic.
"I can't see how UCLA is ranked first," Dallmar said. "They
should be fourth — right behind Philadelphia, San Francisco and
Boston." He may have had a point.

team in the country squeaking by the number two team on Hayes'
two free throws with 28 seconds left in the game. It was simply
a matter of a good team catching a great team on a bad night,
a night when Alcindor was literally playing at half strength. The
big guy, hampered by an eye injury sustained against Cal, hit just
4 of 18 shots and was only a shadow of his usual self on the boards.
Failing to see the January 20 game for what it was — a fluke —
the voters on the two wire service polls rated Houston the top
team in the nation. Houston is not the top team in the nation —
not by 32 points.
Both teams went undefeated through the rest of the season, earn
ing the right to meet in a much-anticipated remath in the NCAA
semi-finals. But perhaps Houston's path to that March 22 meeting
was too smooth. Perhaps the Cougars were buoyed up by a sche
dule of soft touches.
The names of schools like Fairfield, West Texas State, Hardin-
Simmons, Virginia Tech, Valparaiso, Texas at Arlington, and Cen
tenary do not exactly inspire cold fear into the hearts of most col
lege coaches. And despite actually having trouble beating some
of these unheard-of ballclubs, Houston held on to the country's
number one ranking.
UCLA meanwhile ,had to topple such strong opponents as USC,
Washington State, New Mexico State and Santa Clara to make
the NCAA's final foursome.
Alcindor and company found out how sweet revenge can be by
totally devastating the Cougars by 32 points, 101-69, in that semi
final encounter. The next night Ohio State, an unranked Cinderella
team, added insult to injury by upending the mighty Cougars
89-95.
To complete the humiliation of the pollsters (who by now were
searching for a nice place to hide), previously unbeaten, number
three ranked St. Bonaventure lost both games played in NCAA
tournament competition. The Bonnies provided another example
of a good team taking advantage of an easy schedule to achieve
national recognition.
Perhaps Stanford coach Howie Dallmar put it best when he ex
plained his objection to national basketball rankings early in the
season, even before the first Houston-UCLA titanic.
"I can't see how UCLA is ranked first," Dallmar said. "They
should be fourth — right behind Philadelphia, San Francisco and
Boston." He may have had a point.
The recent rout of Houston in the NCAA semi-finals by a poised
and polished UCLA quintet casts a dark shadow on the 1968 na
tional wire service rankings. On both polls, which ended just before
the NCAA tournament began, Houston retained the now ludicrous
distinction of being the number one basketball team in the
country.
A pertinent question at this juncture would inquire how the
voters in these polls (college coaches, broadcasters and sports
writers) could have been so totally duped as to put Houston ahead
of UCLA.
Undoubtedly the Cougars' upset 71-69 win on January 20 had
a lot to do with it. On that historic evening Elvin Hayes completely
dominated the ballgame and Lew Alcindor, as Houston shattered
UCLA's dream of a second straight undefeated season.
What happened that night was not a case of the number one
team in the country squeaking by the number two team on Hayes'
two free throws with 28 seconds left in the game. It was simply
