# Lacrosse Team Opens With Impressive Wins
## 
### 
Stanford's lacrosse team,
fresh out of finals, Logan their
drive to regain the number one
ranking in the West by crush
ing Utah 110 March 21, and
took the first step in defending
their Northern California La
crosse Association champion
ship by storming past the Marin
County Lacrosse Club 104.
It was the third game of the
season for the Utah outfit, while
exams had deprived the Indians
of two weeks of practice before
this initial outing. But after
a sloppy first quarter in which
Stanford scored one fluke goal
by attackman George Muser,
the Indians were unstoppable.
Stanford poured in three goals
in the second quarter, four in
the third, and three more in the
fourth.
The hapless Utah team,
meanwhile, could not get on
the scoreboard. The conting
ent had averaged seven goals
a game prior to the Stanford
contest, but came up against
what most observers feel to
be the best defense the league
has seen.
Even without the services of
rugby players Wade Killefer
and Nat Benchly, the Tribe de
fense of Bill Eakland, Denny Mc-
Neely, and Buc Wales kept the
Utah attack at bay.
Leading the Stanford scoring
was Stu Childs, who turned a
hat trick and assisted on two
other goals. Fellow midfielder
Dirk Speas scored two golas and
an assist.
In Sunxlay's game against
Marin at Strawberry Point,
the Indians started fast with
three goals in the first quar

ter but turned ragged towards
the end In the cold wind.
Speas contributed four big
goals to the Indian effort,
while Bob Hawkins got his
wing In shape and steamed in
three. Muser contributed four
assists from his attack posi
tion.

Aside from the promising
work of the defense, the high
light of the Stanford perform
ance in the two opening games
was the scoring punch of the
second midfield of Speas, John
Hartley, and Childs, who poured
in eleven goals, much to the
chagrin of the first midfleld.
The first two games seemed
to indicate that not only do the
Indians have an excellent de
fense, but they can also score
themselves.
