# Arrests Called Illegal
## Pot Trial Postponed 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
The preliminary hearing in
the case of two Stanford stu
dents charged with possession of
marijuana has been postponed
pending the judge's decision on
the legality of the arrest, made
by a Stanford policeman.
William Keogh, lawyer for
David Menasian and Eric Miller,
both members of Breakers Eat
ing Club, claimed that the club,
where the two were arrested
early on the morning of March
15, is a private building.
In this case, under Califor
nia law, the officer, George
Bruschi, would allegedly have
been required to state to those
inside that he wanted to enter
and his reasons for doing so
before coming in to make an
arrest.
At yesterday's hearing, Bru
schi stated he had merely open

ed the door and walked in, after
seeing Menasian pass a tin foil
pipe to Miller while he was mak
ing his usual rounds.
Municipal Court Judge Paul
I. Meyers gave Keogh until
April 30 to submit a memoran
dum on the subject. The district
attorney's office, represented
yesterday by Thomas Hanford,
will have a week to reply.
The hearing is scheduled to
resume on May 9 at 2 p.m.
Keogh also charged that
Bruschi had "no reasonable
cause" to enter the eating
club, stating that passing a
pipe to someone else was not
a crime.
"We still have privacy in this
country — I think," Keogh com
mented during a recess.
There was also some doubt as
to the exact status of the patrol
man: whether he is legally a

peace officer or a private citizen.
Both lawyers were willing to
accept Bruschi as a legitimate
policeman, but he said that he
was only a private patrolman.
"We are not full-fledged peace
officers," he stated.
The statute which Keogh
cited, section 844 of the Cali
fornia Penal Code would apply
in either case, however.
The law applies to peace of
ficers for all arrests, and to
private citizens making arrests
for felonies.
Possession of marijuana is a
felony.
"I don't care whether he was
a police officer or a private citi
zen," Keogh commented. "He
had no right to go in there."
The lawyer for the two stu
dents called Edward E. Shaw,
general manager of the eating
clubs, as a witness to testify
that the clubs are private prop
erty.
Shaw said that Stanford
had erected the buildings in
1951 and then leased them to
the Inter-Cluh Council, now
the Stanford Eating Clubs
(SEC), representative of the
seven groups.
He also noted that the SEC
was a private student coopera
tive association, and that the
only people allowed in them
were eating club members and
their guests.
Shaw said the clubs should be
considered private buildings, "in
the same sense as a fraternity
house."
The police had not been ask
ed to enter the club the night of
the arrest, he said. The last time
they were requested to watch

the clubs was last summer, when
no one was supposed to be in
them after 7:30 p.m.
Bruschi said that the only
reason he goes into the clubs
is that "we always have" done
it.
He noted that he had never
received written instructions to
enter the buildings, nor had he
been told to do so by a superior.
Bruschi testified that his pred
ecessor on that beat had told
him when he was breaking him
in that checking and entering
the clubs was part of his job.
Bruschi has worked for Stan
ford for four months.
Keogh does not presently plan
to call Stanford administrators
as witnesses to explain the sta
tus of the clubs and the patrol
men when the hearing resumes.

"We still have privacy in this
country — I think," Keogh com
mented during a recess.
There was also some doubt as
to the exact status of the patrol
man: whether he is legally a

peace officer or a private citizen.
Both lawyers were willing to
accept Bruschi as a legitimate
policeman, but he said that he
was only a private patrolman.
"We are not full-fledged peace
officers," he stated.
The statute which Keogh
cited, section 844 of the Cali
fornia Penal Code would apply
in either case, however.
The law applies to peace of
ficers for all arrests, and to
private citizens making arrests
for felonies.
Possession of marijuana is a
felony.
"I don't care whether he was
a police officer or a private citi
zen," Keogh commented. "He
had no right to go in there."
The lawyer for the two stu
dents called Edward E. Shaw,
general manager of the eating
clubs, as a witness to testify
that the clubs are private prop
erty.
Shaw said that Stanford
had erected the buildings in
1951 and then leased them to
the Inter-Cluh Council, now
the Stanford Eating Clubs
(SEC), representative of the
seven groups.
He also noted that the SEC
was a private student coopera
tive association, and that the
only people allowed in them
were eating club members and
their guests.
Shaw said the clubs should be
considered private buildings, "in
the same sense as a fraternity
house."
The police had not been ask
ed to enter the club the night of
the arrest, he said. The last time
they were requested to watch

the clubs was last summer, when
no one was supposed to be in
them after 7:30 p.m.
Bruschi said that the only
reason he goes into the clubs
is that "we always have" done
it.
He noted that he had never
received written instructions to
enter the buildings, nor had he
been told to do so by a superior.
Bruschi testified that his pred
ecessor on that beat had told
him when he was breaking him
in that checking and entering
the clubs was part of his job.
Bruschi has worked for Stan
ford for four months.
Keogh does not presently plan
to call Stanford administrators
as witnesses to explain the sta
tus of the clubs and the patrol
men when the hearing resumes.

The preliminary hearing in
the case of two Stanford stu
dents charged with possession of
marijuana has been postponed
pending the judge's decision on
the legality of the arrest, made
by a Stanford policeman.
William Keogh, lawyer for
David Menasian and Eric Miller,
both members of Breakers Eat
ing Club, claimed that the club,
where the two were arrested
early on the morning of March
15, is a private building.
In this case, under Califor
nia law, the officer, George
Bruschi, would allegedly have
been required to state to those
inside that he wanted to enter
and his reasons for doing so
before coming in to make an
arrest.
At yesterday's hearing, Bru
schi stated he had merely open

ed the door and walked in, after
seeing Menasian pass a tin foil
pipe to Miller while he was mak
ing his usual rounds.
Municipal Court Judge Paul
I. Meyers gave Keogh until
April 30 to submit a memoran
dum on the subject. The district
attorney's office, represented
yesterday by Thomas Hanford,
will have a week to reply.
The hearing is scheduled to
resume on May 9 at 2 p.m.
Keogh also charged that
Bruschi had "no reasonable
cause" to enter the eating
club, stating that passing a
pipe to someone else was not
a crime.
