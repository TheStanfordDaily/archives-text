MILWAUKEE, Wis. (AP) â€”
Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy, D-
Minn., rode the anti-Vietnam
war issue to a clear-cut victory
over retiring President Johnson
in a prestige-building torrent of
votes in Tuesday's Wisconsin
presidential primary.
Holding steadily at 55 per cent
of the Democratic total as re
turns mounted, McCarthy won
the bulk of the state's 59-vote
convention delegation to retain
his place as a front runner for
the nomination Johnson said he
didn't want.
A heavy turnout of Repub

licans Indicated that former
Vice President Richard M.
Nixon might top the 339,393
votes he got in the 1960 Wis
consin primary.
In that year, when he won the
party nomination he was unop
posed. In Tuesday's countdown,
he had only nominal opposition
from Gov. Ronald Reagan of
California and perennial candi
date Harold E. Stassen.
With 1,844 of 3.291 precincts
counted in the Democratic pri
mary, McCarthy had 289,658
votes, or 55 per cent of the party
total; Johnson had 195,280, for
37 per cent.
In the Republican balloting,
with 1,831 precincts counted,
Nixon had 267,590 or 80 per
cent; California Gov. Ronald
Reagan 35,894 or 11 per cent.
Stassen 19,348, or 6 per cent.
The mounting total for
Nixon indicated that few Re
publicans took advantage of
the opportunity offered Wis
consin voters to choose either
ballot and cross over the line.
McCarthy forecast at a news
conference that he would wind
up with 55 per cent of the vote.
He said he considered it "a
most, significant victory."
The Minnesota senator said

he was sorry that Johnson "did
not stay in down the home
stretch." He said he thinks he
would have benefitted from a
GOP crossover if the President,
whose name remained on the
ballot, had not said he would not
be a candidate.
In New York, Nixon said that
the size of his vote "is a cer
tain sign the state will go Re
publican in November." He car
ried it in 1960.
"The tide that begun to
flow in New Hampshire con
tinues to flow tonight," he
said. "If current trends hold
up we will receive the same
80 per cent of the vote we won
in New Hampshire."
Nixon's showing brought Gov.
Warren P. Knowles promptly
into the former vice president's
camp. Knowles had remained
neutral in the campaign.
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-
N.Y., currently McCarthy's
chief rival for the nomination,
got about 5 per cent of the Dem
ocratic vote on write-ins. In
Philadelphia he congratulated
McCarthy for "an outstanding
job of presenting the issues."
Kennedy said the Wisconsin
vote showed that "there is a
good deal of opposition" to

Johnson's war course. He added
that he thought the Minnesota
senator benefitted "a great
deal" from Johnson's exit from
competition.
Although both McCarthy
and Kennedy have been high
ly critical of the President's
Asian policies, they stopped
short of advocating any abrupt
American withdrawal.
A referendum on the ballot in
Madison, where war criticism
has been hottest, called for an
immediate cease fire and an
American withdrawal. It appar
ently was defeated.
In the final days of campaign
ing, McCarthy bore down on the
civil rights issue, particularly
with proposals for open housing.
But Milwaukee Mayor Henry
Maier, who called in the Nation
al Guard to choke off a riot last
August, was re-elected to a third
four-year term with a towering
margin of nearly 90 per cent of
the votes.
Johnson hung on to two con
gressional districts in Milwau
kee and thus seemed likely to
collect eight convention dele
gates from those. McCarthy
claimed all of the remainder of
the 59-vote delegation, except


Sen. EUGENE MCCARTHY
for the two national committee
members who go uninstructed.
The President presumably
could ask them to support
some active candidate. This
could mean a pickup for Vice
President Hubert H. Hum
phrey, hovering on the verge
of candidacy.
Humphrey got some scattered
write-in votes in the primary
without any campaign having
been conducted for him.
Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of
New York, who has declined to
become an active candidate but
who has said he would accept a
draft, was getting around 1 per
cent of the GOP vote on a
write-in.
Humphrey said in New York
he has not decided whether to
run for president. "I'll let you
know when I do," he said.
In Minneapolis, prominent
Democrats organized a move
ment to back Humphrey for the
Democratic nomination. Dr.
William Kubicek, secretary of
the Democratic Farmer - Labor
Party, said a state-wide volun
teer committee was being
formed.
lowa Gov. Harold Hughes in
vited the nation's Democratic
governors to an April 15 meet
ing in St. Louis to discuss "re
cent political events."
At stake in the final outcome
was McCarthy's position as a
challenger for the party nomi
nation. Nixon's supporters were
aiming to exceed the 29 per cent
of the two-party total he got
running unopposed in the 1960
primary to bolster his image as
a vote-getter.
