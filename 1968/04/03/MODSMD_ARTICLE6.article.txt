# Whitaker Attacks 'Obsession For Present' In Humanities
## 
### 
Virgil Whitaker, dean of grad
uate studies, outlined the prob
lems facing the humanities in
the coming decades and called
for an end to their "obsession
for the present."
His speech, "Values and the
Humanities," marked the first
lecture in Century 21's spring
program in Tresidder.
Dean Whitaker began by sug
gesting that "any professor of
humanities today is being pulled
in three directions. First of all,
there is the intellectual tradi
tion." This means that the pro
fessor's duty is "to discover and
publish the truth.
"However, this process often
degenerates into 'publish or
perish.' " But he noted hopefully
that "they love books more Than
ever."
Secondly he noted the trend

of / humanities professors to
wards becoming critics-at-large.
He admitted that there is "noth
ing inherently wrong with it,"
but the "excessive preoccupa
tion with the contemporary of
ten leads to the essentially triv
ial."
He said that the English de
partment's courses in contempo
rary literature had greatly in
creased since his days as a stu
dent in the 20's. He feared that
there was "too much second
rate literature and not enough
of the enduring classics."
Thirdly, he lauded the efforts
of the professors to make their
teachings "relate to the world
around them." Whitaker said it
was "in the great tradition of
the humanities" that the profes
sors attempt to apply their stud
ies to the conditions around
them.

Dean Whitaker then discussed
what he regarded as the real
weakness in the humanities: the
field is "dominated by attempts
to emulate natural science's
methodology." It seeks the
"modern and contemporary in
preference to the past."
Whitaker said the humanities
were, after all, "historical. They
exist to provide a continuing
record." Unfortunately, he said
that "they too are caught up In
an obsession for the present."
He pointed out that while
many of the medieval scientists
were wrong, men like Shakes
peare are important. The clas
sics are suffering from a "loss
of relevance." He stressed that
"human nature has not
changed." The wisdom of the
humanities often "gets lost in
the concern with technique."
