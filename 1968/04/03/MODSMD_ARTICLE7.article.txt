# Stanford Village
## Old Houses Finally Going 
### CICELY BATES 
Three miles from Quad in the
renovated Dibble General Army
Hospital lie the remains of
what has been called Stanford's
"intellectual slum." Now the re
mains are to be swept away by
August 31, 1968, to make room
for the expanding Stanford Re
search Institute (SRI) and the
city of Menlo Park. The place
Stanford Village.
The village was originally
created for single men and wo
men and married students, all
World War II veterans. In the
beginning, which was 1946,
there were 300 apartments and
rooms for about 2000 people.
The apartments were created by
partitioning the wards and add
ing doors.
At present, the housing is
for married students only,
and there are only 102 apart
ments left since a phase-out
program has been in effect
since September 1965. Sine©
1952, the village has been open
to non-veterans.
Stanford Villiage received its
name from a Daily contest in
1946. The name was chosen over
such entries as Last Resort and
Branburdan (a combination of
Branner, Wilbur, and Jordan.)
During its existence, the Vil
lage was like a separate, but
thriving community. Frederic O.
Glover, then director of infor
mation, now executive assistant
to the president, announced that
by October of the village's first
year in existence, it had a groc
ery, butcher shop, post office,
baby clinic, laundry, and bowl
ing alley. Today many villagers
still feel themselves to be a
separate entity.
Rents were originally set by
the Federal Public Housing Au
thority (FPHA), the agency
which helped convert the hos
pital into apartments.
Rents ranged from $30 to
$60, and at the time, criticisms
were heard saying that the

rentals were too high for vet
eran's incomes. Now the rents
range from $46 to $65 for the
remaining apartments which
are largely unfurnished.
The original terms between
Stanford and the FPHA stated
that Stanford should use the vil
lage to house students only un
til "two years after the end of
the war (housing) emergency."
However it was agreed to ex
tend the period if a emergency
housing need still existed after
this period.
Such an emergency seemrd to
exist, for even when Escondido
Village was opened in August
1959, there was about a nine
month waiting for either vil
lage. Only now with the August
closing does the University ex
pect to have its first vacancies
in the village.

Semi-permanent stucco with a
life span of about 20 years was
the original material used in
constructing the hospital which
became the village. Original con
struction was 1943-44 so the vil
lage has already surpassed its
life expectancy by four years.
Aesthic quality is not one of
the village's assets. Today the
buildings appear that nothing
but the high community siprit
is keeping them together.
This spirit had always been
a big feature of the Village.
Exemplifying this spirit was
the publication of a cookbook
last year featuring foreign
foods that can be prepared
with inexj»ensive cuts of meat.
Because many of the students
don't have that much money,
the lack is also a binding factor
maintains Mrs. Helen Meyer,

Executive Secretary for Mar
ried Student Housing.
Although the resident will be
given first priority to get into
the higher priced Escondido Vil
lage, the money factor may keep
many families from taking ad
vantage of Stanford's remaining
married students housing pro
gram.
When, in 1965, it was an
nounced to the residents the vil
lage was headed toward extinc
tion, objections were raised, but
now residents seems to be tak
ing the decision quietly.
SRI will receive the biggest
share of the remaining land. The
institute has been buying up par
cels of land since 1961. Menlo
Park will use its smaller portion
to house sanitary district offices
and as a service center for the
street department.

partitioning the wards and add
ing doors.
At present, the housing is
for married students only,
and there are only 102 apart
ments left since a phase-out
program has been in effect
since September 1965. Sine©
1952, the village has been open
to non-veterans.
Stanford Villiage received its
name from a Daily contest in
1946. The name was chosen over
such entries as Last Resort and
Branburdan (a combination of
Branner, Wilbur, and Jordan.)
During its existence, the Vil
lage was like a separate, but
thriving community. Frederic O.
Glover, then director of infor
mation, now executive assistant
to the president, announced that
by October of the village's first
year in existence, it had a groc
ery, butcher shop, post office,
baby clinic, laundry, and bowl
ing alley. Today many villagers
still feel themselves to be a
separate entity.
Rents were originally set by
the Federal Public Housing Au
thority (FPHA), the agency
which helped convert the hos
pital into apartments.
Rents ranged from $30 to
$60, and at the time, criticisms
were heard saying that the

rentals were too high for vet
eran's incomes. Now the rents
range from $46 to $65 for the
remaining apartments which
are largely unfurnished.
The original terms between
Stanford and the FPHA stated
that Stanford should use the vil
lage to house students only un
til "two years after the end of
the war (housing) emergency."
However it was agreed to ex
tend the period if a emergency
housing need still existed after
this period.
Such an emergency seemrd to
exist, for even when Escondido
Village was opened in August
1959, there was about a nine
month waiting for either vil
lage. Only now with the August
closing does the University ex
pect to have its first vacancies
in the village.

Semi-permanent stucco with a
life span of about 20 years was
the original material used in
constructing the hospital which
became the village. Original con
struction was 1943-44 so the vil
lage has already surpassed its
life expectancy by four years.
Aesthic quality is not one of
the village's assets. Today the
buildings appear that nothing
but the high community siprit
is keeping them together.
This spirit had always been
a big feature of the Village.
Exemplifying this spirit was
the publication of a cookbook
last year featuring foreign
foods that can be prepared
with inexj»ensive cuts of meat.
Because many of the students
don't have that much money,
the lack is also a binding factor
maintains Mrs. Helen Meyer,

Executive Secretary for Mar
ried Student Housing.
Although the resident will be
given first priority to get into
the higher priced Escondido Vil
lage, the money factor may keep
many families from taking ad
vantage of Stanford's remaining
married students housing pro
gram.
When, in 1965, it was an
nounced to the residents the vil
lage was headed toward extinc
tion, objections were raised, but
now residents seems to be tak
ing the decision quietly.
SRI will receive the biggest
share of the remaining land. The
institute has been buying up par
cels of land since 1961. Menlo
Park will use its smaller portion
to house sanitary district offices
and as a service center for the
street department.

Glover, then director of infor
mation, now executive assistant
to the president, announced that
by October of the village's first
year in existence, it had a groc
ery, butcher shop, post office,
baby clinic, laundry, and bowl
ing alley. Today many villagers
still feel themselves to be a
separate entity.
Rents were originally set by
the Federal Public Housing Au
thority (FPHA), the agency
which helped convert the hos
pital into apartments.
Rents ranged from $30 to
$60, and at the time, criticisms
were heard saying that the

rentals were too high for vet
eran's incomes. Now the rents
range from $46 to $65 for the
remaining apartments which
are largely unfurnished.
The original terms between
Stanford and the FPHA stated
that Stanford should use the vil
lage to house students only un
til "two years after the end of
the war (housing) emergency."
However it was agreed to ex
tend the period if a emergency
housing need still existed after
this period.
Such an emergency seemrd to
exist, for even when Escondido
Village was opened in August
1959, there was about a nine
month waiting for either vil
lage. Only now with the August
closing does the University ex
pect to have its first vacancies
in the village.

Semi-permanent stucco with a
life span of about 20 years was
the original material used in
constructing the hospital which
became the village. Original con
struction was 1943-44 so the vil
lage has already surpassed its
life expectancy by four years.
Aesthic quality is not one of
the village's assets. Today the
buildings appear that nothing
but the high community siprit
is keeping them together.
This spirit had always been
a big feature of the Village.
Exemplifying this spirit was
the publication of a cookbook
last year featuring foreign
foods that can be prepared
with inexj»ensive cuts of meat.
Because many of the students
don't have that much money,
the lack is also a binding factor
maintains Mrs. Helen Meyer,

Executive Secretary for Mar
ried Student Housing.
Although the resident will be
given first priority to get into
the higher priced Escondido Vil
lage, the money factor may keep
many families from taking ad
vantage of Stanford's remaining
married students housing pro
gram.
When, in 1965, it was an
nounced to the residents the vil
lage was headed toward extinc
tion, objections were raised, but
now residents seems to be tak
ing the decision quietly.
SRI will receive the biggest
share of the remaining land. The
institute has been buying up par
cels of land since 1961. Menlo
Park will use its smaller portion
to house sanitary district offices
and as a service center for the
street department.

LONG OBSOLETE — The last remnants of the Stanford Village fttand forlornly awaiting: their
end. Due to be destroyed in August, the village has been housing students since the close of World
War II when it was created out of an old army hospital.
