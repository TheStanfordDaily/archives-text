# Letters To The Editor
## Posters Attacked 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
On Registration Day, the day
after the world was astounded
by the actions of a great Amer
ican, our campus was disgraced
by the cowardly actions of a
few subversive children.
They spread their propaganda
and their ignorance on cheap,
ill-designed posters advocating
the IMPEACHMENT of our
President!!
I am positively outraged at
the immature, illogical, un-Amer
ican minds that could advocate
such an abortion of justice.
Our President has shown re
peatedly that he places the se
curity of our country, and of all
the world, above self. His recent
actions leave no doubt as to the
generous character of this man.
Impeach President Johnson?
God forbid! We should reelect
him.

(Note: The posters referred
to by Mr. Kelly publicized the
program April 12 and 13 of the
Theater of The Congressional
Record, "The Impeachment of
President Johnson" — in 1868.)
Esalen Isn't Cure
For Poor Nutrition
Editor, The Daily:
May I share a few initial im
pressions concerning the widely
publicized Esalen program?
Macrobiotic meals are highly
unbalanced and do not fulfill nu
tritional requirements minimal
ly.
Psychodrama is a very inter
esting, exciting cathartic experi
ence . . . the programs could be
stimulating for the well-balanc
ed, objective person; they could
further unbalance the person
with identity problems.
Many participants must be
people in search of answers —
that they must go to the exotic
Zen — but will be left confused

in our society, as they would be
also among the Buddhists!
MUNIBARASH
U.S. Should Draft
Women For Vietnam
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Nguyan Van Thieu is re
ported to have declared the ur
gent need for more American
troops if the war in Vietnam
is to be brought to a speedier
end. Although the U.S. has a
technical call-up potential of
over 3 million men, to increase
the present quantity of those
serving in Vietnam calls, we are
told, for a dangerous authori
tarianism: just think, American
graduate schools might suffer
a diminishing enrollment. . . .
But what about women, tra
ditionally the more conservative
and die-hard element of an af
fllent society? Why has it not
occurred to the Pentagon to use
female soldiers? Such a prac
tice could offer enormous poli
tical and psychological advant
ages: the enemy, even though
he fights dirty and breaks lunar
truces, still might be reluctant
to commit atrocities and terror
ism (i.e. 'fight') against wom
en.
The female soldier would also
enjoy a certain immunity on
search - and - destroy missions
through villages filled with sad
children and widowed wives; be
ing smaller and slimmer than
men they would present rela
tively harder targets to snipers
and grenadiers; being desirable
they would content the male
draftee and make him happier
to defeat the enemy's effort to
stop the war; being maternal
they could alleviate the lot of
the American wounded and dy
ing; exceptionally beautiful ones
could be sent on highly sensi
tive intelligence missions behind
Vietnamese lines. . . .
