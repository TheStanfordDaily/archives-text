# Stanford's Big Dish Receives Possible Outer Space Reply

### 
Mysteriously regular and
powerful signals from space
that are causing radio astrono
mers to wonder if they could be
from another civilization have
been picked up by radio engi
neers operating the big 150-foot
dish antenna at the Stanford
Center for Radar Astronomy.
The center is a cooperative
research facility of Stanford's
Radioscience Laboratory and the
Stanford Research Institute,
which built the big dish on the
hills behind the campus.
The signals were initially re
ceived at Stanford about a week
ago. It was the first time a ra
dio observatory in North Amer
ica has been able to receive the
signals, senior research engi
nere H. Taylor Howard believes.
(The National Radio Observa
tory at Green Bank, W. Va., has
just reported picking up the sig
nals, also.)
Edward K. Conklin, a grad
uate student from Farming
ton, Conn., carried out the ex
periment in collaboration with
Howard.
The signals were discovered
recently by British radio astro
nomers at Cambridge, England.
The 1000-foot dish operated by
Cornell University at Arecibo,
Puerto Rico, later verified them.

Engineers at the Stanford cen
ter, keeping in touch with both
these observatories were able
to locate the signals from infor
mation furnished by Arecibo.
The source appears to be in the
Milky Way, between the stars
Vega and Altair. They estimate
it to be about 180 light years
away.
After more than a week of
painstaking trials and adjust
ments, Howard reported the
Stanford group has received the
signals several times during the
pre-dawn hours between 3-6 a.m.
The feat is impressive con
sidering the center's "noisy"
location on the San Francisco
Peninsula surrounded by ra
dio, television, aircraft and
amateur transmitters radiat
ing signals in the same fre
quencies as those from space.
The Stanford engineers picked
up the signals on a frequency
of 112.8 megacycles in th» air
craft navigation band. They
came in short pulses of one
tenth second each. They were
spaced exactly 1.337 seconds a
part, as previously reported, and
were heard over periods of 10-
20 minutes at a time.
Extremely weak, fading, and
of approximately the same
strength as the background ra

dio noise, the signals were too
weak to actually hear but were
recorded visually on paper tape.
Three other sources of sig
nals with similar characteristics
have been spotted by the Cam
bridge and Arecibo astronomers.
To imaginative scientists this
suggests the possibility of an
inter - galactic communications
network among different civili
zations. The Stanford group has
just received the needed infor
mation about these sources and
plans to extend its observations
to include them as well.
British radio astronomers
have suggested a natural
source of the signals might
be a neutron star — burned
out and collapsed in upon it
self to an incredible density.
Such a star would be quite
small compared to its mass
and energy, but it still exists
only in theory — none has yet
been discovered.
The time of receiving the new
observations does not interfere
with the regular research pro
grams being pursued with th«
150-foot dish, fortunately. It is
currently engaged in experi
ments with th-' Pioneer space
craft which are orbiting the sun,
and in radar mapping of the
moon.

nals with similar characteristics
have been spotted by the Cam

To imaginative scientists this
suggests the possibility of an

to include them as well.
British radio astronomers
have suggested a natural
source of the signals might
be a neutron star — burned
out and collapsed in upon it

Such a star would be quite
small compared to its mass

only in theory — none has yet
been discovered.
The time of receiving the new

BIG SCOOP — The 150-foot dish antenna at Stanford ('enter for Radar Astronomy, shown
here ready for action, has been credited with verifying signals believed to be from another civiliza
tion.
Mysteriously regular and
powerful signals from space
that are causing radio astrono
mers to wonder if they could be
from another civilization have
been picked up by radio engi
neers operating the big 150-foot
dish antenna at the Stanford
Center for Radar Astronomy.
The center is a cooperative
research facility of Stanford's
Radioscience Laboratory and the
Stanford Research Institute,
which built the big dish on the
hills behind the campus.
The signals were initially re
ceived at Stanford about a week
ago. It was the first time a ra
dio observatory in North Amer
ica has been able to receive the
signals, senior research engi
nere H. Taylor Howard believes.
(The National Radio Observa
tory at Green Bank, W. Va., has
just reported picking up the sig
nals, also.)
Edward K. Conklin, a grad
uate student from Farming
ton, Conn., carried out the ex
periment in collaboration with
Howard.
The signals were discovered
recently by British radio astro
nomers at Cambridge, England.
The 1000-foot dish operated by
Cornell University at Arecibo,
Puerto Rico, later verified them.

Engineers at the Stanford cen
ter, keeping in touch with both
these observatories were able
to locate the signals from infor
mation furnished by Arecibo.
The source appears to be in the
Milky Way, between the stars
Vega and Altair. They estimate
it to be about 180 light years
away.
After more than a week of
painstaking trials and adjust
ments, Howard reported the
Stanford group has received the
signals several times during the
pre-dawn hours between 3-6 a.m.
The feat is impressive con
sidering the center's "noisy"
location on the San Francisco
Peninsula surrounded by ra
dio, television, aircraft and
amateur transmitters radiat
ing signals in the same fre
quencies as those from space.
The Stanford engineers picked
up the signals on a frequency
of 112.8 megacycles in th» air
craft navigation band. They
came in short pulses of one
tenth second each. They were
spaced exactly 1.337 seconds a
part, as previously reported, and
were heard over periods of 10-
20 minutes at a time.
Extremely weak, fading, and
of approximately the same
strength as the background ra

dio noise, the signals were too
weak to actually hear but were
recorded visually on paper tape.
