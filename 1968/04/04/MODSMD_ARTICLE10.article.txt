# Two Minutes of Haight
## Spring Circuits Are Jammed 
### Tim Haight 
It rained Spring Reg Day
morning. How odd. Was it be
cause Lyndon Johnson wasn't
running for President?
The week is immortal. Pretty
girls in short, bright dresses
walking to class. Organizations
soliciting, soliciting. Buttons
sold and worn — Free Huey,
CRE, the Resistance. This be
ing an election year, some but
tons are free.
The Stanford spring, pack
aged by the Board of Trustees
and delivered by God in lazy,
hazy, golden sunshine. The re
laxation of the beginning of the
quarter. The existential defini
tion of the term "clean slate."
Ah.
And in this Eden, albeit full
of asphalt, everybody is talking
about Lyndon Johnson. Wow,
he's going to do a Roosevelt, or
a Truman, or a Hays-Garfield
double-reverse credibility peace
talk negotio politico - diplomat
iro! Zow!
I really don't know what's
happening. I mean, the circuits
are really jammed. Click —
Romney drops out — prediction
of Rockefeller. Click — New
Hampshire primary. McCarthy
succeeds, Kennedy in, McCarthy
threatened. Kennedy tours. Add
for McCarthy in sectors four
and five, subtract in three. John
son drops out. "It's a whole new
ball game." Predict, Predict. Il
logical. Illogical. Improper com
mand. Try again? Snapcrash
burn.
FADE IN:
"But what are you going to
do?"
"Well, I was going to work
for McCarthy. I guess I still
will. Although I wish he'd say
more about domestic issues.
But Kennedy's such an oppor
tunist. But he can probably win.
Against Nixon. Maybe it'll be
easier if Humphrey gets in. Or
maybe more difficult. So I guess

I'll work for McCarthy, like I
was going to unless it looks like
Kennedy is going to surpass
Humphrey in Indiana or maybe
in a write-in in Nebraska or
South Dakota. But then, who
lives in South Dakota?"
"Here, man, try some of
this." (Pause).
"Wow, that's good stuff."
(Pause, pause). "What was I
saying?"
"Gee, man, I don't know."
"Yeah."
FADE OUT or DISSOLVE,
even.
Magic Reg Week — students
only. It ends. Those damn pro
fessors start assigning reading
and there you are in the li
brary listening to the jackham
mers next door. Some pompous
professor pontificates about the
Structural Social Analysis of
Discrete Variables in Interaction
Processes, and you can't even
understand the graph. But p
is less than .001.
CONTENT: What the liberal
radical must do now is help build
a consciousness of the conse
quences of American behavior
that goes beyond impromptu re
actions to Vietnam and the Race
Problem.

ANTI-CONTENT: Bull. We've
known that for years. Jive.
BACKGROUND: People are
still getting 1-A's. People are
still dying. The sun is warm.
Hundreds of thousands of peo
ple are born every day. Not
enough die. Too many die.

We are all Phoebe Zeit-Geist
plunging out of the Helicopter
over Oxnard in which the Nazi
war-criminal took her to drop
her in the Leßrea Tar Pits but
which was interrupted by the
severing of the rope which sus
pended her by the arrow shot by

the Zen archer, in total mid
night darkness, an easy thing
the Zen Archer being blind since
birth.
And she cries, as she falls,
"Wflat does it all mean?"
Oh, I forgot about the drug
ged chocolate mouse.
