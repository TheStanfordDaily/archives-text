# The 						Washington Merry-Go-Round
## Log-rollers Threaten Trade 
### Drew Pearson 
WASHINGTON — Three key
Senators last week formed a
backstage, high-powered log
rolling team to fix import quotas
on textiles, steel and oil before
the American public woke up to
what was happening.
The three Senators were: Er
nest Hollings, freshman Demo
crat from South Carolina; Vance
Hartke, the dovish Democrat
from Indiana; and Russell Long,
the ebullient Democrat from
Louisiana, whose family owns
several million dollars' worth of
offshore oil leases in the Gulf of
Mexico.
Together they formed a cabal
which threatens to repeat the
old log-rolling fiasco of the
Hoover administration when the
Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was
put across on an unsuspecting
public. This ended in demolish
ing American trade. It was one
important factor which brought
on the Great Depression.
The handsome Hollings, repre
senting Southern textile manu
facturers, suddenly tacked the
textile import quota provision
on the fiscal bill continuing tele
phone and automobile excise
taxes. Hollings had done a lot
of advance spadework. The bill
shot through the Senate 55 to
31.
Administration Senators were
taken completely by surprise.
The textile industry has suf
fered no pain in recent years.
Between 1961 and 1966, its sales
jumped from $13.4 billion to
$19.5 billion. Its profits zoomed
from $280 million to $700 mil
lion in the same period.
During the two-year period
from 1965 to 1967 there was an
increase in textiles employment
despite more automation.
Nevertheless, Senate log-roll
ers had their way.
Other Loff-Rollers
Sitting in the Senate wings
was adroit, able Eddie McCor
mack, nephew of Speaker John
McCormack, and former Attor
ney General of Massachusetts.
He is the No. 1 mastermind of
the steel lobby. Working with
him was Senator Hartke, who
has contributed constructive

ideas toward peace and usually
has been a champion of the con
sumers.
However, big steel—Bethle
hem, Inland, U.S. Steel—has
plants and loading facilities on
the Lake Michigan shore of In
diana. Hartke has become the
spearhead of the lobby to put
quotas on steel imports.
Simultaneously, Sen. Russell
Long spearheads the lobby for
oil. Russell's family is the chief
stockholder in the Win-or-Lose
Oil Company with millions in
vested in Louisiana oil.
These three Senators have
corralled enough votes among
oil, steel and textile Senators to
override the fact that today the
United States exports $4 billion
more than it imports, and the
warning that American farmers
would be seriously hurt first i?
import quotas are placed on tex
tiles, steel and oil. Foreign
countries would retaliate imrfte
diately.
Secretary of the Treasury
Henry Fowler has also warned
that the import quotas would
jeopardize our balance of trade
nnd further hurt the dollar.
The National Retail Mer
chants Association has warned
that the quotas would lead to
substantial price increases for
the American public.
Nevertheless, the log-rolling
combine in Congress so far has
got its way.
Quiet Canadian Democracy
In contrast to the barnstorm
ing and ballyhoo over choosing
the next U.S. President, Canada
will select a new Prime Minister
next weekend in comparative
quiet.
Technically, the Liberal party
will simply replace its retiring
leader, Prime Minister Lester
Pearson, with a new party chief
tain. Because the Liberal party
is in power, the successor wiil
automatically take over as
Prime Minister without the fuss
of a national election.
The voters, however, aren't
being ignored. The party will
choose a leader who seems most
likely to win the next official
election, which probably will be
called sometime in the summer.

Thus the Canadian candi
dates, like their American coun
terparts, are out beating the
bushes to demonstrate their
voter appeal. The liberals even
have their Bobby Kennedy—
Pierre-Elliot Trudeau, a flimboy
ant, 44-year-old newcomer to
politics—who has shaken up the
party hierarchy.
Just as Bobby broke into the
government as Attorney Gen
eral, Trudeau is Minister of Jus
tice. Like Bobby, Trudeau is too
impatient to wait for an orderly
advance up the political ladder.
His greatest appeal, like Bob
by's, is with youth. But like
Bobby, he may need more sea
soning before he is qualified to
take over the government.
Therefore, the Liberals are
more likely to turn to the vet
eran, scholarly Minister of Ex
ternal Affairs, Paul Martin,* who
has a greater claim on the par
ty. Trudeau's headline appeal
and Martin's solid party base

make them the front runners.
By tradition, it is also a
French-Canadian's turn at lead
ership. Both Trudeau and Mar
tin are bilingual and come from
French-Canadian stock.
Two Anglo-Saxons, Minister of
Transport Paul Hellyer and
Minister of Trade Robert Win
ters, also have large followings.
Winters, a former businessman,
preaches "fiscal integrity,"
which appeals to the conserva
tives in his party. There are
seven other candidates, all well
qualified.
Best guess is that the quietly
able Martin will come out of the
Ottawa convention this weekend
as Canada's new leader. His se
lection would be reassuring to
Washington, for Martin has
lived most of his life in Wind
sor, opposite Detroit, and has
had many conferences with the
State Department. The White
House will be watching the
Canadian choice closely.

the American public.
Nevertheless, the log-rolling
combine in Congress so far has
got its way.
Quiet Canadian Democracy
In contrast to the barnstorm
ing and ballyhoo over choosing
the next U.S. President, Canada
will select a new Prime Minister
next weekend in comparative
quiet.
Technically, the Liberal party
will simply replace its retiring
leader, Prime Minister Lester
Pearson, with a new party chief
tain. Because the Liberal party
is in power, the successor wiil
automatically take over as
Prime Minister without the fuss
of a national election.
The voters, however, aren't
being ignored. The party will
choose a leader who seems most
likely to win the next official
election, which probably will be
called sometime in the summer.

Thus the Canadian candi
dates, like their American coun
terparts, are out beating the
bushes to demonstrate their
voter appeal. The liberals even
have their Bobby Kennedy—
Pierre-Elliot Trudeau, a flimboy
ant, 44-year-old newcomer to
politics—who has shaken up the
party hierarchy.
Just as Bobby broke into the
government as Attorney Gen
eral, Trudeau is Minister of Jus
tice. Like Bobby, Trudeau is too
impatient to wait for an orderly
advance up the political ladder.
His greatest appeal, like Bob
by's, is with youth. But like
Bobby, he may need more sea
soning before he is qualified to
take over the government.
Therefore, the Liberals are
more likely to turn to the vet
eran, scholarly Minister of Ex
ternal Affairs, Paul Martin,* who
has a greater claim on the par
ty. Trudeau's headline appeal
and Martin's solid party base

make them the front runners.
By tradition, it is also a
French-Canadian's turn at lead
ership. Both Trudeau and Mar
tin are bilingual and come from
French-Canadian stock.
Two Anglo-Saxons, Minister of
Transport Paul Hellyer and
Minister of Trade Robert Win
ters, also have large followings.
Winters, a former businessman,
preaches "fiscal integrity,"
which appeals to the conserva
tives in his party. There are
seven other candidates, all well
qualified.
Best guess is that the quietly
able Martin will come out of the
Ottawa convention this weekend
as Canada's new leader. His se
lection would be reassuring to
Washington, for Martin has
lived most of his life in Wind
sor, opposite Detroit, and has
had many conferences with the
State Department. The White
House will be watching the
Canadian choice closely.

WASHINGTON — Three key
Senators last week formed a
backstage, high-powered log
rolling team to fix import quotas
on textiles, steel and oil before
the American public woke up to
what was happening.
The three Senators were: Er
nest Hollings, freshman Demo
crat from South Carolina; Vance
Hartke, the dovish Democrat
from Indiana; and Russell Long,
the ebullient Democrat from
Louisiana, whose family owns
several million dollars' worth of
offshore oil leases in the Gulf of
Mexico.
Together they formed a cabal
which threatens to repeat the
old log-rolling fiasco of the
Hoover administration when the
Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was
put across on an unsuspecting
public. This ended in demolish
ing American trade. It was one
important factor which brought
on the Great Depression.
The handsome Hollings, repre
senting Southern textile manu
facturers, suddenly tacked the
textile import quota provision
on the fiscal bill continuing tele
phone and automobile excise
taxes. Hollings had done a lot
of advance spadework. The bill
shot through the Senate 55 to
31.
Administration Senators were
taken completely by surprise.
The textile industry has suf
fered no pain in recent years.
Between 1961 and 1966, its sales
jumped from $13.4 billion to
$19.5 billion. Its profits zoomed
from $280 million to $700 mil
lion in the same period.
During the two-year period
from 1965 to 1967 there was an
increase in textiles employment
despite more automation.
Nevertheless, Senate log-roll
ers had their way.
Other Loff-Rollers
Sitting in the Senate wings
was adroit, able Eddie McCor
mack, nephew of Speaker John
McCormack, and former Attor
ney General of Massachusetts.
He is the No. 1 mastermind of
the steel lobby. Working with
him was Senator Hartke, who
has contributed constructive

ideas toward peace and usually
has been a champion of the con
sumers.
However, big steel—Bethle
hem, Inland, U.S. Steel—has
plants and loading facilities on
the Lake Michigan shore of In
diana. Hartke has become the
spearhead of the lobby to put
quotas on steel imports.
Simultaneously, Sen. Russell
Long spearheads the lobby for
oil. Russell's family is the chief
stockholder in the Win-or-Lose
Oil Company with millions in
vested in Louisiana oil.
These three Senators have
corralled enough votes among
oil, steel and textile Senators to
override the fact that today the
United States exports $4 billion
more than it imports, and the
warning that American farmers
would be seriously hurt first i?
import quotas are placed on tex
tiles, steel and oil. Foreign
countries would retaliate imrfte
diately.
Secretary of the Treasury
Henry Fowler has also warned
that the import quotas would
jeopardize our balance of trade

Together they formed a cabal
which threatens to repeat the
old log-rolling fiasco of the
Hoover administration when the
Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was
put across on an unsuspecting
public. This ended in demolish
ing American trade. It was one
important factor which brought
on the Great Depression.
The handsome Hollings, repre
senting Southern textile manu
facturers, suddenly tacked the
textile import quota provision
on the fiscal bill continuing tele
phone and automobile excise
taxes. Hollings had done a lot
of advance spadework. The bill
shot through the Senate 55 to
31.
Administration Senators were
taken completely by surprise.
The textile industry has suf
fered no pain in recent years.
Between 1961 and 1966, its sales
jumped from $13.4 billion to
$19.5 billion. Its profits zoomed
from $280 million to $700 mil
lion in the same period.
During the two-year period
from 1965 to 1967 there was an
increase in textiles employment
despite more automation.
Nevertheless, Senate log-roll
ers had their way.
Other Loff-Rollers
Sitting in the Senate wings
was adroit, able Eddie McCor
mack, nephew of Speaker John
McCormack, and former Attor
ney General of Massachusetts.
He is the No. 1 mastermind of
the steel lobby. Working with
him was Senator Hartke, who
has contributed constructive

ideas toward peace and usually
has been a champion of the con
sumers.
However, big steel—Bethle
hem, Inland, U.S. Steel—has
plants and loading facilities on
the Lake Michigan shore of In
diana. Hartke has become the
spearhead of the lobby to put
quotas on steel imports.
Simultaneously, Sen. Russell
Long spearheads the lobby for
oil. Russell's family is the chief
stockholder in the Win-or-Lose
Oil Company with millions in
vested in Louisiana oil.
These three Senators have
corralled enough votes among
oil, steel and textile Senators to
override the fact that today the
United States exports $4 billion
more than it imports, and the
warning that American farmers
would be seriously hurt first i?
import quotas are placed on tex
tiles, steel and oil. Foreign
countries would retaliate imrfte
diately.
Secretary of the Treasury
Henry Fowler has also warned
that the import quotas would
jeopardize our balance of trade
nnd further hurt the dollar.
The National Retail Mer
chants Association has warned
that the quotas would lead to
substantial price increases for
the American public.
Nevertheless, the log-rolling
combine in Congress so far has
got its way.
Quiet Canadian Democracy
In contrast to the barnstorm
ing and ballyhoo over choosing
the next U.S. President, Canada
will select a new Prime Minister
next weekend in comparative
quiet.
Technically, the Liberal party
will simply replace its retiring
leader, Prime Minister Lester
Pearson, with a new party chief
tain. Because the Liberal party
is in power, the successor wiil
automatically take over as
Prime Minister without the fuss
of a national election.
The voters, however, aren't
being ignored. The party will
choose a leader who seems most
likely to win the next official
election, which probably will be
called sometime in the summer.

Thus the Canadian candi
dates, like their American coun
terparts, are out beating the
bushes to demonstrate their
voter appeal. The liberals even
have their Bobby Kennedy—
Pierre-Elliot Trudeau, a flimboy
ant, 44-year-old newcomer to
politics—who has shaken up the
party hierarchy.
Just as Bobby broke into the
government as Attorney Gen
eral, Trudeau is Minister of Jus
tice. Like Bobby, Trudeau is too
impatient to wait for an orderly
advance up the political ladder.
His greatest appeal, like Bob
by's, is with youth. But like
Bobby, he may need more sea
soning before he is qualified to
take over the government.
Therefore, the Liberals are
more likely to turn to the vet
eran, scholarly Minister of Ex
ternal Affairs, Paul Martin,* who
has a greater claim on the par
ty. Trudeau's headline appeal
and Martin's solid party base

make them the front runners.
By tradition, it is also a
French-Canadian's turn at lead
ership. Both Trudeau and Mar
tin are bilingual and come from
French-Canadian stock.
Two Anglo-Saxons, Minister of
Transport Paul Hellyer and
Minister of Trade Robert Win
ters, also have large followings.
Winters, a former businessman,
preaches "fiscal integrity,"
which appeals to the conserva
tives in his party. There are
seven other candidates, all well
qualified.
Best guess is that the quietly
able Martin will come out of the
Ottawa convention this weekend
as Canada's new leader. His se
lection would be reassuring to
Washington, for Martin has
lived most of his life in Wind
sor, opposite Detroit, and has
had many conferences with the
State Department. The White
House will be watching the
Canadian choice closely.

WASHINGTON — Three key
Senators last week formed a
backstage, high-powered log
