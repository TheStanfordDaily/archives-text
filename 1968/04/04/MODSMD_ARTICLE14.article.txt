# The 						Capitol Scenes
## Crystal Balls Need Fixing 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON—After Presi
dent Johnson's earth-shattering
speech on Sunday night in
which he announced that he
would not be a candidate for the
Presidency in 1968, I immediate
ly called my crystal ball repair
man and told him to get over
right away.
"I'm sorry," he said, "I'm
swamped. Every columnist, pun
dit and television commentator
has been calling in, wanting his
crystall ball repaired, and I just
can't get to all of them right
now."
"But I've got to have mine
fixed," I cried. "My living de
pends on it."
"That's what they all say," the
repairman said. "Look, if you
want to bring it in tomorrow
morning, I'll see what I can do.
But with what has been going
on in the past few months, I
just can't make house calls."
I arrived the next morning at
8 o'clock, hoping I would get
immediate service, but the repair
shop was jammed. Drew Pear
son was fighting with James
Reston, Robert Novak was try
ing to push in front of David
Lawrence. Walter Lippman was
arguing with Eric Sevareid, Wil
liam Buckley and David Brink

ley were hugging the counter.
Russell Baker, who had just
written a book on the elections,
was standing in a corner, cry
ing. Clark Mollenhoff, who had
written Romney's biography,
was pulling out his hair. The
crystal ball repairman was go
ing out of his mind.
He finally said: "All right,
shut up, everybody! I'm going to
give you each a number and
you're going to have to wait
your turn."
I sat on a bench between
Walter Cronkite and the cartoon
ist, Herb Block. Each of us held
his crystal ball on his lap.
"You would think these things
would work during an election
year," Cronkite complained bit
terly.
"Would you believe," William
S. White said, "that on the basis
of my crystal ball, I was writing
a new book on the next four
years of President Johnson?"
Five hours later my number
was called. The repairman took
one look at the ball and shook
his head. 'This one is in worse
shape than Kiplinger's."
"Well, could I trade it in for
a new one?"
"All the 1968 models have
been recalled to the factory for

repairs," he said, "but I have a
used model here that's in excel
lent condition."
"I'll take it," I cried. I took it
home and unwrapped it. To my
horror, I saw Thomas Dewey
reading his inaugural speech on
the steps of the Capitol.

can't get to all of them right
now."
"But I've got to have mine
fixed," I cried. "My living de
pends on it."
"That's what they all say," the
repairman said. "Look, if you
want to bring it in tomorrow
morning, I'll see what I can do.
But with what has been going
on in the past few months, I
just can't make house calls."
I arrived the next morning at
8 o'clock, hoping I would get
immediate service, but the repair
shop was jammed. Drew Pear
son was fighting with James
Reston, Robert Novak was try
ing to push in front of David
Lawrence. Walter Lippman was
arguing with Eric Sevareid, Wil
liam Buckley and David Brink

ley were hugging the counter.
Russell Baker, who had just
written a book on the elections,
was standing in a corner, cry
ing. Clark Mollenhoff, who had
written Romney's biography,
was pulling out his hair. The
crystal ball repairman was go
ing out of his mind.
He finally said: "All right,
shut up, everybody! I'm going to
give you each a number and
you're going to have to wait
your turn."
I sat on a bench between
Walter Cronkite and the cartoon
ist, Herb Block. Each of us held
his crystal ball on his lap.
"You would think these things
would work during an election
year," Cronkite complained bit
terly.
"Would you believe," William
S. White said, "that on the basis
of my crystal ball, I was writing
a new book on the next four
years of President Johnson?"
Five hours later my number
was called. The repairman took
one look at the ball and shook
his head. 'This one is in worse
shape than Kiplinger's."
"Well, could I trade it in for
a new one?"
"All the 1968 models have
been recalled to the factory for

repairs," he said, "but I have a
used model here that's in excel
lent condition."
"I'll take it," I cried. I took it
home and unwrapped it. To my
horror, I saw Thomas Dewey
reading his inaugural speech on
the steps of the Capitol.

WASHINGTON—After Presi

speech on Sunday night in
which he announced that he
would not be a candidate for the
Presidency in 1968, I immediate

man and told him to get over
right away.
"I'm sorry," he said, "I'm
swamped. Every columnist, pun
dit and television commentator
has been calling in, wanting his
crystall ball repaired, and I just
can't get to all of them right
