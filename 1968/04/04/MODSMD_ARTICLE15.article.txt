# Two Students Officers Give Views On ASSU
## 'Valuable Service'... 
### RICH WARE Student Financial Manager 
At the center of almost all stu
dent activities is the Office of
the Associated Students. In order
to conclude, at least for now,
my attempt to outline the struc
ture and activities of the ASSU
it is important to discuss tfie
financial aspects of this Asso
ciation connected with the Of
fice, as well as the effect it has
upon the many voluntary stu
dent organizations.
Briefly, the ASSU Office was
established to provide financial
and administrative services for
the Association, its subordinate
agencies, and all other student
organizations, as well as a guar
antee of solvency for their fi
nances. The Office itself has a
variety of functions. By far, the
most important of these has to
do with the Students' Organiza
tions Fund (SOF). This is the
name of the banking institution
set up to facilitate all financial
operations of student groups.
Membership in the Fund is
required of all ASSU agencies
as well as all registered Stan
ford voluntary student organi
zations, with the exception of
the fraternities, eating clubs, and
certain religious groups. The
annual cash flow through the
SOF is approximately $2 million
— money deposited and dis
bursed through some 350 ac
counts.
Financial Procedure
An example might help clarify
how the SOF affects a student
group. Each dormitory deposits
its social dues with the ASSU.
When the dorm then wishes to
make a purchase, its treasurer
issues a "purchase order," which
Is subsequently approved by the
Student Financial Manager and
then presented to the merchant
for goods on credit. Each com
pany bills the SOF, the treasurer
authorizes payment, and a check
is written and mailed to the ven
dor. Each organization can see
from day-to-day how much mon
ey is in its account, and it re
ceives a monthly statement of
transactions. All records are
kept on file for five years, and
are always available for inspec
tion.
In administering the funds of
voluntary organization, the Stu
dent Financial Manager exer
cises no control over what is be
ing purchased. He automatically
authorizes a request if the ac
count has enough money to
cover it. Also, in certain cases,
the SOF can extend credit to
groups which for some reason
have a delayed income.
The process of securing a pur
chase order takes only a few
moments, or at most overnight.
Normally, check requests are
processed in the afternoon and
checks are written the follow
ing morning.
As you can see, the purpose of
the Students' Organizations
Fund is to provide protection for
both student groups and area
merchants. Once the ASSU ap
proves a purchase order, it guar
antees payment — and the SOF
has an outstanding credit rat
ing on the Peninsula. Also, it
affords the student organizations
adequate protection in impec
cable written records, as in the
frequent cases where vendors
insist that a bill has not been
paid.
Additional Office Services
Also in the financial line,
ASSU does the following: (1)
For groups which pay salaries,
withholding tax is automatical
ly deducted, government W-2
forms are prepared and report
ed. (2) When a group has in
come from sales of certain ar

ticles, sales taxes are automatic
ally computed and billed to the
organization. (3) Accounts with
large balances may take advant
age of SOF savings accounts,
paying 3.5 per cent daily inter
est. (4) Interest-free loans are
available, especially for the pur
chase of TV's, stereos, and
house improvements. (5) Insur
ance policies are maintained for
groups, with coverage ranging
from theft of stereos to trip ac
cident and liability.
In the way of administrative
services, the ASSU Office main
tains a variety of office machines
for the use of the groups. There
are various economical repro
duction processes, including Xe
rox, ditto, and mimeograph.
There are also typewriters, a
postage meter, and a telephone
for long distance calls. Where an
expense is involved, the amount
can be charged to a member or
ganization — but all of these
administrative services are
available to any student paying
cash.
On a somewhat more abstract
level, the ASSU Office serves as
a central information source for
students, faculty, and staff, as
well as visitors and other inter
ested persons. The office person
nel are on duty daily from 8:30
a.m. until 4:30 p.m., twelve
months a year, to assist groups
in carrying out their programs
and to answer their questions.
The Office Staff
To keep an operation as size
able as this functioning, there
are four full-time employees.
The Office Supervisor and Book
keeper are primarily concerned
with the financial operations.
The Receptionist, in addition to
answering questions, prepares
all the checks (which average
about 80 per day). The ASSU
Secretary serves the Student Fi
nancial Manager and the Execu
tive Office, as well as assisting
students with the use of the
office machines. In addition, a
student works part-time to do
mimeograph work and filing.
The permanent office staff pro
vides the vital function of con
tinuity from year to year, which
the "transient" students cannot.
The office operates under the
supervision of the Student Fi
nancial Manager, with the help
of two assistants. Through his
office channel all financial trans
actions, as well as arrangements
for programs, use of White
Plaza, supervision of Lake Lag
unita and the Boathouse, re
quests for the services of Stu
dent Police, and similar matters.
In addition to his function as
comptroller, he serves as gen
eral trouble-shooter.
Role of the Dean
Frequent comment has been
made concerning the relation
ship of the Dean of Students
and the ASSU Office. In the
ASSU Constitution, the Presi
dent of the University appoints
the Financial Director of the
Association — who is now Dean
Joel P. Smith. It is he who has
the ultimate responsibility for
the fiscal operations of the SOF.
The Financial Director appoints
his agent, the Student Financial
Manager, as working head of
the office.
At this point, however, the
working relationship ends. The
Dean intervenes in no substan
tive manner — he simply doesn't
have time. His most important
function vis-a-vis the ASSU Of
fice is choosing the best people
to do the job, and letting them
do it. The University would in
tervene only in some extraordi
nary, and presently unforsee
able, circumstances.
All the expense for maintaing

the operations of the ASSU Of
fice and the SOF is absorbed by
the ASSU Budget. This budget
is prepared in the spring, for
the following year, by the Stu
dent Financial Manager, and it
is submitted to the Legislature
for approval. A few brief points
about the budget should clear
up many questions.
The ASSU Master Budget has
four sources of income: (1) Stu
dent fees, collected with tuition,
on the basis of $3.00 per student
per quarter. This amounts to
approximately $113,000 this
year. (2) The budget surplus
from two years previous to the
current year. (3) Income from
investments. (As any bank, the
ASSU invests its surplus rather
than keeping it in a checking
account, in order to help defray
expenses.) (4) Income from the
Sunday Flicks. The total budget
this year is $132,000.
In deciding the budget appro
priations, there are certain fixed
expenses. The first, and most
obvious, is the expense of oper
ating the office, including sala
ries and overhead (about $30,-
000). The other major fixed ex
pense is a by-laws requirement
of 85 cents per student per quar
ter for the Stanford Daily (about
$28,000).
From the sizeable remaining
amount, Legislature appropri
ates money to the various Boards
and Commissions which are part
of ASSU according to their re
quests to support programs.
To allow for unforseen pro
is also a contingency fund at
the disposal of Legislature. This
year that fund was about $13,000,
from which support has been
given to a variety of groups, as
reported in the Daily from time
to time.
Hopefully, this mass of facts
has conveyed some worthwhile
impression of the financial as
pects of the ASSU and the Stu
dents' Organizations Fund. It is
a large operation, necessarily
complex, but as far as the mem
ber groups are concerned it has
become increasingly efficient
over the last few years in spite
of a doubling of volume and de
crease in office personnel. As
now constituted, it provides a
valuable service to the Stanford
community and the many mer
chants in the area.
