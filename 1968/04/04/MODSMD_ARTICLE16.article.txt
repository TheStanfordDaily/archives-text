# Letters To The Editor
## Senator Hatfield Criticizes Draft 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
As you know, instructions
were recently issued by the Di
rector of Selective Service to
State Directors to end defer
ments for those who would, in
the Fall of 1968, be first or sec
ond year graduate students (in
fields other than medicine, den
tistry and allied medical special
ties).
The most recent study of the
effect of these instructions, com
piled by the Council of Grad
uate Schools, predicts that of
first-year students, the schools
will lose 66 percent; of second
year students, 33 percent.
Campus dissent, since this an
nouncement, has centered on
the discriminatory and unwise
action of taking our country's
scholars out of the university
and sacrificing them on the bat
tlefield for a war of question
able goals and negligible results,
but their protests have missed

the main point — that the draft
system itself is basically inequit
able.
No amount of patching will
fix a selective service structure
which is essentially unfair. As a
student leader, you have prob
ably seen the growth of student
apathy and disillusionment on
your campus. It seems to me
that constructive involvement is
the cure for this alienation and
the draft dialogue is certainly
a reason for students to accept
this cure.
Therefore I would ask your
fellow-students to send their
suggestions and comments to
the Senate Armed Services Com
mittee as well as to me.
