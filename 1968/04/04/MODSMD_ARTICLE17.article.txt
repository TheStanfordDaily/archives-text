# 'Governs Nothing'...
## 
### DENIS HAYES ASSU Vice President 
The most cogent fact about
student government at Stanford
is that it doesn't "govern" any
thing.
This is not to say the Associ
ated Students doesn't "do" any
thing. In truth it does many
things. Some of these things, as
Rich Ware's April 2 Daily arti
cle pointed out, are good. Even
necessary. No sober person
could suggest that these essen
tial services to the student body
be discontinued, and many of us
share the opinion they should
be expanded.
But they have nothing to do
with "government".
Yet for the past several years
the elected officials of the ASSU
have devoted their primary ener
gies to governance: to trying to
affect the decision-making appa
ratus of the University. These
efforts have been virtually with
out effect.
There are some who feel that
the running of the University is
none of our business. If a stu
dent doesn't like the way things
are, he can get out. Holders of
this opinion will undoubtedly be
speaking their minds at the
ASSU Constitutional Conven
tion April 6. Should their view
prevail, it would perhaps be
hoove us to find a new name
for "student government".
However, I doubt this will oc
cur. The overwhelming majority
of administrators, faculty, and
students seem to be of the opin
ion that we students do have a
legitimate role to play in the
actual governing of our institu
tion. This being so, the time has
come for us to create a struc
ture within which such a role
can be realized.
If any one thing has become
obvious in the past few years,
it is that a "governmental"
structure cannot be viable until
we are willing to "work with"
the faculty and the administra
tion. At present we content our
selves with "working for" or
"working against" these forces.
If we really wish to influence
the formulation of basic policy,
we must first "infiltrate" the es
tablished power structure. Yet
to date our government has
made no move in this direction.

The tendency among many
student leaders is to blame the
lack of a "community" govern
ment upon an authoritarian ad
ministration and upon a faculty
too narrowly jealous of its
powers. There is, of course, a
degree of truth in such charges
(as more progressive members
of both these constituencies are
the first to concede).
But even granting this, there's
a lot of blame left over. And
this share of the "blame" is
rightfully attributed to our
selves.
The past relationship of our
phony "government" to the
real University government has
too often been one of picayune
hostility. In terms of meaning
ful progress toward real student
participation in the decision
making process, the actions of
our legislature have been not
only unproductive but frequent
ly counterproductive.
Rather than seeking to estab
lish some common ground in
joint institutions, we convene
our autonomous huddle Thurs
day nights on Geology corner,
pass meaningless (and frequent
ly unrepresentative) resolutions,

condemn offers of advancement
as "gradualism", and defame
the student appointees to SES as
Uncle Toms.
Granted such a structure, our
only possible power would be as
a lobbyâ€”a pressure group. But
our student government has
failed even in this, due to its
singular inability to mobilize
widespread student support.
Peer Group Polities
The form of our present Con
stitutional government arises
from a theory of interest group
politics which is inappropriate
to the University situation.
No one could deny that there
exist some enormous differences
between ourselves and our adult
mentors. But I do deny the ridic
ulous assumption that our rela
tions with these people are prin
cipally defined by conflict, and
that our differences can be set
tled in no manner other than a
peer group contest of wills. This
simply isn't true.
For example, there has been
an open and long-standing diver
gence of opinion concerning op
timal housing arrangements.
Yet we managed to recently de
sign a wholly new residence pro

gram, with widespread student
participations at all stages. The
end result is not perfect, but it
is good.
This operation took place un
der the direction of the univer
sity administration and at the
urging of the SES. Meanwhile
our student government, which
had been advocating a housing
change for decades, sat idly on
its sitter.
Constitutional Convention
The presuppositions of our
present Constitution simply do
not reflect the realities of our
world. A Constitutional Conven
tion has been scheduled this
weekend to reconcile the two.
There will be a number of
topics studied, including the
campus judicial system, ASSU
finances, and the role of gradu
ate students. But the principal
purpose of this Convention will
be to precisely define the legiti
mate role of the student in Uni
versity governance and to de
vise a realistic structure within
which that role can bo realized.
The job is formidable. But if
the Convention fails, we seem
doomed to at least one more
year of irrelevant silliness.
