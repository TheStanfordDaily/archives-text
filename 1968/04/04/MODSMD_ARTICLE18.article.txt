# Options For Education
## 
### SUE NEIL 
Prof. Willis Harman last night
presented two probable alterna
tives for the future of education
and warned that "a choice is
being made in the unpleasant
direction at the moment."
Harman's Century 21 speech
in Tresidder lounge was titled
"Alternative Futures for Educa
tion in America." Tonight the
Century 21 series will continue
with Robert Hudson's talk on
"Communication Satellites: Fu
ture of Educational Television."
Hudson, the senior vice-presi
dent of National Educational
Television, will speak in Tre
sidder lounge at 7:30.
Harman, a Stanford engineer
ing professor and director of
Stanford's Research Institute's
educational policy research proj
ect stated that one of the two
most likely futures, the most
favorable, will be education that
"pays attention to' the whole
nature of the human being."
Such an educational program
would develop students who are
less attached to achieving suc
cess in the business sense and
who place more emphasis on per
sonal relations and expression
and individual growth, he said.
Harman sees signs of the op
posite alternative, however,

which is "increasingly likely as
years go on." He predicts in
creasing militancy, violence, ur
banization, extra • institutional
religious forms, acceptance of
hedonistic philosophies.
These may lead to growing
demands for repressive response.
He says we are already "mov
ing in the direction of a fascist
state."
Education in the future will
follow one of these two paths,
whether the choice is made con
sciously or unconsciously, he be
lieves. However, Harman sees a
trend toward a "new conscious
role" for education at all levels.
There is more awareness that
education is "very actively shap
ing the future."
Education Is presently being
extended in at least three ways:
temporarily—in that it is start
ing earlier and continuing long
er; decentrally—occurring "less
and less on the campus and in
the schools" and more in service
and on-the-job training; and
functionally — becoming "more
concerned with the whole man,"
including his emotions and feel
ings.
Harman sees more involve
ment of education in society as
universities realize the need to
provide an "open door" to pro

fessional vocational levels, rath
er than the "closed door" they
have so often presented in the
past.
There will be increased use ol
scientific methods and technolo
gical advances, such as compu
terized teaching systems that
will provide more possibilities
for individualized instruction.
However, Harman asserted that
there are "basic issues that can't
be settled now or m the foresee
able future on a basis of scien
tific research."

trend toward a "new conscious
role" for education at all levels.
There is more awareness that
education is "very actively shap
ing the future."
Education Is presently being
extended in at least three ways:
temporarily—in that it is start
ing earlier and continuing long
er; decentrally—occurring "less
and less on the campus and in
the schools" and more in service
and on-the-job training; and
functionally — becoming "more
concerned with the whole man,"
including his emotions and feel
ings.
Harman sees more involve
ment of education in society as
universities realize the need to
provide an "open door" to pro

fessional vocational levels, rath
er than the "closed door" they
have so often presented in the
past.
There will be increased use ol
scientific methods and technolo
gical advances, such as compu
terized teaching systems that
will provide more possibilities
for individualized instruction.
However, Harman asserted that
there are "basic issues that can't
be settled now or m the foresee
able future on a basis of scien
tific research."
Prof. Willis Harman last night
presented two probable alterna
tives for the future of education
and warned that "a choice is
being made in the unpleasant
direction at the moment."
Harman's Century 21 speech
in Tresidder lounge was titled
"Alternative Futures for Educa
tion in America." Tonight the
Century 21 series will continue
with Robert Hudson's talk on
"Communication Satellites: Fu
ture of Educational Television."
Hudson, the senior vice-presi
dent of National Educational
Television, will speak in Tre
sidder lounge at 7:30.
Harman, a Stanford engineer
ing professor and director of
Stanford's Research Institute's
educational policy research proj
ect stated that one of the two
most likely futures, the most
favorable, will be education that
"pays attention to' the whole
nature of the human being."
Such an educational program
would develop students who are
less attached to achieving suc
cess in the business sense and
who place more emphasis on per
sonal relations and expression
and individual growth, he said.
Harman sees signs of the op
posite alternative, however,

which is "increasingly likely as
years go on." He predicts in
creasing militancy, violence, ur
banization, extra • institutional
religious forms, acceptance of
hedonistic philosophies.
These may lead to growing
demands for repressive response.
He says we are already "mov
ing in the direction of a fascist
state."
Education in the future will
follow one of these two paths,
whether the choice is made con
sciously or unconsciously, he be
lieves. However, Harman sees a
trend toward a "new conscious
role" for education at all levels.
