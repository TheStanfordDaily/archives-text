# Biology Research Cruise
## Te Vega To Sail 
### 
Stanford's 135-foot schooner
To Vega, a research ship, is
leaving April 4 for a ten-week
cruise to the Galapagos Islands.
Aboard will be three faculty
members, two teaching assist
ants, and ten students studying
biological oceanography.
Prof. Donald P. Abbott of
Hopkin's Marine Station, which
operates the Te Vega under Na

tional Science Foundation
(NSF) sponsorship, will serve as
chief scientist for the expedi
tion, which is the 18th.
Each expedition is equivalent
to a regular academic course,
and lasts for one quarter.
Students are chosen for the
course (Biology 222h) from par
ticipating institutions in the
U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Their
expenses are included in the
NSF sponsorship of the pro
gram.
During the expedition the bi
ologists will make extensive in
vestigations of marine life
among the shallows of the coast
line, looking particularly for
clues to explain the distribution
of various kinds of organisms.

dition 18 are: Senior Scientists:
