## Relief Force Near Khe Sanh 
### 
SAIGON (AP) — A push by
20,000 allied troops to shatter
the enemy siege of Khe Sanh
was disclosed Wednesday. With
the relief column last reported
eight miles away, hopes ran
high that the hard-hit Marine
base would be reached soon.
Field reports said the drive
had met little resistance since it
kicked off Monday from Ca Lu,
12 miles east of Khe Sanh. But
blown bridges and landslides on
National Route 9 slowed the ad
vance.
U.S. Ist Cavalry Division
troopers, Marines and South
Vietnames were taking part in
this biggest offensive in the far
north in nearly a year.
For more than two months the
base in the northwest corner of
South Vietnam has been be
sieged by 16,000 to 20,000 North
Vietnamese troops. Only by per
ilous plane and helicopter
flights have the 6,000 Marines
and 1,000 South Vietnamese
there been supplied and casual
ties removed.
The immediate aim was to
open Route 9 as a supply road to
Khe Sanh. But officers said the
ultimate aim was to bring to
battle the 301 th and 325 C North
Vietnamese divisions around
Khe Sanh.
In the air, informed sources
said a U.S. Navy plane patrol
ling the Gulf of Siam off South
Vietnam's west coast was shot
down Monday by a Cambodian
navy boat.
• Wisconsin Results
MILWAUKEE, Wis. (AP)
Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy, pro
pelled by a landslide, 57 per

cent showing in Wisconsin's
presidential primary, went to
work Wednesday to enhance his
Democratic fortunes in contests
he acknowledged may prove
more difficult.
The Minnesota senator swept
to a Wisconsin primary victory
Tuesday. President Johnson,
whose Sunday rejection of can
didacy stripped the primary of
its major contest, drew 35 per
cent of the Democratic vote.
Richard M. Nixon captured 80
per cent of the smaller Republi
can turnout. He said it showed
Wisconsin would be in the GOP
column when the White House
votes are counted next Nov. 5.
For McCarthy, it was on to
South Bend, Ind., in the state in
which he and Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy, D-N.Y., will meet
head-to-head in a May 7 pri
mary.
"I think that after Indiana
there will be only one candi
date," McCarthy said there.
These were virtually complete
returns in the Wisconsin Demo
cratic primary:
McCarthy 400,098, or 57 per
cent.
Johnson 249,518, for 35 per
cent.
Kennedy, whose name was
not on the ballot, and who ad
vised his supporters to vote for
McCarthy, received 43,207 votes,
a 6 per cent share.
• Czech Suicide Probe
PRAGUE (AP) — Twenty
years after the fact, Czechoslo
vak authorities announced Wed
nesday night that they will in
vcstigate the 1948 "suicide" of
Jan Masaryk, the national lead

er whose death symbolizes the
brutality of Stalin era rule for
millions of his countrymen.
The acting attorney general,
Frantisek Zabransky, confirmed
his office is investigating
charges Masaryk was mur
dered. The announcement came
amid open skepticism about the
police contention that the death
this week of Jozef Brestansky,
an investigator of Stalinist era
crimes, was a suicide.
In another development, Dep
uty Premier Otakar Simunek
and Defense Minister Bohumir
Lomsky resigned Wednesday.
The two formerly were support
ers of the ousted president and
Communist party chief, Antonin
Novotnv.
They surrendered their posts
at a meeting of the party's
Central Committee called to dis
cuss personnel changes and a
new action program to carry
out political and economic re
forms. Simunek told the com
mittee he disagreed with criti
cism of his hard-line policies.
• 1,50 Plants Struck
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)—The
Federal Mediation and Concili
ation Service worked Wednes
day to arrange joint meetings
among the principals in a ma
chinists strike affecting 150 Bay
Area manufacturing plants.
The strike, called Monday
against the 82-member Califor
nia Metal Trades Association,
spread to other shops in four
counties and involves 11,000 ma
chinists and 9,000 others who re
fused to cross picket lines.
A spokesman for the AFL
CIO International Association of

Machinists said Wednesday
there were no plans to extend
the strike to 400 Bay Area
firms still operating.
The day before, a spokesman
was quoted as saying other
firms would be struck "one by
one" until the firms agreed to
resume negotiations on union
demands.
• Anti-Reagan Slate
LOS ANGELES (AP)—A Re
publican group opposed to Gov.
Reagan's favorite son candidacy
said Wednesday it expects to
qualify for the June 4 presi
dential primary election.
Unless the group obtains 18,-
715 signatures on nominating
petitions by 5 p.m. Friday, the
Republican ballot will list only
one slate of delegates—firmly
pledged to Gov. Reagan for
president.
Sponsors of the new group
hope to qualify a delegation
pledged to no candidate but ob
viously at odds with Reagan. It
would be called the "Free
Choice" delegation.
Reagan has said repeatedly
he is not a candidate for pres
ident, and that his favorite-son
candidacy is to preserve party
unity in the state.
"Republicans in California
who want someone other than
Reagan for president should be
given an alternative on the June
ballot," Wilcox said.
• Record Stock Vol,
NEW YORK (AP)—Trading
on the New York Stock Ex
change exploded to an all-time
record Wednesday in a burst of
investors' enthusiasm over Viet
nam peace possibilities.
A total of 19,290,000 shares
changed hands and swamped
the exchange's ticker tape.
The volume spurted well
above the record of 17.73 million
shares traded Monday, which
topped the previous mark of
16.41 million shares set Oct. 29,
1929, the day of the historic
market crash.
Hanoi's broadcast of its will
ingness to talk with the United
States about a complete halt of

the bombing of North Vietnam
triggered the powerful reaction.
As trading volume a first
hour record, prices jumped.
However, profit taking and a
closer examination of Hanoi's
intent later resulted in a sub
stantial whittling of the early
gain.
The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials jumped 13.12 points
in the first 90 minutes of trad
ing but closed with a gain of
5.15 points at 869.11.

• 1,50 Plants Struck
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)—The
Federal Mediation and Concili

day to arrange joint meetings
among the principals in a ma
chinists strike affecting 150 Bay
Area manufacturing plants.
The strike, called Monday
against the 82-member Califor
nia Metal Trades Association,
spread to other shops in four
counties and involves 11,000 ma
chinists and 9,000 others who re
fused to cross picket lines.
A spokesman for the AFL
CIO International Association of

Machinists said Wednesday
there were no plans to extend
the strike to 400 Bay Area
firms still operating.
The day before, a spokesman
was quoted as saying other
firms would be struck "one by
one" until the firms agreed to
resume negotiations on union
demands.
• Anti-Reagan Slate
LOS ANGELES (AP)—A Re
publican group opposed to Gov.
Reagan's favorite son candidacy
said Wednesday it expects to
qualify for the June 4 presi
dential primary election.
Unless the group obtains 18,-
715 signatures on nominating
petitions by 5 p.m. Friday, the
Republican ballot will list only
one slate of delegates—firmly
pledged to Gov. Reagan for
president.
Sponsors of the new group
hope to qualify a delegation
pledged to no candidate but ob
viously at odds with Reagan. It
would be called the "Free
Choice" delegation.
Reagan has said repeatedly
he is not a candidate for pres
ident, and that his favorite-son
candidacy is to preserve party
unity in the state.
"Republicans in California
who want someone other than
Reagan for president should be
given an alternative on the June
ballot," Wilcox said.
• Record Stock Vol,
NEW YORK (AP)—Trading
on the New York Stock Ex
change exploded to an all-time
record Wednesday in a burst of
investors' enthusiasm over Viet
nam peace possibilities.
A total of 19,290,000 shares
changed hands and swamped
the exchange's ticker tape.
The volume spurted well
above the record of 17.73 million
shares traded Monday, which
topped the previous mark of
16.41 million shares set Oct. 29,
1929, the day of the historic
market crash.
Hanoi's broadcast of its will
ingness to talk with the United
States about a complete halt of

the bombing of North Vietnam
triggered the powerful reaction.
As trading volume a first
hour record, prices jumped.
However, profit taking and a
closer examination of Hanoi's
intent later resulted in a sub
stantial whittling of the early
gain.
The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials jumped 13.12 points
in the first 90 minutes of trad

5.15 points at 869.11.
SAIGON (AP) — A push by
20,000 allied troops to shatter
the enemy siege of Khe Sanh
was disclosed Wednesday. With
the relief column last reported
eight miles away, hopes ran
high that the hard-hit Marine
base would be reached soon.
Field reports said the drive
had met little resistance since it
kicked off Monday from Ca Lu,
12 miles east of Khe Sanh. But
blown bridges and landslides on
National Route 9 slowed the ad
vance.
U.S. Ist Cavalry Division
troopers, Marines and South
Vietnames were taking part in
this biggest offensive in the far
north in nearly a year.
For more than two months the
base in the northwest corner of
South Vietnam has been be
sieged by 16,000 to 20,000 North
Vietnamese troops. Only by per
ilous plane and helicopter
flights have the 6,000 Marines
and 1,000 South Vietnamese
there been supplied and casual
ties removed.
The immediate aim was to
open Route 9 as a supply road to
Khe Sanh. But officers said the
ultimate aim was to bring to
battle the 301 th and 325 C North
Vietnamese divisions around
Khe Sanh.
In the air, informed sources
said a U.S. Navy plane patrol
ling the Gulf of Siam off South
Vietnam's west coast was shot
down Monday by a Cambodian

• Wisconsin Results
MILWAUKEE, Wis. (AP)
Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy, pro

presidential primary, went to
work Wednesday to enhance his
Democratic fortunes in contests
he acknowledged may prove
more difficult.
The Minnesota senator swept
to a Wisconsin primary victory
Tuesday. President Johnson,
whose Sunday rejection of can
didacy stripped the primary of
its major contest, drew 35 per
cent of the Democratic vote.
Richard M. Nixon captured 80
per cent of the smaller Republi
can turnout. He said it showed
Wisconsin would be in the GOP
column when the White House
votes are counted next Nov. 5.
For McCarthy, it was on to
South Bend, Ind., in the state in
which he and Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy, D-N.Y., will meet
head-to-head in a May 7 pri
mary.
"I think that after Indiana
there will be only one candi
date," McCarthy said there.
These were virtually complete
returns in the Wisconsin Demo
cratic primary:
McCarthy 400,098, or 57 per
cent.
Johnson 249,518, for 35 per
cent.
Kennedy, whose name was
not on the ballot, and who ad
vised his supporters to vote for
McCarthy, received 43,207 votes,
a 6 per cent share.

SAIGON (AP) — A push by
20,000 allied troops to shatter
the enemy siege of Khe Sanh
was disclosed Wednesday. With
the relief column last reported
eight miles away, hopes ran
high that the hard-hit Marine
base would be reached soon.
Field reports said the drive
had met little resistance since it
kicked off Monday from Ca Lu,
12 miles east of Khe Sanh. But
blown bridges and landslides on
National Route 9 slowed the ad
vance.
U.S. Ist Cavalry Division
troopers, Marines and South
Vietnames were taking part in
this biggest offensive in the far
north in nearly a year.
For more than two months the
base in the northwest corner of
South Vietnam has been be
sieged by 16,000 to 20,000 North
Vietnamese troops. Only by per
ilous plane and helicopter
flights have the 6,000 Marines
and 1,000 South Vietnamese
there been supplied and casual
ties removed.
The immediate aim was to
open Route 9 as a supply road to
Khe Sanh. But officers said the
ultimate aim was to bring to
battle the 301 th and 325 C North
Vietnamese divisions around
Khe Sanh.
In the air, informed sources
said a U.S. Navy plane patrol
ling the Gulf of Siam off South
Vietnam's west coast was shot
down Monday by a Cambodian
navy boat.
• Wisconsin Results
MILWAUKEE, Wis. (AP)
Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy, pro
pelled by a landslide, 57 per

cent showing in Wisconsin's
presidential primary, went to
work Wednesday to enhance his
Democratic fortunes in contests
he acknowledged may prove
more difficult.
The Minnesota senator swept
to a Wisconsin primary victory
Tuesday. President Johnson,
whose Sunday rejection of can
didacy stripped the primary of
its major contest, drew 35 per
cent of the Democratic vote.
Richard M. Nixon captured 80
per cent of the smaller Republi
can turnout. He said it showed
Wisconsin would be in the GOP
column when the White House
votes are counted next Nov. 5.
For McCarthy, it was on to
South Bend, Ind., in the state in
which he and Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy, D-N.Y., will meet
head-to-head in a May 7 pri
mary.
"I think that after Indiana
there will be only one candi
date," McCarthy said there.
These were virtually complete
returns in the Wisconsin Demo
cratic primary:
McCarthy 400,098, or 57 per
cent.
Johnson 249,518, for 35 per
cent.
Kennedy, whose name was
not on the ballot, and who ad
vised his supporters to vote for
McCarthy, received 43,207 votes,
a 6 per cent share.
• Czech Suicide Probe
PRAGUE (AP) — Twenty
years after the fact, Czechoslo

nesday night that they will in
vcstigate the 1948 "suicide" of
Jan Masaryk, the national lead

er whose death symbolizes the
brutality of Stalin era rule for
millions of his countrymen.
The acting attorney general,
Frantisek Zabransky, confirmed
his office is investigating
charges Masaryk was mur

amid open skepticism about the
police contention that the death
this week of Jozef Brestansky,
an investigator of Stalinist era
crimes, was a suicide.
In another development, Dep

Lomsky resigned Wednesday.
The two formerly were support

Communist party chief, Antonin
Novotnv.
They surrendered their posts
at a meeting of the party's
Central Committee called to dis
cuss personnel changes and a
new action program to carry

cism of his hard-line policies.
• 1,50 Plants Struck
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)—The

The strike, called Monday
against the 82-member Califor

there were no plans to extend

The day before, a spokesman

• Anti-Reagan Slate
LOS ANGELES (AP)—A Re

Reagan's favorite son candidacy
said Wednesday it expects to
qualify for the June 4 presi

Unless the group obtains 18,-
715 signatures on nominating
petitions by 5 p.m. Friday, the
Republican ballot will list only
one slate of delegates—firmly
pledged to Gov. Reagan for
president.
Sponsors of the new group
hope to qualify a delegation
pledged to no candidate but ob
viously at odds with Reagan. It
would be called the "Free
Choice" delegation.
Reagan has said repeatedly
he is not a candidate for pres
ident, and that his favorite-son
candidacy is to preserve party
unity in the state.
"Republicans in California
who want someone other than
Reagan for president should be
given an alternative on the June
ballot," Wilcox said.

• 1,50 Plants Struck
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)—The
Federal Mediation and Concili
ation Service worked Wednes
day to arrange joint meetings
among the principals in a ma
chinists strike affecting 150 Bay
Area manufacturing plants.
The strike, called Monday
against the 82-member Califor
nia Metal Trades Association,
spread to other shops in four
counties and involves 11,000 ma
chinists and 9,000 others who re
fused to cross picket lines.
A spokesman for the AFL
CIO International Association of

Machinists said Wednesday
there were no plans to extend
the strike to 400 Bay Area
firms still operating.
The day before, a spokesman
was quoted as saying other
firms would be struck "one by
one" until the firms agreed to
resume negotiations on union
demands.
• Anti-Reagan Slate
LOS ANGELES (AP)—A Re
publican group opposed to Gov.
Reagan's favorite son candidacy
said Wednesday it expects to
qualify for the June 4 presi
dential primary election.
Unless the group obtains 18,-
715 signatures on nominating
petitions by 5 p.m. Friday, the
Republican ballot will list only
one slate of delegates—firmly
pledged to Gov. Reagan for
president.
Sponsors of the new group
hope to qualify a delegation
pledged to no candidate but ob
viously at odds with Reagan. It
would be called the "Free
Choice" delegation.
Reagan has said repeatedly
he is not a candidate for pres
ident, and that his favorite-son
candidacy is to preserve party
unity in the state.
"Republicans in California
who want someone other than
Reagan for president should be
given an alternative on the June
ballot," Wilcox said.
• Record Stock Vol,
NEW YORK (AP)—Trading
on the New York Stock Ex
change exploded to an all-time
record Wednesday in a burst of
investors' enthusiasm over Viet
nam peace possibilities.
A total of 19,290,000 shares
changed hands and swamped
the exchange's ticker tape.
The volume spurted well
above the record of 17.73 million
shares traded Monday, which
topped the previous mark of
16.41 million shares set Oct. 29,
1929, the day of the historic
market crash.
Hanoi's broadcast of its will
ingness to talk with the United
States about a complete halt of

the bombing of North Vietnam
triggered the powerful reaction.
As trading volume a first
hour record, prices jumped.
However, profit taking and a
closer examination of Hanoi's
intent later resulted in a sub
stantial whittling of the early
gain.
The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials jumped 13.12 points
in the first 90 minutes of trad
ing but closed with a gain of
5.15 points at 869.11.
SAIGON (AP) — A push by
20,000 allied troops to shatter
the enemy siege of Khe Sanh
was disclosed Wednesday. With
the relief column last reported
eight miles away, hopes ran
high that the hard-hit Marine
base would be reached soon.
Field reports said the drive
had met little resistance since it
kicked off Monday from Ca Lu,
12 miles east of Khe Sanh. But
blown bridges and landslides on
National Route 9 slowed the ad
vance.
U.S. Ist Cavalry Division
troopers, Marines and South
Vietnames were taking part in
this biggest offensive in the far
north in nearly a year.
For more than two months the
base in the northwest corner of
South Vietnam has been be
sieged by 16,000 to 20,000 North
Vietnamese troops. Only by per
ilous plane and helicopter
flights have the 6,000 Marines
and 1,000 South Vietnamese
there been supplied and casual
ties removed.
The immediate aim was to
open Route 9 as a supply road to
Khe Sanh. But officers said the
ultimate aim was to bring to
battle the 301 th and 325 C North
Vietnamese divisions around
Khe Sanh.
In the air, informed sources
said a U.S. Navy plane patrol
ling the Gulf of Siam off South
Vietnam's west coast was shot
down Monday by a Cambodian
navy boat.
• Wisconsin Results
MILWAUKEE, Wis. (AP)
Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy, pro
pelled by a landslide, 57 per

cent showing in Wisconsin's
presidential primary, went to
work Wednesday to enhance his
Democratic fortunes in contests
he acknowledged may prove
more difficult.
The Minnesota senator swept
to a Wisconsin primary victory
Tuesday. President Johnson,
whose Sunday rejection of can
didacy stripped the primary of
its major contest, drew 35 per
cent of the Democratic vote.
Richard M. Nixon captured 80
per cent of the smaller Republi
can turnout. He said it showed
Wisconsin would be in the GOP
column when the White House
votes are counted next Nov. 5.
For McCarthy, it was on to
South Bend, Ind., in the state in
which he and Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy, D-N.Y., will meet
head-to-head in a May 7 pri
mary.
"I think that after Indiana
there will be only one candi
date," McCarthy said there.
These were virtually complete
returns in the Wisconsin Demo
cratic primary:
McCarthy 400,098, or 57 per
cent.
Johnson 249,518, for 35 per
cent.
Kennedy, whose name was
not on the ballot, and who ad
vised his supporters to vote for
McCarthy, received 43,207 votes,
a 6 per cent share.
• Czech Suicide Probe
PRAGUE (AP) — Twenty
years after the fact, Czechoslo
vak authorities announced Wed
nesday night that they will in
vcstigate the 1948 "suicide" of
Jan Masaryk, the national lead

er whose death symbolizes the
brutality of Stalin era rule for
millions of his countrymen.
The acting attorney general,
Frantisek Zabransky, confirmed
his office is investigating
charges Masaryk was mur
dered. The announcement came
amid open skepticism about the
police contention that the death
this week of Jozef Brestansky,
an investigator of Stalinist era
