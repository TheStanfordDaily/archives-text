# Legislature To Meet
## 
### 
The Legislature will meet to
night to discuss student mem
bership on the newly-proposed
Academic Council at 7:30 in
room 370.
According to Speaker Michael
Weinstein, the Legislature will
discuss a resolution supporting
the original proposal that stu
dents be represented on the Sen
ate, which has now been revised
to exclude student representa
tives.
The Academic Senate propo
sal is now under consideration
by members of the faculty, and
includes students on the Senate's
subcommittees but not in the
actual Senate.
Weinstein said that they would
also consider two emergency ap
propriations for the "Days of
Concern" and for expenses to
bring black jazz artist Cecil
Taylor to campus.
The results of the winter
quarter Vice Presidential race
will also be ratified, Weinstein
said.
