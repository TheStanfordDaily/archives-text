# Congressional Record Theatre To Show 1868 Johnson Trial
## 
### 
With cries of "Impeach the
President" and "Remove the
traitor" it might well be a New
Left rally. But the hirsute par
ticipants are wearing cutaways,
not sandals and beads, and the
President Johnson they speak
of is Andrew, not Lyndon.
Next week the Theater of the
Congressional Record will give
its fourth presentation of a
new kind of dramatic event
which made its appearance a
year ago at Stanford the
staging of legislative debates as
recorded in both houses of Con
gress.
This latest production, with
performances to be hold Friday
and Saturday, April 12 and 13,
will recreate the 18f>8 debate in
the House of Representatives
which called for the impeach
Tnent of President Andrew John
son for "high crimes and mis
demeanors."
Dressed in period costumes,
the approximately 100 parti
cipants will debate in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium, which will
he transformed into a repliea

of the House chamber. Mem
bers of the audience will act
as gallery participants and
sit with the partisans of their
choice. The atmosphere will
be informal, with bored or im
patient Congressmen harrass
ing their colleagues or even
roaming the House corridors
for a breather.
The brainchild of Speech and
Drama instructor, John Kulsar,
the simulations have focused
on historical legislation which
finds parallels in today's con
troversial political scene.
Though the participants,
drawn from faculty, staff and
students, can match the orator
ical talents of the Senators and
Congressmen, practicality forces
the Theater to produce only the
highlights of the debates, since
these prolific historical figures
often ran on not only for hours,
but for days. The original de
bate on the Conscription Act ran
for six days around the clock.
Kulsar's cutting ran eight and
a half hours. Starting at 10 a.m.
and running past 6:30 p.m. mem

bers of the House came and
spoke, listened, heckled, and gos
siped.
For the upcoming perfor
mance, Kulsar worked with
senior history student Cur
tiss B. Keck to produce a
three-hour script from the ori
ginal twenty-hour debate.
Kulsar hopes to set the au
dience thinking about the con
sequences of the Constitutional
provision for impeachment,
which in this case nearly en
abled Congress to disrupt the
balance of powers. Though the
House voted to impeach the
President by a large majority,
the Senate failed by a single
vote to convict him. A single
vote stood between the conti
nuity of government and a prec
edent which would have allowed
the majority power in partisan
politics to destroy the Chief Ex
ecutive.
Both performances will be at
8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditor
ium. Tickets are available at
Tresidder Union Box Office. The
event is sponsored by Ihe De
partment of Speech and Drama.

ginal twenty-hour debate.
Kulsar hopes to set the au
dience thinking about the con
sequences of the Constitutional
provision for impeachment,
which in this case nearly en
abled Congress to disrupt the
balance of powers. Though the
House voted to impeach the
President by a large majority,
the Senate failed by a single
vote to convict him. A single
vote stood between the conti
nuity of government and a prec
edent which would have allowed
the majority power in partisan
politics to destroy the Chief Ex
ecutive.
Both performances will be at
8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditor
ium. Tickets are available at
Tresidder Union Box Office. The
event is sponsored by Ihe De
partment of Speech and Drama.


TWO CONGRESSMEN CLASH — Gary Salt (left) and Curt K««< k
(right) discuss the pros and cons of the resolution to impeach Presi
dent Andrew Johnson. The reenactment of the Congressional de
bate will be presented by the Theater of the Congressional Record
April 12 and 13 in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
With cries of "Impeach the
President" and "Remove the
traitor" it might well be a New
Left rally. But the hirsute par
ticipants are wearing cutaways,
not sandals and beads, and the
President Johnson they speak
of is Andrew, not Lyndon.
Next week the Theater of the
Congressional Record will give
its fourth presentation of a
new kind of dramatic event
which made its appearance a
year ago at Stanford the
staging of legislative debates as
recorded in both houses of Con
gress.
This latest production, with
performances to be hold Friday
and Saturday, April 12 and 13,
will recreate the 18f>8 debate in
the House of Representatives
which called for the impeach
Tnent of President Andrew John
son for "high crimes and mis
demeanors."
Dressed in period costumes,
the approximately 100 parti
cipants will debate in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium, which will
he transformed into a repliea

of the House chamber. Mem
bers of the audience will act
as gallery participants and
sit with the partisans of their
choice. The atmosphere will
be informal, with bored or im
patient Congressmen harrass
ing their colleagues or even
roaming the House corridors
for a breather.
The brainchild of Speech and
Drama instructor, John Kulsar,
the simulations have focused
on historical legislation which
finds parallels in today's con
troversial political scene.
Though the participants,
drawn from faculty, staff and
students, can match the orator
ical talents of the Senators and
Congressmen, practicality forces
the Theater to produce only the
highlights of the debates, since
these prolific historical figures
often ran on not only for hours,
but for days. The original de
bate on the Conscription Act ran
for six days around the clock.
Kulsar's cutting ran eight and
a half hours. Starting at 10 a.m.
and running past 6:30 p.m. mem

bers of the House came and
spoke, listened, heckled, and gos
siped.
For the upcoming perfor
mance, Kulsar worked with
senior history student Cur
tiss B. Keck to produce a
three-hour script from the ori
ginal twenty-hour debate.
