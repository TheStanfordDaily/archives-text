Ellis, a trumpeter, formed the
orchestra in 1%4. It currently
is a leading jazz feature of Co
lumbia Records, where its "Elec

trie Bath" album is a national
best-seller.
Rhythm is Ellis' prime fas
cination, and to emphasize it
the orchestra features four
percussionists and three bas
ses. This section pares the
exotic meters tliat Ellis con
cocts in such times as 7/4, 9/4,

3'/2 /4, 19/1 and on up 85/4.
For instance, the Ellis or
chestra plays material in what
it calls a "traditional 19" with
the beat subdivided 33-222-1-
222 which, Ellis says, is the
combination of 19 which
swing's the most.
Ellis' other feature is tasteful

exploration ol the aesthetic po
tential of electronic amplifica
tion. Ellis operates an electric
console to create a variety of
effects, including tape echo de
lay, amplification of instruments
in the sax-woodwind section, and
use of an electric keyboard in
strument.
