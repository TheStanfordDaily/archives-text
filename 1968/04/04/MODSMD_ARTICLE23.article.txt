# Avoiding Vietnam A Challenge
## 
### 
Most students try to avoid
the draft. However, what does
one do once he has failed and
has been inducted?
A recent article in the Wall
Stnvt Journal illustrated the
means which some firmer col
lege students have used to avoid
going to Vietnam. The ploys are
often quite unusual.
One soldier had a doctor re
move his spleen, a fairly unim
portant organ. He was then told
by the army medics that he
could not g<> to Vietnam because
of the loss of his spleen, an or
gan which would replace red
blood cells if he were to contact
malaria.
Not many young men would
go as far as he did to avoid
Vietnam, but soldiers increas
ingly an- devising other exotic
schemes to spend their two
years' service In stateside
posts.
Although military officials say
they can't estimate how many
soldiers are using their wits
to avoid combat duty, the prac
tice apparently is widespread.
"Give me a guy with a college

degree, a fast tongue and a
poker face, and its better than
fifty fifty I'll find a way for him
never to go," says a personnel
specialist at one base.
The ploys are many and var
ied. Perhaps the ultimate one
was developed by a draftee
from Festus, Mo. The plan:
Find an orphan in the Army
who wants to go to Vietnam and
have your parents adopt him.
Army regulations say that
only one memlier of a family
can Iv? in Vietnam at a time
(unless the others volunteer),
so the natural son wouldn't
have to go.
That scheme hasn't been tried
yet, but several others have.
These include:
• The Christian Science Ploy.
A 23-year-old Virginian received
Vietnam orders and was told to
report for pre-shipinent inocu
lations. When he announced he
had been converted to Christian
Science and refused to take
either shots or pills, he was
waved away by frustrated doc
tors.
• The Crazy Letter Ploy. A
corporal from Brooklyn wrote
letters to Sen. Robert Kennedy
and Sen. Jacob Javits, Gov. Nel
son .Rockefeller, his Congress
man and several other promi
nent officials, claiming he pre
ferred suicide to Vietnam and
pointing out the effects of his
death on his mother. Two weeks
later a Senatorial aide notified
him his Vietnam orders had
been canceled.
• The Card-Burning Ploy. A
basic trainee faked a picture of
himself burning a draft card on
the Berkeley campus and sent
it to his commanding general
with an anonymous note. A
security check was ordered, and
the soldier's two years were
drawing peacefully to a close
by the time the dust had set
tled.
• Tho LSD Ploy. A glib
Clevelander strolled into his post
psychiatrist's office, claiming
numerous LSD exepriences had
unbalanced his mind. Regular
visits thereafter assured his
stay at a Midwestern post.
Confusion is Ihe key to
nearly every ploy. Army regu
lations are voluminous, and If
your records get fouled up,
you're in the clear.
Company clerks at Fort Ben
ning, Ga., estimate that a sixth
of the college graduates in their
companies wriggle out of their
Vietnam orders.
The college graduate qualifi
cation is significant. These are

the soldiers who are most likely
to hold an administrative job,
which is the best place to throw
a monkey wrench into the
works. Also, these men gener
ally have the intelligence and
poise to carry off a ploy.
"I can't wait until they start
drafting grad students," says
one Stanford graduate who
loves to fight the Army, "and
the whole Army is tilled with
people like us."
The Army is already filled
with draftees; that's one reason
the Vietnam-dodging works. Al
most every successful ploy is
b;ised on paperwork: The realms
of directives, reports and appli
cations that define, grant and
deny Vietnam eligibility.
Not only are the clerks who
handle these papers draftees,
but their supervisors also are
generally draftees or two-year
only lieutenants who occasion
ally are willing to look the other
way.
Veteran Vietnam-dodgers
assert the ponderous Army
bureaucracy is easy to outfox.
Arcane notations typed on a
morning report by a coojjera
tive clerk can grant overseas
immunity; the code "7-2", for
instance, means that a soldier
is ineligible for overseas duty
for various reasons. Not even
a conscientious scrutiny could
easily track down such fid
dling with records.
For most soldiers, the crucial
consideration is the margin be
tween the time they have left
in the Army and the 180-day
minimum Vietnam tour. An ef
fective ploy should fill as much
of that period as possible.
Also, the Army doesn't like
to send a man to Vietnam even
if he has 180 days left if there
is a chance it will have to bring
him back right away. Soldiers
capitalize on this by applying
for special training important
enough to keep the Army from
shipping them overseas.
Thus, an application for flight
school can keep a man stateside
up to ten months waiting for
his class to begin, at which time
he "changes his mind" about
wanting to attend.
The new ploys are being
tried because the older, less
sophisticated ones don't work
any more. Asthma, bad hacks,
bad eyes and flat feet won't
budge any Army doctor. A
sergeant who shot himself In
the leg is now recovered and
on his way to Vietnam.
Already there: A Pfc. who
took every pill he could find
before staggering into the over
seas replacement depot at Oak
land. Medics simply pumped his
stomach and pointed him to
ward Vietnam.
Bribery also is out. Personnel
clerks who will risk court-mar
tial to help a friend of a friend
disdain financial offers. Going
over the hill won't help either.
When he returns, the AWOL
soldier is often dismayed to find
he is sent to the front instead
of the stockade.
Friendships are important in
the modern-day ploy. It some

times helps if a friendly clerk
will alter dates on various forms
for you. And it helps to know in
advance that people in your
specialty are about to be called
to Vietnam; forewarned is fore
armed, and you can change your
job classification — say, from
supply clerk to truck driver.
Why do draft*H's plot their
ploys? Most admit that fear
of Iwing killed or wounded
or unwillingness to leave a
comfortable situation are
more important than pure
[Htlitical opposition to the war.
But there Is also an element
of revenue.
"They forced me to join the
Army," explains a Missouri
youth now at Fort Knox, "and
they can make me do anything
they want. Now, I'm causing a
little trouble for them."
