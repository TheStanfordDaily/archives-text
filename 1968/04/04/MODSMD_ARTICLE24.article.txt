# Oakland Rests Uneasy
## Seale, Newton Arrests Stir Protest 
### DAVID BERSON College Press Service 
► Oakland is a growing indus
trial town. It looks like most
others in America, now with a
gmokey haze hanging overhead,
and a decrepit Negro ghetto
underneath.
Across the Bay, San Fran
cisco is cosmopolitan and stylish
and next door Berkeley is in
teresting. But Oakland can be
hard and this summer or per
haps any day, it could become
very hot.
A dangerous chess match be
tween black and white is being
played here, no longer confined
to back room, but not yet burst
ing out into the streets.

The buttons say "HUEY
MUST BE SET FREE," and the
leaflet reads, "To some he is
an accused cop-killer. But to
those who know him, Huey
Newton is a brilliant and force
ful leader of the black com
munity."
In October of 1966, Newton
and Bobby Seale formed the
Black Panther Party for Self
Defense. Newton had com
pleted four years of college
with a brilliant record and had
done a stint in law school.
Several nights a week, he and
Seale followed patrol cars
through the black ghetto.
Whenever the patrol car stop
ped to make an arrest, the

Black Panther's stopped, and
carefully remaining a legal
distance from the place of ar
rest, Newton and Seale ad
vised the resident of his legal
righta.
A year later, in the pre-dawn
hours on an Oakland sidestreet,
a policeman was shot and killed,
another wounded, and Huey P.
Newton went to the hosiptal
with a bullet In his stomach and
then on to jail.
There have since been thous
ands of versions of who did the
shooting, but to the Black Pan
thers what really happened is
clear. "It was the Oakland Pig
Department who have attempt
ed to harass, intimidate, and fi
nally kill Huey P. Newton ever

since he started the Party in
1966," reads the bulletin. "It
was the late Officer Frey who
was following Huey P. Newton
for 20 minutes prior to arrest
ing him on a traffic violation at
5 a.m. on the morning of Oc
tober, that called in a second
car to cover Huey, and that was
responsible for putting Huey in
a crossfire between two pigs."
Newton was charged with
murder, and kidnapping a pass
ing citizen he allegedly com
pelled to drive him to a friend's
house after the shooting. His
trial is set for May 6.
Newton's arrest has rever
berated through the radical
community here and has be
come a rallying point for pro
test in the Bay Area. White
radicals in the Peace, and
Freedom Movement joined in
a coalition with the Panthers
for a "free trial for Huey,"
later changed to freeing New
ton unconditionally. In ex
change for PFM support, the
Panthers agreed to help reg
ister blacks in the Movement.
But the coalition was shaken
when the Panthers announced a
merger with the Student Non-
Violent Coordinating Commit
tee (SNCC) in February of this
year. The militant SNCC line
has undoubtedly been a contrib
uting factor to the slowly
dwindling membership of Cali
fornia's peace party.
The merger was announced at

a rally for Newton's defense
fund. Stokely Carmichael was
named Prime Minister of Afro-
America that evening, after for
mer SNCC Chairman James
Forman told the integrated
crowd of 5,000, "If Huey Newton
is assassinated there will be in
stant retribution." Then Eld
ridge Cleaver, Black Panther
Minister of Information, an
nounced that Newton had
agreed to run for Congress on
the PFM ticket if the party sup
ports the Panther platform.
The next move came from
the police a week later when
Berkeley officers, armed with
shotguns, arrested Bobby
Seale at 3 a.m. In his home.
After entering without search
or arrest warrants, they found
several unregistered weapons,
and arrested the Black Pan
ther chairman on a charge of
conspiracy to commit murder.
The next day the conspiracy
charge was dropped and Seale
was indicted only for gun vio
lations. Bond was set at
$11,000, but was later lowered.
"I asked them for their war
rant," said Seale. "They said
they didn't need one. They drag
ged my wife out of bed and
slammed me around. They put
the handcuffs on us and then
they took the house apart."
Seale charged that three white
men assisting the police were
members of the Minutemen or
ganization.

► Oakland is a growing indus
trial town. It looks like most
others in America, now with a
gmokey haze hanging overhead,
and a decrepit Negro ghetto
underneath.
Across the Bay, San Fran
cisco is cosmopolitan and stylish
and next door Berkeley is in
teresting. But Oakland can be
hard and this summer or per

very hot.
A dangerous chess match be

played here, no longer confined

MUST BE SET FREE," and the
leaflet reads, "To some he is
an accused cop-killer. But to
those who know him, Huey
Newton is a brilliant and force
ful leader of the black com
munity."
In October of 1966, Newton
and Bobby Seale formed the
Black Panther Party for Self
Defense. Newton had com
pleted four years of college
with a brilliant record and had
done a stint in law school.
Several nights a week, he and
Seale followed patrol cars
through the black ghetto.
Whenever the patrol car stop
ped to make an arrest, the

Black Panther's stopped, and
carefully remaining a legal
distance from the place of ar
rest, Newton and Seale ad
vised the resident of his legal
righta.
A year later, in the pre-dawn
hours on an Oakland sidestreet,
a policeman was shot and killed,
another wounded, and Huey P.
Newton went to the hosiptal
with a bullet In his stomach and
then on to jail.
There have since been thous
ands of versions of who did the
shooting, but to the Black Pan
thers what really happened is
clear. "It was the Oakland Pig
Department who have attempt
ed to harass, intimidate, and fi
nally kill Huey P. Newton ever

since he started the Party in
1966," reads the bulletin. "It
was the late Officer Frey who
was following Huey P. Newton
for 20 minutes prior to arrest
ing him on a traffic violation at
5 a.m. on the morning of Oc
tober, that called in a second
car to cover Huey, and that was
responsible for putting Huey in
a crossfire between two pigs."
Newton was charged with
murder, and kidnapping a pass
ing citizen he allegedly com
pelled to drive him to a friend's
house after the shooting. His
trial is set for May 6.
Newton's arrest has rever
berated through the radical
community here and has be
come a rallying point for pro
test in the Bay Area. White
radicals in the Peace, and
Freedom Movement joined in
a coalition with the Panthers
for a "free trial for Huey,"
later changed to freeing New
ton unconditionally. In ex
change for PFM support, the
Panthers agreed to help reg
ister blacks in the Movement.
But the coalition was shaken
when the Panthers announced a
merger with the Student Non-
Violent Coordinating Commit
tee (SNCC) in February of this
year. The militant SNCC line
has undoubtedly been a contrib
uting factor to the slowly
dwindling membership of Cali
fornia's peace party.
The merger was announced at

a rally for Newton's defense
fund. Stokely Carmichael was
named Prime Minister of Afro-
America that evening, after for
mer SNCC Chairman James
Forman told the integrated
crowd of 5,000, "If Huey Newton
is assassinated there will be in
stant retribution." Then Eld
ridge Cleaver, Black Panther
Minister of Information, an
nounced that Newton had
agreed to run for Congress on
the PFM ticket if the party sup
ports the Panther platform.
The next move came from
the police a week later when
Berkeley officers, armed with
shotguns, arrested Bobby
Seale at 3 a.m. In his home.
After entering without search
or arrest warrants, they found

► Oakland is a growing indus
trial town. It looks like most
others in America, now with a
gmokey haze hanging overhead,
and a decrepit Negro ghetto
underneath.
Across the Bay, San Fran
cisco is cosmopolitan and stylish
and next door Berkeley is in
teresting. But Oakland can be
hard and this summer or per
haps any day, it could become
very hot.
A dangerous chess match be
tween black and white is being
played here, no longer confined
to back room, but not yet burst
ing out into the streets.

The buttons say "HUEY
MUST BE SET FREE," and the
leaflet reads, "To some he is
an accused cop-killer. But to
those who know him, Huey
Newton is a brilliant and force
ful leader of the black com
munity."
In October of 1966, Newton
and Bobby Seale formed the
Black Panther Party for Self
Defense. Newton had com
pleted four years of college
with a brilliant record and had
done a stint in law school.
Several nights a week, he and
Seale followed patrol cars
through the black ghetto.
Whenever the patrol car stop
ped to make an arrest, the

Black Panther's stopped, and
carefully remaining a legal
distance from the place of ar
rest, Newton and Seale ad
vised the resident of his legal
righta.
A year later, in the pre-dawn
hours on an Oakland sidestreet,
a policeman was shot and killed,
another wounded, and Huey P.
Newton went to the hosiptal
with a bullet In his stomach and
then on to jail.
There have since been thous
ands of versions of who did the
shooting, but to the Black Pan
thers what really happened is
clear. "It was the Oakland Pig
Department who have attempt
ed to harass, intimidate, and fi
nally kill Huey P. Newton ever

since he started the Party in
1966," reads the bulletin. "It
was the late Officer Frey who
was following Huey P. Newton
for 20 minutes prior to arrest
ing him on a traffic violation at
5 a.m. on the morning of Oc
tober, that called in a second
car to cover Huey, and that was
responsible for putting Huey in
a crossfire between two pigs."
Newton was charged with
murder, and kidnapping a pass
ing citizen he allegedly com
pelled to drive him to a friend's
house after the shooting. His
trial is set for May 6.
Newton's arrest has rever
berated through the radical
community here and has be
come a rallying point for pro
test in the Bay Area. White
radicals in the Peace, and
Freedom Movement joined in
a coalition with the Panthers
for a "free trial for Huey,"
later changed to freeing New
ton unconditionally. In ex
change for PFM support, the
Panthers agreed to help reg
ister blacks in the Movement.
But the coalition was shaken
when the Panthers announced a
merger with the Student Non-
Violent Coordinating Commit
tee (SNCC) in February of this
year. The militant SNCC line
has undoubtedly been a contrib
uting factor to the slowly
dwindling membership of Cali
fornia's peace party.
The merger was announced at

a rally for Newton's defense
fund. Stokely Carmichael was
named Prime Minister of Afro-
America that evening, after for
mer SNCC Chairman James
Forman told the integrated
crowd of 5,000, "If Huey Newton
is assassinated there will be in
stant retribution." Then Eld
ridge Cleaver, Black Panther
Minister of Information, an

agreed to run for Congress on
the PFM ticket if the party sup
ports the Panther platform.
