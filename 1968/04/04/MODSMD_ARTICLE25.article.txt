# Volunteers Say Peace Corps Silenced Anti-War Sentiments
## 
### WALTER GRANT College Press Service 
, When Vice President Hubert
Humphrey visited Africa early
'this year, a group of Peace
Corps volunteers in Liberia
wanted to meet with him to
'discuss their sentiments against
jthe war in Vietnam.
' The volunteers were told by
! a top Peace Corps official in
Liberia that any comment by
them —either public or private—
on Vietnam in the presence of
the Vice President would result
in their immediate termination
from the Peace Corps.
Their story, made public by
. a letter to the editor in a re
cent issue of the New Repub
lic, is one example of whiy
many students today are hesi
tating to become part of a
program.
The fact that an increasing
number of young people think
they would lose their freedom
of speech by joining the Peace
Corps is supported by a recent
Louis Harris survey. The sur
vey showed about 20 percent of
college seniors expressed this
fear, compared with only two
percent a year ago.
The survey was taken after a
major free speech issue involv
ing the Corps last summer. The
incident occurred when a group
of volunteers in Santiago circu
lated the "Negotiations Now"
petition protesting the U.S. po
sition in Vietnam.
Corps officials told the volun

teers to withdraw their names
or submit their resignations.
Volunteers also were told they
could not identify themselves as
working for the Peace Corps
when writing for the American
press.
One volunteer in Chile, Bruce
Murray, wrote a letter to Peace
Corps Director Jack Vaughn
protesting the action. Murray's
letter was subsequently printed
in the Chilean press, after which
he was called to Washington
and notified he was being dis
missed as a volunteer. Corps
officials said Murray defied a
standard policy that volunteers
not become involved in "local
political issues."
After the controversy
over Murray's dismissal be
came widespread, Vaughn's
office backed down on the new
policy and said volunteers will
be free to write "individual
letters" to officials and news
papers In the U.S. and "to
identify themselves as volun
teers.
The Peace Corps is still try
ing to recover from the Murray
incident. Vauhn now emphasizes
the "great freedom" which vol
unteers have. "We don't tell
volunteers what they can or
can't discuss, and we don't in
tend to," he said in an inter
view. "We send the volunteers
out to carry a message accord
ing to what they believe in, not
to shut up."
The Peace Corps, however,
stiil asks that volunteers not

become involved in the politics
of their host country. "If volun
teers want to speak on civil
rights, politics, the draft, or the
war, it's okay with us," Vaughn
said. "We only ask that volun
teers consider in advance how
their actions or statements will
affect their host country and
their own eeffctiveness in work
ing with all of the local people."
