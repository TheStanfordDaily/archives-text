# Anti-Draft Protest Stresses Politics
## 
### 
Stop the Draft WeeK will hold
a meeting tonight at 8:00 in
Tresidder 270-271 to organize
participation by the Stanford
community in the April Stop the
Draft Week. This meeting will
discuss the political motivation
for the demonstrations and how
they will be integrated into local
anti-war activities, as well as
how the Induction Center dem
onstration will be organized.
This Stop the Draft Week dif
fers from the first last October
in several respects. First, there
is only one demonstration
planned at the Oakland Induc
tion Center. It will be on Tues
day, April 23; and it will take
the form of a street rally at the
Induction Center from 6:30 to
9:30 a.m. followed by a march
to the county jail in support of
Huey Newton.
On Wednesday, April 24, there
will be local anti-draft demon
strations directed at draft boards
and the businesses of draft
board members.
A Stop the Draft Week
spokesman said, "It is our be
lief that calling for a rally
rather than a street demon
stration like the one in Octo
ber will minimize the chance
of violence, ALso, a rally of
fers the added advantage that

it emphasizes the politics of
the demonstration rather than
the form."
Jack Gerson, one of Stanford's
representatives to the steering
committee, elaborated on the
two political foci of the demon
stration. He said, "It is impor
tant to emphasize the dual na
ture of this Stop the Draft
Week. We support both the
struggle of the Vietnamese peo
ple for self-determination and
the struggle of Black people
within the United States.
"Our dedication to the second
part of this political program
has become all the more impor
tant since Johnson's statement
of non-candidacy. Summer has
already begun, and none of the
establishment presidential can
didates offers any real solutions
for the problems of racism and
exploitation inside the United
States.
"Similarly, none of the can
didates — including McCarthy
and Kennedy—are opposed to
U.S. imperialism and exploita
tion in the rest of the world."
"The only hope is to build in
dependent movements respon
sive to the needs of the Ameri
can people like Stop the Draft
Week and the Peace and Free
dom Party," Gerson said.
