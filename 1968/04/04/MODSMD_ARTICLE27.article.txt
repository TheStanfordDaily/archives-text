# Wolin To Join Faculty
## 
### 
Prof. Sheldon S. Wolin, 45,
one of America's most distin
guished historians of political
thought and one of the most
popular teachers at the Univer
sity of California, Berkeley, wiTl
join the Stanford faculty next
September as professor of social
thought and institutions.
In his new position, Prof.
Wolin will teach both graduate
and undergraduate courses in

political science, history, and
the humanities.
He has been widely acclaimed
for his major work, "Politics
and Vision: Continuity and In
novation in Western Political
Thought," which attempts to re
turn political theory to that level
of analysis which, in his words,
"deals with what is general and
integrative to men, a life of
common involvements."
Wolin, a native of Chicago,
was educated at Oberlin and
Harvard. He spent a year study
ing at Magdalen College, Oxforn,
and taught at Oberlin before
coming to UC-Berkeley in 1962.
His colleagues view him as a
scholar whose interests move
across the traditional compart
ments of learning and who is
concerned with the investigation
of the premises of the various
social and cultural sciences.
