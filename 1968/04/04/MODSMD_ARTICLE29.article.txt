## The
						Fall Of The Hawk 
### Gary Cavalli 
It's not often that a third place team beats a division champion
in the NBA playoffs, yet that is exactly what happened Tuesday
night when the Warriors beat the Hawks 111-106 to clinch their
best-of-seven semi final series four games to two. The high-riding
Warriors now move into the Western Division finals against Los
Angeles.
To most observers, the Hawks were considered shoe-ins over
the injury-riddled Warriors, and by all rights, they should have
been. The St. Louis quintet won seven out of the eight games
played between the two clubs during th regular season.
The team that upset the Hawks during the past nine days is
a far cry from the team which performed for Franklin Mieuli's
franchise during the highly successful 1966-67 season. That ball
club, upon which Mieuli hoped to build a basketball dynasty,
easily claimed the championship of the West.
Last year's Warrior starting lineup consisted of A 1 Attles and
Paul Neumann at guard, Nate Thurmond at center, and Rick
Barry and Tom Meschery at forward. Only one of these five
(Attles) started Wednesday night against St. Louis.
Besides losing Mechery in the expansion draft, the Cable Car
crew lost the great Thurmond for the second half of the '68 sea
son to a leg injury, while Neumann and Barry parted with pro
ball altogether.
Neumann, of course, retired to coach at Stanford, while the
dapper Barry — after jumping leagues to join Oakland of the
infant ABA — was forced by a court injunction to sit out a year
and is spending his time off starring in TV commercials and sink
ing baskets for the KYA Oneders.
Right about now the Hawks are probably asking themselves
how the present version of the Warriors could have whipped them
so convincingly, especially in view of Thurmond's absence.
The answer is not a simple one. There was the courageous play
of Attles, with his daring thefts and poised floor generalship: the
unbelievable shooting of ex-Hawk Jeff Mullins; the aggressive
rebounding job by Thurmond's fill-in Clyde Lee; the gutty per
formance of injury-wracked Jimmy King; the fire and steadying
influence of old-pro Rudy Laßusso; and the timely shooting and
offensive board work of Fred Hetzel.
But perhaps the two things that turned the tide In the Warriors
favor were bench strength and the enormous amount of pride that
Coach Bill Sharman has instilled into his ballclub.
When one of the starters needed a rest or got into foul trouble
during the series, Sharman countered with rookie Bill Turner,
second-year man Joe Ellis from USF, or the surprising Bob War
lick. Turner and Ellis, with great leaping ability and scoring
strength inside, were instrumental in the Warriors' first two wins.
Warlick, who shot 57 per cent for the series and scored over 20
points in three games, always semed to grab the hot hand in the
clutch.
Pride can make people do funny things. It helped the Warriors
beat St. Louis. By impressing his club with the fact that they were
good enough to beat the heavily-favored Hawks, Sharman had
his charges readier than bandits at Fort Knox.
An elated Warlick summed up the Warrior spirit after Tues
day's victory: "We were really up for this series, and we're ready
to go all the way to the championship." Now all Warlick has to do
is convince Los Angeles and Philadelphia.
