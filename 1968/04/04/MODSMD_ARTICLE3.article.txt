# N. Vietnam Wants To Talk; Johnson Flying To Hawaii
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Pres
ident Johnson is flying to Hono
lulu Thursday to confer with
U.S. officials on the war in Viet
nam, including a North Vietna
mese offer to establish contact
"so that talks may start."
In announcing this plan Wed
nesday, Johnson said "we will
establish contact with the repre
sentatives of North Vietnam."
The Hanoi offer signified a
potential breakthrough in the
long impasse over getting:
talks going between the op
posing sides in the Vietnam
war.
Johnson announced that "con
sultations with the government
of South Vietnam and our other
allies are now taking place."
The weekend conference in
Hawaii seems certain to delve
into the new situation stemming
from the prospect of face-to-face
meetings between U.S. and Com
munist North Vietnamese repre
sentatives.
The dramatic new turn of
events in the Southeast Asia
war began with a surprise broad
cast from Hanoi indicating a
shift away from North Viet
nam's previously tough stand
against negotiations while un
dergoing bombardment by U.S.
planes.
In a radioed statement re
sponding to Johnson's latest of
fer for talks last Sunday night,
the North Vietnamese de
nounced the United States for
not having fully and uncondi
tionally ended the bombing,
even though Johnson had scaled
back the air attacks.
But the Hanoi broadcast
nonetheless declared North

Vietnam's "readiness to ap
point its representatives to
contact the U.S. representa
tive with a view to determin
ing with the American side
the unconditional cessation of
the United States bombing:
raids and all other acts of war
against the Democratic Repub
lic of Vietnam so that talks
may start."
The North Vietnamese state
ment dropped none of the Com
munists demands for a U.S. pull
out which have been unaccepta
ble to Washington in the past.
Nonetheless administration of
ficials apparently decided it
would be a step forward to at
least get into discussions with
the Reds, even if the fighting
goes on.
The Pentagon said Secretary
of Defense Clark M. Clifford and
Gen. Earle G. Wheeler, chair

man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
will accompany the President to
Hawaii.
A headquarters source in
Saigon reported C.en. William
Westmoreland is expected
to fly to Honolulu on Thurs
day or Friday to meet with
President Johnson and other
American officials on moves
toward peace talks w i th
North Vietnam.
Johnson met urgently with his
top advisers after U.S. monitors
picked up the North Vietnamese
broadcast Wednesday morning.
Late in the afternoon the Presi
dent went before radio and tele
vision and announced his plans
to fly to the Pacific.
The President did not specify
how contact would be set up
with North Vietnamese repre
sentatives, but on Sunday he
had named senior diplomats W.

Averell Harriman and Llewel
lyn E. Thompson for such a
mission.
In informal remarks earlier
Johnson said the Hanoi state
ment was under study and add
ed: "We are very interested in
it and if it says what some peo
ple think it says, it is something;
that we are interested in."
White House press secre
tary George Christian said the
Hawaiian session was set up
as an entirely American meet
ing, with no representatives
of any other country expected.
Nevertheless he said he did
not rule out completely the pos
sibility that someone from some
other nation might turn up, as
has happened at past confer
ences.
But Christian said the session
in Hawaii is no peace meeting.
And, he said, "it is not a sum
mit or anything like that."
The press secretary said he
did not know the complete
makeup of the delegation that
would accomapny the President
from here or that would come in
from Vietnam.
He did say that Secretary of
State Dean Rusk, now in New
Zealand for a session of foreign
ministers of the Southeast Asia
allies, probably would go to
Honolulu.
While Johnson has invited
President Nguyen Van Thieu of

South Vietnam to the United
States, Christian said that
meant continental United States
and not Hawaii.
Following receipt of the Hanoi
statement, Johnson reviewed
the situation with senior advis
ers at a White House luncheon
conference.
