# Frosh Trackmen Host Foothill JC
## 
### 
Stanford's frosh track team
entertains Foothill JC today on
Angell Field, with the field
events and the 440-yard relay
beginning at 4:00.
Coach Jerry Barland considers
this season's squad to be the
"best balanced frosh team in
several years," and the statistics
would seem to bear him out.
Hurdler Rick Tipton's 14.3
clocking in the 120 high hur
dles broke Bob Mathias' and
Tom Kommers long-standing
record of 14.5. Tipton also
helps comprise the 440-yard
relay team, which has turned
in a time of 41.9 seconds, only
three-tenths of a second off
Stanford's freshman mark.
Sprinters Charles Francis and
Kevin McNair, along with inter
mediate hurdler Randy White,
make up the other three fourths
of the relay quartet.
White set a record recently by
turning in a 54.7 clocking, one of
the best IM hurdle marks in

Stanford history, varsity In
cluded.
Versatile Jim Kauffman will
be handling the 440, long jump
and triple jump for Stanford.
Barland's distance men are
Duncan Mac Donald, Pete Fair
child and Don Kardong.
