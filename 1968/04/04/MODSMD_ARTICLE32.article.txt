# Unearned Run Gives Stanford 6-5 Triumph
## 
### PETER DUFFY 
The Stanford Indians came up
with an unearned run in the
bottom of the tenth inning to
down Cal State of Hayward 6-5
at the Sunken Diamond Tues
day.
Held scoreless and behind by
four runs in the sixth frame,
the Tribe scored once in the
sixth and four times in the sev
enth to take a 5-4 load. Bob
Boone drove in three of the
runs with a bases-loaded double
in the seventh.
With a f>-4 lead, ace reliever
Frank Klinger came on to
pitch for Stanford. Klinger set
Hayward down In the eighth
and retired the first two bat
ters he faced In the ninth.
Then with an 0-2 count on
Hayward catcher Greg Popst,
Klinger fired a fastball that

Popst popped out of the park,
tying the score at 5 apiece.
The Tribe didn't soem too con
cerned about the situation, how
ever. Playing in a nonchalant,
almost lakadaisical manner,
they staged a rally in the tenth
to pull it out.
Mike Schomakor doubled with
one out, and advanced to third
on Mike Amirato's single. Ron
Shotts drew a walk to load the
bases. Bob Edie then grounded
to third, but the third baseman
threw the ball past the catcher,
allowing Schomaker to score
the winning run.
About the only bright spot
in a long and lackluster game
was the return of Stanford's
talented righthander Don
Rose. Rose, who sat out last
quarter, made his debut Tues
day, as he pitched the first

three innings.
Rose allowed only one hit and
an unearned run in his short
stint, as he appeared to be
throwing hard with the ball
moving well. Once Rose is ready
to go the full nine innings, it
will strengthen the Tribe start :
ing staff immeasurably.
At this early stage in the
baseball season, Stanford is
rated number two in the coun
try behind Arizona State. This
afternoon the Indians will meet
USF at the Sunken Diamond at
3:00. They open the Pacific-8
season here April 19 against
UCLA.

Held scoreless and behind by
four runs in the sixth frame,
the Tribe scored once in the
sixth and four times in the sev
enth to take a 5-4 load. Bob
Boone drove in three of the
runs with a bases-loaded double
in the seventh.
With a f>-4 lead, ace reliever
Frank Klinger came on to
pitch for Stanford. Klinger set
Hayward down In the eighth
and retired the first two bat
ters he faced In the ninth.
Then with an 0-2 count on
Hayward catcher Greg Popst,
Klinger fired a fastball that

Popst popped out of the park,
tying the score at 5 apiece.
The Tribe didn't soem too con
cerned about the situation, how
ever. Playing in a nonchalant,
almost lakadaisical manner,
they staged a rally in the tenth
to pull it out.
Mike Schomakor doubled with
one out, and advanced to third
on Mike Amirato's single. Ron
Shotts drew a walk to load the
bases. Bob Edie then grounded
to third, but the third baseman
threw the ball past the catcher,
allowing Schomaker to score
the winning run.
About the only bright spot
in a long and lackluster game
was the return of Stanford's
talented righthander Don
Rose. Rose, who sat out last
quarter, made his debut Tues
day, as he pitched the first

three innings.
Rose allowed only one hit and
an unearned run in his short
stint, as he appeared to be
throwing hard with the ball
moving well. Once Rose is ready
to go the full nine innings, it
will strengthen the Tribe start :
ing staff immeasurably.
At this early stage in the
baseball season, Stanford is
rated number two in the coun
try behind Arizona State. This
afternoon the Indians will meet
USF at the Sunken Diamond at
3:00. They open the Pacific-8
season here April 19 against
UCLA.
