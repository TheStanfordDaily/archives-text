# Nairobi West?
## East Palo Alto Wants African Name 
### 
The East Palo Alto Municipal
Council voted 3 to 1 Monday
night to hold a public hearing
"at an appropriate time" on the
proposal to change the name of
East Palo Alto to Nairobi.
A suggestion that the new
name by Nairobi, after the capi
tal of Kenya, will be included
in an application for a federal
model cities grant.
Donald Reid of East Palo Alto,
a technical writer for a Palo
Alto Electronics firm, called for

the "Africanism" at a public
hearing on the model cities ap
plication in Ravenswood High
School.
He said, "The County of San
Mateo and the East Palo Alto
community can take a giant step
towards helping to create in the
hearts of Black Americans a
feeling of belonging to America
and being a prideful part of
America.
"Therefore we suggest that
immediate steps be taken to
change the name of this commu

nity from East Palo Alto to Nai
robi."
Councilwoman Paula Preuss
called his statement "beautiful."
"If a way can be found to
change It, that's great," she said.
East Palo Alto is unincorpo
rated and the name is informal.
The similarity of the name to
Palo Alto causes confusion. Al
though the two areas border
each other, they are in different
counties.
Reid said East Palo Alto
should change its name before
submitting the application for a
federal grant. He thought that
the chances of winning it would
improve.

There was not time since the
application had to go to the
Menlo Park City Council that
night, to the board of supervi
sors April 11, and had to be
mailed to the federal govern
ment by April 15. It was voted
to hold a public hearing.
The $113,000 grant would
cover both unincorporated East
Palo Alto and eastern Menlo
Park. Application is being made
jointly by Menlo Park and San
Mateo County.
Nearly 90 per cent of the proj
ects cost is for salaries and
fringe benefits. Four top posi
tions would pay from $9,000 to
$15,000 annually.
