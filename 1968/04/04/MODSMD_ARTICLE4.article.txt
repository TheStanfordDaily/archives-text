who are interested in partici
pating in discussions or panels
in the various living groups.
In addition, according to Mike
Weinstein, the group is gather
ing names of "more articulate
students from the left and right
to go and participate in the dis
cussions."
Organizers of the series of ad
dresses, panels, and discussio' s
are enthusiastic about the faci
that the program offers an un
precedented chance for students,
faculty, and administration to
talk together.
However, at the Tuesday
meeting with house presidents,
initial student response sug
gested that residence participa
tion might be below the ex
pected level.
Pete Hansen, resident assis
tant at Durand House ad
mitted that he didn't want to
sound negative, but added he
was "a little worried about
the second week end of spring
quarter" for such a program.
Representatives from Lagun
flta also added that students
there seemed uninterested in
discussing anything connected
with the war.
Barry Askinas, one of the two
student members of the steer
ing committee indicated that he
was fairly sure "that something
will happen in Branner and the
four demonstration houses." He
added that the group would like
"some of the fraternities, the
row houses, and the other
groups that usually don't get
involved in these sorts of
things" participate.
