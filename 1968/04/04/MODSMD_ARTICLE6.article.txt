# Union Surveys
## Grad School Studied 
### DAN SNELL 
The graduate students' union
is circulating a questionnaire
among graduate students to let
the Study of Education at Stan
ford (S.E.S.) know what they
think about graduate education.
According to union president
Andrew Moss, a graduate stu
dent in statistics, S.E.S. sent a
letter containing 12 questions
dealing with graduate education
to the chairmen of departments

and deans of schools which
grant Ph.D's Feb. 26.
But Union members felt
students should be able to re
spond to the questions and
got S.E.S. approval to circu
late the questions among
graduate students.
Herbert Packer, head of the
S.E.S. steering committee, said,
"I'm very glad Mr. Moss and
his organization arc doing this.
We're always happy to have any
one's help in the Study."
But Moss charges that S.E.S.
had no plans to reach students
for their opinions about the sub
ject. "At the open hearings
S.E.S. held, they heard from
maybe three to six graduate stu
dents," Moss said.
"The S.E.S. has made no sys
tematic attempt to get informa
tion from anyone in the Univer
sity about graduate study except
Department heads," said Moss.
Packer denied Moss's charge.
"That's just flatly wrong. We
had public hearings to which
anyone could come and express
his views," Packer said.
Included in the questionnaire
are questions considering:
• Whether the Ph.D should
be broadened to permit granting
the degree to students interested
primarily in teaching instead of
research.
• Whether more thorough
comprehensive examinations and
the accomplishment of other
tasks should replace courses and
units "as a principal measure of
progress to the Ph.D.
• Whether Stanford under
graduates should be eligible for
admission to Stanford Ph.D.
programs.

Moss estimate the ques
tionnaire had now reached
about 300 graduate students.
The questionnaire is being dis
tributed this week in front of
Tresidder at lunehtime and
can be returned to Box 3030,
Stanford, according to Moss.
Moss said the questionnaire
was being circulated at the ex
pense of the union. He said the
Union would collect the answers
to the questionnaire and submit
a report along with Union roc
ommendations on graduate
study to S.E.S.
"This is the first thing the un
ion has done on a large scale in
academic matters," Moss said.
In the cover letter being given
out by the Union with the ques
tions Union members suggest
that graduate students be wary
of the possible "hidden implica
tions" in the S.E.S. questions,
and the "disguising" of money
questions.
In his letter to department
heads, also being circulated
with the questions. Packer
wrote, "The committee has
reached the tentative conclu
sion that many of our Ph.D.
programs are too rigid in their
structure, and require an un
reasonable amount of formal
course work."
Moss said his organization is
still waiting for the factual in
formation he requested from de
partments about teaching assist
ant employment. Several weejts
ago Provost Richard Lyman said
he would collect the information
for the Union since he did not
want departments to deal indi
vidually with the Union.
