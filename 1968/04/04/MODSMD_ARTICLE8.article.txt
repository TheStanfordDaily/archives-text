# McCarthy Or Kennedy?
## 
### 
We have learned some bitter lessons during the past five years
about the nature of the White House and the man who lives in
it. A liberal man has let the Vietnam war get tied up with his
own ego. He has sacrificed practically all his urgent domestic
programs in a vain attempt to wage an ill-conceived war.
Now Lyndon Johnson will retire. In choosing a successor for
the Democratic party nomination, voters are faced with a deci
sion based not so much on policies as on personalities. Having
Johnson as president should have taught us that personality can
have immense implications for the success or failure of a Presi
dent's programs.
Senators Eugene McCarthy and Robert F. Kennedy are can
didates in the June 4 California primary. They differ little in their
foreign and domestic politics. But as men — and potential Pres
idents — they are poles apart. As recently as two months ago,
Kennedy said he would support Johnson for reelection. Although
critical of Johnson's war policy, Kennedy declined to aid Mc-
Carthy's protest candidacy.
Then McCarthy's remarkable vote in the New Hampshire pri
mary showed Johnson's weakness at the polls. Kennedy jumped
into the race. His campaign so far has confirmed our impressions.
He immediately leaked to the press his slick offer to Johnson to
stay out of the race if a "commission" on Vietnam were appoint
ed, with himself a member. Then this week, after Johnson said
he would refuse the nomination, Kennedy immediately sought a
meeting with his erstwhile enemy to promote "unity."
A President must be expected to sacrifice his political future,
and even his personal repuation, for the sake of the principles
he believes in. We have no reason to believe Kennedy would
sacrifice his political future for anything.
Eugene McCarthy, on the other hand, has shown a rare dedi
cation to his ideals and a gratifying capacity for ignoring his
personal future when working for what he sees as the good of
the country. He entered the race against Johnson when the "prac
tical'' politicos thought it was suicide. McCarthy impresses us
as thoughtful and easy-going. Perhaps his style as President
would succeed where ill-tempered aggressiveness has failed,
McCarthy can win. He showed that in Wisconsin Tuesday,
piling up 57 per cent of the vote. A victory in California may be
essential to his winning the nomination. We urge members of the
Stanford community to support his campaign with time and
money.
We need McCarthy.

he believes in. We have no reason to believe Kennedy would
sacrifice his political future for anything.
Eugene McCarthy, on the other hand, has shown a rare dedi
cation to his ideals and a gratifying capacity for ignoring his
personal future when working for what he sees as the good of
the country. He entered the race against Johnson when the "prac
tical'' politicos thought it was suicide. McCarthy impresses us
as thoughtful and easy-going. Perhaps his style as President
would succeed where ill-tempered aggressiveness has failed,
McCarthy can win. He showed that in Wisconsin Tuesday,
piling up 57 per cent of the vote. A victory in California may be
essential to his winning the nomination. We urge members of the
Stanford community to support his campaign with time and
money.
We need McCarthy.

We have learned some bitter lessons during the past five years
about the nature of the White House and the man who lives in
it. A liberal man has let the Vietnam war get tied up with his
own ego. He has sacrificed practically all his urgent domestic
programs in a vain attempt to wage an ill-conceived war.
Now Lyndon Johnson will retire. In choosing a successor for
the Democratic party nomination, voters are faced with a deci
sion based not so much on policies as on personalities. Having
Johnson as president should have taught us that personality can
have immense implications for the success or failure of a Presi
dent's programs.
Senators Eugene McCarthy and Robert F. Kennedy are can
didates in the June 4 California primary. They differ little in their
foreign and domestic politics. But as men — and potential Pres
idents — they are poles apart. As recently as two months ago,
Kennedy said he would support Johnson for reelection. Although
critical of Johnson's war policy, Kennedy declined to aid Mc-
Carthy's protest candidacy.
Then McCarthy's remarkable vote in the New Hampshire pri
mary showed Johnson's weakness at the polls. Kennedy jumped
into the race. His campaign so far has confirmed our impressions.
He immediately leaked to the press his slick offer to Johnson to
stay out of the race if a "commission" on Vietnam were appoint
ed, with himself a member. Then this week, after Johnson said
he would refuse the nomination, Kennedy immediately sought a
meeting with his erstwhile enemy to promote "unity."
A President must be expected to sacrifice his political future,
and even his personal repuation, for the sake of the principles
he believes in. We have no reason to believe Kennedy would
sacrifice his political future for anything.
Eugene McCarthy, on the other hand, has shown a rare dedi
cation to his ideals and a gratifying capacity for ignoring his
personal future when working for what he sees as the good of
the country. He entered the race against Johnson when the "prac
tical'' politicos thought it was suicide. McCarthy impresses us
as thoughtful and easy-going. Perhaps his style as President
would succeed where ill-tempered aggressiveness has failed,
McCarthy can win. He showed that in Wisconsin Tuesday,

essential to his winning the nomination. We urge members of the
