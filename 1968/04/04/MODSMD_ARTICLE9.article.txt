# ...And Kuchel
## 
### 
Before Republicans switch their party registration to be able
to vote for McCarthy in the June 4 primary (the deadline for
re-registration is April 11), they should take a look at Max Raf
ferty's challenge to U.S. Senator Thomas Kuchel.
Recent public opinion polls show Kuchel's record appeals to
a wide majority of the California electorate. But the reactionary
Superintendent of Public Instruction threatens to deny him his
party's nomination.
Conservative Republicans criticize Kuchel for refusing to ac
tively support Barry Goldwater in 1964. Rafferty's supporters
also recall Kuchel's futile opposition to Proposition 14, which
eliminated open-housing laws.
Kuchel may need as many votes as he can muster in the June
4 Republican primary. If you're going to stay a Republican, give
him yours.
