# Psychiatrists, Judge
## Panel To Discuss Drug Use 
### 
Four experts will scrutinize
durg use Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel in a symposium on
"The Use ol Grass, Acid and
Speed."
Drugs as a social boon, a per
sonal nightmare, a group of po
tent chemicals and a ticket to
prison will be discussed under
the sponsorship of the Cowell
Health Center and the Associ
ated Students.
Dr. Duke D. Fisher, a UCLA
psychiatrist who has published
extensively on LSD and other
drugs, will speak on good and
bad trips from various drugs.
Fisher will be staying as a
gu<*st In Stern hall Tuesday.
Stanford researcher Richard
Blum will discuss social aspects
of drug use—why students and
others turn on. Blum conducted
a survey last spring which

showed one out of every five
Stanford undergraduates had
tried marijuana, and one in 18
had experimented with LSD.
His larger study of 1300 stu
dents at five universities also
showed that more than half of
those who had used marijuana
said they used it fewer than
five times a year.
Blum is director of the psy
chopharmacology project at the
Institute for the Study of Hu
man Problems. He has contrib
uted to three books on drugs
and written many articles on
drugs and behavior.
The pharmacology of drugs
will be Dr. Leo E. Hollister's
subject on the panel. As associ
ate chief of staff at th n Veter
ans Administration Hosiptal in
Palo Alto, he has wide clinical
experience in drugs.

A topic recently brought to
the attention of Stanford,
drugs and the law, will be dis
cussed by John S. Mclnery,
judge of the Santa Clara Su
perior Court since 1966. As a
legal ad visor to the State Nar
cotics Enforcement.
The panel will be moderated
by sophomore Dave Miller. Dr.
James Paulsen, chief psychiat
rist at Cowell, will lead ques
tions after the panelists speak.
The next evening, April 10,
small groups in 15 residences
will discuss drugs with psychol
ogists from Cowell or the Stan
ford Medical Center, all experi
enced in drug questions.
The symposium is the first of
"educational and informational
programs about drugs" men
tioned in a University Statement
on Drug Abuse Feb. 27. That
statement also warned that "the
University explicitly refused to
act as a sanctuary from enforce
ment of the drug laws by those
agencies that have that respon
sibility."
This warning acquired some
teeth last month with the ar
rest of two students for mari
juana possession by a campus
officer.
Dr. John Maurer, a Cowell
psychiatrist, thinks the sympos
ium will "help people come to
their own conclusions about
using drugs." He believes "the
best way to help people make
responsible decisions is to edu
cate them—whether it's about
history, drugs or sex."
