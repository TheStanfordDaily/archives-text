The gun that shot Martin Luther King swallowed up his
broken body. Nourished by its hated and loved victim, the gun
will procreate a thousand-fold to shatter black and white faces
into the bloody pieces that look just the same for martyrs and
ordinary folks.
Martin Luther King may once have been his own man, preach
ing peace and dignity and equality; but now he belongs to us â€”
you, me and the guns. You and I will cry our poor white souls
dry over the last black man who saw past white skins to the
fears beneath. Meanwhile the guns will swallow more black
bodies in the name of Law and Order and more white bodies
in the name of Freedom and Justice.
He wasn't going to die in his sleep. And his memory isn't
going to be frozen into historical truth by the purple prose of a
newspaper obituary. Now we get to squabble over the remains:
"I will always remember Martin Luther King as a Negro."
"But I will always remember Martin Luther King as a black
man."
"I will always remember Martin Luther King as a Man of
Peace."
"But I will always remember Martin Luther King as a Cham
pion of his People."
Just try to see if you can forget the gun that owns him.
M.S.
