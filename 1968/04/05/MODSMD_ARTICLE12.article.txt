When he was President, Harry Truman used to say, "The buck
stops here." At Stanford the buck stops nowhere.
Fifteen months ago Wallace Sterling asked the Board of Trus
tees to find a new University president. After 19 years in the
job, Sterling wanted to retire. He has since played a progessively
smaller role in campus affairs. Meanwhile the Trustees have
failed to find a successor.
As a result, the decision-making process at Stanford works
without confidence and sharpness. It is clear that Stanford needs
a strong president with substantial independence from the
Board of Trustees.
With Sterling nearing retirement, most academic policy ques
tions are being passed to other administrators, particularly Pro
vost Richard Lyman. But without the insulation from trustees,
alumni and the outside public which a strong president would
provide, no sensible administrator wants to stick his neck out
on anything. And venturesome innovation is the key to good
university leadership.
The weeks of trouble encountered by the proposal to send
undergraduates to study Martin Luther King's Poor Peoples'
Campaign show what happens when one top University official
does not have the power to accept the consequences of his de
cisions. The proposal's sponsors were first told that King's cam
paign was too uncertain as a subject for an academic program.
Then fears were voiced about Stanford students getting involved
in civil disorders, with the University (and the administrators
responsible) receiving blame. Then it was insisted that the field
of study be made respectable by sending full-time Stanford
faculty along with the students. And finally the study's sponsors
were told that no money was available.
Only the study's obvious merits and strong faculty support
ultimately carried it through. The lesson is clear. The University
administration must be able to do what it thinks best, even if
the Board of Trustees, almuni and popular press think it's hair
brained.
Especially if marijuana is at issue. Perhaps it's unreasonable
to expect Lyman or Dean of Students Joel Smith to take re
sponsibility for explicit noncooperation with the severe marijuana
laws. However popular with students, faculty and lawyers, such
a stance would be abhorrent to the trustees and alumni. A presi
dent could make a decision based only on the merits of the case.
A provost and Dean of Students can't.
With the Study of Education drawing up its recommendations,
the need for a new president to support them will become acute.
We hope the trustees will soon select a man with the realiza
tion that he, and not they, must make the University's academic
decisions.

responsible) receiving blame. Then it was insisted that the field
of study be made respectable by sending full-time Stanford
faculty along with the students. And finally the study's sponsors
were told that no money was available.
Only the study's obvious merits and strong faculty support
ultimately carried it through. The lesson is clear. The University
administration must be able to do what it thinks best, even if
the Board of Trustees, almuni and popular press think it's hair
brained.
Especially if marijuana is at issue. Perhaps it's unreasonable
to expect Lyman or Dean of Students Joel Smith to take re
sponsibility for explicit noncooperation with the severe marijuana
laws. However popular with students, faculty and lawyers, such
a stance would be abhorrent to the trustees and alumni. A presi
dent could make a decision based only on the merits of the case.
A provost and Dean of Students can't.
With the Study of Education drawing up its recommendations,
the need for a new president to support them will become acute.
We hope the trustees will soon select a man with the realiza
tion that he, and not they, must make the University's academic
decisions.
When he was President, Harry Truman used to say, "The buck
stops here." At Stanford the buck stops nowhere.
Fifteen months ago Wallace Sterling asked the Board of Trus
tees to find a new University president. After 19 years in the
job, Sterling wanted to retire. He has since played a progessively
smaller role in campus affairs. Meanwhile the Trustees have
failed to find a successor.
As a result, the decision-making process at Stanford works
without confidence and sharpness. It is clear that Stanford needs
a strong president with substantial independence from the
Board of Trustees.
With Sterling nearing retirement, most academic policy ques
tions are being passed to other administrators, particularly Pro
vost Richard Lyman. But without the insulation from trustees,
alumni and the outside public which a strong president would
provide, no sensible administrator wants to stick his neck out
on anything. And venturesome innovation is the key to good
university leadership.
The weeks of trouble encountered by the proposal to send
undergraduates to study Martin Luther King's Poor Peoples'
Campaign show what happens when one top University official
does not have the power to accept the consequences of his de
cisions. The proposal's sponsors were first told that King's cam
paign was too uncertain as a subject for an academic program.
Then fears were voiced about Stanford students getting involved
in civil disorders, with the University (and the administrators
responsible) receiving blame. Then it was insisted that the field
of study be made respectable by sending full-time Stanford
faculty along with the students. And finally the study's sponsors
were told that no money was available.
