## Daley Proposed Peace Commission 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
I should like to register a
most vehment protest against
the distortion of the facts con
tined in The Daily's editorial of
April 4: "McCarthy or Ken
nedy?" For lack of space, I
shall restrict my remarks to the
most palpable of the many dis
tortions contained therein.
In attempting to support its
implicit condemnation of Sen
ator Kennedy as an opportunist,
the editorial glibly and snidely
refers to "his slick offer to
Johnson to stay out of the race
if a 'commission' on Vietnam
were appointed, with himself as
a member." Unfortunately for
The Daily, the facts of the mat
ter directly contradict the con
clusions that The Daily editorial
board evidently wished us to
draw from this statement. The
facts are as follows:
The "commission" idea was
first suggested to both Senator
Kennedy and President John
son (on different occasions) by
Mayor Richard Daley of Chica
go, a mutual friend who was
supporting Johnson, yet expres
sing concern over the course
of the war. Theodore Sorenseon,
by his own account (see The
Chronicle, 3/19/63, p. 10), then
received a call from LBJ on Fri
day, March 8, asking him to
confer with the President on the
following Monday. At that time,
LBJ asked if he had any new
ideas on Vietnam. Sorenson
then broached the idea of a
commission which he had first
read about in The New York
Times of March 1 (thus there
really was no reason for The

Daily to attempt to prejudice its
readers in favor of its view by
putting "commission" in quotes).
Johnson, of course, was conver
sant with the idea and indicated
that he was favorably disposed
towards it and asked Sorenson
to think about a possible list
of names for the proposed com
mission. Daley then called Ken
nedy on March 13, and suggest
ed that he see Clark Clifford on
Thursday, as he and Sorenson
did. Sorenson talked with Ken
nedy before the meeting and
both agreed that it would make
no sense to raise RFK's anti
war candidacy if LBJ would
create a non-rubber-stamp com
mission and indicate a genuine
disposition to broaden the search
for peace. They informed Clif
ford of this view.
Daley originally suggested
that Kennedy chair or at least
serve on the commission, but
Kennedy later offered (after the
meeting in Clifford's office) to
rule himself out its a commis
sion member if that would in
cline LBJ to go along with the
proposal.
Johnson, through Clifford, re
fused and the next day reports
were leaked to ABC and CBS
that the President considered
the suggestion "blackmail." Af
ter these reports were leaked
(Time magazine also received
this version just before it went
to press Sunday evening), Sen
ator Kennedy hastily called a
news conference Sunday even
ing to deny this version and to
present his own side of the
story.
Thus it is nonsense to say, as

The Daily does, that "he (Ken
nedy) immediately leaked to the
press his slick offer . . . ", for
t'.ie first reports carried by the
media presented Kennedy as
trying to blackmail Johnson, or
is a press conference rebuttal
an 'immediate leak'?
In short, The Daily clearly
has failed to do its homework.
Perhaps this is to be expected.
For many liberals I rational, im
partial and well informed?) have
resolved a priori to interpret
every action of Robert F. Ken
nedy's as motivated purely by
that perennial shibboleth 'ruth
less opportunism.'
In closing one may note that
Senator McCarthy's reaction to
the commission idea — seen by
him at the time as RFK's idea
— was: the idea of such a com
mission is "offensive to the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Commit
tee." (The Chronicle, 3/19/68, p.
8.) Et apres?

Hits Kelly Letter
Editor, The Daily:
No, Mr. H. Briggs Kelly. As
clarified in the editorial subscript
to your imbecilic diatribe, the
posters tacked up around cam
pus advocating the Impeach
ment of President Johnson refer
to Andrew in 1868 and not, oh
woe is me, to Lyndon in 1968.
Had you taken a few moments
of initiative, Mr. Kelly, you
would have discovered that your
fair Lyndon is out of harm's
way as far as the Theater of

The Congressional Record is
concerned. . . .
Reading your letter, I was
piqued to dismay by your des
cription of those "immature, il
logical, and un-American minds"
who would seek to "advocate
such an abortion of justice" as
to work toward the impeach
ment of our present Mr. John
son.
In fact, if anyone has been
"disgraced by the cowardly
propaganda of subversive chil
dren," it is you, Mr. Kelly, and
all the mental and moral crip
ples who no doubt cluster
around you for inspiration in
that grand institution of refrig
erated isolation, the Stanford
School of Business.
Indeed, only a person of your
"commercially-oriented" antece
dents of education would have
taken issue with a poster de
signed as publicity for a Speech
and Drama Department play.
Has your business education in
commercial, back-biting, pres
tige-mongering, truth-slandering
advertising so engrained in you
a distrust of the real a"nd factual
and so wedded you and your
myopic kind to the superficial
and fantastical?
I shan't take you too much to
task for your unreserved, un
founded, and totally uninformed
glorification of LBJ. Would that
history repeat itself on the cen
tenniel of the Congressional cen
sure of President Johnson in
1868, humanity would be vindi
cated to some small measure in
its struggle to withstand the
onslaughts of the four horsemen
—death, pestilence, famine, and
war — unleashed by Lyndon

Johnson to roam the earth once
again. . . .
"Whom the Gods destroy, they
first make mad." And no one
who read your letter, Mr. Kelly,
could be in much doubt that the
Gods have singled you out. Cir
cumspection, Mr. Kelly .... cir

Hits Kelly Letter
Editor, The Daily:
No, Mr. H. Briggs Kelly. As
clarified in the editorial subscript
to your imbecilic diatribe, the
posters tacked up around cam
pus advocating the Impeach
ment of President Johnson refer
to Andrew in 1868 and not, oh
woe is me, to Lyndon in 1968.
Had you taken a few moments
of initiative, Mr. Kelly, you
would have discovered that your
fair Lyndon is out of harm's
way as far as the Theater of

The Congressional Record is
concerned. . . .
Reading your letter, I was
piqued to dismay by your des
cription of those "immature, il
logical, and un-American minds"
who would seek to "advocate
such an abortion of justice" as
to work toward the impeach
ment of our present Mr. John
son.
In fact, if anyone has been
"disgraced by the cowardly
propaganda of subversive chil
dren," it is you, Mr. Kelly, and
all the mental and moral crip
ples who no doubt cluster
around you for inspiration in
that grand institution of refrig
erated isolation, the Stanford
School of Business.
Indeed, only a person of your
"commercially-oriented" antece
dents of education would have
taken issue with a poster de
signed as publicity for a Speech
and Drama Department play.
Has your business education in
commercial, back-biting, pres
tige-mongering, truth-slandering
advertising so engrained in you
a distrust of the real a"nd factual
and so wedded you and your
myopic kind to the superficial
and fantastical?
I shan't take you too much to
task for your unreserved, un
founded, and totally uninformed
glorification of LBJ. Would that
history repeat itself on the cen
tenniel of the Congressional cen
sure of President Johnson in
1868, humanity would be vindi
cated to some small measure in
its struggle to withstand the
onslaughts of the four horsemen
—death, pestilence, famine, and
war — unleashed by Lyndon

Johnson to roam the earth once
again. . . .
"Whom the Gods destroy, they

H. BRIGGS KELLY
On Leave of Absence
from the G. S. B.
Editor, The Dally:
I should like to register a
most vehment protest against
the distortion of the facts con
tined in The Daily's editorial of
April 4: "McCarthy or Ken
nedy?" For lack of space, I
shall restrict my remarks to the
most palpable of the many dis
tortions contained therein.
In attempting to support its
implicit condemnation of Sen
ator Kennedy as an opportunist,
the editorial glibly and snidely
refers to "his slick offer to
Johnson to stay out of the race
if a 'commission' on Vietnam
were appointed, with himself as
a member." Unfortunately for
The Daily, the facts of the mat
ter directly contradict the con
clusions that The Daily editorial
board evidently wished us to
draw from this statement. The
facts are as follows:
The "commission" idea was
first suggested to both Senator
Kennedy and President John
son (on different occasions) by
Mayor Richard Daley of Chica
go, a mutual friend who was
supporting Johnson, yet expres
sing concern over the course
of the war. Theodore Sorenseon,
by his own account (see The
Chronicle, 3/19/63, p. 10), then
received a call from LBJ on Fri
day, March 8, asking him to
confer with the President on the
following Monday. At that time,
LBJ asked if he had any new
ideas on Vietnam. Sorenson
then broached the idea of a
commission which he had first
read about in The New York
Times of March 1 (thus there
really was no reason for The

Daily to attempt to prejudice its
readers in favor of its view by
putting "commission" in quotes).
Johnson, of course, was conver
sant with the idea and indicated
that he was favorably disposed
towards it and asked Sorenson
to think about a possible list
of names for the proposed com
mission. Daley then called Ken
nedy on March 13, and suggest
ed that he see Clark Clifford on
Thursday, as he and Sorenson
did. Sorenson talked with Ken
nedy before the meeting and
both agreed that it would make
no sense to raise RFK's anti
war candidacy if LBJ would
create a non-rubber-stamp com
mission and indicate a genuine
disposition to broaden the search
for peace. They informed Clif
ford of this view.
Daley originally suggested
that Kennedy chair or at least
serve on the commission, but
Kennedy later offered (after the
meeting in Clifford's office) to
rule himself out its a commis
sion member if that would in
cline LBJ to go along with the
proposal.
Johnson, through Clifford, re
fused and the next day reports
were leaked to ABC and CBS
that the President considered
the suggestion "blackmail." Af
ter these reports were leaked
(Time magazine also received
this version just before it went
to press Sunday evening), Sen
ator Kennedy hastily called a
news conference Sunday even
ing to deny this version and to
present his own side of the
story.
Thus it is nonsense to say, as

The Daily does, that "he (Ken
nedy) immediately leaked to the
press his slick offer . . . ", for
t'.ie first reports carried by the

trying to blackmail Johnson, or

H. BRIGGS KELLY
On Leave of Absence
from the G. S. B.
Editor, The Dally:
I should like to register a
most vehment protest against
the distortion of the facts con
tined in The Daily's editorial of
April 4: "McCarthy or Ken
nedy?" For lack of space, I
shall restrict my remarks to the
most palpable of the many dis
tortions contained therein.
In attempting to support its
implicit condemnation of Sen
ator Kennedy as an opportunist,
the editorial glibly and snidely
refers to "his slick offer to
Johnson to stay out of the race
if a 'commission' on Vietnam
were appointed, with himself as
a member." Unfortunately for
The Daily, the facts of the mat
ter directly contradict the con
clusions that The Daily editorial
board evidently wished us to
draw from this statement. The
facts are as follows:
The "commission" idea was
first suggested to both Senator
Kennedy and President John
son (on different occasions) by
Mayor Richard Daley of Chica
go, a mutual friend who was
supporting Johnson, yet expres
sing concern over the course
of the war. Theodore Sorenseon,
by his own account (see The
Chronicle, 3/19/63, p. 10), then
received a call from LBJ on Fri
day, March 8, asking him to
confer with the President on the
following Monday. At that time,
LBJ asked if he had any new
ideas on Vietnam. Sorenson
then broached the idea of a
commission which he had first
read about in The New York
Times of March 1 (thus there
really was no reason for The

Daily to attempt to prejudice its
readers in favor of its view by
putting "commission" in quotes).
Johnson, of course, was conver
sant with the idea and indicated
that he was favorably disposed
towards it and asked Sorenson
to think about a possible list
of names for the proposed com
mission. Daley then called Ken
nedy on March 13, and suggest
ed that he see Clark Clifford on
Thursday, as he and Sorenson
did. Sorenson talked with Ken
nedy before the meeting and
both agreed that it would make
no sense to raise RFK's anti
war candidacy if LBJ would
create a non-rubber-stamp com
mission and indicate a genuine
disposition to broaden the search
for peace. They informed Clif
ford of this view.
Daley originally suggested
that Kennedy chair or at least
serve on the commission, but
Kennedy later offered (after the
meeting in Clifford's office) to
rule himself out its a commis
sion member if that would in
cline LBJ to go along with the
proposal.
Johnson, through Clifford, re
fused and the next day reports
were leaked to ABC and CBS
that the President considered
the suggestion "blackmail." Af
ter these reports were leaked
(Time magazine also received
this version just before it went
to press Sunday evening), Sen
ator Kennedy hastily called a
news conference Sunday even
ing to deny this version and to
present his own side of the
story.
Thus it is nonsense to say, as

The Daily does, that "he (Ken
nedy) immediately leaked to the
press his slick offer . . . ", for
t'.ie first reports carried by the
media presented Kennedy as
trying to blackmail Johnson, or
is a press conference rebuttal
an 'immediate leak'?
In short, The Daily clearly
has failed to do its homework.
Perhaps this is to be expected.
For many liberals I rational, im
partial and well informed?) have
resolved a priori to interpret
every action of Robert F. Ken
nedy's as motivated purely by
that perennial shibboleth 'ruth
less opportunism.'
In closing one may note that
Senator McCarthy's reaction to
the commission idea — seen by
him at the time as RFK's idea
— was: the idea of such a com
mission is "offensive to the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Commit
tee." (The Chronicle, 3/19/68, p.
8.) Et apres?

Editor, The Daily:
No, Mr. H. Briggs Kelly. As
clarified in the editorial subscript
to your imbecilic diatribe, the
posters tacked up around cam

ment of President Johnson refer
to Andrew in 1868 and not, oh
woe is me, to Lyndon in 1968.
Had you taken a few moments
of initiative, Mr. Kelly, you
would have discovered that your
fair Lyndon is out of harm's
way as far as the Theater of

The Congressional Record is
concerned. . . .
Reading your letter, I was
piqued to dismay by your des
cription of those "immature, il
logical, and un-American minds"
who would seek to "advocate
such an abortion of justice" as
to work toward the impeach
ment of our present Mr. John
son.
In fact, if anyone has been
"disgraced by the cowardly
propaganda of subversive chil
dren," it is you, Mr. Kelly, and
all the mental and moral crip
ples who no doubt cluster
around you for inspiration in
that grand institution of refrig
erated isolation, the Stanford
School of Business.
Indeed, only a person of your
"commercially-oriented" antece

taken issue with a poster de
signed as publicity for a Speech

Has your business education in
commercial, back-biting, pres
tige-mongering, truth-slandering

a distrust of the real a"nd factual
and so wedded you and your
myopic kind to the superficial

I shan't take you too much to

glorification of LBJ. Would that
history repeat itself on the cen

sure of President Johnson in
1868, humanity would be vindi

for peace. They informed Clif
ford of this view.
Daley originally suggested
that Kennedy chair or at least
serve on the commission, but
Kennedy later offered (after the
meeting in Clifford's office) to
rule himself out its a commis
sion member if that would in
cline LBJ to go along with the
proposal.
Johnson, through Clifford, re
fused and the next day reports
were leaked to ABC and CBS
that the President considered
the suggestion "blackmail." Af
ter these reports were leaked
(Time magazine also received
this version just before it went
to press Sunday evening), Sen
ator Kennedy hastily called a
news conference Sunday even
ing to deny this version and to
present his own side of the
story.
Thus it is nonsense to say, as

The Daily does, that "he (Ken
nedy) immediately leaked to the
press his slick offer . . . ", for
t'.ie first reports carried by the
media presented Kennedy as
trying to blackmail Johnson, or
is a press conference rebuttal
an 'immediate leak'?
In short, The Daily clearly
has failed to do its homework.
Perhaps this is to be expected.
For many liberals I rational, im
partial and well informed?) have
resolved a priori to interpret
every action of Robert F. Ken
nedy's as motivated purely by
that perennial shibboleth 'ruth
less opportunism.'
In closing one may note that
Senator McCarthy's reaction to
the commission idea — seen by
him at the time as RFK's idea
— was: the idea of such a com
mission is "offensive to the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Commit
tee." (The Chronicle, 3/19/68, p.
8.) Et apres?

Hits Kelly Letter
Editor, The Daily:
No, Mr. H. Briggs Kelly. As
clarified in the editorial subscript
to your imbecilic diatribe, the
posters tacked up around cam
pus advocating the Impeach
ment of President Johnson refer
to Andrew in 1868 and not, oh
woe is me, to Lyndon in 1968.
Had you taken a few moments
of initiative, Mr. Kelly, you
would have discovered that your
fair Lyndon is out of harm's
way as far as the Theater of

The Congressional Record is
concerned. . . .
Reading your letter, I was
piqued to dismay by your des
cription of those "immature, il
logical, and un-American minds"
who would seek to "advocate
such an abortion of justice" as
to work toward the impeach
ment of our present Mr. John
son.
In fact, if anyone has been
"disgraced by the cowardly
propaganda of subversive chil
dren," it is you, Mr. Kelly, and
all the mental and moral crip
ples who no doubt cluster
around you for inspiration in
that grand institution of refrig
erated isolation, the Stanford
School of Business.
Indeed, only a person of your
"commercially-oriented" antece
dents of education would have
taken issue with a poster de
signed as publicity for a Speech
and Drama Department play.
Has your business education in
commercial, back-biting, pres
tige-mongering, truth-slandering
advertising so engrained in you
a distrust of the real a"nd factual
and so wedded you and your
myopic kind to the superficial
and fantastical?
I shan't take you too much to
task for your unreserved, un
founded, and totally uninformed
glorification of LBJ. Would that
history repeat itself on the cen
tenniel of the Congressional cen
sure of President Johnson in
1868, humanity would be vindi
cated to some small measure in
its struggle to withstand the
onslaughts of the four horsemen
—death, pestilence, famine, and
war — unleashed by Lyndon

Johnson to roam the earth once
again. . . .
"Whom the Gods destroy, they
first make mad." And no one
who read your letter, Mr. Kelly,
could be in much doubt that the
Gods have singled you out. Cir
cumspection, Mr. Kelly .... cir
cumspection.

H. BRIGGS KELLY
On Leave of Absence
from the G. S. B.
Editor, The Dally:
I should like to register a
most vehment protest against
the distortion of the facts con
tined in The Daily's editorial of
April 4: "McCarthy or Ken
nedy?" For lack of space, I
shall restrict my remarks to the
most palpable of the many dis
tortions contained therein.
In attempting to support its
implicit condemnation of Sen
ator Kennedy as an opportunist,
the editorial glibly and snidely
refers to "his slick offer to
Johnson to stay out of the race
if a 'commission' on Vietnam
were appointed, with himself as
a member." Unfortunately for
The Daily, the facts of the mat
ter directly contradict the con
clusions that The Daily editorial
board evidently wished us to
draw from this statement. The
facts are as follows:
The "commission" idea was
first suggested to both Senator
Kennedy and President John
son (on different occasions) by
Mayor Richard Daley of Chica
go, a mutual friend who was
supporting Johnson, yet expres
sing concern over the course
of the war. Theodore Sorenseon,
by his own account (see The
Chronicle, 3/19/63, p. 10), then
received a call from LBJ on Fri
day, March 8, asking him to
confer with the President on the
following Monday. At that time,
LBJ asked if he had any new
ideas on Vietnam. Sorenson
then broached the idea of a
commission which he had first
read about in The New York
Times of March 1 (thus there
really was no reason for The

Daily to attempt to prejudice its
readers in favor of its view by
putting "commission" in quotes).
Johnson, of course, was conver
sant with the idea and indicated
that he was favorably disposed
towards it and asked Sorenson
to think about a possible list
of names for the proposed com
mission. Daley then called Ken
nedy on March 13, and suggest
ed that he see Clark Clifford on
Thursday, as he and Sorenson
did. Sorenson talked with Ken
nedy before the meeting and
both agreed that it would make
no sense to raise RFK's anti
war candidacy if LBJ would
create a non-rubber-stamp com
mission and indicate a genuine
disposition to broaden the search
for peace. They informed Clif
ford of this view.
Daley originally suggested
that Kennedy chair or at least
serve on the commission, but
Kennedy later offered (after the
meeting in Clifford's office) to
rule himself out its a commis
sion member if that would in
cline LBJ to go along with the
proposal.
Johnson, through Clifford, re
fused and the next day reports
