On board a Cubana Airlines
plane in late January, flying
from Havana to Prague. I was
invited by the pilot, Captain
Jorge Foyo Alvarez, to spend a
with him in the cabin in
the ship's nose, where he was
charting and steering. He told
me, among other things, that he
had flown Che Guevara on many
occasions, to Algeria, for exam
ple, and to the United Nations.
"Of course," he said. "Che. too.
was a pilot." I said that al
though I had known Che had a
number of skills I never
beforo that pilot
a plane. "Oh yes," said Captain
Alvaraz, pointing to the helms
man's chair, occupied for
moment by an aide. "Che would
sit right andttank n over. He
was very good. An excellent pi
lot. And enjoyed it hugely.
I can see him now in my mind,
so calm and happv. as close to
me as you are." He shook
head, smiling at his memory of
Che. "A wonderful man of
countless accomplishments."
Che Was Writer
Among th ese accomplish
ments, I had discovered while in
Cuba when I read some of the
material contained in Reminis
cences of the Cuban Revolution
ary War, was writing. Discus
sing Che's ability in this line
with a Cuban poet and editor I
said that Che's sketches of the
life of war reminded me very
much of the work of Isaac Bab
el.
Now that I think over my
first impression of the similarity
between Che and Babel as writ
ers, on the basis of re-reading
Che in this book published in
February by Monthly Review
Press, I find myself responding
more sympathetically to Che for
this reason: his writing was
simply an expression of himself
as a man in the process of reali
zation. I mean that he was first
of all a man, not a writer,
whereas Babel, for all his re
markable capacity to make
things absolutely clear, seems to
me to have to be classified as a
writer.
I was in Cuba at a time when

there were many reporters and
visitors from all over the world
on the scene. It was expected, I
gathered, by the graceful Cuban
hosts, that surely those of us
who came from the United
States would want to have a
look at the Ernest Hemingway
home not far from Havana,
which the government of Fidel
Castro, who had been a friend of
Hemingway, has preserved as a
shrine.
I began to reflect that Che
was indeed the kind of man
Hemingway might have desired
to be. And the kind of man upon
whose and simple
writing style the writing of the
future might be modeled, which
would mean, that those doing
the writing would havn to he.
to quote Fidel again; "Like
Che!"
Among these writers. I hopr>
will be many of Che's comrades
of the Cuban Revolution, to
whom he makes reference in the
prologue to this personal his
tory: "I am starting," he writes,
"a series of personal reminis
cences of attacks, battles and
skirmishes in which we all par
ticipated.
"It is not my intention that
this fragmentary history, based
on remembrances and a few
hasty notes, should be taken as
a full account. On the contrary,
1 hope that each theme will be
developed by those who lived it.
. . . I ask only that the narrator
be strictly truthful. He should
not pretend, for his own ag
grandizement, to have been
where he was not, and he should
beware of inaccuracies. I ask
that having written a few pages
to the best of his ability, de
pending on his education and
his disposition, he then criticize
them as seriously as possible in
order to remove every word
which does not refer to a strict
fact, or those where the fact is
uncertain."
Valuable Appeal
What more valuable appeal
could be made, not just to his
comrades of the Revolution, but
to all men and women who dare
to dream of writing their experi
ence? It is an appeal, it seems
to me, for an end to fiction and

for the beginning of a revolu
tionary exercise of the imagina
tion in the telling of the trutTi
about life. Not that there hasn't
been such writing in the past;
there have been many pioneers
in the field. By the way, I men
tioned the liberation struggle of
Henry Miller, as recounted in
his books when I talked about
Che with the Cuban poet-editor.
He frowned. He did not immedi
ately accept my effort to connect
the determination of each man,
as I saw it, to write Life rather
than Literature. But after a
while he said, yes, I see what
you mean, except. . . .
There is an "except," to be
sure. It is best defined by Che
himself, in a letter to his par
ents, written in mid-1965, at the
time he was leaving Cuba for
what turned out to be his eter
nal destiny in Bolivia. The letter
is one of 26 included in the
Monthly Review edition of his
"Reminiscences." I quote it in
full:
"Dear Folks —
"Once again I feel between
my heels the ribs of Rosinante;
once more I hit the road with
my shield upon my arm.
"Almost ten years ago today,
I wrote you another letter of
farewell. As I remember, I la
mented at not being a better
soldier and a better doctor. The
latter no longer interests me;
I'm not such a bad soldier.
"Nothing has changed in es
sence, except that I am much
aware, my Marxism has taken
root and become purified. I be
lieve in the armed struggle as
the only solution for those peo
ples who fight to free them
selves, and I am consistent with
my beliefs. Many will call me
an adventurer—and that I am,
only, one of a different sort —
one of those who risks his skin
to prove his platitudes.
The Finish?
"It is possible that this may
be the finish. I don't seek it, but
it's within the logical realm of
probabilities. If it should be so,
I send you a last embrace.
"I have loved you very much,
only I haven't known how to ex
press my fondness. I am ex
tremely rigid in my actions, and

I think that sometimes you
didn't understand me. It hasn't
been easy to understand me.
Nevertheless, please just take
me at my word today.
"Give a thought once in a
while to this little soldier-of-for
tune of the twentieth century. A
kiss to Celia, to Roberto, Juan
Martin and Pototin, to Beatriz,
to everybody.
"An abrazo for you from your
obstinate and prodigal son.
Ernesto."
"Ernesto" was, of course,
what his parents called him
when he was born on June 14,
1928, in Rosario, Argentina,
was named after his father, an
architect. He studied and trav
eled in Latin America. He spent
a short while in Miami. At the
age of 27 he was in Mexico. He
met Fidel there in July or Aug
ust of 1955.
A little over a year later he
was one of the expeditionaries
on the "Granma," the small
yacht which carried to Cuba the
guerrillas among whom were
those few, like Fidel and Che,
who were to survive to proceed
with the success of the Revolu
tion, achieved in early January,
1959. Che was wounded, cap
tured and shot to death, at the
age of 39, in a two-room school
house in a remote region of Boli
via, where he had gone to "risk
his skin" as a revolutionary.
Reminiscences is both his
story and the story of the Cuban
Revolution, as complete an ac
count as exists to date. It is, at
any rate, the heart of the Revo
lution, besides being something
altogether new. to my knowl
edge: a history of the future by
a man of the future, who never
theless lived among us.
It is testament, textbook, the
absolute truth, putting to shame
the pretenders and privileged of
the contemporary world. I think
it is bound to have powerful
meaning to the youth of Ameri
ca who have not yet discovered
the spirit of Revolution typified
by Ernesto "Che" Guevara.
