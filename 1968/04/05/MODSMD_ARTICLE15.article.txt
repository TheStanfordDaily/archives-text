## Johnson's Decision Is Vindication 
### 
The best response I have
heard on President Johnson's
decision not to "seek or accept"
the Democratic nomination came
not from any one of the stunned
presidential candidates nor any
other politicos. It came from a
news vendor in New York. "It's
good for peace," he said. I con
cur.
It is good for peace on two
scores. It will rid the President
of suspicions that would other
wise have clung to his every
move toward negotiations—sus
picions that he was doing it only
for political advantage. Thus it
will allow him to act with great
er fluidity for peace and with a
more united country behind
him.
Second, it will rid Ho Chi
Minh of any belief that the
President will not dare to con
tinue the war through the elec
tion campaign for fear of being
rejected either by the convention
or the people.
What does the President's exit
from the current political strug
gle do to the campaign? It will
help Robert Kennedy by remov
ing the heavy armor in which
the pro-Johnson delegations had
been invested and will open
them to a new Kennedy blitz.
Since Eugene McCarthy has not
been the President's principal
enemy, his political fortunes will
continue to depend on the re
sults of the primaries.
The impact on Richard Nixon
may be a harsh one, since the
removal of his most vulnerable
opponent will stir up a wide de
mand again for a real Republi
can alternative to Nixon. The
Republican delegates who have
felt confident that Nixon could
win over an unpopular Lyndon
Johnson will think twice about
how he will do against either
Kennedy or McCarthy.
This could mean the revival
of the Nelson Rockefeller draft
idea or even the emergence of
John Lindsay as the only other
Republican who could give Ken
nedy a real race of it In both
New York and California and
divide the Negro, liberal, big
city, peace and youth vote with
him on pretty equal terms. If,
however, the Republicans feel
that the candidate running
against Kennedy or McCarthy
must be Hawkish—which is a
possible conclusion — Nixon's
hold on the nomination will be
strengthened.
The man whose political for

tunes are the biggest question
mark, and who has been hit
hardest, is Hubert Humphrey. If
any present or future bid of his
for the Democratic nomination
is to pick up real strength, he
will have to run within the nim
bus of Mr. Johnson's new image
as a peace-seeker, differentiating
himself from Kennedy and Mc-
Carthy by a greater tough
mindedness about Asian commu
nism. It would be a hard race.
But can Mr. Johnson be whol
ly and finally ruled out? He is
also a proud man who doesn't
want to subject himself to the
humiliation of possibly failing to
get renominated or re-elected.
Most of all he is a man whose
ruling passion now is to focus
on the war and the peace. Only
thus will he be able to get that
vindication from his people and
from history on which his self
image most depends.
But if vindication does come,
can political acclaim be far be
hind? Overnight the national
sentiment about the President
has already been radically trans
formed. No longer does he have
to fear being mobbed by a hos
tile crowd. He can count on
heartfelt applause wherever he
appears. Even Kennedy must
grant him "magnanimity."
The whole climate within
which he moves has been
changed. With a single act he
has removed the credibility gap.
It is wholly possible when Aug
ust comes to Chicago, with it
will come some real peace nego
tiations. What the delegates will
do then is today incalculable.
But in a surprise-studded year
they might even turn to the for
mer whipping boy and devil
figure, Lyndon Johnson.
Certainly his withdrawal has
cleared many poisons from the
atmosphere. It will help
peace and even the conduct of
the war and the way the world
feels about America. It Is
L.B.J.'s finest hour.

can political acclaim be far be
hind? Overnight the national
sentiment about the President
has already been radically trans
formed. No longer does he have
to fear being mobbed by a hos
tile crowd. He can count on
heartfelt applause wherever he
appears. Even Kennedy must
grant him "magnanimity."
The whole climate within
which he moves has been
changed. With a single act he
has removed the credibility gap.
It is wholly possible when Aug
ust comes to Chicago, with it
will come some real peace nego
tiations. What the delegates will
do then is today incalculable.
But in a surprise-studded year
they might even turn to the for
mer whipping boy and devil
figure, Lyndon Johnson.
Certainly his withdrawal has
cleared many poisons from the
atmosphere. It will help
peace and even the conduct of
the war and the way the world
feels about America. It Is
L.B.J.'s finest hour.

The best response I have
heard on President Johnson's
decision not to "seek or accept"
the Democratic nomination came
not from any one of the stunned
presidential candidates nor any
other politicos. It came from a
news vendor in New York. "It's
good for peace," he said. I con
cur.
It is good for peace on two
scores. It will rid the President
of suspicions that would other
wise have clung to his every
move toward negotiations—sus
picions that he was doing it only
for political advantage. Thus it
will allow him to act with great
er fluidity for peace and with a
more united country behind
him.
Second, it will rid Ho Chi
Minh of any belief that the
President will not dare to con
tinue the war through the elec
tion campaign for fear of being
rejected either by the convention
or the people.
What does the President's exit
from the current political strug
gle do to the campaign? It will
help Robert Kennedy by remov
ing the heavy armor in which
the pro-Johnson delegations had
been invested and will open
them to a new Kennedy blitz.
Since Eugene McCarthy has not
been the President's principal
enemy, his political fortunes will
continue to depend on the re
sults of the primaries.
The impact on Richard Nixon
may be a harsh one, since the
removal of his most vulnerable
opponent will stir up a wide de
mand again for a real Republi
can alternative to Nixon. The
Republican delegates who have
felt confident that Nixon could
win over an unpopular Lyndon
Johnson will think twice about
how he will do against either
Kennedy or McCarthy.
This could mean the revival
of the Nelson Rockefeller draft
idea or even the emergence of
John Lindsay as the only other
Republican who could give Ken
nedy a real race of it In both
New York and California and
divide the Negro, liberal, big
city, peace and youth vote with
him on pretty equal terms. If,
however, the Republicans feel
that the candidate running
against Kennedy or McCarthy
must be Hawkish—which is a
possible conclusion — Nixon's
hold on the nomination will be
strengthened.
The man whose political for

tunes are the biggest question
mark, and who has been hit
hardest, is Hubert Humphrey. If
any present or future bid of his
for the Democratic nomination
is to pick up real strength, he
will have to run within the nim
bus of Mr. Johnson's new image
as a peace-seeker, differentiating
himself from Kennedy and Mc-
Carthy by a greater tough
mindedness about Asian commu
nism. It would be a hard race.
But can Mr. Johnson be whol
ly and finally ruled out? He is
also a proud man who doesn't
want to subject himself to the
humiliation of possibly failing to
get renominated or re-elected.
Most of all he is a man whose
ruling passion now is to focus
on the war and the peace. Only
thus will he be able to get that
vindication from his people and
from history on which his self
image most depends.
But if vindication does come,
can political acclaim be far be
