It seems like the best entertainment has been on television
these days. After last Sunday's shocker, the next program of
note maybe Hubert what's-his-name, or better yet, Ho shouting
into A. Harriman's ear trumpet.
On the less political scene, there are some entertainment fea
tures to note. If you haven't seen ACT's Tiny Alice, you have
another chance Sunday at 2 at the Geary Theater. Tonight and
tomorrow night Misanthrope is at the Geary and A Delicate
Balance at the Marines' Memorial Theatre. Performances begin
at 8:.30.
"Fortnne anil Men's Eyes," John Herbert's controversial
piny about life behind bars continues its run at the Encore
Theatre (422 Mason, San Francisco). The play is performed
nightly Monday through Friday at 8:30 and twice on Saturday
at 7 and 10 p.m. and Sunday at 0 arul 9 p.m. "You're A Good
Man, Charlie Brown" continues at the IJttle Fox Theater (533
Pacific).
Rod McKuen, who says he has a voice "that makes you want to
clear your throat," will sing at the San Jose Givic Auditorium
tonight at 8:30 and tomorrow night in the Berkeley Community
Theater at the same time. The poot-singcr-composer is at times
trite, but he puts on an interesting show.
Two talented Black musicians, The Pair Extraordinaire begin
a two-week run at the El Matador on Monday. The Pair has
just returned from a cross-country tour with comedian Bill Cosby.
Easily at home with pure jazz and Motown sound, the Pair are
well worth hearing.
The ballet season is underway. "Ballet '68" presents its first
program in its new home, Presentation Theatre, 2350 Turk.
Four ballets will be danced-. "Pas de Six," "Facets," "La Peri,"
and "Giocoso." Leading roles will be danced by Virginia John
son, Lynda Meyer, Victoria Gyorfi, and David Coll. The
program begins at 8:30 tonight and tomorrow night.
The San Francisco Symphony will present an all-Mozart pro
gram at 8:15 tomorrow evening in the Foothill College Gym
nasium. This will be the orchestra's last appearance before it
leaves on a three-week tour of Japan.
There are barely enough good films to fill the weekend, how
ever the industrious and undaunted filmphiles will find a few
worth the effort of seeing. Friday Tresidder is showing Truffaut's
Jules and Jim, starring Jenne Moreau and Oskar Werner, with
performances at 7:30, 8:30 and 9:30. After this easy local "find"
there is not much else in the area. King of Hearts, is playing at
the Altos International, unfortunately with Live for Life, which
is a combination of A Man and a Woman, The Graduate, and
Paradise Lost.
Bonnie and. Clyde, by far the best picture of the year, is still
at the Bijou, and the film deserves to be seen by itself, even
though The Jokers, which accompanies Bonnie and Clyde is
not that bad (or good, but simply entertaining). Two films in
the city are worth traveling for, Closely Watched Trains, at the
Bridge Theatre, and Elvira Madigan at the Music Hall. And as
a special feature, there are two Godard films at Berkeley this
Monday. Une Hemme Marie (A Married Woman), and Bande
A Part (A Band of Outsiders), will be shown at 8:00 in Wheeler
Auditorium. ... . , %1 -

It seems like the best entertainment has been on television
these days. After last Sunday's shocker, the next program of
note maybe Hubert what's-his-name, or better yet, Ho shouting
into A. Harriman's ear trumpet.
On the less political scene, there are some entertainment fea
tures to note. If you haven't seen ACT's Tiny Alice, you have
another chance Sunday at 2 at the Geary Theater. Tonight and
tomorrow night Misanthrope is at the Geary and A Delicate
Balance at the Marines' Memorial Theatre. Performances begin
at 8:.30.
"Fortnne anil Men's Eyes," John Herbert's controversial
piny about life behind bars continues its run at the Encore
Theatre (422 Mason, San Francisco). The play is performed
nightly Monday through Friday at 8:30 and twice on Saturday
at 7 and 10 p.m. and Sunday at 0 arul 9 p.m. "You're A Good
Man, Charlie Brown" continues at the IJttle Fox Theater (533
Pacific).
Rod McKuen, who says he has a voice "that makes you want to
clear your throat," will sing at the San Jose Givic Auditorium
tonight at 8:30 and tomorrow night in the Berkeley Community
Theater at the same time. The poot-singcr-composer is at times
trite, but he puts on an interesting show.
Two talented Black musicians, The Pair Extraordinaire begin
a two-week run at the El Matador on Monday. The Pair has
just returned from a cross-country tour with comedian Bill Cosby.
Easily at home with pure jazz and Motown sound, the Pair are
well worth hearing.
The ballet season is underway. "Ballet '68" presents its first
program in its new home, Presentation Theatre, 2350 Turk.
Four ballets will be danced-. "Pas de Six," "Facets," "La Peri,"
and "Giocoso." Leading roles will be danced by Virginia John
son, Lynda Meyer, Victoria Gyorfi, and David Coll. The
program begins at 8:30 tonight and tomorrow night.
The San Francisco Symphony will present an all-Mozart pro
gram at 8:15 tomorrow evening in the Foothill College Gym
nasium. This will be the orchestra's last appearance before it
leaves on a three-week tour of Japan.
There are barely enough good films to fill the weekend, how
ever the industrious and undaunted filmphiles will find a few
worth the effort of seeing. Friday Tresidder is showing Truffaut's
Jules and Jim, starring Jenne Moreau and Oskar Werner, with
performances at 7:30, 8:30 and 9:30. After this easy local "find"
there is not much else in the area. King of Hearts, is playing at
the Altos International, unfortunately with Live for Life, which
is a combination of A Man and a Woman, The Graduate, and
Paradise Lost.
Bonnie and. Clyde, by far the best picture of the year, is still
at the Bijou, and the film deserves to be seen by itself, even
though The Jokers, which accompanies Bonnie and Clyde is
not that bad (or good, but simply entertaining). Two films in
the city are worth traveling for, Closely Watched Trains, at the
Bridge Theatre, and Elvira Madigan at the Music Hall. And as
a special feature, there are two Godard films at Berkeley this
Monday. Une Hemme Marie (A Married Woman), and Bande
A Part (A Band of Outsiders), will be shown at 8:00 in Wheeler
Auditorium. ... . , %1 -
