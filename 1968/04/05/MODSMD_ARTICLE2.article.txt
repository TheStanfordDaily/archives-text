# Student Representation On Academic Senate?
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
A movement is afoot to put
students on the proposed Aca
demic Senate, which will be
voted on today by the faculty.
Last night the student legisla
ture passed unanimously a reso
lution calling for non-voting stu
dent members on the Senate.
They will fill "a need for im
proved communication between

faculty and students," LASSU
said.
Co m p u t e r Scioncc Prof.
Jerome Feldman has submitted
an amendment to the Academic
Senate charter which would pro
vide five ex-officio student mem
bers. "The administration has
the same sort of representa
tion," he points out.
In the original Academic Sen
ate plan of June, 1967, five vot
ing student members were en
visioned. But student govern
ment officers attacked the plan
as "tokenism." Faculty didn't
think much of it, either.
So the Academic Council's Ex
ecutive Committee deleted the
provision from the charter as
presented to faculty last month.
That charter calls for a repre
sentative legislature of 53 fac
ulty, elected by the various
schools.
"Students could voice opinions
which could have some influ
ence," Feldman feels. He says
he has "no notion" as to
whether the amendment will be
accepted.
It is one of several proposed
to the Executive Committee for
the Council's consideration at
their meeting today at 4:15 in
Dinkelsipel. Others, according to
committee chairman Kenneth J.
Arrow, concern relations be
tween the Council and the Sen
ate and technical points about
the University president's deal
ing with the Senate.
Arrow sees the amendments
as "very minor points." He is
confident the charter will be ap
proved. "There's yet to be any
one against it,"he comments.
The various schools would de
cide how to choose their repre
sentatives later this month. Tho
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, with 25 of the 53 seats,
plans to meet April 15 to select
one of three plans to apportion
the seats among various de
partments and blocks of depart
ments.
In other actions last night, the

student legislature approved a
$2,000 appropriation for a two
week visit later this month by
musician Cecil Taylor. Taylor
will play at seven student resi
dences.
LASSU also allocated $1,050
for the Days of Concern pro
gram on the "University in a
Time of Crisis" April 12 and 13.
A five-point referendum was
proposed by LASSU for the days
of the primary election for the
ASSU president, May 7 and 8.
The referendum will concern
on-campus job recruiting, Stan
ford membership in NSA, and
terminal graduate student mem
bership in ASSU.
God save the meek.
