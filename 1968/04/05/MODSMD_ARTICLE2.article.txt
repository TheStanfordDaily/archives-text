# Student Representation On Academic Senate?
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
A movement is afoot to put
students on the proposed Aca
demic Senate, which will be
voted on today by the faculty.
Last night the student legisla
ture passed unanimously a reso
lution calling for non-voting stu
dent members on the Senate.
They will fill "a need for im
proved communication between

faculty and students," LASSU
said.
Co m p u t e r Scioncc Prof.
Jerome Feldman has submitted
an amendment to the Academic
Senate charter which would pro
vide five ex-officio student mem
bers. "The administration has
the same sort of representa
tion," he points out.
