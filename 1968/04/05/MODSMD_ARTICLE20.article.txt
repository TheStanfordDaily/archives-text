# Judge Nixes Bike Lawsuit
## 
### 
A lawsuit resulting from a
bicycle accident on campus was
thrown out of court by a jury
recently.
A Superior Court jury under
Judge Peter Anello refused to
grant Stephen Dixon the $5,000
in damages and $40 for a new
bike that he had sought from
the university in his lawsuit.
Dixon, of 3055 Waverley St.,
Palo Alto, complained that on
July 15 he was riding his bike
down a campus patli when he
ran into an obscured guard post.
He was thrown off his bike and
received "grievous personal in
juries," he said.
Because of his injuries, he
claimed, he lost money from a
part - time teaching job at Stan
lord, $15 a week for posing for
an art class, $500 a month from
a summer job in New York,
and a $1,000 - advance from a
New York publisher for his
novel.
Dixon said he was unable to
work on the novel because of
the traumatic effects of the ac
cident.
The jury, however, ruled that
Dixon himself was at fault be
cause he had ridden down the
same path on several other oc
casions when it was daylight
and knew the guard post was
there.
