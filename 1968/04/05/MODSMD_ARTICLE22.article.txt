# Lutheran Church To Be Dedicated
## 
### 
The new University Lutheran
Church and Lutheran Center at
Stanford will be formally dedi
cated at 4 this Sunday afternoon
by the Rev. George Spindt,
Southwest Synod of the Luth
eran Church in America.
The dedication service will
feature a new eucharistic litur
gy written by members of the
Lutheran Community.
The $225,000 complex has just
been completed in College Ter
race at the corner of Stanford
Avenue and Bowdoin, behind
the new fraternity cluster.
The dedication is part of a
day long program of activities
which includes morning wor
ship with the singing of a
Bach cantata at 10:30, the per
formance of two one-act plays
by Berthold Brecht at 11:20,
lunch at 12:20, and a panel
discussion at 1:30 p.m. All
events are open to the pub
lic.
The panel will discuss "The
Role of the Church in the Uni
versity Community." Panelists

are B. Davie Napier, Dean of the
Chapel, Berkeley Lutheran pas
tor Bill Youngdahl, Charles Fer
guson, Head of the Linguistics
Department, and Kirk Hanson,
chairman of the Catholic Com
munity and former editor of The
Stanford Daily.
The new center and church
has been constructed under the
supervision of the Campus Luth
eran Church Council, as well as
the leadership of the two full
time Lutheran campus minist
ers, Pastor Rudy Johnson and
Campus Associate Nancy Hu
seth.
The council consists of four
undergraduates, four graduates,
and four non-student members
of the community. The council
provides leadership for the com
munity and coordinates the bud
get and program.
The new center consists of
two buildings connected by a
long walkway. The contempor
ary architecture is by Derk Vyn
of Palo Alto, and has a definite
Japanese flavor. One building is

a hexagonal chapel topped by
a geometric spire. The hand
made rosewood altar is set at
the center of the chapel.
The building is equipped
with stagelights so that it may
also be used as a small the
ater in the round. Pastor John
son expressed the hope that
other Stanford groups would
use the room for drama. The
Brecht plays will be presented
there Sunday morning. The
chapel seats 120 and an ad
joining vestibule can be used
for art exhibits.
The other building has a large
lounge with fireplace, a fully
equipped kitchen, offices for
Pastor Johnson and Nancy
Huseth, and a large seminar
room. The center will be open
every day and at least three
nights a week starting imme
diately.
The center will represent all
three national Lutheran bodies:
the American Lutheran Church,
the Lutheran Church in Amer
ica, and the Missouri Synod
Lutheran Church. However, it is
a University Congregation, and
as such is somewhat unique,
as are Lutheran University Con
gregations at Harvard and Cor
nell.
Membership in the congre
gation is open to any baptized
Christian and members do not
have to give up their membership
in any other church in order to
belong.
This ecumenical spirit Is evi
dent in the Lutheran's involve
ment with the University
Christian Movement (UCM)
on campus. Most actvlties of
the Lutheran community are
conducted In common with
the other members of the
UCM.
However, the Lutherans have
chosen to establish their own
center, primarily for worship.
"We are an extension of the
common activities going on on
campus," explains Nancy Hu
seth.
"We see worship as the cen
tral part of our program."
Lutheran Sunday services
were first held in 1965 in Es
«yidido School after both Pas
tor Johnson and Miss Huseth
came during that year. A place
was sought for weekly worship
and the decision was finally

made to build the Lutheran Cen
ter.
The Lutheran group does not
intend the new building as a
sign of either isolated denomi
nationalism or a strict institu
tionalism. "We are not dedi
cating the building as a monu
ment," says Nancy Huseth.

"It is a way, a tool, for us to
become involved in life. We don't
want the rigidity of the insti
tutional Church. We want it to
be moving continually. The
Church is at the point of ask
ing itself what its role in society
is."
