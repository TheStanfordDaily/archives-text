# French Students Win Coed Visiting Rights
## 
### 
French university students
have won the right to have open
house hours in their dormi
tories. Coed visiting will be per
mitted between the hours of 2
p.m. and 11 p.m.
Up to now in France's 90 uni
versities, room visits between
male and female students, what
ever their age, were strictly for
bidden. Girls and boys could

meet in common rooms, at open
air games, but never—at least
admittedly—alone between four
walls.
This policy reversal follows
large-scale student strikes and
fights with the police and uni
versity authorities for what the
students contend is their consti
tutional right to freedom of
movement.
