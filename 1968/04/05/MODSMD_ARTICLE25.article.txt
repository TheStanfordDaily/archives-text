# Plan Carefully
## Young Lawyer Gives Draft Advice 
### 
With the chances that Con
gress will do anything about the
current draft regulations grow
ing more minuscule every day,
many students will soon be
looking down the barrel of the
Selective Service System.
Michael Tigar, a young Wash
ington lawyer who has handled
many draft cases, and is now
editor-in-chief of a new law jour
nal called the Selective Service
Law Reporter, recently offered
some suggestions about how
students should respond to the
threat of the draft.
His recommendations, based
on a careful study of the cur
rent draft laws and the ad
ministrative regulations that
accompany them, are neces
sarily somewhat broad In
scope, since he could not take
into account the idiosyncracies
of individual draft boards. He
does feel, though, his sugges
tions should be of some help
to prospective draftees in col
leges around the country.
Tigar's basic suggestion for
students is that they plan care
fully in dealing with the Select
ive Service System. Many stu
dents take the position that the
best way to avoid the draft is to
ignore it, in hopes that it will
go away. Tigar says that is a
fundamental mistake.
"Don't stay away from your
draft board," Tigar says; "Go to
the board and look in your file.
If you can't go yourself, you
can designate someone else In
writing—preferably a member
of your family—to check youi
file for you. And besides that„

consult someone who is compe
tent in Selective Service law."
Tigar points out that there are
relatively few lawyers who are
knowledgeable about the draft
laws. He says, though, that "in
virtually every large communi
ty there will be one or two law
yers who are qualified."
Tigar recommends consulting
a lawyer early rather than late.
He also feels that "a student
who can afford to pay (the law
yer's fee) should do so. There
are a lot of indigent registrants,
and many lawyers are eager to
work on behalf of these people,
but they can't do it without
some financial resources."
In the matter of classifica
tions, Tigar recommends that
students NOT get a 11-S (stu
dent) deferment if they can
avoid it, since anyone who has
held a 11-S since July 1, 1967,
will not be eligible for a 111-A
(family) deferment after los
ing his n-S. If a registrant
has been automatically grant
ed a 11-S, though, rather than
applying for it, the restriction
on getting a 111-A doesn't ap
ply-
In any case, Tigar suggests
that any student who believes
he may qualify for a deferment
other than 11-S should make the
effort to obtain it. Some of the
steps he suggests are:
• If there is a change of a
registrant being disqualified for
medical reasons, he should look
into the matter on his own.
Classification physicals are a
"mass production" process, in
which subtle physical disquali

fications often escape the atten
tion of the examiners.
The Army's book on medical
standards for draftees is avail
able to the public through the
Government Printing Office in
Washington. Registrants are ad
vised to see a doctor to deter
mine if they are disqualified un
der the standards set by the
Army.
• Registrants should look into
the possibility of getting a 111-A
deferment if they have depen
dents. Tigar emphasizes that de
pendency deferments are possi
ble even when the dependency
is of a physical or emotional na
ture, rather than simply finan
cial.
• Registrants who are think
ing about applying for conscien
tious objector status should be
gin working on it right away.
The best source of information
on C.O. questions, according to
Tigar, is the handbook published
by the Central Committee for
Conscientious Objection, whose
offices are at 206 Walnut St.,
Philadelphia, Pa.
According to Tigar, there are
several popular misconceptions
about getting C.O. status.
One is that to be designated
a C.0., a registrant must be a
member of a "peace church,"
such as the Quakers or the
Jehovah's Witnesses. Under
present laws, this is entirely
false. Another is that a C.O.
must be a complete pacifist.
On the contrary, a C.O. must
only be opposed to "war in
any form." He can be willing
to fight to defend himself, his

home, his family, etc., and
still qualify as a C.O.
A third misconception is that
a C.0., after being designated
I-A-0 or I-O, will be called to
alternative or non-combatant
service right away. In fact, he
cannot legally be called untTl
his name comes to the head of
the order of call.
Finally, many registrants don't
realize that a C.O. applicant
need not believe in an anthropo
morphic God. As a result of the
Supreme Court's decision in the
case of Daniel Seeger, a C.O.
can base his objection to war on
a deeply-rooted value system
that has the same function In
his life as the belief in God does
in the life of a religious man.
In his actual dealings with
his board, Tigar says, a regis
trant should not take the posi
tion that the less he has to do
with it, the better. Tigar recom
mends that every registrant find
out what is in his file, and make
sure that all his dealings with
his board are recorded in it, if
possible.
He also suggests that a regis
trant take advantage of the sec

tion of the draft law that entl
ties him to a personal appear
ance each time the board recon
siders his case. "This can be a
very valuable means of trying
to deal with their views," says
Tigar.
When a registrant runs into
hostility from his board, he
can ask the government ap
peals agent to intercede. Each
board has an appeals agent,
who is usually a local lawyer.
The agent represents both the
board and its registrants, and
he is usually in a better posi
tion than the board members
to Interpret the law.
If a registrant is called for
induction, and has appealed his
case as far as he can within the
Selective Service System, he
must go through the induction
process up until the point that
he is called to step forward and
take the oath, if he wants to
take his case to court. He
should then refuse to step for
ward.
Tigar emphasizes, though, that
it is essential for a registrant to
consult a lawyer long before he
is that far along in the process.

about getting C.O. status.
One is that to be designated
a C.0., a registrant must be a
member of a "peace church,"
such as the Quakers or the
Jehovah's Witnesses. Under
present laws, this is entirely
false. Another is that a C.O.
must be a complete pacifist.
On the contrary, a C.O. must
only be opposed to "war in
any form." He can be willing
to fight to defend himself, his

home, his family, etc., and
still qualify as a C.O.
A third misconception is that
a C.0., after being designated
I-A-0 or I-O, will be called to
alternative or non-combatant
service right away. In fact, he
cannot legally be called untTl
his name comes to the head of
the order of call.
Finally, many registrants don't
realize that a C.O. applicant
need not believe in an anthropo
morphic God. As a result of the
Supreme Court's decision in the
case of Daniel Seeger, a C.O.
can base his objection to war on
a deeply-rooted value system
that has the same function In
his life as the belief in God does
in the life of a religious man.
In his actual dealings with
his board, Tigar says, a regis
trant should not take the posi
tion that the less he has to do
with it, the better. Tigar recom
mends that every registrant find
out what is in his file, and make
sure that all his dealings with
his board are recorded in it, if
possible.
He also suggests that a regis
trant take advantage of the sec

tion of the draft law that entl
ties him to a personal appear
ance each time the board recon
siders his case. "This can be a
very valuable means of trying
to deal with their views," says
Tigar.
When a registrant runs into
hostility from his board, he
can ask the government ap
peals agent to intercede. Each
board has an appeals agent,
who is usually a local lawyer.
The agent represents both the
board and its registrants, and
he is usually in a better posi
tion than the board members
to Interpret the law.
If a registrant is called for
induction, and has appealed his
case as far as he can within the
Selective Service System, he
must go through the induction
process up until the point that
he is called to step forward and
take the oath, if he wants to
take his case to court. He
should then refuse to step for
ward.
Tigar emphasizes, though, that
it is essential for a registrant to
consult a lawyer long before he
is that far along in the process.
With the chances that Con
gress will do anything about the
current draft regulations grow
ing more minuscule every day,
many students will soon be
looking down the barrel of the
Selective Service System.
Michael Tigar, a young Wash
ington lawyer who has handled
many draft cases, and is now
editor-in-chief of a new law jour
nal called the Selective Service
Law Reporter, recently offered
some suggestions about how
students should respond to the
threat of the draft.
His recommendations, based
on a careful study of the cur
rent draft laws and the ad
ministrative regulations that
accompany them, are neces
sarily somewhat broad In
scope, since he could not take
into account the idiosyncracies
of individual draft boards. He
does feel, though, his sugges
tions should be of some help
to prospective draftees in col
leges around the country.
Tigar's basic suggestion for
students is that they plan care
fully in dealing with the Select
ive Service System. Many stu
dents take the position that the
best way to avoid the draft is to
ignore it, in hopes that it will
go away. Tigar says that is a
fundamental mistake.
"Don't stay away from your
draft board," Tigar says; "Go to
the board and look in your file.
If you can't go yourself, you
can designate someone else In
writing—preferably a member
of your family—to check youi
file for you. And besides that„

consult someone who is compe
tent in Selective Service law."
Tigar points out that there are
relatively few lawyers who are
knowledgeable about the draft
laws. He says, though, that "in
virtually every large communi
ty there will be one or two law
yers who are qualified."
Tigar recommends consulting
a lawyer early rather than late.
He also feels that "a student
who can afford to pay (the law
yer's fee) should do so. There
are a lot of indigent registrants,
and many lawyers are eager to
work on behalf of these people,
but they can't do it without
some financial resources."
In the matter of classifica
tions, Tigar recommends that
students NOT get a 11-S (stu
dent) deferment if they can
avoid it, since anyone who has
held a 11-S since July 1, 1967,
will not be eligible for a 111-A
(family) deferment after los
ing his n-S. If a registrant
has been automatically grant
ed a 11-S, though, rather than
applying for it, the restriction
on getting a 111-A doesn't ap
ply-
In any case, Tigar suggests
that any student who believes
he may qualify for a deferment
other than 11-S should make the
effort to obtain it. Some of the
steps he suggests are:
• If there is a change of a
registrant being disqualified for
medical reasons, he should look
into the matter on his own.
Classification physicals are a
"mass production" process, in
which subtle physical disquali

fications often escape the atten
tion of the examiners.
The Army's book on medical
standards for draftees is avail
able to the public through the
Government Printing Office in
Washington. Registrants are ad
vised to see a doctor to deter
mine if they are disqualified un
der the standards set by the
Army.
• Registrants should look into
the possibility of getting a 111-A
deferment if they have depen
dents. Tigar emphasizes that de
pendency deferments are possi
ble even when the dependency
is of a physical or emotional na
ture, rather than simply finan
cial.
• Registrants who are think
ing about applying for conscien
tious objector status should be
gin working on it right away.
The best source of information
on C.O. questions, according to
Tigar, is the handbook published
by the Central Committee for
Conscientious Objection, whose
offices are at 206 Walnut St.,
Philadelphia, Pa.

file for you. And besides that„

consult someone who is compe
tent in Selective Service law."
Tigar points out that there are
relatively few lawyers who are
knowledgeable about the draft
laws. He says, though, that "in
virtually every large communi
ty there will be one or two law
yers who are qualified."
Tigar recommends consulting
a lawyer early rather than late.
He also feels that "a student
who can afford to pay (the law
yer's fee) should do so. There
are a lot of indigent registrants,
and many lawyers are eager to
work on behalf of these people,
but they can't do it without
some financial resources."
In the matter of classifica
tions, Tigar recommends that
students NOT get a 11-S (stu
dent) deferment if they can
avoid it, since anyone who has
held a 11-S since July 1, 1967,
will not be eligible for a 111-A
(family) deferment after los
ing his n-S. If a registrant
has been automatically grant
ed a 11-S, though, rather than
applying for it, the restriction
on getting a 111-A doesn't ap
ply-
In any case, Tigar suggests
that any student who believes
he may qualify for a deferment
other than 11-S should make the
effort to obtain it. Some of the
steps he suggests are:
• If there is a change of a
registrant being disqualified for
medical reasons, he should look
into the matter on his own.
Classification physicals are a
"mass production" process, in
which subtle physical disquali

fications often escape the atten
tion of the examiners.
The Army's book on medical
standards for draftees is avail
able to the public through the
Government Printing Office in
Washington. Registrants are ad
vised to see a doctor to deter
mine if they are disqualified un
der the standards set by the
Army.
• Registrants should look into
the possibility of getting a 111-A
deferment if they have depen
dents. Tigar emphasizes that de
pendency deferments are possi
ble even when the dependency
is of a physical or emotional na
ture, rather than simply finan
cial.
• Registrants who are think
ing about applying for conscien
tious objector status should be
gin working on it right away.
The best source of information
on C.O. questions, according to
Tigar, is the handbook published
by the Central Committee for
Conscientious Objection, whose
offices are at 206 Walnut St.,
Philadelphia, Pa.
According to Tigar, there are
several popular misconceptions
about getting C.O. status.
One is that to be designated
a C.0., a registrant must be a
member of a "peace church,"
such as the Quakers or the
Jehovah's Witnesses. Under
present laws, this is entirely
false. Another is that a C.O.
must be a complete pacifist.
On the contrary, a C.O. must
only be opposed to "war in
any form." He can be willing
to fight to defend himself, his

home, his family, etc., and
still qualify as a C.O.
A third misconception is that
a C.0., after being designated
I-A-0 or I-O, will be called to
alternative or non-combatant
service right away. In fact, he
cannot legally be called untTl
his name comes to the head of
the order of call.
Finally, many registrants don't
realize that a C.O. applicant
need not believe in an anthropo
morphic God. As a result of the
Supreme Court's decision in the
case of Daniel Seeger, a C.O.
can base his objection to war on
a deeply-rooted value system
that has the same function In
his life as the belief in God does
in the life of a religious man.
In his actual dealings with
his board, Tigar says, a regis
trant should not take the posi
tion that the less he has to do
with it, the better. Tigar recom
mends that every registrant find
out what is in his file, and make
sure that all his dealings with
his board are recorded in it, if
possible.
He also suggests that a regis
trant take advantage of the sec

tion of the draft law that entl
ties him to a personal appear
ance each time the board recon
siders his case. "This can be a
very valuable means of trying
to deal with their views," says
Tigar.
When a registrant runs into
hostility from his board, he
can ask the government ap
peals agent to intercede. Each
board has an appeals agent,
who is usually a local lawyer.
The agent represents both the
board and its registrants, and
he is usually in a better posi
tion than the board members
to Interpret the law.
If a registrant is called for
induction, and has appealed his
case as far as he can within the
Selective Service System, he
must go through the induction
process up until the point that
he is called to step forward and
take the oath, if he wants to
take his case to court. He
should then refuse to step for
ward.
Tigar emphasizes, though, that
it is essential for a registrant to
consult a lawyer long before he
is that far along in the process.
With the chances that Con
gress will do anything about the
current draft regulations grow
ing more minuscule every day,
many students will soon be
looking down the barrel of the
Selective Service System.
Michael Tigar, a young Wash
ington lawyer who has handled
many draft cases, and is now
editor-in-chief of a new law jour
nal called the Selective Service
Law Reporter, recently offered
some suggestions about how
students should respond to the
threat of the draft.
His recommendations, based
on a careful study of the cur
rent draft laws and the ad
ministrative regulations that
accompany them, are neces
sarily somewhat broad In
scope, since he could not take
into account the idiosyncracies
of individual draft boards. He
does feel, though, his sugges
tions should be of some help
to prospective draftees in col
leges around the country.
Tigar's basic suggestion for
students is that they plan care
fully in dealing with the Select
ive Service System. Many stu
dents take the position that the
best way to avoid the draft is to
ignore it, in hopes that it will
go away. Tigar says that is a
fundamental mistake.
"Don't stay away from your
draft board," Tigar says; "Go to
the board and look in your file.
If you can't go yourself, you
can designate someone else In
writing—preferably a member
of your family—to check youi
file for you. And besides that„

consult someone who is compe
tent in Selective Service law."
Tigar points out that there are
relatively few lawyers who are

mends that every registrant find
out what is in his file, and make
sure that all his dealings with
his board are recorded in it, if
possible.
He also suggests that a regis
trant take advantage of the sec

tion of the draft law that entl
ties him to a personal appear
ance each time the board recon
siders his case. "This can be a
very valuable means of trying
to deal with their views," says
Tigar.
When a registrant runs into
hostility from his board, he
can ask the government ap
peals agent to intercede. Each
board has an appeals agent,
who is usually a local lawyer.
The agent represents both the
board and its registrants, and
he is usually in a better posi
tion than the board members
to Interpret the law.
If a registrant is called for
induction, and has appealed his
case as far as he can within the
Selective Service System, he
must go through the induction
process up until the point that
he is called to step forward and
take the oath, if he wants to
take his case to court. He
should then refuse to step for
ward.
Tigar emphasizes, though, that
it is essential for a registrant to
consult a lawyer long before he
is that far along in the process.
With the chances that Con
gress will do anything about the
current draft regulations grow
ing more minuscule every day,
many students will soon be
looking down the barrel of the
Selective Service System.
Michael Tigar, a young Wash
ington lawyer who has handled
many draft cases, and is now
editor-in-chief of a new law jour
nal called the Selective Service
Law Reporter, recently offered
some suggestions about how
students should respond to the
threat of the draft.
His recommendations, based
on a careful study of the cur
rent draft laws and the ad
ministrative regulations that
accompany them, are neces
sarily somewhat broad In
scope, since he could not take
into account the idiosyncracies
of individual draft boards. He
does feel, though, his sugges
tions should be of some help
to prospective draftees in col
leges around the country.
Tigar's basic suggestion for
students is that they plan care
fully in dealing with the Select
ive Service System. Many stu
dents take the position that the
best way to avoid the draft is to
ignore it, in hopes that it will
go away. Tigar says that is a
fundamental mistake.
"Don't stay away from your
draft board," Tigar says; "Go to
the board and look in your file.
If you can't go yourself, you
can designate someone else In
writing—preferably a member
of your family—to check youi
file for you. And besides that„

consult someone who is compe
tent in Selective Service law."
Tigar points out that there are
relatively few lawyers who are
knowledgeable about the draft
laws. He says, though, that "in
virtually every large communi
ty there will be one or two law
yers who are qualified."
Tigar recommends consulting
a lawyer early rather than late.
He also feels that "a student
who can afford to pay (the law
yer's fee) should do so. There
are a lot of indigent registrants,
and many lawyers are eager to
work on behalf of these people,
but they can't do it without
some financial resources."
In the matter of classifica
tions, Tigar recommends that
students NOT get a 11-S (stu
dent) deferment if they can
avoid it, since anyone who has
held a 11-S since July 1, 1967,
will not be eligible for a 111-A
(family) deferment after los
ing his n-S. If a registrant
has been automatically grant
ed a 11-S, though, rather than
applying for it, the restriction
on getting a 111-A doesn't ap
ply-
In any case, Tigar suggests
that any student who believes
he may qualify for a deferment
other than 11-S should make the
effort to obtain it. Some of the
steps he suggests are:
• If there is a change of a
registrant being disqualified for
medical reasons, he should look
into the matter on his own.
Classification physicals are a
"mass production" process, in
which subtle physical disquali

fications often escape the atten
tion of the examiners.
The Army's book on medical
standards for draftees is avail
able to the public through the
Government Printing Office in
Washington. Registrants are ad
vised to see a doctor to deter
mine if they are disqualified un
der the standards set by the
Army.
• Registrants should look into
the possibility of getting a 111-A
deferment if they have depen
dents. Tigar emphasizes that de
pendency deferments are possi
ble even when the dependency
is of a physical or emotional na
ture, rather than simply finan
cial.
• Registrants who are think
ing about applying for conscien
tious objector status should be
gin working on it right away.
The best source of information
on C.O. questions, according to
Tigar, is the handbook published
by the Central Committee for
Conscientious Objection, whose
offices are at 206 Walnut St.,
Philadelphia, Pa.
According to Tigar, there are
several popular misconceptions
about getting C.O. status.
One is that to be designated
a C.0., a registrant must be a
member of a "peace church,"
such as the Quakers or the
Jehovah's Witnesses. Under
present laws, this is entirely
false. Another is that a C.O.
must be a complete pacifist.
On the contrary, a C.O. must
only be opposed to "war in
any form." He can be willing
to fight to defend himself, his

home, his family, etc., and
still qualify as a C.O.
A third misconception is that
a C.0., after being designated
I-A-0 or I-O, will be called to
alternative or non-combatant
service right away. In fact, he
cannot legally be called untTl
his name comes to the head of
the order of call.
Finally, many registrants don't
realize that a C.O. applicant
need not believe in an anthropo
morphic God. As a result of the
Supreme Court's decision in the
case of Daniel Seeger, a C.O.
can base his objection to war on
a deeply-rooted value system
that has the same function In
his life as the belief in God does
in the life of a religious man.
In his actual dealings with
his board, Tigar says, a regis
trant should not take the posi
tion that the less he has to do
with it, the better. Tigar recom
mends that every registrant find
out what is in his file, and make
sure that all his dealings with
his board are recorded in it, if
possible.
He also suggests that a regis
trant take advantage of the sec

tion of the draft law that entl
ties him to a personal appear
ance each time the board recon
