From an East Palo Alto bar
becue restaurant which increas
ed receipts by 50 per cent to a
nuclear instrument firm that
needed a corporate plan, Stan
ford business school students
and area small business firms
are helping each other.
A unique small business train
ing course, developed by Prof.
Frank Shallenberger in the
Graduate School of Business
provides "live" case study prob
lems for students and gives be
leaguered small firms free Stan
ford management "brains."
Last fall, the two-quarter
course enrolled 106 second
year students, roughly 40 per
cent of the entire class, ac
cording to a report in the cur
rent edition of the Business
School Bulletin.
The field projects, the most
exciting part of the course, rang
ed from the problems of a one

man upholstered shop doing a
yearly gross of $12,000 to a re
tail discount house grossing $21
million annually.
Prof. Shallenberger and his
assistant, research associate
Kirk Knight, provided some of
the small business leads for
some of the students.
Others volunteered to help
Negro, Mexican - American and
other minority group business
men through the Santa Clara
County office of the Office of
Economic Opportunity.
A third group of students
simply "walked in" cold and of
fered their help.
One such "walk-in" involv
ed student Robert Bell (5575
Creston Dr., San Diego), who
holds a master's degree in
chemistry and served as a
teacher and principal in the
Congo before coming to Stan
ford.

Bell happened to dine at John
Carter's East Palo Alto "Bar-
B-Q Pit Drive-In" and wound
up guiding Carter from a 25 seat
family restaurant to one en
visioning 125 seats with a cock
tail lounge and game room.
Bell's project as a member of
the Small Business Management
class allowed him to work with
Carter to develop a regular din
ner service, conduct long- and
short-term marketing studies,
overhaul bookkeeping, launch a
promotion program to attract
more customers, and change
menu planning from the day
before to two weeks in advance.
Prof. Shallenberger points out
that the small business program
gives needed experience to
potential MBA's right from the
start, and also shows the small
businessman the need for MBA
skills he might not have known
about.

businessman the need for MBA
skills he might not have known
about.
From an East Palo Alto bar
becue restaurant which increas
ed receipts by 50 per cent to a
nuclear instrument firm that
needed a corporate plan, Stan
ford business school students
and area small business firms
are helping each other.
A unique small business train
ing course, developed by Prof.
Frank Shallenberger in the
Graduate School of Business
provides "live" case study prob
lems for students and gives be
leaguered small firms free Stan
ford management "brains."
Last fall, the two-quarter
course enrolled 106 second
year students, roughly 40 per
cent of the entire class, ac
cording to a report in the cur
rent edition of the Business
School Bulletin.
The field projects, the most
exciting part of the course, rang
ed from the problems of a one

man upholstered shop doing a
yearly gross of $12,000 to a re
tail discount house grossing $21
million annually.
Prof. Shallenberger and his
assistant, research associate
Kirk Knight, provided some of
the small business leads for
some of the students.
Others volunteered to help
Negro, Mexican - American and
other minority group business
men through the Santa Clara
County office of the Office of
Economic Opportunity.
A third group of students
simply "walked in" cold and of
fered their help.
One such "walk-in" involv
ed student Robert Bell (5575
Creston Dr., San Diego), who
holds a master's degree in
chemistry and served as a
teacher and principal in the
Congo before coming to Stan
ford.

Bell happened to dine at John
Carter's East Palo Alto "Bar-
B-Q Pit Drive-In" and wound
up guiding Carter from a 25 seat
family restaurant to one en
visioning 125 seats with a cock
tail lounge and game room.
Bell's project as a member of
the Small Business Management
class allowed him to work with
Carter to develop a regular din
ner service, conduct long- and
short-term marketing studies,
overhaul bookkeeping, launch a
promotion program to attract
more customers, and change
menu planning from the day
before to two weeks in advance.
Prof. Shallenberger points out
that the small business program
gives needed experience to
potential MBA's right from the
start, and also shows the small
businessman the need for MBA
skills he might not have known
about.
