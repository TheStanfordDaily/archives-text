## 
### 
Stanford University — (Spe
cial) . . . The Stanford Track
and Field Team enters the con
ference wars this weekend at
Pullman, Washington, against
the improved Washington State
Cougars.
A strong Tribe showing
against Fresno State last week
end boosted the Indians' dual
meet ledger to 2-1, but the Cou
gars will be the favorites Sat
urday.
So far this year, Tribe rec
ord holders Peter Boyce and
lan Arnold in the high jump
and triple jump respectively
have upped their marks.
Boyce soared 7-3 at Fresno
last week to set a new Aus
tralian record and to push him
into contention for an Olym
pic medal, while Arnold cap
tured first in the San Jose
State - Occidental Triangular
meet with a 49-7 jump.
The two leapers might soon
have company in the record
book. Transfer Tom Colby, a
top javelin thrower, becomes eli

gible this quarter and has al
ready thrown 249-3 while com
peting for the Santa Clara
Youth Village. This mark is
eight feet above the existing
school record held by Art Batch
elder.
Distance man Bob Anchondo
also became eligible April 1, and
Stanford coach Pay ton Jordan
believes his eligiblity will add to
the Tribe's potential strength.
Anchondo ran a 4:12.5 mile last
spring.
The sprinting corps came
of age last Saturday and con
tributed to the 78-66 win over
Fresno State. Andy Sears
snared firsts in both the 100
and the 220 with times of
9.9 and 21.4 and Roger Cox
was a close second in both
races. The sprinters also re
corded a season best of 41.4
in the 440 yard relay.
Several sophomores have
proved themselves steady com
petitors in the meets to date,
has already run 9:00.4 in the
Distance runner Greg Brock

two mile and won the mile at
Fresno besides posting a strong
double in the three mile. And
Len Mogno has added *hree
feet on to his best shot put
mark already this year and is
at 53-0. Brock, of course, faces
a strong challenge at the two
mile distance in W.S.U.'s Gerry
Lindgren, two time NCAA Cross
Country Champion and a prob
able Olympian this year.
The Cougars, who placed ninth
in the NCAA Championships
last year, have another power
ful team. To go against Stan
ford's strength in the javelin
will be Foss Mililer (229-6) and
Stuart Hemmings (22-0), and
a trio of 9.6 or better 100 men
could give Stanford some trouble
in the sprints. In fact, the
Cougars have at least one top
performer in every event ex
cept the pole vault, where their
16-5% performer, Jim Precht, is
injured. The Indians have an
edge in outdoor experience, as
the Northlanders have compet
ed only twice outdoors and have
not yet reached their peak.

meet ledger to 2-1, but the Cou
gars will be the favorites Sat
urday.
So far this year, Tribe rec
ord holders Peter Boyce and
lan Arnold in the high jump
and triple jump respectively
have upped their marks.
Boyce soared 7-3 at Fresno
last week to set a new Aus
tralian record and to push him
into contention for an Olym
pic medal, while Arnold cap
tured first in the San Jose
State - Occidental Triangular
meet with a 49-7 jump.
The two leapers might soon
have company in the record
book. Transfer Tom Colby, a
top javelin thrower, becomes eli

gible this quarter and has al
ready thrown 249-3 while com
peting for the Santa Clara
Youth Village. This mark is
eight feet above the existing
school record held by Art Batch
elder.
Distance man Bob Anchondo
also became eligible April 1, and
Stanford coach Pay ton Jordan
believes his eligiblity will add to
the Tribe's potential strength.
Anchondo ran a 4:12.5 mile last
spring.
The sprinting corps came
of age last Saturday and con
tributed to the 78-66 win over
Fresno State. Andy Sears
snared firsts in both the 100
and the 220 with times of
9.9 and 21.4 and Roger Cox
was a close second in both
races. The sprinters also re
corded a season best of 41.4
in the 440 yard relay.
Several sophomores have
proved themselves steady com
petitors in the meets to date,
has already run 9:00.4 in the
Distance runner Greg Brock

two mile and won the mile at
Fresno besides posting a strong
double in the three mile. And
Len Mogno has added *hree
feet on to his best shot put
mark already this year and is
at 53-0. Brock, of course, faces
a strong challenge at the two
mile distance in W.S.U.'s Gerry
Lindgren, two time NCAA Cross
Country Champion and a prob
able Olympian this year.
The Cougars, who placed ninth
in the NCAA Championships
last year, have another power
ful team. To go against Stan
ford's strength in the javelin
will be Foss Mililer (229-6) and
Stuart Hemmings (22-0), and
a trio of 9.6 or better 100 men
could give Stanford some trouble
in the sprints. In fact, the
Cougars have at least one top
performer in every event ex
cept the pole vault, where their
16-5% performer, Jim Precht, is
injured. The Indians have an
edge in outdoor experience, as
the Northlanders have compet
ed only twice outdoors and have
not yet reached their peak.
