## Hopes For Peace Talks Sag 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Pres
ident Johnson prepared Thurs
day for a weekend Vietnam
strategy conference in Honolu
lu amid growing caution here
about the prospects of prelimi
nary peace talks.
The White House announced
that talks with former Presi
dent Eisenhower and South Ko
rea's President Park are on
Johnson's schedule.
The growing caution in Wash
ington quarters about peace
talks—in some cases ranging to
pessimism—stems from more
than North Vietnam's accusa
tion of U.S. bombing far north
of the 20th parallel limit set by-
Johnson in his Sunday negotia
tions offer.
The administration was silent
on the status of the diplomatic
exchanges under way in the
wake of the public agreement
for direct U.S.-North Vietna
mese contacts.
• Troops Charge
Students
RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) —
Cavalrymen, swinging sabers,
drove their mounts into a crowd
of 3,000 students near the steps
of a cathedral Thursday after
the military - led government
said it would no longer tolerate
protest demonstrations.
Witnesses said about 25 per
sons were injured.
The cavalrymen had been
heckled as they passed through
downtown streets, many barri
caded and guarded by armed
soldiers, to the cathedral. Jet
fighters roared overhead and

helicopters circled the church
before the cavalry drive.
The troops had taken positions
in the city Thursday morning
after an announcement that 20
memorial services would be
held for the slain youths. Army
units set up light machine guns
at some intersections, but did
not interfere with the crowd
moving toward the cathedral.
• Khe Sanh Relief?
SAIGON (AP) — U.S. relief
forces pulled up within a half
mile of the Marine combat base
at Khe Sanh Thursday amid re
ports the enemy is lifting the
three-month siege as a goodwill
gesture.
Only light artillery and mor
tar fire from the North Viet
namese opposed Marines in the
vanguard of a 20,000-man relief
force. Flown by helicopter,
these Marines occupied hills
just outside Khe Sanh.
Thursday the eight-engine
Stratofortresses dropped hun
dreds of pounds of explosives on
North Vietnamese gun positions
and truck parks around Khe
Sanh.
Informants said war planes
again attacked lines of commu
nications in the North Vietnam
panhandle, stretching south of
the industrial heartland around
Hanoi and the port of Haiphong.
American wounded in the war
last week soared to the highest
in the conflict but the number of
killed declined, the U.S. Com
mand reported.
• Press For Tax Rise
WASHINGTON (AP) The

Johnson Administration will
continue to press for quick
adoption of the 10 per cent in
come tax surcharge and a mili
tary budget approaching $80 bil
lion despite overtures for talks
on Vietnam.
However, the administration
has tabbed removal of the sur
charge — assuming that it is
adopted — as the first step after
peace comes to Vietnam.
A Senate-House conference
committee met Wednesday on a
tax bill but took no action. Its
next meeting is scheduled for
Friday and administration offi
cials are expected to renew
their appeals for the surcharge
at that time.
The Senate added the sur
charge coupled with a $fi-billion
forced cut in spending to a bill
extending the 10 per cent excise
tax on telephone service and th
7 pei - cent manufacture excise
tax on autos.

LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) —
Billonaire Howard Hughes, who
has spent an estimated $125 mil
lion in Las Vegas in one year,
has expanded his empire to the
historic gold and silver mining
land in northern Nevada, it was
learned Thursday.
The Hughes organization gave
no indication of its plans for the
newly-acquircd property.
But John Meier, Hughes'
scientific adviser who negotiat
ed for the property,s aid last
month that gold mining would
be a solution to the U.S crisis in
gold standards
He said then that more than

$12 billion worth of gold in the
California Mother Lode Country
—far to the west of Virginia
City — could be extracted.
• Street Digests News
NEW YORK (AP) — Wall
Street's emotions cooled consid
erably Thursday, and the result
was a 5-million-share drop
from Wednesday's record vol
ume. Prices rose moderately.
Turnover was 14.34 million
shares compared with the 19.29
million rolled up Wednesday,
which was the second time this
week that trading had topped
the 1929 previous record of 16.41
million shares.
From the start it was obvious
that Wall Street had taken a
sober second look at the possible
ramifications of starting peace
talks with North Vietnam. Many
harked back to the 18 months of
peace talks with North Korea,
during which 12,000 American
soldiers lost their lives.

• Saturn 5 Troubles
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla. (AP>
— America's second Saturn 5
super-rocket developed troubles
with three engines and hurled a
132-ton payload into the wrong
orbit Thursday, possibly delay
ing the man-to-the-moon pro
gram by casting doubt whether
the rocket is ready to launch
astronauts.
If it had performed as flaw
lessly as the first super-rocket
mission last Nov. 9, NASA was
prepared to skip a third un
manned test and go directly to
manned Saturn 5 flights.
