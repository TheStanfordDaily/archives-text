### FRED LEESON 
Stanford's varsity tennis team
opons its Pacific-8 schedule to
day and tomorrow with the un
enviable task of meeting the
nation's top two teams—UCLA
and USC—in Los Angeles.
That prospect left Coach Dick
Gould, though confident that his
charges are in top physical and
mental condition, thinking in
terms of where the Indians
could pick up points instead of
victories.
"UCLA is a very well bal
anced team and has tremendous
depth," Gould said as he as
sessed the competition. "South
ern California has less depth
but I think they're stronger at
the top."
Though Stanford, currently 4-
1, has "six good players and
three good doubles teams," the
Indians can't be expected to
cope with the great USC line-up
in singles.
The Trojans top three men,
Stan Smith, Bob Lutz and Steve
Avoyer, are each national cham

pions and their fourth man,
Bob Leonard, is a runner-up.
"Johnny Spiegel has done a
real good job for us lately,"
Gould said of his top singles
man, but the Indian coach was
careful not to spawn deceptive
hopes for an upset of Smith.
Brad Cornell and Chuck Al
loo, in fifth and sixth singles,
carry Stanford's best chances
for victories against USC ac
cording to Gould and the dou
bles teams of Dean Schlobohm-
Brad Cornell, Spiegel-Bob Ripp
ner and Alloo-Jamie Carroll
should hold their own.
"We may get more points
against USC, though UCLA is
not as strong," Gould added as
he noted that the Bruins have
fewer outstanding individuals

than the Trojans but they do
have better depth and balance.
Gary Rose, Roy Barth and
Steve Tidball head the UCLA
contingent and each is national
ly ranked.
Indians Bob Rippner and Rick
Reed, third and fourth singles,
were specially mentioned for
their improvement and Cornell
has been elected team captain.
Stanford's singles line up for
the weekend will be Spiegel,
Schlobohm, Rippner, Reed, Cor
nell and Alloo.
The Indians will get another
shot at the Bruins and Trojans
when UCLA and USC visit here
April 19 and 20. Stanford has
home matches with Wyoming
April 11, Oregon State April 12
and California April 13 at 2 p.m.
