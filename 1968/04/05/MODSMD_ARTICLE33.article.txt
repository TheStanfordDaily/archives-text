# Lacrosse Team Faces SF Club
## 
### 
The San Francisco Lacrosse
Club will try to put the first
blemish on the Stanford Var
sity's undefeated record, when
it visits Stanford this Sunday
for a game beginning at 2 p.m.
The odds seem to be against
the San Francisco team, as they
barely edged Utah 9-7, a team
that Stanford walloped 11-0. The
picture has changed somewhat
since then, however, as the San
Francisco Club has picked up
a new goalie who held the strong
Palo Alto Club scoreless through
two and a half quarters last Sat
urday.
The biggest problem for the
San Franciscans, however, will
be to break Stanford's potent de
fense which is now completely
intact with Wade Killefer and
Nat e√ünchly back in the line-up
to join Bill Eakland, Denny Mc-
Neely, and Buc Wales. It will
lake a herculean effort on San
Francisco's part to score on that
quintet backing up Mel Ellis in
the goal.
