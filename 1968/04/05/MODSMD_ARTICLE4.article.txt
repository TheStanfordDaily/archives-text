President Johnson said "We
have been sadden<Mi" by the

A curfew, which was clamped
on Memphis after a
march turned into a riot a week
ago, was reimposed
Police said incidents of vio

bombings were reported follow

The 1964 Nobel Peace Prize
winner, was standing on the bal

he had come to lead protests in
behalf of the city's 1,300 strik
ing garbage workers, most of
them Negroes, when he was
shot.
Two unidentified men were
arrested several blocks from
the motel. They were arrested
and released several hours later.
As word of King's death
spread through the stunned
city, Negroes in scattered areas
looted stores, stoned police and
fire trucks and tossed several
fire bombs. Two policemen were
injured, mainly by flying glass
when a shotgun blast broke
their windshield.
Four hours after King died,
the city was quieting some but

police still reported sporadic
outbreaks.
Police also said they found
a .30-.06 rifle on Main Street
about one block from the motel,
but it was not confirmed
whether this was the weapon
that killed King.
An aide who was standing
nearby said the shot hit King in

"It really doesn't matter
what happens now. I've been
to the mountalntop."

was a cheering crowd of some
2,000 supporters. It was

of his face.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson said
he and others in the King party
were getting ready to go to din
ner when the shooting occurred.
"King was on the second
floor balcony of the motel,"
Jackson said. "He had just
bent over. If he had been
standing up, he wouldn't have
been hit in the face."
Solomon Jones, King's chauf
feur, said he saw a "man in
white clothes" running from the
scone.
Civil rights and political lead
ers reacted with anguish, shock
and grief ?t the slaying of the
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
in Memphis.
Vice President Hubert H.
Humphrey said the slaying
"brings shame to our country.
An apostle of nonviolence has
been the victim of violence."
The vice president said, how
ever, that his death will bring
new strength to the cause he
fought for.
Former Vice President Rich

ard M. Nixon sent a telegram to
Mrs. King which said: "Dr.
King's death is a great personal
tragedy for everyone who knew
him and a great tragedy for the
nation."
In New York, churches open
ed their doors and readied spe
cial services in Dr. King's hon
or. The Protestant Council of
the City of New York asked that
all churches remain open Fri
day and Saturday so that "all
citizens may bring supplication
to God that the ideals of this
man's life will not be lost."
James Meredith, who was
shot in June, 1966, during a vot
er registration march in Missis

sippi, said, "This is America's
answer to the peaceful, nonvi
olent way of obtaining rights in
this country."
Gov. John Connally of Texas,
victim of a sniper's bullet with
President John F. Kennedy,
said Dr. King "contributed
much to the chaos and turbu
lence in this country, but he did
not deserve this fate ..."
Roy W'ilkins, executive direc
tor of the National Associa
tion for the Advancement of
Colored People, said the
NAACP is "shocked and deep
ly grieved by the dastardly
murder of I)r. Martin Luther
King ... It will not stay the
civil rights movement, It will
Instead spur it to greater ac
tivity."
Leontyne Price, a soprano for
the Metropolitan Opera and a
Negro, said: "What Dr. Martin
Luther King stood for and was,
can never be killed with a bul
let."
Whitney Young, executive di
rector of the National Urban
League: "We are unspeakably
shocked by the murder of Dr.

Martin Luther King, one of the
greatest leaders of our time.
This is a bitter reflection on
America. We fear for our coun
try."
Floyd MeKlssiek, national
dlnnitor of CORE, said that
with Dr. King's death, non
violence "is now a dead phil
osophy.
"This is racism in the most
extreme form, it is truly
American racism," McKissick
said.
"We make no predictions,

hut mark my word, black
Americans of all sorts and be
liefs loved Martin Luther
King."
Jackie Robinson, first Negro
to play in major league baseball
and now an advisor on race re
lations in New York State: "I'm
shocked. Oh my God, I'm fright
ened. I'm very concerned, dis
turbed and very worried. I pray
God this doesn't end up in the
streets."
King had returned to Mem
phis Wednesday to lead an
other massive protest march
next Monday in support of
the garbage strikes. Sympa
thizers from other parts of the
country had announced they
would join, and as many as
10,000 or more were expected
for the march.
