# Campus Reaction: Agony And Apathy
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
Reaction at Stanford last
night to the assassination of
Martin Luther King was acutely
polarized between agony and
apathy.
The University announced
plans shortly after dinner to
hold a memorial service at noon
today in Memorial Church, and
a group of students and faculty
will lead a silent vigil at White
Plaza beignning at 10:30 a.m.
After the service, this group
will sponsor a series of open
discussions on "Reflections on
White Racism".
Provost Richard Lyman, In
a personal statement called
King's murder "a vicious and
deadly blow struck at the

heart of mankind." (Lyman's
full text appears below.)
Later in the evening, LASSU
issued a resolution calling on
President Sterling to cancel
classes on Monday. Other stu
dents reacted differently.
The Black Students Union is
sued a statement condemning
White America and also called
for a boycott of classes on Mon
day by "all sympathizers and
especially black students as a
show of our disgust and our
resolve."
Other student reaction was a
good deal different.
In a freshman house, some
students cheered when they
heard of King's death and fol

lowed up with a food fight at
dinner. Fraternities held open
houses across the campus.
When asked whether his fra
ternity thought of cancelling
its program, one member at
Kappa Alpha remarked, "I've
heard of mourning, but you
don't cancel open houses for
it."
King's assassination immedi
ately brought into question the
University's plan to send 33 stu
dents to the poor people's dem
onstration in Washington.
Charles Drekmeier, professor
of political science and leader
of the project, said it was too
early to know what might hap
pen. He said the group would
phone Washington tomorrow
and would meet during the day
to discuss the situation. There
was a short meeting last night
of students involved.
Herbert Packer, vice-provost,
commented last night that he
thought the project might have
to be cancelled or a least greatly
altered to meet the new turn of
events.
Back in dorms around cam
pus, the reaction immediately
following news bulletins an
nouncing King's death began
with shock, and led to tears
and continuation of daily rou
tines depending on the indi
vidual.
At Roble, one girl reported,
"Many people didn't seem to
know at dinner. There was lots
of laughter."
One tutor at Wilbur reported
he couldn't eat dinner. He said,
"There's a cancer in our society
and I was too ill after hearing
to even eat dinner." He reported,
however, that members of the
house didn't sceem concerned
about King.
At one point, the tutor said,
he passed a freshman in the
shower who laughingly asked,
"Hey, I forgot to ask you. What
do you think about this busi
ness?"
A tour of fraternities showed
they were consistently enjoy
ing open houses. All students
in houses quickly noted they
hadn't given much thought to

cancelling their programs,
and all said it was too late to
do anything about cancellation
at 5 p.m.
One fellow at Kappa Alpha,
where drinks and music created
a lively atmosphere, said, "I'm
not concerned at all. I'm never
upset at anything, and why
should I worry? I live in Mon
tana."
A girl from Roble sitting next
to him, who was there to greet
visiting freshman, looked dis
turbed and said her roommate
"had cracked-up in tears when
she heard and many of my
friends hardly can work to
night."
Just after the news came over
the radio, one girl in Grove
House ran out of her room,
down the stairs and out into the
street with tears running down
her cheeks. Dinner discussion at
Grove was subdued as most peo
ple quietly talked about King
and possible repurcussions this
summer.
Late in the evening LASSU
issued Its resolution, which
was sponsored by Charles
Countee of the Black Students
Union. The resolution, In full,
reads:
"The Associated Students of
Stanford University condemns
and indicts American society at
large for the assassination of
Reverend Martin Luther King.
LASSU recommends to the
President of the University that
all university classes be can
celled on Monday, April 8, 1968,
in memorial to Martin Luther
King and also endorses the fly
ing of all university, State, and
Federal flags at half mast."
At the same time, LASSU
sent a telegram to Mrs. King.
It reads:
"The Associated Students of
Stanford University express our
deepest regret at the loss of your
huband. He influenced all of our
lives for the better. It is our
hope and belief that his inspira
tion will live to create a society
in which racism and poverty
will have vanished."
The full text of Richard Ly
man's statement follows:
"Martin Luther King's mur
der is a vicious and deadly
blow struck at the heart of
mankind.
"Once again we have seen
burst forth the incipient violence
that lurks beneath the surface
of modern American life. It
would be reassuring to be able
to say, 'His life, his eloquence,
his courage and his sacrifice
shall not be vain, for we will
overcome race hatred and op
pression.' But it is late, and the
debt is very large, and the time
for achieving these things —
if there is any time — is short.
It has probably been shortened
immeasurably by this senseless
and brutal act of assassination.
"In a university, as elsewhere,
eloquence and courage and self
sacrifice are valued; so, too, is
the non-violence of which Dr.

King was the greatest human
exemplar since Gandhi. We at
Stanford join a sickened and
disheartened world in mourning
his death."
During the evening the BSU
Issued the following state
ment: "Just as for 400 years
in our dealings with the bulk
of Western whites, our expec
tations for brutality and syste
matic extermination, have
again been fulfilled.
"White America has a per
verse talent for destroying those
barriers that yet exist between
it and its own certain destruc
tion. Reverend King was the last
moment in America's bid for
time; for he was the last major
voice able to convince blacks
that whites might be dealt with
'reasonably or as human be
ings."
Very late in the evening word
came in that a group of Stanford
people would sponsor a silent
march from University Avenue
in Palo Alto to Stanford up Palm
Drive. The march will begin at
4:17 p.m., the exact time King
was shot yesterday.
Last spring Dr. King came
to Stanford for an address. Me
morial Auditorium was over
flowing and King received a
tumultuous ovation at the end.
Little did he know the tragic
irony of one passage in his
speech: "We have difficulties
ahead, but I have no despair. I
still have faith in the future. I
still believe these problems can
be solved."

At the Lambda Nu House, rush
proceded merrily last night, as
this one happy brother ran at
test. Did you think of cancelling,
one member was asked. His
answer: Why?

dinner. Fraternities held open
houses across the campus.
When asked whether his fra
ternity thought of cancelling
its program, one member at
Kappa Alpha remarked, "I've
heard of mourning, but you
don't cancel open houses for
it."
King's assassination immedi
ately brought into question the
University's plan to send 33 stu
dents to the poor people's dem
onstration in Washington.
Charles Drekmeier, professor
of political science and leader
of the project, said it was too
early to know what might hap
pen. He said the group would
phone Washington tomorrow
and would meet during the day
to discuss the situation. There
was a short meeting last night
of students involved.
Herbert Packer, vice-provost,
commented last night that he
thought the project might have
to be cancelled or a least greatly
altered to meet the new turn of
events.
Back in dorms around cam
pus, the reaction immediately
following news bulletins an
nouncing King's death began
with shock, and led to tears
and continuation of daily rou
tines depending on the indi
vidual.
At Roble, one girl reported,
"Many people didn't seem to
know at dinner. There was lots
of laughter."
One tutor at Wilbur reported
he couldn't eat dinner. He said,
"There's a cancer in our society
and I was too ill after hearing
to even eat dinner." He reported,
however, that members of the
house didn't sceem concerned
about King.
At one point, the tutor said,
he passed a freshman in the
shower who laughingly asked,
"Hey, I forgot to ask you. What
do you think about this busi
ness?"
A tour of fraternities showed
they were consistently enjoy
ing open houses. All students
in houses quickly noted they
hadn't given much thought to

cancelling their programs,
and all said it was too late to
do anything about cancellation
at 5 p.m.
One fellow at Kappa Alpha,
where drinks and music created
a lively atmosphere, said, "I'm
not concerned at all. I'm never
upset at anything, and why
should I worry? I live in Mon
tana."
A girl from Roble sitting next
to him, who was there to greet
visiting freshman, looked dis
turbed and said her roommate
"had cracked-up in tears when
she heard and many of my
friends hardly can work to
night."
Just after the news came over
the radio, one girl in Grove
House ran out of her room,
down the stairs and out into the
street with tears running down
her cheeks. Dinner discussion at
Grove was subdued as most peo
ple quietly talked about King
and possible repurcussions this
summer.
Late in the evening LASSU
issued Its resolution, which
was sponsored by Charles
Countee of the Black Students
Union. The resolution, In full,
reads:
"The Associated Students of
Stanford University condemns
and indicts American society at
large for the assassination of
Reverend Martin Luther King.
LASSU recommends to the
President of the University that
all university classes be can
celled on Monday, April 8, 1968,
in memorial to Martin Luther
King and also endorses the fly
ing of all university, State, and
Federal flags at half mast."
At the same time, LASSU
sent a telegram to Mrs. King.
It reads:
"The Associated Students of
Stanford University express our
deepest regret at the loss of your
huband. He influenced all of our
lives for the better. It is our
hope and belief that his inspira
tion will live to create a society
in which racism and poverty
will have vanished."
The full text of Richard Ly
man's statement follows:
"Martin Luther King's mur
der is a vicious and deadly
blow struck at the heart of
mankind.
"Once again we have seen
burst forth the incipient violence
that lurks beneath the surface
of modern American life. It
would be reassuring to be able
to say, 'His life, his eloquence,
his courage and his sacrifice
shall not be vain, for we will
overcome race hatred and op
pression.' But it is late, and the
debt is very large, and the time
for achieving these things —
if there is any time — is short.
It has probably been shortened
immeasurably by this senseless
and brutal act of assassination.
"In a university, as elsewhere,
eloquence and courage and self
sacrifice are valued; so, too, is
the non-violence of which Dr.

King was the greatest human
exemplar since Gandhi. We at
Stanford join a sickened and
disheartened world in mourning
his death."
During the evening the BSU
Issued the following state
ment: "Just as for 400 years
in our dealings with the bulk
of Western whites, our expec
tations for brutality and syste
matic extermination, have
again been fulfilled.
"White America has a per
verse talent for destroying those
barriers that yet exist between
it and its own certain destruc
tion. Reverend King was the last
moment in America's bid for
time; for he was the last major
voice able to convince blacks
that whites might be dealt with
'reasonably or as human be
ings."
Very late in the evening word
came in that a group of Stanford
people would sponsor a silent
march from University Avenue
in Palo Alto to Stanford up Palm
Drive. The march will begin at
4:17 p.m., the exact time King
was shot yesterday.
Last spring Dr. King came
to Stanford for an address. Me
morial Auditorium was over
flowing and King received a
tumultuous ovation at the end.
Little did he know the tragic
irony of one passage in his
speech: "We have difficulties
ahead, but I have no despair. I
still have faith in the future. I
still believe these problems can
be solved."

lowed up with a food fight at
dinner. Fraternities held open
houses across the campus.
When asked whether his fra
ternity thought of cancelling
its program, one member at
Kappa Alpha remarked, "I've
heard of mourning, but you
don't cancel open houses for
it."
King's assassination immedi
ately brought into question the
University's plan to send 33 stu
dents to the poor people's dem
onstration in Washington.
Charles Drekmeier, professor
of political science and leader
of the project, said it was too
early to know what might hap
pen. He said the group would
phone Washington tomorrow
and would meet during the day
to discuss the situation. There
was a short meeting last night
of students involved.
Herbert Packer, vice-provost,
commented last night that he
thought the project might have
to be cancelled or a least greatly
altered to meet the new turn of
events.
Back in dorms around cam
pus, the reaction immediately
following news bulletins an
nouncing King's death began
with shock, and led to tears
and continuation of daily rou
tines depending on the indi
vidual.
At Roble, one girl reported,
"Many people didn't seem to
know at dinner. There was lots
of laughter."
One tutor at Wilbur reported
he couldn't eat dinner. He said,
"There's a cancer in our society
and I was too ill after hearing
to even eat dinner." He reported,
however, that members of the
house didn't sceem concerned
about King.
At one point, the tutor said,
he passed a freshman in the
shower who laughingly asked,
"Hey, I forgot to ask you. What
do you think about this busi
ness?"
A tour of fraternities showed
they were consistently enjoy
ing open houses. All students
in houses quickly noted they
hadn't given much thought to

cancelling their programs,
and all said it was too late to
do anything about cancellation
at 5 p.m.
One fellow at Kappa Alpha,
where drinks and music created
a lively atmosphere, said, "I'm
not concerned at all. I'm never
upset at anything, and why
should I worry? I live in Mon
tana."
A girl from Roble sitting next
to him, who was there to greet
visiting freshman, looked dis
turbed and said her roommate
"had cracked-up in tears when
she heard and many of my
friends hardly can work to
night."
Just after the news came over
the radio, one girl in Grove
House ran out of her room,
down the stairs and out into the
street with tears running down
her cheeks. Dinner discussion at
Grove was subdued as most peo
ple quietly talked about King
and possible repurcussions this
summer.
Late in the evening LASSU
issued Its resolution, which
was sponsored by Charles
Countee of the Black Students
Union. The resolution, In full,
reads:
"The Associated Students of
Stanford University condemns
and indicts American society at
large for the assassination of
Reverend Martin Luther King.
LASSU recommends to the
President of the University that
all university classes be can
celled on Monday, April 8, 1968,
in memorial to Martin Luther
King and also endorses the fly
ing of all university, State, and
Federal flags at half mast."
At the same time, LASSU
sent a telegram to Mrs. King.
It reads:
"The Associated Students of
Stanford University express our
deepest regret at the loss of your
huband. He influenced all of our
lives for the better. It is our
hope and belief that his inspira
tion will live to create a society
in which racism and poverty
will have vanished."
The full text of Richard Ly
man's statement follows:
"Martin Luther King's mur
der is a vicious and deadly
blow struck at the heart of
mankind.
"Once again we have seen
burst forth the incipient violence
that lurks beneath the surface
of modern American life. It
would be reassuring to be able
to say, 'His life, his eloquence,
his courage and his sacrifice
shall not be vain, for we will
overcome race hatred and op
pression.' But it is late, and the
debt is very large, and the time
for achieving these things —
if there is any time — is short.
It has probably been shortened
immeasurably by this senseless
and brutal act of assassination.
"In a university, as elsewhere,
eloquence and courage and self
sacrifice are valued; so, too, is
the non-violence of which Dr.

King was the greatest human
exemplar since Gandhi. We at
Stanford join a sickened and
disheartened world in mourning
his death."
During the evening the BSU
Issued the following state
ment: "Just as for 400 years
in our dealings with the bulk
of Western whites, our expec
tations for brutality and syste
matic extermination, have
again been fulfilled.
"White America has a per
verse talent for destroying those
barriers that yet exist between
it and its own certain destruc
tion. Reverend King was the last
moment in America's bid for
time; for he was the last major
voice able to convince blacks
that whites might be dealt with
'reasonably or as human be
ings."
Very late in the evening word
came in that a group of Stanford
people would sponsor a silent
march from University Avenue
in Palo Alto to Stanford up Palm
Drive. The march will begin at
4:17 p.m., the exact time King
was shot yesterday.
Last spring Dr. King came
to Stanford for an address. Me
morial Auditorium was over
flowing and King received a
tumultuous ovation at the end.
Little did he know the tragic
irony of one passage in his
speech: "We have difficulties
ahead, but I have no despair. I
still have faith in the future. I
still believe these problems can
be solved."

lowed up with a food fight at
dinner. Fraternities held open
houses across the campus.
When asked whether his fra
ternity thought of cancelling
its program, one member at
Kappa Alpha remarked, "I've
heard of mourning, but you
don't cancel open houses for
it."
King's assassination immedi
ately brought into question the
University's plan to send 33 stu
dents to the poor people's dem
onstration in Washington.
Charles Drekmeier, professor
of political science and leader
of the project, said it was too
early to know what might hap
pen. He said the group would
phone Washington tomorrow
and would meet during the day
to discuss the situation. There
was a short meeting last night
of students involved.
Herbert Packer, vice-provost,
commented last night that he
thought the project might have
to be cancelled or a least greatly
altered to meet the new turn of
events.
Back in dorms around cam
pus, the reaction immediately
following news bulletins an
nouncing King's death began
with shock, and led to tears
and continuation of daily rou
tines depending on the indi
vidual.
At Roble, one girl reported,
"Many people didn't seem to
know at dinner. There was lots
of laughter."
One tutor at Wilbur reported
he couldn't eat dinner. He said,
"There's a cancer in our society
and I was too ill after hearing
to even eat dinner." He reported,
however, that members of the
house didn't sceem concerned
about King.
At one point, the tutor said,
he passed a freshman in the
shower who laughingly asked,
"Hey, I forgot to ask you. What
do you think about this busi
ness?"
A tour of fraternities showed
they were consistently enjoy
ing open houses. All students
in houses quickly noted they
hadn't given much thought to

cancelling their programs,
and all said it was too late to
do anything about cancellation
at 5 p.m.
One fellow at Kappa Alpha,
where drinks and music created
a lively atmosphere, said, "I'm
not concerned at all. I'm never
upset at anything, and why
should I worry? I live in Mon
tana."
A girl from Roble sitting next
to him, who was there to greet
visiting freshman, looked dis
turbed and said her roommate
"had cracked-up in tears when
she heard and many of my
friends hardly can work to
night."
Just after the news came over
the radio, one girl in Grove
House ran out of her room,
down the stairs and out into the
street with tears running down
her cheeks. Dinner discussion at
Grove was subdued as most peo
ple quietly talked about King
and possible repurcussions this
summer.
Late in the evening LASSU
issued Its resolution, which
was sponsored by Charles
Countee of the Black Students
Union. The resolution, In full,
reads:
"The Associated Students of
Stanford University condemns
and indicts American society at
large for the assassination of
Reverend Martin Luther King.
LASSU recommends to the
President of the University that
all university classes be can
celled on Monday, April 8, 1968,
in memorial to Martin Luther
King and also endorses the fly
ing of all university, State, and
Federal flags at half mast."
At the same time, LASSU
sent a telegram to Mrs. King.
It reads:
"The Associated Students of
Stanford University express our
deepest regret at the loss of your
huband. He influenced all of our
lives for the better. It is our
hope and belief that his inspira
tion will live to create a society
in which racism and poverty
will have vanished."
The full text of Richard Ly
man's statement follows:
"Martin Luther King's mur
der is a vicious and deadly
blow struck at the heart of
mankind.
"Once again we have seen
burst forth the incipient violence
that lurks beneath the surface
of modern American life. It
would be reassuring to be able
to say, 'His life, his eloquence,
his courage and his sacrifice
shall not be vain, for we will
overcome race hatred and op
pression.' But it is late, and the
debt is very large, and the time
for achieving these things —
if there is any time — is short.
It has probably been shortened
immeasurably by this senseless
and brutal act of assassination.
"In a university, as elsewhere,
eloquence and courage and self
sacrifice are valued; so, too, is
the non-violence of which Dr.

King was the greatest human
exemplar since Gandhi. We at
Stanford join a sickened and
disheartened world in mourning
his death."
During the evening the BSU
Issued the following state
ment: "Just as for 400 years
in our dealings with the bulk
of Western whites, our expec
tations for brutality and syste
matic extermination, have
again been fulfilled.
"White America has a per
verse talent for destroying those
barriers that yet exist between
it and its own certain destruc
tion. Reverend King was the last
moment in America's bid for
time; for he was the last major
voice able to convince blacks
that whites might be dealt with
'reasonably or as human be
ings."
Very late in the evening word
came in that a group of Stanford
people would sponsor a silent
march from University Avenue
in Palo Alto to Stanford up Palm
Drive. The march will begin at
4:17 p.m., the exact time King
was shot yesterday.
Last spring Dr. King came
to Stanford for an address. Me
morial Auditorium was over
flowing and King received a
tumultuous ovation at the end.
Little did he know the tragic
irony of one passage in his
speech: "We have difficulties
ahead, but I have no despair. I
still have faith in the future. I
still believe these problems can
be solved."

HERE'S TO YOIJR HEALTH—
At the Lambda Nu House, rush
proceded merrily last night, as

test. Did you think of cancelling,
one member was asked. His
answer: Why?

OPEN HOUSE, OPEN BAR — The turnout at Alpha Delta Phi last night was 15 per cent better

too. The bar was only serving punch — unspiked — however.

Reaction at Stanford last
night to the assassination of
Martin Luther King was acutely
polarized between agony and
apathy.
The University announced
plans shortly after dinner to
hold a memorial service at noon
today in Memorial Church, and
a group of students and faculty
will lead a silent vigil at White
Plaza beignning at 10:30 a.m.
After the service, this group
will sponsor a series of open
discussions on "Reflections on
White Racism".
Provost Richard Lyman, In
a personal statement called
King's murder "a vicious and
deadly blow struck at the

heart of mankind." (Lyman's
full text appears below.)
Later in the evening, LASSU
issued a resolution calling on
President Sterling to cancel
classes on Monday. Other stu
dents reacted differently.
The Black Students Union is
sued a statement condemning
White America and also called
for a boycott of classes on Mon
day by "all sympathizers and
especially black students as a
show of our disgust and our
resolve."
Other student reaction was a
good deal different.
