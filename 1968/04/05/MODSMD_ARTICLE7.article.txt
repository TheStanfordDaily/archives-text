# Wants Student Participation
## McCarthy Talks On Politics 
### DAN SNELL 
Sen. Eugene McCarthy called
yesterday for students to partici
pate in the "new politics of
1968."
"We must back away from
having militarism be, if not the
essential, at least the primary
element of American foreign
policy," he said. "The people of
this country do not want any
longer to be the victims of this
process."
Speaking to about 13,000
students in the Greek Theater
at the University of California
at Berkeley, the Minnesota
senator said "the new poli
tics," of which his campaign

for the Presidency Is a begin
ning, may make it so "1984
may never come."
In a relaxed presentation Mc-
Carthy supported selective con
scientious objection to a specific
war. He also said that all of the
report of the President's Com
mission on Civil Disorders
should he implemented.
McCarthy also said that alter
native service should he insti
tuted for students who have left
the country to avoid the draft so
that they could return without
being criminals.
"We have exploited as a
colonial power the Negroes
living in America," McCarthy
said. "We must work to give
Negroes full participation in
and full enjoyment of life in
the United States of America."
He said that all Americans
should be seen as persons and
not as statistics to be dealt with.
In response to a question from
the floor, the candidate denied
having voted for any riot-con
trol legislation. He also said that
he had talked about civil rights
"in about one-third" of his Wis
consin campaign.
He spoke of "the new civil
rights" made necessary by mod
ern times. "These rights are the
right to a decent house, not in
a ghetto, but in a wholesome

community; the right to educa
tional opportunities; the right
to health; and the right to a job
and a decent level of income,"
McCarthy said.
The candidate explained that
to assure this last right he ad
vocated a guaranteed annual
income.
In the question-and-answer pe
riod that followed his talk, the
candidate said jokingly that
voters should support him
against Sen. Robert Kennedy
just because Kennedy was only
•12 years old.
Earlier the 52-year-old McCar
thy had jokingly called the age
of 30 to 45 "an age of uncertain
ty." McCarthy also had said,
"Too much ambition too soon is
a dangerous thing."
McCarthy asserted that there
has never been any collusion be
