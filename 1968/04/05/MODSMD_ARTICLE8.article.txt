# ASSU Convention Begins Tomorrow
## 
### THOMAS DAWSON 
The ASSU Constitutional Con
vention will hold the first of its
two sessions tomorrow. The
meeting, slated to begin at 9
a.m. in the business school audi
torium, will concern itself with
"a functional approach to gov
ernment."
Topics to be discussed include
the role of the student in uni
versity governance, the judicial
system, student finances, gradu
ate school and the ASSU and the
relation of student government
to extra-university affairs.
Denis Hayes, ASSIT vice
president. says, "We've been
talking about 'community'
fi-overnment for two years
now; this eonvention provides
us an opportunity to make
some significant strides in
that direction."
The convention is open to stu
dents, faculty and administra
tors alike. Sign-up sheets are
still posted in the ASSU office in
Tresidder Union Hayes says

(hat one of the main purposes of
the eonvention is to get "as
broad a sampling of campus
opinion as possible."
The second session of the Con
vention will be held April 27
and will concern itself with find
ing the type of political system
that will "best accomplish the
legitimate functions of the
ASSU."
Haves has been coordinating
the work on the convention, but
a presiding officer will be chosen
by the convention tomorrow.
Asked what he hoped to see
come f>tit of the eonvention
Hayes said, . . I'd like to see
a clear definition formulated
of the legitimate role of the
student body in university
governance. I'd like to see a
wide proliferation of students
in responsible positions in the
various committees of the In
stitution."
Hives suggested that a mixed
Mculty student judicial council
would be a good place to start
in forming a new form of stu
dent-university government.
At present, the student judi
cial council does have a faculty
member, at the invitation of the
council. However, the interim
judicial board, made up entirely
of faculty, serves as an appeal
board not recognized by the
ASSU.
The present legislature has a
maximum membership of 150,
but many seats are vacant or in
active. In particular, some of the
graduate schools have not sent
their full complement of repre
sentatives. Hayes suggests that
the new legislature consist of
perhaps only 30 in order to
function more effectively.

The convention was called
by the legislature in February.
It will propose a constitution
that will be voted on by the
student body. Students may
vote to accept the new consti
tution or to abolish student
government completely. Ei
ther action would require a
two-thirds vote of the student
body and the approval of the
University president.
Over 100 students have signed
up for the convention. Few non
students have signed up, but or
ganizers of the convention hope
more will in order to give the
convention a broader base.
If the convention produces a
new constitution, it would be
voted on by the student body
before the end of the academic
year.

Tresidder Union Hayes says

(hat one of the main purposes of
the eonvention is to get "as
broad a sampling of campus
opinion as possible."
The second session of the Con
vention will be held April 27
and will concern itself with find
ing the type of political system
that will "best accomplish the
legitimate functions of the
ASSU."
Haves has been coordinating
the work on the convention, but
a presiding officer will be chosen
by the convention tomorrow.
Asked what he hoped to see
come f>tit of the eonvention
Hayes said, . . I'd like to see
a clear definition formulated
of the legitimate role of the
student body in university
governance. I'd like to see a
wide proliferation of students
in responsible positions in the
various committees of the In
stitution."
Hives suggested that a mixed
Mculty student judicial council
would be a good place to start
in forming a new form of stu
dent-university government.
At present, the student judi
cial council does have a faculty
member, at the invitation of the
council. However, the interim
judicial board, made up entirely
of faculty, serves as an appeal
board not recognized by the
ASSU.
The present legislature has a
maximum membership of 150,
but many seats are vacant or in
active. In particular, some of the
graduate schools have not sent
their full complement of repre
sentatives. Hayes suggests that
the new legislature consist of
perhaps only 30 in order to
function more effectively.

The convention was called
by the legislature in February.
It will propose a constitution
that will be voted on by the
student body. Students may
vote to accept the new consti
tution or to abolish student
government completely. Ei
ther action would require a
two-thirds vote of the student
body and the approval of the
University president.
Over 100 students have signed
up for the convention. Few non
students have signed up, but or
ganizers of the convention hope
more will in order to give the
convention a broader base.
If the convention produces a
new constitution, it would be
voted on by the student body
before the end of the academic
year.
The ASSU Constitutional Con
vention will hold the first of its
two sessions tomorrow. The
meeting, slated to begin at 9
a.m. in the business school audi
torium, will concern itself with
"a functional approach to gov
ernment."
Topics to be discussed include
the role of the student in uni
versity governance, the judicial
system, student finances, gradu
ate school and the ASSU and the
relation of student government
to extra-university affairs.
