# Over 60 Parties Mark End Of Current Rush Season
## 
### MARK LITTLE 
This weekend Stanford fra
ternities will bo putting on over
60 parties and shelling out an
estimated $10,000 for bands,
booze, and accommodations.
These parties climax six
weeks of rushing by Stanford's
24 fraternities.
The typical fraternity will
have three parties this weekend:
an informal "kegger" tonight,
an afternoon pool party tomor
row, and a semi-formal party at
a country club or private home
tomorrow night.
The freshman rushee usually
first attends an open house at
the fraternity and then is in
vited back for dinner.
At the end of the winter quar
ter the fraternitv members vote
on whether to "bid" the rushee.
The "bid" is an offer of member
ship. The first bids are given out
at the rush parties this week
end.
The first rushees to receive
their bids are usually considered
"key men" to the frat, that is,
they are men who are likely to
induce other rushees to accept
the bid when it is offered to
them.
If the fraternity does not ac
cept a rushee. it is usually be
cause he has been "dinged". The
"dine" or "blob" are terms for
the "blackball". The usual policy
is "three dings and you're out."
Most fraternities do not strict -
lv follow this selection system,

however. The procedures vary
from the "one ding system" of
the Phi Delts to the "draw sys
tem" of Beta Chi. In the "draw
system" the names of all poten
tial members are drawn at ran
dom until the house quota is
filled.
Many houses are gradually
dropping the traditional ding
system. Although most of the
nationally affiliated fraternities
still officially maintain it, rush
chairmen hold that it is not
strictly observed.
Despite recent speculation that
the new coeducational dormi
tories will seriously reduce this
year's pledge classes, none of
thirteen rush chairmen polled
expect their new membership to
be any less than last year.
One rush chairman, asserted
that the "coed dorm drain phe
nomenon is a figment of the
imagination of the dorm person
ality."
Tom Wilson, rush chairman
for Lambda Nu, admits that the
pledge class could be "consider
ably less than last year. I don't
know the cause but it is not just
the coed dorm drain."
If the drain of potential mem
bers to coed dorms has had any
influence, Lambda Nu has a
unique way of combatting it
their new policy of accepting
girls as associate members and
co-residents.
Although there is a lot of talk
around the fraternities about
imitating Lambda Nu's policy of
allowing girls to move in, few
see it as an answer to the coed
dorm drain crisis. Bob Edie,
rush chairman at the ATO
house, says that "The idea of
letting girls live in fraternities
is not very realistic. You just
won't have a fraternity, then."
Greg Broughton, rush chair
man at Beta Theta Pi was more
emphatic: "We are not interest
ed in having 30 girls wandering
around here in their hair curl
ers and nightgowns with tooth
brushes hanging out of their
mouths.
None of us want girls laying
around here. And, then, there is
the subject of Stanford girls and
how our guys feel about
them. . .

The first rushees to receive
their bids are usually considered
"key men" to the frat, that is,
they are men who are likely to
induce other rushees to accept
the bid when it is offered to
them.
If the fraternity does not ac
cept a rushee. it is usually be
cause he has been "dinged". The
"dine" or "blob" are terms for
the "blackball". The usual policy
is "three dings and you're out."
Most fraternities do not strict -
lv follow this selection system,

however. The procedures vary
from the "one ding system" of
the Phi Delts to the "draw sys
tem" of Beta Chi. In the "draw
system" the names of all poten
tial members are drawn at ran
dom until the house quota is
filled.
Many houses are gradually
dropping the traditional ding
system. Although most of the
nationally affiliated fraternities
still officially maintain it, rush
chairmen hold that it is not
strictly observed.
Despite recent speculation that
the new coeducational dormi
tories will seriously reduce this
year's pledge classes, none of
thirteen rush chairmen polled
expect their new membership to
be any less than last year.
One rush chairman, asserted
that the "coed dorm drain phe
nomenon is a figment of the
imagination of the dorm person
ality."
Tom Wilson, rush chairman
for Lambda Nu, admits that the
pledge class could be "consider
ably less than last year. I don't
know the cause but it is not just
the coed dorm drain."
If the drain of potential mem
bers to coed dorms has had any
influence, Lambda Nu has a
unique way of combatting it
their new policy of accepting
girls as associate members and
co-residents.
Although there is a lot of talk
around the fraternities about
imitating Lambda Nu's policy of
allowing girls to move in, few
see it as an answer to the coed
dorm drain crisis. Bob Edie,
rush chairman at the ATO
house, says that "The idea of
letting girls live in fraternities
is not very realistic. You just
won't have a fraternity, then."
Greg Broughton, rush chair
man at Beta Theta Pi was more
emphatic: "We are not interest
ed in having 30 girls wandering
around here in their hair curl
ers and nightgowns with tooth
brushes hanging out of their
mouths.
None of us want girls laying
around here. And, then, there is
the subject of Stanford girls and
how our guys feel about
them. . .
This weekend Stanford fra
ternities will bo putting on over
60 parties and shelling out an
estimated $10,000 for bands,
booze, and accommodations.
These parties climax six
weeks of rushing by Stanford's
24 fraternities.
The typical fraternity will
have three parties this weekend:
an informal "kegger" tonight,
an afternoon pool party tomor
row, and a semi-formal party at
a country club or private home
tomorrow night.
The freshman rushee usually
first attends an open house at
the fraternity and then is in
vited back for dinner.
At the end of the winter quar
ter the fraternitv members vote
on whether to "bid" the rushee.
The "bid" is an offer of member
ship. The first bids are given out
at the rush parties this week
end.
