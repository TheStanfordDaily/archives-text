# Many Classes Cancelled
## Response To Racism' Today 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Stanford's response to the
murder of Martin Luther King
will reach a climax today with
a six-hour program of films,
speeches and debate in Memor
ial Auditorium.
Professors may cancel classes
so students can attend the "Col
loquium and Plan for Action:
Stanford's Response to White
Racism," according to a state
ment by Provost Richard Ly
man.
"Faculty should feel free not
to teach and students should
feel free not to attend classes,"
the Provost's office said earlier.
"The day is a unit," said Ken
neth Prewitt, assistant profes
sor of political science and an
organizer of the Memorial Au
ditorium program. "We urge
students and faculty to attend
the entire session. People won't
understand what's going on in
the afternoon unless they've
been there in the morning," he
said.

After films and discussions
beginning at 10 a.m. on "Un
derstanding White Racism,"
"The Culture of Violence in
American Society," and"The
Philosophy of Martin Luther
King," the colloquium will re
convene at 2 p.m. for what
Prewitt believes will be "two
very important hours in the
life of the University."
During these hours top fac
ulty, administrators and stu
dents will discuss "A Plan For
Action: How Stanford Can Act."
Provost Lyman and Professors
Prewitt, Kenneth Arrow, Robert
McAfee Brown, and David Aber
nathy will participate, along
with black students and others.
Lyman will speak on "The Uni
versity's Responsibility."
There were reports yesterday
that black students will turn
the 2 to 4 p.m. session into a
demonstration for various de
mands on the University.
Prewitt, who organized the
program along with a group of

students and faculty, expects the
"Plan for Action" to mention ad
mission of black students, em
ployment policies, University
influence on public policy, land
use policy, investment policy,
and relations with the black
community.
In a related development, a
group of 35 faculty and staff
pledged to contribute at least

10 per cent of one month's
salary to a "Dr. Martin Luther
King Scholarship Fund" to
aid black students attending
Stanford. (See their letter on
page two.)
Prof. Charles Drekmeicr said
a form will be sent all faculty
within a few days soliciting con
tributions to the Fund. Asso
ciate Dean of Undergraduate

Education Robert Hind is re
ceiving contributions. He said
he would be "delighted" it stu
dents also contributed to the
fund.
Signers of the pledge includ
ed Provost Lyman, Vice Presi
dent for Finance Kenne'h Cuth
bertson. and Dean of Students
Joel Smith.
When contacted yesterday
evening, many professors said
they would call of their class
es today. Several criticized the
University's decision to give
the faculty the choice of hold
or canceling classes.
"I think that the University
should or should not cancel
classes and not leave it to the
discretion of the individual pro
fessor," said political science
Prof. Robert Horn. He said he
would cancel his classes.
Others who would not conduct
classes included Professors
Thomas Moser, Kurt SMner,
Paul Seaver, Joseph D. Sneed,
