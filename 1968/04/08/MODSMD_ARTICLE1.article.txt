# Many Classes Cancelled
## Response To Racism' Today 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Stanford's response to the
murder of Martin Luther King
will reach a climax today with
a six-hour program of films,
speeches and debate in Memor
ial Auditorium.
Professors may cancel classes
so students can attend the "Col
loquium and Plan for Action:
Stanford's Response to White
Racism," according to a state
ment by Provost Richard Ly
man.
"Faculty should feel free not
to teach and students should
feel free not to attend classes,"
the Provost's office said earlier.
"The day is a unit," said Ken
neth Prewitt, assistant profes
sor of political science and an
organizer of the Memorial Au
ditorium program. "We urge
students and faculty to attend
the entire session. People won't
understand what's going on in
the afternoon unless they've
been there in the morning," he
said.

After films and discussions
beginning at 10 a.m. on "Un
derstanding White Racism,"
"The Culture of Violence in
American Society," and"The
Philosophy of Martin Luther
King," the colloquium will re
convene at 2 p.m. for what
Prewitt believes will be "two
very important hours in the
life of the University."
During these hours top fac
ulty, administrators and stu
dents will discuss "A Plan For
Action: How Stanford Can Act."
Provost Lyman and Professors
Prewitt, Kenneth Arrow, Robert
McAfee Brown, and David Aber
nathy will participate, along
with black students and others.
Lyman will speak on "The Uni
versity's Responsibility."
There were reports yesterday
that black students will turn
the 2 to 4 p.m. session into a
demonstration for various de
mands on the University.
Prewitt, who organized the
program along with a group of

students and faculty, expects the
"Plan for Action" to mention ad
mission of black students, em
ployment policies, University
influence on public policy, land
use policy, investment policy,
and relations with the black
community.
In a related development, a
group of 35 faculty and staff
pledged to contribute at least

10 per cent of one month's
salary to a "Dr. Martin Luther
King Scholarship Fund" to
aid black students attending
Stanford. (See their letter on
page two.)
Prof. Charles Drekmeicr said
a form will be sent all faculty
within a few days soliciting con
tributions to the Fund. Asso
ciate Dean of Undergraduate

Education Robert Hind is re
ceiving contributions. He said
he would be "delighted" it stu
dents also contributed to the
fund.
Signers of the pledge includ
ed Provost Lyman, Vice Presi
dent for Finance Kenne'h Cuth
bertson. and Dean of Students
Joel Smith.
When contacted yesterday
evening, many professors said
they would call of their class
es today. Several criticized the
University's decision to give
the faculty the choice of hold
or canceling classes.
"I think that the University
should or should not cancel
classes and not leave it to the
discretion of the individual pro
fessor," said political science
Prof. Robert Horn. He said he
would cancel his classes.
Others who would not conduct
classes included Professors
Thomas Moser, Kurt SMner,
Paul Seaver, Joseph D. Sneed,
Robert Packenham, Walter
Mischel, and Stanley Hanna. His
tory Prof. Herbert Hymans said
he would let his students decide
if his classes should be held.
But chemistry Prof. Richard
Eastman, English Prof. Kenneth
Fields and mathematics instruc
tor Robert Burdick said their
classes would go on as usual.
Lyman's statement said:
"On Monday, there will be
program from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
In Memorial Auditorium, at
which members of the Stanford
faculty and administration will
hold discussions of the problem
of racism in American society.
"Any faculty member with
a class scheduled Monday may
cancel his class. All in the Stan
ford community are invited to
attend such portions of the Me
morial Auditorium program as
may be feasible."
Lyman cannot recall another
time when the University sug
gested cancellation of classes
as part of a memorial program.
He emphasized that the Univer
sity should not "dictate to fac
ulty that under no circum
stances will they hold a class."
"A positive approach to ex
pressing sympathy and respect
is more powerful," Lyman said.
"Certainly the University has
not taken 'business as usual'
as its slogan."
Associated Students' Presi
dent Cesare Massarenti and leg
islature speaker Hichael Wein
stein also urged students to skip
their classes and attend the col
loquium. But they issued a state
ment (see page 2) "denouncing
the unwillingness of the Admin
istration to take a first step to
assume its true responsibilities
by beginning to separate itself
from the racist society it is part
of."
Massarenti and Weinstein ar
gue that "For us to pay such a
painless tribute after years of
doing nothing to help him
(King) in his cause is an insult
to the man and to all black peo
ple."

They called for an effort to
start "constructing a new na
tion out of the racLst wreckage
that is now America."
Massarenti commented that
he saw "fear" and "incapacity
of reasoning" in the Stanford re
action to King's assassination.
Prewitt said the campus
would be "flooded" with leaf
lets today announcing the Me
morial Auditorium program.
An undergraduate seminar
taught by Prewitt assembled a
mimeographed booklet over
the weekend called, "Institu
tional Racism in American So
ciety: A Primer." Copies will
be handed out at Memorial Au
ditorium today.
