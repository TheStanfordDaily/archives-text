# Letters To The Editor
## Support Civil Rights Bill 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The civil rights bill, HR 2516,
to which the Senate added open
housing provisions, can be voted
out of the House Rules Commit
tee on April 9.
The swing vote may be that
of Rep. B. F. Sisk (D„ Calif.)
For less than a dollar, you can
telegram Rep. Sisk, urging him
to report the Senate version of
the civil rights bill to the House
floor, and to oppose any at
tempts to weaken the bill.
You can also ask for support
for the bill from Rep. Charles
Guhser (10th Cong. Dist.), who
voted against the 1966 ci vi 1
rights bill because of its open
housing provisions; Rep. Don
Edwards (9th Cong. Dist.), who
will support open housing; or
Rep. Paul McCloskey (11th
Cong. Dist.), who has decided to
support this bill despite earlier
doubts about the constitutionali
ty of federal open housing laws.
The tragedy that racial strife
is bringing to this country must
be stopped. In response to Dr.
King's assassination, we must
fight harder than ever before to
end discrimination. I urge all
members of the Stanford com
munity to work for passage of
this bill, as a very small but
significant step toward justice in
this country.

King Flowers Belong
In East Palo Alto
Editor, The Daily:
Friday afternoon, some well
intentioned white persons from
Stanford assembled in Palo Alto
and marched back to the cam
pus Memorial Church in a silent
response to the death of Martin
Luther King. They bore flowers
which they left at the church
when the march was over. They
showed, by this act, that they
still did not understand the prob
lems of this country. Had they
understood, they would have
marched to East Palo Alto.
Martin Luther King was shot
not because he was simply a
man, but because he was a
black man. The Stanford march
ers should not have marched to
honor just a man (by putting
flowers at their own familiar
church) but should have
marched to honor a black man
by bringing their suburban,
mountain-grown flowers down
across the freeway to beautify
the black churches of the as
phalted ghetto. But this the
white Stanford people did not
realize; and that is one way
white racism works its subtle,
self-deceiving ways. . . .
Even the logic and traditions
of death and condolence should
have inspired the marches to
take themselves to the berreaved
the blacks of East Palo Alto.
But so deep are our racial atti
tudes and so natural are they to
us that the white Stanford
marchers could not bring them
selves to extend comfort to
blacks. . . .
King's death was one oppor
tunity to jolt whites into a
change of attitude, but, as so
often in the past, we let the op
portunity slip by. What is need
ed, surely, is for whites to ex
perience a complete turn around
which, symbolically, the Stan
ford marchers declined to do.
Bob Dylan, one of our own, said
it to us a long time ago, and
although the song became a
"hit" and we all sang the words
many times over, it seems few
people really understood the les
son for themselves: "How many
times must a man turn his head,
and protend that he just doesn't
see. . . ?"
Conscience-troubled white

Stanfordites, why did you turn
yourselves around in central
Palo Alto instead of going on to
East Palo Alto? If each of us
can find the answer in himself,
perhaps—but only just perhaps
— Martin King's death will have
taught some whites a lesson in
their own racism.

"Yeah, that's right man, burn
the white man's towns, throw a
firebomb on his houses, tear
down his businesses, and especi

down the churches that kept
you thinking of heaven while
the white man put you through

I knew where you could get a

it?"
"Hell yes!"
"Then, man I don't want to

anybody else who wants to

And, you know, as if we don't
have enough problems with one

have the inestimable bonus of
a large group of people who
walk around snickering up their

Piece Of Burned Flag
Sliotvs White Guilt
Editor, The Daily:
I am the proud owner of a
piece of an American flag burned
in White Plaza Friday afternoon
by Stanford blacks. This is the
first time I have seen the Amer
ican flag blackened. It has al
ways been red, white, and blue.
Stanford blacks are going to
change the complexion of things,
it appears, in the near future.
They can and will make changes
in our white-black, but soon
blood-red society, because they
are a united brotherhood and we
whites are not. . . .
I am proud of owning this
piece of black-scar tissue be
cause it is my own white skin
burned black and presented to
me! It is a warning of violence
from the blacks to me and you,
white readers. It is also a sym
bol of disgust, more, a blatant
ly outspoken hatred for all that
is white, all that white does,
and all that white reputedly
stands for. But for me, these
ashes are a reminder of a par
ticularly un-Christian awaken
ing I experienced yesterday at
the rally. Let me tell you of it.
During the course of the ral
ly a non-black gentleman came
up to the microphone and in
vited sympathetic white to "step
across the line" to the black side
in order to alleviate the tense
alienation. First a few, and then
many whites arose and headed
toward the black line of mourn
ers. I was among them. But a
black spokesman violently in
vited the whites to stay away.
Subsequently a series of speak
ers told the white audience that
at that moment no black could
stand to look at, to talk to, to
even be near a white.
Having returned to my hot.
detached seat on the ground, I
understood why. Mr. John
Powell made it explicit that he
had no patience with now-inter
ested but heretofore indifferent
line crossers. He announced that
he would tell me when the time
comes for me to join his side, to

finally act like I cared, as I sure
ly had not done before.
My sincere conviction of per
sonal guilt and apathy concern
ing our racial problem, and what
is to come of it in the near fu
ture, is so great, as a result of
this rally that if I can muster
one small fraction of that
strength and courage which is
standard black equipment, I will
paint every inch of my body
black and fight along with him
if he will not accept my white
skinned help.
And strangely enough, I will
benefit as much in the end as
he. Because I realize now, as of
Friday afternoon, April 5, 1968,
I can never call myself a demo
cratic, moral, Christian human
being until I can call my black
friend my brother and know
that he is.

Phil Taubman's Story
Divides The Campus
Editor, The Daily:
That Philip Taubman should
place such a premium on tears,
even to the extent that he would
polarize the campus into those
appreciative and those derisive
of Martin Luther King's efforts
on the basis of these and similar
overt demonstrations of grief,
does a disservice to Dr. King and
his work.
He might better, if not as eas
ily, have recorded more common
reactions to the assassination,
such as a growing disgust with
a country in which this tragedy
could happen, a gnawing sorrow
not so easily satisfied by weep
ing.

Don't Stereotype
People Or Races
Editor, The Daily:
I'm afraid something is wrong
when people seek to stereotype
others rather than approach
them as individual human be
ings. This is true whether you
are dealing with races of any
other collection of individuals
who can be put into a group.
Martin Luther King died be
cause of this failure to regard
others as individual persons ra
ther than treating them as a
part of a stereotype. This in it
self is tragic. Perhaps some
thing even more tragic, is the
reaction which was produced by
the death of this man.
At a time when the need for
human communication was

greatest, the response was not
to deal with people as individ
uals but rather as groups. It is
sad that someone would try to
stereotype the "Roble" reaction
to death or the "fraternity" re
action to death.
Death and mourning are emo
tional experiences which belong
only to individuals. If any thing
can be learned by Dr. King's
death, it would hopefully be that
people can only be understood as
people.

King Flowers Belong
In East Palo Alto
Editor, The Daily:
Friday afternoon, some well
intentioned white persons from
Stanford assembled in Palo Alto
and marched back to the cam
pus Memorial Church in a silent
response to the death of Martin
Luther King. They bore flowers
which they left at the church
when the march was over. They
showed, by this act, that they
still did not understand the prob
lems of this country. Had they
understood, they would have
marched to East Palo Alto.
Martin Luther King was shot
not because he was simply a
man, but because he was a
black man. The Stanford march
ers should not have marched to
honor just a man (by putting
flowers at their own familiar
church) but should have
marched to honor a black man
by bringing their suburban,
mountain-grown flowers down
across the freeway to beautify
the black churches of the as
phalted ghetto. But this the
white Stanford people did not
realize; and that is one way
white racism works its subtle,
self-deceiving ways. . . .
Even the logic and traditions
of death and condolence should
have inspired the marches to
take themselves to the berreaved
the blacks of East Palo Alto.
But so deep are our racial atti
tudes and so natural are they to
us that the white Stanford
marchers could not bring them
selves to extend comfort to
blacks. . . .
King's death was one oppor
tunity to jolt whites into a
change of attitude, but, as so
often in the past, we let the op
portunity slip by. What is need
ed, surely, is for whites to ex
perience a complete turn around
which, symbolically, the Stan
ford marchers declined to do.
Bob Dylan, one of our own, said
it to us a long time ago, and
although the song became a
"hit" and we all sang the words
many times over, it seems few
people really understood the les
son for themselves: "How many
times must a man turn his head,
and protend that he just doesn't
see. . . ?"
Conscience-troubled white

Stanfordites, why did you turn
yourselves around in central
Palo Alto instead of going on to
East Palo Alto? If each of us
can find the answer in himself,
perhaps—but only just perhaps
— Martin King's death will have
taught some whites a lesson in
their own racism.

Piece Of Burned Flag
Sliotvs White Guilt
Editor, The Daily:
I am the proud owner of a
piece of an American flag burned
in White Plaza Friday afternoon
by Stanford blacks. This is the
first time I have seen the Amer
ican flag blackened. It has al
ways been red, white, and blue.
Stanford blacks are going to
change the complexion of things,
it appears, in the near future.
They can and will make changes
in our white-black, but soon
blood-red society, because they
are a united brotherhood and we
whites are not. . . .
I am proud of owning this
piece of black-scar tissue be
cause it is my own white skin
burned black and presented to
me! It is a warning of violence
from the blacks to me and you,
white readers. It is also a sym
bol of disgust, more, a blatant
ly outspoken hatred for all that
is white, all that white does,
and all that white reputedly
stands for. But for me, these
ashes are a reminder of a par
ticularly un-Christian awaken
ing I experienced yesterday at
the rally. Let me tell you of it.
During the course of the ral
ly a non-black gentleman came
up to the microphone and in
vited sympathetic white to "step
across the line" to the black side
in order to alleviate the tense
alienation. First a few, and then
many whites arose and headed
toward the black line of mourn
ers. I was among them. But a
black spokesman violently in
vited the whites to stay away.
Subsequently a series of speak
ers told the white audience that
at that moment no black could
stand to look at, to talk to, to
even be near a white.
Having returned to my hot.
detached seat on the ground, I
understood why. Mr. John
Powell made it explicit that he
had no patience with now-inter
ested but heretofore indifferent
line crossers. He announced that
he would tell me when the time
comes for me to join his side, to

finally act like I cared, as I sure
ly had not done before.
My sincere conviction of per
sonal guilt and apathy concern
ing our racial problem, and what
is to come of it in the near fu
ture, is so great, as a result of
this rally that if I can muster
one small fraction of that
strength and courage which is
standard black equipment, I will
paint every inch of my body
black and fight along with him
if he will not accept my white
skinned help.
And strangely enough, I will
benefit as much in the end as
he. Because I realize now, as of
Friday afternoon, April 5, 1968,
I can never call myself a demo
cratic, moral, Christian human
being until I can call my black
friend my brother and know
that he is.

Phil Taubman's Story

Editor, The Daily:
That Philip Taubman should
place such a premium on tears,
even to the extent that he would
polarize the campus into those
appreciative and those derisive
of Martin Luther King's efforts
on the basis of these and similar
overt demonstrations of grief,
does a disservice to Dr. King and
his work.
He might better, if not as eas
ily, have recorded more common
reactions to the assassination,
such as a growing disgust with
a country in which this tragedy
could happen, a gnawing sorrow
not so easily satisfied by weep
ing.

Editor, The Daily:
I'm afraid something is wrong
when people seek to stereotype
others rather than approach
them as individual human be
ings. This is true whether you
are dealing with races of any
other collection of individuals
who can be put into a group.
Martin Luther King died be
cause of this failure to regard
others as individual persons ra
ther than treating them as a
part of a stereotype. This in it
self is tragic. Perhaps some
thing even more tragic, is the
reaction which was produced by
the death of this man.
At a time when the need for
human communication was

greatest, the response was not
to deal with people as individ
uals but rather as groups. It is
sad that someone would try to
stereotype the "Roble" reaction
to death or the "fraternity" re
action to death.
Death and mourning are emo
tional experiences which belong
only to individuals. If any thing
can be learned by Dr. King's
death, it would hopefully be that
people can only be understood as
people.

Editor, The Daily:
Friday afternoon, some well
intentioned white persons from
Stanford assembled in Palo Alto
and marched back to the cam
pus Memorial Church in a silent
response to the death of Martin
Luther King. They bore flowers
which they left at the church
when the march was over. They
showed, by this act, that they
still did not understand the prob
lems of this country. Had they
understood, they would have
marched to East Palo Alto.
Martin Luther King was shot
not because he was simply a
man, but because he was a
black man. The Stanford march
ers should not have marched to
honor just a man (by putting
flowers at their own familiar
church) but should have
marched to honor a black man
by bringing their suburban,
mountain-grown flowers down
across the freeway to beautify
the black churches of the as
phalted ghetto. But this the
white Stanford people did not
realize; and that is one way
white racism works its subtle,
self-deceiving ways. . . .
Even the logic and traditions
of death and condolence should
have inspired the marches to
take themselves to the berreaved
the blacks of East Palo Alto.
But so deep are our racial atti
tudes and so natural are they to
us that the white Stanford
marchers could not bring them
selves to extend comfort to
blacks. . . .
King's death was one oppor
tunity to jolt whites into a
change of attitude, but, as so
often in the past, we let the op
portunity slip by. What is need
ed, surely, is for whites to ex
perience a complete turn around
which, symbolically, the Stan
ford marchers declined to do.
Bob Dylan, one of our own, said
it to us a long time ago, and
although the song became a
"hit" and we all sang the words
many times over, it seems few
people really understood the les
son for themselves: "How many
times must a man turn his head,
and protend that he just doesn't
see. . . ?"
Conscience-troubled white

Stanfordites, why did you turn
yourselves around in central
Palo Alto instead of going on to
East Palo Alto? If each of us
can find the answer in himself,
perhaps—but only just perhaps
— Martin King's death will have
taught some whites a lesson in
their own racism.

Piece Of Burned Flag
Sliotvs White Guilt
Editor, The Daily:
I am the proud owner of a
piece of an American flag burned
in White Plaza Friday afternoon
by Stanford blacks. This is the
first time I have seen the Amer
ican flag blackened. It has al
ways been red, white, and blue.
Stanford blacks are going to
change the complexion of things,
it appears, in the near future.
They can and will make changes
in our white-black, but soon
blood-red society, because they
are a united brotherhood and we
whites are not. . . .
I am proud of owning this
piece of black-scar tissue be
cause it is my own white skin
burned black and presented to
me! It is a warning of violence
from the blacks to me and you,
white readers. It is also a sym
bol of disgust, more, a blatant
ly outspoken hatred for all that
is white, all that white does,
and all that white reputedly
stands for. But for me, these
ashes are a reminder of a par
ticularly un-Christian awaken
ing I experienced yesterday at
the rally. Let me tell you of it.
During the course of the ral
ly a non-black gentleman came
up to the microphone and in
vited sympathetic white to "step
across the line" to the black side
in order to alleviate the tense
alienation. First a few, and then
many whites arose and headed
toward the black line of mourn
ers. I was among them. But a
black spokesman violently in
vited the whites to stay away.
Subsequently a series of speak
ers told the white audience that
at that moment no black could
stand to look at, to talk to, to
even be near a white.
Having returned to my hot.
detached seat on the ground, I
understood why. Mr. John
Powell made it explicit that he
had no patience with now-inter
ested but heretofore indifferent
line crossers. He announced that
he would tell me when the time
comes for me to join his side, to

finally act like I cared, as I sure
ly had not done before.
My sincere conviction of per
sonal guilt and apathy concern
ing our racial problem, and what
is to come of it in the near fu
ture, is so great, as a result of
this rally that if I can muster
one small fraction of that
strength and courage which is
standard black equipment, I will
paint every inch of my body
black and fight along with him
if he will not accept my white
skinned help.
And strangely enough, I will
benefit as much in the end as
he. Because I realize now, as of
Friday afternoon, April 5, 1968,
I can never call myself a demo
cratic, moral, Christian human
being until I can call my black
friend my brother and know
that he is.

Phil Taubman's Story
Divides The Campus
Editor, The Daily:
That Philip Taubman should
place such a premium on tears,
even to the extent that he would
polarize the campus into those
appreciative and those derisive
of Martin Luther King's efforts
on the basis of these and similar
overt demonstrations of grief,
does a disservice to Dr. King and
his work.
He might better, if not as eas
ily, have recorded more common
reactions to the assassination,
such as a growing disgust with
a country in which this tragedy
could happen, a gnawing sorrow
not so easily satisfied by weep
ing.

Don't Stereotype
People Or Races
Editor, The Daily:
I'm afraid something is wrong
when people seek to stereotype
others rather than approach
them as individual human be
ings. This is true whether you
are dealing with races of any
other collection of individuals
who can be put into a group.
Martin Luther King died be
cause of this failure to regard
others as individual persons ra
ther than treating them as a
part of a stereotype. This in it
self is tragic. Perhaps some
thing even more tragic, is the
reaction which was produced by
the death of this man.
At a time when the need for
human communication was

greatest, the response was not
to deal with people as individ
uals but rather as groups. It is
sad that someone would try to
stereotype the "Roble" reaction
to death or the "fraternity" re
action to death.
Death and mourning are emo
tional experiences which belong
only to individuals. If any thing
can be learned by Dr. King's
death, it would hopefully be that
people can only be understood as
people.

I would suggest we fly the

Conscience-troubled white

Stanfordites, why did you turn
yourselves around in central
Palo Alto instead of going on to
East Palo Alto? If each of us
can find the answer in himself,
perhaps—but only just perhaps
— Martin King's death will have
taught some whites a lesson in
their own racism.

Piece Of Burned Flag
Sliotvs White Guilt
Editor, The Daily:
I am the proud owner of a
piece of an American flag burned
in White Plaza Friday afternoon
by Stanford blacks. This is the
first time I have seen the Amer
ican flag blackened. It has al
ways been red, white, and blue.
Stanford blacks are going to
change the complexion of things,
it appears, in the near future.
They can and will make changes
in our white-black, but soon
blood-red society, because they
are a united brotherhood and we
whites are not. . . .
I am proud of owning this
piece of black-scar tissue be
cause it is my own white skin
burned black and presented to
me! It is a warning of violence
from the blacks to me and you,
white readers. It is also a sym
bol of disgust, more, a blatant
ly outspoken hatred for all that
is white, all that white does,
and all that white reputedly
stands for. But for me, these
ashes are a reminder of a par
ticularly un-Christian awaken
ing I experienced yesterday at
the rally. Let me tell you of it.
During the course of the ral
ly a non-black gentleman came
up to the microphone and in
vited sympathetic white to "step
across the line" to the black side
in order to alleviate the tense
alienation. First a few, and then
many whites arose and headed
toward the black line of mourn
ers. I was among them. But a
black spokesman violently in
vited the whites to stay away.
Subsequently a series of speak
ers told the white audience that
at that moment no black could
stand to look at, to talk to, to
even be near a white.
Having returned to my hot.
detached seat on the ground, I
understood why. Mr. John
Powell made it explicit that he
had no patience with now-inter
ested but heretofore indifferent
line crossers. He announced that
he would tell me when the time
comes for me to join his side, to

finally act like I cared, as I sure
ly had not done before.
My sincere conviction of per
sonal guilt and apathy concern
ing our racial problem, and what
is to come of it in the near fu
ture, is so great, as a result of
this rally that if I can muster
one small fraction of that
strength and courage which is
standard black equipment, I will
paint every inch of my body
black and fight along with him
if he will not accept my white
skinned help.
And strangely enough, I will
benefit as much in the end as
he. Because I realize now, as of
Friday afternoon, April 5, 1968,
I can never call myself a demo
cratic, moral, Christian human
being until I can call my black
friend my brother and know
that he is.

Phil Taubman's Story

Editor, The Daily:
That Philip Taubman should
place such a premium on tears,
even to the extent that he would
polarize the campus into those
appreciative and those derisive
of Martin Luther King's efforts
on the basis of these and similar
overt demonstrations of grief,
does a disservice to Dr. King and
his work.
He might better, if not as eas

reactions to the assassination,
such as a growing disgust with
a country in which this tragedy
could happen, a gnawing sorrow
not so easily satisfied by weep

Editor, The Daily:
I'm afraid something is wrong
when people seek to stereotype
others rather than approach
them as individual human be
ings. This is true whether you
are dealing with races of any
other collection of individuals
who can be put into a group.
Martin Luther King died be
cause of this failure to regard
others as individual persons ra
ther than treating them as a
part of a stereotype. This in it
self is tragic. Perhaps some
thing even more tragic, is the
reaction which was produced by
the death of this man.
At a time when the need for
human communication was

greatest, the response was not
to deal with people as individ
uals but rather as groups. It is
sad that someone would try to
stereotype the "Roble" reaction
to death or the "fraternity" re
action to death.
Death and mourning are emo
tional experiences which belong
only to individuals. If any thing
can be learned by Dr. King's
death, it would hopefully be that
people can only be understood as
people.

In East Palo Alto
Editor, The Daily:
Friday afternoon, some well
intentioned white persons from
Stanford assembled in Palo Alto
and marched back to the cam
pus Memorial Church in a silent
response to the death of Martin
Luther King. They bore flowers
which they left at the church
when the march was over. They
showed, by this act, that they
still did not understand the prob
lems of this country. Had they
understood, they would have
marched to East Palo Alto.
Martin Luther King was shot
not because he was simply a
man, but because he was a
black man. The Stanford march
ers should not have marched to
honor just a man (by putting
flowers at their own familiar
church) but should have
marched to honor a black man
by bringing their suburban,
mountain-grown flowers down
across the freeway to beautify
the black churches of the as
phalted ghetto. But this the
white Stanford people did not

Conscience-troubled white

Stanfordites, why did you turn
yourselves around in central
Palo Alto instead of going on to
East Palo Alto? If each of us
can find the answer in himself,
perhaps—but only just perhaps
— Martin King's death will have
taught some whites a lesson in
their own racism.

Piece Of Burned Flag
Sliotvs White Guilt
Editor, The Daily:
I am the proud owner of a
piece of an American flag burned
in White Plaza Friday afternoon
by Stanford blacks. This is the
first time I have seen the Amer
ican flag blackened. It has al
ways been red, white, and blue.
Stanford blacks are going to
change the complexion of things,
it appears, in the near future.
They can and will make changes
in our white-black, but soon
blood-red society, because they
are a united brotherhood and we
whites are not. . . .
I am proud of owning this
piece of black-scar tissue be
cause it is my own white skin
burned black and presented to
me! It is a warning of violence
from the blacks to me and you,
white readers. It is also a sym
bol of disgust, more, a blatant
ly outspoken hatred for all that
is white, all that white does,
and all that white reputedly
stands for. But for me, these
ashes are a reminder of a par
ticularly un-Christian awaken
ing I experienced yesterday at
the rally. Let me tell you of it.
During the course of the ral
ly a non-black gentleman came
up to the microphone and in
vited sympathetic white to "step
across the line" to the black side
in order to alleviate the tense
alienation. First a few, and then
many whites arose and headed
toward the black line of mourn
ers. I was among them. But a
black spokesman violently in
vited the whites to stay away.
Subsequently a series of speak
ers told the white audience that
at that moment no black could
stand to look at, to talk to, to
even be near a white.
Having returned to my hot.
detached seat on the ground, I
understood why. Mr. John
Powell made it explicit that he
had no patience with now-inter
ested but heretofore indifferent
line crossers. He announced that
he would tell me when the time
comes for me to join his side, to

finally act like I cared, as I sure
ly had not done before.
My sincere conviction of per
sonal guilt and apathy concern
ing our racial problem, and what
is to come of it in the near fu
ture, is so great, as a result of
this rally that if I can muster
one small fraction of that
strength and courage which is
standard black equipment, I will
paint every inch of my body
black and fight along with him
if he will not accept my white
skinned help.
And strangely enough, I will
benefit as much in the end as
he. Because I realize now, as of
Friday afternoon, April 5, 1968,
I can never call myself a demo
cratic, moral, Christian human
being until I can call my black
friend my brother and know
that he is.

Phil Taubman's Story
Divides The Campus
Editor, The Daily:
That Philip Taubman should
place such a premium on tears,
even to the extent that he would
polarize the campus into those
appreciative and those derisive
of Martin Luther King's efforts
on the basis of these and similar
overt demonstrations of grief,
does a disservice to Dr. King and
his work.
He might better, if not as eas
ily, have recorded more common
reactions to the assassination,
such as a growing disgust with
a country in which this tragedy
could happen, a gnawing sorrow
not so easily satisfied by weep
ing.

Don't Stereotype
People Or Races
Editor, The Daily:
I'm afraid something is wrong
when people seek to stereotype
others rather than approach
them as individual human be
ings. This is true whether you
are dealing with races of any
other collection of individuals
who can be put into a group.
Martin Luther King died be
cause of this failure to regard
others as individual persons ra
ther than treating them as a
part of a stereotype. This in it
self is tragic. Perhaps some
thing even more tragic, is the
reaction which was produced by
the death of this man.
At a time when the need for
human communication was

greatest, the response was not
to deal with people as individ
uals but rather as groups. It is
sad that someone would try to
stereotype the "Roble" reaction
to death or the "fraternity" re
action to death.
Death and mourning are emo
tional experiences which belong
only to individuals. If any thing
can be learned by Dr. King's
death, it would hopefully be that
people can only be understood as
people.

The civil rights bill, HR 2516,
to which the Senate added open
housing provisions, can be voted
out of the House Rules Commit
tee on April 9.
The swing vote may be that
of Rep. B. F. Sisk (D„ Calif.)
For less than a dollar, you can
telegram Rep. Sisk, urging him
to report the Senate version of
the civil rights bill to the House
floor, and to oppose any at
tempts to weaken the bill.
You can also ask for support
for the bill from Rep. Charles
Guhser (10th Cong. Dist.), who
voted against the 1966 ci vi 1
rights bill because of its open
housing provisions; Rep. Don
Edwards (9th Cong. Dist.), who
will support open housing; or
Rep. Paul McCloskey (11th
Cong. Dist.), who has decided to
support this bill despite earlier
doubts about the constitutionali
ty of federal open housing laws.
The tragedy that racial strife
is bringing to this country must
be stopped. In response to Dr.
King's assassination, we must
fight harder than ever before to
end discrimination. I urge all
members of the Stanford com
munity to work for passage of
this bill, as a very small but
significant step toward justice in

King Flowers Belong
In East Palo Alto
Editor, The Daily:
Friday afternoon, some well
intentioned white persons from
Stanford assembled in Palo Alto
and marched back to the cam
pus Memorial Church in a silent
response to the death of Martin
Luther King. They bore flowers
which they left at the church
when the march was over. They
showed, by this act, that they
still did not understand the prob
lems of this country. Had they
understood, they would have
marched to East Palo Alto.
Martin Luther King was shot
not because he was simply a
man, but because he was a
black man. The Stanford march
ers should not have marched to
honor just a man (by putting
flowers at their own familiar
church) but should have
marched to honor a black man
by bringing their suburban,
mountain-grown flowers down
across the freeway to beautify
the black churches of the as
phalted ghetto. But this the
white Stanford people did not
realize; and that is one way
white racism works its subtle,
self-deceiving ways. . . .
Even the logic and traditions
of death and condolence should
have inspired the marches to
take themselves to the berreaved
the blacks of East Palo Alto.
But so deep are our racial atti
tudes and so natural are they to
us that the white Stanford
marchers could not bring them
selves to extend comfort to
blacks. . . .
King's death was one oppor
tunity to jolt whites into a
change of attitude, but, as so
often in the past, we let the op
portunity slip by. What is need
ed, surely, is for whites to ex
