# My Typewriter Is Bugged
## Outburst At Standard U. 
### Michael Sweeney 
(Testimony from the Invest!-
action by a California Senate
Committee of the recent dis
orders at Standard University.)
Ernest Lynch (committee
counsel): Mr. Chairman, our
first witness is Dr. Joseph
Shrink of the Human Institute
of Problems at Standard. As an
expert in mass psychology, Dr.
Shrink, how do you account for
these unusual events?
Shrink: Cumulative realiza
tion of negative potential for

environmental change.
Senator Abraham Lincoln
Hayseed (Chairman): Eh?
Lynch: Could you translate
that, Dr. Shrink?
Shrink: Frustration. On the
television screens the students
saw the world falling to pieces.
War, murder, riots. But none of
the catastrophes actually came
to the Standard campus, which
is located in a remote suburb
behind 431 large trees. So the
events just worked on the stu

dents' imaginations, and natur
ally became much worse in
fantasy than in fact.
Senator Wllmer Bland: Which
catastrophes do you mean?
Shrink: There was the Viet
nam war, naturally. For five
years students had been trying
to do something about it, but
it only got bigger. Then Martin
Luther King was shot, and
everybody at Standard was fran
tic to apologize to black people
for their white guilt. But when
all 73 Negroes at Standard an
nounced they could no longer
bear the indignity of associat
ing with whites, and marched
away to Oakland, there was no
body left to apologize to. This
incredible blow came just be
fore the Daze of Concern pro
gram, and the campus frustra
tion index rose four points.
Bland: Didn't the students let
out some of this frustration by
working for Presidential candi
dates?
Shrink: Well, at first. But
then Johnson said he wouldn't
run so the students couldn't
vent their frustrations by hat
ing him. And Senator McCarthy
threw his support to Kennedy
and became curator of the JFK
library. And Kennedy became
Secretary of State. At Standard
the frustration index rose three
points and the cynicism index
rose 12.
Hayseed: What about the oth
er candidates?
Lynch (aside to Shrink): Hay
seed is from Orange County.
Shrink: I don't think anyone
considered Nixon. . .
(Silence.)
. . . Governor Wallace didn't
campaign actively at Standard.
Hayseed: Oh . . . too bad.
Well,, Dr. Shrink, all this frus
tration is very inten sting, but
we want to know how come
Standard University burned to
the ground in April, 1968.
Shrink: Senator, evidently you
don't appreciate the impact of
non-identifiable barriers on the
norm youth personality of the
upper -middle socio-economic
strata.
Hayseed: Eh?
Shrink: I mean these kids
couldn't cope with protracted
frustration. All their lives they
had things just by asking. It
was spiritual sickness, with no
cure. Then the Daze of Con
cern rally got them all together,
and you had mass psychological
breakdown.

Lynch: Our investigators say
that a crowd of 5,000 formed on
White Memorial Plaza and re
named it Black Memorial Plaza.
Then they lit a gigantic bonfire
of draft cards, student body
cards, dollar bills, books, six
American flags and three police
men.
Shrink: Yes ... it was the
symbolic destruction of self,
denial of identity ... as when
a mental patient attempts sui
cide. Your report tells about
the ashes?
Lynch: Yes. Many white stu
dents were observed taking
ashes from the fire and smear
ing their faces black.
Bland: The newspapers said
some inflammatory remark
started the actual riot.
Lynch: It was"Burn, baby,
burn."
Hayseed: Who said it?
Shrink: I did. I was joking.
I thought a little droll humor
would sooth them.
Lynch: The fires spread
around the University. When
the buildings collapsed, their
red tile roofs were pulverized,
throwing up clouds of a fine
red dust. Our criminal labora
tory has discovered the dust
contained large amounts of the
powerful hallucinate ZAP.
Clouds of red dust engulfed the
campus. A Standard official
testified that he warned the stu
dents that it was aaginst the
Universiy Drug Policy to
breathe, but apparently his
warning went unheeded.
Shrink: It was the largest
trip in history. As I watched
all this, wearing a gas mask of
course, the cynicism index drop
ped to zero. But the frustration
index stayed high. Then Harass
appeared in his orange XK-E.
Lynch: Our report says for
mer student body president
David Harass suddenly appear
ed in the mob with his folk
singer wife, singing Negro spir
ituals.
Shrink: The effect was elec
tric. Here was a fabled leader
returned to help them conquer
all their frustrations at once —
the war, white guilt, their par
ents. . .
Lynch: According to the eye
witnesses, Harass shouted, "We
are all Black Freedom Fighters
and are going to liberate the
Vietnamese People." The mob
was last seen marching into the
Pacific Ocean.

Hayseed (Chairman): Eh?
Lynch: Could you translate
that, Dr. Shrink?
Shrink: Frustration. On the
television screens the students
saw the world falling to pieces.
War, murder, riots. But none of
the catastrophes actually came
to the Standard campus, which
is located in a remote suburb
behind 431 large trees. So the
events just worked on the stu

dents' imaginations, and natur
ally became much worse in
fantasy than in fact.
Senator Wllmer Bland: Which
catastrophes do you mean?
Shrink: There was the Viet
nam war, naturally. For five
years students had been trying
to do something about it, but
it only got bigger. Then Martin
Luther King was shot, and
everybody at Standard was fran
tic to apologize to black people
for their white guilt. But when
all 73 Negroes at Standard an
nounced they could no longer
bear the indignity of associat
ing with whites, and marched
away to Oakland, there was no
body left to apologize to. This
incredible blow came just be
fore the Daze of Concern pro
gram, and the campus frustra
tion index rose four points.
Bland: Didn't the students let
out some of this frustration by
working for Presidential candi
dates?
Shrink: Well, at first. But
then Johnson said he wouldn't
run so the students couldn't
vent their frustrations by hat
ing him. And Senator McCarthy
threw his support to Kennedy
and became curator of the JFK
library. And Kennedy became
Secretary of State. At Standard
the frustration index rose three
points and the cynicism index
rose 12.
Hayseed: What about the oth
er candidates?
Lynch (aside to Shrink): Hay
seed is from Orange County.
Shrink: I don't think anyone
considered Nixon. . .
(Silence.)
. . . Governor Wallace didn't
campaign actively at Standard.
Hayseed: Oh . . . too bad.
Well,, Dr. Shrink, all this frus
tration is very inten sting, but
we want to know how come
Standard University burned to
the ground in April, 1968.
Shrink: Senator, evidently you
don't appreciate the impact of
non-identifiable barriers on the
norm youth personality of the
upper -middle socio-economic
strata.
Hayseed: Eh?
Shrink: I mean these kids
couldn't cope with protracted
frustration. All their lives they
had things just by asking. It
was spiritual sickness, with no
cure. Then the Daze of Con
cern rally got them all together,
and you had mass psychological
breakdown.

Lynch: Our investigators say
that a crowd of 5,000 formed on
White Memorial Plaza and re
named it Black Memorial Plaza.
Then they lit a gigantic bonfire
of draft cards, student body
cards, dollar bills, books, six
American flags and three police
men.
Shrink: Yes ... it was the
symbolic destruction of self,
denial of identity ... as when
a mental patient attempts sui
cide. Your report tells about
the ashes?
Lynch: Yes. Many white stu
dents were observed taking
ashes from the fire and smear
ing their faces black.
Bland: The newspapers said
some inflammatory remark
started the actual riot.
Lynch: It was"Burn, baby,
burn."
Hayseed: Who said it?
Shrink: I did. I was joking.
I thought a little droll humor
would sooth them.
Lynch: The fires spread
around the University. When
the buildings collapsed, their
red tile roofs were pulverized,
throwing up clouds of a fine
red dust. Our criminal labora
tory has discovered the dust
contained large amounts of the
powerful hallucinate ZAP.
Clouds of red dust engulfed the
campus. A Standard official
testified that he warned the stu
dents that it was aaginst the
Universiy Drug Policy to
breathe, but apparently his
warning went unheeded.
Shrink: It was the largest
trip in history. As I watched
all this, wearing a gas mask of
course, the cynicism index drop
ped to zero. But the frustration
index stayed high. Then Harass
appeared in his orange XK-E.
Lynch: Our report says for
mer student body president
David Harass suddenly appear
ed in the mob with his folk
singer wife, singing Negro spir
ituals.
Shrink: The effect was elec
tric. Here was a fabled leader
returned to help them conquer
all their frustrations at once —
the war, white guilt, their par
ents. . .
Lynch: According to the eye
witnesses, Harass shouted, "We
are all Black Freedom Fighters
and are going to liberate the
Vietnamese People." The mob
was last seen marching into the
Pacific Ocean.
(Testimony from the Invest!-
action by a California Senate
Committee of the recent dis
orders at Standard University.)
Ernest Lynch (committee
counsel): Mr. Chairman, our
first witness is Dr. Joseph
Shrink of the Human Institute
of Problems at Standard. As an
expert in mass psychology, Dr.
Shrink, how do you account for
these unusual events?
Shrink: Cumulative realiza
tion of negative potential for

environmental change.

catastrophes do you mean?
Shrink: There was the Viet
nam war, naturally. For five
years students had been trying
to do something about it, but
it only got bigger. Then Martin
Luther King was shot, and
everybody at Standard was fran
tic to apologize to black people
for their white guilt. But when
all 73 Negroes at Standard an
nounced they could no longer
bear the indignity of associat
ing with whites, and marched
away to Oakland, there was no
body left to apologize to. This
incredible blow came just be
fore the Daze of Concern pro
gram, and the campus frustra
tion index rose four points.
Bland: Didn't the students let
out some of this frustration by
working for Presidential candi
dates?
Shrink: Well, at first. But
then Johnson said he wouldn't
run so the students couldn't
vent their frustrations by hat
ing him. And Senator McCarthy
threw his support to Kennedy
and became curator of the JFK
library. And Kennedy became
Secretary of State. At Standard
the frustration index rose three
points and the cynicism index
rose 12.
Hayseed: What about the oth
er candidates?
Lynch (aside to Shrink): Hay
seed is from Orange County.
Shrink: I don't think anyone
considered Nixon. . .
(Silence.)
. . . Governor Wallace didn't
campaign actively at Standard.
Hayseed: Oh . . . too bad.
Well,, Dr. Shrink, all this frus
tration is very inten sting, but
we want to know how come
Standard University burned to
the ground in April, 1968.
Shrink: Senator, evidently you
don't appreciate the impact of
non-identifiable barriers on the
norm youth personality of the
upper -middle socio-economic
strata.
Hayseed: Eh?
Shrink: I mean these kids
couldn't cope with protracted
frustration. All their lives they
had things just by asking. It
was spiritual sickness, with no
cure. Then the Daze of Con
cern rally got them all together,
and you had mass psychological
breakdown.

Lynch: Our investigators say
that a crowd of 5,000 formed on
White Memorial Plaza and re
named it Black Memorial Plaza.
Then they lit a gigantic bonfire
of draft cards, student body
cards, dollar bills, books, six
American flags and three police
men.
Shrink: Yes ... it was the
symbolic destruction of self,
denial of identity ... as when
a mental patient attempts sui
cide. Your report tells about
the ashes?
Lynch: Yes. Many white stu
dents were observed taking
ashes from the fire and smear
ing their faces black.
Bland: The newspapers said
some inflammatory remark
started the actual riot.
Lynch: It was"Burn, baby,
burn."
Hayseed: Who said it?
Shrink: I did. I was joking.
I thought a little droll humor
would sooth them.
Lynch: The fires spread
around the University. When
the buildings collapsed, their
red tile roofs were pulverized,
throwing up clouds of a fine
red dust. Our criminal labora
tory has discovered the dust
contained large amounts of the
powerful hallucinate ZAP.
Clouds of red dust engulfed the
campus. A Standard official
testified that he warned the stu
dents that it was aaginst the
Universiy Drug Policy to
breathe, but apparently his
warning went unheeded.
Shrink: It was the largest
trip in history. As I watched
all this, wearing a gas mask of
course, the cynicism index drop
ped to zero. But the frustration
index stayed high. Then Harass
appeared in his orange XK-E.
Lynch: Our report says for
mer student body president
David Harass suddenly appear
ed in the mob with his folk
singer wife, singing Negro spir
ituals.
Shrink: The effect was elec
tric. Here was a fabled leader
returned to help them conquer
all their frustrations at once —
the war, white guilt, their par
ents. . .
Lynch: According to the eye
witnesses, Harass shouted, "We
are all Black Freedom Fighters
and are going to liberate the
Vietnamese People." The mob
was last seen marching into the
Pacific Ocean.
(Testimony from the Invest!-
action by a California Senate
Committee of the recent dis
orders at Standard University.)
Ernest Lynch (committee
counsel): Mr. Chairman, our
first witness is Dr. Joseph
Shrink of the Human Institute
of Problems at Standard. As an
expert in mass psychology, Dr.
Shrink, how do you account for
these unusual events?
Shrink: Cumulative realiza
tion of negative potential for

environmental change.
Senator Abraham Lincoln
Hayseed (Chairman): Eh?
Lynch: Could you translate
that, Dr. Shrink?
Shrink: Frustration. On the
television screens the students
saw the world falling to pieces.
War, murder, riots. But none of
the catastrophes actually came
to the Standard campus, which
is located in a remote suburb
behind 431 large trees. So the
events just worked on the stu

dents' imaginations, and natur
ally became much worse in
fantasy than in fact.
