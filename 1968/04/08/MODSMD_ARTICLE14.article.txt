## Profs Pledge Black Aid

Editor, The Dally:
The assassination of Martin
Luther King is the occasion for
rededicating ourselves to build
ing the kind of society he envi
sioned. As educators and as men,
we are called upon to act reso
lutely to create the conditions
that will enable is to live by and
teach those values espoused by
Dr. King. Accordingly, and only
as a first step, we pledge 10 per
cent of our salaries for at least
a month toward the establish
ment of a Dr. Martin Luther
King Scholarship Fund for
black students.

We ask our colleagues to join
us in this endeavor and we urge
the University to match our
contributions. Contributions may
be sent to the Dr. Martin Luther
King Memorial Scholarship
Fund, c/o Robert Hind, Rm 108,
Bldg 10A.
We also pledge affirmative ac
tion to eliminate any racial dis
advantages that exist on our
campus. Furthermore, we ask
students, faculty, and adminis
trators to attend today's collo
quium at Memorial Auditorium
where these and many other
forms of action will be propos

ed. If the Stanford community
does not act decisively, it can
not expect others to do so. If
we do not use this moment as
a beginning .there may be no
beginning.
