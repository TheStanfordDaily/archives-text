### 
April 7, 1968
To the community:
As resolved by the legislature,
we repeatedly asked the Presi
dent and Provost of the Uni
versity to cancel all classes to
day. The administration refused
to take this step and instead
has endorsed a program of de
bates and talks today from 10
a.m. to 4 p.m. in Memorial Aud
itorium.
Wo want to denounce the un
willingness of the Administra
tion to take a first step to as
sume its true resopnsibilities by
beginning to separate itself
from the racist society it is part
of. But since this program is
the most the University seems
capable of supporting, we urge
students and faculty not to go
to classes but to attend the pro
gram in Memorial Auditorium.
We want, however, to stress
that those who will take part in
this function today should not
go only to mourn Dr. King.
For us to pay such a painless
tribute after years of doing

nothing to help him in his cause
is an insult to the man and to
all black people. It may be good
for guilty white consciences but
by itself accomplishes nothing.
And we should never forget
that ho was one among many,
many others who have died in
this country for the very some
reasons.i
One day of discussions is
worthless if it is not meant to
be the beginning of a profound
ly important and extremely dif
ficult undertaking: that of con
structing a new nation out of
the racist wreckage that is now
America.
