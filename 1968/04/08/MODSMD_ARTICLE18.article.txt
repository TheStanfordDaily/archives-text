# Peace Corps Stays A Draft Alternative
## 
### 
Until recently, the Peace
Corps has been an effective al
ternative to the draft, or at least
a way to put it off for two years.
The question foremost in the
minds of many prospective Vol
unteers this spring has been
whether this will continue to be
the case.
The returns are not all in, but
so far most of those seeking de
ferments for Peace Corps Ser
vice have received them.
Until early this year, the situ
ation was clear-cut. The Peace
Corps' policy was outlined by
Director Jack Vaughn in a
speech at Utah State University
in December, 1966.
Vaughn said that Peace Corps'
service is the most valuable con
tribution that an American can
make to his nation and his fel
low man. "Draft boards through
out the nation have agreed
overwhelmingly, c 1 a s si 112 y ing
Peace Corps as service in the
national interest and deferring
Volunteers until they have com
pleted service overseas," he said.
General Lewis B. Hershey
cast some doubt on this situa
tion in February when he elimi
nated national interest defer
ments.
Under the present system the
Peace Corps sends cover letters
to the draft board of each male
applicant and advises Volunteers
who seek deferments.
Vaughn has indicated that he
will do everything in his power
to keep Volunteers from being
drafted, including taking each
case to the Presidential Appeal
Board.
Judging by the fact that less
than one per cent of all Peace

Corps Volunteers and trainees
have been drafted, it appears
that Vaughn's efforts to protect
his organization from the draft
have been successful.
Questions about the draft and
other aspects of Peace Corps
service will be answered by re
turned Volunteers and recruiters
in White Plaza today through
Friday as part of Peace Corps
Week at Stanford.
The Peace Corps also main
tains an office in the Volunteer
Service Center on the third floor
of the Clubhouse. It is staffed
by San Francisco based recruit
er Alan Corner on Mondays and
Tuesdays.
