# Stern Survey Results
## Two-Fifths Have Used Pot 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
More than 40 per cent of the
men and 65 per cent of the wom
en in Stern Hall have used mari
juana, according to a survey
taken by four Serra House resi
dents.
But the results of the poll,
taken last quarter for a house
seminar on "Drugs and the Com
munity," are being questioned
by the people who ran it.
"I think a good percentage
weren't truthful," Dave Koch
said. '1 know it (the amount
of marijuana use) Is much
higher."
The other three students in
volved with the survey are Don
Fisichella, Steve McAfTee, and
Earl Shelton.
Although half of the Stern
residents returned the question
naires, a sample which Koch
feels is large enough to give ac
curate results, he feels that resi
dents of houses where use of
marijuana is high did not re
spond honestly, fearing a pot
bust.
"What would you do if you
were a narco and saw a story
which reported 80 per cent pot
use in one house?" he said. "The
people here don't want another
Stony Brook."
Besides surveying use of
}narij uana, the poll asked
questions about use of alcohol
Und LSD, as well as attitudes
towards all three substances.
' Thirty-seven of the 65 women
in Stern returned answers, while
248 out of 509 men responded.
The results of the survey, al
though questioned as low by its
sponsors, show a percentage of
users twice that reported by
Ftichard Blum of Stanford's In
stitute for the Study of Human
Problems.
- His poll, taken last spring,
showed that one in five students
here had smoked marijuana.
Other results of the Stern
survey agTee with Blum's,
however. Both show, for ex
ample, that about six per cent
of the students have ever used
LSD.
. Of the marijuana users, the
overwhelming majority smoked
it either "very seldom" or "oc
casionally," the survey showed.

Three-fourths of the men and 95
per cent of the women smokers
picked either of these two
choices.
Only 25 per cent of the men
and five per cent of the women
said they smoked marijuana reg
ularly. None said they used it
"very frequently."
Among men, the use by class
was fairly even, ranging from
48 per cent for the juniors to
36 per cent for sophomores.
There was a wide spread
among women, however. Here,
the percentages varied from
89 p«'r cent for sophomores to
38 per cent for senior women.
The poll also asked how many
users had ever sold marijuana.
Four per cent of the women—
all freshmen —and one-fifth of
the men said they had.
Of the women, 85 per cent of
those who have not smoked
marijuana said they have had
the opportunity to do so. Two
fifths of the non-users said they
would like to try it.
The percentages in these areas
were smaller for the men. Only
56 per cent of the non-users said
they had the chance to smoke
marijuana, and less than one
fourth of them would now like
to try.
Use of LSD, the survey
showed, was greater one year
ago than it is now, the ratio
being approximately two to
one.
Attitudes of users and non

users of marijuana to alcohol,
LSD, and marijuana were also
compared. In all cases, the atti
tudes of the marijuana users
was more liberal than those of
non-users. The difference was
more pronounced among men
than women, however.
For the men, only ten per cent
of marijuana users thought
that pot was either "bad" or
"somewhat bad," while of the
non-users 54 per cent picked one
of these choices.
Similarly, 17 per cent of the
users thought alcohol was either
bad or somewhat bad, with 27
per cent of the non-users agree
ing with them. For LSD, the
percentages were 75 for users
and 88 for non-users.
The divergence was fairly uni
form in each class.
With the women, 13 per
cent of the users thought
marijuana had a detrimental
effect, while almost a third of
the non-users thought so.
Three-fourths of the women
who had smoked pot thought
LSD was bad, while 92 per cent
of the non-users picked either
had or somewhat bad.
The other choices were nei
ther good nor bad, somewhat
good, or good.
The study also showed a defi
nite indication that marijuana
users drank alcoholic beverages
more often and more frequently
than non users. This was true
for both men and women.

the men said they had.
Of the women, 85 per cent of
those who have not smoked
marijuana said they have had
the opportunity to do so. Two
fifths of the non-users said they
would like to try it.
The percentages in these areas
were smaller for the men. Only
56 per cent of the non-users said
they had the chance to smoke
marijuana, and less than one
fourth of them would now like
to try.
Use of LSD, the survey
showed, was greater one year
ago than it is now, the ratio
being approximately two to
one.
Attitudes of users and non

users of marijuana to alcohol,
LSD, and marijuana were also
compared. In all cases, the atti
tudes of the marijuana users
was more liberal than those of
non-users. The difference was
more pronounced among men
than women, however.
For the men, only ten per cent
of marijuana users thought
that pot was either "bad" or
"somewhat bad," while of the
non-users 54 per cent picked one
of these choices.
Similarly, 17 per cent of the
users thought alcohol was either
bad or somewhat bad, with 27
per cent of the non-users agree
ing with them. For LSD, the
percentages were 75 for users
and 88 for non-users.
The divergence was fairly uni
form in each class.
With the women, 13 per
cent of the users thought
marijuana had a detrimental
effect, while almost a third of
the non-users thought so.
Three-fourths of the women
who had smoked pot thought
LSD was bad, while 92 per cent
of the non-users picked either
had or somewhat bad.
The other choices were nei
ther good nor bad, somewhat
good, or good.
The study also showed a defi
nite indication that marijuana
users drank alcoholic beverages
more often and more frequently
than non users. This was true
for both men and women.
More than 40 per cent of the
men and 65 per cent of the wom
en in Stern Hall have used mari
juana, according to a survey
taken by four Serra House resi
dents.
But the results of the poll,
taken last quarter for a house
seminar on "Drugs and the Com
munity," are being questioned
by the people who ran it.
"I think a good percentage
weren't truthful," Dave Koch
said. '1 know it (the amount
of marijuana use) Is much
higher."
The other three students in
volved with the survey are Don
Fisichella, Steve McAfTee, and
Earl Shelton.
Although half of the Stern
residents returned the question
naires, a sample which Koch
feels is large enough to give ac
curate results, he feels that resi
dents of houses where use of
marijuana is high did not re
spond honestly, fearing a pot
bust.
"What would you do if you
were a narco and saw a story
which reported 80 per cent pot
use in one house?" he said. "The
people here don't want another
Stony Brook."
Besides surveying use of
}narij uana, the poll asked
questions about use of alcohol
Und LSD, as well as attitudes
towards all three substances.
' Thirty-seven of the 65 women
in Stern returned answers, while
248 out of 509 men responded.
The results of the survey, al
though questioned as low by its
sponsors, show a percentage of
users twice that reported by
Ftichard Blum of Stanford's In
stitute for the Study of Human
Problems.
- His poll, taken last spring,
showed that one in five students
here had smoked marijuana.
Other results of the Stern
survey agTee with Blum's,
however. Both show, for ex
ample, that about six per cent
of the students have ever used
LSD.
. Of the marijuana users, the
overwhelming majority smoked
it either "very seldom" or "oc
casionally," the survey showed.

Three-fourths of the men and 95
per cent of the women smokers
picked either of these two
choices.
Only 25 per cent of the men
and five per cent of the women
said they smoked marijuana reg
ularly. None said they used it
"very frequently."
Among men, the use by class
was fairly even, ranging from
48 per cent for the juniors to
36 per cent for sophomores.
There was a wide spread
among women, however. Here,
the percentages varied from
89 p«'r cent for sophomores to
38 per cent for senior women.
The poll also asked how many
users had ever sold marijuana.

marijuana is high did not re
spond honestly, fearing a pot
bust.
"What would you do if you
were a narco and saw a story
which reported 80 per cent pot
use in one house?" he said. "The
people here don't want another
Stony Brook."
Besides surveying use of
}narij uana, the poll asked
questions about use of alcohol
Und LSD, as well as attitudes
towards all three substances.
' Thirty-seven of the 65 women
in Stern returned answers, while
248 out of 509 men responded.
The results of the survey, al
though questioned as low by its
sponsors, show a percentage of
users twice that reported by
Ftichard Blum of Stanford's In
stitute for the Study of Human
Problems.
- His poll, taken last spring,
showed that one in five students
here had smoked marijuana.
Other results of the Stern
survey agTee with Blum's,
however. Both show, for ex
ample, that about six per cent
of the students have ever used
LSD.
. Of the marijuana users, the
overwhelming majority smoked
it either "very seldom" or "oc
casionally," the survey showed.

Three-fourths of the men and 95
per cent of the women smokers
picked either of these two
choices.
Only 25 per cent of the men
and five per cent of the women
said they smoked marijuana reg
ularly. None said they used it
"very frequently."
Among men, the use by class
was fairly even, ranging from
48 per cent for the juniors to
36 per cent for sophomores.
There was a wide spread
among women, however. Here,
the percentages varied from
89 p«'r cent for sophomores to
38 per cent for senior women.
The poll also asked how many
users had ever sold marijuana.
Four per cent of the women—
all freshmen —and one-fifth of
the men said they had.
Of the women, 85 per cent of
those who have not smoked
marijuana said they have had
the opportunity to do so. Two
fifths of the non-users said they
would like to try it.
The percentages in these areas
were smaller for the men. Only
56 per cent of the non-users said
they had the chance to smoke
marijuana, and less than one
fourth of them would now like
to try.
Use of LSD, the survey
showed, was greater one year
ago than it is now, the ratio
being approximately two to
one.
Attitudes of users and non

users of marijuana to alcohol,
LSD, and marijuana were also
compared. In all cases, the atti
tudes of the marijuana users
was more liberal than those of
non-users. The difference was
more pronounced among men
than women, however.
For the men, only ten per cent
of marijuana users thought
that pot was either "bad" or
"somewhat bad," while of the
non-users 54 per cent picked one
of these choices.
Similarly, 17 per cent of the
users thought alcohol was either
bad or somewhat bad, with 27
per cent of the non-users agree
ing with them. For LSD, the
percentages were 75 for users
and 88 for non-users.
The divergence was fairly uni
form in each class.
With the women, 13 per
cent of the users thought
marijuana had a detrimental
effect, while almost a third of
the non-users thought so.
Three-fourths of the women
who had smoked pot thought
LSD was bad, while 92 per cent
of the non-users picked either
had or somewhat bad.
The other choices were nei
ther good nor bad, somewhat
good, or good.
The study also showed a defi
nite indication that marijuana
users drank alcoholic beverages
more often and more frequently
than non users. This was true
for both men and women.
More than 40 per cent of the
men and 65 per cent of the wom
en in Stern Hall have used mari
juana, according to a survey
taken by four Serra House resi
dents.
But the results of the poll,
taken last quarter for a house
seminar on "Drugs and the Com
munity," are being questioned
by the people who ran it.
"I think a good percentage
weren't truthful," Dave Koch
said. '1 know it (the amount
of marijuana use) Is much
higher."
The other three students in
volved with the survey are Don
Fisichella, Steve McAfTee, and
Earl Shelton.
Although half of the Stern
residents returned the question
naires, a sample which Koch
feels is large enough to give ac
curate results, he feels that resi
dents of houses where use of
marijuana is high did not re
spond honestly, fearing a pot
bust.
