# Committee Asks More Power For Students
## 
### 
Students should have more
power in educational policy
making, a blue-ribbon national
committee of educators and stu
dents has urged.
The Committee for the Stu
dent in Higher Education also
suggseted such sweeping re
forms a more exprimental col
leges, student representation on
boards of trustees, less competi
tion for grades, and an orienta
tion-type freshman year.
The committee's report said
students should be granted a
larger role in decision-making
because "they do have the in
sight into the meaning of
their educational experiences
which ought to be important
in making . . . administrative
decisions.
"Student representation at the
very highest governing levels of
the college—even on the board
of trustees, if possible—is also
necessary to prevent . . . the
repetition of student victimiza
tion by the professional guilds
and the college administrators."
Joseph Katz, professor of psy
chology and associate director
of Stanford's Institute for the
Study of Human Problems, was
a member of the group.
The report also said "wide
democratization of rule-making
and enforcement on campus
must be undertaken, and should
be done "with good grace rather
than as a result of ever-increas
ing student pressure."
Furthermore, the report
emphasized, all administrative
personnel, from the highest to
the lowest level, must play
a larger role in education be
cause "they are the ones stu
dents most frequently deal
with."
Also recommended in the re
port is more research on the ed

ucational application of develop
mental psychology and provi
sion for a liberal education for
those "who score relatively low
on the IQ scale."
Decrying large classes, the re
port stated, "No matter how
much it may confuse schedules
or course loads, and no matter
how many new faculty must
be hired, colleges should strive
to have as many individual
seminars or tutorials and as few
large lecture-hall classes as pos
sible."
Reduction of competition
among students was also urged.
Grades should be optional, and
students should be allowed to
take courses pass-fail if they
want to, the report said.
The committee also made rec
ommendations concerning pro
fessors.
"A new kind of faculty
must appear, composed of
men and women whose pri
mary concern is the facilita
tion of the learning experi
ence of students, and helping
them derive personal mean
ing from those experiences,"
the committee noted.
A good number of these peo
ple should not be from the aca
demic community at all, but
from the business world, they
feel.
Also, "the power of the pro
fessional academic guilds over
undergraduate instruction
should be broken. Faculty veto
groups, however powerful, can
no longer be permitted to block
reform in undergraduate edu
cation. or to specify what educa
tional experiences a young per
son should have before he is ad
mitted to a graduate school,"
the report stated.

students should be allowed to
take courses pass-fail if they
want to, the report said.
The committee also made rec
ommendations concerning pro
fessors.
"A new kind of faculty
must appear, composed of
men and women whose pri
mary concern is the facilita
tion of the learning experi
ence of students, and helping
them derive personal mean
ing from those experiences,"
the committee noted.
A good number of these peo
ple should not be from the aca
demic community at all, but
from the business world, they
feel.
Also, "the power of the pro
fessional academic guilds over
undergraduate instruction
should be broken. Faculty veto
groups, however powerful, can
no longer be permitted to block
reform in undergraduate edu
cation. or to specify what educa
tional experiences a young per
son should have before he is ad
mitted to a graduate school,"
the report stated.
Students should have more
power in educational policy
making, a blue-ribbon national
committee of educators and stu
dents has urged.
The Committee for the Stu
dent in Higher Education also
suggseted such sweeping re
forms a more exprimental col
leges, student representation on
boards of trustees, less competi
tion for grades, and an orienta
tion-type freshman year.
The committee's report said
students should be granted a
larger role in decision-making
because "they do have the in
sight into the meaning of
their educational experiences
which ought to be important
in making . . . administrative
decisions.
"Student representation at the
very highest governing levels of
the college—even on the board
of trustees, if possible—is also
necessary to prevent . . . the
repetition of student victimiza
tion by the professional guilds
and the college administrators."
Joseph Katz, professor of psy
chology and associate director
of Stanford's Institute for the
Study of Human Problems, was
a member of the group.
The report also said "wide
democratization of rule-making
and enforcement on campus
must be undertaken, and should
be done "with good grace rather
than as a result of ever-increas
ing student pressure."
Furthermore, the report
emphasized, all administrative
personnel, from the highest to
the lowest level, must play
a larger role in education be
cause "they are the ones stu
dents most frequently deal
with."
Also recommended in the re
port is more research on the ed

ucational application of develop
mental psychology and provi
sion for a liberal education for
those "who score relatively low
on the IQ scale."
Decrying large classes, the re
port stated, "No matter how
much it may confuse schedules
or course loads, and no matter
how many new faculty must
be hired, colleges should strive
to have as many individual
seminars or tutorials and as few
large lecture-hall classes as pos
sible."
Reduction of competition
among students was also urged.
Grades should be optional, and
students should be allowed to
take courses pass-fail if they
want to, the report said.
