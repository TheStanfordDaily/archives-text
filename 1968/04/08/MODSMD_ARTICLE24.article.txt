# Humanities Receives Gift From Avalon Foundation
## 
### 
A gift of $500,000 from the
Avalon Foundation to endow a
chair in the humanities at Stan
ford University was announced
recently by President Wallace
Sterling.
The new professorship will
be designated the "Avalon Foun
dation Chair in the Humanities,"
Sterling said.
The importance of the new
chair was underscored by Vice-
President and Provost Richard
W. Lyman and Dean Robert R.
Sears of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences.
"We are especially delighted
that the Avalon Foundation has
chosen to give Stanford a chair
in the humanities," Lyman said,
"for there is an ever-present

danger that humanistic studies
will receive less than their due in
a society attuned to the virtues
and achievements of science and
technology."
Sears noted the "crucial im
portance" of the chair to Stan
ford.
"The arts and humanities are
the forgotten men of the aca
demic world," he said. "The Fed
eral Government has put heavy
support into the natural and
social sciences, but so far it has
provided little for the humane
studies. The officers and trus
tees of the Avalon Foundation
deserve a very special thanks
for their recognition of this situ
ation and for their generous ac
tion to help restore a balance
among disciplines."
