# 'Grieve Not For Dr. King, Grieve For A Nation Torn'
## 
### 
(The following is a sermon given by Robert McAfee Brown at the
memorial service for Martin Luther King last Friday in Memorial
Church.)
I am very conscious of my whiteness on this occasion. Today it
is a mark of shame. For it is whiteness that has killed my black
brother. Not the whiteness of whoever pulled the trigger in that
senseless act at 4:17 p.m. on April 4 in the year of our Lord 1968,
but my whiteness your whiteness, in all the 4:17 p.m.'s that we
have lived uncaring lives, in all the indifferent breaths we have
drawn, in all the heedless ways we have failed to respond to the
creative opoprtunity Martin Luther King gave us to repair the
fruits of violence by non violent means, to be reconciled by love
rather than being further divided by hatred.
I do not know whether we are mature enough to live out the
things for which he died, or even by his death to be shocked out
of our genteel evansions of the questions that he asked. But I do
know that he would not will his death to be the occasion of new
violence, or new hatred, or further separations among the family
of men, and that he would will his death to preach more loudly
what his life preached daily and hourly—that hatred is corrosive,
that violence is destructive, that non-violence is powerful, and that
love is healing.
How will white and black respond to that message which he
lived and died? I am haunted by the exchange between the two
black priests in Alan Paton's Cry the Beloved Country. They are
talking about the white man, and Msimangu says to Kumalo, "I
have one great fear, that when they are turned to loving we will
have turned to hating." That may become the epitaph no only for
South Africa but for North America as well. I pray it will not. And
if it does not, it will be because one man, Martin Luther King, was
himself able to respond to hatred with love, and thereby to insipre
a whole generation to take seriously, to the extent of putting their
bodies on the line with his, that great vision of the power and the
force of sacrificial love.
Keep Vision
We must not lose that vision. I say that to black and white alike.
Most white men have not (in Msimangu's words) "turned to
loving," and many black men (also in his words) have "turned to
hating." If that—God forbid —is how it is to be, then we white men
must learn to absorb black hatred as Martin Luther King absorbed
white hatred, and all the words he spoke to his people about the
reconciling power of disciplined and sacrificial love must be the
words he speaks to us, for we are his people also—in a terrible way
we are more his people today than we were at this time yesterday,
numb though we may yet be.
As we gradually emerge from that numbness we grieve, all of
us. For whom do we grieve?
Grieve not for Martin Luther King. He knew for many years
that death and even violent death might be in store for him. He
knew that that price might be exacted, and he was fearlessly will

ing to pay it should it be demanded of him. As he said in Memphis
Wednesday, he had been to the mountain top and he had seen
the Promised Land. He knew that he might not get there, but he
told his people that that did not matter, that they would climb
that mountain, that they would see that vision, that they would
complete that journey. His eyes had seen the glory of the coming
of the Lord, and in that, he asserted, he was content.
For His Wife
Grieve not for Martin Luther King. Grieve rather for his wife
and children, whose charm and gentleness wore strength and power
incarnate, and who because of an act of senseless brutality have
been forced to render up what was most precious to them.
Grieve not for Martin Luther King. Grieve rather for all black
men who found in him the voice of their hope, the dreamer of
their dream, the chamipon of their cause, the inspiration for their
activity, and who are bereft today in a way no white man can
imagine.
Grieve not for Martin Luther King. Grieve rather for all white
men who by our very whiteness are implicated in the guilt of this
man's death, we who were too deaf to hear his voice, too stubborn
to respond to his pleas, too slow to realize that he offered us an un
paralleled gift—the opportunity we have thus far spurned, to re
dress wrong without committing further wrong.
Black And White
Grieve not for Martin Luther King. Grieve rather for blacks and
white together, who in him could transcend otherwise insurmount
able differences, who in what he stood for could, for miraculous
moments, be drained of hatred, purged of malice, and united in a
common purpose with a wonderful solidarity, black and white
together.
Grieve not for Martin Luther King. Grieve rather for a nation,
torn apart by white arrogance that must not be condoned and by
black bitterness that must be understood, torn apart by animosities
that non-violence and love alone can fully overcome, torn apart
by an evil war that Dr. King condemned in the lonely days before
it was fashionable to do so, torn apart by evil laws and then by
better laws so inefficiently administered, and torn apart afresh each
day not so much by the appalling brutality of evil men as by the
appalling silence of good men.
Grieve not for Martin Luther King. Grieve rather for a world
in which men both at home and abroad increasingly turn to
violence at a time when violence threatens to destroy us all, and
when we most needed this apostle of good will and love, who
demonstrated to us "a more excellent way," who showed us that
one who had every right to hate could nevertheless embrace his
enemy in love, and who showed that love to the uttermost by lay
irjg down his life for his friends.
Grieve not for Martin Luther King. Grieve rather for his pre
carious and stubborn vision, and pray that even yet, at this late
hour, we shall overcome.
