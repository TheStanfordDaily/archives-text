# Sights And Sounds: Flowers, Fraternities, East Palo Alto

Random impressions and observations of Stan
ford after the death of Martin Luther King. . .
Apathy and agony were stressed as the Stan
for reatcion in the story in Friday's Daily. But
maybe most of the apathy was only relative,
viewed as such in the eyes of those who truly
felt the agony.
For the place was actually a little more
subdued than usual. There were some places
where no reaction —or worse, a negative one
such as the food fight in one Wilbur House —
but in others the response was merely delayed.
Fraternities did not cancel their open houses
scheduled for Thursday night, but in at least
one, Kappa Alpha, the house president told the
brothers they did not have to attend, something
which is usually obligatory.
The Zetes cancelled their Friday night party,
an unusual occurrence, and Dean Napier was
there instead. They also showed a film, the CBS
News special program on the President's civil
disorders commission report.
Beta Chi also cancelled parties scheduled for
the weekend.
"It just took a while for us to react," one SAE
said.
And the SAEs did react, Saturday night.
Their party was cut short at midnight, since
Sunday had been declared a national day of
mourning.
"I think we should all go back and do a little
soul searching," Bob Mathieson, social chairman
and former house president said to the group.
"The people in the house have been doing a lot
of thinking about this thing," he commented
later. "Fraternities really have a lot mqre to offer
than some people make out. I'll admit, though,
that not all houses are like this one."
On the last point, at least, there was there was
little doubt. For next door, at the Phil Delt house,
the party was still in full swing.

I cruised through East Palo Alto twice Fri

day night. The shock had settled down to a
dull pain, and the small —small as compared to
other areas of the country—amount of violence
there had stopped.
The streets, for the most part, were silent,
more so than one would expect for a Friday
night. The only disturbance I saw was outside
a bar.
It seemed as if a dark blanket had settled
over East Palo Alto, and the people were slowly,
silently, numbly moving about under it.
Meanwhile, KSOL cancelled its usual schedule
and was playing spirituals throughout the night.

The words that were spoken were often
cliches, or, with constant repitition, soon began
to sound that way.
But the sights were not. For the second time
in a week people gathered around television sets,
watching closely, but with nothing very coherent
to say.
The Friday, the march up University Avenue
and Palm Drive. Faces. Every color, every age,
silently moving forward. From in front of the
Quad, where Provost Lyman and Dean Napier
waited with scores of others, the scene was
unique.
A silent mass of humanity slowly approached
between the palms. Then, at the circle, it split
for a moment, joined again, and continued its
inexorable advance across the grass.
And finally the flowers. Asked to leave the
blossoms they had carried on the march on
the ground where they were standing, the
people did so.
But when the marchers walked back, would
the flowers they left be trampled on the grass
as a sad and rather disheartening symbol?
The surprise was that the flowers were not
crushed. As the crowd dispersed, each person
seemed to very carefully walk around the flowers
in his path, leaving the symbols of peace, of
hope, to last a short while longer.

MEMORIAL SERVICE — Students and faculty members packed Memorial Church for the me
morial service to Dr. King: Friday at noon. In the service Johnnie Scott, a black junior English
major, presented one of his poems. "Oh, America, but you're such a lonely one — gone temporarily
Insane, killing those most dear to you," he said.
