# Prayer For King
## 
### 
(The following is the prayer offered by B. Davie Napier, dean of
the chapel, at the noon memorial service and at the end of the
march up University.)

Eternal God, Lord of life and death, to whom black and white
are alike, to whom man is man. ... we confess that the words of
conventional piety escape us now, that we cannot honestly say, ex
cept in irony, Thou hast given, take thou away; blessed be thy
name. We protest with they servants of old, Jeremiah and Job and
Habakkuk, that thou hast engaged us in an unequal contest, and
thou, Giver and Taker, hast prevailed. But we protest in thy pres
ence, and in thy hearing, and with such faith as in thy grace thou
givest us.

If we are outraged, or cynical or bitter in our loss, or frightened,
or in despair, we are nevertheless grateful to thee, the author of
life, that Martin Luther King was; that as long as we who ad
mired him, loved him, believed in him, rejoiced in him— as long
as we live, he is; and that indeed, in his own faith and that of many
of us here, he may yet be, in thee, in thy life, in thy love.

We who are white acknowledge in shame our white apathy,
brutality, arrogance, or indifference that makes us all participants
in his death. At the same time, we acknowledge thy great goodness
in this finished life, magnificently and courageously lived and now
without bitterness surrendered. We thank thee for thy servant
Martin. We thank thee for thy gift of his life, for all the short time
in our years that he gave to all of us his own gifts of counsel and
strength and unparalleled compassion. We commend to thy com
passion his family and all those bound closely and intimately to him
in love. For Martin Luther King, now taken from us all, we give
thee thanks.

MURDERED LEADER — Martin Luther King, Jr., spoke last at Stanford April 14, 1967. In that
speech King said that black power and riots may be the results of the ntuch-discussed "white back
lash" instead of its cause. Riots, he said, are the "language of the unheard." At right Stanford
students are shown listening to King during his April 14 speech..
