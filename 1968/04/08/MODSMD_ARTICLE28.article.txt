## Blacks Hit Racism, Burn Flag 
### MARK LITTLE 
The burning of an American flag last Friday at noon accom
panied a warning from Black Stanford students than Stanford
whites had better "get together" and "clear your own house."
The Black Student Union-sponsored rally on White Plaza fea
tured eight black speakers whose reactions varied from mild
prophesies to bitter hatred and vivid threats.
One of the speakers, Dolores Mack, told the crowd of over a
hundred whites, "I don't want to see your white faces. I don't
even want to talk to you. You killed Martin Luther King, you,
the people in front of me."
One of the more militant speakers, Art Wilson, gave the students
an ultimatum: "You (whites) have been killing us for a long time,
but now it's not going to be us who are going to die. You think
you are nice and secure in your classrooms and libraries, but no
body is going to be safe if you don't clean out racism yourselves.
When we start to fight back, we're not going to ask if you're from
Montana. It just won't make any difference."
The blacks and whites were separated on either side of the
microphone. About forty blacks and one Italian stood behind the
microphone. Half-way through the rally the Italian rose to the
microphone and told the crowd that he couldn't understand why
there was a line which separated the blacks and the whites.
The Italian went on to invite the whites to prove their hatred of
racism by crossing the line over to the blacks* side. About 20 whites
responded by trying to cross the line. Countee immediately seized
the microphone back and told the whites to "get your mothers
buns back on your side. If anybody is going to run this show
it is going to be me. We'll tell you when we need your help."
When the next speaker, John Powell, spoke, a white student
yelled out, "By not letting us cross the line, you're showing that
all you want to do is segregate." Bitter name calling followed which
resulted in both men facing off for a fight. After the fight was
averted, Powell calmly told the audience, "I'm not a non-violent
person." The crowd loudly cheered.
Ron Van Downing, another of the speakers, later explained that
Countee tried to separate the whites because their crossing over
had been advised by a white man — the Italian — on the pretense
that it was desired by the blacks. "You can't expect any black to
like a white calling the shots at a black rally,' 'he said.
Countee's statement to the crowd to "Get back. We'll integrate
with you when we're ready" meant", according to Van Downing,
"Simple integration in the anti-racism movement is not the answer.
Whites have got to get rid of racism on their own because we can't
help them any."
Black Student Union co-chairman, Kenny Washington, finished
the program by telling the crowd, "This (Dr. King's murder) is
nothing new to us. Whites have been exterminating blacks for
400 years. For thirty years after the civil war whites were killing
off blacks at the rate of one every other day. During the period
1900 and 1926 whites were killing one black every third day. We
expected Dr. King to be shot."
While Washington was speaking, the 40 blacks grouped together
In a tightly knit huddle around him. When they stepped back, there
was a large American flag burning on the ground.
As the flag burned Washington said, "This burning flag may
mean a lot to you but it doesn't mean much to us. The fact that

we are Americans is only incidental to us. The burning flag is in
cidental to us. We are primarily human beings."
As the crowd was dispersing Johnny Scott, former chairman of
the Black Student Union, arrived after having given a eulogy to Dr.
King in Memorial Church and told the whites, "If they can kill
Martin Luther King they can and will kill anybody."
