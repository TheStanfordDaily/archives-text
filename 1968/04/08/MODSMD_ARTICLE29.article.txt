# Death May Alter Washington Study
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
As a result of questions concerning the planned Poor People's
Campaign which have arisen with Martin Luther King Jr.'s death,
the faculty group sponsoring Stanford's program of field research
are meeting this afternoon to consider possible changes.
Dr. Ralph D. Abemathy, who assumed leadership Friday of
King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), in
dicated that work would be resumed on the project after a "neces
sary period of readjustment."
Political Science Prof. Charles Drekmeier, chairman of the
Stanford faculty group sponsoring the Washington study, said
yesterday that the group "may reduce the size of the program."
If students are uncertain about continuing with the study, Drek
meier said, "We will encourage them to not go."
Terry Barnett, one of the students accepted for the program,
said yesterday he wondered if students would still he "officially
welcome" as observers.
Stanford's participation is based on King's official invitation,
Barnett pointed out. "But the group supporting the Campaign is
really a coalition," he added. "Some of these people don't support
the nonviolent aspect."
Another student, David Gast, said that he still had not "defi
nitely decided" whether to continue in the program. He went on
to say that his initial reaction, after nearning of King's death was
not to go to Washington, but his position has wavered over the
weekend.
Other students contacted yesterday indicated that lack of com
munication between the group and the faculty over the weekend
has left them uncertain. Elliot Adalman said expressed uncertainty
as to whether the Campaign was still on or whether the university
would let students go.
The University of California at Berkeley, which had planned to
leave for Washington, D.C. today, h£s postponed their departure
for a week.
One of the West Coast coordinators of SCLC touched off specu
lation that the Campaign would be postponed until mid-May. For
the Stanford group, whose field research was already limited to
four or five weeks, this two week delay adds additional complica
tions.
The problem of possible hostility towards white students partici
pating as observers raises additional problems. Drekmeier stated
that the Stanford group may have "two programs — one for black
students and one for white students."
One of the students also raised the possibility that some parents
may now refuse to give their permission, which the University
requires for participation in the program.

We may have to repent in this generation not for
the violent aetions of had people but for the inac
tion of good people who have the notion that time
tcill cure all evil."
