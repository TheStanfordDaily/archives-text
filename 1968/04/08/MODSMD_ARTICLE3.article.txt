Former Assistant Secretary of
State Roger Hilsman Jr. will

Society," it was announced by
the Stanford Days of Concern
steering committee.
The speech, scheduled for 2
p.m. in Memorial Auditorium,
will lead off the two-day pro
gram of speeches and panels on
'The University in a Time of
Crisis."
Hilsman's talk will be follow

A specialist in Far Eastern
affairs, Hilsman joined the State
Department in 1961 and re

fessor of government at Colum
bia University.
His most recent book, To
Move a Nation, was published

last year to wide critical ac
claim. The book was highly crit
ical of American Vietnam policy.
In June 1965 Hilsman, ap

pearing on CBS television's
"Face the Nation," criticized the
Johnson Administration's bomb
ing policy over North Vietnam,
saying it was intended only to
"force Hanoi to its knees."
Further, he said, there was
"no hard evidence" of large
scale North Vietnamese pres
ence in the South before Ameri
can bombing of the North began
in February 1965.
When he resigned in 1964,
however, Hilsman said he was
"not quarreling" with Adminis
tration policy, although the
New York Times reported Hils
man "is thought to have op
posed extension of the war into
North Vietnam."
Hilsman's direct experience in
Southeast Asia dates back to
World War 11. A 1943 graduate
of West Point, he served with
Merrill's Marauders in Burma,
and later commanded his own
OSS guerrilla group there. In
1945 he became assistant chief
of Far East intelligence opera
tions at OSS headquarters in
Washington.
In 1946 he moved to the Cen
tral Intelligence Agency as as
sistant to the executive officer.
From 1950 to 1952, he was a
planning officer for NATO af
fairs in London, then worked a
year in the international politics
branch of U.S. European Com
mand Headquarters. Here-
th it post in 1953.
