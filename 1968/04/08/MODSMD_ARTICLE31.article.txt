# Shank, Poteete Spark Doubleheader Sweep
## 
### PETER DUFFY 
Harvey Shank's two-hitter
gave the Stanford Indians a 1-0
victory and a doubleheader
sweep over Brigham Young
University Saturday afternoon,
after Rod Poteete pitched the
Tribe to a 3-1 win in the opener.
It was Shank's second two
hitter of the early season, as
the fastworking and hardthrow
ing righthander struck out four
and walked only one in the ab
breviated seven-inning nightcap.
The Tribe secored their only
run of the second game in the
second inning, and it proved
to be sufficient. Mike Amml
rato led off with a walk, stole
second, and moved to third on
an infield out. Ron Shotts then
laid down a perfect bunt on a
squeeze play that brought Am
mirato home for the Tribe's
winning marker.
In the opener Rod Poteete
was touched for only five hits
and one run. BYU scored their
lone tally in the fifth when they
bunched three singles together.
Aside from that, Poteete looked
very sharp in walking only one
batter and fanning six.
The Tribe score early in the
opening contest with two tallies
in the final inning. Mark Mar
quess opened with a walk, stole
second, and JefT Rohlfing drove
both runners home with a line
single to right.
Stanford added another run in
the fourth. Ammirato and
Shotts collected successive

singles, putting runners on first
and third. Bob Edie dumped a
bunt down the third base line,
allowing Ammirato to score the
Tribe's third and final run.
The Indian bats were qui
escent in the doubleheader as
only eleven hits were garner
ed in the two contests. Bob
Gallagher's triple in the sec
ond game was their only ex
tra-base blow of the game.

Harvey Shank's two-hitter
gave the Stanford Indians a 1-0
victory and a doubleheader
sweep over Brigham Young
University Saturday afternoon,
after Rod Poteete pitched the
Tribe to a 3-1 win in the opener.
It was Shank's second two
hitter of the early season, as
the fastworking and hardthrow
ing righthander struck out four
and walked only one in the ab
breviated seven-inning nightcap.
The Tribe secored their only
run of the second game in the
second inning, and it proved
to be sufficient. Mike Amml
rato led off with a walk, stole
second, and moved to third on
an infield out. Ron Shotts then
laid down a perfect bunt on a
squeeze play that brought Am
mirato home for the Tribe's
winning marker.
In the opener Rod Poteete
was touched for only five hits
and one run. BYU scored their
lone tally in the fifth when they
bunched three singles together.
Aside from that, Poteete looked
very sharp in walking only one
batter and fanning six.
The Tribe score early in the
opening contest with two tallies
in the final inning. Mark Mar
quess opened with a walk, stole
second, and JefT Rohlfing drove
both runners home with a line
single to right.
Stanford added another run in
the fourth. Ammirato and
Shotts collected successive

singles, putting runners on first
and third. Bob Edie dumped a
bunt down the third base line,
allowing Ammirato to score the
Tribe's third and final run.
The Indian bats were qui
escent in the doubleheader as
only eleven hits were garner
ed in the two contests. Bob
Gallagher's triple in the sec
ond game was their only ex
tra-base blow of the game.

University Saturday afternoon,
after Rod Poteete pitched the
Tribe to a 3-1 win in the opener.
It was Shank's second two
hitter of the early season, as
the fastworking and hardthrow
ing righthander struck out four
and walked only one in the ab
breviated seven-inning nightcap.
The Tribe secored their only
run of the second game in the
second inning, and it proved
to be sufficient. Mike Amml
rato led off with a walk, stole
second, and moved to third on
an infield out. Ron Shotts then
laid down a perfect bunt on a
squeeze play that brought Am
mirato home for the Tribe's
winning marker.
In the opener Rod Poteete
was touched for only five hits
and one run. BYU scored their
lone tally in the fifth when they
bunched three singles together.
Aside from that, Poteete looked
very sharp in walking only one
batter and fanning six.
The Tribe score early in the
opening contest with two tallies
in the final inning. Mark Mar
quess opened with a walk, stole
second, and JefT Rohlfing drove
both runners home with a line
single to right.
Stanford added another run in
the fourth. Ammirato and
Shotts collected successive

singles, putting runners on first
and third. Bob Edie dumped a
bunt down the third base line,
allowing Ammirato to score the
Tribe's third and final run.
The Indian bats were qui
escent in the doubleheader as
only eleven hits were garner
ed in the two contests. Bob
Gallagher's triple in the sec
ond game was their only ex
tra-base blow of the game.
