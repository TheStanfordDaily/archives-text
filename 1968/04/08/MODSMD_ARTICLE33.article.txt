# Upsets Spike Surprising Tribe Volleyball Success
## 
### 
At the end of last quarter and
during spring break, the Stan
ford volleyball team turned in
some sterling efforts in tourna
ment play.
Playing in the tough ."A" divi
sion at the Chabot College
Open, the Indians took a strong
third behind San F v ancisco
Olympic Club and Stockton
YMCA.
En route to this surprising
finish, the six-man corps of Jeff
Pierose, Rocky Laverty, Steve
Harbison, John Burch, Mike Ste
vens and Jim Julian knocked
off the nationally-ranked Olym
pic Club to hand them their only
defeat of the tournament, 8-6. It
was the "upset of the year" for
Northern California volleyball,
since the rookie Stanford club
was competing against many ex-
Olympians and Pan American
Games team members.
The next tournament was
the regional championships In
San Jose, and the Stanford
team was plagued by absences
due to spring break. There
fore, they dropped down to a
still tough "B" division and
proceeded to walk off with the
crown. Team members were:
Hank Morgan, Dick Zolarko,
John Burch, Mike Stevens,
Ned Groth, Bill Yates, and Don
Carpenter.
Finally, a highlight of the
spring break for the team was
participation in the Santa Bar
bara Annual Collegiate Tourney
held at UCSB. This tourney con
tained literally all the major col
lege volleyball powers in the na

tion, and Stanford finished a
strong fifth.
Before bowing out the Stan
ford combo of Laverty, Burch,
Pierose, Stevens, Julian, Mike
Moore, Chris McLachlin, Er
nie Banks, and Bob Conrad
again managed to pull a big
upset, this time dumping the
number one college team in the
nation, San Diego State, 15-12.
The Indians then proceeded to
upset second-ranked Santa
Monica College in one game,
only to lose the other two by
close scores.
All in all, the past few tourna
ments and upsets have given
new life to the Stanford volley
ball team. Their future plans, in
hopes of a high finish at the Far
Western Championships April 19
in Alameda and at the National
Championships May 8 in Port
land, are more of the same in
gredients which have brought
them success so far: hard work,
determination, and lots of desire.

spring break for the team was
participation in the Santa Bar
bara Annual Collegiate Tourney
held at UCSB. This tourney con
tained literally all the major col
lege volleyball powers in the na

tion, and Stanford finished a
strong fifth.
Before bowing out the Stan
ford combo of Laverty, Burch,
Pierose, Stevens, Julian, Mike
Moore, Chris McLachlin, Er
nie Banks, and Bob Conrad
again managed to pull a big
upset, this time dumping the
number one college team in the
nation, San Diego State, 15-12.
The Indians then proceeded to
upset second-ranked Santa
Monica College in one game,
only to lose the other two by
close scores.
All in all, the past few tourna
ments and upsets have given
new life to the Stanford volley
ball team. Their future plans, in
hopes of a high finish at the Far
Western Championships April 19
in Alameda and at the National
Championships May 8 in Port
land, are more of the same in
gredients which have brought
them success so far: hard work,
determination, and lots of desire.
At the end of last quarter and
during spring break, the Stan
ford volleyball team turned in
some sterling efforts in tourna
ment play.
Playing in the tough ."A" divi
sion at the Chabot College
Open, the Indians took a strong
third behind San F v ancisco
Olympic Club and Stockton
YMCA.
En route to this surprising
finish, the six-man corps of Jeff
Pierose, Rocky Laverty, Steve
Harbison, John Burch, Mike Ste
vens and Jim Julian knocked
off the nationally-ranked Olym
pic Club to hand them their only
defeat of the tournament, 8-6. It
was the "upset of the year" for
Northern California volleyball,
since the rookie Stanford club
was competing against many ex-
Olympians and Pan American
Games team members.
The next tournament was
the regional championships In
San Jose, and the Stanford
team was plagued by absences
due to spring break. There
fore, they dropped down to a
still tough "B" division and
proceeded to walk off with the
crown. Team members were:
Hank Morgan, Dick Zolarko,
John Burch, Mike Stevens,
Ned Groth, Bill Yates, and Don
Carpenter.
Finally, a highlight of the
spring break for the team was
participation in the Santa Bar
bara Annual Collegiate Tourney
held at UCSB. This tourney con
tained literally all the major col
