The English athletic renais- j
sance continues! Strange as it
may seem to softball players in
America, it is supported by the
fact that Stanford's two win

and Cricket, both as British as
bitters and bowlers.
Stanford's cricket team last
year won all the silver that was
up for grabs, from the Northern
California division title to the
annual six-a-side tournament.
In an effort to retain its su
premacy this year, the club is
encouraging any and all mem
bers of the Stanford community
to join the team. Fringe benefits
include travel, suntans, occa
sional exercise and frequent bar
parties. For further information,
please call Michael Bond, cap
tain, at 322-6137 or Mike Feld
man, secretary, at 321-5816. God
save the Queen! Rah!
