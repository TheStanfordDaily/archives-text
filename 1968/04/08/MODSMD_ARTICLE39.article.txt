# 'Not Optimistic'
## Burns Hits Tax Increase 
### 
Arthur Burns, visiting econom
ics professor and one of the na
tion's top economists, said last
week he is "not at all optimistic"
that a ten per cent increase and
a $0 billion cut in spending will
succeed in stopping inflation and
restoring international confi
dence in the dollar.
A year ago, these steps would
have been "an effective, work
able combination," he said, but
"the 'new economists' overdid
it."
Burns Ls presently board
chairman of the National Hu
reau of Economic Research
and was chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers
during the Elsenhower Admin
istration.
He told Stanford's profession
al journalism fellows and news
men attending a Hoover Institu
tion seminar that he personally
favors a national austerity pro
gram—but doubts it would long
be acceptable to politicians or
the people.
"I lean more and more toward
raising the price of gold—a po
sition I've fought against for
years," he said. Even though its
long-run effects probably would
be inflationary, this step "would
give us a little more time to
work toward a policy of pru
dence." Burns said prices have
gone up 10 per cent in the past

four years. Inflationary forces
are now widespread and accele
rating within the economy, he
added.
When price trends, social se
curity, and taxes are taken into
account, he said, "the income of
the average American workman
has dropped a shade lower"
every year since 1965.
"Inflation Ls nullifying the
effectiveness of all legislative
measures" against poverty, he
added. "There's no doubt poor
people are the chief sufferers
from inflation. The wealthy
know how to protect them
selves. Poor people are worse
off ttwlay than they were a

year or two ago. That's a
great Injustice."
Among the wealthy, tho num
ber of families experiencing in
come gains "far exceeds" those
suffering declines in the past
few years, he said. But among
the poor, the families enjoying
increases are about the same
as those experiencing setbacks,
he observed.
Burns discounted Vietnam,
business market power, trade
unions, and Congressional de
lays as causes of the current
crisis. "The Administration's
monetary and fiscal policy must
be blamed much more," he de
clared,
