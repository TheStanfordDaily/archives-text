# Committee Of 15 Offers New Judicial Settlement
## 
### 
The Committee of Fifteen has
recommended a compromise set
tlement of Stanford's lengthly
judicial dispute, it was learned
Saturday.
This negotiating committee of
students, faculty and adminis
trators has sent President Wal
lace Sterling a plan for a stu
dent-faculty judicial board. "Fi
nal recommendations" on stu
dent discipline would be made
by this body to Sterling, who re
tains ultimate disciplinary
power.
Still to be resolved is the
problem of selecting student
members for such a judicial
board. One informed student
said some student group, such
as the legislature rould nomi
nate candidates for the student
faculty board, with the Univer
sity President approving the
nominations
The Committee of Fifteen's
recommendation was mentioned
in a memorandum circulated at
the Associated Students' Consti
tutional Convention Saturday.
Existing judicial boards, such
as the ASSU judicial council and
the all-faculty Interim Judicial
Body, would be replaced by a
"fact-finding apparatus," accord
ing to the memorandum. The
student-faculty board would act
as an appellate body.
Students would retain the
right to have their cases heard
by the Dean of Students instead
of the judicial bodies.
A student-faculty board was
proposed several years ago as a
solution to a dispute between
student government and the ad
ministration. But no acceptable
method was found for choosing
student members.
The current crisis started in
October, 1967 with a demonstra
tion against CIA recruiting. Ten
students were charged with vio
lation of the University demon
strations policy.
The ASSU judicial council
found the students not guilty
and maintained that the demon
strations policy was unenforce

able. The Deans of Students re
fused to accept this decision and
planned to appeal to the Inter
im Judicial Body, which the
ASSU does not recognize.
The Interim Judicial Body
took no action while the Com
mittee of Fifteen worked on the
compromise plan.
So far Sterling has announced
no action on the student-faculty
board.
