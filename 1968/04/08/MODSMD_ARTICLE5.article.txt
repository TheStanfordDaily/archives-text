Plans for the draw for Univer
sity housing are still incomplete
but are expected this week. Miss
Sally Mahoney, assistant dean of
students, told The Daily late last
week.
Earlier last week, she said
that one of the problems which
hadn't been worked out was
what to do about those students
who were displaced by the draw.
Hulme and McFarland houses,
high rises in Escondido Village,
will become coeducational.
