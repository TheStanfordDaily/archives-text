# ASSU Convention Begins
## Wider Student Role Urged 
### THOMAS DAWSON 
The ASSU Constitutional Con
vention has endorsed the mem
bership of students on all presi
dential committees and the sel
ection of the student financial
manager by a student-factuly
administration committee.
The first session of the con
vention, held Saturday, con
cerned itself with the role of
student government in the uni
versity. The second session,
s'ated for April 20, will focus
on the structure of student gov
ernment.
Workshops at the Saturday
session examined five aspects of
student government: finances,
the judicial system, the role of
students in university govern
ance, services to the student
body and the relationship of stu
dent gov rnment to non-univers
ity affairs.
About sixty students attended
the all day session that began
with a moment of silence in
memory of Dr. Martin Luther
King. Attendance was less than
expect d but organizers attrib
uted this to the shock of King's
assassination.
Denis Hayes, ASSU Vice-
President, opened the conven
tion saying that it was hard to
be concerned with such a meet
ing "when the events [resulting

from Dr. King's death] are so
much more important than any
thing we could accomplish here."
The finances workshop pro
posed the establishment of var
iable student fees so that "the
activities and exepnditures of
student government could ex
pand and contract." At present,
ASSU receives three dollars per
quarter per student from the
University. ASSU has no direct
control over the amount.
The committee recommended
that the amount of the fees be
voted upon by the student body
in the spring at the time of the
presidential e^ctions.
A second workshop concerned
with the role of students
in university governance. It
recommended that all Presi
dential and Academic Council
committees have students as
voting members. At present, it
is up to the individual commit
te s whether the student mem
bers vote. Some Academic Coun
cil committees do not have stu
dent members.
"Our goal is community gov
ernment" states the introduc
tion to the report of the work
shop. Membrs of the group also
pointed out that many of the
current student committee mem
bers have not reported baek to
the student body. It was recom

mended that in the future all
student members report their
actions in the Daily.
The workshop on campus judi
ciary endorsed the creation of
a student-faculty committee that
would handle all judicial cases.
"A proposal to restructure the
University judicial system is ex
pected to come out ... in the
near future," the workshop
stated. Also discussed was the
creation of separate judicial sys
tems for the various graduate
schools.
A fourth workshop met on
social services to the .student
body. Included in the discussion
was the establishment of sepa
rate student governments for
the graduate schools. Also rec
ommended was the creation of
an office to coordinate events
and to reconcile time conflicts.
This office would also publicize
these events "to replace the cur
rent various inadequate lists of
events."
The non - university affairs
workshop emphasized "the right
and necessity of a students' or
ganization to deal with and ex
press opinions on any issue it
desires." The group recommend
ed that, whenever possible, the
issue be presented to the stu
dent body for approval.
