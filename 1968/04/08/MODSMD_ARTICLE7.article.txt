• Bombing Pause
SAIGON (AP) — President
Johnson has taken another step
to restrict the bombing of North
Vietnam, U.S. sources said Mon
day.
The President, without an
nouncing it, has limited Ameri
can air strikes over the North
from the •demilitarized zone to
the 19th parallel, a stretch of
about 170 miles, the U.S. infor
mants said.
American bombers confined

their raids over the North for
the fourth straight day Sunday
within the 145 miles from the
DMZ to Vinh city, a sector en
tirely below the 19th parallel.
Publicly. Johnson's order an
nounced March 31 stands. This
curtailed U.S. air strikes over
North Vietnam to an area of
about 225 miles between the de
militarized zone and the 20th
parallel.
The sources said orders have
gone out to air wings to limit
their attacks to the 19th paral
lel. They said this was not being
publicized because the Presi
dent wanted to leave open the
option of bombing up to the
20th parallel.

Martin Luther King mad? final
plans Sunday for her husband's
funeral and then tentatively
scheduled a one-day visit to the
city where he was slain to add
dramatic support to the cause in
which he died.

new head of the civil rights or
ganization Dr. King lead, said
that Mrs. King would lead a
street march Mondav in Mem
phis, Tenn., on behalf of striking

not final.
"We believe that we will be
able to conduct a nonviolent
demonstration," the Rev. Mr.
Abernathy said, "but we can
not make a guarantee."
Dr. King was assassinated in
Memphis last Thursday.

• ISew Canada Head
OTTAWA (AP)—Despite the
misgivings of some old line poli
ticians, the Liberal party's
choice of Pierre Elliott Trudoau
as Canada's next primp minis
ter has been generally well re
ceived.
The 46-year-old French Cana
dian bachelor, known as a
swinger with a left-wing back
ground, won the Liberal loader
ship Saturday night over a field
of experienced and distin
guished political figures.
It was an amazing perform
ance for a man who had be r, n in
the party only since 19G5 and in

the Cabinet less than a year,
who had only an amateur organ
ization and who had often re
ceived more attention for his
miniskirted girl friends and
sports cars than for his political
achievements.
• Viet Peace Seen
SAIGON (AP)—South Viet
nam prefers a neutral country
as the site for any talks to end
the war, Foreign Minister Tran
Van Do said Sunday.
He ruled out Paris or capitals
of Communist countries such as
the Soviet Union or Poland.
Present thinking in Saigon, he
added, is that, talks should be
held in Geneva, Tokyo or New
Delhi, India.
U.N. Secretary ■ General U
Thant said Geneva is "quite a
good possibility" for prelimi
nary talks, which he asserted
will begin very soon.

preached, quiet tribute was paid
