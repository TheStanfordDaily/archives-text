# Med School Moves To Enact Changes
## 
### 
Major changes in curriculum
allow students to become phy
sicians in the tlexible atmos
phere of a graduate school have
been approved by the faculty
of the medical school.
The changes are outlined in
a document made public today
by Dr. Robert J. Glaser, vice
president for medical affairs
and dean of the medical school.
Proposed initially by the com
mittee on medical education, the
report calls for efforts "to pro

portunities for studying medi
cine in the context of their own
needs, abilities, and ambitions
than is now possible."
Specifically, the report rec
ommends: 1) redefining the
present "core" curriculum
with increased elective oppor
tunities for satisfying re
quirements in subject areas,
2) allowing students to devel
op highly individualized study
plans and, 3) establishing an
appropriate faculty body to
implement the curriculum
proj>osals by September, 1968.
The new plan, prepared by the
committee under the chairman
ship of Dr. Leßoy A. Pesch, as
sociate dean, Is considered like
ly to draw wide attention in
medical circles, where Stanford's
curriculum is already regarded
as more flexible than most.
In 1959, the Stanford medical
curriculum was completely re
built to improve the education
of the future doctor by spread
ing his studies over five years
instead of four and teaching him
principles rather than mastery
of specific detail.
One of the key elements of
the initial Stanford Plan of Med
ical Education was the recog
nition that there has to be in
dependence and flexibility in the
scheme of medical education.
These two ingredients were pro
vided by the establishment of
a "core" curriculum, which in
cludes essential instruction for
every medical student, with
"free" time for electives.
However, after nearly eight
years of experience, the fac
ulty concluded that "the cur
rucliilum as now implement
ed did not completely achieve
its objectives as a true gradu
ate experience." The report
considers the present plan too
uniform to be suitable for the
great variety of students who
enter Stanford medical school.
Despite the adoption of a rath
er unusual curriculum, the stu
dents' contact with patients was
generally delayed until the third
year and the beginning of the
clinical studies. This, in Dr.
Glaser's view, has perpetuated
the isolation which some stu
dents feel from clinical medi
cine.
Dr. Glaser stressed that a
"core" curriculum to provide the
essential common ground of in
formation in the biological, be
havioral, and clinical sciences
would still be required of all fu
ture physicans. Rut the student
will have elective options or
different ways of meeting these
requirements.
The "core" would be design
ed to put the focus of teaching
on topics that are pertinent to
the education of physicians.
Duplication as well as over- or
underemphasis in certain areas
will be held in check.
The medical school is now
using computers to study the
present input in the education
of medical students. Thus, much
tediousness and repetition might
be eliminated by alternative
courses of study, each with con
siderable flexibility designed for
the needs of different medical
careers.
"Greater flexibility," Dr.
Glaser said, "is necessary be
cause of the undeniable up
grading in the quality of the
entering student."
Under the flexible plan, stu
dents will be admitted to Stan
ford medical school as candi
dates for the M.D. degree. The
traditional classification of
first, second, third, fourth,
and fifth-year student will be
abolished. Each student's
study plans will he developed
in consultation with faculty
ml visors.

considers the present plan too

great variety of students who
enter Stanford medical school.
Despite the adoption of a rath
er unusual curriculum, the stu
dents' contact with patients was
generally delayed until the third
year and the beginning of the
clinical studies. This, in Dr.
Glaser's view, has perpetuated
the isolation which some stu
dents feel from clinical medi
cine.
Dr. Glaser stressed that a
"core" curriculum to provide the
essential common ground of in
formation in the biological, be
havioral, and clinical sciences
would still be required of all fu
ture physicans. Rut the student
will have elective options or
different ways of meeting these
requirements.
The "core" would be design
ed to put the focus of teaching
on topics that are pertinent to
the education of physicians.
Duplication as well as over- or
underemphasis in certain areas
will be held in check.
The medical school is now
using computers to study the
present input in the education
of medical students. Thus, much
tediousness and repetition might
be eliminated by alternative
courses of study, each with con
siderable flexibility designed for
the needs of different medical
careers.
"Greater flexibility," Dr.
Glaser said, "is necessary be
cause of the undeniable up
grading in the quality of the

Under the flexible plan, stu
dents will be admitted to Stan
ford medical school as candi

traditional classification of
first, second, third, fourth,
and fifth-year student will be
abolished. Each student's
study plans will he developed
in consultation with faculty

Major changes in curriculum
allow students to become phy
sicians in the tlexible atmos
phere of a graduate school have
been approved by the faculty
of the medical school.
The changes are outlined in
a document made public today
by Dr. Robert J. Glaser, vice
president for medical affairs
and dean of the medical school.
Proposed initially by the com
mittee on medical education, the
report calls for efforts "to pro

portunities for studying medi
cine in the context of their own
needs, abilities, and ambitions
than is now possible."
Specifically, the report rec
ommends: 1) redefining the
present "core" curriculum
with increased elective oppor
tunities for satisfying re
quirements in subject areas,
2) allowing students to devel
op highly individualized study
plans and, 3) establishing an
appropriate faculty body to
implement the curriculum
proj>osals by September, 1968.
The new plan, prepared by the
committee under the chairman
ship of Dr. Leßoy A. Pesch, as
sociate dean, Is considered like
ly to draw wide attention in
medical circles, where Stanford's
curriculum is already regarded
as more flexible than most.
In 1959, the Stanford medical
curriculum was completely re
built to improve the education
of the future doctor by spread
ing his studies over five years
instead of four and teaching him
principles rather than mastery
of specific detail.
One of the key elements of
the initial Stanford Plan of Med
ical Education was the recog
nition that there has to be in
dependence and flexibility in the
scheme of medical education.
These two ingredients were pro
vided by the establishment of
a "core" curriculum, which in
cludes essential instruction for
every medical student, with
"free" time for electives.
However, after nearly eight
years of experience, the fac
