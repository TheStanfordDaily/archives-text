# University Answers Black Demands
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Stanford University promised
yesterday to help overcome "ra
cial injustice" in American so
ciety.
Responding quickly to de
mands by black students and
others, President Wallace Sterl
ing issued a statement last night
pledging the "necessary resour
ces of time, thought and mon
ey." As a start, Stanford will:
• Double minority-group en
rollment by 1969-70.
• Double the proportion of
Stanford employees irom mi
nority groups over the noxt year,
and "upgrade such employment
wherever feasible."
• Admit at least ten minority
students next year "who do not
meet minimal academic require
ments. The statement came seven
houis after 70 Black Student
Un'on Members surrounded Pro
vost Richard Lyman on the
stage of Memorial Auditorium
and read a lo ,g list of t'« mands
on black admi isions.
As he took the microphone
from Lyman in the middle of
the provost's speech, black
student Ken Washington
shonted to the capacity audi
ence of 1700 whites, "Put your
money and action where your
mouth is."
Frank Satterwhite read the de
mands to a stunned audience,
asking Lyman to reply to them
at 7 p.m. Tuesdiy ?n in "open
forum" in Tre3idde»\ Then the
black students walked out of
the auditorium. They received a
standing ovation.
That ovation resounded and
grew for the rest of the day.
White students lormod an ad
hoc group to support '.he BSU
<iem«;nds and cir< ulated peti
tions. ASSU President Cesare
Lit ssarenti called a r<.on rally
tuda> in White Plazi. Medical
.school faculty Lyman to
accept the proposals. Otero
house in Wilbur said it would
ask that $5,000 slated for house
improvements be used to help
implement the BSU demands.
Six top administrators met
last night at Sterling's office
to draw up a response. They re
leased the statement at 10 p.m.,
saying "the matter" of the BSU
demands, "not the manner" was
important.
"We call upon the members
of the Black Students Union
to work with us to achieve
these goals and to carry on
a continuing dialogue about
them," the statement says.
University officials would not
commit themselves to attending
the Tresidder meeting today.

But they did invite the black stu
dents to send five representa
tives to a meeting with fac
ulty and staff Thursday at 2
p.m.
The statement was signed by
Sterling and Provost Lyman,
who hours earlier had lamented
the "absolute and dogmatic self
righteousness" shown by the
black students' curt demands
and walkout.
But immediately after the
BSU walkout from the Memorial
Auditorium convocation on
"How Stanford Can Act," Ly
man had said "there is very
much we can readily agree
with," in their demands.
He went on to describe an
increase of one-third to 71
over last year In black stu
dents admitted to the fresh
man class of 1968 69. He re
vealed that for the first time
black applicants had been giv
en "first priority" In financial
aid.
Lyman also told the audience
of plans for a "Human Rela
tions Commission of faculty and
students, with black appoin
tees." Sterling approved the
Commission idea before King's
death, Lyman added.
The Commission plan met one
of the demands listed in the BSU
ten-point program. Last night
Lyman told the Daily that the

Commission would investigate
the March 16 incident involving
black children at Tresidder drug
store, thereby meeting another
of the BSU demands.
In his speech Lyman agreed
that the University should make
special efforts in recruiting mi
nority students to keep their
numbers growing in the student
body.
He defended Stanford's rec
ord in employment, pointing
out that "one-fifth of new em
ployees are from minority
groups." But only 25 of the
171 job applicants in the past
five months were Negro, he
said.
After issuing the University
statement, Lyman stressed that
"This is intended to be a begin
ning, not an end," to Stanford's
response to white racism and
the death of Martin Luther
King.
With those words he echoed
the theme of the six-hour "col
loquium" that filled Memorial
Auditorium with students and
faculty yesterday. Speaker after
speaker demanded the Univer
sity "use white power" to fight
social injustice. Most classes
were cancelled to avoid conflict
with the colloquium.
The University's action was
clearly a direct response to the


DEMANDS — Frank Satterwhite presents and audience In yester
day's Colloquium and Plan For Action: Stanford's Response To
White Racism with the Black Students Union's (BSU) demands.

Lyman, Kenneth Prewltt, visiting professor of political science and
organizer of the colloquium, and Kenneth Arrow, professor of
economics and chairman of the executive committee of the Faculty
Senate.
BSU demands, but it did not
concede most of the detailed
points in the 1,200 word docu
ment.
Prefaced by a scathing attack
on "deception" and "shirking of
responsibility" by the adminis
tration, the demands included
"proportional representation" of
minority groups beginning with
the freshman class of 1969-70.
The University's promise to
double minority-group enroll
ment would mean a possible in
crease from about 150 to 300
students, but it probably would
not equal the BSU demand.
A call for admission of at
lease ten "marginal" minority
students was granted outright
by the University, but without
agreement to the BSU demand
that blacks should choose the
ten students.
(The BSU demands are print
ed on p. 4 of today's Daily.)
Black students were not avail
able for comment on the Uni
versity statement. Earlier, BSU
co-chairman Charles Countee
told the Daily that blacks "have
not yet formulated plans" in
case the administration would
not meet their demands.
The dramatic BSU demon
stration came near the end of
an all-day program planned as
a climax of Stanford's ago
nized reaction to the assassi
nation Thursday of Dr. Mar
tin Luther King.
Earlier speakers, included Pro
fessors Robert Mac A fee Brown,
David Abernethy, Kenneth Ar
row and James Gibbs, a Negro.
After the interruption and
walkout by the BSU, Lyman re
turned to the microphone with
the comment, "The best think I
can do in the tradtions of the
Universiy is to finish my talk."
Later, members of the panel
which Included Lyman criti
cized the black students' ac
tion. Prof. Abernethy called it
"a beautiful illustration of an
almost total breakdown of
communication." He said the
BSU had refused to reveal
their in advance and refused
to be j>art of the panel.
But "the University might
well go along" with the de
mands, Abernethy said.
Earlier Abernethy gave a
speech demanding "real sacri
fices" by Stanford and the na
tion. This "shifting of priorities"
should include "compensatory
discrimination" in favor of hir
ing blacks by Stanford and firms
renting Stanford land. A "rem
edial reading program for

whites" and "sensitivity train
ing" to avoid paternalism is
needed for all Stanford students
and staff, Abernethy said.
Abernethy drew cheers when
he called for Stanford chapters
to give national fraternities two
months to publicly state a pol
icy of nondiscrimination. Other
wise the locals should disaffili
ate, he said. Theta Delta Chi
last night urged Stanford fra
ternities to take this action.
The Memorial Auditorium
happening was filled with dra
matic confrontations.
Lyman criticized the BSU
walkout, asking, "How do you
work toegther with people if
they don't believe you?"
He was met by cries from the
audience, "Give up some pow
er!"
Then Prof.. Prewitt excitedly
asked Lyman, "What's the Uni
versity about? Is it about social
justice? If it's about something
else, this society is going to burn
down."
Lyman replied that the Uni
versity exists to study social
justice and injustice alike. But
it "ought to strive for social
juslce in everything it does."
Religion Prof. Robert Mac-
Afee Brown started and finished
the afternoon session with mov
ing pleas for action and good
faith by all parties.
Before the faculty speeches
and demands, Brown had warn
ed the overflow audience that
"the time is one minute before
midnight."
"The world is just the same
as it was before Dr. King's mur
der; and the world is totally
different since Dr. King's mur
der," said Brown, summarizing
the confused Stanford reaction.
Changes must be made "with
a speed that will seem impos
sible in anticipation but will
be seen in retrospect to have
been barely fast enough to ward
off disaster," he said.
But two hours later, after
the tense confrontations and
angry disputes, Brown said
Lyman shouldn't have been
"put on the spot. We cannot
lems by 24 hour ultima
tums."
"There has got to give and
take," Brown said. "We can't
have conversations with people
who aren't here."
The "Call for Action" panel,
which started at 2 p.m. with a
speech by Brown, was the final
part of a six-hour "Stanford Re
sponse to White Racism" collo
quium in Memorial Auditorium.
In the morning, overflow

crowds watched the CBS docu
mentary, "Remedy for Riots,"
based on the recent report by a
Presidential Commission on Civil
Disorders. Graduate student
Robert Davidson read lengthy
exceprts from a play he has
written, based largely on the
writings of the late Malcolm X.
A 19-page pamphlet on "Insti
tutionalized Racism in America"
was distributed to the audience.
Briefly BSU demands call for:
1. Proportional representation
of minority groups beginning
with the freshman class of 1969-
70.
2 Submission of a report to
the BSU with information about
every black student who is ad
mitted or rejected for the 1968-
69 year.
3. Granting of demands made
last quarter on admissions pro
cedures, including use of BSU
members in recruiting minor
ity students.
4. Admission of at least five
"marginal" black and five "mar
ginal" students from other mi
nority groups next year. The
blacks should be chosen by the
BSU. A tutorial program should
be set up for all minority stu
dents.
5. Vice Provost Robert Rosen

zweig be replaced by a black
chosen with BSU approval to
deal with minority group affairs.
6. "Total commitment" of fi
nancial aid to needy minority
students.
7. Firing of Stanford em
ployees who discriminate. Estab
lishment of a committee to in
vestigate discrimination, with a
majority of members from mi
nority groups.
Immediate action on alleged
firing of a black student by the
language laboratory, and of al
leged discrimination by staff
members of Stanford-in-Britain.
Further investigation of the
March 16 incident involving
black children at the Tresidder
drug store.
8. Consultation with the BSU
before the University takes any
action on the recent report on
minority group admissions by
an SES committee.
9. Active recruitment of mi
nority group faculty. An imme
diate meeting to plan this re
cruitment and new curricula on
black culture.
10. Acceptance of these de
mands and a timetable of imple
mentation at an oepn forum
Tuesday, April 9, at 7p.m. in
