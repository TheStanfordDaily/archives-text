# University Answers Black Demands
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Stanford University promised
yesterday to help overcome "ra
cial injustice" in American so
ciety.
Responding quickly to de
mands by black students and
others, President Wallace Sterl
ing issued a statement last night
pledging the "necessary resour
ces of time, thought and mon
ey." As a start, Stanford will:
• Double minority-group en
rollment by 1969-70.
• Double the proportion of
Stanford employees irom mi
nority groups over the noxt year,
and "upgrade such employment
wherever feasible."
• Admit at least ten minority
students next year "who do not
meet minimal academic require
ments. The statement came seven
houis after 70 Black Student
Un'on Members surrounded Pro
vost Richard Lyman on the
stage of Memorial Auditorium
and read a lo ,g list of t'« mands
on black admi isions.
As he took the microphone
from Lyman in the middle of
the provost's speech, black
student Ken Washington
shonted to the capacity audi
ence of 1700 whites, "Put your
money and action where your
mouth is."
Frank Satterwhite read the de
mands to a stunned audience,
asking Lyman to reply to them
at 7 p.m. Tuesdiy ?n in "open
forum" in Tre3idde»\ Then the
black students walked out of
the auditorium. They received a
standing ovation.
That ovation resounded and
grew for the rest of the day.
White students lormod an ad
hoc group to support '.he BSU
<iem«;nds and cir< ulated peti
tions. ASSU President Cesare
Lit ssarenti called a r<.on rally
tuda> in White Plazi. Medical
.school faculty Lyman to
accept the proposals. Otero
house in Wilbur said it would
ask that $5,000 slated for house
improvements be used to help
implement the BSU demands.
Six top administrators met
last night at Sterling's office
to draw up a response. They re
leased the statement at 10 p.m.,
saying "the matter" of the BSU
demands, "not the manner" was
important.
"We call upon the members
of the Black Students Union
to work with us to achieve
these goals and to carry on
a continuing dialogue about
them," the statement says.
University officials would not
commit themselves to attending
the Tresidder meeting today.

But they did invite the black stu
dents to send five representa
tives to a meeting with fac
ulty and staff Thursday at 2
p.m.
The statement was signed by
Sterling and Provost Lyman,
who hours earlier had lamented
the "absolute and dogmatic self
righteousness" shown by the
black students' curt demands
and walkout.
But immediately after the
BSU walkout from the Memorial
Auditorium convocation on
"How Stanford Can Act," Ly
man had said "there is very
much we can readily agree
with," in their demands.
He went on to describe an
increase of one-third to 71
over last year In black stu
dents admitted to the fresh
man class of 1968 69. He re
vealed that for the first time
black applicants had been giv
en "first priority" In financial
aid.
Lyman also told the audience
of plans for a "Human Rela
tions Commission of faculty and
students, with black appoin
tees." Sterling approved the
Commission idea before King's
death, Lyman added.
The Commission plan met one
of the demands listed in the BSU
ten-point program. Last night
Lyman told the Daily that the

Commission would investigate
the March 16 incident involving
black children at Tresidder drug
store, thereby meeting another
of the BSU demands.
In his speech Lyman agreed
that the University should make
special efforts in recruiting mi
nority students to keep their
numbers growing in the student
body.
He defended Stanford's rec
ord in employment, pointing
out that "one-fifth of new em
ployees are from minority
groups." But only 25 of the
171 job applicants in the past
five months were Negro, he
said.
After issuing the University
statement, Lyman stressed that
"This is intended to be a begin
ning, not an end," to Stanford's
response to white racism and
the death of Martin Luther
King.
With those words he echoed
the theme of the six-hour "col
loquium" that filled Memorial
Auditorium with students and
faculty yesterday. Speaker after
speaker demanded the Univer
sity "use white power" to fight
social injustice. Most classes
were cancelled to avoid conflict
with the colloquium.
The University's action was
clearly a direct response to the


DEMANDS — Frank Satterwhite presents and audience In yester
day's Colloquium and Plan For Action: Stanford's Response To
White Racism with the Black Students Union's (BSU) demands.
