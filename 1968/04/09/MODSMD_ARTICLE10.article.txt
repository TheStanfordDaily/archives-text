## Is King Whitey's Martyr? 
### Robert Stones 
The Reverend Martin Luther
King is dead. Shot down in a
Memphis hotel by an apparent
ly well-organized clique who, by
their act, have reaffirmed the be
lief of Black America that vio
lence is the only answer. But,
in the reams of copy that have
been written about Dr. King's
death, the real tragedy has yet
to be mentioned.
It is somewhat ironic that
Dr. King, the leader of Black
America's non-violent wing has
become the martyr, the rally
ing point for black militants.
But, what is not ironic, what in
fact is very, very sad, is that
Dr. King is going to become a
martyr for White America as
well.
It is sad that Martin Luther
King is going to be blamed for
every riot, every incident of vio
lence, every act of evil disobe
dience that faces this nation in
the long, hot, summer months

which are almost upon us. It
is sad that the death of Dr. King
will be used not only by Black
America, but also by White
America as a justification for
burning, looting, and killing.
Why is it sad? Simply because
in justifying acts of violence
with references to Dr. King's
death, both Black and White
America can overlook the real
reasons behind such acts.
Personally, I would be the last
one to say that America's Black
people don't have a reason to
riot. I think they do, and I
think that many Whites feel
similarly. I don't think that riots
will help solve the problem, but
if that is the only way they see
to accomplish the position in
this society they deserve, what
can we say?
The tragedy of Dr. King's
death, however, is that White
America, or as least part of
White America, is going to be

able to use it to forget the real
reasons that Black America is
being violent. They are going
to be able to say that acts of
violence are being committed
in the memory of Martin Luther
King.
But the riots would have hap
pened anyway. We all have been
expecting them, some resigned
ly, some determined that they
shall not be touched, some per
haps realistically, but unthink
ingly, buying handguns and oth
er items for self defense. But
we have all been expecting them.
We have all been told that this
is the summer that America
will burn.
We have also been told that
the time for talk is past. That

Black America no longer wants
to talk, they want to act. This
is a decision that Black Ameri
ca must make, But, when it is
made, when the die has been
cast for the coming summer, let
us members of White America
not forget the real reasons, the
facts on which Black America
made that decision.
If it must be that riots will
erupt this summer, changing
the calm of city and country
both into battlefield, at least
let us remember what the fight
is all about. Violence was never
Martin Luther King's way, and
meeting violence with violence
should not be his requiem.
My fellow Whiteys, we just
can't get off that easily.
