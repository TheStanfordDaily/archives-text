## Visit The USA 
### 
WASHINGTON—Dear Visitor
From Abroad,
This is your invitation to
visit the USA in 1968, otherwise
known as The Land of Bonnie
and Clyde.
To make it easier for you, we
will answer some of the ques
tions that foreign tourists keep
asking us.
IS IT DANGEROUS T O
VISIT THE UNITED STATES?
Of course not. Americans are
a gentle people who abhor vio
lence. What little there is can
be seen on television or in the
movies—every night. We have
cowboy films, cops and robbers
pictures and children's cartoons.
If that isn't your cup of tea
you can tune in on one of our
news shows. We not only show
people being killed, but villages
being burned, Gls being wound
ed, enemies being tortured or
anything else that suits your
fancy. Of course, these shows
have no effect on Americans
because they know it has noth
ing to do with them.
WHAT SHOULD I WEAR?
American fashions this year
are all modeled after the Bonnie
and Clyde look, and everyone
wants to dress like a gangster.
This trend is tongue in cheek,
because everyone knows we
don't admire gangsters, even
though we all consider Bonnie
and Clyde a gas.
WHAT CAN I BUY IN THE
UNITED STATES THAT I
CAN'T BUY IN MY OWN
COUNTRY?
Guns, for one thing. We have
no laws about buying guns. You
don't even have to go to a store.
You can order them by mail
from newspapers and maga
zines.
You can buy shotguns, rifles,
hand guns, pistols, revolvers
and practically any kind of
weapon you want. Of course,
we only use guns in the United
States for hunting. That's why
the American Congress in its

infinite wisdom won't pass any
gun control laws. They know
anyone who would order a gun
by mail or buy one in a store
would never use it except to
shoot game.
WHAT ABOUT VISITING
AMERICAN CITIES?
It's perfectly safe to visit any
American city in the country,
providing you don't go out after
dark or during certain parts of
the day. The best thing is to ask
your hotel clerk at the desk.
He'll indicate what streets are
safe and when you can visit
them. Americans pride them
selves on law and order and
would never do anything to dis
turb the peace.
WHEN IS THE BEST TIME
TO COME?
Any time is a good time to
visit the United States, with the
possible exception of the long
hot summer which starts in the
middle of March and goes
through October. At this time
people are irritable and not as
friendly toward tourists as they
might be at Christmas time.
WHERE CAN I SEE THE
PRESIDENT?
You can see the White House,
but the President, for security
reasons, doesn't make many
public appearances any more—
at least none that are announced
in advance. No other American
officials are free to travel,
either. But as a tourist, this
shouldn't bother you. After all,
you have a foreign passport.
I hope this answers most of
your questions. So forget your
cares and see Americans at
work and at play. Watch a truly
civilized democracy in action
and meet a people who love
each other and live in harmony.
See for yourself why the
United States is the leader of
the Eree World and an example
to everyone of what you can
do when you have understand
ing, wealth and power.

VISIT THE USA.
WASHINGTON—Dear Visitor
From Abroad,
This is your invitation to
visit the USA in 1968, otherwise
known as The Land of Bonnie
and Clyde.
To make it easier for you, we
will answer some of the ques
tions that foreign tourists keep
asking us.
IS IT DANGEROUS T O
VISIT THE UNITED STATES?
Of course not. Americans are
a gentle people who abhor vio
lence. What little there is can
be seen on television or in the
movies—every night. We have
cowboy films, cops and robbers
pictures and children's cartoons.
If that isn't your cup of tea
you can tune in on one of our
news shows. We not only show
people being killed, but villages
being burned, Gls being wound
ed, enemies being tortured or
anything else that suits your
fancy. Of course, these shows
have no effect on Americans
because they know it has noth
ing to do with them.
WHAT SHOULD I WEAR?
American fashions this year
are all modeled after the Bonnie
and Clyde look, and everyone
wants to dress like a gangster.
This trend is tongue in cheek,
because everyone knows we
don't admire gangsters, even
though we all consider Bonnie
and Clyde a gas.
WHAT CAN I BUY IN THE
UNITED STATES THAT I
CAN'T BUY IN MY OWN
COUNTRY?
Guns, for one thing. We have
no laws about buying guns. You
don't even have to go to a store.
You can order them by mail
from newspapers and maga
zines.
You can buy shotguns, rifles,
hand guns, pistols, revolvers
and practically any kind of
weapon you want. Of course,
we only use guns in the United
States for hunting. That's why
the American Congress in its

infinite wisdom won't pass any
gun control laws. They know
anyone who would order a gun
by mail or buy one in a store
would never use it except to
shoot game.
WHAT ABOUT VISITING
AMERICAN CITIES?
It's perfectly safe to visit any
American city in the country,
providing you don't go out after
dark or during certain parts of
the day. The best thing is to ask
your hotel clerk at the desk.
He'll indicate what streets are
safe and when you can visit
them. Americans pride them
selves on law and order and
would never do anything to dis
turb the peace.
WHEN IS THE BEST TIME
TO COME?
Any time is a good time to
visit the United States, with the
possible exception of the long
hot summer which starts in the
middle of March and goes
through October. At this time
people are irritable and not as
friendly toward tourists as they
might be at Christmas time.
WHERE CAN I SEE THE
PRESIDENT?
You can see the White House,
but the President, for security
reasons, doesn't make many
public appearances any more—
at least none that are announced
in advance. No other American
officials are free to travel,
either. But as a tourist, this
shouldn't bother you. After all,
you have a foreign passport.
I hope this answers most of
your questions. So forget your
cares and see Americans at
work and at play. Watch a truly
civilized democracy in action
and meet a people who love
each other and live in harmony.
See for yourself why the
United States is the leader of
the Eree World and an example
to everyone of what you can
do when you have understand
ing, wealth and power.
