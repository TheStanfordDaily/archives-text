# The 						Washington Merry-Go-Round
## Meany Wants Humphrey To Run 
### Drew Pearson 
WASHINGTON — AFL-CIO
President George Meany has
made a personal appeal to Vice
President Humphrey to
into the Presidential scramble.
If Humphrey will become a can
didate, Meany promised him the
full support of organized labor.
Meany's approach was follow
ed up by phone calls from sev
eral union leaders, who added
their individual pledges.
Several governors, including
Buford Ellington of Tennessee,
William Guy of North Dakota,
and Calvin Rampton of Utah,
have also urged the Vice Presi
dent to run.
President Johnson, however,
did not make an immediate com
mitment to support his Vice
President. On earlier occasions,
the President had spoken to
Humphrey about his intention
to retire, and had vowed to use
his influence at the Democratic
convention to get the nomina
tion for Humphrey. The Vice
President had always respond
ed by urging Johnson not to re
tire.
On Sunday morning, the Pres
ident dropped by the Humphrey
apartment and read the speech
he intended to deliver, includ
ing the momentous announce
ment of his withdrawal. Again,
the Vice President tried to per
suade the President to change
his mind. Later in the day, LBJ
telephoned Humphrey to say
that he decision was irrevoc
able.
No plans were discussed, how
ever, to help Humphrey get the
nomination. The Vice President
kept a previous engagement in
Mexico City and returned to a

waiting press eager to learn
his intentions.
The inside fact is that the
President will do what he can
in the smoke-filled back rooms
to line up support for Humph
rey. But the question is wheth
er LBJ's backstage maneuver
ing will be enough to stop the
relentless drive of Sen. Robert
Kennedy.
Poor Senate Code
WASHINGTON — On the
question of ethical conduct, the
Senate of the United States has
laid an egg. For two years its
austere and dignified members
have labored mightly over draft
ing a code of conduct, and in
the end they've brought forth
a product riddled with loopholes.
It makes the code drafted by
Rep. Melvin Price, D-111., for
the House of Representatives
look like the Ten Command
ments.
Now that we have a partial
bombing pause over North Viet
nam to examine peace, this
might be a good time to take a
partial Presidential jockeying
pause to examine ethical con
duct.
The real truth is that the Sen
ate never had much stomach for
policing itself. As a result, there
was a lot of inner indignation
over the idea of submitting Sen
ate integrity to outside inspec
tion. Senators always operated
on the assumption that all of
them were honorable men. It
was the House of Rpresenta
tives, which had to go hat in
hand to collect campaign funds
every two years, that should
be looked upon with suspicion.
However, when Bobby Baker,

the Senate Secretary, made
headlines over influence ped
dling, and Sen. Tom Podd, P-
Conn., was finally censured, Sen
ate elders felt the need to quiet
the public storm that followed.
The code which they adopted
may read well on paper, but
here is a careful diagnosis of
what it actually contains:
The Loopholes
1. It permits "slush funds" of
the sort that Richard Nixon
made famous. As a Senator, Nix
on hit up California business
men for contributions to help
pay his personal expenses. The
total was $18,000, and the pub
lic outcry almost forced Nixon
off the Republican ticket in
1952. Had it not been for a
dramatic TV broadcast, he would
have been dropped. Now, how
ever, the Senate has legitimatiz
ed similar Nixon funds.
2. Under the code, Senators
must file sealed reports of their
outside income, gifts and hold
ings. But they can put their
holdings in the names of their
wives, who, in turn, are free to
accept mink coats and deep
freezers without making even
a secret disclosure. Thus, the
Senate has left the door wide
open for a repetition of the mink
coat and deep-freeze scandals of
the Truman administration.
3. The secret-disclosure provi
sion requires Senators to re
port all legal fees above $1,000.
But there is nothing to prevent
a Senator from accepting, with
out disclosure, all the $999 fees
he can stash away. Presumably,
he could even accept several

separate $999 payments from
the same client, provided that
they were billed for different
services.
4. Under the code, Senators
and their aides would not be re
quired to disclose contributions
or honorariums received, if they
were under $300. This would
legitimize the practice of Ber
nard Goldfine, of vicuna-coat
scandal fame, who passed out
$100 contributions to Senate
friends.
Finally, the Senate rejected
for the third time in a year a
move to require full public dis
closure of outside income and
holdings. This was despite the
fact that transgressions of
Baker and Dodd have dramatiz
ed the need for turning the sun
light on the shady side of Capi
tol Hill.
Senators have a tendency to
look upon themselves as distinct
from lesser human beings. This
was expressed by the Senate
Ethics committee, which de
clared in its official report: "A
Senator is extended extraordi
nary measure of trust and con
fidence not given to ordinary
members of society."
Dodd's former administrative
assistant, James Boyd, has writ
ten a book providing the most
revealing glimpse of the Senate's
double standard. The book,
Above the Law, is fascinating
reading.
"A flloek of United States
Senators," wrote Boyd, "sat un
moved over a fellow Senator's
private pocketing of a quarter
of a million dollars in politi-

cal funds, but rose to gusty
heights of invective against the
four employees who violated
'positions of trust' by exposing
that transaction. . . .
Only one Senator, the gnarled,
puckish George Aiken of Ver
mont, had the courage to defy
the club spirit. He told the truth
about the new code of ethics
when he snorted:
"I will not be a party to the
perpetrating of a fraud upon
the American people by mak
ing them think that we are try
ing to purify ourselves, when
we are really making ourselves
look worse."
After his 40 years in Ver
mont politics, the state road in
front of Aiken's modest Putney
farmhouse remains unpaved.
Clearly, the Senate needs more
men like George Aiken, which
is something the voters can
remedy in November.
