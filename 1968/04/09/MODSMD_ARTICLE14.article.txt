## Hot Reaction To Flag Burning 
### 
Editor, The Dally :
I am an American, and I was
deeply angered when I heard
that a group of black students
burned an American flag on
White plaza Friday. It seems to
me that when a man burns an
American flag he is rejecting the
U.S. and all that it stands for.
He is rejecting the principles of
freedom and equality written
into the U.S. constitution.
Granted, in reality these prin
ciples are not universally ap
plied, and there is hate and prej
udice, on the part of both blacks
and whites. Still, the U.S. is gov
erned by these principles and
we have a framework, within
which freedom and equality may
someday be realized.
So, if you want to keep burn
ing American flags, if you want
to riot, and burn our cities, I
guess I can't stop you from try
ing, but when you make your
self an enemy of the United
States, you make yourself my
enemy, and I have no intention
of standing by with my hands
in my pockets, like all those who
stood around and watched you
on White plaza.

Burning Of Flag
Doesn't Change Ideal
Editor, The Daily:
The burning of the American
flag bothers me, because I won
der whether it represented a
rejection of what it ideally
stands for (a declaration of in
dependence, for example) or a
rejection of what white Ameri
can have done living beneath
it. I hope that the latter is the
case.
Should we raise the flag with
a sincere effort to attain its
ideals out of love for each other,
or do we flog it to the ground
out of hatred for what we whites
have done here?
The "400 years" of suppres
sion and assassination of
lives of Negroes by the whites
in America reached its climax
with the murder of a man of

love for us all. It is tragic that
I and millions of other white
people listened thoughtfully to
Dr. King's words only after he
died; but I have the impression
his dream was that black and
white live as brothers, neither
in white terms nor black terms,
but in terms that love requires.
Together we must work to
ward something. After all the
smoke has cleared from burn
ing buildings and burning words,
a little light from the sun under
which we all live may burn
deeply into our hearts. I hope
we all try to love a little, like
Dr. King did.

Editor, The Dally:
In your article April 4 con
cerning Huey Newton and the
relationship between the Black
Panther Party for Self Defense
and the Peace and Freedom
Movement you make some fac
tual errors which deserve cor
rection. You claim that the
Panther-PFM coalition was
shaken by the SNCC-Panther
merger in February.
In fact, as was widely publi
cized, at the State Convention
of the PFM on March 17 the
delegates overwhelmingly voted
to support the 10-point program
of the Panthers and endorsed
a formal coalition between the
two organizations. The Panthers

supported continued black mem
bership in the PFM and in fact
the PFM senatorial candidate
Paul Jacobs was nominated by
Eldridge Cleaver of the Pan
thers. The Panthers are now or
ganizing blacks for PFM in
Oakland and if Oakland stays
cool this summer it will be be
cause the black militant has
found a way to electoral politics.
We in the PFM see no evi
dence that even middle class
white membership is being di
luted as a result of our support
of black militancy. On the con
trary there are beginning to be
increasing numbers who come
to us saying that we are the
only political movement which
addresses the real issues of
ghetto repression.
No candidate of any other pol
itical party has yet made a clear
affirmative statement on even
the issues posed by the Kerner-
Lindsay report on civil disorder.
All our candidates are pledged
to bring these ugly truths be
fore the people.

Perhaps the death of Dr. Mar

tin Luther King may now move
the U.S. Congress to consider a
little legislation to cool the tem
pers of the black people, but no
more than that; now a sense of
urgency pervades the govern
ment and everyone knows that
any further action will be
shelved when normalcy tempo
rarily returns.
Why now? This frustrating
sense of urgency has always
been with you, and the situation
has always been urgent. Dr.
King dedicated his life to this
sense of urgency, yet it is sad
that this slumbering white so
ciety can only feel it with his
death. Many relatively unknown
black people have been slaught
ered the same way Dr. King
died, and many more lives will
be blown out continuously.
It is hoped that any meaning
ful action that the government
takes in alleviating the plight
of its black citizens is not an
other pretentious start made af
ter a crisis. The majority of peo
ple in this country has to shirk
off this crisis-orientation which
leads to unfinished business, fiz
zling emotions and self-purga
tory by the sheer act of putting
on a cloak of guilt.
A groat black leader has been
irretrievably snuffed out in this
'Great Society,' and any eulogies
on our part are almost trite.

supported continued black mem

Eldridge Cleaver of the Pan

Perhaps the death of Dr. Mar

tin Luther King may now move
the U.S. Congress to consider a
little legislation to cool the tem
pers of the black people, but no
more than that; now a sense of
urgency pervades the govern
ment and everyone knows that
any further action will be
shelved when normalcy tempo
rarily returns.
Why now? This frustrating
sense of urgency has always
been with you, and the situation
has always been urgent. Dr.
King dedicated his life to this
sense of urgency, yet it is sad
that this slumbering white so
ciety can only feel it with his
death. Many relatively unknown
black people have been slaught
ered the same way Dr. King
died, and many more lives will
be blown out continuously.
It is hoped that any meaning
ful action that the government
takes in alleviating the plight
of its black citizens is not an
other pretentious start made af
ter a crisis. The majority of peo
ple in this country has to shirk
off this crisis-orientation which
leads to unfinished business, fiz
zling emotions and self-purga
tory by the sheer act of putting
on a cloak of guilt.
A groat black leader has been
irretrievably snuffed out in this
'Great Society,' and any eulogies
on our part are almost trite.

I am an American, and I was
deeply angered when I heard
that a group of black students
burned an American flag on
White plaza Friday. It seems to
me that when a man burns an
American flag he is rejecting the
U.S. and all that it stands for.
He is rejecting the principles of
freedom and equality written
into the U.S. constitution.
Granted, in reality these prin
ciples are not universally ap
plied, and there is hate and prej
udice, on the part of both blacks
and whites. Still, the U.S. is gov
erned by these principles and
we have a framework, within
which freedom and equality may
someday be realized.
So, if you want to keep burn
ing American flags, if you want
to riot, and burn our cities, I
guess I can't stop you from try
ing, but when you make your
self an enemy of the United
States, you make yourself my
enemy, and I have no intention
of standing by with my hands
in my pockets, like all those who
stood around and watched you
on White plaza.

Burning Of Flag

Editor, The Daily:
The burning of the American
flag bothers me, because I won
der whether it represented a
rejection of what it ideally
stands for (a declaration of in
dependence, for example) or a
rejection of what white Ameri
can have done living beneath
it. I hope that the latter is the
case.
Should we raise the flag with
a sincere effort to attain its
ideals out of love for each other,
or do we flog it to the ground
out of hatred for what we whites
have done here?
The "400 years" of suppres
sion and assassination of
lives of Negroes by the whites
in America reached its climax
with the murder of a man of

love for us all. It is tragic that
I and millions of other white
people listened thoughtfully to
Dr. King's words only after he
died; but I have the impression
his dream was that black and
white live as brothers, neither
in white terms nor black terms,
but in terms that love requires.
Together we must work to
ward something. After all the
smoke has cleared from burn
ing buildings and burning words,
a little light from the sun under
which we all live may burn
deeply into our hearts. I hope
we all try to love a little, like
Dr. King did.

Editor, The Dally :
I am an American, and I was
deeply angered when I heard
that a group of black students
burned an American flag on
White plaza Friday. It seems to
me that when a man burns an
American flag he is rejecting the
U.S. and all that it stands for.
He is rejecting the principles of
freedom and equality written
into the U.S. constitution.
Granted, in reality these prin
ciples are not universally ap
plied, and there is hate and prej
udice, on the part of both blacks
and whites. Still, the U.S. is gov
erned by these principles and
we have a framework, within
which freedom and equality may
someday be realized.
So, if you want to keep burn
ing American flags, if you want
to riot, and burn our cities, I
guess I can't stop you from try
ing, but when you make your
self an enemy of the United
States, you make yourself my
enemy, and I have no intention
of standing by with my hands
in my pockets, like all those who
stood around and watched you
on White plaza.

Burning Of Flag
Doesn't Change Ideal
Editor, The Daily:
The burning of the American
flag bothers me, because I won
der whether it represented a
rejection of what it ideally
stands for (a declaration of in
dependence, for example) or a
rejection of what white Ameri
can have done living beneath
it. I hope that the latter is the
case.
Should we raise the flag with
a sincere effort to attain its
ideals out of love for each other,
or do we flog it to the ground
out of hatred for what we whites
have done here?
The "400 years" of suppres
sion and assassination of
lives of Negroes by the whites
in America reached its climax
with the murder of a man of

love for us all. It is tragic that
I and millions of other white
people listened thoughtfully to
Dr. King's words only after he
died; but I have the impression
his dream was that black and
white live as brothers, neither
in white terms nor black terms,
but in terms that love requires.
Together we must work to
ward something. After all the
smoke has cleared from burn
ing buildings and burning words,
a little light from the sun under
which we all live may burn
deeply into our hearts. I hope
we all try to love a little, like
Dr. King did.

In your article April 4 con
cerning Huey Newton and the
relationship between the Black
Panther Party for Self Defense
and the Peace and Freedom
Movement you make some fac
tual errors which deserve cor
rection. You claim that the
Panther-PFM coalition was
shaken by the SNCC-Panther
merger in February.
In fact, as was widely publi
cized, at the State Convention
of the PFM on March 17 the
delegates overwhelmingly voted
to support the 10-point program
of the Panthers and endorsed
a formal coalition between the
two organizations. The Panthers

supported continued black mem
bership in the PFM and in fact
the PFM senatorial candidate
Paul Jacobs was nominated by
Eldridge Cleaver of the Pan
thers. The Panthers are now or
ganizing blacks for PFM in
Oakland and if Oakland stays
cool this summer it will be be
cause the black militant has
found a way to electoral politics.
We in the PFM see no evi
dence that even middle class
white membership is being di
luted as a result of our support
of black militancy. On the con
trary there are beginning to be
increasing numbers who come
to us saying that we are the
only political movement which
addresses the real issues of
ghetto repression.
No candidate of any other pol
itical party has yet made a clear
affirmative statement on even
the issues posed by the Kerner-
Lindsay report on civil disorder.
All our candidates are pledged
to bring these ugly truths be
fore the people.

Perhaps the death of Dr. Mar

the U.S. Congress to consider a
little legislation to cool the tem

more than that; now a sense of
urgency pervades the govern
ment and everyone knows that
any further action will be
shelved when normalcy tempo
rarily returns.
Why now? This frustrating
sense of urgency has always
been with you, and the situation
has always been urgent. Dr.
King dedicated his life to this
sense of urgency, yet it is sad
that this slumbering white so
ciety can only feel it with his
death. Many relatively unknown
black people have been slaught
ered the same way Dr. King
died, and many more lives will
be blown out continuously.
It is hoped that any meaning
ful action that the government
takes in alleviating the plight
of its black citizens is not an
other pretentious start made af
ter a crisis. The majority of peo

off this crisis-orientation which
leads to unfinished business, fiz

to support the 10-point program
of the Panthers and endorsed
a formal coalition between the
two organizations. The Panthers

supported continued black mem
bership in the PFM and in fact
the PFM senatorial candidate
Paul Jacobs was nominated by
Eldridge Cleaver of the Pan
thers. The Panthers are now or
ganizing blacks for PFM in
Oakland and if Oakland stays
cool this summer it will be be
cause the black militant has
found a way to electoral politics.
We in the PFM see no evi
dence that even middle class
white membership is being di
luted as a result of our support
of black militancy. On the con
trary there are beginning to be
increasing numbers who come
to us saying that we are the
only political movement which
addresses the real issues of
ghetto repression.
No candidate of any other pol
itical party has yet made a clear
affirmative statement on even
the issues posed by the Kerner-
Lindsay report on civil disorder.
All our candidates are pledged
to bring these ugly truths be
fore the people.

Perhaps the death of Dr. Mar

tin Luther King may now move
the U.S. Congress to consider a
little legislation to cool the tem
pers of the black people, but no
more than that; now a sense of
urgency pervades the govern
ment and everyone knows that
any further action will be
shelved when normalcy tempo
rarily returns.
Why now? This frustrating
sense of urgency has always
been with you, and the situation
has always been urgent. Dr.
King dedicated his life to this
sense of urgency, yet it is sad
that this slumbering white so
ciety can only feel it with his
death. Many relatively unknown
black people have been slaught
ered the same way Dr. King
died, and many more lives will
be blown out continuously.
It is hoped that any meaning
ful action that the government
takes in alleviating the plight
of its black citizens is not an
other pretentious start made af
ter a crisis. The majority of peo
ple in this country has to shirk
off this crisis-orientation which
leads to unfinished business, fiz
zling emotions and self-purga
tory by the sheer act of putting
on a cloak of guilt.
A groat black leader has been
irretrievably snuffed out in this
'Great Society,' and any eulogies
on our part are almost trite.

Editor, The Dally :
I am an American, and I was
deeply angered when I heard
that a group of black students
burned an American flag on
White plaza Friday. It seems to
me that when a man burns an
American flag he is rejecting the
U.S. and all that it stands for.
He is rejecting the principles of
freedom and equality written
into the U.S. constitution.
Granted, in reality these prin
ciples are not universally ap
plied, and there is hate and prej
udice, on the part of both blacks
and whites. Still, the U.S. is gov
erned by these principles and
we have a framework, within
which freedom and equality may
someday be realized.
So, if you want to keep burn
ing American flags, if you want
to riot, and burn our cities, I
guess I can't stop you from try
ing, but when you make your
self an enemy of the United
States, you make yourself my
enemy, and I have no intention
of standing by with my hands
in my pockets, like all those who
stood around and watched you
on White plaza.

Burning Of Flag
Doesn't Change Ideal
Editor, The Daily:
The burning of the American
flag bothers me, because I won
der whether it represented a
rejection of what it ideally
stands for (a declaration of in
dependence, for example) or a
rejection of what white Ameri
can have done living beneath
it. I hope that the latter is the
case.
Should we raise the flag with
a sincere effort to attain its
ideals out of love for each other,
or do we flog it to the ground
out of hatred for what we whites
have done here?
The "400 years" of suppres
sion and assassination of
lives of Negroes by the whites
in America reached its climax
with the murder of a man of

love for us all. It is tragic that
I and millions of other white
people listened thoughtfully to
Dr. King's words only after he
died; but I have the impression
his dream was that black and
white live as brothers, neither
in white terms nor black terms,
but in terms that love requires.
Together we must work to
ward something. After all the
smoke has cleared from burn
ing buildings and burning words,
a little light from the sun under
which we all live may burn
deeply into our hearts. I hope
we all try to love a little, like
Dr. King did.

According to The Dally, fra
ternities spent $10,000 on parties
this weekend. Will they and the
rest of the Stanford: community
now join together arid raise that
sum or more for scholarships
for underprivileged students to
come to Stanford next year as
a living mpmorial to Dr. King?

Peace And Freedom
Attracts More Whites
Editor, The Dally:
In your article April 4 con
cerning Huey Newton and the
relationship between the Black
Panther Party for Self Defense
and the Peace and Freedom
Movement you make some fac
tual errors which deserve cor
rection. You claim that the
Panther-PFM coalition was
shaken by the SNCC-Panther
merger in February.
In fact, as was widely publi
cized, at the State Convention
of the PFM on March 17 the
delegates overwhelmingly voted
to support the 10-point program
of the Panthers and endorsed
a formal coalition between the
two organizations. The Panthers

supported continued black mem
bership in the PFM and in fact
the PFM senatorial candidate
Paul Jacobs was nominated by
Eldridge Cleaver of the Pan
thers. The Panthers are now or
ganizing blacks for PFM in
Oakland and if Oakland stays

cause the black militant has
