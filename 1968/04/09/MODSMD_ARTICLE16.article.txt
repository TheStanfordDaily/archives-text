# Kennedy Students Reply To Editorial

(On April 4 Tlie DAILY en
dorsed Sen. Kugene McCarthy.
The local Kennedy organization
entitles their reply, "Clean Gene
and Bad Bobby: A Second
Look.")
There is a sickness in Ameri
ca today. The violence and tur
moil of the past few days should
have proved that to anyone who
didn't already know it. The time
has come for positive leadership
in the areas of civil rights and
urban poverty. If such leader
ship is not forthcoming, this na
tion may in all likelihood tear
itself asunder. The academic
community, if it is going to have
any relevance to the problems
of society and to the solution of
those problems, has got to come
to grips with the realities of
American politics.
The reward for taking strong
and controversial stands is often
being branded an "opportunist."
The result of political effective
ness is often the charge of "ruth
lessness." Qualities such as
idealism and dedication, it would
seem, are reserved for the unini
tiated and those unsullied by in
volvement. If we hope to accom
plish anything within the frame
work of the political system, we
have got to rid ourselves of this
irrational prejudice against poli
tics—the formula that success
equals unworthiness.
Last Thursday the Daily took
a long hard editorial look at the
candidates. There was Robert F.
Kennedy, the man who as At
torney General did more than
any other white man in America
for civil rights, a distinction
which incidently brought down
upon him the wrath of white
suburbia—that backlash which
he has condemned as "wrong,
shameful, immoral and self-de
feating."
Robert F. Kennedy, the man
who repeatedly antagonized one
of America's most powerful in
terest groups, organized labor,
by his determined prosecution of
labor racketeering a la Jimmie
Hoffa. Robert F. Kennedy, the
United States Senator who, in
1965, drew the charge that he
was "close to treason" from
Barry Goldwater for his criti
cism of the administration's
Vietnam policy, his support for
student dissenters, and his pro
posal that the National Libera
tion Front be given a share of
the power in South Vietnam as
the best hope for a negotiated
settlement.
The Daily looked at this Rob
ert F. Kennedy and concluded,
"We have no reason to believe
(he) would sacrifice his political
future for anything."
But the Daily did not despair
of America's salvation. There
was a man who "has shown a
rare dedication to his ideals and
a gratifying capacity for ignor
ing his personal future. . . ." The
long and undistinguished career
of Senator Eugene McCarthy
proved beyond a doubt that it
was possible to be a politician
and still refrain from stepping
on toes.

McCarthy has authored few
major bills in his IS years in
Congress. Most of his original
proposals have been technical
amendments to pending legisla
-lion. In contrast to the formida
ble 1 public record of achieve
ment which Robert Kennedy has
achieved in the past eight years,
Senator McCarthy considers his
efforts in behalf of the 1964 tax
reduction and reform bill "my
most important achievements in
the Senate. (Congressional Quar
terly, CANDIDATES 1968, p.
191).
Until very recently, not only
Senator McCarthy but the whole
nation had a "gratifying capaci
ty for ignoring" his political ca
reer.
McCarthy doesn't have a bad
record, he just doesn't have
much of a record at all. General
ly responsive to civil rights, Mc-
Carthy's record is nonetheless
somewhat spotty — he voted
AGAINST an amendment to the
1965 Voting Rights Act which
would have banned poll taxes as
a precondition to registering or
voting. He is certainly no match
for Senator Kennedy when it
comes to achievement in the vi
tal area of civil rights—or any
other area for that matter.
Which "we" is it that needs
McCarthy? The Daily could
only have meant the literal "we"
—predominantly white, upper
middle class Stanford students.
It's a sad state of affairs when
the Stanford academic commu
nity finds itself aligned with su
burbia. If we are not going to
remain irrelevant to American
society we must divest ourselves
of the delusion that honesty is
equated with non-involvement.
The academic community must
not turn its back on men who
have chosen the path of politi
cal involvement.
Senator Kennedy is such a man
—he has earned your support.
