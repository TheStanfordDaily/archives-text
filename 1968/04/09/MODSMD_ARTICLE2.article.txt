# SES Committee Reports Advising Has Low Status

### DAN SNELL 
The report of the Study of
Education Committee on Ad
vising and Counseling, reprint
ed in full on pages five and six
of today's Daily, calls for "the
alteration of perspectives" to
make advising of students a
more important part of the Uni
versity.
The nine-member student-fac
ulty group, chaired by Edwin
Good, associate professor of re
ligion, will hold hearings this
afternoon, 7 to 9 p.m., and to
morrow evening, 4 to 6 p.m. In
room 143 of the Undergraduate
Library. Those interested in
making presentations at the
hearings may phone extension

Advising does not have much
status among the faculty, the
committee notes, but it rejects
financial bonuses for faculty ad
vising and can determine no way
to evaluate advising so that it
could be used to help determine
qualifications for faculty tenure.
"The committee believes that
advising will be able to play a
role in the status and reward
system only if the faculty be
comes so committed to the ad

vising function (which, for the
committee, is integral to the
educational function) that the
very commitment produces a
means of reward," the report,
subtitled "The Humanity of the
University," says.
Graduate students, who will
be the future professors, are
not given enough instruction
in teaching or in advising, ac
cording to the committee.
A "University Humane Offi
cer" with the rank of associate
provost should be appointed to
oversee advising at Stanford,
the committee says. In order
to recruit new advisers and
check up on old ones, this officer
must "command the respect and
attract the cooperation of the
faculty."
The committee outlines its
view of the adviser as an "aca
demic advocate" for the student,
with "some kind of common
bond, beyond the routine," with
the student.
The committee suggests that
academic interest could continue
to be the common bond linking
adviser and advisee, but men
tioned the Trancos House ex
periment, in which a residence

director, sponsors, tutors, and a
team of faculty advisers work
closely together in a residence
oriented advising program as an
other possible model for advis
ing.
The committee supports a sys
tem in which a student could
choose his own adviser. But the
adviser need not be in the stu
dent's major department, as long
as he is informed of the require
ments the student must meet.
Graduate student advising
falls down in some depart
ments, according to the com
mittee, with regard to orient
ing new students to the Uni
versity, giving students voca
tional advise, and informing
students about "useful train
ing obtainable on a regular
basis in other departments."
"A stronger administrative
surveillance of graduate advis
ing might help to overcome the
deficencies of individual depart
ments," the report says.
Transfer students, foreign stu
dents, and members of minority
groups should be given special
programs of advising and tu
toring, according to the com
mittee.

Taking into account advising
on both graduate and undergrad
uate levels in figuring the aver
age ratio of advisees to advisers,
the committee says that only
39 per cent of General Studies
advisers come from the School
of Humanities and Sciences
which can expect to enroll about
80 per cent of the undergradu
ates as majors.
The report supported the con
tinuance of informal advising,
and lauded the efforts to pro
duce a Course Review, "to ap
pear regularly, with co-opera
tion and financial assistance
from the University but without
administrative control."
Surveying the recent exper
iments with having upper divi
sion students advise other un
dergraduates, the committee
said student advising had not
been given a long enough
test to judge by It. The com
mittee "exhorts departments
and schools to keep trying to
find ways of taking advantage
of students' advising abilities."
The committee report sug
gests that the Courses and De
grees bulletin be expanded and
published later than it is now so
that it can be more accurate.
With an expanded Information
Bulletin, including information
on student organizations, the
Time Schedule could be reduced
to "no more than a supplement
to Courses and Degrees, accord
ing to the report.
Although it found the psycho
logical counseling services of the
University generally adequate,
the committee called for larger
staffs in the Counseling and
Testing Center at Cowell Health
Center.
The Placement Service could
become an enlarged Career Gui
dance Center, the committee sug
gests. "This change would put
job interviews in perspective as
aspects of a more thorough in
vestigation by the individual of
his wishes and talents for a
career."

uate levels in figuring the aver
age ratio of advisees to advisers,
the committee says that only
39 per cent of General Studies
advisers come from the School
of Humanities and Sciences
which can expect to enroll about
80 per cent of the undergradu
ates as majors.
The report supported the con
tinuance of informal advising,
and lauded the efforts to pro
duce a Course Review, "to ap
pear regularly, with co-opera
tion and financial assistance
from the University but without
administrative control."
Surveying the recent exper
iments with having upper divi
sion students advise other un
dergraduates, the committee
said student advising had not
been given a long enough
test to judge by It. The com
mittee "exhorts departments
and schools to keep trying to
find ways of taking advantage
of students' advising abilities."
The committee report sug
gests that the Courses and De
grees bulletin be expanded and
published later than it is now so
that it can be more accurate.
With an expanded Information
Bulletin, including information
on student organizations, the
Time Schedule could be reduced
to "no more than a supplement
to Courses and Degrees, accord
ing to the report.
Although it found the psycho
logical counseling services of the
University generally adequate,
the committee called for larger
staffs in the Counseling and
Testing Center at Cowell Health
Center.
The Placement Service could
become an enlarged Career Gui
dance Center, the committee sug
gests. "This change would put
job interviews in perspective as
aspects of a more thorough in
vestigation by the individual of
his wishes and talents for a
career."
The report of the Study of
Education Committee on Ad
vising and Counseling, reprint
ed in full on pages five and six
of today's Daily, calls for "the
alteration of perspectives" to
make advising of students a
more important part of the Uni
versity.
The nine-member student-fac
ulty group, chaired by Edwin
Good, associate professor of re
ligion, will hold hearings this
afternoon, 7 to 9 p.m., and to

Advising does not have much
status among the faculty, the
committee notes, but it rejects
financial bonuses for faculty ad
vising and can determine no way
to evaluate advising so that it
could be used to help determine
qualifications for faculty tenure.
"The committee believes that
advising will be able to play a
role in the status and reward
system only if the faculty be
comes so committed to the ad

vising function (which, for the
committee, is integral to the
educational function) that the
very commitment produces a
means of reward," the report,
subtitled "The Humanity of the
University," says.
Graduate students, who will
be the future professors, are
not given enough instruction
in teaching or in advising, ac
cording to the committee.
A "University Humane Offi
cer" with the rank of associate
provost should be appointed to
oversee advising at Stanford,
the committee says. In order
to recruit new advisers and
check up on old ones, this officer
must "command the respect and
attract the cooperation of the
faculty."
The committee outlines its
view of the adviser as an "aca
demic advocate" for the student,
with "some kind of common
bond, beyond the routine," with
the student.
The committee suggests that
academic interest could continue
to be the common bond linking
adviser and advisee, but men
tioned the Trancos House ex
periment, in which a residence

director, sponsors, tutors, and a
team of faculty advisers work
closely together in a residence
oriented advising program as an
other possible model for advis
ing.
The committee supports a sys
tem in which a student could
choose his own adviser. But the
adviser need not be in the stu
dent's major department, as long
as he is informed of the require
ments the student must meet.
Graduate student advising
falls down in some depart
ments, according to the com
mittee, with regard to orient
ing new students to the Uni
versity, giving students voca
tional advise, and informing
students about "useful train
ing obtainable on a regular
basis in other departments."
"A stronger administrative
surveillance of graduate advis
ing might help to overcome the
deficencies of individual depart
ments," the report says.
Transfer students, foreign stu
dents, and members of minority
groups should be given special
programs of advising and tu

the committee says. In order
to recruit new advisers and
check up on old ones, this officer
must "command the respect and
attract the cooperation of the
faculty."
The committee outlines its
view of the adviser as an "aca
demic advocate" for the student,
with "some kind of common
bond, beyond the routine," with
the student.
The committee suggests that
academic interest could continue
to be the common bond linking
adviser and advisee, but men
tioned the Trancos House ex
periment, in which a residence

director, sponsors, tutors, and a
team of faculty advisers work
closely together in a residence
oriented advising program as an
other possible model for advis
ing.
The committee supports a sys
tem in which a student could
choose his own adviser. But the
adviser need not be in the stu
dent's major department, as long
as he is informed of the require
ments the student must meet.
Graduate student advising
falls down in some depart
ments, according to the com
mittee, with regard to orient
ing new students to the Uni
versity, giving students voca
tional advise, and informing
students about "useful train
ing obtainable on a regular
basis in other departments."
"A stronger administrative
surveillance of graduate advis
ing might help to overcome the
deficencies of individual depart
ments," the report says.
Transfer students, foreign stu
dents, and members of minority
groups should be given special
programs of advising and tu
toring, according to the com
mittee.

Taking into account advising
on both graduate and undergrad
uate levels in figuring the aver
age ratio of advisees to advisers,
the committee says that only
39 per cent of General Studies
advisers come from the School
of Humanities and Sciences
which can expect to enroll about
80 per cent of the undergradu
ates as majors.
The report supported the con
tinuance of informal advising,
and lauded the efforts to pro
duce a Course Review, "to ap
pear regularly, with co-opera
tion and financial assistance
from the University but without
administrative control."
Surveying the recent exper
iments with having upper divi
sion students advise other un
dergraduates, the committee
said student advising had not
been given a long enough
test to judge by It. The com
mittee "exhorts departments
and schools to keep trying to
find ways of taking advantage
of students' advising abilities."
The committee report sug
gests that the Courses and De
grees bulletin be expanded and
published later than it is now so
that it can be more accurate.
With an expanded Information
Bulletin, including information
on student organizations, the
Time Schedule could be reduced
to "no more than a supplement
to Courses and Degrees, accord
ing to the report.
Although it found the psycho
logical counseling services of the
University generally adequate,
the committee called for larger
staffs in the Counseling and
Testing Center at Cowell Health
Center.
The Placement Service could
become an enlarged Career Gui
dance Center, the committee sug
gests. "This change would put
job interviews in perspective as
aspects of a more thorough in
vestigation by the individual of
his wishes and talents for a
career."
The report of the Study of
Education Committee on Ad
vising and Counseling, reprint
ed in full on pages five and six
of today's Daily, calls for "the
alteration of perspectives" to
make advising of students a
more important part of the Uni
versity.
The nine-member student-fac
ulty group, chaired by Edwin
Good, associate professor of re
ligion, will hold hearings this
afternoon, 7 to 9 p.m., and to
morrow evening, 4 to 6 p.m. In
room 143 of the Undergraduate
Library. Those interested in
making presentations at the
hearings may phone extension

Advising does not have much
status among the faculty, the
committee notes, but it rejects
financial bonuses for faculty ad
vising and can determine no way
to evaluate advising so that it
could be used to help determine
qualifications for faculty tenure.
"The committee believes that
advising will be able to play a
role in the status and reward
system only if the faculty be
comes so committed to the ad

vising function (which, for the
committee, is integral to the
educational function) that the
very commitment produces a
means of reward," the report,
subtitled "The Humanity of the
University," says.
Graduate students, who will
be the future professors, are
not given enough instruction
in teaching or in advising, ac
cording to the committee.
A "University Humane Offi
cer" with the rank of associate
provost should be appointed to
oversee advising at Stanford,
the committee says. In order
to recruit new advisers and
check up on old ones, this officer
must "command the respect and
attract the cooperation of the
