# Black Student Union Presents Demands
## 
### Text of statement yesterday by Black Student Union 
Stanford University is guilty
of denying equal education op
portunities to minority group
members of the local commu
nity, the State of California, and
the nation. This prestigious in
stitution of higher learning has
maintained and wants to per
petuate education inequality
through its selective admissions
procedures.
The Black Student Union
will no longer tolerate such
inequality and demands that
Stanford University revise its
operational policies.
Recent negotiations for the
purpose of instituting change
have resulted in token, symbol
ic acts which do not meet the
education needs of currently en
rolled or systematically reject
ed minority group members.
Administrative officials have
presented false information, in
consistent reports, and have
completely misrepresented a sup
posed non-discriminatory uni
versity policy.
We have been told that Stan
ford University has no maxi
mum quota system for minority
group members. We have infor
mation which suggests the con
trary.
We have been told that one
of the major problems (per
haps the major problem) of
Stanford University is minor
ity group education. Yet we
have been led to believe that
operating funds — including
those typically allocated on
the basis of institutional pri
orities — are NOT available
for this purpose.
Although an administrative

officer has partial responsibility
for minority group affairs, he
has no operating fund? for re
lated educational programs.
We have been told that the
hlack students denied admission
for the 1907-68 academic year
were rejected because Stanford
University did not have the
funds to finance their education.
However, personnel of the Fi
nancial Aid Office have assured
us that the duties of the Admis
sions Office are separate from
those of the Financial Aid Of
fice. Moreover, we were inform
ed that the Financial Aid Office
considers requests only after a
student has been admitted.
We have been told that the
recommendations of a Black
Student Union proposal submit
ted during the winter quarter of
the current academic year are
legitimate, but that the Univer
sity will not act to redress the
existing wrongs. (These recom
mendations called for (1)
changes in admissions proce
dures to lessen discrimination
against minority students; (2)
starting a tutorial program to
assist minority students already
at Stanford; and (3) establish
ment of a library on the herit
age of the Afro-American; and
(4) recruitment of black profes
sors to teach courses in Afro-
American culture.)
The Black Student Union re
bukes and administration for
attempted deception and In
dicts Stanford University for
shirking its responsibility for
minority group education.
Accordingly, since the present
"unofficial" quota system is in
adequate and the current selec
tive admissions policies are in

herently discriminatory, the
Black Student Union demands:
1. The proportional represen
tation of minority group mem
bers be implemented beginning
with the freshman class of the
1909-70 academic year to in
clude recruitment of a substan
tial number of minority students
from East Palo Alto, East Men
lo Park, Santa Clara County
and San Mateo County; that
each subsequent freshman class
be comprised of a proportional
number of black students, Mexi
can-Americans, American In
dians, and other minority group
members; and active recruit
ment of minority students be in
itiated at junior colleges.
2. That a report be submit
ted to the Black Student Union
which includes information
about the admission and rejec
tion of all minority students
for the 1968-69 academic year;
that this report contain com
parative data for whites in
cluding high school GPA, SAT
scores, and financial resour
ces; and that reasons for re
jection of all minority stu
dents be explicitly stated
therein.
We trust that the report
will contain no deceptive or
false information.
3. That the admissions pro
cedures outlined in the Black
Student Union Proposal sub
mitted to the Provost during the
Winter Quarter of the current
year be implemented "with all
deliberate speed."
Recognizing that the cultural
tools of white America are basic
ally limited and inadequate for
dealing intelligently and cre
atively with Afro-Americans,

Mexican • Americans, American
Indians, and other minority
groups, we further demand that
representatives of the Black Stu
dent Union assist in the recruit
ment of minority students on
a work-study basis; and that a
recruitment pamphlet prepared
by the Black Student Union be
financed by the university and
sent to high schools for coun
selor and student usage.
4. That at least five "margi
nal" black students and five
"marginal" students from oth
er minority groups be admit
ted to Stanford University for
the 1968-69 academic year;
that the Black Student Union
be given exclusive jurisdiction
in the selection and recruit
ment of the five black stu
dents; and that a tutorial pro
gram similar to that outlined
In the original Black Student
Union Proposal be implement
for ALL minority students on
the campus.
Furthermore that no "mar
ginal" student be required to
take admissions tests for se
lective admission purposes;
that they be given a one-year
period in which to adjust to
the University environment;
and that the admissions offi
cer and Black Student Union
representative be allowed to
determine whether these stu
dents are to continue.
5. That Dr. Robert Rosen
zweig, Vice-Provost in charge of
minority group affairs, be dis
missed from these duties and re
placed with a full-time, black
administrator to be selected with
the approval of the Black .Stu
dent Union; that this individual
be given a substantial budget

to implement relevant educa
tional programs for minority
members; and that all major
decisions effecting any minority
groups be subject to the ap
proval of the minority group
members.
6. That, in the area of fi
nancial aids, stress be put on
grants as opposed to scholar
ships; that Stanford Univers
ity seek Federal funds for
minority group programs;
that grades be excludod as a
factor in determining finan
cial aid for minority/poverty
students; that a twelve month
year be considered in assess
ing financial aids, and that
upon acceptance of minority
students the University make
a total committment to them
in non-academic areas as well
as in the academic ones.
7. That the University im
mediately dismiss any employee
engaged in discriminatory acts
while on the job; that the Uni
versity establish a permanent
committee with responsibility
for investigating charges relat
ing to acts of discrimination;
that this committee be composed
of a majority of minority group
members; and that its decisions
be consistent with stated Uni
versity policy and thereby bind

ing upon the university.
Furthermore that this com
mittee investigate pending
charges which the University
has neglected, including the fir
ing of a Black student by Dr.
Peterson, Director of the Lan
guage Laboratory, and the con
tinuing blatant and overt dis
criminatory acts by administra
tors Reeves and Rumbolds of
the Stanford Britain campus.
Because we are an integral
part of the East Palo Alto Black
Community and the East Palo
Alto Day School, we demand
with the Mothers for Equal Ed
ucation:
1. "A full and thorough in
vestigation of ALL of the
facts concerning the inci
dent of March 16, 1968 on
the Stanford campus. This
should include interviews
not only with the Stanford
employees, but with chil
dren and teachers who have
been accused by these em
ployees.
a. The right to confront the
accusers.
b. Dismissal of the employees
involved, if the facts of the
investigation indicate any
black child was wrongfully
searched and/or accused of
stealing.
2. "That Stanford University
advise all of its employees,
who deal with the public, of
its policy regarding treat
ment of visitors to the Stan
ford campus, and especially
of its policy regarding visit
ors belonging to minority
groups. And that it be made
clear to all such employees
that they will be summarily
dismissed for mistreatment
of such groups."
8. That the University not
act upon any SES report re
lating to minority students
without the official approval
of the Black Student Union;
that specific decisions about
the admission of any minority
student be made by a commit
tee which includes at least
one representative of each mi
nority group on the campus,
the faculty advisor of the
Black Student Union, and the
aforementioned full-time black
administrator responsible for

minority group affairs; and
that maximum consideration
be given to assigning minority
students jobs which provide
opiH»rtunities for work In re
lated minority group pro
grams.
The Black Student Union
refuses to recognize minority
group decisions which do not
adhere to the procedures out
lined herein.
9. That the University become
actively engaged in the hiring
of minority group faculty mem
bers; that an immediate meet
ing be called for consideration
of faculty recruitment; that the
university representatives at
this meeting include personnel
responsible for hiring faculty;
and that necessary and suffici
ent steps be taken to introduce
curriculum relevant for minor
ity group members.
10. That the University "pull
itself up by its bootstraps';
that the administration im
mediately consider the afore
mentioned demands; that a
statement of acceptance and
timetable of implementation
be presented to the Black Stu
dent Union at 7:00 P.M., Tues
day, April 9, 1968, In open
forum at Tresidder Union,
Room 270; and that Stanford
University no longer equivo
cate in relation to minority
group education.
