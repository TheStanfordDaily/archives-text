# Text Of SES Report On Advising
## 
### 
This paper is presented to the University
community by the Committee on Advising and
Couast'lint; of the Study of Education at Stan
ford. It is important to say tliat the paper is
intended not as a recommendation for immedi
ate decision hut as some proposals for discus
sion.
Hearings will take place 7 9 p.m. Tuesday
and 4-fi p.m. Wednesday in room 143 of Meyer
Library. Members of the committee will be
present to receive comments on the paper. The
Committee also welcomes written responses to
the SES office, Meyer Library.
Few subjects are so frequently the target of
criticism as advising, few so rarely the object
of constructive suggestion. Widespread agree
ment thai advising is not very well done at
Stanford is equalled by imprecision as to the
problem and feasible solutions. Our realism
breeds cynicism, concluding that we must ac
cept inadequacy.
The Committee on Advising and Counseling
of the Study of Education at Stanford has at
tempted to be realistic but not cynical. Mow
ever unlikely the radical alteration of human
nature may be, the alteration of perspectives
and priorities is well within our reach. The
Committee urges the University's members,
however, that unless assumptions are modi
fied the cynics will he proven right. Foremost
among the assumptions that require adjust
ment is the tacit one that for a faculty mem
ber advising is an extracurricular activity.
This assumption produces hesitance on the
part of many students to consult advisers ex
cept for routine card-signing for fear of "tak
ing up his time," and their resultant complaint
that advising at Stanford is nothing but rou
tine. It produces the perception on the part of
faculty members that advising, except for one's
"own" special (preferably graduate) students,
is a chore to be avoided if possible and to be
disposed of quickly if avoidance is not possible.
It produces among administrators complete ig
norance of inequities in advising loads and the
ignoring of the function of advising in con
siderations of appointment, promotion, and re
ward.
The Committee is not so blindered as to sup
pose that advising is the most important as
pect of university life. But it is sensitive to
the penetration of aspects of advising into al
most everything Stanford does, from admis
sions to residence policy to undergraduate and
graduate curriculum to student services to the
extra-curriculum to placement and vocational
decisions. In what follows we have made some
assumption that bear explication. First, we
suppose that advising has basically to do with
the possibility of significant relations and com
munication between persons, that it sums up
what we intend by our sub-title: "the humani
ty of the University." Second, we assume that
the educational direction Stanford is taking
will entail more advising, not less, on both
graduate and undergraduate levels, and a high
er degree of humanity, not a lower. Third, we
assume that, since no system is perfect, an ar
rangement of advising that allows several
quite different forms and structures of advis
ing to take place will come closer to self-re
newal than a single, potentially rigid system.
The problem, as we presently see it, has
three points of focus: 1. the dissemination to
everyone who needs it of accurate and com
plete information; 2. the availability to anyone
who needs it of competent professional coun
seling; 3. the accessibility to all students of
Interested and personal academic advice.
I. Dissemination
of Information
The story about the man who did not have
enough information to take instruction is rele
vant to the problem of advising. The Commit
tee believes that adequate and accurate infor
mation on most matters regarding the Univer
sity is readily available to those who wish and
need to have it. Ignorance and misinformation
are widespread, however, some of it difficult
to understand.
The information that needs dissemination is
that which makes possible (1) awareness on
the part of faculty and students alike of exact
ly what the University's communal and aca
demic facilities are; (2) access by members of
the University to the various services provid
ed; (3) informed decisions about academic
matters on the part of students.
A great deal of this information can be and
is conveyed in print, but people forget things
when they read them in almost unnumerable
bulletins, pamphlets, brochures, hand-bills, mi
meographed or dittoed sheets, and the like.
The variety is compounded by the fact that
certain published materials are factual in na
ture and others are more propagandists in
tone and purpose, by the fact that some infor
mation is obsolete before it is ever printed and
some is incomplete.
The Committee suggests basic simplification
into two yearly publications. One is an expand
ed version of the present rather slim Informa
tion Bulletin, to serve as a more general hand
book to the University. Here should be de
tailed information on matters not covered in
Courses and Degrees: fees and expenses, resi
dences, relatively permanent organizations and
activities both student and University-wide,
services available to the community such as
those of the Health Service, the Counseling
and Testing Center, the Bechtel International
Center, and others. Also in such a handbook
might be found brief descriptions of the ad
ministrative operation of the University, the
duties and powers of its various officers, and
policies affecting various of its members.
Through such a publication, which should be
routinely in the hands of everyone, both stu
dents and faculty could find how to get help
for all kinds of problems. New students and
new faculty members in particular would, with

its aid, more easily find their ways in the Uni
versity.
Parenthetically, the Committee also sees a
need for a faculty handbook, which would in
form faculty members of such policies of ap
pointment, promotion, tenure, and administra
tive arrangement as are especially relevant to
them.
The Committee wishes, moreover, that Cour
ses and I)egre<>s might he improved. The in
formation in it is frequently obsolete before
the book comes off the press. Might there not
be in the den of someone at Stanford printing
methods that could reduce the lag between
copy deadlines and publication? Would the
improvement of accuracy allowed by an Aug
ust publication date outweigh the advantage
for incoming students of the present May pub
lication? Students and advisers alike now hesi
tate to use Courses and Degrees as a basis
for planning the work of even a single year in
advance. The Committee wonders, then, wheth
er usefulness for planning to those already
here should not have priority over usefulness
for those about to come. In the light of the in
creasing need for advanced academic planning
by students, greater accuracy becomes even
more desirable. Moreover, if Courses and De
grees wore improved and up-dated, the expense
of the quarterly Time Schedule might be re
duced by making it no more than a supple
ment to Courses and Degrees.
All of these publications would bo of im
mense help to advisers and their advisees. The
Committee is of the opinion that the adviser's
function should not be to disseminate informa
tion that the student can more readily receive
otherwise. In saying that, we take full cog
nizance of the high likelihood that anything in
print will be misunderstood, misconstrued, or
misused somewhere by someone. Where the
adviser perceives ignorance, he must, of
course, rectify it—and the student may do the
same. The adviser will function well with an
advisee when both have the necessary infor
mation, for then the adviser is free to advise
instead of merely to inform.
Concomitantly, the Committee believes that
the adviser should be relieved of policing cur
ricular regulations. So much of academic ad
vising is taken up with routine questions about
the fulfillment of requirements (How many
units of Science have you left to take? How
much math? etc.) that time for genuine and
personalized advice is too often at a premium.
The Committee has a hunch, moreover, (1)
that on the whole students know the require
ments in General Studies and in major pro
grams better than their advisers do, and (2)
that students almost always know exactly
where they stand with regard to those require
ments. The Committee wonders about the feas
ibility of computerizing information of these
kinds to enable easy retrieval. If machines can
free us for the improvement of our humanity,
we should by all means use them.
In short, the Committee believes that advis
ing could be far better focussed on advice if
the dissemination of information were both
simplified and improved, so that the adviser
does not have to be a traffic cop of regulations.
11. Availability
of Counseling
For clarity of terminology, we use the term
"counseling" to mean the impartation of help
for problems of a personal sort, not immediate
ly involving the academic, while "advising" is
restricted in this paper to academic advice.
It is certainly the case that a great deal of
counseling in this sense occurs in any commu
nity as large and as complex as Stanford. Most
of it is casual, among close friends, and with
no pretense of professional expertise. This
sort of counseling will happen whether the
institution encourages or discourages it. Any
attempt to structure such relationships is, of
course, doomed to failure. Faculty members
also do a great deal of counseling of this kind.
Though some may criticize the non-profession
al nature of such counseling, that may in itself
bo one of the'strengths of the relationship. At
the same time, situations frequently arise
where professional counseling is needed and
any casual counselor should always have in
mind the possibility of referring someone to
sources of professional aid. The Committee has
not conceived of any way by which faculty or
other such occasional counselors might cus
tomarily be taught how to recognize danger
signals, but they should be aware of an obli
gation to suggest referral.
Nevertheless, sources of professional coun
seling are present at Stanford, and the Com
mittee has been surprise that some members
of the University, both faculty and students,
seem unaware of them. Apart from the coun
seling done in residences < faculty residents,
residence directors, resident assistants, tutors,
and sponsors), which would have to be called
at best semi-professional, counseling done by
campus religious representatives, and that
done in special circumstances by persons in
the Dean of Students' office, the University
maintains two major sources of professional
counseling and a third that might become one.
We refer in the first instance to the Counsel
ing and Testing Center and to the psychiatric
services of the Cowell Health Center, and in
the second instance to the Placement Service.
The Counseling and Testing Center provides
psychological testing of many kinds and both
short-range and long-range psychological coun
seling. The psychiatric staff of the Cowell
Health Center is available for psychiatric con
sultation and some forms of therapy, and pa
tients in need of long-range therapy are re
ferred to psychiatrists in the School of Medi
cine for it.
The Committee has no wish to enter into the
relative merits of these two approaches, be
lieving that both meet various kinds of situ
ations helpfully. The liaison between the Conn

soling and Testing Center and the Cowell
Health reportedly good and getting
better. Such liaison and cooperation should be
encouraged by the University administration.
The fact that a relatively small proportion of
Stanford students uses the counseling services
in these two institutions may be an index of
the community's relatively healthy mental
state. On the other hand, experience h°re and
in other universities would seem to indicate
that there are many more problems than are
actually met by these services. Larger staffs
would doubtless encourage more students with
real problems to seek aid.
It has been rightly observed that while any
person lacks the medical or psychological
help he needs, the job of counseling is not be
ing properly done. One of our faculty col
leagues recently stated that "One student sui
cide per year is one too many," a sentiment
with which no one could quarrel. But preven
tion in the realm of counseling is the most
difficult task. For one thing, it requires the
willing cooperation of the patient or subject.
The continued excellence and improvement
of these two services seems to the Committee,
however, a matter of rather high priority. We
are in a period where the mental strains upon
the age group of Stanford students are great
and on the increase. It is no pampering mood
that leads to the conclusion that professional
aid is needed; it is rather the sense of urgency
that informs higher education, and the wish
that barriers to the best education every stu
dent is capable of absorbing be as far as possi
ble thrown down. We do not believe that the
improvement of, say, the Counseling and Test
ing Center is more important than the im
provement of the faculty. But believing in the
priority of the academic, we wish it to be aided
by the best medical and psychological services
Stanford can afford to render.
We have few specific recommendations,
apart from general improvement—which In
itself ought not to be taken as underhanded
criticism. The first contact with the Counsel
ing and Testing Center ought to make clear
to entering students that genuine personal
counsel may be had there. We are dubious
that the orientation-week testing is a good in
troduction for students, valuable as the re
sults may be for staff research. The counsel
ing function should be made more distinct
from that of legitimate research.
The most difficult question with which the
Committee has long wrestled is how to be
sure that the people who need the help receive
it. To that question, we have no satisfactory
answer. The availability of the services should
b" widely publicized and accurately described.
Every member of the University should know
about them. But the person who refuses to
seek help when he needs it can not, by any
means the Committee has been able to discov
er, be forced to have it.
The Committee notes with satisfaction the
recent improvements in the situation of reli
gious ministries on the campus. Although not
every religious tradition is officially repre
sented, persons desiring counseling of a reli
gious sort have access to a broad range of
clergymen and denominational representatives.
Since campus office space was made available
to denominational representatives, the work
of the Pean of the Chapel and his assistant
and of the University Chaplain has been en
larged by cooperation. To those who doubt the
propriety of the presence of clergymen on a
university campus, the Committee would say
that the day when religious bodies looked on
the ministry to students as a salvage operation
from the godless university is long past. Safe
guards against irresponsibility in this as in
other areas of interest can be established ad
ministratively. Those members of the Univer
sity who find religious counsel helpful and nec
essary can and do seek it out.
By virtue of the fact that Selective Service
is of immediate concern to the majority of
Stanford students, the Committee has consid
ered advising facilities offered regarding the
draft. A National Service Adviser has for
some time been available. The Committee ap
plauds the addition of a counselor on con
scientious objection to the student facilities
available on campus. We anticipate that such
an office will be continued while the question
of the draft is pertinent, and suggest that the
amount of student need for such counsel re
quires the availability of more time than is
now provided. The different natures of the
counseling involved makes it advisable to keep
separate the conscientious objection counsel
ing and National Service advising. Greater co
ordination of the latter with the ROTC offices
and the Placement Service would facilitate the
answering of questions faced by many stu
dents in regard to the options available for
fulfillment of military service. However, the
effectiveness of both offices is hampered at
present by lack of information reaching the
student. Publicizing these services in the hand
book to the University proposed above, and by
whatever means are now available, and the
initiation of orientation sessions with tutors,
residence assistants, and directors may begin
to alleviate this inadequacy.
The Placement Service is kept until last be
cause the Committee believes substantial ex
pansion is possible and desirable. At present
the Placement Service is a means to bring
prospective employees into contact with pros
pective employers and to aid students to re
ceive part-time and summer jobs. With ex
pense (the Committee does not wish to guess
how much* and reorganization, the Placement
Service could become a Career Guidance Cen
ter. This change would put job interviews into
perspective as aspects of a more thorough in
vestigation by the individual of his wishes and
talents for a career. Facilities for aptitude
tests of various kinds would be needed, as well
as staff to process and counsel regarding such
tests. For this purpose, it would he well to
shift the efforts in career counseling now car
ried on by the Counseling and Testing Center
to an expanded Career Guidance Center. Infor

mation on opportunities and requisites for ca
reers of many kinds could conveniently be
gathered and sometimes produced by a Career
Guidance Center, and one might expect to find
in it the current catalogues of graduate and
professional schools across the country.
It has often been remarked that, for all the
Founders' desires that a Stanford education
should fit students for useful pursuits, the ac
cessibility of career counsel is rather slim
h°re. In feeling that the situation bears im
provement the Committee does not imply that
every student should have made a clear voca
tional choice by the end of his senior year. But
students wishing to make informed and ra
tional choices of careers should have access as
early as possible to information and individual
ized counsel regarding the options. A Career
Guidance Center might have the contacts to
place students in part-time and temporary
jobs with persons in careers that the students
are considering, experience which might be
invaluable whether it be positive or negative.
Other methods of gaining insight into vari
ous kinds of professional life may likewise
gain momentum. A proposal now being con
sidered suggests the establishment of sopho
more and higher level courses on the profes
sions, taught from the perspectives of both
the humanities and the social sciences. Such
courses would be informational and descriptive
and in no sense recruitment techniques. Still
other means might be found to make available
for students bases for wise career decisions.
The present admirable advising done by facul
ty members of the School of Medicine with
and for pre-medical students could profitably
be emulated elsewhere. Could not the Schools
of Law, Business, and Education, for example,
provide similar counsel in cooperation with a
Career Guidance Center? The Committee pre
sumes that remuneration occupations will for
some time be necessary for most members of
American society. There is point, therefore, to
the thought that education can be useful, even
though that is far from being the whole point
of education.
111. Academic
Advising
If personal counseling is very largely done
casually and by amateurs, so is academic ad
vising. Most of the advising done at Stanford
is done by one undergraduate to another. The
Committee heartily approves this state of af
fairs at the same time that it is not satisfied
to abandon faculty advising.
Student Advising. Several aspects of under
graduate advising are carried by undergradu
ates. Students get their best information about
the value of specific courses from other stu
dents who have taken them. This is only natu
ral. Faculty members are loath to comment
on their colleagues, for reasons of professional
propriety; students are not. Moreover, faculty
members can talk about courses taught by
their colleagues only by hearsay, where stu
dents can speak at first hand. Such informal
advising is valuable, even though it is fre
quently biased. Sporadic attempts have been
made to bring it usefully into published form,
with such documents as the Course Review,
succeeding the earlier "Scratch Sheet." The
Committee applauds the concept of a student
Course Review as a valuable asset to advising,
and wishes that it might be thorough in its
coverage of courses, representative of a varie
ty of student reactions, and sensitive to stated
aims of professors in courses. Such a review
would also inform professors helpfully about
responses to the courses. The Course Review
ought to appear regularly, with cooperation
and financial assistance from the University
but without administrative control.
A recent experiment in appointing students
as advisers-at-large in their major departments
produced uncertain results. The fault may lie
partially in a lack of information about the
program, in student suspicion that student
advisers would be "administration types," in
students' feelings that they could get as good
advice from their friends—or in any possible
combination of those and other factors. The
Committee is not satisfied that student de
partmental advising is a bad idea, especially
on the basis of one year's experiment in three
departments. It exhorts departments and
schools to keep trying to find ways of taking
advantage of students' advising abilities.
The function of the adviser. We have already
expressed the Committee's suggestion that ad
vising not be simply a matter of policing, of
making sure that the student has information
and is taking the courses he is required to
take. The Adviser's Handbook describes the
goal of advising as bringing "the student to
the point where he can assume a maximum
amount of responsibility for his own academic
program and can make wise decisions on his
own" (p. 12). The Committee wishes to go be
yond that to propose that the adviser be
viewed both by the student and by himself as
the student's academic advocate, the particular
educator who agrees to concern himself with
his advisee's best education. This means prin
cipally that the adviser wishes to help the
student plan an educational career that goes
somewhere, that has coherence and point to it,
rather than being a miscellaneous collection
of requirements and aimless electives. If the
adviser is the student's advocate, however, this
coherence must be a means of enabling the
student's wishes and strengths to be embodied
in his program, not a way for the adviser to
impose his own concepts on the student.
Such a concept would, to he sure, produce
advising that takes more time, for carefully
considering with a student his academic ob
jectives and intellectual curiosities consumes
more time that simply signing his card. But if
such advising is understood and underscored
by tin 1 faculty as integral 1o education, faculty
members may more happily engage in it. It

poses several problems, among which is the
acceptance of advising as a normal aspect of
academic appointment at Stanford. If such
advising will not be done by the faculty, some
one must do it. In the absence of good faculty
advising, a corps of professional advisers
would probably have to be retained to the dam
age of the budget and of the academic exper
tise with which advising ought to be done. On
all counts, the Committee emphatically prefers
faculty advising.
The student's stake in advising. A curious
duality is sometimes to be observed among
students. On the one hand, they firmly ob
ject to be treated as ciphers or as children by
an institution standing in loco parentis. On
the other .they wish the advice of their elders
among the faculty, and this wish is sometimes
Indistinguishable from a desire for a parent
surrogate. Occasionally, when the advice given
is not to an individual's liking, he will pro
test that he is not being respected. We point
this out in part to say that the students' own
view of their stake in advising is not crystal
clear.
Although the student knows more about
himself than any adviser is ever likely to
know, he needs advising because he has not
enough experience of education to know pre
cisely how to join his interests and talents
to a curricular regimen. This observation ap
plies equally, though in different perspectives,
to undergraduates and graduate students. The
student looks to an adviser for guidance in
pursuing an education that will take ad
vantage of his interests and lead him beyond
his own provincial boundaries, at the same
time that it is certifiable by the University as
meeting its standards. The University, of
course, must determine what those standards
are, since it is the body doing the certifying.
The adviser stands toward the student in the
peculiar position of being at once a represen
tative of the University's power of sanction
upon the student (he makes judgments on stu
dents' performance) and and the advocate of
that particula student in the acquisition of his
most effective education.
If the structure of degree requirements on
the graduate level becomes less prescriptive,
the premium on interested advising which
aids the student toward coherence as well as
adventuresomeness will rise. Experience will
count for much in a student's planning, al
though it should not be prescriptively applied.
What is at stake for the student in a more flex
ible under-graduate program is precisely the
humanity of an adviser who is genuinely the
student's educational advocate. If the program
is flexible, advocacy need not consist in find
ing ways to circumvent regulations.
The levels of advising and their problems.
Special and different problems of advising ob
tain for freshmen, transfers, upperclass un
dergraduates and departmental majors, and
graduate students. At the same time, the Com
mittee is convinced of one true observation:
the best advising takes place where advisee
and adviser have some kind of common bond,
beyond the routine. This may be the bond of
the same field of study (the normal pre-set
bond between graduate students and faculty),
some common experience (frequently that the
student has taken the faculty member's
course), or prior acquaintance.
From this standpoint, the advising of fresh
men is the most difficult task, for freshmen
rarely have any existing bond to a faculty
member. It must be established. The Commit
tee has been divided upon several possible ways
to handle freshman advising. That the faculty
should carry the bulk of the advising seems
wise, yet a student's assigned adviser only
rarely turns out to be important or helpful
to him. As the freshman year curriculum now
stands, freshmen rarely come into close con
tact with faculty members, except those al
-most as transient as themselves: English
TA's, Western Civ instructors, lab TA's, and
beginning math and language TA's. The In
crease of Freshman seminars may improve
the range of faculty contact. The plans of
assigning advisers to groups in living units
has been extremely spotty in its effectiveness,
and it suffers from the fact that the advisers
remain abstractly faculty members, rather
than being perceived in their active teaching
roles. Relationships of freshman to faculty
residents or directors of living units, to tutors,
and to sponsors are relatively close, and these
persons in fact do the bulk of freshman ad
vising. The Trancos experiment is one possible
model of freshman advising, where residence
director, sponsors and tutors, and a team of
faculty advisers work closely together. Fresh
man advising ought to aid in the orientation
of the entering student, j.etting him off on the
right foot, proposing seriously that he identify
areas of genuine intellectual interest. Such
advising should prepare the student to find
a permanent academic adviser as he goes.
The Committee is unanimous in suggesting
that advising will become more effective from
all sides if the student ultimately chooses his
own adviser. In fact this frequently happens
now, except that the adviser whom the stu
dent chooses is often not the one responsible
for signing his card. We see the following
arguments in favor of this idea: 1. The stu
dent will most likely choose a faculty mem
ber whom he has seen in action, knows some
thing of his qualities and the "cut of his jib."
2. Such a relationship would underscore the
obligation of both student and adviser for
tion in which the student is interested and
tion In which the student is interested an
which makes coherent academic sense of his
interests and career plans. (The Committee
believes, parenthetically, that changing ad
visers and programs ought to be quite easy,
with no prejudice attached to it.) 3. If the
structure of the freshman year becomes less
prescribed, freshmen will have access to a
broader range of course options and of faculty
members than is now the case and will be
