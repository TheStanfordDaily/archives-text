# Text Of SES Report On Advising
## 
### 
This paper is presented to the University
community by the Committee on Advising and
Couast'lint; of the Study of Education at Stan
ford. It is important to say tliat the paper is
intended not as a recommendation for immedi
ate decision hut as some proposals for discus
sion.
Hearings will take place 7 9 p.m. Tuesday
and 4-fi p.m. Wednesday in room 143 of Meyer
Library. Members of the committee will be
present to receive comments on the paper. The
Committee also welcomes written responses to
the SES office, Meyer Library.
Few subjects are so frequently the target of
criticism as advising, few so rarely the object
of constructive suggestion. Widespread agree
ment thai advising is not very well done at
Stanford is equalled by imprecision as to the
problem and feasible solutions. Our realism
breeds cynicism, concluding that we must ac
cept inadequacy.
The Committee on Advising and Counseling
of the Study of Education at Stanford has at
tempted to be realistic but not cynical. Mow
ever unlikely the radical alteration of human
nature may be, the alteration of perspectives
and priorities is well within our reach. The
Committee urges the University's members,
however, that unless assumptions are modi
fied the cynics will he proven right. Foremost
among the assumptions that require adjust
ment is the tacit one that for a faculty mem
ber advising is an extracurricular activity.
This assumption produces hesitance on the
part of many students to consult advisers ex
cept for routine card-signing for fear of "tak
ing up his time," and their resultant complaint
that advising at Stanford is nothing but rou
tine. It produces the perception on the part of
faculty members that advising, except for one's
"own" special (preferably graduate) students,
is a chore to be avoided if possible and to be
disposed of quickly if avoidance is not possible.
It produces among administrators complete ig
norance of inequities in advising loads and the
ignoring of the function of advising in con
siderations of appointment, promotion, and re
ward.
The Committee is not so blindered as to sup
pose that advising is the most important as
pect of university life. But it is sensitive to
the penetration of aspects of advising into al
most everything Stanford does, from admis
sions to residence policy to undergraduate and
graduate curriculum to student services to the
extra-curriculum to placement and vocational
decisions. In what follows we have made some
assumption that bear explication. First, we
suppose that advising has basically to do with
the possibility of significant relations and com
munication between persons, that it sums up
what we intend by our sub-title: "the humani
ty of the University." Second, we assume that
the educational direction Stanford is taking
will entail more advising, not less, on both
graduate and undergraduate levels, and a high
er degree of humanity, not a lower. Third, we
assume that, since no system is perfect, an ar
rangement of advising that allows several
quite different forms and structures of advis
ing to take place will come closer to self-re
newal than a single, potentially rigid system.
The problem, as we presently see it, has
three points of focus: 1. the dissemination to
everyone who needs it of accurate and com
plete information; 2. the availability to anyone
who needs it of competent professional coun
seling; 3. the accessibility to all students of
Interested and personal academic advice.
I. Dissemination
of Information
The story about the man who did not have
enough information to take instruction is rele
vant to the problem of advising. The Commit
tee believes that adequate and accurate infor
mation on most matters regarding the Univer
sity is readily available to those who wish and
need to have it. Ignorance and misinformation
are widespread, however, some of it difficult
to understand.
The information that needs dissemination is
that which makes possible (1) awareness on
the part of faculty and students alike of exact
ly what the University's communal and aca
demic facilities are; (2) access by members of
the University to the various services provid
ed; (3) informed decisions about academic
matters on the part of students.
A great deal of this information can be and
is conveyed in print, but people forget things
when they read them in almost unnumerable
bulletins, pamphlets, brochures, hand-bills, mi
meographed or dittoed sheets, and the like.
The variety is compounded by the fact that
certain published materials are factual in na
ture and others are more propagandists in
tone and purpose, by the fact that some infor
mation is obsolete before it is ever printed and
some is incomplete.
The Committee suggests basic simplification
into two yearly publications. One is an expand
ed version of the present rather slim Informa
tion Bulletin, to serve as a more general hand
book to the University. Here should be de
tailed information on matters not covered in
Courses and Degrees: fees and expenses, resi
dences, relatively permanent organizations and
activities both student and University-wide,
services available to the community such as
those of the Health Service, the Counseling
and Testing Center, the Bechtel International
Center, and others. Also in such a handbook
might be found brief descriptions of the ad
ministrative operation of the University, the
duties and powers of its various officers, and
policies affecting various of its members.
Through such a publication, which should be
routinely in the hands of everyone, both stu
dents and faculty could find how to get help
for all kinds of problems. New students and
new faculty members in particular would, with

its aid, more easily find their ways in the Uni
versity.
Parenthetically, the Committee also sees a
need for a faculty handbook, which would in
form faculty members of such policies of ap
pointment, promotion, tenure, and administra
tive arrangement as are especially relevant to
them.
The Committee wishes, moreover, that Cour
ses and I)egre<>s might he improved. The in
formation in it is frequently obsolete before
the book comes off the press. Might there not
be in the den of someone at Stanford printing
methods that could reduce the lag between
copy deadlines and publication? Would the
improvement of accuracy allowed by an Aug
ust publication date outweigh the advantage
for incoming students of the present May pub
lication? Students and advisers alike now hesi
tate to use Courses and Degrees as a basis
for planning the work of even a single year in
advance. The Committee wonders, then, wheth
er usefulness for planning to those already
here should not have priority over usefulness
for those about to come. In the light of the in
creasing need for advanced academic planning
by students, greater accuracy becomes even
more desirable. Moreover, if Courses and De
grees wore improved and up-dated, the expense
of the quarterly Time Schedule might be re
duced by making it no more than a supple
ment to Courses and Degrees.
All of these publications would bo of im
mense help to advisers and their advisees. The
Committee is of the opinion that the adviser's
function should not be to disseminate informa
tion that the student can more readily receive
otherwise. In saying that, we take full cog
nizance of the high likelihood that anything in
print will be misunderstood, misconstrued, or
misused somewhere by someone. Where the
adviser perceives ignorance, he must, of
course, rectify itâ€”and the student may do the
same. The adviser will function well with an
advisee when both have the necessary infor
mation, for then the adviser is free to advise
instead of merely to inform.
Concomitantly, the Committee believes that
the adviser should be relieved of policing cur
ricular regulations. So much of academic ad
vising is taken up with routine questions about
the fulfillment of requirements (How many
units of Science have you left to take? How
much math? etc.) that time for genuine and
personalized advice is too often at a premium.
The Committee has a hunch, moreover, (1)
that on the whole students know the require
ments in General Studies and in major pro
grams better than their advisers do, and (2)
that students almost always know exactly
where they stand with regard to those require
ments. The Committee wonders about the feas
ibility of computerizing information of these
kinds to enable easy retrieval. If machines can
free us for the improvement of our humanity,
we should by all means use them.
In short, the Committee believes that advis
ing could be far better focussed on advice if
the dissemination of information were both
simplified and improved, so that the adviser
does not have to be a traffic cop of regulations.
11. Availability
of Counseling
For clarity of terminology, we use the term
"counseling" to mean the impartation of help
for problems of a personal sort, not immediate
ly involving the academic, while "advising" is
restricted in this paper to academic advice.
It is certainly the case that a great deal of
counseling in this sense occurs in any commu
nity as large and as complex as Stanford. Most
of it is casual, among close friends, and with
no pretense of professional expertise. This
sort of counseling will happen whether the
institution encourages or discourages it. Any
attempt to structure such relationships is, of
course, doomed to failure. Faculty members
also do a great deal of counseling of this kind.
Though some may criticize the non-profession
al nature of such counseling, that may in itself
bo one of the'strengths of the relationship. At
the same time, situations frequently arise
where professional counseling is needed and
any casual counselor should always have in
mind the possibility of referring someone to
sources of professional aid. The Committee has
not conceived of any way by which faculty or
other such occasional counselors might cus
tomarily be taught how to recognize danger
signals, but they should be aware of an obli
gation to suggest referral.
Nevertheless, sources of professional coun
seling are present at Stanford, and the Com
mittee has been surprise that some members
of the University, both faculty and students,
seem unaware of them. Apart from the coun
seling done in residences < faculty residents,
residence directors, resident assistants, tutors,
and sponsors), which would have to be called
at best semi-professional, counseling done by
campus religious representatives, and that
done in special circumstances by persons in
the Dean of Students' office, the University
maintains two major sources of professional
counseling and a third that might become one.
We refer in the first instance to the Counsel
ing and Testing Center and to the psychiatric
services of the Cowell Health Center, and in
the second instance to the Placement Service.
The Counseling and Testing Center provides
psychological testing of many kinds and both
short-range and long-range psychological coun
seling. The psychiatric staff of the Cowell
Health Center is available for psychiatric con
sultation and some forms of therapy, and pa
tients in need of long-range therapy are re
ferred to psychiatrists in the School of Medi
cine for it.
The Committee has no wish to enter into the
relative merits of these two approaches, be
lieving that both meet various kinds of situ
ations helpfully. The liaison between the Conn

soling and Testing Center and the Cowell
Health reportedly good and getting
better. Such liaison and cooperation should be
encouraged by the University administration.
The fact that a relatively small proportion of
Stanford students uses the counseling services
in these two institutions may be an index of
the community's relatively healthy mental
state. On the other hand, experience hÂ°re and
in other universities would seem to indicate
that there are many more problems than are
actually met by these services. Larger staffs
would doubtless encourage more students with
real problems to seek aid.
It has been rightly observed that while any
person lacks the medical or psychological
help he needs, the job of counseling is not be
ing properly done. One of our faculty col
leagues recently stated that "One student sui
cide per year is one too many," a sentiment
with which no one could quarrel. But preven
tion in the realm of counseling is the most
difficult task. For one thing, it requires the
willing cooperation of the patient or subject.
The continued excellence and improvement
of these two services seems to the Committee,
however, a matter of rather high priority. We
are in a period where the mental strains upon
the age group of Stanford students are great
and on the increase. It is no pampering mood
that leads to the conclusion that professional
aid is needed; it is rather the sense of urgency
that informs higher education, and the wish
that barriers to the best education every stu
dent is capable of absorbing be as far as possi
ble thrown down. We do not believe that the
improvement of, say, the Counseling and Test
ing Center is more important than the im
provement of the faculty. But believing in the
priority of the academic, we wish it to be aided
by the best medical and psychological services
Stanford can afford to render.
We have few specific recommendations,
apart from general improvementâ€”which In
itself ought not to be taken as underhanded
criticism. The first contact with the Counsel
ing and Testing Center ought to make clear
to entering students that genuine personal
counsel may be had there. We are dubious
that the orientation-week testing is a good in
troduction for students, valuable as the re
sults may be for staff research. The counsel
ing function should be made more distinct
from that of legitimate research.
The most difficult question with which the
Committee has long wrestled is how to be
sure that the people who need the help receive
it. To that question, we have no satisfactory
answer. The availability of the services should
b" widely publicized and accurately described.
Every member of the University should know
about them. But the person who refuses to
seek help when he needs it can not, by any
means the Committee has been able to discov
er, be forced to have it.
The Committee notes with satisfaction the
recent improvements in the situation of reli
gious ministries on the campus. Although not
every religious tradition is officially repre
sented, persons desiring counseling of a reli
gious sort have access to a broad range of
clergymen and denominational representatives.
Since campus office space was made available
to denominational representatives, the work
of the Pean of the Chapel and his assistant
and of the University Chaplain has been en
larged by cooperation. To those who doubt the
propriety of the presence of clergymen on a
university campus, the Committee would say
that the day when religious bodies looked on
the ministry to students as a salvage operation
from the godless university is long past. Safe
guards against irresponsibility in this as in
other areas of interest can be established ad
ministratively. Those members of the Univer
sity who find religious counsel helpful and nec
essary can and do seek it out.
By virtue of the fact that Selective Service
is of immediate concern to the majority of
Stanford students, the Committee has consid
ered advising facilities offered regarding the
draft. A National Service Adviser has for
some time been available. The Committee ap
plauds the addition of a counselor on con
scientious objection to the student facilities
available on campus. We anticipate that such
an office will be continued while the question
of the draft is pertinent, and suggest that the
amount of student need for such counsel re
quires the availability of more time than is
now provided. The different natures of the
counseling involved makes it advisable to keep
separate the conscientious objection counsel
ing and National Service advising. Greater co
ordination of the latter with the ROTC offices
and the Placement Service would facilitate the
answering of questions faced by many stu
dents in regard to the options available for
fulfillment of military service. However, the
effectiveness of both offices is hampered at
present by lack of information reaching the
student. Publicizing these services in the hand
book to the University proposed above, and by
whatever means are now available, and the
initiation of orientation sessions with tutors,
residence assistants, and directors may begin
to alleviate this inadequacy.
The Placement Service is kept until last be
cause the Committee believes substantial ex
pansion is possible and desirable. At present
the Placement Service is a means to bring
prospective employees into contact with pros
pective employers and to aid students to re
ceive part-time and summer jobs. With ex
pense (the Committee does not wish to guess
how much* and reorganization, the Placement
Service could become a Career Guidance Cen
ter. This change would put job interviews into
perspective as aspects of a more thorough in
vestigation by the individual of his wishes and
talents for a career. Facilities for aptitude
tests of various kinds would be needed, as well
as staff to process and counsel regarding such
tests. For this purpose, it would he well to
shift the efforts in career counseling now car
ried on by the Counseling and Testing Center
to an expanded Career Guidance Center. Infor

mation on opportunities and requisites for ca
reers of many kinds could conveniently be
gathered and sometimes produced by a Career
Guidance Center, and one might expect to find
in it the current catalogues of graduate and
professional schools across the country.
It has often been remarked that, for all the
Founders' desires that a Stanford education
should fit students for useful pursuits, the ac
cessibility of career counsel is rather slim
hÂ°re. In feeling that the situation bears im
provement the Committee does not imply that
every student should have made a clear voca
tional choice by the end of his senior year. But
students wishing to make informed and ra
tional choices of careers should have access as
early as possible to information and individual
ized counsel regarding the options. A Career
Guidance Center might have the contacts to
place students in part-time and temporary
jobs with persons in careers that the students
are considering, experience which might be
invaluable whether it be positive or negative.
Other methods of gaining insight into vari
ous kinds of professional life may likewise
gain momentum. A proposal now being con
sidered suggests the establishment of sopho
more and higher level courses on the profes
sions, taught from the perspectives of both
the humanities and the social sciences. Such
courses would be informational and descriptive
and in no sense recruitment techniques. Still
other means might be found to make available
for students bases for wise career decisions.
The present admirable advising done by facul
ty members of the School of Medicine with
and for pre-medical students could profitably
be emulated elsewhere. Could not the Schools
of Law, Business, and Education, for example,
provide similar counsel in cooperation with a
Career Guidance Center? The Committee pre
sumes that remuneration occupations will for
some time be necessary for most members of
American society. There is point, therefore, to
the thought that education can be useful, even
though that is far from being the whole point
of education.
111. Academic
Advising
If personal counseling is very largely done
casually and by amateurs, so is academic ad
vising. Most of the advising done at Stanford
is done by one undergraduate to another. The
Committee heartily approves this state of af
fairs at the same time that it is not satisfied
to abandon faculty advising.
Student Advising. Several aspects of under
graduate advising are carried by undergradu
ates. Students get their best information about
the value of specific courses from other stu
dents who have taken them. This is only natu
ral. Faculty members are loath to comment
on their colleagues, for reasons of professional
propriety; students are not. Moreover, faculty
members can talk about courses taught by
their colleagues only by hearsay, where stu
dents can speak at first hand. Such informal
advising is valuable, even though it is fre
quently biased. Sporadic attempts have been
made to bring it usefully into published form,
with such documents as the Course Review,
succeeding the earlier "Scratch Sheet." The
Committee applauds the concept of a student
Course Review as a valuable asset to advising,
and wishes that it might be thorough in its
coverage of courses, representative of a varie
ty of student reactions, and sensitive to stated
aims of professors in courses. Such a review
would also inform professors helpfully about
responses to the courses. The Course Review
ought to appear regularly, with cooperation
and financial assistance from the University
but without administrative control.
A recent experiment in appointing students
as advisers-at-large in their major departments
produced uncertain results. The fault may lie
partially in a lack of information about the
program, in student suspicion that student
advisers would be "administration types," in
students' feelings that they could get as good
advice from their friendsâ€”or in any possible
combination of those and other factors. The
Committee is not satisfied that student de
partmental advising is a bad idea, especially
on the basis of one year's experiment in three
departments. It exhorts departments and
schools to keep trying to find ways of taking
advantage of students' advising abilities.
The function of the adviser. We have already
expressed the Committee's suggestion that ad
vising not be simply a matter of policing, of
making sure that the student has information
and is taking the courses he is required to
take. The Adviser's Handbook describes the
goal of advising as bringing "the student to
the point where he can assume a maximum
amount of responsibility for his own academic
program and can make wise decisions on his
own" (p. 12). The Committee wishes to go be
yond that to propose that the adviser be
viewed both by the student and by himself as
the student's academic advocate, the particular
educator who agrees to concern himself with
his advisee's best education. This means prin
cipally that the adviser wishes to help the
student plan an educational career that goes
somewhere, that has coherence and point to it,
rather than being a miscellaneous collection
of requirements and aimless electives. If the
adviser is the student's advocate, however, this
coherence must be a means of enabling the
student's wishes and strengths to be embodied
in his program, not a way for the adviser to
impose his own concepts on the student.
Such a concept would, to he sure, produce
advising that takes more time, for carefully
considering with a student his academic ob
jectives and intellectual curiosities consumes
more time that simply signing his card. But if
such advising is understood and underscored
by tin 1 faculty as integral 1o education, faculty
members may more happily engage in it. It

poses several problems, among which is the
acceptance of advising as a normal aspect of
academic appointment at Stanford. If such
advising will not be done by the faculty, some
one must do it. In the absence of good faculty
advising, a corps of professional advisers
would probably have to be retained to the dam
age of the budget and of the academic exper
tise with which advising ought to be done. On
all counts, the Committee emphatically prefers
faculty advising.
The student's stake in advising. A curious
duality is sometimes to be observed among
students. On the one hand, they firmly ob
ject to be treated as ciphers or as children by
an institution standing in loco parentis. On
the other .they wish the advice of their elders
among the faculty, and this wish is sometimes
Indistinguishable from a desire for a parent
surrogate. Occasionally, when the advice given
is not to an individual's liking, he will pro
test that he is not being respected. We point
this out in part to say that the students' own
view of their stake in advising is not crystal
clear.
Although the student knows more about
himself than any adviser is ever likely to
know, he needs advising because he has not
enough experience of education to know pre
cisely how to join his interests and talents
to a curricular regimen. This observation ap
plies equally, though in different perspectives,
to undergraduates and graduate students. The
student looks to an adviser for guidance in
pursuing an education that will take ad
vantage of his interests and lead him beyond
his own provincial boundaries, at the same
time that it is certifiable by the University as
meeting its standards. The University, of
course, must determine what those standards
are, since it is the body doing the certifying.
The adviser stands toward the student in the
peculiar position of being at once a represen
tative of the University's power of sanction
upon the student (he makes judgments on stu
dents' performance) and and the advocate of
that particula student in the acquisition of his
most effective education.
If the structure of degree requirements on
the graduate level becomes less prescriptive,
the premium on interested advising which
aids the student toward coherence as well as
adventuresomeness will rise. Experience will
count for much in a student's planning, al
though it should not be prescriptively applied.
What is at stake for the student in a more flex
ible under-graduate program is precisely the
humanity of an adviser who is genuinely the
student's educational advocate. If the program
is flexible, advocacy need not consist in find
ing ways to circumvent regulations.
The levels of advising and their problems.
Special and different problems of advising ob
tain for freshmen, transfers, upperclass un
dergraduates and departmental majors, and
graduate students. At the same time, the Com
mittee is convinced of one true observation:
the best advising takes place where advisee
and adviser have some kind of common bond,
beyond the routine. This may be the bond of
the same field of study (the normal pre-set
bond between graduate students and faculty),
some common experience (frequently that the
student has taken the faculty member's
course), or prior acquaintance.
From this standpoint, the advising of fresh
men is the most difficult task, for freshmen
rarely have any existing bond to a faculty
member. It must be established. The Commit
tee has been divided upon several possible ways
to handle freshman advising. That the faculty
should carry the bulk of the advising seems
wise, yet a student's assigned adviser only
rarely turns out to be important or helpful
to him. As the freshman year curriculum now
stands, freshmen rarely come into close con
tact with faculty members, except those al
-most as transient as themselves: English
TA's, Western Civ instructors, lab TA's, and
beginning math and language TA's. The In
crease of Freshman seminars may improve
the range of faculty contact. The plans of
assigning advisers to groups in living units
has been extremely spotty in its effectiveness,
and it suffers from the fact that the advisers
remain abstractly faculty members, rather
than being perceived in their active teaching
roles. Relationships of freshman to faculty
residents or directors of living units, to tutors,
and to sponsors are relatively close, and these
persons in fact do the bulk of freshman ad
vising. The Trancos experiment is one possible
model of freshman advising, where residence
director, sponsors and tutors, and a team of
faculty advisers work closely together. Fresh
man advising ought to aid in the orientation
of the entering student, j.etting him off on the
right foot, proposing seriously that he identify
areas of genuine intellectual interest. Such
advising should prepare the student to find
a permanent academic adviser as he goes.
The Committee is unanimous in suggesting
that advising will become more effective from
all sides if the student ultimately chooses his
own adviser. In fact this frequently happens
now, except that the adviser whom the stu
dent chooses is often not the one responsible
for signing his card. We see the following
arguments in favor of this idea: 1. The stu
dent will most likely choose a faculty mem
ber whom he has seen in action, knows some
thing of his qualities and the "cut of his jib."
2. Such a relationship would underscore the
obligation of both student and adviser for
tion in which the student is interested and
tion In which the student is interested an
which makes coherent academic sense of his
interests and career plans. (The Committee
believes, parenthetically, that changing ad
visers and programs ought to be quite easy,
with no prejudice attached to it.) 3. If the
structure of the freshman year becomes less
prescribed, freshmen will have access to a
broader range of course options and of faculty
members than is now the case and will be
more likely to identify someone with whom
they believe they can work.
Certain problems with this arrangement can
be foreseen. 1. Some very popular professors
will be swamped with advisees, and other fac
ulty members will have few or none. To this
the Committee would propose that limitations
on the number of advisees per faculty member
be administratively established (see below.) 2.
Understaffed departments will have too many
majors to observe the limitations, and will have
to continue assigning majors to advisers. To
this the Committee proposes that the student's
adviser need not, though he may, be in the stu
dent's own major department. If the adviser is
not charged to keep track of regulations, it is
not at all unlikely that a professor in one de
partment can help a student in another to pur
sue a course that both meets the standards laid
down by the department and satisfies the stu
dent's own academic needs and wants. Depart
ments might require countersignature of study
cards by departmental representatives. Any
student seriously wishing to become a his
torian, for example, will probably try to find
a historian as adviser in order to get help in
preparing to be like him. We recognize that
in some programs, e.g. Philosophy and the
Honors Program in Humanities, the adviser
docs considerable tutoring of the student in
his senior year. This does not seem to us in
compatible with the basic premise. We are in
clined, on the undergraduate level, to resist
departmental "imperialism," which demands
control over "its" students. An undergraduate
major need not, after all, be occupational prep
aration, but, especially in the Humanities and
Social Sciences, is rather a point of co
herence for one's entire liberal education. Stu
dents who wish strong identification with a
discipline or department may gain it by choos
ing advisers there. Students who do not want
such a concentration may be well served by
advisers from almost anywhere in the Uni
versity.
Such a plan would introduce a differentia
tion between freshman and upperclass advis
ing, in place of the present differentiation be
tween General Studies and major advising.
The Committee is inclined to believe that the
former differentiation would make all advis
ing more effective with regard to general ed
ucation. We are not yet agreed as to the time
when a student must have chosen his adviser.
Some might stay with the person to whom they
were assigned as freshmen; others would find
an adviser during the freshman year; still
others during the sophomore year. Some stu
dents might have three or four different ad
visers during their careers. We see no compel
ing reason why that should be forbidden,
though frequent changes may be a signal that
counseling of some kind is needed. As at pres
ent, students will continue to seek out advice
from faculty members whom they like and
trust, no matter who is the officially designated
adviser. The present suggestion is intended to
take advantage of that fact of life.
The advising of graduate students might
seem to be self-evident. No one except grad
uate students themselves seems to feel it a
problem. Some responsibilities which many

departments seem not to handle well with
graduate students are the following: (1) intro
ducing new students to the University; (2) in
forming students about and channeling them,
when need is present, to the Counseling and
Testing Center, Cowell Halth Service, the
Placement Service, etc.; (3) giving students
vocational advice and sometimes placing them;
(4) informing new students about housing pos
sibilities and problems; (5) informing students
about useful training obtainable on a reg
ular basis in other departments. The pro
blem here is different from that of under
graduates in that the graduate student is
earnestly in the process of professional prep
aration. There is a certain emulative aspect to
graduate study, therefore, because many grad
uate students (certainly not nearly 100%) are
working with people with whom they expect
ultimately to become colleagues. It seems to
us probable that at present graduate students
select their own advisers to an extent that un
dergraduate do not. The function of faculty in
attracting graduate students to any university
assures that the potential of full relationships
is present. A stronger administrative surveil
lance of graduate advising might help to over
come the deficiences of individual departments.
Some special problems. Three groups of stu
dents present special problems to which the
Committee does not yet have answers. It is
clear that transfer students could use far bet
ter help on arrival than most of them get. It is
also clear that their problems are different
from those faced by freshman. We believe that
transfer students should bo given high priority
for on-campus housing. It also seems to us
that the evaluation of transfer credits could
be expedited and improved in many ways.
Some faculty members might be especially en
couraged to handle transfer students. We de
sire further suggestions about the advising of
transfer students from anyone with ideas to
give.
Another group of students with problems to
which the Committee has not yet given
sufficient attention is foreign students. The
Beehtel International Center is a source of
remarkably fine personal attention to foreign
students. But this group has academic prob
lems peculiarly their own, and some made of
advising needs, we think, to be tailored to
them. Again, the Committee wishes to be
helped by ideas.
The third group is comprised of members
of minorities with special disadvantages. Ad
vising needs to have cognizance both of the
personal problems faced by such students and
of academic needs. Efforts to provide tutoring
from the Office of Financial Aids have been
sporadic, due largely to stringently limited
funds. Some more formal program of tutoring
and counsel would greatly increase the accessi
bility of an adequate Stanford education for
such students. Stanford has publicly stated its
intention to do the right thing by these per
sons. Additional support, morally and mone
tarily, needs to be provided.
The extent and rewards of advising. The
Committee believes that advising on all levels
should be taken together in figuring the aver
age ratio of advisees to advisers. Taking fig
ures in the fall Student Directory as sub

stantially correct for numbers of majors and
graduate students in the Schools and Depart
ments, and taking a count of faculty at As
sistant Professor or higher in Courses and De
grees as substantially correct (realizing that
many people in the latter are absent on leave),
and assuming that all of those faculty advise
majors and graduate students, we find the fol
lowing ratios by schools of major and grad
uate advisees to advisers:
Earth Sciences 5.8 (169/29)
Engineering 13.4 (2114A58)
Humanities & Sciences 11.7 (4739/405)
The figures for present General Studies ad
vising, however, look rather different. 115
persons are engaged in 1967-68 in General
Studies advising of 2330 students without de
clared majors, a ratio of 20.2G advisees to each
adviser. Sources of General Studies advisers
are as follows:
Earth Sciences 7 (24% of
school faculty)
Engineering 11 (6.9% of
school faculty)
Humanities & Sciences 45 (11.1% of
school faculty)
Medicine 12
Military Science 2
Physical Education 3
Education 2
Administration 33
The figures show the difficulties encountered
by the Registrar in his task of recruiting
General Studies Advisers. Only 63 ( 54.8%) of
present General Studies advisers come from
the faculties of Schools which will enroll the
advisees as majors. Moreover, only 39% of
General Studies advisers come from the School
of Humanities and Sciences, which can rea
sonably expect to enroll about 80% of un
dergraduates.
At the same time, figures received from De
partments of the School of Humanities and
Sciences show a very wide variation in the
actual advising practice of departments. Some
departments average as few as 4 departmental
advisees per adviser, whereas members of
others may have as many as 66 major ad
visees. Such a figure seems to the Committee
a mockery of the very idea of advising.
One can be only routine with that many ad
visees. The Committee is inclined to believe
that an upper limit on the number of allowable
advisees per adviser should be set, perhaps at
25 or 30, such a figure to include both grad
uate and undergraduate students. The Com
mittee also believes that Deans should ask
executive hads of departments quite search
ing questions about provisions for carrying
advising when many members of a depart
ment propose to be on leave for a given year.
One instance has been reported in which a
member of a large department finds himself
during this academic year with 89 advisees
(graduate, undergraduate major, and Gen
eral Studies) because so many of his col
league are absent on leave. If a limit on ad
visees were set and adhered to, such ex
ploitation would not be permitted.
The Committee has thought very hard about
the place of advising in Stanford's status and
reward system for its faculty. At present, save

for one department that claims to adjust Its
teaching loads in proportion to advising loads,
advising is in fact extra-curricular, in that
it is supposed to be done but no one pays
much attention if it is not done. The Commit
tee is informed that advisers receive extra
pay in some universities, and it has discussed
whether bonus pay would be an incentive to
better advising. We are not satisfied that it
would. We have also asked how a faculty
member's advising effectiveness might be a
factor in his promotion and salary increment.
Nothing would please the Committee more
than to be shown a method of accurate evalua
tion of this effectiveness, so that it could be
used as one among other determinants. We
have yet to find a method. Even if the stu
dent were to choose his adviser, one could not
determine the adviser's effectiveness merely
by counting the number of his advisees.
The Committee believes that advising will
be able to play a role in the status and re
ward system only if the faculty becomes so
committed to the advising function (which,
for the Committee, is integral to the educa
tional function) that the very commitment
produces a means of reward. The faculty
must decide that advising is important, and
the faculty at large must expend some energy
in advising. Pressure probably ought to be
exerted on those of our colleagues who would
rather not advise students, although the very
reluctant adviser will likely not be a very
good one. Perhaps, in considerations of reward
and promotion, nothing more than a negative
question can be asked. If a brilliant research
er does no advising, can his research contribu
tions outweigh the absence of his contribu
tion to the University's humanity? In some in
stances, the answer might have to be "No."
So far as the Committee knows, the question
has never been asked.
Advising in the professor's profession. The
Committee has expressed its conviction that
advising students is properly a part of the
educational profession, that such an as
sumption ought if possible to be an element
in consideration of reward. We suggest, more
over, that prospective faculty appointees be
informed of advising obligations of Stanford
faculty members. We would also suggest a
more long-range way of achieving the actuality
of this assumption. It has often been pointed
out that among the weakest aspects of grad
uate education today is the failure to prepare
people for their profession. Graduate students
are trained to do research, but many of them
are hired to be teachers and members of fac
ulties. We do not wish to underplay research.
But too little is done to train those of our grad
uate students who will become teachers for
their actual professional functions. The Com
mittee suggests the advisability of instruc
tion for graduate students in the scope of the
objectives and responsibilities of their chosen
profession, which will help them comprehend
the expectations under which they will work.
Such instruction could go a long way toward
making actual the ideal that professors are
engaged in education, an activity that includes
research and publication, classroom teach
ing, and the education of individual students
outside of formal instruction that advising
ought to be. When education in that sense be
comes the basic assumption of the University's

life, we will be on the way toward the fulfill
ment of our humanity.

Epilogue:
Enablement and
Surveillance
It is hoped that in such a relatively casual
and self selecting system as that proposed
above, the quiet and unspectacular job that
needs to be done will proceed. But responsibili
ty for watching it must be lodged somewhere
more specific than in the hearts and minds of
the 20,000-odd souls of the Stanford commun
ity. There needs to be improved liaison among
agencies, assurance that stated functions are
being fulfilled, exhortation if not pressure
for participation in both given and receiving.
It was suggested, half jocularly, in the Com
mittee that what is wanted is a "University
humane ofTice.'The term is simplistic, but the
thought is precise. To indicate, to itself and
everyone else, that Stanford means its hu
manity, the responsibility should be assumed
by a highly placed officer, of at least Associate
Provost rank, whose responsibilities would in
clude the coordination of advising and coun
seling structures.
The Committee remains uncertain whether
the responsibility should be added to those
carried by the Dean of Students, whether it
should be assigned to a Dean of Undergraduate
Educationâ€”should such a position be rein
statedâ€”or whether a new position should be
created. In favor of the first is the fact that
the Dean of Students is now responsible for
several agencies in which counseling and ad
vising take place. On the other hand, the ed
ucational thrust of the entire program might
suggest that the responsibility be held by a
distinctly academic officer such as a Dean of
Undergraduate Education. At the same time,
the fact that advising and counseling must af
fect graduate as well as undergraduate stu
dents makes desirable that the officer not be
exclusively occupied with undergraduates.
Whoever such a person might be, and what
ever his title, he must be accessible to and
trustable by students, command the respect
and attract the cooperation of the faculty, and
display remarkable virtues to non-academic
staff persons.

This paper is presented to the University
community by the Committee on Advising and
Couast'lint; of the Study of Education at Stan
ford. It is important to say tliat the paper is
intended not as a recommendation for immedi
ate decision hut as some proposals for discus
sion.
Hearings will take place 7 9 p.m. Tuesday
and 4-fi p.m. Wednesday in room 143 of Meyer
Library. Members of the committee will be
present to receive comments on the paper. The
Committee also welcomes written responses to
the SES office, Meyer Library.
Few subjects are so frequently the target of
criticism as advising, few so rarely the object
of constructive suggestion. Widespread agree
ment thai advising is not very well done at
Stanford is equalled by imprecision as to the
problem and feasible solutions. Our realism
breeds cynicism, concluding that we must ac
cept inadequacy.
The Committee on Advising and Counseling
of the Study of Education at Stanford has at
tempted to be realistic but not cynical. Mow
ever unlikely the radical alteration of human
nature may be, the alteration of perspectives
and priorities is well within our reach. The
Committee urges the University's members,
however, that unless assumptions are modi
fied the cynics will he proven right. Foremost
among the assumptions that require adjust
ment is the tacit one that for a faculty mem
ber advising is an extracurricular activity.
This assumption produces hesitance on the
part of many students to consult advisers ex
cept for routine card-signing for fear of "tak
ing up his time," and their resultant complaint
that advising at Stanford is nothing but rou
tine. It produces the perception on the part of
faculty members that advising, except for one's
"own" special (preferably graduate) students,
is a chore to be avoided if possible and to be
disposed of quickly if avoidance is not possible.
It produces among administrators complete ig
norance of inequities in advising loads and the
ignoring of the function of advising in con
siderations of appointment, promotion, and re
ward.
The Committee is not so blindered as to sup
pose that advising is the most important as
pect of university life. But it is sensitive to
the penetration of aspects of advising into al
most everything Stanford does, from admis
sions to residence policy to undergraduate and
graduate curriculum to student services to the
extra-curriculum to placement and vocational
decisions. In what follows we have made some
assumption that bear explication. First, we
suppose that advising has basically to do with
the possibility of significant relations and com
munication between persons, that it sums up
what we intend by our sub-title: "the humani
ty of the University." Second, we assume that
the educational direction Stanford is taking
will entail more advising, not less, on both
graduate and undergraduate levels, and a high
er degree of humanity, not a lower. Third, we
assume that, since no system is perfect, an ar
rangement of advising that allows several
quite different forms and structures of advis
ing to take place will come closer to self-re
newal than a single, potentially rigid system.
The problem, as we presently see it, has
three points of focus: 1. the dissemination to
everyone who needs it of accurate and com
plete information; 2. the availability to anyone
who needs it of competent professional coun
seling; 3. the accessibility to all students of
Interested and personal academic advice.
I. Dissemination
of Information
The story about the man who did not have
enough information to take instruction is rele
vant to the problem of advising. The Commit
tee believes that adequate and accurate infor
mation on most matters regarding the Univer
sity is readily available to those who wish and
need to have it. Ignorance and misinformation
are widespread, however, some of it difficult
to understand.
The information that needs dissemination is
that which makes possible (1) awareness on
the part of faculty and students alike of exact
ly what the University's communal and aca
demic facilities are; (2) access by members of
the University to the various services provid
ed; (3) informed decisions about academic
matters on the part of students.
A great deal of this information can be and
is conveyed in print, but people forget things
when they read them in almost unnumerable
bulletins, pamphlets, brochures, hand-bills, mi
meographed or dittoed sheets, and the like.
The variety is compounded by the fact that
certain published materials are factual in na
ture and others are more propagandists in
tone and purpose, by the fact that some infor
mation is obsolete before it is ever printed and
some is incomplete.
The Committee suggests basic simplification
into two yearly publications. One is an expand
ed version of the present rather slim Informa
tion Bulletin, to serve as a more general hand
book to the University. Here should be de
tailed information on matters not covered in
Courses and Degrees: fees and expenses, resi
dences, relatively permanent organizations and
activities both student and University-wide,
services available to the community such as
those of the Health Service, the Counseling
and Testing Center, the Bechtel International
Center, and others. Also in such a handbook
might be found brief descriptions of the ad
ministrative operation of the University, the
duties and powers of its various officers, and
policies affecting various of its members.
Through such a publication, which should be
routinely in the hands of everyone, both stu
dents and faculty could find how to get help
for all kinds of problems. New students and
new faculty members in particular would, with

its aid, more easily find their ways in the Uni
versity.
Parenthetically, the Committee also sees a
need for a faculty handbook, which would in
form faculty members of such policies of ap
pointment, promotion, tenure, and administra
tive arrangement as are especially relevant to
them.
The Committee wishes, moreover, that Cour
ses and I)egre<>s might he improved. The in
formation in it is frequently obsolete before
the book comes off the press. Might there not
be in the den of someone at Stanford printing
methods that could reduce the lag between
copy deadlines and publication? Would the
improvement of accuracy allowed by an Aug
ust publication date outweigh the advantage
for incoming students of the present May pub
lication? Students and advisers alike now hesi
tate to use Courses and Degrees as a basis
for planning the work of even a single year in
advance. The Committee wonders, then, wheth
er usefulness for planning to those already
here should not have priority over usefulness
for those about to come. In the light of the in
creasing need for advanced academic planning
by students, greater accuracy becomes even
more desirable. Moreover, if Courses and De
grees wore improved and up-dated, the expense
of the quarterly Time Schedule might be re
duced by making it no more than a supple
ment to Courses and Degrees.
All of these publications would bo of im
mense help to advisers and their advisees. The
Committee is of the opinion that the adviser's
function should not be to disseminate informa
tion that the student can more readily receive
otherwise. In saying that, we take full cog
nizance of the high likelihood that anything in
print will be misunderstood, misconstrued, or
misused somewhere by someone. Where the
adviser perceives ignorance, he must, of
course, rectify itâ€”and the student may do the
same. The adviser will function well with an
advisee when both have the necessary infor
mation, for then the adviser is free to advise
instead of merely to inform.
Concomitantly, the Committee believes that
the adviser should be relieved of policing cur
ricular regulations. So much of academic ad
vising is taken up with routine questions about
the fulfillment of requirements (How many
units of Science have you left to take? How
much math? etc.) that time for genuine and
personalized advice is too often at a premium.
The Committee has a hunch, moreover, (1)
that on the whole students know the require
ments in General Studies and in major pro
grams better than their advisers do, and (2)
that students almost always know exactly
where they stand with regard to those require
ments. The Committee wonders about the feas
ibility of computerizing information of these
kinds to enable easy retrieval. If machines can
free us for the improvement of our humanity,
we should by all means use them.
In short, the Committee believes that advis
ing could be far better focussed on advice if
the dissemination of information were both
simplified and improved, so that the adviser
does not have to be a traffic cop of regulations.
11. Availability
of Counseling
For clarity of terminology, we use the term
"counseling" to mean the impartation of help
for problems of a personal sort, not immediate
ly involving the academic, while "advising" is
restricted in this paper to academic advice.
It is certainly the case that a great deal of
counseling in this sense occurs in any commu
nity as large and as complex as Stanford. Most
of it is casual, among close friends, and with
no pretense of professional expertise. This
sort of counseling will happen whether the
institution encourages or discourages it. Any
attempt to structure such relationships is, of
course, doomed to failure. Faculty members
also do a great deal of counseling of this kind.
Though some may criticize the non-profession
al nature of such counseling, that may in itself
bo one of the'strengths of the relationship. At
the same time, situations frequently arise
where professional counseling is needed and
any casual counselor should always have in
mind the possibility of referring someone to
sources of professional aid. The Committee has
not conceived of any way by which faculty or
other such occasional counselors might cus
tomarily be taught how to recognize danger
signals, but they should be aware of an obli
gation to suggest referral.
Nevertheless, sources of professional coun
seling are present at Stanford, and the Com
mittee has been surprise that some members
of the University, both faculty and students,
seem unaware of them. Apart from the coun
seling done in residences < faculty residents,
residence directors, resident assistants, tutors,
and sponsors), which would have to be called
at best semi-professional, counseling done by
campus religious representatives, and that
done in special circumstances by persons in
the Dean of Students' office, the University
maintains two major sources of professional
counseling and a third that might become one.
We refer in the first instance to the Counsel
ing and Testing Center and to the psychiatric
services of the Cowell Health Center, and in
the second instance to the Placement Service.
The Counseling and Testing Center provides
psychological testing of many kinds and both
short-range and long-range psychological coun
seling. The psychiatric staff of the Cowell
Health Center is available for psychiatric con
sultation and some forms of therapy, and pa
tients in need of long-range therapy are re
ferred to psychiatrists in the School of Medi
cine for it.
The Committee has no wish to enter into the
relative merits of these two approaches, be
lieving that both meet various kinds of situ
ations helpfully. The liaison between the Conn

soling and Testing Center and the Cowell
Health reportedly good and getting
better. Such liaison and cooperation should be
encouraged by the University administration.
The fact that a relatively small proportion of
Stanford students uses the counseling services
in these two institutions may be an index of
the community's relatively healthy mental
state. On the other hand, experience hÂ°re and
in other universities would seem to indicate
that there are many more problems than are
actually met by these services. Larger staffs
would doubtless encourage more students with
real problems to seek aid.
It has been rightly observed that while any
person lacks the medical or psychological
help he needs, the job of counseling is not be
ing properly done. One of our faculty col
leagues recently stated that "One student sui
cide per year is one too many," a sentiment
with which no one could quarrel. But preven
tion in the realm of counseling is the most
difficult task. For one thing, it requires the
willing cooperation of the patient or subject.
The continued excellence and improvement
of these two services seems to the Committee,
however, a matter of rather high priority. We
are in a period where the mental strains upon
the age group of Stanford students are great
and on the increase. It is no pampering mood
that leads to the conclusion that professional
aid is needed; it is rather the sense of urgency
that informs higher education, and the wish
that barriers to the best education every stu
dent is capable of absorbing be as far as possi
ble thrown down. We do not believe that the
improvement of, say, the Counseling and Test
ing Center is more important than the im
provement of the faculty. But believing in the
priority of the academic, we wish it to be aided
by the best medical and psychological services
Stanford can afford to render.
We have few specific recommendations,
apart from general improvementâ€”which In
itself ought not to be taken as underhanded
criticism. The first contact with the Counsel
ing and Testing Center ought to make clear
to entering students that genuine personal
counsel may be had there. We are dubious
that the orientation-week testing is a good in
troduction for students, valuable as the re
sults may be for staff research. The counsel
ing function should be made more distinct
from that of legitimate research.
The most difficult question with which the
Committee has long wrestled is how to be
sure that the people who need the help receive
it. To that question, we have no satisfactory
answer. The availability of the services should
b" widely publicized and accurately described.
Every member of the University should know
about them. But the person who refuses to
seek help when he needs it can not, by any
means the Committee has been able to discov
er, be forced to have it.
The Committee notes with satisfaction the
recent improvements in the situation of reli
gious ministries on the campus. Although not
every religious tradition is officially repre
sented, persons desiring counseling of a reli
gious sort have access to a broad range of
clergymen and denominational representatives.
Since campus office space was made available
to denominational representatives, the work
of the Pean of the Chapel and his assistant
and of the University Chaplain has been en
larged by cooperation. To those who doubt the
propriety of the presence of clergymen on a
university campus, the Committee would say
that the day when religious bodies looked on
the ministry to students as a salvage operation
from the godless university is long past. Safe
guards against irresponsibility in this as in
other areas of interest can be established ad
ministratively. Those members of the Univer
sity who find religious counsel helpful and nec
essary can and do seek it out.
By virtue of the fact that Selective Service
is of immediate concern to the majority of
Stanford students, the Committee has consid
ered advising facilities offered regarding the
draft. A National Service Adviser has for
some time been available. The Committee ap
plauds the addition of a counselor on con
scientious objection to the student facilities
available on campus. We anticipate that such
an office will be continued while the question
of the draft is pertinent, and suggest that the
amount of student need for such counsel re
quires the availability of more time than is
now provided. The different natures of the
counseling involved makes it advisable to keep
separate the conscientious objection counsel
ing and National Service advising. Greater co
ordination of the latter with the ROTC offices
and the Placement Service would facilitate the
answering of questions faced by many stu
dents in regard to the options available for
fulfillment of military service. However, the
effectiveness of both offices is hampered at
present by lack of information reaching the
student. Publicizing these services in the hand
book to the University proposed above, and by
whatever means are now available, and the
initiation of orientation sessions with tutors,
residence assistants, and directors may begin
to alleviate this inadequacy.
The Placement Service is kept until last be
cause the Committee believes substantial ex
pansion is possible and desirable. At present
the Placement Service is a means to bring
prospective employees into contact with pros
pective employers and to aid students to re
ceive part-time and summer jobs. With ex
pense (the Committee does not wish to guess
how much* and reorganization, the Placement
Service could become a Career Guidance Cen
ter. This change would put job interviews into
perspective as aspects of a more thorough in
vestigation by the individual of his wishes and
talents for a career. Facilities for aptitude
tests of various kinds would be needed, as well
as staff to process and counsel regarding such
tests. For this purpose, it would he well to
shift the efforts in career counseling now car
ried on by the Counseling and Testing Center
to an expanded Career Guidance Center. Infor

mation on opportunities and requisites for ca
reers of many kinds could conveniently be
gathered and sometimes produced by a Career
Guidance Center, and one might expect to find
in it the current catalogues of graduate and
professional schools across the country.
It has often been remarked that, for all the
Founders' desires that a Stanford education
should fit students for useful pursuits, the ac
cessibility of career counsel is rather slim
hÂ°re. In feeling that the situation bears im
provement the Committee does not imply that
every student should have made a clear voca
tional choice by the end of his senior year. But
students wishing to make informed and ra
tional choices of careers should have access as
early as possible to information and individual
ized counsel regarding the options. A Career
Guidance Center might have the contacts to
place students in part-time and temporary
jobs with persons in careers that the students
are considering, experience which might be
invaluable whether it be positive or negative.
Other methods of gaining insight into vari
ous kinds of professional life may likewise
gain momentum. A proposal now being con
sidered suggests the establishment of sopho
more and higher level courses on the profes
sions, taught from the perspectives of both
the humanities and the social sciences. Such
courses would be informational and descriptive
and in no sense recruitment techniques. Still
other means might be found to make available
for students bases for wise career decisions.
The present admirable advising done by facul
ty members of the School of Medicine with
and for pre-medical students could profitably
be emulated elsewhere. Could not the Schools
of Law, Business, and Education, for example,
provide similar counsel in cooperation with a
Career Guidance Center? The Committee pre
sumes that remuneration occupations will for
some time be necessary for most members of
American society. There is point, therefore, to
the thought that education can be useful, even
though that is far from being the whole point
of education.
111. Academic
Advising
If personal counseling is very largely done
casually and by amateurs, so is academic ad
vising. Most of the advising done at Stanford
is done by one undergraduate to another. The
Committee heartily approves this state of af
fairs at the same time that it is not satisfied
to abandon faculty advising.
Student Advising. Several aspects of under
graduate advising are carried by undergradu
ates. Students get their best information about
the value of specific courses from other stu
dents who have taken them. This is only natu
ral. Faculty members are loath to comment
on their colleagues, for reasons of professional
propriety; students are not. Moreover, faculty
members can talk about courses taught by
their colleagues only by hearsay, where stu
dents can speak at first hand. Such informal
advising is valuable, even though it is fre
quently biased. Sporadic attempts have been
made to bring it usefully into published form,
with such documents as the Course Review,
succeeding the earlier "Scratch Sheet." The
Committee applauds the concept of a student
Course Review as a valuable asset to advising,
and wishes that it might be thorough in its
coverage of courses, representative of a varie
ty of student reactions, and sensitive to stated
aims of professors in courses. Such a review
would also inform professors helpfully about
responses to the courses. The Course Review
ought to appear regularly, with cooperation
and financial assistance from the University
but without administrative control.
A recent experiment in appointing students
as advisers-at-large in their major departments
produced uncertain results. The fault may lie
partially in a lack of information about the
program, in student suspicion that student
advisers would be "administration types," in
students' feelings that they could get as good
advice from their friendsâ€”or in any possible
combination of those and other factors. The
Committee is not satisfied that student de
partmental advising is a bad idea, especially
on the basis of one year's experiment in three
departments. It exhorts departments and
schools to keep trying to find ways of taking
advantage of students' advising abilities.
The function of the adviser. We have already
expressed the Committee's suggestion that ad
vising not be simply a matter of policing, of
making sure that the student has information
and is taking the courses he is required to
take. The Adviser's Handbook describes the
goal of advising as bringing "the student to
the point where he can assume a maximum
amount of responsibility for his own academic
program and can make wise decisions on his
own" (p. 12). The Committee wishes to go be
yond that to propose that the adviser be
viewed both by the student and by himself as
the student's academic advocate, the particular
educator who agrees to concern himself with
his advisee's best education. This means prin
cipally that the adviser wishes to help the
student plan an educational career that goes
somewhere, that has coherence and point to it,
rather than being a miscellaneous collection
of requirements and aimless electives. If the
adviser is the student's advocate, however, this
coherence must be a means of enabling the
student's wishes and strengths to be embodied
in his program, not a way for the adviser to
impose his own concepts on the student.
Such a concept would, to he sure, produce
advising that takes more time, for carefully
considering with a student his academic ob
jectives and intellectual curiosities consumes
more time that simply signing his card. But if
such advising is understood and underscored
by tin 1 faculty as integral 1o education, faculty
members may more happily engage in it. It

poses several problems, among which is the
acceptance of advising as a normal aspect of
academic appointment at Stanford. If such
advising will not be done by the faculty, some
one must do it. In the absence of good faculty
advising, a corps of professional advisers
would probably have to be retained to the dam
age of the budget and of the academic exper
tise with which advising ought to be done. On
all counts, the Committee emphatically prefers
faculty advising.
The student's stake in advising. A curious
duality is sometimes to be observed among
students. On the one hand, they firmly ob
ject to be treated as ciphers or as children by
an institution standing in loco parentis. On
the other .they wish the advice of their elders
among the faculty, and this wish is sometimes
Indistinguishable from a desire for a parent
surrogate. Occasionally, when the advice given
is not to an individual's liking, he will pro
test that he is not being respected. We point
this out in part to say that the students' own
view of their stake in advising is not crystal
clear.
Although the student knows more about
himself than any adviser is ever likely to
know, he needs advising because he has not
enough experience of education to know pre
cisely how to join his interests and talents
to a curricular regimen. This observation ap
plies equally, though in different perspectives,
to undergraduates and graduate students. The
student looks to an adviser for guidance in
pursuing an education that will take ad
vantage of his interests and lead him beyond
his own provincial boundaries, at the same
time that it is certifiable by the University as
meeting its standards. The University, of
course, must determine what those standards
are, since it is the body doing the certifying.
The adviser stands toward the student in the
peculiar position of being at once a represen
tative of the University's power of sanction
upon the student (he makes judgments on stu
dents' performance) and and the advocate of
that particula student in the acquisition of his
most effective education.
If the structure of degree requirements on
the graduate level becomes less prescriptive,
the premium on interested advising which
aids the student toward coherence as well as
adventuresomeness will rise. Experience will
count for much in a student's planning, al
though it should not be prescriptively applied.
What is at stake for the student in a more flex
ible under-graduate program is precisely the
humanity of an adviser who is genuinely the
student's educational advocate. If the program
is flexible, advocacy need not consist in find
ing ways to circumvent regulations.
The levels of advising and their problems.
Special and different problems of advising ob
tain for freshmen, transfers, upperclass un
dergraduates and departmental majors, and
graduate students. At the same time, the Com
mittee is convinced of one true observation:
the best advising takes place where advisee
and adviser have some kind of common bond,
beyond the routine. This may be the bond of
the same field of study (the normal pre-set
bond between graduate students and faculty),
some common experience (frequently that the
student has taken the faculty member's
course), or prior acquaintance.
From this standpoint, the advising of fresh
men is the most difficult task, for freshmen
rarely have any existing bond to a faculty
member. It must be established. The Commit
tee has been divided upon several possible ways
to handle freshman advising. That the faculty
should carry the bulk of the advising seems
wise, yet a student's assigned adviser only
rarely turns out to be important or helpful
to him. As the freshman year curriculum now
stands, freshmen rarely come into close con
tact with faculty members, except those al
-most as transient as themselves: English
TA's, Western Civ instructors, lab TA's, and
beginning math and language TA's. The In
crease of Freshman seminars may improve
the range of faculty contact. The plans of
assigning advisers to groups in living units
has been extremely spotty in its effectiveness,
and it suffers from the fact that the advisers
remain abstractly faculty members, rather
than being perceived in their active teaching
roles. Relationships of freshman to faculty
residents or directors of living units, to tutors,
and to sponsors are relatively close, and these
persons in fact do the bulk of freshman ad
vising. The Trancos experiment is one possible
model of freshman advising, where residence
director, sponsors and tutors, and a team of
faculty advisers work closely together. Fresh
man advising ought to aid in the orientation
of the entering student, j.etting him off on the
right foot, proposing seriously that he identify
areas of genuine intellectual interest. Such
advising should prepare the student to find
a permanent academic adviser as he goes.
The Committee is unanimous in suggesting
that advising will become more effective from
all sides if the student ultimately chooses his
own adviser. In fact this frequently happens
now, except that the adviser whom the stu
dent chooses is often not the one responsible
for signing his card. We see the following
arguments in favor of this idea: 1. The stu
dent will most likely choose a faculty mem
ber whom he has seen in action, knows some
thing of his qualities and the "cut of his jib."
2. Such a relationship would underscore the
obligation of both student and adviser for
tion in which the student is interested and
tion In which the student is interested an
which makes coherent academic sense of his
interests and career plans. (The Committee
believes, parenthetically, that changing ad
visers and programs ought to be quite easy,
with no prejudice attached to it.) 3. If the
structure of the freshman year becomes less
prescribed, freshmen will have access to a
broader range of course options and of faculty
members than is now the case and will be
more likely to identify someone with whom
they believe they can work.
Certain problems with this arrangement can
be foreseen. 1. Some very popular professors
will be swamped with advisees, and other fac
ulty members will have few or none. To this
the Committee would propose that limitations
on the number of advisees per faculty member
be administratively established (see below.) 2.
Understaffed departments will have too many
majors to observe the limitations, and will have
to continue assigning majors to advisers. To
this the Committee proposes that the student's
adviser need not, though he may, be in the stu
dent's own major department. If the adviser is
not charged to keep track of regulations, it is
not at all unlikely that a professor in one de
partment can help a student in another to pur
sue a course that both meets the standards laid
down by the department and satisfies the stu
dent's own academic needs and wants. Depart
ments might require countersignature of study
cards by departmental representatives. Any
student seriously wishing to become a his
torian, for example, will probably try to find
a historian as adviser in order to get help in
preparing to be like him. We recognize that
in some programs, e.g. Philosophy and the
Honors Program in Humanities, the adviser
docs considerable tutoring of the student in
his senior year. This does not seem to us in
compatible with the basic premise. We are in
clined, on the undergraduate level, to resist
departmental "imperialism," which demands
control over "its" students. An undergraduate
major need not, after all, be occupational prep
aration, but, especially in the Humanities and
Social Sciences, is rather a point of co
herence for one's entire liberal education. Stu
dents who wish strong identification with a
discipline or department may gain it by choos
ing advisers there. Students who do not want
such a concentration may be well served by
advisers from almost anywhere in the Uni
versity.
Such a plan would introduce a differentia
tion between freshman and upperclass advis
ing, in place of the present differentiation be
tween General Studies and major advising.
The Committee is inclined to believe that the
former differentiation would make all advis
ing more effective with regard to general ed
ucation. We are not yet agreed as to the time
when a student must have chosen his adviser.
Some might stay with the person to whom they
were assigned as freshmen; others would find
an adviser during the freshman year; still
others during the sophomore year. Some stu
dents might have three or four different ad
visers during their careers. We see no compel
ing reason why that should be forbidden,
though frequent changes may be a signal that
counseling of some kind is needed. As at pres
ent, students will continue to seek out advice
from faculty members whom they like and
trust, no matter who is the officially designated
adviser. The present suggestion is intended to
take advantage of that fact of life.
The advising of graduate students might
seem to be self-evident. No one except grad
uate students themselves seems to feel it a
problem. Some responsibilities which many

departments seem not to handle well with
graduate students are the following: (1) intro
ducing new students to the University; (2) in
forming students about and channeling them,
when need is present, to the Counseling and
Testing Center, Cowell Halth Service, the
Placement Service, etc.; (3) giving students
vocational advice and sometimes placing them;
(4) informing new students about housing pos
sibilities and problems; (5) informing students
about useful training obtainable on a reg
ular basis in other departments. The pro
blem here is different from that of under
graduates in that the graduate student is
earnestly in the process of professional prep
aration. There is a certain emulative aspect to
graduate study, therefore, because many grad
uate students (certainly not nearly 100%) are
working with people with whom they expect
ultimately to become colleagues. It seems to
us probable that at present graduate students
select their own advisers to an extent that un
dergraduate do not. The function of faculty in
attracting graduate students to any university
assures that the potential of full relationships
is present. A stronger administrative surveil
lance of graduate advising might help to over
come the deficiences of individual departments.
Some special problems. Three groups of stu
dents present special problems to which the
Committee does not yet have answers. It is
clear that transfer students could use far bet
ter help on arrival than most of them get. It is
also clear that their problems are different
from those faced by freshman. We believe that
transfer students should bo given high priority
for on-campus housing. It also seems to us
that the evaluation of transfer credits could
be expedited and improved in many ways.
Some faculty members might be especially en
couraged to handle transfer students. We de
sire further suggestions about the advising of
transfer students from anyone with ideas to
give.
Another group of students with problems to
which the Committee has not yet given
sufficient attention is foreign students. The
Beehtel International Center is a source of
remarkably fine personal attention to foreign
students. But this group has academic prob
lems peculiarly their own, and some made of
advising needs, we think, to be tailored to
them. Again, the Committee wishes to be
helped by ideas.
The third group is comprised of members
of minorities with special disadvantages. Ad
vising needs to have cognizance both of the
personal problems faced by such students and
of academic needs. Efforts to provide tutoring
from the Office of Financial Aids have been
sporadic, due largely to stringently limited
funds. Some more formal program of tutoring
and counsel would greatly increase the accessi
bility of an adequate Stanford education for
such students. Stanford has publicly stated its
intention to do the right thing by these per
sons. Additional support, morally and mone
tarily, needs to be provided.
The extent and rewards of advising. The
Committee believes that advising on all levels
should be taken together in figuring the aver
age ratio of advisees to advisers. Taking fig
ures in the fall Student Directory as sub

stantially correct for numbers of majors and
graduate students in the Schools and Depart
ments, and taking a count of faculty at As
sistant Professor or higher in Courses and De
grees as substantially correct (realizing that
many people in the latter are absent on leave),
and assuming that all of those faculty advise
majors and graduate students, we find the fol
lowing ratios by schools of major and grad
uate advisees to advisers:
Earth Sciences 5.8 (169/29)
Engineering 13.4 (2114A58)
Humanities & Sciences 11.7 (4739/405)
The figures for present General Studies ad
vising, however, look rather different. 115
persons are engaged in 1967-68 in General
Studies advising of 2330 students without de
clared majors, a ratio of 20.2G advisees to each
adviser. Sources of General Studies advisers
are as follows:
Earth Sciences 7 (24% of
school faculty)
Engineering 11 (6.9% of
school faculty)
Humanities & Sciences 45 (11.1% of
school faculty)
Medicine 12
Military Science 2
Physical Education 3
Education 2
Administration 33
The figures show the difficulties encountered
by the Registrar in his task of recruiting
General Studies Advisers. Only 63 ( 54.8%) of
present General Studies advisers come from
the faculties of Schools which will enroll the
advisees as majors. Moreover, only 39% of
General Studies advisers come from the School
of Humanities and Sciences, which can rea
sonably expect to enroll about 80% of un
dergraduates.
At the same time, figures received from De
partments of the School of Humanities and
Sciences show a very wide variation in the
actual advising practice of departments. Some
departments average as few as 4 departmental
advisees per adviser, whereas members of
others may have as many as 66 major ad
visees. Such a figure seems to the Committee
a mockery of the very idea of advising.
One can be only routine with that many ad
visees. The Committee is inclined to believe
that an upper limit on the number of allowable
advisees per adviser should be set, perhaps at
25 or 30, such a figure to include both grad
uate and undergraduate students. The Com
mittee also believes that Deans should ask
executive hads of departments quite search
ing questions about provisions for carrying
advising when many members of a depart
ment propose to be on leave for a given year.
One instance has been reported in which a
member of a large department finds himself
during this academic year with 89 advisees
(graduate, undergraduate major, and Gen
eral Studies) because so many of his col
league are absent on leave. If a limit on ad
visees were set and adhered to, such ex
ploitation would not be permitted.
The Committee has thought very hard about
the place of advising in Stanford's status and
reward system for its faculty. At present, save

for one department that claims to adjust Its
teaching loads in proportion to advising loads,
advising is in fact extra-curricular, in that
it is supposed to be done but no one pays
much attention if it is not done. The Commit
tee is informed that advisers receive extra
pay in some universities, and it has discussed
whether bonus pay would be an incentive to
better advising. We are not satisfied that it
would. We have also asked how a faculty
member's advising effectiveness might be a
factor in his promotion and salary increment.
Nothing would please the Committee more
than to be shown a method of accurate evalua
tion of this effectiveness, so that it could be
used as one among other determinants. We
have yet to find a method. Even if the stu
dent were to choose his adviser, one could not
determine the adviser's effectiveness merely
by counting the number of his advisees.
The Committee believes that advising will
be able to play a role in the status and re
ward system only if the faculty becomes so
committed to the advising function (which,
for the Committee, is integral to the educa
tional function) that the very commitment
produces a means of reward. The faculty
must decide that advising is important, and
the faculty at large must expend some energy
in advising. Pressure probably ought to be
exerted on those of our colleagues who would
rather not advise students, although the very
reluctant adviser will likely not be a very
good one. Perhaps, in considerations of reward
and promotion, nothing more than a negative
question can be asked. If a brilliant research
er does no advising, can his research contribu
tions outweigh the absence of his contribu
tion to the University's humanity? In some in
stances, the answer might have to be "No."
So far as the Committee knows, the question
has never been asked.
Advising in the professor's profession. The
Committee has expressed its conviction that
advising students is properly a part of the
educational profession, that such an as
sumption ought if possible to be an element
in consideration of reward. We suggest, more
over, that prospective faculty appointees be
informed of advising obligations of Stanford
faculty members. We would also suggest a
more long-range way of achieving the actuality
of this assumption. It has often been pointed
out that among the weakest aspects of grad
uate education today is the failure to prepare
people for their profession. Graduate students
are trained to do research, but many of them
are hired to be teachers and members of fac
ulties. We do not wish to underplay research.
But too little is done to train those of our grad
uate students who will become teachers for
their actual professional functions. The Com
mittee suggests the advisability of instruc
tion for graduate students in the scope of the
objectives and responsibilities of their chosen
profession, which will help them comprehend
the expectations under which they will work.
Such instruction could go a long way toward
making actual the ideal that professors are
engaged in education, an activity that includes
research and publication, classroom teach
ing, and the education of individual students
outside of formal instruction that advising
ought to be. When education in that sense be
comes the basic assumption of the University's

life, we will be on the way toward the fulfill
ment of our humanity.

Epilogue:
Enablement and
Surveillance
It is hoped that in such a relatively casual
and self selecting system as that proposed
above, the quiet and unspectacular job that
needs to be done will proceed. But responsibili
ty for watching it must be lodged somewhere
more specific than in the hearts and minds of
the 20,000-odd souls of the Stanford commun
ity. There needs to be improved liaison among
agencies, assurance that stated functions are
being fulfilled, exhortation if not pressure
for participation in both given and receiving.
It was suggested, half jocularly, in the Com
mittee that what is wanted is a "University
humane ofTice.'The term is simplistic, but the
thought is precise. To indicate, to itself and
everyone else, that Stanford means its hu
manity, the responsibility should be assumed
by a highly placed officer, of at least Associate
Provost rank, whose responsibilities would in
clude the coordination of advising and coun
seling structures.
The Committee remains uncertain whether
the responsibility should be added to those
carried by the Dean of Students, whether it
should be assigned to a Dean of Undergraduate
Educationâ€”should such a position be rein
statedâ€”or whether a new position should be
created. In favor of the first is the fact that
the Dean of Students is now responsible for
several agencies in which counseling and ad
vising take place. On the other hand, the ed
ucational thrust of the entire program might
suggest that the responsibility be held by a
distinctly academic officer such as a Dean of
Undergraduate Education. At the same time,
the fact that advising and counseling must af
fect graduate as well as undergraduate stu
dents makes desirable that the officer not be
exclusively occupied with undergraduates.
Whoever such a person might be, and what
ever his title, he must be accessible to and
trustable by students, command the respect
and attract the cooperation of the faculty, and
display remarkable virtues to non-academic
staff persons.

This paper is presented to the University
community by the Committee on Advising and
Couast'lint; of the Study of Education at Stan
ford. It is important to say tliat the paper is
intended not as a recommendation for immedi
ate decision hut as some proposals for discus
sion.
Hearings will take place 7 9 p.m. Tuesday
and 4-fi p.m. Wednesday in room 143 of Meyer
Library. Members of the committee will be
present to receive comments on the paper. The
Committee also welcomes written responses to
the SES office, Meyer Library.
Few subjects are so frequently the target of
criticism as advising, few so rarely the object
of constructive suggestion. Widespread agree
ment thai advising is not very well done at
Stanford is equalled by imprecision as to the
problem and feasible solutions. Our realism
breeds cynicism, concluding that we must ac
cept inadequacy.
The Committee on Advising and Counseling
of the Study of Education at Stanford has at
tempted to be realistic but not cynical. Mow
ever unlikely the radical alteration of human
nature may be, the alteration of perspectives
and priorities is well within our reach. The
Committee urges the University's members,
however, that unless assumptions are modi
fied the cynics will he proven right. Foremost
among the assumptions that require adjust
ment is the tacit one that for a faculty mem
ber advising is an extracurricular activity.
This assumption produces hesitance on the
part of many students to consult advisers ex
cept for routine card-signing for fear of "tak
ing up his time," and their resultant complaint
that advising at Stanford is nothing but rou
tine. It produces the perception on the part of
faculty members that advising, except for one's
"own" special (preferably graduate) students,
is a chore to be avoided if possible and to be
disposed of quickly if avoidance is not possible.
It produces among administrators complete ig
norance of inequities in advising loads and the
ignoring of the function of advising in con
siderations of appointment, promotion, and re
ward.
The Committee is not so blindered as to sup
pose that advising is the most important as
pect of university life. But it is sensitive to
the penetration of aspects of advising into al
most everything Stanford does, from admis
sions to residence policy to undergraduate and
graduate curriculum to student services to the
extra-curriculum to placement and vocational
decisions. In what follows we have made some
assumption that bear explication. First, we
suppose that advising has basically to do with
the possibility of significant relations and com
munication between persons, that it sums up
what we intend by our sub-title: "the humani
ty of the University." Second, we assume that
the educational direction Stanford is taking
will entail more advising, not less, on both
graduate and undergraduate levels, and a high
er degree of humanity, not a lower. Third, we
assume that, since no system is perfect, an ar
rangement of advising that allows several
quite different forms and structures of advis
ing to take place will come closer to self-re
newal than a single, potentially rigid system.
The problem, as we presently see it, has
three points of focus: 1. the dissemination to
everyone who needs it of accurate and com
plete information; 2. the availability to anyone
who needs it of competent professional coun
seling; 3. the accessibility to all students of
Interested and personal academic advice.
I. Dissemination
of Information
The story about the man who did not have
enough information to take instruction is rele
vant to the problem of advising. The Commit
tee believes that adequate and accurate infor
mation on most matters regarding the Univer
sity is readily available to those who wish and
need to have it. Ignorance and misinformation
are widespread, however, some of it difficult
to understand.
The information that needs dissemination is
that which makes possible (1) awareness on
the part of faculty and students alike of exact
ly what the University's communal and aca
demic facilities are; (2) access by members of
the University to the various services provid
ed; (3) informed decisions about academic
matters on the part of students.
A great deal of this information can be and
is conveyed in print, but people forget things
when they read them in almost unnumerable
bulletins, pamphlets, brochures, hand-bills, mi
meographed or dittoed sheets, and the like.
The variety is compounded by the fact that
certain published materials are factual in na
ture and others are more propagandists in
tone and purpose, by the fact that some infor
mation is obsolete before it is ever printed and
some is incomplete.
The Committee suggests basic simplification
into two yearly publications. One is an expand
ed version of the present rather slim Informa
tion Bulletin, to serve as a more general hand
book to the University. Here should be de
tailed information on matters not covered in
Courses and Degrees: fees and expenses, resi
dences, relatively permanent organizations and
activities both student and University-wide,
services available to the community such as
those of the Health Service, the Counseling
and Testing Center, the Bechtel International
Center, and others. Also in such a handbook
might be found brief descriptions of the ad
ministrative operation of the University, the
duties and powers of its various officers, and
policies affecting various of its members.
Through such a publication, which should be
routinely in the hands of everyone, both stu
dents and faculty could find how to get help
for all kinds of problems. New students and
new faculty members in particular would, with

its aid, more easily find their ways in the Uni
versity.
Parenthetically, the Committee also sees a
need for a faculty handbook, which would in
form faculty members of such policies of ap
pointment, promotion, tenure, and administra
tive arrangement as are especially relevant to
them.
The Committee wishes, moreover, that Cour
ses and I)egre<>s might he improved. The in
formation in it is frequently obsolete before
the book comes off the press. Might there not
be in the den of someone at Stanford printing
methods that could reduce the lag between
copy deadlines and publication? Would the
improvement of accuracy allowed by an Aug
ust publication date outweigh the advantage
for incoming students of the present May pub
lication? Students and advisers alike now hesi
tate to use Courses and Degrees as a basis
for planning the work of even a single year in
advance. The Committee wonders, then, wheth
er usefulness for planning to those already
here should not have priority over usefulness
for those about to come. In the light of the in
creasing need for advanced academic planning
by students, greater accuracy becomes even
more desirable. Moreover, if Courses and De
grees wore improved and up-dated, the expense
of the quarterly Time Schedule might be re
duced by making it no more than a supple
ment to Courses and Degrees.
All of these publications would bo of im
mense help to advisers and their advisees. The
Committee is of the opinion that the adviser's
function should not be to disseminate informa
tion that the student can more readily receive
otherwise. In saying that, we take full cog
nizance of the high likelihood that anything in
print will be misunderstood, misconstrued, or
misused somewhere by someone. Where the
adviser perceives ignorance, he must, of
course, rectify itâ€”and the student may do the
same. The adviser will function well with an
advisee when both have the necessary infor
mation, for then the adviser is free to advise
instead of merely to inform.
Concomitantly, the Committee believes that
the adviser should be relieved of policing cur
ricular regulations. So much of academic ad
vising is taken up with routine questions about
the fulfillment of requirements (How many
units of Science have you left to take? How
much math? etc.) that time for genuine and
personalized advice is too often at a premium.
The Committee has a hunch, moreover, (1)
that on the whole students know the require
ments in General Studies and in major pro
grams better than their advisers do, and (2)
that students almost always know exactly
where they stand with regard to those require
ments. The Committee wonders about the feas
ibility of computerizing information of these
kinds to enable easy retrieval. If machines can
free us for the improvement of our humanity,
we should by all means use them.
In short, the Committee believes that advis
ing could be far better focussed on advice if
the dissemination of information were both
simplified and improved, so that the adviser
does not have to be a traffic cop of regulations.
11. Availability
of Counseling
For clarity of terminology, we use the term
"counseling" to mean the impartation of help
for problems of a personal sort, not immediate
ly involving the academic, while "advising" is
restricted in this paper to academic advice.
It is certainly the case that a great deal of
counseling in this sense occurs in any commu
nity as large and as complex as Stanford. Most
of it is casual, among close friends, and with
no pretense of professional expertise. This
sort of counseling will happen whether the
institution encourages or discourages it. Any
attempt to structure such relationships is, of
course, doomed to failure. Faculty members
also do a great deal of counseling of this kind.
Though some may criticize the non-profession
al nature of such counseling, that may in itself
bo one of the'strengths of the relationship. At
the same time, situations frequently arise
where professional counseling is needed and
any casual counselor should always have in
mind the possibility of referring someone to
sources of professional aid. The Committee has
not conceived of any way by which faculty or
other such occasional counselors might cus
tomarily be taught how to recognize danger
signals, but they should be aware of an obli
gation to suggest referral.
Nevertheless, sources of professional coun
seling are present at Stanford, and the Com
mittee has been surprise that some members
of the University, both faculty and students,
seem unaware of them. Apart from the coun
seling done in residences < faculty residents,
residence directors, resident assistants, tutors,
and sponsors), which would have to be called
at best semi-professional, counseling done by
campus religious representatives, and that
done in special circumstances by persons in
the Dean of Students' office, the University
maintains two major sources of professional
counseling and a third that might become one.
We refer in the first instance to the Counsel
ing and Testing Center and to the psychiatric
services of the Cowell Health Center, and in
the second instance to the Placement Service.
The Counseling and Testing Center provides
psychological testing of many kinds and both
short-range and long-range psychological coun
seling. The psychiatric staff of the Cowell
Health Center is available for psychiatric con
sultation and some forms of therapy, and pa
tients in need of long-range therapy are re
ferred to psychiatrists in the School of Medi
cine for it.
The Committee has no wish to enter into the
relative merits of these two approaches, be
lieving that both meet various kinds of situ
ations helpfully. The liaison between the Conn

soling and Testing Center and the Cowell
Health reportedly good and getting
better. Such liaison and cooperation should be
encouraged by the University administration.
The fact that a relatively small proportion of
Stanford students uses the counseling services
in these two institutions may be an index of
the community's relatively healthy mental
state. On the other hand, experience hÂ°re and
in other universities would seem to indicate
that there are many more problems than are
actually met by these services. Larger staffs
would doubtless encourage more students with
real problems to seek aid.
It has been rightly observed that while any
person lacks the medical or psychological
help he needs, the job of counseling is not be
ing properly done. One of our faculty col
leagues recently stated that "One student sui
cide per year is one too many," a sentiment
with which no one could quarrel. But preven
tion in the realm of counseling is the most
difficult task. For one thing, it requires the
willing cooperation of the patient or subject.
The continued excellence and improvement
of these two services seems to the Committee,
however, a matter of rather high priority. We
are in a period where the mental strains upon
the age group of Stanford students are great
and on the increase. It is no pampering mood
that leads to the conclusion that professional
aid is needed; it is rather the sense of urgency
that informs higher education, and the wish
that barriers to the best education every stu
dent is capable of absorbing be as far as possi
ble thrown down. We do not believe that the
improvement of, say, the Counseling and Test
ing Center is more important than the im
provement of the faculty. But believing in the
priority of the academic, we wish it to be aided
by the best medical and psychological services
Stanford can afford to render.
We have few specific recommendations,
apart from general improvementâ€”which In
itself ought not to be taken as underhanded
criticism. The first contact with the Counsel
ing and Testing Center ought to make clear
to entering students that genuine personal
counsel may be had there. We are dubious
that the orientation-week testing is a good in
troduction for students, valuable as the re
sults may be for staff research. The counsel
ing function should be made more distinct
from that of legitimate research.
The most difficult question with which the
Committee has long wrestled is how to be
sure that the people who need the help receive
it. To that question, we have no satisfactory
answer. The availability of the services should
b" widely publicized and accurately described.
Every member of the University should know
about them. But the person who refuses to
seek help when he needs it can not, by any
means the Committee has been able to discov
er, be forced to have it.
The Committee notes with satisfaction the
recent improvements in the situation of reli
gious ministries on the campus. Although not
every religious tradition is officially repre
sented, persons desiring counseling of a reli
gious sort have access to a broad range of
clergymen and denominational representatives.
Since campus office space was made available
to denominational representatives, the work
of the Pean of the Chapel and his assistant
and of the University Chaplain has been en
larged by cooperation. To those who doubt the
propriety of the presence of clergymen on a
university campus, the Committee would say
that the day when religious bodies looked on
the ministry to students as a salvage operation
from the godless university is long past. Safe
guards against irresponsibility in this as in
other areas of interest can be established ad
ministratively. Those members of the Univer
sity who find religious counsel helpful and nec
essary can and do seek it out.
By virtue of the fact that Selective Service
is of immediate concern to the majority of
Stanford students, the Committee has consid
ered advising facilities offered regarding the
draft. A National Service Adviser has for
some time been available. The Committee ap
plauds the addition of a counselor on con
scientious objection to the student facilities
available on campus. We anticipate that such
an office will be continued while the question
of the draft is pertinent, and suggest that the
amount of student need for such counsel re
quires the availability of more time than is
now provided. The different natures of the
counseling involved makes it advisable to keep
separate the conscientious objection counsel
ing and National Service advising. Greater co
ordination of the latter with the ROTC offices
and the Placement Service would facilitate the
answering of questions faced by many stu
dents in regard to the options available for
fulfillment of military service. However, the
effectiveness of both offices is hampered at
present by lack of information reaching the
student. Publicizing these services in the hand
book to the University proposed above, and by
whatever means are now available, and the
initiation of orientation sessions with tutors,
residence assistants, and directors may begin
to alleviate this inadequacy.
The Placement Service is kept until last be
cause the Committee believes substantial ex
pansion is possible and desirable. At present
the Placement Service is a means to bring
prospective employees into contact with pros
pective employers and to aid students to re
ceive part-time and summer jobs. With ex
pense (the Committee does not wish to guess
how much* and reorganization, the Placement
Service could become a Career Guidance Cen
ter. This change would put job interviews into
perspective as aspects of a more thorough in
vestigation by the individual of his wishes and
talents for a career. Facilities for aptitude
tests of various kinds would be needed, as well
as staff to process and counsel regarding such
tests. For this purpose, it would he well to
shift the efforts in career counseling now car
ried on by the Counseling and Testing Center
to an expanded Career Guidance Center. Infor

mation on opportunities and requisites for ca
reers of many kinds could conveniently be
gathered and sometimes produced by a Career
Guidance Center, and one might expect to find
in it the current catalogues of graduate and
professional schools across the country.
It has often been remarked that, for all the
Founders' desires that a Stanford education
should fit students for useful pursuits, the ac
cessibility of career counsel is rather slim
hÂ°re. In feeling that the situation bears im
provement the Committee does not imply that
every student should have made a clear voca
tional choice by the end of his senior year. But
students wishing to make informed and ra
tional choices of careers should have access as
early as possible to information and individual
ized counsel regarding the options. A Career
Guidance Center might have the contacts to
place students in part-time and temporary
jobs with persons in careers that the students
are considering, experience which might be
invaluable whether it be positive or negative.
Other methods of gaining insight into vari
ous kinds of professional life may likewise
gain momentum. A proposal now being con
sidered suggests the establishment of sopho
more and higher level courses on the profes
sions, taught from the perspectives of both
the humanities and the social sciences. Such
courses would be informational and descriptive
and in no sense recruitment techniques. Still
other means might be found to make available
for students bases for wise career decisions.
The present admirable advising done by facul
ty members of the School of Medicine with
and for pre-medical students could profitably
be emulated elsewhere. Could not the Schools
of Law, Business, and Education, for example,
provide similar counsel in cooperation with a
Career Guidance Center? The Committee pre
sumes that remuneration occupations will for
some time be necessary for most members of
American society. There is point, therefore, to
the thought that education can be useful, even
though that is far from being the whole point
of education.
111. Academic
Advising
If personal counseling is very largely done
casually and by amateurs, so is academic ad
vising. Most of the advising done at Stanford
is done by one undergraduate to another. The
Committee heartily approves this state of af
fairs at the same time that it is not satisfied
to abandon faculty advising.
Student Advising. Several aspects of under
graduate advising are carried by undergradu
ates. Students get their best information about
the value of specific courses from other stu
dents who have taken them. This is only natu
ral. Faculty members are loath to comment
on their colleagues, for reasons of professional
propriety; students are not. Moreover, faculty
members can talk about courses taught by
their colleagues only by hearsay, where stu
dents can speak at first hand. Such informal
advising is valuable, even though it is fre
quently biased. Sporadic attempts have been
made to bring it usefully into published form,
with such documents as the Course Review,
succeeding the earlier "Scratch Sheet." The
Committee applauds the concept of a student
Course Review as a valuable asset to advising,
and wishes that it might be thorough in its
coverage of courses, representative of a varie
ty of student reactions, and sensitive to stated
aims of professors in courses. Such a review
would also inform professors helpfully about
responses to the courses. The Course Review
ought to appear regularly, with cooperation
and financial assistance from the University
but without administrative control.
A recent experiment in appointing students
as advisers-at-large in their major departments
produced uncertain results. The fault may lie
partially in a lack of information about the
program, in student suspicion that student
advisers would be "administration types," in
students' feelings that they could get as good
advice from their friendsâ€”or in any possible
combination of those and other factors. The
Committee is not satisfied that student de
partmental advising is a bad idea, especially
on the basis of one year's experiment in three
departments. It exhorts departments and
schools to keep trying to find ways of taking
advantage of students' advising abilities.
The function of the adviser. We have already
expressed the Committee's suggestion that ad
vising not be simply a matter of policing, of
making sure that the student has information
and is taking the courses he is required to
take. The Adviser's Handbook describes the
goal of advising as bringing "the student to
the point where he can assume a maximum
amount of responsibility for his own academic
program and can make wise decisions on his
own" (p. 12). The Committee wishes to go be
yond that to propose that the adviser be
viewed both by the student and by himself as
the student's academic advocate, the particular
educator who agrees to concern himself with
his advisee's best education. This means prin
cipally that the adviser wishes to help the
student plan an educational career that goes
somewhere, that has coherence and point to it,
rather than being a miscellaneous collection
of requirements and aimless electives. If the
adviser is the student's advocate, however, this
coherence must be a means of enabling the
student's wishes and strengths to be embodied
in his program, not a way for the adviser to
impose his own concepts on the student.
Such a concept would, to he sure, produce
advising that takes more time, for carefully
considering with a student his academic ob
jectives and intellectual curiosities consumes
more time that simply signing his card. But if
such advising is understood and underscored
by tin 1 faculty as integral 1o education, faculty
members may more happily engage in it. It

poses several problems, among which is the
acceptance of advising as a normal aspect of
academic appointment at Stanford. If such
advising will not be done by the faculty, some
one must do it. In the absence of good faculty
advising, a corps of professional advisers
would probably have to be retained to the dam
age of the budget and of the academic exper
tise with which advising ought to be done. On
all counts, the Committee emphatically prefers
faculty advising.
The student's stake in advising. A curious
duality is sometimes to be observed among
students. On the one hand, they firmly ob
ject to be treated as ciphers or as children by
an institution standing in loco parentis. On
the other .they wish the advice of their elders
among the faculty, and this wish is sometimes
Indistinguishable from a desire for a parent
surrogate. Occasionally, when the advice given
is not to an individual's liking, he will pro
test that he is not being respected. We point
this out in part to say that the students' own
view of their stake in advising is not crystal
clear.
Although the student knows more about
himself than any adviser is ever likely to
know, he needs advising because he has not
enough experience of education to know pre
cisely how to join his interests and talents
to a curricular regimen. This observation ap
plies equally, though in different perspectives,
to undergraduates and graduate students. The
student looks to an adviser for guidance in
pursuing an education that will take ad
vantage of his interests and lead him beyond
his own provincial boundaries, at the same
time that it is certifiable by the University as
meeting its standards. The University, of
course, must determine what those standards
are, since it is the body doing the certifying.
The adviser stands toward the student in the
peculiar position of being at once a represen
tative of the University's power of sanction
upon the student (he makes judgments on stu
dents' performance) and and the advocate of
that particula student in the acquisition of his
most effective education.
If the structure of degree requirements on
the graduate level becomes less prescriptive,
the premium on interested advising which
aids the student toward coherence as well as
adventuresomeness will rise. Experience will
count for much in a student's planning, al
though it should not be prescriptively applied.
What is at stake for the student in a more flex
ible under-graduate program is precisely the
humanity of an adviser who is genuinely the
student's educational advocate. If the program
is flexible, advocacy need not consist in find
ing ways to circumvent regulations.
The levels of advising and their problems.
Special and different problems of advising ob
tain for freshmen, transfers, upperclass un
dergraduates and departmental majors, and
graduate students. At the same time, the Com
mittee is convinced of one true observation:
the best advising takes place where advisee
and adviser have some kind of common bond,
beyond the routine. This may be the bond of
the same field of study (the normal pre-set
bond between graduate students and faculty),
some common experience (frequently that the
student has taken the faculty member's
course), or prior acquaintance.
From this standpoint, the advising of fresh
men is the most difficult task, for freshmen
rarely have any existing bond to a faculty
member. It must be established. The Commit
tee has been divided upon several possible ways
to handle freshman advising. That the faculty
should carry the bulk of the advising seems
wise, yet a student's assigned adviser only
rarely turns out to be important or helpful
to him. As the freshman year curriculum now
stands, freshmen rarely come into close con
tact with faculty members, except those al
-most as transient as themselves: English
TA's, Western Civ instructors, lab TA's, and
beginning math and language TA's. The In
crease of Freshman seminars may improve
the range of faculty contact. The plans of
assigning advisers to groups in living units
has been extremely spotty in its effectiveness,
and it suffers from the fact that the advisers
remain abstractly faculty members, rather
than being perceived in their active teaching
roles. Relationships of freshman to faculty
residents or directors of living units, to tutors,
and to sponsors are relatively close, and these
persons in fact do the bulk of freshman ad
vising. The Trancos experiment is one possible
model of freshman advising, where residence
director, sponsors and tutors, and a team of
faculty advisers work closely together. Fresh
man advising ought to aid in the orientation
of the entering student, j.etting him off on the
right foot, proposing seriously that he identify
areas of genuine intellectual interest. Such
advising should prepare the student to find
a permanent academic adviser as he goes.
The Committee is unanimous in suggesting
that advising will become more effective from
all sides if the student ultimately chooses his
own adviser. In fact this frequently happens
now, except that the adviser whom the stu
dent chooses is often not the one responsible
for signing his card. We see the following
arguments in favor of this idea: 1. The stu
dent will most likely choose a faculty mem
ber whom he has seen in action, knows some
thing of his qualities and the "cut of his jib."
2. Such a relationship would underscore the
obligation of both student and adviser for
tion in which the student is interested and
tion In which the student is interested an
which makes coherent academic sense of his
interests and career plans. (The Committee
believes, parenthetically, that changing ad
visers and programs ought to be quite easy,
with no prejudice attached to it.) 3. If the
structure of the freshman year becomes less
prescribed, freshmen will have access to a
broader range of course options and of faculty
members than is now the case and will be
more likely to identify someone with whom
they believe they can work.
Certain problems with this arrangement can
be foreseen. 1. Some very popular professors
will be swamped with advisees, and other fac
ulty members will have few or none. To this
the Committee would propose that limitations
on the number of advisees per faculty member
be administratively established (see below.) 2.
Understaffed departments will have too many
majors to observe the limitations, and will have
to continue assigning majors to advisers. To
this the Committee proposes that the student's
adviser need not, though he may, be in the stu
dent's own major department. If the adviser is
not charged to keep track of regulations, it is
not at all unlikely that a professor in one de
partment can help a student in another to pur
sue a course that both meets the standards laid
down by the department and satisfies the stu
dent's own academic needs and wants. Depart
ments might require countersignature of study
cards by departmental representatives. Any
student seriously wishing to become a his
torian, for example, will probably try to find
a historian as adviser in order to get help in
preparing to be like him. We recognize that
in some programs, e.g. Philosophy and the
Honors Program in Humanities, the adviser
docs considerable tutoring of the student in
his senior year. This does not seem to us in
compatible with the basic premise. We are in
clined, on the undergraduate level, to resist
departmental "imperialism," which demands
control over "its" students. An undergraduate
major need not, after all, be occupational prep
aration, but, especially in the Humanities and
Social Sciences, is rather a point of co
herence for one's entire liberal education. Stu
dents who wish strong identification with a
discipline or department may gain it by choos
ing advisers there. Students who do not want
such a concentration may be well served by
advisers from almost anywhere in the Uni
versity.
Such a plan would introduce a differentia
tion between freshman and upperclass advis
ing, in place of the present differentiation be
tween General Studies and major advising.
The Committee is inclined to believe that the
former differentiation would make all advis
ing more effective with regard to general ed
ucation. We are not yet agreed as to the time
when a student must have chosen his adviser.
Some might stay with the person to whom they
were assigned as freshmen; others would find
an adviser during the freshman year; still
others during the sophomore year. Some stu
dents might have three or four different ad
visers during their careers. We see no compel
ing reason why that should be forbidden,
though frequent changes may be a signal that
counseling of some kind is needed. As at pres
ent, students will continue to seek out advice
from faculty members whom they like and
trust, no matter who is the officially designated
adviser. The present suggestion is intended to
take advantage of that fact of life.
The advising of graduate students might
seem to be self-evident. No one except grad
uate students themselves seems to feel it a
problem. Some responsibilities which many

departments seem not to handle well with
graduate students are the following: (1) intro
ducing new students to the University; (2) in
forming students about and channeling them,
when need is present, to the Counseling and
Testing Center, Cowell Halth Service, the
Placement Service, etc.; (3) giving students
vocational advice and sometimes placing them;
(4) informing new students about housing pos
sibilities and problems; (5) informing students
about useful training obtainable on a reg
ular basis in other departments. The pro
blem here is different from that of under
graduates in that the graduate student is
earnestly in the process of professional prep
aration. There is a certain emulative aspect to
graduate study, therefore, because many grad
uate students (certainly not nearly 100%) are
working with people with whom they expect
ultimately to become colleagues. It seems to
us probable that at present graduate students
select their own advisers to an extent that un
dergraduate do not. The function of faculty in
attracting graduate students to any university
assures that the potential of full relationships
is present. A stronger administrative surveil
lance of graduate advising might help to over
come the deficiences of individual departments.
Some special problems. Three groups of stu
dents present special problems to which the
Committee does not yet have answers. It is
clear that transfer students could use far bet
ter help on arrival than most of them get. It is
also clear that their problems are different
from those faced by freshman. We believe that
transfer students should bo given high priority
for on-campus housing. It also seems to us
that the evaluation of transfer credits could
be expedited and improved in many ways.
Some faculty members might be especially en
couraged to handle transfer students. We de
sire further suggestions about the advising of
transfer students from anyone with ideas to
give.
Another group of students with problems to
which the Committee has not yet given
sufficient attention is foreign students. The
Beehtel International Center is a source of
remarkably fine personal attention to foreign
students. But this group has academic prob
lems peculiarly their own, and some made of
advising needs, we think, to be tailored to
them. Again, the Committee wishes to be
helped by ideas.
The third group is comprised of members
of minorities with special disadvantages. Ad
vising needs to have cognizance both of the
personal problems faced by such students and
of academic needs. Efforts to provide tutoring
from the Office of Financial Aids have been
sporadic, due largely to stringently limited
funds. Some more formal program of tutoring
and counsel would greatly increase the accessi
bility of an adequate Stanford education for
such students. Stanford has publicly stated its
intention to do the right thing by these per
sons. Additional support, morally and mone
tarily, needs to be provided.
The extent and rewards of advising. The
Committee believes that advising on all levels
should be taken together in figuring the aver
age ratio of advisees to advisers. Taking fig
ures in the fall Student Directory as sub

stantially correct for numbers of majors and
graduate students in the Schools and Depart
ments, and taking a count of faculty at As
sistant Professor or higher in Courses and De
grees as substantially correct (realizing that
many people in the latter are absent on leave),
and assuming that all of those faculty advise
majors and graduate students, we find the fol
lowing ratios by schools of major and grad
uate advisees to advisers:
Earth Sciences 5.8 (169/29)
Engineering 13.4 (2114A58)
Humanities & Sciences 11.7 (4739/405)
The figures for present General Studies ad
vising, however, look rather different. 115
persons are engaged in 1967-68 in General
Studies advising of 2330 students without de
clared majors, a ratio of 20.2G advisees to each
adviser. Sources of General Studies advisers
are as follows:
Earth Sciences 7 (24% of
school faculty)
Engineering 11 (6.9% of
school faculty)
Humanities & Sciences 45 (11.1% of
school faculty)
Medicine 12
Military Science 2
Physical Education 3
Education 2
Administration 33
The figures show the difficulties encountered
by the Registrar in his task of recruiting
General Studies Advisers. Only 63 ( 54.8%) of
present General Studies advisers come from
the faculties of Schools which will enroll the
advisees as majors. Moreover, only 39% of
General Studies advisers come from the School
of Humanities and Sciences, which can rea
sonably expect to enroll about 80% of un
dergraduates.
At the same time, figures received from De
partments of the School of Humanities and
Sciences show a very wide variation in the
actual advising practice of departments. Some
departments average as few as 4 departmental
advisees per adviser, whereas members of
others may have as many as 66 major ad
visees. Such a figure seems to the Committee
a mockery of the very idea of advising.
One can be only routine with that many ad
visees. The Committee is inclined to believe
that an upper limit on the number of allowable
advisees per adviser should be set, perhaps at
25 or 30, such a figure to include both grad
uate and undergraduate students. The Com
mittee also believes that Deans should ask
executive hads of departments quite search
ing questions about provisions for carrying
advising when many members of a depart
ment propose to be on leave for a given year.
One instance has been reported in which a
member of a large department finds himself
during this academic year with 89 advisees
(graduate, undergraduate major, and Gen
eral Studies) because so many of his col
league are absent on leave. If a limit on ad
visees were set and adhered to, such ex
ploitation would not be permitted.
The Committee has thought very hard about
the place of advising in Stanford's status and
reward system for its faculty. At present, save

for one department that claims to adjust Its
teaching loads in proportion to advising loads,
advising is in fact extra-curricular, in that
it is supposed to be done but no one pays
much attention if it is not done. The Commit
tee is informed that advisers receive extra
pay in some universities, and it has discussed
whether bonus pay would be an incentive to
better advising. We are not satisfied that it
would. We have also asked how a faculty
member's advising effectiveness might be a
factor in his promotion and salary increment.
Nothing would please the Committee more
than to be shown a method of accurate evalua
tion of this effectiveness, so that it could be
used as one among other determinants. We
have yet to find a method. Even if the stu
dent were to choose his adviser, one could not
determine the adviser's effectiveness merely
by counting the number of his advisees.
The Committee believes that advising will
be able to play a role in the status and re
ward system only if the faculty becomes so
committed to the advising function (which,
for the Committee, is integral to the educa
tional function) that the very commitment
produces a means of reward. The faculty
must decide that advising is important, and
the faculty at large must expend some energy
in advising. Pressure probably ought to be
exerted on those of our colleagues who would
rather not advise students, although the very
reluctant adviser will likely not be a very
good one. Perhaps, in considerations of reward
and promotion, nothing more than a negative
question can be asked. If a brilliant research
er does no advising, can his research contribu
tions outweigh the absence of his contribu
tion to the University's humanity? In some in
stances, the answer might have to be "No."
So far as the Committee knows, the question
has never been asked.
Advising in the professor's profession. The
Committee has expressed its conviction that
advising students is properly a part of the
educational profession, that such an as
sumption ought if possible to be an element
in consideration of reward. We suggest, more
over, that prospective faculty appointees be
informed of advising obligations of Stanford
faculty members. We would also suggest a
more long-range way of achieving the actuality
of this assumption. It has often been pointed
out that among the weakest aspects of grad
uate education today is the failure to prepare
people for their profession. Graduate students
are trained to do research, but many of them
are hired to be teachers and members of fac
ulties. We do not wish to underplay research.
But too little is done to train those of our grad
uate students who will become teachers for
their actual professional functions. The Com
mittee suggests the advisability of instruc
tion for graduate students in the scope of the
objectives and responsibilities of their chosen
profession, which will help them comprehend
the expectations under which they will work.
Such instruction could go a long way toward
making actual the ideal that professors are
engaged in education, an activity that includes
research and publication, classroom teach
ing, and the education of individual students
outside of formal instruction that advising
ought to be. When education in that sense be
comes the basic assumption of the University's

life, we will be on the way toward the fulfill
ment of our humanity.

Epilogue:
Enablement and
Surveillance
It is hoped that in such a relatively casual
and self selecting system as that proposed
above, the quiet and unspectacular job that
needs to be done will proceed. But responsibili
ty for watching it must be lodged somewhere
more specific than in the hearts and minds of
the 20,000-odd souls of the Stanford commun
ity. There needs to be improved liaison among
agencies, assurance that stated functions are
being fulfilled, exhortation if not pressure
for participation in both given and receiving.
It was suggested, half jocularly, in the Com
mittee that what is wanted is a "University
humane ofTice.'The term is simplistic, but the
thought is precise. To indicate, to itself and
everyone else, that Stanford means its hu
manity, the responsibility should be assumed
by a highly placed officer, of at least Associate
Provost rank, whose responsibilities would in
clude the coordination of advising and coun
seling structures.
The Committee remains uncertain whether
the responsibility should be added to those
carried by the Dean of Students, whether it
should be assigned to a Dean of Undergraduate
Educationâ€”should such a position be rein
statedâ€”or whether a new position should be
created. In favor of the first is the fact that
the Dean of Students is now responsible for
several agencies in which counseling and ad
vising take place. On the other hand, the ed
ucational thrust of the entire program might
suggest that the responsibility be held by a
distinctly academic officer such as a Dean of
Undergraduate Education. At the same time,
the fact that advising and counseling must af
fect graduate as well as undergraduate stu
dents makes desirable that the officer not be
exclusively occupied with undergraduates.
Whoever such a person might be, and what
ever his title, he must be accessible to and
trustable by students, command the respect
and attract the cooperation of the faculty, and
display remarkable virtues to non-academic
staff persons.

This paper is presented to the University
community by the Committee on Advising and
Couast'lint; of the Study of Education at Stan
ford. It is important to say tliat the paper is
intended not as a recommendation for immedi
ate decision hut as some proposals for discus
sion.
Hearings will take place 7 9 p.m. Tuesday
and 4-fi p.m. Wednesday in room 143 of Meyer
Library. Members of the committee will be
present to receive comments on the paper. The
Committee also welcomes written responses to
the SES office, Meyer Library.
Few subjects are so frequently the target of
criticism as advising, few so rarely the object
of constructive suggestion. Widespread agree
ment thai advising is not very well done at
Stanford is equalled by imprecision as to the
problem and feasible solutions. Our realism
breeds cynicism, concluding that we must ac
cept inadequacy.
The Committee on Advising and Counseling
of the Study of Education at Stanford has at
tempted to be realistic but not cynical. Mow
ever unlikely the radical alteration of human
nature may be, the alteration of perspectives
and priorities is well within our reach. The
Committee urges the University's members,
however, that unless assumptions are modi
fied the cynics will he proven right. Foremost
among the assumptions that require adjust
ment is the tacit one that for a faculty mem
ber advising is an extracurricular activity.
This assumption produces hesitance on the
part of many students to consult advisers ex
cept for routine card-signing for fear of "tak
ing up his time," and their resultant complaint
that advising at Stanford is nothing but rou
tine. It produces the perception on the part of
faculty members that advising, except for one's
"own" special (preferably graduate) students,
is a chore to be avoided if possible and to be
disposed of quickly if avoidance is not possible.
It produces among administrators complete ig
norance of inequities in advising loads and the
ignoring of the function of advising in con
siderations of appointment, promotion, and re
ward.
The Committee is not so blindered as to sup
pose that advising is the most important as
pect of university life. But it is sensitive to
the penetration of aspects of advising into al
most everything Stanford does, from admis
sions to residence policy to undergraduate and
graduate curriculum to student services to the
extra-curriculum to placement and vocational
decisions. In what follows we have made some
assumption that bear explication. First, we
suppose that advising has basically to do with
the possibility of significant relations and com
munication between persons, that it sums up
what we intend by our sub-title: "the humani
ty of the University." Second, we assume that
the educational direction Stanford is taking
will entail more advising, not less, on both
graduate and undergraduate levels, and a high
er degree of humanity, not a lower. Third, we
assume that, since no system is perfect, an ar
rangement of advising that allows several
quite different forms and structures of advis
ing to take place will come closer to self-re
newal than a single, potentially rigid system.
The problem, as we presently see it, has
three points of focus: 1. the dissemination to
everyone who needs it of accurate and com
plete information; 2. the availability to anyone
who needs it of competent professional coun
seling; 3. the accessibility to all students of
Interested and personal academic advice.
I. Dissemination
of Information
The story about the man who did not have
enough information to take instruction is rele
vant to the problem of advising. The Commit
tee believes that adequate and accurate infor
mation on most matters regarding the Univer
sity is readily available to those who wish and
need to have it. Ignorance and misinformation
are widespread, however, some of it difficult
to understand.
The information that needs dissemination is
that which makes possible (1) awareness on
the part of faculty and students alike of exact
ly what the University's communal and aca
demic facilities are; (2) access by members of
the University to the various services provid
ed; (3) informed decisions about academic
matters on the part of students.
A great deal of this information can be and
is conveyed in print, but people forget things
when they read them in almost unnumerable
bulletins, pamphlets, brochures, hand-bills, mi
meographed or dittoed sheets, and the like.
The variety is compounded by the fact that
certain published materials are factual in na
ture and others are more propagandists in
tone and purpose, by the fact that some infor
mation is obsolete before it is ever printed and
some is incomplete.
The Committee suggests basic simplification
into two yearly publications. One is an expand
ed version of the present rather slim Informa
tion Bulletin, to serve as a more general hand
book to the University. Here should be de
tailed information on matters not covered in
Courses and Degrees: fees and expenses, resi
dences, relatively permanent organizations and
activities both student and University-wide,
services available to the community such as
those of the Health Service, the Counseling
and Testing Center, the Bechtel International
Center, and others. Also in such a handbook
might be found brief descriptions of the ad
ministrative operation of the University, the
duties and powers of its various officers, and
policies affecting various of its members.
Through such a publication, which should be
routinely in the hands of everyone, both stu
dents and faculty could find how to get help
for all kinds of problems. New students and
new faculty members in particular would, with

its aid, more easily find their ways in the Uni
versity.
Parenthetically, the Committee also sees a
need for a faculty handbook, which would in
form faculty members of such policies of ap
pointment, promotion, tenure, and administra
tive arrangement as are especially relevant to
them.
The Committee wishes, moreover, that Cour
ses and I)egre<>s might he improved. The in
formation in it is frequently obsolete before
the book comes off the press. Might there not
be in the den of someone at Stanford printing
methods that could reduce the lag between
copy deadlines and publication? Would the
improvement of accuracy allowed by an Aug
ust publication date outweigh the advantage
for incoming students of the present May pub
lication? Students and advisers alike now hesi
tate to use Courses and Degrees as a basis
for planning the work of even a single year in
advance. The Committee wonders, then, wheth
er usefulness for planning to those already
here should not have priority over usefulness
for those about to come. In the light of the in
creasing need for advanced academic planning
by students, greater accuracy becomes even
more desirable. Moreover, if Courses and De
grees wore improved and up-dated, the expense
of the quarterly Time Schedule might be re
duced by making it no more than a supple
ment to Courses and Degrees.
All of these publications would bo of im
mense help to advisers and their advisees. The
Committee is of the opinion that the adviser's
function should not be to disseminate informa
tion that the student can more readily receive
otherwise. In saying that, we take full cog
nizance of the high likelihood that anything in
print will be misunderstood, misconstrued, or
misused somewhere by someone. Where the
adviser perceives ignorance, he must, of
course, rectify itâ€”and the student may do the
same. The adviser will function well with an
advisee when both have the necessary infor
mation, for then the adviser is free to advise
instead of merely to inform.
Concomitantly, the Committee believes that
the adviser should be relieved of policing cur
ricular regulations. So much of academic ad
vising is taken up with routine questions about
the fulfillment of requirements (How many
units of Science have you left to take? How
much math? etc.) that time for genuine and
personalized advice is too often at a premium.
The Committee has a hunch, moreover, (1)
that on the whole students know the require
ments in General Studies and in major pro
grams better than their advisers do, and (2)
that students almost always know exactly
where they stand with regard to those require
ments. The Committee wonders about the feas
ibility of computerizing information of these
kinds to enable easy retrieval. If machines can
free us for the improvement of our humanity,
we should by all means use them.
In short, the Committee believes that advis
ing could be far better focussed on advice if
the dissemination of information were both
simplified and improved, so that the adviser
does not have to be a traffic cop of regulations.
11. Availability
of Counseling
For clarity of terminology, we use the term
"counseling" to mean the impartation of help
for problems of a personal sort, not immediate
ly involving the academic, while "advising" is
restricted in this paper to academic advice.
It is certainly the case that a great deal of
counseling in this sense occurs in any commu
nity as large and as complex as Stanford. Most
of it is casual, among close friends, and with
no pretense of professional expertise. This
sort of counseling will happen whether the
institution encourages or discourages it. Any
attempt to structure such relationships is, of
course, doomed to failure. Faculty members
also do a great deal of counseling of this kind.
Though some may criticize the non-profession
al nature of such counseling, that may in itself
bo one of the'strengths of the relationship. At
the same time, situations frequently arise
where professional counseling is needed and
any casual counselor should always have in
mind the possibility of referring someone to
sources of professional aid. The Committee has
not conceived of any way by which faculty or
other such occasional counselors might cus
tomarily be taught how to recognize danger
signals, but they should be aware of an obli
gation to suggest referral.
Nevertheless, sources of professional coun
seling are present at Stanford, and the Com
mittee has been surprise that some members
of the University, both faculty and students,
seem unaware of them. Apart from the coun
seling done in residences < faculty residents,
residence directors, resident assistants, tutors,
and sponsors), which would have to be called
at best semi-professional, counseling done by
campus religious representatives, and that
done in special circumstances by persons in
the Dean of Students' office, the University
maintains two major sources of professional
counseling and a third that might become one.
We refer in the first instance to the Counsel
ing and Testing Center and to the psychiatric
services of the Cowell Health Center, and in
the second instance to the Placement Service.
The Counseling and Testing Center provides
psychological testing of many kinds and both
short-range and long-range psychological coun
seling. The psychiatric staff of the Cowell
Health Center is available for psychiatric con
sultation and some forms of therapy, and pa
tients in need of long-range therapy are re
ferred to psychiatrists in the School of Medi
cine for it.
The Committee has no wish to enter into the
relative merits of these two approaches, be
lieving that both meet various kinds of situ
ations helpfully. The liaison between the Conn

soling and Testing Center and the Cowell
Health reportedly good and getting
better. Such liaison and cooperation should be
encouraged by the University administration.
The fact that a relatively small proportion of
Stanford students uses the counseling services
in these two institutions may be an index of
the community's relatively healthy mental
state. On the other hand, experience hÂ°re and
in other universities would seem to indicate
that there are many more problems than are
actually met by these services. Larger staffs
would doubtless encourage more students with
real problems to seek aid.
It has been rightly observed that while any
person lacks the medical or psychological
help he needs, the job of counseling is not be
ing properly done. One of our faculty col
leagues recently stated that "One student sui
cide per year is one too many," a sentiment
with which no one could quarrel. But preven
tion in the realm of counseling is the most
difficult task. For one thing, it requires the
willing cooperation of the patient or subject.
The continued excellence and improvement
of these two services seems to the Committee,
however, a matter of rather high priority. We
are in a period where the mental strains upon
the age group of Stanford students are great
and on the increase. It is no pampering mood
that leads to the conclusion that professional
aid is needed; it is rather the sense of urgency
that informs higher education, and the wish
that barriers to the best education every stu
dent is capable of absorbing be as far as possi
ble thrown down. We do not believe that the
improvement of, say, the Counseling and Test
ing Center is more important than the im
provement of the faculty. But believing in the
priority of the academic, we wish it to be aided
by the best medical and psychological services
Stanford can afford to render.
We have few specific recommendations,
apart from general improvementâ€”which In
itself ought not to be taken as underhanded
criticism. The first contact with the Counsel
ing and Testing Center ought to make clear
to entering students that genuine personal
counsel may be had there. We are dubious
that the orientation-week testing is a good in
troduction for students, valuable as the re
sults may be for staff research. The counsel
ing function should be made more distinct
from that of legitimate research.
The most difficult question with which the
Committee has long wrestled is how to be
sure that the people who need the help receive
it. To that question, we have no satisfactory
answer. The availability of the services should
b" widely publicized and accurately described.
Every member of the University should know
about them. But the person who refuses to
seek help when he needs it can not, by any
means the Committee has been able to discov
er, be forced to have it.
The Committee notes with satisfaction the
recent improvements in the situation of reli
gious ministries on the campus. Although not
every religious tradition is officially repre
sented, persons desiring counseling of a reli
gious sort have access to a broad range of
clergymen and denominational representatives.
Since campus office space was made available
to denominational representatives, the work
of the Pean of the Chapel and his assistant
and of the University Chaplain has been en
larged by cooperation. To those who doubt the
propriety of the presence of clergymen on a
university campus, the Committee would say
that the day when religious bodies looked on
the ministry to students as a salvage operation
from the godless university is long past. Safe
guards against irresponsibility in this as in
other areas of interest can be established ad
ministratively. Those members of the Univer
sity who find religious counsel helpful and nec
essary can and do seek it out.
By virtue of the fact that Selective Service
is of immediate concern to the majority of
Stanford students, the Committee has consid
ered advising facilities offered regarding the
draft. A National Service Adviser has for
some time been available. The Committee ap
plauds the addition of a counselor on con
scientious objection to the student facilities
available on campus. We anticipate that such
an office will be continued while the question
of the draft is pertinent, and suggest that the
amount of student need for such counsel re
quires the availability of more time than is
now provided. The different natures of the
counseling involved makes it advisable to keep
separate the conscientious objection counsel
ing and National Service advising. Greater co
ordination of the latter with the ROTC offices
and the Placement Service would facilitate the
answering of questions faced by many stu
dents in regard to the options available for
fulfillment of military service. However, the
effectiveness of both offices is hampered at
present by lack of information reaching the
student. Publicizing these services in the hand
book to the University proposed above, and by
whatever means are now available, and the
initiation of orientation sessions with tutors,
residence assistants, and directors may begin
to alleviate this inadequacy.
The Placement Service is kept until last be
cause the Committee believes substantial ex
pansion is possible and desirable. At present
the Placement Service is a means to bring
prospective employees into contact with pros
pective employers and to aid students to re
ceive part-time and summer jobs. With ex
pense (the Committee does not wish to guess
how much* and reorganization, the Placement
Service could become a Career Guidance Cen
ter. This change would put job interviews into
perspective as aspects of a more thorough in
vestigation by the individual of his wishes and
talents for a career. Facilities for aptitude
tests of various kinds would be needed, as well
as staff to process and counsel regarding such
tests. For this purpose, it would he well to
shift the efforts in career counseling now car
ried on by the Counseling and Testing Center
to an expanded Career Guidance Center. Infor

mation on opportunities and requisites for ca
reers of many kinds could conveniently be
gathered and sometimes produced by a Career
Guidance Center, and one might expect to find
in it the current catalogues of graduate and
professional schools across the country.
It has often been remarked that, for all the
Founders' desires that a Stanford education
should fit students for useful pursuits, the ac
cessibility of career counsel is rather slim
hÂ°re. In feeling that the situation bears im
provement the Committee does not imply that
every student should have made a clear voca
tional choice by the end of his senior year. But
students wishing to make informed and ra
tional choices of careers should have access as
early as possible to information and individual
ized counsel regarding the options. A Career
Guidance Center might have the contacts to
place students in part-time and temporary
jobs with persons in careers that the students
are considering, experience which might be
invaluable whether it be positive or negative.
Other methods of gaining insight into vari
ous kinds of professional life may likewise
gain momentum. A proposal now being con
sidered suggests the establishment of sopho
more and higher level courses on the profes
sions, taught from the perspectives of both
the humanities and the social sciences. Such
courses would be informational and descriptive
and in no sense recruitment techniques. Still
other means might be found to make available
for students bases for wise career decisions.
The present admirable advising done by facul
ty members of the School of Medicine with
and for pre-medical students could profitably
be emulated elsewhere. Could not the Schools
of Law, Business, and Education, for example,
provide similar counsel in cooperation with a
Career Guidance Center? The Committee pre
sumes that remuneration occupations will for
some time be necessary for most members of
American society. There is point, therefore, to
the thought that education can be useful, even
though that is far from being the whole point
of education.
111. Academic
Advising
If personal counseling is very largely done
casually and by amateurs, so is academic ad
vising. Most of the advising done at Stanford
is done by one undergraduate to another. The
Committee heartily approves this state of af
fairs at the same time that it is not satisfied
to abandon faculty advising.
Student Advising. Several aspects of under
graduate advising are carried by undergradu
ates. Students get their best information about
the value of specific courses from other stu
dents who have taken them. This is only natu
ral. Faculty members are loath to comment
on their colleagues, for reasons of professional
propriety; students are not. Moreover, faculty
members can talk about courses taught by
their colleagues only by hearsay, where stu
dents can speak at first hand. Such informal
advising is valuable, even though it is fre
quently biased. Sporadic attempts have been
made to bring it usefully into published form,
with such documents as the Course Review,
succeeding the earlier "Scratch Sheet." The
Committee applauds the concept of a student
Course Review as a valuable asset to advising,
and wishes that it might be thorough in its
coverage of courses, representative of a varie
ty of student reactions, and sensitive to stated
aims of professors in courses. Such a review
would also inform professors helpfully about
responses to the courses. The Course Review
ought to appear regularly, with cooperation
and financial assistance from the University
but without administrative control.
A recent experiment in appointing students
as advisers-at-large in their major departments
produced uncertain results. The fault may lie
partially in a lack of information about the
program, in student suspicion that student
advisers would be "administration types," in
students' feelings that they could get as good
advice from their friendsâ€”or in any possible
combination of those and other factors. The
Committee is not satisfied that student de
partmental advising is a bad idea, especially
on the basis of one year's experiment in three
departments. It exhorts departments and
schools to keep trying to find ways of taking
advantage of students' advising abilities.
The function of the adviser. We have already
expressed the Committee's suggestion that ad
vising not be simply a matter of policing, of
making sure that the student has information
and is taking the courses he is required to
take. The Adviser's Handbook describes the
goal of advising as bringing "the student to
the point where he can assume a maximum
amount of responsibility for his own academic
program and can make wise decisions on his
own" (p. 12). The Committee wishes to go be
yond that to propose that the adviser be
viewed both by the student and by himself as
the student's academic advocate, the particular
educator who agrees to concern himself with
his advisee's best education. This means prin
cipally that the adviser wishes to help the
student plan an educational career that goes
somewhere, that has coherence and point to it,
rather than being a miscellaneous collection
of requirements and aimless electives. If the
adviser is the student's advocate, however, this
coherence must be a means of enabling the
student's wishes and strengths to be embodied
in his program, not a way for the adviser to
impose his own concepts on the student.
Such a concept would, to he sure, produce
advising that takes more time, for carefully
considering with a student his academic ob
jectives and intellectual curiosities consumes
more time that simply signing his card. But if
such advising is understood and underscored
by tin 1 faculty as integral 1o education, faculty
members may more happily engage in it. It

poses several problems, among which is the
acceptance of advising as a normal aspect of
academic appointment at Stanford. If such
advising will not be done by the faculty, some
one must do it. In the absence of good faculty
advising, a corps of professional advisers
would probably have to be retained to the dam
age of the budget and of the academic exper
tise with which advising ought to be done. On
all counts, the Committee emphatically prefers
faculty advising.
The student's stake in advising. A curious
duality is sometimes to be observed among
students. On the one hand, they firmly ob
ject to be treated as ciphers or as children by
an institution standing in loco parentis. On
the other .they wish the advice of their elders
among the faculty, and this wish is sometimes
Indistinguishable from a desire for a parent
surrogate. Occasionally, when the advice given
is not to an individual's liking, he will pro
test that he is not being respected. We point
this out in part to say that the students' own
view of their stake in advising is not crystal
clear.
Although the student knows more about
himself than any adviser is ever likely to
know, he needs advising because he has not
enough experience of education to know pre
cisely how to join his interests and talents
to a curricular regimen. This observation ap
plies equally, though in different perspectives,
to undergraduates and graduate students. The
student looks to an adviser for guidance in
pursuing an education that will take ad
vantage of his interests and lead him beyond
his own provincial boundaries, at the same
time that it is certifiable by the University as
meeting its standards. The University, of
course, must determine what those standards
are, since it is the body doing the certifying.
The adviser stands toward the student in the
peculiar position of being at once a represen
tative of the University's power of sanction
upon the student (he makes judgments on stu
dents' performance) and and the advocate of
that particula student in the acquisition of his
most effective education.
If the structure of degree requirements on
the graduate level becomes less prescriptive,
the premium on interested advising which
aids the student toward coherence as well as
adventuresomeness will rise. Experience will
count for much in a student's planning, al
though it should not be prescriptively applied.
What is at stake for the student in a more flex
ible under-graduate program is precisely the
humanity of an adviser who is genuinely the
student's educational advocate. If the program
is flexible, advocacy need not consist in find
ing ways to circumvent regulations.
The levels of advising and their problems.
Special and different problems of advising ob
tain for freshmen, transfers, upperclass un
dergraduates and departmental majors, and
graduate students. At the same time, the Com
mittee is convinced of one true observation:
the best advising takes place where advisee
and adviser have some kind of common bond,
beyond the routine. This may be the bond of
the same field of study (the normal pre-set
bond between graduate students and faculty),
some common experience (frequently that the
student has taken the faculty member's
course), or prior acquaintance.
From this standpoint, the advising of fresh
men is the most difficult task, for freshmen
rarely have any existing bond to a faculty
member. It must be established. The Commit
tee has been divided upon several possible ways
to handle freshman advising. That the faculty
should carry the bulk of the advising seems
wise, yet a student's assigned adviser only
rarely turns out to be important or helpful
to him. As the freshman year curriculum now
stands, freshmen rarely come into close con
tact with faculty members, except those al
-most as transient as themselves: English
TA's, Western Civ instructors, lab TA's, and
beginning math and language TA's. The In
crease of Freshman seminars may improve
the range of faculty contact. The plans of
assigning advisers to groups in living units
has been extremely spotty in its effectiveness,
and it suffers from the fact that the advisers
remain abstractly faculty members, rather
than being perceived in their active teaching
roles. Relationships of freshman to faculty
residents or directors of living units, to tutors,
and to sponsors are relatively close, and these
persons in fact do the bulk of freshman ad
vising. The Trancos experiment is one possible
model of freshman advising, where residence
director, sponsors and tutors, and a team of
faculty advisers work closely together. Fresh
man advising ought to aid in the orientation
of the entering student, j.etting him off on the
right foot, proposing seriously that he identify
areas of genuine intellectual interest. Such
advising should prepare the student to find
a permanent academic adviser as he goes.
The Committee is unanimous in suggesting
that advising will become more effective from
all sides if the student ultimately chooses his
own adviser. In fact this frequently happens
now, except that the adviser whom the stu
dent chooses is often not the one responsible
for signing his card. We see the following
arguments in favor of this idea: 1. The stu
dent will most likely choose a faculty mem
ber whom he has seen in action, knows some
thing of his qualities and the "cut of his jib."
2. Such a relationship would underscore the
obligation of both student and adviser for
tion in which the student is interested and
tion In which the student is interested an
which makes coherent academic sense of his
interests and career plans. (The Committee
believes, parenthetically, that changing ad
visers and programs ought to be quite easy,
with no prejudice attached to it.) 3. If the
structure of the freshman year becomes less
prescribed, freshmen will have access to a
broader range of course options and of faculty
members than is now the case and will be
more likely to identify someone with whom
they believe they can work.
Certain problems with this arrangement can
be foreseen. 1. Some very popular professors
will be swamped with advisees, and other fac
ulty members will have few or none. To this
the Committee would propose that limitations
on the number of advisees per faculty member
be administratively established (see below.) 2.
Understaffed departments will have too many
majors to observe the limitations, and will have
to continue assigning majors to advisers. To
this the Committee proposes that the student's
adviser need not, though he may, be in the stu
dent's own major department. If the adviser is
not charged to keep track of regulations, it is
not at all unlikely that a professor in one de
partment can help a student in another to pur
sue a course that both meets the standards laid
down by the department and satisfies the stu
dent's own academic needs and wants. Depart
ments might require countersignature of study
cards by departmental representatives. Any
student seriously wishing to become a his
torian, for example, will probably try to find
a historian as adviser in order to get help in
preparing to be like him. We recognize that
in some programs, e.g. Philosophy and the
Honors Program in Humanities, the adviser
docs considerable tutoring of the student in
his senior year. This does not seem to us in
compatible with the basic premise. We are in
clined, on the undergraduate level, to resist
departmental "imperialism," which demands
control over "its" students. An undergraduate
major need not, after all, be occupational prep
aration, but, especially in the Humanities and
Social Sciences, is rather a point of co
herence for one's entire liberal education. Stu
dents who wish strong identification with a
discipline or department may gain it by choos
ing advisers there. Students who do not want
such a concentration may be well served by
advisers from almost anywhere in the Uni
versity.
Such a plan would introduce a differentia
tion between freshman and upperclass advis
ing, in place of the present differentiation be
tween General Studies and major advising.
The Committee is inclined to believe that the
former differentiation would make all advis
ing more effective with regard to general ed
ucation. We are not yet agreed as to the time
when a student must have chosen his adviser.
Some might stay with the person to whom they
were assigned as freshmen; others would find
an adviser during the freshman year; still
others during the sophomore year. Some stu
dents might have three or four different ad
visers during their careers. We see no compel
ing reason why that should be forbidden,
though frequent changes may be a signal that
counseling of some kind is needed. As at pres
ent, students will continue to seek out advice
from faculty members whom they like and
trust, no matter who is the officially designated
adviser. The present suggestion is intended to
take advantage of that fact of life.
The advising of graduate students might
seem to be self-evident. No one except grad
uate students themselves seems to feel it a
problem. Some responsibilities which many

departments seem not to handle well with
graduate students are the following: (1) intro
ducing new students to the University; (2) in
forming students about and channeling them,
when need is present, to the Counseling and
Testing Center, Cowell Halth Service, the
Placement Service, etc.; (3) giving students
vocational advice and sometimes placing them;
(4) informing new students about housing pos
sibilities and problems; (5) informing students
about useful training obtainable on a reg
ular basis in other departments. The pro
blem here is different from that of under
graduates in that the graduate student is
earnestly in the process of professional prep
aration. There is a certain emulative aspect to
graduate study, therefore, because many grad
uate students (certainly not nearly 100%) are
working with people with whom they expect
ultimately to become colleagues. It seems to
us probable that at present graduate students
select their own advisers to an extent that un
dergraduate do not. The function of faculty in
attracting graduate students to any university
assures that the potential of full relationships
is present. A stronger administrative surveil
lance of graduate advising might help to over
come the deficiences of individual departments.
Some special problems. Three groups of stu
dents present special problems to which the
Committee does not yet have answers. It is
clear that transfer students could use far bet
ter help on arrival than most of them get. It is
also clear that their problems are different
from those faced by freshman. We believe that
transfer students should bo given high priority
for on-campus housing. It also seems to us
that the evaluation of transfer credits could
be expedited and improved in many ways.
Some faculty members might be especially en
couraged to handle transfer students. We de
sire further suggestions about the advising of
transfer students from anyone with ideas to
give.
Another group of students with problems to
which the Committee has not yet given
sufficient attention is foreign students. The
Beehtel International Center is a source of
remarkably fine personal attention to foreign
students. But this group has academic prob
lems peculiarly their own, and some made of
advising needs, we think, to be tailored to
them. Again, the Committee wishes to be
helped by ideas.
The third group is comprised of members
of minorities with special disadvantages. Ad
vising needs to have cognizance both of the
personal problems faced by such students and
of academic needs. Efforts to provide tutoring
from the Office of Financial Aids have been
sporadic, due largely to stringently limited
funds. Some more formal program of tutoring
and counsel would greatly increase the accessi
bility of an adequate Stanford education for
such students. Stanford has publicly stated its
intention to do the right thing by these per
sons. Additional support, morally and mone
tarily, needs to be provided.
The extent and rewards of advising. The
Committee believes that advising on all levels
should be taken together in figuring the aver
age ratio of advisees to advisers. Taking fig
ures in the fall Student Directory as sub

stantially correct for numbers of majors and
graduate students in the Schools and Depart
ments, and taking a count of faculty at As
sistant Professor or higher in Courses and De
grees as substantially correct (realizing that
many people in the latter are absent on leave),
and assuming that all of those faculty advise
majors and graduate students, we find the fol
lowing ratios by schools of major and grad
uate advisees to advisers:
Earth Sciences 5.8 (169/29)
Engineering 13.4 (2114A58)
Humanities & Sciences 11.7 (4739/405)
The figures for present General Studies ad
vising, however, look rather different. 115
persons are engaged in 1967-68 in General
Studies advising of 2330 students without de
clared majors, a ratio of 20.2G advisees to each
adviser. Sources of General Studies advisers
are as follows:
Earth Sciences 7 (24% of
school faculty)
Engineering 11 (6.9% of
school faculty)
Humanities & Sciences 45 (11.1% of
school faculty)
Medicine 12
Military Science 2
Physical Education 3
Education 2
Administration 33
The figures show the difficulties encountered
by the Registrar in his task of recruiting
General Studies Advisers. Only 63 ( 54.8%) of
present General Studies advisers come from
the faculties of Schools which will enroll the
advisees as majors. Moreover, only 39% of
General Studies advisers come from the School
of Humanities and Sciences, which can rea
sonably expect to enroll about 80% of un
dergraduates.
At the same time, figures received from De
partments of the School of Humanities and
Sciences show a very wide variation in the
actual advising practice of departments. Some
departments average as few as 4 departmental
advisees per adviser, whereas members of
others may have as many as 66 major ad
visees. Such a figure seems to the Committee
a mockery of the very idea of advising.
One can be only routine with that many ad
visees. The Committee is inclined to believe
that an upper limit on the number of allowable
advisees per adviser should be set, perhaps at
25 or 30, such a figure to include both grad
uate and undergraduate students. The Com
mittee also believes that Deans should ask
executive hads of departments quite search
ing questions about provisions for carrying
advising when many members of a depart
ment propose to be on leave for a given year.
One instance has been reported in which a
member of a large department finds himself
during this academic year with 89 advisees
(graduate, undergraduate major, and Gen
eral Studies) because so many of his col
league are absent on leave. If a limit on ad
visees were set and adhered to, such ex
ploitation would not be permitted.
The Committee has thought very hard about
the place of advising in Stanford's status and
reward system for its faculty. At present, save

for one department that claims to adjust Its
teaching loads in proportion to advising loads,
advising is in fact extra-curricular, in that
it is supposed to be done but no one pays
much attention if it is not done. The Commit
tee is informed that advisers receive extra
pay in some universities, and it has discussed
whether bonus pay would be an incentive to
better advising. We are not satisfied that it
would. We have also asked how a faculty
member's advising effectiveness might be a
factor in his promotion and salary increment.
Nothing would please the Committee more
than to be shown a method of accurate evalua
tion of this effectiveness, so that it could be
used as one among other determinants. We
have yet to find a method. Even if the stu
dent were to choose his adviser, one could not
determine the adviser's effectiveness merely
by counting the number of his advisees.
The Committee believes that advising will
be able to play a role in the status and re
ward system only if the faculty becomes so
committed to the advising function (which,
for the Committee, is integral to the educa
tional function) that the very commitment
produces a means of reward. The faculty
must decide that advising is important, and
the faculty at large must expend some energy
in advising. Pressure probably ought to be
exerted on those of our colleagues who would
rather not advise students, although the very
reluctant adviser will likely not be a very
good one. Perhaps, in considerations of reward
and promotion, nothing more than a negative
question can be asked. If a brilliant research
er does no advising, can his research contribu
tions outweigh the absence of his contribu
tion to the University's humanity? In some in
stances, the answer might have to be "No."
So far as the Committee knows, the question
has never been asked.
Advising in the professor's profession. The
Committee has expressed its conviction that
advising students is properly a part of the
educational profession, that such an as
sumption ought if possible to be an element
in consideration of reward. We suggest, more
over, that prospective faculty appointees be
informed of advising obligations of Stanford
faculty members. We would also suggest a
more long-range way of achieving the actuality
of this assumption. It has often been pointed
out that among the weakest aspects of grad
uate education today is the failure to prepare
people for their profession. Graduate students
are trained to do research, but many of them
are hired to be teachers and members of fac
ulties. We do not wish to underplay research.
But too little is done to train those of our grad
uate students who will become teachers for
their actual professional functions. The Com
mittee suggests the advisability of instruc
tion for graduate students in the scope of the
objectives and responsibilities of their chosen
profession, which will help them comprehend
the expectations under which they will work.
Such instruction could go a long way toward
making actual the ideal that professors are
engaged in education, an activity that includes
research and publication, classroom teach
ing, and the education of individual students
outside of formal instruction that advising
ought to be. When education in that sense be
comes the basic assumption of the University's

life, we will be on the way toward the fulfill
ment of our humanity.

Epilogue:
Enablement and
Surveillance
It is hoped that in such a relatively casual
and self selecting system as that proposed
above, the quiet and unspectacular job that
needs to be done will proceed. But responsibili
ty for watching it must be lodged somewhere
more specific than in the hearts and minds of
the 20,000-odd souls of the Stanford commun
ity. There needs to be improved liaison among
agencies, assurance that stated functions are
being fulfilled, exhortation if not pressure
for participation in both given and receiving.
It was suggested, half jocularly, in the Com
mittee that what is wanted is a "University
humane ofTice.'The term is simplistic, but the
thought is precise. To indicate, to itself and
everyone else, that Stanford means its hu
manity, the responsibility should be assumed
by a highly placed officer, of at least Associate
Provost rank, whose responsibilities would in
clude the coordination of advising and coun
seling structures.
The Committee remains uncertain whether
the responsibility should be added to those
carried by the Dean of Students, whether it
should be assigned to a Dean of Undergraduate
Educationâ€”should such a position be rein
statedâ€”or whether a new position should be
created. In favor of the first is the fact that
the Dean of Students is now responsible for
several agencies in which counseling and ad
vising take place. On the other hand, the ed
ucational thrust of the entire program might
suggest that the responsibility be held by a
distinctly academic officer such as a Dean of
Undergraduate Education. At the same time,
the fact that advising and counseling must af
fect graduate as well as undergraduate stu
dents makes desirable that the officer not be
exclusively occupied with undergraduates.
Whoever such a person might be, and what
ever his title, he must be accessible to and
trustable by students, command the respect
and attract the cooperation of the faculty, and
display remarkable virtues to non-academic
staff persons.

This paper is presented to the University
community by the Committee on Advising and
Couast'lint; of the Study of Education at Stan
ford. It is important to say tliat the paper is
intended not as a recommendation for immedi
ate decision hut as some proposals for discus
sion.
Hearings will take place 7 9 p.m. Tuesday
and 4-fi p.m. Wednesday in room 143 of Meyer
Library. Members of the committee will be
present to receive comments on the paper. The
Committee also welcomes written responses to
the SES office, Meyer Library.
Few subjects are so frequently the target of
criticism as advising, few so rarely the object
of constructive suggestion. Widespread agree
ment thai advising is not very well done at
Stanford is equalled by imprecision as to the
problem and feasible solutions. Our realism
breeds cynicism, concluding that we must ac
cept inadequacy.
The Committee on Advising and Counseling
of the Study of Education at Stanford has at
tempted to be realistic but not cynical. Mow
ever unlikely the radical alteration of human
nature may be, the alteration of perspectives
and priorities is well within our reach. The
Committee urges the University's members,
however, that unless assumptions are modi
fied the cynics will he proven right. Foremost
among the assumptions that require adjust
ment is the tacit one that for a faculty mem
ber advising is an extracurricular activity.
This assumption produces hesitance on the
part of many students to consult advisers ex
cept for routine card-signing for fear of "tak
ing up his time," and their resultant complaint
that advising at Stanford is nothing but rou
tine. It produces the perception on the part of
faculty members that advising, except for one's
"own" special (preferably graduate) students,
is a chore to be avoided if possible and to be
disposed of quickly if avoidance is not possible.
It produces among administrators complete ig
norance of inequities in advising loads and the
ignoring of the function of advising in con
siderations of appointment, promotion, and re
ward.
The Committee is not so blindered as to sup
pose that advising is the most important as
pect of university life. But it is sensitive to
the penetration of aspects of advising into al
most everything Stanford does, from admis
sions to residence policy to undergraduate and
graduate curriculum to student services to the
extra-curriculum to placement and vocational
decisions. In what follows we have made some
assumption that bear explication. First, we
suppose that advising has basically to do with
the possibility of significant relations and com
munication between persons, that it sums up
what we intend by our sub-title: "the humani
ty of the University." Second, we assume that
the educational direction Stanford is taking
will entail more advising, not less, on both
graduate and undergraduate levels, and a high
er degree of humanity, not a lower. Third, we
assume that, since no system is perfect, an ar
rangement of advising that allows several
quite different forms and structures of advis
ing to take place will come closer to self-re
newal than a single, potentially rigid system.
The problem, as we presently see it, has
three points of focus: 1. the dissemination to
everyone who needs it of accurate and com
plete information; 2. the availability to anyone
who needs it of competent professional coun
seling; 3. the accessibility to all students of
Interested and personal academic advice.
I. Dissemination
of Information
The story about the man who did not have
enough information to take instruction is rele
vant to the problem of advising. The Commit
tee believes that adequate and accurate infor
mation on most matters regarding the Univer
sity is readily available to those who wish and
need to have it. Ignorance and misinformation
are widespread, however, some of it difficult
to understand.
The information that needs dissemination is
that which makes possible (1) awareness on
the part of faculty and students alike of exact
ly what the University's communal and aca
demic facilities are; (2) access by members of
the University to the various services provid
ed; (3) informed decisions about academic
matters on the part of students.
A great deal of this information can be and
is conveyed in print, but people forget things
when they read them in almost unnumerable
bulletins, pamphlets, brochures, hand-bills, mi
meographed or dittoed sheets, and the like.
The variety is compounded by the fact that
certain published materials are factual in na
ture and others are more propagandists in
tone and purpose, by the fact that some infor
mation is obsolete before it is ever printed and
some is incomplete.
The Committee suggests basic simplification
into two yearly publications. One is an expand
ed version of the present rather slim Informa
tion Bulletin, to serve as a more general hand
book to the University. Here should be de
tailed information on matters not covered in
Courses and Degrees: fees and expenses, resi
dences, relatively permanent organizations and
activities both student and University-wide,
services available to the community such as
those of the Health Service, the Counseling
and Testing Center, the Bechtel International
Center, and others. Also in such a handbook
might be found brief descriptions of the ad
ministrative operation of the University, the
duties and powers of its various officers, and
policies affecting various of its members.
Through such a publication, which should be
routinely in the hands of everyone, both stu
dents and faculty could find how to get help
for all kinds of problems. New students and
new faculty members in particular would, with

its aid, more easily find their ways in the Uni
versity.
Parenthetically, the Committee also sees a
need for a faculty handbook, which would in
form faculty members of such policies of ap
pointment, promotion, tenure, and administra
tive arrangement as are especially relevant to
them.
The Committee wishes, moreover, that Cour
ses and I)egre<>s might he improved. The in
formation in it is frequently obsolete before
the book comes off the press. Might there not
be in the den of someone at Stanford printing
methods that could reduce the lag between
copy deadlines and publication? Would the
improvement of accuracy allowed by an Aug
ust publication date outweigh the advantage
for incoming students of the present May pub
lication? Students and advisers alike now hesi
tate to use Courses and Degrees as a basis
for planning the work of even a single year in
advance. The Committee wonders, then, wheth
er usefulness for planning to those already
here should not have priority over usefulness
for those about to come. In the light of the in
creasing need for advanced academic planning
by students, greater accuracy becomes even
more desirable. Moreover, if Courses and De
grees wore improved and up-dated, the expense
of the quarterly Time Schedule might be re
duced by making it no more than a supple
ment to Courses and Degrees.
All of these publications would bo of im
mense help to advisers and their advisees. The
Committee is of the opinion that the adviser's
function should not be to disseminate informa
tion that the student can more readily receive
otherwise. In saying that, we take full cog
nizance of the high likelihood that anything in
print will be misunderstood, misconstrued, or
misused somewhere by someone. Where the
adviser perceives ignorance, he must, of
course, rectify itâ€”and the student may do the
same. The adviser will function well with an
advisee when both have the necessary infor
mation, for then the adviser is free to advise
instead of merely to inform.
Concomitantly, the Committee believes that
the adviser should be relieved of policing cur
ricular regulations. So much of academic ad
vising is taken up with routine questions about
the fulfillment of requirements (How many
units of Science have you left to take? How
much math? etc.) that time for genuine and
personalized advice is too often at a premium.
The Committee has a hunch, moreover, (1)
that on the whole students know the require
ments in General Studies and in major pro
grams better than their advisers do, and (2)
that students almost always know exactly
where they stand with regard to those require
ments. The Committee wonders about the feas
ibility of computerizing information of these
kinds to enable easy retrieval. If machines can
free us for the improvement of our humanity,
we should by all means use them.
In short, the Committee believes that advis
ing could be far better focussed on advice if
the dissemination of information were both
simplified and improved, so that the adviser
does not have to be a traffic cop of regulations.
11. Availability
of Counseling
For clarity of terminology, we use the term
"counseling" to mean the impartation of help
for problems of a personal sort, not immediate
ly involving the academic, while "advising" is
restricted in this paper to academic advice.
It is certainly the case that a great deal of
counseling in this sense occurs in any commu
nity as large and as complex as Stanford. Most
of it is casual, among close friends, and with
no pretense of professional expertise. This
sort of counseling will happen whether the
institution encourages or discourages it. Any
attempt to structure such relationships is, of
course, doomed to failure. Faculty members
also do a great deal of counseling of this kind.
Though some may criticize the non-profession
al nature of such counseling, that may in itself
bo one of the'strengths of the relationship. At
the same time, situations frequently arise
where professional counseling is needed and
any casual counselor should always have in
mind the possibility of referring someone to
sources of professional aid. The Committee has
not conceived of any way by which faculty or
other such occasional counselors might cus
tomarily be taught how to recognize danger
signals, but they should be aware of an obli
gation to suggest referral.
Nevertheless, sources of professional coun
seling are present at Stanford, and the Com
mittee has been surprise that some members
of the University, both faculty and students,
seem unaware of them. Apart from the coun
seling done in residences < faculty residents,
residence directors, resident assistants, tutors,
and sponsors), which would have to be called
at best semi-professional, counseling done by
campus religious representatives, and that
done in special circumstances by persons in
the Dean of Students' office, the University
maintains two major sources of professional
counseling and a third that might become one.
We refer in the first instance to the Counsel
ing and Testing Center and to the psychiatric
services of the Cowell Health Center, and in
the second instance to the Placement Service.
The Counseling and Testing Center provides
psychological testing of many kinds and both
short-range and long-range psychological coun
seling. The psychiatric staff of the Cowell
Health Center is available for psychiatric con
sultation and some forms of therapy, and pa
tients in need of long-range therapy are re
ferred to psychiatrists in the School of Medi
cine for it.
The Committee has no wish to enter into the
relative merits of these two approaches, be
lieving that both meet various kinds of situ
ations helpfully. The liaison between the Conn

soling and Testing Center and the Cowell
Health reportedly good and getting
better. Such liaison and cooperation should be
encouraged by the University administration.
The fact that a relatively small proportion of
Stanford students uses the counseling services
in these two institutions may be an index of
the community's relatively healthy mental
state. On the other hand, experience hÂ°re and
in other universities would seem to indicate
that there are many more problems than are
actually met by these services. Larger staffs
would doubtless encourage more students with
real problems to seek aid.
It has been rightly observed that while any
person lacks the medical or psychological
help he needs, the job of counseling is not be
ing properly done. One of our faculty col
leagues recently stated that "One student sui
cide per year is one too many," a sentiment
with which no one could quarrel. But preven
tion in the realm of counseling is the most
difficult task. For one thing, it requires the
willing cooperation of the patient or subject.
The continued excellence and improvement
of these two services seems to the Committee,
however, a matter of rather high priority. We
are in a period where the mental strains upon
the age group of Stanford students are great
and on the increase. It is no pampering mood
that leads to the conclusion that professional
aid is needed; it is rather the sense of urgency
that informs higher education, and the wish
that barriers to the best education every stu
dent is capable of absorbing be as far as possi
ble thrown down. We do not believe that the
improvement of, say, the Counseling and Test
ing Center is more important than the im
provement of the faculty. But believing in the
priority of the academic, we wish it to be aided
by the best medical and psychological services
Stanford can afford to render.
We have few specific recommendations,
apart from general improvementâ€”which In
itself ought not to be taken as underhanded
criticism. The first contact with the Counsel
ing and Testing Center ought to make clear
to entering students that genuine personal
counsel may be had there. We are dubious
that the orientation-week testing is a good in
troduction for students, valuable as the re
sults may be for staff research. The counsel
ing function should be made more distinct
from that of legitimate research.
The most difficult question with which the
Committee has long wrestled is how to be
sure that the people who need the help receive
it. To that question, we have no satisfactory
answer. The availability of the services should
b" widely publicized and accurately described.
Every member of the University should know
about them. But the person who refuses to
seek help when he needs it can not, by any
means the Committee has been able to discov
er, be forced to have it.
The Committee notes with satisfaction the
recent improvements in the situation of reli
gious ministries on the campus. Although not
every religious tradition is officially repre
sented, persons desiring counseling of a reli
gious sort have access to a broad range of
clergymen and denominational representatives.
Since campus office space was made available
to denominational representatives, the work
of the Pean of the Chapel and his assistant
and of the University Chaplain has been en
larged by cooperation. To those who doubt the
propriety of the presence of clergymen on a
university campus, the Committee would say
that the day when religious bodies looked on
the ministry to students as a salvage operation
from the godless university is long past. Safe
guards against irresponsibility in this as in
other areas of interest can be established ad
ministratively. Those members of the Univer
sity who find religious counsel helpful and nec
essary can and do seek it out.
By virtue of the fact that Selective Service
is of immediate concern to the majority of
Stanford students, the Committee has consid
ered advising facilities offered regarding the
draft. A National Service Adviser has for
some time been available. The Committee ap
plauds the addition of a counselor on con
scientious objection to the student facilities
available on campus. We anticipate that such
an office will be continued while the question
of the draft is pertinent, and suggest that the
amount of student need for such counsel re
quires the availability of more time than is
now provided. The different natures of the
counseling involved makes it advisable to keep
separate the conscientious objection counsel
ing and National Service advising. Greater co
ordination of the latter with the ROTC offices
and the Placement Service would facilitate the
answering of questions faced by many stu
dents in regard to the options available for
fulfillment of military service. However, the
effectiveness of both offices is hampered at
present by lack of information reaching the
student. Publicizing these services in the hand
book to the University proposed above, and by
whatever means are now available, and the
initiation of orientation sessions with tutors,
residence assistants, and directors may begin
to alleviate this inadequacy.
The Placement Service is kept until last be
cause the Committee believes substantial ex
pansion is possible and desirable. At present
the Placement Service is a means to bring
prospective employees into contact with pros
pective employers and to aid students to re
ceive part-time and summer jobs. With ex
pense (the Committee does not wish to guess
how much* and reorganization, the Placement
Service could become a Career Guidance Cen
ter. This change would put job interviews into
perspective as aspects of a more thorough in
vestigation by the individual of his wishes and
talents for a career. Facilities for aptitude
tests of various kinds would be needed, as well
as staff to process and counsel regarding such
tests. For this purpose, it would he well to
shift the efforts in career counseling now car
ried on by the Counseling and Testing Center
to an expanded Career Guidance Center. Infor

mation on opportunities and requisites for ca
reers of many kinds could conveniently be
gathered and sometimes produced by a Career
Guidance Center, and one might expect to find
in it the current catalogues of graduate and
professional schools across the country.
It has often been remarked that, for all the
Founders' desires that a Stanford education
should fit students for useful pursuits, the ac
cessibility of career counsel is rather slim
hÂ°re. In feeling that the situation bears im
provement the Committee does not imply that
every student should have made a clear voca
tional choice by the end of his senior year. But
students wishing to make informed and ra
tional choices of careers should have access as
early as possible to information and individual
ized counsel regarding the options. A Career
Guidance Center might have the contacts to
place students in part-time and temporary
jobs with persons in careers that the students
are considering, experience which might be
invaluable whether it be positive or negative.
Other methods of gaining insight into vari
ous kinds of professional life may likewise
gain momentum. A proposal now being con
sidered suggests the establishment of sopho
more and higher level courses on the profes
sions, taught from the perspectives of both
the humanities and the social sciences. Such
courses would be informational and descriptive
and in no sense recruitment techniques. Still
other means might be found to make available
for students bases for wise career decisions.
The present admirable advising done by facul
ty members of the School of Medicine with
and for pre-medical students could profitably
be emulated elsewhere. Could not the Schools
of Law, Business, and Education, for example,
provide similar counsel in cooperation with a
Career Guidance Center? The Committee pre
sumes that remuneration occupations will for
some time be necessary for most members of
American society. There is point, therefore, to
the thought that education can be useful, even
though that is far from being the whole point
of education.
111. Academic
Advising
If personal counseling is very largely done
casually and by amateurs, so is academic ad
vising. Most of the advising done at Stanford
is done by one undergraduate to another. The
Committee heartily approves this state of af
fairs at the same time that it is not satisfied
to abandon faculty advising.
Student Advising. Several aspects of under
graduate advising are carried by undergradu
ates. Students get their best information about
the value of specific courses from other stu
dents who have taken them. This is only natu
ral. Faculty members are loath to comment
on their colleagues, for reasons of professional
propriety; students are not. Moreover, faculty
members can talk about courses taught by
their colleagues only by hearsay, where stu
dents can speak at first hand. Such informal
advising is valuable, even though it is fre
quently biased. Sporadic attempts have been
made to bring it usefully into published form,
with such documents as the Course Review,
succeeding the earlier "Scratch Sheet." The
Committee applauds the concept of a student
Course Review as a valuable asset to advising,
and wishes that it might be thorough in its
coverage of courses, representative of a varie
ty of student reactions, and sensitive to stated
aims of professors in courses. Such a review
would also inform professors helpfully about
responses to the courses. The Course Review
ought to appear regularly, with cooperation
and financial assistance from the University
but without administrative control.
A recent experiment in appointing students
as advisers-at-large in their major departments
produced uncertain results. The fault may lie
partially in a lack of information about the
program, in student suspicion that student
advisers would be "administration types," in
students' feelings that they could get as good
advice from their friendsâ€”or in any possible
combination of those and other factors. The
Committee is not satisfied that student de
partmental advising is a bad idea, especially
on the basis of one year's experiment in three
departments. It exhorts departments and
schools to keep trying to find ways of taking
advantage of students' advising abilities.
The function of the adviser. We have already
expressed the Committee's suggestion that ad
vising not be simply a matter of policing, of
making sure that the student has information
and is taking the courses he is required to
take. The Adviser's Handbook describes the
goal of advising as bringing "the student to
the point where he can assume a maximum
amount of responsibility for his own academic
program and can make wise decisions on his
own" (p. 12). The Committee wishes to go be
yond that to propose that the adviser be
viewed both by the student and by himself as
the student's academic advocate, the particular
educator who agrees to concern himself with
his advisee's best education. This means prin
cipally that the adviser wishes to help the
student plan an educational career that goes
somewhere, that has coherence and point to it,
rather than being a miscellaneous collection
of requirements and aimless electives. If the
adviser is the student's advocate, however, this
coherence must be a means of enabling the
student's wishes and strengths to be embodied
in his program, not a way for the adviser to
impose his own concepts on the student.
Such a concept would, to he sure, produce
advising that takes more time, for carefully
considering with a student his academic ob
jectives and intellectual curiosities consumes
more time that simply signing his card. But if
such advising is understood and underscored
by tin 1 faculty as integral 1o education, faculty
members may more happily engage in it. It

poses several problems, among which is the
acceptance of advising as a normal aspect of
academic appointment at Stanford. If such
advising will not be done by the faculty, some
one must do it. In the absence of good faculty
advising, a corps of professional advisers
would probably have to be retained to the dam
age of the budget and of the academic exper
tise with which advising ought to be done. On
all counts, the Committee emphatically prefers
faculty advising.
The student's stake in advising. A curious
duality is sometimes to be observed among
students. On the one hand, they firmly ob
ject to be treated as ciphers or as children by
an institution standing in loco parentis. On
the other .they wish the advice of their elders
among the faculty, and this wish is sometimes
Indistinguishable from a desire for a parent
surrogate. Occasionally, when the advice given
is not to an individual's liking, he will pro
test that he is not being respected. We point
this out in part to say that the students' own
view of their stake in advising is not crystal
clear.
Although the student knows more about
himself than any adviser is ever likely to
know, he needs advising because he has not
enough experience of education to know pre
cisely how to join his interests and talents
to a curricular regimen. This observation ap
plies equally, though in different perspectives,
to undergraduates and graduate students. The
student looks to an adviser for guidance in
pursuing an education that will take ad
vantage of his interests and lead him beyond
his own provincial boundaries, at the same
time that it is certifiable by the University as
meeting its standards. The University, of
course, must determine what those standards
are, since it is the body doing the certifying.
The adviser stands toward the student in the
peculiar position of being at once a represen
tative of the University's power of sanction
upon the student (he makes judgments on stu
dents' performance) and and the advocate of
that particula student in the acquisition of his
most effective education.
If the structure of degree requirements on
the graduate level becomes less prescriptive,
the premium on interested advising which
aids the student toward coherence as well as
adventuresomeness will rise. Experience will
count for much in a student's planning, al
though it should not be prescriptively applied.
What is at stake for the student in a more flex
ible under-graduate program is precisely the
humanity of an adviser who is genuinely the
student's educational advocate. If the program
is flexible, advocacy need not consist in find
ing ways to circumvent regulations.
The levels of advising and their problems.
Special and different problems of advising ob
tain for freshmen, transfers, upperclass un
dergraduates and departmental majors, and
graduate students. At the same time, the Com
mittee is convinced of one true observation:
the best advising takes place where advisee
and adviser have some kind of common bond,
beyond the routine. This may be the bond of
the same field of study (the normal pre-set
bond between graduate students and faculty),
some common experience (frequently that the
student has taken the faculty member's
course), or prior acquaintance.
From this standpoint, the advising of fresh
men is the most difficult task, for freshmen
rarely have any existing bond to a faculty
member. It must be established. The Commit
tee has been divided upon several possible ways
to handle freshman advising. That the faculty
should carry the bulk of the advising seems
wise, yet a student's assigned adviser only
rarely turns out to be important or helpful
to him. As the freshman year curriculum now
stands, freshmen rarely come into close con
tact with faculty members, except those al
-most as transient as themselves: English
TA's, Western Civ instructors, lab TA's, and
beginning math and language TA's. The In
crease of Freshman seminars may improve
the range of faculty contact. The plans of
assigning advisers to groups in living units
has been extremely spotty in its effectiveness,
and it suffers from the fact that the advisers
remain abstractly faculty members, rather
than being perceived in their active teaching
roles. Relationships of freshman to faculty
residents or directors of living units, to tutors,
and to sponsors are relatively close, and these
persons in fact do the bulk of freshman ad
vising. The Trancos experiment is one possible
model of freshman advising, where residence
director, sponsors and tutors, and a team of
faculty advisers work closely together. Fresh
man advising ought to aid in the orientation
of the entering student, j.etting him off on the
right foot, proposing seriously that he identify
areas of genuine intellectual interest. Such
advising should prepare the student to find
a permanent academic adviser as he goes.
The Committee is unanimous in suggesting
that advising will become more effective from
all sides if the student ultimately chooses his
own adviser. In fact this frequently happens
now, except that the adviser whom the stu
dent chooses is often not the one responsible
for signing his card. We see the following
arguments in favor of this idea: 1. The stu
dent will most likely choose a faculty mem
ber whom he has seen in action, knows some
thing of his qualities and the "cut of his jib."
2. Such a relationship would underscore the
obligation of both student and adviser for
tion in which the student is interested and
tion In which the student is interested an
which makes coherent academic sense of his
interests and career plans. (The Committee
believes, parenthetically, that changing ad
visers and programs ought to be quite easy,
with no prejudice attached to it.) 3. If the
structure of the freshman year becomes less
prescribed, freshmen will have access to a
broader range of course options and of faculty
members than is now the case and will be
more likely to identify someone with whom
they believe they can work.
Certain problems with this arrangement can
be foreseen. 1. Some very popular professors
will be swamped with advisees, and other fac
ulty members will have few or none. To this
the Committee would propose that limitations
on the number of advisees per faculty member
be administratively established (see below.) 2.
Understaffed departments will have too many
majors to observe the limitations, and will have
to continue assigning majors to advisers. To
this the Committee proposes that the student's
adviser need not, though he may, be in the stu
dent's own major department. If the adviser is
not charged to keep track of regulations, it is
not at all unlikely that a professor in one de
partment can help a student in another to pur
sue a course that both meets the standards laid
down by the department and satisfies the stu
dent's own academic needs and wants. Depart
ments might require countersignature of study
cards by departmental representatives. Any
student seriously wishing to become a his
torian, for example, will probably try to find
a historian as adviser in order to get help in
preparing to be like him. We recognize that
in some programs, e.g. Philosophy and the
Honors Program in Humanities, the adviser
docs considerable tutoring of the student in
his senior year. This does not seem to us in
compatible with the basic premise. We are in
clined, on the undergraduate level, to resist
departmental "imperialism," which demands
control over "its" students. An undergraduate
major need not, after all, be occupational prep
aration, but, especially in the Humanities and
Social Sciences, is rather a point of co
herence for one's entire liberal education. Stu
dents who wish strong identification with a
discipline or department may gain it by choos
ing advisers there. Students who do not want
such a concentration may be well served by
advisers from almost anywhere in the Uni
versity.
Such a plan would introduce a differentia
tion between freshman and upperclass advis
ing, in place of the present differentiation be
tween General Studies and major advising.
The Committee is inclined to believe that the
former differentiation would make all advis
ing more effective with regard to general ed
ucation. We are not yet agreed as to the time
when a student must have chosen his adviser.
Some might stay with the person to whom they
were assigned as freshmen; others would find
an adviser during the freshman year; still
others during the sophomore year. Some stu
dents might have three or four different ad
visers during their careers. We see no compel
ing reason why that should be forbidden,
though frequent changes may be a signal that
counseling of some kind is needed. As at pres
ent, students will continue to seek out advice
from faculty members whom they like and
trust, no matter who is the officially designated
adviser. The present suggestion is intended to
take advantage of that fact of life.
The advising of graduate students might
seem to be self-evident. No one except grad
uate students themselves seems to feel it a
problem. Some responsibilities which many

departments seem not to handle well with
graduate students are the following: (1) intro
ducing new students to the University; (2) in
forming students about and channeling them,
when need is present, to the Counseling and
Testing Center, Cowell Halth Service, the
Placement Service, etc.; (3) giving students
vocational advice and sometimes placing them;
(4) informing new students about housing pos
sibilities and problems; (5) informing students
about useful training obtainable on a reg
ular basis in other departments. The pro
blem here is different from that of under
graduates in that the graduate student is
earnestly in the process of professional prep
aration. There is a certain emulative aspect to
graduate study, therefore, because many grad
uate students (certainly not nearly 100%) are
working with people with whom they expect
ultimately to become colleagues. It seems to
us probable that at present graduate students
select their own advisers to an extent that un
dergraduate do not. The function of faculty in
attracting graduate students to any university
assures that the potential of full relationships
is present. A stronger administrative surveil
lance of graduate advising might help to over
come the deficiences of individual departments.
Some special problems. Three groups of stu
dents present special problems to which the
Committee does not yet have answers. It is
clear that transfer students could use far bet
ter help on arrival than most of them get. It is
also clear that their problems are different
from those faced by freshman. We believe that
transfer students should bo given high priority
for on-campus housing. It also seems to us
that the evaluation of transfer credits could
be expedited and improved in many ways.
Some faculty members might be especially en
couraged to handle transfer students. We de
sire further suggestions about the advising of
transfer students from anyone with ideas to
give.
Another group of students with problems to
which the Committee has not yet given
sufficient attention is foreign students. The
Beehtel International Center is a source of
remarkably fine personal attention to foreign
students. But this group has academic prob
lems peculiarly their own, and some made of
advising needs, we think, to be tailored to
them. Again, the Committee wishes to be
helped by ideas.
The third group is comprised of members
of minorities with special disadvantages. Ad
vising needs to have cognizance both of the
personal problems faced by such students and
of academic needs. Efforts to provide tutoring
from the Office of Financial Aids have been
sporadic, due largely to stringently limited
funds. Some more formal program of tutoring
and counsel would greatly increase the accessi
bility of an adequate Stanford education for
such students. Stanford has publicly stated its
intention to do the right thing by these per
sons. Additional support, morally and mone
tarily, needs to be provided.
The extent and rewards of advising. The
Committee believes that advising on all levels
should be taken together in figuring the aver
age ratio of advisees to advisers. Taking fig
ures in the fall Student Directory as sub

stantially correct for numbers of majors and
graduate students in the Schools and Depart
ments, and taking a count of faculty at As
sistant Professor or higher in Courses and De
grees as substantially correct (realizing that
many people in the latter are absent on leave),
and assuming that all of those faculty advise
majors and graduate students, we find the fol
lowing ratios by schools of major and grad
uate advisees to advisers:
Earth Sciences 5.8 (169/29)
Engineering 13.4 (2114A58)
Humanities & Sciences 11.7 (4739/405)
The figures for present General Studies ad
vising, however, look rather different. 115
persons are engaged in 1967-68 in General
Studies advising of 2330 students without de
clared majors, a ratio of 20.2G advisees to each
adviser. Sources of General Studies advisers
are as follows:
Earth Sciences 7 (24% of
school faculty)
Engineering 11 (6.9% of
school faculty)
Humanities & Sciences 45 (11.1% of
school faculty)
Medicine 12
Military Science 2
Physical Education 3
Education 2
Administration 33
The figures show the difficulties encountered
by the Registrar in his task of recruiting
General Studies Advisers. Only 63 ( 54.8%) of
present General Studies advisers come from
the faculties of Schools which will enroll the
advisees as majors. Moreover, only 39% of
General Studies advisers come from the School
of Humanities and Sciences, which can rea
sonably expect to enroll about 80% of un
dergraduates.
At the same time, figures received from De
partments of the School of Humanities and
Sciences show a very wide variation in the
actual advising practice of departments. Some
departments average as few as 4 departmental
advisees per adviser, whereas members of
others may have as many as 66 major ad
visees. Such a figure seems to the Committee
a mockery of the very idea of advising.
One can be only routine with that many ad
visees. The Committee is inclined to believe
that an upper limit on the number of allowable
advisees per adviser should be set, perhaps at
25 or 30, such a figure to include both grad
uate and undergraduate students. The Com
mittee also believes that Deans should ask
executive hads of departments quite search
ing questions about provisions for carrying
advising when many members of a depart
ment propose to be on leave for a given year.
One instance has been reported in which a
member of a large department finds himself
during this academic year with 89 advisees
(graduate, undergraduate major, and Gen
eral Studies) because so many of his col
league are absent on leave. If a limit on ad
visees were set and adhered to, such ex
ploitation would not be permitted.
The Committee has thought very hard about
the place of advising in Stanford's status and
reward system for its faculty. At present, save

for one department that claims to adjust Its
teaching loads in proportion to advising loads,
advising is in fact extra-curricular, in that
it is supposed to be done but no one pays
much attention if it is not done. The Commit
tee is informed that advisers receive extra
pay in some universities, and it has discussed
whether bonus pay would be an incentive to
better advising. We are not satisfied that it
would. We have also asked how a faculty
member's advising effectiveness might be a
factor in his promotion and salary increment.
Nothing would please the Committee more
than to be shown a method of accurate evalua
tion of this effectiveness, so that it could be
used as one among other determinants. We
have yet to find a method. Even if the stu
dent were to choose his adviser, one could not
determine the adviser's effectiveness merely
by counting the number of his advisees.
The Committee believes that advising will
be able to play a role in the status and re
ward system only if the faculty becomes so
committed to the advising function (which,
for the Committee, is integral to the educa
tional function) that the very commitment
produces a means of reward. The faculty
must decide that advising is important, and
the faculty at large must expend some energy
in advising. Pressure probably ought to be
exerted on those of our colleagues who would
rather not advise students, although the very
reluctant adviser will likely not be a very
good one. Perhaps, in considerations of reward
and promotion, nothing more than a negative
question can be asked. If a brilliant research
er does no advising, can his research contribu
tions outweigh the absence of his contribu
tion to the University's humanity? In some in
stances, the answer might have to be "No."
So far as the Committee knows, the question
has never been asked.
Advising in the professor's profession. The
Committee has expressed its conviction that
advising students is properly a part of the
educational profession, that such an as
sumption ought if possible to be an element
in consideration of reward. We suggest, more
over, that prospective faculty appointees be
informed of advising obligations of Stanford
faculty members. We would also suggest a
more long-range way of achieving the actuality
of this assumption. It has often been pointed
out that among the weakest aspects of grad
uate education today is the failure to prepare
people for their profession. Graduate students
are trained to do research, but many of them
are hired to be teachers and members of fac
ulties. We do not wish to underplay research.
But too little is done to train those of our grad
uate students who will become teachers for
their actual professional functions. The Com
mittee suggests the advisability of instruc
tion for graduate students in the scope of the
objectives and responsibilities of their chosen
profession, which will help them comprehend
the expectations under which they will work.
Such instruction could go a long way toward
making actual the ideal that professors are
engaged in education, an activity that includes
research and publication, classroom teach
ing, and the education of individual students
outside of formal instruction that advising
ought to be. When education in that sense be
comes the basic assumption of the University's

life, we will be on the way toward the fulfill
ment of our humanity.

Epilogue:
Enablement and
Surveillance
It is hoped that in such a relatively casual
and self selecting system as that proposed
above, the quiet and unspectacular job that
needs to be done will proceed. But responsibili
ty for watching it must be lodged somewhere
more specific than in the hearts and minds of
the 20,000-odd souls of the Stanford commun
ity. There needs to be improved liaison among
agencies, assurance that stated functions are
being fulfilled, exhortation if not pressure
for participation in both given and receiving.
It was suggested, half jocularly, in the Com
mittee that what is wanted is a "University
humane ofTice.'The term is simplistic, but the
thought is precise. To indicate, to itself and
everyone else, that Stanford means its hu
manity, the responsibility should be assumed
by a highly placed officer, of at least Associate
Provost rank, whose responsibilities would in
clude the coordination of advising and coun
seling structures.
The Committee remains uncertain whether
the responsibility should be added to those
carried by the Dean of Students, whether it
should be assigned to a Dean of Undergraduate
Educationâ€”should such a position be rein
statedâ€”or whether a new position should be
created. In favor of the first is the fact that
the Dean of Students is now responsible for
several agencies in which counseling and ad
vising take place. On the other hand, the ed
ucational thrust of the entire program might
suggest that the responsibility be held by a
distinctly academic officer such as a Dean of
Undergraduate Education. At the same time,
the fact that advising and counseling must af
fect graduate as well as undergraduate stu
dents makes desirable that the officer not be
exclusively occupied with undergraduates.
Whoever such a person might be, and what
ever his title, he must be accessible to and
trustable by students, command the respect
and attract the cooperation of the faculty, and
display remarkable virtues to non-academic
staff persons.

This paper is presented to the University
community by the Committee on Advising and
Couast'lint; of the Study of Education at Stan
ford. It is important to say tliat the paper is
intended not as a recommendation for immedi
ate decision hut as some proposals for discus
sion.
Hearings will take place 7 9 p.m. Tuesday
and 4-fi p.m. Wednesday in room 143 of Meyer
Library. Members of the committee will be
present to receive comments on the paper. The
Committee also welcomes written responses to
the SES office, Meyer Library.
Few subjects are so frequently the target of
criticism as advising, few so rarely the object
of constructive suggestion. Widespread agree
ment thai advising is not very well done at
Stanford is equalled by imprecision as to the
problem and feasible solutions. Our realism
breeds cynicism, concluding that we must ac
cept inadequacy.
The Committee on Advising and Counseling
of the Study of Education at Stanford has at
tempted to be realistic but not cynical. Mow
ever unlikely the radical alteration of human
nature may be, the alteration of perspectives
and priorities is well within our reach. The
Committee urges the University's members,
however, that unless assumptions are modi
fied the cynics will he proven right. Foremost
among the assumptions that require adjust
ment is the tacit one that for a faculty mem
ber advising is an extracurricular activity.
This assumption produces hesitance on the
part of many students to consult advisers ex
cept for routine card-signing for fear of "tak
ing up his time," and their resultant complaint
that advising at Stanford is nothing but rou
tine. It produces the perception on the part of
faculty members that advising, except for one's
"own" special (preferably graduate) students,
is a chore to be avoided if possible and to be
disposed of quickly if avoidance is not possible.
It produces among administrators complete ig
norance of inequities in advising loads and the
ignoring of the function of advising in con
siderations of appointment, promotion, and re
ward.
The Committee is not so blindered as to sup
pose that advising is the most important as
pect of university life. But it is sensitive to
the penetration of aspects of advising into al
most everything Stanford does, from admis
sions to residence policy to undergraduate and
graduate curriculum to student services to the
extra-curriculum to placement and vocational
decisions. In what follows we have made some
assumption that bear explication. First, we
suppose that advising has basically to do with
the possibility of significant relations and com
munication between persons, that it sums up
what we intend by our sub-title: "the humani
ty of the University." Second, we assume that
the educational direction Stanford is taking
will entail more advising, not less, on both
graduate and undergraduate levels, and a high
er degree of humanity, not a lower. Third, we
assume that, since no system is perfect, an ar
rangement of advising that allows several
quite different forms and structures of advis
ing to take place will come closer to self-re
newal than a single, potentially rigid system.
The problem, as we presently see it, has
three points of focus: 1. the dissemination to
everyone who needs it of accurate and com
plete information; 2. the availability to anyone
who needs it of competent professional coun
seling; 3. the accessibility to all students of
Interested and personal academic advice.
I. Dissemination
of Information
The story about the man who did not have
enough information to take instruction is rele
vant to the problem of advising. The Commit
tee believes that adequate and accurate infor
mation on most matters regarding the Univer
sity is readily available to those who wish and
need to have it. Ignorance and misinformation
are widespread, however, some of it difficult
to understand.
The information that needs dissemination is
that which makes possible (1) awareness on
the part of faculty and students alike of exact
ly what the University's communal and aca
demic facilities are; (2) access by members of
the University to the various services provid
ed; (3) informed decisions about academic
matters on the part of students.
A great deal of this information can be and
is conveyed in print, but people forget things
when they read them in almost unnumerable
bulletins, pamphlets, brochures, hand-bills, mi
meographed or dittoed sheets, and the like.
The variety is compounded by the fact that
certain published materials are factual in na
ture and others are more propagandists in
tone and purpose, by the fact that some infor
mation is obsolete before it is ever printed and
some is incomplete.
The Committee suggests basic simplification
into two yearly publications. One is an expand
ed version of the present rather slim Informa
tion Bulletin, to serve as a more general hand
book to the University. Here should be de
tailed information on matters not covered in
Courses and Degrees: fees and expenses, resi
dences, relatively permanent organizations and
activities both student and University-wide,
services available to the community such as
those of the Health Service, the Counseling
and Testing Center, the Bechtel International
Center, and others. Also in such a handbook
might be found brief descriptions of the ad
ministrative operation of the University, the
duties and powers of its various officers, and
policies affecting various of its members.
Through such a publication, which should be
routinely in the hands of everyone, both stu
dents and faculty could find how to get help
for all kinds of problems. New students and
new faculty members in particular would, with

its aid, more easily find their ways in the Uni
versity.
Parenthetically, the Committee also sees a
need for a faculty handbook, which would in
form faculty members of such policies of ap
pointment, promotion, tenure, and administra
tive arrangement as are especially relevant to
them.
The Committee wishes, moreover, that Cour
ses and I)egre<>s might he improved. The in
formation in it is frequently obsolete before
the book comes off the press. Might there not
be in the den of someone at Stanford printing
methods that could reduce the lag between
copy deadlines and publication? Would the
improvement of accuracy allowed by an Aug
ust publication date outweigh the advantage
for incoming students of the present May pub
lication? Students and advisers alike now hesi
tate to use Courses and Degrees as a basis
for planning the work of even a single year in
advance. The Committee wonders, then, wheth
er usefulness for planning to those already
here should not have priority over usefulness
for those about to come. In the light of the in
creasing need for advanced academic planning
by students, greater accuracy becomes even
more desirable. Moreover, if Courses and De
grees wore improved and up-dated, the expense
of the quarterly Time Schedule might be re
duced by making it no more than a supple
ment to Courses and Degrees.
All of these publications would bo of im
mense help to advisers and their advisees. The
Committee is of the opinion that the adviser's
function should not be to disseminate informa
tion that the student can more readily receive
otherwise. In saying that, we take full cog
nizance of the high likelihood that anything in
print will be misunderstood, misconstrued, or
misused somewhere by someone. Where the
adviser perceives ignorance, he must, of
course, rectify itâ€”and the student may do the
same. The adviser will function well with an
advisee when both have the necessary infor
mation, for then the adviser is free to advise
instead of merely to inform.
Concomitantly, the Committee believes that
the adviser should be relieved of policing cur
ricular regulations. So much of academic ad
vising is taken up with routine questions about
the fulfillment of requirements (How many
units of Science have you left to take? How
much math? etc.) that time for genuine and
personalized advice is too often at a premium.
The Committee has a hunch, moreover, (1)
that on the whole students know the require
ments in General Studies and in major pro
grams better than their advisers do, and (2)
that students almost always know exactly
where they stand with regard to those require
ments. The Committee wonders about the feas
ibility of computerizing information of these
kinds to enable easy retrieval. If machines can
free us for the improvement of our humanity,
we should by all means use them.
In short, the Committee believes that advis
ing could be far better focussed on advice if
the dissemination of information were both
simplified and improved, so that the adviser
does not have to be a traffic cop of regulations.
11. Availability
of Counseling
For clarity of terminology, we use the term
"counseling" to mean the impartation of help
for problems of a personal sort, not immediate
ly involving the academic, while "advising" is
restricted in this paper to academic advice.
It is certainly the case that a great deal of
counseling in this sense occurs in any commu
nity as large and as complex as Stanford. Most
of it is casual, among close friends, and with
no pretense of professional expertise. This
sort of counseling will happen whether the
institution encourages or discourages it. Any
attempt to structure such relationships is, of
course, doomed to failure. Faculty members
also do a great deal of counseling of this kind.
Though some may criticize the non-profession
al nature of such counseling, that may in itself
bo one of the'strengths of the relationship. At
the same time, situations frequently arise
where professional counseling is needed and
any casual counselor should always have in
mind the possibility of referring someone to
sources of professional aid. The Committee has
not conceived of any way by which faculty or
other such occasional counselors might cus
tomarily be taught how to recognize danger
signals, but they should be aware of an obli
gation to suggest referral.
Nevertheless, sources of professional coun
seling are present at Stanford, and the Com
mittee has been surprise that some members
of the University, both faculty and students,
seem unaware of them. Apart from the coun
seling done in residences < faculty residents,
residence directors, resident assistants, tutors,
and sponsors), which would have to be called
at best semi-professional, counseling done by
campus religious representatives, and that
done in special circumstances by persons in
the Dean of Students' office, the University
maintains two major sources of professional
counseling and a third that might become one.
We refer in the first instance to the Counsel
ing and Testing Center and to the psychiatric
services of the Cowell Health Center, and in
the second instance to the Placement Service.
The Counseling and Testing Center provides
psychological testing of many kinds and both
short-range and long-range psychological coun
seling. The psychiatric staff of the Cowell
Health Center is available for psychiatric con
sultation and some forms of therapy, and pa
tients in need of long-range therapy are re
ferred to psychiatrists in the School of Medi
cine for it.
The Committee has no wish to enter into the
relative merits of these two approaches, be
lieving that both meet various kinds of situ
ations helpfully. The liaison between the Conn

soling and Testing Center and the Cowell
Health reportedly good and getting
better. Such liaison and cooperation should be
encouraged by the University administration.
The fact that a relatively small proportion of
Stanford students uses the counseling services
in these two institutions may be an index of
the community's relatively healthy mental
state. On the other hand, experience hÂ°re and
in other universities would seem to indicate
that there are many more problems than are
actually met by these services. Larger staffs
would doubtless encourage more students with
real problems to seek aid.
It has been rightly observed that while any
person lacks the medical or psychological
help he needs, the job of counseling is not be
ing properly done. One of our faculty col
leagues recently stated that "One student sui
cide per year is one too many," a sentiment
with which no one could quarrel. But preven
tion in the realm of counseling is the most
difficult task. For one thing, it requires the
willing cooperation of the patient or subject.
The continued excellence and improvement
of these two services seems to the Committee,
however, a matter of rather high priority. We
are in a period where the mental strains upon
the age group of Stanford students are great
and on the increase. It is no pampering mood
that leads to the conclusion that professional
aid is needed; it is rather the sense of urgency
that informs higher education, and the wish
that barriers to the best education every stu
dent is capable of absorbing be as far as possi
ble thrown down. We do not believe that the
improvement of, say, the Counseling and Test
ing Center is more important than the im
provement of the faculty. But believing in the
priority of the academic, we wish it to be aided
by the best medical and psychological services
Stanford can afford to render.
We have few specific recommendations,
apart from general improvementâ€”which In
itself ought not to be taken as underhanded
criticism. The first contact with the Counsel
ing and Testing Center ought to make clear
to entering students that genuine personal
counsel may be had there. We are dubious
that the orientation-week testing is a good in
troduction for students, valuable as the re
sults may be for staff research. The counsel
ing function should be made more distinct
from that of legitimate research.
The most difficult question with which the
Committee has long wrestled is how to be
sure that the people who need the help receive
it. To that question, we have no satisfactory
answer. The availability of the services should
b" widely publicized and accurately described.
Every member of the University should know
about them. But the person who refuses to
seek help when he needs it can not, by any
means the Committee has been able to discov
er, be forced to have it.
The Committee notes with satisfaction the
recent improvements in the situation of reli
gious ministries on the campus. Although not
every religious tradition is officially repre
sented, persons desiring counseling of a reli
gious sort have access to a broad range of
clergymen and denominational representatives.
Since campus office space was made available
to denominational representatives, the work
of the Pean of the Chapel and his assistant
and of the University Chaplain has been en
larged by cooperation. To those who doubt the
propriety of the presence of clergymen on a
university campus, the Committee would say
that the day when religious bodies looked on
the ministry to students as a salvage operation
from the godless university is long past. Safe
guards against irresponsibility in this as in
other areas of interest can be established ad
ministratively. Those members of the Univer
sity who find religious counsel helpful and nec
essary can and do seek it out.
By virtue of the fact that Selective Service
is of immediate concern to the majority of
Stanford students, the Committee has consid
ered advising facilities offered regarding the
draft. A National Service Adviser has for
some time been available. The Committee ap
plauds the addition of a counselor on con
scientious objection to the student facilities
available on campus. We anticipate that such
an office will be continued while the question
of the draft is pertinent, and suggest that the
amount of student need for such counsel re
quires the availability of more time than is
now provided. The different natures of the
counseling involved makes it advisable to keep
separate the conscientious objection counsel
ing and National Service advising. Greater co
ordination of the latter with the ROTC offices
and the Placement Service would facilitate the
answering of questions faced by many stu
dents in regard to the options available for
fulfillment of military service. However, the
effectiveness of both offices is hampered at
present by lack of information reaching the
student. Publicizing these services in the hand
book to the University proposed above, and by
whatever means are now available, and the
initiation of orientation sessions with tutors,
residence assistants, and directors may begin
to alleviate this inadequacy.
The Placement Service is kept until last be
cause the Committee believes substantial ex
pansion is possible and desirable. At present
the Placement Service is a means to bring
prospective employees into contact with pros
pective employers and to aid students to re
ceive part-time and summer jobs. With ex
pense (the Committee does not wish to guess
how much* and reorganization, the Placement
Service could become a Career Guidance Cen
ter. This change would put job interviews into
perspective as aspects of a more thorough in
vestigation by the individual of his wishes and
talents for a career. Facilities for aptitude
tests of various kinds would be needed, as well
as staff to process and counsel regarding such
tests. For this purpose, it would he well to
shift the efforts in career counseling now car
ried on by the Counseling and Testing Center
to an expanded Career Guidance Center. Infor

mation on opportunities and requisites for ca
reers of many kinds could conveniently be
gathered and sometimes produced by a Career
Guidance Center, and one might expect to find
in it the current catalogues of graduate and
professional schools across the country.
It has often been remarked that, for all the
Founders' desires that a Stanford education
should fit students for useful pursuits, the ac
cessibility of career counsel is rather slim
hÂ°re. In feeling that the situation bears im
provement the Committee does not imply that
every student should have made a clear voca
tional choice by the end of his senior year. But
students wishing to make informed and ra
tional choices of careers should have access as
early as possible to information and individual
ized counsel regarding the options. A Career
Guidance Center might have the contacts to
place students in part-time and temporary
jobs with persons in careers that the students
are considering, experience which might be
invaluable whether it be positive or negative.
Other methods of gaining insight into vari
ous kinds of professional life may likewise
gain momentum. A proposal now being con
sidered suggests the establishment of sopho
more and higher level courses on the profes
sions, taught from the perspectives of both
the humanities and the social sciences. Such
courses would be informational and descriptive
and in no sense recruitment techniques. Still
other means might be found to make available
for students bases for wise career decisions.
The present admirable advising done by facul
ty members of the School of Medicine with
and for pre-medical students could profitably
be emulated elsewhere. Could not the Schools
of Law, Business, and Education, for example,
provide similar counsel in cooperation with a
Career Guidance Center? The Committee pre
sumes that remuneration occupations will for
some time be necessary for most members of
American society. There is point, therefore, to
the thought that education can be useful, even
though that is far from being the whole point
of education.
111. Academic
Advising
If personal counseling is very largely done
casually and by amateurs, so is academic ad
vising. Most of the advising done at Stanford
is done by one undergraduate to another. The
Committee heartily approves this state of af
fairs at the same time that it is not satisfied
to abandon faculty advising.
Student Advising. Several aspects of under
graduate advising are carried by undergradu
ates. Students get their best information about
the value of specific courses from other stu
dents who have taken them. This is only natu
ral. Faculty members are loath to comment
on their colleagues, for reasons of professional
propriety; students are not. Moreover, faculty
members can talk about courses taught by
their colleagues only by hearsay, where stu
dents can speak at first hand. Such informal
advising is valuable, even though it is fre
quently biased. Sporadic attempts have been
made to bring it usefully into published form,
with such documents as the Course Review,
succeeding the earlier "Scratch Sheet." The
Committee applauds the concept of a student
Course Review as a valuable asset to advising,
and wishes that it might be thorough in its
coverage of courses, representative of a varie
ty of student reactions, and sensitive to stated
aims of professors in courses. Such a review
would also inform professors helpfully about
responses to the courses. The Course Review
ought to appear regularly, with cooperation
and financial assistance from the University
but without administrative control.
A recent experiment in appointing students
as advisers-at-large in their major departments
produced uncertain results. The fault may lie
partially in a lack of information about the
program, in student suspicion that student
advisers would be "administration types," in
students' feelings that they could get as good
advice from their friendsâ€”or in any possible
combination of those and other factors. The
Committee is not satisfied that student de
partmental advising is a bad idea, especially
on the basis of one year's experiment in three
departments. It exhorts departments and
schools to keep trying to find ways of taking
advantage of students' advising abilities.
The function of the adviser. We have already
expressed the Committee's suggestion that ad
vising not be simply a matter of policing, of
making sure that the student has information
and is taking the courses he is required to
take. The Adviser's Handbook describes the
goal of advising as bringing "the student to
the point where he can assume a maximum
amount of responsibility for his own academic
program and can make wise decisions on his
own" (p. 12). The Committee wishes to go be
yond that to propose that the adviser be
viewed both by the student and by himself as
the student's academic advocate, the particular
educator who agrees to concern himself with
his advisee's best education. This means prin
cipally that the adviser wishes to help the
student plan an educational career that goes
somewhere, that has coherence and point to it,
rather than being a miscellaneous collection
of requirements and aimless electives. If the
adviser is the student's advocate, however, this
coherence must be a means of enabling the
student's wishes and strengths to be embodied
in his program, not a way for the adviser to
impose his own concepts on the student.
Such a concept would, to he sure, produce
advising that takes more time, for carefully
considering with a student his academic ob
jectives and intellectual curiosities consumes
more time that simply signing his card. But if
such advising is understood and underscored
by tin 1 faculty as integral 1o education, faculty
members may more happily engage in it. It

poses several problems, among which is the
acceptance of advising as a normal aspect of
academic appointment at Stanford. If such
advising will not be done by the faculty, some
one must do it. In the absence of good faculty
advising, a corps of professional advisers
would probably have to be retained to the dam
age of the budget and of the academic exper
tise with which advising ought to be done. On
all counts, the Committee emphatically prefers
faculty advising.
The student's stake in advising. A curious
duality is sometimes to be observed among
students. On the one hand, they firmly ob
ject to be treated as ciphers or as children by
an institution standing in loco parentis. On
the other .they wish the advice of their elders
among the faculty, and this wish is sometimes
Indistinguishable from a desire for a parent
surrogate. Occasionally, when the advice given
is not to an individual's liking, he will pro
test that he is not being respected. We point
this out in part to say that the students' own
view of their stake in advising is not crystal
clear.
Although the student knows more about
himself than any adviser is ever likely to
know, he needs advising because he has not
enough experience of education to know pre
cisely how to join his interests and talents
to a curricular regimen. This observation ap
plies equally, though in different perspectives,
to undergraduates and graduate students. The
student looks to an adviser for guidance in
pursuing an education that will take ad
vantage of his interests and lead him beyond
his own provincial boundaries, at the same
time that it is certifiable by the University as
meeting its standards. The University, of
course, must determine what those standards
are, since it is the body doing the certifying.
The adviser stands toward the student in the
peculiar position of being at once a represen
tative of the University's power of sanction
upon the student (he makes judgments on stu
dents' performance) and and the advocate of
that particula student in the acquisition of his
most effective education.
If the structure of degree requirements on
the graduate level becomes less prescriptive,
the premium on interested advising which
aids the student toward coherence as well as
adventuresomeness will rise. Experience will
count for much in a student's planning, al
though it should not be prescriptively applied.
What is at stake for the student in a more flex
ible under-graduate program is precisely the
humanity of an adviser who is genuinely the
student's educational advocate. If the program
is flexible, advocacy need not consist in find
ing ways to circumvent regulations.
The levels of advising and their problems.
Special and different problems of advising ob
tain for freshmen, transfers, upperclass un
dergraduates and departmental majors, and
graduate students. At the same time, the Com
mittee is convinced of one true observation:
the best advising takes place where advisee
and adviser have some kind of common bond,
beyond the routine. This may be the bond of
the same field of study (the normal pre-set
bond between graduate students and faculty),
some common experience (frequently that the
student has taken the faculty member's
course), or prior acquaintance.
From this standpoint, the advising of fresh
men is the most difficult task, for freshmen
rarely have any existing bond to a faculty
member. It must be established. The Commit
tee has been divided upon several possible ways
to handle freshman advising. That the faculty
should carry the bulk of the advising seems
wise, yet a student's assigned adviser only
rarely turns out to be important or helpful
to him. As the freshman year curriculum now
stands, freshmen rarely come into close con
tact with faculty members, except those al
-most as transient as themselves: English
TA's, Western Civ instructors, lab TA's, and
beginning math and language TA's. The In
crease of Freshman seminars may improve
the range of faculty contact. The plans of
assigning advisers to groups in living units
has been extremely spotty in its effectiveness,
and it suffers from the fact that the advisers
remain abstractly faculty members, rather
than being perceived in their active teaching
roles. Relationships of freshman to faculty
residents or directors of living units, to tutors,
and to sponsors are relatively close, and these
persons in fact do the bulk of freshman ad
vising. The Trancos experiment is one possible
model of freshman advising, where residence
director, sponsors and tutors, and a team of
faculty advisers work closely together. Fresh
man advising ought to aid in the orientation
of the entering student, j.etting him off on the
right foot, proposing seriously that he identify
areas of genuine intellectual interest. Such
advising should prepare the student to find
a permanent academic adviser as he goes.
The Committee is unanimous in suggesting
that advising will become more effective from
all sides if the student ultimately chooses his
own adviser. In fact this frequently happens
now, except that the adviser whom the stu
dent chooses is often not the one responsible
for signing his card. We see the following
arguments in favor of this idea: 1. The stu
dent will most likely choose a faculty mem
ber whom he has seen in action, knows some
thing of his qualities and the "cut of his jib."
2. Such a relationship would underscore the
obligation of both student and adviser for
tion in which the student is interested and
tion In which the student is interested an
which makes coherent academic sense of his
interests and career plans. (The Committee
believes, parenthetically, that changing ad
visers and programs ought to be quite easy,
with no prejudice attached to it.) 3. If the
structure of the freshman year becomes less
prescribed, freshmen will have access to a
broader range of course options and of faculty
members than is now the case and will be
more likely to identify someone with whom
they believe they can work.
Certain problems with this arrangement can
be foreseen. 1. Some very popular professors
will be swamped with advisees, and other fac
ulty members will have few or none. To this
the Committee would propose that limitations
on the number of advisees per faculty member
be administratively established (see below.) 2.
Understaffed departments will have too many
majors to observe the limitations, and will have
to continue assigning majors to advisers. To
this the Committee proposes that the student's
adviser need not, though he may, be in the stu
dent's own major department. If the adviser is
not charged to keep track of regulations, it is
not at all unlikely that a professor in one de
partment can help a student in another to pur
sue a course that both meets the standards laid
down by the department and satisfies the stu
dent's own academic needs and wants. Depart
ments might require countersignature of study
cards by departmental representatives. Any
student seriously wishing to become a his
torian, for example, will probably try to find
a historian as adviser in order to get help in
preparing to be like him. We recognize that
in some programs, e.g. Philosophy and the
Honors Program in Humanities, the adviser
docs considerable tutoring of the student in
his senior year. This does not seem to us in
compatible with the basic premise. We are in
clined, on the undergraduate level, to resist
departmental "imperialism," which demands
control over "its" students. An undergraduate
major need not, after all, be occupational prep
aration, but, especially in the Humanities and
Social Sciences, is rather a point of co
herence for one's entire liberal education. Stu
dents who wish strong identification with a
discipline or department may gain it by choos
ing advisers there. Students who do not want
such a concentration may be well served by
advisers from almost anywhere in the Uni
versity.
Such a plan would introduce a differentia
tion between freshman and upperclass advis
ing, in place of the present differentiation be
tween General Studies and major advising.
The Committee is inclined to believe that the
former differentiation would make all advis
ing more effective with regard to general ed
ucation. We are not yet agreed as to the time
when a student must have chosen his adviser.
Some might stay with the person to whom they
were assigned as freshmen; others would find
an adviser during the freshman year; still
others during the sophomore year. Some stu
dents might have three or four different ad
visers during their careers. We see no compel
ing reason why that should be forbidden,
though frequent changes may be a signal that
counseling of some kind is needed. As at pres
ent, students will continue to seek out advice
from faculty members whom they like and
trust, no matter who is the officially designated
adviser. The present suggestion is intended to
take advantage of that fact of life.
The advising of graduate students might
seem to be self-evident. No one except grad
uate students themselves seems to feel it a
problem. Some responsibilities which many

departments seem not to handle well with
graduate students are the following: (1) intro
ducing new students to the University; (2) in
forming students about and channeling them,
when need is present, to the Counseling and
Testing Center, Cowell Halth Service, the
Placement Service, etc.; (3) giving students
vocational advice and sometimes placing them;
(4) informing new students about housing pos
sibilities and problems; (5) informing students
about useful training obtainable on a reg
ular basis in other departments. The pro
blem here is different from that of under
graduates in that the graduate student is
earnestly in the process of professional prep
aration. There is a certain emulative aspect to
graduate study, therefore, because many grad
uate students (certainly not nearly 100%) are
working with people with whom they expect
ultimately to become colleagues. It seems to
us probable that at present graduate students
select their own advisers to an extent that un
dergraduate do not. The function of faculty in
attracting graduate students to any university
assures that the potential of full relationships
is present. A stronger administrative surveil
lance of graduate advising might help to over
come the deficiences of individual departments.
Some special problems. Three groups of stu
dents present special problems to which the
Committee does not yet have answers. It is
clear that transfer students could use far bet
ter help on arrival than most of them get. It is
also clear that their problems are different
from those faced by freshman. We believe that
transfer students should bo given high priority
for on-campus housing. It also seems to us
that the evaluation of transfer credits could
be expedited and improved in many ways.
Some faculty members might be especially en
couraged to handle transfer students. We de
sire further suggestions about the advising of
transfer students from anyone with ideas to
give.
Another group of students with problems to
which the Committee has not yet given
sufficient attention is foreign students. The
Beehtel International Center is a source of
remarkably fine personal attention to foreign
students. But this group has academic prob
lems peculiarly their own, and some made of
advising needs, we think, to be tailored to
them. Again, the Committee wishes to be
helped by ideas.
The third group is comprised of members
of minorities with special disadvantages. Ad
vising needs to have cognizance both of the
personal problems faced by such students and
of academic needs. Efforts to provide tutoring
from the Office of Financial Aids have been
sporadic, due largely to stringently limited
funds. Some more formal program of tutoring
and counsel would greatly increase the accessi
bility of an adequate Stanford education for
such students. Stanford has publicly stated its
intention to do the right thing by these per
sons. Additional support, morally and mone
tarily, needs to be provided.
The extent and rewards of advising. The
Committee believes that advising on all levels
should be taken together in figuring the aver
age ratio of advisees to advisers. Taking fig
ures in the fall Student Directory as sub

stantially correct for numbers of majors and
graduate students in the Schools and Depart
ments, and taking a count of faculty at As
sistant Professor or higher in Courses and De
grees as substantially correct (realizing that
many people in the latter are absent on leave),
and assuming that all of those faculty advise
majors and graduate students, we find the fol
lowing ratios by schools of major and grad
uate advisees to advisers:
Earth Sciences 5.8 (169/29)
Engineering 13.4 (2114A58)
Humanities & Sciences 11.7 (4739/405)
The figures for present General Studies ad
vising, however, look rather different. 115
persons are engaged in 1967-68 in General
Studies advising of 2330 students without de
clared majors, a ratio of 20.2G advisees to each
adviser. Sources of General Studies advisers
are as follows:
Earth Sciences 7 (24% of
school faculty)
Engineering 11 (6.9% of
school faculty)
Humanities & Sciences 45 (11.1% of
school faculty)
Medicine 12
Military Science 2
Physical Education 3
Education 2
Administration 33
The figures show the difficulties encountered
by the Registrar in his task of recruiting
General Studies Advisers. Only 63 ( 54.8%) of
present General Studies advisers come from
the faculties of Schools which will enroll the
advisees as majors. Moreover, only 39% of
General Studies advisers come from the School
of Humanities and Sciences, which can rea
sonably expect to enroll about 80% of un
dergraduates.
At the same time, figures received from De
partments of the School of Humanities and
Sciences show a very wide variation in the
actual advising practice of departments. Some
departments average as few as 4 departmental
advisees per adviser, whereas members of
others may have as many as 66 major ad
visees. Such a figure seems to the Committee
a mockery of the very idea of advising.
One can be only routine with that many ad
visees. The Committee is inclined to believe
that an upper limit on the number of allowable
advisees per adviser should be set, perhaps at
25 or 30, such a figure to include both grad
uate and undergraduate students. The Com
mittee also believes that Deans should ask
executive hads of departments quite search
ing questions about provisions for carrying
advising when many members of a depart
ment propose to be on leave for a given year.
One instance has been reported in which a
member of a large department finds himself
during this academic year with 89 advisees
(graduate, undergraduate major, and Gen
eral Studies) because so many of his col
league are absent on leave. If a limit on ad
visees were set and adhered to, such ex
ploitation would not be permitted.
The Committee has thought very hard about
the place of advising in Stanford's status and
reward system for its faculty. At present, save

for one department that claims to adjust Its
teaching loads in proportion to advising loads,
advising is in fact extra-curricular, in that
it is supposed to be done but no one pays
much attention if it is not done. The Commit
tee is informed that advisers receive extra
pay in some universities, and it has discussed
whether bonus pay would be an incentive to
better advising. We are not satisfied that it
would. We have also asked how a faculty
member's advising effectiveness might be a
factor in his promotion and salary increment.
Nothing would please the Committee more
than to be shown a method of accurate evalua
tion of this effectiveness, so that it could be
used as one among other determinants. We
have yet to find a method. Even if the stu
dent were to choose his adviser, one could not
determine the adviser's effectiveness merely
by counting the number of his advisees.
The Committee believes that advising will
be able to play a role in the status and re
ward system only if the faculty becomes so
committed to the advising function (which,
for the Committee, is integral to the educa
tional function) that the very commitment
produces a means of reward. The faculty
must decide that advising is important, and
the faculty at large must expend some energy
in advising. Pressure probably ought to be
exerted on those of our colleagues who would
rather not advise students, although the very
reluctant adviser will likely not be a very
good one. Perhaps, in considerations of reward
and promotion, nothing more than a negative
question can be asked. If a brilliant research
er does no advising, can his research contribu
tions outweigh the absence of his contribu
tion to the University's humanity? In some in
stances, the answer might have to be "No."
So far as the Committee knows, the question
has never been asked.
Advising in the professor's profession. The
Committee has expressed its conviction that
advising students is properly a part of the
educational profession, that such an as
sumption ought if possible to be an element
in consideration of reward. We suggest, more
over, that prospective faculty appointees be
informed of advising obligations of Stanford
faculty members. We would also suggest a
more long-range way of achieving the actuality
of this assumption. It has often been pointed
out that among the weakest aspects of grad
uate education today is the failure to prepare
people for their profession. Graduate students
are trained to do research, but many of them
are hired to be teachers and members of fac
ulties. We do not wish to underplay research.
But too little is done to train those of our grad
uate students who will become teachers for
their actual professional functions. The Com
mittee suggests the advisability of instruc
tion for graduate students in the scope of the
objectives and responsibilities of their chosen
profession, which will help them comprehend
the expectations under which they will work.
Such instruction could go a long way toward
making actual the ideal that professors are
engaged in education, an activity that includes
research and publication, classroom teach
ing, and the education of individual students
outside of formal instruction that advising
ought to be. When education in that sense be
comes the basic assumption of the University's

life, we will be on the way toward the fulfill
ment of our humanity.

Epilogue:
Enablement and
Surveillance
It is hoped that in such a relatively casual
and self selecting system as that proposed
above, the quiet and unspectacular job that
needs to be done will proceed. But responsibili
ty for watching it must be lodged somewhere
more specific than in the hearts and minds of
the 20,000-odd souls of the Stanford commun
ity. There needs to be improved liaison among
agencies, assurance that stated functions are
being fulfilled, exhortation if not pressure
for participation in both given and receiving.
It was suggested, half jocularly, in the Com
mittee that what is wanted is a "University
humane ofTice.'The term is simplistic, but the
thought is precise. To indicate, to itself and
everyone else, that Stanford means its hu
manity, the responsibility should be assumed
by a highly placed officer, of at least Associate
Provost rank, whose responsibilities would in
clude the coordination of advising and coun
seling structures.
The Committee remains uncertain whether
the responsibility should be added to those
carried by the Dean of Students, whether it
should be assigned to a Dean of Undergraduate
Educationâ€”should such a position be rein
statedâ€”or whether a new position should be
created. In favor of the first is the fact that
the Dean of Students is now responsible for
several agencies in which counseling and ad
vising take place. On the other hand, the ed
ucational thrust of the entire program might
suggest that the responsibility be held by a
distinctly academic officer such as a Dean of
Undergraduate Education. At the same time,
the fact that advising and counseling must af
fect graduate as well as undergraduate stu
dents makes desirable that the officer not be
exclusively occupied with undergraduates.
Whoever such a person might be, and what
ever his title, he must be accessible to and
trustable by students, command the respect
and attract the cooperation of the faculty, and
display remarkable virtues to non-academic
staff persons.

This paper is presented to the University
community by the Committee on Advising and
Couast'lint; of the Study of Education at Stan
ford. It is important to say tliat the paper is
intended not as a recommendation for immedi
ate decision hut as some proposals for discus
sion.
Hearings will take place 7 9 p.m. Tuesday
and 4-fi p.m. Wednesday in room 143 of Meyer
Library. Members of the committee will be
present to receive comments on the paper. The
Committee also welcomes written responses to
the SES office, Meyer Library.
Few subjects are so frequently the target of
criticism as advising, few so rarely the object
of constructive suggestion. Widespread agree
ment thai advising is not very well done at
Stanford is equalled by imprecision as to the
problem and feasible solutions. Our realism
breeds cynicism, concluding that we must ac
cept inadequacy.
The Committee on Advising and Counseling
of the Study of Education at Stanford has at
tempted to be realistic but not cynical. Mow
ever unlikely the radical alteration of human
nature may be, the alteration of perspectives
and priorities is well within our reach. The
Committee urges the University's members,
however, that unless assumptions are modi
fied the cynics will he proven right. Foremost
among the assumptions that require adjust
ment is the tacit one that for a faculty mem
ber advising is an extracurricular activity.
This assumption produces hesitance on the
part of many students to consult advisers ex
cept for routine card-signing for fear of "tak
ing up his time," and their resultant complaint
that advising at Stanford is nothing but rou
tine. It produces the perception on the part of
faculty members that advising, except for one's
"own" special (preferably graduate) students,
is a chore to be avoided if possible and to be
disposed of quickly if avoidance is not possible.
It produces among administrators complete ig
norance of inequities in advising loads and the
ignoring of the function of advising in con
siderations of appointment, promotion, and re
ward.
The Committee is not so blindered as to sup
pose that advising is the most important as
pect of university life. But it is sensitive to
the penetration of aspects of advising into al
most everything Stanford does, from admis
sions to residence policy to undergraduate and
graduate curriculum to student services to the
extra-curriculum to placement and vocational
decisions. In what follows we have made some
assumption that bear explication. First, we
suppose that advising has basically to do with
the possibility of significant relations and com
munication between persons, that it sums up
what we intend by our sub-title: "the humani
ty of the University." Second, we assume that
the educational direction Stanford is taking
will entail more advising, not less, on both
graduate and undergraduate levels, and a high
er degree of humanity, not a lower. Third, we
assume that, since no system is perfect, an ar
rangement of advising that allows several
quite different forms and structures of advis
ing to take place will come closer to self-re
newal than a single, potentially rigid system.
The problem, as we presently see it, has
three points of focus: 1. the dissemination to
everyone who needs it of accurate and com
plete information; 2. the availability to anyone
who needs it of competent professional coun
seling; 3. the accessibility to all students of
Interested and personal academic advice.
I. Dissemination
of Information
The story about the man who did not have
enough information to take instruction is rele
vant to the problem of advising. The Commit
tee believes that adequate and accurate infor
mation on most matters regarding the Univer
sity is readily available to those who wish and
need to have it. Ignorance and misinformation
are widespread, however, some of it difficult
to understand.
The information that needs dissemination is
that which makes possible (1) awareness on
the part of faculty and students alike of exact
ly what the University's communal and aca
demic facilities are; (2) access by members of
the University to the various services provid
ed; (3) informed decisions about academic
matters on the part of students.
A great deal of this information can be and
is conveyed in print, but people forget things
when they read them in almost unnumerable
bulletins, pamphlets, brochures, hand-bills, mi
meographed or dittoed sheets, and the like.
The variety is compounded by the fact that
certain published materials are factual in na
ture and others are more propagandists in
tone and purpose, by the fact that some infor
mation is obsolete before it is ever printed and
some is incomplete.
The Committee suggests basic simplification
into two yearly publications. One is an expand
ed version of the present rather slim Informa
tion Bulletin, to serve as a more general hand
book to the University. Here should be de
tailed information on matters not covered in
Courses and Degrees: fees and expenses, resi
dences, relatively permanent organizations and
activities both student and University-wide,
services available to the community such as
those of the Health Service, the Counseling
and Testing Center, the Bechtel International
Center, and others. Also in such a handbook
might be found brief descriptions of the ad
ministrative operation of the University, the
duties and powers of its various officers, and
policies affecting various of its members.
Through such a publication, which should be
routinely in the hands of everyone, both stu
dents and faculty could find how to get help
for all kinds of problems. New students and
new faculty members in particular would, with

its aid, more easily find their ways in the Uni
versity.
Parenthetically, the Committee also sees a
need for a faculty handbook, which would in
form faculty members of such policies of ap
pointment, promotion, tenure, and administra
tive arrangement as are especially relevant to
them.
The Committee wishes, moreover, that Cour
ses and I)egre<>s might he improved. The in
formation in it is frequently obsolete before
the book comes off the press. Might there not
be in the den of someone at Stanford printing
methods that could reduce the lag between
copy deadlines and publication? Would the
improvement of accuracy allowed by an Aug
ust publication date outweigh the advantage
for incoming students of the present May pub
lication? Students and advisers alike now hesi
tate to use Courses and Degrees as a basis
for planning the work of even a single year in
advance. The Committee wonders, then, wheth
er usefulness for planning to those already
here should not have priority over usefulness
for those about to come. In the light of the in
creasing need for advanced academic planning
by students, greater accuracy becomes even
more desirable. Moreover, if Courses and De
grees wore improved and up-dated, the expense
of the quarterly Time Schedule might be re
duced by making it no more than a supple
ment to Courses and Degrees.
All of these publications would bo of im
mense help to advisers and their advisees. The
Committee is of the opinion that the adviser's
function should not be to disseminate informa
tion that the student can more readily receive
otherwise. In saying that, we take full cog
nizance of the high likelihood that anything in
print will be misunderstood, misconstrued, or
misused somewhere by someone. Where the
adviser perceives ignorance, he must, of
course, rectify itâ€”and the student may do the
same. The adviser will function well with an
advisee when both have the necessary infor
mation, for then the adviser is free to advise
instead of merely to inform.
Concomitantly, the Committee believes that
the adviser should be relieved of policing cur
ricular regulations. So much of academic ad
vising is taken up with routine questions about
the fulfillment of requirements (How many
units of Science have you left to take? How
much math? etc.) that time for genuine and
personalized advice is too often at a premium.
The Committee has a hunch, moreover, (1)
that on the whole students know the require
ments in General Studies and in major pro
grams better than their advisers do, and (2)
that students almost always know exactly
where they stand with regard to those require
ments. The Committee wonders about the feas
ibility of computerizing information of these
kinds to enable easy retrieval. If machines can
free us for the improvement of our humanity,
we should by all means use them.
In short, the Committee believes that advis
ing could be far better focussed on advice if
the dissemination of information were both
simplified and improved, so that the adviser
does not have to be a traffic cop of regulations.
11. Availability
of Counseling
For clarity of terminology, we use the term
"counseling" to mean the impartation of help
for problems of a personal sort, not immediate
ly involving the academic, while "advising" is
restricted in this paper to academic advice.
It is certainly the case that a great deal of
counseling in this sense occurs in any commu
nity as large and as complex as Stanford. Most
of it is casual, among close friends, and with
no pretense of professional expertise. This
sort of counseling will happen whether the
institution encourages or discourages it. Any
attempt to structure such relationships is, of
course, doomed to failure. Faculty members
also do a great deal of counseling of this kind.
Though some may criticize the non-profession
al nature of such counseling, that may in itself
bo one of the'strengths of the relationship. At
the same time, situations frequently arise
where professional counseling is needed and
any casual counselor should always have in
mind the possibility of referring someone to
sources of professional aid. The Committee has
not conceived of any way by which faculty or
other such occasional counselors might cus
tomarily be taught how to recognize danger
signals, but they should be aware of an obli
gation to suggest referral.
Nevertheless, sources of professional coun
seling are present at Stanford, and the Com
mittee has been surprise that some members
of the University, both faculty and students,
seem unaware of them. Apart from the coun
seling done in residences < faculty residents,
residence directors, resident assistants, tutors,
and sponsors), which would have to be called
at best semi-professional, counseling done by
campus religious representatives, and that
done in special circumstances by persons in
the Dean of Students' office, the University
maintains two major sources of professional
counseling and a third that might become one.
We refer in the first instance to the Counsel
ing and Testing Center and to the psychiatric
services of the Cowell Health Center, and in
the second instance to the Placement Service.
The Counseling and Testing Center provides
psychological testing of many kinds and both
short-range and long-range psychological coun
seling. The psychiatric staff of the Cowell
Health Center is available for psychiatric con
sultation and some forms of therapy, and pa
tients in need of long-range therapy are re
ferred to psychiatrists in the School of Medi
cine for it.
The Committee has no wish to enter into the
relative merits of these two approaches, be
lieving that both meet various kinds of situ
ations helpfully. The liaison between the Conn

soling and Testing Center and the Cowell
Health reportedly good and getting
better. Such liaison and cooperation should be
encouraged by the University administration.
The fact that a relatively small proportion of
Stanford students uses the counseling services
in these two institutions may be an index of
the community's relatively healthy mental
state. On the other hand, experience hÂ°re and
in other universities would seem to indicate
that there are many more problems than are
actually met by these services. Larger staffs
would doubtless encourage more students with
real problems to seek aid.
It has been rightly observed that while any
person lacks the medical or psychological
help he needs, the job of counseling is not be
ing properly done. One of our faculty col
leagues recently stated that "One student sui
cide per year is one too many," a sentiment
with which no one could quarrel. But preven
tion in the realm of counseling is the most
difficult task. For one thing, it requires the
willing cooperation of the patient or subject.
The continued excellence and improvement
of these two services seems to the Committee,
however, a matter of rather high priority. We
are in a period where the mental strains upon
the age group of Stanford students are great
and on the increase. It is no pampering mood
that leads to the conclusion that professional
aid is needed; it is rather the sense of urgency
that informs higher education, and the wish
that barriers to the best education every stu
dent is capable of absorbing be as far as possi
ble thrown down. We do not believe that the
improvement of, say, the Counseling and Test
ing Center is more important than the im
provement of the faculty. But believing in the
priority of the academic, we wish it to be aided
by the best medical and psychological services
Stanford can afford to render.
We have few specific recommendations,
apart from general improvementâ€”which In
itself ought not to be taken as underhanded
criticism. The first contact with the Counsel
ing and Testing Center ought to make clear
to entering students that genuine personal
counsel may be had there. We are dubious
that the orientation-week testing is a good in
troduction for students, valuable as the re
sults may be for staff research. The counsel
ing function should be made more distinct
from that of legitimate research.
The most difficult question with which the
Committee has long wrestled is how to be
sure that the people who need the help receive
it. To that question, we have no satisfactory
answer. The availability of the services should
b" widely publicized and accurately described.
Every member of the University should know
about them. But the person who refuses to
seek help when he needs it can not, by any
means the Committee has been able to discov
er, be forced to have it.
The Committee notes with satisfaction the
recent improvements in the situation of reli
gious ministries on the campus. Although not
every religious tradition is officially repre
sented, persons desiring counseling of a reli
gious sort have access to a broad range of
clergymen and denominational representatives.
Since campus office space was made available
to denominational representatives, the work
of the Pean of the Chapel and his assistant
and of the University Chaplain has been en
larged by cooperation. To those who doubt the
propriety of the presence of clergymen on a
university campus, the Committee would say
that the day when religious bodies looked on
the ministry to students as a salvage operation
from the godless university is long past. Safe
guards against irresponsibility in this as in
other areas of interest can be established ad
ministratively. Those members of the Univer
sity who find religious counsel helpful and nec
essary can and do seek it out.
By virtue of the fact that Selective Service
is of immediate concern to the majority of
Stanford students, the Committee has consid
ered advising facilities offered regarding the
draft. A National Service Adviser has for
some time been available. The Committee ap
plauds the addition of a counselor on con
scientious objection to the student facilities
available on campus. We anticipate that such
an office will be continued while the question
of the draft is pertinent, and suggest that the
amount of student need for such counsel re
quires the availability of more time than is
now provided. The different natures of the
counseling involved makes it advisable to keep
separate the conscientious objection counsel
ing and National Service advising. Greater co
ordination of the latter with the ROTC offices
and the Placement Service would facilitate the
answering of questions faced by many stu
dents in regard to the options available for
fulfillment of military service. However, the
effectiveness of both offices is hampered at
present by lack of information reaching the
student. Publicizing these services in the hand
book to the University proposed above, and by
whatever means are now available, and the
initiation of orientation sessions with tutors,
residence assistants, and directors may begin
to alleviate this inadequacy.
The Placement Service is kept until last be
cause the Committee believes substantial ex
pansion is possible and desirable. At present
the Placement Service is a means to bring
prospective employees into contact with pros
pective employers and to aid students to re
ceive part-time and summer jobs. With ex
pense (the Committee does not wish to guess
how much* and reorganization, the Placement
Service could become a Career Guidance Cen
ter. This change would put job interviews into
perspective as aspects of a more thorough in
vestigation by the individual of his wishes and
talents for a career. Facilities for aptitude
tests of various kinds would be needed, as well
as staff to process and counsel regarding such
tests. For this purpose, it would he well to
shift the efforts in career counseling now car
ried on by the Counseling and Testing Center
to an expanded Career Guidance Center. Infor

mation on opportunities and requisites for ca
reers of many kinds could conveniently be
gathered and sometimes produced by a Career
Guidance Center, and one might expect to find
in it the current catalogues of graduate and
professional schools across the country.
It has often been remarked that, for all the
Founders' desires that a Stanford education
should fit students for useful pursuits, the ac
cessibility of career counsel is rather slim
hÂ°re. In feeling that the situation bears im
provement the Committee does not imply that
every student should have made a clear voca
tional choice by the end of his senior year. But
students wishing to make informed and ra
tional choices of careers should have access as
early as possible to information and individual
ized counsel regarding the options. A Career
Guidance Center might have the contacts to
place students in part-time and temporary
jobs with persons in careers that the students
are considering, experience which might be
invaluable whether it be positive or negative.
Other methods of gaining insight into vari
ous kinds of professional life may likewise
gain momentum. A proposal now being con
sidered suggests the establishment of sopho
more and higher level courses on the profes
sions, taught from the perspectives of both
the humanities and the social sciences. Such
courses would be informational and descriptive
and in no sense recruitment techniques. Still
other means might be found to make available
for students bases for wise career decisions.
The present admirable advising done by facul
ty members of the School of Medicine with
and for pre-medical students could profitably
be emulated elsewhere. Could not the Schools
of Law, Business, and Education, for example,
provide similar counsel in cooperation with a
Career Guidance Center? The Committee pre
sumes that remuneration occupations will for
some time be necessary for most members of
American society. There is point, therefore, to
the thought that education can be useful, even
though that is far from being the whole point
of education.
111. Academic
Advising
If personal counseling is very largely done
casually and by amateurs, so is academic ad
vising. Most of the advising done at Stanford
is done by one undergraduate to another. The
Committee heartily approves this state of af
fairs at the same time that it is not satisfied
to abandon faculty advising.
Student Advising. Several aspects of under
graduate advising are carried by undergradu
ates. Students get their best information about
the value of specific courses from other stu
dents who have taken them. This is only natu
ral. Faculty members are loath to comment
on their colleagues, for reasons of professional
propriety; students are not. Moreover, faculty
members can talk about courses taught by
their colleagues only by hearsay, where stu
dents can speak at first hand. Such informal
advising is valuable, even though it is fre
quently biased. Sporadic attempts have been
made to bring it usefully into published form,
with such documents as the Course Review,
succeeding the earlier "Scratch Sheet." The
Committee applauds the concept of a student
Course Review as a valuable asset to advising,
and wishes that it might be thorough in its
coverage of courses, representative of a varie
ty of student reactions, and sensitive to stated
aims of professors in courses. Such a review
would also inform professors helpfully about
responses to the courses. The Course Review
ought to appear regularly, with cooperation
and financial assistance from the University
but without administrative control.
A recent experiment in appointing students
as advisers-at-large in their major departments
produced uncertain results. The fault may lie
partially in a lack of information about the
program, in student suspicion that student
advisers would be "administration types," in
students' feelings that they could get as good
advice from their friendsâ€”or in any possible
combination of those and other factors. The
Committee is not satisfied that student de
partmental advising is a bad idea, especially
on the basis of one year's experiment in three
departments. It exhorts departments and
schools to keep trying to find ways of taking
advantage of students' advising abilities.
The function of the adviser. We have already
expressed the Committee's suggestion that ad
vising not be simply a matter of policing, of
making sure that the student has information
and is taking the courses he is required to
take. The Adviser's Handbook describes the
goal of advising as bringing "the student to
the point where he can assume a maximum
amount of responsibility for his own academic
program and can make wise decisions on his
own" (p. 12). The Committee wishes to go be
yond that to propose that the adviser be
viewed both by the student and by himself as
the student's academic advocate, the particular
educator who agrees to concern himself with
his advisee's best education. This means prin
cipally that the adviser wishes to help the
student plan an educational career that goes
somewhere, that has coherence and point to it,
rather than being a miscellaneous collection
of requirements and aimless electives. If the
adviser is the student's advocate, however, this
coherence must be a means of enabling the
student's wishes and strengths to be embodied
in his program, not a way for the adviser to
impose his own concepts on the student.
Such a concept would, to he sure, produce
advising that takes more time, for carefully
considering with a student his academic ob
jectives and intellectual curiosities consumes
more time that simply signing his card. But if
such advising is understood and underscored
by tin 1 faculty as integral 1o education, faculty
members may more happily engage in it. It

poses several problems, among which is the
acceptance of advising as a normal aspect of
academic appointment at Stanford. If such
advising will not be done by the faculty, some
one must do it. In the absence of good faculty
advising, a corps of professional advisers
would probably have to be retained to the dam
age of the budget and of the academic exper
tise with which advising ought to be done. On
all counts, the Committee emphatically prefers
faculty advising.
The student's stake in advising. A curious
duality is sometimes to be observed among
students. On the one hand, they firmly ob
ject to be treated as ciphers or as children by
an institution standing in loco parentis. On
the other .they wish the advice of their elders
among the faculty, and this wish is sometimes
Indistinguishable from a desire for a parent
surrogate. Occasionally, when the advice given
is not to an individual's liking, he will pro
test that he is not being respected. We point
this out in part to say that the students' own
view of their stake in advising is not crystal
clear.
Although the student knows more about
himself than any adviser is ever likely to
know, he needs advising because he has not
enough experience of education to know pre
cisely how to join his interests and talents
to a curricular regimen. This observation ap
plies equally, though in different perspectives,
to undergraduates and graduate students. The
student looks to an adviser for guidance in
pursuing an education that will take ad
vantage of his interests and lead him beyond
his own provincial boundaries, at the same
time that it is certifiable by the University as
meeting its standards. The University, of
course, must determine what those standards
are, since it is the body doing the certifying.
The adviser stands toward the student in the
peculiar position of being at once a represen
tative of the University's power of sanction
upon the student (he makes judgments on stu
dents' performance) and and the advocate of
that particula student in the acquisition of his
most effective education.
If the structure of degree requirements on
the graduate level becomes less prescriptive,
the premium on interested advising which
aids the student toward coherence as well as
adventuresomeness will rise. Experience will
count for much in a student's planning, al
though it should not be prescriptively applied.
What is at stake for the student in a more flex
ible under-graduate program is precisely the
humanity of an adviser who is genuinely the
student's educational advocate. If the program
is flexible, advocacy need not consist in find
ing ways to circumvent regulations.
The levels of advising and their problems.
Special and different problems of advising ob
tain for freshmen, transfers, upperclass un
dergraduates and departmental majors, and
graduate students. At the same time, the Com
mittee is convinced of one true observation:
the best advising takes place where advisee
and adviser have some kind of common bond,
beyond the routine. This may be the bond of
the same field of study (the normal pre-set
bond between graduate students and faculty),
some common experience (frequently that the
student has taken the faculty member's
course), or prior acquaintance.
From this standpoint, the advising of fresh
men is the most difficult task, for freshmen
rarely have any existing bond to a faculty
member. It must be established. The Commit
tee has been divided upon several possible ways
to handle freshman advising. That the faculty
should carry the bulk of the advising seems
wise, yet a student's assigned adviser only
rarely turns out to be important or helpful
to him. As the freshman year curriculum now
stands, freshmen rarely come into close con
tact with faculty members, except those al
-most as transient as themselves: English
TA's, Western Civ instructors, lab TA's, and
beginning math and language TA's. The In
crease of Freshman seminars may improve
the range of faculty contact. The plans of
assigning advisers to groups in living units
has been extremely spotty in its effectiveness,
and it suffers from the fact that the advisers
remain abstractly faculty members, rather
than being perceived in their active teaching
roles. Relationships of freshman to faculty
residents or directors of living units, to tutors,
and to sponsors are relatively close, and these
persons in fact do the bulk of freshman ad
vising. The Trancos experiment is one possible
model of freshman advising, where residence
director, sponsors and tutors, and a team of
faculty advisers work closely together. Fresh
man advising ought to aid in the orientation
of the entering student, j.etting him off on the
right foot, proposing seriously that he identify
areas of genuine intellectual interest. Such
advising should prepare the student to find
a permanent academic adviser as he goes.
The Committee is unanimous in suggesting
that advising will become more effective from
all sides if the student ultimately chooses his
own adviser. In fact this frequently happens
now, except that the adviser whom the stu
dent chooses is often not the one responsible
for signing his card. We see the following
arguments in favor of this idea: 1. The stu
dent will most likely choose a faculty mem
ber whom he has seen in action, knows some
thing of his qualities and the "cut of his jib."
2. Such a relationship would underscore the
obligation of both student and adviser for
tion in which the student is interested and
tion In which the student is interested an
which makes coherent academic sense of his
interests and career plans. (The Committee
believes, parenthetically, that changing ad
visers and programs ought to be quite easy,
with no prejudice attached to it.) 3. If the
structure of the freshman year becomes less
prescribed, freshmen will have access to a
broader range of course options and of faculty
members than is now the case and will be
more likely to identify someone with whom
they believe they can work.
Certain problems with this arrangement can
be foreseen. 1. Some very popular professors
will be swamped with advisees, and other fac
ulty members will have few or none. To this
the Committee would propose that limitations
on the number of advisees per faculty member
be administratively established (see below.) 2.
Understaffed departments will have too many
majors to observe the limitations, and will have
to continue assigning majors to advisers. To
this the Committee proposes that the student's
adviser need not, though he may, be in the stu
dent's own major department. If the adviser is
not charged to keep track of regulations, it is
not at all unlikely that a professor in one de
partment can help a student in another to pur
sue a course that both meets the standards laid
down by the department and satisfies the stu
dent's own academic needs and wants. Depart
ments might require countersignature of study
cards by departmental representatives. Any
student seriously wishing to become a his
torian, for example, will probably try to find
a historian as adviser in order to get help in
preparing to be like him. We recognize that
in some programs, e.g. Philosophy and the
Honors Program in Humanities, the adviser
docs considerable tutoring of the student in
his senior year. This does not seem to us in
compatible with the basic premise. We are in
clined, on the undergraduate level, to resist
departmental "imperialism," which demands
control over "its" students. An undergraduate
major need not, after all, be occupational prep
aration, but, especially in the Humanities and
Social Sciences, is rather a point of co
herence for one's entire liberal education. Stu
dents who wish strong identification with a
discipline or department may gain it by choos
ing advisers there. Students who do not want
such a concentration may be well served by
advisers from almost anywhere in the Uni
versity.
Such a plan would introduce a differentia
tion between freshman and upperclass advis
ing, in place of the present differentiation be
tween General Studies and major advising.
The Committee is inclined to believe that the
former differentiation would make all advis
ing more effective with regard to general ed
ucation. We are not yet agreed as to the time
when a student must have chosen his adviser.
Some might stay with the person to whom they
were assigned as freshmen; others would find
an adviser during the freshman year; still
others during the sophomore year. Some stu
dents might have three or four different ad
visers during their careers. We see no compel
ing reason why that should be forbidden,
though frequent changes may be a signal that
counseling of some kind is needed. As at pres
ent, students will continue to seek out advice
from faculty members whom they like and
trust, no matter who is the officially designated
adviser. The present suggestion is intended to
take advantage of that fact of life.
The advising of graduate students might
seem to be self-evident. No one except grad
uate students themselves seems to feel it a
problem. Some responsibilities which many

departments seem not to handle well with
graduate students are the following: (1) intro
ducing new students to the University; (2) in
forming students about and channeling them,
when need is present, to the Counseling and
Testing Center, Cowell Halth Service, the
Placement Service, etc.; (3) giving students
vocational advice and sometimes placing them;
(4) informing new students about housing pos
sibilities and problems; (5) informing students
about useful training obtainable on a reg
ular basis in other departments. The pro
blem here is different from that of under
graduates in that the graduate student is
earnestly in the process of professional prep
aration. There is a certain emulative aspect to
graduate study, therefore, because many grad
uate students (certainly not nearly 100%) are
working with people with whom they expect
ultimately to become colleagues. It seems to
us probable that at present graduate students
select their own advisers to an extent that un
dergraduate do not. The function of faculty in
attracting graduate students to any university
assures that the potential of full relationships
is present. A stronger administrative surveil
lance of graduate advising might help to over
come the deficiences of individual departments.
Some special problems. Three groups of stu
dents present special problems to which the
Committee does not yet have answers. It is
clear that transfer students could use far bet
ter help on arrival than most of them get. It is
also clear that their problems are different
from those faced by freshman. We believe that
transfer students should bo given high priority
for on-campus housing. It also seems to us
that the evaluation of transfer credits could
be expedited and improved in many ways.
Some faculty members might be especially en
couraged to handle transfer students. We de
sire further suggestions about the advising of
transfer students from anyone with ideas to
give.
Another group of students with problems to
which the Committee has not yet given
sufficient attention is foreign students. The
Beehtel International Center is a source of
remarkably fine personal attention to foreign
students. But this group has academic prob
lems peculiarly their own, and some made of
advising needs, we think, to be tailored to
them. Again, the Committee wishes to be
helped by ideas.
The third group is comprised of members
of minorities with special disadvantages. Ad
vising needs to have cognizance both of the
personal problems faced by such students and
of academic needs. Efforts to provide tutoring
from the Office of Financial Aids have been
sporadic, due largely to stringently limited
funds. Some more formal program of tutoring
and counsel would greatly increase the accessi
bility of an adequate Stanford education for
such students. Stanford has publicly stated its
intention to do the right thing by these per
sons. Additional support, morally and mone
tarily, needs to be provided.
The extent and rewards of advising. The
Committee believes that advising on all levels
should be taken together in figuring the aver
age ratio of advisees to advisers. Taking fig
ures in the fall Student Directory as sub

stantially correct for numbers of majors and
graduate students in the Schools and Depart
ments, and taking a count of faculty at As
sistant Professor or higher in Courses and De
grees as substantially correct (realizing that
many people in the latter are absent on leave),
and assuming that all of those faculty advise
majors and graduate students, we find the fol
lowing ratios by schools of major and grad
uate advisees to advisers:
Earth Sciences 5.8 (169/29)
Engineering 13.4 (2114A58)
Humanities & Sciences 11.7 (4739/405)
The figures for present General Studies ad
vising, however, look rather different. 115
persons are engaged in 1967-68 in General
Studies advising of 2330 students without de
clared majors, a ratio of 20.2G advisees to each
adviser. Sources of General Studies advisers
are as follows:
Earth Sciences 7 (24% of
school faculty)
Engineering 11 (6.9% of
school faculty)
Humanities & Sciences 45 (11.1% of
school faculty)
Medicine 12
Military Science 2
Physical Education 3
Education 2
Administration 33
The figures show the difficulties encountered
by the Registrar in his task of recruiting
General Studies Advisers. Only 63 ( 54.8%) of
present General Studies advisers come from
the faculties of Schools which will enroll the
advisees as majors. Moreover, only 39% of
General Studies advisers come from the School
of Humanities and Sciences, which can rea
sonably expect to enroll about 80% of un
dergraduates.
At the same time, figures received from De
partments of the School of Humanities and
Sciences show a very wide variation in the
actual advising practice of departments. Some
departments average as few as 4 departmental
advisees per adviser, whereas members of
others may have as many as 66 major ad
visees. Such a figure seems to the Committee
a mockery of the very idea of advising.
One can be only routine with that many ad
visees. The Committee is inclined to believe
that an upper limit on the number of allowable
advisees per adviser should be set, perhaps at
25 or 30, such a figure to include both grad
uate and undergraduate students. The Com
mittee also believes that Deans should ask
executive hads of departments quite search
ing questions about provisions for carrying
advising when many members of a depart
ment propose to be on leave for a given year.
One instance has been reported in which a
member of a large department finds himself
during this academic year with 89 advisees
(graduate, undergraduate major, and Gen
eral Studies) because so many of his col
league are absent on leave. If a limit on ad
visees were set and adhered to, such ex
ploitation would not be permitted.
The Committee has thought very hard about
the place of advising in Stanford's status and
reward system for its faculty. At present, save

for one department that claims to adjust Its
teaching loads in proportion to advising loads,
advising is in fact extra-curricular, in that
it is supposed to be done but no one pays
much attention if it is not done. The Commit
tee is informed that advisers receive extra
pay in some universities, and it has discussed
whether bonus pay would be an incentive to
better advising. We are not satisfied that it
would. We have also asked how a faculty
member's advising effectiveness might be a
factor in his promotion and salary increment.
Nothing would please the Committee more
than to be shown a method of accurate evalua
tion of this effectiveness, so that it could be
used as one among other determinants. We
have yet to find a method. Even if the stu
dent were to choose his adviser, one could not
determine the adviser's effectiveness merely
by counting the number of his advisees.
The Committee believes that advising will
be able to play a role in the status and re
ward system only if the faculty becomes so
committed to the advising function (which,
for the Committee, is integral to the educa
tional function) that the very commitment
produces a means of reward. The faculty
must decide that advising is important, and
the faculty at large must expend some energy
in advising. Pressure probably ought to be
exerted on those of our colleagues who would
rather not advise students, although the very
reluctant adviser will likely not be a very
good one. Perhaps, in considerations of reward
and promotion, nothing more than a negative
question can be asked. If a brilliant research
er does no advising, can his research contribu
tions outweigh the absence of his contribu
tion to the University's humanity? In some in
stances, the answer might have to be "No."
So far as the Committee knows, the question
has never been asked.
Advising in the professor's profession. The
Committee has expressed its conviction that
advising students is properly a part of the
educational profession, that such an as
sumption ought if possible to be an element
in consideration of reward. We suggest, more
over, that prospective faculty appointees be
informed of advising obligations of Stanford
faculty members. We would also suggest a
more long-range way of achieving the actuality
of this assumption. It has often been pointed
out that among the weakest aspects of grad
uate education today is the failure to prepare
people for their profession. Graduate students
are trained to do research, but many of them
are hired to be teachers and members of fac
ulties. We do not wish to underplay research.
But too little is done to train those of our grad
uate students who will become teachers for
their actual professional functions. The Com
mittee suggests the advisability of instruc
tion for graduate students in the scope of the
objectives and responsibilities of their chosen
profession, which will help them comprehend
the expectations under which they will work.
Such instruction could go a long way toward
making actual the ideal that professors are
engaged in education, an activity that includes
research and publication, classroom teach
ing, and the education of individual students
outside of formal instruction that advising
ought to be. When education in that sense be
comes the basic assumption of the University's

life, we will be on the way toward the fulfill
ment of our humanity.

Epilogue:
Enablement and
Surveillance
It is hoped that in such a relatively casual
and self selecting system as that proposed
above, the quiet and unspectacular job that
needs to be done will proceed. But responsibili
ty for watching it must be lodged somewhere
more specific than in the hearts and minds of
the 20,000-odd souls of the Stanford commun
ity. There needs to be improved liaison among
agencies, assurance that stated functions are
being fulfilled, exhortation if not pressure
for participation in both given and receiving.
It was suggested, half jocularly, in the Com
mittee that what is wanted is a "University
humane ofTice.'The term is simplistic, but the
thought is precise. To indicate, to itself and
everyone else, that Stanford means its hu
manity, the responsibility should be assumed
by a highly placed officer, of at least Associate
Provost rank, whose responsibilities would in
clude the coordination of advising and coun
seling structures.
The Committee remains uncertain whether
the responsibility should be added to those
carried by the Dean of Students, whether it
should be assigned to a Dean of Undergraduate
Educationâ€”should such a position be rein
statedâ€”or whether a new position should be
created. In favor of the first is the fact that
the Dean of Students is now responsible for
several agencies in which counseling and ad
vising take place. On the other hand, the ed
ucational thrust of the entire program might
suggest that the responsibility be held by a
distinctly academic officer such as a Dean of
Undergraduate Education. At the same time,
the fact that advising and counseling must af
fect graduate as well as undergraduate stu
dents makes desirable that the officer not be
exclusively occupied with undergraduates.
Whoever such a person might be, and what
ever his title, he must be accessible to and
trustable by students, command the respect
and attract the cooperation of the faculty, and
display remarkable virtues to non-academic
staff persons.

This paper is presented to the University
community by the Committee on Advising and
Couast'lint; of the Study of Education at Stan
ford. It is important to say tliat the paper is
intended not as a recommendation for immedi
ate decision hut as some proposals for discus
sion.
Hearings will take place 7 9 p.m. Tuesday
and 4-fi p.m. Wednesday in room 143 of Meyer
Library. Members of the committee will be
present to receive comments on the paper. The
Committee also welcomes written responses to
the SES office, Meyer Library.
Few subjects are so frequently the target of
criticism as advising, few so rarely the object
of constructive suggestion. Widespread agree
ment thai advising is not very well done at
Stanford is equalled by imprecision as to the
problem and feasible solutions. Our realism
breeds cynicism, concluding that we must ac
cept inadequacy.
The Committee on Advising and Counseling
of the Study of Education at Stanford has at
tempted to be realistic but not cynical. Mow
ever unlikely the radical alteration of human
nature may be, the alteration of perspectives
and priorities is well within our reach. The
Committee urges the University's members,
however, that unless assumptions are modi
fied the cynics will he proven right. Foremost
among the assumptions that require adjust
ment is the tacit one that for a faculty mem
ber advising is an extracurricular activity.
This assumption produces hesitance on the
part of many students to consult advisers ex
cept for routine card-signing for fear of "tak
ing up his time," and their resultant complaint
that advising at Stanford is nothing but rou
tine. It produces the perception on the part of
faculty members that advising, except for one's
"own" special (preferably graduate) students,
is a chore to be avoided if possible and to be
disposed of quickly if avoidance is not possible.
It produces among administrators complete ig
norance of inequities in advising loads and the
ignoring of the function of advising in con
siderations of appointment, promotion, and re
ward.
The Committee is not so blindered as to sup
pose that advising is the most important as
pect of university life. But it is sensitive to
the penetration of aspects of advising into al
most everything Stanford does, from admis
sions to residence policy to undergraduate and
graduate curriculum to student services to the
extra-curriculum to placement and vocational
decisions. In what follows we have made some
assumption that bear explication. First, we
suppose that advising has basically to do with
the possibility of significant relations and com
munication between persons, that it sums up
what we intend by our sub-title: "the humani
ty of the University." Second, we assume that
the educational direction Stanford is taking
will entail more advising, not less, on both
graduate and undergraduate levels, and a high
er degree of humanity, not a lower. Third, we
assume that, since no system is perfect, an ar
rangement of advising that allows several
quite different forms and structures of advis
ing to take place will come closer to self-re
newal than a single, potentially rigid system.
The problem, as we presently see it, has
three points of focus: 1. the dissemination to
everyone who needs it of accurate and com
plete information; 2. the availability to anyone
who needs it of competent professional coun
seling; 3. the accessibility to all students of
Interested and personal academic advice.
I. Dissemination
of Information
The story about the man who did not have
enough information to take instruction is rele
vant to the problem of advising. The Commit
tee believes that adequate and accurate infor
mation on most matters regarding the Univer
sity is readily available to those who wish and
need to have it. Ignorance and misinformation
are widespread, however, some of it difficult
to understand.
The information that needs dissemination is
that which makes possible (1) awareness on
the part of faculty and students alike of exact
ly what the University's communal and aca
demic facilities are; (2) access by members of
the University to the various services provid
ed; (3) informed decisions about academic
matters on the part of students.
A great deal of this information can be and
is conveyed in print, but people forget things
when they read them in almost unnumerable
bulletins, pamphlets, brochures, hand-bills, mi
meographed or dittoed sheets, and the like.
The variety is compounded by the fact that
certain published materials are factual in na
ture and others are more propagandists in
tone and purpose, by the fact that some infor
mation is obsolete before it is ever printed and
some is incomplete.
The Committee suggests basic simplification
into two yearly publications. One is an expand
ed version of the present rather slim Informa
tion Bulletin, to serve as a more general hand
book to the University. Here should be de
tailed information on matters not covered in
Courses and Degrees: fees and expenses, resi
dences, relatively permanent organizations and
activities both student and University-wide,
services available to the community such as
those of the Health Service, the Counseling
and Testing Center, the Bechtel International
Center, and others. Also in such a handbook
might be found brief descriptions of the ad
ministrative operation of the University, the
duties and powers of its various officers, and
policies affecting various of its members.
Through such a publication, which should be
routinely in the hands of everyone, both stu
dents and faculty could find how to get help
for all kinds of problems. New students and
new faculty members in particular would, with

its aid, more easily find their ways in the Uni
versity.
Parenthetically, the Committee also sees a
need for a faculty handbook, which would in
form faculty members of such policies of ap
pointment, promotion, tenure, and administra
tive arrangement as are especially relevant to
them.
The Committee wishes, moreover, that Cour
ses and I)egre<>s might he improved. The in
formation in it is frequently obsolete before
the book comes off the press. Might there not
be in the den of someone at Stanford printing
methods that could reduce the lag between
copy deadlines and publication? Would the
improvement of accuracy allowed by an Aug
ust publication date outweigh the advantage
for incoming students of the present May pub
lication? Students and advisers alike now hesi
tate to use Courses and Degrees as a basis
for planning the work of even a single year in
advance. The Committee wonders, then, wheth
er usefulness for planning to those already
here should not have priority over usefulness
for those about to come. In the light of the in
creasing need for advanced academic planning
by students, greater accuracy becomes even
more desirable. Moreover, if Courses and De
grees wore improved and up-dated, the expense
of the quarterly Time Schedule might be re
duced by making it no more than a supple
ment to Courses and Degrees.
All of these publications would bo of im
mense help to advisers and their advisees. The
Committee is of the opinion that the adviser's
function should not be to disseminate informa
tion that the student can more readily receive
otherwise. In saying that, we take full cog
nizance of the high likelihood that anything in
print will be misunderstood, misconstrued, or
misused somewhere by someone. Where the
adviser perceives ignorance, he must, of
course, rectify itâ€”and the student may do the
same. The adviser will function well with an
advisee when both have the necessary infor
mation, for then the adviser is free to advise
instead of merely to inform.
Concomitantly, the Committee believes that
the adviser should be relieved of policing cur
ricular regulations. So much of academic ad
vising is taken up with routine questions about
the fulfillment of requirements (How many
units of Science have you left to take? How
much math? etc.) that time for genuine and
personalized advice is too often at a premium.
The Committee has a hunch, moreover, (1)
that on the whole students know the require
ments in General Studies and in major pro
grams better than their advisers do, and (2)
that students almost always know exactly
where they stand with regard to those require
ments. The Committee wonders about the feas
ibility of computerizing information of these
kinds to enable easy retrieval. If machines can
free us for the improvement of our humanity,
we should by all means use them.
In short, the Committee believes that advis
ing could be far better focussed on advice if
the dissemination of information were both
simplified and improved, so that the adviser
does not have to be a traffic cop of regulations.
11. Availability
of Counseling
For clarity of terminology, we use the term
"counseling" to mean the impartation of help
for problems of a personal sort, not immediate
ly involving the academic, while "advising" is
restricted in this paper to academic advice.
It is certainly the case that a great deal of
counseling in this sense occurs in any commu
nity as large and as complex as Stanford. Most
of it is casual, among close friends, and with
no pretense of professional expertise. This
sort of counseling will happen whether the
institution encourages or discourages it. Any
attempt to structure such relationships is, of
course, doomed to failure. Faculty members
also do a great deal of counseling of this kind.
Though some may criticize the non-profession
al nature of such counseling, that may in itself
bo one of the'strengths of the relationship. At
the same time, situations frequently arise
where professional counseling is needed and
any casual counselor should always have in
mind the possibility of referring someone to
sources of professional aid. The Committee has
not conceived of any way by which faculty or
other such occasional counselors might cus
tomarily be taught how to recognize danger
signals, but they should be aware of an obli
gation to suggest referral.
Nevertheless, sources of professional coun
seling are present at Stanford, and the Com
mittee has been surprise that some members
of the University, both faculty and students,
seem unaware of them. Apart from the coun
seling done in residences < faculty residents,
residence directors, resident assistants, tutors,
and sponsors), which would have to be called
at best semi-professional, counseling done by
campus religious representatives, and that
done in special circumstances by persons in
the Dean of Students' office, the University
maintains two major sources of professional
counseling and a third that might become one.
We refer in the first instance to the Counsel
ing and Testing Center and to the psychiatric
services of the Cowell Health Center, and in
the second instance to the Placement Service.
The Counseling and Testing Center provides
psychological testing of many kinds and both
short-range and long-range psychological coun
seling. The psychiatric staff of the Cowell
Health Center is available for psychiatric con
sultation and some forms of therapy, and pa
tients in need of long-range therapy are re
ferred to psychiatrists in the School of Medi
cine for it.
The Committee has no wish to enter into the
relative merits of these two approaches, be
lieving that both meet various kinds of situ
ations helpfully. The liaison between the Conn

soling and Testing Center and the Cowell
Health reportedly good and getting
better. Such liaison and cooperation should be
encouraged by the University administration.
The fact that a relatively small proportion of
Stanford students uses the counseling services
in these two institutions may be an index of
the community's relatively healthy mental
state. On the other hand, experience hÂ°re and
in other universities would seem to indicate
that there are many more problems than are
actually met by these services. Larger staffs
would doubtless encourage more students with
real problems to seek aid.
It has been rightly observed that while any
person lacks the medical or psychological
help he needs, the job of counseling is not be
ing properly done. One of our faculty col
leagues recently stated that "One student sui
cide per year is one too many," a sentiment
with which no one could quarrel. But preven
tion in the realm of counseling is the most
difficult task. For one thing, it requires the
willing cooperation of the patient or subject.
The continued excellence and improvement
of these two services seems to the Committee,
however, a matter of rather high priority. We
are in a period where the mental strains upon
the age group of Stanford students are great
and on the increase. It is no pampering mood
that leads to the conclusion that professional
aid is needed; it is rather the sense of urgency
that informs higher education, and the wish
that barriers to the best education every stu
dent is capable of absorbing be as far as possi
ble thrown down. We do not believe that the
improvement of, say, the Counseling and Test
ing Center is more important than the im
provement of the faculty. But believing in the
priority of the academic, we wish it to be aided
by the best medical and psychological services
Stanford can afford to render.
We have few specific recommendations,
apart from general improvementâ€”which In
itself ought not to be taken as underhanded
criticism. The first contact with the Counsel
ing and Testing Center ought to make clear
to entering students that genuine personal
counsel may be had there. We are dubious
that the orientation-week testing is a good in
troduction for students, valuable as the re
sults may be for staff research. The counsel
ing function should be made more distinct
from that of legitimate research.
The most difficult question with which the
Committee has long wrestled is how to be
sure that the people who need the help receive
it. To that question, we have no satisfactory
answer. The availability of the services should
b" widely publicized and accurately described.
Every member of the University should know
about them. But the person who refuses to
seek help when he needs it can not, by any
means the Committee has been able to discov
er, be forced to have it.
The Committee notes with satisfaction the
recent improvements in the situation of reli
gious ministries on the campus. Although not
every religious tradition is officially repre
sented, persons desiring counseling of a reli
gious sort have access to a broad range of
clergymen and denominational representatives.
Since campus office space was made available
to denominational representatives, the work
of the Pean of the Chapel and his assistant
and of the University Chaplain has been en
larged by cooperation. To those who doubt the
propriety of the presence of clergymen on a
university campus, the Committee would say
that the day when religious bodies looked on
the ministry to students as a salvage operation
from the godless university is long past. Safe
guards against irresponsibility in this as in
other areas of interest can be established ad
ministratively. Those members of the Univer
sity who find religious counsel helpful and nec
essary can and do seek it out.
By virtue of the fact that Selective Service
is of immediate concern to the majority of
Stanford students, the Committee has consid
ered advising facilities offered regarding the
draft. A National Service Adviser has for
some time been available. The Committee ap
plauds the addition of a counselor on con
scientious objection to the student facilities
available on campus. We anticipate that such
an office will be continued while the question
of the draft is pertinent, and suggest that the
amount of student need for such counsel re
quires the availability of more time than is
now provided. The different natures of the
counseling involved makes it advisable to keep
separate the conscientious objection counsel
ing and National Service advising. Greater co
ordination of the latter with the ROTC offices
and the Placement Service would facilitate the
answering of questions faced by many stu
dents in regard to the options available for
fulfillment of military service. However, the
effectiveness of both offices is hampered at
present by lack of information reaching the
student. Publicizing these services in the hand
book to the University proposed above, and by
whatever means are now available, and the
initiation of orientation sessions with tutors,
residence assistants, and directors may begin
to alleviate this inadequacy.
The Placement Service is kept until last be
cause the Committee believes substantial ex
pansion is possible and desirable. At present
the Placement Service is a means to bring
prospective employees into contact with pros
pective employers and to aid students to re
ceive part-time and summer jobs. With ex
pense (the Committee does not wish to guess
how much* and reorganization, the Placement
Service could become a Career Guidance Cen
ter. This change would put job interviews into
perspective as aspects of a more thorough in
vestigation by the individual of his wishes and
talents for a career. Facilities for aptitude
tests of various kinds would be needed, as well
as staff to process and counsel regarding such
tests. For this purpose, it would he well to
shift the efforts in career counseling now car
ried on by the Counseling and Testing Center
to an expanded Career Guidance Center. Infor

mation on opportunities and requisites for ca
reers of many kinds could conveniently be
gathered and sometimes produced by a Career
Guidance Center, and one might expect to find
in it the current catalogues of graduate and
professional schools across the country.
It has often been remarked that, for all the
Founders' desires that a Stanford education
should fit students for useful pursuits, the ac
cessibility of career counsel is rather slim
hÂ°re. In feeling that the situation bears im
provement the Committee does not imply that
every student should have made a clear voca
tional choice by the end of his senior year. But
students wishing to make informed and ra
tional choices of careers should have access as
early as possible to information and individual
ized counsel regarding the options. A Career
Guidance Center might have the contacts to
place students in part-time and temporary
jobs with persons in careers that the students
are considering, experience which might be
invaluable whether it be positive or negative.
Other methods of gaining insight into vari
ous kinds of professional life may likewise
gain momentum. A proposal now being con
sidered suggests the establishment of sopho
more and higher level courses on the profes
sions, taught from the perspectives of both
the humanities and the social sciences. Such
courses would be informational and descriptive
and in no sense recruitment techniques. Still
other means might be found to make available
for students bases for wise career decisions.
The present admirable advising done by facul
ty members of the School of Medicine with
and for pre-medical students could profitably
be emulated elsewhere. Could not the Schools
of Law, Business, and Education, for example,
provide similar counsel in cooperation with a
Career Guidance Center? The Committee pre
sumes that remuneration occupations will for
some time be necessary for most members of
American society. There is point, therefore, to
the thought that education can be useful, even
though that is far from being the whole point
of education.
111. Academic
Advising
If personal counseling is very largely done
casually and by amateurs, so is academic ad
vising. Most of the advising done at Stanford
is done by one undergraduate to another. The
Committee heartily approves this state of af
fairs at the same time that it is not satisfied
to abandon faculty advising.
Student Advising. Several aspects of under
graduate advising are carried by undergradu
ates. Students get their best information about
the value of specific courses from other stu
dents who have taken them. This is only natu
ral. Faculty members are loath to comment
on their colleagues, for reasons of professional
propriety; students are not. Moreover, faculty
members can talk about courses taught by
their colleagues only by hearsay, where stu
dents can speak at first hand. Such informal
advising is valuable, even though it is fre
quently biased. Sporadic attempts have been
made to bring it usefully into published form,
with such documents as the Course Review,
succeeding the earlier "Scratch Sheet." The
Committee applauds the concept of a student
Course Review as a valuable asset to advising,
and wishes that it might be thorough in its
coverage of courses, representative of a varie
ty of student reactions, and sensitive to stated
aims of professors in courses. Such a review
would also inform professors helpfully about
responses to the courses. The Course Review
ought to appear regularly, with cooperation
and financial assistance from the University
but without administrative control.
A recent experiment in appointing students
as advisers-at-large in their major departments
produced uncertain results. The fault may lie
partially in a lack of information about the
program, in student suspicion that student
advisers would be "administration types," in
students' feelings that they could get as good
advice from their friendsâ€”or in any possible
combination of those and other factors. The
Committee is not satisfied that student de
partmental advising is a bad idea, especially
on the basis of one year's experiment in three
departments. It exhorts departments and
schools to keep trying to find ways of taking
advantage of students' advising abilities.
The function of the adviser. We have already
expressed the Committee's suggestion that ad
vising not be simply a matter of policing, of
making sure that the student has information
and is taking the courses he is required to
take. The Adviser's Handbook describes the
goal of advising as bringing "the student to
the point where he can assume a maximum
amount of responsibility for his own academic
program and can make wise decisions on his
own" (p. 12). The Committee wishes to go be
yond that to propose that the adviser be
viewed both by the student and by himself as
the student's academic advocate, the particular
educator who agrees to concern himself with
his advisee's best education. This means prin
cipally that the adviser wishes to help the
student plan an educational career that goes
somewhere, that has coherence and point to it,
rather than being a miscellaneous collection
of requirements and aimless electives. If the
adviser is the student's advocate, however, this
coherence must be a means of enabling the
student's wishes and strengths to be embodied
in his program, not a way for the adviser to
impose his own concepts on the student.
Such a concept would, to he sure, produce
advising that takes more time, for carefully
considering with a student his academic ob
jectives and intellectual curiosities consumes
more time that simply signing his card. But if
such advising is understood and underscored
by tin 1 faculty as integral 1o education, faculty
members may more happily engage in it. It

poses several problems, among which is the
acceptance of advising as a normal aspect of
academic appointment at Stanford. If such
advising will not be done by the faculty, some
one must do it. In the absence of good faculty
advising, a corps of professional advisers
would probably have to be retained to the dam
age of the budget and of the academic exper
tise with which advising ought to be done. On
all counts, the Committee emphatically prefers
faculty advising.
The student's stake in advising. A curious
duality is sometimes to be observed among
students. On the one hand, they firmly ob
ject to be treated as ciphers or as children by
an institution standing in loco parentis. On
the other .they wish the advice of their elders
among the faculty, and this wish is sometimes
Indistinguishable from a desire for a parent
surrogate. Occasionally, when the advice given
is not to an individual's liking, he will pro
test that he is not being respected. We point
this out in part to say that the students' own
view of their stake in advising is not crystal
clear.
Although the student knows more about
himself than any adviser is ever likely to
know, he needs advising because he has not
enough experience of education to know pre
cisely how to join his interests and talents
to a curricular regimen. This observation ap
plies equally, though in different perspectives,
to undergraduates and graduate students. The
student looks to an adviser for guidance in
pursuing an education that will take ad
vantage of his interests and lead him beyond
his own provincial boundaries, at the same
time that it is certifiable by the University as
meeting its standards. The University, of
course, must determine what those standards
are, since it is the body doing the certifying.
The adviser stands toward the student in the
peculiar position of being at once a represen
tative of the University's power of sanction
upon the student (he makes judgments on stu
dents' performance) and and the advocate of
that particula student in the acquisition of his
most effective education.
If the structure of degree requirements on
the graduate level becomes less prescriptive,
the premium on interested advising which
aids the student toward coherence as well as
adventuresomeness will rise. Experience will
count for much in a student's planning, al
though it should not be prescriptively applied.
What is at stake for the student in a more flex
ible under-graduate program is precisely the
humanity of an adviser who is genuinely the
student's educational advocate. If the program
is flexible, advocacy need not consist in find
ing ways to circumvent regulations.
The levels of advising and their problems.
Special and different problems of advising ob
tain for freshmen, transfers, upperclass un
dergraduates and departmental majors, and
graduate students. At the same time, the Com
mittee is convinced of one true observation:
the best advising takes place where advisee
and adviser have some kind of common bond,
beyond the routine. This may be the bond of
the same field of study (the normal pre-set
bond between graduate students and faculty),
some common experience (frequently that the
student has taken the faculty member's
course), or prior acquaintance.
From this standpoint, the advising of fresh
men is the most difficult task, for freshmen
rarely have any existing bond to a faculty
member. It must be established. The Commit
tee has been divided upon several possible ways
to handle freshman advising. That the faculty
should carry the bulk of the advising seems
wise, yet a student's assigned adviser only
rarely turns out to be important or helpful
to him. As the freshman year curriculum now
stands, freshmen rarely come into close con
tact with faculty members, except those al
-most as transient as themselves: English
TA's, Western Civ instructors, lab TA's, and
beginning math and language TA's. The In
crease of Freshman seminars may improve
the range of faculty contact. The plans of
assigning advisers to groups in living units
has been extremely spotty in its effectiveness,
and it suffers from the fact that the advisers
remain abstractly faculty members, rather
than being perceived in their active teaching
roles. Relationships of freshman to faculty
residents or directors of living units, to tutors,
and to sponsors are relatively close, and these
persons in fact do the bulk of freshman ad
vising. The Trancos experiment is one possible
model of freshman advising, where residence
director, sponsors and tutors, and a team of
faculty advisers work closely together. Fresh
man advising ought to aid in the orientation
of the entering student, j.etting him off on the
right foot, proposing seriously that he identify
areas of genuine intellectual interest. Such
advising should prepare the student to find
a permanent academic adviser as he goes.
The Committee is unanimous in suggesting
that advising will become more effective from
all sides if the student ultimately chooses his
own adviser. In fact this frequently happens
now, except that the adviser whom the stu
dent chooses is often not the one responsible
for signing his card. We see the following
arguments in favor of this idea: 1. The stu
dent will most likely choose a faculty mem
ber whom he has seen in action, knows some
thing of his qualities and the "cut of his jib."
2. Such a relationship would underscore the
obligation of both student and adviser for
tion in which the student is interested and
tion In which the student is interested an
which makes coherent academic sense of his
interests and career plans. (The Committee
believes, parenthetically, that changing ad
visers and programs ought to be quite easy,
with no prejudice attached to it.) 3. If the
structure of the freshman year becomes less
prescribed, freshmen will have access to a
broader range of course options and of faculty
members than is now the case and will be
more likely to identify someone with whom
they believe they can work.
Certain problems with this arrangement can
be foreseen. 1. Some very popular professors
will be swamped with advisees, and other fac
ulty members will have few or none. To this
the Committee would propose that limitations
on the number of advisees per faculty member
be administratively established (see below.) 2.
Understaffed departments will have too many
majors to observe the limitations, and will have
to continue assigning majors to advisers. To
this the Committee proposes that the student's
adviser need not, though he may, be in the stu
dent's own major department. If the adviser is
not charged to keep track of regulations, it is
not at all unlikely that a professor in one de
partment can help a student in another to pur
sue a course that both meets the standards laid
down by the department and satisfies the stu
dent's own academic needs and wants. Depart
ments might require countersignature of study
cards by departmental representatives. Any
student seriously wishing to become a his
torian, for example, will probably try to find
a historian as adviser in order to get help in
preparing to be like him. We recognize that
in some programs, e.g. Philosophy and the
Honors Program in Humanities, the adviser
docs considerable tutoring of the student in
his senior year. This does not seem to us in
compatible with the basic premise. We are in
clined, on the undergraduate level, to resist
departmental "imperialism," which demands
control over "its" students. An undergraduate
major need not, after all, be occupational prep
aration, but, especially in the Humanities and
Social Sciences, is rather a point of co
herence for one's entire liberal education. Stu
dents who wish strong identification with a
discipline or department may gain it by choos
ing advisers there. Students who do not want
such a concentration may be well served by
advisers from almost anywhere in the Uni
versity.
Such a plan would introduce a differentia
tion between freshman and upperclass advis
ing, in place of the present differentiation be
tween General Studies and major advising.
The Committee is inclined to believe that the
former differentiation would make all advis
ing more effective with regard to general ed
ucation. We are not yet agreed as to the time
when a student must have chosen his adviser.
Some might stay with the person to whom they
were assigned as freshmen; others would find
an adviser during the freshman year; still
others during the sophomore year. Some stu
dents might have three or four different ad
visers during their careers. We see no compel
ing reason why that should be forbidden,
though frequent changes may be a signal that
counseling of some kind is needed. As at pres
ent, students will continue to seek out advice
from faculty members whom they like and
trust, no matter who is the officially designated
adviser. The present suggestion is intended to
take advantage of that fact of life.
The advising of graduate students might
seem to be self-evident. No one except grad
uate students themselves seems to feel it a
problem. Some responsibilities which many

departments seem not to handle well with
graduate students are the following: (1) intro
ducing new students to the University; (2) in
forming students about and channeling them,
when need is present, to the Counseling and
Testing Center, Cowell Halth Service, the
Placement Service, etc.; (3) giving students
vocational advice and sometimes placing them;
(4) informing new students about housing pos
sibilities and problems; (5) informing students
about useful training obtainable on a reg
ular basis in other departments. The pro
blem here is different from that of under
graduates in that the graduate student is
earnestly in the process of professional prep
aration. There is a certain emulative aspect to
graduate study, therefore, because many grad
uate students (certainly not nearly 100%) are
working with people with whom they expect
ultimately to become colleagues. It seems to
us probable that at present graduate students
select their own advisers to an extent that un
dergraduate do not. The function of faculty in
attracting graduate students to any university
assures that the potential of full relationships
is present. A stronger administrative surveil
lance of graduate advising might help to over
come the deficiences of individual departments.
Some special problems. Three groups of stu
dents present special problems to which the
Committee does not yet have answers. It is
clear that transfer students could use far bet
ter help on arrival than most of them get. It is
also clear that their problems are different
from those faced by freshman. We believe that
transfer students should bo given high priority
for on-campus housing. It also seems to us
that the evaluation of transfer credits could
be expedited and improved in many ways.
Some faculty members might be especially en
couraged to handle transfer students. We de
sire further suggestions about the advising of
transfer students from anyone with ideas to
give.
Another group of students with problems to
which the Committee has not yet given
sufficient attention is foreign students. The
Beehtel International Center is a source of
remarkably fine personal attention to foreign
students. But this group has academic prob
lems peculiarly their own, and some made of
advising needs, we think, to be tailored to
them. Again, the Committee wishes to be
helped by ideas.
The third group is comprised of members
of minorities with special disadvantages. Ad
vising needs to have cognizance both of the
personal problems faced by such students and
of academic needs. Efforts to provide tutoring
from the Office of Financial Aids have been
sporadic, due largely to stringently limited
funds. Some more formal program of tutoring
and counsel would greatly increase the accessi
bility of an adequate Stanford education for
such students. Stanford has publicly stated its
intention to do the right thing by these per
sons. Additional support, morally and mone
tarily, needs to be provided.
The extent and rewards of advising. The
Committee believes that advising on all levels
should be taken together in figuring the aver
age ratio of advisees to advisers. Taking fig
ures in the fall Student Directory as sub

stantially correct for numbers of majors and
graduate students in the Schools and Depart
ments, and taking a count of faculty at As
sistant Professor or higher in Courses and De
grees as substantially correct (realizing that
many people in the latter are absent on leave),
and assuming that all of those faculty advise
majors and graduate students, we find the fol
lowing ratios by schools of major and grad
uate advisees to advisers:
Earth Sciences 5.8 (169/29)
Engineering 13.4 (2114A58)
Humanities & Sciences 11.7 (4739/405)
The figures for present General Studies ad
vising, however, look rather different. 115
persons are engaged in 1967-68 in General
Studies advising of 2330 students without de
clared majors, a ratio of 20.2G advisees to each
adviser. Sources of General Studies advisers
are as follows:
Earth Sciences 7 (24% of
school faculty)
Engineering 11 (6.9% of
school faculty)
Humanities & Sciences 45 (11.1% of
school faculty)
Medicine 12
Military Science 2
Physical Education 3
Education 2
Administration 33
The figures show the difficulties encountered
by the Registrar in his task of recruiting
General Studies Advisers. Only 63 ( 54.8%) of
present General Studies advisers come from
the faculties of Schools which will enroll the
advisees as majors. Moreover, only 39% of
General Studies advisers come from the School
of Humanities and Sciences, which can rea
sonably expect to enroll about 80% of un
dergraduates.
At the same time, figures received from De
partments of the School of Humanities and
Sciences show a very wide variation in the
actual advising practice of departments. Some
departments average as few as 4 departmental
advisees per adviser, whereas members of
others may have as many as 66 major ad
visees. Such a figure seems to the Committee
a mockery of the very idea of advising.
One can be only routine with that many ad
visees. The Committee is inclined to believe
that an upper limit on the number of allowable
advisees per adviser should be set, perhaps at
25 or 30, such a figure to include both grad
uate and undergraduate students. The Com
mittee also believes that Deans should ask
executive hads of departments quite search
ing questions about provisions for carrying
advising when many members of a depart
ment propose to be on leave for a given year.
One instance has been reported in which a
member of a large department finds himself
during this academic year with 89 advisees
(graduate, undergraduate major, and Gen
eral Studies) because so many of his col
league are absent on leave. If a limit on ad
visees were set and adhered to, such ex
ploitation would not be permitted.
The Committee has thought very hard about
the place of advising in Stanford's status and
reward system for its faculty. At present, save

for one department that claims to adjust Its
teaching loads in proportion to advising loads,
advising is in fact extra-curricular, in that
it is supposed to be done but no one pays
much attention if it is not done. The Commit
tee is informed that advisers receive extra
pay in some universities, and it has discussed
whether bonus pay would be an incentive to
better advising. We are not satisfied that it
would. We have also asked how a faculty
member's advising effectiveness might be a
factor in his promotion and salary increment.
Nothing would please the Committee more
than to be shown a method of accurate evalua
tion of this effectiveness, so that it could be
used as one among other determinants. We
have yet to find a method. Even if the stu
dent were to choose his adviser, one could not
determine the adviser's effectiveness merely
by counting the number of his advisees.
The Committee believes that advising will
be able to play a role in the status and re
ward system only if the faculty becomes so
committed to the advising function (which,
for the Committee, is integral to the educa
tional function) that the very commitment
produces a means of reward. The faculty
must decide that advising is important, and
the faculty at large must expend some energy
in advising. Pressure probably ought to be
exerted on those of our colleagues who would
rather not advise students, although the very
reluctant adviser will likely not be a very
good one. Perhaps, in considerations of reward
and promotion, nothing more than a negative
question can be asked. If a brilliant research
er does no advising, can his research contribu
tions outweigh the absence of his contribu
tion to the University's humanity? In some in
stances, the answer might have to be "No."
So far as the Committee knows, the question
has never been asked.
Advising in the professor's profession. The
Committee has expressed its conviction that
advising students is properly a part of the
educational profession, that such an as
sumption ought if possible to be an element
in consideration of reward. We suggest, more
over, that prospective faculty appointees be
informed of advising obligations of Stanford
faculty members. We would also suggest a
more long-range way of achieving the actuality
of this assumption. It has often been pointed
out that among the weakest aspects of grad
uate education today is the failure to prepare
people for their profession. Graduate students
are trained to do research, but many of them
are hired to be teachers and members of fac
ulties. We do not wish to underplay research.
But too little is done to train those of our grad
uate students who will become teachers for
their actual professional functions. The Com
mittee suggests the advisability of instruc
tion for graduate students in the scope of the
objectives and responsibilities of their chosen
profession, which will help them comprehend
the expectations under which they will work.
Such instruction could go a long way toward
making actual the ideal that professors are
engaged in education, an activity that includes
research and publication, classroom teach
ing, and the education of individual students
outside of formal instruction that advising
ought to be. When education in that sense be
comes the basic assumption of the University's

life, we will be on the way toward the fulfill
ment of our humanity.

Epilogue:
Enablement and
Surveillance
It is hoped that in such a relatively casual
and self selecting system as that proposed
above, the quiet and unspectacular job that
needs to be done will proceed. But responsibili
ty for watching it must be lodged somewhere
more specific than in the hearts and minds of
the 20,000-odd souls of the Stanford commun
ity. There needs to be improved liaison among
agencies, assurance that stated functions are
being fulfilled, exhortation if not pressure
for participation in both given and receiving.
It was suggested, half jocularly, in the Com
mittee that what is wanted is a "University
humane ofTice.'The term is simplistic, but the
thought is precise. To indicate, to itself and
everyone else, that Stanford means its hu
manity, the responsibility should be assumed
by a highly placed officer, of at least Associate
Provost rank, whose responsibilities would in
clude the coordination of advising and coun
seling structures.
The Committee remains uncertain whether
the responsibility should be added to those
carried by the Dean of Students, whether it
should be assigned to a Dean of Undergraduate
Educationâ€”should such a position be rein
statedâ€”or whether a new position should be
created. In favor of the first is the fact that
the Dean of Students is now responsible for
several agencies in which counseling and ad
vising take place. On the other hand, the ed
ucational thrust of the entire program might
suggest that the responsibility be held by a
distinctly academic officer such as a Dean of
Undergraduate Education. At the same time,
the fact that advising and counseling must af
fect graduate as well as undergraduate stu
dents makes desirable that the officer not be
exclusively occupied with undergraduates.
Whoever such a person might be, and what
ever his title, he must be accessible to and
trustable by students, command the respect
and attract the cooperation of the faculty, and
display remarkable virtues to non-academic
staff persons.

This paper is presented to the University
community by the Committee on Advising and
Couast'lint; of the Study of Education at Stan
ford. It is important to say tliat the paper is
intended not as a recommendation for immedi
ate decision hut as some proposals for discus
sion.
Hearings will take place 7 9 p.m. Tuesday
and 4-fi p.m. Wednesday in room 143 of Meyer
Library. Members of the committee will be
present to receive comments on the paper. The
Committee also welcomes written responses to
the SES office, Meyer Library.
Few subjects are so frequently the target of
criticism as advising, few so rarely the object
of constructive suggestion. Widespread agree
ment thai advising is not very well done at
Stanford is equalled by imprecision as to the
problem and feasible solutions. Our realism
breeds cynicism, concluding that we must ac
cept inadequacy.
The Committee on Advising and Counseling
of the Study of Education at Stanford has at
tempted to be realistic but not cynical. Mow
ever unlikely the radical alteration of human
nature may be, the alteration of perspectives
and priorities is well within our reach. The
Committee urges the University's members,
however, that unless assumptions are modi
fied the cynics will he proven right. Foremost
among the assumptions that require adjust
ment is the tacit one that for a faculty mem
ber advising is an extracurricular activity.
This assumption produces hesitance on the
part of many students to consult advisers ex
cept for routine card-signing for fear of "tak
ing up his time," and their resultant complaint
that advising at Stanford is nothing but rou
tine. It produces the perception on the part of
faculty members that advising, except for one's
"own" special (preferably graduate) students,
is a chore to be avoided if possible and to be
disposed of quickly if avoidance is not possible.
It produces among administrators complete ig
norance of inequities in advising loads and the
ignoring of the function of advising in con
siderations of appointment, promotion, and re
ward.
The Committee is not so blindered as to sup
pose that advising is the most important as
pect of university life. But it is sensitive to
the penetration of aspects of advising into al
most everything Stanford does, from admis
sions to residence policy to undergraduate and
graduate curriculum to student services to the
extra-curriculum to placement and vocational
decisions. In what follows we have made some
assumption that bear explication. First, we
suppose that advising has basically to do with
the possibility of significant relations and com
munication between persons, that it sums up
what we intend by our sub-title: "the humani
ty of the University." Second, we assume that
the educational direction Stanford is taking
will entail more advising, not less, on both
graduate and undergraduate levels, and a high
er degree of humanity, not a lower. Third, we
assume that, since no system is perfect, an ar
rangement of advising that allows several
quite different forms and structures of advis
ing to take place will come closer to self-re
newal than a single, potentially rigid system.
The problem, as we presently see it, has
three points of focus: 1. the dissemination to
everyone who needs it of accurate and com
plete information; 2. the availability to anyone
who needs it of competent professional coun
seling; 3. the accessibility to all students of
Interested and personal academic advice.
I. Dissemination
of Information
The story about the man who did not have
enough information to take instruction is rele
vant to the problem of advising. The Commit
tee believes that adequate and accurate infor
mation on most matters regarding the Univer
sity is readily available to those who wish and
need to have it. Ignorance and misinformation
are widespread, however, some of it difficult
to understand.
The information that needs dissemination is
that which makes possible (1) awareness on
the part of faculty and students alike of exact
ly what the University's communal and aca
demic facilities are; (2) access by members of
the University to the various services provid
ed; (3) informed decisions about academic
matters on the part of students.
A great deal of this information can be and
is conveyed in print, but people forget things
when they read them in almost unnumerable
bulletins, pamphlets, brochures, hand-bills, mi
meographed or dittoed sheets, and the like.
The variety is compounded by the fact that
certain published materials are factual in na
ture and others are more propagandists in
tone and purpose, by the fact that some infor
mation is obsolete before it is ever printed and
some is incomplete.
The Committee suggests basic simplification
into two yearly publications. One is an expand
ed version of the present rather slim Informa
tion Bulletin, to serve as a more general hand
book to the University. Here should be de
tailed information on matters not covered in
Courses and Degrees: fees and expenses, resi
dences, relatively permanent organizations and
activities both student and University-wide,
services available to the community such as
those of the Health Service, the Counseling
and Testing Center, the Bechtel International
Center, and others. Also in such a handbook
might be found brief descriptions of the ad
ministrative operation of the University, the
duties and powers of its various officers, and
policies affecting various of its members.
Through such a publication, which should be
routinely in the hands of everyone, both stu
dents and faculty could find how to get help
for all kinds of problems. New students and
new faculty members in particular would, with

its aid, more easily find their ways in the Uni
versity.
Parenthetically, the Committee also sees a
need for a faculty handbook, which would in
form faculty members of such policies of ap
pointment, promotion, tenure, and administra
tive arrangement as are especially relevant to
them.
The Committee wishes, moreover, that Cour
ses and I)egre<>s might he improved. The in
formation in it is frequently obsolete before
the book comes off the press. Might there not
be in the den of someone at Stanford printing
methods that could reduce the lag between
copy deadlines and publication? Would the
improvement of accuracy allowed by an Aug
ust publication date outweigh the advantage
for incoming students of the present May pub
lication? Students and advisers alike now hesi
tate to use Courses and Degrees as a basis
for planning the work of even a single year in
advance. The Committee wonders, then, wheth
er usefulness for planning to those already
here should not have priority over usefulness
for those about to come. In the light of the in
creasing need for advanced academic planning
by students, greater accuracy becomes even
more desirable. Moreover, if Courses and De
grees wore improved and up-dated, the expense
of the quarterly Time Schedule might be re
duced by making it no more than a supple
ment to Courses and Degrees.
All of these publications would bo of im
mense help to advisers and their advisees. The
Committee is of the opinion that the adviser's
function should not be to disseminate informa
tion that the student can more readily receive
otherwise. In saying that, we take full cog
nizance of the high likelihood that anything in
print will be misunderstood, misconstrued, or
misused somewhere by someone. Where the
adviser perceives ignorance, he must, of
course, rectify itâ€”and the student may do the
same. The adviser will function well with an
advisee when both have the necessary infor
mation, for then the adviser is free to advise
instead of merely to inform.
Concomitantly, the Committee believes that
the adviser should be relieved of policing cur
ricular regulations. So much of academic ad
vising is taken up with routine questions about
the fulfillment of requirements (How many
units of Science have you left to take? How
much math? etc.) that time for genuine and
personalized advice is too often at a premium.
The Committee has a hunch, moreover, (1)
that on the whole students know the require
ments in General Studies and in major pro
grams better than their advisers do, and (2)
that students almost always know exactly
where they stand with regard to those require
ments. The Committee wonders about the feas
ibility of computerizing information of these
kinds to enable easy retrieval. If machines can
free us for the improvement of our humanity,
we should by all means use them.
In short, the Committee believes that advis
ing could be far better focussed on advice if
the dissemination of information were both
simplified and improved, so that the adviser
does not have to be a traffic cop of regulations.
11. Availability
of Counseling
For clarity of terminology, we use the term
"counseling" to mean the impartation of help
for problems of a personal sort, not immediate
ly involving the academic, while "advising" is
restricted in this paper to academic advice.
It is certainly the case that a great deal of
counseling in this sense occurs in any commu
nity as large and as complex as Stanford. Most
of it is casual, among close friends, and with
no pretense of professional expertise. This
sort of counseling will happen whether the
institution encourages or discourages it. Any
attempt to structure such relationships is, of
course, doomed to failure. Faculty members
also do a great deal of counseling of this kind.
Though some may criticize the non-profession
al nature of such counseling, that may in itself
bo one of the'strengths of the relationship. At
the same time, situations frequently arise
where professional counseling is needed and
any casual counselor should always have in
mind the possibility of referring someone to
sources of professional aid. The Committee has
not conceived of any way by which faculty or
other such occasional counselors might cus
tomarily be taught how to recognize danger
signals, but they should be aware of an obli
gation to suggest referral.
Nevertheless, sources of professional coun
seling are present at Stanford, and the Com
mittee has been surprise that some members
of the University, both faculty and students,
seem unaware of them. Apart from the coun
seling done in residences < faculty residents,
residence directors, resident assistants, tutors,
and sponsors), which would have to be called
at best semi-professional, counseling done by
campus religious representatives, and that
done in special circumstances by persons in
the Dean of Students' office, the University
maintains two major sources of professional
counseling and a third that might become one.
We refer in the first instance to the Counsel
ing and Testing Center and to the psychiatric
services of the Cowell Health Center, and in
the second instance to the Placement Service.
The Counseling and Testing Center provides
psychological testing of many kinds and both
short-range and long-range psychological coun
seling. The psychiatric staff of the Cowell
Health Center is available for psychiatric con
sultation and some forms of therapy, and pa
tients in need of long-range therapy are re
ferred to psychiatrists in the School of Medi
cine for it.
The Committee has no wish to enter into the
relative merits of these two approaches, be
lieving that both meet various kinds of situ
ations helpfully. The liaison between the Conn

soling and Testing Center and the Cowell
Health reportedly good and getting
better. Such liaison and cooperation should be
encouraged by the University administration.
The fact that a relatively small proportion of
Stanford students uses the counseling services
in these two institutions may be an index of
the community's relatively healthy mental
state. On the other hand, experience hÂ°re and
in other universities would seem to indicate
that there are many more problems than are
actually met by these services. Larger staffs
would doubtless encourage more students with
real problems to seek aid.
It has been rightly observed that while any
person lacks the medical or psychological
help he needs, the job of counseling is not be
ing properly done. One of our faculty col
leagues recently stated that "One student sui
cide per year is one too many," a sentiment
with which no one could quarrel. But preven
tion in the realm of counseling is the most
difficult task. For one thing, it requires the
willing cooperation of the patient or subject.
The continued excellence and improvement
of these two services seems to the Committee,
however, a matter of rather high priority. We
are in a period where the mental strains upon
the age group of Stanford students are great
and on the increase. It is no pampering mood
that leads to the conclusion that professional
aid is needed; it is rather the sense of urgency
that informs higher education, and the wish
that barriers to the best education every stu
dent is capable of absorbing be as far as possi
ble thrown down. We do not believe that the
improvement of, say, the Counseling and Test
ing Center is more important than the im
provement of the faculty. But believing in the
priority of the academic, we wish it to be aided
by the best medical and psychological services
Stanford can afford to render.
We have few specific recommendations,
apart from general improvementâ€”which In
itself ought not to be taken as underhanded
criticism. The first contact with the Counsel
ing and Testing Center ought to make clear
to entering students that genuine personal
counsel may be had there. We are dubious
that the orientation-week testing is a good in
troduction for students, valuable as the re
sults may be for staff research. The counsel
ing function should be made more distinct
from that of legitimate research.
The most difficult question with which the
Committee has long wrestled is how to be
sure that the people who need the help receive
it. To that question, we have no satisfactory
answer. The availability of the services should
b" widely publicized and accurately described.
Every member of the University should know
about them. But the person who refuses to
seek help when he needs it can not, by any
means the Committee has been able to discov
er, be forced to have it.
The Committee notes with satisfaction the
recent improvements in the situation of reli
gious ministries on the campus. Although not
every religious tradition is officially repre
sented, persons desiring counseling of a reli
gious sort have access to a broad range of
clergymen and denominational representatives.
Since campus office space was made available
to denominational representatives, the work
of the Pean of the Chapel and his assistant
and of the University Chaplain has been en
larged by cooperation. To those who doubt the
propriety of the presence of clergymen on a
university campus, the Committee would say
that the day when religious bodies looked on
the ministry to students as a salvage operation
from the godless university is long past. Safe
guards against irresponsibility in this as in
other areas of interest can be established ad
ministratively. Those members of the Univer
sity who find religious counsel helpful and nec
essary can and do seek it out.
By virtue of the fact that Selective Service
is of immediate concern to the majority of
Stanford students, the Committee has consid
ered advising facilities offered regarding the
draft. A National Service Adviser has for
some time been available. The Committee ap
plauds the addition of a counselor on con
scientious objection to the student facilities
available on campus. We anticipate that such
an office will be continued while the question
of the draft is pertinent, and suggest that the
amount of student need for such counsel re
quires the availability of more time than is
now provided. The different natures of the
counseling involved makes it advisable to keep
separate the conscientious objection counsel
ing and National Service advising. Greater co
ordination of the latter with the ROTC offices
and the Placement Service would facilitate the
answering of questions faced by many stu
dents in regard to the options available for
fulfillment of military service. However, the
effectiveness of both offices is hampered at
present by lack of information reaching the
student. Publicizing these services in the hand
book to the University proposed above, and by
whatever means are now available, and the
initiation of orientation sessions with tutors,
residence assistants, and directors may begin
to alleviate this inadequacy.
The Placement Service is kept until last be
cause the Committee believes substantial ex
pansion is possible and desirable. At present
the Placement Service is a means to bring
prospective employees into contact with pros
pective employers and to aid students to re
ceive part-time and summer jobs. With ex
pense (the Committee does not wish to guess
how much* and reorganization, the Placement
Service could become a Career Guidance Cen
ter. This change would put job interviews into
perspective as aspects of a more thorough in
vestigation by the individual of his wishes and
talents for a career. Facilities for aptitude
tests of various kinds would be needed, as well
as staff to process and counsel regarding such
tests. For this purpose, it would he well to
shift the efforts in career counseling now car
ried on by the Counseling and Testing Center
to an expanded Career Guidance Center. Infor

mation on opportunities and requisites for ca
reers of many kinds could conveniently be
gathered and sometimes produced by a Career
Guidance Center, and one might expect to find
in it the current catalogues of graduate and
professional schools across the country.
It has often been remarked that, for all the
Founders' desires that a Stanford education
should fit students for useful pursuits, the ac
cessibility of career counsel is rather slim
hÂ°re. In feeling that the situation bears im
provement the Committee does not imply that
every student should have made a clear voca
tional choice by the end of his senior year. But
students wishing to make informed and ra
tional choices of careers should have access as
early as possible to information and individual
ized counsel regarding the options. A Career
Guidance Center might have the contacts to
place students in part-time and temporary
jobs with persons in careers that the students
are considering, experience which might be
invaluable whether it be positive or negative.
Other methods of gaining insight into vari
ous kinds of professional life may likewise
gain momentum. A proposal now being con
sidered suggests the establishment of sopho
more and higher level courses on the profes
sions, taught from the perspectives of both
the humanities and the social sciences. Such
courses would be informational and descriptive
and in no sense recruitment techniques. Still
other means might be found to make available
for students bases for wise career decisions.
The present admirable advising done by facul
ty members of the School of Medicine with
and for pre-medical students could profitably
be emulated elsewhere. Could not the Schools
of Law, Business, and Education, for example,
provide similar counsel in cooperation with a
Career Guidance Center? The Committee pre
sumes that remuneration occupations will for
some time be necessary for most members of
American society. There is point, therefore, to
the thought that education can be useful, even
though that is far from being the whole point
of education.
111. Academic
Advising
If personal counseling is very largely done
casually and by amateurs, so is academic ad
vising. Most of the advising done at Stanford
is done by one undergraduate to another. The
Committee heartily approves this state of af
fairs at the same time that it is not satisfied
to abandon faculty advising.
Student Advising. Several aspects of under
graduate advising are carried by undergradu
ates. Students get their best information about
the value of specific courses from other stu
dents who have taken them. This is only natu
ral. Faculty members are loath to comment
on their colleagues, for reasons of professional
propriety; students are not. Moreover, faculty
members can talk about courses taught by
their colleagues only by hearsay, where stu
dents can speak at first hand. Such informal
advising is valuable, even though it is fre
quently biased. Sporadic attempts have been
made to bring it usefully into published form,
with such documents as the Course Review,
succeeding the earlier "Scratch Sheet." The
Committee applauds the concept of a student
Course Review as a valuable asset to advising,
and wishes that it might be thorough in its
coverage of courses, representative of a varie
ty of student reactions, and sensitive to stated
aims of professors in courses. Such a review
would also inform professors helpfully about
responses to the courses. The Course Review
ought to appear regularly, with cooperation
and financial assistance from the University
but without administrative control.
A recent experiment in appointing students
as advisers-at-large in their major departments
produced uncertain results. The fault may lie
partially in a lack of information about the
program, in student suspicion that student
advisers would be "administration types," in
students' feelings that they could get as good
advice from their friendsâ€”or in any possible
combination of those and other factors. The
Committee is not satisfied that student de
partmental advising is a bad idea, especially
on the basis of one year's experiment in three
departments. It exhorts departments and
schools to keep trying to find ways of taking
advantage of students' advising abilities.
The function of the adviser. We have already
expressed the Committee's suggestion that ad
vising not be simply a matter of policing, of
making sure that the student has information
and is taking the courses he is required to
take. The Adviser's Handbook describes the
goal of advising as bringing "the student to
the point where he can assume a maximum
amount of responsibility for his own academic
program and can make wise decisions on his
own" (p. 12). The Committee wishes to go be
yond that to propose that the adviser be
viewed both by the student and by himself as
the student's academic advocate, the particular
educator who agrees to concern himself with
his advisee's best education. This means prin
cipally that the adviser wishes to help the
student plan an educational career that goes
somewhere, that has coherence and point to it,
rather than being a miscellaneous collection
of requirements and aimless electives. If the
adviser is the student's advocate, however, this
coherence must be a means of enabling the
student's wishes and strengths to be embodied
in his program, not a way for the adviser to
impose his own concepts on the student.
Such a concept would, to he sure, produce
advising that takes more time, for carefully
considering with a student his academic ob
jectives and intellectual curiosities consumes
more time that simply signing his card. But if
such advising is understood and underscored
by tin 1 faculty as integral 1o education, faculty
members may more happily engage in it. It

poses several problems, among which is the
acceptance of advising as a normal aspect of
academic appointment at Stanford. If such
advising will not be done by the faculty, some
one must do it. In the absence of good faculty
advising, a corps of professional advisers
would probably have to be retained to the dam
age of the budget and of the academic exper
tise with which advising ought to be done. On
all counts, the Committee emphatically prefers
faculty advising.
The student's stake in advising. A curious
duality is sometimes to be observed among
students. On the one hand, they firmly ob
ject to be treated as ciphers or as children by
an institution standing in loco parentis. On
the other .they wish the advice of their elders
among the faculty, and this wish is sometimes
Indistinguishable from a desire for a parent
surrogate. Occasionally, when the advice given
is not to an individual's liking, he will pro
test that he is not being respected. We point
this out in part to say that the students' own
view of their stake in advising is not crystal
clear.
Although the student knows more about
himself than any adviser is ever likely to
know, he needs advising because he has not
enough experience of education to know pre
cisely how to join his interests and talents
to a curricular regimen. This observation ap
plies equally, though in different perspectives,
to undergraduates and graduate students. The
student looks to an adviser for guidance in
pursuing an education that will take ad
vantage of his interests and lead him beyond
his own provincial boundaries, at the same
time that it is certifiable by the University as
meeting its standards. The University, of
course, must determine what those standards
are, since it is the body doing the certifying.
The adviser stands toward the student in the
peculiar position of being at once a represen
tative of the University's power of sanction
upon the student (he makes judgments on stu
dents' performance) and and the advocate of
that particula student in the acquisition of his
most effective education.
If the structure of degree requirements on
the graduate level becomes less prescriptive,
the premium on interested advising which
aids the student toward coherence as well as
adventuresomeness will rise. Experience will
count for much in a student's planning, al
though it should not be prescriptively applied.
What is at stake for the student in a more flex
ible under-graduate program is precisely the
humanity of an adviser who is genuinely the
student's educational advocate. If the program
is flexible, advocacy need not consist in find
ing ways to circumvent regulations.
The levels of advising and their problems.
Special and different problems of advising ob
tain for freshmen, transfers, upperclass un
dergraduates and departmental majors, and
graduate students. At the same time, the Com
mittee is convinced of one true observation:
the best advising takes place where advisee
and adviser have some kind of common bond,
beyond the routine. This may be the bond of
the same field of study (the normal pre-set
bond between graduate students and faculty),
some common experience (frequently that the
student has taken the faculty member's
course), or prior acquaintance.
From this standpoint, the advising of fresh
men is the most difficult task, for freshmen
rarely have any existing bond to a faculty
member. It must be established. The Commit
tee has been divided upon several possible ways
to handle freshman advising. That the faculty
should carry the bulk of the advising seems
wise, yet a student's assigned adviser only
rarely turns out to be important or helpful
to him. As the freshman year curriculum now
stands, freshmen rarely come into close con
tact with faculty members, except those al
-most as transient as themselves: English
TA's, Western Civ instructors, lab TA's, and
beginning math and language TA's. The In
crease of Freshman seminars may improve
the range of faculty contact. The plans of
assigning advisers to groups in living units
has been extremely spotty in its effectiveness,
and it suffers from the fact that the advisers
remain abstractly faculty members, rather
than being perceived in their active teaching
roles. Relationships of freshman to faculty
residents or directors of living units, to tutors,
and to sponsors are relatively close, and these
persons in fact do the bulk of freshman ad
vising. The Trancos experiment is one possible
model of freshman advising, where residence
director, sponsors and tutors, and a team of
faculty advisers work closely together. Fresh
man advising ought to aid in the orientation
of the entering student, j.etting him off on the
right foot, proposing seriously that he identify
areas of genuine intellectual interest. Such
advising should prepare the student to find
a permanent academic adviser as he goes.
The Committee is unanimous in suggesting
that advising will become more effective from
all sides if the student ultimately chooses his
own adviser. In fact this frequently happens
now, except that the adviser whom the stu
dent chooses is often not the one responsible
for signing his card. We see the following
arguments in favor of this idea: 1. The stu
dent will most likely choose a faculty mem
ber whom he has seen in action, knows some
thing of his qualities and the "cut of his jib."
2. Such a relationship would underscore the
obligation of both student and adviser for
tion in which the student is interested and
tion In which the student is interested an
which makes coherent academic sense of his
interests and career plans. (The Committee
believes, parenthetically, that changing ad
visers and programs ought to be quite easy,
with no prejudice attached to it.) 3. If the
structure of the freshman year becomes less
prescribed, freshmen will have access to a
broader range of course options and of faculty
members than is now the case and will be
more likely to identify someone with whom
they believe they can work.
Certain problems with this arrangement can
be foreseen. 1. Some very popular professors
will be swamped with advisees, and other fac
ulty members will have few or none. To this
the Committee would propose that limitations
on the number of advisees per faculty member
be administratively established (see below.) 2.
Understaffed departments will have too many
majors to observe the limitations, and will have
to continue assigning majors to advisers. To
this the Committee proposes that the student's
adviser need not, though he may, be in the stu
dent's own major department. If the adviser is
not charged to keep track of regulations, it is
not at all unlikely that a professor in one de
partment can help a student in another to pur
sue a course that both meets the standards laid
down by the department and satisfies the stu
dent's own academic needs and wants. Depart
ments might require countersignature of study
cards by departmental representatives. Any
student seriously wishing to become a his
torian, for example, will probably try to find
a historian as adviser in order to get help in
preparing to be like him. We recognize that
in some programs, e.g. Philosophy and the
Honors Program in Humanities, the adviser
docs considerable tutoring of the student in
his senior year. This does not seem to us in
compatible with the basic premise. We are in
clined, on the undergraduate level, to resist
departmental "imperialism," which demands
control over "its" students. An undergraduate
major need not, after all, be occupational prep
aration, but, especially in the Humanities and
Social Sciences, is rather a point of co
herence for one's entire liberal education. Stu
dents who wish strong identification with a
discipline or department may gain it by choos
ing advisers there. Students who do not want
such a concentration may be well served by
advisers from almost anywhere in the Uni
versity.
Such a plan would introduce a differentia
tion between freshman and upperclass advis
ing, in place of the present differentiation be
tween General Studies and major advising.
The Committee is inclined to believe that the
former differentiation would make all advis
ing more effective with regard to general ed
ucation. We are not yet agreed as to the time
when a student must have chosen his adviser.
Some might stay with the person to whom they
were assigned as freshmen; others would find
an adviser during the freshman year; still
others during the sophomore year. Some stu
dents might have three or four different ad
visers during their careers. We see no compel
ing reason why that should be forbidden,
though frequent changes may be a signal that
counseling of some kind is needed. As at pres
ent, students will continue to seek out advice
from faculty members whom they like and
trust, no matter who is the officially designated
adviser. The present suggestion is intended to
take advantage of that fact of life.
The advising of graduate students might
seem to be self-evident. No one except grad
uate students themselves seems to feel it a
problem. Some responsibilities which many

departments seem not to handle well with
graduate students are the following: (1) intro
ducing new students to the University; (2) in
forming students about and channeling them,
when need is present, to the Counseling and
Testing Center, Cowell Halth Service, the
Placement Service, etc.; (3) giving students
vocational advice and sometimes placing them;
(4) informing new students about housing pos
sibilities and problems; (5) informing students
about useful training obtainable on a reg
ular basis in other departments. The pro
blem here is different from that of under
graduates in that the graduate student is
earnestly in the process of professional prep
aration. There is a certain emulative aspect to
graduate study, therefore, because many grad
uate students (certainly not nearly 100%) are
working with people with whom they expect
ultimately to become colleagues. It seems to
us probable that at present graduate students
select their own advisers to an extent that un
dergraduate do not. The function of faculty in
attracting graduate students to any university
assures that the potential of full relationships
is present. A stronger administrative surveil
lance of graduate advising might help to over
come the deficiences of individual departments.
Some special problems. Three groups of stu
dents present special problems to which the
Committee does not yet have answers. It is
clear that transfer students could use far bet
ter help on arrival than most of them get. It is
also clear that their problems are different
from those faced by freshman. We believe that
transfer students should bo given high priority
for on-campus housing. It also seems to us
that the evaluation of transfer credits could
be expedited and improved in many ways.
Some faculty members might be especially en
couraged to handle transfer students. We de
sire further suggestions about the advising of
transfer students from anyone with ideas to
give.
Another group of students with problems to
which the Committee has not yet given
sufficient attention is foreign students. The
Beehtel International Center is a source of
remarkably fine personal attention to foreign
students. But this group has academic prob
lems peculiarly their own, and some made of
advising needs, we think, to be tailored to
them. Again, the Committee wishes to be
helped by ideas.
The third group is comprised of members
of minorities with special disadvantages. Ad
vising needs to have cognizance both of the
personal problems faced by such students and
of academic needs. Efforts to provide tutoring
from the Office of Financial Aids have been
sporadic, due largely to stringently limited
funds. Some more formal program of tutoring
and counsel would greatly increase the accessi
bility of an adequate Stanford education for
such students. Stanford has publicly stated its
intention to do the right thing by these per
sons. Additional support, morally and mone
tarily, needs to be provided.
The extent and rewards of advising. The
Committee believes that advising on all levels
should be taken together in figuring the aver
age ratio of advisees to advisers. Taking fig
ures in the fall Student Directory as sub

stantially correct for numbers of majors and
graduate students in the Schools and Depart
ments, and taking a count of faculty at As
sistant Professor or higher in Courses and De
grees as substantially correct (realizing that
many people in the latter are absent on leave),
and assuming that all of those faculty advise
majors and graduate students, we find the fol
lowing ratios by schools of major and grad
uate advisees to advisers:
Earth Sciences 5.8 (169/29)
Engineering 13.4 (2114A58)
Humanities & Sciences 11.7 (4739/405)
The figures for present General Studies ad
vising, however, look rather different. 115
persons are engaged in 1967-68 in General
Studies advising of 2330 students without de
clared majors, a ratio of 20.2G advisees to each
adviser. Sources of General Studies advisers
are as follows:
Earth Sciences 7 (24% of
school faculty)
Engineering 11 (6.9% of
school faculty)
Humanities & Sciences 45 (11.1% of
school faculty)
Medicine 12
Military Science 2
Physical Education 3
Education 2
Administration 33
The figures show the difficulties encountered
by the Registrar in his task of recruiting
General Studies Advisers. Only 63 ( 54.8%) of
present General Studies advisers come from
the faculties of Schools which will enroll the
advisees as majors. Moreover, only 39% of
General Studies advisers come from the School
of Humanities and Sciences, which can rea
sonably expect to enroll about 80% of un
dergraduates.
At the same time, figures received from De
partments of the School of Humanities and
Sciences show a very wide variation in the
actual advising practice of departments. Some
departments average as few as 4 departmental
advisees per adviser, whereas members of
others may have as many as 66 major ad
visees. Such a figure seems to the Committee
a mockery of the very idea of advising.
One can be only routine with that many ad
visees. The Committee is inclined to believe
that an upper limit on the number of allowable
advisees per adviser should be set, perhaps at
25 or 30, such a figure to include both grad
uate and undergraduate students. The Com
mittee also believes that Deans should ask
executive hads of departments quite search
ing questions about provisions for carrying
advising when many members of a depart
ment propose to be on leave for a given year.
One instance has been reported in which a
member of a large department finds himself
during this academic year with 89 advisees
(graduate, undergraduate major, and Gen
eral Studies) because so many of his col
league are absent on leave. If a limit on ad
visees were set and adhered to, such ex
ploitation would not be permitted.
The Committee has thought very hard about
the place of advising in Stanford's status and
reward system for its faculty. At present, save

for one department that claims to adjust Its
teaching loads in proportion to advising loads,
advising is in fact extra-curricular, in that
it is supposed to be done but no one pays
much attention if it is not done. The Commit
tee is informed that advisers receive extra
pay in some universities, and it has discussed
whether bonus pay would be an incentive to
better advising. We are not satisfied that it
would. We have also asked how a faculty
member's advising effectiveness might be a
factor in his promotion and salary increment.
Nothing would please the Committee more
than to be shown a method of accurate evalua
tion of this effectiveness, so that it could be
used as one among other determinants. We
have yet to find a method. Even if the stu
dent were to choose his adviser, one could not
determine the adviser's effectiveness merely
by counting the number of his advisees.
The Committee believes that advising will
be able to play a role in the status and re
ward system only if the faculty becomes so
committed to the advising function (which,
for the Committee, is integral to the educa
tional function) that the very commitment
produces a means of reward. The faculty
must decide that advising is important, and
the faculty at large must expend some energy
in advising. Pressure probably ought to be
exerted on those of our colleagues who would
rather not advise students, although the very
reluctant adviser will likely not be a very
good one. Perhaps, in considerations of reward
and promotion, nothing more than a negative
question can be asked. If a brilliant research
er does no advising, can his research contribu
tions outweigh the absence of his contribu
tion to the University's humanity? In some in
stances, the answer might have to be "No."
So far as the Committee knows, the question
has never been asked.
Advising in the professor's profession. The
Committee has expressed its conviction that
advising students is properly a part of the
educational profession, that such an as
sumption ought if possible to be an element
in consideration of reward. We suggest, more
over, that prospective faculty appointees be
informed of advising obligations of Stanford
faculty members. We would also suggest a
more long-range way of achieving the actuality
of this assumption. It has often been pointed
out that among the weakest aspects of grad
uate education today is the failure to prepare
people for their profession. Graduate students
are trained to do research, but many of them
are hired to be teachers and members of fac
ulties. We do not wish to underplay research.
But too little is done to train those of our grad
uate students who will become teachers for
their actual professional functions. The Com
mittee suggests the advisability of instruc
tion for graduate students in the scope of the
objectives and responsibilities of their chosen
profession, which will help them comprehend
the expectations under which they will work.
Such instruction could go a long way toward
making actual the ideal that professors are
engaged in education, an activity that includes
research and publication, classroom teach
ing, and the education of individual students
outside of formal instruction that advising
ought to be. When education in that sense be
comes the basic assumption of the University's

life, we will be on the way toward the fulfill
ment of our humanity.

Epilogue:
Enablement and
Surveillance
It is hoped that in such a relatively casual
and self selecting system as that proposed
above, the quiet and unspectacular job that
needs to be done will proceed. But responsibili
ty for watching it must be lodged somewhere
more specific than in the hearts and minds of
the 20,000-odd souls of the Stanford commun
ity. There needs to be improved liaison among
agencies, assurance that stated functions are
being fulfilled, exhortation if not pressure
for participation in both given and receiving.
It was suggested, half jocularly, in the Com
mittee that what is wanted is a "University
humane ofTice.'The term is simplistic, but the
thought is precise. To indicate, to itself and
everyone else, that Stanford means its hu
manity, the responsibility should be assumed
by a highly placed officer, of at least Associate
Provost rank, whose responsibilities would in
clude the coordination of advising and coun
seling structures.
The Committee remains uncertain whether
the responsibility should be added to those
carried by the Dean of Students, whether it
should be assigned to a Dean of Undergraduate
Educationâ€”should such a position be rein
statedâ€”or whether a new position should be
created. In favor of the first is the fact that
the Dean of Students is now responsible for
several agencies in which counseling and ad
vising take place. On the other hand, the ed
ucational thrust of the entire program might
suggest that the responsibility be held by a
distinctly academic officer such as a Dean of
Undergraduate Education. At the same time,
the fact that advising and counseling must af
fect graduate as well as undergraduate stu
dents makes desirable that the officer not be
exclusively occupied with undergraduates.
Whoever such a person might be, and what
ever his title, he must be accessible to and
trustable by students, command the respect
and attract the cooperation of the faculty, and
display remarkable virtues to non-academic
staff persons.

This paper is presented to the University
community by the Committee on Advising and
Couast'lint; of the Study of Education at Stan
ford. It is important to say tliat the paper is
intended not as a recommendation for immedi
ate decision hut as some proposals for discus
sion.
Hearings will take place 7 9 p.m. Tuesday
and 4-fi p.m. Wednesday in room 143 of Meyer
Library. Members of the committee will be
present to receive comments on the paper. The
Committee also welcomes written responses to
the SES office, Meyer Library.
Few subjects are so frequently the target of
criticism as advising, few so rarely the object
of constructive suggestion. Widespread agree
ment thai advising is not very well done at
Stanford is equalled by imprecision as to the
problem and feasible solutions. Our realism
breeds cynicism, concluding that we must ac
cept inadequacy.
The Committee on Advising and Counseling
of the Study of Education at Stanford has at
tempted to be realistic but not cynical. Mow
ever unlikely the radical alteration of human
nature may be, the alteration of perspectives
and priorities is well within our reach. The
Committee urges the University's members,
however, that unless assumptions are modi
fied the cynics will he proven right. Foremost
among the assumptions that require adjust
ment is the tacit one that for a faculty mem
ber advising is an extracurricular activity.
This assumption produces hesitance on the
part of many students to consult advisers ex
cept for routine card-signing for fear of "tak
ing up his time," and their resultant complaint
that advising at Stanford is nothing but rou
tine. It produces the perception on the part of
faculty members that advising, except for one's
"own" special (preferably graduate) students,
is a chore to be avoided if possible and to be
disposed of quickly if avoidance is not possible.
It produces among administrators complete ig
norance of inequities in advising loads and the
ignoring of the function of advising in con
siderations of appointment, promotion, and re
ward.
The Committee is not so blindered as to sup
pose that advising is the most important as
pect of university life. But it is sensitive to
the penetration of aspects of advising into al
most everything Stanford does, from admis
sions to residence policy to undergraduate and
graduate curriculum to student services to the
extra-curriculum to placement and vocational
decisions. In what follows we have made some
assumption that bear explication. First, we
suppose that advising has basically to do with
the possibility of significant relations and com
munication between persons, that it sums up
what we intend by our sub-title: "the humani
ty of the University." Second, we assume that
the educational direction Stanford is taking
will entail more advising, not less, on both
graduate and undergraduate levels, and a high
er degree of humanity, not a lower. Third, we
assume that, since no system is perfect, an ar
rangement of advising that allows several
quite different forms and structures of advis
ing to take place will come closer to self-re
newal than a single, potentially rigid system.
The problem, as we presently see it, has
three points of focus: 1. the dissemination to
everyone who needs it of accurate and com
plete information; 2. the availability to anyone
who needs it of competent professional coun
seling; 3. the accessibility to all students of
Interested and personal academic advice.
I. Dissemination
of Information
The story about the man who did not have
enough information to take instruction is rele
vant to the problem of advising. The Commit
tee believes that adequate and accurate infor
mation on most matters regarding the Univer
sity is readily available to those who wish and
need to have it. Ignorance and misinformation
are widespread, however, some of it difficult
to understand.
The information that needs dissemination is
that which makes possible (1) awareness on
the part of faculty and students alike of exact
ly what the University's communal and aca
demic facilities are; (2) access by members of
the University to the various services provid
ed; (3) informed decisions about academic
matters on the part of students.
A great deal of this information can be and
is conveyed in print, but people forget things
when they read them in almost unnumerable
bulletins, pamphlets, brochures, hand-bills, mi
meographed or dittoed sheets, and the like.
The variety is compounded by the fact that
certain published materials are factual in na
ture and others are more propagandists in
tone and purpose, by the fact that some infor
mation is obsolete before it is ever printed and
some is incomplete.
The Committee suggests basic simplification
into two yearly publications. One is an expand
ed version of the present rather slim Informa
tion Bulletin, to serve as a more general hand
book to the University. Here should be de
tailed information on matters not covered in
Courses and Degrees: fees and expenses, resi
dences, relatively permanent organizations and
activities both student and University-wide,
services available to the community such as
those of the Health Service, the Counseling
and Testing Center, the Bechtel International
Center, and others. Also in such a handbook
might be found brief descriptions of the ad
ministrative operation of the University, the
duties and powers of its various officers, and
policies affecting various of its members.
Through such a publication, which should be
routinely in the hands of everyone, both stu
dents and faculty could find how to get help
for all kinds of problems. New students and
new faculty members in particular would, with

its aid, more easily find their ways in the Uni
versity.
Parenthetically, the Committee also sees a
need for a faculty handbook, which would in
form faculty members of such policies of ap
pointment, promotion, tenure, and administra
tive arrangement as are especially relevant to
them.
The Committee wishes, moreover, that Cour
ses and I)egre<>s might he improved. The in
formation in it is frequently obsolete before
the book comes off the press. Might there not
be in the den of someone at Stanford printing
methods that could reduce the lag between
copy deadlines and publication? Would the
improvement of accuracy allowed by an Aug
ust publication date outweigh the advantage
for incoming students of the present May pub
lication? Students and advisers alike now hesi
tate to use Courses and Degrees as a basis
for planning the work of even a single year in
advance. The Committee wonders, then, wheth
er usefulness for planning to those already
here should not have priority over usefulness
for those about to come. In the light of the in
creasing need for advanced academic planning
by students, greater accuracy becomes even
more desirable. Moreover, if Courses and De
grees wore improved and up-dated, the expense
of the quarterly Time Schedule might be re
duced by making it no more than a supple
ment to Courses and Degrees.
All of these publications would bo of im
mense help to advisers and their advisees. The
Committee is of the opinion that the adviser's
function should not be to disseminate informa
tion that the student can more readily receive
otherwise. In saying that, we take full cog
nizance of the high likelihood that anything in
print will be misunderstood, misconstrued, or
misused somewhere by someone. Where the
adviser perceives ignorance, he must, of
course, rectify itâ€”and the student may do the
same. The adviser will function well with an
advisee when both have the necessary infor
mation, for then the adviser is free to advise
instead of merely to inform.
Concomitantly, the Committee believes that
the adviser should be relieved of policing cur
ricular regulations. So much of academic ad
vising is taken up with routine questions about
the fulfillment of requirements (How many
units of Science have you left to take? How
much math? etc.) that time for genuine and
personalized advice is too often at a premium.
The Committee has a hunch, moreover, (1)
that on the whole students know the require
ments in General Studies and in major pro
grams better than their advisers do, and (2)
that students almost always know exactly
where they stand with regard to those require
ments. The Committee wonders about the feas
ibility of computerizing information of these
kinds to enable easy retrieval. If machines can
free us for the improvement of our humanity,
we should by all means use them.
In short, the Committee believes that advis
ing could be far better focussed on advice if
the dissemination of information were both
simplified and improved, so that the adviser
does not have to be a traffic cop of regulations.
11. Availability
of Counseling
For clarity of terminology, we use the term
"counseling" to mean the impartation of help
for problems of a personal sort, not immediate
ly involving the academic, while "advising" is
restricted in this paper to academic advice.
It is certainly the case that a great deal of
counseling in this sense occurs in any commu
nity as large and as complex as Stanford. Most
of it is casual, among close friends, and with
no pretense of professional expertise. This
sort of counseling will happen whether the
institution encourages or discourages it. Any
attempt to structure such relationships is, of
course, doomed to failure. Faculty members
also do a great deal of counseling of this kind.
Though some may criticize the non-profession
al nature of such counseling, that may in itself
bo one of the'strengths of the relationship. At
the same time, situations frequently arise
where professional counseling is needed and
any casual counselor should always have in
mind the possibility of referring someone to
sources of professional aid. The Committee has
not conceived of any way by which faculty or
other such occasional counselors might cus
tomarily be taught how to recognize danger
signals, but they should be aware of an obli
gation to suggest referral.
Nevertheless, sources of professional coun
seling are present at Stanford, and the Com
mittee has been surprise that some members
of the University, both faculty and students,
seem unaware of them. Apart from the coun
seling done in residences < faculty residents,
residence directors, resident assistants, tutors,
and sponsors), which would have to be called
at best semi-professional, counseling done by
campus religious representatives, and that
done in special circumstances by persons in
the Dean of Students' office, the University
maintains two major sources of professional
counseling and a third that might become one.
We refer in the first instance to the Counsel
ing and Testing Center and to the psychiatric
services of the Cowell Health Center, and in
the second instance to the Placement Service.
The Counseling and Testing Center provides
psychological testing of many kinds and both
short-range and long-range psychological coun
seling. The psychiatric staff of the Cowell
Health Center is available for psychiatric con
sultation and some forms of therapy, and pa
tients in need of long-range therapy are re
ferred to psychiatrists in the School of Medi
cine for it.
The Committee has no wish to enter into the
relative merits of these two approaches, be
lieving that both meet various kinds of situ
ations helpfully. The liaison between the Conn

soling and Testing Center and the Cowell
Health reportedly good and getting
better. Such liaison and cooperation should be
encouraged by the University administration.
The fact that a relatively small proportion of
Stanford students uses the counseling services
in these two institutions may be an index of
the community's relatively healthy mental
state. On the other hand, experience hÂ°re and
in other universities would seem to indicate
that there are many more problems than are
actually met by these services. Larger staffs
would doubtless encourage more students with
real problems to seek aid.
It has been rightly observed that while any
person lacks the medical or psychological
help he needs, the job of counseling is not be
ing properly done. One of our faculty col
leagues recently stated that "One student sui
cide per year is one too many," a sentiment
with which no one could quarrel. But preven
tion in the realm of counseling is the most
difficult task. For one thing, it requires the
willing cooperation of the patient or subject.
The continued excellence and improvement
of these two services seems to the Committee,
however, a matter of rather high priority. We
are in a period where the mental strains upon
the age group of Stanford students are great
and on the increase. It is no pampering mood
that leads to the conclusion that professional
aid is needed; it is rather the sense of urgency
that informs higher education, and the wish
that barriers to the best education every stu
dent is capable of absorbing be as far as possi
ble thrown down. We do not believe that the
improvement of, say, the Counseling and Test
ing Center is more important than the im
provement of the faculty. But believing in the
priority of the academic, we wish it to be aided
by the best medical and psychological services
Stanford can afford to render.
We have few specific recommendations,
apart from general improvementâ€”which In
itself ought not to be taken as underhanded
criticism. The first contact with the Counsel
ing and Testing Center ought to make clear
to entering students that genuine personal
counsel may be had there. We are dubious
that the orientation-week testing is a good in
troduction for students, valuable as the re
sults may be for staff research. The counsel
ing function should be made more distinct
from that of legitimate research.
The most difficult question with which the
Committee has long wrestled is how to be
sure that the people who need the help receive
it. To that question, we have no satisfactory
answer. The availability of the services should
b" widely publicized and accurately described.
Every member of the University should know
about them. But the person who refuses to
seek help when he needs it can not, by any
means the Committee has been able to discov
er, be forced to have it.
The Committee notes with satisfaction the
recent improvements in the situation of reli
gious ministries on the campus. Although not
every religious tradition is officially repre
sented, persons desiring counseling of a reli
gious sort have access to a broad range of
clergymen and denominational representatives.
Since campus office space was made available
to denominational representatives, the work
of the Pean of the Chapel and his assistant
and of the University Chaplain has been en
larged by cooperation. To those who doubt the
propriety of the presence of clergymen on a
university campus, the Committee would say
that the day when religious bodies looked on
the ministry to students as a salvage operation
from the godless university is long past. Safe
guards against irresponsibility in this as in
other areas of interest can be established ad
ministratively. Those members of the Univer
sity who find religious counsel helpful and nec
essary can and do seek it out.
By virtue of the fact that Selective Service
is of immediate concern to the majority of
Stanford students, the Committee has consid
ered advising facilities offered regarding the
draft. A National Service Adviser has for
some time been available. The Committee ap
plauds the addition of a counselor on con
scientious objection to the student facilities
available on campus. We anticipate that such
an office will be continued while the question
of the draft is pertinent, and suggest that the
amount of student need for such counsel re
quires the availability of more time than is
now provided. The different natures of the
counseling involved makes it advisable to keep
separate the conscientious objection counsel
ing and National Service advising. Greater co
ordination of the latter with the ROTC offices
and the Placement Service would facilitate the
answering of questions faced by many stu
dents in regard to the options available for
fulfillment of military service. However, the
effectiveness of both offices is hampered at
present by lack of information reaching the
student. Publicizing these services in the hand
book to the University proposed above, and by
whatever means are now available, and the
initiation of orientation sessions with tutors,
residence assistants, and directors may begin
to alleviate this inadequacy.
The Placement Service is kept until last be
cause the Committee believes substantial ex
pansion is possible and desirable. At present
the Placement Service is a means to bring
prospective employees into contact with pros
pective employers and to aid students to re
ceive part-time and summer jobs. With ex
pense (the Committee does not wish to guess
how much* and reorganization, the Placement
Service could become a Career Guidance Cen
ter. This change would put job interviews into
perspective as aspects of a more thorough in
vestigation by the individual of his wishes and
talents for a career. Facilities for aptitude
tests of various kinds would be needed, as well
as staff to process and counsel regarding such
tests. For this purpose, it would he well to
shift the efforts in career counseling now car
ried on by the Counseling and Testing Center
to an expanded Career Guidance Center. Infor

mation on opportunities and requisites for ca
reers of many kinds could conveniently be
gathered and sometimes produced by a Career
Guidance Center, and one might expect to find
in it the current catalogues of graduate and
professional schools across the country.
It has often been remarked that, for all the
Founders' desires that a Stanford education
should fit students for useful pursuits, the ac
cessibility of career counsel is rather slim
hÂ°re. In feeling that the situation bears im
provement the Committee does not imply that
every student should have made a clear voca
tional choice by the end of his senior year. But
students wishing to make informed and ra
tional choices of careers should have access as
early as possible to information and individual
ized counsel regarding the options. A Career
Guidance Center might have the contacts to
place students in part-time and temporary
jobs with persons in careers that the students
are considering, experience which might be
invaluable whether it be positive or negative.
Other methods of gaining insight into vari
ous kinds of professional life may likewise
gain momentum. A proposal now being con
sidered suggests the establishment of sopho
more and higher level courses on the profes
sions, taught from the perspectives of both
the humanities and the social sciences. Such
courses would be informational and descriptive
and in no sense recruitment techniques. Still
other means might be found to make available
for students bases for wise career decisions.
The present admirable advising done by facul
ty members of the School of Medicine with
and for pre-medical students could profitably
be emulated elsewhere. Could not the Schools
of Law, Business, and Education, for example,
provide similar counsel in cooperation with a
Career Guidance Center? The Committee pre
sumes that remuneration occupations will for
some time be necessary for most members of
American society. There is point, therefore, to
the thought that education can be useful, even
though that is far from being the whole point
of education.
111. Academic
Advising
If personal counseling is very largely done
casually and by amateurs, so is academic ad
vising. Most of the advising done at Stanford
is done by one undergraduate to another. The
Committee heartily approves this state of af
fairs at the same time that it is not satisfied
to abandon faculty advising.
Student Advising. Several aspects of under
graduate advising are carried by undergradu
ates. Students get their best information about
the value of specific courses from other stu
dents who have taken them. This is only natu
ral. Faculty members are loath to comment
on their colleagues, for reasons of professional
propriety; students are not. Moreover, faculty
members can talk about courses taught by
their colleagues only by hearsay, where stu
dents can speak at first hand. Such informal
advising is valuable, even though it is fre
quently biased. Sporadic attempts have been
made to bring it usefully into published form,
with such documents as the Course Review,
succeeding the earlier "Scratch Sheet." The
Committee applauds the concept of a student
Course Review as a valuable asset to advising,
and wishes that it might be thorough in its
coverage of courses, representative of a varie
ty of student reactions, and sensitive to stated
aims of professors in courses. Such a review
would also inform professors helpfully about
responses to the courses. The Course Review
ought to appear regularly, with cooperation
and financial assistance from the University
but without administrative control.
A recent experiment in appointing students
as advisers-at-large in their major departments
produced uncertain results. The fault may lie
partially in a lack of information about the
program, in student suspicion that student
advisers would be "administration types," in
students' feelings that they could get as good
advice from their friendsâ€”or in any possible
combination of those and other factors. The
Committee is not satisfied that student de
partmental advising is a bad idea, especially
on the basis of one year's experiment in three
departments. It exhorts departments and
schools to keep trying to find ways of taking
advantage of students' advising abilities.
The function of the adviser. We have already
expressed the Committee's suggestion that ad
vising not be simply a matter of policing, of
making sure that the student has information
and is taking the courses he is required to
take. The Adviser's Handbook describes the
goal of advising as bringing "the student to
the point where he can assume a maximum
amount of responsibility for his own academic
program and can make wise decisions on his
own" (p. 12). The Committee wishes to go be
yond that to propose that the adviser be
viewed both by the student and by himself as
the student's academic advocate, the particular
educator who agrees to concern himself with
his advisee's best education. This means prin
cipally that the adviser wishes to help the
student plan an educational career that goes
somewhere, that has coherence and point to it,
rather than being a miscellaneous collection
of requirements and aimless electives. If the
adviser is the student's advocate, however, this
coherence must be a means of enabling the
student's wishes and strengths to be embodied
in his program, not a way for the adviser to
impose his own concepts on the student.
Such a concept would, to he sure, produce
advising that takes more time, for carefully
considering with a student his academic ob
jectives and intellectual curiosities consumes
more time that simply signing his card. But if
such advising is understood and underscored
by tin 1 faculty as integral 1o education, faculty
members may more happily engage in it. It

poses several problems, among which is the
acceptance of advising as a normal aspect of
academic appointment at Stanford. If such
advising will not be done by the faculty, some
one must do it. In the absence of good faculty
advising, a corps of professional advisers
would probably have to be retained to the dam
age of the budget and of the academic exper
tise with which advising ought to be done. On
all counts, the Committee emphatically prefers
faculty advising.
The student's stake in advising. A curious
duality is sometimes to be observed among
students. On the one hand, they firmly ob
ject to be treated as ciphers or as children by
an institution standing in loco parentis. On
the other .they wish the advice of their elders
among the faculty, and this wish is sometimes
Indistinguishable from a desire for a parent
surrogate. Occasionally, when the advice given
is not to an individual's liking, he will pro
test that he is not being respected. We point
this out in part to say that the students' own
view of their stake in advising is not crystal
clear.
Although the student knows more about
himself than any adviser is ever likely to
know, he needs advising because he has not
enough experience of education to know pre
cisely how to join his interests and talents
to a curricular regimen. This observation ap
plies equally, though in different perspectives,
to undergraduates and graduate students. The
student looks to an adviser for guidance in
pursuing an education that will take ad
vantage of his interests and lead him beyond
his own provincial boundaries, at the same
time that it is certifiable by the University as
meeting its standards. The University, of
course, must determine what those standards
are, since it is the body doing the certifying.
The adviser stands toward the student in the
peculiar position of being at once a represen
tative of the University's power of sanction
upon the student (he makes judgments on stu
dents' performance) and and the advocate of
that particula student in the acquisition of his
most effective education.
If the structure of degree requirements on
the graduate level becomes less prescriptive,
the premium on interested advising which
aids the student toward coherence as well as
adventuresomeness will rise. Experience will
count for much in a student's planning, al
though it should not be prescriptively applied.
What is at stake for the student in a more flex
ible under-graduate program is precisely the
humanity of an adviser who is genuinely the
student's educational advocate. If the program
is flexible, advocacy need not consist in find
ing ways to circumvent regulations.
The levels of advising and their problems.
Special and different problems of advising ob
tain for freshmen, transfers, upperclass un
dergraduates and departmental majors, and
graduate students. At the same time, the Com
mittee is convinced of one true observation:
the best advising takes place where advisee
and adviser have some kind of common bond,
beyond the routine. This may be the bond of
the same field of study (the normal pre-set
bond between graduate students and faculty),
some common experience (frequently that the
student has taken the faculty member's
course), or prior acquaintance.
From this standpoint, the advising of fresh
men is the most difficult task, for freshmen
rarely have any existing bond to a faculty
member. It must be established. The Commit
tee has been divided upon several possible ways
to handle freshman advising. That the faculty
should carry the bulk of the advising seems
wise, yet a student's assigned adviser only
rarely turns out to be important or helpful
to him. As the freshman year curriculum now
stands, freshmen rarely come into close con
tact with faculty members, except those al
-most as transient as themselves: English
TA's, Western Civ instructors, lab TA's, and
beginning math and language TA's. The In
crease of Freshman seminars may improve
the range of faculty contact. The plans of
assigning advisers to groups in living units
has been extremely spotty in its effectiveness,
and it suffers from the fact that the advisers
remain abstractly faculty members, rather
than being perceived in their active teaching
roles. Relationships of freshman to faculty
residents or directors of living units, to tutors,
and to sponsors are relatively close, and these
persons in fact do the bulk of freshman ad
vising. The Trancos experiment is one possible
model of freshman advising, where residence
director, sponsors and tutors, and a team of
faculty advisers work closely together. Fresh
man advising ought to aid in the orientation
of the entering student, j.etting him off on the
right foot, proposing seriously that he identify
areas of genuine intellectual interest. Such
advising should prepare the student to find
a permanent academic adviser as he goes.
The Committee is unanimous in suggesting
that advising will become more effective from
all sides if the student ultimately chooses his
own adviser. In fact this frequently happens
now, except that the adviser whom the stu
dent chooses is often not the one responsible
for signing his card. We see the following
arguments in favor of this idea: 1. The stu
dent will most likely choose a faculty mem
ber whom he has seen in action, knows some
thing of his qualities and the "cut of his jib."
2. Such a relationship would underscore the
obligation of both student and adviser for
tion in which the student is interested and
tion In which the student is interested an
which makes coherent academic sense of his
interests and career plans. (The Committee
believes, parenthetically, that changing ad
visers and programs ought to be quite easy,
with no prejudice attached to it.) 3. If the
structure of the freshman year becomes less
prescribed, freshmen will have access to a
broader range of course options and of faculty
members than is now the case and will be
more likely to identify someone with whom
they believe they can work.
Certain problems with this arrangement can
be foreseen. 1. Some very popular professors
will be swamped with advisees, and other fac
ulty members will have few or none. To this
the Committee would propose that limitations
on the number of advisees per faculty member
be administratively established (see below.) 2.
Understaffed departments will have too many
majors to observe the limitations, and will have
to continue assigning majors to advisers. To
this the Committee proposes that the student's
adviser need not, though he may, be in the stu
dent's own major department. If the adviser is
not charged to keep track of regulations, it is
not at all unlikely that a professor in one de
partment can help a student in another to pur
sue a course that both meets the standards laid
down by the department and satisfies the stu
dent's own academic needs and wants. Depart
ments might require countersignature of study
cards by departmental representatives. Any
student seriously wishing to become a his
torian, for example, will probably try to find
a historian as adviser in order to get help in
preparing to be like him. We recognize that
in some programs, e.g. Philosophy and the
Honors Program in Humanities, the adviser
docs considerable tutoring of the student in
his senior year. This does not seem to us in
compatible with the basic premise. We are in
clined, on the undergraduate level, to resist
departmental "imperialism," which demands
control over "its" students. An undergraduate
major need not, after all, be occupational prep
aration, but, especially in the Humanities and
Social Sciences, is rather a point of co
herence for one's entire liberal education. Stu
dents who wish strong identification with a
discipline or department may gain it by choos
ing advisers there. Students who do not want
such a concentration may be well served by
advisers from almost anywhere in the Uni
versity.
Such a plan would introduce a differentia
tion between freshman and upperclass advis
ing, in place of the present differentiation be
tween General Studies and major advising.
The Committee is inclined to believe that the
former differentiation would make all advis
ing more effective with regard to general ed
ucation. We are not yet agreed as to the time
when a student must have chosen his adviser.
Some might stay with the person to whom they
were assigned as freshmen; others would find
an adviser during the freshman year; still
others during the sophomore year. Some stu
dents might have three or four different ad
visers during their careers. We see no compel
ing reason why that should be forbidden,
though frequent changes may be a signal that
counseling of some kind is needed. As at pres
ent, students will continue to seek out advice
from faculty members whom they like and
trust, no matter who is the officially designated
adviser. The present suggestion is intended to
take advantage of that fact of life.
The advising of graduate students might
seem to be self-evident. No one except grad
uate students themselves seems to feel it a
problem. Some responsibilities which many

departments seem not to handle well with
graduate students are the following: (1) intro
ducing new students to the University; (2) in
forming students about and channeling them,
when need is present, to the Counseling and
Testing Center, Cowell Halth Service, the
Placement Service, etc.; (3) giving students
vocational advice and sometimes placing them;
(4) informing new students about housing pos
sibilities and problems; (5) informing students
about useful training obtainable on a reg
ular basis in other departments. The pro
blem here is different from that of under
graduates in that the graduate student is
earnestly in the process of professional prep
aration. There is a certain emulative aspect to
graduate study, therefore, because many grad
uate students (certainly not nearly 100%) are
working with people with whom they expect
ultimately to become colleagues. It seems to
us probable that at present graduate students
select their own advisers to an extent that un
dergraduate do not. The function of faculty in
attracting graduate students to any university
assures that the potential of full relationships
is present. A stronger administrative surveil
lance of graduate advising might help to over
come the deficiences of individual departments.
Some special problems. Three groups of stu
dents present special problems to which the
Committee does not yet have answers. It is
clear that transfer students could use far bet
ter help on arrival than most of them get. It is
also clear that their problems are different
from those faced by freshman. We believe that
transfer students should bo given high priority
for on-campus housing. It also seems to us
that the evaluation of transfer credits could
be expedited and improved in many ways.
Some faculty members might be especially en
couraged to handle transfer students. We de
sire further suggestions about the advising of
transfer students from anyone with ideas to
give.
Another group of students with problems to
which the Committee has not yet given
sufficient attention is foreign students. The
Beehtel International Center is a source of
remarkably fine personal attention to foreign
students. But this group has academic prob
lems peculiarly their own, and some made of
advising needs, we think, to be tailored to
them. Again, the Committee wishes to be
helped by ideas.
The third group is comprised of members
of minorities with special disadvantages. Ad
vising needs to have cognizance both of the
personal problems faced by such students and
of academic needs. Efforts to provide tutoring
from the Office of Financial Aids have been
sporadic, due largely to stringently limited
funds. Some more formal program of tutoring
and counsel would greatly increase the accessi
bility of an adequate Stanford education for
such students. Stanford has publicly stated its
intention to do the right thing by these per
sons. Additional support, morally and mone
tarily, needs to be provided.
The extent and rewards of advising. The
Committee believes that advising on all levels
should be taken together in figuring the aver
age ratio of advisees to advisers. Taking fig
ures in the fall Student Directory as sub

stantially correct for numbers of majors and
graduate students in the Schools and Depart
ments, and taking a count of faculty at As
sistant Professor or higher in Courses and De
grees as substantially correct (realizing that
many people in the latter are absent on leave),
and assuming that all of those faculty advise
majors and graduate students, we find the fol
lowing ratios by schools of major and grad
uate advisees to advisers:
Earth Sciences 5.8 (169/29)
Engineering 13.4 (2114A58)
Humanities & Sciences 11.7 (4739/405)
The figures for present General Studies ad
vising, however, look rather different. 115
persons are engaged in 1967-68 in General
Studies advising of 2330 students without de
clared majors, a ratio of 20.2G advisees to each
adviser. Sources of General Studies advisers
are as follows:
Earth Sciences 7 (24% of
school faculty)
Engineering 11 (6.9% of
school faculty)
Humanities & Sciences 45 (11.1% of
school faculty)
Medicine 12
Military Science 2
Physical Education 3
Education 2
Administration 33
The figures show the difficulties encountered
by the Registrar in his task of recruiting
General Studies Advisers. Only 63 ( 54.8%) of
present General Studies advisers come from
the faculties of Schools which will enroll the
advisees as majors. Moreover, only 39% of
General Studies advisers come from the School
of Humanities and Sciences, which can rea
sonably expect to enroll about 80% of un
dergraduates.
At the same time, figures received from De
partments of the School of Humanities and
Sciences show a very wide variation in the
actual advising practice of departments. Some
departments average as few as 4 departmental
advisees per adviser, whereas members of
others may have as many as 66 major ad
visees. Such a figure seems to the Committee
a mockery of the very idea of advising.
One can be only routine with that many ad
visees. The Committee is inclined to believe
that an upper limit on the number of allowable
advisees per adviser should be set, perhaps at
25 or 30, such a figure to include both grad
uate and undergraduate students. The Com
mittee also believes that Deans should ask
executive hads of departments quite search
ing questions about provisions for carrying
advising when many members of a depart
ment propose to be on leave for a given year.
One instance has been reported in which a
member of a large department finds himself
during this academic year with 89 advisees
(graduate, undergraduate major, and Gen
eral Studies) because so many of his col
league are absent on leave. If a limit on ad
visees were set and adhered to, such ex
ploitation would not be permitted.
The Committee has thought very hard about
the place of advising in Stanford's status and
reward system for its faculty. At present, save

for one department that claims to adjust Its
teaching loads in proportion to advising loads,
advising is in fact extra-curricular, in that
it is supposed to be done but no one pays
much attention if it is not done. The Commit
tee is informed that advisers receive extra
pay in some universities, and it has discussed
whether bonus pay would be an incentive to
better advising. We are not satisfied that it
would. We have also asked how a faculty
member's advising effectiveness might be a
factor in his promotion and salary increment.
Nothing would please the Committee more
than to be shown a method of accurate evalua
tion of this effectiveness, so that it could be
used as one among other determinants. We
have yet to find a method. Even if the stu
dent were to choose his adviser, one could not
determine the adviser's effectiveness merely
by counting the number of his advisees.
The Committee believes that advising will
be able to play a role in the status and re
ward system only if the faculty becomes so
committed to the advising function (which,
for the Committee, is integral to the educa
tional function) that the very commitment
produces a means of reward. The faculty
must decide that advising is important, and
the faculty at large must expend some energy
in advising. Pressure probably ought to be
exerted on those of our colleagues who would
rather not advise students, although the very
reluctant adviser will likely not be a very
good one. Perhaps, in considerations of reward
and promotion, nothing more than a negative
question can be asked. If a brilliant research
er does no advising, can his research contribu
tions outweigh the absence of his contribu
tion to the University's humanity? In some in
stances, the answer might have to be "No."
So far as the Committee knows, the question
has never been asked.
Advising in the professor's profession. The
Committee has expressed its conviction that
advising students is properly a part of the
educational profession, that such an as
sumption ought if possible to be an element
in consideration of reward. We suggest, more
over, that prospective faculty appointees be
informed of advising obligations of Stanford
faculty members. We would also suggest a
more long-range way of achieving the actuality
of this assumption. It has often been pointed
out that among the weakest aspects of grad
uate education today is the failure to prepare
people for their profession. Graduate students
are trained to do research, but many of them
are hired to be teachers and members of fac
ulties. We do not wish to underplay research.
But too little is done to train those of our grad
uate students who will become teachers for
their actual professional functions. The Com
mittee suggests the advisability of instruc
tion for graduate students in the scope of the
objectives and responsibilities of their chosen
profession, which will help them comprehend
the expectations under which they will work.
Such instruction could go a long way toward
making actual the ideal that professors are
engaged in education, an activity that includes
research and publication, classroom teach
ing, and the education of individual students
outside of formal instruction that advising
ought to be. When education in that sense be
comes the basic assumption of the University's

life, we will be on the way toward the fulfill
ment of our humanity.

Epilogue:
Enablement and
Surveillance
It is hoped that in such a relatively casual
and self selecting system as that proposed
above, the quiet and unspectacular job that
needs to be done will proceed. But responsibili
ty for watching it must be lodged somewhere
more specific than in the hearts and minds of
the 20,000-odd souls of the Stanford commun
ity. There needs to be improved liaison among
agencies, assurance that stated functions are
being fulfilled, exhortation if not pressure
for participation in both given and receiving.
It was suggested, half jocularly, in the Com
mittee that what is wanted is a "University
humane ofTice.'The term is simplistic, but the
thought is precise. To indicate, to itself and
everyone else, that Stanford means its hu
manity, the responsibility should be assumed
by a highly placed officer, of at least Associate
Provost rank, whose responsibilities would in
clude the coordination of advising and coun
seling structures.
The Committee remains uncertain whether
the responsibility should be added to those
carried by the Dean of Students, whether it
should be assigned to a Dean of Undergraduate
Educationâ€”should such a position be rein
statedâ€”or whether a new position should be
created. In favor of the first is the fact that
the Dean of Students is now responsible for
several agencies in which counseling and ad
vising take place. On the other hand, the ed
ucational thrust of the entire program might
suggest that the responsibility be held by a
distinctly academic officer such as a Dean of
Undergraduate Education. At the same time,
the fact that advising and counseling must af
fect graduate as well as undergraduate stu
dents makes desirable that the officer not be
exclusively occupied with undergraduates.
Whoever such a person might be, and what
ever his title, he must be accessible to and
trustable by students, command the respect
and attract the cooperation of the faculty, and
display remarkable virtues to non-academic
staff persons.

This paper is presented to the University
community by the Committee on Advising and
Couast'lint; of the Study of Education at Stan
ford. It is important to say tliat the paper is
intended not as a recommendation for immedi
ate decision hut as some proposals for discus
sion.
Hearings will take place 7 9 p.m. Tuesday
and 4-fi p.m. Wednesday in room 143 of Meyer
Library. Members of the committee will be
present to receive comments on the paper. The
Committee also welcomes written responses to
the SES office, Meyer Library.
Few subjects are so frequently the target of
criticism as advising, few so rarely the object
of constructive suggestion. Widespread agree
ment thai advising is not very well done at
Stanford is equalled by imprecision as to the
problem and feasible solutions. Our realism
breeds cynicism, concluding that we must ac
cept inadequacy.
The Committee on Advising and Counseling
of the Study of Education at Stanford has at
tempted to be realistic but not cynical. Mow
ever unlikely the radical alteration of human
nature may be, the alteration of perspectives
and priorities is well within our reach. The
Committee urges the University's members,
however, that unless assumptions are modi
fied the cynics will he proven right. Foremost
among the assumptions that require adjust
ment is the tacit one that for a faculty mem
ber advising is an extracurricular activity.
This assumption produces hesitance on the
part of many students to consult advisers ex
cept for routine card-signing for fear of "tak
ing up his time," and their resultant complaint
that advising at Stanford is nothing but rou
tine. It produces the perception on the part of
faculty members that advising, except for one's
"own" special (preferably graduate) students,
is a chore to be avoided if possible and to be
disposed of quickly if avoidance is not possible.
It produces among administrators complete ig
norance of inequities in advising loads and the
ignoring of the function of advising in con
siderations of appointment, promotion, and re
ward.
The Committee is not so blindered as to sup
pose that advising is the most important as
pect of university life. But it is sensitive to
the penetration of aspects of advising into al
most everything Stanford does, from admis
sions to residence policy to undergraduate and
graduate curriculum to student services to the
extra-curriculum to placement and vocational
decisions. In what follows we have made some
assumption that bear explication. First, we
suppose that advising has basically to do with
the possibility of significant relations and com
munication between persons, that it sums up
what we intend by our sub-title: "the humani
ty of the University." Second, we assume that
the educational direction Stanford is taking
will entail more advising, not less, on both
graduate and undergraduate levels, and a high
er degree of humanity, not a lower. Third, we
assume that, since no system is perfect, an ar
rangement of advising that allows several
quite different forms and structures of advis
ing to take place will come closer to self-re
newal than a single, potentially rigid system.
The problem, as we presently see it, has
three points of focus: 1. the dissemination to
everyone who needs it of accurate and com
plete information; 2. the availability to anyone
who needs it of competent professional coun
seling; 3. the accessibility to all students of
Interested and personal academic advice.
I. Dissemination
of Information
The story about the man who did not have
enough information to take instruction is rele
vant to the problem of advising. The Commit
tee believes that adequate and accurate infor
mation on most matters regarding the Univer
sity is readily available to those who wish and
need to have it. Ignorance and misinformation
are widespread, however, some of it difficult
to understand.
The information that needs dissemination is
that which makes possible (1) awareness on
the part of faculty and students alike of exact
ly what the University's communal and aca
demic facilities are; (2) access by members of
the University to the various services provid
ed; (3) informed decisions about academic
matters on the part of students.
A great deal of this information can be and
is conveyed in print, but people forget things
when they read them in almost unnumerable
bulletins, pamphlets, brochures, hand-bills, mi
meographed or dittoed sheets, and the like.
The variety is compounded by the fact that
certain published materials are factual in na
ture and others are more propagandists in
tone and purpose, by the fact that some infor
mation is obsolete before it is ever printed and
some is incomplete.
The Committee suggests basic simplification
into two yearly publications. One is an expand
ed version of the present rather slim Informa
tion Bulletin, to serve as a more general hand
book to the University. Here should be de
tailed information on matters not covered in
Courses and Degrees: fees and expenses, resi
dences, relatively permanent organizations and
activities both student and University-wide,
services available to the community such as
those of the Health Service, the Counseling
and Testing Center, the Bechtel International
Center, and others. Also in such a handbook
might be found brief descriptions of the ad
ministrative operation of the University, the
duties and powers of its various officers, and
policies affecting various of its members.
Through such a publication, which should be
routinely in the hands of everyone, both stu
dents and faculty could find how to get help
for all kinds of problems. New students and
new faculty members in particular would, with

its aid, more easily find their ways in the Uni
versity.
Parenthetically, the Committee also sees a
need for a faculty handbook, which would in
form faculty members of such policies of ap
pointment, promotion, tenure, and administra
tive arrangement as are especially relevant to
them.
The Committee wishes, moreover, that Cour
ses and I)egre<>s might he improved. The in
formation in it is frequently obsolete before
the book comes off the press. Might there not
be in the den of someone at Stanford printing
methods that could reduce the lag between
copy deadlines and publication? Would the
improvement of accuracy allowed by an Aug
ust publication date outweigh the advantage
for incoming students of the present May pub
lication? Students and advisers alike now hesi
tate to use Courses and Degrees as a basis
for planning the work of even a single year in
advance. The Committee wonders, then, wheth
er usefulness for planning to those already
here should not have priority over usefulness
for those about to come. In the light of the in
creasing need for advanced academic planning
by students, greater accuracy becomes even
more desirable. Moreover, if Courses and De
grees wore improved and up-dated, the expense
of the quarterly Time Schedule might be re
duced by making it no more than a supple
ment to Courses and Degrees.
All of these publications would bo of im
mense help to advisers and their advisees. The
Committee is of the opinion that the adviser's
function should not be to disseminate informa
tion that the student can more readily receive
otherwise. In saying that, we take full cog
nizance of the high likelihood that anything in
print will be misunderstood, misconstrued, or
misused somewhere by someone. Where the
adviser perceives ignorance, he must, of
course, rectify itâ€”and the student may do the
same. The adviser will function well with an
advisee when both have the necessary infor
mation, for then the adviser is free to advise
instead of merely to inform.
Concomitantly, the Committee believes that
the adviser should be relieved of policing cur
ricular regulations. So much of academic ad
vising is taken up with routine questions about
the fulfillment of requirements (How many
units of Science have you left to take? How
much math? etc.) that time for genuine and
personalized advice is too often at a premium.
The Committee has a hunch, moreover, (1)
that on the whole students know the require
ments in General Studies and in major pro
grams better than their advisers do, and (2)
that students almost always know exactly
where they stand with regard to those require
ments. The Committee wonders about the feas
ibility of computerizing information of these
kinds to enable easy retrieval. If machines can
free us for the improvement of our humanity,
we should by all means use them.
In short, the Committee believes that advis
ing could be far better focussed on advice if
the dissemination of information were both
simplified and improved, so that the adviser
does not have to be a traffic cop of regulations.
11. Availability
of Counseling
For clarity of terminology, we use the term
"counseling" to mean the impartation of help
for problems of a personal sort, not immediate
ly involving the academic, while "advising" is
restricted in this paper to academic advice.
It is certainly the case that a great deal of
counseling in this sense occurs in any commu
nity as large and as complex as Stanford. Most
of it is casual, among close friends, and with
no pretense of professional expertise. This
sort of counseling will happen whether the
institution encourages or discourages it. Any
attempt to structure such relationships is, of
course, doomed to failure. Faculty members
also do a great deal of counseling of this kind.
Though some may criticize the non-profession
al nature of such counseling, that may in itself
bo one of the'strengths of the relationship. At
the same time, situations frequently arise
where professional counseling is needed and
any casual counselor should always have in
mind the possibility of referring someone to
sources of professional aid. The Committee has
not conceived of any way by which faculty or
other such occasional counselors might cus
tomarily be taught how to recognize danger
signals, but they should be aware of an obli
gation to suggest referral.
Nevertheless, sources of professional coun
seling are present at Stanford, and the Com
mittee has been surprise that some members
of the University, both faculty and students,
seem unaware of them. Apart from the coun
seling done in residences < faculty residents,
residence directors, resident assistants, tutors,
and sponsors), which would have to be called
at best semi-professional, counseling done by
campus religious representatives, and that
done in special circumstances by persons in
the Dean of Students' office, the University
maintains two major sources of professional
counseling and a third that might become one.
We refer in the first instance to the Counsel
ing and Testing Center and to the psychiatric
services of the Cowell Health Center, and in
the second instance to the Placement Service.
The Counseling and Testing Center provides
psychological testing of many kinds and both
short-range and long-range psychological coun
seling. The psychiatric staff of the Cowell
Health Center is available for psychiatric con
sultation and some forms of therapy, and pa
tients in need of long-range therapy are re
ferred to psychiatrists in the School of Medi
cine for it.
The Committee has no wish to enter into the
relative merits of these two approaches, be
lieving that both meet various kinds of situ
ations helpfully. The liaison between the Conn

soling and Testing Center and the Cowell
Health reportedly good and getting
better. Such liaison and cooperation should be
encouraged by the University administration.
The fact that a relatively small proportion of
Stanford students uses the counseling services
in these two institutions may be an index of
the community's relatively healthy mental
state. On the other hand, experience hÂ°re and
in other universities would seem to indicate
that there are many more problems than are
actually met by these services. Larger staffs
would doubtless encourage more students with
real problems to seek aid.
It has been rightly observed that while any
person lacks the medical or psychological
help he needs, the job of counseling is not be
ing properly done. One of our faculty col
leagues recently stated that "One student sui
cide per year is one too many," a sentiment
with which no one could quarrel. But preven
tion in the realm of counseling is the most
difficult task. For one thing, it requires the
willing cooperation of the patient or subject.
The continued excellence and improvement
of these two services seems to the Committee,
however, a matter of rather high priority. We
are in a period where the mental strains upon
the age group of Stanford students are great
and on the increase. It is no pampering mood
that leads to the conclusion that professional
aid is needed; it is rather the sense of urgency
that informs higher education, and the wish
that barriers to the best education every stu
dent is capable of absorbing be as far as possi
ble thrown down. We do not believe that the
improvement of, say, the Counseling and Test
ing Center is more important than the im
provement of the faculty. But believing in the
priority of the academic, we wish it to be aided
by the best medical and psychological services
Stanford can afford to render.
We have few specific recommendations,
apart from general improvementâ€”which In
itself ought not to be taken as underhanded
criticism. The first contact with the Counsel
ing and Testing Center ought to make clear
to entering students that genuine personal
counsel may be had there. We are dubious
that the orientation-week testing is a good in
troduction for students, valuable as the re
sults may be for staff research. The counsel
ing function should be made more distinct
from that of legitimate research.
The most difficult question with which the
Committee has long wrestled is how to be
sure that the people who need the help receive
it. To that question, we have no satisfactory
answer. The availability of the services should
b" widely publicized and accurately described.
Every member of the University should know
about them. But the person who refuses to
seek help when he needs it can not, by any
means the Committee has been able to discov
er, be forced to have it.
The Committee notes with satisfaction the
recent improvements in the situation of reli
gious ministries on the campus. Although not
every religious tradition is officially repre
sented, persons desiring counseling of a reli
gious sort have access to a broad range of
clergymen and denominational representatives.
Since campus office space was made available
to denominational representatives, the work
of the Pean of the Chapel and his assistant
and of the University Chaplain has been en
larged by cooperation. To those who doubt the
propriety of the presence of clergymen on a
university campus, the Committee would say
that the day when religious bodies looked on
the ministry to students as a salvage operation
from the godless university is long past. Safe
guards against irresponsibility in this as in
other areas of interest can be established ad
ministratively. Those members of the Univer
sity who find religious counsel helpful and nec
essary can and do seek it out.
By virtue of the fact that Selective Service
is of immediate concern to the majority of
Stanford students, the Committee has consid
ered advising facilities offered regarding the
draft. A National Service Adviser has for
some time been available. The Committee ap
plauds the addition of a counselor on con
scientious objection to the student facilities
available on campus. We anticipate that such
an office will be continued while the question
of the draft is pertinent, and suggest that the
amount of student need for such counsel re
quires the availability of more time than is
now provided. The different natures of the
counseling involved makes it advisable to keep
separate the conscientious objection counsel
ing and National Service advising. Greater co
ordination of the latter with the ROTC offices
and the Placement Service would facilitate the
answering of questions faced by many stu
dents in regard to the options available for
fulfillment of military service. However, the
effectiveness of both offices is hampered at
present by lack of information reaching the
student. Publicizing these services in the hand
book to the University proposed above, and by
whatever means are now available, and the
initiation of orientation sessions with tutors,
residence assistants, and directors may begin
to alleviate this inadequacy.
The Placement Service is kept until last be
cause the Committee believes substantial ex
pansion is possible and desirable. At present
the Placement Service is a means to bring
prospective employees into contact with pros
pective employers and to aid students to re
ceive part-time and summer jobs. With ex
pense (the Committee does not wish to guess
how much* and reorganization, the Placement
Service could become a Career Guidance Cen
ter. This change would put job interviews into
perspective as aspects of a more thorough in
vestigation by the individual of his wishes and
talents for a career. Facilities for aptitude
tests of various kinds would be needed, as well
as staff to process and counsel regarding such
tests. For this purpose, it would he well to
shift the efforts in career counseling now car
ried on by the Counseling and Testing Center
to an expanded Career Guidance Center. Infor

mation on opportunities and requisites for ca
reers of many kinds could conveniently be
gathered and sometimes produced by a Career
Guidance Center, and one might expect to find
in it the current catalogues of graduate and
professional schools across the country.
It has often been remarked that, for all the
Founders' desires that a Stanford education
should fit students for useful pursuits, the ac
cessibility of career counsel is rather slim
hÂ°re. In feeling that the situation bears im
provement the Committee does not imply that
every student should have made a clear voca
tional choice by the end of his senior year. But
students wishing to make informed and ra
tional choices of careers should have access as
early as possible to information and individual
ized counsel regarding the options. A Career
Guidance Center might have the contacts to
place students in part-time and temporary
jobs with persons in careers that the students
are considering, experience which might be
invaluable whether it be positive or negative.
Other methods of gaining insight into vari
ous kinds of professional life may likewise
gain momentum. A proposal now being con
sidered suggests the establishment of sopho
more and higher level courses on the profes
sions, taught from the perspectives of both
the humanities and the social sciences. Such
courses would be informational and descriptive
and in no sense recruitment techniques. Still
other means might be found to make available
for students bases for wise career decisions.
The present admirable advising done by facul
ty members of the School of Medicine with
and for pre-medical students could profitably
be emulated elsewhere. Could not the Schools
of Law, Business, and Education, for example,
provide similar counsel in cooperation with a
Career Guidance Center? The Committee pre
sumes that remuneration occupations will for
some time be necessary for most members of
American society. There is point, therefore, to
the thought that education can be useful, even
though that is far from being the whole point
of education.
111. Academic
Advising
If personal counseling is very largely done
casually and by amateurs, so is academic ad
vising. Most of the advising done at Stanford
is done by one undergraduate to another. The
Committee heartily approves this state of af
fairs at the same time that it is not satisfied
to abandon faculty advising.
Student Advising. Several aspects of under
graduate advising are carried by undergradu
ates. Students get their best information about
the value of specific courses from other stu
dents who have taken them. This is only natu
ral. Faculty members are loath to comment
on their colleagues, for reasons of professional
propriety; students are not. Moreover, faculty
members can talk about courses taught by
their colleagues only by hearsay, where stu
dents can speak at first hand. Such informal
advising is valuable, even though it is fre
quently biased. Sporadic attempts have been
made to bring it usefully into published form,
with such documents as the Course Review,
succeeding the earlier "Scratch Sheet." The
Committee applauds the concept of a student
Course Review as a valuable asset to advising,
and wishes that it might be thorough in its
coverage of courses, representative of a varie
ty of student reactions, and sensitive to stated
aims of professors in courses. Such a review
would also inform professors helpfully about
responses to the courses. The Course Review
ought to appear regularly, with cooperation
and financial assistance from the University
but without administrative control.
A recent experiment in appointing students
as advisers-at-large in their major departments
produced uncertain results. The fault may lie
partially in a lack of information about the
program, in student suspicion that student
advisers would be "administration types," in
students' feelings that they could get as good
advice from their friendsâ€”or in any possible
combination of those and other factors. The
Committee is not satisfied that student de
partmental advising is a bad idea, especially
on the basis of one year's experiment in three
departments. It exhorts departments and
schools to keep trying to find ways of taking
advantage of students' advising abilities.
The function of the adviser. We have already
expressed the Committee's suggestion that ad
vising not be simply a matter of policing, of
making sure that the student has information
and is taking the courses he is required to
take. The Adviser's Handbook describes the
goal of advising as bringing "the student to
the point where he can assume a maximum
amount of responsibility for his own academic
program and can make wise decisions on his
own" (p. 12). The Committee wishes to go be
yond that to propose that the adviser be
viewed both by the student and by himself as
the student's academic advocate, the particular
educator who agrees to concern himself with
his advisee's best education. This means prin
cipally that the adviser wishes to help the
student plan an educational career that goes
somewhere, that has coherence and point to it,
rather than being a miscellaneous collection
of requirements and aimless electives. If the
adviser is the student's advocate, however, this
coherence must be a means of enabling the
student's wishes and strengths to be embodied
in his program, not a way for the adviser to
impose his own concepts on the student.
Such a concept would, to he sure, produce
advising that takes more time, for carefully
considering with a student his academic ob
jectives and intellectual curiosities consumes
more time that simply signing his card. But if
such advising is understood and underscored
by tin 1 faculty as integral 1o education, faculty
members may more happily engage in it. It

poses several problems, among which is the
acceptance of advising as a normal aspect of
academic appointment at Stanford. If such
advising will not be done by the faculty, some
one must do it. In the absence of good faculty
advising, a corps of professional advisers
would probably have to be retained to the dam
age of the budget and of the academic exper
tise with which advising ought to be done. On
all counts, the Committee emphatically prefers
faculty advising.
The student's stake in advising. A curious
duality is sometimes to be observed among
students. On the one hand, they firmly ob
ject to be treated as ciphers or as children by
an institution standing in loco parentis. On
the other .they wish the advice of their elders
among the faculty, and this wish is sometimes
Indistinguishable from a desire for a parent
surrogate. Occasionally, when the advice given
is not to an individual's liking, he will pro
test that he is not being respected. We point
this out in part to say that the students' own
view of their stake in advising is not crystal
clear.
Although the student knows more about
himself than any adviser is ever likely to
know, he needs advising because he has not
enough experience of education to know pre
cisely how to join his interests and talents
to a curricular regimen. This observation ap
plies equally, though in different perspectives,
to undergraduates and graduate students. The
student looks to an adviser for guidance in
pursuing an education that will take ad
vantage of his interests and lead him beyond
his own provincial boundaries, at the same
time that it is certifiable by the University as
meeting its standards. The University, of
course, must determine what those standards
are, since it is the body doing the certifying.
The adviser stands toward the student in the
peculiar position of being at once a represen
tative of the University's power of sanction
upon the student (he makes judgments on stu
dents' performance) and and the advocate of
that particula student in the acquisition of his
most effective education.
If the structure of degree requirements on
the graduate level becomes less prescriptive,
the premium on interested advising which
aids the student toward coherence as well as
adventuresomeness will rise. Experience will
count for much in a student's planning, al
though it should not be prescriptively applied.
What is at stake for the student in a more flex
ible under-graduate program is precisely the
humanity of an adviser who is genuinely the
student's educational advocate. If the program
is flexible, advocacy need not consist in find
ing ways to circumvent regulations.
The levels of advising and their problems.
Special and different problems of advising ob
tain for freshmen, transfers, upperclass un
dergraduates and departmental majors, and
graduate students. At the same time, the Com
mittee is convinced of one true observation:
the best advising takes place where advisee
and adviser have some kind of common bond,
beyond the routine. This may be the bond of
the same field of study (the normal pre-set
bond between graduate students and faculty),
some common experience (frequently that the
student has taken the faculty member's
course), or prior acquaintance.
From this standpoint, the advising of fresh
men is the most difficult task, for freshmen
rarely have any existing bond to a faculty
member. It must be established. The Commit
tee has been divided upon several possible ways
to handle freshman advising. That the faculty
should carry the bulk of the advising seems
wise, yet a student's assigned adviser only
rarely turns out to be important or helpful
to him. As the freshman year curriculum now
stands, freshmen rarely come into close con
tact with faculty members, except those al
-most as transient as themselves: English
TA's, Western Civ instructors, lab TA's, and
beginning math and language TA's. The In
crease of Freshman seminars may improve
the range of faculty contact. The plans of
assigning advisers to groups in living units
has been extremely spotty in its effectiveness,
and it suffers from the fact that the advisers
remain abstractly faculty members, rather
than being perceived in their active teaching
roles. Relationships of freshman to faculty
residents or directors of living units, to tutors,
and to sponsors are relatively close, and these
persons in fact do the bulk of freshman ad
vising. The Trancos experiment is one possible
model of freshman advising, where residence
director, sponsors and tutors, and a team of
faculty advisers work closely together. Fresh
man advising ought to aid in the orientation
of the entering student, j.etting him off on the
right foot, proposing seriously that he identify
areas of genuine intellectual interest. Such
advising should prepare the student to find
a permanent academic adviser as he goes.
The Committee is unanimous in suggesting
that advising will become more effective from
all sides if the student ultimately chooses his
own adviser. In fact this frequently happens
now, except that the adviser whom the stu
dent chooses is often not the one responsible
for signing his card. We see the following
arguments in favor of this idea: 1. The stu
dent will most likely choose a faculty mem
ber whom he has seen in action, knows some
thing of his qualities and the "cut of his jib."
2. Such a relationship would underscore the
obligation of both student and adviser for
tion in which the student is interested and
tion In which the student is interested an
which makes coherent academic sense of his
interests and career plans. (The Committee
believes, parenthetically, that changing ad
visers and programs ought to be quite easy,
with no prejudice attached to it.) 3. If the
structure of the freshman year becomes less
prescribed, freshmen will have access to a
broader range of course options and of faculty
members than is now the case and will be
more likely to identify someone with whom
they believe they can work.
Certain problems with this arrangement can
be foreseen. 1. Some very popular professors
will be swamped with advisees, and other fac
ulty members will have few or none. To this
the Committee would propose that limitations
on the number of advisees per faculty member
be administratively established (see below.) 2.
Understaffed departments will have too many
majors to observe the limitations, and will have
to continue assigning majors to advisers. To
this the Committee proposes that the student's
adviser need not, though he may, be in the stu
dent's own major department. If the adviser is
not charged to keep track of regulations, it is
not at all unlikely that a professor in one de
partment can help a student in another to pur
sue a course that both meets the standards laid
down by the department and satisfies the stu
dent's own academic needs and wants. Depart
ments might require countersignature of study
cards by departmental representatives. Any
student seriously wishing to become a his
torian, for example, will probably try to find
a historian as adviser in order to get help in
preparing to be like him. We recognize that
in some programs, e.g. Philosophy and the
Honors Program in Humanities, the adviser
docs considerable tutoring of the student in
his senior year. This does not seem to us in
compatible with the basic premise. We are in
clined, on the undergraduate level, to resist
departmental "imperialism," which demands
control over "its" students. An undergraduate
major need not, after all, be occupational prep
aration, but, especially in the Humanities and
Social Sciences, is rather a point of co
herence for one's entire liberal education. Stu
dents who wish strong identification with a
discipline or department may gain it by choos
ing advisers there. Students who do not want
such a concentration may be well served by
advisers from almost anywhere in the Uni
versity.
Such a plan would introduce a differentia
tion between freshman and upperclass advis
ing, in place of the present differentiation be
tween General Studies and major advising.
The Committee is inclined to believe that the
former differentiation would make all advis
ing more effective with regard to general ed
ucation. We are not yet agreed as to the time
when a student must have chosen his adviser.
Some might stay with the person to whom they
were assigned as freshmen; others would find
an adviser during the freshman year; still
others during the sophomore year. Some stu
dents might have three or four different ad
visers during their careers. We see no compel
ing reason why that should be forbidden,
though frequent changes may be a signal that
counseling of some kind is needed. As at pres
ent, students will continue to seek out advice
from faculty members whom they like and
trust, no matter who is the officially designated
adviser. The present suggestion is intended to
take advantage of that fact of life.
The advising of graduate students might
seem to be self-evident. No one except grad
uate students themselves seems to feel it a
problem. Some responsibilities which many

departments seem not to handle well with
graduate students are the following: (1) intro
ducing new students to the University; (2) in
forming students about and channeling them,
when need is present, to the Counseling and
Testing Center, Cowell Halth Service, the
Placement Service, etc.; (3) giving students
vocational advice and sometimes placing them;
(4) informing new students about housing pos
sibilities and problems; (5) informing students
about useful training obtainable on a reg
ular basis in other departments. The pro
blem here is different from that of under
graduates in that the graduate student is
earnestly in the process of professional prep
aration. There is a certain emulative aspect to
graduate study, therefore, because many grad
uate students (certainly not nearly 100%) are
working with people with whom they expect
ultimately to become colleagues. It seems to
us probable that at present graduate students
select their own advisers to an extent that un
dergraduate do not. The function of faculty in
attracting graduate students to any university
assures that the potential of full relationships
is present. A stronger administrative surveil
lance of graduate advising might help to over
come the deficiences of individual departments.
Some special problems. Three groups of stu
dents present special problems to which the
Committee does not yet have answers. It is
clear that transfer students could use far bet
ter help on arrival than most of them get. It is
also clear that their problems are different
from those faced by freshman. We believe that
transfer students should bo given high priority
for on-campus housing. It also seems to us
that the evaluation of transfer credits could
be expedited and improved in many ways.
Some faculty members might be especially en
couraged to handle transfer students. We de
sire further suggestions about the advising of
transfer students from anyone with ideas to
give.
Another group of students with problems to
which the Committee has not yet given
sufficient attention is foreign students. The
Beehtel International Center is a source of
remarkably fine personal attention to foreign
students. But this group has academic prob
lems peculiarly their own, and some made of
advising needs, we think, to be tailored to
them. Again, the Committee wishes to be
helped by ideas.
The third group is comprised of members
of minorities with special disadvantages. Ad
vising needs to have cognizance both of the
personal problems faced by such students and
of academic needs. Efforts to provide tutoring
from the Office of Financial Aids have been
sporadic, due largely to stringently limited
funds. Some more formal program of tutoring
and counsel would greatly increase the accessi
bility of an adequate Stanford education for
such students. Stanford has publicly stated its
intention to do the right thing by these per
sons. Additional support, morally and mone
tarily, needs to be provided.
The extent and rewards of advising. The
Committee believes that advising on all levels
should be taken together in figuring the aver
age ratio of advisees to advisers. Taking fig
ures in the fall Student Directory as sub

stantially correct for numbers of majors and
graduate students in the Schools and Depart
ments, and taking a count of faculty at As
sistant Professor or higher in Courses and De
grees as substantially correct (realizing that
many people in the latter are absent on leave),
and assuming that all of those faculty advise
majors and graduate students, we find the fol
lowing ratios by schools of major and grad
uate advisees to advisers:
Earth Sciences 5.8 (169/29)
Engineering 13.4 (2114A58)
Humanities & Sciences 11.7 (4739/405)
The figures for present General Studies ad
vising, however, look rather different. 115
persons are engaged in 1967-68 in General
Studies advising of 2330 students without de
clared majors, a ratio of 20.2G advisees to each
adviser. Sources of General Studies advisers
are as follows:
Earth Sciences 7 (24% of
school faculty)
Engineering 11 (6.9% of
school faculty)
Humanities & Sciences 45 (11.1% of
school faculty)
Medicine 12
Military Science 2
Physical Education 3
Education 2
Administration 33
The figures show the difficulties encountered
by the Registrar in his task of recruiting
General Studies Advisers. Only 63 ( 54.8%) of
present General Studies advisers come from
the faculties of Schools which will enroll the
advisees as majors. Moreover, only 39% of
General Studies advisers come from the School
of Humanities and Sciences, which can rea
sonably expect to enroll about 80% of un
dergraduates.
At the same time, figures received from De
partments of the School of Humanities and
Sciences show a very wide variation in the
actual advising practice of departments. Some
departments average as few as 4 departmental
advisees per adviser, whereas members of
others may have as many as 66 major ad
visees. Such a figure seems to the Committee
a mockery of the very idea of advising.
One can be only routine with that many ad
visees. The Committee is inclined to believe
that an upper limit on the number of allowable
advisees per adviser should be set, perhaps at
25 or 30, such a figure to include both grad
uate and undergraduate students. The Com
mittee also believes that Deans should ask
executive hads of departments quite search
ing questions about provisions for carrying
advising when many members of a depart
ment propose to be on leave for a given year.
One instance has been reported in which a
member of a large department finds himself
during this academic year with 89 advisees
(graduate, undergraduate major, and Gen
eral Studies) because so many of his col
league are absent on leave. If a limit on ad
visees were set and adhered to, such ex
ploitation would not be permitted.
The Committee has thought very hard about
the place of advising in Stanford's status and
reward system for its faculty. At present, save

for one department that claims to adjust Its
teaching loads in proportion to advising loads,
advising is in fact extra-curricular, in that
it is supposed to be done but no one pays
much attention if it is not done. The Commit
tee is informed that advisers receive extra
pay in some universities, and it has discussed
whether bonus pay would be an incentive to
better advising. We are not satisfied that it
would. We have also asked how a faculty
member's advising effectiveness might be a
factor in his promotion and salary increment.
Nothing would please the Committee more
than to be shown a method of accurate evalua
tion of this effectiveness, so that it could be
used as one among other determinants. We
have yet to find a method. Even if the stu
dent were to choose his adviser, one could not
determine the adviser's effectiveness merely
by counting the number of his advisees.
The Committee believes that advising will
be able to play a role in the status and re
ward system only if the faculty becomes so
committed to the advising function (which,
for the Committee, is integral to the educa
tional function) that the very commitment
produces a means of reward. The faculty
must decide that advising is important, and
the faculty at large must expend some energy
in advising. Pressure probably ought to be
exerted on those of our colleagues who would
rather not advise students, although the very
reluctant adviser will likely not be a very
good one. Perhaps, in considerations of reward
and promotion, nothing more than a negative
question can be asked. If a brilliant research
er does no advising, can his research contribu
tions outweigh the absence of his contribu
tion to the University's humanity? In some in
stances, the answer might have to be "No."
So far as the Committee knows, the question
has never been asked.
Advising in the professor's profession. The
Committee has expressed its conviction that
advising students is properly a part of the
educational profession, that such an as
sumption ought if possible to be an element
in consideration of reward. We suggest, more
over, that prospective faculty appointees be
informed of advising obligations of Stanford
faculty members. We would also suggest a
more long-range way of achieving the actuality
of this assumption. It has often been pointed
out that among the weakest aspects of grad
uate education today is the failure to prepare
people for their profession. Graduate students
are trained to do research, but many of them
are hired to be teachers and members of fac
ulties. We do not wish to underplay research.
But too little is done to train those of our grad
uate students who will become teachers for
their actual professional functions. The Com
mittee suggests the advisability of instruc
tion for graduate students in the scope of the
objectives and responsibilities of their chosen
profession, which will help them comprehend
the expectations under which they will work.
Such instruction could go a long way toward
making actual the ideal that professors are
engaged in education, an activity that includes
research and publication, classroom teach
ing, and the education of individual students
outside of formal instruction that advising
ought to be. When education in that sense be
comes the basic assumption of the University's

life, we will be on the way toward the fulfill
ment of our humanity.

Epilogue:
Enablement and
Surveillance
It is hoped that in such a relatively casual
and self selecting system as that proposed
above, the quiet and unspectacular job that
needs to be done will proceed. But responsibili
ty for watching it must be lodged somewhere
more specific than in the hearts and minds of
the 20,000-odd souls of the Stanford commun
ity. There needs to be improved liaison among
agencies, assurance that stated functions are
being fulfilled, exhortation if not pressure
for participation in both given and receiving.
It was suggested, half jocularly, in the Com
mittee that what is wanted is a "University
humane ofTice.'The term is simplistic, but the
thought is precise. To indicate, to itself and
everyone else, that Stanford means its hu
manity, the responsibility should be assumed
by a highly placed officer, of at least Associate
Provost rank, whose responsibilities would in
clude the coordination of advising and coun
seling structures.
The Committee remains uncertain whether
the responsibility should be added to those
carried by the Dean of Students, whether it
should be assigned to a Dean of Undergraduate
Educationâ€”should such a position be rein
statedâ€”or whether a new position should be
created. In favor of the first is the fact that
the Dean of Students is now responsible for
several agencies in which counseling and ad
vising take place. On the other hand, the ed
ucational thrust of the entire program might
suggest that the responsibility be held by a
distinctly academic officer such as a Dean of
Undergraduate Education. At the same time,
the fact that advising and counseling must af
fect graduate as well as undergraduate stu
dents makes desirable that the officer not be
exclusively occupied with undergraduates.
Whoever such a person might be, and what
ever his title, he must be accessible to and
trustable by students, command the respect
and attract the cooperation of the faculty, and
display remarkable virtues to non-academic
staff persons.

This paper is presented to the University
community by the Committee on Advising and
Couast'lint; of the Study of Education at Stan
ford. It is important to say tliat the paper is
intended not as a recommendation for immedi
ate decision hut as some proposals for discus
sion.
Hearings will take place 7 9 p.m. Tuesday
and 4-fi p.m. Wednesday in room 143 of Meyer
Library. Members of the committee will be
present to receive comments on the paper. The
Committee also welcomes written responses to
the SES office, Meyer Library.
Few subjects are so frequently the target of
criticism as advising, few so rarely the object
of constructive suggestion. Widespread agree
ment thai advising is not very well done at
Stanford is equalled by imprecision as to the
problem and feasible solutions. Our realism
breeds cynicism, concluding that we must ac
cept inadequacy.
The Committee on Advising and Counseling
of the Study of Education at Stanford has at
tempted to be realistic but not cynical. Mow
ever unlikely the radical alteration of human
nature may be, the alteration of perspectives
and priorities is well within our reach. The
Committee urges the University's members,
however, that unless assumptions are modi
fied the cynics will he proven right. Foremost
among the assumptions that require adjust
ment is the tacit one that for a faculty mem
ber advising is an extracurricular activity.
This assumption produces hesitance on the
part of many students to consult advisers ex
cept for routine card-signing for fear of "tak
ing up his time," and their resultant complaint
that advising at Stanford is nothing but rou
tine. It produces the perception on the part of
faculty members that advising, except for one's
"own" special (preferably graduate) students,
is a chore to be avoided if possible and to be
disposed of quickly if avoidance is not possible.
It produces among administrators complete ig
norance of inequities in advising loads and the
ignoring of the function of advising in con
siderations of appointment, promotion, and re
ward.
The Committee is not so blindered as to sup
pose that advising is the most important as
pect of university life. But it is sensitive to
the penetration of aspects of advising into al
most everything Stanford does, from admis
sions to residence policy to undergraduate and
graduate curriculum to student services to the
extra-curriculum to placement and vocational
decisions. In what follows we have made some
assumption that bear explication. First, we
suppose that advising has basically to do with
the possibility of significant relations and com
munication between persons, that it sums up
what we intend by our sub-title: "the humani
ty of the University." Second, we assume that
the educational direction Stanford is taking
will entail more advising, not less, on both
graduate and undergraduate levels, and a high
er degree of humanity, not a lower. Third, we
assume that, since no system is perfect, an ar
rangement of advising that allows several
quite different forms and structures of advis
ing to take place will come closer to self-re
newal than a single, potentially rigid system.
The problem, as we presently see it, has
three points of focus: 1. the dissemination to
everyone who needs it of accurate and com
plete information; 2. the availability to anyone
who needs it of competent professional coun
seling; 3. the accessibility to all students of
Interested and personal academic advice.
I. Dissemination
of Information
The story about the man who did not have
enough information to take instruction is rele
vant to the problem of advising. The Commit
tee believes that adequate and accurate infor
mation on most matters regarding the Univer
sity is readily available to those who wish and
need to have it. Ignorance and misinformation
are widespread, however, some of it difficult
to understand.
The information that needs dissemination is
that which makes possible (1) awareness on
the part of faculty and students alike of exact
ly what the University's communal and aca
demic facilities are; (2) access by members of
the University to the various services provid
ed; (3) informed decisions about academic
matters on the part of students.
A great deal of this information can be and
is conveyed in print, but people forget things
when they read them in almost unnumerable
bulletins, pamphlets, brochures, hand-bills, mi
meographed or dittoed sheets, and the like.
The variety is compounded by the fact that
certain published materials are factual in na
ture and others are more propagandists in
tone and purpose, by the fact that some infor
mation is obsolete before it is ever printed and
some is incomplete.
The Committee suggests basic simplification
into two yearly publications. One is an expand
ed version of the present rather slim Informa
tion Bulletin, to serve as a more general hand
book to the University. Here should be de
tailed information on matters not covered in
Courses and Degrees: fees and expenses, resi
dences, relatively permanent organizations and
activities both student and University-wide,
services available to the community such as
those of the Health Service, the Counseling
and Testing Center, the Bechtel International
Center, and others. Also in such a handbook
might be found brief descriptions of the ad
ministrative operation of the University, the
duties and powers of its various officers, and
policies affecting various of its members.
Through such a publication, which should be
routinely in the hands of everyone, both stu
dents and faculty could find how to get help
for all kinds of problems. New students and
new faculty members in particular would, with

its aid, more easily find their ways in the Uni
versity.
Parenthetically, the Committee also sees a
need for a faculty handbook, which would in
form faculty members of such policies of ap
pointment, promotion, tenure, and administra
tive arrangement as are especially relevant to
them.
The Committee wishes, moreover, that Cour
ses and I)egre<>s might he improved. The in
formation in it is frequently obsolete before
the book comes off the press. Might there not
be in the den of someone at Stanford printing
methods that could reduce the lag between
copy deadlines and publication? Would the
improvement of accuracy allowed by an Aug
ust publication date outweigh the advantage
for incoming students of the present May pub
lication? Students and advisers alike now hesi
tate to use Courses and Degrees as a basis
for planning the work of even a single year in
advance. The Committee wonders, then, wheth
er usefulness for planning to those already
here should not have priority over usefulness
for those about to come. In the light of the in
creasing need for advanced academic planning
by students, greater accuracy becomes even
more desirable. Moreover, if Courses and De
grees wore improved and up-dated, the expense
of the quarterly Time Schedule might be re
duced by making it no more than a supple
ment to Courses and Degrees.
All of these publications would bo of im
mense help to advisers and their advisees. The
Committee is of the opinion that the adviser's
function should not be to disseminate informa
tion that the student can more readily receive
otherwise. In saying that, we take full cog
nizance of the high likelihood that anything in
print will be misunderstood, misconstrued, or
misused somewhere by someone. Where the
adviser perceives ignorance, he must, of
course, rectify itâ€”and the student may do the
same. The adviser will function well with an
advisee when both have the necessary infor
mation, for then the adviser is free to advise
instead of merely to inform.
Concomitantly, the Committee believes that
the adviser should be relieved of policing cur
ricular regulations. So much of academic ad
vising is taken up with routine questions about
the fulfillment of requirements (How many
units of Science have you left to take? How
much math? etc.) that time for genuine and
personalized advice is too often at a premium.
The Committee has a hunch, moreover, (1)
that on the whole students know the require
ments in General Studies and in major pro
grams better than their advisers do, and (2)
that students almost always know exactly
where they stand with regard to those require
ments. The Committee wonders about the feas
ibility of computerizing information of these
kinds to enable easy retrieval. If machines can
free us for the improvement of our humanity,
we should by all means use them.
In short, the Committee believes that advis
ing could be far better focussed on advice if
the dissemination of information were both
simplified and improved, so that the adviser
does not have to be a traffic cop of regulations.
11. Availability
of Counseling
For clarity of terminology, we use the term
"counseling" to mean the impartation of help
for problems of a personal sort, not immediate
ly involving the academic, while "advising" is
restricted in this paper to academic advice.
It is certainly the case that a great deal of
counseling in this sense occurs in any commu
nity as large and as complex as Stanford. Most
of it is casual, among close friends, and with
no pretense of professional expertise. This
sort of counseling will happen whether the
institution encourages or discourages it. Any
attempt to structure such relationships is, of
course, doomed to failure. Faculty members
also do a great deal of counseling of this kind.
Though some may criticize the non-profession
al nature of such counseling, that may in itself
bo one of the'strengths of the relationship. At
the same time, situations frequently arise
where professional counseling is needed and
any casual counselor should always have in
mind the possibility of referring someone to
sources of professional aid. The Committee has
not conceived of any way by which faculty or
other such occasional counselors might cus
tomarily be taught how to recognize danger
signals, but they should be aware of an obli
gation to suggest referral.
Nevertheless, sources of professional coun
seling are present at Stanford, and the Com
mittee has been surprise that some members
of the University, both faculty and students,
seem unaware of them. Apart from the coun
seling done in residences < faculty residents,
residence directors, resident assistants, tutors,
and sponsors), which would have to be called
at best semi-professional, counseling done by
campus religious representatives, and that
done in special circumstances by persons in
the Dean of Students' office, the University
maintains two major sources of professional
counseling and a third that might become one.
We refer in the first instance to the Counsel
ing and Testing Center and to the psychiatric
services of the Cowell Health Center, and in
the second instance to the Placement Service.
The Counseling and Testing Center provides
psychological testing of many kinds and both
short-range and long-range psychological coun
seling. The psychiatric staff of the Cowell
Health Center is available for psychiatric con
sultation and some forms of therapy, and pa
tients in need of long-range therapy are re
ferred to psychiatrists in the School of Medi
cine for it.
The Committee has no wish to enter into the
relative merits of these two approaches, be
lieving that both meet various kinds of situ
ations helpfully. The liaison between the Conn

soling and Testing Center and the Cowell
Health reportedly good and getting
better. Such liaison and cooperation should be
encouraged by the University administration.
The fact that a relatively small proportion of
Stanford students uses the counseling services
in these two institutions may be an index of
the community's relatively healthy mental
state. On the other hand, experience hÂ°re and
in other universities would seem to indicate
that there are many more problems than are
actually met by these services. Larger staffs
would doubtless encourage more students with
real problems to seek aid.
It has been rightly observed that while any
person lacks the medical or psychological
help he needs, the job of counseling is not be
ing properly done. One of our faculty col
leagues recently stated that "One student sui
cide per year is one too many," a sentiment
with which no one could quarrel. But preven
tion in the realm of counseling is the most
difficult task. For one thing, it requires the
willing cooperation of the patient or subject.
The continued excellence and improvement
of these two services seems to the Committee,
however, a matter of rather high priority. We
are in a period where the mental strains upon
the age group of Stanford students are great
and on the increase. It is no pampering mood
that leads to the conclusion that professional
aid is needed; it is rather the sense of urgency
that informs higher education, and the wish
that barriers to the best education every stu
dent is capable of absorbing be as far as possi
ble thrown down. We do not believe that the
improvement of, say, the Counseling and Test
ing Center is more important than the im
provement of the faculty. But believing in the
priority of the academic, we wish it to be aided
by the best medical and psychological services
Stanford can afford to render.
We have few specific recommendations,
apart from general improvementâ€”which In
itself ought not to be taken as underhanded
criticism. The first contact with the Counsel
ing and Testing Center ought to make clear
to entering students that genuine personal
counsel may be had there. We are dubious
that the orientation-week testing is a good in
troduction for students, valuable as the re
sults may be for staff research. The counsel
ing function should be made more distinct
from that of legitimate research.
The most difficult question with which the
Committee has long wrestled is how to be
sure that the people who need the help receive
it. To that question, we have no satisfactory
answer. The availability of the services should
b" widely publicized and accurately described.
Every member of the University should know
about them. But the person who refuses to
seek help when he needs it can not, by any
means the Committee has been able to discov
er, be forced to have it.
The Committee notes with satisfaction the
recent improvements in the situation of reli
gious ministries on the campus. Although not
every religious tradition is officially repre
sented, persons desiring counseling of a reli
gious sort have access to a broad range of
clergymen and denominational representatives.
Since campus office space was made available
to denominational representatives, the work
of the Pean of the Chapel and his assistant
and of the University Chaplain has been en
larged by cooperation. To those who doubt the
propriety of the presence of clergymen on a
university campus, the Committee would say
that the day when religious bodies looked on
the ministry to students as a salvage operation
from the godless university is long past. Safe
guards against irresponsibility in this as in
other areas of interest can be established ad
ministratively. Those members of the Univer
sity who find religious counsel helpful and nec
essary can and do seek it out.
By virtue of the fact that Selective Service
is of immediate concern to the majority of
Stanford students, the Committee has consid
ered advising facilities offered regarding the
draft. A National Service Adviser has for
some time been available. The Committee ap
plauds the addition of a counselor on con
scientious objection to the student facilities
available on campus. We anticipate that such
an office will be continued while the question
of the draft is pertinent, and suggest that the
amount of student need for such counsel re
quires the availability of more time than is
now provided. The different natures of the
counseling involved makes it advisable to keep
separate the conscientious objection counsel
ing and National Service advising. Greater co
ordination of the latter with the ROTC offices
and the Placement Service would facilitate the
answering of questions faced by many stu
dents in regard to the options available for
fulfillment of military service. However, the
effectiveness of both offices is hampered at
present by lack of information reaching the
student. Publicizing these services in the hand
book to the University proposed above, and by
whatever means are now available, and the
initiation of orientation sessions with tutors,
residence assistants, and directors may begin
to alleviate this inadequacy.
The Placement Service is kept until last be
cause the Committee believes substantial ex
pansion is possible and desirable. At present
the Placement Service is a means to bring
prospective employees into contact with pros
pective employers and to aid students to re
ceive part-time and summer jobs. With ex
pense (the Committee does not wish to guess
how much* and reorganization, the Placement
Service could become a Career Guidance Cen
ter. This change would put job interviews into
perspective as aspects of a more thorough in
vestigation by the individual of his wishes and
talents for a career. Facilities for aptitude
tests of various kinds would be needed, as well
as staff to process and counsel regarding such
tests. For this purpose, it would he well to
shift the efforts in career counseling now car
ried on by the Counseling and Testing Center
to an expanded Career Guidance Center. Infor

mation on opportunities and requisites for ca
reers of many kinds could conveniently be
gathered and sometimes produced by a Career
Guidance Center, and one might expect to find
in it the current catalogues of graduate and
professional schools across the country.
It has often been remarked that, for all the
Founders' desires that a Stanford education
should fit students for useful pursuits, the ac
cessibility of career counsel is rather slim
hÂ°re. In feeling that the situation bears im
provement the Committee does not imply that
every student should have made a clear voca
tional choice by the end of his senior year. But
students wishing to make informed and ra
tional choices of careers should have access as
early as possible to information and individual
ized counsel regarding the options. A Career
Guidance Center might have the contacts to
place students in part-time and temporary
jobs with persons in careers that the students
are considering, experience which might be
invaluable whether it be positive or negative.
Other methods of gaining insight into vari
ous kinds of professional life may likewise
gain momentum. A proposal now being con
sidered suggests the establishment of sopho
more and higher level courses on the profes
sions, taught from the perspectives of both
the humanities and the social sciences. Such
courses would be informational and descriptive
and in no sense recruitment techniques. Still
other means might be found to make available
for students bases for wise career decisions.
The present admirable advising done by facul
ty members of the School of Medicine with
and for pre-medical students could profitably
be emulated elsewhere. Could not the Schools
of Law, Business, and Education, for example,
provide similar counsel in cooperation with a
Career Guidance Center? The Committee pre
sumes that remuneration occupations will for
some time be necessary for most members of
American society. There is point, therefore, to
the thought that education can be useful, even
though that is far from being the whole point
of education.
111. Academic
Advising
If personal counseling is very largely done
casually and by amateurs, so is academic ad
vising. Most of the advising done at Stanford
is done by one undergraduate to another. The
Committee heartily approves this state of af
fairs at the same time that it is not satisfied
to abandon faculty advising.
Student Advising. Several aspects of under
graduate advising are carried by undergradu
ates. Students get their best information about
the value of specific courses from other stu
dents who have taken them. This is only natu
ral. Faculty members are loath to comment
on their colleagues, for reasons of professional
propriety; students are not. Moreover, faculty
members can talk about courses taught by
their colleagues only by hearsay, where stu
dents can speak at first hand. Such informal
advising is valuable, even though it is fre
quently biased. Sporadic attempts have been
made to bring it usefully into published form,
with such documents as the Course Review,
succeeding the earlier "Scratch Sheet." The
Committee applauds the concept of a student
Course Review as a valuable asset to advising,
and wishes that it might be thorough in its
coverage of courses, representative of a varie
ty of student reactions, and sensitive to stated
aims of professors in courses. Such a review
would also inform professors helpfully about
responses to the courses. The Course Review
ought to appear regularly, with cooperation
and financial assistance from the University
but without administrative control.
A recent experiment in appointing students
as advisers-at-large in their major departments
produced uncertain results. The fault may lie
partially in a lack of information about the
program, in student suspicion that student
advisers would be "administration types," in
students' feelings that they could get as good
advice from their friendsâ€”or in any possible
combination of those and other factors. The
Committee is not satisfied that student de
partmental advising is a bad idea, especially
on the basis of one year's experiment in three
departments. It exhorts departments and
schools to keep trying to find ways of taking
advantage of students' advising abilities.
The function of the adviser. We have already
expressed the Committee's suggestion that ad
vising not be simply a matter of policing, of
making sure that the student has information
and is taking the courses he is required to
take. The Adviser's Handbook describes the
goal of advising as bringing "the student to
the point where he can assume a maximum
amount of responsibility for his own academic
program and can make wise decisions on his
own" (p. 12). The Committee wishes to go be
yond that to propose that the adviser be
viewed both by the student and by himself as
the student's academic advocate, the particular
educator who agrees to concern himself with
his advisee's best education. This means prin
cipally that the adviser wishes to help the
student plan an educational career that goes
somewhere, that has coherence and point to it,
rather than being a miscellaneous collection
of requirements and aimless electives. If the
adviser is the student's advocate, however, this
coherence must be a means of enabling the
student's wishes and strengths to be embodied
in his program, not a way for the adviser to
impose his own concepts on the student.
Such a concept would, to he sure, produce
advising that takes more time, for carefully
considering with a student his academic ob
jectives and intellectual curiosities consumes
more time that simply signing his card. But if
such advising is understood and underscored
by tin 1 faculty as integral 1o education, faculty
members may more happily engage in it. It

poses several problems, among which is the
acceptance of advising as a normal aspect of
academic appointment at Stanford. If such
advising will not be done by the faculty, some
one must do it. In the absence of good faculty
advising, a corps of professional advisers
would probably have to be retained to the dam
age of the budget and of the academic exper
tise with which advising ought to be done. On
all counts, the Committee emphatically prefers
faculty advising.
The student's stake in advising. A curious
duality is sometimes to be observed among
students. On the one hand, they firmly ob
ject to be treated as ciphers or as children by
an institution standing in loco parentis. On
the other .they wish the advice of their elders
among the faculty, and this wish is sometimes
Indistinguishable from a desire for a parent
surrogate. Occasionally, when the advice given
is not to an individual's liking, he will pro
test that he is not being respected. We point
this out in part to say that the students' own
view of their stake in advising is not crystal
clear.
Although the student knows more about
himself than any adviser is ever likely to
know, he needs advising because he has not
enough experience of education to know pre
cisely how to join his interests and talents
to a curricular regimen. This observation ap
plies equally, though in different perspectives,
to undergraduates and graduate students. The
student looks to an adviser for guidance in
pursuing an education that will take ad
vantage of his interests and lead him beyond
his own provincial boundaries, at the same
time that it is certifiable by the University as
meeting its standards. The University, of
course, must determine what those standards
are, since it is the body doing the certifying.
The adviser stands toward the student in the
peculiar position of being at once a represen
tative of the University's power of sanction
upon the student (he makes judgments on stu
dents' performance) and and the advocate of
that particula student in the acquisition of his
most effective education.
If the structure of degree requirements on
the graduate level becomes less prescriptive,
the premium on interested advising which
aids the student toward coherence as well as
adventuresomeness will rise. Experience will
count for much in a student's planning, al
though it should not be prescriptively applied.
What is at stake for the student in a more flex
ible under-graduate program is precisely the
humanity of an adviser who is genuinely the
student's educational advocate. If the program
is flexible, advocacy need not consist in find
ing ways to circumvent regulations.
The levels of advising and their problems.
Special and different problems of advising ob
tain for freshmen, transfers, upperclass un
dergraduates and departmental majors, and
graduate students. At the same time, the Com
mittee is convinced of one true observation:
the best advising takes place where advisee
and adviser have some kind of common bond,
beyond the routine. This may be the bond of
the same field of study (the normal pre-set
bond between graduate students and faculty),
some common experience (frequently that the
student has taken the faculty member's
course), or prior acquaintance.
From this standpoint, the advising of fresh
men is the most difficult task, for freshmen
rarely have any existing bond to a faculty
member. It must be established. The Commit
tee has been divided upon several possible ways
to handle freshman advising. That the faculty
should carry the bulk of the advising seems
wise, yet a student's assigned adviser only
rarely turns out to be important or helpful
to him. As the freshman year curriculum now
stands, freshmen rarely come into close con
tact with faculty members, except those al
-most as transient as themselves: English
TA's, Western Civ instructors, lab TA's, and
beginning math and language TA's. The In
crease of Freshman seminars may improve
the range of faculty contact. The plans of
assigning advisers to groups in living units
has been extremely spotty in its effectiveness,
and it suffers from the fact that the advisers
remain abstractly faculty members, rather
than being perceived in their active teaching
roles. Relationships of freshman to faculty
residents or directors of living units, to tutors,
and to sponsors are relatively close, and these
persons in fact do the bulk of freshman ad
vising. The Trancos experiment is one possible
model of freshman advising, where residence
director, sponsors and tutors, and a team of
faculty advisers work closely together. Fresh
man advising ought to aid in the orientation
of the entering student, j.etting him off on the
right foot, proposing seriously that he identify
areas of genuine intellectual interest. Such
advising should prepare the student to find
a permanent academic adviser as he goes.
The Committee is unanimous in suggesting
that advising will become more effective from
all sides if the student ultimately chooses his
own adviser. In fact this frequently happens
now, except that the adviser whom the stu
dent chooses is often not the one responsible
for signing his card. We see the following
arguments in favor of this idea: 1. The stu
dent will most likely choose a faculty mem
ber whom he has seen in action, knows some
thing of his qualities and the "cut of his jib."
2. Such a relationship would underscore the
obligation of both student and adviser for
tion in which the student is interested and
tion In which the student is interested an
which makes coherent academic sense of his
interests and career plans. (The Committee
believes, parenthetically, that changing ad
visers and programs ought to be quite easy,
with no prejudice attached to it.) 3. If the
structure of the freshman year becomes less
prescribed, freshmen will have access to a
broader range of course options and of faculty
members than is now the case and will be
more likely to identify someone with whom
they believe they can work.
Certain problems with this arrangement can
be foreseen. 1. Some very popular professors
will be swamped with advisees, and other fac
ulty members will have few or none. To this
the Committee would propose that limitations
on the number of advisees per faculty member
be administratively established (see below.) 2.
Understaffed departments will have too many
majors to observe the limitations, and will have
to continue assigning majors to advisers. To
this the Committee proposes that the student's
adviser need not, though he may, be in the stu
dent's own major department. If the adviser is
not charged to keep track of regulations, it is
not at all unlikely that a professor in one de
partment can help a student in another to pur
sue a course that both meets the standards laid
down by the department and satisfies the stu
dent's own academic needs and wants. Depart
ments might require countersignature of study
cards by departmental representatives. Any
student seriously wishing to become a his
torian, for example, will probably try to find
a historian as adviser in order to get help in
preparing to be like him. We recognize that
in some programs, e.g. Philosophy and the
Honors Program in Humanities, the adviser
docs considerable tutoring of the student in
his senior year. This does not seem to us in
compatible with the basic premise. We are in
clined, on the undergraduate level, to resist
departmental "imperialism," which demands
control over "its" students. An undergraduate
major need not, after all, be occupational prep
aration, but, especially in the Humanities and
Social Sciences, is rather a point of co
herence for one's entire liberal education. Stu
dents who wish strong identification with a
discipline or department may gain it by choos
ing advisers there. Students who do not want
such a concentration may be well served by
advisers from almost anywhere in the Uni
versity.
Such a plan would introduce a differentia
tion between freshman and upperclass advis
ing, in place of the present differentiation be
tween General Studies and major advising.
The Committee is inclined to believe that the
former differentiation would make all advis
ing more effective with regard to general ed
ucation. We are not yet agreed as to the time
when a student must have chosen his adviser.
Some might stay with the person to whom they
were assigned as freshmen; others would find
an adviser during the freshman year; still
others during the sophomore year. Some stu
dents might have three or four different ad
visers during their careers. We see no compel
ing reason why that should be forbidden,
though frequent changes may be a signal that
counseling of some kind is needed. As at pres
ent, students will continue to seek out advice
from faculty members whom they like and
trust, no matter who is the officially designated
adviser. The present suggestion is intended to
take advantage of that fact of life.
The advising of graduate students might
seem to be self-evident. No one except grad
uate students themselves seems to feel it a
problem. Some responsibilities which many

departments seem not to handle well with
graduate students are the following: (1) intro
ducing new students to the University; (2) in
forming students about and channeling them,
when need is present, to the Counseling and
Testing Center, Cowell Halth Service, the
Placement Service, etc.; (3) giving students
vocational advice and sometimes placing them;
(4) informing new students about housing pos
sibilities and problems; (5) informing students
about useful training obtainable on a reg
ular basis in other departments. The pro
blem here is different from that of under
graduates in that the graduate student is
earnestly in the process of professional prep
aration. There is a certain emulative aspect to
graduate study, therefore, because many grad
uate students (certainly not nearly 100%) are
working with people with whom they expect
ultimately to become colleagues. It seems to
us probable that at present graduate students
select their own advisers to an extent that un
dergraduate do not. The function of faculty in
attracting graduate students to any university
assures that the potential of full relationships
is present. A stronger administrative surveil
lance of graduate advising might help to over
come the deficiences of individual departments.
Some special problems. Three groups of stu
dents present special problems to which the
Committee does not yet have answers. It is
clear that transfer students could use far bet
ter help on arrival than most of them get. It is
also clear that their problems are different
from those faced by freshman. We believe that
transfer students should bo given high priority
for on-campus housing. It also seems to us
that the evaluation of transfer credits could
be expedited and improved in many ways.
Some faculty members might be especially en
couraged to handle transfer students. We de
sire further suggestions about the advising of
transfer students from anyone with ideas to
give.
Another group of students with problems to
which the Committee has not yet given
sufficient attention is foreign students. The
Beehtel International Center is a source of
remarkably fine personal attention to foreign
students. But this group has academic prob
lems peculiarly their own, and some made of
advising needs, we think, to be tailored to
them. Again, the Committee wishes to be
helped by ideas.
The third group is comprised of members
of minorities with special disadvantages. Ad
vising needs to have cognizance both of the
personal problems faced by such students and
of academic needs. Efforts to provide tutoring
from the Office of Financial Aids have been
sporadic, due largely to stringently limited
funds. Some more formal program of tutoring
and counsel would greatly increase the accessi
bility of an adequate Stanford education for
such students. Stanford has publicly stated its
intention to do the right thing by these per
sons. Additional support, morally and mone
tarily, needs to be provided.
The extent and rewards of advising. The
Committee believes that advising on all levels
should be taken together in figuring the aver
age ratio of advisees to advisers. Taking fig
ures in the fall Student Directory as sub

stantially correct for numbers of majors and
graduate students in the Schools and Depart
ments, and taking a count of faculty at As
sistant Professor or higher in Courses and De
grees as substantially correct (realizing that
many people in the latter are absent on leave),
and assuming that all of those faculty advise
majors and graduate students, we find the fol
lowing ratios by schools of major and grad
uate advisees to advisers:
Earth Sciences 5.8 (169/29)
Engineering 13.4 (2114A58)
Humanities & Sciences 11.7 (4739/405)
The figures for present General Studies ad
vising, however, look rather different. 115
persons are engaged in 1967-68 in General
Studies advising of 2330 students without de
clared majors, a ratio of 20.2G advisees to each
adviser. Sources of General Studies advisers
are as follows:
Earth Sciences 7 (24% of
school faculty)
Engineering 11 (6.9% of
school faculty)
Humanities & Sciences 45 (11.1% of
school faculty)
Medicine 12
Military Science 2
Physical Education 3
Education 2
Administration 33
The figures show the difficulties encountered
by the Registrar in his task of recruiting
General Studies Advisers. Only 63 ( 54.8%) of
present General Studies advisers come from
the faculties of Schools which will enroll the
advisees as majors. Moreover, only 39% of
General Studies advisers come from the School
of Humanities and Sciences, which can rea
sonably expect to enroll about 80% of un
dergraduates.
At the same time, figures received from De
partments of the School of Humanities and
Sciences show a very wide variation in the
actual advising practice of departments. Some
departments average as few as 4 departmental
advisees per adviser, whereas members of
others may have as many as 66 major ad
visees. Such a figure seems to the Committee
a mockery of the very idea of advising.
One can be only routine with that many ad
visees. The Committee is inclined to believe
that an upper limit on the number of allowable
advisees per adviser should be set, perhaps at
25 or 30, such a figure to include both grad
uate and undergraduate students. The Com
mittee also believes that Deans should ask
executive hads of departments quite search
ing questions about provisions for carrying
advising when many members of a depart
ment propose to be on leave for a given year.
One instance has been reported in which a
member of a large department finds himself
during this academic year with 89 advisees
(graduate, undergraduate major, and Gen
eral Studies) because so many of his col
league are absent on leave. If a limit on ad
visees were set and adhered to, such ex
ploitation would not be permitted.
The Committee has thought very hard about
the place of advising in Stanford's status and
reward system for its faculty. At present, save

for one department that claims to adjust Its
teaching loads in proportion to advising loads,
advising is in fact extra-curricular, in that
it is supposed to be done but no one pays
much attention if it is not done. The Commit
tee is informed that advisers receive extra
pay in some universities, and it has discussed
whether bonus pay would be an incentive to
better advising. We are not satisfied that it
would. We have also asked how a faculty
member's advising effectiveness might be a
factor in his promotion and salary increment.
Nothing would please the Committee more
than to be shown a method of accurate evalua
tion of this effectiveness, so that it could be
used as one among other determinants. We
have yet to find a method. Even if the stu
dent were to choose his adviser, one could not
determine the adviser's effectiveness merely
by counting the number of his advisees.
The Committee believes that advising will
be able to play a role in the status and re
ward system only if the faculty becomes so
committed to the advising function (which,
for the Committee, is integral to the educa
tional function) that the very commitment
produces a means of reward. The faculty
must decide that advising is important, and
the faculty at large must expend some energy
in advising. Pressure probably ought to be
exerted on those of our colleagues who would
rather not advise students, although the very
reluctant adviser will likely not be a very
good one. Perhaps, in considerations of reward
and promotion, nothing more than a negative
question can be asked. If a brilliant research
er does no advising, can his research contribu
tions outweigh the absence of his contribu
tion to the University's humanity? In some in
stances, the answer might have to be "No."
So far as the Committee knows, the question
has never been asked.
Advising in the professor's profession. The
Committee has expressed its conviction that
advising students is properly a part of the
educational profession, that such an as
sumption ought if possible to be an element
in consideration of reward. We suggest, more
over, that prospective faculty appointees be
informed of advising obligations of Stanford
faculty members. We would also suggest a
more long-range way of achieving the actuality
of this assumption. It has often been pointed
out that among the weakest aspects of grad
uate education today is the failure to prepare
people for their profession. Graduate students
are trained to do research, but many of them
are hired to be teachers and members of fac
ulties. We do not wish to underplay research.
But too little is done to train those of our grad
uate students who will become teachers for
their actual professional functions. The Com
mittee suggests the advisability of instruc
tion for graduate students in the scope of the
objectives and responsibilities of their chosen
profession, which will help them comprehend
the expectations under which they will work.
Such instruction could go a long way toward
making actual the ideal that professors are
engaged in education, an activity that includes
research and publication, classroom teach
ing, and the education of individual students
outside of formal instruction that advising
ought to be. When education in that sense be
comes the basic assumption of the University's

life, we will be on the way toward the fulfill
ment of our humanity.

Epilogue:
Enablement and
Surveillance
It is hoped that in such a relatively casual
and self selecting system as that proposed
above, the quiet and unspectacular job that
needs to be done will proceed. But responsibili
ty for watching it must be lodged somewhere
more specific than in the hearts and minds of
the 20,000-odd souls of the Stanford commun
ity. There needs to be improved liaison among
agencies, assurance that stated functions are
being fulfilled, exhortation if not pressure
for participation in both given and receiving.
It was suggested, half jocularly, in the Com
mittee that what is wanted is a "University
humane ofTice.'The term is simplistic, but the
thought is precise. To indicate, to itself and
everyone else, that Stanford means its hu
manity, the responsibility should be assumed
by a highly placed officer, of at least Associate
Provost rank, whose responsibilities would in
clude the coordination of advising and coun
seling structures.
The Committee remains uncertain whether
the responsibility should be added to those
carried by the Dean of Students, whether it
should be assigned to a Dean of Undergraduate
Educationâ€”should such a position be rein
statedâ€”or whether a new position should be
created. In favor of the first is the fact that
the Dean of Students is now responsible for
several agencies in which counseling and ad
vising take place. On the other hand, the ed
ucational thrust of the entire program might
suggest that the responsibility be held by a
distinctly academic officer such as a Dean of
Undergraduate Education. At the same time,
the fact that advising and counseling must af
fect graduate as well as undergraduate stu
dents makes desirable that the officer not be
exclusively occupied with undergraduates.
Whoever such a person might be, and what
ever his title, he must be accessible to and
trustable by students, command the respect
and attract the cooperation of the faculty, and
display remarkable virtues to non-academic
staff persons.

This paper is presented to the University
community by the Committee on Advising and
Couast'lint; of the Study of Education at Stan
ford. It is important to say tliat the paper is
intended not as a recommendation for immedi
ate decision hut as some proposals for discus
sion.
Hearings will take place 7 9 p.m. Tuesday
and 4-fi p.m. Wednesday in room 143 of Meyer
Library. Members of the committee will be
present to receive comments on the paper. The
Committee also welcomes written responses to
the SES office, Meyer Library.
Few subjects are so frequently the target of
criticism as advising, few so rarely the object
of constructive suggestion. Widespread agree
ment thai advising is not very well done at
Stanford is equalled by imprecision as to the
problem and feasible solutions. Our realism
breeds cynicism, concluding that we must ac
cept inadequacy.
The Committee on Advising and Counseling
of the Study of Education at Stanford has at
tempted to be realistic but not cynical. Mow
ever unlikely the radical alteration of human
nature may be, the alteration of perspectives
and priorities is well within our reach. The
Committee urges the University's members,
however, that unless assumptions are modi
fied the cynics will he proven right. Foremost
among the assumptions that require adjust
ment is the tacit one that for a faculty mem
ber advising is an extracurricular activity.
This assumption produces hesitance on the
part of many students to consult advisers ex
cept for routine card-signing for fear of "tak
ing up his time," and their resultant complaint
that advising at Stanford is nothing but rou
tine. It produces the perception on the part of
faculty members that advising, except for one's
"own" special (preferably graduate) students,
is a chore to be avoided if possible and to be
disposed of quickly if avoidance is not possible.
It produces among administrators complete ig
norance of inequities in advising loads and the
ignoring of the function of advising in con
siderations of appointment, promotion, and re
ward.
The Committee is not so blindered as to sup
pose that advising is the most important as
pect of university life. But it is sensitive to
the penetration of aspects of advising into al
most everything Stanford does, from admis
sions to residence policy to undergraduate and
graduate curriculum to student services to the
extra-curriculum to placement and vocational
decisions. In what follows we have made some
assumption that bear explication. First, we
suppose that advising has basically to do with
the possibility of significant relations and com
munication between persons, that it sums up
what we intend by our sub-title: "the humani
ty of the University." Second, we assume that
the educational direction Stanford is taking
will entail more advising, not less, on both
graduate and undergraduate levels, and a high
er degree of humanity, not a lower. Third, we
assume that, since no system is perfect, an ar
rangement of advising that allows several
quite different forms and structures of advis
ing to take place will come closer to self-re
newal than a single, potentially rigid system.
The problem, as we presently see it, has
three points of focus: 1. the dissemination to
everyone who needs it of accurate and com
plete information; 2. the availability to anyone
who needs it of competent professional coun
seling; 3. the accessibility to all students of
Interested and personal academic advice.
I. Dissemination
of Information
The story about the man who did not have
enough information to take instruction is rele
vant to the problem of advising. The Commit
tee believes that adequate and accurate infor
mation on most matters regarding the Univer
sity is readily available to those who wish and
need to have it. Ignorance and misinformation
are widespread, however, some of it difficult
to understand.
The information that needs dissemination is
that which makes possible (1) awareness on
the part of faculty and students alike of exact
ly what the University's communal and aca
demic facilities are; (2) access by members of
the University to the various services provid
ed; (3) informed decisions about academic
matters on the part of students.
A great deal of this information can be and
is conveyed in print, but people forget things
when they read them in almost unnumerable
bulletins, pamphlets, brochures, hand-bills, mi
meographed or dittoed sheets, and the like.
The variety is compounded by the fact that
certain published materials are factual in na
ture and others are more propagandists in
tone and purpose, by the fact that some infor
mation is obsolete before it is ever printed and
some is incomplete.
The Committee suggests basic simplification
into two yearly publications. One is an expand
ed version of the present rather slim Informa
tion Bulletin, to serve as a more general hand
book to the University. Here should be de
tailed information on matters not covered in
Courses and Degrees: fees and expenses, resi
dences, relatively permanent organizations and
activities both student and University-wide,
services available to the community such as
those of the Health Service, the Counseling
and Testing Center, the Bechtel International
Center, and others. Also in such a handbook
might be found brief descriptions of the ad
ministrative operation of the University, the
duties and powers of its various officers, and
policies affecting various of its members.
Through such a publication, which should be
routinely in the hands of everyone, both stu
dents and faculty could find how to get help
for all kinds of problems. New students and
new faculty members in particular would, with

its aid, more easily find their ways in the Uni
versity.
Parenthetically, the Committee also sees a
need for a faculty handbook, which would in
form faculty members of such policies of ap
pointment, promotion, tenure, and administra
tive arrangement as are especially relevant to
them.
The Committee wishes, moreover, that Cour
ses and I)egre<>s might he improved. The in
formation in it is frequently obsolete before
the book comes off the press. Might there not
be in the den of someone at Stanford printing
methods that could reduce the lag between
copy deadlines and publication? Would the
improvement of accuracy allowed by an Aug
ust publication date outweigh the advantage
for incoming students of the present May pub
lication? Students and advisers alike now hesi
tate to use Courses and Degrees as a basis
for planning the work of even a single year in
advance. The Committee wonders, then, wheth
er usefulness for planning to those already
here should not have priority over usefulness
for those about to come. In the light of the in
creasing need for advanced academic planning
by students, greater accuracy becomes even
more desirable. Moreover, if Courses and De
grees wore improved and up-dated, the expense
of the quarterly Time Schedule might be re
duced by making it no more than a supple
ment to Courses and Degrees.
All of these publications would bo of im
mense help to advisers and their advisees. The
Committee is of the opinion that the adviser's
function should not be to disseminate informa
tion that the student can more readily receive
otherwise. In saying that, we take full cog
nizance of the high likelihood that anything in
print will be misunderstood, misconstrued, or
misused somewhere by someone. Where the
adviser perceives ignorance, he must, of
course, rectify itâ€”and the student may do the
same. The adviser will function well with an
advisee when both have the necessary infor
mation, for then the adviser is free to advise
instead of merely to inform.
Concomitantly, the Committee believes that
the adviser should be relieved of policing cur
ricular regulations. So much of academic ad
vising is taken up with routine questions about
the fulfillment of requirements (How many
units of Science have you left to take? How
much math? etc.) that time for genuine and
personalized advice is too often at a premium.
The Committee has a hunch, moreover, (1)
that on the whole students know the require
ments in General Studies and in major pro
grams better than their advisers do, and (2)
that students almost always know exactly
where they stand with regard to those require
ments. The Committee wonders about the feas
ibility of computerizing information of these
kinds to enable easy retrieval. If machines can
free us for the improvement of our humanity,
we should by all means use them.
In short, the Committee believes that advis
ing could be far better focussed on advice if
the dissemination of information were both
simplified and improved, so that the adviser
does not have to be a traffic cop of regulations.
11. Availability
of Counseling
For clarity of terminology, we use the term
"counseling" to mean the impartation of help
for problems of a personal sort, not immediate
ly involving the academic, while "advising" is
restricted in this paper to academic advice.
It is certainly the case that a great deal of
counseling in this sense occurs in any commu
nity as large and as complex as Stanford. Most
of it is casual, among close friends, and with
no pretense of professional expertise. This
sort of counseling will happen whether the
institution encourages or discourages it. Any
attempt to structure such relationships is, of
course, doomed to failure. Faculty members
also do a great deal of counseling of this kind.
Though some may criticize the non-profession
al nature of such counseling, that may in itself
bo one of the'strengths of the relationship. At
the same time, situations frequently arise
where professional counseling is needed and
any casual counselor should always have in
mind the possibility of referring someone to
sources of professional aid. The Committee has
not conceived of any way by which faculty or
other such occasional counselors might cus
tomarily be taught how to recognize danger
signals, but they should be aware of an obli
gation to suggest referral.
Nevertheless, sources of professional coun
seling are present at Stanford, and the Com
mittee has been surprise that some members
of the University, both faculty and students,
seem unaware of them. Apart from the coun
seling done in residences < faculty residents,
residence directors, resident assistants, tutors,
and sponsors), which would have to be called
at best semi-professional, counseling done by
campus religious representatives, and that
done in special circumstances by persons in
the Dean of Students' office, the University
maintains two major sources of professional
counseling and a third that might become one.
We refer in the first instance to the Counsel
ing and Testing Center and to the psychiatric
services of the Cowell Health Center, and in
the second instance to the Placement Service.
The Counseling and Testing Center provides
psychological testing of many kinds and both
short-range and long-range psychological coun
seling. The psychiatric staff of the Cowell
Health Center is available for psychiatric con
sultation and some forms of therapy, and pa
tients in need of long-range therapy are re
ferred to psychiatrists in the School of Medi
cine for it.
The Committee has no wish to enter into the
relative merits of these two approaches, be
lieving that both meet various kinds of situ
ations helpfully. The liaison between the Conn

soling and Testing Center and the Cowell
Health reportedly good and getting
better. Such liaison and cooperation should be
encouraged by the University administration.
The fact that a relatively small proportion of
Stanford students uses the counseling services
in these two institutions may be an index of
the community's relatively healthy mental
state. On the other hand, experience hÂ°re and
in other universities would seem to indicate
that there are many more problems than are
actually met by these services. Larger staffs
would doubtless encourage more students with
real problems to seek aid.
It has been rightly observed that while any
person lacks the medical or psychological
help he needs, the job of counseling is not be
ing properly done. One of our faculty col
leagues recently stated that "One student sui
cide per year is one too many," a sentiment
with which no one could quarrel. But preven
tion in the realm of counseling is the most
difficult task. For one thing, it requires the
willing cooperation of the patient or subject.
The continued excellence and improvement
of these two services seems to the Committee,
however, a matter of rather high priority. We
are in a period where the mental strains upon
the age group of Stanford students are great
and on the increase. It is no pampering mood
that leads to the conclusion that professional
aid is needed; it is rather the sense of urgency
that informs higher education, and the wish
that barriers to the best education every stu
dent is capable of absorbing be as far as possi
ble thrown down. We do not believe that the
improvement of, say, the Counseling and Test
ing Center is more important than the im
provement of the faculty. But believing in the
priority of the academic, we wish it to be aided
by the best medical and psychological services
Stanford can afford to render.
We have few specific recommendations,
apart from general improvementâ€”which In
itself ought not to be taken as underhanded
criticism. The first contact with the Counsel
ing and Testing Center ought to make clear
to entering students that genuine personal
counsel may be had there. We are dubious
that the orientation-week testing is a good in
troduction for students, valuable as the re
sults may be for staff research. The counsel
ing function should be made more distinct
from that of legitimate research.
The most difficult question with which the
Committee has long wrestled is how to be
sure that the people who need the help receive
it. To that question, we have no satisfactory
answer. The availability of the services should
b" widely publicized and accurately described.
Every member of the University should know
about them. But the person who refuses to
seek help when he needs it can not, by any
means the Committee has been able to discov
er, be forced to have it.
The Committee notes with satisfaction the
recent improvements in the situation of reli
gious ministries on the campus. Although not
every religious tradition is officially repre
sented, persons desiring counseling of a reli
gious sort have access to a broad range of
clergymen and denominational representatives.
Since campus office space was made available
to denominational representatives, the work
of the Pean of the Chapel and his assistant
and of the University Chaplain has been en
larged by cooperation. To those who doubt the
propriety of the presence of clergymen on a
university campus, the Committee would say
that the day when religious bodies looked on
the ministry to students as a salvage operation
from the godless university is long past. Safe
guards against irresponsibility in this as in
other areas of interest can be established ad
ministratively. Those members of the Univer
sity who find religious counsel helpful and nec
essary can and do seek it out.
By virtue of the fact that Selective Service
is of immediate concern to the majority of
Stanford students, the Committee has consid
ered advising facilities offered regarding the
draft. A National Service Adviser has for
some time been available. The Committee ap
plauds the addition of a counselor on con
scientious objection to the student facilities
available on campus. We anticipate that such
an office will be continued while the question
of the draft is pertinent, and suggest that the
amount of student need for such counsel re
quires the availability of more time than is
now provided. The different natures of the
counseling involved makes it advisable to keep
separate the conscientious objection counsel
ing and National Service advising. Greater co
ordination of the latter with the ROTC offices
and the Placement Service would facilitate the
answering of questions faced by many stu
dents in regard to the options available for
fulfillment of military service. However, the
effectiveness of both offices is hampered at
present by lack of information reaching the
student. Publicizing these services in the hand
book to the University proposed above, and by
whatever means are now available, and the
initiation of orientation sessions with tutors,
residence assistants, and directors may begin
to alleviate this inadequacy.
The Placement Service is kept until last be
cause the Committee believes substantial ex
pansion is possible and desirable. At present
the Placement Service is a means to bring
prospective employees into contact with pros
pective employers and to aid students to re
ceive part-time and summer jobs. With ex
pense (the Committee does not wish to guess
how much* and reorganization, the Placement
Service could become a Career Guidance Cen
ter. This change would put job interviews into
perspective as aspects of a more thorough in
vestigation by the individual of his wishes and
talents for a career. Facilities for aptitude
tests of various kinds would be needed, as well
as staff to process and counsel regarding such
tests. For this purpose, it would he well to
shift the efforts in career counseling now car
ried on by the Counseling and Testing Center
to an expanded Career Guidance Center. Infor

mation on opportunities and requisites for ca
reers of many kinds could conveniently be
gathered and sometimes produced by a Career
Guidance Center, and one might expect to find
in it the current catalogues of graduate and
professional schools across the country.
It has often been remarked that, for all the
Founders' desires that a Stanford education
should fit students for useful pursuits, the ac
cessibility of career counsel is rather slim
hÂ°re. In feeling that the situation bears im
provement the Committee does not imply that
every student should have made a clear voca
tional choice by the end of his senior year. But
students wishing to make informed and ra
tional choices of careers should have access as
early as possible to information and individual
ized counsel regarding the options. A Career
Guidance Center might have the contacts to
place students in part-time and temporary
jobs with persons in careers that the students
are considering, experience which might be
invaluable whether it be positive or negative.
Other methods of gaining insight into vari
ous kinds of professional life may likewise
gain momentum. A proposal now being con
sidered suggests the establishment of sopho
more and higher level courses on the profes
sions, taught from the perspectives of both
the humanities and the social sciences. Such
courses would be informational and descriptive
and in no sense recruitment techniques. Still
other means might be found to make available
for students bases for wise career decisions.
The present admirable advising done by facul
ty members of the School of Medicine with
and for pre-medical students could profitably
be emulated elsewhere. Could not the Schools
of Law, Business, and Education, for example,
provide similar counsel in cooperation with a
Career Guidance Center? The Committee pre
sumes that remuneration occupations will for
some time be necessary for most members of
American society. There is point, therefore, to
the thought that education can be useful, even
though that is far from being the whole point
of education.
111. Academic
Advising
If personal counseling is very largely done
casually and by amateurs, so is academic ad
vising. Most of the advising done at Stanford
is done by one undergraduate to another. The
Committee heartily approves this state of af
fairs at the same time that it is not satisfied
to abandon faculty advising.
Student Advising. Several aspects of under
graduate advising are carried by undergradu
ates. Students get their best information about
the value of specific courses from other stu
dents who have taken them. This is only natu
ral. Faculty members are loath to comment
on their colleagues, for reasons of professional
propriety; students are not. Moreover, faculty
members can talk about courses taught by
their colleagues only by hearsay, where stu
dents can speak at first hand. Such informal
advising is valuable, even though it is fre
quently biased. Sporadic attempts have been
made to bring it usefully into published form,
with such documents as the Course Review,
succeeding the earlier "Scratch Sheet." The
Committee applauds the concept of a student
Course Review as a valuable asset to advising,
and wishes that it might be thorough in its
coverage of courses, representative of a varie
ty of student reactions, and sensitive to stated
aims of professors in courses. Such a review
would also inform professors helpfully about
responses to the courses. The Course Review
ought to appear regularly, with cooperation
and financial assistance from the University
but without administrative control.
A recent experiment in appointing students
as advisers-at-large in their major departments
produced uncertain results. The fault may lie
partially in a lack of information about the
program, in student suspicion that student
advisers would be "administration types," in
students' feelings that they could get as good
advice from their friendsâ€”or in any possible
combination of those and other factors. The
Committee is not satisfied that student de
partmental advising is a bad idea, especially
on the basis of one year's experiment in three
departments. It exhorts departments and
schools to keep trying to find ways of taking
advantage of students' advising abilities.
The function of the adviser. We have already
expressed the Committee's suggestion that ad
vising not be simply a matter of policing, of
making sure that the student has information
and is taking the courses he is required to
take. The Adviser's Handbook describes the
goal of advising as bringing "the student to
the point where he can assume a maximum
amount of responsibility for his own academic
program and can make wise decisions on his
own" (p. 12). The Committee wishes to go be
yond that to propose that the adviser be
viewed both by the student and by himself as
the student's academic advocate, the particular
educator who agrees to concern himself with
his advisee's best education. This means prin
cipally that the adviser wishes to help the
student plan an educational career that goes
somewhere, that has coherence and point to it,
rather than being a miscellaneous collection
of requirements and aimless electives. If the
adviser is the student's advocate, however, this
coherence must be a means of enabling the
student's wishes and strengths to be embodied
in his program, not a way for the adviser to
impose his own concepts on the student.
Such a concept would, to he sure, produce
advising that takes more time, for carefully
considering with a student his academic ob
jectives and intellectual curiosities consumes
more time that simply signing his card. But if
such advising is understood and underscored
by tin 1 faculty as integral 1o education, faculty
members may more happily engage in it. It

poses several problems, among which is the
acceptance of advising as a normal aspect of
academic appointment at Stanford. If such
advising will not be done by the faculty, some
one must do it. In the absence of good faculty
advising, a corps of professional advisers
would probably have to be retained to the dam
age of the budget and of the academic exper
tise with which advising ought to be done. On
all counts, the Committee emphatically prefers
faculty advising.
The student's stake in advising. A curious
duality is sometimes to be observed among
students. On the one hand, they firmly ob
ject to be treated as ciphers or as children by
an institution standing in loco parentis. On
the other .they wish the advice of their elders
among the faculty, and this wish is sometimes
Indistinguishable from a desire for a parent
surrogate. Occasionally, when the advice given
is not to an individual's liking, he will pro
test that he is not being respected. We point
this out in part to say that the students' own
view of their stake in advising is not crystal
clear.
Although the student knows more about
himself than any adviser is ever likely to
know, he needs advising because he has not
enough experience of education to know pre
cisely how to join his interests and talents
to a curricular regimen. This observation ap
plies equally, though in different perspectives,
to undergraduates and graduate students. The
student looks to an adviser for guidance in
pursuing an education that will take ad
vantage of his interests and lead him beyond
his own provincial boundaries, at the same
time that it is certifiable by the University as
meeting its standards. The University, of
course, must determine what those standards
are, since it is the body doing the certifying.
The adviser stands toward the student in the
peculiar position of being at once a represen
tative of the University's power of sanction
upon the student (he makes judgments on stu
dents' performance) and and the advocate of
that particula student in the acquisition of his
most effective education.
If the structure of degree requirements on
the graduate level becomes less prescriptive,
the premium on interested advising which
aids the student toward coherence as well as
adventuresomeness will rise. Experience will
count for much in a student's planning, al
though it should not be prescriptively applied.
What is at stake for the student in a more flex
ible under-graduate program is precisely the
humanity of an adviser who is genuinely the
student's educational advocate. If the program
is flexible, advocacy need not consist in find
ing ways to circumvent regulations.
The levels of advising and their problems.
Special and different problems of advising ob
tain for freshmen, transfers, upperclass un
dergraduates and departmental majors, and
graduate students. At the same time, the Com
mittee is convinced of one true observation:
the best advising takes place where advisee
and adviser have some kind of common bond,
beyond the routine. This may be the bond of
the same field of study (the normal pre-set
bond between graduate students and faculty),
some common experience (frequently that the
student has taken the faculty member's
course), or prior acquaintance.
From this standpoint, the advising of fresh
men is the most difficult task, for freshmen
rarely have any existing bond to a faculty
member. It must be established. The Commit
tee has been divided upon several possible ways
to handle freshman advising. That the faculty
should carry the bulk of the advising seems
wise, yet a student's assigned adviser only
rarely turns out to be important or helpful
to him. As the freshman year curriculum now
stands, freshmen rarely come into close con
tact with faculty members, except those al
-most as transient as themselves: English
TA's, Western Civ instructors, lab TA's, and
beginning math and language TA's. The In
crease of Freshman seminars may improve
the range of faculty contact. The plans of
assigning advisers to groups in living units
has been extremely spotty in its effectiveness,
and it suffers from the fact that the advisers
remain abstractly faculty members, rather
than being perceived in their active teaching
roles. Relationships of freshman to faculty
residents or directors of living units, to tutors,
and to sponsors are relatively close, and these
persons in fact do the bulk of freshman ad
vising. The Trancos experiment is one possible
model of freshman advising, where residence
director, sponsors and tutors, and a team of
faculty advisers work closely together. Fresh
man advising ought to aid in the orientation
of the entering student, j.etting him off on the
right foot, proposing seriously that he identify
areas of genuine intellectual interest. Such
advising should prepare the student to find
a permanent academic adviser as he goes.
The Committee is unanimous in suggesting
that advising will become more effective from
all sides if the student ultimately chooses his
own adviser. In fact this frequently happens
now, except that the adviser whom the stu
dent chooses is often not the one responsible
for signing his card. We see the following
arguments in favor of this idea: 1. The stu
dent will most likely choose a faculty mem
ber whom he has seen in action, knows some
thing of his qualities and the "cut of his jib."
2. Such a relationship would underscore the
obligation of both student and adviser for
tion in which the student is interested and
tion In which the student is interested an
which makes coherent academic sense of his
interests and career plans. (The Committee
believes, parenthetically, that changing ad
visers and programs ought to be quite easy,
with no prejudice attached to it.) 3. If the
structure of the freshman year becomes less
prescribed, freshmen will have access to a
broader range of course options and of faculty
members than is now the case and will be
more likely to identify someone with whom
they believe they can work.
Certain problems with this arrangement can
be foreseen. 1. Some very popular professors
will be swamped with advisees, and other fac
ulty members will have few or none. To this
the Committee would propose that limitations
on the number of advisees per faculty member
be administratively established (see below.) 2.
Understaffed departments will have too many
majors to observe the limitations, and will have
to continue assigning majors to advisers. To
this the Committee proposes that the student's
adviser need not, though he may, be in the stu
dent's own major department. If the adviser is
not charged to keep track of regulations, it is
not at all unlikely that a professor in one de
partment can help a student in another to pur
sue a course that both meets the standards laid
down by the department and satisfies the stu
dent's own academic needs and wants. Depart
ments might require countersignature of study
cards by departmental representatives. Any
student seriously wishing to become a his
torian, for example, will probably try to find
a historian as adviser in order to get help in
preparing to be like him. We recognize that
in some programs, e.g. Philosophy and the
Honors Program in Humanities, the adviser
docs considerable tutoring of the student in
his senior year. This does not seem to us in
compatible with the basic premise. We are in
clined, on the undergraduate level, to resist
departmental "imperialism," which demands
control over "its" students. An undergraduate
major need not, after all, be occupational prep
aration, but, especially in the Humanities and
Social Sciences, is rather a point of co
herence for one's entire liberal education. Stu
dents who wish strong identification with a
discipline or department may gain it by choos
ing advisers there. Students who do not want
such a concentration may be well served by
advisers from almost anywhere in the Uni
versity.
Such a plan would introduce a differentia
tion between freshman and upperclass advis
ing, in place of the present differentiation be
tween General Studies and major advising.
The Committee is inclined to believe that the
former differentiation would make all advis
ing more effective with regard to general ed
ucation. We are not yet agreed as to the time
when a student must have chosen his adviser.
Some might stay with the person to whom they
were assigned as freshmen; others would find
an adviser during the freshman year; still
others during the sophomore year. Some stu
dents might have three or four different ad
visers during their careers. We see no compel
ing reason why that should be forbidden,
though frequent changes may be a signal that
counseling of some kind is needed. As at pres
ent, students will continue to seek out advice
from faculty members whom they like and
trust, no matter who is the officially designated
adviser. The present suggestion is intended to
take advantage of that fact of life.
The advising of graduate students might
seem to be self-evident. No one except grad
uate students themselves seems to feel it a
problem. Some responsibilities which many

departments seem not to handle well with
graduate students are the following: (1) intro
ducing new students to the University; (2) in
forming students about and channeling them,
when need is present, to the Counseling and
Testing Center, Cowell Halth Service, the
Placement Service, etc.; (3) giving students
vocational advice and sometimes placing them;
(4) informing new students about housing pos
sibilities and problems; (5) informing students
about useful training obtainable on a reg
ular basis in other departments. The pro
blem here is different from that of under
graduates in that the graduate student is
earnestly in the process of professional prep
aration. There is a certain emulative aspect to
graduate study, therefore, because many grad
uate students (certainly not nearly 100%) are
working with people with whom they expect
ultimately to become colleagues. It seems to
us probable that at present graduate students
select their own advisers to an extent that un
dergraduate do not. The function of faculty in
attracting graduate students to any university
assures that the potential of full relationships
is present. A stronger administrative surveil
lance of graduate advising might help to over
come the deficiences of individual departments.
Some special problems. Three groups of stu
dents present special problems to which the
Committee does not yet have answers. It is
clear that transfer students could use far bet
ter help on arrival than most of them get. It is
also clear that their problems are different
from those faced by freshman. We believe that
transfer students should bo given high priority
for on-campus housing. It also seems to us
that the evaluation of transfer credits could
be expedited and improved in many ways.
Some faculty members might be especially en
couraged to handle transfer students. We de
sire further suggestions about the advising of
transfer students from anyone with ideas to
give.
Another group of students with problems to
which the Committee has not yet given
sufficient attention is foreign students. The
Beehtel International Center is a source of
remarkably fine personal attention to foreign
students. But this group has academic prob
lems peculiarly their own, and some made of
advising needs, we think, to be tailored to
them. Again, the Committee wishes to be
helped by ideas.
The third group is comprised of members
of minorities with special disadvantages. Ad
vising needs to have cognizance both of the
personal problems faced by such students and
of academic needs. Efforts to provide tutoring
from the Office of Financial Aids have been
sporadic, due largely to stringently limited
funds. Some more formal program of tutoring
and counsel would greatly increase the accessi
bility of an adequate Stanford education for
such students. Stanford has publicly stated its
intention to do the right thing by these per
sons. Additional support, morally and mone
tarily, needs to be provided.
The extent and rewards of advising. The
Committee believes that advising on all levels
should be taken together in figuring the aver
age ratio of advisees to advisers. Taking fig
ures in the fall Student Directory as sub

stantially correct for numbers of majors and
graduate students in the Schools and Depart
ments, and taking a count of faculty at As
sistant Professor or higher in Courses and De
grees as substantially correct (realizing that
many people in the latter are absent on leave),
and assuming that all of those faculty advise
majors and graduate students, we find the fol
lowing ratios by schools of major and grad
uate advisees to advisers:
Earth Sciences 5.8 (169/29)
Engineering 13.4 (2114A58)
Humanities & Sciences 11.7 (4739/405)
The figures for present General Studies ad
vising, however, look rather different. 115
persons are engaged in 1967-68 in General
Studies advising of 2330 students without de
clared majors, a ratio of 20.2G advisees to each
adviser. Sources of General Studies advisers
are as follows:
Earth Sciences 7 (24% of
school faculty)
Engineering 11 (6.9% of
school faculty)
Humanities & Sciences 45 (11.1% of
school faculty)
Medicine 12
Military Science 2
Physical Education 3
Education 2
Administration 33
The figures show the difficulties encountered
by the Registrar in his task of recruiting
General Studies Advisers. Only 63 ( 54.8%) of
present General Studies advisers come from
the faculties of Schools which will enroll the
advisees as majors. Moreover, only 39% of
General Studies advisers come from the School
of Humanities and Sciences, which can rea
sonably expect to enroll about 80% of un
dergraduates.
At the same time, figures received from De
partments of the School of Humanities and
Sciences show a very wide variation in the
actual advising practice of departments. Some
departments average as few as 4 departmental
advisees per adviser, whereas members of
others may have as many as 66 major ad
visees. Such a figure seems to the Committee
a mockery of the very idea of advising.
One can be only routine with that many ad
visees. The Committee is inclined to believe
that an upper limit on the number of allowable
advisees per adviser should be set, perhaps at
25 or 30, such a figure to include both grad
uate and undergraduate students. The Com
mittee also believes that Deans should ask
executive hads of departments quite search
ing questions about provisions for carrying
advising when many members of a depart
ment propose to be on leave for a given year.
One instance has been reported in which a
member of a large department finds himself
during this academic year with 89 advisees
(graduate, undergraduate major, and Gen
eral Studies) because so many of his col
league are absent on leave. If a limit on ad
visees were set and adhered to, such ex
ploitation would not be permitted.
The Committee has thought very hard about
the place of advising in Stanford's status and
reward system for its faculty. At present, save

for one department that claims to adjust Its
teaching loads in proportion to advising loads,
advising is in fact extra-curricular, in that
it is supposed to be done but no one pays
much attention if it is not done. The Commit
tee is informed that advisers receive extra
pay in some universities, and it has discussed
whether bonus pay would be an incentive to
better advising. We are not satisfied that it
would. We have also asked how a faculty
member's advising effectiveness might be a
factor in his promotion and salary increment.
Nothing would please the Committee more
than to be shown a method of accurate evalua
tion of this effectiveness, so that it could be
used as one among other determinants. We
have yet to find a method. Even if the stu
dent were to choose his adviser, one could not
determine the adviser's effectiveness merely
by counting the number of his advisees.
The Committee believes that advising will
be able to play a role in the status and re
ward system only if the faculty becomes so
committed to the advising function (which,
for the Committee, is integral to the educa
tional function) that the very commitment
produces a means of reward. The faculty
must decide that advising is important, and
the faculty at large must expend some energy
in advising. Pressure probably ought to be
exerted on those of our colleagues who would
rather not advise students, although the very
reluctant adviser will likely not be a very
good one. Perhaps, in considerations of reward
and promotion, nothing more than a negative
question can be asked. If a brilliant research
er does no advising, can his research contribu
tions outweigh the absence of his contribu
tion to the University's humanity? In some in
stances, the answer might have to be "No."
So far as the Committee knows, the question
has never been asked.
Advising in the professor's profession. The
Committee has expressed its conviction that
advising students is properly a part of the
educational profession, that such an as
sumption ought if possible to be an element
in consideration of reward. We suggest, more
over, that prospective faculty appointees be
informed of advising obligations of Stanford
faculty members. We would also suggest a
more long-range way of achieving the actuality
of this assumption. It has often been pointed
out that among the weakest aspects of grad
uate education today is the failure to prepare
people for their profession. Graduate students
are trained to do research, but many of them
are hired to be teachers and members of fac
ulties. We do not wish to underplay research.
But too little is done to train those of our grad
uate students who will become teachers for
their actual professional functions. The Com
mittee suggests the advisability of instruc
tion for graduate students in the scope of the
objectives and responsibilities of their chosen
profession, which will help them comprehend
the expectations under which they will work.
Such instruction could go a long way toward
making actual the ideal that professors are
engaged in education, an activity that includes
research and publication, classroom teach
ing, and the education of individual students
outside of formal instruction that advising
ought to be. When education in that sense be
comes the basic assumption of the University's

life, we will be on the way toward the fulfill
ment of our humanity.

Epilogue:
Enablement and
Surveillance
It is hoped that in such a relatively casual
and self selecting system as that proposed
above, the quiet and unspectacular job that
needs to be done will proceed. But responsibili
ty for watching it must be lodged somewhere
more specific than in the hearts and minds of
the 20,000-odd souls of the Stanford commun
ity. There needs to be improved liaison among
agencies, assurance that stated functions are
being fulfilled, exhortation if not pressure
for participation in both given and receiving.
It was suggested, half jocularly, in the Com
mittee that what is wanted is a "University
humane ofTice.'The term is simplistic, but the
thought is precise. To indicate, to itself and
everyone else, that Stanford means its hu
manity, the responsibility should be assumed
by a highly placed officer, of at least Associate
Provost rank, whose responsibilities would in
clude the coordination of advising and coun
seling structures.
The Committee remains uncertain whether
the responsibility should be added to those
carried by the Dean of Students, whether it
should be assigned to a Dean of Undergraduate
Educationâ€”should such a position be rein
statedâ€”or whether a new position should be
created. In favor of the first is the fact that
the Dean of Students is now responsible for
several agencies in which counseling and ad
vising take place. On the other hand, the ed
ucational thrust of the entire program might
suggest that the responsibility be held by a
distinctly academic officer such as a Dean of
Undergraduate Education. At the same time,
the fact that advising and counseling must af
fect graduate as well as undergraduate stu
dents makes desirable that the officer not be
exclusively occupied with undergraduates.
Whoever such a person might be, and what
ever his title, he must be accessible to and
trustable by students, command the respect
and attract the cooperation of the faculty, and
display remarkable virtues to non-academic
staff persons.

This paper is presented to the University
community by the Committee on Advising and
Couast'lint; of the Study of Education at Stan
ford. It is important to say tliat the paper is
intended not as a recommendation for immedi
ate decision hut as some proposals for discus
sion.
Hearings will take place 7 9 p.m. Tuesday
and 4-fi p.m. Wednesday in room 143 of Meyer
Library. Members of the committee will be
present to receive comments on the paper. The
Committee also welcomes written responses to
the SES office, Meyer Library.
Few subjects are so frequently the target of
criticism as advising, few so rarely the object
of constructive suggestion. Widespread agree
ment thai advising is not very well done at
Stanford is equalled by imprecision as to the
problem and feasible solutions. Our realism
breeds cynicism, concluding that we must ac
cept inadequacy.
The Committee on Advising and Counseling
of the Study of Education at Stanford has at
tempted to be realistic but not cynical. Mow
ever unlikely the radical alteration of human
nature may be, the alteration of perspectives
and priorities is well within our reach. The
Committee urges the University's members,
however, that unless assumptions are modi
fied the cynics will he proven right. Foremost
among the assumptions that require adjust
ment is the tacit one that for a faculty mem
ber advising is an extracurricular activity.
This assumption produces hesitance on the
part of many students to consult advisers ex
cept for routine card-signing for fear of "tak
ing up his time," and their resultant complaint
that advising at Stanford is nothing but rou
tine. It produces the perception on the part of
faculty members that advising, except for one's
"own" special (preferably graduate) students,
is a chore to be avoided if possible and to be
disposed of quickly if avoidance is not possible.
It produces among administrators complete ig
norance of inequities in advising loads and the
ignoring of the function of advising in con
siderations of appointment, promotion, and re
ward.
The Committee is not so blindered as to sup
pose that advising is the most important as
pect of university life. But it is sensitive to
the penetration of aspects of advising into al
most everything Stanford does, from admis
sions to residence policy to undergraduate and
graduate curriculum to student services to the
extra-curriculum to placement and vocational
decisions. In what follows we have made some
assumption that bear explication. First, we
suppose that advising has basically to do with
the possibility of significant relations and com
munication between persons, that it sums up
what we intend by our sub-title: "the humani
ty of the University." Second, we assume that
the educational direction Stanford is taking
will entail more advising, not less, on both
graduate and undergraduate levels, and a high
er degree of humanity, not a lower. Third, we
assume that, since no system is perfect, an ar
rangement of advising that allows several
quite different forms and structures of advis
ing to take place will come closer to self-re
newal than a single, potentially rigid system.
The problem, as we presently see it, has
three points of focus: 1. the dissemination to
everyone who needs it of accurate and com
plete information; 2. the availability to anyone
who needs it of competent professional coun
seling; 3. the accessibility to all students of
Interested and personal academic advice.
I. Dissemination
of Information
The story about the man who did not have
enough information to take instruction is rele
vant to the problem of advising. The Commit
tee believes that adequate and accurate infor
mation on most matters regarding the Univer
sity is readily available to those who wish and
need to have it. Ignorance and misinformation
are widespread, however, some of it difficult
to understand.
The information that needs dissemination is
that which makes possible (1) awareness on
the part of faculty and students alike of exact
ly what the University's communal and aca
demic facilities are; (2) access by members of
the University to the various services provid
ed; (3) informed decisions about academic
matters on the part of students.
A great deal of this information can be and
is conveyed in print, but people forget things
when they read them in almost unnumerable
bulletins, pamphlets, brochures, hand-bills, mi
meographed or dittoed sheets, and the like.
The variety is compounded by the fact that
certain published materials are factual in na
ture and others are more propagandists in
tone and purpose, by the fact that some infor
mation is obsolete before it is ever printed and
some is incomplete.
The Committee suggests basic simplification
into two yearly publications. One is an expand
ed version of the present rather slim Informa
tion Bulletin, to serve as a more general hand
book to the University. Here should be de
tailed information on matters not covered in
Courses and Degrees: fees and expenses, resi
dences, relatively permanent organizations and
activities both student and University-wide,
services available to the community such as
those of the Health Service, the Counseling
and Testing Center, the Bechtel International
Center, and others. Also in such a handbook
might be found brief descriptions of the ad
ministrative operation of the University, the
duties and powers of its various officers, and
policies affecting various of its members.
Through such a publication, which should be
routinely in the hands of everyone, both stu
dents and faculty could find how to get help
for all kinds of problems. New students and
new faculty members in particular would, with

its aid, more easily find their ways in the Uni
versity.
Parenthetically, the Committee also sees a
need for a faculty handbook, which would in
form faculty members of such policies of ap
pointment, promotion, tenure, and administra
tive arrangement as are especially relevant to
them.
The Committee wishes, moreover, that Cour
ses and I)egre<>s might he improved. The in
formation in it is frequently obsolete before
the book comes off the press. Might there not
be in the den of someone at Stanford printing
methods that could reduce the lag between
copy deadlines and publication? Would the
improvement of accuracy allowed by an Aug
ust publication date outweigh the advantage
for incoming students of the present May pub
lication? Students and advisers alike now hesi
tate to use Courses and Degrees as a basis
for planning the work of even a single year in
advance. The Committee wonders, then, wheth
er usefulness for planning to those already
here should not have priority over usefulness
for those about to come. In the light of the in
creasing need for advanced academic planning
by students, greater accuracy becomes even
more desirable. Moreover, if Courses and De
grees wore improved and up-dated, the expense
of the quarterly Time Schedule might be re
duced by making it no more than a supple
ment to Courses and Degrees.
All of these publications would bo of im
mense help to advisers and their advisees. The
Committee is of the opinion that the adviser's
function should not be to disseminate informa
tion that the student can more readily receive
otherwise. In saying that, we take full cog
nizance of the high likelihood that anything in
print will be misunderstood, misconstrued, or
misused somewhere by someone. Where the
adviser perceives ignorance, he must, of
course, rectify itâ€”and the student may do the
same. The adviser will function well with an
advisee when both have the necessary infor
mation, for then the adviser is free to advise
instead of merely to inform.
Concomitantly, the Committee believes that
the adviser should be relieved of policing cur
ricular regulations. So much of academic ad
vising is taken up with routine questions about
the fulfillment of requirements (How many
units of Science have you left to take? How
much math? etc.) that time for genuine and
personalized advice is too often at a premium.
The Committee has a hunch, moreover, (1)
that on the whole students know the require
ments in General Studies and in major pro
grams better than their advisers do, and (2)
that students almost always know exactly
where they stand with regard to those require
ments. The Committee wonders about the feas
ibility of computerizing information of these
kinds to enable easy retrieval. If machines can
free us for the improvement of our humanity,
we should by all means use them.
In short, the Committee believes that advis
ing could be far better focussed on advice if
the dissemination of information were both
simplified and improved, so that the adviser
does not have to be a traffic cop of regulations.
11. Availability
of Counseling
For clarity of terminology, we use the term
"counseling" to mean the impartation of help
for problems of a personal sort, not immediate
ly involving the academic, while "advising" is
restricted in this paper to academic advice.
It is certainly the case that a great deal of
counseling in this sense occurs in any commu
nity as large and as complex as Stanford. Most
of it is casual, among close friends, and with
no pretense of professional expertise. This
sort of counseling will happen whether the
institution encourages or discourages it. Any
attempt to structure such relationships is, of
course, doomed to failure. Faculty members
also do a great deal of counseling of this kind.
Though some may criticize the non-profession
al nature of such counseling, that may in itself
bo one of the'strengths of the relationship. At
the same time, situations frequently arise
where professional counseling is needed and
any casual counselor should always have in
mind the possibility of referring someone to
sources of professional aid. The Committee has
not conceived of any way by which faculty or
other such occasional counselors might cus
tomarily be taught how to recognize danger
signals, but they should be aware of an obli
gation to suggest referral.
Nevertheless, sources of professional coun
seling are present at Stanford, and the Com
mittee has been surprise that some members
of the University, both faculty and students,
seem unaware of them. Apart from the coun
seling done in residences < faculty residents,
residence directors, resident assistants, tutors,
and sponsors), which would have to be called
at best semi-professional, counseling done by
campus religious representatives, and that
done in special circumstances by persons in
the Dean of Students' office, the University
maintains two major sources of professional
counseling and a third that might become one.
We refer in the first instance to the Counsel
ing and Testing Center and to the psychiatric
services of the Cowell Health Center, and in
the second instance to the Placement Service.
The Counseling and Testing Center provides
psychological testing of many kinds and both
short-range and long-range psychological coun
seling. The psychiatric staff of the Cowell
Health Center is available for psychiatric con
sultation and some forms of therapy, and pa
tients in need of long-range therapy are re
ferred to psychiatrists in the School of Medi
cine for it.
The Committee has no wish to enter into the
relative merits of these two approaches, be
lieving that both meet various kinds of situ
ations helpfully. The liaison between the Conn

soling and Testing Center and the Cowell
Health reportedly good and getting
better. Such liaison and cooperation should be
encouraged by the University administration.
The fact that a relatively small proportion of
Stanford students uses the counseling services
in these two institutions may be an index of
the community's relatively healthy mental
state. On the other hand, experience hÂ°re and
in other universities would seem to indicate
that there are many more problems than are
actually met by these services. Larger staffs
would doubtless encourage more students with
real problems to seek aid.
It has been rightly observed that while any
person lacks the medical or psychological
help he needs, the job of counseling is not be
ing properly done. One of our faculty col
leagues recently stated that "One student sui
cide per year is one too many," a sentiment
with which no one could quarrel. But preven
tion in the realm of counseling is the most
difficult task. For one thing, it requires the
willing cooperation of the patient or subject.
The continued excellence and improvement
of these two services seems to the Committee,
however, a matter of rather high priority. We
are in a period where the mental strains upon
the age group of Stanford students are great
and on the increase. It is no pampering mood
that leads to the conclusion that professional
aid is needed; it is rather the sense of urgency
that informs higher education, and the wish
that barriers to the best education every stu
dent is capable of absorbing be as far as possi
ble thrown down. We do not believe that the
improvement of, say, the Counseling and Test
ing Center is more important than the im
provement of the faculty. But believing in the
priority of the academic, we wish it to be aided
by the best medical and psychological services
Stanford can afford to render.
We have few specific recommendations,
apart from general improvementâ€”which In
itself ought not to be taken as underhanded
criticism. The first contact with the Counsel
ing and Testing Center ought to make clear
to entering students that genuine personal
counsel may be had there. We are dubious
that the orientation-week testing is a good in
troduction for students, valuable as the re
sults may be for staff research. The counsel
ing function should be made more distinct
from that of legitimate research.
The most difficult question with which the
Committee has long wrestled is how to be
sure that the people who need the help receive
it. To that question, we have no satisfactory
answer. The availability of the services should
b" widely publicized and accurately described.
Every member of the University should know
about them. But the person who refuses to
seek help when he needs it can not, by any
means the Committee has been able to discov
er, be forced to have it.
The Committee notes with satisfaction the
recent improvements in the situation of reli
gious ministries on the campus. Although not
every religious tradition is officially repre
sented, persons desiring counseling of a reli
gious sort have access to a broad range of
clergymen and denominational representatives.
Since campus office space was made available
to denominational representatives, the work
of the Pean of the Chapel and his assistant
and of the University Chaplain has been en
larged by cooperation. To those who doubt the
propriety of the presence of clergymen on a
university campus, the Committee would say
that the day when religious bodies looked on
the ministry to students as a salvage operation
from the godless university is long past. Safe
guards against irresponsibility in this as in
other areas of interest can be established ad
ministratively. Those members of the Univer
sity who find religious counsel helpful and nec
essary can and do seek it out.
By virtue of the fact that Selective Service
is of immediate concern to the majority of
Stanford students, the Committee has consid
ered advising facilities offered regarding the
draft. A National Service Adviser has for
some time been available. The Committee ap
plauds the addition of a counselor on con
scientious objection to the student facilities
available on campus. We anticipate that such
an office will be continued while the question
of the draft is pertinent, and suggest that the
amount of student need for such counsel re
quires the availability of more time than is
now provided. The different natures of the
counseling involved makes it advisable to keep
separate the conscientious objection counsel
ing and National Service advising. Greater co
ordination of the latter with the ROTC offices
and the Placement Service would facilitate the
answering of questions faced by many stu
dents in regard to the options available for
fulfillment of military service. However, the
effectiveness of both offices is hampered at
present by lack of information reaching the
student. Publicizing these services in the hand
book to the University proposed above, and by
whatever means are now available, and the
initiation of orientation sessions with tutors,
residence assistants, and directors may begin
to alleviate this inadequacy.
The Placement Service is kept until last be
cause the Committee believes substantial ex
pansion is possible and desirable. At present
the Placement Service is a means to bring
prospective employees into contact with pros
pective employers and to aid students to re
ceive part-time and summer jobs. With ex
pense (the Committee does not wish to guess
how much* and reorganization, the Placement
Service could become a Career Guidance Cen
ter. This change would put job interviews into
perspective as aspects of a more thorough in
vestigation by the individual of his wishes and
talents for a career. Facilities for aptitude
tests of various kinds would be needed, as well
as staff to process and counsel regarding such
tests. For this purpose, it would he well to
shift the efforts in career counseling now car
ried on by the Counseling and Testing Center
to an expanded Career Guidance Center. Infor

mation on opportunities and requisites for ca
reers of many kinds could conveniently be
gathered and sometimes produced by a Career
Guidance Center, and one might expect to find
in it the current catalogues of graduate and
professional schools across the country.
It has often been remarked that, for all the
Founders' desires that a Stanford education
should fit students for useful pursuits, the ac
cessibility of career counsel is rather slim
hÂ°re. In feeling that the situation bears im
provement the Committee does not imply that
every student should have made a clear voca
tional choice by the end of his senior year. But
students wishing to make informed and ra
tional choices of careers should have access as
early as possible to information and individual
ized counsel regarding the options. A Career
Guidance Center might have the contacts to
place students in part-time and temporary
jobs with persons in careers that the students
are considering, experience which might be
invaluable whether it be positive or negative.
Other methods of gaining insight into vari
ous kinds of professional life may likewise
gain momentum. A proposal now being con
sidered suggests the establishment of sopho
more and higher level courses on the profes
sions, taught from the perspectives of both
the humanities and the social sciences. Such
courses would be informational and descriptive
and in no sense recruitment techniques. Still
other means might be found to make available
for students bases for wise career decisions.
The present admirable advising done by facul
ty members of the School of Medicine with
and for pre-medical students could profitably
be emulated elsewhere. Could not the Schools
of Law, Business, and Education, for example,
provide similar counsel in cooperation with a
Career Guidance Center? The Committee pre
sumes that remuneration occupations will for
some time be necessary for most members of
American society. There is point, therefore, to
the thought that education can be useful, even
though that is far from being the whole point
of education.
111. Academic
Advising
If personal counseling is very largely done
casually and by amateurs, so is academic ad
vising. Most of the advising done at Stanford
is done by one undergraduate to another. The
Committee heartily approves this state of af
fairs at the same time that it is not satisfied
to abandon faculty advising.
Student Advising. Several aspects of under
graduate advising are carried by undergradu
ates. Students get their best information about
the value of specific courses from other stu
dents who have taken them. This is only natu
ral. Faculty members are loath to comment
on their colleagues, for reasons of professional
propriety; students are not. Moreover, faculty
members can talk about courses taught by
their colleagues only by hearsay, where stu
dents can speak at first hand. Such informal
advising is valuable, even though it is fre
quently biased. Sporadic attempts have been
made to bring it usefully into published form,
with such documents as the Course Review,
succeeding the earlier "Scratch Sheet." The
Committee applauds the concept of a student
Course Review as a valuable asset to advising,
and wishes that it might be thorough in its
coverage of courses, representative of a varie
ty of student reactions, and sensitive to stated
aims of professors in courses. Such a review
would also inform professors helpfully about
responses to the courses. The Course Review
ought to appear regularly, with cooperation
and financial assistance from the University
but without administrative control.
A recent experiment in appointing students
as advisers-at-large in their major departments
produced uncertain results. The fault may lie
partially in a lack of information about the
program, in student suspicion that student
advisers would be "administration types," in
students' feelings that they could get as good
advice from their friendsâ€”or in any possible
combination of those and other factors. The
Committee is not satisfied that student de
partmental advising is a bad idea, especially
on the basis of one year's experiment in three
departments. It exhorts departments and
schools to keep trying to find ways of taking
advantage of students' advising abilities.
The function of the adviser. We have already
expressed the Committee's suggestion that ad
vising not be simply a matter of policing, of
making sure that the student has information
and is taking the courses he is required to
take. The Adviser's Handbook describes the
goal of advising as bringing "the student to
the point where he can assume a maximum
amount of responsibility for his own academic
program and can make wise decisions on his
own" (p. 12). The Committee wishes to go be
yond that to propose that the adviser be
viewed both by the student and by himself as
the student's academic advocate, the particular
educator who agrees to concern himself with
his advisee's best education. This means prin
cipally that the adviser wishes to help the
student plan an educational career that goes
somewhere, that has coherence and point to it,
rather than being a miscellaneous collection
of requirements and aimless electives. If the
adviser is the student's advocate, however, this
coherence must be a means of enabling the
student's wishes and strengths to be embodied
in his program, not a way for the adviser to
impose his own concepts on the student.
Such a concept would, to he sure, produce
advising that takes more time, for carefully
considering with a student his academic ob
jectives and intellectual curiosities consumes
more time that simply signing his card. But if
such advising is understood and underscored
by tin 1 faculty as integral 1o education, faculty
members may more happily engage in it. It

poses several problems, among which is the
acceptance of advising as a normal aspect of
academic appointment at Stanford. If such
advising will not be done by the faculty, some
one must do it. In the absence of good faculty
advising, a corps of professional advisers
would probably have to be retained to the dam
age of the budget and of the academic exper
tise with which advising ought to be done. On
all counts, the Committee emphatically prefers
faculty advising.
The student's stake in advising. A curious
duality is sometimes to be observed among
students. On the one hand, they firmly ob
ject to be treated as ciphers or as children by
an institution standing in loco parentis. On
the other .they wish the advice of their elders
among the faculty, and this wish is sometimes
Indistinguishable from a desire for a parent
surrogate. Occasionally, when the advice given
is not to an individual's liking, he will pro
test that he is not being respected. We point
this out in part to say that the students' own
view of their stake in advising is not crystal
clear.
Although the student knows more about
himself than any adviser is ever likely to
know, he needs advising because he has not
enough experience of education to know pre
cisely how to join his interests and talents
to a curricular regimen. This observation ap
plies equally, though in different perspectives,
to undergraduates and graduate students. The
student looks to an adviser for guidance in
pursuing an education that will take ad
vantage of his interests and lead him beyond
his own provincial boundaries, at the same
time that it is certifiable by the University as
meeting its standards. The University, of
course, must determine what those standards
are, since it is the body doing the certifying.
The adviser stands toward the student in the
peculiar position of being at once a represen
tative of the University's power of sanction
upon the student (he makes judgments on stu
dents' performance) and and the advocate of
that particula student in the acquisition of his
most effective education.
If the structure of degree requirements on
the graduate level becomes less prescriptive,
the premium on interested advising which
aids the student toward coherence as well as
adventuresomeness will rise. Experience will
count for much in a student's planning, al
though it should not be prescriptively applied.
What is at stake for the student in a more flex
ible under-graduate program is precisely the
humanity of an adviser who is genuinely the
student's educational advocate. If the program
is flexible, advocacy need not consist in find
ing ways to circumvent regulations.
The levels of advising and their problems.
Special and different problems of advising ob
tain for freshmen, transfers, upperclass un
dergraduates and departmental majors, and
graduate students. At the same time, the Com
mittee is convinced of one true observation:
the best advising takes place where advisee
and adviser have some kind of common bond,
beyond the routine. This may be the bond of
the same field of study (the normal pre-set
bond between graduate students and faculty),
some common experience (frequently that the
student has taken the faculty member's
course), or prior acquaintance.
From this standpoint, the advising of fresh
men is the most difficult task, for freshmen
rarely have any existing bond to a faculty
member. It must be established. The Commit
tee has been divided upon several possible ways
to handle freshman advising. That the faculty
should carry the bulk of the advising seems
wise, yet a student's assigned adviser only
rarely turns out to be important or helpful
to him. As the freshman year curriculum now
stands, freshmen rarely come into close con
tact with faculty members, except those al
-most as transient as themselves: English
TA's, Western Civ instructors, lab TA's, and
beginning math and language TA's. The In
crease of Freshman seminars may improve
the range of faculty contact. The plans of
assigning advisers to groups in living units
has been extremely spotty in its effectiveness,
and it suffers from the fact that the advisers
remain abstractly faculty members, rather
than being perceived in their active teaching
roles. Relationships of freshman to faculty
residents or directors of living units, to tutors,
and to sponsors are relatively close, and these
persons in fact do the bulk of freshman ad
vising. The Trancos experiment is one possible
model of freshman advising, where residence
director, sponsors and tutors, and a team of
faculty advisers work closely together. Fresh
man advising ought to aid in the orientation
of the entering student, j.etting him off on the
right foot, proposing seriously that he identify
areas of genuine intellectual interest. Such
advising should prepare the student to find
a permanent academic adviser as he goes.
The Committee is unanimous in suggesting
that advising will become more effective from
all sides if the student ultimately chooses his
own adviser. In fact this frequently happens
now, except that the adviser whom the stu
dent chooses is often not the one responsible
for signing his card. We see the following
arguments in favor of this idea: 1. The stu
dent will most likely choose a faculty mem
ber whom he has seen in action, knows some
thing of his qualities and the "cut of his jib."
2. Such a relationship would underscore the
obligation of both student and adviser for
tion in which the student is interested and
tion In which the student is interested an
which makes coherent academic sense of his
interests and career plans. (The Committee
believes, parenthetically, that changing ad
visers and programs ought to be quite easy,
with no prejudice attached to it.) 3. If the
structure of the freshman year becomes less
prescribed, freshmen will have access to a
broader range of course options and of faculty
members than is now the case and will be
more likely to identify someone with whom
they believe they can work.
Certain problems with this arrangement can
be foreseen. 1. Some very popular professors
will be swamped with advisees, and other fac
ulty members will have few or none. To this
the Committee would propose that limitations
on the number of advisees per faculty member
be administratively established (see below.) 2.
Understaffed departments will have too many
majors to observe the limitations, and will have
to continue assigning majors to advisers. To
this the Committee proposes that the student's
adviser need not, though he may, be in the stu
dent's own major department. If the adviser is
not charged to keep track of regulations, it is
not at all unlikely that a professor in one de
partment can help a student in another to pur
sue a course that both meets the standards laid
down by the department and satisfies the stu
dent's own academic needs and wants. Depart
ments might require countersignature of study
cards by departmental representatives. Any
student seriously wishing to become a his
torian, for example, will probably try to find
a historian as adviser in order to get help in
preparing to be like him. We recognize that
in some programs, e.g. Philosophy and the
Honors Program in Humanities, the adviser
docs considerable tutoring of the student in
his senior year. This does not seem to us in
compatible with the basic premise. We are in
clined, on the undergraduate level, to resist
departmental "imperialism," which demands
control over "its" students. An undergraduate
major need not, after all, be occupational prep
aration, but, especially in the Humanities and
Social Sciences, is rather a point of co
herence for one's entire liberal education. Stu
dents who wish strong identification with a
discipline or department may gain it by choos
ing advisers there. Students who do not want
such a concentration may be well served by
advisers from almost anywhere in the Uni
versity.
Such a plan would introduce a differentia
tion between freshman and upperclass advis
ing, in place of the present differentiation be
tween General Studies and major advising.
The Committee is inclined to believe that the
former differentiation would make all advis
ing more effective with regard to general ed
ucation. We are not yet agreed as to the time
when a student must have chosen his adviser.
Some might stay with the person to whom they
were assigned as freshmen; others would find
an adviser during the freshman year; still
others during the sophomore year. Some stu
dents might have three or four different ad
visers during their careers. We see no compel
ing reason why that should be forbidden,
though frequent changes may be a signal that
counseling of some kind is needed. As at pres
ent, students will continue to seek out advice
from faculty members whom they like and
trust, no matter who is the officially designated
adviser. The present suggestion is intended to
take advantage of that fact of life.
The advising of graduate students might
seem to be self-evident. No one except grad
uate students themselves seems to feel it a
problem. Some responsibilities which many

departments seem not to handle well with
graduate students are the following: (1) intro
ducing new students to the University; (2) in
forming students about and channeling them,
when need is present, to the Counseling and
Testing Center, Cowell Halth Service, the
Placement Service, etc.; (3) giving students
vocational advice and sometimes placing them;
(4) informing new students about housing pos
sibilities and problems; (5) informing students
about useful training obtainable on a reg
ular basis in other departments. The pro
blem here is different from that of under
graduates in that the graduate student is
earnestly in the process of professional prep
aration. There is a certain emulative aspect to
graduate study, therefore, because many grad
uate students (certainly not nearly 100%) are
working with people with whom they expect
ultimately to become colleagues. It seems to
us probable that at present graduate students
select their own advisers to an extent that un
dergraduate do not. The function of faculty in
attracting graduate students to any university
assures that the potential of full relationships
is present. A stronger administrative surveil
lance of graduate advising might help to over
come the deficiences of individual departments.
Some special problems. Three groups of stu
dents present special problems to which the
Committee does not yet have answers. It is
clear that transfer students could use far bet
ter help on arrival than most of them get. It is
also clear that their problems are different
from those faced by freshman. We believe that
transfer students should bo given high priority
for on-campus housing. It also seems to us
that the evaluation of transfer credits could
be expedited and improved in many ways.
Some faculty members might be especially en
couraged to handle transfer students. We de
sire further suggestions about the advising of
transfer students from anyone with ideas to
give.
Another group of students with problems to
which the Committee has not yet given
sufficient attention is foreign students. The
Beehtel International Center is a source of
remarkably fine personal attention to foreign
students. But this group has academic prob
lems peculiarly their own, and some made of
advising needs, we think, to be tailored to
them. Again, the Committee wishes to be
helped by ideas.
The third group is comprised of members
of minorities with special disadvantages. Ad
vising needs to have cognizance both of the
personal problems faced by such students and
of academic needs. Efforts to provide tutoring
from the Office of Financial Aids have been
sporadic, due largely to stringently limited
funds. Some more formal program of tutoring
and counsel would greatly increase the accessi
bility of an adequate Stanford education for
such students. Stanford has publicly stated its
intention to do the right thing by these per
sons. Additional support, morally and mone
tarily, needs to be provided.
The extent and rewards of advising. The
Committee believes that advising on all levels
should be taken together in figuring the aver
age ratio of advisees to advisers. Taking fig
ures in the fall Student Directory as sub

stantially correct for numbers of majors and
graduate students in the Schools and Depart
ments, and taking a count of faculty at As
sistant Professor or higher in Courses and De
grees as substantially correct (realizing that
many people in the latter are absent on leave),
and assuming that all of those faculty advise
majors and graduate students, we find the fol
lowing ratios by schools of major and grad
uate advisees to advisers:
Earth Sciences 5.8 (169/29)
Engineering 13.4 (2114A58)
Humanities & Sciences 11.7 (4739/405)
The figures for present General Studies ad
vising, however, look rather different. 115
persons are engaged in 1967-68 in General
Studies advising of 2330 students without de
clared majors, a ratio of 20.2G advisees to each
adviser. Sources of General Studies advisers
are as follows:
Earth Sciences 7 (24% of
school faculty)
Engineering 11 (6.9% of
school faculty)
Humanities & Sciences 45 (11.1% of
school faculty)
Medicine 12
Military Science 2
Physical Education 3
Education 2
Administration 33
The figures show the difficulties encountered
by the Registrar in his task of recruiting
General Studies Advisers. Only 63 ( 54.8%) of
present General Studies advisers come from
the faculties of Schools which will enroll the
advisees as majors. Moreover, only 39% of
General Studies advisers come from the School
of Humanities and Sciences, which can rea
sonably expect to enroll about 80% of un
dergraduates.
At the same time, figures received from De
partments of the School of Humanities and
Sciences show a very wide variation in the
actual advising practice of departments. Some
departments average as few as 4 departmental
advisees per adviser, whereas members of
others may have as many as 66 major ad
visees. Such a figure seems to the Committee
a mockery of the very idea of advising.
One can be only routine with that many ad
visees. The Committee is inclined to believe
that an upper limit on the number of allowable
advisees per adviser should be set, perhaps at
25 or 30, such a figure to include both grad
uate and undergraduate students. The Com
mittee also believes that Deans should ask
executive hads of departments quite search
ing questions about provisions for carrying
advising when many members of a depart
ment propose to be on leave for a given year.
One instance has been reported in which a
member of a large department finds himself
during this academic year with 89 advisees
(graduate, undergraduate major, and Gen
eral Studies) because so many of his col
league are absent on leave. If a limit on ad
visees were set and adhered to, such ex
ploitation would not be permitted.
The Committee has thought very hard about
the place of advising in Stanford's status and
reward system for its faculty. At present, save

for one department that claims to adjust Its
teaching loads in proportion to advising loads,
advising is in fact extra-curricular, in that
it is supposed to be done but no one pays
much attention if it is not done. The Commit
tee is informed that advisers receive extra
pay in some universities, and it has discussed
whether bonus pay would be an incentive to
better advising. We are not satisfied that it
would. We have also asked how a faculty
member's advising effectiveness might be a
factor in his promotion and salary increment.
Nothing would please the Committee more
than to be shown a method of accurate evalua
tion of this effectiveness, so that it could be
used as one among other determinants. We
have yet to find a method. Even if the stu
dent were to choose his adviser, one could not
determine the adviser's effectiveness merely
by counting the number of his advisees.
The Committee believes that advising will
be able to play a role in the status and re
ward system only if the faculty becomes so
committed to the advising function (which,
for the Committee, is integral to the educa
tional function) that the very commitment
produces a means of reward. The faculty
must decide that advising is important, and
the faculty at large must expend some energy
in advising. Pressure probably ought to be
exerted on those of our colleagues who would
rather not advise students, although the very
reluctant adviser will likely not be a very
good one. Perhaps, in considerations of reward
and promotion, nothing more than a negative
question can be asked. If a brilliant research
er does no advising, can his research contribu
tions outweigh the absence of his contribu
tion to the University's humanity? In some in
stances, the answer might have to be "No."
So far as the Committee knows, the question
has never been asked.
Advising in the professor's profession. The
Committee has expressed its conviction that
advising students is properly a part of the
educational profession, that such an as
sumption ought if possible to be an element
in consideration of reward. We suggest, more
over, that prospective faculty appointees be
informed of advising obligations of Stanford
faculty members. We would also suggest a
more long-range way of achieving the actuality
of this assumption. It has often been pointed
out that among the weakest aspects of grad
uate education today is the failure to prepare
people for their profession. Graduate students
are trained to do research, but many of them
are hired to be teachers and members of fac
ulties. We do not wish to underplay research.
But too little is done to train those of our grad
uate students who will become teachers for
their actual professional functions. The Com
mittee suggests the advisability of instruc
tion for graduate students in the scope of the
objectives and responsibilities of their chosen
profession, which will help them comprehend
the expectations under which they will work.
Such instruction could go a long way toward
making actual the ideal that professors are
engaged in education, an activity that includes
research and publication, classroom teach
ing, and the education of individual students
outside of formal instruction that advising
ought to be. When education in that sense be
comes the basic assumption of the University's

life, we will be on the way toward the fulfill
ment of our humanity.

Epilogue:
Enablement and
Surveillance
It is hoped that in such a relatively casual
and self selecting system as that proposed
above, the quiet and unspectacular job that
needs to be done will proceed. But responsibili
ty for watching it must be lodged somewhere
more specific than in the hearts and minds of
the 20,000-odd souls of the Stanford commun
ity. There needs to be improved liaison among
agencies, assurance that stated functions are
being fulfilled, exhortation if not pressure
for participation in both given and receiving.
It was suggested, half jocularly, in the Com
mittee that what is wanted is a "University
humane ofTice.'The term is simplistic, but the
thought is precise. To indicate, to itself and
everyone else, that Stanford means its hu
manity, the responsibility should be assumed
by a highly placed officer, of at least Associate
Provost rank, whose responsibilities would in
clude the coordination of advising and coun
seling structures.
The Committee remains uncertain whether
the responsibility should be added to those
carried by the Dean of Students, whether it
should be assigned to a Dean of Undergraduate
Educationâ€”should such a position be rein
statedâ€”or whether a new position should be
created. In favor of the first is the fact that
the Dean of Students is now responsible for
several agencies in which counseling and ad
vising take place. On the other hand, the ed
ucational thrust of the entire program might
suggest that the responsibility be held by a
distinctly academic officer such as a Dean of
Undergraduate Education. At the same time,
the fact that advising and counseling must af
fect graduate as well as undergraduate stu
dents makes desirable that the officer not be
exclusively occupied with undergraduates.
Whoever such a person might be, and what
ever his title, he must be accessible to and
trustable by students, command the respect
and attract the cooperation of the faculty, and
display remarkable virtues to non-academic
staff persons.

This paper is presented to the University
community by the Committee on Advising and
Couast'lint; of the Study of Education at Stan
ford. It is important to say tliat the paper is
intended not as a recommendation for immedi
ate decision hut as some proposals for discus
sion.
Hearings will take place 7 9 p.m. Tuesday
and 4-fi p.m. Wednesday in room 143 of Meyer
Library. Members of the committee will be
present to receive comments on the paper. The
Committee also welcomes written responses to
the SES office, Meyer Library.
Few subjects are so frequently the target of
criticism as advising, few so rarely the object
of constructive suggestion. Widespread agree
ment thai advising is not very well done at
Stanford is equalled by imprecision as to the
problem and feasible solutions. Our realism
breeds cynicism, concluding that we must ac
cept inadequacy.
The Committee on Advising and Counseling
of the Study of Education at Stanford has at
tempted to be realistic but not cynical. Mow
ever unlikely the radical alteration of human
nature may be, the alteration of perspectives
and priorities is well within our reach. The
Committee urges the University's members,
however, that unless assumptions are modi
fied the cynics will he proven right. Foremost
among the assumptions that require adjust
ment is the tacit one that for a faculty mem
ber advising is an extracurricular activity.
This assumption produces hesitance on the
part of many students to consult advisers ex
cept for routine card-signing for fear of "tak
ing up his time," and their resultant complaint
that advising at Stanford is nothing but rou
tine. It produces the perception on the part of
faculty members that advising, except for one's
"own" special (preferably graduate) students,
is a chore to be avoided if possible and to be
disposed of quickly if avoidance is not possible.
It produces among administrators complete ig
norance of inequities in advising loads and the
ignoring of the function of advising in con
siderations of appointment, promotion, and re
ward.
The Committee is not so blindered as to sup
pose that advising is the most important as
pect of university life. But it is sensitive to
the penetration of aspects of advising into al
most everything Stanford does, from admis
sions to residence policy to undergraduate and
graduate curriculum to student services to the
extra-curriculum to placement and vocational
decisions. In what follows we have made some
assumption that bear explication. First, we
suppose that advising has basically to do with
the possibility of significant relations and com
munication between persons, that it sums up
what we intend by our sub-title: "the humani
ty of the University." Second, we assume that
the educational direction Stanford is taking
will entail more advising, not less, on both
graduate and undergraduate levels, and a high
er degree of humanity, not a lower. Third, we
assume that, since no system is perfect, an ar
rangement of advising that allows several
quite different forms and structures of advis
ing to take place will come closer to self-re
newal than a single, potentially rigid system.
The problem, as we presently see it, has
three points of focus: 1. the dissemination to
everyone who needs it of accurate and com
plete information; 2. the availability to anyone
who needs it of competent professional coun
seling; 3. the accessibility to all students of
Interested and personal academic advice.
I. Dissemination
of Information
The story about the man who did not have
enough information to take instruction is rele
vant to the problem of advising. The Commit
tee believes that adequate and accurate infor
mation on most matters regarding the Univer
sity is readily available to those who wish and
need to have it. Ignorance and misinformation
are widespread, however, some of it difficult
to understand.
The information that needs dissemination is
that which makes possible (1) awareness on
the part of faculty and students alike of exact
ly what the University's communal and aca
demic facilities are; (2) access by members of
the University to the various services provid
ed; (3) informed decisions about academic
matters on the part of students.
A great deal of this information can be and
is conveyed in print, but people forget things
when they read them in almost unnumerable
bulletins, pamphlets, brochures, hand-bills, mi
meographed or dittoed sheets, and the like.
The variety is compounded by the fact that
certain published materials are factual in na
ture and others are more propagandists in
tone and purpose, by the fact that some infor
mation is obsolete before it is ever printed and
some is incomplete.
The Committee suggests basic simplification
into two yearly publications. One is an expand
ed version of the present rather slim Informa
tion Bulletin, to serve as a more general hand
book to the University. Here should be de
tailed information on matters not covered in
Courses and Degrees: fees and expenses, resi
dences, relatively permanent organizations and
activities both student and University-wide,
services available to the community such as
those of the Health Service, the Counseling
and Testing Center, the Bechtel International
Center, and others. Also in such a handbook
might be found brief descriptions of the ad
ministrative operation of the University, the
duties and powers of its various officers, and
policies affecting various of its members.
Through such a publication, which should be
routinely in the hands of everyone, both stu
dents and faculty could find how to get help
for all kinds of problems. New students and
new faculty members in particular would, with

its aid, more easily find their ways in the Uni
versity.
Parenthetically, the Committee also sees a
need for a faculty handbook, which would in
form faculty members of such policies of ap
pointment, promotion, tenure, and administra
tive arrangement as are especially relevant to
them.
The Committee wishes, moreover, that Cour
ses and I)egre<>s might he improved. The in
formation in it is frequently obsolete before
the book comes off the press. Might there not
be in the den of someone at Stanford printing
methods that could reduce the lag between
copy deadlines and publication? Would the
improvement of accuracy allowed by an Aug
ust publication date outweigh the advantage
for incoming students of the present May pub
lication? Students and advisers alike now hesi
tate to use Courses and Degrees as a basis
for planning the work of even a single year in
advance. The Committee wonders, then, wheth
er usefulness for planning to those already
here should not have priority over usefulness
for those about to come. In the light of the in
creasing need for advanced academic planning
by students, greater accuracy becomes even
more desirable. Moreover, if Courses and De
grees wore improved and up-dated, the expense
of the quarterly Time Schedule might be re
duced by making it no more than a supple
ment to Courses and Degrees.
All of these publications would bo of im
mense help to advisers and their advisees. The
Committee is of the opinion that the adviser's
function should not be to disseminate informa
tion that the student can more readily receive
otherwise. In saying that, we take full cog
nizance of the high likelihood that anything in
print will be misunderstood, misconstrued, or
misused somewhere by someone. Where the
adviser perceives ignorance, he must, of
course, rectify itâ€”and the student may do the
same. The adviser will function well with an
advisee when both have the necessary infor
mation, for then the adviser is free to advise
instead of merely to inform.
Concomitantly, the Committee believes that
the adviser should be relieved of policing cur
ricular regulations. So much of academic ad
vising is taken up with routine questions about
the fulfillment of requirements (How many
units of Science have you left to take? How
much math? etc.) that time for genuine and
personalized advice is too often at a premium.
The Committee has a hunch, moreover, (1)
that on the whole students know the require
ments in General Studies and in major pro
grams better than their advisers do, and (2)
that students almost always know exactly
where they stand with regard to those require
ments. The Committee wonders about the feas
ibility of computerizing information of these
kinds to enable easy retrieval. If machines can
free us for the improvement of our humanity,
we should by all means use them.
In short, the Committee believes that advis
ing could be far better focussed on advice if
the dissemination of information were both
simplified and improved, so that the adviser
does not have to be a traffic cop of regulations.
11. Availability
of Counseling
For clarity of terminology, we use the term
"counseling" to mean the impartation of help
for problems of a personal sort, not immediate
ly involving the academic, while "advising" is
restricted in this paper to academic advice.
It is certainly the case that a great deal of
counseling in this sense occurs in any commu
nity as large and as complex as Stanford. Most
of it is casual, among close friends, and with
no pretense of professional expertise. This
sort of counseling will happen whether the
institution encourages or discourages it. Any
attempt to structure such relationships is, of
course, doomed to failure. Faculty members
also do a great deal of counseling of this kind.
Though some may criticize the non-profession
al nature of such counseling, that may in itself
bo one of the'strengths of the relationship. At
the same time, situations frequently arise
where professional counseling is needed and
any casual counselor should always have in
mind the possibility of referring someone to
sources of professional aid. The Committee has
not conceived of any way by which faculty or
other such occasional counselors might cus
tomarily be taught how to recognize danger
signals, but they should be aware of an obli
gation to suggest referral.
Nevertheless, sources of professional coun
seling are present at Stanford, and the Com
mittee has been surprise that some members
of the University, both faculty and students,
seem unaware of them. Apart from the coun
seling done in residences < faculty residents,
residence directors, resident assistants, tutors,
and sponsors), which would have to be called
at best semi-professional, counseling done by
campus religious representatives, and that
done in special circumstances by persons in
the Dean of Students' office, the University
maintains two major sources of professional
counseling and a third that might become one.
We refer in the first instance to the Counsel
ing and Testing Center and to the psychiatric
services of the Cowell Health Center, and in
the second instance to the Placement Service.
The Counseling and Testing Center provides
psychological testing of many kinds and both
short-range and long-range psychological coun
seling. The psychiatric staff of the Cowell
Health Center is available for psychiatric con
sultation and some forms of therapy, and pa
tients in need of long-range therapy are re
ferred to psychiatrists in the School of Medi
cine for it.
The Committee has no wish to enter into the
relative merits of these two approaches, be
lieving that both meet various kinds of situ
ations helpfully. The liaison between the Conn

soling and Testing Center and the Cowell
Health reportedly good and getting
better. Such liaison and cooperation should be
encouraged by the University administration.
The fact that a relatively small proportion of
Stanford students uses the counseling services
in these two institutions may be an index of
the community's relatively healthy mental
state. On the other hand, experience hÂ°re and
in other universities would seem to indicate
that there are many more problems than are
actually met by these services. Larger staffs
would doubtless encourage more students with
real problems to seek aid.
It has been rightly observed that while any
person lacks the medical or psychological
help he needs, the job of counseling is not be
ing properly done. One of our faculty col
leagues recently stated that "One student sui
cide per year is one too many," a sentiment
with which no one could quarrel. But preven
tion in the realm of counseling is the most
difficult task. For one thing, it requires the
willing cooperation of the patient or subject.
The continued excellence and improvement
of these two services seems to the Committee,
however, a matter of rather high priority. We
are in a period where the mental strains upon
the age group of Stanford students are great
and on the increase. It is no pampering mood
that leads to the conclusion that professional
aid is needed; it is rather the sense of urgency
that informs higher education, and the wish
that barriers to the best education every stu
dent is capable of absorbing be as far as possi
ble thrown down. We do not believe that the
improvement of, say, the Counseling and Test
ing Center is more important than the im
provement of the faculty. But believing in the
priority of the academic, we wish it to be aided
by the best medical and psychological services
Stanford can afford to render.
We have few specific recommendations,
apart from general improvementâ€”which In
itself ought not to be taken as underhanded
criticism. The first contact with the Counsel
ing and Testing Center ought to make clear
to entering students that genuine personal
counsel may be had there. We are dubious
that the orientation-week testing is a good in
troduction for students, valuable as the re
sults may be for staff research. The counsel
ing function should be made more distinct
from that of legitimate research.
The most difficult question with which the
Committee has long wrestled is how to be
sure that the people who need the help receive
it. To that question, we have no satisfactory
answer. The availability of the services should
b" widely publicized and accurately described.
Every member of the University should know
about them. But the person who refuses to
seek help when he needs it can not, by any
means the Committee has been able to discov
er, be forced to have it.
The Committee notes with satisfaction the
recent improvements in the situation of reli
gious ministries on the campus. Although not
every religious tradition is officially repre
sented, persons desiring counseling of a reli
gious sort have access to a broad range of
clergymen and denominational representatives.
Since campus office space was made available
to denominational representatives, the work
of the Pean of the Chapel and his assistant
and of the University Chaplain has been en
larged by cooperation. To those who doubt the
propriety of the presence of clergymen on a
university campus, the Committee would say
that the day when religious bodies looked on
the ministry to students as a salvage operation
from the godless university is long past. Safe
guards against irresponsibility in this as in
other areas of interest can be established ad
ministratively. Those members of the Univer
sity who find religious counsel helpful and nec
essary can and do seek it out.
By virtue of the fact that Selective Service
is of immediate concern to the majority of
Stanford students, the Committee has consid
ered advising facilities offered regarding the
draft. A National Service Adviser has for
some time been available. The Committee ap
plauds the addition of a counselor on con
scientious objection to the student facilities
available on campus. We anticipate that such
an office will be continued while the question
of the draft is pertinent, and suggest that the
amount of student need for such counsel re
quires the availability of more time than is
now provided. The different natures of the
counseling involved makes it advisable to keep
separate the conscientious objection counsel
ing and National Service advising. Greater co
ordination of the latter with the ROTC offices
and the Placement Service would facilitate the
answering of questions faced by many stu
dents in regard to the options available for
fulfillment of military service. However, the
effectiveness of both offices is hampered at
present by lack of information reaching the
student. Publicizing these services in the hand
book to the University proposed above, and by
whatever means are now available, and the
initiation of orientation sessions with tutors,
residence assistants, and directors may begin
to alleviate this inadequacy.
The Placement Service is kept until last be
cause the Committee believes substantial ex
pansion is possible and desirable. At present
the Placement Service is a means to bring
prospective employees into contact with pros
pective employers and to aid students to re
ceive part-time and summer jobs. With ex
pense (the Committee does not wish to guess
how much* and reorganization, the Placement
Service could become a Career Guidance Cen
ter. This change would put job interviews into
perspective as aspects of a more thorough in
vestigation by the individual of his wishes and
talents for a career. Facilities for aptitude
tests of various kinds would be needed, as well
as staff to process and counsel regarding such
tests. For this purpose, it would he well to
shift the efforts in career counseling now car
ried on by the Counseling and Testing Center
to an expanded Career Guidance Center. Infor

mation on opportunities and requisites for ca
reers of many kinds could conveniently be
gathered and sometimes produced by a Career
Guidance Center, and one might expect to find
in it the current catalogues of graduate and
professional schools across the country.
It has often been remarked that, for all the
Founders' desires that a Stanford education
should fit students for useful pursuits, the ac
cessibility of career counsel is rather slim
hÂ°re. In feeling that the situation bears im
provement the Committee does not imply that
every student should have made a clear voca
tional choice by the end of his senior year. But
students wishing to make informed and ra
tional choices of careers should have access as
early as possible to information and individual
ized counsel regarding the options. A Career
Guidance Center might have the contacts to
place students in part-time and temporary
jobs with persons in careers that the students
are considering, experience which might be
invaluable whether it be positive or negative.
Other methods of gaining insight into vari
ous kinds of professional life may likewise
gain momentum. A proposal now being con
sidered suggests the establishment of sopho
more and higher level courses on the profes
sions, taught from the perspectives of both
the humanities and the social sciences. Such
courses would be informational and descriptive
and in no sense recruitment techniques. Still
other means might be found to make available
for students bases for wise career decisions.
The present admirable advising done by facul
ty members of the School of Medicine with
and for pre-medical students could profitably
be emulated elsewhere. Could not the Schools
of Law, Business, and Education, for example,
provide similar counsel in cooperation with a
Career Guidance Center? The Committee pre
sumes that remuneration occupations will for
some time be necessary for most members of
American society. There is point, therefore, to
the thought that education can be useful, even
though that is far from being the whole point
of education.
111. Academic
Advising
If personal counseling is very largely done
casually and by amateurs, so is academic ad
vising. Most of the advising done at Stanford
is done by one undergraduate to another. The
Committee heartily approves this state of af
fairs at the same time that it is not satisfied
to abandon faculty advising.
Student Advising. Several aspects of under
graduate advising are carried by undergradu
ates. Students get their best information about
the value of specific courses from other stu
dents who have taken them. This is only natu
ral. Faculty members are loath to comment
on their colleagues, for reasons of professional
propriety; students are not. Moreover, faculty
members can talk about courses taught by
their colleagues only by hearsay, where stu
dents can speak at first hand. Such informal
advising is valuable, even though it is fre
quently biased. Sporadic attempts have been
made to bring it usefully into published form,
with such documents as the Course Review,
succeeding the earlier "Scratch Sheet." The
Committee applauds the concept of a student
Course Review as a valuable asset to advising,
and wishes that it might be thorough in its
coverage of courses, representative of a varie
ty of student reactions, and sensitive to stated
aims of professors in courses. Such a review
would also inform professors helpfully about
responses to the courses. The Course Review
ought to appear regularly, with cooperation
and financial assistance from the University
but without administrative control.
A recent experiment in appointing students
as advisers-at-large in their major departments
produced uncertain results. The fault may lie
partially in a lack of information about the
program, in student suspicion that student
advisers would be "administration types," in
students' feelings that they could get as good
advice from their friendsâ€”or in any possible
combination of those and other factors. The
Committee is not satisfied that student de
partmental advising is a bad idea, especially
on the basis of one year's experiment in three
departments. It exhorts departments and
schools to keep trying to find ways of taking
advantage of students' advising abilities.
The function of the adviser. We have already
expressed the Committee's suggestion that ad
vising not be simply a matter of policing, of
making sure that the student has information
and is taking the courses he is required to
take. The Adviser's Handbook describes the
goal of advising as bringing "the student to
the point where he can assume a maximum
amount of responsibility for his own academic
program and can make wise decisions on his
own" (p. 12). The Committee wishes to go be
yond that to propose that the adviser be
viewed both by the student and by himself as
the student's academic advocate, the particular
educator who agrees to concern himself with
his advisee's best education. This means prin
cipally that the adviser wishes to help the
student plan an educational career that goes
somewhere, that has coherence and point to it,
rather than being a miscellaneous collection
of requirements and aimless electives. If the
adviser is the student's advocate, however, this
coherence must be a means of enabling the
student's wishes and strengths to be embodied
in his program, not a way for the adviser to
impose his own concepts on the student.
Such a concept would, to he sure, produce
advising that takes more time, for carefully
considering with a student his academic ob
jectives and intellectual curiosities consumes
more time that simply signing his card. But if
such advising is understood and underscored
by tin 1 faculty as integral 1o education, faculty
members may more happily engage in it. It

poses several problems, among which is the
acceptance of advising as a normal aspect of
academic appointment at Stanford. If such
advising will not be done by the faculty, some
one must do it. In the absence of good faculty
advising, a corps of professional advisers
would probably have to be retained to the dam
age of the budget and of the academic exper
tise with which advising ought to be done. On
all counts, the Committee emphatically prefers
faculty advising.
The student's stake in advising. A curious
duality is sometimes to be observed among
students. On the one hand, they firmly ob
ject to be treated as ciphers or as children by
an institution standing in loco parentis. On
the other .they wish the advice of their elders
among the faculty, and this wish is sometimes
Indistinguishable from a desire for a parent
surrogate. Occasionally, when the advice given
is not to an individual's liking, he will pro
test that he is not being respected. We point
this out in part to say that the students' own
view of their stake in advising is not crystal
clear.
Although the student knows more about
himself than any adviser is ever likely to
know, he needs advising because he has not
enough experience of education to know pre
cisely how to join his interests and talents
to a curricular regimen. This observation ap
plies equally, though in different perspectives,
to undergraduates and graduate students. The
student looks to an adviser for guidance in
pursuing an education that will take ad
vantage of his interests and lead him beyond
his own provincial boundaries, at the same
time that it is certifiable by the University as
meeting its standards. The University, of
course, must determine what those standards
are, since it is the body doing the certifying.
The adviser stands toward the student in the
peculiar position of being at once a represen
tative of the University's power of sanction
upon the student (he makes judgments on stu
dents' performance) and and the advocate of
that particula student in the acquisition of his
most effective education.
If the structure of degree requirements on
the graduate level becomes less prescriptive,
the premium on interested advising which
aids the student toward coherence as well as
adventuresomeness will rise. Experience will
count for much in a student's planning, al
though it should not be prescriptively applied.
What is at stake for the student in a more flex
ible under-graduate program is precisely the
humanity of an adviser who is genuinely the
student's educational advocate. If the program
is flexible, advocacy need not consist in find
ing ways to circumvent regulations.
The levels of advising and their problems.
Special and different problems of advising ob
tain for freshmen, transfers, upperclass un
dergraduates and departmental majors, and
graduate students. At the same time, the Com
mittee is convinced of one true observation:
the best advising takes place where advisee
and adviser have some kind of common bond,
beyond the routine. This may be the bond of
the same field of study (the normal pre-set
bond between graduate students and faculty),
some common experience (frequently that the
student has taken the faculty member's
course), or prior acquaintance.
From this standpoint, the advising of fresh
men is the most difficult task, for freshmen
rarely have any existing bond to a faculty
member. It must be established. The Commit
tee has been divided upon several possible ways
to handle freshman advising. That the faculty
should carry the bulk of the advising seems
wise, yet a student's assigned adviser only
rarely turns out to be important or helpful
to him. As the freshman year curriculum now
stands, freshmen rarely come into close con
tact with faculty members, except those al
-most as transient as themselves: English
TA's, Western Civ instructors, lab TA's, and
beginning math and language TA's. The In
crease of Freshman seminars may improve
the range of faculty contact. The plans of
assigning advisers to groups in living units
has been extremely spotty in its effectiveness,
and it suffers from the fact that the advisers
remain abstractly faculty members, rather
than being perceived in their active teaching
roles. Relationships of freshman to faculty
residents or directors of living units, to tutors,
and to sponsors are relatively close, and these
persons in fact do the bulk of freshman ad
vising. The Trancos experiment is one possible
model of freshman advising, where residence
director, sponsors and tutors, and a team of
faculty advisers work closely together. Fresh
man advising ought to aid in the orientation
of the entering student, j.etting him off on the
right foot, proposing seriously that he identify
areas of genuine intellectual interest. Such
advising should prepare the student to find
a permanent academic adviser as he goes.
The Committee is unanimous in suggesting
that advising will become more effective from
all sides if the student ultimately chooses his
own adviser. In fact this frequently happens
now, except that the adviser whom the stu
dent chooses is often not the one responsible
for signing his card. We see the following
arguments in favor of this idea: 1. The stu
dent will most likely choose a faculty mem
ber whom he has seen in action, knows some
thing of his qualities and the "cut of his jib."
2. Such a relationship would underscore the
obligation of both student and adviser for
tion in which the student is interested and
tion In which the student is interested an
which makes coherent academic sense of his
interests and career plans. (The Committee
believes, parenthetically, that changing ad
visers and programs ought to be quite easy,
with no prejudice attached to it.) 3. If the
structure of the freshman year becomes less
prescribed, freshmen will have access to a
broader range of course options and of faculty
members than is now the case and will be
more likely to identify someone with whom
they believe they can work.
Certain problems with this arrangement can
be foreseen. 1. Some very popular professors
will be swamped with advisees, and other fac
ulty members will have few or none. To this
the Committee would propose that limitations
on the number of advisees per faculty member
be administratively established (see below.) 2.
Understaffed departments will have too many
majors to observe the limitations, and will have
to continue assigning majors to advisers. To
this the Committee proposes that the student's
adviser need not, though he may, be in the stu
dent's own major department. If the adviser is
not charged to keep track of regulations, it is
not at all unlikely that a professor in one de
partment can help a student in another to pur
sue a course that both meets the standards laid
down by the department and satisfies the stu
dent's own academic needs and wants. Depart
ments might require countersignature of study
cards by departmental representatives. Any
student seriously wishing to become a his
torian, for example, will probably try to find
a historian as adviser in order to get help in
preparing to be like him. We recognize that
in some programs, e.g. Philosophy and the
Honors Program in Humanities, the adviser
docs considerable tutoring of the student in
his senior year. This does not seem to us in
compatible with the basic premise. We are in
clined, on the undergraduate level, to resist
departmental "imperialism," which demands
control over "its" students. An undergraduate
major need not, after all, be occupational prep
aration, but, especially in the Humanities and
Social Sciences, is rather a point of co
herence for one's entire liberal education. Stu
dents who wish strong identification with a
discipline or department may gain it by choos
ing advisers there. Students who do not want
such a concentration may be well served by
advisers from almost anywhere in the Uni
versity.
Such a plan would introduce a differentia
tion between freshman and upperclass advis
ing, in place of the present differentiation be
tween General Studies and major advising.
The Committee is inclined to believe that the
former differentiation would make all advis
ing more effective with regard to general ed
ucation. We are not yet agreed as to the time
when a student must have chosen his adviser.
Some might stay with the person to whom they
were assigned as freshmen; others would find
an adviser during the freshman year; still
others during the sophomore year. Some stu
dents might have three or four different ad
visers during their careers. We see no compel
ing reason why that should be forbidden,
though frequent changes may be a signal that
counseling of some kind is needed. As at pres
ent, students will continue to seek out advice
from faculty members whom they like and
trust, no matter who is the officially designated
adviser. The present suggestion is intended to
take advantage of that fact of life.
The advising of graduate students might
seem to be self-evident. No one except grad
uate students themselves seems to feel it a
problem. Some responsibilities which many

departments seem not to handle well with
graduate students are the following: (1) intro
ducing new students to the University; (2) in
forming students about and channeling them,
when need is present, to the Counseling and
Testing Center, Cowell Halth Service, the
Placement Service, etc.; (3) giving students
vocational advice and sometimes placing them;
(4) informing new students about housing pos
sibilities and problems; (5) informing students
about useful training obtainable on a reg
ular basis in other departments. The pro
blem here is different from that of under
graduates in that the graduate student is
earnestly in the process of professional prep
aration. There is a certain emulative aspect to
graduate study, therefore, because many grad
uate students (certainly not nearly 100%) are
working with people with whom they expect
ultimately to become colleagues. It seems to
us probable that at present graduate students
select their own advisers to an extent that un
dergraduate do not. The function of faculty in
attracting graduate students to any university
assures that the potential of full relationships
is present. A stronger administrative surveil
lance of graduate advising might help to over
come the deficiences of individual departments.
Some special problems. Three groups of stu
dents present special problems to which the
Committee does not yet have answers. It is
clear that transfer students could use far bet
ter help on arrival than most of them get. It is
also clear that their problems are different
from those faced by freshman. We believe that
transfer students should bo given high priority
for on-campus housing. It also seems to us
that the evaluation of transfer credits could
be expedited and improved in many ways.
Some faculty members might be especially en
couraged to handle transfer students. We de
sire further suggestions about the advising of
transfer students from anyone with ideas to
give.
Another group of students with problems to
which the Committee has not yet given
sufficient attention is foreign students. The
Beehtel International Center is a source of
remarkably fine personal attention to foreign
students. But this group has academic prob
lems peculiarly their own, and some made of
advising needs, we think, to be tailored to
them. Again, the Committee wishes to be
helped by ideas.
The third group is comprised of members
of minorities with special disadvantages. Ad
vising needs to have cognizance both of the
personal problems faced by such students and
of academic needs. Efforts to provide tutoring
from the Office of Financial Aids have been
sporadic, due largely to stringently limited
funds. Some more formal program of tutoring
and counsel would greatly increase the accessi
bility of an adequate Stanford education for
such students. Stanford has publicly stated its
intention to do the right thing by these per
sons. Additional support, morally and mone
tarily, needs to be provided.
The extent and rewards of advising. The
Committee believes that advising on all levels
should be taken together in figuring the aver
age ratio of advisees to advisers. Taking fig
ures in the fall Student Directory as sub

stantially correct for numbers of majors and
graduate students in the Schools and Depart
ments, and taking a count of faculty at As
sistant Professor or higher in Courses and De
grees as substantially correct (realizing that
many people in the latter are absent on leave),
and assuming that all of those faculty advise
majors and graduate students, we find the fol
lowing ratios by schools of major and grad
uate advisees to advisers:
Earth Sciences 5.8 (169/29)
Engineering 13.4 (2114A58)
Humanities & Sciences 11.7 (4739/405)
The figures for present General Studies ad
vising, however, look rather different. 115
persons are engaged in 1967-68 in General
Studies advising of 2330 students without de
clared majors, a ratio of 20.2G advisees to each
adviser. Sources of General Studies advisers
are as follows:
Earth Sciences 7 (24% of
school faculty)
Engineering 11 (6.9% of
school faculty)
Humanities & Sciences 45 (11.1% of
school faculty)
Medicine 12
Military Science 2
Physical Education 3
Education 2
Administration 33
The figures show the difficulties encountered
by the Registrar in his task of recruiting
General Studies Advisers. Only 63 ( 54.8%) of
present General Studies advisers come from
the faculties of Schools which will enroll the
advisees as majors. Moreover, only 39% of
General Studies advisers come from the School
of Humanities and Sciences, which can rea
sonably expect to enroll about 80% of un
dergraduates.
At the same time, figures received from De
partments of the School of Humanities and
Sciences show a very wide variation in the
actual advising practice of departments. Some
departments average as few as 4 departmental
advisees per adviser, whereas members of
others may have as many as 66 major ad
visees. Such a figure seems to the Committee
a mockery of the very idea of advising.
One can be only routine with that many ad
visees. The Committee is inclined to believe
that an upper limit on the number of allowable
advisees per adviser should be set, perhaps at
25 or 30, such a figure to include both grad
uate and undergraduate students. The Com
mittee also believes that Deans should ask
executive hads of departments quite search
ing questions about provisions for carrying
advising when many members of a depart
ment propose to be on leave for a given year.
One instance has been reported in which a
member of a large department finds himself
during this academic year with 89 advisees
(graduate, undergraduate major, and Gen
eral Studies) because so many of his col
league are absent on leave. If a limit on ad
visees were set and adhered to, such ex
ploitation would not be permitted.
The Committee has thought very hard about
the place of advising in Stanford's status and
reward system for its faculty. At present, save

for one department that claims to adjust Its
teaching loads in proportion to advising loads,
advising is in fact extra-curricular, in that
it is supposed to be done but no one pays
much attention if it is not done. The Commit
tee is informed that advisers receive extra
pay in some universities, and it has discussed
whether bonus pay would be an incentive to
better advising. We are not satisfied that it
would. We have also asked how a faculty
member's advising effectiveness might be a
factor in his promotion and salary increment.
Nothing would please the Committee more
than to be shown a method of accurate evalua
tion of this effectiveness, so that it could be
used as one among other determinants. We
have yet to find a method. Even if the stu
dent were to choose his adviser, one could not
determine the adviser's effectiveness merely
by counting the number of his advisees.
The Committee believes that advising will
be able to play a role in the status and re
ward system only if the faculty becomes so
committed to the advising function (which,
for the Committee, is integral to the educa
tional function) that the very commitment
produces a means of reward. The faculty
must decide that advising is important, and
the faculty at large must expend some energy
in advising. Pressure probably ought to be
exerted on those of our colleagues who would
rather not advise students, although the very
reluctant adviser will likely not be a very
good one. Perhaps, in considerations of reward
and promotion, nothing more than a negative
question can be asked. If a brilliant research
er does no advising, can his research contribu
tions outweigh the absence of his contribu
tion to the University's humanity? In some in
stances, the answer might have to be "No."
So far as the Committee knows, the question
has never been asked.
Advising in the professor's profession. The
Committee has expressed its conviction that
advising students is properly a part of the
educational profession, that such an as
sumption ought if possible to be an element
in consideration of reward. We suggest, more
over, that prospective faculty appointees be
informed of advising obligations of Stanford
faculty members. We would also suggest a
more long-range way of achieving the actuality
of this assumption. It has often been pointed
out that among the weakest aspects of grad
uate education today is the failure to prepare
people for their profession. Graduate students
are trained to do research, but many of them
are hired to be teachers and members of fac
ulties. We do not wish to underplay research.
But too little is done to train those of our grad
uate students who will become teachers for
their actual professional functions. The Com
mittee suggests the advisability of instruc
tion for graduate students in the scope of the
objectives and responsibilities of their chosen
profession, which will help them comprehend
the expectations under which they will work.
Such instruction could go a long way toward
making actual the ideal that professors are
engaged in education, an activity that includes
research and publication, classroom teach
ing, and the education of individual students
outside of formal instruction that advising
ought to be. When education in that sense be
comes the basic assumption of the University's

life, we will be on the way toward the fulfill
ment of our humanity.

Epilogue:
Enablement and
Surveillance
It is hoped that in such a relatively casual
and self selecting system as that proposed
above, the quiet and unspectacular job that
needs to be done will proceed. But responsibili
ty for watching it must be lodged somewhere
more specific than in the hearts and minds of
the 20,000-odd souls of the Stanford commun
ity. There needs to be improved liaison among
agencies, assurance that stated functions are
being fulfilled, exhortation if not pressure
for participation in both given and receiving.
It was suggested, half jocularly, in the Com
mittee that what is wanted is a "University
humane ofTice.'The term is simplistic, but the
thought is precise. To indicate, to itself and
everyone else, that Stanford means its hu
manity, the responsibility should be assumed
by a highly placed officer, of at least Associate
Provost rank, whose responsibilities would in
clude the coordination of advising and coun
seling structures.
The Committee remains uncertain whether
the responsibility should be added to those
carried by the Dean of Students, whether it
should be assigned to a Dean of Undergraduate
Educationâ€”should such a position be rein
statedâ€”or whether a new position should be
created. In favor of the first is the fact that
the Dean of Students is now responsible for
several agencies in which counseling and ad
vising take place. On the other hand, the ed
ucational thrust of the entire program might
suggest that the responsibility be held by a
distinctly academic officer such as a Dean of
Undergraduate Education. At the same time,
the fact that advising and counseling must af
fect graduate as well as undergraduate stu
dents makes desirable that the officer not be
exclusively occupied with undergraduates.
Whoever such a person might be, and what
ever his title, he must be accessible to and
trustable by students, command the respect
and attract the cooperation of the faculty, and
display remarkable virtues to non-academic
staff persons.
