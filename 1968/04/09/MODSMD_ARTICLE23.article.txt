# Student Protests Gaining Momentum In Worldwide Demands For Reforms
## 
### 
(CPS) — Although students
throughout many parts of the
world have been a powerful po
litical force for generations, the
worldwide student movement
has been rapidly gaining mo
mentum since the beginning of
the year.
Within recent weeks, students
have played significant roles in
the political developments of
many countries, including Czech
oslovakia, Poland, Spain, Egypt,
Italy, and Japan. In many other
countries, students are begin
ning to realize their potential
power and are demanding radi
cal political and education re
forms.
Students throughout the world
are not unified with a common
goal and strategy. Generally
speaking, however, students are
demanding — and frequently re
ceiving — more freedom from
their government, more respon
sibility in decision-making, and
a reformed education curricu
lum that is relevant to the new
social issues in the world.
Students in many countries
also are demonstrating against
the war in Vietnam, stressing
their desire for lasting peace in
the future. Anti-American sen
timent has reached new dimen
sions in many student circles.
Although the worldwide stu
dent movement seems to be
gaining momentum, protest
politics in Europe, Asia, and
elsewhere is not a new phe
nomenon. Students, for ex
ample, were largely respon
sible for the overthrow of ex-
President Sukarno in Indo
nesia, and students played a
major role in the overthrow
of the Syngman Rliee govern
ment in South Korea.
In the United States, however,
students are just beginning to
demand educational reform and
Presidential candidates, for the
first time, are making a major
appeal for student support. But
American students still have not
come of age when compared to
students in some other countries,
as developments within the past
few months make clear.
Brutal police suppression of
a student demonstration last

October helped discredit the
old-guard Communists, and
the Party leadership was taken
over by liberals in January.
Now, students are in the fore
front of the movement to end
all abuses of power, such as
phony trials, and to work for
a more humane and demo
cratic regime.
Independent student organi
zations have been formed at the
University of Prague and else
where within the last few weeks
to press for the students' de
mands for freedom. When the
old-guard leaders were in power,
student groups were carefully
controlled.
In Poland, students through
out the country have been in
volved in massive demonstra
tions against government cen
sorship, police brutality, and the
lack of free speech. Polish of
ficials have threatened the stu
dents with severe punishment
and have made every effort to
put down the student protests.
Polish students have clashed
with police on several occasions,
and have hold unauthorized
meetings and sit-ins. Last week,
some 2,000 Warsaw University
students held an unauthorized
meeting to demand the reinstate
ment of six humanities profes
sors who were dismissed be
cause of their liberal views.
Students began demonstrating
after the expulsion from War
saw University of two students
who took part in a protest
against the closing by govern
ment censors of "Dziady," a 19th
century classic of the Polish
theater which is critical of Czar
ist rule in Poland. Many ana
lysts think the wave of student
demonstrations is being used to
intensify a major power strug
gle within the Communist party
leadership. The outcome is still
far from clear.
A group of American student
and youth leaders have issued
a statement of support for the
students protestors in Poland.
In Spain, the government
last week ordered the Univer
sify of Madrid closed indefini
tely after a clash between stu

dents and police. Spanish stu
dents have been demanding
educational reform and more
freedom. Students became fed
up with the official govern
ment student association and
formed the Democratic Union
of Spanish Students (DUSS).
The Spanish government can
not afford to let students suc
ceed in their effort to break loose
from government control, be
cause then it would be extreme
ly difficult for the state to deny
the same right to workers. Stu
dents and police have been clash
ing in Spain for several years,
but tensions now seem to be
getting worse.
The University of Madrid was
closcd last week to stop a stu
dent protest against American
bases in Spain and the war in
Vietnam.
In recent weeks, Egypt's 150,-
000 students have been posing
a serious threat to President
Gamal Abdel Nasser's control
of the government. The most
widespread rioting in a decade
recently forced the closing of
Egyptian universities, although
they are now back in session.
Student demonstrators have
been calling for democracy,
freedom of the press, and abo
lition of the Egyptian Nation
al Assf:ably and the Arab So
cialist Union. Students also
have protest the "lenient ver
dicts" and sentences passed
on four air force generals
charged with crucial respon
sibility for Egypt's defeat last
June in the war with Israel.
Now that the universities are
back in session, more riots may
occur. But there are reports that
President Nasser may revamp
his Cabinet, bringing in 14 civi
lians, as a concession to stu
dent demands.
University students through
out Italy have been demonstrat
ing for new teaching methods
and more student control of the
universities. Rival political
groups recently engaged in a
violent clash at the University
of Rome, and several hundred
students were arrestd by police.
The students may be accomp

lishing something, however. In
early March, the coalition gov
ernment proposed new legisla
tion in the Chamber of Deputies
which goes a long way to meet
student demands. The bill pro
vides for the adoption of new
teaching methods and the par
ticipation of students in the
various faculty councils.

In Poland, students through

lack of free speech. Polish of

and have made every effort to
put down the student protests.
Polish students have clashed
with police on several occasions,
and have hold unauthorized
meetings and sit-ins. Last week,
some 2,000 Warsaw University
students held an unauthorized
meeting to demand the reinstate

Students began demonstrating
after the expulsion from War
saw University of two students
who took part in a protest
against the closing by govern

theater which is critical of Czar

demonstrations is being used to
intensify a major power strug

leadership. The outcome is still
far from clear.
A group of American student
and youth leaders have issued
a statement of support for the
students protestors in Poland.
In Spain, the government
last week ordered the Univer

dents and police. Spanish stu
dents have been demanding
educational reform and more
freedom. Students became fed
up with the official govern

formed the Democratic Union
of Spanish Students (DUSS).
The Spanish government can
not afford to let students suc

from government control, be
cause then it would be extreme

but tensions now seem to be
getting worse.
The University of Madrid was
closcd last week to stop a stu

bases in Spain and the war in
Vietnam.
In recent weeks, Egypt's 150,-
000 students have been posing
a serious threat to President
Gamal Abdel Nasser's control
of the government. The most
widespread rioting in a decade
recently forced the closing of
Egyptian universities, although
they are now back in session.
Student demonstrators have
been calling for democracy,
freedom of the press, and abo
lition of the Egyptian Nation
al Assf:ably and the Arab So
cialist Union. Students also
have protest the "lenient ver
dicts" and sentences passed
on four air force generals
charged with crucial respon
sibility for Egypt's defeat last
June in the war with Israel.
Now that the universities are
back in session, more riots may
occur. But there are reports that
President Nasser may revamp
his Cabinet, bringing in 14 civi

dent demands.
University students through
out Italy have been demonstrat
ing for new teaching methods
and more student control of the
universities. Rival political
groups recently engaged in a
violent clash at the University
of Rome, and several hundred
students were arrestd by police.
The students may be accomp

lishing something, however. In
early March, the coalition gov

which goes a long way to meet
student demands. The bill pro

(CPS) — Although students
throughout many parts of the
world have been a powerful po
litical force for generations, the
worldwide student movement
has been rapidly gaining mo
mentum since the beginning of
the year.
Within recent weeks, students
have played significant roles in
the political developments of
many countries, including Czech
oslovakia, Poland, Spain, Egypt,
Italy, and Japan. In many other
countries, students are begin
ning to realize their potential
power and are demanding radi
cal political and education re
forms.
Students throughout the world
are not unified with a common
goal and strategy. Generally
speaking, however, students are
demanding — and frequently re
ceiving — more freedom from
their government, more respon
sibility in decision-making, and
a reformed education curricu
lum that is relevant to the new
social issues in the world.
Students in many countries
also are demonstrating against
the war in Vietnam, stressing
their desire for lasting peace in
the future. Anti-American sen
timent has reached new dimen
sions in many student circles.
Although the worldwide stu
dent movement seems to be
gaining momentum, protest
politics in Europe, Asia, and
elsewhere is not a new phe
nomenon. Students, for ex
ample, were largely respon
sible for the overthrow of ex-
President Sukarno in Indo
nesia, and students played a
major role in the overthrow
of the Syngman Rliee govern
ment in South Korea.
In the United States, however,
students are just beginning to
demand educational reform and
Presidential candidates, for the
first time, are making a major
appeal for student support. But
American students still have not
come of age when compared to
students in some other countries,
as developments within the past
few months make clear.

recently forced the closing of
Egyptian universities, although
they are now back in session.
Student demonstrators have
been calling for democracy,

have protest the "lenient ver

on four air force generals
charged with crucial respon
sibility for Egypt's defeat last
June in the war with Israel.
Now that the universities are

University students through

(CPS) — Although students
throughout many parts of the
world have been a powerful po
litical force for generations, the
worldwide student movement
has been rapidly gaining mo
mentum since the beginning of
the year.
Within recent weeks, students
have played significant roles in
the political developments of
many countries, including Czech
oslovakia, Poland, Spain, Egypt,
Italy, and Japan. In many other
countries, students are begin
ning to realize their potential
power and are demanding radi
cal political and education re
forms.
Students throughout the world
are not unified with a common
goal and strategy. Generally
speaking, however, students are
demanding — and frequently re
ceiving — more freedom from
their government, more respon
sibility in decision-making, and
a reformed education curricu
lum that is relevant to the new
social issues in the world.
Students in many countries
also are demonstrating against
the war in Vietnam, stressing
their desire for lasting peace in
the future. Anti-American sen
timent has reached new dimen
sions in many student circles.
Although the worldwide stu
dent movement seems to be
gaining momentum, protest
politics in Europe, Asia, and
elsewhere is not a new phe
nomenon. Students, for ex
ample, were largely respon
sible for the overthrow of ex-
President Sukarno in Indo
nesia, and students played a
major role in the overthrow
of the Syngman Rliee govern
ment in South Korea.
In the United States, however,
students are just beginning to
demand educational reform and
Presidential candidates, for the
first time, are making a major
appeal for student support. But
American students still have not
come of age when compared to
students in some other countries,
as developments within the past
few months make clear.
Brutal police suppression of
a student demonstration last

October helped discredit the
old-guard Communists, and
the Party leadership was taken
over by liberals in January.
Now, students are in the fore
front of the movement to end
all abuses of power, such as
phony trials, and to work for
a more humane and demo
cratic regime.
Independent student organi
zations have been formed at the
University of Prague and else
where within the last few weeks
to press for the students' de
mands for freedom. When the
old-guard leaders were in power,
student groups were carefully
controlled.
In Poland, students through
out the country have been in
volved in massive demonstra
tions against government cen
sorship, police brutality, and the
lack of free speech. Polish of
ficials have threatened the stu
dents with severe punishment
and have made every effort to
put down the student protests.
Polish students have clashed
with police on several occasions,
and have hold unauthorized
meetings and sit-ins. Last week,
some 2,000 Warsaw University
students held an unauthorized
meeting to demand the reinstate
ment of six humanities profes
sors who were dismissed be
cause of their liberal views.
Students began demonstrating
after the expulsion from War
saw University of two students
who took part in a protest
against the closing by govern
ment censors of "Dziady," a 19th
century classic of the Polish
theater which is critical of Czar
ist rule in Poland. Many ana
lysts think the wave of student
demonstrations is being used to
intensify a major power strug
gle within the Communist party
leadership. The outcome is still
far from clear.
A group of American student
and youth leaders have issued
a statement of support for the
students protestors in Poland.
In Spain, the government
last week ordered the Univer
sify of Madrid closed indefini
tely after a clash between stu

dents and police. Spanish stu
dents have been demanding
educational reform and more
freedom. Students became fed
up with the official govern
ment student association and
formed the Democratic Union
of Spanish Students (DUSS).
The Spanish government can
not afford to let students suc
ceed in their effort to break loose
from government control, be
cause then it would be extreme
ly difficult for the state to deny
the same right to workers. Stu
dents and police have been clash
ing in Spain for several years,
but tensions now seem to be
getting worse.
The University of Madrid was
closcd last week to stop a stu
dent protest against American
bases in Spain and the war in
Vietnam.
In recent weeks, Egypt's 150,-
000 students have been posing
a serious threat to President
Gamal Abdel Nasser's control
of the government. The most
widespread rioting in a decade
recently forced the closing of
Egyptian universities, although
they are now back in session.
Student demonstrators have
been calling for democracy,
freedom of the press, and abo
