# Tiger Trek Rally
## 
### 
El Tigre Eating Club's third
— but not unusual — "Tiger
Trek" car rally will be held Sat
urday, April 20.
The last time this sporadic
event was held was two years
ago. It is a gimmick rally, so
following instructions will be
the main problem.
Registration starts at 12:15
p.m. at the parking lot next to
the Encina tennis courts, with
a two dollar entry fee per car.
Cars may leave for the approxi

mately three hour event anytime
between 12:45 and 1:30.
The theme for the Tiger Trek
is "Bonnie and Clyde," and some
of the things that will be en
countered during the rally will
reflect the theme.
Co-chairmen Mike Foster and
Mike Rahn are both gimmick
rally veterans, and they claim
to have laid out a course that is
not impossible for beginners
but still challenging to those
with experience.
