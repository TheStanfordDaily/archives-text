# Possible Vietnam Cease-Fire Elicits Warning By Possony
## 
### 
Thorn shouldn't bo too much
jubilation over a possible cease
fire in Viotnam, Dr. Stefan T.
Possony warnod a group of pol
itical and editorial writers in
a Hoover Institution seminar at
Stanford Thursday.
"The communists are getting
just what thoy wanted a cessa
tion of all hostile activity
against North Viotnam," said
the director of tho Hoover Insti
tution's International Political
Studios Program. "Ho Chi Minh
has not given up his objective,
which is to seize all of Vietnam."
"Furthermore, it's easy to for
get the communist doctrine that
when fighting gets a little tough,
it's time to sit down at the
negotiating Table and continue
the fight by talking," Dr. Pos
sony pointed out.
Another afternoon panelist,
Prof. Claude Buss of Stanford's
History Department, agreed
with Possony's view. But "It's
not an 'either-or' proposition,"
he said. "We are not going to
weaken our position by stop
ping fighting in South Viet
nam."

One of the explanations for
tho current willingness of Hanoi
to negotiate, Dr. Possony said,
is that tho Tot offensive failed
in both psychology and in stim
ulating a native uprising, so Ho
has to turn to negotiations
while further plans by tho com
munists are made.
There are elements of nine
Red Chinese divisions in North
Vietnam, Dr. Possony revealed,
"although this is not as signifi
cant. as it sounds—they are rail
road troops, anti-aircraft gun
ners and equipment repairmen
of various kinds."
However, something of a split
may be developing in North
Vietnam, Dr. Possony said. A 1
though Ho himself is Chinese,
ho is more favorably disposed
toward tho Soviets than Mao
because the Soviets are supply
ing most of North Vietnam's
equipment.
It's important to remember,
Dr. Possony told tho writers,
that no matter what goes on in
the communist bloc in the line
of family quarrels, all commu

nist parties follow the "general
line" laid down twice in the
last decade: that the final goal
of all is world revolution.
Dr. Nobutake Ike, the third
panelist, said ho doubted that
Japan would be able to provide
economic and military stability
in the Far East because of its
ambivalent feeling about the
U.S.
"She depends for her pro
tection on tho U.S.'s nuclear um
brella," the Stanford political
scientist said, "but she is hostile
to it. Any U.S. attempt to got
the Japanese National Defense
Force for use outside the home
islands would certainly cause a
governmental upheaval."
He predicted that the pressure
to return Okinawa to Japan
would increase but by the time
negotiations for treaty renewal
come around in 1970, both U.S.
and Japanese governments may
allow the treaty to automatic
ally renew itself as its pro
visions allow —unless the pro
tests concerning the U.S. pres
ence in Japan become too strong
to ignore.
