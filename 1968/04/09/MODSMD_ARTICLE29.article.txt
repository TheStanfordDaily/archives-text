ate, Ruppenthal has authored
many articles and books, includ
ing Transportation and Tomor
row and Perspectives in Trans
portation.
In addressing the Caltech Man
agement Club last February,
Ruppenthal said technology has
become the God of those respon
sible for developing the super
sonic transports (SST's).
He went on to say that if 175
SST's were allowed to fly trans
continental routes "people living
in their wake would have the
joy of being boomed 700 times a
day."
Since he has been a Trans
World Airlines pilot himself
since 1942, Ruppenthal's attack
on the SST's takes on perspec
tive. He has stated the British-
French effort to develop the
Concorde, may never make it
off the ground.
"There is abundant evidence
to indicate that the Concorde
will bo underpowered, inefficient
and expensive," he said.
As far as he is concerned, "the
financial prospects for Ameri
ca's SST's don't look good."
"Even to the sophisticated in
vestor, with capital to risk, there
is no incontive."

is no incontive."
