### 
About 1,900 more federal
troops were sent into riot-torn
areas of Baltimore on Monday
to supress renewed looting, ar
son and violence, while Ohio Na
tional Guardsmen were rushed
into Cincinnati and Youngstown.
Ohio Gov. James A. Rhodes
dispatched some 1,800 guards
men to the two cities as they
were added to the growing list
of scenes of racial turmoil in the
five nights since Dr. Martin Lu
ther King Jr. was slain in Mem
phis, Tenn.
The entire state of Delaware
was declared under a state of
emergency Monday night as
roaming Negro gangs spread a
rash of looting and firebombing
in a four-block area of Wilming
ton.
Pittsburgh, quiet for a time,
was hit anew by vandalism
Monday and 650 additional Na
tional Guardsmen were sent
into aid troops already on pa
trol. Gov. Raymond Shafer said
federal troops have been desig
nated specifically for duty in
Pittsburgh, if needed.
• March For King
MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP)—Be
neath a spring sky of somber
gray, row on row of marchers
paraded through Memphis Mon
day, in silent, grieving re
memberance of Dr. Martin Lu
ther King Jr. His widow in
black and three of his four chil
dren clasped hands to lead the
ranks.
"I came to you today because
I was compelled ... I felt he
would have wanted me to be
here," Mrs. Coretta King told
the marchers when they arrived
at their destination, the city's

marble and starkly modern City
Hall.
Appearing fatigued, and fight
ing a head cold, Mrs. King de
clared of her husband; "I can
say he was a great man, a great
father and a great husband."
• Mideast Fighting
Troop-carrying Israeli heli
copters flew into Jordan south
of the Dead Sea Monday to at
tack the headquarters of Arab
commandos operating in Is
raeli's Negev Desert, the Israeli
army reported. It said the Is
raelis withdrew after a 105-min
ute action.
Jordan claimed, ho.vever, the
Israelis were attempting an in
vasion with armored columns
and helicopter troops "covered
by a thick umbrella of Israeli
jets" but were hurled back by
the Jordanian army.
"These claims are ridicu
lous," an Israeli army spokes
man said in Tel Aviv. "This was
not a planned action. There
were definitely no armor or
planes involved, only a few heli
copters."
The Israelis said the helicop
ter force with assault troops
caught a hand of Arab comman
dos on the desert and chased
them back to Jordan.
• Supreme Court
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Supreme Court took the death
penalty out of the Lindbergh
kidnaping law Monday.
A 6-2 decision read bv Justice
Potter Stewart said the provi
sion put an "inpermissible bur
den" on the right to a trial by
jury.
Other provisions of the 1932

law, enacted in response to the
kidnaping of the infant son of
the pioneering air hero Charles
A. Lindbergh, were left intact.
The law was written to give the
federal government a way to
step in on kidnapings.
"The infirmity of the death
penalty clause does not require
the total frustration of Con
gress' basic purpose — that of
making interstate kidnaping a
federal crime," Stewart said.
The death penalty clause was
added the law in 1934. It spe
cified that a convicted kidnaper
who had not liberated his victim
unharmed could be put to death,
but only on a jury's recommen
dation.

• Supreme Court
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Supreme Court took the death
penalty out of the Lindbergh
kidnaping law Monday.
A 6-2 decision read bv Justice
Potter Stewart said the provi
sion put an "inpermissible bur
den" on the right to a trial by
jury.
Other provisions of the 1932

law, enacted in response to the
kidnaping of the infant son of
the pioneering air hero Charles
A. Lindbergh, were left intact.
The law was written to give the
federal government a way to
step in on kidnapings.
"The infirmity of the death
penalty clause does not require
the total frustration of Con
gress' basic purpose — that of
making interstate kidnaping a
federal crime," Stewart said.
The death penalty clause was
added the law in 1934. It spe
cified that a convicted kidnaper
who had not liberated his victim
unharmed could be put to death,
but only on a jury's recommen
dation.

• March For King
MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP)—Be
neath a spring sky of somber
gray, row on row of marchers
paraded through Memphis Mon
day, in silent, grieving re
memberance of Dr. Martin Lu
ther King Jr. His widow in
black and three of his four chil
dren clasped hands to lead the
ranks.
"I came to you today because
I was compelled ... I felt he
would have wanted me to be
here," Mrs. Coretta King told
the marchers when they arrived
at their destination, the city's

marble and starkly modern City
Hall.
Appearing fatigued, and fight
ing a head cold, Mrs. King de
clared of her husband; "I can
say he was a great man, a great
father and a great husband."
• Mideast Fighting
Troop-carrying Israeli heli
copters flew into Jordan south
of the Dead Sea Monday to at
tack the headquarters of Arab
commandos operating in Is
raeli's Negev Desert, the Israeli
army reported. It said the Is
raelis withdrew after a 105-min
ute action.
Jordan claimed, ho.vever, the
Israelis were attempting an in
vasion with armored columns
and helicopter troops "covered
by a thick umbrella of Israeli
jets" but were hurled back by
the Jordanian army.
"These claims are ridicu
lous," an Israeli army spokes
man said in Tel Aviv. "This was
not a planned action. There
were definitely no armor or
planes involved, only a few heli
copters."
The Israelis said the helicop
ter force with assault troops
caught a hand of Arab comman
dos on the desert and chased
them back to Jordan.
• Supreme Court
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Supreme Court took the death
penalty out of the Lindbergh
kidnaping law Monday.
A 6-2 decision read bv Justice
Potter Stewart said the provi
sion put an "inpermissible bur
den" on the right to a trial by
jury.
Other provisions of the 1932

law, enacted in response to the
kidnaping of the infant son of
the pioneering air hero Charles
A. Lindbergh, were left intact.
The law was written to give the
federal government a way to
step in on kidnapings.
"The infirmity of the death
penalty clause does not require
the total frustration of Con
gress' basic purpose — that of
making interstate kidnaping a
federal crime," Stewart said.
The death penalty clause was
added the law in 1934. It spe
cified that a convicted kidnaper
who had not liberated his victim
unharmed could be put to death,
but only on a jury's recommen
dation.
