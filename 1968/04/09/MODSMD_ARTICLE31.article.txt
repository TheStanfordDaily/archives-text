# Mod Ballet To Open Summer Festival
## 
### 
The 19GS Stanford Summer
Festival will open on June 25
with a seven-performance stand
by the New York City Center
Joffrey Ballet, one of the na
tion's most inventive, total-thea
ter dance companies.
American organist Carl Wein
rich, vocal soloists Isabel Rivas,
Carolyn Stanford, and Simon
Estes are also on the summer
program.
The Joffrey company will pre
sent 11 ballets in seven perform
ances from June 25 to 30. Wein
rich will perform two Sunday af
ternoon organ recitals on July
28 and August -1. The vocal por
tion of the Festival will run
from August 1 through 9.
The company will perform
"Astarte", a mod, rock and psy
chedelic masterpiece by director
of the company, Robert Joffrey.
Other new works are "Clowns,"
"Olympics," "Secret Places,"
"Movies," and "Cello Concerto."
Five favorites of the 1967 fes
tival repertory will be repeated:
the moody "Sea Shadow" and
"Nightwings," virile "Viva Vi
valdi," jaunty "Cakewalk," and
classical "Pas des Deesses."
The original company was
founded in 1952 by Joffrey and
now includes 30 dancers. It is
renoun for its high artistic
standards, and theatrical clan.
The New York Times insists
that "there is not a company
in the world to match it."
Virtuoso performer, Weinrich
is generally considered to be
the greatest living interpreter of
the organ music of Johann Se
bastian Bach and his Baroque
forerunners.
His recordings of the music
of Bach's forerunners and of the
other, little-known members of
the Bach family are acclaimed
as significant contributions to
modern understanding and ap
preciation of Bach in the serious
repertory.
Weinrich is director of the

Princeton University Chapel,
but he will participate in the
artist - in - residence program
while performing at the festival.
He will teach a master class
in organ for advanced students
and teachers July 22-August 4
