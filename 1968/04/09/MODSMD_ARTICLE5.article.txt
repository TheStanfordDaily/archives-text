# Sterling's Statement
## 
### 
At Monday's colloquium, the Black Student Union made a pres
entation about minority-group problems at the University. It is
the matter not the manner of what they said that counts. In our
community, they are among the prime witnesses to racial in
justice, and it is important that all members of the community
listen to these witnesses. Much of what they advocate constitutes
the basis for a constructive program of action. Goals toward which
the University pledgees itself to devote the necessary resources of
time, thought and money include:
1. An effort to double over current enrollment figures the num
ber of minority-group students enrolled at Stanford by
academic year 1969-1970, through an accelerated recruitment
and financial aid program.
2. A pilot program in 1968-69 for at least ten minority-group
students who do not meet minimal Stanford academic re
quirements.
3. An effort to double the proportion of minority-group em
ployment at Stanford over the next year, and to upgrade such
employment wherever feasible.
4. Adequate staffing and funding to achieve points one, two,
and three.
We call upon the members of the Black Student Union to work
with us to achieve these goals and to carry on a continuing dialogue
about them. Dialogue does not take place in mass meetings. It takes
place when men of good will, recognizing that none of them has
truth in his exclusive possession, resolve to discuss their common
problems. To this end we invite them to designate five representa
tives to meet with a like number of faculty and staff members this
Thursday, April 11, at 2 p.m.
