# Sterling Gives Support To IJB Case Rulings
## 
### 
President Wallace Sterling
yesterday affirmed that the five
man faculty Interim Judicial
Board will continue to hear
campus disciplinary cases in
volving demonstrations.
Sterling's announcement re
moves suspicions that the
Committee of Fifteen's plan
for a student faculty judicial
body might immediately re
place the IJB.
Giving punch to his state
ment, Sterling said it would be
considered a violation of Uni
versity policy if students fail
to cooperate with the IJB.
Sterling authorized the IJB
chairman to refer cases to indi
vidual Board members "for
hearing and disposition if in his
judgment it is impracticable for
the Board to hear all the cases
which arise."
Sterling's statement follows

a lengthy disciplinary proceed
ings involving students who
allegedly blocked entry to En
cina Hall in a demonstration
against Central Intelligence
Agency recruiters on campus
Nov. 1, 1967.
The Student Judicial Council
(initially refused to hear the
case, then asked the IJB to re
store student jurisdiction. The
student group then found all the
alleged demonstrators innocent
and refused to make the record
of its proceedings available to
the faculty group, which norm
ally hears appeals.
The Student Judicial Council
also has declared it will not en
force University policy on cam
pus demonstrations, and the Stu
dent Legislature has announced
that it no longer recognizes the
jurisdiction of the IJB.
"These developments have
combined to impair confidence
in the judicial system and to
create uncertainty about the
way in which policies and regu
lations will be administered and
enforced within the University
community," Sterling said.
"Remedial measures must be
taken."
The Daily reported yesterday
that the Committee of Fifteen
had recommended a compro
mise plan for a student-faculty
appeals board to make "final
recommendations" on disciplin
ary cases to President Sterling.
How student members for an
appeals board would be chosen
remains a problem.
In his statement, Sterling
noted that "the delegation of
exclusive original .jurisdiction
over cases Involving student
conduct to the (Student) Ju
dicial Council was based on
an understanding that there
would be responsible enforce
ment of University regulations
and of the Fundamental Stan
dard and the Honor Code.
"I regret that expectations in
herent in that understanding
have not been fulfilled. Some
cases have not been decided by

the Council within a reasonable
period of time. There has been
dereliction of the Council's ad
ministrative responsibility as
manifest in failure to notify a
student of the decision reached
in (his case). . . ."

Since the Council has said it
will not enforce campus demon
stration policy, these cases now
will go direct to the IJB. Other
cases will continue to be sub
mitted to the Council, whose de
cisions may then be appealed
to the IJB either by the student
involved or by the Dean of Stu
dents.
If a case submitted to the
Council is not decided "within
a reasonable period of time" or
if its decision is not promptly
delivered to the student con
cerned and to the dean of stu
dents, then the case will be re
ferred to the IJB, Sterling said.
He indicated these were in
terim measures, pending formu
lation of a new campus judicial
system.
Campus policy, adopted by
faculty representatives and Uni
versity officers in May 1964, per
mits demonstrations provided:
"1. Are conducted in an order
ly manner;
"2. Do not interfere with ve
hicular or pedestrian traffic;
"3. Do not interfere with
classes, scheduled meetings and
ceremonies, or with other edu
cational processes of the Uni
versity; and
"4. Are not held (a) within
University buildings; (b) within
University stadia, amphitheaters
or fields while University func
tions are in progress therein; or
(c) in the private residential
areas of the campus."

Giving punch to his state

considered a violation of Uni

to cooperate with the IJB.
Sterling authorized the IJB
chairman to refer cases to indi

hearing and disposition if in his
judgment it is impracticable for
the Board to hear all the cases
which arise."
Sterling's statement follows

a lengthy disciplinary proceed
ings involving students who
allegedly blocked entry to En
cina Hall in a demonstration
against Central Intelligence
Agency recruiters on campus
Nov. 1, 1967.
The Student Judicial Council
(initially refused to hear the
case, then asked the IJB to re
store student jurisdiction. The
student group then found all the
alleged demonstrators innocent
and refused to make the record
of its proceedings available to
the faculty group, which norm
ally hears appeals.
The Student Judicial Council
also has declared it will not en
force University policy on cam
pus demonstrations, and the Stu
dent Legislature has announced
that it no longer recognizes the
jurisdiction of the IJB.
"These developments have
combined to impair confidence
in the judicial system and to
create uncertainty about the
way in which policies and regu
lations will be administered and
enforced within the University
community," Sterling said.
"Remedial measures must be
taken."
The Daily reported yesterday
that the Committee of Fifteen
had recommended a compro
mise plan for a student-faculty
appeals board to make "final
recommendations" on disciplin
ary cases to President Sterling.
How student members for an
appeals board would be chosen
remains a problem.
In his statement, Sterling
noted that "the delegation of
exclusive original .jurisdiction
over cases Involving student
conduct to the (Student) Ju
dicial Council was based on
an understanding that there
would be responsible enforce
ment of University regulations
and of the Fundamental Stan
dard and the Honor Code.
"I regret that expectations in
herent in that understanding
have not been fulfilled. Some
cases have not been decided by

the Council within a reasonable
period of time. There has been
dereliction of the Council's ad
ministrative responsibility as
manifest in failure to notify a
student of the decision reached
in (his case). . . ."

Since the Council has said it
will not enforce campus demon
stration policy, these cases now
will go direct to the IJB. Other
cases will continue to be sub
mitted to the Council, whose de
cisions may then be appealed
to the IJB either by the student
involved or by the Dean of Stu
dents.
If a case submitted to the
Council is not decided "within
a reasonable period of time" or
if its decision is not promptly
delivered to the student con
cerned and to the dean of stu

ferred to the IJB, Sterling said.
He indicated these were in
terim measures, pending formu
lation of a new campus judicial
system.
