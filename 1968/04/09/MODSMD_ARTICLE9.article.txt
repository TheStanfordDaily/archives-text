In the midst of confrontations, ultimatums, and walkouts yes
terday afternoon in Memorial Auditorium, one salient fact may
have been lost. The Black Student Union's demands and the pro
grams suggested by Provost Richard Lyman have much in com
mon.
The BSU demanded that greater financial support be offered
to black students and applicants. Only a week ago the admissions
committee of Study of Education at Stanford (SES) made the
same demand in a position paper. The BSU called for establish
ment of a commission to protect the rights of minority group citi
zens at Stanford and minutes later Lyman announced the estab
lishment by President Wallace Sterling of a Human Rights Com
mission.
There was agreement on many points. Practically all the BSU
demands are clearly reasonable in substance, if not in style. But
communication was at a minimum.
It is imperative that Lyman or his highest deputy meet with
representatives of the BSU tonight to discuss the action they both
desire. To stop communicating at this crucial juncture can only
produce ill will, leading to civil disobedience.
The time for talk has not passed.
It was unfortunate the BSU walked out yesterday, refusing to
listen to Lyman. It would be more unfortunate if either party
walks out tonight.
