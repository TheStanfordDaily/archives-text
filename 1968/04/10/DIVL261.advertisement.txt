TWO TIMELY BOOKS
In this perceptive and witty book, Professor Bailey
evaluates those maxims of diplomatic behavior which
have guided Presidents, Ambassadors, and State De- â– ^BbUbbBAmSH
partment officials over the course of our history. Some
are as familiar as "Never lead a divided nation into HKM
war." Others are Professor Bailey s own apt phrasing:
"It is difficult for big nations to have small wars."
Copies of DEMOCRATS VS REPUBLICANS ($4.95) and of
