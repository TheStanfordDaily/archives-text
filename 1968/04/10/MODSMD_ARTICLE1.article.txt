# Open Meeting: University, BSU Agree On Nine Of Ten Points
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Stanford administrators
agreed "in substance" last night
at Tresidder Union to nine of
ten demands presented to them
Monday by the Black Student
Union. Early in the meeting,
however, the two groups near
ly reached an impasse.
The confrontation, witnessed
by nearly 1,000 students, fol
lowed a BSU request that the.
administration respond to their
demands at 7 p.m. last night at
TMU.
Vice-Provost Herbert Packer
and oth«*r University repre-j
sentatives at the meeting said
that Stanford would:
• Hire an admissions officer
to deal with recruitment of mi
nority students as soon as a
qualified man is available;
• Encourage recruitment of
faculty members from minor
ity groups;
• Relocate existing funds and
conduct a campus fund-rais
ing drive to raise money to im
plement the BSU demands;

• Implement immediately the
points in a memo of James
Gibbs. professor of anthropolo
gy, on steps needed for Stanford
to guarantee equal employment:
• Allow the BSU to name two
members to the now Human Re
lations Commission, first an
nounced yesterday but in plan
ning for several weeks. The
group will deal with charges of
discrimination, and will accept
complaints from all sources.
These steps arc in addition
to Stanford's commitment, an
nounced late Monday by Pres
ident Wallace Sterling and
Provost Richard Lyman, to
double minority student en
rollment by 1969 and double
the proportion of minority em
ployees "within the year."
The one point administration
representatives refused to agree
to was dismissal of Robert
Rosenzweig,- vice-provost for
minority affairs.
Administration and BSU rep
resentatives will meet Thursday
at 2:30 p.m. to discuss the de

tails of the BSU demands.
Rosenzweig, Packer, Vice-
President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson, and Professors
Robert McAfee Brown, Kenneth
Arrow, and Donald Kennedy
were present.
Speaking for the BSU were
its co-chairmen, Kenny Wash
ington and Charles Countee,
Frank Satterwhite, and Leti
tia Carter. Professor Gibbs
was also on the panel.
The meeting, originally sched
uled for room 270 but moved
outside because of the large
audience, was begun by Wash
ington. After introductory re
marks, he road the introduction
to the BSU demands.
Packer responded by outlin
ing Stanford's most recent pro
gress in the areas of minority
group admissions and race re
lations.
An impasse developed when
Washington, who began reading
the list of demands one by one,
asked Packer and the others to
reply point by point.
After reading the initial item
on the list, Washington asked
"Are you prepared to respond
to the first demand?"
Packer replied that he was
not.
"The complexities must be
worked out at a later da t e,"
Washington countered, "but we
must have some discussion on
thes n demands now."
Packer was adamant, say
ing, "This is not the atmos
phere. This is neither the time
nor the place to discuss the
points you have brought up.
I've tried to give you a, prog
ress report, I'm sorry if that
is not enough. We want to
talk."
When Countee demanded ei
ther a statement of acceptance
or a timetable of implementa
tion" for the demands, Packer
replied that "we have already
made a beginning. The meeting
Thursday, if you want, is the
beginning of the timetable for
implementation."
Washington again questioned
Packer's refusal to discuss the
issues then and there, saying, "I
don't see the problem here.
These are students. They don't
bite. They have minds. I don't
think it's at all unreasonable to
talk now."
Sensing a lack of progress,
Washington called a 15-minute
recess. Both groups met sopa
ratolv to discuss the situation.
When they emerged, Will
ard Wynian, associate dean of
students asked Washington
and Countee whether they
would accept broaxl discussion
of the points, but leaving the
details until Thursday.

The BSU chairmen agreed.
When the meeting resumed,
Washington read off the de
mands one by one, and Packer
and the others explained admin
istration positions and plans.
Packer announced that pro
fessors Byron Sher, P. Herbert
Leiderman, and Donald Ken
nedy, history major Tom Trim
bur and one student yet to be
named, will also serve on the
Human Relations Commission.
H" also said he felt the com
mitment to double minority
group enrollment "meets the
substance of" the BSU demand
for proportional representation
of minority groups.
In response to another de
mand for data on minority
student admissions, Rosen
zweig noted that Stanford had
published substantial data on
minority freshman applicants
in a recent report, and indi
cated this would continue.
Replying to the demand for
BSU involvement in minority
group recruitment, Packer said
he thought "it's very important
minority group students be in
volved in the admissions proced
ure. That's the only way it's go
ing to work."
Cuthbertson explained some of
the financing difficulties, calling
them "an enormous financial
problem. We must re-examine
our priorities. We must do-some
thing on a crash basis, and it's
not easy."
Despite the problems, "I can
assure you there is enough per
sonal commitment to get on
with this job," he added.
Kennedy said that the Hu
man Relations Commission
would deal with all discrimi

natory acts mentioned by the
BSU.
Besides commenting on in
creased faculty recruitment of
finority group members, Arrow
said that curriculum revision
would be made and include an
undergraduate special on white
racism and economics courses
on poverty and discrimination.
After the Tresidder meeting,
the newly-formed Students
Against White Racism met in
Bishop Auditorium. About 300
people attended.
The following resolution was
passed:
"We the Students Against
White Racism support fully the
demands of the BSU and feel
that the University must take
further steps in all areas in re
sponse to the racial crises in
America."
Students were urged to sup
port a tentative BSU rally at
noon today in White Plaza, and
to Sign up for working commit
tees in the ASSU office.
Washington said the BSU
would attend tomorrow's meet
ing, but also noted "our response
(to the administration's state
ments) would have to be con
sidered."
He said a BSU reply would be
issued at 10 a.m. today at a
meeting in room 268 of TMU,
and invited Packer and the oth
ers to attend.
University representatives
at tomorrow's session will in
clude Packer, Brown, Arrow,
Rosenzweig, and Lyman.
As the meeting closed Brown
received loud applause when he
thanked Washington "for the
fact that this remained a ra
tional meeting."

Robert McAfee Brown, Kenneth
Arrow, and Donald Kennedy
were present.
Speaking for the BSU were
its co-chairmen, Kenny Wash
ington and Charles Countee,
Frank Satterwhite, and Leti
tia Carter. Professor Gibbs
was also on the panel.
The meeting, originally sched
uled for room 270 but moved
outside because of the large
audience, was begun by Wash
ington. After introductory re
marks, he road the introduction
to the BSU demands.
Packer responded by outlin
ing Stanford's most recent pro
gress in the areas of minority
group admissions and race re
lations.
An impasse developed when
Washington, who began reading
the list of demands one by one,
asked Packer and the others to
reply point by point.
After reading the initial item
on the list, Washington asked
"Are you prepared to respond
to the first demand?"
Packer replied that he was
not.
"The complexities must be
worked out at a later da t e,"
Washington countered, "but we
must have some discussion on
thes n demands now."
Packer was adamant, say
ing, "This is not the atmos
phere. This is neither the time
nor the place to discuss the
points you have brought up.
I've tried to give you a, prog
ress report, I'm sorry if that
is not enough. We want to
talk."
When Countee demanded ei
ther a statement of acceptance
or a timetable of implementa
tion" for the demands, Packer
replied that "we have already
made a beginning. The meeting
Thursday, if you want, is the
beginning of the timetable for
implementation."
Washington again questioned
Packer's refusal to discuss the
issues then and there, saying, "I
don't see the problem here.
These are students. They don't
bite. They have minds. I don't
think it's at all unreasonable to
talk now."
Sensing a lack of progress,
Washington called a 15-minute
recess. Both groups met sopa
ratolv to discuss the situation.
When they emerged, Will
ard Wynian, associate dean of
students asked Washington
and Countee whether they
would accept broaxl discussion
of the points, but leaving the
details until Thursday.

The BSU chairmen agreed.
When the meeting resumed,
Washington read off the de
mands one by one, and Packer
and the others explained admin
istration positions and plans.
Packer announced that pro
fessors Byron Sher, P. Herbert
Leiderman, and Donald Ken
nedy, history major Tom Trim
bur and one student yet to be
named, will also serve on the
Human Relations Commission.
H" also said he felt the com
mitment to double minority
group enrollment "meets the
substance of" the BSU demand
for proportional representation
of minority groups.
In response to another de
mand for data on minority
student admissions, Rosen
zweig noted that Stanford had
published substantial data on
minority freshman applicants
in a recent report, and indi
cated this would continue.
Replying to the demand for
BSU involvement in minority
group recruitment, Packer said
he thought "it's very important
minority group students be in
volved in the admissions proced
ure. That's the only way it's go
ing to work."
Cuthbertson explained some of
the financing difficulties, calling
them "an enormous financial
problem. We must re-examine
our priorities. We must do-some
thing on a crash basis, and it's
not easy."
Despite the problems, "I can
assure you there is enough per
sonal commitment to get on
with this job," he added.
Kennedy said that the Hu
man Relations Commission
would deal with all discrimi

natory acts mentioned by the
BSU.
Besides commenting on in
creased faculty recruitment of
finority group members, Arrow
said that curriculum revision
would be made and include an
undergraduate special on white
racism and economics courses
on poverty and discrimination.
After the Tresidder meeting,
the newly-formed Students
Against White Racism met in
Bishop Auditorium. About 300
people attended.
The following resolution was
passed:
"We the Students Against
White Racism support fully the
demands of the BSU and feel
that the University must take
further steps in all areas in re
sponse to the racial crises in
America."
Students were urged to sup
port a tentative BSU rally at
noon today in White Plaza, and
to Sign up for working commit
tees in the ASSU office.
Washington said the BSU
would attend tomorrow's meet
ing, but also noted "our response
(to the administration's state
ments) would have to be con
sidered."
He said a BSU reply would be
issued at 10 a.m. today at a
meeting in room 268 of TMU,
and invited Packer and the oth
ers to attend.
University representatives
at tomorrow's session will in
clude Packer, Brown, Arrow,
Rosenzweig, and Lyman.
As the meeting closed Brown
received loud applause when he
thanked Washington "for the
fact that this remained a ra
tional meeting."

HUDDLE —Prof. Robert McAfee Brown (in glasses), Vice Provost
Herbert Packer (bis right) and Associate Dean of Students Wil
lard Wynian (back to camera) discuss demands of Black Student
Union during recess in last night's public meeting on Tresidder
Union terrace.
Stanford administrators
agreed "in substance" last night
at Tresidder Union to nine of
ten demands presented to them
Monday by the Black Student
Union. Early in the meeting,
however, the two groups near
ly reached an impasse.
The confrontation, witnessed
by nearly 1,000 students, fol
lowed a BSU request that the.
administration respond to their
demands at 7 p.m. last night at
TMU.
Vice-Provost Herbert Packer
and oth«*r University repre-j
sentatives at the meeting said
that Stanford would:
• Hire an admissions officer
to deal with recruitment of mi
nority students as soon as a
qualified man is available;
• Encourage recruitment of
faculty members from minor
ity groups;
• Relocate existing funds and
conduct a campus fund-rais
ing drive to raise money to im
plement the BSU demands;

• Implement immediately the
points in a memo of James
Gibbs. professor of anthropolo
gy, on steps needed for Stanford
to guarantee equal employment:
• Allow the BSU to name two
members to the now Human Re
lations Commission, first an
nounced yesterday but in plan
ning for several weeks. The
group will deal with charges of
discrimination, and will accept
complaints from all sources.
These steps arc in addition
to Stanford's commitment, an
nounced late Monday by Pres
ident Wallace Sterling and
Provost Richard Lyman, to
double minority student en
rollment by 1969 and double
the proportion of minority em
ployees "within the year."
The one point administration
representatives refused to agree
to was dismissal of Robert
Rosenzweig,- vice-provost for
minority affairs.
Administration and BSU rep
resentatives will meet Thursday
at 2:30 p.m. to discuss the de

tails of the BSU demands.

ratolv to discuss the situation.

minority group students be in
volved in the admissions proced
ure. That's the only way it's go
ing to work."
Cuthbertson explained some of
the financing difficulties, calling
them "an enormous financial
problem. We must re-examine
our priorities. We must do-some
thing on a crash basis, and it's
not easy."
Despite the problems, "I can
assure you there is enough per
sonal commitment to get on
with this job," he added.

HUDDLE —Prof. Robert McAfee Brown (in glasses), Vice Provost
Herbert Packer (bis right) and Associate Dean of Students Wil
lard Wynian (back to camera) discuss demands of Black Student
Union during recess in last night's public meeting on Tresidder
Union terrace.
Stanford administrators
agreed "in substance" last night
at Tresidder Union to nine of
ten demands presented to them
Monday by the Black Student
Union. Early in the meeting,
however, the two groups near
ly reached an impasse.
The confrontation, witnessed
by nearly 1,000 students, fol
lowed a BSU request that the.
administration respond to their
demands at 7 p.m. last night at
TMU.
Vice-Provost Herbert Packer
and oth«*r University repre-j
sentatives at the meeting said
that Stanford would:
• Hire an admissions officer
to deal with recruitment of mi
nority students as soon as a
qualified man is available;
• Encourage recruitment of
faculty members from minor
ity groups;
• Relocate existing funds and
conduct a campus fund-rais
ing drive to raise money to im
plement the BSU demands;

• Implement immediately the
points in a memo of James
Gibbs. professor of anthropolo
gy, on steps needed for Stanford
to guarantee equal employment:
• Allow the BSU to name two
members to the now Human Re
lations Commission, first an
nounced yesterday but in plan
ning for several weeks. The
group will deal with charges of
discrimination, and will accept
complaints from all sources.
These steps arc in addition
to Stanford's commitment, an
nounced late Monday by Pres
ident Wallace Sterling and
Provost Richard Lyman, to
double minority student en
rollment by 1969 and double
the proportion of minority em
ployees "within the year."
The one point administration
representatives refused to agree
to was dismissal of Robert
Rosenzweig,- vice-provost for
minority affairs.
Administration and BSU rep
resentatives will meet Thursday
at 2:30 p.m. to discuss the de

tails of the BSU demands.
Rosenzweig, Packer, Vice-
President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson, and Professors
Robert McAfee Brown, Kenneth
Arrow, and Donald Kennedy
were present.
Speaking for the BSU were
its co-chairmen, Kenny Wash
ington and Charles Countee,
Frank Satterwhite, and Leti
tia Carter. Professor Gibbs
was also on the panel.
The meeting, originally sched
uled for room 270 but moved
outside because of the large
audience, was begun by Wash
ington. After introductory re
marks, he road the introduction
to the BSU demands.
Packer responded by outlin
ing Stanford's most recent pro
gress in the areas of minority
group admissions and race re
lations.
An impasse developed when
Washington, who began reading
the list of demands one by one,
asked Packer and the others to
reply point by point.
After reading the initial item
on the list, Washington asked
"Are you prepared to respond
to the first demand?"
Packer replied that he was
not.
"The complexities must be
worked out at a later da t e,"
Washington countered, "but we
must have some discussion on
thes n demands now."
Packer was adamant, say
ing, "This is not the atmos
phere. This is neither the time
nor the place to discuss the
points you have brought up.
I've tried to give you a, prog
ress report, I'm sorry if that
is not enough. We want to
talk."
When Countee demanded ei
ther a statement of acceptance
or a timetable of implementa
tion" for the demands, Packer
replied that "we have already
made a beginning. The meeting
Thursday, if you want, is the
beginning of the timetable for
implementation."
Washington again questioned
Packer's refusal to discuss the
issues then and there, saying, "I
don't see the problem here.
These are students. They don't
bite. They have minds. I don't
think it's at all unreasonable to
talk now."
Sensing a lack of progress,
Washington called a 15-minute

HUDDLE —Prof. Robert McAfee Brown (in glasses), Vice Provost
Herbert Packer (bis right) and Associate Dean of Students Wil
lard Wynian (back to camera) discuss demands of Black Student
Union during recess in last night's public meeting on Tresidder
Union terrace.
Stanford administrators
agreed "in substance" last night
at Tresidder Union to nine of
ten demands presented to them
Monday by the Black Student
Union. Early in the meeting,
however, the two groups near
ly reached an impasse.
The confrontation, witnessed
by nearly 1,000 students, fol
lowed a BSU request that the.
administration respond to their
demands at 7 p.m. last night at
TMU.
Vice-Provost Herbert Packer
and oth«*r University repre-j
sentatives at the meeting said
that Stanford would:
• Hire an admissions officer
to deal with recruitment of mi
nority students as soon as a
qualified man is available;
• Encourage recruitment of
faculty members from minor
ity groups;
• Relocate existing funds and
conduct a campus fund-rais
ing drive to raise money to im
plement the BSU demands;

• Implement immediately the
points in a memo of James
Gibbs. professor of anthropolo
gy, on steps needed for Stanford
to guarantee equal employment:
• Allow the BSU to name two
members to the now Human Re
lations Commission, first an
nounced yesterday but in plan
ning for several weeks. The
group will deal with charges of
discrimination, and will accept
complaints from all sources.
These steps arc in addition
to Stanford's commitment, an
nounced late Monday by Pres
ident Wallace Sterling and
Provost Richard Lyman, to
double minority student en
rollment by 1969 and double
the proportion of minority em
ployees "within the year."
The one point administration
representatives refused to agree
to was dismissal of Robert
Rosenzweig,- vice-provost for
minority affairs.
Administration and BSU rep
resentatives will meet Thursday
at 2:30 p.m. to discuss the de

tails of the BSU demands.
Rosenzweig, Packer, Vice-
President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson, and Professors
Robert McAfee Brown, Kenneth
Arrow, and Donald Kennedy
were present.
Speaking for the BSU were
its co-chairmen, Kenny Wash
ington and Charles Countee,
Frank Satterwhite, and Leti
tia Carter. Professor Gibbs
was also on the panel.
The meeting, originally sched
uled for room 270 but moved
outside because of the large
audience, was begun by Wash
ington. After introductory re
marks, he road the introduction
to the BSU demands.
Packer responded by outlin
ing Stanford's most recent pro
gress in the areas of minority
group admissions and race re
lations.
An impasse developed when
Washington, who began reading
the list of demands one by one,
asked Packer and the others to
reply point by point.
After reading the initial item
on the list, Washington asked
"Are you prepared to respond
to the first demand?"
Packer replied that he was
not.
"The complexities must be
worked out at a later da t e,"
Washington countered, "but we
must have some discussion on
thes n demands now."
Packer was adamant, say
ing, "This is not the atmos
phere. This is neither the time
nor the place to discuss the
points you have brought up.
I've tried to give you a, prog
ress report, I'm sorry if that
is not enough. We want to
talk."
When Countee demanded ei
ther a statement of acceptance
or a timetable of implementa
tion" for the demands, Packer
replied that "we have already
made a beginning. The meeting
Thursday, if you want, is the
beginning of the timetable for
implementation."
Washington again questioned
Packer's refusal to discuss the
issues then and there, saying, "I
don't see the problem here.
These are students. They don't
bite. They have minds. I don't
think it's at all unreasonable to
talk now."
Sensing a lack of progress,
Washington called a 15-minute
recess. Both groups met sopa
ratolv to discuss the situation.
When they emerged, Will
ard Wynian, associate dean of
students asked Washington
and Countee whether they
would accept broaxl discussion
of the points, but leaving the
details until Thursday.

The BSU chairmen agreed.
When the meeting resumed,
Washington read off the de
mands one by one, and Packer
and the others explained admin
istration positions and plans.
Packer announced that pro
fessors Byron Sher, P. Herbert
Leiderman, and Donald Ken
nedy, history major Tom Trim
bur and one student yet to be
named, will also serve on the
Human Relations Commission.
H" also said he felt the com
mitment to double minority
group enrollment "meets the
substance of" the BSU demand
for proportional representation
of minority groups.
In response to another de
mand for data on minority
student admissions, Rosen
zweig noted that Stanford had
published substantial data on
minority freshman applicants
in a recent report, and indi
cated this would continue.
Replying to the demand for
BSU involvement in minority
group recruitment, Packer said
he thought "it's very important
minority group students be in
volved in the admissions proced
ure. That's the only way it's go
ing to work."
Cuthbertson explained some of
the financing difficulties, calling
them "an enormous financial
problem. We must re-examine
our priorities. We must do-some
thing on a crash basis, and it's
not easy."
Despite the problems, "I can
assure you there is enough per
sonal commitment to get on
with this job," he added.
Kennedy said that the Hu
man Relations Commission
would deal with all discrimi

natory acts mentioned by the
BSU.
Besides commenting on in
creased faculty recruitment of
finority group members, Arrow
said that curriculum revision
would be made and include an
undergraduate special on white
racism and economics courses
on poverty and discrimination.
