# My Typewriter Is Bugged
## Monday, April 8 
### Michael Sweeney 
Enough of the editorial "we"
and the tissue-paper facade of
satiric humor.
It's very late at night and
I'll probably tear this up in the
morning, but what I want to
say is that this university lost
its head Monday and I loved it.
Stanford couldn't shake off the
King murder; it couldn't go back
to normal. Faculty couldn't go
back to being faculty and admin
istrators couldn't go back to be
ing administrators and students
couldn't go back. To shamelessly
inflict an old bromide, this place
beat with one heart. It was
enough to destroy a cynic's
faith.
Cold reason was conspicuous
by its absence. Otherwise that
Memorial Auditorium thing
never would have happened.
Otherwise we would have told
those nasty black students to
mind their manners. Instead we
took their brazen behavior with
out a wink and came off Christ
like—l mean it—by turning the
other cheek with dignity.
I know. I've watched all you
crazy people since Thursday. All
I heard was: "King. White Rac
ism. King. White Guilt. Do
Something. King." A spell was
cast, surpassing even the shock
following the Kennedy assassin
ation.
So I've been like a lost soul
since Thursday, bewildered by
the irresistible emotion that had
risen to the surface in almost
everyone else. Obviously King's
death only triggered this. It was

an outburst of fear—or guilt—
that had been growing for years.
Thursday's shock was follow
ed by Friday's grief and Satur
day's daze. By Sunday reality
had been left far behind: Rich
ard Lyman encouraging mass
cancellation of classes for the
Memorial Auditorium program.
Knowing full well that he will
be "put on the spot" by black
demands, he goes anyway, and
gets put on the spot.
Kenneth Arrow, the professor
who seemed to dread giving
Econ 1 lectures, getting up on
the Mem Aud stage to appeal
for "new priorities."
A couple of young Political
Science profs telling the provost
that America is going to burn
down unless he comes out for
social justice. (It will burn down
anyway, of course.)
And the audience:
Kick Me Again Harder, blacks.
Be as nasty as you please but
we're still going to do what we
must. Push us out of our seats
in Mem Aud and we'll yield
them with a smile. Get up on
the stage and tell us to go to
hell and we'll give you a stand
ing ovation.
We must have blown those
black student's minds.
After watching two hours of
this Monday afternoon, I was
exhausted.
Back at the Daily office I tell
the other editors I think we
should come out strongly
against coercion by blacks. They
just look at me, silently.

'These blacks aren't acting
any more like disciples of Mar
tin Luther King than the man
who shot him," I protest. My
colleagues pity me.
A flood tide of support for the
black demands engulfs the Daily
office: letters, petitions, announ
cements.
It's infectious. By 8 p.m. I
agreed instantly to reprint the
entire 1,200 word text of the
black student demands. Free, no
less.
Sitting at a typewriter trying
to write a story on what the
entire University did Monday;
what can you write when it says
the same thing in a thousand
different voices?
A big story: black students
interrupt Lyman speech, list de
mands, give ultimatum. But at
10 p.m. it is overturned by a
gigantic story: University says
OK.
I am moved. These men—
these provost and vice provost
types, exquisitely skilled at au
thoritatively saying nothing at
great length—make pledges they
don't have to make, respectfully
request a dialogue with blacks,
and promise this is just a be
ginning. And smile.
An incorrigible radical grudg
ingly comments, "It just shows
what those administrators will
do when they're pushed." I tell
him he's just being cynical.
The last word comes many
grams of caffeine later. I am
told, "You know, Michael, this
is all a dream."
