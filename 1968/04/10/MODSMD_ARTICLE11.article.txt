# 'I Hear A Black Man...'
## 
### 
Martin Luther King, Black Prince of Peace, is dead.
Black manhood cut from a Memphis balcony.
His love song returns to silence within his spilling blood;
His blood returns to the floor and falls to the ground.
And out of that widening, silent shock wave
I hear a black man sobbing, then two, then two million
White America disapproves and goes to bed.
In Harlem, Watts, Detroit, and Chicago, young Blacks
Shot full of speed, carry their pieces tonight.
Stay inside Whitey, and you too, Honky.
The chessmen are on fire and it isn't even Summer.
In a prepared message, the President
Declares a national holiday, of rioting,
While Dow Jones remains unchanged.
Will my blues eyes weep red
And my own white skin rot black with shame
Before the Red, White, and Blue
Turn silent before this clarifying act?
What Black man now, dares sing a love song above
The sound of chaos a coming?
You black soldiers in the fox-holes and trenchs of
Vietnam and the world,
Gentle Martin Luther King is murdered in America today.
Go home.
