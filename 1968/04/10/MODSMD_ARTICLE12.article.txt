# TMU Faces Possible Suit
## 
### PAUL DeLIBAN 
The University may be sued If
three demands presented by the
executive board of the East Palo
Alto Day School are not met.
The demands resulted from a
March 9 incident at Tresidder
store, in which store clerk al
legedy accused black day stu
dents of stealing.
At last night's Tresidder

meeting the Administration
announced that the newly
formed Human Relations Com
mittee will look into the
charges made by the day
school. The committee will in
clude members of the Black
Student Union.
The suit charges the em
ployees of the Tresidder store
(as agents of the University)
with torts of "intentional in
fliction of mental disturbance"
on the children and "assault and
battery" (seizure of a purse is
legally the same as grabbing a
person's arm, East Palo Alto
Day School attorney Thelton
Henderson explained.)
The East Palo Alto Day School
parents demand:
• Stanford make a thorough
investigation into the facts of
the March 9 incident, including
interviews with the children
and teachers involved, the right
to confront accusers, and dismis
sal of the University employees
who "mistreated" the children.
• Make clear to all employees
coming in contact with the pub
lic that policy for treatment of
visitors, especially members of
minority groups, and that em-

ployees be "summarily dismis
sed" if they mistreat visitors.
• Hire a black faculty mem
ber or administrator to deal
with minority problems and re
move such responsibilities from
associate provost Robert M.
Rosenzweig.
Gertrude Wilks, chairman of
the executive board of the Day
School, said in a letter to Pro
vost Richard Lyman that child
ren reported to their teachers
that they had been accused of
stealing and a clerk searched
girls' purses without permission.
In his "Comments on the
March 9, 1968 Incident at Tresid
der Memorial Union," Rosen
zweig said 400-500 youngsters
in two separate groups were pre
sent in the small area around
Tresidder. Because no one re
alized there were two groups
they had difficulty locating the
chaperone responsible for a par
ticular child. All reports agree
it was an extremely confused
situation.
Two men working in the store
were convinced merchandise was
was being stolen by both black
and white children but denied
anyone was searched.
