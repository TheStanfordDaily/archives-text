# Childhood Pain Tied To Height

It seems that when babies are
subjected to painful experiences,
they also grow up to be taller
adults.
Evidence for this surprising
discovery has turned up in a
number of scientific studies in
cluding a new one reported in
the current Journal of Child
Development.
The authors are Prof. Thomas
K. Landauer, Stanford psycholo
gist; Prof. John W. M. Whiting,
Harvard anthropologist; and
Stanford medical student Thom
as M. Jones.
Their research was supported
by the National Institutes of
Health, U.S. Public Health Ser
vice.
The two investigators studied
records of 157 boys and 159
girls from birth to age 18, check
ing the annual stature of the
infants vaccinated against those
who were not. Those vaccinated
became a half-inch to more than
an inch taller than the others.
"Innoculation may be presum
ed to be stressful on several
counts," said the investigators.
"First of all it involves a pain
at the time of occurence, but
this is probably the least signifi
cant of its stressful effects. An
infant who has been innoculated
for smallpox ordinarily shows
symptoms of distress for up to
two or three weeks thereafter."
Other researchers had prev
iously noted the same growth
acceleration phenomenon in lab
oratory rats which as babies re
ceived rough handling, mild
shocks, or chilling.
Even more dramatic evidence
of taller growth among humans
was uncovered in an earlier
study by Profs. Landauer and
