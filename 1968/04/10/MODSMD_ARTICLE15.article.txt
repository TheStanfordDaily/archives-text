# Proclamation: Days Of Concern
## 
### 
April 12 and 13, 1968
We are truly a nation in crisis. The war in Vietnam with
its impact upon our role as a member of the world community
and the assassination of Martin Luther King, symptomatic
of our ever growing l racial and urban problems with their im
pact upon domestic stability and progress, are manifestations
of this crisis. Few periods in the history of the United States
have been characterized by the gravity and magnitude of
national concern and uncertainty which now exists. This
concern and uncertainty pervades all American society; no
aware citizen can ignore its implications. Each of us is
implicated; each is now — more than ever — called upon
to give of our energies and resources for the alleviation of
the problems which beset us.
It is fitting that a university — as an entity within Ameri
can society generally and the academic community specific
ally — should provide a forum before which our most acute
and urgent problems may be authoritatively analyzed and
discussed. Indeed, it is a university's responsibility to make
such opportunities possible.
In recognition of the exigencies of our times the student
body, faculty, and administration of Stanford University
join together in proclaiming April 12 and 13, 1968 as "Days
of Concern" with a common focus on "The University in
a Time of Crisis." "Days of Concern" have been designated
as a short moment during which all persons who share in
the concern of the future of the university, the nation and the
world may come together to reflect upon the task before us.
We hope the programs which have been planned will give
each of us as individuals a clearer insight into the far-reach
ing effects of our social crisis. More important, we hope the
"Days of Conern" will help to guide us individually and col
lectively toward effective action for the alleviation of the
ills of our times.
