# The 						Washington Merry-Go-Round
## Why Is Washington, D.C. In Ruins? 
### Drew Pearson 
WASHINGTON — Washing
ton, long a city of contrasts, is
more divided than ever now.
On one side are the stately
Doric columns of government
buildings, the white bowers of
cherry trees along the tidal
basin, the green grass of the
Mall, greener than ever in the
Apri sun. On the other side are
gaunt, grimy chimneys stand
ing like skeletons from burned
out buildings, the rubble, the
broken glass, the littered streets
of downtown Washington.
Troops, which once stepped
jauntily past the White House
in smart salute, eyes left, to the
tune of martial music on Inaug
ural day, now sleep in laundro
mats or the back of trucks, keep
ing an uneasy on the scene of
desolation.
Not since the British march

on Washington in 1812 has
there been such damage. Gen.
Jubal Early converged his con
federate troops on Washington
in 1864, and nearly took it. The
Klu Klux Klan marched up Pen
nsylvania Avenue, white-robed,
four abreast, in 1922 without
disorder. The Bonus Army of
World War I veterans, ragged
and jobless, were chased down
Pennsylvania Avenue in 1932
while Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur,
beribboned, in spotless uniform,
ordered tanks and cavalry in
pursuit.
None of these saw such holo
caust as seen on the streets of
Washington today.
Why The Violence?
Why? Why should three per
cent of the Negro population be
so consumed with hate as tomake

homeless hundreds of their own
race and endanger relations be
tween both races? There is no
excuse for violence. But it hap
pened. Why should it be so?
There are those who tell
you Lyndon Johnson is to blame,
that he went too far in helping
Negroes.
There are those who point
the finger of blame at Stokely
Carmichael and Black Power ad
vocates of violence. Unquestion
ably, they deserve some of the
blame. Their harangues of hate
ignored the fact that the church
es have gone out of their way
to help Dr. Martin Luther King
plan his Poor People's March,
that King himself preached the
main sermon in the National
Cathedral 10 days ago, that Gov
ernment offices overflow with

Negro employees, some of them
far from efficient, and that in
no city in the world are Negroes
given such opportunity. This, it
is true, is fairly recent.
Others point to the legislative
road block to open housing in
the latest civil rights bill. Af
ter six weeks of agonizing delay,
the bill finally passed the Senate,
only to be blocked in the House
of Representatives by Rep. Wil
liam Colmer, D-Miss., supported
by every Republican member of
the Rules Committee.
Republican-Dixiecrat Road Block
These were: H. Allen Smith,
Calif.; John Anderson, 111.; David
Martin, Neb.; James Quillen,
Tenn.; and Delbert Latta, Ohio.
They do deserve some of the
blame. So does Rep. Jerry Ford,
Mich., the Republican Leader

who can always switch GOP
votes, but who played ball with
the real estate lobby instead.
Also, in part, to blame is Rep.
James Delaney, the Long Island
Democrat, who did the bidding
of the late Cardinal Spellman
when it came to blocking aid
to public schools, yet who
spurned the humanitarian plea
of the new archbishop of New
York, Terrence Cooke, for a bet
ter break for Negroes when it
came to the current civil rights
bill. Delaney also spurned the
joint plea of Speaker John Mo-
Cormack, Rep. Hale Boggs, La.,
his fellow Catholic, and Rep.
Carl Albert, Okla., to switch his
vote. That one vote would have
unbottled the civil rights bill.
Delaney said no.

Troops, which once stepped
jauntily past the White House
in smart salute, eyes left, to the

ural day, now sleep in laundro
mats or the back of trucks, keep
ing an uneasy on the scene of

Not since the British march

on Washington in 1812 has
there been such damage. Gen.
Jubal Early converged his con
federate troops on Washington
in 1864, and nearly took it. The
Klu Klux Klan marched up Pen
nsylvania Avenue, white-robed,
four abreast, in 1922 without
disorder. The Bonus Army of
World War I veterans, ragged
and jobless, were chased down
Pennsylvania Avenue in 1932

beribboned, in spotless uniform,
ordered tanks and cavalry in
pursuit.
None of these saw such holo

Why The Violence?
Why? Why should three per
cent of the Negro population be
so consumed with hate as tomake

homeless hundreds of their own
race and endanger relations be
tween both races? There is no
excuse for violence. But it hap
pened. Why should it be so?
There are those who tell
you Lyndon Johnson is to blame,
that he went too far in helping
Negroes.
There are those who point
the finger of blame at Stokely
Carmichael and Black Power ad
vocates of violence. Unquestion
ably, they deserve some of the
blame. Their harangues of hate
ignored the fact that the church
es have gone out of their way
to help Dr. Martin Luther King
plan his Poor People's March,
that King himself preached the
main sermon in the National
Cathedral 10 days ago, that Gov
ernment offices overflow with

Negro employees, some of them
far from efficient, and that in
no city in the world are Negroes
given such opportunity. This, it
is true, is fairly recent.
Others point to the legislative
road block to open housing in
the latest civil rights bill. Af
ter six weeks of agonizing delay,
the bill finally passed the Senate,
only to be blocked in the House
of Representatives by Rep. Wil
liam Colmer, D-Miss., supported
by every Republican member of
the Rules Committee.
Republican-Dixiecrat Road Block
These were: H. Allen Smith,
Calif.; John Anderson, 111.; David
Martin, Neb.; James Quillen,
Tenn.; and Delbert Latta, Ohio.
They do deserve some of the
blame. So does Rep. Jerry Ford,
Mich., the Republican Leader

who can always switch GOP
votes, but who played ball with
the real estate lobby instead.
Also, in part, to blame is Rep.
James Delaney, the Long Island
Democrat, who did the bidding
of the late Cardinal Spellman
when it came to blocking aid
to public schools, yet who
spurned the humanitarian plea
of the new archbishop of New
York, Terrence Cooke, for a bet
ter break for Negroes when it
came to the current civil rights
bill. Delaney also spurned the
joint plea of Speaker John Mo-
Cormack, Rep. Hale Boggs, La.,
his fellow Catholic, and Rep.
Carl Albert, Okla., to switch his
vote. That one vote would have
unbottled the civil rights bill.
Delaney said no.
