# Oil Still Poses A Challenge
## 
### FRIEDRICH ABEL 
Imagine a 300-foot thick lay
er of immobile oil-bearing sand
stone lying 3000 ft. beneath the
earth's surface. Wells are drill
ed into the formation, and in
one of the borings oil is ignited
under continuous air injection.
A slowly advancing burning
front develops, raises the reser
voir's temperature, and pushes
the oil to production wells some
hundreds of feet away from the
injection well.
All this has become practical
ly feasible, says Professor H.
J. Ramey of the department of
petroleum engineering. "The fire
flood process has been in op
eration in California oil fields
for as long as 10 years. The gen
eral decline in oil production
has been compensated for by
increased use of thermal recov
ery methods to exploit Ameri
ca's heavy oils."
"California's oil production
has hit an all time high due to
that development," Ramey
said.
Because thermal oil produc
tion methods are applied in the
world's oil fields without much
theoretical background, "There
are as many failures as succes
ses.
To answer the question
'Should we stay out of operation
or not in a particular reservoir?'
we have to learn the physical
and chemical processes involv
ed in fire flooding of different
temperature ranges," Ramey ex
plained.
To investigate these problems,
three petroleum engineering
graduate students have built an
oil reservoir model at Stanford's
Lloyd Noble Laboratory. The

experiments, sponsored by Ten
neco Oil Company, started Tues
day under the supervision of
Ramey.
"We try to produce oil from
an oil-sand packed tube in which
the conditions of an actual res
ervoir have been simulated,"
said Gilbert Cady, a doctorate
candidate.
In addition to experiments to
establish the main characteris
tics of the in-situ combustion
process, the research team plans
the investigation of
• "Geothermal production of
steam for electric power gen
eration," which involves the
"stimulation of a geyser," and
• "Oil recovery by hot fluid
injection."
Asked about future develop
ments in the oil industry, Ramey
emphasized the importance of
attempts to exploit the world's
huge reserves of oil shales and
gas, tightly locked within sub
surface rocks.
He cited as an example Proj
ect Gasbuggy — an experiment
that set off the first nuclear ex
plosion sponsored jointly by the
government and industry — was
designed to shatter tight gas
bearing sandstone, thus open
ing it for production.
In some future years 15,000
wells might be drilled into the
Athabaska tar sands, Ramey
said. "Offshore operations, ther
mal projects, and atomic min
ing will gain in importance. But
the profitability of these meth
ods is limited."
"The oil industry is becoming
more and more a responsible
energy supplier of the state
rather than representing high
profit industry," he said.

The most pressing problem
of the oil industry is the lack
of skilled personnel. Although
the petroleum engineer's job is
"a very adventurous one," not
enough young people are at
tracted by " a profession that
requires ingenuity, attention
and technical know-how to cope
with exceedingly complicated
processes," Ramey concluded.

MODEL — There's black gold in them thar subterranean hills, and
Stanford's petroleum research boys are looking for better ways
to get at It. This formidable contraption is a scale model, and a
small one at that. For what it does, see story at right.
