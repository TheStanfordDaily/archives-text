# The 						Inside Track
## It Happens Every Spring 
### Gary Cavalli 
This is a much-anticipated week for sportswriters all over the
country. Not simply because the baseball season is getting under
way, but more importantly because the opening of the baseball
camapign enables each scribe to gaze into his crystal ball and come
up with his own picks (i.e. guesses) as to what will transpire.
Being no exception to the rule, we've decided to go out on a limb
and unveil our own personal prognostications as to what the order
of finish will be in the National League this year.
Picking the probable standings in the NL is about as profitable
as peddling Egyptian flags in Tel-Aviv, since the senior circuit an
nually witnesses a veritable dogfight for the pennant, with any one
of six or seven clubs capable of coming out on top.
But barring any unforseen miracles, such as the installation of
lights in Wrigley Field, the planting of real grass in the Astrodome,
or the sinking of Candlestick Park into the bay, here is the way
things should turn out:
1. San Francisco. With no less than four potential 20-game win
ners, the Giants have the best pitching staff in baseball. The addi
tion of Ron Hunt to a porous infield has made the? SF unit a solid
team. If Herman Franks comes up with a first-rate performance
from the catching corps, the Giants will take it all.
2. Pittsburgh. The Pirates have shown the hitting (six .300 hit
ters), the speed, and the fielding required of a championship club,
but pitching remains a question mark—despite the acquisition of
Jim Bunning.
3. St. Louis. The Cards may look the best on paper of any team
in the league, but they've got one insurmountable obstacle in their
way—the fact that it's almost impossible to win two consecutive
pennants in the NL. Unless youngsters Nelson Briles, Dick Hughes
and Steve Carlton match their fantastic performances of 1967,
the Cards will not repeat.
4. Cincinnati. Before Gary Nolan's departure due to a sore arm,
the Reds' hopes looked bright. But the loss of Nolan, along with
the lack of an established power hitter and a consistent stopper
will make Cincinnati a fourth-place ballclub.
5. Chicago. Leo Durocher's crew will be bolstered by the return
of a full- time Ken Holtzman, but they'd need one or two more
pitchers like him to win the pennant.
6. Los Angeles. The addition of Tom Haller and Zorro Versalles
has helped the Dodgers, but they still miss the consistency of a
Koufax and the offensive punch supplied by Wills and Davis.
7. Atlanta. An unsteady mound corps has kept the Braves from
pennant contention for several years, and it will do so again in
'68.
8. Philadelphia. The loss of Bunning and the injury to Richie
Allen will cause the Phillies to come out of the starting blocks
slowly, too slowly to make anything more than a run for the first
division.
9. Houston. It's an injustice to pick this talented young team
ninth. The Astros, with an improving pitching staff and a some
times explosive offense, could go as high as sixth.
10. New York. The hapless Mets, eternally trying to get out of
the NL cellar, don't have much chance of making it this year.
