# 'Days Of Concern'
## Sen. Case Speech Slated 
### 
Son. Clifford P. Case will
speak on "The War, the Univer
sity, and the Future of Ameri
can Society" Saturday at 2 p.m.
in Memorial Auditorium.
The New Jersey Republican
will be the final scheduled speak
er of the upcoming Days of Con
cern, a two-day program of
speeches, dormitory discussions
and panels focusing on "the uni
versity's response in a time of
crisis." (See the Steering Com
mittee proclamation, page 3.)
Case surprised many of his
colleagues last fell when, from
the Senate Floor, he accused
the President of creating a
"crisis of confidence." John

son, ho said, had "misused and
perverted" the Tonkin Gulf
Resolution which permitted
him to send air strikes against
North Vietnam.
Recently, when Secretary of
State Rusk testified before the
Senate Foreign Rlations Com
mittee on which Case serves, the
Senator escalated his criticism
of America's war policy which
only a year before he had stated
that he "generally supported."
Long a champion of civil
rights, bipartisan foreign policy
and high ethical standards in
politics, Case represented Now
Jersey in the House of Repre
sentatives from 1945 to 1953.

The following year he was elect
ed to the Senate in the State's
closest Senate race in history.
During his campaign Case said
he would vote against assigning
Sen. Joseph McCarthy to any
Congressional investigating com
mittee.
His voting record in Congress
shows him opposing the Strike
Control Bill of 1945 but in favor
of overriding President Tru
man's veto of the Taft-Hartley
Act. In 1945 he opposed the cre
ation of a permanent House
Committee on Un-American Ac
tivities, but in 1948 he helped to
draft the Communist Control
Bill.

He has enhanced his stronpl
civil rights record during his
Senate terms. Last year he
voted in favor of a bill which
.would have changed the Sen
ate fillibuster rules at a time
when filibustering threatened
to impede further civil rights
legislation.
Case's stand on the Vietnam
War had been somewhat more
equivocal. When campaigning
for reelection in I960, he was
considered a "dawk" who "gen
erally agreed" with the "broad
objectives" of the President's
policy, but added, "I reserve my
right and duty to criticize
President" on certain specific
policies.
In the months which follow
ed Case became increasingly cri
tical. He expressed skepticism
over the general election held
in South Vietnam. Last year in
October he told the Senate that
the Administration had used a
"heavy hand" in attempting to
stifle war criticisms.
Last January Case openly
censured Gen. Lewis B. Her
shey's directive stating that
draft obstructors should be re
classified 1-A, calling the move
a violation of free speech.
