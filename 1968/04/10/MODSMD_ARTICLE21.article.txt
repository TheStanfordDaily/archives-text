## Laxmen Snare Comeback Win 
### 
Stanford's laxmen stayed un
defeated over the weekend, but
they had to sneak up on tiptoe
and steal victory while the San
Francisco Lacrosse Club wasn't
looking. Down 4-3 going into the
final period, the Indians struck
three times to salvage a 6-4 win.
The Indians were definitely
down for the game and the San
Francisco team was definitely
up. Under the tutelage of Coach
Ray Gerelecki the San Fran
cisco team displayed a discip
lined attack which surprised
Stanford and scored first with
seven minutes gone in the first
quarter. Bob Burns got the goal
point-blank from a normally in
excusable cross-field assist from
Jack Leckie.
The Indians meanwhile, per
sisted in bad passing and bad
ground ball work, but finally
scored four minutes later on a
wheeling dodge by attackman
Peter Hovey.
Undaunted, and apparently
unphased by Stanford's cham
iponship status and the fact that
they were clear underdogs in

the game, the San Franciscans
struck twice in succession.
Burns scored again and John
Beebe got the first of his two
goals.
On a beautiful dodge, George
Muser scored with two seconds
left in the half to mark the
turning point in the game.

The Indians dominated the
second half and kept the ball
down on the offensive end of the
field for the rest of the game,
but still had some trouble with
San Francisco's outstanding
goalie Bill Thomas, who made
fifteen saves for the afternoon
and was speedy and potent on

the clears. But Muser inched the
Indians closer with a goal, Bob
Hawkins tied it up, and Gay
Urness and John Hanley pro
vided the go-ahead and insur
ance ;goals.
Stanford Coach Don Ronayne
was"** Believed, but none-too
pleased at the victory. "We won,
but fhat was terrible," was his
convrjent. ."Something's got to
happen this week if we're going
to beat £alo Alto." Palo Alto, a
traditional Stanford rival of
mostly Stanford graduate stu
dents, beat San Francisco earlier
in the season.

Stanford's laxmen stayed un
defeated over the weekend, but
they had to sneak up on tiptoe
and steal victory while the San
Francisco Lacrosse Club wasn't
looking. Down 4-3 going into the
final period, the Indians struck
three times to salvage a 6-4 win.
The Indians were definitely
down for the game and the San
Francisco team was definitely
up. Under the tutelage of Coach
Ray Gerelecki the San Fran
cisco team displayed a discip
lined attack which surprised
Stanford and scored first with
seven minutes gone in the first
quarter. Bob Burns got the goal
point-blank from a normally in
excusable cross-field assist from
Jack Leckie.
The Indians meanwhile, per
sisted in bad passing and bad
ground ball work, but finally
scored four minutes later on a
wheeling dodge by attackman
Peter Hovey.
Undaunted, and apparently
unphased by Stanford's cham
iponship status and the fact that
they were clear underdogs in

the game, the San Franciscans
struck twice in succession.
Burns scored again and John
Beebe got the first of his two
goals.
On a beautiful dodge, George
Muser scored with two seconds
left in the half to mark the
turning point in the game.

The Indians dominated the
second half and kept the ball
down on the offensive end of the
field for the rest of the game,
but still had some trouble with
San Francisco's outstanding
goalie Bill Thomas, who made
fifteen saves for the afternoon
and was speedy and potent on

the clears. But Muser inched the
Indians closer with a goal, Bob
Hawkins tied it up, and Gay
Urness and John Hanley pro
vided the go-ahead and insur
ance ;goals.
