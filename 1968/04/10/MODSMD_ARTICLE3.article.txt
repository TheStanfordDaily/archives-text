## New Peace Message Sent; Ambassador Is Optimistic 
### 
CAMP DAVID, Md. (AP)
President Johnson announced
Tuesday a new U.S. message to
North Vietnam and received an
optimistic report of progress in
South Vietnam from the Ameri
can ambassador there.
Except for a late afternoon
visit from the retiring U.S. Pa
sific commander, Adm. U.S.
Grant Sharp, these develop
ments wound up a one-day
strategy session between the
President and his top diplomatic
and military advisers at this
mountain retreat.
The new U.S. message to Ha
noi, the second since the long
deadlock over talks was broken
nearly a week ago, dealt with
alternate sites "which could be
convenient to both sides" in
starting preliminary peace talks,
the President disclosed.
Johnson also stressed accord
among the allies in the ticklish
maneuverings leading toward
possible negotiations with the
Reds.
He said "We have consulted
with our allies" about North
Vietnam's latest talks proposal
and "we are in agreement with
our allies."
The relatively bright picture
of developments in South Viet
nam since the Communist citv
offensive last January came
from Ambassador Ellsworth
Bunker, who arrived from Sai
gon early Tuesday morning.
Bunker reported "a new sense
of danger and urgency and pa
triotism taking hold" in South
Vietnam in the wake of the Red
onslaught on her population cen
ters.
• Kansas City Violence
(AP)—Police used tear gass
against an estimated 1,000 Ne
groes outside City Hall in Kan
sas City on Tuesday, while a
riot death in Baltimore brought
the toll across the nation since
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s
assassination to 29, all but five
of them Negroes.
In 90 cities struck by fire
bombing and looting since
King's death April 4, the prop
erty loss was estimated by the
American Insurance Association
at more than $30 million—and
still rising.
Washington, quiet now in the
grip of 14,000 federal troops, es

timated its losses alone at $13.3
million, highest in the nation.
Widespread incidents of rock
throwing by Negro youths on
Kansas City's East Side led
Gov. Warren E. Hearnes to
place 1,000 Kansas National
Guardsmen on standby alert.
All the city's schools were or
dered closed. Shots were fired
near the business district, but
there were no reports of any in
juries. Property damage was
described as minor.
New lootings and fires broke
out in Baltimore despite the
presence of 10,000 federalized
troops, and soldiers were as
signed to ride fire engines.
In Cincinnati, 1,400 Ohio Na
tional Guardsmen patrolled
streets strewn with debris. The
first riot fatality was recorded
there Monday night when a 30-
year-old white art instructor at
the University of Cincinnati was
pulled from his car and beaten
and stabbed. Police said five
Negro youths attacked him.
• King Funeral Held
ATLANTA (AP) — Dr. Mar
tin Luther King, Jr., shot to
death after a 13-year crusade for
racial equality, was laid to rest
Tuesday in a day-long outpour
ing of tribute.
White and black friends and
dignitaries of high rank paid
their last respects to his mem
ory at King's own simple red
brick church.
At the front of the church sat
the widow, Mrs. Martin Luther
King Jr., and her four children.
Her face veiled, her head erect,
she maintained her composure
even as she heard the recorded
voice of her slain husband say
ing:
"If I die, I want you to be able
to say that I tried to love and
serve humanity ... If you want
to say that I was a drum major,
say that I was a drum major for
justice. Say that I was a drum
major for peace."
The words were taped from
one of King's recent sermons, in
which he dwelt on the inevitabil
ity of his own death. Not long
afterward, on April 4, he was
shot by a sniper in Memphis,
Tenn. The assassin is still at
large.
After the ceremony, on a sun
"washed greensward at More

house College, King's alma ma
ter, legions of admirers which
police said numbered 150,000
gathered for a two-hour memo
rial service.
It concluded with the mass of
mourners linked hands and
singing the old slave song which
King's civil rights movement
popularized as its own anthem,
"We Shall Overcome."
• Viet Offensives Halt
SAIGON (AP)—The end of
five allied offensive operations
was announced Tuesday and a
lull descended on all battle
fronts. But U.S. officers were
unable to see any reciprocal de
escalation because of peace
moves.
The five operations, two of
which began last year, were
around Saigon and left 3,336 en
emy killed, the U.S. Command
said. The sweeps cost 183 U.S.
soldiers killed and 1,358 wound
ed.
U.S. officers said they saw no
sign of enemy de-escalation.
They speculated the enemy may
be regrouping during the lull
for new attacks.
• Rights Rill Vote Near
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
civil rights bill was cleared by
the House Rules Committee
Tuesday for a sudden-death vote
that could put it on President
Johnson's desk by nightfall Wed
nesday.
By a 9-6 vote the committee ap
proved a resolution that would
permits only one hour's debate
before the vote is taken, and no
amendments to the bill would be
allowed.
Opponents of the broad open
housing provision in the bill have
one more chance to block the
vote and send it to a conference
with the Senate in hopes of
working out a compromise.
That will come on a procedural
motion just before the final vote.
If the opponents can muster a
majority, they can open up the
resolution to amendment and
then try to send the bill to con
ference.
• Heyns On Students
LOS ANGELES (AP) — In
creasing student participation
in university affairs was pre
dieted Tuesday by Dr. Roger W.
Heyns, chancellor of the Uni
versity of California at Berkeley.
Heyns said minority students
and adults are continuing their
education in increasing num
bers. "About 2 per cent of the
current student body is Negro,"
he added.
The adults, he said, are re
turning not so much for ad
vanced degrees as to improve
skills. "This will lead to a more
flexible curriculum with an em
phasis on individual learning,"
he said.
Heyns gave his views at a
news conference before address
ing a Town Hall luncheon on
the subject "Berkeley, The Long
View."
• New Aides For Rocky
NEW YORK (AP)—Gov. Nel
son A. Rockefeller announced
Tuesday that he is assembling a
staff of advisers and researchers
to help him formulate positions
on the "great national and inter
national issues before us."
He named four men and said
he is preparing to state his poli
cies on foreign and domestic
problems confronting the United
States.
In a statement issued by his
office, the governor said "other
expert advisers in specific fields"
will be brought into the staff.
The four named were Dr. Hen
ry Kissinger of Harvard Univer
sity, Dr. Richard Nathan of the
Brookings Institute, Oscar Reu
bhausen, a New York City law
yer, and John Emmett Hughes,
widely known writer.
Rockefeller announced March
21 that he would not be a candi
date for the Republican nomina
tion for president. He said, how
ever:
"I have said that I stood ready
to answer to any true and mean
ingful call from the Republican
party to serve it and the nation.
I still so stand. I would be dere
lict or uncandid were I to say
otherwise."

• Czech 'Slow Down 9
PRAGUE (AP) — Communist
party chief Alexander Dubcek
told ultraprogressives Tuesday
to slow down their drive to eject
old guard elements from the
party and concentrate for the
time being on improving Czech
oslovakia's economy.
In a statement, Dubcek spoke
out against a proposal for a spe
cial party congress this summer
to oust Antonin Novotny and
some of his followers from seats
they still hold on the Communist
party's Central Committee.
Dubcek replaced the Stalinist
lie ruler in January.
Instead of concentrating on
"cadre problems," Dubcek said,
the party should prepare pro
posals on economic measures, a
new wage structure and a new
state constitution for presenta
tion at the regular party con
gress scheduled for late 1969. It
is expected to be advanced.
Dubcek's statement appeared
directed at a liberal faction
headed by Ota Sik, architect of
the nation's plans for economic
reform and a deputy premier in
the new government which took
office Tuesday with handshakes
from President Ludvik Svoboda
and pledges of loyalty to "the
cause of socialism."
