# Transport Program Director Criticizes Lack Of Planning
## 
### VAL WESTEN 
Discussing "Future Transpor
tation" last night at Tresidder
Union, a transportation export
said that the one single most
pressing problem is lack of plan
ning.
As Karl Ruppenthal, director
of Stanford's Transportation
Management Program, sees it,
"Unrestricted individual mOTiili
ty can only be restricting the mo

bility of the rest of us." He cited
as an extreme example the Los
Angeles freeway at 5 p.m.
Lack of planning is what makes
such traffic tie-ups possible, ac
cording to Ruppenthal. He also
noted that rapid transit develop
ment was a "must in metropoli
tan areas." However, the condi
tions will bccome worse before
the situation is faced directly, he
predicted.

As far as moving great num
bers of people, Ruppenthal fore
sees "amazing technological de
velopments in store."
In the area of fast trains, the
Ohio line in Japan and certain
other lines in Soctland and the
eastern U.S. have proven effect
ive.
Two other "promising fields"
are those dealing with hydrofoil
boats and helicopters.
In the field of aviation, "We
can't even see 40 years ahead,
but we can be sure that technolo
gy will continue to increase at
an ever increasing rate," Rup
penthal stated.
The giant Boeing 747 is now
near completion and the operat
ing costs for it will be at least 30
per cent less than for either the
707 or the DC-8 jets while the
passenger-carrying potential
will be increased to near 500.
He gave briefly the pros and
cons of supersonic transport.
On the one hand, air speed
could be increased about three
times. The chief draw backs,
however, are that financially the
SST might never pay for itself
and the U.S. taxpayer would be
left making up the difference.
More important, the environ
mental problems include inade
quate airport facilities and the
sonic boom which would "grace
the earth wherever it might
travel."
One great innovation in trans
portation that was well received
was the idea of a "people pipe
line." Piping petroleum is pres
ently one of the most efficient
shipping methods available.
There has been talk of piping
other commodities, such as
orange juice from Florida to
New York City.

the situation is faced directly, he
predicted.

As far as moving great num
bers of people, Ruppenthal fore
sees "amazing technological de
velopments in store."
In the area of fast trains, the
Ohio line in Japan and certain
other lines in Soctland and the
eastern U.S. have proven effect
ive.
Two other "promising fields"
are those dealing with hydrofoil
boats and helicopters.
In the field of aviation, "We
can't even see 40 years ahead,
but we can be sure that technolo
gy will continue to increase at
an ever increasing rate," Rup
penthal stated.
The giant Boeing 747 is now
near completion and the operat
ing costs for it will be at least 30
per cent less than for either the
707 or the DC-8 jets while the
passenger-carrying potential
will be increased to near 500.
He gave briefly the pros and
cons of supersonic transport.
On the one hand, air speed
could be increased about three
times. The chief draw backs,
however, are that financially the
SST might never pay for itself
and the U.S. taxpayer would be
left making up the difference.
More important, the environ
mental problems include inade
quate airport facilities and the
sonic boom which would "grace
the earth wherever it might
travel."
One great innovation in trans
portation that was well received
was the idea of a "people pipe
line." Piping petroleum is pres
ently one of the most efficient
shipping methods available.
There has been talk of piping
other commodities, such as
orange juice from Florida to
New York City.
Discussing "Future Transpor
tation" last night at Tresidder
Union, a transportation export
said that the one single most
pressing problem is lack of plan
ning.
As Karl Ruppenthal, director
of Stanford's Transportation
Management Program, sees it,
"Unrestricted individual mOTiili
ty can only be restricting the mo

bility of the rest of us." He cited
as an extreme example the Los
Angeles freeway at 5 p.m.
Lack of planning is what makes
such traffic tie-ups possible, ac
cording to Ruppenthal. He also
noted that rapid transit develop
ment was a "must in metropoli
tan areas." However, the condi
tions will bccome worse before
the situation is faced directly, he
predicted.
