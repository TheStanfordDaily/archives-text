# Stanford Frosh Suffered 'Reign Of Terror' Until 1906
## 
### BARBARA HYLAND 
The reign of terror is usually
associated with the French Rev
olution, but for old Stanford
graduates who look back and
shudder, it was the years be
tween 1904 and 1906 when haz
ing was at its peak.
In 1910 a faculty committee
defined hazing as "including all
practices which compel a stu
dent to submit to treatment
from fellow students that is
humiliating or dangerous."
Upperclassmen banded togeth
er and used terrorizing tactics
on the freshmen. The most com
mon practice was "tubbing'' for
which Encina Hall was notor
ious. The victim was held under
water until, with no breath left,
he began to "bubble."
To protect themselves from
having to endure this persecu
tion, freshmen often armed
themselves with clubs. To leave
unprotected from one's room
was a courageous act.

Even though many students
locked and barricaded their
doors, they were not assured
of safety. This often aggravated
the upperclassmen who were
known to smash doors and tran
soms. Furniture throwing was
another pasttime.
The number of students who
participated in hazing is un
known. However in 1906, after
pressure from the Board of
Trustees who sought better dis
cipline, the announcement was
made that "hazing in all its
forms is absolutely prohibited,
and the privacy of students'
rooms must not be invaded
against the will of the person
concerned."
Hazing did continue, and sur
prisingly had some strong stu
dent support. The Sequoia Mag
azine in 1908 wrote, "To us it
is impossible of conception that
any member of the faculty
would deem worthy of his con

sideration such harmless cus
toms as tubbing. Only those who
have not actually been fresh
men can fail to see the positive
value of the mild hazing which
we have here. It hurts no one
and every sophomore realizes
full well how much less a fool
he is than he would have been
without his freshman training."
This was not the opinion of
President Wilbur. In 1916, he
vehemently denounced hazing
as "a combination of cowardice
and bullying, absolutely un-Am
erican. It overpowers and
crushes the individual. . . At
best it is contemptible and at
worst criminal. No one who de
lights in fair play can ever get
any satisfaction from such an
act."
The practice of hazing dwin
dled especially after the bath
tubs were removed from En
cina Hall in 1919. Its vestiges
remained in fraterity initiations,
however.

graduates who look back and
shudder, it was the years be
tween 1904 and 1906 when haz
ing was at its peak.
In 1910 a faculty committee
defined hazing as "including all
practices which compel a stu
dent to submit to treatment
from fellow students that is
humiliating or dangerous."
Upperclassmen banded togeth
er and used terrorizing tactics
on the freshmen. The most com
mon practice was "tubbing'' for
which Encina Hall was notor
ious. The victim was held under
water until, with no breath left,
he began to "bubble."
To protect themselves from
having to endure this persecu
tion, freshmen often armed
themselves with clubs. To leave
unprotected from one's room
was a courageous act.

Even though many students
locked and barricaded their
doors, they were not assured
of safety. This often aggravated
the upperclassmen who were
known to smash doors and tran
soms. Furniture throwing was
another pasttime.
The number of students who
participated in hazing is un
known. However in 1906, after
pressure from the Board of
Trustees who sought better dis
cipline, the announcement was
made that "hazing in all its
forms is absolutely prohibited,
and the privacy of students'
rooms must not be invaded
against the will of the person
concerned."
Hazing did continue, and sur
prisingly had some strong stu
dent support. The Sequoia Mag
azine in 1908 wrote, "To us it
is impossible of conception that
any member of the faculty
would deem worthy of his con

sideration such harmless cus
toms as tubbing. Only those who
have not actually been fresh
men can fail to see the positive
value of the mild hazing which
we have here. It hurts no one
and every sophomore realizes
full well how much less a fool
he is than he would have been
without his freshman training."
This was not the opinion of
President Wilbur. In 1916, he
vehemently denounced hazing
as "a combination of cowardice
and bullying, absolutely un-Am
erican. It overpowers and
crushes the individual. . . At
best it is contemptible and at
worst criminal. No one who de
lights in fair play can ever get
any satisfaction from such an
act."
The practice of hazing dwin
dled especially after the bath
tubs were removed from En
cina Hall in 1919. Its vestiges
remained in fraterity initiations,
however.
The reign of terror is usually
associated with the French Rev
