## Theta Delts Back Abernethy 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Professor Abernethy propos
ed Monday in Memorial Audi
torium that fraternities at Stan
ford demand that their national
organizations drop all racial dis
criminatory clauses. He suggest
ted that, if these demands were
met, the Stanford fraternities
should disaffiliate from the na
tionals.
Theta Delta Chi would like to
go on record as endorsing this
proposal. Our national voted in
1948 to remove the discrimina
tory clause from its charter. The
initiative of the Stanford chap
ter was primarily responsible
for this action.
We urge that all fraternities
at Stanford confront their na
tionals over this issue in the
hope that similar action might
be forced, and that they be will
ing to disaffiliate if such con
frontation proves futile.
We believe this to be a small,
but not totally insignificant, way
in which we can seek to erase
the institutional racism that
exists today in white America.

Daily 9 s Schwartz Seen
As Spy On Phi Delts
Editor, The Daily:
In the days since the assassi
nation of Dr. King, the Daily
has unfailingly recorded the ap
parent lack of reaction toward
this event by the brothers of
Phi Delta Theta This reporting
has been so thorough that I can
not help but imagine a poignant
story of newsgathering effort
that must have gone on behind
the scenes:
Immediately after news of the
assassination was received over
the Daily teletypes, the editor
immediately dispatched an in
trepid reporting staff to the Phi
Delt house roof. They watched
all exits for several hours to
note any house members run
ning tearfully into the street.
Another team crouched under
the dinner table to catch any
hints of subdued conversation
concerning the ramifications of
Dr. King's death.
The negative findings of these
two teams did not deter Daily
hopes for some sort of response,
albeit subtle, from Phi Delta
Theta. Crack reporter Marshall
Schwartz labored into the week
end, recording decibel levels of
their rush parties and compar
ing them with the neighboring
SAE's. He noted that the Phis
grovelled on into the night (un
til the ungodly hour of one
o'clock), while their neighbors
struck a clear blow for racial
equality by quitting an hour
earlier.
Discouraging as the results
have been so far, the Daily will
undoubtedly continue its prob
ing. Perhaps an examination of
this week's Phi Delt linen will
yield evidence of increases in
insominia or bedwetting among
house members.
It certainly seems inconceiv
able to the Daily staff that the
Phis could continue living in
much the same manner as they
have in the past. However, let me
suggest a possible explanation
for this sort of behavior:
The brothers of Phi Delta
Theta might just realize that a
pause of one minute (i.e., the
New York Stock Exchange) or
a pause of one hour (an SAE
party) does not necessarily prove
concern or provide solutions for
the racial situation.
The brothers may also re
alize that whatever the degree
of their concern, the Daily might
be one of the last places in
which it is recognized, despite
the efforts of its staff.

Reply To The Reply:
Kennedy A Show Horse
Editor, The Daily:
RE: the reply by student sup
porters of Kennedy to the Daily
editorial for McCarthy. If Ken
nedy takes such "strong and
controversial stands," why was
Kennedy willing to support
Johnson for re-election when
Kennedy was so opposed to the
Vietnam war, which Johnson
supports?
Why did Kennedy suddenly
announce his candidacy for the
Democratic nomination for Pres
ident when McCarthy did so
well in the New Hampshire pri
mary? Because he saw there
was support for McCarthy's po
sition. Because Kennedy felt he
could run with good hope of

success since he saw i f wouldn't
be suicide for his political career
to oppose Johnson. Is this
strength of character?
As for Kennedy's record and
McCarthy's lack of it, there is
an old saying around the U.S.
Senate: if you want publicity,
be a show horse; if you want to
do a good job and earn the re
spect of your colleagues, be a
work horse. It is pretty obvious
Senator Kennedy is trying for
the blue ribbon.

Editor's Column Called
Bland, Torpid, Inane
Editor, The Daily:
Your article of Monday en
titled "Outburst at Stanford U.,"
while perhaps appearing cute
and clever in the eyes of its
originator, could only impress
me as being a bland and torpid
literary attempt.
Totally devoid of originality,
it assayed (and, in part, was
quite successful) to inculcate
an aura of ludicrousness into a
very serious evolution of events.
The appalling circumstances of
the last several days (and of
the last several years, for that
matter) do not readily lend
themselves to this type of face
tious treatment.
Messrs. Hoppe and Buchwald,
familiar to all Daily readers, fur
nish us with enough of these
inane parodies on the contemp
orary scene. Surely the editor
of this tabloid can utilize a bet
ter and more constructive me
dium through which to commu
nicate his feels on these vital
issues.

'Groveling' To BSU
Is Disheartening
Editor, The Dally:
Thoroughly disgusted by Mon
day's Colloquim, I would like to
remind my fellow white Anglo-
Saxons that groveling at the

feet of the Negro community in
delicious self-abasement is no
cure for the sickness of the soci
ety in which we live.
The cheering with which the
demands of the BSU were met,
and the "let's get on the band
wagon" frenzy of the suggestion
that a White Students' Union
be formed to secure implemen
tation of BSU demands were not
only ridiculous but dishearten
ing because they so thoroughly
demonstrated the fact that Mon
day's program's primary func
tion was to serve as a conven
ient catharsis for uncomfortable
whites who in two or three
months will be tired of the new
fad of concern for the Negro
and will start looking for
something else to talk long and
importantly about. . . .
Groveling will accomplish
nothing: we need more than
catharsis and fickle commit
ment.

Do Black Students
Really Oppose Racism ?
Editor, The Dally:
I'm disturbed to find that I'm
being persecuted and maligned.
I find that certain Black Power
advocates accuse me of racist
hatred.
I find that they will not sepak
to me, just as they would not
converse with Provost Lyman,
but instead make demands. I
find that they will not allow me
to be a part of their group, or
their cause. It brings only one
question. Is it racism they op
pose?

Maybe King W / as Shot
By Black Assassin
Editor, The Daily:
No one seems to have asked
himself whether Dr. King's
assassin might have been black.
Does no one remember the at
tempts on Roy Wilkins and oth
ers recently, and the assassin
ation of Malcolm X?

Holding Class Monday
Showed Responsibility
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to commend those
members of the Stanford faculty
who recognized their responsi
bilities and held classes Monday.
One makes a better world by
doing one's bestâ€”not by ceas
ing to function.
ROBERT SPANNER
Attack On Fraternities
Shoivs Personal Bias
Editor, The Daily:
Some of this newspaper's
latest articles regarding Martin
Luther King's assassination
have made it apparent that a
few of its writers ... do not
care much for fraternities . . .
What I do want to point out
and what especially nauseates
me is the fact that certain peo
ple from this newspaper capi
talized on a grave and serious
situation to make certain ex
plicit attacks on fraternities and
that these attacks were not only
unjustified and irresponsible
but totally irrelevant.
It is difficult for me to believe
that Taubman or Schwartz and
those who supported their ar
ticles have much concern or un
derstanding over what happen
ed or why it happened when
they maliciously and thought
lessly exploited the situation in
order to expound a viewpoint
which itself has its roots in a
rigid, personal prejudice.

He had a dream
That men (created equal)
With justice and
Liberty
And self-evident truths
Exist;
But was quickly
(and effectively)
Awakened
By one well-placed
American
bullet.
