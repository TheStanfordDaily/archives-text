And you still call us a phone company?
We really don't mind.
After all, it wasn't that long ago that we were just in the telephone business. But
now, because we're involved in so much more, we need bright college graduates
with practically any kind of degree, whether it's in Engineering or Commerce.
Ask your placement director about us. The misunderstood phone company at
730 3rd Avenue, N.Y. 10017.
