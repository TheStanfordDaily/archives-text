# Dorm Chiefs Will Leave
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
Joe Higgins and Bill Leland,
directors of Wilbur and Stern
Halls, plan to leave their posi
tions at the end of this academic
year.
Their departure heads a large
exodus of housing personnel be
fore next fall. Eight faculty
residents will vacate cottages
and apartments, including four
of eight positions at Wilbur,
and both posts at fraternity
clusters.
The turnover has given added
urgency to an ongoing reassess
ment in the dean of students
office of the functions and re
sponsibilities of housing admin
istrators and faculty residents.
No new personnel will be select
ed until this study has been com
pleted.
Faculty residents leaving Wil
bur are Lucio Ruotolo, Law
rence Thomas, George Rigg, and
Martin Evans. Lawrence Ben
ningson is leaving Branner, An
thony Doob is retiring from his
post at Stern, and the Rathbuns
and Lagerstrums will conclude
their stays in fraternity clusters
Nos. 1 and 2.
Higgins and Leland will re
main at Stanford finishing work
on their Ph.D. requirements,
both in the education school.
They hope to remain associated
with the residence program, pos
sibly by becoming faculty resi
dents. No final decision has been
reached on such plans.
Their departure, which was
solely voluntary, comes when
the functions of their offices are
being reassessed in light of the
changed residence configuration
at Stanford this year and par
ticularly next year.
Sally Mahoney, assistant to
the dean of students and organ

izer of residence plans, says
that the new multiplicity in resi
dences next year will create
new problems for administra
tors. Because Wilbur, Stern,
Roble, Florence Moore and La
gunita will have a wide variety
of housing ranging from all
male, all freshman, to co-ed, ad
ministrators will need a broad
outlook and perspective.
Higgins, Leland, and Miss Ma
honey all suggested it might be
necessary to have a coordina
tor responsible for freshmen in
the central housing office to over
see freshmen from Branner and
Lagunita.
Miss Mahoney noted that a re
assessment was planned before
Leland and Higgins decided to
leave. She said that some of the
many questions needing discus
sion are how residential support
can be improved for deprived
students, and how residential
units can respond to advising
programs that are now being
formulated.
Higgins and Leland are both
concluding their second year as
directors. Higgins took over the
Wilbur position after two years
as a faculty resident. During
the second year he was Program
Director.
Higgins' appointment came
after Eric Hutchinson left the
directorship following a one year
stand marked by explosive con
troversy and ending in a feud
with sponsors on their selection
system.
Higgins feeds optimistic about
Wilbur's future, an optimism
shared by Leland when he talks
about Stern. Leland ieels there's
a new vitality in individual Stern
houses.
Replacements for all vacant
positions will be announced in
several weeks.

Roble, Florence Moore and La
gunita will have a wide variety
of housing ranging from all
male, all freshman, to co-ed, ad
ministrators will need a broad
outlook and perspective.
Higgins, Leland, and Miss Ma
honey all suggested it might be
necessary to have a coordina
tor responsible for freshmen in
the central housing office to over
see freshmen from Branner and
Lagunita.
Miss Mahoney noted that a re
assessment was planned before
Leland and Higgins decided to
leave. She said that some of the
many questions needing discus
sion are how residential support
can be improved for deprived
students, and how residential
units can respond to advising
programs that are now being
formulated.
Higgins and Leland are both
concluding their second year as
directors. Higgins took over the
Wilbur position after two years
as a faculty resident. During
the second year he was Program
Director.
Higgins' appointment came
after Eric Hutchinson left the
directorship following a one year
stand marked by explosive con
troversy and ending in a feud
with sponsors on their selection
system.
Higgins feeds optimistic about
Wilbur's future, an optimism
shared by Leland when he talks
about Stern. Leland ieels there's
a new vitality in individual Stern
houses.
Replacements for all vacant
positions will be announced in
several weeks.
Joe Higgins and Bill Leland,
directors of Wilbur and Stern
Halls, plan to leave their posi
tions at the end of this academic
year.
Their departure heads a large
exodus of housing personnel be
fore next fall. Eight faculty
residents will vacate cottages
and apartments, including four
of eight positions at Wilbur,
and both posts at fraternity
clusters.
The turnover has given added
urgency to an ongoing reassess
ment in the dean of students
office of the functions and re
sponsibilities of housing admin
istrators and faculty residents.
No new personnel will be select
ed until this study has been com
pleted.
Faculty residents leaving Wil
bur are Lucio Ruotolo, Law
rence Thomas, George Rigg, and
Martin Evans. Lawrence Ben
ningson is leaving Branner, An
thony Doob is retiring from his
post at Stern, and the Rathbuns
and Lagerstrums will conclude
their stays in fraternity clusters
Nos. 1 and 2.
Higgins and Leland will re
main at Stanford finishing work
on their Ph.D. requirements,
both in the education school.
They hope to remain associated
with the residence program, pos
sibly by becoming faculty resi
dents. No final decision has been
reached on such plans.
Their departure, which was
solely voluntary, comes when
the functions of their offices are
being reassessed in light of the
changed residence configuration
at Stanford this year and par
ticularly next year.
Sally Mahoney, assistant to
the dean of students and organ

izer of residence plans, says
that the new multiplicity in resi
dences next year will create
new problems for administra
tors. Because Wilbur, Stern,
Roble, Florence Moore and La
gunita will have a wide variety
of housing ranging from all
male, all freshman, to co-ed, ad
ministrators will need a broad
outlook and perspective.
