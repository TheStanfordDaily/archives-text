# The
						Scapegoat
## 
### 
Like practically all the other disputes between the Black Stu
dent Union and the University administration, the question of
Vice Provost Robert Rosenzweig's handling of minority group
affiairs is a sham.
The BSU wants Rosenzweig relieved of the part of his job
concerning minority affairs and replaced by a black administra
tor. The administration says no, refusing to make Rosenzweig a
"scapegoat.''
But the University has promised "adequate staffing and fund
ing" to carry out its new policies in minority group admissions,
employment, faculty and courses. This will involve an enor
mous work load. Vice Provost Rosenzweig, a busy man, has never
been able to give these issues enough attention.
Solution: hire a black administrator, answerable to Rosenzweig,
to handle minority group affairs. This would probably please no
one more than Rosenzweig himself.
At their meeting today, the administration and the BSU can
probably reach exact agreement on every issue—if they try.
