# Days Of Concern Go Beyond War
## 
### 
The upcoming Days of Concern, Friday and Saturday, are
clearly not what the student legislature had in mind when it
passed a resolution last quarter calling for a day of speeches and
demonstrations. Dismaying as some may find that development,
what has emerged from the weeks of planning and talks is still
a first-rate program of speeches, panels and discussions.
The subject has been broadened. The overall topic is no longer
simply the war and the draft but all the ills that afflict our society
and our University in these troublesome times. And the spectrum
of opinions to be represented on the panels may give the campus
some of the liveliest arguments it has seen in a good many months.
Friday afternoon, we will hear Roger Hilsman speak. Hilsman
is a former State Department officer who quit soon after Kennedy's
death; now he teaches at Columbia. David Schoenbrun, who will
speak Saturday morning, has journalistic and scholarly creden
tials on Vietnam that few men can equal. He too now teaches at
Columbia. Saturday afternoon the Days of Concern will end with
an address by Senator Clifford Case, whose recent about-face on
the Vietnam war angered many of his hawkish colleagues.
And who would have thought for example, of ever seeing Da
vid Ransom, the crusading editor of the radical Midpeninsulu Ob
server, on the same stage as Engineering Prof. William Rambo,
whose work with the Defense Department has long been one of
Ransom's favorite targets?
Most gratifying to the Days of Concern organizers has been
the enthusiastic response of the dozens of faculty members who
will be taking part in after-dinner talks in the residences Friday
night. The administration, for its part, has contributed time, effort
and a major share of the cost of the program, and despite some
students' grumbling about "co-optation" and "softening," the
fact is the University has, as an institution, never before given
such strong backing to an event of this kind.
What worries the Days of Concern organizers, however, is un
certainty about how students will respond to the program. Some
say students have had all the talking they need, others say stu
dents have not even really begun to talk, let alone question, let
alone act. In different ways, happily and unhappily, both are
right.
