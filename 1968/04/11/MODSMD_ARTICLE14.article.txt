						Washington Merry-Go-Rouna
## Rockefeller Will Enter Race

WASHINGTON—Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller has definitely decid
ed to announce for President of
the United States.
He has confided this to friends
following a family conference
over the weekend, and expects
to make an announcement later
this week.
The decision came partly as a
result of the death of Dr. Mar
tin Luther King and the tragic
events which followed. Race re
lations is a subject to which the
governor has devoted a consider
able part of his life, dating back
to a period before he became
governor. The Rockefeller fam
ily has long been active in rais
ing money for the Negro Col
lege Fund and over a period of
years has contributed approxi
mately $40 million.
Rockefeller's associates say
that he could not very well dif
fer with President Johnson on
the war in Vietnam. He and the
President have generally seen
eye to eye on the war.
They have also agreed on race
relations. However, with John
son bowing out of the race and
Nixon, who has never been an
outstanding leader on race rela
tions, emerging as the GOP
front runner, Rockefeller felt
that a strong voice for racial
harmony should emerge in the
Republican party.
He has decided to call upon
his old friend Sen. Thruston
Morton of Kentucky, former

chairman of the Republican Na
tional Committee. Emmett
Hughes of Newsweek, another
old friend, will serve as head of
his brain trust. Though it will
be too late to enter any key pri
maries, Rockefeller will stage a
vigorous campaign for the Re
publican nomination.
Burning Was Planned
Negroes who burned and loot
ed in Washington were definite
ly not inspired by the death of
Martin Luther King. This is one
factor which makes non-violent
Negroes so bitter. Well in ad
vance of King's death, black
power leaders had shown mem
bers of the Urban Rehabilitation
Corporation, a group trying to
improve Negro conditions, a
plan for burning every store on
Seventh Street between Hand
T Streets. The list carried in
structions to destroy credit rec
ords of Negro indebtedness. It
also gave a list of gasoline sta
tions which would sell fuel for
Molotov cocktails.
When the burning started,
some white businesses which
had cooperated with Negroes
were spared; but there was no
clearcut system about it.
For instance, Morton Gerber,
who is white but operates a
chain of theatres in the Negro
area, had none of his theatres
touched. He has cooperated
with the Head Start and poverty
programs, and was a member
of Vice President Humphrey's
committee and last summer

showed free motion pictures to
2,000 young Negroes every af
ternoon.
Drug Fair, whose chief owner,
Milton Elsberg, has served on
various interracial committees,
apparently was on the exempt
list, as were the Giant food
stores, whose chief executive,
Joe Danzansky, has been active
in interracial relations.
On the other hand, Safeway,
which has not been so active,
had one of its stores in the Ne
gro ghetto gutted.
However, Morton Lebtwotz,
who operates the Morton depart
ment stores in Negro areas, has
been in the forefront in working
for racial harmony. He began
20 years ago, long before most
Washingtonians realized the
need. His stores were looted and
burned.
Oscar Dodek, who operates the
D. J. Kaufman clothing stores,
has served on various commit
tees for racial cooperation, but
his stores were looted.
Carmichael Went Too Far
The Justice Department at last
is preparing to move against
Stokely Carmichael, the Negro
rabble-rouser, on charges of al
leged sedition. His incendiary
role in the Washington riots
was the last straw.
Attorney General Ramsey
Clark, who previously has ig
nored Congressional cries for
Carmichael's scalp, decided that

the Negro firebrand had finally
gone too far.
At a news conference, Carmi
chael called upon Negroes to
"get guns" and "retaliate against
white America." He declared
that Negroes who have been
dying in Vietnam, "might as
well take as many white men as
possible with them."
"When white America killed
Dr. King . . . she declared war
on black America,' cried Carmi
chael.
Previously, Clark had been un
able to find witnesses who
would testify in court that they
had heard Carmichael make se
ditious statements. His most vi
cious anti-American statements
were made overseas in commu
nist countries. Since his return,
he has been careful not to re
peat statements that might in
criminate him.
But in his efforts to whip up
Negro mobs, he may have
crossed the legal line. Curious
ly, he started out to quiet the
gathering Negroes, pleading
"Not now, not now!" But later
he began screaming for vio
lence.
The New York Times report
ed that at Howard University he
brandished a pistol and yelled:
"Don't loot! Shoot!" The source,
however, turned out to be a 13-
year-old messenger boy, whom
the Times has been reluctant to
make available to government
agents.
