## A 						Phi Delt Criticizes National Policy 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Recently the Theta Delts back
ed Professor Abernethy's pro
posal that fraternities at Stan
ford demand their national or
ganizations drop all discrimina
tory clauses. As a member of
Phi Delta Theta, I'd like to add
our support.
At our annual banquet in San
Francisco, last year, the for
malities soon became a shout
ing match between members
of our house, the Phi Delt chap
ter at Davis, and National Presi
dent Stan Brown.
The issue was discrimination,
which, according to our charter
includes not only Negroes but
Orientals and orthodox Jews as
well. It is unfortunate that the
elder generation of Phis such
ajs Mr. Brown cannot compre
hend the desire of youth for un
derstanding between all races
and nationalities. The greater
tragedy, however, is that these
men control the power in our
fraternity structure.
Dropping the racial clause
from our National Charter re
quires a two-thirds vote at two
consecutive bi-annual meetings.
At our last National Convention,
that vote was achieved. The is
sue will again be presented at
this summer's convention for
final vote. We plan to send a
delegation to the convention to
help in the overthrow of the
discriminatory clauses. There is
great pressure against the claus
es and high hopes for their eli
mination.
Because of these clauses many
persons have an erroneous con
ception of fraternity attitudes
towards minority groups. True,
many of our national charters
have discriminatory clauses, but
they were written by men now
dead and cannot be considered
accurate reflections of today's
attitudes.
While I have been associated
with the house no Negroes and
only one Oriental have come to
an open house. Unfortunately
this is no doubt the result of the
false images I mentioned.
Our suspended chapter doesn't
give a damn about many facets
of our national organization, and
the organization itself will be the
first to agree. We would unhesi
tatingly pledge a rushee regard
less of his race, religion, nation
ality or whatever if we thought
he'd make a good brother. We
have no Negroes and no Orien
tals because none have, regret
tably, expressed interest in the
house.
I hope that in the future our
image and the general frater
nity anti- minority group image
will be dispelled here at Stan
ford and at every university,
giving all college men the op
portunities to develop meaning

ful fraternal relationships that
outdated, emotional and illogical
clauses and images have so far
prevented.

We Must Meet Blacks
More Than Half Way
Editor, The Daily:
The problem of human discri
mination, in its greatest sense,
is not a Black-against-White
problem. Nevertheless, the im
mediate problem of racism is
defined in terms of Blacks and
Whites, and must be responded
to now.
Any time any one places him
self in any way above another
individual in order to prove or
establish the val'ie of his life, he
is demonstrating the basic com
ponent of human discrimination.
Any time an individual dehu
manizes another individual, he
is committing the "crime."
Perhaps, tragically, most of
us are so unsure of the value of
human life in general and of
our individual human lives in
particular that we must estab
lish this value at someone else's
expense, often by putting him
down. I suggest that we all,
White and Black, are guilty in
this respect to some degree.
Historically, in the United
States society the extreme ex
ample of this human discrimina
tion has been acted out by
Whites with respect to Blacks.
Whether or not this phenomenon
developed by design is irrele
vant; the historical fact and the
present reality cannot be denied.
The uniqueness of this mo
ment is that our guilt has nev
er been more apparent. And,
conversely, Black demands and
pleas have never seemed more
in order. We cannot now criti
cize protocol; we cannot now
criticize a black student taking
the microphone from a provost;
now, we are fearfully close to
not being able to criticize the
burning of our cities.
We must meet the Black more
than half way. Perhaps, we must
even temporarily compromise
reasonableness. Hopefully, how
ever, we will not accept Black
demands in order to punish our
selves or in order to calm Black
anger. Rather, we will accept
and respond to Black demands
in order that we might convince
all Black men that we genuinely
desire to eliminate all human
discrimination and strive togeth
er towards that goal.

JT rite Congressmen
To Control Gun Sale
Editor, The Daily:
We urgently request all citi

zens to write to their Congress
men urging the immediate intro
duction of an amendment to the
Federal Firearms Act which
would prohibit the free sale of
arms by mail order. At present
there are several amendments to
the Act shelved in the House
Ways and Means Committee
(Wilbur D. Mills, D-Ark., Chair
man, but no action has been
taken on them.)
Secondly, we urge that they
write to their state legislators
asking for the passage of a mea
sure which would severely re
strict the sale of arms within
the state.
. . . America has been nur
tured on a tradition of violence,
and until the free sale of arms
is abolished it will not be a civil
ized country. . .

Controversy Settled;
Daily Isn't A Tabloid
Editor, The Daily:
In your reply to Mr. Paul
Ryan on April 10, 1968, you ob
served that the Daily is not a
tabloid. We quite agree. To put
the matter at rest once and for
all, reference to Webster's Third
New International Dictionary
(unabridged) is indicated:
1 tabloid (adj): Characterized
by sensationalism: LURID,
VULGAR
2 tabloid (n-s): A newspaper
of small format usually
presenting the news in a
concise form; especially: A
small profusely illustrated
newspaper characterized by
sensationalism.
The Daily is not profusely
illustrated.

Ex-Supporter Of Gene
Comes Out For Bobby
Editor, The Daily:
My name appears by error on
the recent advertisement on be
half of McCarthy. I did indeed
support him, desipte his anti
charismatic qualities, when he
was the only candidate. And I
recognize the great service he
performed in catalyzing opposi
tion to the war and to LBJ. But
we ought to compare candidates
as objectively as possible to see

which one is really best quali
fied for the presidency.
On the two major issuesâ€”for
eign policy and civil rights-
Kennedy has a sueprior record
of long-term commitment ond
of tangible accomplishment.
Indeed, because of his position
on these crucial matters he has
earned the hatred of the hawks
and the racists.
It is sad to see their phony
charges of "opportunism" and
"ruthlessness" echoed irrespon
sibly in the academic com
munity. We need a man who is
opportunistic enough to know
how to transform ideals into
practical achievements, and
ruthless enoug to carry through
the tough job of eliminating
war and racism from our sick
society.
