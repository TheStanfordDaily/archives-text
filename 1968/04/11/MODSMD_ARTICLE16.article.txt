## We Should Do It Without Being Asked 
### Professor Brooks Otis 
The recent episode of the "ul
timatum" of the Black Students
Union and the official university
response to it suggests to me
some obvious but perhaps use
ful ideas.
The university was, I think,
wise in treating the substance,
not the manner of the "ultima
tum." It is nevertheless unfor
tunate (I deliberately indulge in
a massive understatement) that
the university should have need
ed such incitement to action just
as it is also unfortunate that

other (as yet mainly hypothe
tical) action should have need
ed the death of Martin Luther
King and perhaps also the vio
lence that followed it.
What stands out in both the
local and the national situations
is the huge gap between words
and deeds. The Civil War has
just had its hundreth anniver
sary, greeted by a flood of books
and monographs on its battles,
issues and personalities. How
many of these, however, serious
ly called attention to what V. I.
Lenin once termed the "world

historic, progressive and revo
lutionary significance" of that
war? (Letter to American Work
ers, 1918).
Unfortunately, it has taken
more than a hundred years to
demonstrate that one cannot
wage a revolution and forget it.
Some progress has been made
in the sphere of civil rights —
i.e., in the practical implemen
tation of legislation produced
by the Civil War and now near
ly a century old. But as Luther
King has reiterated, a man can
not live on civil rights alone,

though a consciousness of civil
rights can, as we have seen,
produce a determination to fight
for other rights. The greatest
gain of the civil rights fight lies
in the expectations it has
aroused, the apathy and sub
missiveness that it has helped
to dissipate. Yet inevitably the
immediate effect of this devel
opment is to deepen once more
the enormous gap between
words and deeds.
It is easy to assuage guilt feel
ings with words and small con
tributions, token actions, maso
chistic tolerance and conces
sive gestures. But what we face
is the accumulated hundred
years deficit of a revolutionary
war that we once waged. As to
what kind of action is needed,
there is no great problem.
From the 1919 Chicago riot
report to the recent "best seller"
on the riots of 1967, the recom
mendations have been remark

ably similar. The scale has
grown: the substance remains
the same. Among other things,
many billions of dollars must
be appropriated and spent. To
say that we cannot "afford this"
(out of an approximate 700 bil
lions national income) is simp
ly to indicate the extent of our
indifference.
The thing that impresses me
about the Black Students' "ulti
matum" is not the discourtesy
of its presentation but the timi
dity of its substance. We need
to do a great deal more than
they ask. We should have done
it without being asked. I should
also like to add that we certain
ly should not do it for black
students alone. They are men
like other men and they share
with many others (not least the
guilt-burdened whites) the pe
culiar conditions that beset a
WASP university. I should like
to see these conditions altered.

tributions, token actions, maso
chistic tolerance and conces
sive gestures. But what we face
is the accumulated hundred
years deficit of a revolutionary
war that we once waged. As to
what kind of action is needed,
there is no great problem.
From the 1919 Chicago riot
report to the recent "best seller"
on the riots of 1967, the recom
mendations have been remark

ably similar. The scale has
grown: the substance remains
the same. Among other things,
many billions of dollars must
be appropriated and spent. To
say that we cannot "afford this"
(out of an approximate 700 bil
lions national income) is simp
ly to indicate the extent of our
indifference.
The thing that impresses me
about the Black Students' "ulti
matum" is not the discourtesy
of its presentation but the timi
dity of its substance. We need
to do a great deal more than
they ask. We should have done
it without being asked. I should
also like to add that we certain
ly should not do it for black
students alone. They are men
like other men and they share
with many others (not least the
guilt-burdened whites) the pe
culiar conditions that beset a
WASP university. I should like
to see these conditions altered.
The recent episode of the "ul
timatum" of the Black Students
Union and the official university
response to it suggests to me
some obvious but perhaps use
ful ideas.
The university was, I think,
wise in treating the substance,
not the manner of the "ultima
tum." It is nevertheless unfor
tunate (I deliberately indulge in
a massive understatement) that
the university should have need
ed such incitement to action just
as it is also unfortunate that

other (as yet mainly hypothe
tical) action should have need
ed the death of Martin Luther
King and perhaps also the vio
lence that followed it.
What stands out in both the
local and the national situations
is the huge gap between words
and deeds. The Civil War has
just had its hundreth anniver
sary, greeted by a flood of books
and monographs on its battles,
issues and personalities. How
many of these, however, serious
ly called attention to what V. I.
Lenin once termed the "world

historic, progressive and revo
lutionary significance" of that
war? (Letter to American Work
ers, 1918).
Unfortunately, it has taken
more than a hundred years to
demonstrate that one cannot
wage a revolution and forget it.
Some progress has been made
in the sphere of civil rights —
i.e., in the practical implemen
tation of legislation produced
by the Civil War and now near
ly a century old. But as Luther
King has reiterated, a man can
not live on civil rights alone,

though a consciousness of civil
rights can, as we have seen,
produce a determination to fight
for other rights. The greatest
gain of the civil rights fight lies
in the expectations it has
aroused, the apathy and sub
missiveness that it has helped
to dissipate. Yet inevitably the
immediate effect of this devel
opment is to deepen once more
the enormous gap between
words and deeds.
It is easy to assuage guilt feel
ings with words and small con
tributions, token actions, maso
chistic tolerance and conces
sive gestures. But what we face
is the accumulated hundred
years deficit of a revolutionary
war that we once waged. As to
what kind of action is needed,
