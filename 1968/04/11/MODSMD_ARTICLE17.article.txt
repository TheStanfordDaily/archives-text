# Stanford Student Describes 'Desolution’ In Washington
## 
### 
(Stanford journalism student
Mark Steinberg 1 was in Washing
ton, D.C. earlier this week work
ing with radio station WRC dur
ing the riots. 4 'This was my first
exposure to any deviation
from what I had believed to be
the norm of American life," he
writes. What follows is his
"Faulknerian diary" Sunday,
April 6.)
1:30 a.m.—The film crew
leaves the WRC Studios. The
streets are empty but this is to
be expected at the hour. My first
confrontation with the "unus
ual" comes only a few blocks
later. An Army jeep crosses in
front of our car with machine
gun in tow. It's strange; almost
as if the driver and his vehicle
have a purpose other than war
fare or violence; a two-dimen
sional experience.
We move through the first of
countless blockades. The crew
has been through this before
and views the blockade as an
annoyance. The troops who man
the blockade have a fire burning
on a nearby corner. I hadn't no
ticed the cold before.
I:3s—We are stopped by an
other blockade. Although we are
permitted to pass, it seems as
though the policeman doesn't
trust us. Suddenly we come
upon a black Cadillac limousine
wound grotesquely around a
light pole. The pole leans at an
absurd angle. Troops milling in
the area pay no attention to the
car. It has been stripped of all
upholstery.
We pass a lire station.
Through our wildly-taped win
dows we can see that the win
dows of the station and its ve
hicles have also been taped to
prevent shattering.
1:45 a.m.—Thus far we have
passed no other civilian vehicles.
It seems almost ridiculous to
stop for rod lights but habit pre
vails over reason.
2:05 a.m. — Suddenly we're
"there". We turn down Four
teenth Street and are greeted by
a malebolge of flashing lights,
smoke and troops. We pass
countless broken windows and
others which have been spared
because the epigram "Soul
Brother" has been scrawled in
Halloween style upon them. Two
buildings, SCLC Headquarters
and the Afro-American School
stand serenely unmolested. The
radio tells us that fires have
broken out in Baltimore.
Lights are burning in most of
the windows of apartments in
the area but we can see no one.
We have traversed eight deci
mated blocks.
2:ls—We hear that two bodies

have been found inside a gutted
department store in the next
block. A soldier assures us that
the scene is a grisly-understand
able redundancy.
Pausing before a fully-lighted
food store we peer through its
nonexistent window. Shelves
have been overturned but food
is strewn about the floor—per
haps undesirable delicacies.
Our car passes two Negro
women walking on Georgia Ave
nue. They turn and stare at us
with obvious apprehension.
We see only police vehicles
and soldiers; soldiers every
where.
2:20--Another roadblock. A
policeman has a rifle cradled cas
ually in his arms as he leans in
the window to talk with us. The
air is still filled with acrid
smoke. The three WRC crew
members are blase (perhaps
just casual) about our surround
ings.
2:30 —We return to WRC and
trail a female employee return
ing to her Virginia home. When
we reach Key Bridge she thanks
us with a flash of her tail lights.
Now down Pennsylvania Ave
nue. All is desolate, but normal
until we near the White House.
There we see a thick cable
strung above the sidewalk and
blinding spotlights directed to
wards us. Only a few troops are
in evidence, maintaining dis
creet, almost theatrical stances.
2:4o—Downtown Washington
—incredible. Trios of troops
mark every intersection. A
Greyhound Bus lopes into the
Bus Station which is totally de
serted.
Broken windows begin at
Sixth Street and stretch endless
ly beyond. At Thomas Circle
U.S. Army vehicles ring the
curb forming a military merry
go-round.
We turn up 7th Street; I'm
thoughtless and speechless—per
haps this is "pure" horror. We
drive under the spray of three
fire hoses; the firemen's effort
seems to be concentrated on
stopping the smoke, as the
buildings are beyond salvation.
Leaving the car, I find myself
slouching, consciously trying to
make myself a smaller potential
target. I've no grounds for fear
—it's just there. I talk with a
fireman who, noting the camera
crew, delivers a brief oration on
the shortcomings of the press.
I can see the Washington Monu
ment—implacable.
3:OO—A burglar alarm rings,
indignantly protesting another
petty entry. Stores along Sev
enth have been looted meticu
lously. A half bottle of Coke

stands proudly alone in the win
dow of a liquor store. The Hecht
Company is fully lighted, its
windows boarded. Inside, as we
pass, I can see fire hoses
stretching through corridors.
3:15 —We leave for the H
Street area. More roadblocks—
soldiers — broken windows.
Emerging from a railroad under
pass, it begins in earnest. The
six or seven blocks before us
come as close as anything I've
seen to a visual embodiment of
hate.
Two or three fire trucks spray
the ruins of unidentifiable build
ings. The few untouched build
ings are clearly "Soul" struc
tures. Incongruously, a fashion
able chain store stands with
fluorescent lights blazing, pro
claiming "Safeway" to the ob
viously unsafe disaster workers.
Some fire hoses have been aban
doned in the street, perhaps in
anticipation of future use.
3:2o—We pass a corner and
suddenly stop. One of the crew
has seen three troops searching
a young Negro. I turn and
through the taped, frosted back
window see a jeep jerk to a
halt. Three National Guardsmen
join the frisking. I can vaguely
make out the boy's face. He is
terrified but is not mis-handled.
We pull away as more troops
join the band on the corner.
6:l5—A tall black with Afro-
American haircut begins to walk
down the block towards the
building. A police officer ap
proaches him.
Immediately, the door of the
SNCC building opens and a
group appears. Simultaneously,
the troop carriers, paddy wag
ons, etc. converge on the spot.
The man, claiming he is on his
way to work in the building, is
permitted to join the others.
Everyone returns to his station.
6:2o—Civilian cars are now in
the streets. People of the neigh
borhood begin leaving their
homes and the siege of 14th
Street now takes on comic as
pects—the SNCC people are the
only ones forced to stay indoors.
6:3o—The building begins to
empty. I count 15 or twenty peo
ple—two girls. Instead of head
ing directly for their cars, they
mill about on the sidewalk, jeer
ing at passing Army vehicles.
As a troop transport passes, one
of the men yells, "Save it for
Red China, baby."
I concentrate on the faces of
the black National Guardsmen
and Army men. They are hollow,
tired, depressed and embar
rassed faces. They obviously try
to avoid glancing at their broth
ers on the street.
