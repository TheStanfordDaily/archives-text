# Letters To The Editor
## McCarthy Record Defended 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
This letter will answer the
local Kennedy people (Daily,
April 9) in three main parts:
McCarthy's stands on the is
sues, his voting record on civil
rights, and his leadership rec
ord.
The theoretical basis lor Sen
ator McaCrthy's stand on civil
rights in the full meaning of the
term is found in his book Fron
tiers in American Democracy:
"It is generally accepted that
there are two conditions under
which obedience to government
may be withheld. First, in the
event that the state has ex
tended its authority into fields of
life which do not properly be
long to it . . . ;and second, when
the government . . . orders ac
tions which are wrong ... an
extreme example of which would
be either an unjust war or an
unnecessary one."
Consistent with the theory,
McCarthy is for legislation to
provide for Selective Conscien
tious Objection; he wants to
permit those young Americans
in Sweden and Canada to re
turn to the U.S. and be treated
as Conscientious Objectors. He
states that the attempts to use
the draft as an instrument of
punishment are inexcusable and
that General Hershey ought to
be retired.
McCarthy was willing to stand
up for civil rights by debating
Joe McCarthy on the radio in
1952 when the moderator "could
n't get anybody else." Robert
Kennedy played a very different
role in the Joe McCarthy era.
With respect to those civil
rights which directly affect the
poor and deprived of our coun
try, McCarthy states: "But I
don't think we can stop short
simply with defining and pro
tecting the old civil rights . . . "
The four new civil rights he
lists are the rights to education,
full access to what provides for
health and general well being,
a decent job, and a "house fit for
a family to live in." Consistent
with the theory above and the
new civil rights, McCarthy wants
to replace the outmoded and de
grading welfare system with
the provision of a guaranteed

annual income for every Amer
ican.
The Senator is also in favor
of the 18-year-old vote.
We come now to the legisla
tive record on civil rights In
the narrow sense of the term. In
1949, his first year in Congress,
he supported legislation to abol
ish the poll tax in federal elec
tions. Since then he has not only
voted for every major civil rights
bill but he has been a sponsor.
This inlcudes the Voting Rights
Act of 1965 —the only specific
vote mentioned in the Kennedy
letter.
The Kennedy Amendment to
the Voting Rights Act of 1965
was one of two competing
amendments designed to prevent
four states from using the poll
tax as a discriminatory device
in state elections.
The Kennedy Amendment
provided for the abolition of the
poll tax, whereas the Mansfield-
Dirksen amendment provided
that in view of the evidence pre
sented to Congress that the poll
tax is used as a discriminatory
device, "the Attorney General
shall forthwith institute . . .ac
tions for declaratory judgment
or injunctive relief against the
enforcement of any poll tax
. . . which . . . has the purpose
or effect of denying or abridging
the right to vote."
The Kennedy Amendment was
opposed by Attorney General
Katzenbach because its consti
tutionality was questionable and
because the same purpose would
be accomplished by the Mans
field-Dirksen version. This is why
Senator McCarthy voted against
the Kennedy Amendment. The
Kennedy people should do their
homework. (See Constitional
Law by Dowling and Gunther,
pp. 486-489) . . .
Senator McCarthy has taken

the lead in urging the forma
tion of a Senate Committee to
Probe CIA influence on domes
tic affairs. He urges the over
haul of the CIA, the FBI, and
Selective Service. It might be
useful to compare Senator Ken
nedy's attitude toward the FBI
as indicated by his position on
wiretapping when he was At
torney General. This is also a
civil rights issue.

For Days Of Concern
Editor, The Daily:
On behalf of the Days of Con
cern Steering Committee, I
should like to express our ap
preciation to the Young Ameri
cans for Freedom for relinquish
ing its prior reservation of
White Memorial Plaza for Fri
day, April 12, at noon. This ges
ture of cooperation makes it
possible to begin the Days of
Concern program with a rally at
that time and place.
The good will of Young Am
ericans for Freedom is typical
of the University-wide interest
and assistance which this pro
gram has received. By bringing
to Stanford persons whose per
spectives and ranges of experi
ence are not easily duplicated
on campus, we hope to offer a
significant program on issues
whose vital and immediate im
portance cannot be overstressed.

Black 6 Reverse Racism 9
Editor, The Daily:
Edward McClure, your con
cern about the reverse racism
(Letter to Editor, April 10) in
the idea of a black separatist

group is a very legitimate white
liberal concern. I am a white lib
eral who has resolved this for
myself. . .
I submit that to understand
black reactions you have to em
phatically put yourself in a
black person's position, to im
agine yourself black in today's
America, to think black. Com
fortable white middle class
would never be so rude—but we
must recognize this as our lux
ury. For us it is wrong to criti
cize the morality and manners
of starvation.
From the hungry, frustrated
ghetto perspective, black sep
aratism may be upsetting but
necessary, today if not for
ever. . .
I would submit the black
pride that separatist groups em
body is not at all the superiority
feeling white separatist groups
have felt for four hundred years.
Our fears of reverse racism
seem to me to be example of
our liberal paternalism, pro
ducts of protected childhoods in
de facto segregated homes. . .
To your concern that since
you cannot join their groups
you cannot join their movement
I answer that there is too much
for whites to do: the self-ques
tioning implied above, the edu
cation of other white people
about racism, the organization
of white understanding support,
not rubber stamping, of such
black groups as the BSU to help
effect necessary reforms of our
society, starting at home.

Black 6 Reverse Racism 9
Editor, The Daily:
Edward McClure, your con
cern about the reverse racism
(Letter to Editor, April 10) in
the idea of a black separatist

group is a very legitimate white
liberal concern. I am a white lib
eral who has resolved this for
myself. . .
I submit that to understand
black reactions you have to em
phatically put yourself in a
black person's position, to im
agine yourself black in today's
America, to think black. Com
fortable white middle class
would never be so rude—but we
must recognize this as our lux
ury. For us it is wrong to criti
cize the morality and manners
of starvation.
From the hungry, frustrated
ghetto perspective, black sep
aratism may be upsetting but
necessary, today if not for
ever. . .
I would submit the black
pride that separatist groups em
body is not at all the superiority
feeling white separatist groups
have felt for four hundred years.
Our fears of reverse racism
seem to me to be example of
our liberal paternalism, pro
ducts of protected childhoods in
de facto segregated homes. . .
To your concern that since
you cannot join their groups
you cannot join their movement
I answer that there is too much
for whites to do: the self-ques
tioning implied above, the edu
cation of other white people
about racism, the organization
of white understanding support,
not rubber stamping, of such
black groups as the BSU to help
effect necessary reforms of our
society, starting at home.
BILL COOPER
Editor, The Daily:
This letter will answer the
local Kennedy people (Daily,
April 9) in three main parts:
McCarthy's stands on the is
sues, his voting record on civil
rights, and his leadership rec
ord.
The theoretical basis lor Sen
ator McaCrthy's stand on civil
rights in the full meaning of the
term is found in his book Fron
tiers in American Democracy:
"It is generally accepted that
there are two conditions under
which obedience to government
may be withheld. First, in the
event that the state has ex
tended its authority into fields of
life which do not properly be
long to it . . . ;and second, when
the government . . . orders ac
tions which are wrong ... an
extreme example of which would
be either an unjust war or an
unnecessary one."
Consistent with the theory,
McCarthy is for legislation to
provide for Selective Conscien
tious Objection; he wants to
permit those young Americans
in Sweden and Canada to re
turn to the U.S. and be treated
as Conscientious Objectors. He
states that the attempts to use
the draft as an instrument of
punishment are inexcusable and
that General Hershey ought to
be retired.
McCarthy was willing to stand
up for civil rights by debating
Joe McCarthy on the radio in
1952 when the moderator "could
n't get anybody else." Robert
Kennedy played a very different
role in the Joe McCarthy era.
With respect to those civil
rights which directly affect the
poor and deprived of our coun
try, McCarthy states: "But I
don't think we can stop short
simply with defining and pro
tecting the old civil rights . . . "
The four new civil rights he
lists are the rights to education,
full access to what provides for
health and general well being,
a decent job, and a "house fit for
a family to live in." Consistent
with the theory above and the
new civil rights, McCarthy wants
to replace the outmoded and de
grading welfare system with
the provision of a guaranteed

annual income for every Amer
ican.
The Senator is also in favor
of the 18-year-old vote.
We come now to the legisla
tive record on civil rights In
the narrow sense of the term. In
1949, his first year in Congress,
he supported legislation to abol
ish the poll tax in federal elec
tions. Since then he has not only
voted for every major civil rights
bill but he has been a sponsor.
This inlcudes the Voting Rights
Act of 1965 —the only specific
vote mentioned in the Kennedy
letter.
The Kennedy Amendment to
the Voting Rights Act of 1965
was one of two competing
amendments designed to prevent
four states from using the poll
tax as a discriminatory device
in state elections.
The Kennedy Amendment
provided for the abolition of the
poll tax, whereas the Mansfield-
Dirksen amendment provided
that in view of the evidence pre
sented to Congress that the poll
tax is used as a discriminatory
device, "the Attorney General
shall forthwith institute . . .ac
tions for declaratory judgment
or injunctive relief against the
enforcement of any poll tax
. . . which . . . has the purpose
or effect of denying or abridging
the right to vote."
The Kennedy Amendment was
opposed by Attorney General
Katzenbach because its consti
tutionality was questionable and
because the same purpose would
be accomplished by the Mans
field-Dirksen version. This is why
Senator McCarthy voted against
the Kennedy Amendment. The
Kennedy people should do their
homework. (See Constitional
Law by Dowling and Gunther,
pp. 486-489) . . .
Senator McCarthy has taken

the lead in urging the forma
tion of a Senate Committee to
Probe CIA influence on domes
tic affairs. He urges the over
haul of the CIA, the FBI, and
Selective Service. It might be
useful to compare Senator Ken
nedy's attitude toward the FBI
as indicated by his position on
wiretapping when he was At
torney General. This is also a
civil rights issue.

On behalf of the Days of Con

should like to express our ap
preciation to the Young Ameri

ing its prior reservation of
White Memorial Plaza for Fri
day, April 12, at noon. This ges

possible to begin the Days of

that time and place.
The good will of Young Am

of the University-wide interest
and assistance which this pro

to Stanford persons whose per
spectives and ranges of experi
ence are not easily duplicated
on campus, we hope to offer a
significant program on issues
whose vital and immediate im

Senator McCarthy voted against
the Kennedy Amendment. The

Senator McCarthy has taken

the lead in urging the forma

YAF Gives Up Plaza
For Days Of Concern
Editor, The Daily:
On behalf of the Days of Con
cern Steering Committee, I
should like to express our ap
preciation to the Young Ameri
cans for Freedom for relinquish
ing its prior reservation of
White Memorial Plaza for Fri
day, April 12, at noon. This ges
ture of cooperation makes it
possible to begin the Days of
Concern program with a rally at
that time and place.
The good will of Young Am
ericans for Freedom is typical
of the University-wide interest
and assistance which this pro
gram has received. By bringing
to Stanford persons whose per
spectives and ranges of experi
ence are not easily duplicated
on campus, we hope to offer a
significant program on issues
whose vital and immediate im
portance cannot be overstressed.

Black 6 Reverse Racism 9
Editor, The Daily:
Edward McClure, your con
cern about the reverse racism
(Letter to Editor, April 10) in
the idea of a black separatist

group is a very legitimate white
liberal concern. I am a white lib
eral who has resolved this for
myself. . .
I submit that to understand
black reactions you have to em
phatically put yourself in a
black person's position, to im
agine yourself black in today's
America, to think black. Com
fortable white middle class
would never be so rude—but we
must recognize this as our lux
ury. For us it is wrong to criti
cize the morality and manners
of starvation.
From the hungry, frustrated
ghetto perspective, black sep
aratism may be upsetting but
necessary, today if not for
ever. . .
I would submit the black
pride that separatist groups em
body is not at all the superiority
feeling white separatist groups
have felt for four hundred years.
Our fears of reverse racism
seem to me to be example of
our liberal paternalism, pro
ducts of protected childhoods in
de facto segregated homes. . .
To your concern that since
you cannot join their groups
you cannot join their movement
I answer that there is too much
for whites to do: the self-ques
tioning implied above, the edu
cation of other white people
about racism, the organization
of white understanding support,
not rubber stamping, of such
black groups as the BSU to help
effect necessary reforms of our
society, starting at home.
BILL COOPER
Editor, The Daily:
This letter will answer the
local Kennedy people (Daily,
April 9) in three main parts:
McCarthy's stands on the is
sues, his voting record on civil
rights, and his leadership rec
ord.
The theoretical basis lor Sen
ator McaCrthy's stand on civil
rights in the full meaning of the
term is found in his book Fron
tiers in American Democracy:
"It is generally accepted that
there are two conditions under
which obedience to government
may be withheld. First, in the
event that the state has ex
tended its authority into fields of
life which do not properly be
long to it . . . ;and second, when
the government . . . orders ac
tions which are wrong ... an
extreme example of which would
be either an unjust war or an
unnecessary one."
Consistent with the theory,
McCarthy is for legislation to
provide for Selective Conscien
tious Objection; he wants to
permit those young Americans
in Sweden and Canada to re
turn to the U.S. and be treated
as Conscientious Objectors. He
states that the attempts to use
the draft as an instrument of
punishment are inexcusable and
that General Hershey ought to
be retired.
McCarthy was willing to stand
up for civil rights by debating
Joe McCarthy on the radio in
1952 when the moderator "could
n't get anybody else." Robert
Kennedy played a very different
role in the Joe McCarthy era.
With respect to those civil
rights which directly affect the
poor and deprived of our coun
try, McCarthy states: "But I
don't think we can stop short
simply with defining and pro
tecting the old civil rights . . . "
The four new civil rights he
lists are the rights to education,
full access to what provides for
health and general well being,
a decent job, and a "house fit for
a family to live in." Consistent
with the theory above and the
new civil rights, McCarthy wants
to replace the outmoded and de
grading welfare system with
the provision of a guaranteed

annual income for every Amer
ican.
The Senator is also in favor
of the 18-year-old vote.
We come now to the legisla
tive record on civil rights In
the narrow sense of the term. In
1949, his first year in Congress,
he supported legislation to abol
ish the poll tax in federal elec
tions. Since then he has not only
voted for every major civil rights
bill but he has been a sponsor.
This inlcudes the Voting Rights
Act of 1965 —the only specific
vote mentioned in the Kennedy
letter.
The Kennedy Amendment to
the Voting Rights Act of 1965
was one of two competing
amendments designed to prevent
four states from using the poll
tax as a discriminatory device
in state elections.
The Kennedy Amendment
provided for the abolition of the
poll tax, whereas the Mansfield-
Dirksen amendment provided
that in view of the evidence pre
sented to Congress that the poll
tax is used as a discriminatory
device, "the Attorney General
shall forthwith institute . . .ac
tions for declaratory judgment
or injunctive relief against the
enforcement of any poll tax
. . . which . . . has the purpose
or effect of denying or abridging
the right to vote."
The Kennedy Amendment was
opposed by Attorney General
Katzenbach because its consti
tutionality was questionable and
because the same purpose would
be accomplished by the Mans
field-Dirksen version. This is why
Senator McCarthy voted against
the Kennedy Amendment. The

health and general well being,
a decent job, and a "house fit for
a family to live in." Consistent
with the theory above and the
new civil rights, McCarthy wants
to replace the outmoded and de
grading welfare system with
the provision of a guaranteed

annual income for every Amer
ican.
The Senator is also in favor
of the 18-year-old vote.
We come now to the legisla
tive record on civil rights In
the narrow sense of the term. In
1949, his first year in Congress,
he supported legislation to abol
ish the poll tax in federal elec
tions. Since then he has not only
voted for every major civil rights
bill but he has been a sponsor.
This inlcudes the Voting Rights
Act of 1965 —the only specific
vote mentioned in the Kennedy
letter.
The Kennedy Amendment to
the Voting Rights Act of 1965
was one of two competing
amendments designed to prevent
four states from using the poll
tax as a discriminatory device
in state elections.
The Kennedy Amendment
provided for the abolition of the
poll tax, whereas the Mansfield-
Dirksen amendment provided
that in view of the evidence pre
sented to Congress that the poll
tax is used as a discriminatory
device, "the Attorney General
shall forthwith institute . . .ac
tions for declaratory judgment
or injunctive relief against the
enforcement of any poll tax
. . . which . . . has the purpose
or effect of denying or abridging
the right to vote."
The Kennedy Amendment was
opposed by Attorney General
Katzenbach because its consti
tutionality was questionable and
because the same purpose would
be accomplished by the Mans
field-Dirksen version. This is why
Senator McCarthy voted against
the Kennedy Amendment. The
Kennedy people should do their
homework. (See Constitional
Law by Dowling and Gunther,
pp. 486-489) . . .
Senator McCarthy has taken

the lead in urging the forma
tion of a Senate Committee to
Probe CIA influence on domes
tic affairs. He urges the over
haul of the CIA, the FBI, and
Selective Service. It might be
useful to compare Senator Ken
nedy's attitude toward the FBI
as indicated by his position on
wiretapping when he was At
torney General. This is also a
civil rights issue.

YAF Gives Up Plaza
For Days Of Concern
Editor, The Daily:
On behalf of the Days of Con
cern Steering Committee, I
should like to express our ap
preciation to the Young Ameri
cans for Freedom for relinquish
ing its prior reservation of
White Memorial Plaza for Fri
day, April 12, at noon. This ges
ture of cooperation makes it
possible to begin the Days of
Concern program with a rally at
that time and place.
The good will of Young Am
ericans for Freedom is typical
of the University-wide interest
and assistance which this pro
gram has received. By bringing
to Stanford persons whose per
spectives and ranges of experi
ence are not easily duplicated
on campus, we hope to offer a
significant program on issues
whose vital and immediate im
portance cannot be overstressed.

McClure, Don't Fear
Black 6 Reverse Racism 9
Editor, The Daily:
Edward McClure, your con
cern about the reverse racism
(Letter to Editor, April 10) in
the idea of a black separatist

group is a very legitimate white
liberal concern. I am a white lib
eral who has resolved this for
myself. . .
I submit that to understand
black reactions you have to em
phatically put yourself in a
black person's position, to im
agine yourself black in today's
America, to think black. Com
fortable white middle class
would never be so rude—but we
must recognize this as our lux
ury. For us it is wrong to criti
cize the morality and manners
of starvation.
From the hungry, frustrated
ghetto perspective, black sep
aratism may be upsetting but
necessary, today if not for
ever. . .
I would submit the black
pride that separatist groups em
body is not at all the superiority
feeling white separatist groups
have felt for four hundred years.
Our fears of reverse racism
seem to me to be example of
our liberal paternalism, pro
ducts of protected childhoods in
de facto segregated homes. . .
To your concern that since
you cannot join their groups
you cannot join their movement
I answer that there is too much
for whites to do: the self-ques
tioning implied above, the edu
cation of other white people
about racism, the organization
of white understanding support,
not rubber stamping, of such
black groups as the BSU to help
effect necessary reforms of our
society, starting at home.
