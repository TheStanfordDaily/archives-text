# CBS' Schoenburn To Probe Univ. Role
## 
### 
Former CBS correspondent
David Schoenbrun will deliver
the second major address in the
Days of Concern series Saturday
at 10 a.m. in Memorial Audito
rium. His topic will be "The Uni
versity and Its Role in a Chang
ing America."
A panel discussion will follow
Schoenbrun's talk. Panel partici
pants are: William Clebsch,
Stanford professor of religion
and humanities; Troy Duster,
assistant sociology professor at
Berkeley; Robert Scheer, editor
of Ramparts; and Judge Paul R.
Tiehl, Municipal Court, San
Jose and Commanding General
of the Northern Emergency
Headquarters of the California
National Guard.
Schoenbrun has been an eye
witness to many of the most
dramatic and important develop
ments in modern history. The
award- winning correspondent
has documented such events as
the American landings in North
Africa and the liberation of
France; the capture of Berlin;
the wars in Indochina and Ko
rea; the post-war creation of
the Marshall Plan, the Atlantic
Alliance, and the Common Mar
ket; the return to power of
Charles de Gaulle; the Kennedy
administration and assassina
tion; the pilgrimage of Pope
Paul; and the 1964 election.
He gained wide fame last year
when he obtained a visa to
North Vietnam. His subsequent
reporting appeared in 150 news
papers around the world, and his
article "Journey to North Viet
nam" was the cover story of the
December 16th issue of Saturday
Evening' Post.
In that article Schoenbrun
tells how he and his wife rushed
to crowded shelters as American
bombers raided the towns they
visited. Although Schoenbrun
met with several top officials he
was not able to renew his
friendship with Ho Chi Minh
who was a dinner guest of the
Schoenbruns in 1946 in France.
He and his wife did receive per
sonally inscribed gifts (sup
posedly made of pieces of
downed U.S. planes) from the
aging leader who apologized for
being unable to welcome them
to his home.
". . . when questioning North
Vietnamese officials," Schoen
brun wrote, "I found their sus
picion and mistrust of Washing
ton close to psychosis."
He concluded from his visit
"that an honorable settlement
can be achieved if half as much
energy and dedication is devoted
to the search for peace as to the
prosecution of the war, and if
the issue is narrowed to the fu
ture of Vietnam." Schoenbrun
elaborates his views on the war

in his latest book, Vietnam:
How We Got In, How We Can
Get Out, scheduled for release
later this month by Atheneum
Publishers.
Schoenbrun is also well known
for his analyses of modern
France. His book As France
Goes (1957) was named Best
Book on Foreign Affairs by the
Overseas Press Club. He has
known Charles de Gaulle and
followed his career closely for
25 years, and his The Three
Lives of Charles de Gaulle
(1966) is a best seller.
In addition, Schoenbrun is an
authority on the United Europe
Movement and on the continuing
American effort to solidify a
partnership of the Atlantic na
tions, a plan thwarted by de-
Gaulle.
He began his reporting career
as a freelance writer in 1940.
He was Chief Allied Forces
newsroom commentator for the
U.N. radio in Algiers in 1943,
and U.S. intelligence liason of
ficer to the French Army, 1944-
45.

U.N. radio in Algiers in 1943,
and U.S. intelligence liason of
ficer to the French Army, 1944-
45.
Former CBS correspondent
David Schoenbrun will deliver
the second major address in the
Days of Concern series Saturday
at 10 a.m. in Memorial Audito
rium. His topic will be "The Uni
versity and Its Role in a Chang
ing America."
A panel discussion will follow
Schoenbrun's talk. Panel partici
pants are: William Clebsch,
Stanford professor of religion
and humanities; Troy Duster,
assistant sociology professor at
Berkeley; Robert Scheer, editor
of Ramparts; and Judge Paul R.
Tiehl, Municipal Court, San
Jose and Commanding General
of the Northern Emergency
Headquarters of the California
National Guard.
Schoenbrun has been an eye
witness to many of the most
dramatic and important develop
ments in modern history. The
award- winning correspondent
has documented such events as
the American landings in North
Africa and the liberation of
France; the capture of Berlin;
the wars in Indochina and Ko
rea; the post-war creation of
the Marshall Plan, the Atlantic
Alliance, and the Common Mar
ket; the return to power of
Charles de Gaulle; the Kennedy
administration and assassina
tion; the pilgrimage of Pope
Paul; and the 1964 election.
He gained wide fame last year
when he obtained a visa to
North Vietnam. His subsequent
reporting appeared in 150 news
papers around the world, and his
article "Journey to North Viet
nam" was the cover story of the
December 16th issue of Saturday
Evening' Post.
In that article Schoenbrun
tells how he and his wife rushed
to crowded shelters as American
bombers raided the towns they
visited. Although Schoenbrun
met with several top officials he
was not able to renew his
friendship with Ho Chi Minh
who was a dinner guest of the
Schoenbruns in 1946 in France.
He and his wife did receive per
sonally inscribed gifts (sup
posedly made of pieces of
downed U.S. planes) from the
aging leader who apologized for
being unable to welcome them
to his home.
". . . when questioning North
Vietnamese officials," Schoen
brun wrote, "I found their sus
picion and mistrust of Washing
ton close to psychosis."
He concluded from his visit
"that an honorable settlement
can be achieved if half as much
energy and dedication is devoted
to the search for peace as to the
prosecution of the war, and if
the issue is narrowed to the fu
ture of Vietnam." Schoenbrun
elaborates his views on the war

in his latest book, Vietnam:
How We Got In, How We Can
Get Out, scheduled for release
later this month by Atheneum
Publishers.
Schoenbrun is also well known
for his analyses of modern
France. His book As France
Goes (1957) was named Best
Book on Foreign Affairs by the
Overseas Press Club. He has
known Charles de Gaulle and
followed his career closely for
25 years, and his The Three
Lives of Charles de Gaulle
(1966) is a best seller.
In addition, Schoenbrun is an
authority on the United Europe
Movement and on the continuing
American effort to solidify a
partnership of the Atlantic na
tions, a plan thwarted by de-
Gaulle.
He began his reporting career
as a freelance writer in 1940.
He was Chief Allied Forces
newsroom commentator for the
U.N. radio in Algiers in 1943,
and U.S. intelligence liason of
ficer to the French Army, 1944-
45.
