# Tougher Penalties
## New Drug Bill Considered 
### 
(CPS)—Under an Administra
tion proposal now being con
sidered by Congress, a student
who loans his roommate a pep
pill to stay awake during finals
will be a federal criminal sub
ject to 10 years in prison and a
$15,000 fine.
The bill, which embodies pro
posals made by President John
son in his State of the Union
and crime messages would make
possession of "hallucinogenic
drugs (including LSD) and oth
er depressant and stimulant
drugs" a misdemeanor and "il
legal manufacture and traffic"
and "possession for sale" of such
drugs a felony.
The House Subcommittee on
Public Health and Welfare com
pleted hearings on the bill in
early March. Although the sub
committee had not yet sched
uled action on the bill, it is
almost certain to be passed, pos
sibly in an even stronger form.
All but one of the subcommittee
members have said they favor
the bill.
It may face slightly rougher
going in the Senate. At a series
of hearings this week, members
of the Senate Juvenile Delin
quency Subcommittee appeared
sympathetic to arguments that
laws for possession of drugs,
especially marijuana, are unen
forceable and that the penalties
ought to be lessened or com
pletely eliminated.
Two educators who appeared
before the subcommittee argued
that the present laws against
marijuana are unenforceable.
Dean Helen Nowlis, director of
the drug education project of
the National Association of Stu
dent Personnel Administrators,
told the committee that criminal

penalties for possession of mari
juana should be removed. She
said, however, that she was
against legalization of mari
juana until more research could
be done on it.
She agreed with Kennedy that
the legal inequities make it dif
ficult to convince people not to
use marijuana. "I wish," she
told the subcommittee, "every
one of you had to face thought
ful young people who may or
may not use marijuana, and who
ask you to justify such penalties
and at the same time explain
why a bill regulating merely the
mail-order sale of guns, which
kill and maim more people both
accidentally and intentionally,
than all drugs put together, can
not get to first base; or why
alcohol, which ruins the lives
of countless millions and has
been demonstrated to be associ
ated with many crimes of vio
lence, is widely advertised and
promoted and freely available to
all adults."
She also expressed the fears
of many deans and adminis
trators about the tactics used
by law enforcement officials
in cases such as the police
raid on the State University
of New York at Stony Brook:
"The great majority of stu
dents, teachers, and adminis
trators find many widely used
enforcement techniques both
repulsive and disruptive. Un
dercover agents, informers,
invasion of privacy and tapped
telephones are an anonioly in
a situation where we are des
perately trying to substitute
inner controls for outside con
trol, to foster individual and
group responsibility and to
encourage mature behavior by

expecting mature behavior."
Dr. Dana L. Farnsworth, di
rector of the Harvard Univers
ity health service, told the sub
committee bluntly, "The present
laws against possession of mari
juana are so severe they're not
being enforced."
But the subcommittee heard
conflicting testimony from two
government officials who ap
peared before it.
Hary Giordano, commissioner
of the Bureau of Narcotics told
the subcommittee that, if pen
alties for marijuana were elim
inated, sellers of the drug would
"escape justice." He said 70 per
cent of federal marijuana ar

rests were for sales and that
many of those for possession
were persons "in possession of
large quantities of marijuana,
clearly destined for the market."
Food and Drug Commissioner
James Goddard hold the subcom
mittee that he "respected the
judgmnet" of enforcement offi
cers such as Giordano, although
he had earlier questioned the
severity of marijuana penalties.
This disagreement led Dodd
to say at the end of the hear
ings that "We must resolve the
conflicting judgments of educa
tors and law enforcement offici
als before we enact any new leg
islation on drug abuse."

conflicting testimony from two

Hary Giordano, commissioner
of the Bureau of Narcotics told
the subcommittee that, if pen

"escape justice." He said 70 per

rests were for sales and that
many of those for possession
were persons "in possession of
large quantities of marijuana,
clearly destined for the market."
Food and Drug Commissioner
James Goddard hold the subcom

severity of marijuana penalties.
