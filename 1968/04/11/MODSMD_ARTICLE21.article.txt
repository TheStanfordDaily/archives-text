# Anti-War Sentiment Hurts Peace Corps
## 
### WALTER GRANT College Press Service 
The Peace Corps, one Mecca
for many student idealists, may
now bo entering the most cru
cial period in its seven-year his
tory.
Although the Peace Corps has
been one of the most successful
and popular of the New Fron
tier programs initiated during
the Kennedy Administration, it
now faces many new and deli
cate problems, mostly as a di
rect result of the Vietnam war.
The tactfulness with which
these problems are solved with
in the next few years may well
determine whether the Peace
Corps can survive on a large
scale, and if so, its effectiveness
in accomplishing its original
mission.
Peare Corps officials, who
have had little trouble con
vincing young people to give
up two years of their life to
work in an underdeveloped
country, now find themselves
on the defensive. The major
problem is the Corps' close
association with the federal
government at a time when
the government is unpopular
among young people.
Peace Corps officials, includ
ing Agency Director Jack
Vaughn, will not admit the
Corps has problems. But other
high-ranking government offici
als have confirmed privately
that the Corps may be in
trouble.
Recruiting figures alone indi
cate the Peace Corps has les
appeal than a year ago. In No
vember 1966, the Peace Corps
received 7,097 applications from
college seniors. Last November,
only 3,768 seniors applied, a re
duction of nearly 50 percent.
The Peace Corps received
9,661 applications last Novem
ber, compared with 12,411 in
November 1966. Recruiting also
was down in December, with the
Corps receiving 7,095 applica
tions last December, compared
with 8,288 in 1966.
Peace Corps officials, how
ever, claim the Corps is not los
ing it appeal to students. "The
decrease is attributable to the
style of recruiting in the fall of
1966 compared to that in 1967,"
one official explained. "In late
1966, we put on a major recruit
ing drive which hit its peak in
November. In the fall of 1967,
however, we visited 25 per cent
fewer schools. During the cur
rent academic year, we will have
our major recruiting effort in
the spring."
Since most Peace Corps volun
teers come directly from the
campus, the Corps' recruiting

figures are based on the aca
demic year. So far, applications
this year are running about
4,000 behind last year. "But
with our major recruiting drive
still ahead of us, we expect to
at least equal last year's fig
ures," Vaughn says.
Despite efforts by Corps offici
als to convince the public it is
not losing its appeal, officials
admit the Corps is more con
troversial on the campus today
than at any other time in its his
tory.
The main reason for this,
Vaughn said, "is a feeling that
we are an official part of the
Establishment." One government
official explained, "Before the
United States became deeply in
volved in Vietnam, young peo
ple did not mind so much being
associated with the government,
but now they do."
However, Vaughn says the ex
panding group of student radi
cals who want to be completely
disassociated with the govern
ment is not affecting the Peace
Corps. "We don't in any sense,
or never have, tried to tailor a
message for the activist. Our
message is more to the con
cerned, and the concerned can
be of almost any political
stripe," he said in an interview.

November. In the fall of 1967,
however, we visited 25 per cent
fewer schools. During the cur
rent academic year, we will have
our major recruiting effort in
the spring."
Since most Peace Corps volun
teers come directly from the
campus, the Corps' recruiting

figures are based on the aca
demic year. So far, applications
this year are running about
4,000 behind last year. "But
with our major recruiting drive
still ahead of us, we expect to
at least equal last year's fig
ures," Vaughn says.
Despite efforts by Corps offici
als to convince the public it is
not losing its appeal, officials
admit the Corps is more con
troversial on the campus today
than at any other time in its his
tory.
The main reason for this,
Vaughn said, "is a feeling that
we are an official part of the
Establishment." One government
official explained, "Before the
United States became deeply in
volved in Vietnam, young peo
ple did not mind so much being
associated with the government,
but now they do."
However, Vaughn says the ex
panding group of student radi
cals who want to be completely
disassociated with the govern
ment is not affecting the Peace
Corps. "We don't in any sense,
or never have, tried to tailor a
message for the activist. Our
message is more to the con
cerned, and the concerned can
be of almost any political
stripe," he said in an interview.
The Peace Corps, one Mecca
for many student idealists, may
now bo entering the most cru
cial period in its seven-year his
tory.
Although the Peace Corps has
been one of the most successful
and popular of the New Fron
tier programs initiated during
the Kennedy Administration, it
now faces many new and deli
cate problems, mostly as a di
rect result of the Vietnam war.
The tactfulness with which
these problems are solved with
in the next few years may well
determine whether the Peace
Corps can survive on a large
scale, and if so, its effectiveness
in accomplishing its original
mission.
Peare Corps officials, who
have had little trouble con
vincing young people to give
up two years of their life to
work in an underdeveloped
country, now find themselves
on the defensive. The major
problem is the Corps' close
association with the federal
government at a time when
the government is unpopular
among young people.
Peace Corps officials, includ
ing Agency Director Jack
Vaughn, will not admit the
Corps has problems. But other
high-ranking government offici
als have confirmed privately
that the Corps may be in
trouble.
Recruiting figures alone indi
cate the Peace Corps has les
appeal than a year ago. In No
vember 1966, the Peace Corps
received 7,097 applications from
college seniors. Last November,
only 3,768 seniors applied, a re
duction of nearly 50 percent.
The Peace Corps received
9,661 applications last Novem
ber, compared with 12,411 in
November 1966. Recruiting also
was down in December, with the
Corps receiving 7,095 applica
tions last December, compared
with 8,288 in 1966.
Peace Corps officials, how
ever, claim the Corps is not los
ing it appeal to students. "The
decrease is attributable to the
style of recruiting in the fall of
1966 compared to that in 1967,"
one official explained. "In late
1966, we put on a major recruit
ing drive which hit its peak in
November. In the fall of 1967,
