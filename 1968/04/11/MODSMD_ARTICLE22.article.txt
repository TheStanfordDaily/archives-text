# Rally Today On Oakland
## 
### 
The Oakland demonstration of
April 23 will be discussed at a
noon White Plaza rally today.
Speakers at the rally will talk
about both the "Stop the Draft"
and the "Free Huey" aspects of
the April 23 demonstration.
Bob Avakian from Oakland
will speak on the Black Pan
ther's situation in Oakland as
well as action whites should
take in regards to the police
suppression of the Panthers and
the Blacks.
Avakian is a member of the
Oakland Peace and Freedom
Party and acts as liaison be
tween the Party and the Pan
thers. He was the only white
person to be included on the
speaker agenda at the recent
Huey Newton birthday rally,
which included Stokely Carmi
rhael and Rap Brown.
Jim Burke, coordinator of the
Free Huey action for the San
Mateo Peace and Freedom
Party, will also speak on the
Panthers and Black Power and
will emphasize the importance
of action to free Huey Newton.
Bob Mandel, one of the "Oak
land 7" who, with six other men,
was arrested during the last
Oakland demonstrations and
charged with "conspiracy to com
mit a misdemeanor" will ex
plain the "Stop the Draft" end
of the demonstration.
Finally, Army PFC Howard
Petrick will talk about anti war
resistance within the U.S. Army.
Organizers of the demonstra
tion feel that the two issues of
the draft and the suppression
of the Black Panthers are very
closely related and that both
necessitate attention and action
by whites.
