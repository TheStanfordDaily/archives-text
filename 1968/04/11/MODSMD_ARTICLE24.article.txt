# Whites Urge Self Education
## 
### 
Mrs. Norma Crockett, a clinical
psychologist in Palo Alto, has
organized a group of women in
the white community to treat
the problem of improving their
racial attitudes.
In a letter to the Palo Alto
Times Mrs. Crockett stated,
"Many devoted whites are work
ing directly with Negroes; many
devoted whites are working with
mixed black and white groups.
I am organizing a third type of
program: whites working with
whites to improve their own
attitudes."
Mrs. Crockett held the first
meeting April 9. About two
dozen women attended. "Our
plan," she said, "is to organize
small neighborhood discussion
groups, so that opinions and
feelings can be aired, and, with
the help of a moderator and the
utilization of the concern and
alarm most people are feeling
following Dr. King's assassina
tion, try to budge ourselves to
ward greater understanding and
willingness to act respons
ibly. . .
