# During Spring Break
## Service Projects Help Needy 
### BARBARA LEVIN 
Spring Break is only a week.
Just time enough .... to pre
sent an extemporaneous play
for a small rural community,
to register voters in an urban
ghetto, to travel 1,000 miles, to
plant 500 trees. Or, at least, six
ty Stanford students found time
to crowd in these activities plus
a few more.
The sixty participated in three
different work projects which
scattered them from Mexicali,
Mexico, to Covelo in Northern
California, to Oakland across the
Bay. The assortment of in
triguing locales provided only
the background for the varieties
of their undertakings.
Each of the three projects
was student-planned and cap
tured a certain amount of
group spontaneity. The reac
tions of many returning stu
dents reflect a desire to experi
ence as well as to serve.
Most workers found their
weeks' services "low on the
budget and high in educational
value." Many stressed their ori
ginal intention of "learning
something" about a particular
problem or area. Although mini
mal, criticism pointed to the
limitation inherent in a week
long project.
The smallest group, the Oak
land contingent, is most repre
sentative of the bend toward ex
periencing. The project, which
had been initially labeled a semi
nar study group, was sponsored
by the Stanford Y and the Unit
ed Campus Ministry.
Seven students and Beryl Ram
say, an assistant on the Y staff,
lived in East Oakland for a
week. According to Norma Don
aldson, a participant, they
learned that "more than a study
group is needed there." Al
though the group did some pre
cinct work for a congressional
candidate, they spent most of
their time meeting with differ
ent people and discussing the

problems present in both East
and West Oakland.
Mike Beneflel, another stu
dent in the group, felt that
"the complex problems of
Oakland, a city heavily popu
lated by minority groups and
with a high unemployment
rate, are aggravated by an es
tablished administration wldch
is largely unresponsive to
change."
The group also became aware
of the growing fears and feel
ings concerning this summer's
possible outbreaks. Miss Ramsey
felt that "confusion was obvi
ous." She reported that one of
the contacts had said, "Things
are getting bad because the peo
ple aren't talking anymore."
The group found their
neighborhood precinct work
helpful as a means of estab
lishing some type of commual
ever, Barbara Woodward noted
a growing frustration from
"the lack of our ability to real
ly relate to the massive prob
lems of the urban poor."
In contrast, the Covelo group
felt that the highlight of their
trip was their contact with the
people in this small community
north of Santa Rosa. This group
became aware of some of the
problems of a rural area, accord
ing to Bruce Stamik, organizer
of the student group.
Glenn Harra, who had also
participated in the project last
spring, felt the improved rap
port between the community and
this group of Stanford students
was one of this year's successes.
The project, sponsored by El
Toro Eating Club, is in its fourth
year. This spring seventeen stu
dents participated and spent a
week helping in the Covelo
schools as tutors and teachers
aides. Most of the students
worked with the high school
classes, preparing short lectures
or planning discussions.
Francie Marks, who was as
signed to the junior-senior En

gllsh class, helped the class
prepare a skit from Shake
speare. She explained her ex
citement over the innovations
which the Covelo students
made in the famous witches'
scene in Macßeth.
"They (the students) thought
it needed an ending and so they
made one. They threw one of
the witches into the pot along
with the rest of the brew."
Dr. Stanley Fischman, his wife
Linda, and their eleven-month
old baby joined the student
group. Fischman, who is faculty
resident at Toyon, is at the Stan
ford Medical School doing re
search in the area of child psy
chiatry. He livened up high
school biology classes during the
week by demonstrating frog
dissections.
An unexpected by-product of
the week visit was the entertain
ment which the Stanford group
provided for the small commu
nity. Glenn Harra commented
that the visit of seventeen col
lege students to the town cre
ated some confusion and general
excitement.
He explained that Covelo Is
a farming town, forty miles
from the next largest town of
Willits. Its position in the cen
ter of Round Valley ringed by
mountains, makes television
and radio reception difficult.
The half-Indian, half-Anglo
community seemed to enjoy the
short play presented by the stu
dents at a pot luck dinner. The
community responded later in
the week with a talent night of
its own.
Harra felt that the focus of
the week-long experience was
the expression of communal
unity found at the two pot luck
dinners.
The third group, known as the
Mexicali Project, also found that
"community dinners were a
good way to meet some of the
people." In this case, the dinners
were hosted by the Mexicali Ro
tary Club, which sponsored the
project.
Pell Fender, graduate student

in anthropology, explained that
the Rotary Club had purchased
the 550 trees which the Stanford
group planted in different parts
of the city. The thirty-eight stu
dents involved in the work lived
in the Casa de Juventud, a fed
erally-established youth center
in the city.
Carol Abbot, one of the par
ticipants, mentioned that liv
ing in this recreation center
gave the Stanford group the
opportunity to meet and talk
with some of the Mexican
children. She expressed her
own interest in the customs of
the city "which Is near the
border, but quite Mexican in
its appearance and atmos
phere."
This group expressed the sen
timents of all three groups con
cerning the successful mixing of
enjoyment and work. As one
sun-tanned member of the Mexi
cali crew said, "It was fun, and
we did set trees out at a couple
of schools and churches."

This group expressed the sen
timents of all three groups con
cerning the successful mixing of
enjoyment and work. As one
sun-tanned member of the Mexi

DINNER BREAK — Covelo residents join the work crew in a pot
luck supper.


CLEANING HOUSE — Jerry Rubens and Chuck Granieri tackle
the abandoned Covelo Indian School where the work crew stayed.
Spring Break is only a week.
Just time enough .... to pre
sent an extemporaneous play
for a small rural community,
to register voters in an urban
ghetto, to travel 1,000 miles, to
plant 500 trees. Or, at least, six
ty Stanford students found time
to crowd in these activities plus
a few more.
The sixty participated in three
different work projects which
scattered them from Mexicali,
Mexico, to Covelo in Northern
California, to Oakland across the
Bay. The assortment of in
triguing locales provided only
the background for the varieties
of their undertakings.
Each of the three projects
was student-planned and cap
tured a certain amount of
group spontaneity. The reac
tions of many returning stu
dents reflect a desire to experi
ence as well as to serve.
Most workers found their
weeks' services "low on the
budget and high in educational
value." Many stressed their ori
ginal intention of "learning
something" about a particular
problem or area. Although mini
mal, criticism pointed to the
limitation inherent in a week
long project.
The smallest group, the Oak
land contingent, is most repre
sentative of the bend toward ex
periencing. The project, which
had been initially labeled a semi
nar study group, was sponsored
by the Stanford Y and the Unit
ed Campus Ministry.
Seven students and Beryl Ram
say, an assistant on the Y staff,
lived in East Oakland for a
week. According to Norma Don
aldson, a participant, they
learned that "more than a study
group is needed there." Al
though the group did some pre
cinct work for a congressional
candidate, they spent most of
their time meeting with differ
ent people and discussing the

problems present in both East
and West Oakland.
Mike Beneflel, another stu
dent in the group, felt that
"the complex problems of
Oakland, a city heavily popu
lated by minority groups and
with a high unemployment
rate, are aggravated by an es
tablished administration wldch
is largely unresponsive to
change."
The group also became aware
of the growing fears and feel
ings concerning this summer's
possible outbreaks. Miss Ramsey
felt that "confusion was obvi
ous." She reported that one of
the contacts had said, "Things
are getting bad because the peo
ple aren't talking anymore."
The group found their
neighborhood precinct work
helpful as a means of estab
lishing some type of commual
ever, Barbara Woodward noted
a growing frustration from
"the lack of our ability to real
ly relate to the massive prob
lems of the urban poor."
In contrast, the Covelo group
felt that the highlight of their
trip was their contact with the
people in this small community
north of Santa Rosa. This group
became aware of some of the
problems of a rural area, accord
ing to Bruce Stamik, organizer
of the student group.
Glenn Harra, who had also
participated in the project last
spring, felt the improved rap
port between the community and
this group of Stanford students
was one of this year's successes.
The project, sponsored by El
Toro Eating Club, is in its fourth
year. This spring seventeen stu
dents participated and spent a
week helping in the Covelo
schools as tutors and teachers
aides. Most of the students
worked with the high school
classes, preparing short lectures
or planning discussions.
Francie Marks, who was as
signed to the junior-senior En

gllsh class, helped the class
prepare a skit from Shake
speare. She explained her ex
citement over the innovations
which the Covelo students
made in the famous witches'
scene in Macßeth.
"They (the students) thought
it needed an ending and so they
made one. They threw one of
the witches into the pot along
with the rest of the brew."
Dr. Stanley Fischman, his wife
Linda, and their eleven-month
old baby joined the student
group. Fischman, who is faculty
resident at Toyon, is at the Stan
ford Medical School doing re
search in the area of child psy
chiatry. He livened up high
school biology classes during the
week by demonstrating frog
dissections.
An unexpected by-product of
the week visit was the entertain
ment which the Stanford group
provided for the small commu
nity. Glenn Harra commented
that the visit of seventeen col
lege students to the town cre
ated some confusion and general
excitement.
He explained that Covelo Is
a farming town, forty miles
from the next largest town of
Willits. Its position in the cen
ter of Round Valley ringed by
mountains, makes television
and radio reception difficult.
The half-Indian, half-Anglo
community seemed to enjoy the
short play presented by the stu
dents at a pot luck dinner. The
community responded later in
the week with a talent night of
its own.
Harra felt that the focus of
the week-long experience was
the expression of communal
unity found at the two pot luck
dinners.
The third group, known as the
Mexicali Project, also found that
"community dinners were a
good way to meet some of the
people." In this case, the dinners
were hosted by the Mexicali Ro
tary Club, which sponsored the
project.
Pell Fender, graduate student

in anthropology, explained that
the Rotary Club had purchased
the 550 trees which the Stanford
group planted in different parts
of the city. The thirty-eight stu
dents involved in the work lived
in the Casa de Juventud, a fed
erally-established youth center
in the city.
Carol Abbot, one of the par
ticipants, mentioned that liv
ing in this recreation center
gave the Stanford group the
opportunity to meet and talk
with some of the Mexican
children. She expressed her
own interest in the customs of
the city "which Is near the
border, but quite Mexican in
its appearance and atmos
phere."
This group expressed the sen
timents of all three groups con
cerning the successful mixing of
enjoyment and work. As one

in the Casa de Juventud, a fed
erally-established youth center
in the city.
Carol Abbot, one of the par
ticipants, mentioned that liv
ing in this recreation center
gave the Stanford group the
opportunity to meet and talk
with some of the Mexican
children. She expressed her
own interest in the customs of
the city "which Is near the
border, but quite Mexican in
its appearance and atmos
phere."
This group expressed the sen
timents of all three groups con
cerning the successful mixing of
enjoyment and work. As one
sun-tanned member of the Mexi
cali crew said, "It was fun, and
we did set trees out at a couple
of schools and churches."


DINNER BREAK — Covelo residents join the work crew in a pot
luck supper.


CLEANING HOUSE — Jerry Rubens and Chuck Granieri tackle
the abandoned Covelo Indian School where the work crew stayed.
Spring Break is only a week.
Just time enough .... to pre
sent an extemporaneous play
for a small rural community,
to register voters in an urban
ghetto, to travel 1,000 miles, to
plant 500 trees. Or, at least, six
ty Stanford students found time
to crowd in these activities plus
a few more.
The sixty participated in three
different work projects which
scattered them from Mexicali,
Mexico, to Covelo in Northern
California, to Oakland across the
Bay. The assortment of in
triguing locales provided only
the background for the varieties
of their undertakings.
Each of the three projects
was student-planned and cap
tured a certain amount of
group spontaneity. The reac
tions of many returning stu
dents reflect a desire to experi
ence as well as to serve.
Most workers found their
weeks' services "low on the
budget and high in educational
value." Many stressed their ori
ginal intention of "learning
something" about a particular
problem or area. Although mini
mal, criticism pointed to the
limitation inherent in a week
long project.
The smallest group, the Oak
land contingent, is most repre
sentative of the bend toward ex
periencing. The project, which
had been initially labeled a semi
nar study group, was sponsored
by the Stanford Y and the Unit
ed Campus Ministry.
Seven students and Beryl Ram
say, an assistant on the Y staff,
lived in East Oakland for a
week. According to Norma Don
aldson, a participant, they
learned that "more than a study
group is needed there." Al
though the group did some pre
cinct work for a congressional
candidate, they spent most of
their time meeting with differ
ent people and discussing the

problems present in both East
and West Oakland.
Mike Beneflel, another stu
dent in the group, felt that
"the complex problems of
Oakland, a city heavily popu
lated by minority groups and
with a high unemployment
rate, are aggravated by an es
tablished administration wldch
is largely unresponsive to
change."
The group also became aware
of the growing fears and feel
ings concerning this summer's
possible outbreaks. Miss Ramsey
felt that "confusion was obvi
ous." She reported that one of
the contacts had said, "Things
are getting bad because the peo
ple aren't talking anymore."
The group found their
neighborhood precinct work
helpful as a means of estab
lishing some type of commual
ever, Barbara Woodward noted
a growing frustration from
"the lack of our ability to real
ly relate to the massive prob
lems of the urban poor."
In contrast, the Covelo group
felt that the highlight of their
trip was their contact with the
people in this small community
north of Santa Rosa. This group
became aware of some of the
problems of a rural area, accord
ing to Bruce Stamik, organizer
of the student group.
Glenn Harra, who had also
participated in the project last
spring, felt the improved rap
port between the community and
this group of Stanford students
was one of this year's successes.
The project, sponsored by El
Toro Eating Club, is in its fourth
year. This spring seventeen stu
dents participated and spent a
week helping in the Covelo
schools as tutors and teachers
aides. Most of the students
worked with the high school
classes, preparing short lectures
or planning discussions.
Francie Marks, who was as
signed to the junior-senior En

gllsh class, helped the class
prepare a skit from Shake
speare. She explained her ex
citement over the innovations
which the Covelo students
made in the famous witches'
scene in Macßeth.
"They (the students) thought
it needed an ending and so they
made one. They threw one of
the witches into the pot along
with the rest of the brew."
Dr. Stanley Fischman, his wife
Linda, and their eleven-month
old baby joined the student
group. Fischman, who is faculty
resident at Toyon, is at the Stan
ford Medical School doing re
search in the area of child psy
chiatry. He livened up high
school biology classes during the
week by demonstrating frog
dissections.
An unexpected by-product of
the week visit was the entertain
ment which the Stanford group
provided for the small commu
nity. Glenn Harra commented
that the visit of seventeen col
lege students to the town cre
ated some confusion and general
excitement.
He explained that Covelo Is
a farming town, forty miles
from the next largest town of
Willits. Its position in the cen
ter of Round Valley ringed by
mountains, makes television
and radio reception difficult.
The half-Indian, half-Anglo
community seemed to enjoy the
short play presented by the stu
dents at a pot luck dinner. The
community responded later in
the week with a talent night of
its own.
Harra felt that the focus of
the week-long experience was
the expression of communal
unity found at the two pot luck
dinners.
The third group, known as the
Mexicali Project, also found that
"community dinners were a
good way to meet some of the
people." In this case, the dinners
were hosted by the Mexicali Ro
tary Club, which sponsored the
project.
Pell Fender, graduate student

in anthropology, explained that
the Rotary Club had purchased
the 550 trees which the Stanford
group planted in different parts
of the city. The thirty-eight stu
dents involved in the work lived
in the Casa de Juventud, a fed
erally-established youth center
in the city.

Mexicali Project, also found that
"community dinners were a
good way to meet some of the
people." In this case, the dinners
were hosted by the Mexicali Ro
tary Club, which sponsored the
project.
Pell Fender, graduate student

in anthropology, explained that
the Rotary Club had purchased
the 550 trees which the Stanford
group planted in different parts
of the city. The thirty-eight stu
dents involved in the work lived
in the Casa de Juventud, a fed
erally-established youth center
in the city.
Carol Abbot, one of the par
ticipants, mentioned that liv
ing in this recreation center
gave the Stanford group the
opportunity to meet and talk
with some of the Mexican
children. She expressed her
own interest in the customs of
the city "which Is near the
border, but quite Mexican in
its appearance and atmos
phere."
This group expressed the sen
timents of all three groups con
cerning the successful mixing of
enjoyment and work. As one
sun-tanned member of the Mexi
cali crew said, "It was fun, and
we did set trees out at a couple
of schools and churches."
