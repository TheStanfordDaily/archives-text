## Tigers Tabbed For AL Flag 
### Gary Cavalli 
The American League pennant race used to arouse about as
much excitement as a TV rerun being shown for the seventh time.
It wasn't that people didn't care about the AL, it was just a fore
gone conclusion that the New York Yankees would win the league
championship.
Times have changed. Whereas the other nine managers used to
plot and scheme in hopes of a second-place finish, they can now
cast furtive glances at the AL pennant, confident that they have
as much chance as everyone else for all the marbles.
Last season four teams battled right down to the last day of
the season before the Boston Red Sox clinched the pennant. The
once-proud Yankees found themselves in ninth place, only a length
ahead of the cellar-dwelling Athletics. The current campaign prom
ises to wind up with the same type of photo-finish involving six
tightly bunched AL clubs, with the final standings as follows:
1. Detroit. The Tigers have an outstanding starting rotation,
solid fielding, and a consistent hitting attack. If Mayo Smith can
find a dependable relief pitcher, his ballclub should take it all.
2. Baltimore. A sore-armed pitching staff and a bad year from
Boog Powell kept the Orioles out of contention in 1967. If both these
ills are remedied, the Birds may repeat their fantastic pennant
winning performance of '66.
3. Minnesota. The elbow injury to Jim Kaat may cause the Twins
to get off to a slow start. While they've got the hitting and the
pitching, the Twins have a Swiss cheese defense and always seem
to fail to do the little things that win ballgames.
4. Boston. Last year's Cinderella team has been dealt a pair of
crippling blows. The loss of prize outfielder Tony Conigliaro and
Cy Young Award winner Jim Lonborg's skiing accident may prove
fatal to the Sox pennant hopes.
5. California. The Angels, a rapidly improving young ballclub,
could win it all if their pitching comes around. The addition of
righthander Sammy Ellis could help in this department.
6. Chicago. The acquisition of veterans Tommy Davis and Luis
Aparicio will help, but the Sox still lack the potent offense neces
sary to complement their excellent pitching staff.
7. Cleveland. The Indians have had excellent potential for several
years, but somehow never come up with a winner. The pitching
once again appears solid, but Alvin Dark's crew may have trouble
scoring enough runs.
8. Oakland. The Athletics have some promising faces in Sal
Bando, Rick Monday and Catfish Hunter. With a good, young
pitching staff, the A's should have a bright future.
9. New York. It's been a long trip downhill for the pin-striped
Yankees. They have adequate pitching and an aging superstar in
Mickey Mantle, but that's about all.
10. Washington. Veteran slugger Frank Howard and coming
star Paul Casanova should provide some interesting moments. If
their pitching holds up as well as it did in spring training, the
Senators may move up as high as eighth.

championship.
Times have changed. Whereas the other nine managers used to
plot and scheme in hopes of a second-place finish, they can now
cast furtive glances at the AL pennant, confident that they have
as much chance as everyone else for all the marbles.
Last season four teams battled right down to the last day of
the season before the Boston Red Sox clinched the pennant. The
once-proud Yankees found themselves in ninth place, only a length
ahead of the cellar-dwelling Athletics. The current campaign prom
ises to wind up with the same type of photo-finish involving six
tightly bunched AL clubs, with the final standings as follows:
1. Detroit. The Tigers have an outstanding starting rotation,
solid fielding, and a consistent hitting attack. If Mayo Smith can
find a dependable relief pitcher, his ballclub should take it all.
2. Baltimore. A sore-armed pitching staff and a bad year from
Boog Powell kept the Orioles out of contention in 1967. If both these
ills are remedied, the Birds may repeat their fantastic pennant
winning performance of '66.
3. Minnesota. The elbow injury to Jim Kaat may cause the Twins
to get off to a slow start. While they've got the hitting and the
pitching, the Twins have a Swiss cheese defense and always seem
to fail to do the little things that win ballgames.
4. Boston. Last year's Cinderella team has been dealt a pair of
crippling blows. The loss of prize outfielder Tony Conigliaro and
Cy Young Award winner Jim Lonborg's skiing accident may prove
fatal to the Sox pennant hopes.
5. California. The Angels, a rapidly improving young ballclub,
could win it all if their pitching comes around. The addition of
righthander Sammy Ellis could help in this department.
6. Chicago. The acquisition of veterans Tommy Davis and Luis
Aparicio will help, but the Sox still lack the potent offense neces
sary to complement their excellent pitching staff.
7. Cleveland. The Indians have had excellent potential for several
years, but somehow never come up with a winner. The pitching
once again appears solid, but Alvin Dark's crew may have trouble
scoring enough runs.
8. Oakland. The Athletics have some promising faces in Sal
Bando, Rick Monday and Catfish Hunter. With a good, young
pitching staff, the A's should have a bright future.
9. New York. It's been a long trip downhill for the pin-striped
Yankees. They have adequate pitching and an aging superstar in
Mickey Mantle, but that's about all.
10. Washington. Veteran slugger Frank Howard and coming
star Paul Casanova should provide some interesting moments. If
their pitching holds up as well as it did in spring training, the
Senators may move up as high as eighth.
The American League pennant race used to arouse about as
much excitement as a TV rerun being shown for the seventh time.
It wasn't that people didn't care about the AL, it was just a fore
gone conclusion that the New York Yankees would win the league
championship.
