# More Than Concern
## Great Crises Require Bigger Ideas

troubling answers.)

Let us hope that the Days of
Concern will be more than an
other flower parade.
1968 is not a year like any
other, and yet we continue to
discuss the issues as if all we
needed were some comfortable
marginal changes in the cur
rent system. Rut the present sys
tem is exactly what has brought
about the deadlock in Asia and
machine guns on the Capitol
steps; the only thing we can do
is to design the next system.
The scale of events has be
come so big and dreadful that
it can only be compared to a
handful of previous catastro
phes, such as the? death of mil
lions in the trench of the first
world war. It is the kind of his
tory that one reads and then
asks, "How could they carry on
with their lives when all that
was happening? How is it that
all the young people just did
what they were told, when it
was. so perfectly clear that the
cause was trivial?"
Well, our turn has come in
1%8, and most of us are doing
exactly as we are told. We must
ask who allowed this to hap
pen and who was out there guid
ing us.
The frightening feature of
World War I was that all the
Institutions that made the
European politi<*al system so
successful were precisely those
institutions which forced thif
war to now dimensions of hor
ror. It was the loyalty of the
troops, the technology for
weapon production, the priests
who bl<*ssed the men as they
marched oft to kill and be
killed. Without all these noble

qualities there could not have|
been a war; even with all this
they could never solve the cri
sis. It simply wasn't suscep
tible to that kind of Initiative
any more.
19fi8 finds us in exactly the
same situation. The war and the
ghettos are not freak events,
but the natural outgrowths of
society's most basic institutions.
So it is unlikely that these same
institutions will be able to pro
vide the radical change that is
necessary for cure and lasting
immunity.
Churches have blessed the men
as they were shipped out; how
much can we trust the clergy
in the future? Our technology
has made Guernica into an every
day event; on what terms will
we allow technology to change
our lives in the future?
More frightening still, most
of the killing has been done by
young people, acquiescing in the
war, revolting in the streets. So
we ourselves have no special
immunity.
Tomorrow and Saturday we
will talk about the university.
Perhaps we will find the very
qualities that make the univer
sity so important are also the
characteristics that paralyze it.
The independence that is cher
ished (all things are "cherish
ed" at universities) Ls also the
quality which prevents us from
doing anything.
At a university, actually, we
watch as someone else does
something. For example, when
people wanted to take part in
the Poor Peoples' March in
Washington, they couldn't be
seen as literally participating.
Instead, they had to promise to
take some neutral position on
the sidelines. Is this what we
are being trained to do?
The other built-in negative
quality of the university is that

we write about everything. That
statement is so obvious that it
is hardly worth saying, yet the
act of writing seems to distance
ourselves from the feelings of
others. When we are writing
about novels and poems, it is
only to analyze the feelings and
to put them into neat slots. We
use writing to gain control of
emotion, to sterilize feeling.
Our values are becoming
heavily slanted in favor of con
cepts peculiar to technology but
perhaps inappropriate to us as
human beings. In our own pri
vate lives, we may be forced
into habits of the McNamara/
Westmoreland life-style, in which
one has only to add up the num
ber of power stations and
bridges destroyed in North Viet
nam to determine that they
must be losing the war.
Similarly, one has only to
give people measureable quan
tities of dollars, cars and bed
rooms and they will automatical
ly become happy. It has reached
the point where the relationship
between technology and happi
ness is no longer cjuestioned â€”
the two are presumed to be

synonymous.
When our own people are riot
ing, our response is still only
technological. The police arm
themselves with bigger guns and
"instant banana-peel." But Isn't
there an alternative to killing
or suppressing our own people?
Probably the fundamental
cause of the Vietnam/ghetto
complex is the over-weening
pride we have in our own cul
ture. Nothing else could explain
the way we go around manag
ing other peoples' business. With
our own minority groups a sec
ond class citizenry, we still take
time off to tell foreigners how
to organize their countries.
This patronizing of other cul
tures is so much a feature of
our society that it is difficult
to recognize it in ourselves. It
accounts for the "kindly" way
we help other people. It is not
evil that makes our culture in
terfere; it is a total lack of ap
preciation for the good things
that are a vital part of the other
culture. It is a total lack of
empathy.
Each minority group fights
to get two points across: they

deserve the basic services and
security as much as anyone else,
and they want their own cul
ture to be treated on the same
level as the majority's culture.
These factors are essential
to their sense of identity.
The destruction of Vietnamese
culture is just another example
of an old process - such as
Jesuits imposing their religion
on red Indians, thus destroying
their culture, sometimes their
language, often their will to
exist.
We always talk about the sur
face reasons for events. We read
books about the history of Viet
nam, and we are confident this
will give us explanations. Mr.
Hillsman and others will prob
ably tell us about the complex
mistakes that were made.
But we need to know why our
culture is forcing itself upon the
Vietnamese and the Afro-Ameri
cans, and why it is doing so in a
technological way. We don't
want to learn how to run an
other Vietnam more effectively.
We do want to know what it is
in ourselves and our institutions
that brought about these crises.
