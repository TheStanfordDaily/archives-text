College Press Service
More than 200 students from
Bowie State College, a small,
predominantly black school in
southern Maryland, were arrest
ed in the State House in Annapo
lis a week ago, climaxing anoth
er week of protests by students
from East Coast black colleges.
Students at two other black
schools—Virginia Union College
in Richmond and Lafayette
State Teachers College in Lafay
ette, N.C.—adopted the tech

nique originated by students at
Howard University in Washing
ton and took over their respec
tive administration buildings.
By Friday, students at Lafay
ette had negotiated a settlement
with the administration and had
left the building. At Virginia
Union the students continued to
hold the building Friday, but
negotiations were underway
with administration officials.
Bowie State students had
taken over the school's adminis
tration building the previous
week, in an attempt to drama
tize their dissatisfaction with
the state's support for the col
lege. After a meeting with the
Maryland attorney general,
though, students agreed to va
cate the building.
Even though classes resumed,
however, Student Government
President Roland Smith prom
ised that the students would
start demonstrating again if
there was no promise of state
action to aid Bowie. When. Gov.
Spiro T. Agnew continued his re
fusal to recognize the student's
grievances, they decided to hold
the sit-in at the State House.
Agnew ordered the state
troopers on the scene to arrest
the students sitting-in at 5 p.m.
A total of 227 were arrested,
and charged with trespassing,
which carries a maximum penal
ty of six months in jail or a
$1,000 fine. They all were subse
quently released without bond.

At Bowie, as at tho other two
schools where protests broke
out this week, students have
drawn up a long list of griev
ances. Many of them relate to
educational reforms that the
students want, while others deal
with such mattors as the qual
ity and service at the dining
hall, and strict social regula
tions.
At Virginia State College, a
predominantly black school in
Petersburg, Va., students won
some major concessions after a
week-long boycott of classes.
A student grievance commit
tee drew up a grievance report
that ran to 30 pages, and called
for a great number of academic
reforms, as well as some im
provements in services for stu
dents.
The committee started meet
ing with an administration com
mittee, and after a series of
marathon sessions, reached an
agreement on most of the ma
jor issues. Classes resumed on
Friday.
Among the concessions won
by the students were, a tempo
rary suspension of compulsory
ROTC; a promise that a new
management would be brought
in to run the dining hall; an
agreement that art and music
courses would include the study
of African, Oriental and Negro
American works; and a greater
students representation on the
school's judicial committee.
