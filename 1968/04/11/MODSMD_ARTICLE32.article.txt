# SLAC Gets Bubble Chamber
## 
### 
An 82-inch hydrogen bubble
chamber, longest in the world,
went into action in early March
at the Stanford Linear Acceler
ator Center (SLAC) detecting
nuclear "events" that occur
when the two-mile atom smash
er's particle beams bombard the
liquid hydrogen in the chamber.
The stainless steel chamber, 82
inches long by 20 inches square,
makes nuclear particle tracks
visible. Camera and lighting
equipment built into the cham
ber photograph them.
Filled with liquid hydrogen
kept close to absolute zero
(minus 414 degrees Fahrenheit)
the chamber is insulated by a
high-vacuum tank and multiple
layers of aluminized plastic
sheets.
It is kept cold in addition by
a circulating bath of liquid hy
drogen. The fluid in the cham
ber itself is sealed in, thus eli
minating problems of dirt or
impurities which complicate the
operation of some bubble cham
bers.
A bellows-operated piston at
the bottom of the chamber keeps
the liquid hydrogen at five times
atmospheric pressure (75 psi).
This prevents it from boiling,
since its minus 414 degree fah
renheit temperature is about
nine degrees over the boiling
point of liquid hydrogen.
When nuclear events are to be
recorded, the piston drops the
pressure to about two atmos
pheres (32 psi). At the lowered
pressure, high-energy particles
entering through a thin stain
less steel window in one end of
the chamber cause tiny vapor
bubbles to boil up along their
paths through the liquid.
These tracks are clearly visible
and can be photographed. The
piston then re-applies pressure,
the hubbies disappear and the
chamber is ready for another
cycle.
Surrounding: the chamber is
a 2001 ton electromagnet. Its
17,r>00 - gauss field, 35,000
times stronger than the earth's
magnetic field, bends the paths
of file particles. Since the bend
ing is proportional to the mo
mentum (mass x velocity) of
each particle, this enables phy
cists to identify them and un
derstand the sub-nuclear event
that is occuring.
Now showing in the huge bub
ble chamber are the tracks of
events caused by 12-billion-volt

K-mesons, or "kaons", produced
by high-energy electrons strik
ing a block of beryllium.
Lawrence Radiation Labora
tory (LRL Physicists of UC-
Berkeley) proposed the experi
ment. It was agreed earlier that
LRL physicists would be the
first to use the 82-inch bubble
chamber, for it was developed
and operated at Berkeley for
nerly eight years while it was
10 inches shorter. During the
last year it was rebuilt and
lengthened for SLAC by an LRL
team, many of whom now have
joined the SLAC staff.
At SLAC, a national facility
operated by Stanford University
under contract with the U.S.
Atomic Energy Commission
(AEC), the bubble chamber is
available once more for use by
experimenters from institutions
throughout the world.
Originally the 82-inch bub
ble chamber cost about $2
million to build under AEC
sponsorship. It was used by
LRL's Prof, Luis \V. Alvarez
and his associates with the six
billion 2-volt Betatron, a pro
ton accelerator, and resulted
in the discovery of many new
short-lived particles.
Prof. Joseph Ballam, director
of SLAC's research division, su
pervised the remodeling, which
cost $500,000. Drs. Joseph Mur
ray of SLAC and Stanley Flatte
of LRL are directing the kaon
experiments now being run.
Dr. Murray spoke of future

bubble chamber experiments
which will use a "polarized gam
ma ray beam" suggested by a
Tufts University physicist, Prof.
Richard H. Milburn.
The new beam will be formed
by shining a laser light into the
accelerator's beam of high-ener
gy electrons, causing photons
of laser light to bounce off with
their energies increased billions
of times. Hundreds of thousands
of photons are thus transform
ed into billion — volt gamma
ray's of essentially equal ener
gies, all of them polarized —
that is, all light in one direction
relative to their motion.
"There are properties virl
tnally impossible to achieve
by means of any process act
ing directly on high-energy
gamma rays,' 'said Dr. Mur
ray. "They arise naturally
here because of the highly
concentrated, bunched pulses
and straight-line acceleration
of the electrons in SLAC's pen
cil beam, and the polarized,
monoenergetic character of
the laser light photons.
"It will open up a new and
literally unexplored area of phy
sics that couldn't be done any
where else in the world."

a 2001 ton electromagnet. Its
17,r>00 - gauss field, 35,000
times stronger than the earth's
magnetic field, bends the paths

Lawrence Radiation Labora
tory (LRL Physicists of UC-
Berkeley) proposed the experi
ment. It was agreed earlier that
LRL physicists would be the
first to use the 82-inch bubble
chamber, for it was developed
and operated at Berkeley for
nerly eight years while it was
10 inches shorter. During the
last year it was rebuilt and
lengthened for SLAC by an LRL
team, many of whom now have
joined the SLAC staff.
At SLAC, a national facility
operated by Stanford University
under contract with the U.S.
Atomic Energy Commission
(AEC), the bubble chamber is
available once more for use by
experimenters from institutions
throughout the world.
Originally the 82-inch bub
ble chamber cost about $2
million to build under AEC
sponsorship. It was used by
LRL's Prof, Luis \V. Alvarez
and his associates with the six
billion 2-volt Betatron, a pro
ton accelerator, and resulted
in the discovery of many new
short-lived particles.
Prof. Joseph Ballam, director
of SLAC's research division, su
pervised the remodeling, which
cost $500,000. Drs. Joseph Mur
ray of SLAC and Stanley Flatte
of LRL are directing the kaon
experiments now being run.
Dr. Murray spoke of future

bubble chamber experiments
which will use a "polarized gam
ma ray beam" suggested by a
Tufts University physicist, Prof.
Richard H. Milburn.
The new beam will be formed
by shining a laser light into the
accelerator's beam of high-ener
gy electrons, causing photons
of laser light to bounce off with
their energies increased billions
of times. Hundreds of thousands
of photons are thus transform
ed into billion — volt gamma
ray's of essentially equal ener
gies, all of them polarized —
that is, all light in one direction
relative to their motion.
"There are properties virl
tnally impossible to achieve
by means of any process act
ing directly on high-energy
gamma rays,' 'said Dr. Mur
ray. "They arise naturally
here because of the highly
concentrated, bunched pulses
and straight-line acceleration
of the electrons in SLAC's pen
cil beam, and the polarized,
monoenergetic character of
the laser light photons.
"It will open up a new and
literally unexplored area of phy
sics that couldn't be done any
where else in the world."


BUBBLE CHAMBER — The linear accelerator center recently
installed a bubble chamber to aid in its experiments. Shown here
are accelerator officials and the designers of the chamber. The
chamber cost $2 million.
An 82-inch hydrogen bubble
chamber, longest in the world,
went into action in early March
at the Stanford Linear Acceler
ator Center (SLAC) detecting
nuclear "events" that occur
when the two-mile atom smash
er's particle beams bombard the
liquid hydrogen in the chamber.
The stainless steel chamber, 82
inches long by 20 inches square,
makes nuclear particle tracks
visible. Camera and lighting
equipment built into the cham
ber photograph them.
Filled with liquid hydrogen
kept close to absolute zero
(minus 414 degrees Fahrenheit)
the chamber is insulated by a
high-vacuum tank and multiple
layers of aluminized plastic
sheets.
It is kept cold in addition by
a circulating bath of liquid hy
drogen. The fluid in the cham
ber itself is sealed in, thus eli
minating problems of dirt or
impurities which complicate the
operation of some bubble cham
bers.
A bellows-operated piston at
the bottom of the chamber keeps
the liquid hydrogen at five times
atmospheric pressure (75 psi).
This prevents it from boiling,
since its minus 414 degree fah
renheit temperature is about
nine degrees over the boiling
point of liquid hydrogen.
When nuclear events are to be
recorded, the piston drops the
pressure to about two atmos
pheres (32 psi). At the lowered
pressure, high-energy particles
entering through a thin stain
less steel window in one end of
the chamber cause tiny vapor
bubbles to boil up along their
paths through the liquid.
These tracks are clearly visible
and can be photographed. The
piston then re-applies pressure,
the hubbies disappear and the
chamber is ready for another
cycle.

million to build under AEC
sponsorship. It was used by
LRL's Prof, Luis \V. Alvarez
and his associates with the six
billion 2-volt Betatron, a pro
ton accelerator, and resulted
in the discovery of many new
short-lived particles.
Prof. Joseph Ballam, director
of SLAC's research division, su
pervised the remodeling, which
cost $500,000. Drs. Joseph Mur
ray of SLAC and Stanley Flatte
of LRL are directing the kaon
experiments now being run.
Dr. Murray spoke of future

bubble chamber experiments
which will use a "polarized gam
ma ray beam" suggested by a
Tufts University physicist, Prof.
Richard H. Milburn.
The new beam will be formed
by shining a laser light into the
accelerator's beam of high-ener
gy electrons, causing photons
of laser light to bounce off with
their energies increased billions
of times. Hundreds of thousands
of photons are thus transform
ed into billion — volt gamma
ray's of essentially equal ener
gies, all of them polarized —
that is, all light in one direction
relative to their motion.
"There are properties virl
tnally impossible to achieve
by means of any process act
ing directly on high-energy
gamma rays,' 'said Dr. Mur
ray. "They arise naturally
here because of the highly
concentrated, bunched pulses
and straight-line acceleration
of the electrons in SLAC's pen
cil beam, and the polarized,
monoenergetic character of
the laser light photons.
"It will open up a new and
literally unexplored area of phy
sics that couldn't be done any
where else in the world."


BUBBLE CHAMBER — The linear accelerator center recently
installed a bubble chamber to aid in its experiments. Shown here
are accelerator officials and the designers of the chamber. The
chamber cost $2 million.
An 82-inch hydrogen bubble
chamber, longest in the world,
went into action in early March
at the Stanford Linear Acceler
ator Center (SLAC) detecting
nuclear "events" that occur
when the two-mile atom smash
er's particle beams bombard the
liquid hydrogen in the chamber.
The stainless steel chamber, 82
inches long by 20 inches square,
makes nuclear particle tracks
visible. Camera and lighting
equipment built into the cham
ber photograph them.
Filled with liquid hydrogen
kept close to absolute zero
(minus 414 degrees Fahrenheit)
the chamber is insulated by a
high-vacuum tank and multiple
layers of aluminized plastic
sheets.
It is kept cold in addition by
a circulating bath of liquid hy
drogen. The fluid in the cham
ber itself is sealed in, thus eli
minating problems of dirt or
impurities which complicate the
operation of some bubble cham
bers.
A bellows-operated piston at
the bottom of the chamber keeps
the liquid hydrogen at five times
atmospheric pressure (75 psi).
This prevents it from boiling,
since its minus 414 degree fah
renheit temperature is about
nine degrees over the boiling
point of liquid hydrogen.
When nuclear events are to be
recorded, the piston drops the
pressure to about two atmos
pheres (32 psi). At the lowered
pressure, high-energy particles
entering through a thin stain
less steel window in one end of
the chamber cause tiny vapor
bubbles to boil up along their
paths through the liquid.
These tracks are clearly visible
and can be photographed. The
piston then re-applies pressure,
the hubbies disappear and the
chamber is ready for another
cycle.
Surrounding: the chamber is
a 2001 ton electromagnet. Its
17,r>00 - gauss field, 35,000
times stronger than the earth's
magnetic field, bends the paths
of file particles. Since the bend
ing is proportional to the mo
mentum (mass x velocity) of
each particle, this enables phy
cists to identify them and un
derstand the sub-nuclear event
that is occuring.
Now showing in the huge bub
ble chamber are the tracks of
events caused by 12-billion-volt

K-mesons, or "kaons", produced
by high-energy electrons strik
ing a block of beryllium.
Lawrence Radiation Labora
tory (LRL Physicists of UC-
Berkeley) proposed the experi
ment. It was agreed earlier that
LRL physicists would be the
first to use the 82-inch bubble
chamber, for it was developed
and operated at Berkeley for
nerly eight years while it was
10 inches shorter. During the
last year it was rebuilt and
lengthened for SLAC by an LRL
team, many of whom now have
joined the SLAC staff.
At SLAC, a national facility
operated by Stanford University
under contract with the U.S.
Atomic Energy Commission
(AEC), the bubble chamber is
available once more for use by
experimenters from institutions
throughout the world.
