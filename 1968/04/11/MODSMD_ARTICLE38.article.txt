# Indicted Student Slated To Speak
## 
### 
Michael Ferber, indicted Janu
ary 5 by a Boston Grand Jury
along with four others, includ
ing Dr. Benjamin Spock and
William Sloane Coffin, for con
spiracy "to commit offenses
against the United States," will
speak at 8 tonight in Tresidder.
The lecture "Resistance: Con
spiracy or Community" is spon
sored by the Student Religious
Liberals, a Unitarian college
student organization.
Coffin and Ferber were indict
ed partly for their participation
in the service of "conscience and
acceptance" at Arlington Street
Unitarian Church in Boston.
Michael Ferber's sermon "A
Time To Say No" was especially
cited as an "overt act in further
ance of said conspiracy."
In the sermon, Ferber de
clared that "we have come here
to show that we are united to
do one thing: to say no. Each

of our acts of returning our
draft cards is our personal no.
When we put them in a single
container or set fire to them
from a single candle we express
the simple basis of our unity."
Ferber also had some hard
words to say on religion. "It
would not surprise me if many
of the clergymen who are here
today feel some of the same
contempt for organized religion
that our unreligious or anti-re
ligious brothers feel.
"They know better than we
do the long and bloody history
of evils committed in the name
of religion."
