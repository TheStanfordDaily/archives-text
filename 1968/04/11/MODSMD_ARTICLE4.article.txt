# Damaging And Irrelevant
## BSC Hits White Education 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
White education is not only
irrelevant for blacks but harm
ful to both blacks and whites,
according to a Black Student
Union (BSU) panel on "Is White
Education Irrelevant for Black
People?" in Tresidder Union
last night.
"The system is damaging,"
Bob Hoover, special administra
tive assistant at the College of
San Mateo, said.
"It very subtlely turns al
most every white kid who
goes through the system into
a white supremist. It turns al
most every black kid who goes
through the system into a
black inferior."
Warren Heyman, vice-princi
pal of an East Palo Alto elemen
tary school, said the white edu
cational system "feeds upon and
perpetuates white racism. The
black child is left ignorant of
his culture."
Aside from criticism of ele
mentary and secondary school
education, colleges, especially
Stanford, came under fire.
Letitia Carter, a senior Span
ish major and panelist at Tues
day night's confrontation be
tween the BSU and the Stanford
administration, said she felt the
demands the BSU presented to
the University were "completely
relevant to the situation."
She noted that the Western
Civilization course, which all
freshmen must take, "has
nothing—no mention whatso
ever of black people in it,"
making it "completely irrele
vant and alien" to students
coming from a black ghetto.
"All education for black peo
ple coming here is self-taught,"
Miss Carter continued. "There's
no one to talk to, no advisers."
Joyce King, a junior, agreed
with her, "If you don't teach
yourself, you become less black,
more white."
After voicing this view, Miss
Carter was asked what Stanford
has done for her.

"It hasn't really helped me,"
she replied. "But by being an
obstacle, it has helped me
learn more about myself."
Mary Montle, a graduate stu
dent in education, also respond
ed to the question, saying the
degree was important, because
"when I'm going to raise hell,
I'm going to raise hell with
credentials."
The attitudes of the white
educational system as presented
through the teachers and cur
riculum was criticized strongly.
The social sciences were hit
by Hoover. The way they are
taught "fosters white superior
ity and black inferiority," he
said.
"Take a look at a history,"
Hoover continued. "How many
blacks or Mexican-Americans
are shown in a positive light?''
He criticized sociology, claim
ing the books ; don't say people
are on welfare * because they
can't get jobs because of union
racism and other racism."
Hoover also noted that teach
ers, who are mainly from the
white middle class, feel that the
blacks have no real culture,
language, or art of their own,
so they try to teach them the
one they know, that of white
America.
"But the black community is
just as valid a community as
the white community," he said.
"This is why I am against
integration in education at
this point. I want to have con
trol over who is going to
teach my children and what
they are taught.
"I don't want my child to be
controlled by an educational
system controlled by white peo
ple," he said, noting that he felt
people who have gone through
the present system can no long
er change.
The problem of training more
blacks as teachers was also men
tioned, since they would be
needed to implement a program
such as Hoover suggested.

Heyman recommended a new
system of teacher accreditation,
by allowing people with some
college training to enter the
schools as aides, and move up
to assistant teacher, then associ
ate, and finally become accre
dited as a full teacher.
Frank Satterwhite, a graduate
student in education and mod
erator of the panel, commented,
"We don't need more Negro ed
ucators in the system—we need
black people."
