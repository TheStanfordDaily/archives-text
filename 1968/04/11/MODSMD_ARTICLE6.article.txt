# Washington Study Off; Seminars To Continue
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
Stanford has cancelled its
planned program of "partici
pant observation" in the Poor
People's Campaign.
The current disorder in Wash
ington, D.C. and the delay in
plans for an encampment of the
nation's poor in the capital since
the death of the organizer Mar
tin Luther King, Jr. led to the
sponsoring group's decision.
All of the students in the pro
gram will continue with the
basic seminar, and several stu
dents will continue with special
seminars which have been or
ganized.
Those students who have de
cided to become involved in the
mobilization will not be con
nected with any University pro
gram.

Prof. Charles Drekmeier, head
of the group of faculty members
and graduate assistants who or
ganized the Washington Field
Study Program, stressed that
of basic concern to the group
was "the general belief that the
Poor People's Camapign could
not be organized until the end
of May."
Any possibility for even a
vaguely educational program
evolving was dispelled by Elliot
Leibow from the National Insti
tute of Mental Health and one
of the two instructors for the
Stanford students while they
were to be in Washington.
Liebow told Drekmeier
Tuesday that the entire* Wash
ington staff for the Southern
Christian Leadership Confer
ence (SCLC) was in Atlanta
for King's funeral. Prior to
that time, the group hadn't
answered the telephone.
The sponsoring group for
Stanford's program announced
that the "introductory methodo
logical and substantive seminar
will continue." To qualify for
the five units of credit offered,
the students must either take a
final or present an essay or re
search proposal based on topics
covered.
Upon completion of the sem
inar this Wednesday, the five
UCLA students who had been
associated with the Stanford
program prior to doing field
research in Washington will re
turn to resume class work at
their campus.
Some of the students plan
ning to work in Washington

have decided to enroll in other
University courses. Many others
have indicated a desire to con
tinue with two five unit re
search projects established since
cancellation of the Washington
Program.
The faculty members and
graduate assistants who are of
fering the seminar on field-study
methods are now offering a sec
ond on "Problems of Poverty
Race In America." This sem
inar will offer students the "op
portunity for field research in
the Stanford area."
In addition, C. Kenneth-
Prewitt, visiting assistant
political science professor, has
opened a seminar on "Insti
tutionalized Racism" in which
an estimated ten students
from the Washington Pro
gram will participate.
Prewitt indicated last night
that "in all likelihood the sem
inar will serve as a resource
center" for preparing the educa
tional packets for use by Stan
ford students during the sum
mer before civic groups in their
communities. Political Science
Professor David Abernethy sug
gested this response by Stan
ford students during the colloq
uim "Stanford's Response on
White Racism" Monday.
Drekmeier pointed out that in
struction offered will "still be
relevant to the Poor People's
Campaign." There is a possibil
it that students who want to
participate in this Campaign in
dividually will be able to com
plete their studies in enough
time to arrive in Washington in
late May.
