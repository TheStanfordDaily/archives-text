# White Student Groups Voice Support For BSU's Demands
## 
### 
At least three groups of white
students have issued statements
in support of the ten Black Stu
dent Union (BSU) demands.
Members of the newly formed
Students Against White Racism
adopted a resolution indicting
themselves as white racists Tues
day night. At a meeting on Mon
day night the group stated they
"fully support the demands of
the BSU."
Members of the "Student
Involvement Team of Stanford
University," a year long un
dergraduate course, stated in
recommendations released yes

terday, "We see the accept
ance of the BSU's ten de
mands as a sincere step to
ward allowing black America}
its proper role In the Ameri
can society."
A group of four students who
feel that the Students Against
White Racism aren't adequately
emphasizing possible courses of
University response listed their
recommendations in a letter to
President Sterling and Provost
Lyman.
"It is vital that (the white
community) be moved to action
before they settle once again

into apathy and the forces of
fear, reaction and racism," the
group stated.
The seven-member Executive
Committee of the Students
Against White Racism urged all
members of the Stanford com
munity to support the vigil call
ed outside the meeting of the
BSU and the Stanford admini
stration at 2 p.m. today.
The second white student
group also indicated support
of the vigil. Graham Cham
bers, one of the four students
who drafted the letter to the
administration, said that the
group would work in conjunc
tion with the Students Againstf
White Racism where there
were steps of "real action."
The Tuesday night meeting
of the Students Against White
Racism, which was attended by
over 200 students adopted a
seven point program of areas
where the group could take ac
tion.
The executive committee was
given a week to develop recom
mendations on the group's re
sponses and on the structure of
the University. In addition, the
executive committee is to con
sider the group's relation to the
BSU.
The other five points are to be
considered by fifteen-member
committees. Sign-up sheets for
these committees are in the
ASSU office.
Topics to be studied are:
academic and non-academic re
form; university â€¢ community
relations; what to do as inV
dividuals; what to do as a
group; and financing.
The second white student
group urges that Stanford post
pone all construction projects
and that "the liberated funds bo
donated to the black communi
ties of Oakland or East Palo
Alto." The group considers these
projects "not vitally necessary
at this time."
Stanford should also encour
age "its alumni and other
friends" and "its students, fac
ulty and staff to redirect a large
fraction of their usual annual
contributions" to these areas,
the group added.
The group predicts that un
less announcement of such ac
tion is made within one week,
"fear and reaction (will) win
the day."
The group plans a meeting at
8 p.m. tonight in Tresidder, un
less there is a conflict with BSU
activities.
The "Student Involvement
Team of Stanford University"
planned Monday's colloquim and
distributed a primer on insti
tutional racism.
The groups feel Stanford has
the resources to take the lead
in correcting racial injustice in
America. Also involved in the
BSU demands, the group feels,
is the issue of Black Power.
