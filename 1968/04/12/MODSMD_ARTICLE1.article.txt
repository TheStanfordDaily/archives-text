# University, BSU End Conflict; Academic Council Offers Plan
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
The University yesterday
came to terms with the Black
Student Union, formulating,
with black students, a plan of
action that responds directly to
BSU demands.
"All our demands have been
met," shouted BSU co-chairman
Ken Washington to a waiting
crowd of sympathizers after the
Tresidder Union meeting.
"There's been no watering
down. Everything is up-tight."
Two hours after loaders of
the faculty and administration
met and resolved their differ
ences with representatives of
the BSU, the Academic Coun
cil unanimously endorsed a
comparable plan, including a
$1 million program to double
minority enrollment by 1969.
These developments brought
an end to four days of crisis and
pressure for the Stanford ad
ministration which began on
Monday when the BSU dramat
ically presented 10 demands to
remove "educational inequality"
in the university.
Asked if the University had
been coerced into meeting BSU
demands, Provost Richard Ly
man said, "The only coercion
was the shot fired last Thursday
that killed Martin Luther King."
Shortly after the meeting
with BSU leaders in Tresidder
Union Lyman issued a state
ment (see p. 2) incorporating
the plans worked out in the
meeting. University policies
will include:
• Increasing minority group
admissions to over 100 per class
after 1970.
• Releasing, no later than
April 30, data on admission and
rejection of minority group stu
dents for 1968-69.
• Employing "several" black
students as admissions aides to
help recruit black students.
Stanford will finance a recruit
ment pamphlet prepared by the
BSU.
• Admitting ten "marginal"
minority group students for
1968-69, asking the BSU to as
sist in recruiting them, arrang
ing a tutorial program, and
promising the BSU it would be

consulted before any marginal
students are dismissed.
• Creating the new position of
Coordinator of Intergroup rela
tions. The BSU will help select
him. Working "with" Associate
Provost Robert Rosenzweig. his
responsibilities would include
liason with the BSU.
• Increasing grants as op
posed to loans for to aid minori
ty group students.
• Establishing a Human Rela
tions Commission. (This was an
nounced earlier in the week.)
• Increasing the participation
of minority group students in
the process of selecting students
for admission beyond next
year's "marginal" program, in
cluding appointing a qualified
specialist in this field to the ad
missions staff.
• Intensifying efforts to re
cruit minority group employees,
particularly faculty members.
Lyman's statement includes
specific plans for implement
ing these broad policies. Both
general and specific plans cor
resi>ond to the BSU demands,
case by case.
At the Academic Council
meeting, Lyman told the faculty
that the agreement marks "the
start of a new era" at Stanford.
He also warned the faculty to
"prepare to stand fast when the
inevitable backlash comes from
society." During his spontaneous
talk to the faculty, Lyman noted
that participation of minority
group students in decisions that
affect their lives "had better be

a feature of many aspects in
American society, especially
higher education."
The BSU-University agree
ment was worked out in a con
ference room at Tresidder while
several hundred white and black
students held a "vigil" in the
back patio of the Union. These
students were there to support
the BSU and act with them if
the administration failed to meet
BSU demands.
The crowd had a carnival air
with card games played in
several locations. A phono
graph loudly filled the air with
popular songs.
The crowd took on ominous
potentialities in the minds of
some administrators and facul
ty members, who feared it
would provide the basis for civil
disobedience or violence if the
BSU called for such.
At 4:20 p.m., the meeting up
stairs concluded and Kenny
Washington, co-chairman of the
BSU, walked out onto the Tres
idder deck, raising the victory
sign. The crowd responded with
a sigh of relief and cheers.
While Washington spoke, the
administrators and faculty mem
bers he had just met with,
rushed to Dinkelspiel Auditori
um for the Academic Council
meeting.
The Council unanimously
voted these recommendations
presented by the Executive
Committee of the Council:
"A. Endorse the University's
commitment to the following

minimal goals, as announced by
President Sterling on April 9,
1968:
"1. An effort to double over
current enrollment "figures the
number of minority group stu
dents enrolled at Stanford by
the academic year 1969-70,
through an accelerated recruit
ment and financial aid program.
"2. A pilot program in 1968-
69 for at least ten minority
group students who do not meet
minimal Stanford admission re
quirements.
"3. An effort to double the pro
portion of minority group em
ployment at Stanford over the
next year, and to upgrade such
employment wherever feasible.
"B. Recommend that depart
ments of instruction include in
their regular teaching assign
ments provision for whatever
supplementary instruction is
necessary to carry out the pur
poses of the program."
Kenneth Cuthbertson, vice
president for finance, said the
University's commitment to
provide financial aid to all mi
nority group students admit
t»*d would cost $300,000 to
$500,000 additional by 1969.
President Wallace Sterling
said the total cost of this and
related commtiments might cost
as much as $1.2 million extra.
This compares with $200,000 that
was available for new programs
for the entire University this
year, he noted.

Details of the new University
policies respond one by one to
details in the BSU demands.
On the question of propor

versity responded by planning
to increase admissions but
said, "Proportional represen
tation, or any other form of
the quota system, in antithe
tical to the spirit of this uni
versity and adverse to the in
terests of the groups who arc

its supposed beneficiaries but
who end up being its vic
tims."
In the plan for marginal stu
dent admissions, Lyman states
that Prof. Robert Hess of the
Engineering School, "has agreed
to work with a task force on
this subject." He is ready to
meet with BSU representatives

liason with the BSU.
• Increasing grants as op
posed to loans for to aid minori
ty group students.
• Establishing a Human Rela
tions Commission. (This was an
nounced earlier in the week.)
• Increasing the participation
of minority group students in
the process of selecting students
for admission beyond next
year's "marginal" program, in
cluding appointing a qualified
specialist in this field to the ad
missions staff.
• Intensifying efforts to re
cruit minority group employees,
particularly faculty members.
Lyman's statement includes
specific plans for implement
ing these broad policies. Both
general and specific plans cor
resi>ond to the BSU demands,
case by case.
At the Academic Council
meeting, Lyman told the faculty
that the agreement marks "the
start of a new era" at Stanford.
He also warned the faculty to
"prepare to stand fast when the
inevitable backlash comes from
society." During his spontaneous
talk to the faculty, Lyman noted
that participation of minority
group students in decisions that
affect their lives "had better be

a feature of many aspects in
American society, especially
higher education."
The BSU-University agree
ment was worked out in a con
ference room at Tresidder while
several hundred white and black
students held a "vigil" in the
back patio of the Union. These
students were there to support
the BSU and act with them if
the administration failed to meet
BSU demands.
The crowd had a carnival air
with card games played in
several locations. A phono
graph loudly filled the air with
popular songs.
The crowd took on ominous
potentialities in the minds of
some administrators and facul
ty members, who feared it
would provide the basis for civil
disobedience or violence if the
BSU called for such.
At 4:20 p.m., the meeting up
stairs concluded and Kenny
Washington, co-chairman of the
BSU, walked out onto the Tres
idder deck, raising the victory
sign. The crowd responded with
a sigh of relief and cheers.
While Washington spoke, the
administrators and faculty mem
bers he had just met with,
rushed to Dinkelspiel Auditori
um for the Academic Council
meeting.
The Council unanimously
voted these recommendations
presented by the Executive
Committee of the Council:
"A. Endorse the University's
commitment to the following

minimal goals, as announced by
President Sterling on April 9,
1968:
"1. An effort to double over
current enrollment "figures the
number of minority group stu
dents enrolled at Stanford by
the academic year 1969-70,
through an accelerated recruit
ment and financial aid program.
"2. A pilot program in 1968-
69 for at least ten minority
group students who do not meet
minimal Stanford admission re
quirements.
"3. An effort to double the pro
portion of minority group em
ployment at Stanford over the
next year, and to upgrade such
employment wherever feasible.
"B. Recommend that depart
ments of instruction include in
their regular teaching assign
ments provision for whatever
supplementary instruction is
necessary to carry out the pur
poses of the program."
Kenneth Cuthbertson, vice
president for finance, said the
University's commitment to
provide financial aid to all mi
nority group students admit
t»*d would cost $300,000 to
$500,000 additional by 1969.
President Wallace Sterling
said the total cost of this and
related commtiments might cost
as much as $1.2 million extra.
This compares with $200,000 that
was available for new programs
for the entire University this
year, he noted.

Afee Brown, Kenneth Arrow and
Robert Rosenzweig. BSU repre
sentatives were Ken Washing
ton, Charles Countee, Frank Sat

Montle, and Dolores Mack.
James Gibbs, the only black pro
fessor at Stanford, also attend
ed.
Details of the new University
policies respond one by one to
details in the BSU demands.
On the question of propor
tional representation, the Uni
versity responded by planning
to increase admissions but
said, "Proportional represen
tation, or any other form of
the quota system, in antithe
tical to the spirit of this uni
versity and adverse to the in
terests of the groups who arc

its supposed beneficiaries but
who end up being its vic
tims."
In the plan for marginal stu
dent admissions, Lyman states
that Prof. Robert Hess of the
Engineering School, "has agreed
to work with a task force on
this subject." He is ready to
meet with BSU representatives
immediately.
The University yesterday
came to terms with the Black
Student Union, formulating,
with black students, a plan of
action that responds directly to
BSU demands.
"All our demands have been
met," shouted BSU co-chairman
Ken Washington to a waiting
crowd of sympathizers after the
Tresidder Union meeting.
"There's been no watering
down. Everything is up-tight."
Two hours after loaders of
the faculty and administration
met and resolved their differ
ences with representatives of
the BSU, the Academic Coun
cil unanimously endorsed a
comparable plan, including a
$1 million program to double
minority enrollment by 1969.
These developments brought
an end to four days of crisis and
pressure for the Stanford ad
ministration which began on
Monday when the BSU dramat
ically presented 10 demands to
remove "educational inequality"
in the university.
Asked if the University had
been coerced into meeting BSU
demands, Provost Richard Ly
man said, "The only coercion
was the shot fired last Thursday
that killed Martin Luther King."
Shortly after the meeting
with BSU leaders in Tresidder
Union Lyman issued a state
ment (see p. 2) incorporating
the plans worked out in the
meeting. University policies
will include:
• Increasing minority group
admissions to over 100 per class
after 1970.
• Releasing, no later than
April 30, data on admission and
rejection of minority group stu
dents for 1968-69.
• Employing "several" black
students as admissions aides to
help recruit black students.
Stanford will finance a recruit
ment pamphlet prepared by the
BSU.
• Admitting ten "marginal"
minority group students for
1968-69, asking the BSU to as
sist in recruiting them, arrang
ing a tutorial program, and
promising the BSU it would be

consulted before any marginal
students are dismissed.
• Creating the new position of
Coordinator of Intergroup rela
tions. The BSU will help select
him. Working "with" Associate
Provost Robert Rosenzweig. his
responsibilities would include
liason with the BSU.
• Increasing grants as op

meeting.
The Council unanimously
voted these recommendations
presented by the Executive
Committee of the Council:
"A. Endorse the University's
commitment to the following

minimal goals, as announced by
President Sterling on April 9,
1968:
"1. An effort to double over
current enrollment "figures the
number of minority group stu
dents enrolled at Stanford by
the academic year 1969-70,
through an accelerated recruit
ment and financial aid program.
"2. A pilot program in 1968-
69 for at least ten minority
group students who do not meet
minimal Stanford admission re
quirements.
"3. An effort to double the pro
portion of minority group em
ployment at Stanford over the
next year, and to upgrade such
employment wherever feasible.
"B. Recommend that depart
ments of instruction include in
their regular teaching assign
ments provision for whatever
supplementary instruction is
necessary to carry out the pur
poses of the program."
Kenneth Cuthbertson, vice
president for finance, said the
University's commitment to
provide financial aid to all mi
nority group students admit
t»*d would cost $300,000 to
$500,000 additional by 1969.
President Wallace Sterling
said the total cost of this and
related commtiments might cost
as much as $1.2 million extra.
This compares with $200,000 that
was available for new programs
for the entire University this
year, he noted.

ing with the BSU were: Richard
Lyman, Herbert Packer, Ken
neth Cuthbertson, Robert Mc-
Afee Brown, Kenneth Arrow and
Robert Rosenzweig. BSU repre
sentatives were Ken Washing
ton, Charles Countee, Frank Sat
terwhite, Warren Hayman, Mary
Montle, and Dolores Mack.
James Gibbs, the only black pro
fessor at Stanford, also attend
ed.
Details of the new University
policies respond one by one to
details in the BSU demands.
On the question of propor
tional representation, the Uni
versity responded by planning
to increase admissions but
said, "Proportional represen
tation, or any other form of
the quota system, in antithe
tical to the spirit of this uni
versity and adverse to the in
terests of the groups who arc

its supposed beneficiaries but
who end up being its vic
tims."
In the plan for marginal stu
dent admissions, Lyman states
that Prof. Robert Hess of the
Engineering School, "has agreed
to work with a task force on
this subject." He is ready to
meet with BSU representatives
immediately.
The University yesterday
came to terms with the Black
Student Union, formulating,
with black students, a plan of
action that responds directly to
BSU demands.
"All our demands have been
met," shouted BSU co-chairman
Ken Washington to a waiting
crowd of sympathizers after the
Tresidder Union meeting.
"There's been no watering
down. Everything is up-tight."
Two hours after loaders of
the faculty and administration
met and resolved their differ
ences with representatives of
the BSU, the Academic Coun
cil unanimously endorsed a
comparable plan, including a
$1 million program to double
minority enrollment by 1969.
These developments brought
an end to four days of crisis and
pressure for the Stanford ad
ministration which began on
Monday when the BSU dramat
ically presented 10 demands to
remove "educational inequality"
in the university.
Asked if the University had
been coerced into meeting BSU
demands, Provost Richard Ly
man said, "The only coercion
was the shot fired last Thursday
that killed Martin Luther King."
Shortly after the meeting
with BSU leaders in Tresidder
Union Lyman issued a state
ment (see p. 2) incorporating
the plans worked out in the
meeting. University policies
will include:
• Increasing minority group
admissions to over 100 per class
after 1970.
• Releasing, no later than
April 30, data on admission and
rejection of minority group stu
dents for 1968-69.
• Employing "several" black
students as admissions aides to
help recruit black students.
Stanford will finance a recruit
ment pamphlet prepared by the
BSU.
• Admitting ten "marginal"
minority group students for
1968-69, asking the BSU to as
sist in recruiting them, arrang
ing a tutorial program, and
promising the BSU it would be

consulted before any marginal
students are dismissed.
• Creating the new position of
Coordinator of Intergroup rela
tions. The BSU will help select
him. Working "with" Associate
Provost Robert Rosenzweig. his
responsibilities would include
liason with the BSU.
• Increasing grants as op
posed to loans for to aid minori
ty group students.
• Establishing a Human Rela
tions Commission. (This was an
nounced earlier in the week.)
• Increasing the participation
of minority group students in
the process of selecting students
for admission beyond next
year's "marginal" program, in
cluding appointing a qualified
specialist in this field to the ad
missions staff.
• Intensifying efforts to re
cruit minority group employees,
particularly faculty members.
Lyman's statement includes
specific plans for implement
ing these broad policies. Both
general and specific plans cor
resi>ond to the BSU demands,
case by case.
At the Academic Council
meeting, Lyman told the faculty
that the agreement marks "the
start of a new era" at Stanford.
He also warned the faculty to
"prepare to stand fast when the
inevitable backlash comes from
society." During his spontaneous
talk to the faculty, Lyman noted
that participation of minority
group students in decisions that
affect their lives "had better be

a feature of many aspects in
American society, especially
higher education."
The BSU-University agree
ment was worked out in a con
ference room at Tresidder while
several hundred white and black
students held a "vigil" in the
back patio of the Union. These
students were there to support
the BSU and act with them if
the administration failed to meet
BSU demands.
The crowd had a carnival air
with card games played in
several locations. A phono
graph loudly filled the air with
popular songs.
The crowd took on ominous
potentialities in the minds of
some administrators and facul
ty members, who feared it
would provide the basis for civil
disobedience or violence if the
BSU called for such.
At 4:20 p.m., the meeting up
stairs concluded and Kenny
Washington, co-chairman of the
BSU, walked out onto the Tres
idder deck, raising the victory
sign. The crowd responded with
a sigh of relief and cheers.
While Washington spoke, the
administrators and faculty mem
bers he had just met with,
rushed to Dinkelspiel Auditori

James Gibbs, the only black pro
fessor at Stanford, also attend
ed.
Details of the new University
policies respond one by one to
details in the BSU demands.
On the question of propor
tional representation, the Uni
versity responded by planning
to increase admissions but
said, "Proportional represen
tation, or any other form of
the quota system, in antithe
tical to the spirit of this uni
versity and adverse to the in
terests of the groups who arc

its supposed beneficiaries but
who end up being its vic
tims."
In the plan for marginal stu
dent admissions, Lyman states
that Prof. Robert Hess of the
Engineering School, "has agreed
to work with a task force on
this subject." He is ready to
meet with BSU representatives
immediately.
The University yesterday
came to terms with the Black
Student Union, formulating,
with black students, a plan of
action that responds directly to
BSU demands.
"All our demands have been
met," shouted BSU co-chairman
Ken Washington to a waiting
crowd of sympathizers after the
Tresidder Union meeting.
"There's been no watering
down. Everything is up-tight."
Two hours after loaders of
the faculty and administration
met and resolved their differ
ences with representatives of
the BSU, the Academic Coun
cil unanimously endorsed a
comparable plan, including a
$1 million program to double
minority enrollment by 1969.
These developments brought
an end to four days of crisis and
pressure for the Stanford ad
ministration which began on
Monday when the BSU dramat
ically presented 10 demands to
remove "educational inequality"
in the university.
Asked if the University had
been coerced into meeting BSU
demands, Provost Richard Ly
man said, "The only coercion
was the shot fired last Thursday
that killed Martin Luther King."
Shortly after the meeting
with BSU leaders in Tresidder
Union Lyman issued a state
ment (see p. 2) incorporating
the plans worked out in the
meeting. University policies
will include:
• Increasing minority group
admissions to over 100 per class
after 1970.
• Releasing, no later than
April 30, data on admission and
rejection of minority group stu
dents for 1968-69.
• Employing "several" black
students as admissions aides to
help recruit black students.
Stanford will finance a recruit
ment pamphlet prepared by the
BSU.
• Admitting ten "marginal"
minority group students for
1968-69, asking the BSU to as
sist in recruiting them, arrang
ing a tutorial program, and
promising the BSU it would be

consulted before any marginal
students are dismissed.
• Creating the new position of
Coordinator of Intergroup rela
tions. The BSU will help select
him. Working "with" Associate
Provost Robert Rosenzweig. his
responsibilities would include
liason with the BSU.
• Increasing grants as op
posed to loans for to aid minori
ty group students.
• Establishing a Human Rela
tions Commission. (This was an
nounced earlier in the week.)
• Increasing the participation
of minority group students in
the process of selecting students
for admission beyond next
year's "marginal" program, in
cluding appointing a qualified
specialist in this field to the ad
missions staff.
• Intensifying efforts to re
cruit minority group employees,
particularly faculty members.
Lyman's statement includes
specific plans for implement
ing these broad policies. Both
general and specific plans cor
resi>ond to the BSU demands,
case by case.
At the Academic Council
meeting, Lyman told the faculty
that the agreement marks "the
start of a new era" at Stanford.
He also warned the faculty to
"prepare to stand fast when the
inevitable backlash comes from
society." During his spontaneous
talk to the faculty, Lyman noted
that participation of minority
group students in decisions that
affect their lives "had better be

a feature of many aspects in
American society, especially
higher education."
The BSU-University agree
ment was worked out in a con
ference room at Tresidder while
several hundred white and black
students held a "vigil" in the
back patio of the Union. These
students were there to support
the BSU and act with them if
the administration failed to meet
BSU demands.
The crowd had a carnival air
with card games played in
several locations. A phono
graph loudly filled the air with
popular songs.
The crowd took on ominous
potentialities in the minds of
some administrators and facul
ty members, who feared it
would provide the basis for civil
disobedience or violence if the
BSU called for such.
At 4:20 p.m., the meeting up
stairs concluded and Kenny
Washington, co-chairman of the
BSU, walked out onto the Tres
idder deck, raising the victory
sign. The crowd responded with
a sigh of relief and cheers.
While Washington spoke, the
administrators and faculty mem
bers he had just met with,
rushed to Dinkelspiel Auditori
um for the Academic Council
meeting.
The Council unanimously
voted these recommendations
presented by the Executive
Committee of the Council:
"A. Endorse the University's
commitment to the following

minimal goals, as announced by
President Sterling on April 9,
1968:
"1. An effort to double over
current enrollment "figures the
number of minority group stu
dents enrolled at Stanford by
the academic year 1969-70,
through an accelerated recruit
ment and financial aid program.
"2. A pilot program in 1968-
69 for at least ten minority
group students who do not meet
minimal Stanford admission re
quirements.
"3. An effort to double the pro
portion of minority group em
ployment at Stanford over the
next year, and to upgrade such
employment wherever feasible.
"B. Recommend that depart
ments of instruction include in
their regular teaching assign
ments provision for whatever
supplementary instruction is
necessary to carry out the pur
poses of the program."
Kenneth Cuthbertson, vice
president for finance, said the
University's commitment to
provide financial aid to all mi
nority group students admit
t»*d would cost $300,000 to
$500,000 additional by 1969.
President Wallace Sterling
said the total cost of this and
related commtiments might cost
as much as $1.2 million extra.
This compares with $200,000 that
was available for new programs
for the entire University this
year, he noted.
