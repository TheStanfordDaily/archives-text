# The 						Washington Merry-Go-Round
## Gun Lobby Still Blocks Law 
### Drew Pearson 
WASHINGTON — The nation
found out in 1963 that it would
take more than the rifle slaying
of a beloved President to over
ride the powerful gun lobby on
Capitol Hill. Now the shooting
of a world-respected civil rights
leader and the whine of sniper
bullets across the country still
have failed to budge gun-control
legislation loose from the Con
gressional snares.

More moving than the mem
ory of President John F. Ken
nedy and the Rev. Martin Luther
King, apparently, has been the
lobbying of the National Rifle
Association which, for six years,
has blocked every move on Capi
tol Hill to curb the indiscrimi
nate sale of firearms.
Only a few hours before Dr.
King was gunned down, th
Senate Judiciary Committee
again rejected legislation that
would have banned the inter
state mail-order sale of rifles,
shotguns and hand guns.
An attempt to apply the ban
to the sale of hand guns alone,
however, ended in a 6-6 tie. This
left the outcome up to the
absentees, who voted the next
day for the restrictions on pis
tols.
Meanwhile, th" gun lobby has
started an ugly whispering cam
paign that the gun control bill
would prevent white people
from buying weapons to defend
their homes against Negro riot
ers. The truth is that the rioters,
with rare exception, didn't at
tack the homes of their white
neighbors.
Furthermore, the bill that
President Johnson is pushing
wouldn't interfere at all with
the right of law-abiding citi
zens to purchase guns. It would
prohibit the shipment of hand
guns across state lines to any
one but legitimate dealers. In
the case of rifles and shotguns,
a private customer could make
a purchase out of state provided
he pick up the gun in person.
Cops Are Learning
WASHINGTON — Some les
sons regarding police training
can be drawn from the rioting
following the assassination of
Martin Luther King.
Atlanta, Ga., under liberal but
tough Police Chief Herbert Jen
kins, had no riots. Twenty years
ago Jenkins began integrating
the Atlanta police, and has
Negro cops patroling Negro sec
tions of his city. But if looting
or rioting starts, they are under
strict orders to stand in front
of any broken window with a
shotgun and shoot looters.
Another city which went un
scathed was Philadelphia under
Police Chief Frank Rizzo, one
of the toughest cops in the USA.
Philadelphia police are well in
tegrated and have been for some
time.
On the other hand, Washing
ton, D.C., where the police were

under instructions not to fire at
looters, suffered blocks of de
struction, as did Baltimore,
where a similar order was in
force. Under the circumstances,
they did a superb job. But loot
ers saw the police were not re
taliating as they pillaged down
town stores and the looting in
creased. It was impossible for
the police to arrest more than
the ringleaders.
Washington and Baltimore
were both handicapped by two
factors: ill lack of early po
lice integration: and (2> report
ed instructions of black power
leaders to make these cities,
along with Chicago, the chief tar
gets in the nation.
In the nation's capital, form
er Police Chief Robert Murray
had a strict policy of hiring
no Negroes. His successors hav •
changed that policy, and Com
missioner Patrick Murphy ha c
been hiring and promoting well
qualified Negroes as rapidly as
possible.
Assassination Changed Plans
Both cities, however, suffered
from the black power advocates
of violence. It's now learned
that the original schedule for
burning the capital was June
18-19. it was also planned that,
after federal troops had moved
into Washington, black terrorists
would move on to Baltimore
before troops could get there.
The target date was stepped
up from June to April after
King's assassination. It's signi
ficant that Baltimore was quit''
peaceful during the first two
days of rioting in Washington.
Then it flared even more
viciously.
Also significant is the fact
that some of the most determin
ed looters in Washington were
government employees. D.C.
judges who sat all night proces
sing the 4,000 arrested looters
were flabbergasted at the fact
that a predominant number
worked for the government.
What the Negro world will be
waiting to see is whether these
looters lose their government
jobs. If they don't, it will be a
signal for more looting in the
future.
A great majority of Negroes
in Washington are bitter over
the looting. The looters consti
tuted a very small percentage of
the Negro population. Washing
ton was considered a model city
until last week's riots broke
out. Therefore the Negro pop

ulation will watch with great
interest to what happens to the
government employees who
flouted the government which
employed thorn.
