## Blacks Deserve White Help 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Miss Savery (Letter to Editor,
April 10) is welcome to the
opinion that whites should not
be "groveling at the feet of the
Negro community," or forming
a White Student Union to "get
on the band wagon" to secure
implementation of the BSU de
mands. I would submit, however,
that white students must learn
to listen and respond creatively
to demands by blacks. . . .
The group which is now call
ed "Students Against White Ra
cism" is not set up as a cathar
sis or merely as a support for
the demands of the BSU. Many
of its members are there pri
marily because they see an ur
gent need to use the White
Power they have in their uni
versity and home community to
bring about changes in the insti
tutions and individuals (includ
ing themselves) which have
kept blacks groveling and have
excluded them from bandwagons
for too long. . . .

Rumbold And Reeves
Defended Against BSU
Editor, The Daily:
We abhor the attack upon the
characters of "administrators
Reeves and Rumbold" of the
Stanford-in-Britain campus by
the instigators of the Black
Students' "demands".
We believe that this Univer
sity is extremely fortunate in
having as qualified a man as Dr.
Rumbold, whose experiences
with the Foreign Office include
advising and assisting the emer
ging black governments of East
Africa, as an administrator for
a bunch of American students.
Mr. Reeves, who is not an ad
ministrator, is another valuable

asset to the Britain experience,
although his prime function
comes in manning the Harlax
ton Manor pub, hardly a den
of racial discrimination and
bigotry.
Having recently returned from
six months at the Britain cam
pus, we were certainly not
aware of any "continuing blat
ant and overt discriminatory
acts" on the part of these two
men, and we strongly feel that
certain hypersensitive indivi
duals knowingly or unknowing
ly are using their black skin as
an unapproachable shield for
covering simple personality con
flicts. . .
