Roger Hilsman, formerly ol the
State Department and now of Colum
bia University, is widely considered to
be one of the nation's leading author
ities on foreign affairs and interna
tional politics.
His recent book, To Move a Nation,
received high praise from some re
viewers and condemnation from oth
ers. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch call
ed it"the most detailed, factual in
dictment of the Johnson Administra
tion war policy yet to be written by
someone with inside knowledge."
'Crisis Manager'
John McDermott, writing in the
New York Review of Books, called it
a "portrayal and a defense of liberal,
'political', intelligent and responsible
(cold war) Crisis Managers ,"and went
on to say "the whole significance of
the Crisis Manager system is that
they are—as a class—a perpetual con
spiracy against the right of the pub
lie to self-government."
Hilsman's gained inside knowledge
on America's foreign policy while As
sistant Secretary of State during the
Kennedy Administration. When John
son became President, Hilsman sens
ed a shift from "political" to "mili
tary" strategy and left government to
return to teaching.
Hilsman's direct experience in
Southeast Asia dates back to World
War 11. A 1943 graduate of West Point,
he served with Merrill's Marauders
in Burma, and later commanded his
own OSS battalion behind enemy lines
there. In 1945 he became assistant
chief of Far East intelligence opera
tions at OSS headquarters in Wash
ington.
In 1946 he moved to the Central In

telligence Agency as assistant to th<~>
executive officer. From 1950 to 1952
he was a planning officer for NATO
affairs in London, then worked one
year in the international politics
branch of the U.S. European Com
mand headquarters. He resigned that
post in 1953.
In the meantime, Hilsman had got
ten his Ph.D. from Yale, and after
leaving the government, he went to
teach international affairs at Johns
Hopkins University. He was" also a
research associate at Princeton's Cen
ter for International Studies, and he
lectured at Columbia University.
At the same time, he served as chief
of the foreign affairs division of the
Library of Congress legislative refer
ence service, and later became deputy
director for research there. He has
also lectured at the National, Army
and Navy War Colleges.
When Hilsman resigned from the
State Department in 19(14, he said he
was "not quarelling" with Administra
tion policy, although the New York
Times reported he "is thought to have
opposed extension of the war into
North Vietnam."
Split \Vith White House
Hilsman's recent book reveals, how
ever, how wide the split was between
his views and those prevailing in the
White House.
In 19fi5, Hilsman appeared on tele
vision to say American bombing pol
icy over North Vietnam was intended
only to "force Hanoi to its knees."
Further, he said, there was "no hard
evidence" of large-scale North Viet
namese presence in the South before
February 19(35, after the United States
began to bomb the North.

Clifford P. Case, the Republican
senator from New Jersey, surprised
many of his colleagues last fall when,
on the floor of the Senate, he accused
the President of creating a "crisis of
confidence."
The President, he said, had "mis
used and perverted" the Tonkin Gulf
resolution which permitted him to
send air strikes against North Viet
nam.
One of his fellow senators then con
demned him for giving aid and com
fort to the enemy.
Recently, when the Secretary of
State was being questioned by the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
of which Case is a member, Case
again escalated his criticism of Amer
ican war policy, which only a year
earlier he said he "generally support
ed.
Long a champion of civil rights,
bipartisan foreign policy and high
ethical standards in politics, Case has
represented New Jersey in Congress
since 1945. From then up to 1953, he
served in the House of Representa
tives.
In 1954 he was elected to the Senate
in the closest Senate race in New Jer
sey history. The one year in between,
he was president of the Fund for the
Republic.
Congress In 1942
Case trained as a lawyer at Colum
bia University after graduating from
Rutgers in 1925. For 11 years he was
an associate with a New York law
firm, then he entered politics—on a
small scale at first, serving four years
on the Rahway, New Jersey. Common
Council. In 1942 he ran for Congress
and was elected.

His strong record on civil rights
stood with him through his Senate
years, which began in 1955. Case's
stand on the Vietnam war had been
somewhat more equivocal. When run
ning for the Senate in 1966, he was
considered a "dawk," who "generally
agreed" with the "broad objectives"
of President Johnson's policy, but add
ed, "I reserve my right and duty to
criticize the President" on certain spe
cific policies.
Following his reelection, and as
1967 wore on, Case became more and
more critical of those certain specific
policies. He expressed skepticism of
the general election held in South
Vietnam. And in October he told the
Senate that the Administration had
used "a heavy hand" in attempting to
stifle criticisms of Vietnam policies.
Criticizes Hershey
In January, Case was openly criti
cal of Selective Service Director Gen.
Lewis B. Hershey. He said Hershey's
directive that draft obstructors be re
classified I-A violated free speech.
"Those who violate the law should
certainly be prosecuted," he said, "but
the penalties should be those pre
scribed by law and should be imposed
by the courts after trial, not by a
draft board."
Following President Johnson's
speech announcing his decision not. to
seek reelection, Case praised the
President's courage, but renewed his
attacks on current war policy:
"The time has come, I believe, for
that change in American policy which
will permit the South Vietnamese to
choose among the alternatives to the
only future that the mushrooming
American presence promises: the
devastation of their country."

David Schoenbrun has reported
many of the most important events
in modern history.
Utilizing nearly every form of com
munication, the award-winning cor
respondent covered the turning points
of World War II; the post-war crea
tion of the Marshall Plan, the Atlantic
Alliance and the Common Market; the
return to power of Charles deGaullc;
the Kennedy administration and as
sassination; and the 1964 election.
Schoenbrun gained wide fame last
year when he obtained a visa to Ha
noi. His subsequent reporting ap
peared in 150 newspapers around the
world, and his article "Journey to
North Vietnam" was the cover story
of the December 16th issue of Satur
day Evening Post.
Under-American Bombs
In that article Schoenbrun tells how
he and his wife rushed to crowded
shelters as American bombers raided
the towns they visited. Although
Schoenbrun met with many top North
Vietnamese officials, he was not able
to renew his friendship with Ho Chi
Minh who was a dinner guest of the
Schoenbruns in 1946 in France. He
and'his wife did receive personally in
scribed gifts (supposedly made from
pieces of downed U.S. planes) from
the aging leader who apologized for
being unable to welcome them to his
home.
". . . . when questioning North
Vietnamese officials," Schoenbrun
wrote, "I found their suspicion and
mistrust of Washington close to psy
chosis."
He concluded from his visit "that
an honorable settlement can be
achieved if half as much energy and
dedication is devoted to the search for

peace as to the prosecution of the
war, and if the issue is narrowed to
the future of Vietnam." Sehoenbrun
elaborates his feelings about the Vict
nam conflict in his latest book Viet
nam: How We Got In, How We Can
Get Out scheduled for release by Ath
eneum Publishers in several weeks.
Sehoenbrun is also well known for
his analyses of modern France. His
hook As France Goes (1957) was
named Best Book on Foreign Affairs
by the Overseas Press Club. He has
known Charles de Gaulle and followed
his career closely for 25 years, and his
The Three Lives of Charles de Gaulle
(1966) is a best seller. In addition,
Sehoenbrun is an authority on the
United Europe Movement and on the
continuing American effort to solidify
a partnership of the Atlantic nations,
a plan thwarted by de Gaulle.
Combat Correspondent
The journalist-historian's career be
gan as a French and Spanish teacher.
He served as Combat Correspondent
with the 7th U.S. Army and the First
French Army and was the first Amer
ican soldier to reach the Rhine, for
which he was decorated with the
Croix de Guerre and the Legion
d'Honneur. In 1947 he became Paris
Bureau Chief for CBS. During the
next 14 years his broadcasts from
Paris, including his daily "Your Man
in Paris," were widely followed.
In 1961 he was appointed Chief Cor
respondent and Bureau Chief in Wash
ington, D.C. His daily program "Da
vid Sehoenbrun Reporting" was the
highest rated special feature in radio.
Sehoenbrun was appointed to the
faculty of International Affairs at the
Graduate School of Columbia Univer
sity in 1967.
