In conjunction with the activities of
the Days of Concern, a vigil will ho
held in Memorial Church at 10 p.m.
this evening.
The planned program will not have
the religious orientation ot this fall's
peace vigil, according to Tim Buxton,
assistant to Dean Napier and one of
the organizers.
Beginning at 10 there will be two
films, "Voyage of the Phoenix" and
"Peace Pickets Arrested for Disturb
ing the Peace." For approximately an
hour after the conclusion of the films,
Reverend William Flanders from the
University of Maryland will lead the

group in folk singing.
At midnight Professor of Religion
Robert McAfee Brown will begin his
talk on "The Vocation of Protest" with
readings from passages on Good Fri
day and Passover.
Brown will deal with the crisis in
America due to the war in Vietnam
and the unrest in the cities, the theme
of Days of Concern's two day pro
gram.
The scripture passages are intended
to lend religious relevance to Brown's
discussion of the redemption of Pass
over and the suffering of Good Fri
day.
