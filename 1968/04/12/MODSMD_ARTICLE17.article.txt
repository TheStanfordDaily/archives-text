"Few periods in the history of the United States have been characterized by
the gravity and magnitude of national concern and uncertainty which now
exist. This concern and uncertainty pervades all American society; no aware
citizen can ignore its implications. Each of us is implicated; each is now —

alleviation of the problems which beset us."
