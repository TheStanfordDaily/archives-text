# To Begin In Fall
## English Lectures Approved 
### DAN SNELL 
The General Studies Commit
tee officially approved the trial
freshman English lecture cour
ses for next fall.
The three courses, to be taught
by professors with the help of
teaching assistants, will carry
four units credit in the fall and
five in the winter quarter. The
courses will be continuous over
the two quarters.
The English department had
requested that both courses be
rated at five units. But the com
mittee felt that a four-unit rat
ing would make the course easier
to fit into a freshman's schedule
without discouraging him from
taking a freshman seminar.
The committee also wanted
the total units earned in the
lecture courses to be equal to
the nine units earned in the
usual English 1, 2, and 3.
The courses to be offered
starting next fall are Themes in
Modern American Poetry, taught
by John Felstiner; Literature
and Technology, taught by David
Halliburton; and The Personal

Forms, taught by Kenneth
Fields.
The full lecture courses will
meet at least once a week, with
two meetings weekly in small
sections. But the organization
of the courses will be left up
to the professors in charge.
The English department may
initiate more courses of this
type for freshman English with
out further committee approval
In other action the commit
tee approved the expansion
of a course in elementary hu
man physiology to a two-quar
ter series, counting four units
each quarter to be offered next
winter and spring quarters.
The courses, to be called Gen
eral Studies 110 and 111, may
be taken to fulfill the General
Studies C-2 requirement.
The courses will have no lab
oratories, and a student will be
able to-take one without taking
the other.
The committee also began con
sideration of the recommenda
tions of the Associated Students
review board. The board sug
gested that the social science
requirement be allowed to be
filled by taking any two social
science courses from any two de

partments. Now a student must
take two numbered one social
science courses.
The General Studies Commit
tee, however, decided to write
letters to department heads in
the social sciences asking them
to recommend courses in their
departments for approval as
General Studies courses.
