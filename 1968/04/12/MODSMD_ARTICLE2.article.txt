# Residence Plans
## Housing Draw Set For May 
### PAT McMAHON 
Plans for implementing next
year's University housing pro
gram were announced last night
by Sally Mahoney, assistant
dean of students. The draw for
housing will be held during the
first two weeks in May.
There were several changes
in previously reported plans:
• No freshman will live on
the Row.
• Larkin and Lassen (Stern)
have switched designations; Lar
kin will become a freshman
men's house and Lassen will
be an integrated men's house.
• The present ATO house
will house upperclassman men
and tentatively will have a co
operative living arrangement.

• Adelfa (Lagunita) will be
come a coeducational Interna
tional House and focus on "Pop
ulation and Food Supply."
While frosh may sign fratern
ity bids today, Mahoney an
nounced, an April 4 meeting of
the Ad-Hoc Committee on Rush
affirmed that today "merely
represents the first date that
bids may be signed."
A man is free to defer a de
cision about a fraternity offer
until he knows more clearly
what other alternatives may be
come available to him through
the draw process. No closing
date has been placed on bid
signing," she said.
Miss Mahoney said that
there are 120 more spaces

available in the new housing
configuration than there were
last fall. She is "confident"
that all this year's freshman
men desiring University hous
ing will find space next fall.
Students who will be dis
placed by programs in their liv
ing groups will be assigned new
residences before the draw.
Those students then may par
ticipate in the draw for another
new residence or choose to re
main in the newly assigned resi
dence.
In other words, Paloma
women must move out to make
it a freshman women's resi
dence. They will be assigned to
another Florence Moore house
in which space will be available
next year. Then, they may par
ticipate in the draw for another
residence or remain in that new
residence.

Plans for implementing next
year's University housing pro
gram were announced last night
by Sally Mahoney, assistant
dean of students. The draw for
housing will be held during the
first two weeks in May.
There were several changes
in previously reported plans:
• No freshman will live on
the Row.
• Larkin and Lassen (Stern)
have switched designations; Lar
kin will become a freshman
men's house and Lassen will
be an integrated men's house.
• The present ATO house
will house upperclassman men
and tentatively will have a co
operative living arrangement.

• Adelfa (Lagunita) will be
come a coeducational Interna
tional House and focus on "Pop
ulation and Food Supply."
While frosh may sign fratern
ity bids today, Mahoney an
nounced, an April 4 meeting of
the Ad-Hoc Committee on Rush
affirmed that today "merely
represents the first date that
bids may be signed."
A man is free to defer a de
cision about a fraternity offer
until he knows more clearly
what other alternatives may be
come available to him through
the draw process. No closing
date has been placed on bid
signing," she said.
Miss Mahoney said that
there are 120 more spaces

available in the new housing
configuration than there were
last fall. She is "confident"
that all this year's freshman
men desiring University hous
ing will find space next fall.
Students who will be dis
placed by programs in their liv
ing groups will be assigned new
residences before the draw.
Those students then may par
ticipate in the draw for another
new residence or choose to re
main in the newly assigned resi
dence.
In other words, Paloma
women must move out to make
it a freshman women's resi
dence. They will be assigned to
another Florence Moore house
in which space will be available
next year. Then, they may par
ticipate in the draw for another
residence or remain in that new
residence.
There will be two open

Sunday, evenings April 21 and
28, from 6:30 to 10 p.m. so
students may visit houses
which will be available to
them.
