# Is Stanford's Concern Too Late?
## 
### MICHAEL COUZENS 
(Note: Senior religious studies
major Michael Couzens analyzes
the problems facing universities
in general, and Stanford spe
cifically, in these "Days of Con
cern." See related stories on
page 3.)

It may say more about uni
versities than it does about the
current epoch in human affairs
that today we inaugurate two
"days of concern." Concern was
a judicious posture in Mississip
pi Summer, 1964, or resumption
of bombing, 1966.
For American Agony, 1968,
one trembles to think it isn't
enough.
No university can abandon
its workaday life to prepare for
the millennium, and still keep
faith as a public servant. But
the revolutionary spirit of this
moment is a proclamation that
the old life, the old routine, will
never be the same.
Last week signified a majestic
and painful revision of priori
ties, through response and chal
lenge.
President Johnson's morator
ium on bombing and on his own
ambition was the response. To
gether with prospects for a
wide-open election, it generated
the first sense of hope.
Just maybe the democratic
process—when pressed—can
make its leaders talk sense.
Maybe, indeed, it was the few
dissidents of three or four
years ago who set in motion
discontent which finally faced
the President down.
Shaved and tidy campaign
workers who want to be "clean
for Gene" typify what political
response has done. Many almost
radicals, prepared to make a
final renunciation, now stuff en
velopes, pad the precincts, and
hope.
Tragedy in Memphis spoke
the challenge. The murder's bul
let made a simple statement:
"America, it is very, very late."
It exposed Vietnam as a gran
diose and unpardonable distrac
tion from matters of real im
portance. And it faced the new
hope with a problem which has
worsened since the march on
Washington in 1963. A nation
which would save others from
oppression requires all its cour
age and resources to save it
self.
The tragedy of Memphis and
of Vietnam, finally, is that the
reminder was necessary at all.
Students are not to be criti
cized for leaping from one cause
to another because it hapepns
to be au eOurant. Their decision
—and Dr. Martin Luther King's
—to intensify criticism of the

war was sound. The real danger
is that the sideshow will not be
dispensed with, even now that
our fundamental mission ap
pears before us.
For Johnie Scott, one student,
thoughtful, passionate, and
black, the death of Dr. King
was a problem. "Yesterday I
would have called him an Uncle
Tom. And now he's dead."
Johnie's invocation in Memorial
Church a week ago told of noth
ing so much as a personal
agony.
Perhaps it is not for whites
to understand. It rests with
them to recognize their own
agony, and accordingly to act.
For Congress, the death of
Dr. King is a plea to "reward
rioters," not because they are
rioters, but because other Am
ericans have for so long re
warded themselves at the
black's cost.
The ghettos, and the rural
poor, black and white, who are
tempted to move there "have a
dream, today."
For the presidential aspirants,
Memphis demands that the Re
port of the Commission on Civil
Disorders be more than a mine
of epigrams for campaign homi
lies. The merit of that report is
less in its programs to correct
injustice than in its placement
of blame.
Finally, for the University,
the events of last week call
for scrutiny of all its func
tions by all its members in a
new light. If days of concern
are the place to begin, the
programs today and tomorrow
are a reflection of sentiment
manifest already. One hopes
that they will help us to re
that they will help us to re
ally to rearm for the cleansing
and building which we grimly
acknowledge may be too late.

Stanford must prepare to
make searching criticisms of it
self, as a matter of its own sur
vival. How are its traditional
functions and purposes to be
understood in light of contem
porary crises?
A univeristy is a labyrinthine
complex of men, ideas and insti
tutions. Its avowed ogals are
public service, teaching and re
search. Its avowed method is a
disinterested search for truth,
and the proclaimation of that
truth in a "free marketplace of
ideas." Its media are word and,
to a lesser extent, deed.
The university is a part of the
society it has helped and hin
dered. It hires people, buys
toilet paper (from a firm much
criticized for racial discrimina
tion), sets The Stanford Daily

in type, provides police and fire
men, transplants hearts, pays a
minister's salary.
In this sense, while its ideo
logies are a check and a critic
ism on the world outside, it is
inextricably bound to that world
as a big business. Its sources
of support—the generous and
the Government—bind it in an
other way which suggests that
disinterested proclaimation of
truth is in constant potential
danger.
Current problems illustrate
this threat from two direc
tions. Radicals demand par
ticipation in decisions, and
leadership from present lead
ers. They want to see their
own stand taken at the top,
perhaps imposed by the top
on the whole university.
Accordingly, a draft test or
an interview with the CIA
should not be offered to mem
bers of the community. Contra
ceptives should be.
We describe his as a "threat"
becaust it makes the university
something other than it is to
day. Perhaps the time for that
has come.
In some cases, there is no
central authority which could
accede to the radical demand.
The President and Provost are
limited in what they can tell
the faculty to do. An issue must
therefore have the transcendent
importance to justify authori
ties enforcing the desired view
and thereby placing limits on
people's room to maneuver, or
even on free inquiry itself. Most
scholars would probably say
than no issue is that important.
But that is what makes radicals
radical.
The university is threatened
from another direction. Suppose
every screw in the university
It not turned to agitation for
social change. Suppose further
that the society so deteriorates,
with violence and race war, that
the now familiar response with
force of arms faces us with a
real police state.
There would be no more cam
pus violence as in Orangeburg,
South Carolina. Indeed there
would be no public debate of
racial problems allowed. Only
patrols, and the instruments of
repression. Can the university
function in that millieu?
One need not envision such a
calamity to see that the uni
versity is caught in the middle.
As Virgil K. Whitaker, Dean of
the Graduate Division, sug
gested in a speech in Denver
last month, a sacrifice of the
search for truth to the propa
ganda interests of social reform
would lead to attacks upon
tenure.
As odium fell on publicly-or
iented faculty, clamor would
come from those who want
them sacked. Suppression of
free discussion by the "new
left" as he put it, would gen
erate attacks upon tenure by
the "old right."
But if the university is caught
in the middle, the middle itself
is being called into question.
What is the real, operational
meaning of a free marketplace
of ideas in a time of crisis?
This challenge is well de
scribed by Michael Novak in a
recent Commonweal article.

The marketplace appears to
some students as "a vast con
sensus, a tradition that has been
appropriated with growing ex
tension and solidity since at
least the first days of the Now
Deal. That tradition is anti
metaphysical; it values compro
mise and adjustment; it prides
itself upon its diagnosis of Teal'
interests and its estimate of im
mediate 'realizable' possibilities;
it thinks itself, in a word, un
usually 'realistic.' "
Thus, Vice Provost Herbert
Packer responding; to hhuk
demands on Tuesday night.
The chasm between him and
the black students, concealed
by references to committees
and conciliation, is nothing
less than the gap l>etween two
forms of discourse. An Anglo-
Saxon legalism, empiricism
and "know-how" was face to
face on Tuesday with the
blunt honesty of passion and
yearning.
If the university is but an
appendage of the military-in
dustry- government consensus,
if professors are but acolytes
to the procession of extant
social values (or, in Novak's
phrase "like kept women of the
American way of life"), if uni
versity voices of dissent are
buried in norms of television,
opinion polls, and officialese,
then the winds of freedom come
close to being a pointless and
destructive travesty.
To counters can be made to
this position, even granting lis
extreme formulation. One calls
attention to the positive contri
butions of the university in
scholarship, law, medicine, pub
lic service, and so on. The other
asks of the critics, "What sort
of university should arise to
take the place of this one?"
The critics, as Novak says,
root their position in "gut re
actions . . . they feel indignant."
One suspects that, for them ado
quately to answer, their vision
would have to be verbalized,
formalized, and finally, alas,
pragmatized. The world of
workers which sustains a great
university has little time to give
to dreams. Between the dream
of a two-mile linear accelerator
and the government contract
which made it possible was ar
rayed a phlanx of organization
men.

If this much is a step to de
fining the problem, a few things
might be said about the univer
sity's response.
The logical escalation of con
cern, for reasonable men, is
study. Institutional rascism can
not be discussed without some
knowledge of both rascism and
the institution in question.
From where does an initiative
for study come?
Faculty study highly specified
aspects of the society at large
which are completely of their
own choosing. (That is not quite
right; social science is not, after
all, the sum total of the higher
learning.)
Administrators deal with so
ciety on a practical level, are
typically overworked, and there
fore tend to be inattentive to so
cial issues—until the issues be
gin to pinch the university.
For all the gallant exceptions
and, in national terms, progres

sive strides, this remains the
norm for members of the com
munity "over thirty."
Faculty neglect the sweep of
social change for the admirable
reason that their scholarly con
tributions require disinterested
ness, great energy, and time.
Administrators neglect it be
cause without their dedication
to the daily affairs of the uni
versity. that organism would
cease to function.
It has been the students,
then, who have made the uni
versity reflect upon itself as
moral force and social organ
ism.
Students who sat in at the
President's office to protest the
