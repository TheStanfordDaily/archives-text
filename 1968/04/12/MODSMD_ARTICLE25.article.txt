# The 						Impeachment Of Johnson: 1868
## 
### bruce merry 
"It is known that men ascend
to power over bloody steps.
Therefore the hour has come
when Congress owes it not only
to itself, but to the safety of the
country, to warn Mr. Johnson
that he cannot perpetuate his
power, and bring him as hastily
as the forms and spirit of law
will permit to trial and degrada
tion."
Abraham Lincoln's vice-presi
dent was a Democrat who turn
ed Republican to win election
on a war-time coalition, the in
famous Andrew Johnson. In 1868
a scandalised Republican Party
moved to have Lincoln's succes
sor in the White House impeach
ed "for high crimes and misde
meanours" in a debate that will
be re-enacted in Dinkelspiel at
8:00 p.m. tonight and Saturday.
The so-called "Theater of the
Congressional Record" is the
brain-child of John Kulsar, Pub
lic Speaking Professor in the
Business School and currently
active in Speech and Drama De
partment. The idea is to take a
significant debate verbatim from
written proceedings of Congress
and edit it down to proportions
viable for the live stage. "Im
peachment" is directed by se
nior Curt Keck.

As a dramatic form the Rec
ord is both powerful and capti
vating: at the back of the stage
is the Speaker's rostrum and
from it emanate those toneless
platitudes about "points of
order" and "questions of privi
lege" and whether "The Chair"
thinks this or that, which make
up the ritual of parliamentary
dialogue and provide a psycho
logical relaxation between the
icy colloquies of the contesting
speakers.
The members themselves are
arranged in the first six rows
of the center aisles of the thea
ter, Democrats on the left, Re
publicans on the right, with two
lecterns each, one at the front
and one at the far side. Here
the various debaters act out their
diatribes and apologies in a
perfect party-split, the Demo
crats apologizing and the Repub
licans inflamed with anger
against a President who turned
out his Secretary of War and
presented himself at his inaug
uration drunk.
Between the Speaker and the
members is the clerk who calls
the roll and recites resolutions;
completing the replica of the
House chamber is the Sergeant
at Arms who sits stolidly by
the Speaker to maintain order.

A number of the 100 students,
faculty and staff involved in
the production come from the
Stanford Repertory Theater, es
pecially Paul Richards in the
leading role of James Ashley,
"the gentleman from Ohio," who
in 18fi7 first attempted to launch
the House Judiciary Committee
against the hapless Johnson.
Opposite him, for the Demo
crats, is Kulsar himself as
Brooks of New York. Managing
the Republican cause is Keck,
providing the pole around which
to cluster Republican impeach
ment sentiments in fierce ten
sion with Brooks and the Demo
crats.
As a theatrical form the Rec
ord may have important reper
cussions. The present show will
be videotaped so that the theatei
can reach a wider audience; tour
ing it would clearly be imprac
ticable because of the large num
ber of people involved in the
production.
Although it has the sweeping
rhetoric of Greek tragedy, the
Record differs from Classical
drama in a very important re
spect: it deals not in personali
ties or stars but with fatal is
sues. On the placing of a coma
or the juxtaposition of two verbs

in the final resolution hang mil
lions of people and billions of
dollars.
The debate itself is a slow
and swaying progress to the
moment of truth in Greek style;
it is an accumulation of rea
sons, both good and bad, both
idealistic and partison, culminat
ing in the climax vote taking
â€” after which there is nothing.
Here the issues becomes now.
The black balls and the white
balls are counted.
The count is irrevocable and
of enormous consequences. And
here, according to Kulsar, is the
august and frightening power
of parliament laid bare; for these
patterns of debate will be fol
lowed again and again. The Rec
ord, like Thucydides, advises us
to learn from history, if only
to see how mistakes are made.
Thus the audience is construed

as the gallery of the time and
may even be castigated by the
Speaker for becoming too bois
terous. And as a gallery of wit
nesses the spectators are hand
somely played to in tonight's
show. The pace constantly chang
es, tightening and slackening
with the see-saw of dialogue,
always a continuum of speech,
always exploring new effects,
even if it is only a page reading
a telegram from a constituent
or the Speaker telling a sarcas
tic Congressman who wants to
know if there is an insane asy
lum for his honorable opponent
nearby that "the Chair thinks
not".
It is a fine and worthwhile
show. See it: for the small ad
mission charge you even get
to choose which side of the
House, Democrat or Republican,
you want to sit on.


Gordon Wickstroni introduces the House resolution which called
for the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson in 1868. The
Theater of the Congressional Record will present two performances
tonight and tomorrow night at 8 in Dinkelspiel.
