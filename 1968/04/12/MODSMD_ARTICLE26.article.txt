As our world plunges itself deeper and deeper into the muddy
abyss of its critical and chronic ails, there are certain happenings
in the Bay Area and shall take place as planned, seemingly un
touched by the surrounding chaos.
Conveniently, the San Francisco Symphony has skipped town
and is now in the early stages of a three-week whirlwind tour of
Japan. One may, however, don his black tie and journey to th<-
Opera House on May 1 for what promises to be a very gala wel
coming party and concert for the Beautiful People.
The Spring Opera, which had its opening earlier this week, will
present Mozart's The Abduction from the Seraglio tomorrow night
at 8:00 at the Opera House. On Tuesday, also at eight, Bizet's
Carmen (in English) will be performed for the first time.
At Winterland, appearing for the first time since an Eastern
tour will be Big Brother and the Holding Company. Also, Booker
T and the MG's and, direct from L.A., The Iron Butterfly. The show
starts at 8:30.
Coming in the near future (next week) will be a host of enter
tainment. The West Bay Opera will round out its 1967-1968 season
with Mozart's Bastien et Bastienne and Donizetti's II Campanello
next weekend. Also next weekend, San Francisco's Ballet 68 will
perform once again.
And, if you are in the mood for a party (of sorts) of a less formal
nature, The Committee celebrated its fifth birthday last week and
promises an excellent satirical review.
This weekend Stanford offers a wide variety of fine films. Tresid
der is showing Shoot the Piano Player by Truffaut, Friday evening,
and Pumpkin Eater, Saturday, both films will be shown at 7:30,
8:30, and 9:30. Also on Saturday Madera House will present Point
of Order, a documentary of the 1954 Army-McCarthy hearings.
Locally, now that the Academy Awards are over, the winning pic
tures are coming to the theaters. The Guild is showing Closely
Watched Trains, and In the Heat of the Night is at the Bijou.

night in The Nitery at 8. Presented by the MFA students and the
SRT acting fellows, the double bill includes Sean O'Casey's Pound
on Demand and William Saroyan's Hello Out There.
In 1868 Congress responded to its "time of crisis" by impeach
ing President Johnson (as in Andrew). The Theater of the Con
gressional Record, a unique form of drama, presents a reenactment
of that historical event. Performances are tonight and tomorrow
