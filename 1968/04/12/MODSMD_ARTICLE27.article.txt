# Tribe Trackmen Eye Upset Over UCLAns
## 
### 
Stanford's tracksters are re
grouping forces after taking a
humbling 109-36 loss to Wash
ington State last weekend, in
hope of battling a strong UCLA
team down to the wire Satur
day afternoon in Stanford Sta
dium. First varsity field event
is 1:15 p.m. and the first run
ning event at 1:55 p.m.
An extra attraction will be a
hotly contested dual meet be
tween the strong Stanford frosh
and the equally strong contin
gent from Santa Ana Junior Col
lege.
The past two years, the
Bruins have scored more than
100 points against the Indians
en route to compiling 17
straight collegiate dual meet
victories. Included in this total
were two victories over USC.
But fortunes change, and now
the Bruins are 2-2 on the sea
son, having lost to both Arizona
State (76-77) and Kansas (42-
102). Come through perform
ances in the last three events
last weekend carried the Bruins
to an upset over Oregon State
73-72.
The Bruins are not lacking
for top-flight performers but
do not iiave the depth they
possessed the last few years.
They have the only meet rec
ord holder to see action Satur
day, Gerald Lee, who went 1-9
in his specialty, the triple
jump, last year in L.A.
Events particularly strong for
the Uclans are the shot put
where three putters have 1968
marks over 55 feet, led by Steve

Marcus* 62-2 I A, and the sprints
where Harold Busby and John
Johnson have each run 9.6 this
year. Also on hand for his first
varsity campaign is one of the
country's premier decathlon per
formers, Russ Hodge, who is
scheduled to participate in all
three weight events, the two
sprints, and the 440 relay.
Last weekend at Pullman, the
Indians had the misfortune of
running head-on into what Pay
ton Jordan termed "At this time,
the second best team in the con
ference behind USC". Unfortu
nately for the Tribe cause, the
Cougars matched up its strength
with the Indians' and won the
close events besides taking

sweeps in both sprints, the shot
put, and the intermediate hur
dles.
The score was not truly in
dicative of the Indians' strength.
Senior Dick Warwick had a
lifetime best of 229-1 in the jave
lin but could fare no better than
fourth. Realizing such a throw
would have won every 1968
Tribe meet to date, one knows
that the cards were really
stacked against the Indians. Also
coming in for praise from Jor
dan was the running of sopho
more Jim Donart, who ran a 49.8
440, but he too finished fourth.
As he gains more experience
at this race, Jordan expects him
to further improve.


STANFORD MILKR — Greg
Brock may have his work cut
nut for him Saturday when the
Indians host UCLA. Bruin miler
George Husaruk was clocked in
4:07.6 earlier this year.

STANFORD MILKR — Greg
Brock may have his work cut
nut for him Saturday when the
Indians host UCLA. Bruin miler
George Husaruk was clocked in
4:07.6 earlier this year.
Stanford's tracksters are re
grouping forces after taking a
humbling 109-36 loss to Wash
ington State last weekend, in
hope of battling a strong UCLA
team down to the wire Satur
day afternoon in Stanford Sta
dium. First varsity field event
is 1:15 p.m. and the first run
ning event at 1:55 p.m.
An extra attraction will be a
hotly contested dual meet be
tween the strong Stanford frosh
and the equally strong contin
gent from Santa Ana Junior Col
lege.
The past two years, the
Bruins have scored more than
100 points against the Indians
en route to compiling 17
straight collegiate dual meet
victories. Included in this total
were two victories over USC.
But fortunes change, and now
the Bruins are 2-2 on the sea
son, having lost to both Arizona
State (76-77) and Kansas (42-
102). Come through perform
ances in the last three events
last weekend carried the Bruins
to an upset over Oregon State
73-72.
The Bruins are not lacking
for top-flight performers but
do not iiave the depth they
possessed the last few years.
They have the only meet rec
ord holder to see action Satur
day, Gerald Lee, who went 1-9
in his specialty, the triple
jump, last year in L.A.
Events particularly strong for
the Uclans are the shot put
where three putters have 1968
marks over 55 feet, led by Steve

Marcus* 62-2 I A, and the sprints
where Harold Busby and John
Johnson have each run 9.6 this
year. Also on hand for his first
varsity campaign is one of the
country's premier decathlon per
formers, Russ Hodge, who is
scheduled to participate in all
three weight events, the two
sprints, and the 440 relay.
Last weekend at Pullman, the
Indians had the misfortune of
running head-on into what Pay
ton Jordan termed "At this time,
the second best team in the con
ference behind USC". Unfortu
nately for the Tribe cause, the
Cougars matched up its strength
with the Indians' and won the
close events besides taking

sweeps in both sprints, the shot
put, and the intermediate hur
dles.
The score was not truly in
dicative of the Indians' strength.
Senior Dick Warwick had a
lifetime best of 229-1 in the jave
lin but could fare no better than
fourth. Realizing such a throw
would have won every 1968
Tribe meet to date, one knows
that the cards were really
stacked against the Indians. Also
coming in for praise from Jor
dan was the running of sopho
more Jim Donart, who ran a 49.8
440, but he too finished fourth.
As he gains more experience
at this race, Jordan expects him
to further improve.
