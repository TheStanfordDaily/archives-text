# Ferber: Resistance Alters White Class
## 
### 
Michael Ferber, one of those
indicted in Boston with famed
pediatrician Benjamin Spock
and Yale chaplain William
Sloane Coffin, said the Resis
tance was emerging as one of
the few white organizations that
could still talk to "black power
people."
"I'm not saying that this sum
mer isn't going to be hell, be
cause it is," he told a crowd
of 50 persons last night in Tre
sidder large lounge. "But at
least there are some whites who
are putting themselves on the
line the way the blacks are on
the line every day."
He said the Resistance was a
middle-class organization that
wants to subvert the middle class
and change it.
Ferber explained that the five
indicted in Boston would like
to fight the case on the issue of
whether the Vietnam war is
wrong and the draft illegal.
But he admitted that the
court would not be likely to
allow consideration of these
issues. The case will more like
ly be fought on First Amend
ment (freedom of speech)
grounds, he said.
The five have been indicted
for conspiracy, which Ferber
said does not necessarily involve
any "sneakiness." Ferber, a

Swarthmore graduate in Greek
now working on a Ph.D. in En
glish at Harvard, said that ety
mologically, conspiracy means
"a breathing together."
"That's what I was doing,"
he said. "But that's not a con
spiracy; that's community."
He called the conspiracy
charge absurd and said that all
he and the others indicted had
done was to "articulate a couple
of ideas."
Ferber said a year ago he had
applied for conscientious ob
jector status but had been de
nied it after going through much
red tape. "I felt very degraded,
very angry, and very tired," h *
said.
Last October Ferber said he
turned in his draft card, partly
to restore his self-respect.
For the white middle-class
student, turning in the draft
card is the best course, he said,
"as long as there is the barest
hope of a chance that turning
in the card will have some im
pact."
"We want to begin to movo
people by example rather than
by precept," he said.
Ferber attacked the draft and
the "channeling" effect of de
ferments as "not fundamentally
different from what happens in
totalitarian countries."

different from what happens in
totalitarian countries."
Michael Ferber, one of those
indicted in Boston with famed
pediatrician Benjamin Spock
and Yale chaplain William
Sloane Coffin, said the Resis
tance was emerging as one of
the few white organizations that
could still talk to "black power
people."
"I'm not saying that this sum
mer isn't going to be hell, be
cause it is," he told a crowd
of 50 persons last night in Tre
sidder large lounge. "But at
least there are some whites who
are putting themselves on the
line the way the blacks are on
the line every day."
He said the Resistance was a
middle-class organization that
wants to subvert the middle class
and change it.
Ferber explained that the five
indicted in Boston would like
to fight the case on the issue of
whether the Vietnam war is
wrong and the draft illegal.
But he admitted that the
court would not be likely to
allow consideration of these
issues. The case will more like
ly be fought on First Amend
ment (freedom of speech)
grounds, he said.
The five have been indicted
for conspiracy, which Ferber
said does not necessarily involve
any "sneakiness." Ferber, a

Swarthmore graduate in Greek
now working on a Ph.D. in En
glish at Harvard, said that ety
mologically, conspiracy means
"a breathing together."
"That's what I was doing,"
he said. "But that's not a con
spiracy; that's community."
He called the conspiracy
charge absurd and said that all
he and the others indicted had
done was to "articulate a couple
of ideas."
Ferber said a year ago he had
applied for conscientious ob
jector status but had been de
nied it after going through much
red tape. "I felt very degraded,
very angry, and very tired," h *
said.
Last October Ferber said he
turned in his draft card, partly
to restore his self-respect.
For the white middle-class
student, turning in the draft
card is the best course, he said,
"as long as there is the barest
hope of a chance that turning
in the card will have some im
pact."
"We want to begin to movo
people by example rather than
by precept," he said.
Ferber attacked the draft and
the "channeling" effect of de
ferments as "not fundamentally
different from what happens in
totalitarian countries."
