The only two remaining unde
feated teams in the Northern
California Lacrosse Association
and intense neighborhood rivals
will face off in a key game of
the season, when Stanford and
the Palo Alto Lacrosse Club
meet on the Stanford Lacrosse
field Saturday at 2 p.m.
The Palo Alto club is made
up of "old men"—too old, in fact
to be trusted—who are mostly
Stanford graduate students and
local business men. Many Palo
Altans have played more years
of Lacrosse than most Stanford
players have years in their
lives. They pride themselves as
the Establishment of western
Lacrosse, but were bumped
twice last year by the upstart
Stanford guerrilla tactics and
have been seething ever since.
The game, then, takes on the
proportions of a grudge match.
Stanford is the defending Nor-
Cal champion—Palo Alto was
the previous champion.
Though the game is rated a
toss-up, Palo Alto seems to
have the edge on previous
performance. They beat Ma
rin last weekend 19-3, while
Stanford was struggling with
San Francisco. Stanford beat
Marin earlier in the season by
a 10-4 count. -
Leader of the Palo Alto as
sault was Jim Bankus, a former
Williams star, who poured in a

phenomenal eight goals and as
sisted on three others. The ques
tion is what Bankus will be able
to do against Stanford's out
standing defense, who have not
let a team score that many
goals, let alone a single player.
Either Wade Killefer or Billy
Eakland will be on Bankus—the
secret is still under wraps—and
in either case, Bankus has not
seen an equivalent defenseman
this season.
The talent seems to measure
up evenly in the first major
game of the lacrosse season in
the west.
