## 24,500 Troops Called Up 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sec
retary of Defense Clark M. Clif
ford on Thursday called up
24,500 reservists, 10,000 of whom
will go to Vietnam under the
first announced reserve mobili
zation for the war.
It will bring the authorized
U.S. manpower ceiling there to
549,500, but Clifford said the
South Vietnamese Army is be
ing geared to take over the
major part of the fighting.
At the same time the new
defense chief indicated clearly
the administration is watching
the implications of its partial
halt to the bombing of North
Vietnam as well as the possi
bilities of a full cessation.
The reserve call-up affects 88
Army, Navy and Air Force Re
serve and Guard units in 34
states. The men are being noti
fied immediately to report to
duty within 30 days for up to 24
months' service.
• Rights Bill Signed
WASHINGTON (AP)—Presi
dent Johnson signed into law
the civil rights and open hous
ing bill Thursday in a White
House ceremony exactly one
week after the assassination of

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,
touched off looting and rioting
in slums across the land.
"Now with this bill, the voice
of justice speaks again," John
son told scores of civil rights
leaders, government officials,
and members of Congress who
crowded the East Room for the
ceremony.
The bill, on which the House
completed congressional action
Wednesday, makes it a federal
crime to interfere with anyone
trying to exercise his civil
rights.
When fully effective in 1970 it
will outlaw discrimination in the
sales and rental of 80 per cent of
the nation's housing units.
• Reds Retake Camp
SAIGON (AP)'—With the rest
of South Vietnam quiet, U.S. air
cavalrymen battled vainly
Thursday to reoccupy the Khe
Sanh outpost at Lang Vei,
where they marched in unop
posed the day before.
Three companies of the U.S.
Ist Air Cavalry Division had re
tired to a bivouac near Lang Vei
Wednesday night, possibly be
cause they found the Special
Forces camp a charnel house of

unburied bodies from the fierce
fighting there in February.
When the cavalrymen came
back in the morning as part of a
sweep to drive the North Viet
nam besiegers of Khe Sanh
back across the border they ran
into a storm of machine gun
and rifle fire.
They found at least a com
pany of North Vietnamese, pos
sibly 80 men, had occupied the
trenches and ruined bunkers of
Lang Vei during the night.
The cavalrymen pulled back,
and U.S. artillery and planes
blasted the camp that had been
left in ruins when North Viet
namese tanks and troops over
ran it Feb. 7.
• Peace Talks Delayed
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
United States balked Thursday
at a North Vietnamese proposal
for meetings in Warsaw, saying
it prefers a neutral site rather
than the capital of Communist
Poland.
The White House complained,
too, about what it portrayed as
Red efforts to score progaganda
points in the jockeying over
where to hold peace-talk preli
minaries.
And it invited Hanoi to re

spond instead to an earlier U.S.
proposition to get discussions
going in a non aligned locale
such as Burma, India, Indonesia
or Laos.
Warsaw was not finally ruled
out but the United States ob
viously will try hard for another
site.

of South Vietnam quiet, U.S. air
cavalrymen battled vainly
Thursday to reoccupy the Khe
Sanh outpost at Lang Vei,
where they marched in unop
posed the day before.
Three companies of the U.S.
Ist Air Cavalry Division had re
tired to a bivouac near Lang Vei
Wednesday night, possibly be
cause they found the Special
Forces camp a charnel house of

unburied bodies from the fierce
fighting there in February.
When the cavalrymen came
back in the morning as part of a
sweep to drive the North Viet
nam besiegers of Khe Sanh
back across the border they ran
into a storm of machine gun
and rifle fire.
They found at least a com
pany of North Vietnamese, pos
sibly 80 men, had occupied the
trenches and ruined bunkers of
Lang Vei during the night.
The cavalrymen pulled back,
and U.S. artillery and planes
blasted the camp that had been
left in ruins when North Viet
namese tanks and troops over
ran it Feb. 7.
• Peace Talks Delayed
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
United States balked Thursday
at a North Vietnamese proposal
for meetings in Warsaw, saying
it prefers a neutral site rather
than the capital of Communist
Poland.
The White House complained,
too, about what it portrayed as
Red efforts to score progaganda
points in the jockeying over
where to hold peace-talk preli
minaries.
And it invited Hanoi to re

spond instead to an earlier U.S.
proposition to get discussions
going in a non aligned locale
such as Burma, India, Indonesia
or Laos.
Warsaw was not finally ruled
out but the United States ob
viously will try hard for another
site.
• McCarthy Calls For
Guaranteed Income
BOSTON (AP) — Democratic

McCarthy Thursday night pro

to raise the standard of living
of the nation's poor.
The Minnesota senator's sug

speech prepared for an audience
at Boston University.
McCarthy flew to Boston from
Lincoln. Neb., where he told a

the site for proposed peace talks
"is in my judgment not particu

"The President said several

WASHINGTON (AP) — Sec
retary of Defense Clark M. Clif
ford on Thursday called up
24,500 reservists, 10,000 of whom
will go to Vietnam under the
first announced reserve mobili
zation for the war.
It will bring the authorized
U.S. manpower ceiling there to
549,500, but Clifford said the
South Vietnamese Army is be
ing geared to take over the
major part of the fighting.
At the same time the new
defense chief indicated clearly
the administration is watching
the implications of its partial
halt to the bombing of North
Vietnam as well as the possi
bilities of a full cessation.
The reserve call-up affects 88
Army, Navy and Air Force Re

duty within 30 days for up to 24
months' service.

WASHINGTON (AP)—Presi

the civil rights and open hous

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,

in slums across the land.
"Now with this bill, the voice
of justice speaks again," John

leaders, government officials,
and members of Congress who
crowded the East Room for the
ceremony.
The bill, on which the House
completed congressional action
Wednesday, makes it a federal
crime to interfere with anyone
trying to exercise his civil
rights.
When fully effective in 1970 it
will outlaw discrimination in the
