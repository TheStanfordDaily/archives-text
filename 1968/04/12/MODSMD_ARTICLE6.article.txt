# Academic Senate Approved Without Student Members
## 
### MARSH ALL SCHWARTZ 
The Academic Council approv
ed the charter of the Academic
Senate yesterday but left for
future determination the ques
tion of student representation.
The plan to have five students
as ex-officio members of the
group "came up really late in
the game," according to 11. Don

aid Winbigler, academic secre
tary to thr University.
|"At the time the Executive
Committee (of the Academic
Council) last considered this
matter, they had the impres
sion the ASSU leadership had
rejected the idea," he said.
"Therefore, the Executive
Committee had not had the op
portunity to consider it in detail
since LASSU passed its last res
olution on the subject," which
advocated student membership
in the group.
A resolution was passed, how
ever, asking the Executive Com
mittee to study this matter "and
work with the ASSU in devel
oping a specific proposal for stu
dent members, which would be
submitted later," YVinbigler said.
The charter allows for 53 rep
resentatives to be elected from
the various schools, plus 13 ex
officio members, including the
chancellor, president, provost,
dean of the graduate division,
dean of undergraduate educa
tion, the deans of the seven
schools, and the academic secre
tary.
Elections are expected to be
held before the end of the quar
ter, Winbigler said.
Humanities and sciences will
have 25 of the 53 voting mem
bers; eight members will be
from the School of Medicine,
nine from engineering, and
two each from the Graduate
School of Business and Schools
of Education, Law, and Earth
Sciences.

Also, one Senate member will
be elected by both SLAC and
the Food Research Institute.
In addition, one member will
come from a special constitu
ency, made up of members of
the Academic Council who do
not have an identification with
any particular school or depart
ment, and some who do have
such affiliation but also have
University-wide posts, like the
president, and provost.
The various constituencies will
meet separately to determine
the apportionment of their rep
resentatives. The School of Hu
manities and Sciences will meet
Monday at 4 p.m. today in the
physics tank.
Engineering will meet Tues
day in room 550 A. Tlie School
of Medicine will not meet un
til May beeause of various
professional meetings which
will be held between now and
then which would prevent
sonic professors from attend
ing.
One apportionment method
which the humanities and sci
ences people will consider is
dividing up the school into eight
groups, each one electing from
two to five representatives.
Officers of the Senate will be a
chairman, elected by the repre
sentatives, and a six-man steer
ing committee, consisting of the
chairman, four members elected
by the representatives, and one
ex-officio member, the president
or his designee.

the apportionment of their rep
resentatives. The School of Hu
manities and Sciences will meet
Monday at 4 p.m. today in the
physics tank.
Engineering will meet Tues
day in room 550 A. Tlie School
of Medicine will not meet un
til May beeause of various

One apportionment method
which the humanities and sci
ences people will consider is
dividing up the school into eight
groups, each one electing from
two to five representatives.
Officers of the Senate will be a
chairman, elected by the repre
sentatives, and a six-man steer
ing committee, consisting of the
chairman, four members elected
by the representatives, and one
ex-officio member, the president
or his designee.
The Academic Council approv
ed the charter of the Academic
Senate yesterday but left for
future determination the ques
tion of student representation.
The plan to have five students
as ex-officio members of the
group "came up really late in
the game," according to 11. Don

aid Winbigler, academic secre
tary to thr University.
|"At the time the Executive
Committee (of the Academic
Council) last considered this
matter, they had the impres
sion the ASSU leadership had
rejected the idea," he said.
"Therefore, the Executive
Committee had not had the op
portunity to consider it in detail
since LASSU passed its last res
olution on the subject," which
advocated student membership
in the group.
A resolution was passed, how
ever, asking the Executive Com
mittee to study this matter "and
work with the ASSU in devel
oping a specific proposal for stu
dent members, which would be
submitted later," YVinbigler said.
The charter allows for 53 rep
resentatives to be elected from
the various schools, plus 13 ex
officio members, including the
chancellor, president, provost,
dean of the graduate division,
dean of undergraduate educa
tion, the deans of the seven
schools, and the academic secre
tary.
Elections are expected to be
held before the end of the quar
ter, Winbigler said.
Humanities and sciences will
have 25 of the 53 voting mem
bers; eight members will be
from the School of Medicine,
nine from engineering, and
two each from the Graduate
School of Business and Schools
of Education, Law, and Earth
Sciences.

Also, one Senate member will
be elected by both SLAC and
the Food Research Institute.
In addition, one member will
come from a special constitu
ency, made up of members of
the Academic Council who do
not have an identification with
any particular school or depart
ment, and some who do have
such affiliation but also have
University-wide posts, like the
president, and provost.
