### 
Following yesterday's meeting
with the Blaek Student Union,
Provost Richard Lyman issued
this statement as the Univers
ity's response to BSU demands
on Monday.
The following points summar
ize the University's response to
the issue raised by the Black
Student Union:
1. The Sterling-Lyman state
ment of April 9 committed the
University to an effort to double
the number of minority group
students enrolled at Stanford by
the academic year 1969-70, a
level of about 350 students.
I shall urge upon my faculty
colleagues the need for further
increase beyond that date to
bring us in excess of 100 minor
ity group students for each en
tering class after 1970. These
efforts will canvass all potential
sources of minority group stu
dents and will include active
recruitment of students at jun
ior colleges. Proportional repre
sentation, or any other form of
quota system, is antithetical to
the spirit of this University and
adverse to the interests of the
groups who are its supposed
beneficiaries but who end up
being its victims.
2. Data on admission and re
jection of minority group stu
dents for 1968-69 are now in the
process of being compiled and
will be made public no later
than April 30. The form in
which they are published will in
volve the fullest possible dis
closure consistent with the priv
acy of the persons involved.
3. We want to work with
black students in recruiting
black students. We shall employ
several such students as admis
sions aides for that purpose as
work-study students. We invite
the Black Student Union to for
mulate a detailed plan for hir
ing admissions aides and to sub
mit it to the Dean of Admis
sions by April 19. We also in
vite the Black Student Union to
prepare a recruitment pamphlet
for distribution to .high school
counsellors and prospective ap
plicants.
4. The Sterling-Lyman state
ment of April 9 committed the
University to the admission for
1968-69 of at least ten "margin
al" minority-group students, of
whom at least five will be black.
We ask the Black Student Un
ion to assist in recruiting the
pool of students from which the
ten will be chosen and to advise
the Dean of Admissions on
making the choices.
We are taking immediate
steps to arrange a tutorial pro
gram and other necessary edu
cational supplements of the stu
dents who will be enrolled next
fall in this pilot program. Pro
fessor Robert Hess of the School
of Education has agreed to work
with a task force on this pro
ject. He is standing ready to
meet with Black Student Union
representatives to get this un
derway. Performance on stan
dard aptitude tests will not be
a condition for admission to
this program.
If questions arise about the
continuation of any strident in
the program, no student will be
dismissed from the University
without consultation with repre
sentatives of the Black Student
Union. Further details of the

program will be worked out in
consultation with the Black Stu
dent Union.
5. The University recognizes
the need for additional staff and
funds to mount the programs
described here and for other
purposes having to do with
inter-group relations at Stan
ford. I am constituting a search
committee consisting of Profes
sor James Gibbs, Mr. Joseph
Scroggs, the University's Di
rector of Personnel, and Assist
ant Provost Raymond Bacchetti
to find a suitable appointee for
the position of Coordinator of
Intergroup Relations whose re
spontibilities would include liai
son with the Black Student Un
ion and other minority groups.
We ask the Black Student Un
ion to designate one or more
of its members to act as con
sultants for this search. The
appointee or appointees will
work for the University with
Associate Provost Robert Rosen
zweig, the Human Relations
Commission, and other relevant
groups.
6. Financial aid policy for the
class entering in 1968-69 puts
virtually exclusive emphasis on
grants as opposed to loans for
minority group students. The
University is now seeking and
will continue to seek Federal
and other funds for financial
aid to minority-group students.
The voluntary response from
our own faculty and staff is im
pressive. In addition to gifts and
pledges already received, volun
teer committees are at work to
encourage gifts through contin
uing payroll deductions.
The University of course
stands ready to help minority
group students in ways other
than financial. We hope that in
the current discussions the
members of the Black Student
Union will clarify what they
mean by a "total commitment
to them in non-academic areas
as well as in the academic
ones."
7. The need for a mechanism
to deal with grievances is one
that has already been recog
nized by the creation of the new
Human Relations Commission.
All allegations of racial discrim
ination can and should be
brought to this Commission.
Complex legal questions are
raised by the definition of the
Commission's powers â€” espe
cially by the question of whether
it can be given the power to
compel testimony. Legal advice
on these questions is now being
sought and a definitive resolu
tion of the Commission's pow
ers will be announced as soon
as possible and not later than
Monday, April 22.
8. Minority group students
will be involved in the process
of selecting students for admis
sion, beginning immediately
with the pilot program for the
special admission of at least
ten "marginal" minority-group
students, referred to in point
four, and continuing with sub
sequent admissions.
The participation of minority
group students in the admis
sions process, through work
study employment and in other
ways, will be consistent with the
principle that the faculty of the
University has the ultimate re
sponsibility for admissions to

the University, subject only to
the authority of the Board of
Trustees. We intend to appoint
to the Admissions Staff a quali
fied specialist in this field and,
to that end, invite nominations
from minority-group students,
which should be submitted to
the Dean of Admissions.
The SES report on minority
group admissions has recently
been released for comment by
the University community. Its
recommendations remain sub
ject to revision. We hope that
minority-group students will
submit detailed comments on
this report to Professor Herbert
L. Packer, chairman of the SES
steering committee, from whom
copies of the report arc avail
able. These comments should be
in hand by the end of this
month.
9.The University is committed,
as the Sterling-Lyman state
ment of April 9 makes clear,
to an intensified effort to recruit
minority group employees. This
commitment specifically in
cludes faculty membens. We are
taking all possible steps, begin
ning at this afternoon's Aca
demic Council meeting, to enlist
the faculty's cooperation in
searching actively for minority
group candidates for faculty
positions.
The question of specific cur
ricular content calls for further
detailed discussion, involving
minority-group and other stu
dents, appropriate academic de
partments, and committees of
the Academic Council such as
the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education and the Com
mittee on General Studies.
