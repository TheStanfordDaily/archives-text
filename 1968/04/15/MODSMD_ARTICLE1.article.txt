# Med Students Face Possible Expulsion

### PAT McMAHON 
Twenty Medical School stu
dents who refused to sign their
Community Health final exam
Autumn Quarter have been told
to sign those exams or they
may face expulsion in June.
They twenty — a third of the
third-year students — refused to
sign their examination papers
because (hey "felt we couldn't
let this course be passed on to
another class without improve
ment," and were given "incom
plete."
An April 2 letter from Dr.
Bernard Nelson, assistant dean
of the Medical School for stu
dent affairs, informed the stu
dents of the unanimous decision
of the Student Standing and Pro
motions Committee April 1.
"... the Committee reiter
ates its belief that there are
appropriate ways by which stu
dents can express their views
concerning curricular matters,
and that protest actions such as
yours are not among them,"
writes Nelson.
At a meeting on April 3, Dr.
Rodney Beard, preventive medi
cine department head, told the
students that to make up their
deficiences they must sign their
examinations. There were 15
passes, and 5 fails, he said, and
those failing would then ar
range a time to make up the
exam.
The students asked for more
time to decide upon their action
and have not yet made a deci
sion.
The students left their exams
unsigned after a letter sent pre
ciously to Bard met with unsat
isfactory results, they felt.
The letter that was sent by
90 per cent of the third year
class protested the structure and
content of the .Community
Health course.
Community Health, which
dealt primarily with the study
of epidemics, should also con
sider "relevant problems of com
munity health' 'such as alcohol
ism, smoking, air pollution, and
drug addiction, students urged.
The letter informing the stu
dents of their possible expulsion
said that the Committee on Stu
dent Standing and Promotion "is
responsible for deciding whether
a student is progressivelv meet
ing the requirements establish
ed by the faculty, not with set
ting those requirements."
The students were told that

the Committee had "voted unani
mously to inform you and all of
the students with deficiences in
Community Health (PMD 301)
incurred Autumn Quarter 1967-
G8 that you may be denied furth
er registration in the Medical
School if you fail to resolve the
deficiency this Spring Quarter."
"The action of the Student
Standing Committee explicitly
states that you must resolve the
deficiency by a time determined
by the Department of Preventive
Medicine prior to June 15, 1968."
The Political Science Grad
uate Student Association rec
ently passed a resolution in sup
port of the medical students and
a similar petition is being cir
culated through the graduate
student union in all depart
ments, according to Ed Nelson,
graduate student in computer
science.
The political science associa
tion in a statement "urges the
Medical School administration
and the Department of Preven
tive Medicine not to threaten
the students involved with ex
pulsion or suspension and to
take meaningful and effective
measures to bring about im
provement in the course in
question. . . (And) set up formal
mechanisms whereby students
without need to resort to pro
test actions to make themselves
heard."
Dr. Leroy Pesch, associate
dean of the Medical School, said
last night that the Community
Health course could possibly be
come an elective course for next
year's third year class but "it's
difficult to say." The entire cur
riculum is under review, he
said.
The new committee reviewing
the curriculum which has non
voting student members, will
meet Tuesday afternoon, April
23, for the first time, Pesch
added.
One student who refused to
sign his exam said that the stu
dents might sign their exams if
the course were made elecitve.
Pesch said the Committee on
Student Standings and Promo
tion is composed of the Dean
of the Medical School Dr. Robert
J. Glaser and departmental rep
resentatives.
He also said that plans are
underway for a medical school
faculty senate organization, and
was "hopeful" that student
members would have voting
privileges.
