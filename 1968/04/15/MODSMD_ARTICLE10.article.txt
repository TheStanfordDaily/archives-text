Editor, The Daily:

that Stanford will admit "at
least ten minority-group stu
dents who do not meet minimal
academic requirements" implies
that (a) Stanford endorses rac
ism since race is to be a cri
terion for admission, (b) Stan
ford will propagate racism since
the statement links race with
academic ability and (c) Stan
ford is in the process of com
promising its academic integ
rity.

On behalf of the sponsors in
Wilbur and Branner I would
like to thank Joe Higgins for
the outstanding work that he
has done with students as an
educator and an honestly dedi
cated person. His record be
speaks the value of a residence
program growing from the
needs, aims, and insights of stu
dents themselves, rather than
one prescribed for them.
