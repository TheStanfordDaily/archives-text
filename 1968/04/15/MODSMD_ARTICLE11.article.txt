## How To Win A Grove Girl 
### Bob Fishman 
"The stereotyped scene at Grove House
finds the man playing the 'you're my
friend' angle while he bides his time
. . . hoping tliat he will become one of
the 'chosen few' when the intellectual
ly-prone Grovie girls get tired of
Plato."
— Steve Rutkus, "Sex and the Single
Girl," The Arena
The Scene: 3 a.m. in the Grove Lounge.
Priscilla Birnbaum, a Grove girl so "In"
that she has not spoken to anyone for three
months, is sitting alone in front of a roar
ing fire, reading the Euthyphro. Archie
Jones, who recently moved in, can be seen
entering timidly from left.
ARCHIE: Miss Birnbaum—may I call
you Miss Birnbaum?—would you mind if I
sat in the same lounge with you?
PRISCILLA: Well, OK, so long as you
don't make any nonse. I'm just getting to
the good part.
(Archie retires to a chair at the opposite
corner of the room. He picks up a book,
but soon begins to fidget uncontrollably.
Suddenly, he discards the books and runs
to Priscilla, throwing himself at her feet.)
A: Priscilla! I love you! I love you! I've
loved you ever since I first saw you in the
courtyard beneath my window, clad only in
a Nigerian workshirt, reading the Posterior
Analytics. Please, Priscilla, speak to me!
P: What did you say your name was?
A: Archie.
P: And do you live here?
A: Yes.

P: Haven't you heard? They've declared
a moratorium on sex. We're supposed to be
brothers and sisters now. I'm no longer
just someone you take out on Friday
nights, someone you, pin, get engaged to,
or marry. Now I'm a human being: a mind
among minds. Everything is natural now.
We can discuss Plato and Aristotle, Augus
tine and Acquinas, Hobbes and Locke,
Marx and Engels, Freud and Jung, W. C.
Fields. C'mon Archie. Let's be friends!
A: Can't I kiss you?
P: Never! Not even if you were Herbert
Marcuse himself.
A: Don't you love me?
P: Of course I love you. Everyone in
Grove loves everyone else. That's because
we're a community.
A: Can't I even hold your hand?
P: If you insist. I've always believed in
people touching each other. In fact, I con
sider myself to be an extremely tactile per
son.
(They hold hands.)
P: Come to think of it, Archie, haven't I
seen you somewhere before? Was it at a
SES policy meeting? At an SDS open meet
ing? At a social thought seminar? At an
Oakland demonstration? At Peter Lyman's
secret hideaway? At a McCarthy rally? At
an Esalen seminar? At the convocation of
the Community for Relevant Education? It
must have been at one of those. I never go
anywhere else.
A: I live here.
P: O, that's right! But what do you do

with yourself. I never see you.
A: I sit around my room usually and
cry. Sometimes I go to a movie alone.
Otherwise, I like to sleep a lot. And I study
Greek.
P: Ah, Greek! The tongue of the im
mortals! the very beating heart of Western
Civilization! I sometimes think that Greek
is my favorite language.
A: Then you know it too?
P: Actually, no. With all these seminars
we're required to take I never got the
chance.
A (seizing his opportunity): I could
teach you Greek.
(His words have spoken to her deepest,
heartfelt desires. She is now putty in his
hands.)
P: Please, Archie, teach me Greek! I'll
do anything to learn.
A: Anything?
P: Anything. I've always been intellec
tually prone. When can we begin?
A: Why not now? I have some very in
teresting textbooks in my room.
P: What about your roommate?
A: Don't worry about him. He's in East
Palo Alto—excuse me, Nairobi—doing a
survey of the dental habits of black mili
tants.
(For a brief but timeless moment they
gaze into each other's eyes, breaking off
their gaze only to embrace. Priscilla,
with her free hand, consigns her English
translation to the flames as the curtain
falls.)

— Steve Rutkus, "Sex and the Single
Girl," The Arena
The Scene: 3 a.m. in the Grove Lounge.
Priscilla Birnbaum, a Grove girl so "In"
that she has not spoken to anyone for three
months, is sitting alone in front of a roar
ing fire, reading the Euthyphro. Archie
Jones, who recently moved in, can be seen
entering timidly from left.
ARCHIE: Miss Birnbaum—may I call
you Miss Birnbaum?—would you mind if I
sat in the same lounge with you?
PRISCILLA: Well, OK, so long as you
don't make any nonse. I'm just getting to
the good part.
(Archie retires to a chair at the opposite
corner of the room. He picks up a book,
but soon begins to fidget uncontrollably.
Suddenly, he discards the books and runs
to Priscilla, throwing himself at her feet.)
A: Priscilla! I love you! I love you! I've
loved you ever since I first saw you in the
courtyard beneath my window, clad only in
a Nigerian workshirt, reading the Posterior
Analytics. Please, Priscilla, speak to me!
P: What did you say your name was?
A: Archie.
P: And do you live here?
A: Yes.

P: Haven't you heard? They've declared
a moratorium on sex. We're supposed to be
brothers and sisters now. I'm no longer
just someone you take out on Friday
nights, someone you, pin, get engaged to,
or marry. Now I'm a human being: a mind
among minds. Everything is natural now.
We can discuss Plato and Aristotle, Augus
tine and Acquinas, Hobbes and Locke,
Marx and Engels, Freud and Jung, W. C.
Fields. C'mon Archie. Let's be friends!
A: Can't I kiss you?
P: Never! Not even if you were Herbert
Marcuse himself.
A: Don't you love me?
P: Of course I love you. Everyone in
Grove loves everyone else. That's because
we're a community.
A: Can't I even hold your hand?
P: If you insist. I've always believed in
people touching each other. In fact, I con
sider myself to be an extremely tactile per
son.
(They hold hands.)
P: Come to think of it, Archie, haven't I
seen you somewhere before? Was it at a
SES policy meeting? At an SDS open meet
ing? At a social thought seminar? At an
Oakland demonstration? At Peter Lyman's
secret hideaway? At a McCarthy rally? At
an Esalen seminar? At the convocation of
the Community for Relevant Education? It
must have been at one of those. I never go
anywhere else.
A: I live here.
P: O, that's right! But what do you do

with yourself. I never see you.
A: I sit around my room usually and
cry. Sometimes I go to a movie alone.
Otherwise, I like to sleep a lot. And I study
Greek.
P: Ah, Greek! The tongue of the im
mortals! the very beating heart of Western
Civilization! I sometimes think that Greek
is my favorite language.
A: Then you know it too?
P: Actually, no. With all these seminars
we're required to take I never got the
chance.
A (seizing his opportunity): I could
teach you Greek.
(His words have spoken to her deepest,
heartfelt desires. She is now putty in his
hands.)
P: Please, Archie, teach me Greek! I'll
do anything to learn.
A: Anything?
P: Anything. I've always been intellec
tually prone. When can we begin?
A: Why not now? I have some very in
teresting textbooks in my room.
P: What about your roommate?
A: Don't worry about him. He's in East
Palo Alto—excuse me, Nairobi—doing a
survey of the dental habits of black mili
tants.
(For a brief but timeless moment they
gaze into each other's eyes, breaking off
their gaze only to embrace. Priscilla,
with her free hand, consigns her English
translation to the flames as the curtain
falls.)

Jones, who recently moved in, can be seen
entering timidly from left.
ARCHIE: Miss Birnbaum—may I call
you Miss Birnbaum?—would you mind if I
sat in the same lounge with you?
PRISCILLA: Well, OK, so long as you
don't make any nonse. I'm just getting to
the good part.
(Archie retires to a chair at the opposite
corner of the room. He picks up a book,
but soon begins to fidget uncontrollably.
Suddenly, he discards the books and runs
to Priscilla, throwing himself at her feet.)
A: Priscilla! I love you! I love you! I've
loved you ever since I first saw you in the
courtyard beneath my window, clad only in
a Nigerian workshirt, reading the Posterior
Analytics. Please, Priscilla, speak to me!
P: What did you say your name was?
A: Archie.
P: And do you live here?
A: Yes.

P: Haven't you heard? They've declared
a moratorium on sex. We're supposed to be
brothers and sisters now. I'm no longer
just someone you take out on Friday
nights, someone you, pin, get engaged to,
or marry. Now I'm a human being: a mind
among minds. Everything is natural now.
We can discuss Plato and Aristotle, Augus
tine and Acquinas, Hobbes and Locke,
Marx and Engels, Freud and Jung, W. C.
Fields. C'mon Archie. Let's be friends!
A: Can't I kiss you?
P: Never! Not even if you were Herbert
Marcuse himself.
A: Don't you love me?
P: Of course I love you. Everyone in
Grove loves everyone else. That's because
we're a community.
A: Can't I even hold your hand?
P: If you insist. I've always believed in
people touching each other. In fact, I con
sider myself to be an extremely tactile per
son.
(They hold hands.)
P: Come to think of it, Archie, haven't I
seen you somewhere before? Was it at a
SES policy meeting? At an SDS open meet
ing? At a social thought seminar? At an
Oakland demonstration? At Peter Lyman's
secret hideaway? At a McCarthy rally? At
an Esalen seminar? At the convocation of
the Community for Relevant Education? It
must have been at one of those. I never go
anywhere else.
A: I live here.
P: O, that's right! But what do you do

with yourself. I never see you.
A: I sit around my room usually and
cry. Sometimes I go to a movie alone.
Otherwise, I like to sleep a lot. And I study
Greek.
P: Ah, Greek! The tongue of the im
mortals! the very beating heart of Western
Civilization! I sometimes think that Greek
is my favorite language.
A: Then you know it too?
P: Actually, no. With all these seminars
we're required to take I never got the
chance.
A (seizing his opportunity): I could
teach you Greek.
(His words have spoken to her deepest,
heartfelt desires. She is now putty in his
hands.)
P: Please, Archie, teach me Greek! I'll
do anything to learn.
A: Anything?
P: Anything. I've always been intellec
tually prone. When can we begin?
A: Why not now? I have some very in
teresting textbooks in my room.
P: What about your roommate?
A: Don't worry about him. He's in East
Palo Alto—excuse me, Nairobi—doing a
survey of the dental habits of black mili
tants.
(For a brief but timeless moment they
gaze into each other's eyes, breaking off
their gaze only to embrace. Priscilla,
with her free hand, consigns her English
translation to the flames as the curtain
falls.)
