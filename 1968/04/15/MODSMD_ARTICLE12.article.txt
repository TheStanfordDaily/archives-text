# The 						Washington Merry-Go-Round
## Did O'Brien Want To Quit? 
### Drew Pearson 
WASHINGTON—Larry O'Brien
was so distraught over the pres
sure brought on him to resign as
Postmaster General and cam
paign for Bobby Kennedy that
at one time he was close to
tears.
He told friends he would
never have made this vital deci
sion had not President Johnson
decided to retire at the end of
this term. He felt great loyalty
to Johnson, who had promoted
him from a White House assist
ant to the exalted position of
Cabinet member. This was an
honor he had never expected to
achieve, and he was both grate
ful and loyal.
However, O'Brien's roots are
in Massachusetts, and he first
came to Washington with John
F. Kennedy; so when Bobby
Kennedy applied the pressure,
he finally yielded.
The pressure was intense,
however, and at one point
O'Brien confided to friends that
he considered Vice President
Humphrey better qualified for
the White House than the man
he was about to campaign for.
Labor leaders with whom
O'Brien has had close contacts
urged him to support Humph
rey. Humhprey telephoned
O'Brien twice, and was closeted
with him for an hour in the
Vice Presidential office. Lining
up on the side of Humphrey
was Mrs. O'Brien, who urged
her husband to join the Humph
rey forces.
What the clincher was that
Bobby Kennedy exercised over
O'Brien is not known, but in
the end the harassed Postmas
ter General decided to leave the
Cabinet and work for Bobby.
More Pressure
Pressure tactics are also be
ing applied to Congressmen.
Rep. Richard McCarthy, D.,
N.Y., an all-out supporter of
President Johnson, recently got
a phone call from Dr. Fred M.
Snell, dean of the graduate
school of the State University
of New York at Buffalo, who is
chairman of the Niagara Coali
tion for a Democratic Alterna
tive, a dump-Johnson group
formed before LBJ withdrew.
Snell informed Rep. McCarthy:
"We're interested in knowing
where you stand on a Democrat
ic choice for President."
"I'm uneommited," replied
McCarthy.
"Well," said Snell, bluntly,
"unless you publicly support ei
ther Senator McCarthy, our
first choice, or Senator Kennedy,
we will run a candidate against

you in the primary or in the
general election in November,
or both."
Rep. McCarthy is a leading
crusader against water pollu
tion and is not being bulldozed.
He leans toward Vice President
Humphrey.
Ky Lets Hair Down
Must Reading — Look maga
zine's interview with Vice Presi
dent Ky of South Vietnam in
which he states: "Americans are
here because they want to stay
in Asia . . . not because they
care for us ... . Look at that
Robert Kennedy who says:
'Democracy, freedom' — words.
His concept of democracy and
freedom is simply ridiculous to
me, because it is always these

big powerful countries talking
about democracy and freedom
which create colonialism. They
begin with saying: 'We are here
to help you.' And then they be
come bosses, and then they be
come colonialists. Enough with
that. . . .
"We are the pretext for their
(American) vanity, which only
looks at the conquest of the
power, of the supremacy. And
in such a struggle we risk be
ing quashed without pity. Even
Ho Chi Minh knows this plain
truth. Everybody knows. Every
body but the Americans. But
trying to explain this to the
Americans would be as hard as
to explain to them that the word
socialism is not a dirty word. It

is impossible to talk with the
Americans, not because they
don't want to talk but because
they don't understand. . . .
"You white people cannot un
derstand. You white people give
too much importance to life, to
the length of life, to the com
forts of life . . . What we now
have are laws that defend the
rich. We need new laws to de
fend the poor. ... I am a yellow
man, I am an Asiatic, and I
know what my country needs
much better than all these
white people writing books."
Vice President Ky was being
interviewed by an Italian jour
nalist, Oriana Fallaci, which
may be why he spoke so frank
ly.
