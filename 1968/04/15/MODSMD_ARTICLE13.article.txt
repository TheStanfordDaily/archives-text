# Guest Column
## Angry Reply To Blacks 
### Walter F. Reddall III 
(This column Is not an expres
sion of the views of The
DAILY; it presents Mr. Red
dall's opinions only.)
Would those who used Martin
Luther King's murder as an ex
cuse to burn my country's flag
in White Plaza kindly leave
America, and go someplace
where they think the system is
better? Their disgraceful per
formance reminds me of noth
ing so much as a spoiled brat
throwing a tantrum, and it
seems from Tuesday's Daily that
they have been rewarded for
their mis-doings with another
lollipop from an indulgent ad
ministration.
It is apparent to me that
many Negro-Americans, in par
ticular the members of the
Black Students Union, who cry
for freedom today do not know
the meaning of the word. Free
dom carries with it the right to
strive but not the guarantee of
fulfillment. Yet they think that
freedom automatically entitles
them to all the material posses
sions that they see their white
counterparts enjoying, com
pletely oblivious of how this
wealth was achieved.
The Negro American, with
his long history of living under
paternalism—first as a slave
and more recently as a ward of
the government, has been par

ticularly susceptible to these
gross distortions of the Ameri
can Dream. Well the Negro,
sooner or later, is in for a rude
shock.
I certainly do not give any
man leave to help himself to
my hard earned money. Is riot
ing and looting simply to be re
placed with legalized stealing
from people who have properly
accumulated their wealth
through the rational method of
creative production and plain
hard work? My answer and that
of millions of Americans is a
resounding NO!
America is the greatest coun
try in the history of the world.
It is unique in that only here
have individuals been free to
advance or not to advance on
the basis of their individual tal
ents. When will the Negro mili
tant learn these fundamfntal
facts which should be part of
the grammar school education
of every American, but which
he apparently missed some
where under the "less than min
imal standards" concept?
It is a measure of his moral
bankruptcy that he has chosen
to raise to anti-hero pedestals
Stokely Carmichael, Rap Brown,
and Adam C. Powell.
Young Negroes have in the
process neglected to recognize
and emulate the achievements
of such heroic figures as Leon

tyne Price, who by dint of hard
work and perseverance has be
come a credit to her nation and
her race. When will there come
a proud Black leader who has
the courage to boot his own
people and not America in the
seat of the pants, and tell them
in no uncertain terms that me
diocrity just will not do?
Perhaps such a man will
emerge from the mature Negro
G.l.'s returning from Vietnam.
Certainly we cannot hope to
look for such a leader among
those Negro students at Stan
ford who have revealed them
selves as traitors.
As long as they are issuing
"warnings" I will issue one too
—no one had better try to burn
an Ameircan flag in my pres
ence. Too many noble men,
black and white, have died for
that flag to allow it to be drag
ged through the mud.

Would those who used Martin
Luther King's murder as an ex
cuse to burn my country's flag
in White Plaza kindly leave
America, and go someplace
where they think the system is
better? Their disgraceful per
formance reminds me of noth
ing so much as a spoiled brat
throwing a tantrum, and it
seems from Tuesday's Daily that
they have been rewarded for
their mis-doings with another
lollipop from an indulgent ad
ministration.
It is apparent to me that
many Negro-Americans, in par
ticular the members of the
Black Students Union, who cry
for freedom today do not know
the meaning of the word. Free
dom carries with it the right to
strive but not the guarantee of
fulfillment. Yet they think that
freedom automatically entitles
them to all the material posses
sions that they see their white
counterparts enjoying, com
pletely oblivious of how this
wealth was achieved.
The Negro American, with
his long history of living under
paternalism—first as a slave
and more recently as a ward of
the government, has been par

ticularly susceptible to these
gross distortions of the Ameri
can Dream. Well the Negro,
sooner or later, is in for a rude
shock.
I certainly do not give any
man leave to help himself to
my hard earned money. Is riot
ing and looting simply to be re
placed with legalized stealing
from people who have properly
accumulated their wealth
through the rational method of
creative production and plain
hard work? My answer and that
of millions of Americans is a
resounding NO!
America is the greatest coun
try in the history of the world.
It is unique in that only here
have individuals been free to
advance or not to advance on
the basis of their individual tal
ents. When will the Negro mili
tant learn these fundamfntal
facts which should be part of
the grammar school education
of every American, but which
he apparently missed some
where under the "less than min
imal standards" concept?
It is a measure of his moral
bankruptcy that he has chosen
to raise to anti-hero pedestals
Stokely Carmichael, Rap Brown,
and Adam C. Powell.
Young Negroes have in the
process neglected to recognize
and emulate the achievements
of such heroic figures as Leon

tyne Price, who by dint of hard
work and perseverance has be
come a credit to her nation and
her race. When will there come
a proud Black leader who has
the courage to boot his own
people and not America in the
seat of the pants, and tell them
in no uncertain terms that me
diocrity just will not do?
Perhaps such a man will
emerge from the mature Negro
G.l.'s returning from Vietnam.
Certainly we cannot hope to
look for such a leader among
those Negro students at Stan
ford who have revealed them
selves as traitors.
As long as they are issuing
"warnings" I will issue one too
—no one had better try to burn
an Ameircan flag in my pres
ence. Too many noble men,
black and white, have died for
that flag to allow it to be drag
ged through the mud.
