# Man's Physical Environment Subject Of Century 21 Talk
## 
### 
What is needed to answer so
cial and moral questions today
is an "attempt to understand
man's place in nature," said Dr.
S. P. R. Charter in a Century
21 speech last Thursday night.
His speech, presented infor
mally to a Tresidder audience,
was titled "The Physical En
vironment of Man."
Charter, a physicist and au
thor who has worked exten
sively in the field of human eco
logy. asked how events like Mar
tin Luther King's assassination
could occur in a world capable
ot near-perfect space shots, and
declared that more schools and
economic opportunities will not
be enough to solve such prob
lems.
What we need, he emphasized,
is an attempt to come to some
understanding of reality. "We
must be neither optimistic or
pessimistic, but realistic." The
solutions, however, are "not
simple."
Charter said that a knowledge
of human ecology is important
because "if people could under
stand their own place in nature,
then maybe they could under
stand someone else's."
"Man's place in nature is per
haps his deepest, most profound
species inquiry," and his need
to find this place is a historic
need. Rut his place is rapidly
becoming one "within his own
pollutions."
Charter warned that because
man has been "more a contamin
ator than a purifier," by devel
oping new technological devices,
the earth is in danger of becom
ing "non-habitable."
"Pollution of the environ
ment," he believes, "pollutes the
awareness of and responsibility
to self and beyond self." He cited
defoliation as an example.
"Whrn defoliation becomes a
high policy in the name of lib
erty and freedom, then liberty

and freedom become corrupt."
Throughout his speech, Char
ter raised several moral ques
tions about technology. "Is tech
nology the height of man's
glory?" "Can we uncouple the
threat of technology from its
promise?" "What are the im
plications of progress?"
Charter claimed that man has
not been searching for the per
fection of self, but of devices
and that such a path will always
lead to pollution.

However, Charter was careful
to say that not all technologi
cal devices are necessarily bad,
but that the harm in a device
depends on its use.
A trend in the right direction
he noted, is the growing "re
serve or suspicion" over the tech
nological breakthrough.
Charter also said that men
must realize that "we are in
deed one with all life, with the
present and the past." Man is a
part of and never above nature.
