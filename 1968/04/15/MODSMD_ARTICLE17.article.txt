# Small Turnout
## Speakers Criticize Days Of Concern 
### 
Days of Concern evoked
apathy among students and
sharp criticism from speakers
as relatively small crowds turn
ed out to hear an assortment of
panels and public figures con
sider the role of the university
on Friday and Saturday.
Robert Scheer, editor of Ram
parts, who appeared on a panel
with Schoenbrun Saturday
morning, set the tone as he
called the Concern program an
example of the ineffectual
"style" that universities use in
considering social problems.
Universities should be "launch
ing pads for change," Scheer
said. But the mood of a panel
discussion or a scholarly study
is one of compromise, not revo
lution, he said.
Scheer said that Stanford in
particular is "as out of it as it is
earnest in its attitudes."
The two day program also
came under heavy criticism
from Harvey Hukari, Jr., presi
dent of the Stanford Young Am
ericans for Freedom as repre
senting "mildly concerned"
white liberals.
Hukari said that his group
had given up use of White Me
morial Plaza on Friday because
"we knew the administration
would take it away from us,
as they have done in the past."
Gordon Smith, former Cali
fornia State Finance Director,
protested during Friday's panel
discussion that he "was alone"
in supoprting the Vietnam war.
More prominent, however,
was criticism of Stanford and
the University administration by
the guest speakers. Terry Fran
cois, a San Franciso supervisor,
told his audience at Friday's
noon rally that "Stanford is a
white man's campus."
The fact that the Black Stu
dent Union's demands were met.
Francois continued, "is another
outstanding example of the un
willingness of the establishment
to move without pressure."
"I wish that the concern that
the white students have shown
against the war in Vietnam
could be shown towards (black
people)," he said.
Roger Hilsman, in his speech
"The University, Servant or
Social Critic of Society," said he
considered being a dean as "not
a very rewarding experience."
Later, after Provost Richard
Lyman's speech as part of a
four-man panel, Hilsman asked,
"How did I know that you had
a popular dean?"
Hilsman called on the univers
ity to become a place "where

minorities can grow, where dis
sent can reach fruition." As part
of this goal he urged the uni
versity community to add to
human knowledge, "knowledge
in a sense of better factors to
analyze the problems and pre
dict the outcome of events."
If the university were able
to provide "socially relevant
knowledge," Hilsman insisted it
could be an "effective servant
and an effective critic."
William Rambo, associate
dean of research of the school
of engineering, concurred with
Hilsman's analysis, saying "ser
vice is very often offered by the
severest critics."
David Ransom, editor of the
Midpeninsula Observer, suggest
ed that Stanford's involvement
in "imperialism" prevented the
University from performing
either role.
"There are no humanists, prac
ticing at least, on the board of
trustees," said Ransom in point
ing out one consequence he saw
of Stanford's involvement in
"the military-industrial com
plex."
Gordon Smith countered state
ments by other panel members
by insisting that "The war of
dissent is the greatest crisis in
America today."
"We have lost our grip on
national purpose," Smith said.
He added that he was "ashamed"

of the flagburning that had oc
cured at Stanford the week-end
before.
David Schoenbrun, former
CBS correspondent and lecturer
in international affairs at Col
umbia University, called Smith's
outrage an "easy" reaction.
Schoenbrun supported Norman
Thomas' suggestion that flags
be washed as an alternative to
burning them.
The largest crowd of the week
end, 300 to 400 persons, turned
out to hear Schoenbrun attack
the war in Vietnam, racial in
justice and Herbert Hoover. In
the portion of his eclectic pre
sentation that dealt with the
role of the university, Schoen
brun advocated interdisciplinary
study in what he saw as an age
of increased specialization.
Schoenbrun urged students to
follow the advice of Descartes
and take nothing for granted.
United States involvement in
Vietnam and administration talk
of "the responsibilities of power"
are based on outdated assump
tions, he said.
It is the idea that America
must "pick up the white man's
burden" that has involved the
country in international disas
ter, Schoenbrun said.
Concerning Stanford, Schoen
brun said that he could not un
derstand why a university would
name an institute after Herbert

Hoover. "Mention Hoover's
name to me and I get ill," he
sail. "In 1932 we were all starv
ing to death."
In general, Schoenbrun saw
students behavior in recent
years as very restrained. "The
fact that you are not burning
down a building every day is an
example of extreme moder
ation," he said.
In the closing talk of the pro
gram, Sen. Clifford Case (R.,
N.J.) said that the solution to
the racial ills of the United
States lies in the education of
the lower and middle income
white. These people feel so in
secure that they will not open
their society to the Negro, Case
said.
"W e must demonstrate
through intelligent programs
that to let these people into
this society will enrich the
whole, not bring him (the lower
and middle class white) down,"
he told a sparse audience of 150
people in Memorial Auditorium.

Case appealed to the uni
versities to come up with such
programs.
The senator also declared that
the Vietnam war was "unwin
able by the present administra
tion's policies," and the only
course of action left open was
a slow withdrawal.
"Whether it was winable or
not winable, or it was winable
and somebody bungled it, I don't
know," Case said. "But if the
war continues the way it is it
will only result in the destruc
tion of South Vietnam."
He also called the present de
struction of South Vietnam and
loss of American life "the height
of immorality."
Case claimed that "as long
as we keep carrying the bur
den we have," the South Viet
namese government will never
make itself more amenable to
the wishes and needs of Its
people.
He again called on the aca
demic world for aid.
