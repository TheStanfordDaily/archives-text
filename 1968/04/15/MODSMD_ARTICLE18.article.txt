# Bruins Prevail, 79-66
## Trackmen Fail In Upset Bid 
### 
Seniors Jim Letterer and Jim
Ward won impressive victories
in the mile and 440 respectively
to lead an inspired Stanford
track team to within 13 points
of a UCLA team that had post
ed better marks in all but two
of the events.
The Indians, who had been
thoroughly shellacked in last
week's meet with Washington
State, 109-36, gave the Bruins a
real scare in the 79-66 loss.
After the first two events it
appeared as if the meet would
be a rerun of last week's, as
UCLA, led by Steve Marcus'
meet record setting put of 62 %,
swept the shot put and won the
440 relay to get off to a quick
14-0 lead.
But the Tribe trackmen were
not about to give up without
a fight and proceeded to sweep
the javelin, and take firsts in
the long jump and the mile
run.
Stanford's Tom Colby, a trans
fer student from Tulane Uni

versity, led the javelin sweep
with a throw of 224 feet, and
Craig Vaughn was the winner
in the long jump with a leap
of 24-1%.
Senior Jim Letterer's victory
in the mile was the biggest up
set of the meet. Letterer sprint
ed past highly favored George
Husaruk of UCLA with 300
yards to go, to slice nine sec
onds off his collegiate best, post
ing 4:06.4.
