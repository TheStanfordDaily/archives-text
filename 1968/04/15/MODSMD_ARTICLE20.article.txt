# Stanford Nine Drops 2 Of 3
## 
### 
Stanford baseball fortunes
took a turn for the worse last
weekend, as the Indian nine
dropped two of three games.
Friday afternoon Cal-State
Hayward tallied five times in
the the bottom of the eighth
to eke out a 8-7 win. The Pio
neers capitalized on five walks,
a passed ball and an error in
defeating Stanford reliefer Don
Rose.
Saturday afternoon Coach
Ray Young's nine split a double
header with Fresno State, losing
the opener 2-1 and winning the
nightcap 11-7.
Lanky Rod Poteete was the
heart-break loser in the opening
contest, while Harvey Shank
took the win in the evening
slugfest.
