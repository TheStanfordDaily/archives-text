# Laxmen Garner 3rd Straight In 5-4 Thriller Over Palo Alto
## 
### 
Riding on the strength of a
superb first half, the Stanford
varsity lacrosse team withstood
a vengeful comeback by the
Palo Alto Lacrosse Club and
stayed undefeated, 5-4.
The Indians went into the
half-time break leading 4-1 on
the strength of single goals by
George Muser and Peter Hovey,
and two by Dirk Sepas. The In
dians had controlled the ball
well and it looked like the game
would turn into a minor rout,
as the veteran Palo Altans
seemed to be tiring.

But the angry Palo Alto club,
unaware that they were sup
posed to be exhausted, roared
back with a goal in the third
period and two in the fourth to
tie the score.
With five minutes remaining,
Pete Eakland rifled in a shot
from the crease on a perfect
fast-break pass from midfielder
John Handly to provide the mar
gin of victory.
The key to the Stanford vic
tory was again defense. Fresh
man Wade Killefer, in his first
major test, clung to former
Williams attack star Ralph

Bankus and held him to one
shot and no assists. A week ago,
Bankus scored eight goals and
three assists aaginst the Marin
County Lacrosse Club.
Bankus got little help from
his teammates. Rod Pomberg
and Sandy Saxton were under
the watchful surveillance of Bill
Eakland, and Denny McNeely
kept the crease clear for the In
dians in one of his most inspired
games.
Palo Alto and Stanford meet
again in a month, and the angry
Palo Alto club will be gunning
again to knock the Red off.
