# Doctor Reports MACE Is A Threat To Health
## 
### VICKI GRAHAM 
MACE and other chemical
weapons of war — now placed
in the hands of civil authorities
without adequate medical re
search — constitute a threat to
health and even life, reported
Dr. Sumner M. Kalman, Profes
sor of Pharmacology, in a lec
ture at the Medical School last
week.
His subject was potential and
actual chemical weapons, includ
ing mustard and nerve gas, na
palm and herbicides. The speech
was one in a series on the re
lationship between modern war
fare and modern medicine spon
sored by the Medical School.
Following speakers will con
sider germ warfare, the rights
of civilians in wartime from a
psychiatrist's point of view, and
the conflict between modern
medical and military ethics.
Dr. Kalman said he was step
ping outside his field of popu
lation control and the pharma
cological aspects of contracep
tion to discuss the "morbid"
topic of biological warfare.
He said science is responsible
for the harm and military so
phistication resulting from re
search and technological ad
vance. He said science also has

a duty to counteract or diminish
the harm done by technology,
particularly in the purposeful
synthesis of antidotes for chem
icals used in warfare. Informing
the public of his work is one of
the scientists' principle obliga
tions to society.
Discharged from a cartridge
or by an aerosol spray, MACE
affects its victim in one or two
seconds. He falls to his knees,
lacrimating, coughing and sob
bing. His vision is impaired for
15-20 minutes. There is a case
on record of scarred corneal tis
sue and permanent damage. Con
tact with MACE may also cause
first degree burns and an aller
gic reaction.
Even more serious is the al
most immediate increase in
blood pressure and heart rate
after exposure. In several cases
there was an increase from nor
mal pressure of 120/70 to some
thing approximately 230/98.
"For anyone with serious cardio
vascular disease or pulmonary
condition the experience could
be fatal," said Dr. Kalman.
Dr. Kalman noted that the
very old and very young are
more susceptible to respiratory
difficulties resulting from con
tact with MACE. He added that

the United States also uses tear
gas on civilians in Vietnam.
He said that a woman report
er told him she had placed a
small drop of MACE on her
cheek and that immediately she
began coughing and lacrimating
and experienced a blurring of
vision for 15-20 minutes.
He objected to the use of
MACE by police in handling
civil disorders and other indivi
dual situations. "But I blame
the civil authorities who allow
the police to buy the chemical
without really knowing its ef
fects," he said.
"It is very difficult for phy
sicians to obtain information
from supply houses and police.
The dosage scheduling is up to
the police. We, as physicians
should know enough about
MACE and its dosage to treat
those who encounter it," said
Dr. Kalman.
He said that MACE has not
been cleared by a public health
agency. "I wrote to the Food
and Drug Administration about
MACE and its preparation," he
said. "I received an answer to
the effect that since MACE is
intended to produce deleterious
effects, it does not come under
the Pure Food and Drug Act."
