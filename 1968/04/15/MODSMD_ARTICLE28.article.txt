I am most grateful to ACT for their latest play,
Misanthrope. I shall confess I did not think that
any production of this play, especially in transla
tion, could be both enjoyable and faithful to
Moliere. I remember a performance last year at
the Comedie Francaisc, in which the spectators
laughed only once, at the word "cabinet," which
now means "toilet," and then meant "closet."
The Misanthrope has always been considered a
great comedy, as it conforms to the classical
rules of time, place, and theme, and renounces
the vulgarities of traditional farce. In fact, very
few comic elements are blended with much moral
and philosophical concern.
Alceste loves Celimene and hates the rest of
the world. Celimene loves being loved by every
man in the world. This greediness will eventually
ruin her reputation and increase Alceste's impo
tence and despair.
Time has brought changes in the interpreta
tion of the play. Alceste's frankness was mere
bluntness and ridiculousness to Moliere's con
temporaries. For Rousseau, on the other hand.
Alceste was a true hero, betrayed by worldly
hypocrisy. Modern critics at last doubt his hon
esty. Such an evolution suggests that the actual
question is not that of man's attitude toward so
ciety—an idea foreign to Moliere's age—but that
of sincerity.
The problem is to overcome the discrepancy
between justified, i.e. moral bitterness, and un
justified, i.e. comical anger, and to create a true,
living character. The usual compromise is that a
ridiculous Alceste, with wig, lace, and ribbons,
castigates the world's Pharisaism. But Alceste's
criticism is then weakened by the character him
self, and the play sinks into uncertainty and
boredom, as it misses both the vigour of farce
and the charm of romance. Besides, 17th century
background, imposed by the set and costumes,
makes criticism mostly irrelevant to our society.
A solution is to present a 20th century Misan
thrope. Many attempts have already been made,
more or less successfully. ACT's production, at
the Geary Theater in San Francisco, performs
brilliantly. The set by Stuart Wurtzel and cos
tumes by Patricia von Brandenstein place the
action among the young fops and snobs who are
the successors of Moliere's little Marquess. The
analogy, or revival, is overwhelmingly convinc
ing, and the characterization is the more effect
ive as we feel we meet such people everyday.
This just proves that Moliere is still a modern
playwright, and that society has not changed so
much on the whole. "Atrabiliousness" and "mis
anthropy" are now called "emotional problems"
and "paranoid."

Barry MacGregor portrays an excellent Alceste.
Fashionably dressed in black velvet, he looks like
a dainty, quixotic Hamlet. His greatest achieve
ment is probably that he does not only display
both contradictory sides of the character, but
bridges with some credibility the gap between
righteousness and exaggeration by showing a
stubborn, uncompromising logic. Alceste is not
honest insofar as he strives to be persecuted,
and to prove himself right by being wrong.
Kitty Winn, as the coquette Celimene, wears a
miniskirt and high white boots, which are indica
tive of the cruelty and perversion of the char
acter. However she lacks the sweet attractive
ness, which should make her the more danger
ous, obviously because her looks would be really
deceptive.
Mark Bramhall and Mark Schell, as the little
Marquess, have no choice but to perform very
well, inasmuch as the parts lends themselves to
perfect performances. I would like to mention
Michael Learned, who makes of the role of the
prude Arsinoe an entertaining, but at the same
time not very likely appearance. The same can
be said of the behaviour of the policeman and
Dubois, Alceste's man-servant, portrayed by Mi
chael Lerner: this, although being quite amus
ing, is nevertheless completely gratuitous.
The direction by David William, is to be highly
praised, as the show brings both fun and pene
tration. I wish to put a special emphasis on the
fifth and last act, in which he succeeds to confer
a now comical dimension to Moliere's ordinarily
weak document.
A last word: Moliere's text bears such an ag
gressive renovation rather well, thanks to Rich
ard Wilbur's efforts. His work is actually an
adaptation much more than a translation. But
the spirit is respected, even if the letter is not
always faithful to the original.
For example, he writes:
"I've wit, of course; and taste in such
perfection
"That I can judge without the least
reflection."
This stands for:
'Tour de I'esprit, j'en ai sans doute, et du
bon gout
"A Juger sans etude et raisonner deutout."
The comical effect of the inversion in the first
line is not rendered; "Juger sans etude" means
that "the well-to-do know everything without
having studied anything," as Mascarille asserts,
and not "judge without reflection;" at last, "rai
sonner de tout" has been flatly dropped. How
ever, Mr. Wilbur's verse conveys most success
fully on the stage the two main qualities of Mo
liere's dialogue, i.e. bombast and logic, through
rhyme and rhythm. I believe such a clever adap
tation has given the tone to the whole produc
tion.
