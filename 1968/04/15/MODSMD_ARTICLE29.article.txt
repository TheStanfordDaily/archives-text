# Tau Beta Pi Dinner
## Engineering Called Exciting 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Engineering can be "dramat
ic, exciting, and rewarding" a
group of engineering honor stu
dents were told Saturday night,
while being urged to search for
such experiences in their ca
reers.
The speaker was William
Rambo, associate dean of engi
neering for research and direc
tor of the Stanford Electronic
Laboratories, who spoke at the
initiation banquet of Stanford's
Tau Beta Pi chapter.
Tau Beta Pi is the national
engineering honorary society.
"If you go into a career and
don't find these things—don't
find engineering dramatic, ex
citing, rewarding—maybe you
should change, or you should
change your job," Rambo told
the group.
"And my advice is that you
don't hesitate to change either
one," he added.
Rambo himself was initiated
into Tau Beta Pi earlier in the
day as an "Eminent Engineer."
Also initiated were 16 students
and Professor Lawrence A.
Manning, an alumnus.
Speaking on "The Education
of an Engineer," Rambo dis
cussed a major project he
worked on shortly after World

War 11, the design of an air
plane navigational guidance
system, which illustrated his
thesis.
The problem on which he
worked was one for which he
had no training in his studies
or previous work experience.
Projects like this, Rambo said,
are "one of the most exciting
parts of engineering."
The important thing engineers
should get out of their college
training, Rambo said, is "the in
quisitiveness and the curiosity
necessary so that you will be
able to adapt to such situa
tions."
Because of such variety in en
gineering jobs, "I still don't
have a pat set of answers as to
what you'll find when you go
to work, go out into the field,"
he told the students.
Rambo, who led a seminar
on the social content of engi
neering last quarter, noted
that the engineer today must
not only be capable of han
dling varied and sometimes
unfamiliar technical prob
lems, but also will have to be
able to deal with people on
many levels.

In the project he used as an
example, Rambo worked with
officials from several govern
ment agencies, including the
State Department, and airline
officials and pilots, as well as
technicians and other engineers.
"This project opened up areas
of enormous difficulties of an
engineer talking to government
officials" and getting them to
agree with the results and act
on them, he said.
The difficulty arose, Rambo
noted, from trying to explain the
solution of a technical problem
to someone who is not technic
ally oriented.
"This presents problems to
engineers than cannot be
taught in a university," he
said.
The engineering students who
were initiated into Stanford's
chapter, California Gamma, are
Tore Abrahamsen, Ronald
Brown, Gaynor Dawson, Rich
ard Flower, David Gilmer, Alan
Hanson, Christopher Johnson,
Ernest Manuel, Donald March,
Nicholas Moll, Ulf Motzfeldt,
Franklin Orr, Peter Senge, Hal
Stoll, and Patrick Sullivan.

citing, rewarding—maybe you
should change, or you should
change your job," Rambo told
the group.
"And my advice is that you
don't hesitate to change either
one," he added.
Rambo himself was initiated
into Tau Beta Pi earlier in the
day as an "Eminent Engineer."
Also initiated were 16 students
and Professor Lawrence A.
Manning, an alumnus.
Speaking on "The Education
of an Engineer," Rambo dis
cussed a major project he
worked on shortly after World

War 11, the design of an air
plane navigational guidance
system, which illustrated his
thesis.
The problem on which he
worked was one for which he
had no training in his studies
or previous work experience.
Projects like this, Rambo said,
are "one of the most exciting
parts of engineering."
The important thing engineers
should get out of their college
training, Rambo said, is "the in
quisitiveness and the curiosity
necessary so that you will be
able to adapt to such situa
tions."
Because of such variety in en
gineering jobs, "I still don't
have a pat set of answers as to
what you'll find when you go
to work, go out into the field,"
he told the students.
Rambo, who led a seminar
on the social content of engi
neering last quarter, noted
that the engineer today must
not only be capable of han
dling varied and sometimes
unfamiliar technical prob
lems, but also will have to be
able to deal with people on
many levels.

In the project he used as an
example, Rambo worked with
officials from several govern
ment agencies, including the
State Department, and airline
officials and pilots, as well as
technicians and other engineers.
"This project opened up areas
of enormous difficulties of an
engineer talking to government
officials" and getting them to
agree with the results and act
on them, he said.
The difficulty arose, Rambo
noted, from trying to explain the
solution of a technical problem
to someone who is not technic
ally oriented.
"This presents problems to
engineers than cannot be
taught in a university," he
said.
The engineering students who
were initiated into Stanford's
chapter, California Gamma, are
Tore Abrahamsen, Ronald
Brown, Gaynor Dawson, Rich
ard Flower, David Gilmer, Alan
Hanson, Christopher Johnson,
Ernest Manuel, Donald March,
Nicholas Moll, Ulf Motzfeldt,
Franklin Orr, Peter Senge, Hal
Stoll, and Patrick Sullivan.
Engineering can be "dramat
ic, exciting, and rewarding" a
group of engineering honor stu
dents were told Saturday night,
while being urged to search for
such experiences in their ca
reers.
The speaker was William
Rambo, associate dean of engi
neering for research and direc
tor of the Stanford Electronic
Laboratories, who spoke at the
initiation banquet of Stanford's
Tau Beta Pi chapter.
Tau Beta Pi is the national
engineering honorary society.
"If you go into a career and
don't find these things—don't
find engineering dramatic, ex
citing, rewarding—maybe you
should change, or you should
change your job," Rambo told
the group.
"And my advice is that you
don't hesitate to change either
one," he added.
