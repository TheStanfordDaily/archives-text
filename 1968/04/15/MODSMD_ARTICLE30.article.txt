Who was the greatest of the English Romantic Poets-
Byron, Shelley or Keats? This question has given rise to
many lively campus discussions and not a few stabbings.
Let us today try to find an answer.
First, Keats (or The Louisville Slugger, as he is com
monly called.) Keats' talent bloomed early. While still a
schoolboy at St. Swithin's he wrote his epic lines:
If 1 am flood 1 get an apple.
So I don't whistle in the chapel.
From this distinguished beginning he went on to write
another -10 million poems, an achievement all the more re
markable when you consider that he was only five feet
tall! I mention this fact only to show that physical prob
lems never keep the true artist from creating. Byron, for
example, was lame. Shelley suffered from prickly heat all
winter long. Nonetheless, these three titans of literature
never stopped writing poetry for one day.
Nor did they neglect their personal lives. Byron, a devil
with the ladies, was expelled from Oxford for dipping
Nell Gwynne's pigtails in an inkwell. (This later became
known as Guy Fawkes Day.) lie left England to fight in
the Greek war of independence. He fought bravely and
well, but women were never far from his mind, as evi
denced by these immortal lines:
How splendid it is to fit/lit for the Greek,
But 1 don't enjoy it half as much as dancing cheek to
cheek.
While Byron fought in Greece, Shelley stayed in Eng
land, where he became razor sharpener to the Duke of
Gloucester. Shelley was happy in his work, as we know
from his classic poem, Hail to thee, blithe strop, but no
matter how he tried he was never able to get a proper edge
on the Duke's razor, and he was soon banished to
Coventry. (This later became known as The Industrial
Revolution.)
One wonders how Shelley's life—and the course of Eng
lish poetry—would have differed if Personna Super Stain
less Steel Blades had been invented 200 years earlier. For
Personna is a blade that needs no stropping, honing or
whetting. It's sharp when you get it, and sharp it stays
through shave after luxury shave. Here truly is a blade
fit for a Duke or a freshman. Moreover, this Personna,
this jewel of the blade-maker's art, this boon to the cheek
and bounty to the dewlap, comes to you both in double
edge style and Injector style. Get some now during "Be
Kind to Your Kisser Week."
But I digress. Byron, 1 say, was in Greece and Shelley
in England. Meanwhile Keats went to Rome to try to
grow. Who does not remember his wistful lyric:
Although I am only five feet high,
Some day I will look in an elephant's eye.
But Keats did not grow. His friends, Shelley and Byron,
touched to the heart, rushed to Rome to stretch him. This
too failed. Then Byron, ever the ladies man, took up with
Lucrezia Borgia, Catherine of Aragon, and Annie Oakley.
Shelley, a more domestic type, stayed home with his wife
Mary and wrote his famous poem :
1 love to stay home with the missus and write,
And hug her and kiss her and give her a bite.

Mary Shelley finally got so tired of being bitten that
she went into another room and wrote Frankenstein.
Upon reading the manuscript, Shelley and Byron got so
scared they immediately booked passage home to Eng
land. Keats tried to go too, but he was so small that the
clerk at the steamship office couldn't see him over the top
of the counter. So Keats remained in Rome and died of
shortness.
Byron and Shelley cried a lot and then together com
posed this immortal epitaph:
Good old Keats, he wight have hern short,
But he was a great A werican and a heck of a good sport.
* * * Mu* Shulmiin
Truth, not poetry, is the concern of Personna, arnl tee
tell yon truly that you'll not fitul a better shaving com
bination than Personna and lturm<i-Shave, regular or
menthol.

Who was the greatest of the English Romantic Poets-
Byron, Shelley or Keats? This question has given rise to
many lively campus discussions and not a few stabbings.
Let us today try to find an answer.
First, Keats (or The Louisville Slugger, as he is com
monly called.) Keats' talent bloomed early. While still a
schoolboy at St. Swithin's he wrote his epic lines:
If 1 am flood 1 get an apple.
So I don't whistle in the chapel.
From this distinguished beginning he went on to write
another -10 million poems, an achievement all the more re
markable when you consider that he was only five feet
tall! I mention this fact only to show that physical prob
lems never keep the true artist from creating. Byron, for
example, was lame. Shelley suffered from prickly heat all
winter long. Nonetheless, these three titans of literature
never stopped writing poetry for one day.
Nor did they neglect their personal lives. Byron, a devil
with the ladies, was expelled from Oxford for dipping
Nell Gwynne's pigtails in an inkwell. (This later became
known as Guy Fawkes Day.) lie left England to fight in
the Greek war of independence. He fought bravely and
well, but women were never far from his mind, as evi
denced by these immortal lines:
How splendid it is to fit/lit for the Greek,
But 1 don't enjoy it half as much as dancing cheek to
cheek.
While Byron fought in Greece, Shelley stayed in Eng
land, where he became razor sharpener to the Duke of
Gloucester. Shelley was happy in his work, as we know
from his classic poem, Hail to thee, blithe strop, but no
matter how he tried he was never able to get a proper edge
on the Duke's razor, and he was soon banished to
Coventry. (This later became known as The Industrial
Revolution.)
One wonders how Shelley's life—and the course of Eng
lish poetry—would have differed if Personna Super Stain
less Steel Blades had been invented 200 years earlier. For
Personna is a blade that needs no stropping, honing or
whetting. It's sharp when you get it, and sharp it stays
through shave after luxury shave. Here truly is a blade
fit for a Duke or a freshman. Moreover, this Personna,
this jewel of the blade-maker's art, this boon to the cheek
and bounty to the dewlap, comes to you both in double
edge style and Injector style. Get some now during "Be
Kind to Your Kisser Week."
But I digress. Byron, 1 say, was in Greece and Shelley
in England. Meanwhile Keats went to Rome to try to
grow. Who does not remember his wistful lyric:
Although I am only five feet high,
Some day I will look in an elephant's eye.
But Keats did not grow. His friends, Shelley and Byron,
touched to the heart, rushed to Rome to stretch him. This
too failed. Then Byron, ever the ladies man, took up with
Lucrezia Borgia, Catherine of Aragon, and Annie Oakley.
Shelley, a more domestic type, stayed home with his wife
Mary and wrote his famous poem :
1 love to stay home with the missus and write,
And hug her and kiss her and give her a bite.

Mary Shelley finally got so tired of being bitten that
she went into another room and wrote Frankenstein.
Upon reading the manuscript, Shelley and Byron got so
scared they immediately booked passage home to Eng
land. Keats tried to go too, but he was so small that the
clerk at the steamship office couldn't see him over the top
of the counter. So Keats remained in Rome and died of
