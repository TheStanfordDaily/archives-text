For RFK Boost
WASHINGTON (AP) —Rob
ert S. McNamara prompted a
demand Sunday that he resign
as he broke the nonpolitical tra
dition of his World Bank presi
dency to promote presidential
hopeful Robert F. Kennedy.
The demand came from Sen.
Thruston B. Morton, R-Ky., aft
er Kennedy campaign head
quarters released the text of a
television tape in which the for
mer secretary of defense praised
Kennedy's role in the 1962
Cuban crisis.
Although McNamara did not
give Kennedy an outright en
dorsement, he used such words
as "energy, courage, compas

• Young Slums Stokely
WASHINGTON (AP)—Negro
Leader Whitney M. Young Jr.,
said Sunday the masses of
Negroes viewing the riot dam
age in America's cities feel
"they need a Stokely Carmi
ehael like they need a hole in
the head."
And Young said the Black
Power advocate's following is

minimal, accusing the news me
dia of building up Carmiehael,
projecting him and maintaining
his image.
"His following right now
amounts to about 50 Negroes
and about 5,000 white reporters
—newspaper, television and ra
dio reporters. They have created
him. There is no organization;
there is no following. They have
projected him and this has kept
him alive," Young said.
• King Suspect Hunted
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) —
Federal agents have scoured
this city showing sketches of a
man's face and asking about the
name Eric Starvo Gait, the
mystreious object of a hunt
linked to the probe of Dr. Mar
tin Luther King Jr.'s assassina
tion.
What the agents have learned
or what they want with Gait is a
tightly kept FBI secret. "No
comment," is all the FBI will
say. Not even the local police
have beon asked to help in Bir
mingham.
Some key sources have been
told by the FBI not to discuss
their knowledge of Gait with
anyone. The FBI has collected
the records of a rooming house,
seized a car with an Alabama
tag sold to Gait, and issued for
four hours an alert for Gait in
Florida.
