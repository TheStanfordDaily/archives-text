# Lyman Clarifies BSU Agreement
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Provost Richard W. Lyman
said today that the agreement
with the Black Student Union
doesn't mean "the power to make
decisions in academic matters
(has) been delegated to any
group of students."
As he assured the Academic
Council Thursday, Lyman main
tains that "the steps being taken
in no way change or diminish
the authority of the faculty in
academic matters."
Lyman also sought to clear
up a "misinterpretation" of the
position of Associate Provost
Robert H. Rosenzweig, the Uni
versity's chief officer for minor
ity group affairs.
Rosenzweig's "authority in
that area has not been and will
not be changed or diminished,"

Lyman says in a statement re
leased today. The new "Coordi
nator of Intergroup Relations"
will work "with," Rosenzweig,
he emphasizes.
Black students will act as
"consultants" in the search for
a man to hire as the Coordina
tor, according to the agreement
issued Thursday after a two
hour meeting between admini
strators and BSU representa
tives. His responsibilities will
include "liaison with the Black
Student Union and other minor
ity groups."
The Coordinator "will work
for the University with Associ
ate Provost Robert Rosenzweig,
the Human Relations Commis
sion, and relevant groups," ac
cording to the wording of Thurs
day's memorandum, signed by
Lyman.
After issuing that memo
randum, Lyman told the Aca
demic Council to "prepare to!
stand fast when the inevit
able backlash comes from so
ciety."
An aide called today's state
ment a "clarification" of what
Lyman announced Thursday.
"Inaccurate reporting in local
newspapers" made the clarifica
tion necessary, according to the
statement.
One newspaper, the San Jose
Mercury, announced the agree
ment with the headline, "Rosen
sweig Relieved of Duties, Stan
ford Bows to BSU."
The Mercury story reported
that this meant "removing one
high level administrator from
sensitive race relations duties
and letting BSU members help
admit freshmen for the 1969-70
academic year."

Lyman suggests in his state
ment today that such reporting
"obscured" the issues.
Charles Countee, BSU co
chairman, told the DAILY
last night that he believed all
the BSU demands had been'
met. He had no comment on
the status of Rosenzweig.
Thursday's agreement does
not let the BSU admit freshmen,
but it does "ask the BSU to as
sist in recruiting the pool of
students" from which ten "mar
ginal" minority-group students
will be chosen. It also promises
to hire "several" black students
to work as "admissions aides"
to help recruiting new students.
Lyman calls Rosenzweig an
"able and dedicated officer of
the University." The dispute
"goes far beyond the issue of
confidence in and support for
an able and dedicated officer of
the University," Lyman asserts.
"The immediate issue aside,
if the University once yields to
pressure to discharge or demean
any member of its staff," Lyman
says, "then no member of the
University . . . can be safe from
the attack of any group that can
muster a sufficient show of
force."
"The princicple that com
mands resistance to such pres
sure . . . has in no way been
compromised," Lyman saysj
Rosenzweig, associate pro
vost since September, works
mostly on the Center for Re
search in International Studies.
He does general work as a mem
ber of the provost's staff, in ad
dition to handling minority
group affairs.
