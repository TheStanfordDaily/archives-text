# Lyman Clarifies BSU Agreement
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Provost Richard W. Lyman
said today that the agreement
with the Black Student Union
doesn't mean "the power to make
decisions in academic matters
(has) been delegated to any
group of students."
As he assured the Academic
Council Thursday, Lyman main
tains that "the steps being taken
in no way change or diminish
the authority of the faculty in
academic matters."
Lyman also sought to clear
up a "misinterpretation" of the
position of Associate Provost
Robert H. Rosenzweig, the Uni
versity's chief officer for minor
ity group affairs.
Rosenzweig's "authority in
that area has not been and will
not be changed or diminished,"

Lyman says in a statement re
leased today. The new "Coordi
nator of Intergroup Relations"
will work "with," Rosenzweig,
he emphasizes.
Black students will act as
"consultants" in the search for
a man to hire as the Coordina
tor, according to the agreement
issued Thursday after a two
hour meeting between admini
strators and BSU representa
tives. His responsibilities will
include "liaison with the Black
Student Union and other minor
ity groups."
The Coordinator "will work
for the University with Associ
ate Provost Robert Rosenzweig,
the Human Relations Commis
sion, and relevant groups," ac
cording to the wording of Thurs
day's memorandum, signed by
Lyman.
After issuing that memo
randum, Lyman told the Aca
demic Council to "prepare to!
stand fast when the inevit
able backlash comes from so
ciety."
An aide called today's state
ment a "clarification" of what
Lyman announced Thursday.
"Inaccurate reporting in local
newspapers" made the clarifica
tion necessary, according to the
statement.
One newspaper, the San Jose
Mercury, announced the agree
ment with the headline, "Rosen
sweig Relieved of Duties, Stan
ford Bows to BSU."
The Mercury story reported
that this meant "removing one
high level administrator from
sensitive race relations duties
and letting BSU members help
admit freshmen for the 1969-70
academic year."

Lyman suggests in his state
ment today that such reporting
"obscured" the issues.
Charles Countee, BSU co
chairman, told the DAILY
last night that he believed all
the BSU demands had been'
met. He had no comment on
the status of Rosenzweig.
Thursday's agreement does
not let the BSU admit freshmen,
but it does "ask the BSU to as
sist in recruiting the pool of
students" from which ten "mar
ginal" minority-group students
will be chosen. It also promises
to hire "several" black students
to work as "admissions aides"
to help recruiting new students.
Lyman calls Rosenzweig an
"able and dedicated officer of
the University." The dispute
"goes far beyond the issue of
confidence in and support for
an able and dedicated officer of
the University," Lyman asserts.
"The immediate issue aside,
if the University once yields to
pressure to discharge or demean
any member of its staff," Lyman
says, "then no member of the
University . . . can be safe from
the attack of any group that can
muster a sufficient show of
force."
"The princicple that com
mands resistance to such pres
sure . . . has in no way been
compromised," Lyman saysj
Rosenzweig, associate pro
vost since September, works
mostly on the Center for Re
search in International Studies.
He does general work as a mem
ber of the provost's staff, in ad
dition to handling minority
group affairs.
His dismissal from the mi
nority affairs duties was first de
manded last month by the East
Palo Alto Day School, which
charged foot-dragging in an in
vestigation by Rosenzweig of
an incident March 9 at the Tre
sidder Drug Store.
The demand was repeated a
week ago by the Black Student
Union as part of a long list of
proposals on admissions, em
ployment and other minority
group issues.
The University and the BSU
reached agreement on the pro
posals after a hectic series of
meetings last week. Stanford
promised to double minority
group enrollment by 1969-70 to
about 350 students, and double
the proportion of employees
from minority groups. The Aca
demic Council recommended
Thursday that departments pro
vide "whatever supplementary
instruction is necessary" to
carry out tutoring or new
courses to black people.
Financial aid and other costs
of the programs could reach $1.2
million, President Wallace Ster
ling told the Council.
Representatives from the
administration and BSU will
meet again tomorrow at 2
p.m. to continue discussion of
(lie nine-member Human Re
lations Commission and other
projects.
Today Lyman will speak on
Stanford efforts in minority
group affairs at a 4 p.m. meet
ing of Senior Fund Volunteers
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The text of Lyman's state
ment follows:
"Two aspects of the events of
last week have been obscured
through inaccurate reporting in
local newspapers (not, I am hap
py to say, the Daily). First, it
is important and extremely use
ful that minority group students

be involved and consulted in de
cisions affecting their lives at
Stanford, and steps have been
taken this week to achieve that
end. But at no point, contrary
to some press reports, has the
power to make decisions in aca
demic matters been delegated
to any group of students, nor
has a power of veto been
granted any such group. The
steps being taken in no way
change or diminish the author
ity of the faculty in academic
matters.
"The other point that has been
subjected to misinterpretation
concerns the position of Associ
ate Provost Robert M. Rosen
zweig. Since September of 1967
he has been the member of the
Provost's Staff chiefly concerned
with minority-group affairs. His
authority in that area has not
and will not be changed or di
minished. That area of concern
obviously requires additional
staffing and a search has begun
to find a full-time Coordinator
of Inter-Group Relations to
work with Dr. Rosenzweig.
"I want to emphasize this
point, because it goes far be
yond the issue of confidence in
and support for an able and
dedicated officer of the Univers
ity. That immediate issue aside,
if the University once yields to
pressure to discharge or de
mean any member of its staff,
then no member of the Univers
ity—be he professor, student, or
administrator —can be safe from
the attack of any group that can
muster a sufficient show of
force.
"The principle that commands
resistance to such pressure has
been under attack many times
in the past and will be assaulted
many times in the future. That
principle has in no way been
compromised."

nority affairs duties was first de
manded last month by the East
Palo Alto Day School, which
charged foot-dragging in an in
vestigation by Rosenzweig of
an incident March 9 at the Tre
sidder Drug Store.
The demand was repeated a
week ago by the Black Student
Union as part of a long list of
proposals on admissions, em
ployment and other minority
group issues.
The University and the BSU
reached agreement on the pro
posals after a hectic series of
meetings last week. Stanford
promised to double minority
group enrollment by 1969-70 to
about 350 students, and double
the proportion of employees
from minority groups. The Aca
demic Council recommended
Thursday that departments pro
vide "whatever supplementary
instruction is necessary" to
carry out tutoring or new
courses to black people.
Financial aid and other costs
of the programs could reach $1.2
million, President Wallace Ster
ling told the Council.
Representatives from the
administration and BSU will
meet again tomorrow at 2
p.m. to continue discussion of
(lie nine-member Human Re
lations Commission and other
projects.
Today Lyman will speak on
Stanford efforts in minority
group affairs at a 4 p.m. meet
ing of Senior Fund Volunteers
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The text of Lyman's state
ment follows:
"Two aspects of the events of
last week have been obscured
through inaccurate reporting in
local newspapers (not, I am hap
py to say, the Daily). First, it
is important and extremely use
ful that minority group students

be involved and consulted in de
cisions affecting their lives at
Stanford, and steps have been
taken this week to achieve that
end. But at no point, contrary
to some press reports, has the
power to make decisions in aca
demic matters been delegated
to any group of students, nor
has a power of veto been
granted any such group. The
steps being taken in no way
change or diminish the author
ity of the faculty in academic
matters.
"The other point that has been
subjected to misinterpretation
concerns the position of Associ
ate Provost Robert M. Rosen
zweig. Since September of 1967
he has been the member of the
Provost's Staff chiefly concerned
with minority-group affairs. His
authority in that area has not
and will not be changed or di
minished. That area of concern
obviously requires additional
staffing and a search has begun
to find a full-time Coordinator
of Inter-Group Relations to
work with Dr. Rosenzweig.
"I want to emphasize this
point, because it goes far be
yond the issue of confidence in
and support for an able and
dedicated officer of the Univers
ity. That immediate issue aside,
if the University once yields to
pressure to discharge or de
mean any member of its staff,
then no member of the Univers
ity—be he professor, student, or
administrator —can be safe from
the attack of any group that can
muster a sufficient show of
force.
"The principle that commands
resistance to such pressure has
been under attack many times
in the past and will be assaulted
many times in the future. That
principle has in no way been
compromised."
RICHARD W. LYMAN
April 15,1968
Provost Richard W. Lyman
said today that the agreement
with the Black Student Union
doesn't mean "the power to make
decisions in academic matters
(has) been delegated to any
group of students."
As he assured the Academic
Council Thursday, Lyman main
tains that "the steps being taken
in no way change or diminish
the authority of the faculty in
academic matters."
Lyman also sought to clear
up a "misinterpretation" of the
position of Associate Provost
Robert H. Rosenzweig, the Uni
versity's chief officer for minor
ity group affairs.
Rosenzweig's "authority in
that area has not been and will
not be changed or diminished,"

Lyman says in a statement re
leased today. The new "Coordi
nator of Intergroup Relations"
will work "with," Rosenzweig,
he emphasizes.
Black students will act as
"consultants" in the search for
a man to hire as the Coordina
tor, according to the agreement
issued Thursday after a two
hour meeting between admini
strators and BSU representa
tives. His responsibilities will
include "liaison with the Black
Student Union and other minor
ity groups."
The Coordinator "will work
for the University with Associ
ate Provost Robert Rosenzweig,
the Human Relations Commis
sion, and relevant groups," ac
cording to the wording of Thurs
day's memorandum, signed by
Lyman.
After issuing that memo
randum, Lyman told the Aca
demic Council to "prepare to!
stand fast when the inevit
able backlash comes from so
ciety."
An aide called today's state
ment a "clarification" of what
Lyman announced Thursday.
"Inaccurate reporting in local
newspapers" made the clarifica
tion necessary, according to the
statement.
One newspaper, the San Jose
Mercury, announced the agree
ment with the headline, "Rosen
sweig Relieved of Duties, Stan
ford Bows to BSU."
The Mercury story reported
that this meant "removing one
high level administrator from
sensitive race relations duties
and letting BSU members help
admit freshmen for the 1969-70
academic year."

Lyman suggests in his state
ment today that such reporting
"obscured" the issues.
Charles Countee, BSU co
chairman, told the DAILY
last night that he believed all
the BSU demands had been'
met. He had no comment on
the status of Rosenzweig.
Thursday's agreement does
not let the BSU admit freshmen,
but it does "ask the BSU to as
sist in recruiting the pool of
students" from which ten "mar
ginal" minority-group students
will be chosen. It also promises
to hire "several" black students
to work as "admissions aides"
to help recruiting new students.
Lyman calls Rosenzweig an
"able and dedicated officer of
the University." The dispute
"goes far beyond the issue of
confidence in and support for
an able and dedicated officer of
the University," Lyman asserts.
"The immediate issue aside,
if the University once yields to
pressure to discharge or demean
any member of its staff," Lyman
says, "then no member of the
University . . . can be safe from
the attack of any group that can
muster a sufficient show of
force."
"The princicple that com
mands resistance to such pres
sure . . . has in no way been
compromised," Lyman saysj
Rosenzweig, associate pro
vost since September, works
mostly on the Center for Re
search in International Studies.
He does general work as a mem
ber of the provost's staff, in ad
dition to handling minority
group affairs.
His dismissal from the mi

Lyman also sought to clear
up a "misinterpretation" of the
position of Associate Provost
Robert H. Rosenzweig, the Uni
versity's chief officer for minor
ity group affairs.
Rosenzweig's "authority in
that area has not been and will
not be changed or diminished,"

Lyman says in a statement re
leased today. The new "Coordi
nator of Intergroup Relations"
will work "with," Rosenzweig,
he emphasizes.
Black students will act as
"consultants" in the search for
a man to hire as the Coordina
tor, according to the agreement
issued Thursday after a two
hour meeting between admini
strators and BSU representa
tives. His responsibilities will
include "liaison with the Black
Student Union and other minor
ity groups."
The Coordinator "will work
for the University with Associ
ate Provost Robert Rosenzweig,
the Human Relations Commis
sion, and relevant groups," ac
cording to the wording of Thurs
day's memorandum, signed by
Lyman.
After issuing that memo
randum, Lyman told the Aca
demic Council to "prepare to!
stand fast when the inevit
able backlash comes from so
ciety."
An aide called today's state
ment a "clarification" of what
Lyman announced Thursday.
"Inaccurate reporting in local
newspapers" made the clarifica
tion necessary, according to the
statement.
One newspaper, the San Jose
Mercury, announced the agree
ment with the headline, "Rosen
sweig Relieved of Duties, Stan
ford Bows to BSU."
The Mercury story reported
that this meant "removing one
high level administrator from
sensitive race relations duties
and letting BSU members help
admit freshmen for the 1969-70
academic year."

Lyman suggests in his state
ment today that such reporting
"obscured" the issues.
Charles Countee, BSU co
chairman, told the DAILY
last night that he believed all
the BSU demands had been'
met. He had no comment on
the status of Rosenzweig.
Thursday's agreement does
not let the BSU admit freshmen,
but it does "ask the BSU to as
sist in recruiting the pool of
students" from which ten "mar
ginal" minority-group students
will be chosen. It also promises
to hire "several" black students
to work as "admissions aides"
to help recruiting new students.
Lyman calls Rosenzweig an
"able and dedicated officer of
the University." The dispute
"goes far beyond the issue of
confidence in and support for
an able and dedicated officer of
the University," Lyman asserts.
"The immediate issue aside,
if the University once yields to
pressure to discharge or demean
any member of its staff," Lyman
says, "then no member of the
University . . . can be safe from
the attack of any group that can
muster a sufficient show of
force."
"The princicple that com
mands resistance to such pres
sure . . . has in no way been
compromised," Lyman saysj
Rosenzweig, associate pro
vost since September, works
mostly on the Center for Re
search in International Studies.
He does general work as a mem
ber of the provost's staff, in ad
dition to handling minority
group affairs.
His dismissal from the mi
nority affairs duties was first de
manded last month by the East
Palo Alto Day School, which
charged foot-dragging in an in
vestigation by Rosenzweig of
an incident March 9 at the Tre
sidder Drug Store.
The demand was repeated a
week ago by the Black Student
Union as part of a long list of
proposals on admissions, em
ployment and other minority
group issues.
The University and the BSU
reached agreement on the pro
posals after a hectic series of
meetings last week. Stanford
promised to double minority
group enrollment by 1969-70 to
about 350 students, and double
the proportion of employees
from minority groups. The Aca
demic Council recommended
Thursday that departments pro
vide "whatever supplementary
instruction is necessary" to
carry out tutoring or new
courses to black people.
Financial aid and other costs
of the programs could reach $1.2
million, President Wallace Ster
ling told the Council.
Representatives from the
administration and BSU will
meet again tomorrow at 2
p.m. to continue discussion of
(lie nine-member Human Re
lations Commission and other
projects.
Today Lyman will speak on
Stanford efforts in minority
group affairs at a 4 p.m. meet
ing of Senior Fund Volunteers
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The text of Lyman's state
ment follows:
"Two aspects of the events of
last week have been obscured
through inaccurate reporting in
local newspapers (not, I am hap
py to say, the Daily). First, it
is important and extremely use
ful that minority group students

be involved and consulted in de
cisions affecting their lives at
Stanford, and steps have been
taken this week to achieve that
end. But at no point, contrary
to some press reports, has the
power to make decisions in aca
demic matters been delegated
to any group of students, nor
has a power of veto been
granted any such group. The
steps being taken in no way
change or diminish the author
ity of the faculty in academic
matters.
"The other point that has been
subjected to misinterpretation
concerns the position of Associ
ate Provost Robert M. Rosen
zweig. Since September of 1967
he has been the member of the
Provost's Staff chiefly concerned
with minority-group affairs. His
authority in that area has not
and will not be changed or di
minished. That area of concern
obviously requires additional
staffing and a search has begun
to find a full-time Coordinator
of Inter-Group Relations to
work with Dr. Rosenzweig.
"I want to emphasize this
point, because it goes far be
yond the issue of confidence in
and support for an able and
dedicated officer of the Univers
ity. That immediate issue aside,
if the University once yields to
pressure to discharge or de
mean any member of its staff,
then no member of the Univers
ity—be he professor, student, or
administrator —can be safe from
the attack of any group that can
muster a sufficient show of
force.
"The principle that commands
resistance to such pressure has
been under attack many times
in the past and will be assaulted
many times in the future. That
principle has in no way been
compromised."

The University and the BSU
reached agreement on the pro
posals after a hectic series of
meetings last week. Stanford
promised to double minority
group enrollment by 1969-70 to
about 350 students, and double
the proportion of employees
from minority groups. The Aca
demic Council recommended
Thursday that departments pro
vide "whatever supplementary
instruction is necessary" to
carry out tutoring or new
courses to black people.
Financial aid and other costs
of the programs could reach $1.2
million, President Wallace Ster
ling told the Council.
Representatives from the
administration and BSU will
meet again tomorrow at 2
p.m. to continue discussion of
(lie nine-member Human Re
lations Commission and other
projects.
Today Lyman will speak on
Stanford efforts in minority
group affairs at a 4 p.m. meet
ing of Senior Fund Volunteers
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The text of Lyman's state
ment follows:
"Two aspects of the events of
last week have been obscured
through inaccurate reporting in
local newspapers (not, I am hap
py to say, the Daily). First, it
is important and extremely use
ful that minority group students

be involved and consulted in de
cisions affecting their lives at
Stanford, and steps have been
taken this week to achieve that
end. But at no point, contrary
to some press reports, has the
power to make decisions in aca
demic matters been delegated
to any group of students, nor
has a power of veto been
granted any such group. The
steps being taken in no way
change or diminish the author
ity of the faculty in academic
matters.
"The other point that has been
subjected to misinterpretation
concerns the position of Associ
ate Provost Robert M. Rosen
zweig. Since September of 1967
he has been the member of the
Provost's Staff chiefly concerned
with minority-group affairs. His
authority in that area has not
and will not be changed or di
minished. That area of concern
obviously requires additional
staffing and a search has begun
to find a full-time Coordinator
of Inter-Group Relations to
work with Dr. Rosenzweig.
"I want to emphasize this
point, because it goes far be
yond the issue of confidence in
and support for an able and
dedicated officer of the Univers
ity. That immediate issue aside,
if the University once yields to
pressure to discharge or de
mean any member of its staff,
then no member of the Univers
ity—be he professor, student, or
administrator —can be safe from
the attack of any group that can
muster a sufficient show of
force.
"The principle that commands
resistance to such pressure has
been under attack many times
in the past and will be assaulted
many times in the future. That
principle has in no way been
compromised."

Provost Richard W. Lyman
said today that the agreement
with the Black Student Union
doesn't mean "the power to make
decisions in academic matters
(has) been delegated to any
group of students."
As he assured the Academic
Council Thursday, Lyman main
tains that "the steps being taken
in no way change or diminish
the authority of the faculty in
academic matters."
Lyman also sought to clear
up a "misinterpretation" of the
position of Associate Provost
Robert H. Rosenzweig, the Uni
versity's chief officer for minor
ity group affairs.
Rosenzweig's "authority in
that area has not been and will
not be changed or diminished,"

Lyman says in a statement re
leased today. The new "Coordi
nator of Intergroup Relations"
will work "with," Rosenzweig,
he emphasizes.
Black students will act as
"consultants" in the search for
a man to hire as the Coordina
tor, according to the agreement
issued Thursday after a two
hour meeting between admini
strators and BSU representa
tives. His responsibilities will
include "liaison with the Black
Student Union and other minor
ity groups."
The Coordinator "will work
for the University with Associ
ate Provost Robert Rosenzweig,
the Human Relations Commis
sion, and relevant groups," ac
cording to the wording of Thurs
day's memorandum, signed by
Lyman.
After issuing that memo
randum, Lyman told the Aca
demic Council to "prepare to!
stand fast when the inevit
able backlash comes from so
ciety."
An aide called today's state
ment a "clarification" of what
Lyman announced Thursday.
"Inaccurate reporting in local
newspapers" made the clarifica
tion necessary, according to the
statement.
One newspaper, the San Jose
Mercury, announced the agree
ment with the headline, "Rosen
sweig Relieved of Duties, Stan
ford Bows to BSU."
The Mercury story reported
that this meant "removing one
high level administrator from
sensitive race relations duties
and letting BSU members help
admit freshmen for the 1969-70
academic year."

Lyman suggests in his state
ment today that such reporting
"obscured" the issues.
Charles Countee, BSU co
chairman, told the DAILY
last night that he believed all
the BSU demands had been'
met. He had no comment on
the status of Rosenzweig.
Thursday's agreement does
not let the BSU admit freshmen,
but it does "ask the BSU to as
sist in recruiting the pool of
students" from which ten "mar
ginal" minority-group students
will be chosen. It also promises
to hire "several" black students
to work as "admissions aides"
to help recruiting new students.
Lyman calls Rosenzweig an
"able and dedicated officer of
the University." The dispute
"goes far beyond the issue of
confidence in and support for
an able and dedicated officer of
the University," Lyman asserts.
"The immediate issue aside,
if the University once yields to
pressure to discharge or demean
any member of its staff," Lyman
says, "then no member of the
University . . . can be safe from
the attack of any group that can
muster a sufficient show of
force."
"The princicple that com
mands resistance to such pres
sure . . . has in no way been
compromised," Lyman saysj
Rosenzweig, associate pro
vost since September, works
mostly on the Center for Re
search in International Studies.
He does general work as a mem
ber of the provost's staff, in ad
dition to handling minority
group affairs.
His dismissal from the mi
nority affairs duties was first de
manded last month by the East
Palo Alto Day School, which
charged foot-dragging in an in
vestigation by Rosenzweig of
an incident March 9 at the Tre
sidder Drug Store.
The demand was repeated a
week ago by the Black Student
Union as part of a long list of
proposals on admissions, em
ployment and other minority
group issues.
