# Judicial Council Ruling
## Parking Fines Void? 
### 
The student judicial council
decided Friday that the Univer
sity can't force students to pay
parking tickets while it allows
hundreds of faculty and staff
to ignore parking fines.
"University parking and traf
fic regulations, in application,
deny to students the equal pro
tection of the laws," the council
argues in the case of law stu
dent Gil Berkeley. "Such regu
lations, until such time as a
mechanism is established for
the collection of fines owing by
faculty and staff, are wholly un
enforceable as to students."
The ten-member judicial coun
cil has been hearing about six
appeals of parking citations a
week, according to chairman
Richard Such. All future appeals
will be upheld, Such said, until
the University tries to collect
faculty and staff tickets.
Students who don't pay park
ing fines issued by Stanford po
lice can't register for the next
quarter, the judicial council
pointed out. But "no mechanism
exists for the collection of fines
incurred by faculty and staff."
As a result, about 800 unpaid
tickets issued to University em
ployees are outstanding since
last September, the council said.
Two of the citations were given
to law professors.
The information came from
Assistant Chief of Police Thomas
Bell, the council's decision said.
Bell told Such Thursday that
no new action had been taken
to collect those unpaid fines.
Such believes the police have
been giving out more parking
tickets in recent months. He
makes this estimate by the num

ber of appeals which come to
the judicial council.
In effect the council has in
validated University parking
regulations until the University
sets up some "mechanism" to
enforce payment of faculty and
staff fines. Such didn't suggest
how this could be done, but he
did point out that the Univer
sity can withhold offenders' pay
checks.
Dean of Students Joel Smith
said yesterday that he is study
ing the council decision. Al
though dubious about the coun
cil's "authority to invalidate"
any University regulation, he
admitted "we don't have an
equitable system" to collect park
ing fines. "I think we should,"
Smith added.
Several University officials
have been presented proposals
to enforce payment of parking
fines by employees, Smith said.
The system for collecting on
students' tickets isn't very effi
cient either, Smith pointed out.
"Several thousand dollars" in
unpaid student fines are out
standing. After several days an
unpaid parking fine becomes $5.
Smith and the judicial coun
cil have been at odds over stu
dent power ail year. Most re
cently the judicial council ac
quitted nine students Smith was
prosecuting for violation of the
University demonstrations pol
icy during a protest against CIA
recruiting Nov. 1. In that deci
sion the council declared the
demonstrations policy invalid.
Smith responded by denying
the council's authority to in
validate University regulations.
He said yesterday he has asked

Prof. Howard Williams, chair
man of the all-faculty Interim
Judicial Body (IJB), to sche
dule a new trial of the nine de
fendents.
The judicial council and its
parent organization, the Associ
ated Students, refuse to recog
nize the jurisdiction of the IJB.
This fundamental dispute is be
ing negotiated in the Commit
tee of Fifteen, a high-level group
of faculty, students and admin
istrators.
In response to the judicial
council's latest decision, Smith
said he hasn't yet decided wheth
er to bypass the judicial coun
cil to enforce parking fines.
There are no clear precedents,
Smith said, but conceivably ap
peals of parking fines could go
to the IJB.
The council's derision claims
that: "The disparity between the
enforcement of the collection of
fines as against students and the
non-enforcement of such collec
tions as against faculty and staff
differs in practical effect only
slightly from the disparity which
would exist if University regu
lations provided that citations
for traffic and parking offenses
were to be issued to students
but not to teachers and admini
strative personnel."
Furthermore, the council ar
gues, a policy of issuing cita
tions only to students "would
be to deny to students the equal
council cites its opinion on the
demonstrations policy in dis
cussing this point.
The decision overruled a tick
et given to Gil Berkeley on Feb.
29 in a red zone outside Hoskins
House.


THE TICKET this officer is issuing may never be paid for if the student judicial council ruling sticks,
