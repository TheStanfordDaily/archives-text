Those who yeam for a peaceful status quo will be dismayed to
learn that the small revolution underway to create a black com
munity at Stanford isn't the sort of controversy that flares up
momentarily, only to be extinguished in a dusty file folder.
The Thursday agreement between the administration and Black
Student Union set up structures and a timetable that can bring
rapid progress to Stanford — or they can bring an unending
series of disagreements, crises and confrontations. The two parties
have commited themselves to working together: black students
will serve as admission aides, members of the Human Relations
Commission, and in a variety of consultant roles. The Univer
sity has agreed to keep the BSU fully informed of its minority
group policies, even to the extent of publishing information on
the groups for accepting or rejecting black students who apply
for admission.
If the bureaucracy is to continue to function with so unfamiliar
a species as a black radical lodged in it, all parties will have to
exert a good deal of staying power. But if faculty and admini
strators slip into an adversary relationship to the black students,
thinking of tactics to delay and dilute instead of common goals,
the blacks will walk out. On the other hand, if the black stu
dents fail to perform the heavy work load they've agreed to, they
will be vanquished by bureaucratic inertia.
It would be incorrect to say that in dealings with the University
last week, students got a foot in the door. More accurately, the
door broke down, and a handful of black students, leading an
eager crowd of whites, went tumbling inside.
When the cheering stops, students will have a choice: they
can broaden and rationalize their role in University decision
making, or they can abandon this role as their passion cools and
wait until the next crises comes and compels them to break down
the door again. To the administrators, who tend to get head
aches from doors breaking down all the time, we suggest they
leave them open.
