# Afro-American Series
## Sense Of History Needed 
### VICKI GRAHAM 
A knowledge of black history
and victimization is necessary
to arouse present indignation
and act as a springboard to fu
ture action, said Dr. Nathan
Hare, coordinator of Black Stu
dies Curriculum at San Franci
sco State, in a speech in Tresid
der yesterday.
Hare, sociologist and author,
addressed a black and white au
dience on the topic of "Black
Power in the Slavery Era," in
the first of a series of lectures in
Afro-American Culture Week.
The Black Student Union and
the Organization of African Stu
dents are sponsoring the series.

Hare extended his greetings
to the BSU, FBI, CIA, and
KKK in the audience. He said
he had not expected to address
an audience of both blacks and
whites.
"You can build a wall a mile
high, but white people will al
ways climb up and peer over
at what you're doing," he said.
He added that he was glad white
students were interested in black
culture and history, in spite of
the environment of the "white
brainwashing factory," the uni
versity.
He said that those who make
history also write it or determine
what shall be written. He said

that black people must declare
void what the white slave mas
ters have written and must be
gin to write their own history
and direct their destiny. "The
BSU here made history this
week, simply by opening their
mouths," said Hare.
Black historians, presenting
other than the white view
point, are forced into copious
footnoting and must accept
the conventions of the "white
academic overlords in order
to make our valid and
get it published in white jour
nals," Hare said.
He said there was a black
power movement of sorts in the

slavery era. The "bourgeoise na
tionalists" and the "revolution
ary-insurrectionists" have al
ways existed, he said.
The nationalists, "motivated
by personal gain and mobility in
white society," fell into "separa
tist" and "elevationist" categor
ies.
The separatists wanted to re
turn to Africa, although few did
so. They were the free blacks
who would have deserted the
enslaved blacks. The elevation
ists wanted to move up through
the white structure and did not
always distinguish between
equalization, segregation, and
elevation.
"Talk of Black Power has
always come from the middle
class intellectuals," said Hare.
"Action comes from the
slums." He said that earliest
black power movements origV
inated in the North, because
black people were not free to
speak or assemble in the
South. Most were peaceful
and ineffectual.
The revolutionaries, however,
sought the elevation of the
slave and fought for him. They
chose to die as free men, not to
live as slaves.
Hare, who departed from his
prepared text, commented on
American society:
"Someone asked me once if
I was an American first or a
Negro first, and I told him I
was a black man first and an
American not at all."
"White Christians are the
greatest bearers of prejudices
that the world has known."
