## Brown Asks Unity, Sacrifice 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
As one who was close enough
to the events of last week to
realize that the stakes were
high, but not so close as to be
able to take credit for the ad
ministration's creative response,
I have given a lot of thought
over the weekend to where wo
go from here.
It seems to me clear that the
energies of the BSU and the ad
ministration are going to be
focused in a major way on im
plementing tho nine points. Much
energy will need to bo focused
on transforming the promises
into realities. The faculty will
have other tasks: getting more
tutoring programs off the
ground, working for more black
faces in the academic council,
implementing proposals for vol
untary payroll deductions to deal
with minority problems at Stan
ford, and so on.
May I presume to suggest a
role for white students? How
can they best support the racial
gains we have made in the last
few days?"! think of at least
two ways:
(1) It is not enough to have
cheered the BSU last week. Tho
real act of support will come
when a white student finds his
scholarship demand cut, and re
alizes this may be because of
the greater funds needed for
black student scholarships, or
when a brother or sister doesn't
get into Stanford, and the white
student confronts parents who
claim this is due to tho greater
number of minority students be
ing admitted. Tho new policies
haven't cost white students any
thing yet beside vicarious emo
tional exhaustion. Pretty soon
they will. Then tho true loyalties
will emerge.
Difficult White Role
(2) Those white students who
make a vocation out of attack
upon the administration are now
called upon to play, for awhile
at least, a very difficult role. If
they really want the BSU de
mands to be implemented, their
task now is to support the ad
ministration.
They must have the honesty
to asknowledge, as the BSU has
acknowledged, that the admini
stration did come through, and
did meet the substance of each
of the BSU demands. The ad
ministration did this because it
recognized the inherent legiti

macy of the demands. This is a
very important gain, and last
week is a historic week in Stan
ford history.
But the flak from outside is
going to be very strong. The ad
ministration is going to be ac
cused of selling out, giving in to
pressure, lowering admission
standards, denying white stu
dents admission, inverse racism,
and many other things. The ad
ministration has put itself on the
line and is in for some tough
times from outside the univer
sity.
Consequently, the role for
those who support the BSU is
now to support the administra
tion against irate alumni, pa
rents, right-wing columnists or
whoever. This is not the sort
of risk or sacrifice that the rhe
toric of the moment usually
talks about, but it is the kind
of unspectacular risk or sac
rifice that the Stanford moment
demands, from those who are
serious about transforming the
initial and modest but important
gains of last week into the on
going policies of university life.

Reply To 'Angry Reply'
Calls Reddall Racist
Editor, The Daily:
Walter F. Reddall Ill's "Angry

Reply to Blacks" offers nothing
significantly new. His type of
white racism is a typical ex
ample of the predominant opi
nion catalogued by Winthrop
Jordan in his enlightening book
White Over Black: American
Attitudes Toward the Negro,
1550-1812.
As a white man through acci
dent of birth, I suggest that Mr.
Walter F. Reddall 111 shows no
understanding of either the
American dream for which Dr.
Martin Luther King died or the
flag which symbolizes that
dream.
To quote Mr. Reddall's own
lines, his remarks remind me
of nothing so much a "spoiled
brat throwing a tantrum "

Editor, The Daily:
I trust that Walter F. Reddall
111 is the fictitious creation of
your somewhat perverse imagi
nation.
