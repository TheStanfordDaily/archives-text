## Postmaster Looted 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON — When the
looting in Washington started
last week, the first thing Bobby
Kennedy did was throw a brick
through a White House window
and steal Postmaster General
Larry O'Brien.
This left President Johnson
without a postmaster general
for the rest of his term.
It is not generally known, but
President Johnson's one ambi
tion before leaving the Execu
tive Mansion is to save the
United States post office. And
so when O'Brien was looted Mr.
Johnson called in Marvin Wat
son, his loyal White House aide.
"Marvin, I've been watching
you lately and the thing I ad
mire most about you is the way
you handle the mail."
"Thank you, sir. I was a four
letter man at college."
"No jokes, Marvin. You heard,
of course, that Larry O'Brien is
no longer with us."
"Yes, sir. I saw him going
over the fence during the riots,
but I decided not to stop him."

"Why not, Martin?"
"Well, you said to stop people
trying to get into the White
House, but you didn't mention
anything about stopping people
trying to get out."
"I see. Well, Marvin, O'Brien's
departure has left us with a big
hole in the post office. We have
a billion-dollar deficit, and I was
hoping Larry could make it up
by January."
"I thought he was going to
sell the post office," Marvin said.
"The only one who made a
bid on it was Howard Hughes,
but he said he wouldn't take it
unless we sold him Arizona and
California at the same time. He
figured the two would go nicely
with Nevada."
"I feel sorry for the poor suck
er who would have to take over
the post office at this time."
The President didn't say any
thing.
"Mr. President," Watson said,
"what are you looking at me
that way for?"
"Marvin, when I leave this

place I want to go down in his
tory as the President who saved
the United States post office. I
want people to say Lyndon John
son was willing to sacrifice his
political career to give every
man, woman and child in this
country a ZIP code. I want them
to say that neither snow nor
rain nor heat nor gloom of night
kept the President from making
his appointed rounds."
"That's beautiful, Mr. Presi
dent," Watson said writing it
down for his future book.
"I have selected you, Marvin,
to be the new postmaster gen
eral. By appointing you, the
country will realize that I con
sider the postmaster general's
office above politics and that I
am truly searching for a just
solution to our junk mail cri
sis."
Watson was terribly moved.
"Mr. President, you know I'm
willing to serve you in any capa
city you ask. I shall take on the
job, and if I can't save the coun
try a billion dollars in the next

seven months, I'll resign in
January."
"I knew you'd do it, Marvin
The country will never realize
the debt they owe to you. If you
can do nothing more than keen
the hippies from delivering mail
in San Francisco, it will be r
step in the right direction."
"Don't worry, sir, I've got
some definite ideas on what to
do. For a start we could put in
a mail cover on Kennedy head
quarters, then we could ..."
"Marvin," the President said,
"we've got to stay out of poli
tics. A postmaster general must
remain neutral in word, thought
and deed."
" I guess you're right, Mr.
President," Marvin said sadly.
"Well, could I at least jam their
postage meter machine?"

"Thank you, sir. I was a four
letter man at college."
"No jokes, Marvin. You heard,
of course, that Larry O'Brien is
no longer with us."
"Yes, sir. I saw him going
over the fence during the riots,
but I decided not to stop him."

"Why not, Martin?"
"Well, you said to stop people
trying to get into the White
House, but you didn't mention
anything about stopping people
trying to get out."
"I see. Well, Marvin, O'Brien's
departure has left us with a big
hole in the post office. We have
a billion-dollar deficit, and I was
hoping Larry could make it up
by January."
"I thought he was going to
sell the post office," Marvin said.
"The only one who made a
bid on it was Howard Hughes,
but he said he wouldn't take it
unless we sold him Arizona and
California at the same time. He
figured the two would go nicely
with Nevada."
"I feel sorry for the poor suck
er who would have to take over
the post office at this time."
The President didn't say any
thing.
"Mr. President," Watson said,
"what are you looking at me
that way for?"
"Marvin, when I leave this

place I want to go down in his
tory as the President who saved
the United States post office. I
want people to say Lyndon John
son was willing to sacrifice his
political career to give every
man, woman and child in this
country a ZIP code. I want them
to say that neither snow nor
rain nor heat nor gloom of night
kept the President from making
his appointed rounds."
"That's beautiful, Mr. Presi
dent," Watson said writing it
down for his future book.
"I have selected you, Marvin,
to be the new postmaster gen
eral. By appointing you, the
country will realize that I con
sider the postmaster general's
office above politics and that I
am truly searching for a just
solution to our junk mail cri
sis."
Watson was terribly moved.
"Mr. President, you know I'm
willing to serve you in any capa
city you ask. I shall take on the
job, and if I can't save the coun
try a billion dollars in the next

seven months, I'll resign in
January."
"I knew you'd do it, Marvin
The country will never realize
the debt they owe to you. If you
can do nothing more than keen
the hippies from delivering mail
in San Francisco, it will be r
step in the right direction."
"Don't worry, sir, I've got
some definite ideas on what to
do. For a start we could put in
a mail cover on Kennedy head
quarters, then we could ..."
"Marvin," the President said,
"we've got to stay out of poli
tics. A postmaster general must
remain neutral in word, thought
and deed."
" I guess you're right, Mr.
President," Marvin said sadly.
"Well, could I at least jam their
postage meter machine?"

WASHINGTON — When the
looting in Washington started
last week, the first thing Bobby
Kennedy did was throw a brick
through a White House window
and steal Postmaster General
Larry O'Brien.
This left President Johnson
without a postmaster general
for the rest of his term.
It is not generally known, but
President Johnson's one ambi
tion before leaving the Execu
tive Mansion is to save the
United States post office. And
so when O'Brien was looted Mr.
Johnson called in Marvin Wat
son, his loyal White House aide.
"Marvin, I've been watching
you lately and the thing I ad
mire most about you is the way
you handle the mail."
"Thank you, sir. I was a four
