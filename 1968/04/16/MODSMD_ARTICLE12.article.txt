## German Anti-Student Feeling Strong 
### Robert Wheeler 
(In this column Robert Wheel
er, a Western Civilization In
structor, gives some background
to the student riots now going
on in West Germany following
the shooting of Rudi Dutschke
last week.)
On Thursday evening a stu
dent was shot and critically
wounded while walking down
the Kurfurstendamm in West
Berlin. The young man's name
was Rudi Dutschke. He is a

graduate student in sociology at
the Free University in West
Berlin and known throughout
Germany as a spokesman for
the Socialist Students League
(SDS), a leftist student group.
The person who fired the shot
is a 23 year old painter who
keeps a picture of Adolf Hitler
in his room. He claims to have
decided on the idea of shooting
Dutschke after reading about
the assassination of Dr. Mar
tin Luther King. The assassin's
reason for attempting to "bump
off" Dutschke was quite simple
— he believed Dutschke to be
a Communist.
This is not surprising. The
popular press has seldom refer
red to Dutschke as anything but
"Red Rudi", inaccurate though
this characterization may be. In
fact Dutschke is an East Ger
man refugee who fled the Ul
bricht regime in 1960. While in
the East he had been active in
the Lutheran youth movement
and the immediate cause of his
flight to the West was his refusal
to serve in the "Peoples Army."
Dutschke, although a member
of SDS, has retained his ties
with the Lutheran church and
his wife, an American citizen,
is a theology student. Over the
past few years, Dutschke has
gained national attention and an
increasingly large following
through his vocal and often mili
tant criticism of certain aspects
of West German politics. He
has consistently followed a pol
icy of non-violence in his oppo
sition. His political ideology does
not easily fall into any tradi
tional category but shows the
influence of Christ, Marx, and
Marcuse.
The attempted assassination
of Dutschke is not the first
time a student has been shot in
West Berlin recently. Last June,
during a demonstration against
the Shah of Iran, Benno Ohne
sorg was beaten and fatally shot
by the police. It was the first
and last demonstration that Oh
nesorg, who was not associated
with any political group, ever
attended.

These two shootings are un
fortunately not isolated occur
rences but rather the most vio
lent expression of an anti-stu
dent, anti-intellectual atmos
phere which has mushroomed
in West Berlin during the past
few years. So extreme has this
development recently become,
that the respected German week
ly "Die Zeit" could write of the
"Programmstimmung" (Pro
gram climate) prevalent in the
city.
Since what little most mem
bers of the Stanford community
know about the West Berlin
(student) situation comes from
the generally conservative and
often inaccurate reports of the
wire services and news week
lies, there follow a few ex
amples of the ridiculous, th
macabre, and the hateful in the
recent relationships between
"town and gown" in that city.
Spring 1967 — The police re
ported they had uncovered a
plot by a group of leftist stu
dents to assassinate vice presi
dent Humphrey during his visit
to the city.
Those students taken into cus
tody by the police were however
quickly released by the courts
as it turned out that the "assas
sination plot" was largely a fig
ment of the imagination of cer
tain police officials. (The "bomb"
was a plastic bag full of cus
tard pie filling).
Summer 1967 — Without
warning, police attacked an anti-
Shah demonstration. (A parla
mentary investigating commit
tee later recommended the re
moval of the police officer who
had directed this attack — the
police chief of West Berlin.) As
a result of this police action one
student died and scores were
seriously injured and hospitaliz
ed. While the student commu
nity mourned, the mayor of West
Berlin stated that "the city's
patience was at an end", and
sent riot police onto the campus
of the Free University.
The popular press treated the
whole affair as another example

of student "terror." It ran a
picture of a young woman bleed
ing profusely from a head wound
with a caption indicating she had
been stoned by demonstrators.
Fall 1967 — Young social
democrats distributed handbills
condemning the Vietnam war
to spectators at an American
military parade. They were set
upon and beaten up by a num
ber of civilians while the po
lice looked on passively. The at
tack was defended by a leading
member of the Christian Demo
cratic party as the "moral duty
of the citizens in defense of their
American guests."
Winter 1968 — The govern
ment attempted to illegally ban
an anti-Vietnam protest march.
When the courts overruled this

prohibition voices were loud in
the government and the popular
press calling for changes in the
law and the courts.
Embarrassed by its failure to
prevent this demonstration, the
city government called a count
er demonstration a few days
later. This was advertised as a
pro-American demonstration but
in fact it was closer to an anti
student mob that gathered in
front of the Schoneberger Rath
aus. Signs were carried urging
concentration camps for stu
dents, declaring "Dutschke Peo
ple's Enemy number one" and
noting that "Under Adolf none
of this would have happened."
Spring 1968 — Rudi Dutschke
was shot three times while walk
ing down the Kurfiirstendamm.
