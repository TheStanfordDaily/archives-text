# Peace And Freedom Party Losing Many Registrants
## 
### DAN SNELL 
Richard White, a retiring,
mustachioed post-doctoral fellow
in the Medical School, admits
that his party, the Peace and
Freedom Party, may well have
its registration cut in half by
election time.
But he is not dissuaded from
the idea of having a third party.
"Many of our people supposedly
are going over to the Demo
cratic Party to work for Mc-
Carthy," he said.
"I think it's very important
for McCarthy to win in the Cali
fornia June primary; I even
think it's very important for
him to win the nomination and
the election if possible," White
said.
But McCarthy, however good
his intentions may be, cannot
change the American political
system from the top, White
says."It can only be changed
from a grass-roots movement
like the Peace and Freedom
Party."
"King's murder has solidified
the party, I think," he said. "It's
made the two party system we
now have even less meaningful
in solving the basic problems."
White says the Democratic
Party is controlled by the
Democratic Congressional
party, which in turn is con
trolled by "Southern racists."
No one, according to White,
can really challenge this
system.
"I don't think we in the Peace
and Freedom Party are the

idealists. The idealists are the
people who are still working in
the Democratic Party," he said.
White said the party might
be able to put enough Congress
men in Congress in November
or two years from November to
present a "clear alternative" to
both the major political parties.
"I think Democrats are going
to have a hard time holding the
party together," White said.
Talking about his party's
structure, White, a former coun
ty chairman who now works
with the Peace and Freedom
newspaper, said that the lack of
name personalities in the party
leadership is both good and bad
for the party. It is good for the
internal running of the party
because "everyone is open to
question."
White admitted that the
lack of known personalities
might cost the party votes at
the polls, but in the long run
It will not be detrimental to
the organization.
"Maybe we'll be able to change
the concept of politics so much
that we won't have to fall into
the trap of personalities," he
said. "There is a danger when
policies are influenced not on
the basis of their substance but
on the basis of the persons who
present them."
White said that the modest
reforms which McCarthy might
be able to make would be totally
insufficient to meet the crisis
which are developing rapidly
in the nation.

Now the Peace and Freedom
party is voting on proposals for
its state platform, working out
its overall ideology, and work
ing for the Congressional can
didates already selected, accord
ing to White.
"We're facing all these prob
lems without guidelines," he
said.
"The party is very open.
People have to participate in
it" in order to keep it from
perpetuating the system olf
leaving decisions to the few,
according to White.
White said black members
seem to be staying in the party,
somewhat because of the involve
ment of the Black Panthers in
Peace and Freedom affairs. He
said that in the party there had
been no division between black
and white members.
White admits that the vote
for the Peace and Freedom
Party depends largely on the
nominees of other parties. "It's
sort of a negative vote for us
when voters vote for Peace and
Freedom candidates because
they cannot support other can
didates," he said. "What we're
really interested in is the posi
tive vote â€” those who vote for
us because they believe in what
we do."
Although evaluating the na
tional political scene is "highly
problematical," White thinks
that Nixon will face Humphrey,
and Humphrey will win.
White does not view Johnson's
withdrawal as anything more
than a political maueuver. "He
will still be in there picking his
successor," White said.
