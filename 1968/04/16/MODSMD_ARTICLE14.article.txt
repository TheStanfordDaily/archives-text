# Health Center May Act
## Pill Policy To Be Reviewed 
### BARBARA RITZ 
James McClenahan, director
of the Cowell Health Center,
stated in a Daily interview that
the health center may review its
present policy on contraceptives
for unmarried college women.
"The health center is quite
willing to dispense information
and advice about contraceptives,"
he said. "However, the present
policy is to dispense contracep
tives only to women who are
married or are planned to be
married in the near future."
When the issue of the pill
came up several years ago, it
was controversial, he said. He
questioned present sentiment on
campus.
"I don't sense any great de
mand for revising the present
policy, but I think we ought to
take a look at it. This involves
assessing current feeling on
campus," he said, "where girls
choose to get information, or

if they have reservations about
coming to the health center."
He compared any need for coun
seling to the similar situation
of drugs.
"Students need somewhere to
come so they can find out what
to do," he said.
A change in policy does have
certain difficulties, McClenahan
said. "You have several factors
to consider: The administration
and faculty, students, and the
overall aspect of medicine." He
also questioned any legal re
sponsibility for prescribing the
pill to minors.
The Health Center does not
generally make stated policies,
McClenahan said. Several years
ago there was a lot of pres
sure on the Health Center from
alumni and parents when th< j
question of the pill came up.
"The University's responsi
bility is not always easy to de
fine. In loco parentis is a very
segmented concept." The stu

dents may want the university
to be responsible for them in
some respects, though not in
others, he explained.
McClenahan also questioned a
girl's attitude toward the pill.
Girls may want the pill without
really understanding what it is
medically all about, he said.
"The pill is relatively new.
It is a strong drug, like any pre
scribed medicine." Although a
girl may ask specifically for the
pill, the doctor has to determine
what is best for his patients,
McClenahan said.
"In our society having the girl

get contraceptives shifts respon
sibility from the male to the fe
male, and I'm not particularly
happy with the male shift," he
said.
"If the pill is too easy to get,
the girl may be pressured to get
it." As the pill is not readily
available now, he asked whether
this is a support for the girl.
"It does give them a bit of an
out."
"Of all the factors to be con
sidered in changing the policy,"
McClonahan said, "the overrid
ing factor is what is best medic
ally for the girl."


ART EXHIBIT — An exhibition entitled "New Art," composed of
painting's, sculptures, and prints from the Marcia and Frederick
Weisnian collection of Los Angeles is on display at the Art Museum
until May 27. More than 80 works are included in the exhibition,
which has been described by the show designer, Dr. Francoise
Forster-Hahn, curator of the Museum, as a "young collection." The
Museum is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays and from 1 to 5
p.m. Saturdays and Sundays. There is no admission fee.

alumni and parents when th< j
question of the pill came up.
"The University's responsi
bility is not always easy to de
fine. In loco parentis is a very
segmented concept." The stu

dents may want the university
to be responsible for them in
some respects, though not in
others, he explained.
McClenahan also questioned a
girl's attitude toward the pill.
Girls may want the pill without
really understanding what it is
medically all about, he said.
"The pill is relatively new.
It is a strong drug, like any pre
scribed medicine." Although a
girl may ask specifically for the
pill, the doctor has to determine
what is best for his patients,
McClenahan said.
"In our society having the girl

get contraceptives shifts respon
sibility from the male to the fe
male, and I'm not particularly
happy with the male shift," he
said.
"If the pill is too easy to get,
the girl may be pressured to get
it." As the pill is not readily
available now, he asked whether
this is a support for the girl.
"It does give them a bit of an
out."
"Of all the factors to be con
sidered in changing the policy,"
McClonahan said, "the overrid
ing factor is what is best medic
ally for the girl."


ART EXHIBIT — An exhibition entitled "New Art," composed of
painting's, sculptures, and prints from the Marcia and Frederick
Weisnian collection of Los Angeles is on display at the Art Museum
until May 27. More than 80 works are included in the exhibition,
which has been described by the show designer, Dr. Francoise
Forster-Hahn, curator of the Museum, as a "young collection." The
Museum is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays and from 1 to 5
p.m. Saturdays and Sundays. There is no admission fee.
James McClenahan, director
of the Cowell Health Center,
stated in a Daily interview that
the health center may review its
present policy on contraceptives
for unmarried college women.
"The health center is quite
willing to dispense information
and advice about contraceptives,"
he said. "However, the present
policy is to dispense contracep
tives only to women who are
married or are planned to be
married in the near future."
When the issue of the pill
came up several years ago, it
was controversial, he said. He
questioned present sentiment on
campus.
"I don't sense any great de
mand for revising the present
policy, but I think we ought to
take a look at it. This involves
assessing current feeling on
campus," he said, "where girls
choose to get information, or

if they have reservations about
coming to the health center."
He compared any need for coun
seling to the similar situation
of drugs.
"Students need somewhere to
come so they can find out what
to do," he said.
A change in policy does have
certain difficulties, McClenahan
said. "You have several factors
to consider: The administration
and faculty, students, and the
overall aspect of medicine." He
also questioned any legal re
sponsibility for prescribing the
pill to minors.
The Health Center does not
generally make stated policies,
McClenahan said. Several years
ago there was a lot of pres
sure on the Health Center from
alumni and parents when th< j
question of the pill came up.
"The University's responsi
bility is not always easy to de
fine. In loco parentis is a very
