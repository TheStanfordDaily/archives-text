## 'Ape Planet': Simian Farce 
### D. McGUIRE 
We all need a fix now and
then. For those of us who shy
away from the hard stuff, there
must be something like sex,
literature or cinema to divert
our attention from the banality
of life.
The opiate of the sensitive, dis
satisfied masses is science fic
tion. The kick in scientific fan
tasy is that it pretends to think
the unthinkable, to know the
unknowable.
The catch Is that we hu
mans are not equipped to
think the unthinkable. We are
capable of building imagina
tive structures based on what
we know and see. We are able
to hypothesize that there are
things that we do not know.
But we cannot construct char
acters, situations or events
that are not related in some
way to our environment.
The stuff that is commonly
available on drug-store book
racks and motion picture
screens, however, is junk. Most
of it is based on one more or
less startling idea (what if apes
were smart and people were
dumb?). The rest of the plot
is usually lifted from Mickey
Spillane or Ben Hur.
Planet of the Apes is no ex
ception. The intention of those

responsible for this film was
evidently to produce a Swiftian
commentary on human foibles
by translating them into a bizar
re environment. But the apes
succeed only in being less inter
esting than the human block
heads that they represent.
The imagninative failure of
"Planet" is particularly evi
dent in the sets. In browsing
through a copy of "Astound
ing Stories," we are free to
construct our own sets, or to
not construct them. But the
moviemaker is forced to make
some specific decisions. What
does a house or a door look
like on an alien planet?
We know that earthly doors
are rectangular, and we assume
that alien doors will be differ
ent. Will they be round? Well,
it happens that the inhabitants
of this planet are ape-shaped,
and there is no reason for them
to curl up into balls to go
through doors. Triangular? Hex
agonal? Not very functional.
How about free-form doors,
kind of roundish-oblong. You
never see doors like that around
here.
But this presents some prob
lems for the apes. They have to
build all of their doors to differ
ent specifications. And it -i'-
pretty tough to measure a
roundish-oblong space. The to

tal effect leaves one closer to
Hollywood than to Betelgeuse.
The action which takes place
when Charlton Heston and his
crew arrive on the Planet of the
Apes, is just as contrived as the
blob-shaped buildings that they
find. The tingle that one usually
experiences upon passing into
the twilight zone is missing. In
its place are some cheap laughs.
Three apes, supposedly of hu
man intelligence, do the old
"no evil" bit. A simian radical
proclaims that he would never
trust an ape over thirty.
"Planet" resembles a "Cleo
patra" style film that went
through five or six sets of]
writers and directors. It starts
out to be a showpiece for Hes
ton's misanthropic personal
ity, but pretty soon the rest
of his crew die or have their
brains removed and there is
nobody to pick on any more.
Then there is the social com
mentary phase, with apes acting
out caricatures of human be
havior. Finally there is a twist
ending which shows what the
culmination of twentieth cen
tury history might be.
At this point the elder apes,
who have mimicked human irra

tionality throughout the film,
suddenly become aware of our
bad old ways. Thrown in for
good measure are a prolonged
chase and a romance between
Heston and a starlet who is
under the impression that she
has to act in order to appear
mindless.
The only convincing thing
about Planet of the Apes is the
make-up, which enables people
like Maurice Evans, Kim Hunter
and Roddy McDowell to twitch
their lips like real monkeys. The
rest of the picture leaves one
quite pessimistic about the fu
ture of imagination in film
making.
Science fiction fans can take
some heart in the rumor that
Stanley Kubrick has done bef
ter in "2001: A Space Odys
sey." Like the rest of us, Ku
brick must extend the pres
ent in order to depict the fu
ture.
Hopefully, though, he has pro
pelled himself further into realm
of the imagination than the
Planet of the Apes, which would
create very little stir if it ap
peared as an autonomous mu
nicipality within Los Angeles
County.
