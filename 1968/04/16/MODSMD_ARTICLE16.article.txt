# YAF To Sponsor Luce In Tresidder
## 
### 
Phillip Abbott Luce, a for
mer leader in the leftist Progres
sive Labor Party who defected
from the group in 1965, will
speak tonight at 8:15 in TMU
275 on "Black Power and Ur
ban Guerrilla Warfare." The
talk is sponsored by the Young
Americans for Freedom.
Luce, once a prominent figure
in the "New Left," has since be
come a critic of the left-wing
excesses of radicals across the
country. He has testified before
the House Committee on Un-

American Activities and other
government agencies concerned
with matters of internal secur
ity in the United States.
In 1965, Luce was editor of
the Progressive Labor maga
zine. In 1963, he was leader of
the student trip to Cuba, in
open violation of the State De
partment travel ban. In addition
Luce has been a strategist in
shaping policy for the National
Student Association.
Luce gives a first hand ac
count of his experiences. "I de
fected not because I was re
conciled to the injustices of
American society as I saw them,
but because I realized that Com
munism would bring infinitely
worse justice," he said in thr>
February, 1967 issue of Reader's
Digest.
He is a Stern Guest-in-Resi
den.ce and will have dinner to
night at 6:00 p.m. in the Gold
Room of Lassen. There will be
