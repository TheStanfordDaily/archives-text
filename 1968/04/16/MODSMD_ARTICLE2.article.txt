# White Students Tell Stanford: Aid Race Reforms Elsewhere
## 
### 
Stanford University should
use "whatever influence it call"
to encourage other organiza
tions to adopt "more positive
policies toward the recruitment
and training of minority group
members," the Executive Com
mittee of Students Against
White Racism proposed.
In a position paper to be dis

cussed at an open meeting to
night at 7:30 in Room 214, the
committee stated that, "Stanford
University should refuse to en
ter into any contract with, or
make any purchase from any
business, corporation, or union
that discriminates in the hiring
or promotion of employees on
the basis of race, religion, creed,

or national origin."
Any organization with less
than five per cent of its work
force from minority groups
would be considered a "de facto
descriminator" and ineligible
for University business, regard
less of its stated policy on mi
nority group employment.
Enforcement of the proposed
contract practices lie with the
newly-formed Human Rights
Commission, announced last
week by the Administration. It
would be given, "authority to
investigate any contractor or
supplier who engages in busi
ness with Stanford University."
In addition to this proposal,
the meeting tonight will hear
reports on activity last weeKJn
support of the BSU. It will also
hear proposals for a summer
project on white racism similar
to last year's "Vietnam Sum
mer;" a fund-raising drive to
collect money for the programs
announced last week; courses of
independent study in race rela
tions; actions to support the
Black Panthers in Oakland; and
others, including suggestions
from the floor.
"Attendance at this meeting
will show if Stanford students
want to carry on with the ideas
voiced last week," a spokesman
for the Executive Committee
said. "It would be a damn
shame if the whole thing fizzled
out."
