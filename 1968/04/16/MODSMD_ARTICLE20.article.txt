# Baroque Concerts Coming In May
## 
### 
The baroque orchestra of the
West German Radio in Cologne,
will present two concerts in
Dinkelspiel on May 8 and 9,
sponsored by the Stanford Mu
sic Department.
The Capella Coloniensis, con
ducted by Ferdinand Leitner, is
making its first tour of the
United States.
The orchestra uses authentic
reconstructions of 18th century
musical instruments. The en
semble is tuned to a low cham
ber music tone of the baroque
actually a half tone lower than
today's normal voicing.
According to a Rome critic,
"The results these specialists
attain on old instruments is bril
liant. The sound quality is out
standing. There is a special
beauty of timbre and a perfect

sense of style."
The program for May 8 will
include "Concerto in D Major"
by Telemann; "Water Music
Suite No. 1 in F Major" by Han
del; "Sinfonia Coneertante for
Violin, Viola and Orchestra in
D Major" by Carl Stamitz; and
"Symphony No. 47 in G Ma
jor" by Haydn.
