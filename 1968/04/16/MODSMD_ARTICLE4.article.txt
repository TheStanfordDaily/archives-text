ate reply" to U.S. proposals for
a neutral meeting site for peace
envoys.
"As of now, we have had no
response or comment from Ha

—about anyone of the locations
we have suggested," Johnson
reported.
"For us, this Is not a propo
ganda exercise," Johnson de
clared in prepared remarks upon
his call at lolani Palace, the
Hawaii government seat, dur
ing an Asia strategy conference
here.
"What Is needed now is an
equally serious and considerate
reply," matching the serious
ness of the U.S. offers, the Pres
ident said. And in stressing his
urgency about the need for
quick agreement on beginning
peace talk preliminaries, he
added:
"It is now two long weeks
since I restricted our bombing
and urged North Vietnam to
come to the conference table."

• King Killer Named
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) —
A boarding house owner dis
closed Monday he told FBI
agents investigating the murder
of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
that drawings of a man they
were hunting closely resembled
a roomer named Eric Gait.
"That's the man. The resem
blance is close enough. I'm
sure," said Peter Cherpes, 72
owner of the South Side board
ing house where he said an Eric
Gait lived for six weeks last
fall, then dropped from sight.
Developments Monday

the background of the man
called Eric Gait. He had said he
was employed at a Mississippi
shipyard, but there was no
record of his name on the em
ployee list.
In Louisiana, where Gait had
said he held a driver's license,
there was no such record on
state files. It was much the same
story with other efforts to trace
Gait.

the northern frontier and some
already have swung into action,
an American source said Mon

Con Thien, the much bombard
ed Marin outpost just south of
the demilitarized zone, and Khe

The task of replacing the
Americans will fall upon the Ist

As soon as the division, about
12,000 men, has been retrained
it will begin taking over from
the Americans, the informants
said.

"For us, this Is not a propo

"What Is needed now is an

NEW YORK (AP) — The
stock market faltered in early
trading Monday but took a new
lease on life late in the session,
carving out another gain, its
fourth straight. Trading was ac
tive.
The recovery came in the fi

that Hanoi was considering New
Delhi as a place for talks with
the United States. This, com
bined with the stubborn nature
of the early decline as well as
some bright corporate earnings,
brought new buying into th
market.
HONOLULU (AP) — Presi

Vietnam Monday to promptly
make a "serious and consider

a neutral meeting site for peace
envoys.
"As of now, we have had no
response or comment from Ha

—about anyone of the locations
we have suggested," Johnson
reported.
"For us, this Is not a propo
ganda exercise," Johnson de
clared in prepared remarks upon
his call at lolani Palace, the
Hawaii government seat, dur
ing an Asia strategy conference
here.
"What Is needed now is an
equally serious and considerate
reply," matching the serious
ness of the U.S. offers, the Pres
ident said. And in stressing his
urgency about the need for
quick agreement on beginning
peace talk preliminaries, he
added:
"It is now two long weeks
since I restricted our bombing
and urged North Vietnam to
come to the conference table."

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) —
A boarding house owner dis

agents investigating the murder
of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
that drawings of a man they

In Louisiana, where Gait had
said he held a driver's license,
there was no such record on

with the best U.S. rifles, South
Vietnamese soldiers soon will
replace many Americans among
the northern frontier and some
already have swung into action,
an American source said Mon

As soon as the division, about
12,000 men, has been retrained
it will begin taking over from
the Americans, the informants
said.

we have suggested," Johnson

ganda exercise," Johnson de
clared in prepared remarks upon
his call at lolani Palace, the
Hawaii government seat, dur
ing an Asia strategy conference

A boarding house owner dis
closed Monday he told FBI
agents investigating the murder
of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
that drawings of a man they
were hunting closely resembled
a roomer named Eric Gait.

blance is close enough. I'm
sure," said Peter Cherpes, 72
owner of the South Side board
ing house where he said an Eric
Gait lived for six weeks last

was employed at a Mississippi
shipyard, but there was no
record of his name on the em
ployee list.
In Louisiana, where Gait had
said he held a driver's license,
there was no such record on
