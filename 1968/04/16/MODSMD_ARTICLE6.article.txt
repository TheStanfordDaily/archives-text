# Austrian Chancellor Boosts Vienna For Vietnam Talks
## 
### D. McGUIBE 
Vienna might be an acceptable
site for Vietnam peace talks,
said Austrian Chancellor Josef
Klaus in a radio interview be
fore his visit to the Stanford
campus yesterday.
Klaus, who was hustled
through his tour of the Stan
ford campus by a contingent of
State Department officials,
pointed out that Austria's geo
graphic position and strict neu
trality have enabled it to serve
as a link between various Euro
pean factions since World War
11.
Speaking to a full house of
several hundred in the large
lounge, Klaus said that Aus
tria has helped create lines of
communication between the
two economic communities
within Western Europe, as
well as between the Soviet
bloc and the Atlantic commu
nity.
But, he said, "Austria can
only be a link between divergent
forces if it is freely accessible
to all countries." For that rea

son Austria will intensify rela
tions with Eastern Europe in the
future, Klaus said.
Klaus pointed out that Aus
tria is the only country, occu
pied jointly by U.S. and Commu
nist forces after World War II,
that avoided internal strife. He
credited the policies of post-war
Austrian leaders, who managed
to maintain communication be
tween the two sectors for this
achievement.
The Chancellor obviously en
joyed his brief contact with the
Stanford student body. Despite
the official greeting ceremony
and the constant presence of a
protocal officer, he managed to
find time to say a few personal
words to some students.
A substantial portion of
those who came to hear Klaus
appeared to be former mem
bers of the Stanford-in-Aus
tria program. Many of them
greeted the premier in Ger
man.
Concerning Austria's foreign
policy, Klaus said that his coun
try favored "peaceful coexist-

ence," provided that all coun
tries renounced the use of mili
tary force and refrained from
any intervention in the affairs
of other nations.
Klaus did not say how this
philosophy might be applied to
the resolution of conflicts like
the war in Vietnam. In response
to a question, he stated that
Austria's neutrality depends
partly on a policy neither sup
porting nor commenting on the
military actions of other coun
tries.
Particularly in regard to dif
ferences between the U.S. and
the Soviet Union, Klaus said
that his country will not sup
port any unilateral policy. "But
if I may tell you a little se
cret," he said, the majority of
Austrians favor the West.
Austria is in a position to
support the peace-making ef
forts of the United Nations,
Klaus said. He mentioned that
Austrian medical teams have
been sent to the Congo, Cy
prus and Suez as part of U.N.
forces.

Stanford student body. Despite
the official greeting ceremony
and the constant presence of a
protocal officer, he managed to
find time to say a few personal
words to some students.
A substantial portion of
those who came to hear Klaus
appeared to be former mem
bers of the Stanford-in-Aus
tria program. Many of them
greeted the premier in Ger
man.
Concerning Austria's foreign
policy, Klaus said that his coun
try favored "peaceful coexist-

ence," provided that all coun
tries renounced the use of mili
tary force and refrained from
any intervention in the affairs
of other nations.
Klaus did not say how this
philosophy might be applied to
the resolution of conflicts like
the war in Vietnam. In response
to a question, he stated that
Austria's neutrality depends
partly on a policy neither sup
porting nor commenting on the
military actions of other coun
tries.
Particularly in regard to dif
ferences between the U.S. and
the Soviet Union, Klaus said
that his country will not sup
port any unilateral policy. "But
if I may tell you a little se
cret," he said, the majority of
Austrians favor the West.
Austria is in a position to
support the peace-making ef
forts of the United Nations,
Klaus said. He mentioned that
Austrian medical teams have
been sent to the Congo, Cy
prus and Suez as part of U.N.
forces.
Vienna might be an acceptable
site for Vietnam peace talks,
said Austrian Chancellor Josef
Klaus in a radio interview be
fore his visit to the Stanford
campus yesterday.
Klaus, who was hustled
through his tour of the Stan
ford campus by a contingent of
State Department officials,
pointed out that Austria's geo
graphic position and strict neu
trality have enabled it to serve
as a link between various Euro
pean factions since World War
11.
Speaking to a full house of
several hundred in the large
lounge, Klaus said that Aus
tria has helped create lines of
communication between the
two economic communities
within Western Europe, as
well as between the Soviet
bloc and the Atlantic commu
nity.
But, he said, "Austria can
only be a link between divergent
forces if it is freely accessible
to all countries." For that rea

son Austria will intensify rela
tions with Eastern Europe in the
future, Klaus said.
Klaus pointed out that Aus
tria is the only country, occu
pied jointly by U.S. and Commu
nist forces after World War II,
that avoided internal strife. He
credited the policies of post-war
Austrian leaders, who managed
to maintain communication be
tween the two sectors for this
achievement.
The Chancellor obviously en
joyed his brief contact with the
Stanford student body. Despite
the official greeting ceremony

protocal officer, he managed to
