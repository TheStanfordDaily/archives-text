# Grass, Acid, Speed
## Drug Symposium Tonight 
### 
A frank discussion of the
merits and demerits of mind-al
tering drugs is planned for Dink
elspiel Auditorium tonight at
7:30 in a symposium on the "Use
of Grass, Acid, and Speed."
The four experts will consider
social, psychiatric, medical, and
legal aspects of drug use by col
lege students. Questions will
then be taken from the audi
ence.
The drug symposium is
sponsored by the Cowell Stu-1
dent Health Center and Asso
ciated Students in response to
the use of marijuana by Stan
ford students and a controver
sy over the first arrest on cam
pus by Stanford police.
Recently the Daily printed the
results of a survey of drug use
among Stern Hall residents,
showing that 40 per cent of the
men and 65 per cent of the wom
en said they have used mari
juana.
The small sample showed sig
nificantly greater use than a
1967 study by Richard Blum of
Stanford's Institute for tho
Study of Human Problems. Blum
found 20 per cent of Stanford
students had used marijuana,
and six per cent had used LSD.
Blum's topic will be "Social
Aspects of Drug Use," an exam
ination of why students are turn
ing to drugs.
The chemistry of popular
drugs will be scrutinized by
another panelist, Dr. Jack Shel
ton. A research psychiatrist
with experience L\ drugs, Dr.
Shelton will discuss how vari
ous drugs create a "high" and
the alleged dangers of pro
longed use of LSD.
He has taught at both the
Stanford and Veterans Admini
stration hospitals and has pub
lished numerous articles on the
effects of drugs on the mentally
ill.
The psychiatric meaning of
drug use — good and bad — will
be treated by one of the top

men in the field, Dr. Duke D.
Fisher of UCLA.
He has testified to Congres
sional committees on LSD and
other drugs and written a score
of articles on hallucinogenics.
In addition he has acted as a
consultant to both Attorney Gen
eral Thomas Lynch and the
Navy on drug problems.
Dr. Fisher will arrive from
Los Angeles today and stay as
a guest-in-residence in Stern
Hall.
To explain "Drugs and the
Law," the symposium's organi
zers have invited Judge John
S. Mclnerny. Before his su
perior court appointment in
1966, Mclnerny was a legal ad
visor to the State Bureau of
Narcotic Enforcement as a dep
uty attorney general and also
was active in the field of crim
inal law.
He will discuss the courts'
rapidly changing attitude toward
marijuana users and the pro
posed laws on LSD.
Small group discussions will
be held tomorrow night in var
ious student residences, with
psychiatrists from Cowell and
the Stanford Medical Center car
rying on the dialogue begun at
tonight's symposium.
