# Pot Simple To Get At Local Schools

### MARK WEINBERGER 
Marijuana is "easily avail
able" to area high school stu
dents, Palo Alto police officers
reported last month. They
added, however, that Stanford
students present "no problem"
in their drug investigations.
Although Palo Alto students
claim marijuana usage well ex
ceeds 50 per cent among fellow
students, Police Chief William
Hydie set the number at 20 per
cent.
This figure matches statistics
released last week that showed
that last Spring one in five Stan
ford students had tried mari
juana.
Arrests of Palo Alto juven
iles for drug usage splraled
from two In 1965 to 59 last
year, Hydle told the Palo Alto
City Council. He added that
his department's caseload was
SO per cent higher last year

than 1966, largely because of
drug cases.
Lt. Phil Ray of the detective
division concurred that the
drugs problem is large and get
ting larger.
"There are some cases of
LSD and Methedrine being
used," .Ray said, "but marijuana
is still the problem. It's easy to
get hold of."
Ray said in a Dally interview
that no Stanford students have
been involved in his investiga
tions.
"No Stanford student has
entered Into drug cases in
Palo Alto," he stated. "They're
keeping It on the campus if
they're using it"
"In fact, we've never had
much problem with Stanford
people in any area. We don't
seem to have much contact with
them."
Ray claimed that most of the
drugs used by area youths
comes from Mexico by way of
San Francisco.
He said local drugs usage has
climbed steadily since 1966. He
cited the 17 juvenile drugs ar
rests in Palo Alto last month as
evidence that usage is still not
leveling off. "It will get worse
before it gets better," he added.
The detective division investi
gates drug law violations "when
they come to our attention. We
don't go out looking for them;
we know it's there," he stated.
Although the department has
no going on educational pro
grams, the officers "go farther
than straight enforcement. We
work with groups of kids, help
them work out their problems
when we can. It's part of our
responsibility," according to
Ray.
At the City Council meet
ing, Ray said the current
problems with law enforce
ment are compounded by doc
tors who appear on drug 1 and
narcotics panels and insist
that the use of marijuana is
not harmful.
"It's unfortunate that some
doctors and psychiatrists take
this position. It has an influ
ence on the kids. Often they
sneer at our remarks after
they've heard the doctors," he
stated to the council.
"No doctor has said mari
juana is good for you," Ray said

later. "But many have said that
no research says it is not harm
ful. This means they are con
doning its use. This gives kids
the reason they wanted to ex
periment."
Ray feels that no research
has come close to proving the
drug unharmful. "Marijuana is
a narcotic, there is no doubt.
It is harmful; it affects people
adversely."
He is hopeful, however, that
much of the preoccupation and
curiosity about drugs may have
"died down a little." He claim
ed that school education about
the problem has brought it into
the open where it can ration
ally discussed.
One of the main complaints
of police agencies, according
to Hydie, Is that drug offend
ers "are not going to jail be
cause the courts are overly
lenient.
"When they get off the hook,
the offenders are very inclined
to go back to what they were
doing before."
Hydie added that enforcement
problems have increased by high
court decisions. He claimed that
two persons arrested for mari
juana possession and a burglary
assault had to be released re
cently because of a minor mis
cue made by the arresting of
ficers.
"Both persons should have
gone instead to prison," Hydie
asserted.

"No doctor has said mari
juana is good for you," Ray said

later. "But many have said that
no research says it is not harm
ful. This means they are con
doning its use. This gives kids
the reason they wanted to ex
periment."
Ray feels that no research
has come close to proving the
drug unharmful. "Marijuana is
a narcotic, there is no doubt.
It is harmful; it affects people
adversely."
He is hopeful, however, that
much of the preoccupation and
curiosity about drugs may have
"died down a little." He claim
ed that school education about
the problem has brought it into
the open where it can ration
ally discussed.
One of the main complaints
of police agencies, according
to Hydie, Is that drug offend
ers "are not going to jail be
cause the courts are overly
lenient.
"When they get off the hook,
the offenders are very inclined
to go back to what they were
doing before."
Hydie added that enforcement
problems have increased by high
court decisions. He claimed that
two persons arrested for mari
juana possession and a burglary
assault had to be released re
cently because of a minor mis
cue made by the arresting of
ficers.
"Both persons should have
gone instead to prison," Hydie
asserted.
Marijuana is "easily avail
able" to area high school stu
dents, Palo Alto police officers
reported last month. They
added, however, that Stanford
students present "no problem"
in their drug investigations.
Although Palo Alto students
claim marijuana usage well ex
ceeds 50 per cent among fellow
students, Police Chief William
Hydie set the number at 20 per
cent.
This figure matches statistics
released last week that showed
that last Spring one in five Stan
ford students had tried mari
juana.
Arrests of Palo Alto juven
iles for drug usage splraled
from two In 1965 to 59 last
year, Hydle told the Palo Alto
City Council. He added that
his department's caseload was
SO per cent higher last year

than 1966, largely because of
drug cases.
Lt. Phil Ray of the detective
division concurred that the
drugs problem is large and get
ting larger.
"There are some cases of
LSD and Methedrine being
used," .Ray said, "but marijuana
is still the problem. It's easy to
get hold of."
Ray said in a Dally interview
that no Stanford students have
been involved in his investiga
tions.
"No Stanford student has
entered Into drug cases in
Palo Alto," he stated. "They're
keeping It on the campus if
they're using it"
"In fact, we've never had
much problem with Stanford
people in any area. We don't
seem to have much contact with
them."
Ray claimed that most of the
drugs used by area youths
comes from Mexico by way of
San Francisco.
He said local drugs usage has
climbed steadily since 1966. He
cited the 17 juvenile drugs ar
rests in Palo Alto last month as
evidence that usage is still not
leveling off. "It will get worse
before it gets better," he added.
The detective division investi

them work out their problems
when we can. It's part of our
responsibility," according to
Ray.
At the City Council meet
