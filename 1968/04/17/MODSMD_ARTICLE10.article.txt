## Individualist Denies Guilt 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
If mindless fools wish to use
the soapbox or the pulpit to
acuse everyone of having a part
in the murder of Dr. King and
the general plight in which Am
erica finds herself concerning
the war and the race question,
that is certainly their privilege.
I wish to state, however, that
I resent such slander most em
phatically. This manifestation of
the collectivist philosophy
("whatever happens is the fault
—or the creation—of the tribe")
is merely the latest example of
the idea that the sins of some
are the sins of all.
Those persons who advocate
the "right" of any group, minor
ity or majority, which is not
given to all people, whether rich
or poor, black or white, em
ployer or employee, are those
persons who advocate the phil
osophy which allows some men
to think that they can murder
another person with impunity.
The metaphysical principle in
volved is exactly the same in
both cases. As I do not advocate
such a philosophy, I am not
guilty of any fault, direct or in
direct, in Dr. King's death. And
I do not accept an unearned
guilt.

Redall Says Column
Suffered Hatchet Job
Editor, The Daily:
I sympathize with anyone who
searches for a thread of con
tinuity in the column which ap

peared under my name in Mon
day's Daily.
This is the final product of a
hatchet job performed on my
manuscript completely without
my knowledge and which goes
far beyond the bounds of edi
torial license. That the random
sentences which escaped the
editor's pen should fall into any
sort of logical train of thought
is purely coincidental. . . .

Fishman Congratulated
For Expose On Grove
Editor, The Daily:
Congratulations to the Dally
for Bob Fishman's behind-the
scenes expose of the true state
of affairs at Grove House. (April
16).
It is heartening—and unprece
dented—that an original Grove
resident such as Mr. Fishman
should poke delightful fun at
the mores of Grove and their
stereotypes.
In the past Grove has taken
itself all to seriously, and rather
impolitely, often has treated the
rest of the University with con
descending self-righteousness...

Daily Workers Pledge
Money To King Fund
Editor, The Daily:
Since we do not wish black
students to be unable to attend
Stanford if the University can
not afford to give them neces
sary financial aid, we plan to
contribute at least 10 per cent
of the salaries we get for work
ing on the Daily for one month
to the Martin Luther King Me
morial Fund.
