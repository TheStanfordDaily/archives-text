## Give To Panthers, Not King Fund 
### Dennis Starkovich 
With the current racial unrest
that has swept the country, and
as we see white liberals cry for
the "end of white racism," it
seems strange that nobody has
been able to penetrate to the
core of the problem. Liberal
white reaction at Stanford has
been to ask, "What can I do?"
A commendable solution has
been the establishment of the
Martin Luther King Memorial
Fund. Unfortunately, such an
action, although a step in the
right direction, is hardly suffi
cient to effectively combat the
oppression of the black man.
Numerous professors have
pledged portions of their sal
aries to the scholarship fund,
and there are movements with

in some local residences to do
nate house funds to this cause.
However, it seems that these
people should evaluate the po
tential effect of their actions.
A scholarship fund would in
fluence the lives of no more than
a few black men every year. At
the same time, the situation in
our ghettos would remain un
influenced by the action taken
here at Stanford.
The only way for white people
to help eliminate racism and the
oppression of the black man is
to cooperate with the black men
in their efforts to improve the
situations in black ghettos. At
the present time the most rele
vant and constructive work be
ing done in the ghettos in the

Bay Area is under the direction
of the Black Panther Party, and
it is in support of this organiza
tion that we white people must
work. Money donated to the
Black Panthers is money which
will be put to work in direct op
position to the forces of racial
oppression in the Bay Area.
Many people will cringe at the
suggestion of helping armed,
racist, black hoodlums out to kill
white people. But this picture
painted of the Panthers in the
white press is an unfortunate
misrepresentation of the facts.
The Panthers were organized in
October, 1966 by Bobby Seale
and Huey P. Newton in order
to protect blacks from the op

prossion and intimidation of the
police department.
Newton, a former law student,
joined with Seale in making an
extensive study of the laws con
cerning arrests, arms, etc. New
ton and Seale then began estab
lishing patrols of the black com
munity, following police cars
and getting out when police stop
ped any black person.
From the legal distance of at
least ten feet they would advise
the person of his basic rights
during and after arrest. The
fact that Seale and Newton were
armed (perfectly legal under
California's gun laws) made the
policemen somewhat hesitant
to openly violate the rights of

black people who were within
their own rights.
From this early beginning the
Panthers have developed into a
full-fledged political organization
dedicated to the freedom and
equality of the black man. Their
simple but broad-ranged pro
gram includes black control for
the black community, full em
ployment, decent housing, jus
tice, and peace. Far from being
rabble rousers, they are dedi
cated individuals striving for the
very things we white Americans
take for granted.
If racism is to be destroyed,
we must begin to try to under
stand the dilemma of the black
man as it really is, and to coop
erate with him in the area that
he really needs help. The black
youth in the ghetto is more in
terested in protection from po
lice brutality and in the advance
ment of his race than in attend
ing Stanford University. To help
him accomplish his desires we
must give him the support he
needs, and at the present time
this means offering our finan
cial contributions to the Black
Panther Party.
