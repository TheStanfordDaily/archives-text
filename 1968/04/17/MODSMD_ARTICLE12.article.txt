## Secret Search For Lyndon Stand-in 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON— It will be
denied, but the chief advisers
of Robert Kennedy, Gene Mc-
Carthy and Richard Nixon met
secretly in Washington, D.C., to
discuss ways of finding a mu
tual opponent, now that Presi
dent Lyndon Johnson has talked
himself out of the race.
The Kennedy spokesman said,
"Our entire campaign was
based on going after the John
son Administration. Now that
he's pulled the rug from under
us, my man has nothing left to
say."
Nixon's man said, "If you
think you're in trouble, we don't
even have anybody to run
against in the primaries. Dick
is no good unless he's attacking
somebody."
McCarthy's representative, a
sophomore from Radcliffe, said
tearfully, "With Johnson out
and Hanoi willing to talk, Mc-
Carthy has nothing to do but
read poetry, and we've got the
poet vote already."
Kennedy's man said, "We
knew the President hated Bob
by, but we didn't think he'd go
this far."
The Radcliffe girl said to Ken

nedy's manager, "Why doesn't
Bobby attack Gene?"
"Are you nuts?" Kennedy's
man replied. "If Bobby attacks
him, he'll get Gene nominated.
The only thing Bobby has going
for him is that he keeps insist
ing he's on McCarthy's side."
"But that's dirty politics," the
Radcliffe girl said.
"Let's not quarrel," Nixon's
man said. "We called this meet
ing to find someone to attack
whom we'd all be comfortable
with. What about Hubert Hum
phrey?"
"We've thought about him,"
the Kennedy man said. "But it's
pretty hard to attack Hubert.
He's always smiling."
The Radcliffe girl agreed. "B >-
sides, Hubert hasn't done any
thing for the last four years
except be Vice President."
The Nixon man nodded his
head. "Dick knows better than
anybody how hard it is to prove
a Vice President was responsi
ble for any Administration de
cisions."
The three people sat in
silence
Finally, Kennedy's man spoke
up. "Why doesn't Nixon attack
Bobby? Then we'll attack Dick
and we'll have a real rough
campaign."
The Radcliffe girl said, "But
who will attack Gene?"
"We'll leave Gene alone. He
can run on his record."
"Not on your life," she said.
"You can't ask anybody cam
paigning for the Presidency to
run on his record. There's no
deal unless Gene gets attacked
by both of you."
Nixon's man said, "I wonder
if Romney would consider get
ting back into the race."
"It's hardly worth asking
him," Kennedy's man said.
"We've got. to find someone
we can all attack, someone with
whom the public can identify,
someone bigger than life who is
so feared that people would
have to vote for us. We have to
do this, even if we invent him."
"Yeh, but how?"
Kennedy's man said, "Let's
turn the problem over to a com

puter to see if it can come up
with such a person."
The other two were elated
with the idea and they rushed
off to IBM headquarters. They
fed the computer all the facts
about their candidates and
asked the computer to suggest
a candidate who would give
them the opposition they all
needed.
The computer digested all the
material and then started tap
ping out the reply on a printer:

"The perfect opposition candi
date for all of you should be
6-foot-2inches tall. He should
have a Texas accent, drive an
open convertible, own a ranch
near a river and, if possible,
have an interest in the only tele
vision station in town."
When the three read the tele
printer, their faces dropped.
"Aw," said Kenedy's manager,
"the hell with it."

"We've got. to find someone
we can all attack, someone with
whom the public can identify,
someone bigger than life who is
so feared that people would

do this, even if we invent him."
"Yeh, but how?"
Kennedy's man said, "Let's

The other two were elated

off to IBM headquarters. They
fed the computer all the facts
about their candidates and
asked the computer to suggest
a candidate who would give
them the opposition they all
needed.
The computer digested all the
material and then started tap
ping out the reply on a printer:

"The perfect opposition candi
date for all of you should be
6-foot-2inches tall. He should
have a Texas accent, drive an
open convertible, own a ranch
near a river and, if possible,
have an interest in the only tele

WASHINGTON— It will be
denied, but the chief advisers
of Robert Kennedy, Gene Mc-
Carthy and Richard Nixon met
secretly in Washington, D.C., to
discuss ways of finding a mu
tual opponent, now that Presi
dent Lyndon Johnson has talked
himself out of the race.
The Kennedy spokesman said,
"Our entire campaign was
based on going after the John
son Administration. Now that
he's pulled the rug from under
us, my man has nothing left to
say."
Nixon's man said, "If you
think you're in trouble, we don't
even have anybody to run
against in the primaries. Dick
is no good unless he's attacking
somebody."
McCarthy's representative, a
sophomore from Radcliffe, said
tearfully, "With Johnson out
and Hanoi willing to talk, Mc-
Carthy has nothing to do but
read poetry, and we've got the
poet vote already."
Kennedy's man said, "We
knew the President hated Bob
by, but we didn't think he'd go
this far."
The Radcliffe girl said to Ken

nedy's manager, "Why doesn't
Bobby attack Gene?"
"Are you nuts?" Kennedy's
man replied. "If Bobby attacks
him, he'll get Gene nominated.
The only thing Bobby has going
for him is that he keeps insist
ing he's on McCarthy's side."
"But that's dirty politics," the
Radcliffe girl said.
"Let's not quarrel," Nixon's
man said. "We called this meet
ing to find someone to attack
whom we'd all be comfortable
with. What about Hubert Hum
phrey?"
"We've thought about him,"
the Kennedy man said. "But it's
pretty hard to attack Hubert.
He's always smiling."
The Radcliffe girl agreed. "B >-
sides, Hubert hasn't done any
thing for the last four years
except be Vice President."
The Nixon man nodded his
head. "Dick knows better than
anybody how hard it is to prove
a Vice President was responsi
ble for any Administration de
cisions."
The three people sat in
silence
Finally, Kennedy's man spoke
up. "Why doesn't Nixon attack
Bobby? Then we'll attack Dick
and we'll have a real rough
campaign."
The Radcliffe girl said, "But
who will attack Gene?"
"We'll leave Gene alone. He
can run on his record."
"Not on your life," she said.
"You can't ask anybody cam
paigning for the Presidency to
run on his record. There's no
deal unless Gene gets attacked
by both of you."
Nixon's man said, "I wonder
