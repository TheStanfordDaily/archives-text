# Black Professor Calls Jazz U.S.'s Contribution To World
## 
### JOHN ALCORN 
"When you press a European
to the wall, he'll usually admit
that America has made at least
one contribution to world cul
ture beside coca cola — jazz."
But in reality jazz and its re
lated musical form, soul music,
are "Black America's contribu
tion to world culture."
Anthropology Professor James
Gibbs offered this comment dur
afternoon of "Soul Music — Its
African Heritage" before a ca
pacity crowd in Tresidder's large
lounge. His talk was part of
Afro - American Culture Week
currently being sponsored by
the Black Student Union with

the assistance of the Organiza
tion of African Students.
Tapes of African tribal mu
sic, Caribbean calypso music,
and American soul were an in
tegral part of Gibbs' address.
Much of the material he present
ed was taken from his "Peoples
of Africa" anthropology course
which was offered last fall.
Emphasis On Rhythm
Gibbs explained that sub-
Saharan music, the type that
emigrated to the New World,
places "strong emphasis on the
rhythmical as opposed to the
melodic."
Black African music also con
tains a heavy emphasis on the
percussive, Gibbs said. He point
ed out that beside drums, tra
ditionally associated by West
erners with African music, sev
eral other instruments are used
to obtain the percussive effect.
Among these are the finger pi
ano, essentially strips of bam
boo that make sounds when
plucked, certain kinds of string
ed instruments, instruments
which can be shaken such as
gourds containing seeds, and,
very importantly, the hands.
His first selection of African
music was from the Yarba tribes
men of Western Nigeria. The
music had "a very heavy qual
ity combined with a strong rhy
thmic focus." Several drums
were played to a slow beat and
the tribesmen clapped their
hands to boost the percussion.
In a recording of a closely re
lated people, the Ebos of re
cently seceded Biafra, Gibbs
pointed out that the contrasting
"lighter, more etheral quality"
was produced by faster drums,
finger pianos, and "light, shrill
voices."
Gibbs, after informing his orig

inally stoic audience that "it's
all right if you let yourself move
with the music," traced these
two West African strains of
music to the Caribbean.
He played one tape of Black
Brazilian music which was very
similar to that of the Yarba's
in its response method and ac
centuated rhythm, but did differ
entiate somewhat by its "shriller
quality of voices and simpler
drum pattern."
He showed the transition into
calypso music by playing one
of Macbeth the Great's all-time
hits, "Lovely Woman," about
which Gibbs said, "The music
is soul, but the message is uni
versal."
American Soul
Moving into America's South,
the anthropology professor play
ed one Negro song which com
bined drum rhythm with a fife
which "subtly points out that
they were here during the Revo
lution," he added.
Another Mississippi selection,
"I'll Be So Glad When The Sun
Goes Down," was sung by a
chain gang of Black prisoners
who almost instinctively used
the hoes they were working with
as percussion instruments.
Gibbs then playd two selec
tions of "Satisfaction," one by
Arethea Franklin and the other
by the Rolling Stones, which
strikingly highlighted the "soul"
in soul music.
