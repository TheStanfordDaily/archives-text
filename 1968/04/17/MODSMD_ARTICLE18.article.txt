SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
The unpledged slate of Republi
can national convention dele
gates which was denied a place
on the June primary ballot told
the State Supreme Court today
that the state law requirement
for petition signatures discrimi
nates against .Republicans.
A suit filed by James Wilcox,
chairman of the Committee for a
Free Delegation, asked the Su
preme Court to override the
state law requirements and or
der the delegation placed on the
ballot. The deadline on printing
primary ballots is April 21.
Wilcox said the free delega
tion's purpose is to offer Cali
fornia Republicans a choice oth
er than the delegation pledged
to Gov. Reagan as a favorite
son presidential candidate.
The free delegation petition,

drafted by John Kaplan, Stan
ford law professor, cited that
the law requires 18,715 valid Re
publican voter signatures but
only 13,746 Democratic signa
tures for putting delegations on
the ballot.
Kaplan declared California
has 3.8 million registered Demo
crats and 2.9 million registered
Republicans — nearly one mil
lion fewer Republicans.
The signature requirement is
based on the preceding elec

gan 3,842,913; Edmund G. Brown
2,749,174.
"The result is that the Re
publican party is being penal
ized for winning the last elec
tion," the petition argued.
