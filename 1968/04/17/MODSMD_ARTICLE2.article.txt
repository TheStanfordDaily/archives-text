# The 						Week That Was
## How The BSU Did It 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
The University administra
tion escaped from the black
student confrontations last week
with shaken dignity and a
cloudy future, but it succeeded
in a key objective: avoiding dis
ruptive sit-ins and violence.
From the black students'
melodramatic walkout at Me
morial Auditorium Monday un
til the agreement Thursday af
ternoon, the administration be
lieved that militant protest ac
tion would be the price of not
moving far enough or fast
enough in meeting the demands
of the Black Student Union
(BSU).
Behind-the-scenes warnings of
a BSU "contingency plan" in
case of an impasse were given

to administrators Thursday
morning by excited whites.
Earlier it had been made clear
to the administration that mili
tants in East Palo Alto were
putting pressure on the Stanford
blacks to be inflexible in dealing
with the University.
By implication, East Palo Alto
would aid any demonstration
by Stanford's 70 blacks and hun
dreds of white student allies.
Provost Richard Lyman

was bluntly warned that Uni
versity buildings would be
shut down by demonstrators
if he reached an impasse with
the BSU.
This shadow of fear was deep
ened by the administration's
knowledge of riots in East Pa'o
Alto the day after Martin Luth
er King's death. And through
out the week, reports came in
of a "lock-in" of the board of
trustees of Tuskagre Institute
and a seige of the administra
tion building at Colgate Univer
sity, both by student protestors.
The BSU itself never publicly
threatened disruption of th 1
campus if its demands were not
met. In their written statements
the BSU leaders used hard, un
compromising language, but
they consistently side-stepped the
question of what the BSU would
do if the administration said
"no."
On Wednesday, for instance,
co-chairman Ken Washington
would tell a white questioner
that "Events often determine
things like this."
For most of the week, the
administration and BSU just
weren't on the same wave
length. Administrators were
surprised by the black's seem
ing Intransigence on a num
ber of minor issues, and by the
vociferous support they re
ceived from the "Students

Against White Racism' 'and
other ad-hoc white groups.
Provost Lyman and other top
administrators had professed
strong personal sympathies with
the black movement, and felt
King's death keenly. They be
lieved they had performed ad

A NEWS ANALYSIS
mirably and met the substance
of the BSU demands Monday,
only hours after the demands
were read in a shrill voice by
Frank Satterwhite on the Me
morial Auditorium stage.
Besides forming a Human
Rights Commission, Lyman said
Monday the University would
double minority-group enroll
ment by 1969-70; admit ten mi
nority students who don't meet
minimal admissions require
ments, and double the propor
tion of employees from minority
groups over the next year.
Lyman and others also un
leashed some strong rhetoric
Monday on American racism,
and called for a "continuing dia
logue" with the BSU, beginning
with a request for a meeting
Thursday.
"It is the matter, not the man
ner, of what they said that
counts," said a Monday state
ment by Lyman and President
Wallace Sterling, graciously
overlooking the barbed langu
age of the BSU demands and the
curt interruption of Lyman's
speech earlier that day.
With this generosity, the ad
ministration hoped to get off
the hook, particularly regarding
the BSU "Demand Ten": an ul
timatum to yield to the other
nine demands at an "open for
um" Tuesday night in Tresid
der.
As late as 11 p.m. Monday
the administration still had
no plan to send a representa
tive to the "open forum." By
Stanford precedents, Lyman
would boycott the affair. Only
last October he had disdain
ed an SDS demand that he de
bate about CIA recruiting in
White Plaza.
But sometime on Tuesday Ly
man changed his mind. It was
a wise decision. The blacks,
angry at six months of what
they considered fruitless talks
with the University, bitter at As
sociate Provost Robert M. Rosen
zweig's handling of minority
group affairs, and strengthened
by King's death and the sym
pathy of whites, wanted guaran
tees that the University would
deal directly with the BSU to
institute many more reforms.
But Lyman, having signed a
statement inviting the BSU to
a Thursday meeting instead,
wouldn't go personally Tuesday
night. So he sent Vice Provost
Herbert Packer to lead a dele
gation consisting of Rosenzweig,
Vice President for Finance Ken
neth Cuthbertson, and Profes
sors Robert McAfee Brown, Ken
neth Arrow and Donald Ken
nedy.
Packer planned to make the
confrontation a kind of panel
discussion of how the Univer
sity was going to stick to its
promises on black enrollment
and employment.
But BSU co-chairman Wash

ington and Charles Countee had
other ideas. Before an excited
crowd of 900 on Tresidder deck,
they insisted on a point-by-point
answer to their demands, al
though Washington, admitted
that some "complexities" could
be worked out at another time.
Packer, interrupted in mid
sentence by Washington, refus
ed to follow the blacks' proce
dure. For a few tense minutes
Packer contemplated walking
out of the meeting with his dele
gation.
Stanford was probably
closer to civil disobedience at
that moment than at any oth
time last week. Since a large
contingent of blacks was pres
ent, along with most of the
white rudicals, an explosive
demonstration could easily
have followed an administra
tion walkout. The crowd could
even have forceahly prevent
ed Packer and the others from
leaving.
Brown thinks this was the
"turning point" of the week's
events.
As the meeting started again,
Packer and others spoke briefly
to the nine points. On all ex
cept one the administration out
lined plans which met the spirit,
if not the exact detail, wanted
by the BSU. Packer pledged "full
implementation" of a memoran
dum by Gibbs on minority group
employment. Cuthbertson prom
ised "personal commitment" to
find the funds for financial aid
to needy black students.
PacVer lauded the idra of hir
ing black students to recruit in
the ghettos. The BSU was in
vited to appoint two members
to the new Human Relations
Commission, and the Commis
sion was pledged to immediate
re-investigation of a touchy in
cident involving East Palo Alto
children at the Tresidder drug
store, the cause of much black
antipathy towards Rosenzweig.
But Packer gave a blunt
"no" answer to demand five,
the replacement of Rosen
zweig as the top official for
minority group affairs. Re
form doesn't require "scape
goats," Packer said.
Packer and Washington shook
hands to the applause of the
crowd and the meeting broke
up. Once again the administra
tors were jubliant; they were
off the hook, and could get on
with the urgent business of in
creasing Stanford's role, in aid
ing blacks.
And once again the optimism
was premature. Two factors
hardened the BSU against any
compromise of its demands.
The first was the East Palo
Alto Day School's insistence that
Rosenzweig be replaced. The
BSU apparently needed to be
able to show this "constituency"
that it had won this point.
The second factor was The
Daily's headline the next day:
"University, BSU Agree on Nine
Of Ten Points." The BSU felt
that the administration had just
made some favorable noises. Un
less the blacks reacted strong
ly, their white sympathizers
might have assumed the battle
was won.
Buoyed by its easy successes
and the unquestioning support
of hundreds of white students,
the BSU issued a statement the
next day (April 10) saying the
University had made "no re
sponse on the central issues sur
rounding black students in deci
sion roles in recruiting, admis
sions, dismissals." The state
ment also said the BSU propo
sals "must now be demands"
because the University had drag
ged its feet Jor "more than a

year of uneventful meetings."
Washington told a noon
rally that the University's re
sponse Tuesday night "was
not completely adequate. We
did not come to an agree
ment"
The BSU invited sympathizers
to attend a vigil at. Tresidder out
side the Thursday meeting at 2
p.m. with the administration.
It seemed incredible, but the
pressure on the administration
to meet every BSU demand was
greater than ever. One group of
white students demanded that
besides giving in to the blacks,
the University should halt all
construction projects and do
nate the funds to black commu
nities. "We shall take whatever
action we consider necessary
and proper to convince this Uni
versity to act," they told Lyman.
Lyman now faced the pros
pect of the BSU insisting on
unconditional acceptance of
its demands, with a tense
crowd of whites and blacks
waiting to "act" if he refused.
Lyman and Packer worked
late Wednesday night preparing
a formal "response" to present
to Countee and Washington
Thursday. Sterling, attending a
party that night, expressed irri
tation that his subordinates
couldn't accompany him.
At 7 a.m. Thursday several
white students and a professor
gathered at Lyman's office to
warn him that he "couldn't ne
gotiate" on the Rosenzweig is
sue. The blacks "just didn't care"
anymore, and were ready to "es
calate and escalate," Lyman was
told. The "contingecy plans" to
close down the firehouse, SLAC,
and the computer center were
described.
No blacks made such warn
ings to the administration. The
white students, in their excite
ment, may have been exagger
ating. But the BSU isn't talking.
Later that morning BSU rep
resentatives met unofficially
with Rosenzweig himself.
At 1 p.m. Assistant Police
Chief Thomas Bell met
with President Sterling, pre
sumably to discuss what to do
in case of disruptive action by

the BSU. Administration sour
ces say their response to a sit
in would have been totally pas
sive, to avoid violence or outside
police intervention. But a fire
house sit-in would have forced
county sheriff's deputies to act,
since this is a semi-public fa
cility.
Apparently the administra
tion also feared that the stu
dents might block all entrances
to Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
where the entire Academic
Council of faculty was meet
ing that afternoon. But, In
fact, this wasn't one of the
"contingecy" plans.
Administrators were relieved
when the vigil crowd in Tresid
der courtyard at 2 p.m. turned
out to be fewer than 300. When
the meeting began, Lyman read
the BSU a draft of the statement
drawn up the night before. Af
ter two hours' discussion and
several minor changes, it was
accepted.
Washington walked out on the
Tresidder deck and told the
crowd, "All our demands have
been met." Then, like a cheer
leader, he cried, "What do we
want?" The largely white group,
silent and confused, said noth
ing.
Meanwhile Lyman rushed over
to Dinkelspiel, where he told
the faculty to brace for "back
lash" from society. The Academ
ic Council endorsed the Univer
sity's commitments. A price tag
of $1.2 million yearly was put
on the minority group grograms.
The Lyman-BSU agreement
was a carefully worded docu
ment that seemed to match
most of the details of the BSU's
original demands. Many provi
sions were made for BSU par
ticipation in the new minority
group effort, usually in recruit
ing or consultant roles.
On the crucial Rosenzweig is
sue, the agreement was inten
tionally ambiguous. The admin
istration agreed to hire a "Co
ordinator of Intergroup Rela
tions" to work "for the Univer
sity with Associate Provost Rob
ert Rosenzweig, the Human Re
lations Commission, and other
relevant groups." The BSU

would help find a "suitable ap
pointee."
But the press didn't under
stand.
The San Jose Mercury carried
the headline Friday, "Rosen
zweig Relieved of Duties; Stan
ford Bows to BSU." Immediate
ly Lyman started getting calls
from faculty and alumni wor
ried about "giving in" to pres
sure.
Lyman responded with a
statement Monday Insisting
that "the power to make deci
sions in academic matters"
had not been "delegated to
any group of students." Rosen
zweig's authority was un
changed, he added.
The BSU, informed in advance
of the tactical necessity of this
statement, made no response.
Apparently the promise of a
black Coordinator satisfied the
East Palo Alto Day School, too.
The administration and BSU
met again yesterday to continue
planning the search committee,
Human Relations Commission,
admissions recruiting aides, and
multitude of other programs
involving the blacks.
But the backlash is still young.
Robert McAfee Brown, who has
stayed at the center of the con
warned yesterday in a letter to
The Dally that "the role for
those who support the BSU is
now to support the administra
tion against irate alumni, par
ents, right-wing columnists or
whoever."
Brown added, "The flak from
outside is going to be very
strong. The administration is
going to be accused of selling
out, giving in to pressure, lower
ing admissions standards, deny
ing white students admission, in
verse racism, and many other
things."
Some of that flak is likely to
come tomorrow at the Board of
Trustees meeting in San Fran
cisco. The 23 men, legally re
sponsible for the University, will
doubtless be interested to find
out how and why their officers
have commited Stanford to an
expensive program unprecedent
ed in the history of this peace
ful, white man's university.
