# The
						Week That Was
## How The BSU Did It 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
The University administra
tion escaped from the black
student confrontations last week
with shaken dignity and a
cloudy future, but it succeeded
in a key objective: avoiding dis
ruptive sit-ins and violence.
From the black students'
melodramatic walkout at Me
morial Auditorium Monday un
til the agreement Thursday af
ternoon, the administration be
lieved that militant protest ac
tion would be the price of not
moving far enough or fast
enough in meeting the demands
of the Black Student Union
(BSU).
Behind-the-scenes warnings of
a BSU "contingency plan" in
case of an impasse were given

to administrators Thursday
morning by excited whites.
Earlier it had been made clear
to the administration that mili
tants in East Palo Alto were
putting pressure on the Stanford
blacks to be inflexible in dealing
with the University.
By implication, East Palo Alto
would aid any demonstration
by Stanford's 70 blacks and hun
dreds of white student allies.
Provost Richard Lyman

was bluntly warned that Uni
versity buildings would be
shut down by demonstrators
if he reached an impasse with
the BSU.
This shadow of fear was deep
ened by the administration's
knowledge of riots in East Pa'o
Alto the day after Martin Luth

out the week, reports came in
of a "lock-in" of the board of
trustees of Tuskagre Institute
and a seige of the administra
tion building at Colgate Univer
sity, both by student protestors.
The BSU itself never publicly
threatened disruption of th 1
campus if its demands were not
met. In their written statements
the BSU leaders used hard, un
compromising language, but
they consistently side-stepped the
question of what the BSU would
do if the administration said
"no."
On Wednesday, for instance,
co-chairman Ken Washington
would tell a white questioner
that "Events often determine
things like this."
For most of the week, the
administration and BSU just
weren't on the same wave
length. Administrators were
surprised by the black's seem
ing Intransigence on a num
ber of minor issues, and by the
vociferous support they re
ceived from the "Students

Against White Racism' 'and
other ad-hoc white groups.
Provost Lyman and other top
administrators had professed
strong personal sympathies with
the black movement, and felt
King's death keenly. They be
