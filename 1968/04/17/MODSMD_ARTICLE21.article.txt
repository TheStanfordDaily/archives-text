# Computer Teaches Russian
## 
### 
A computer takes the place of
an instructor and classroom for
a group of Russian 1 students
and is proving "extremely effec
tive," according to project di
rector Joseph A. Van Campen
of the Institute for Mathemati
cal Studies in the Social Sciences.
Computerized learning of a
second language is an experi
ment financed by the Office of

Education. It began in the fall
and will continue next year as
finances permit.
The experiment Is the first
to totally replace the class
room, arcording to Van Camp
en, although computers have
been used before In conjunc
tion with other teaching meth
ods in language courses.
Van Campen programs the

course material, but the actual
computer program is a modi
fied version of one used to teach
arithmetic. Mrs. Elise Belenky,
a research associate at the In
stitute, is in charge of the actual
operation of the class.
She prepares and checks the
lessons. Once a month each stu
dent records a tape for her and
she corrects his pronunciation.
The computer is used to teach
the written language. It is used
"primarily for the introduction
and drilling of 'building blocks'
(i.e., sentence constituents)."
Longer sentences are devel
oped in written homework. In
this respect the "computer's job
is primarily the teaching of voca
bulary items and grammatical
constructions."
The computer also reviews ma
terial, like a tutor who assesses
a student's performance and
te'ls him where he should con
centrate his efforts.
The course Is an attempt
to develop comprehension and
the ability to respond to Rus
sian stimuli. It is not a con
versation course. Joseph Van
Campen, Assoc. prof, of Sla
vic Languages believes that
type of instruction involves
different methods and takes a
much longer time.
Once the student can use the
language "reasonably freely" it
is time for a human instructor.

Students in the computer sec
tion were chosen at random
from those planning to take
Russian. They either had no ob
jection to computerized learning
or specifically wanted to take
the course.
There was no substantial dif
ference in midterm exam grades
for the fall quarter. But the reg
ular students made nearly three
times as many errors on the
final as did the computer stu
dents. About 60 per cent of the
exam was identical for both
groups of students.

Van Campen programs the

course material, but the actual
computer program is a modi
fied version of one used to teach
arithmetic. Mrs. Elise Belenky,
a research associate at the In
stitute, is in charge of the actual
operation of the class.
She prepares and checks the
lessons. Once a month each stu
dent records a tape for her and
she corrects his pronunciation.
The computer is used to teach
the written language. It is used
"primarily for the introduction
and drilling of 'building blocks'
(i.e., sentence constituents)."
Longer sentences are devel
oped in written homework. In
this respect the "computer's job
is primarily the teaching of voca
bulary items and grammatical
constructions."
The computer also reviews ma
terial, like a tutor who assesses
a student's performance and
te'ls him where he should con
centrate his efforts.
The course Is an attempt
to develop comprehension and
the ability to respond to Rus
sian stimuli. It is not a con
versation course. Joseph Van
Campen, Assoc. prof, of Sla
vic Languages believes that
type of instruction involves
different methods and takes a
much longer time.
Once the student can use the
language "reasonably freely" it
is time for a human instructor.

Students in the computer sec
tion were chosen at random
from those planning to take
Russian. They either had no ob
jection to computerized learning
or specifically wanted to take
the course.
There was no substantial dif
ference in midterm exam grades
for the fall quarter. But the reg
ular students made nearly three
times as many errors on the
final as did the computer stu
dents. About 60 per cent of the
exam was identical for both
groups of students.
A computer takes the place of
an instructor and classroom for
a group of Russian 1 students
and is proving "extremely effec
tive," according to project di
rector Joseph A. Van Campen
of the Institute for Mathemati
cal Studies in the Social Sciences.
Computerized learning of a
second language is an experi
ment financed by the Office of

Education. It began in the fall
and will continue next year as
finances permit.
The experiment Is the first
to totally replace the class
room, arcording to Van Camp
en, although computers have
been used before In conjunc
tion with other teaching meth
ods in language courses.
