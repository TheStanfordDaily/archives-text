# Tribe Rally Edges Broncos
## 
### PETER DUFFY 
Stanford's Indians came from
behind with two runs in the
ninth to down the Santa Clara
Broncos 6-5 at Santa Clara yes
terday.
The Indians trailed 5-4 when
Russ Tweet opened the top of
the ninth with a walk. Mike
Schomaker got an infield hit,
and Bob Boone beat out a bunt
to load the bases. Bob Gallagher
then singled home a run to tie
the game and keep the bases
jammed.
Mike Ammirato proceeded to
lift a short fly to right that
Bronco outfielder Ruby Bagone
caught. Schomaker, the runner
on third, tagged up on the short
fly and dashed home safely,
beating an accurate throw.
The safe call by the umpire
resulted in a rhubarb that held
up the game for 15 minutes.
After the tempers had subsided,

the Tribe was retired without
scoring another run, but were
able to hold the Broncos in the
last of the ninth to wrap up the
contest.
Schomaker not only scored the
winning run but socked a two
run homer to give the Tribe a
2-0 lead in the first inning.
Stanford scored twice more
in the fifth, and held a 4-3 ad
vantage going into the bottom
of the eighth.
The Broncos, however, scored
two in that frame on a walk
and a wild pitch by Sandy Vance
with the bases loaded. Santa
Clara had loaded the bases on
a single, a throwing error by
Boone, and a bunt single off
Vance's glove.
Thus the Tribe appeared to be
in the process of losing their
third game in their last four
outings before they rallied in
the ninth to pull it out.

Vance, who allowed three hits
and struck out five in two in
nings of work, was the winner.
Phil Keller had started for the

Tribe and was replaced by Rod
Poteete in the fifth.
After a shaky roadtrip, the
Tribe returns home this week
end and opens league play with
a Friday afternoon game against
UCLA and a doubleheader Sat

urday against the USC Trojans.
