# Yale To Give More To Black Ghettos
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
Last week while Stanford was
tensely adjusting internal poli
cies on black admissions and em
ployment, Yale was revising
commitments to the black ghet
to in New Haven, unharrassed
by student demands and pres
sure.
The Yale administration had
reached an understanding with
its black students on admissions,
employment, and curriculum
well before Martin Luther King's
assassination.
This difference in response to
King's death was dictated main
ly by the varied nature of the
two universities: Stanford's
rural location compared to the
city environment of Yale.
Two months ago the Black
Student Alliance (BSA) at
Yale began talks with the Yale
administration about improv
ing minority â€¢ group admis
sions and establishing Afro-
American studies in the curri
culum. The main thrust of
BSA activity concerned Yale's
relationship with the New
Haven black community.
Yale and the BSA reached
agreement on curicculum and
admissions changes during ne
gotiations, after the BSA pushed
along the talks by boycotting
classes for two days in March.
The BSA made no attempt to
seek white student support for
the boycott and received very
little.

Alan Boles, chairman of the
Yale Daily News, described the
Yale-BSA talks as "intensive
over a three month period," and
he added that the leadership of
the BSA had become increasing
militant. Nevertheless, Boles
said, discussions were "harmon
ious" and black students have
already helped the admissions
department recruit black stu
dents for next year's freshman
class.
Following King's death, Yale
had an uneasy week precipitated,
not by its BSA, but rather by
the New Haven black ghetto.
By last Wednesday, Yale
President Kingman Brewster
announced a plan for com
mitting large university re
sources. including $40,000, to
help the ghetto. Yale's plan
bypasses normal city govern
ment by giving money and
support directly to ghetto or
ganizations.
To implement his plan, Brew
ster needed the support of the
Yale trustees, and he had to
spend hours phoning them
around the country individually.
He received their support.
The atmosphere at Yale last
week was calm. According to
Boles, there was no air of crisis.
Classes were-cancelled all day on
Monday, when there was a teach
in on white racism, and then for
4 hours on Tuesday during
King's funeral.
