# Dean Smith Bans Exhibit; Paintings Called 'Sordid'
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
An art exhibit that went up in
the Old Union lobby Saturday
caused loud repercussions as it
suddenly came down yesterday
afternoon.
Dean of Students Joel Smith
"regretfully" ordered that the
show be taken down because of
the slew of complaints received
by the University, which termed
the paintings "atrocities" and
called them "vile and sordid."
As a result, Frank Lobd°U,
associate professor of art, said
his department would no long
er exhibit in administrative
buildings.
Joseph Jedd, assistant account
manager for student accounts,
who has been running the shows
in the Old Union and Encina
Hall, said he would quit as di
rector of these exhibits.
The exhibit consisted of 16
paintings and drawings by Mike
Barnes, Masters candidate in
painting, entitled "Love—Not
War," along with several sculp
tures by Richard Gillespie.
Most of Barnes' paintings
showed nude men and women
caressing various mechanical
devices, such as vacuum clean
ers, lamps and electric fans.
"Vacuum and Figure," one
of the paintings, showed a
prone nude clutching a
vacuum cleaner. Another,
"Vacuum Cleaner and Girl,"
showed a seated female hold
ing a vacuum in front of her.
Similar to these was "Electric
Fan," which depicted a nude
man holding an electric fan.
Two untitled drawings pic
tured a man in bed with an elec
tric lamp and a woman in bed
with a vacuum cleaner.
One painting showed a man
licking a light bulb. Another,
"Woman Walking Lover," pic
tured a woman holding the hose
of a vacuum cleaner standing
upright next to her.
The offices of both the presi

dent and the provost were
"flooded" wi/h complaints
about the exhibit, Jedd said.
Jedd himself received several
"nasty letters."
"Mike is a great artist," eJdd
commented. "It's a shame we
can't look at ourselves."
Others disagreed. More than
twenty secretaries who work in
the Old Union, most of them in
the registrar's office, sent a peti
tion to Jodd Monday complain
ing about the show.
Their feelings were ex->
pressed by Miss Armista M.
Cook, who said the group
complained mainly "because
we're a captive audience. We
don't object to it as art. If
they want to put it in
museum, fine. But we don't
want to have to look at it."
Another irate secretary wrote,
"If this is your idea of boing
educated, I don't want to be!"
Secretaries were not the only
ones complaining. "Some people
gave me dirty looks when I was
in the faculty club," Jedd said.
In all, Jedd received 10 letters
yesterday. Nine, all from em
ployees in the Old Union, strong
ly opposed the show. One, from
an art department staffer, said
Barnes "paintod the truth of the
elements of morality."
Robert Houghton, associate
registrar, was one of many peo
ple who called Jedd. He said the
"present exhibit shows poor
taste and poor judgment."
Catherine W. Templeton, an
alumna and credentials secre
tary h>re for 24 years, wrote,
"I feel for the first time a com
plete sense of shame for the
University. To find these atroci
ties up for young people to see
is beyond my comprehension."
"I hate It, and it's vile and
sordid," one secretary said as
she passed by the paintings.
Another called the show "junk
art."
"I regret the whole thing very

much," Jedd said. "That's the
only statement I can make."
The artist had no comment.
Jedd sent a memo to all staff
in the Old Union Building Mon
day to "explain the philosophy
behind these exhibits."
Last summer with the ap
proval of Smith, the art de
partment consented to put on
display works of graduate
students in the department.
The contents of each display
were left entirely to the dis
cretion of each artist.
"All of the students are com
mitted to art, have studied art
for many years," Jedd wrote.
"It is therefore a cooperative
effort which is designed to bene
fit the individual artists as well
as the public who vi >ws the art.
"In a progressive University
which offers creative artists the

opportunity and freedom to ex
press themselves and to experi
ment, and, in the process to fail
or succeed, the artist in turn
deserves our criticism but not
our condemnation."
Jedd also said it had been his
"hope that rather than be re
pelled by the art on the Old
Union walls, the public should
bo educated. There is a large
gap between what the average
person understands of current
trends in art and what is actual
ly happening in the world of the
contemporary artist.
"By viewing the art and allow
ing it some thought, one can to
a great extent familiarize him
self with this world. Perhaps
then a modern painting or sculp
ture can be appreciated in its
own context of today—and not
tomorrow."
