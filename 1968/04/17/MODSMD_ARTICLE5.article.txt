# Riots Seen As Biggest Threat Since American Civil War
## 
### JEFF ROBISON 
"This country is facing the
worst threat to its survival since
the Civil War . . . and the Com
munists claim it is very pos
sible to have guerrilla war in the
United States." So spoke Philip
Abbott Luce last night in a
Tresidder Union speech spon
sored by th * Stanford Young
Americans for Freedom.
Speaking on "Black Power
and Urban Guerrilla Warfare,"
Luce drew upon his own ex
perience as a former high-rank
ing official of the Maoist
inclined Progressive Labor
Party: "I would not contend
that the recent riots have
caused by the Communists," he
said.
"What has caused them has
been the rich getting relatively
richer and the poor getting
qualitatively poorer."
"But," he continued, "rhe
Communists have attempted,
to infiltrate the civil rights
organizations—l can speak

from what we did in Harlem."
"The Communists try to
Negroes to believe that all white
people, police, and the state
and national governments are
their enemies," Luce said. "They
say the only way to get their
freedom is to go into the streets
and take it."
What the Communist Party
and such organizations as the
Revolutionary Action Move
ment want to see happen, Luce
said, "is for 25 to 30 major ghet
tos in the United States to blow
up all at once. Then the battle
will begin, and many white
people will panic and form vig
ilante groups."
Digressing again to his own
involvement as an agitator—
one he forsook three years ago
—Luce described the methods
used: "In Harlem we tried to
organize cadres to use guns and
molotov cocktails once a riot
began . . . and once they began
our methods were utilized.
"These people would hope

that once government fails It
might be possible for some
armed coup to take place."
Nevertheless, Luce went on,
"I seriously believe many Com
munists don't really think it is
possible that 11 per cent of the
population could win."
"For one thing," he said,
"guerrillas would have no priv
ileged sanctuary. For another, it
wouldn't be possible for guer
rillas—once having struck—to
melt away into the population."
In conclusion, Luce admitted
that "I don't have any answers.
I wish I did. But we can't af
ford to sit around the next few
years and procrastinate.
"One possibility," he said,
"would be to get big business
to work in the ghettos—to con
vince them it is in their own
economic interest. But the gov
ernment hasn't really done any
thing about it. Now it's time
that we take up the responsi
bility with our tim?, money, and
thoughts."

"The Communists try to
Negroes to believe that all white
people, police, and the state
and national governments are
their enemies," Luce said. "They
say the only way to get their
freedom is to go into the streets
and take it."
What the Communist Party
and such organizations as the
Revolutionary Action Move
ment want to see happen, Luce
said, "is for 25 to 30 major ghet
tos in the United States to blow
up all at once. Then the battle
will begin, and many white
people will panic and form vig
ilante groups."
Digressing again to his own
involvement as an agitator—
one he forsook three years ago
—Luce described the methods
used: "In Harlem we tried to
organize cadres to use guns and
molotov cocktails once a riot
began . . . and once they began
our methods were utilized.
"These people would hope

that once government fails It
might be possible for some
armed coup to take place."
Nevertheless, Luce went on,
"I seriously believe many Com
munists don't really think it is
possible that 11 per cent of the
population could win."
"For one thing," he said,
"guerrillas would have no priv
ileged sanctuary. For another, it
wouldn't be possible for guer
rillas—once having struck—to
melt away into the population."
In conclusion, Luce admitted
that "I don't have any answers.
I wish I did. But we can't af
ford to sit around the next few
years and procrastinate.
"One possibility," he said,
"would be to get big business
to work in the ghettos—to con
vince them it is in their own
economic interest. But the gov
ernment hasn't really done any
thing about it. Now it's time
that we take up the responsi
bility with our tim?, money, and
thoughts."
"This country is facing the
worst threat to its survival since
the Civil War . . . and the Com
munists claim it is very pos
sible to have guerrilla war in the
United States." So spoke Philip
Abbott Luce last night in a
Tresidder Union speech spon
sored by th * Stanford Young
Americans for Freedom.
Speaking on "Black Power
and Urban Guerrilla Warfare,"
Luce drew upon his own ex
perience as a former high-rank
ing official of the Maoist
inclined Progressive Labor
Party: "I would not contend
that the recent riots have
caused by the Communists," he
said.
"What has caused them has
been the rich getting relatively
richer and the poor getting
qualitatively poorer."
"But," he continued, "rhe
Communists have attempted,
to infiltrate the civil rights
organizations—l can speak

from what we did in Harlem."
