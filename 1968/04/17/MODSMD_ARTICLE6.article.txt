# Panel Tells Facts About Drug Use

### CICELY BATES 
"We are a drug-using society"
concluded two doctors, a judge,
and a researcher last night in a
symposium on the "Use of
Grass, Acid, and Spe d."
"Social facilitation" is one of
the biggest reasons why nearly
all societies use drugs, reveal d
Richard Blum of Stanford's In
stitute for the Study of Human
Problems. It is useful in "greas
ing the whee's of social inter
course" in societies that are used
to the presence of drugs, h">
added.
However, in urbanized,
stratified societies that have
not had a long history of drug
use, private individual use of
the drug is apt to occur. The
U.S. is the perfect example
of this and Blum contended
that people in this country
have turned their bodies into
"pharmacological laborator
ies." From research data
Blum has established that stu
dent drug users tend to be
from wealthier families, dis
satisfied with school, irreligi
ous, and politically leaning
toward the left.
Blum has found that drug use
is often determined by "who
you were with" and that as long
as it does not interfere with
personal relationships, it should
not be an important criteria in
judging others.
Alcohol and tobacco came un
der attack by research
psychiatrist Dr. Jack Sheldon.
"People who smoke today are
suicidal or illiterate" and alco
hol "reduces perceptual acuity"
he maintained.
The facts about marijuana
and LSD are not very well
known, Sheldon said. So far
many of the physical conse
quences are not known and he
pleaded for more investigation
into their effects.
The shift towards the use

marijuana and LSD, which
actually Increase perceptual
acuity, has brought about a
possible change in the political
policies of Johnson and Hump
phrey, Sheldon velieved. "They
have had to change their atti
tude because of a change In
drug use," contended Sheldon.
The medical and psychologi
cal aspects of drugs were cover
ed by Dr. Duke Fisher of UCLA.
"Many people take drugs to
avoid having to with the
notion that there is something
wrong with having such feel
ings so they try to mask them
with drugs.
Looking ahead to future turn
on devices, Fisher speculated
th it ventually electric shocks of
the brain's pleasure center maj
replace drug use. Perhaps, he
suggested, people will "plug in,
turn on, and buzz."
Judge John S. Mclnerny a'id
fd a sobering note to the dis
cussion by stating the penalties
given for drug violations. Except
for minors and people with no
previous drug convictions, all
illegal dealings with narcotics
are felonies.
Mclnerny gave little hope for
the possibilities of legalized
marijuana but thought the best
way to soften the law would be
to give judges the discrimina
tory power of deciding whether
cases of illegal drug use be fel
onies or misdemeanors.
The dialogue begun at last
night's symposium will be
continued tonight at 8 p.m.
with small group discussions
in Wilbur Rlnconada, Junl
pero, and Soto lounges; Bran
er dining room; Roble library.
El Capitan and Breakers eat
ing clubs; Stern Burbank and
Serra; Lagunita Magnolia;
and Crothers Barristers Pub.
Psychiatrists from Cowell and
the Stanford Medical Center
and students with drug exper
ience will lead the groups.

Blum has established that stu
dent drug users tend to be
from wealthier families, dis
satisfied with school, irreligi
ous, and politically leaning
toward the left.
Blum has found that drug use
is often determined by "who
you were with" and that as long
as it does not interfere with
personal relationships, it should
not be an important criteria in
judging others.
Alcohol and tobacco came un
der attack by research
psychiatrist Dr. Jack Sheldon.
"People who smoke today are
suicidal or illiterate" and alco
hol "reduces perceptual acuity"
he maintained.
The facts about marijuana
and LSD are not very well
known, Sheldon said. So far
many of the physical conse
quences are not known and he
pleaded for more investigation
into their effects.
The shift towards the use

marijuana and LSD, which
actually Increase perceptual
acuity, has brought about a
possible change in the political
policies of Johnson and Hump
phrey, Sheldon velieved. "They
have had to change their atti
tude because of a change In
drug use," contended Sheldon.
The medical and psychologi
cal aspects of drugs were cover
ed by Dr. Duke Fisher of UCLA.
"Many people take drugs to
avoid having to with the
notion that there is something
wrong with having such feel
ings so they try to mask them
with drugs.
Looking ahead to future turn
on devices, Fisher speculated
th it ventually electric shocks of
the brain's pleasure center maj
replace drug use. Perhaps, he
suggested, people will "plug in,
turn on, and buzz."
Judge John S. Mclnerny a'id
fd a sobering note to the dis
cussion by stating the penalties
given for drug violations. Except
for minors and people with no
previous drug convictions, all
illegal dealings with narcotics
are felonies.
Mclnerny gave little hope for
the possibilities of legalized
marijuana but thought the best
way to soften the law would be
to give judges the discrimina
tory power of deciding whether
cases of illegal drug use be fel
onies or misdemeanors.
The dialogue begun at last

"We are a drug-using society"
concluded two doctors, a judge,
and a researcher last night in a
symposium on the "Use of
Grass, Acid, and Spe d."
"Social facilitation" is one of
the biggest reasons why nearly
all societies use drugs, reveal d
Richard Blum of Stanford's In
stitute for the Study of Human
Problems. It is useful in "greas
ing the whee's of social inter
course" in societies that are used
to the presence of drugs, h">
added.
However, in urbanized,
stratified societies that have
not had a long history of drug
use, private individual use of
the drug is apt to occur. The
U.S. is the perfect example
of this and Blum contended
that people in this country
have turned their bodies into
"pharmacological laborator
ies." From research data
