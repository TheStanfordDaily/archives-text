## Johnson Confers; Hanoi Silent 
### 
HONOLULU (AP)— U.S. au
thorities portrayed President
Johnson and South Korea's
President Chung Hee Park
Tuesday as in general accord on
Johnson's move to get peace
talks going with North Vietnam.
They reported also that no
message from Hanoi has yet ar
rived in response to U.S. propos
als listing four neutral Asian
capitals as possible sites for
preliminary peace talks.
President Park issued a state
ment in Seoul on the eve of his
departure for a meeting with
President Johnson in Honolulu
saying any settlement should
insure the security of South
Korea and other Asian coun
tries.
His premier, Chung II Kwon,
was more specific, saying: "We
fear any compromise with the
North Vietnamese Communists
would be dangerous."
Foreign Minister Tran Van Do.
of South Vietnam said his gov
ernment has proposd to its al
lies in Vietnam that they hold a
summit meeting before peace
negotiations begin.
North Vietnam continued to
grumble at the United States for
refusing to accept its proposal

that the meeting be held either
in PnomPenh, Cambodia's capi
tal, or Warsaw, in Communist
Poland.
• Memphis Agreement
MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) —
Agreement was reached Tues
day to end a 65-day strike by
1,300 city garbage collectors.
The bitter, racially tinged labor
dispute had brought Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. to Memphis
where he was slain April 4.
The strikers, 98 per cent of
them Negro, cheered wildly as
they unanimously accepted the
agreement which was described
as a "memorandum of under
standing" rather than a formal
contract.
The 13-member city council,
with one dissenting vote, also
approved the agreement but not
before Negro Councilman J. O.
Patterson Jr. accused the gov
erning body of being responsible
for the prolonged work stoppage
and the violence which it
spawned.
The pact calls for a 10-cent
an-hour wage increase May 1
and another 5 cents an hour
Sept. 1, plus union recognition

and dues checkoffs. Sanitation
workers were making from
$1.65 to $2.10 an hour when they
walked off their jobs Feb. 12.
• Paper Hits Soviets
PRAGUE (AP) - Czechoslo
vakia's Communist party openly
implicated the Soviet Union and
agents of Stalins' secret police
Tuesday in the 1948' death of
Foreign Minister* Jan Masaryk.
The stance seemed to dare an
angry reaction from Moscow.
The Czech party newspaper
Rude Pravo said in a page 1
story that there is good reason
to assume that "Masaryk not
only was murdered, but it was a
case of political murder."
It pointed to a Czech-born So
viet NKVD officer, Maj. Franz
Schramm — described in the
article as a man with "connec
tions with the Soviet security
chief Lavrenty Beria's guerrillas
— as the suspected assassin of
Masaryk, the anti - Communist
son of Czechoslovakia's founder
and first president.
• Humphrey To Wait
WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice
President Hubert H. Humphrey

is postponing until next week—
or possibly even later—his for
mal entry into the Democratic
presidential nomination race.
The vice president, back from
a brief vacation in Florida, con
ferred with his advisers Tues
day about his plans. The upshot
seems to be that they see no
need to hurry about plunging
into an active campaign.
The composite judgment of
Humphrey's associates is that
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy of New
York has failed to manufacture
any stampede in his direction
since President Johnson an
nounced that he would not ac
cept renomination.
i Under these circumstances,
Humphrey was said to feel that
his status as vice president and
a potential candidate gives him
some advantages that he might
surrender by a formal an
norncement.
In the view of his advisers,
the work of trying to line up
convention delegates can go
ahead unimpeded.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The
government reported Tuesday a

record dollar increase in the na
tion's economy during the first
three months of this year and
said industrial output climbed to
a new high during March.
In reporting the recora-shat
tering performance for gross
national product—the value of
all goods and service produced
in the economy—the Commerce
Department said prices rose in
the January-March quarter at
an annual rate of 4 per cent.
GNP, the broadest yardstick
of economic activity, accelerated
to a $20 billion advance in the
first quarter to a record annual
rate of $827.3 billion, the Depart

Consumer spending led the

bers of the clergy, were con
victed by a federal jury Tuesday
of mutiiating government prop

erty by pouring blood on draft
board records.
The jury deliberated less than
two hours before handing down
guilty verdicts on three counts
against each defendant.
U.S. District Court Judge Ed
ward S. Northrop dismissed the
jury and announced he would
reconvene the case Wednesday
to consider possible motions.
Defense attorney Fred E.
Weisgal said he would file a mo

• More Poles Purged
WARSAW, Poland (AP) —
Eleven new dismissals, most of
them in the provinces of trou
bled Poland were announced in
the Communist press Wednes
day.
The firings included industrial
directors, district officials and a
sugar beet factory party func
tionary.
The dismissals rared to more
than 60 the number of an
nounced purges from party or
post since widespread student
demonstrations last month set

off the current government
shake-up. Hundreds have been
sacked without publicity, in
formed sources said.
Several of the officials named
Wednesday were Jewish. The
regime has blamed Zionists,
"revisionists" and former Stal
inists for instigating the disturb
ances.
• Stock Market Up
NEW YORK (AP) —Weak
ness in blue chips dragged down
the Dow Jones industrial aver
age Tuesday but, even so, the
market had to be credited with
its fifth straight daily advance.
Trading was active.
The Dow Jones industrial fell
3.41 to 906.78, but gains far out
numbered losses in the list as a
whole, and other major indica
tors advanced.
Of 1,515 issues traded, 790
rose and 522 fell. New highs for
the year totaled 142 and new
lows 11.
The market had a clear-cut
gain in the morning, but it be
came scrambled after news that
a U.S. plaine had been downed
over Haiphong, breeding fears
that the peace talks with North
Vietnam might be snagged.

The Associated Press average
of 60 stocks added .2 at 323.6
with industrials off 1.3, rails up
1.8, and utilities off .6.
Volume was 15.68 million
shares compared with 14.22 mil
lion Monday.
