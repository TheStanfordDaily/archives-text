# Advising Skim
## 
### 
One of the members of the SES Committee on Advising and
Counseling recently called last week's report a "Cooke's tour" of
advising.
The report is exactly that. It skims and samples and never
deals in detail with one important problem. The Committee
should have presented more specific recommendations the first
time around.
Some of the general recommendations however make very
good sense. The idea of having a "University humane officer"
who would oversee advising is good. And the consensus of the
Committee toward keeping advising flexible also is laudable.
The Committee came out for having the University help finance
the fledgling ASSU Course Review and for keeping it inde
pendent of administration and faculty. This proposal is hearten
ing. It presents a challenge to students to produce an objective
course review booklet that will be useful to both faculty and stu
dents.
But the Committee has raised the problem of the status of
advising and has not really decided how to handle it.
More generally what is needed is some sort of concrete reward
for advisers. The Committee too quickly rejected giving money
bonuses, and it also says that it cannot figure out how to reward
faculty for advising through the tenure system.
Such a program could cause every faculty member to re-evalu
ate his own view of advising, much more than any prestigious
University officer or any dictum from above on the importance of
advising.
