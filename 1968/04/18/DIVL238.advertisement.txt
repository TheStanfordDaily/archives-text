esAlen institute
Esalen Institute, located in Big Sur offers, a prgram of experimental education designed for
the holistic exploration of the self, development of awareness, further realization of the human
potential, and discovery of the wholeness and unity which must characterize any effective and
vital approach to learning.
The creative and innovating nature of Esalen's diverse program led Abraham Maslow, presi
dent of the American Psychological Association, to say in a recent talk in Grace Cathedral that
he considers that Esalen is the most exciting experience in education in this countrq today.
