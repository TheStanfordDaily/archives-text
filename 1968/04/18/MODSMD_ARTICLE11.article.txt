We agree wholeheartedly with the secretaries in the Old Union
who had the courage to stand up and fight for decency.
We support decency.
Therefore, in the name of good taste and to protect our chil
dren, we earnestly implore the University to take immediate steps
to remove from our beloved campus the largest circumcised phal

der to think how many visitors to Stanford in the past 2-5 years
have had their sensibilities assaulted by this sordid public atrocity.
Thousands must pass by this vile object every day on their way
to work or study. Thousands more must see it from planes ap

direction, and it is a blot upon our beautiful landscape and the
reputation of our great university.
In the name of everything we hold most dear, Hoover Tower
must go.
