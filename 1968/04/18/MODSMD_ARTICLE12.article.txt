# German Students Intolerant
## 
### Max Lerner 
Americans are not alone.
There is trouble in Europe, too.
There have been student riots,
sit-ins, occupation of college
buildings in Spain, Italy, Poland
and now in West Berlin and
West Germany. In each of these
there has been a different situ
ation into which the student
demonstrations fit.
But the two basic patterns are
those of Poland and West Ber
lin. In Poland (as also in Spain)
the student protest was an ef
fort to liberalize a totalitarian
regime, as the Czech regime is
today being liberalized. In West
Berlin, in the riots over the
wounding of Rudolf Dutschke,
the aim is to paralyze a toler
ably democratic regime which is
r.n ally of the United States.
This follows the pattern of sim
ilar student riots in Japan and
Italy.
The pace of student activism
in West Germany has acceler
ated in a very brief period.
When I lectured in the summer
of 1966 at a number of German
universities I reported on milit
ant student groups on every
campus, but they were militant

chiefly about student grievances.
The only exception was the Free
University of Berlin, operating
partly with American founda
tion funds, where the feeling
was strongly political and anti-
American.
That trend has now reached
the other universities. In Berlin
the wounding of the charismatic
student leader, Rudy Dutschke,
by a demented young Nazi has
given the students on the Left
their dream opportunity to stage
a series of new demonstrations
around a hero-martyr and to in
clude America in their cry of
"Nazi swine" against the police.
In their political orientation
the Dutschke forces are as far
left as you can get without be
coming openly Communist. They
are scornful of the Russians for
having become staid and settled
as a world power, they identify
with Castro, they admire the
Chinese as world revolution
aries. For German reasons they
don't want to stage joint ac
tions with the East German
Communist regime which has
extended them a fraternal em
brace. They are, of course, ob

sessively anti- American and
have not allowed their Vietnam
demonstrations to be altered by
the fact that Washington and
Hanoi are about to start th?
first phase of peace talks.
The question about them is
this: What do they want? Dean
Acheson once said about the
British that they have lost an
empire but have not yet found
a role. The Berlin students have
found a role, in being what they
call an "extra-parliamentary op
position," but they have no im
perium to use it for. They are
caught between an American
imperium they hate, a Soviet
imperium they scorn and a Ger
man regime they despise.
Thoir thinking is vaguely in
a Left-Socialist direction, but
their only action is anti-Ameri
can. They cannot aim at power
for themselves, as the Spartacist
movement did almost half a cen
tury ago under Karl Liebknecht
and Rosa Luxembourg: what
ever hurt they do to the Kiesing
er-Brandt coalition can only help
the deeply reactionary Commu
nist regime of East Germany.
They remind me most of the
fable of th? poor, foolish donkey
dressed up in a lion's skin.
The avowed target of the dem
onstrators is Axel Springer's
press empire, on the theory that
the Springer papers whipped up
feeling against Dutschke and
thus provoked the assassination
attempt. But whether or not
this is true —and it sounds pret
ty hysterical—it makes no sense
to use it as a reason for violence
against the Springer plant,
trucks and workers. Despite the
anti-Nazi slogans of the Dutsch
ke group, one must ask who is
really totalitarian in spirit: the
Berlin government breaking up
the demonstrations or the dem-

onstrators trying to silence a
press they disagree with.
Every free newspaper must
stand with the Springer papers
on this issue of press freedom
from political violence. So
should every student who cares
about a competition of ideas. If
the press in Germany is to be
cowed by left-wing violence, it
will be cowed by right-wing vio
lence as well—and that is the
path back to the Nazis.
What makes the European pic
ture even more dramatic is to
compare the patience of the
West German regime toward
this violence with the way the
Polish regime treated the pro
tests of its own students. The
Polish regime responded with
repression, showing the naked
fist of an old-line Communist
state when faced with intellec
tual criticism. It also responded
with an anti-Jewish propaganda
barrage, seeking to "unmask"
the student response as really
"Zionist" in intent. Finally it
responded by a shakeup of top
military officials and a govern
ment purge.
Actually, the impact of stu
dent protest frightened the re
gime in Poland far more than in
Germany or the United States,
although it brought negative
results. The Berlin students will
continue to make more noise
and get more headlines in the
next few weeks. But the un
answered question remains:
What do they want, other than
to throttle some newspapers?
And where do they want to go?

Americans are not alone.
There is trouble in Europe, too.
There have been student riots,
sit-ins, occupation of college
buildings in Spain, Italy, Poland
and now in West Berlin and
West Germany. In each of these
there has been a different situ
ation into which the student
demonstrations fit.
But the two basic patterns are
those of Poland and West Ber
lin. In Poland (as also in Spain)
the student protest was an ef
fort to liberalize a totalitarian
regime, as the Czech regime is
today being liberalized. In West
Berlin, in the riots over the
wounding of Rudolf Dutschke,
the aim is to paralyze a toler
ably democratic regime which is
r.n ally of the United States.
This follows the pattern of sim
ilar student riots in Japan and
Italy.
The pace of student activism
in West Germany has acceler
ated in a very brief period.
When I lectured in the summer
of 1966 at a number of German
universities I reported on milit
ant student groups on every
campus, but they were militant

chiefly about student grievances.
The only exception was the Free
University of Berlin, operating
partly with American founda
tion funds, where the feeling
was strongly political and anti-
American.
That trend has now reached
the other universities. In Berlin
the wounding of the charismatic
student leader, Rudy Dutschke,
by a demented young Nazi has
given the students on the Left
their dream opportunity to stage
a series of new demonstrations
around a hero-martyr and to in
clude America in their cry of
"Nazi swine" against the police.
In their political orientation
the Dutschke forces are as far
left as you can get without be
coming openly Communist. They
are scornful of the Russians for
having become staid and settled
as a world power, they identify
with Castro, they admire the
Chinese as world revolution
aries. For German reasons they
don't want to stage joint ac
tions with the East German
Communist regime which has
extended them a fraternal em
brace. They are, of course, ob

sessively anti- American and
have not allowed their Vietnam
demonstrations to be altered by
the fact that Washington and
Hanoi are about to start th?
first phase of peace talks.
The question about them is
this: What do they want? Dean
Acheson once said about the
British that they have lost an
empire but have not yet found
a role. The Berlin students have
found a role, in being what they
call an "extra-parliamentary op
position," but they have no im
perium to use it for. They are
caught between an American
imperium they hate, a Soviet
imperium they scorn and a Ger
man regime they despise.
Thoir thinking is vaguely in
a Left-Socialist direction, but
their only action is anti-Ameri
can. They cannot aim at power
for themselves, as the Spartacist
movement did almost half a cen
tury ago under Karl Liebknecht
and Rosa Luxembourg: what
ever hurt they do to the Kiesing
er-Brandt coalition can only help
the deeply reactionary Commu
nist regime of East Germany.
They remind me most of the
fable of th? poor, foolish donkey
dressed up in a lion's skin.
The avowed target of the dem
onstrators is Axel Springer's
press empire, on the theory that
the Springer papers whipped up
feeling against Dutschke and
thus provoked the assassination
attempt. But whether or not
this is true —and it sounds pret
ty hysterical—it makes no sense
to use it as a reason for violence
against the Springer plant,
trucks and workers. Despite the
anti-Nazi slogans of the Dutsch
ke group, one must ask who is
really totalitarian in spirit: the
Berlin government breaking up
the demonstrations or the dem-

onstrators trying to silence a
press they disagree with.
Every free newspaper must
stand with the Springer papers
on this issue of press freedom
from political violence. So
should every student who cares
about a competition of ideas. If
the press in Germany is to be
cowed by left-wing violence, it
will be cowed by right-wing vio
lence as well—and that is the
path back to the Nazis.
What makes the European pic
ture even more dramatic is to
compare the patience of the
West German regime toward
this violence with the way the
Polish regime treated the pro
tests of its own students. The
Polish regime responded with
repression, showing the naked
fist of an old-line Communist
state when faced with intellec
tual criticism. It also responded
with an anti-Jewish propaganda
barrage, seeking to "unmask"
the student response as really
"Zionist" in intent. Finally it
responded by a shakeup of top
military officials and a govern
ment purge.
Actually, the impact of stu
dent protest frightened the re
gime in Poland far more than in
Germany or the United States,
although it brought negative
results. The Berlin students will
continue to make more noise
and get more headlines in the
next few weeks. But the un
answered question remains:
What do they want, other than
to throttle some newspapers?
And where do they want to go?

Americans are not alone.
There is trouble in Europe, too.
There have been student riots,
sit-ins, occupation of college
buildings in Spain, Italy, Poland
and now in West Berlin and
West Germany. In each of these
there has been a different situ
ation into which the student
demonstrations fit.
But the two basic patterns are
those of Poland and West Ber
lin. In Poland (as also in Spain)
the student protest was an ef
fort to liberalize a totalitarian
regime, as the Czech regime is
today being liberalized. In West
Berlin, in the riots over the
wounding of Rudolf Dutschke,
the aim is to paralyze a toler
ably democratic regime which is
r.n ally of the United States.
This follows the pattern of sim
ilar student riots in Japan and
Italy.
The pace of student activism
in West Germany has acceler
ated in a very brief period.
When I lectured in the summer
of 1966 at a number of German
universities I reported on milit
ant student groups on every
campus, but they were militant

chiefly about student grievances.
The only exception was the Free
University of Berlin, operating
partly with American founda
tion funds, where the feeling
was strongly political and anti-
American.
That trend has now reached
the other universities. In Berlin
the wounding of the charismatic
student leader, Rudy Dutschke,
by a demented young Nazi has
given the students on the Left
their dream opportunity to stage
a series of new demonstrations
around a hero-martyr and to in
clude America in their cry of
"Nazi swine" against the police.
In their political orientation
the Dutschke forces are as far
left as you can get without be
coming openly Communist. They
are scornful of the Russians for
having become staid and settled
as a world power, they identify
with Castro, they admire the
Chinese as world revolution
aries. For German reasons they
don't want to stage joint ac
tions with the East German
Communist regime which has
extended them a fraternal em
brace. They are, of course, ob

sessively anti- American and
have not allowed their Vietnam
demonstrations to be altered by
the fact that Washington and
Hanoi are about to start th?
first phase of peace talks.
The question about them is
this: What do they want? Dean
Acheson once said about the
British that they have lost an
empire but have not yet found
a role. The Berlin students have
found a role, in being what they
call an "extra-parliamentary op
position," but they have no im
perium to use it for. They are
caught between an American
imperium they hate, a Soviet
imperium they scorn and a Ger
man regime they despise.
Thoir thinking is vaguely in
a Left-Socialist direction, but
their only action is anti-Ameri
can. They cannot aim at power
for themselves, as the Spartacist
movement did almost half a cen
tury ago under Karl Liebknecht
and Rosa Luxembourg: what
ever hurt they do to the Kiesing
er-Brandt coalition can only help
the deeply reactionary Commu
nist regime of East Germany.
They remind me most of the
fable of th? poor, foolish donkey
dressed up in a lion's skin.
The avowed target of the dem
onstrators is Axel Springer's
press empire, on the theory that
the Springer papers whipped up
feeling against Dutschke and
thus provoked the assassination
attempt. But whether or not
this is true —and it sounds pret
ty hysterical—it makes no sense
to use it as a reason for violence
against the Springer plant,
trucks and workers. Despite the
anti-Nazi slogans of the Dutsch
ke group, one must ask who is
really totalitarian in spirit: the
Berlin government breaking up
the demonstrations or the dem-

onstrators trying to silence a
press they disagree with.
Every free newspaper must
stand with the Springer papers
on this issue of press freedom
from political violence. So
should every student who cares
about a competition of ideas. If
the press in Germany is to be
cowed by left-wing violence, it
will be cowed by right-wing vio
lence as well—and that is the
path back to the Nazis.
What makes the European pic
ture even more dramatic is to
compare the patience of the
West German regime toward
this violence with the way the
Polish regime treated the pro
tests of its own students. The
Polish regime responded with
repression, showing the naked
fist of an old-line Communist
state when faced with intellec
tual criticism. It also responded
with an anti-Jewish propaganda
barrage, seeking to "unmask"
the student response as really
"Zionist" in intent. Finally it
responded by a shakeup of top
military officials and a govern
ment purge.
Actually, the impact of stu
dent protest frightened the re
gime in Poland far more than in
Germany or the United States,
although it brought negative
results. The Berlin students will
continue to make more noise
and get more headlines in the
next few weeks. But the un
answered question remains:
What do they want, other than
to throttle some newspapers?
And where do they want to go?
