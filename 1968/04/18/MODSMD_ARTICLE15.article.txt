## Army Isn't So Bad, Says Former Resistance Member 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
On March 15 I refused induc
tion at the Oakland induction
center. On April 3 I reconsider
ed and was inducted into the
U.S. Army.
I am now going through basic
training and I know now that
I made the right decision. Re
fusing induction is a noble, hut
wasteful gesture. Sure, if you
go to jail you've shown cour
age and helped to insure p<>ace
for your unborn children, but
you've wasted your potential for
working for peace the rest of
your life. I don't have to enumer

ate the ways in which a con
victed felon is limited in his abil
ity to do something about his
beliefs.
The Army looks like an in
human machine from the out
side, but once you're inside it
you find that 99 per cent of your
fellow soldiers feel the same way
you do about being inducted.
The grind is rough, but the
discipline can be very beneficial.
No one has ever achieved any
thing worthwhile without the
proper discipline, and the train
ing you get in tho Army en
ables you to do everything you

undertake better and more effec
tively.
With the recent course of the
election campaign, you know
there isn't as much danger of
going to Vietnam.
I would like to apologize to
my friends at Stanford that I
didn't say goodbye to them he
fore I left. I wasn't too sure
that I was doing the right thing
and felt a bit ashamed.
To my brothers in the Resis
tance I would like to say it's
not too late to reconsider. Do
what Kennedy did; compromise
and wait until the circumstances

enable you to do something ef
fective. Don't throw yourself at
the juggernaut; it will grind
you under without slowing down.
To stop a tank, aim for the
tread, don't throw yourself at
the cannon barrel.
