# The 						Great Art Controversy:
## Is Protection From Art Needed? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Those few of us who were for
tunate enough to see the Michael
Barnes exhibit are grateful to
the artist and to Mr. Joseph Jedd
for allowing the sterile walls of
the Old Union to be graced, how
ever briefly, by Mr. Barne's pro
vocative paintings.
I thought the exhibit was ex
cellent, and without the slightest
hesitation, I freely recommend
ed it to freshmen at Wilbur. It
did not cross my mind that the

exhibit was in any way improp
er, nor did I dream that tho Uni
versity could be so juvenile as
to ban it.
I am very sorry indeed that
some staff members and some
ossified troglodytes in the ad
ministration were offended by
the exhibit, but that they should
be offended by a serious and
tasteful comment on our society
is their problem—a very serious
one to be sure. The rest of
the university community not

bo deprived of the privilege
of having serious art displayed
in the student affairs building.
How can the University justify
allowing its policy on art ex
hibits to be determin<d by the
least qra'ifi d elements?
May I suggest that some wax
be found to permit art exhibits
in the Old Union while at the
same time providing sonr
anism to protect the blissfully
complacent and intolerant? Her
are some proposals:
1. Post a large "BEWARE OE
ART" sign outside the front en
trance, and below, in small print,
give directions to an alternate
entrance which will be free of
artistic contamination.
2. The University could se'l
blinders at the entrance to the
Old Union. The b'inders, similar
to the ones worn by race horses,
would prevent retinal damage
from aesthetic light rays coming
in from the sides.
3. A system of arrows and
lines of various shapes and
colors could be painted on the
floors. Maps could be provided
at k<>y points, and the diligent
Philistine could traverse the Old
Union without raising his head.
4. Before each exhibit, the
University should sponsor a lec
ture by the Art Department to
explain the work of the artist.
Staff members should be per
mitted to attend the lecture on
company time, and psychiatrists
from the Health Center should
be present to help those ob
viously in need.
Surely something can be done
to break this impasse between
the Art Department and the Ad
ministration.
Finally, I would like to remind
those who were so traumatized
by Mr. Barnes's paintings that,
as Lenny Bruce used to say, if
you have any complaints about
your body or its functions, please
take them directly to the maker,
not the legislature or the Dean's
Office.

Death, Copulation
Are Common In Art
Editor, The Daily:
So Michael Barnes' exhibition
of art at the Old Union had to
come down because a handful
of clucking secretaries were re
volted by the juxtaposition on
canvas of nudity and household
appliances.
If they cannot understand this
rather palpable symbolism, if
they cannot pass by it with their
pious eyes averted, why should
others lose the opportunity to
see it? Mantegna's San Sebas
tian stands with a cross-bow
shaft in his chest; Bosch's naked
cadavers infest rotting animals.
Death, copulation and horror
have always been the subject
of art; seen through different
eyes in differing times they al
ways will be. Kandinsky's spots
were burned by the Nazi as "de
codent"; McClure's The Beard
was invaded by the police as
"obscene"; now some semi-erot
ic realism at Stanford is attack
ed as "sordid".
Alas, tempora mutantur, non
mores!

Did Art Department
Steal Vacuum Cleaner?
Editor, The Dally:
Tho article on the removal of
the art exhibit from the Old
Union interested us a great deal.
Mr. Barnes' use of household ap
pliances in art is certainly an
imaginative addition to compo
sition. As it happens, our vacuum
e'eaner has been missing for
several months, a source of great
frustration to us both.
We now have hope that som
members of the art department
may have a clue to its where
abouts, and we wish to make
plea to who has any i n
formation about our vacuum
cleaner to come forward, as it
is of enormous sentimental va'
ue.

Death, Copulation

Editor, The Daily:
So Michael Barnes' exhibition
of art at the Old Union had to
come down because a handful
of clucking secretaries were re
volted by the juxtaposition on
canvas of nudity and household
appliances.
If they cannot understand this
rather palpable symbolism, if
they cannot pass by it with their
pious eyes averted, why should
others lose the opportunity to
see it? Mantegna's San Sebas
tian stands with a cross-bow
shaft in his chest; Bosch's naked
cadavers infest rotting animals.
Death, copulation and horror
have always been the subject
of art; seen through different
eyes in differing times they al
ways will be. Kandinsky's spots
were burned by the Nazi as "de
codent"; McClure's The Beard
was invaded by the police as
"obscene"; now some semi-erot
ic realism at Stanford is attack
ed as "sordid".
Alas, tempora mutantur, non

Death, Copulation

Editor, The Daily:
So Michael Barnes' exhibition
of art at the Old Union had to
come down because a handful
of clucking secretaries were re
volted by the juxtaposition on
canvas of nudity and household
appliances.
If they cannot understand this
rather palpable symbolism, if
they cannot pass by it with their
pious eyes averted, why should
others lose the opportunity to
see it? Mantegna's San Sebas
tian stands with a cross-bow
shaft in his chest; Bosch's naked
cadavers infest rotting animals.
Death, copulation and horror
have always been the subject
of art; seen through different
eyes in differing times they al
ways will be. Kandinsky's spots
were burned by the Nazi as "de
codent"; McClure's The Beard
was invaded by the police as
"obscene"; now some semi-erot
ic realism at Stanford is attack
ed as "sordid".
Alas, tempora mutantur, non

Mr. Barnes' use of household ap
