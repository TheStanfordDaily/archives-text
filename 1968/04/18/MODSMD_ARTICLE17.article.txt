# The 						Washington Merry-Go-Round
## TV Inspired Washington Rioting 
### Drew Pearson 
WASHINGTON — With the
nation facing one war in South
east Asia and a series of very
dangerous wars in the big cities,
the American Society of News
paper Editors, now meeting in
Washington, may want to con
sider current distortions of tele
vision news and some form of
voluntary censorship.
The issue arises because of
the irrefutable fact that recent
race riots have been partly in
spired by television, and the fact
that Negroes have felt com
pelled to stage acts for the bene
fit of the TV cameras.
This first became evident after
the Little Rock school integra
tion disturbances, which neces
sitated calling out federal
troops. Afterward it was re
vealed that TV producers paid
white youths to pick a fight
with Negro school children in
order to create drama for the
TV screen.
More recently in Memphis it
was obvious that Negroes were
"acting" by waving sticks and
shouting in front of the TV
cameras during the first Mem
phis march of Martin Luther
King. And there is some doubt
that the Washington looting
would ever have become ser
ious but for the obtrusion of
television.
Here is how Philip Geyelin of
the Washington Post describes
the manner in which TV, which
he describes as "The Almighty

Eye," inspired rioting in the na
tion's capital. One fire had been
started, but there was no racial
hostility, Geyelin reported.
"It was more like an event,
or a curiosity, and the tension
was in wondering whether the
cascades of water could shield
the nearby houses....
"It wasn't even a very big
audience, considering the spec
tacle. A block or so away, peo
ple were sitting on front stoops,
or clustering on street corners,
talking, laughing, arguing,
bored.
On Stage
"Then it happened. Abruptly,
from a group of fire-watchers
perched on an embankment
there was a flurry of fist-shak
ing and a cacaphony of angry
cries—'Honky,' and 'You killed
our soul brother,' and 'You
killed Martin Luther King.'...
"Every bit of it was aimed at
the funnel-shaped snout of a
television camera," continued
Geyelin. "The medium had
moved in. As the cameraman
panned across the crowd, it was
as if some unseen director was
calling out cues. It was Instant
Showbiz.
"The men on the embankment
grabbed a grinning Negro fire
man and held his arms aloft,
demanding that this soul broth
er who was a fireman be made
fire chief. The fireman laughed
self-consciously and shook them
off and went about his work.

But the camera kept grinding
and the young men played to it
and finally an Army jeep drove
up and somebody put in a radio
call. In a matter of minutes, the
police were there, swooping in
with sirens going. . . . Round
cannisters (of tear gas) rolled
after the people. .. .
"It became a game. 'We're
going, sir, we're going, boss,'
they chanted in taunting voices,
moving with exaggerated strides
in a show of mock deference.
. . . One woman couldn't help

laughing as she hitched up her
skirts and skipped a little faster
before the gas had a chance to
spread. . . .
"It was over as quickly as it
had begun, and the police joked
as they coughed and rubbed
their eyes. ... You could tell it
any way you liked: The head
lines could have said: POLICE
ROUT ANGRY MOB AT SITE
OF BLAZE. Or you could have
told it like it was—a piece of
theater, inspired, produced and
directed by the Almighty Eye."

The point is that thousands of
Negroes watching this drama
on TV had no idea that it was
chiefly inspired for the benefit
of the TV audience. So the riot
ing spread. Some of it, it is true,
had been planned by young
Negro militants. But 99 per cent
of the Negro population of
Washington was against the
riots, and this militant minority
would have had little success
had it not been for their No. 1
ally—the Almighty Eye.
