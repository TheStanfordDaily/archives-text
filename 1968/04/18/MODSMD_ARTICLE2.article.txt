# Favorable Letter Removed
## Exhibit Dispute Continues 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Joseph Jedd, who was in
charge of the controversial art
show in the Old Union, complain
ed that a letter he posted prais
ing Michael Barnes' paintings
was torn down by some women
who had worked in the building.
He noted that the women,
"older ladies," were the same
ones who had originally com
plained about the exhibit, calling
it "vile and obscene" and de
manding its removal from the
lobby.
The letter Jedd posted con
sisted of excerpts from a letter
from Jean Van Winkle, a sec

retary in the department of art
and architecture.
The posted letter read: "To
strip the facade off man's un
earned innocence without com
promise has been the task of the
artist throughout all history.
Visual jolts are often more diffi
cult to endure than written or
spoken words.
"Michael Barnes painted the
essence of elements of human
existence sensitively, effectively,
and necessarily. His exhibition
of paintings and prints was dis
mantled — one day after its
opening — because of protest."
After the notices were torn

down, Jedd had new copies
made and posted.
Provost Richard Lyman ex
plained the University's policy
on art exihibits:
"We're not in the business
of censoring art exhibits," he
said. "But when there is a
captive audience and the ex
hibit can be reasonably expect
ed to shock the sensibilities of
certain people, the show must
be removed."
He mentioned this was not the
first time such an incident oc
curred in recent years, noting
another painting show in Encina
Hall in March of 1966, and an

exhibition of photographs in
Tresidder about a year ago.
Joel Smith, dean of students,
again declined to comment on
the affair.
Neither he nor Lyman would
reveal whose decision it was to
order the paintings taken down.
Lorenz Eitner, executive head
of the Department of Art and
Architecture, said that the de
partment had "no policy about
student paintings. The only in
volvement of the Art Depart
ment is that the students are
students of ours."
He also said that Jedd's ar
rangement to have the Masters
students In art exhibit their
works in the Old Union was
made only with the students.
"We exert no influence on ei
ther our students or Mr. Jedd,"
Eitner said.
%
He said that yesterday's
statement that the department
would no longer exhibit in ad
ministrative buildings was ir
relevant, since the department
did not sponsor the controver
sial show.
Eitner noted that the only lo
cations in which the art depart
ment sponsored shows were the
art museum and gallery.
He also commented that "no
one should be forced to look at
a painting he doesn't want to
see. On the other hand, no one
should tell the artist what to ex
hibit."
Frank Lobdell, associate pro
fessor of art, said, "If the work
is disturbing even to a minority,
this is a public building and the
exhibit should be removed."
The agreement with Jedd to
show the work of the gradu
ate students "was entered into
with the understanding that
if it proved worthwhile for
the people who were seeing
the exhibition and for the
graduate students it would be
continued," Lobdell empha
sized.

Provost Richard Lyman ex
plained the University's policy
on art exihibits:
"We're not in the business
of censoring art exhibits," he
said. "But when there is a
captive audience and the ex
hibit can be reasonably expect
ed to shock the sensibilities of
certain people, the show must
be removed."
He mentioned this was not the
first time such an incident oc
curred in recent years, noting
another painting show in Encina
Hall in March of 1966, and an

exhibition of photographs in
Tresidder about a year ago.
Joel Smith, dean of students,
again declined to comment on
the affair.
Neither he nor Lyman would
reveal whose decision it was to
order the paintings taken down.
Lorenz Eitner, executive head
of the Department of Art and
Architecture, said that the de
partment had "no policy about
student paintings. The only in
volvement of the Art Depart
ment is that the students are
students of ours."
He also said that Jedd's ar
rangement to have the Masters
students In art exhibit their
works in the Old Union was
made only with the students.
"We exert no influence on ei
ther our students or Mr. Jedd,"
Eitner said.
%
He said that yesterday's
statement that the department
would no longer exhibit in ad
ministrative buildings was ir
relevant, since the department
did not sponsor the controver
sial show.
Eitner noted that the only lo
cations in which the art depart
ment sponsored shows were the
art museum and gallery.
He also commented that "no
one should be forced to look at
a painting he doesn't want to
see. On the other hand, no one
should tell the artist what to ex
hibit."
Frank Lobdell, associate pro
fessor of art, said, "If the work
is disturbing even to a minority,
this is a public building and the
exhibit should be removed."
The agreement with Jedd to
show the work of the gradu
ate students "was entered into
with the understanding that
if it proved worthwhile for
the people who were seeing
the exhibition and for the
graduate students it would be
continued," Lobdell empha
sized.
Joseph Jedd, who was in
charge of the controversial art
show in the Old Union, complain
ed that a letter he posted prais
ing Michael Barnes' paintings
was torn down by some women
who had worked in the building.
He noted that the women,
"older ladies," were the same
ones who had originally com
plained about the exhibit, calling
it "vile and obscene" and de
manding its removal from the
lobby.
The letter Jedd posted con
sisted of excerpts from a letter
from Jean Van Winkle, a sec

retary in the department of art
and architecture.
The posted letter read: "To
strip the facade off man's un
earned innocence without com
promise has been the task of the
artist throughout all history.
Visual jolts are often more diffi
cult to endure than written or
spoken words.
"Michael Barnes painted the
essence of elements of human
existence sensitively, effectively,
and necessarily. His exhibition
of paintings and prints was dis
mantled — one day after its
opening — because of protest."
After the notices were torn

down, Jedd had new copies
made and posted.
