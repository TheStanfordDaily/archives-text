# Profs Assail Berlin Shooting
## 
### 
Four history instructors con
cerned about the present situa
tion in Germany are presently
circulating an open letter which
they plan to send to Berlin later
this week. The instructors are
Robert Baker, Charles Korr,
Peter S. Stern, and Robert
Wheeler.
The letter, which denounces
the recent attempt to assassin
ate a student leader in West
Berlin, reads as follows:
"We the undersigned, mem
bers of the Stanford academic
community, deplore the cow
ardly attack on the life of Rudi
Dutschke. We cannot condemn
too strongly those elements in

the city of West Berlin, espe
cially in the press and in the
government, which, through
their statements and actions,
are primarily responsible for
the climate of hate and fear,
the 'Pogromstimmung' against
students and intellectuals, that
is present in their city.
"We call upon the people of
West Berlin to reject the hate
mongers and the demagogues
and to demand from their gov
ernment that freedom of speech,
freedom of person, and freedom
of movement, be protected and
respected in their city for all
persons, however unpopular
their ideas may be. Let West

Berlin demonstrate that she is
in /act free and democratic.
"We call upon the representa
tives of the American people
in West Berlin, diplomatic, mili
tary, business and academic, to
support the basic freedoms de
scribed above in word and deed
in all their contacts with the
people and government of the
city. Furthermore we strongly
urge them to avoid any action
which might be misconstrued as
direct or indirect support of

those elements which are pois
oning the climate of West Berlin.
"Finally we wish to express
our solidarity with the academic
communities in West Berlin. We
sincerely hope that they will
persevere in their quest for
truth and knowledge. They are
the bulwark against reaction
and the hope of true democrats
everywhere. May they be suc
cessful in combatting the ghost
of the past that haunts Ger
many today.^^
