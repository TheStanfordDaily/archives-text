# King Memorial Fund Solicits Student, Faculty Contributions
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
Students, faculty and staff,
are being asked to contribute
part of the money necessary to
carry out Stanford's new com
mitments to minority student
enrollment and employment of
minorities.
As part of various responses
to the Martin Luther King, Jr.
Memorial Fund since King's
death, two University residences,
Roble Hall and Phi Delta Theta
fraternity, have indicated that
they will contribute.
In a speech to the 1968 Senior
Fund volunteers Monday, Pro
vost Richard Lyman stressed
the need for Stanford to find
additional funds to meet the
new commitments. He said

Stanford is stretched "far thin
ner financially than most people
realize."
In a letter to be mailed to
all students today. Rod Levine
and Warren Lyons, co-chair
men of the student drive
raise contributions, state that
the primary task for Stanford
remains in "the education of
the leaders of society."
The decision of Stanford to
double minority student enroll
ment as part of this task means
a program, which "like all other
University commitments, must
be paid for by a substantial
number of gifts," the letter con
tinues.
A number of the funds that
were proposed after King's
death are now being merged in
the expanded Martin Luther
King, Jr. Memorial Fund.
Robert Hind, associate dean of
undergraduate education, urged
faculty and administration mem
bers in a letter Monday to join
him "in endorsing this broaden
ing of the opportunity to partic
ipate in the Fund." Hind had
earlier endorsed a plan for Uni
versity members to donate 10
per cent of their monthly salary
to a scholarship fund to be
matched by the University.
The exact cost to the Uni
versity of the new programs
still has not been definitely
determined. Kenneth Cuth
bertson, vice-president for fi
nance, estimates that they
will range from $600,000 to $1
million.
Reallocation of present Uni
versity funds could provide only
limited help in meeting the new
commitments, Lyman said Mon
day.
"We cannot do this job simply
by taking scholarships away
from white students and giving
them to black," he said. "I can

not think of a quicker path to
disaster than that."
In attempting to assist in
meeting the costs involved, Re
ligion Prof. William Clebsch, co
chairman of the Fund, said
there are two important areas
where contributions could be
used.
"The costs of financial aid for
minority students is going to be
predictably enormous," C'ebsch
said. But he added that Stanford
will also have to cope with the
costs of "recruiting and train
ing minority group employees."
Owing to King's death orga
nizers of the Fund felt "the mat
ter was on people's conscience
and that they would welcome a
chance to contribute," stated
Clebsch.
Members of the student
drive, according to co-chair
man Rod Levine, see the King
Fund as "one of the few events
that is so important that
everyone should be allowed to
participate in contributions."
The Student Development
Committee, which is sponsoring
the student drive, also hopes
that through personal contact
with each University student
can point out the financial
costs of meeting University com
mitments.
Roble residents specified
Thursday the three house activ
ities which will be financed from
their general fund during spring
quarter.
With eighty-two per cent of
the girls voting, the group
agreed overwhelmingly to se
verely cut back the number of
social events planned for the
quarter.
The house plans to donate the
remaining general funds, esti
mated to be $800, to the King
Fund, but will wait until the end
of the year to allow for pay
ment of unforseen bills.
