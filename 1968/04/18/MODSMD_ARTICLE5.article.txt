# Institute Heads Speak
## Esalen Meditation Debated 
### BARBARA RITZ 
Michael Murphy and Richard
Baker of Big Sur's Esalen Insti
tute discussed aspects of the
Esalen program last night in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
This second talk in a series of
lectures on the Human Potential
touched off a debate between the
value of traditional meditation
versus the new encounter
groups.
When asked to define medita
tion, Baker explained it as "an
aim to experience yourself be
fore you think and act." He com
pared this meditation to seeing
a series of billboards along the
road, then stepping down to see
a greater landscape beyond. It
changes your center of aware
ness, he said.
Murphy called the encounter

groups a way of "knocking down
the billboards." He explained
that the encounter groups were
a way of experiencing the pres
ent moment.
"The domain of these mod
ern ways of growth are more
inclusive," he said. "There is a
tremendous amount of inquiry
of being."
Various people in the audi
ence questioned the basic defi
nitions of sensory awareness,
meditation and encounter
groups.
"We can't tell how much you
know what we're talking about,"
they explained, explaining the
need to experience the feeling
before you can talk about it.
Murphy believes that the mod
ern ways of growth like en
counter groups can awaken our

senses. Baker explained that the
traditional ways of mysticism,
like Zen, have gathered wisdom
more practical for spiritual
growth.
"In our society," they ex
plained, "we tend to have physi
cal freedom, not mental free
dom." Baker explained that the
practice of Yoga and Zen in the
Eastern cultures has created a
type of freedom of thought.
"There are different ways of
viewing things in the Orient, it's
a more spacedbased culture."
They explained that such a
space-based culture includes the
collective past, present and fu
ture. You experience the feel
ing of consciousness, they said.
They called both LSD and
Zen body experiences. The idea
of Zen is having a "world in
which mind and bodv are one."
