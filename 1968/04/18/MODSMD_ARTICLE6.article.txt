# Olympic Boycott Leader Calls Track Coach Racist
## 
### THOMAS DAWSON 
Black militant-professor Har
ry Edwards pointed his finger
at Olympic track coach Payton
Jordan yesterday in Dinkelspiel
and said, "You have about as
much business running an ath
letic team that contains minori
ty-group people as Adolf Hitler
has being Grand Marshall of
Israel's Maccabean Games."
Edwards, one of the orga
nizers of the boycott by black
athletes of the United States
Olympic team appeared with
Jordan in a discussion on "the

Role of Black Athletes." Jordan
is the track coach for the 1968
team.
Edwards attacked Jordan
for being a "racist" and "dev
il" saying that the coaches are
some of the biggest racists in
America. He also noted that
for the great numbers of
black athletes there are very
few black coaches. Edwards
also revealed that Ramparts
magazine is preparing an ar
ticle on Jordan which will at
tack his "racist" practices.
He said that his proposed boy
cott is "not fun and games." It
Is "one of the few remaining
non-violent avenues open to
black people to express their
plight in this racist country that
we live in." Edwards said that
the boycott is a political move
'on the part of black athletes
in this country to get their
plight before the entire world
of thirty million black people
in this country."
Edwards, who recently joined
the Black Panther movement,
said athletes are only on the
track field a few hours everv

day and that they spend the
rest of their time "in the same
garbage heap that most of the
black people in this society live
their lives out in."
In addition, he said that
even though black athletes are
praised for their athletic abil
ity, they are left out when it
comes to the lucrative prod
uct endorsements that can
double a star athlete's income.
In response to Jordan's open
ing speech, in which he cited
many of the great black ath
letes of the past and the pres
ent, Edwards replied that he
was not interested in a chroni
cle of the past accomplishments
of black athletes. "I am
certain that the entire world
knows that we are able to run
and jump and play basketball
and jump through hoops . . ."
Edwards asserted that the
important thing is not what
black athletes have done, "but
what this country has done to
black athletes."
He furthermore attacked the
recently-passed civil rights bill
as being too weak, since it cov

ers only 80 per cent of the hous
ing in the United States. Ed
wards suggested that the proper
thing to do might be "to burn
down 20 per cent of the housing
and that way . . . everyone will
be living in eighty per cent of
the housing."
The blacks are beyond "the
uncle Jesse Owens" era, he said.
They do not have any sense of
black identity. . if it is nec
essary for a man to run a 9.1
hundred yard dash or a ten flat
hundred meters to be recog
nized as a human being, then
most of the people on the face
of this earth wouldn't be recog
nized as human beings. . . . We
don't think it is necessary for a
person to be an athlete to be a
human being in this supposedly
democratic society."
The San Jose professor said
that until black people are ac
corded the status of human
beings, you can forget about
gold medals . . . because a dog
with a blue ribbon on is still
a dog and is conceived of as a
dog. He still can't oome and
eat with the master."

They do not have any sense of
black identity. . if it is nec
essary for a man to run a 9.1
hundred yard dash or a ten flat
hundred meters to be recog
nized as a human being, then
most of the people on the face
of this earth wouldn't be recog
nized as human beings. . . . We
don't think it is necessary for a
person to be an athlete to be a
human being in this supposedly
democratic society."
The San Jose professor said
that until black people are ac
corded the status of human
beings, you can forget about
gold medals . . . because a dog
with a blue ribbon on is still
a dog and is conceived of as a
dog. He still can't oome and
eat with the master."
Black militant-professor Har
ry Edwards pointed his finger
at Olympic track coach Payton
Jordan yesterday in Dinkelspiel
and said, "You have about as
much business running an ath
letic team that contains minori
ty-group people as Adolf Hitler
has being Grand Marshall of
Israel's Maccabean Games."
Edwards, one of the orga
nizers of the boycott by black
athletes of the United States
Olympic team appeared with
Jordan in a discussion on "the

Role of Black Athletes." Jordan
is the track coach for the 1968
team.
Edwards attacked Jordan
for being a "racist" and "dev
il" saying that the coaches are
some of the biggest racists in
America. He also noted that
for the great numbers of
black athletes there are very
few black coaches. Edwards
also revealed that Ramparts
magazine is preparing an ar
ticle on Jordan which will at
tack his "racist" practices.
He said that his proposed boy
cott is "not fun and games." It
Is "one of the few remaining
non-violent avenues open to
black people to express their
plight in this racist country that
we live in." Edwards said that
the boycott is a political move
'on the part of black athletes
in this country to get their
plight before the entire world
of thirty million black people
in this country."
Edwards, who recently joined
the Black Panther movement,
said athletes are only on the
track field a few hours everv

day and that they spend the
rest of their time "in the same
garbage heap that most of the
black people in this society live
their lives out in."
In addition, he said that
even though black athletes are
praised for their athletic abil
ity, they are left out when it
comes to the lucrative prod
uct endorsements that can
double a star athlete's income.
In response to Jordan's open
ing speech, in which he cited
many of the great black ath
letes of the past and the pres
ent, Edwards replied that he
was not interested in a chroni
cle of the past accomplishments
of black athletes. "I am
certain that the entire world
knows that we are able to run
and jump and play basketball
and jump through hoops . . ."
Edwards asserted that the
important thing is not what
black athletes have done, "but
what this country has done to
black athletes."
He furthermore attacked the
recently-passed civil rights bill
as being too weak, since it cov

ers only 80 per cent of the hous
ing in the United States. Ed
wards suggested that the proper
thing to do might be "to burn
down 20 per cent of the housing
and that way . . . everyone will
be living in eighty per cent of
the housing."
The blacks are beyond "the
uncle Jesse Owens" era, he said.
They do not have any sense of
