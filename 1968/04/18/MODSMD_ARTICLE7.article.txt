# Student Interaction
## CRE: Force For Change? 
### PATRICK McMAHON SUSAN SWARD 
Stanford is a lonely place.
"The atmosphere is highly aca
demic, but the emphasis seems
to lie in and competitive
achievement, rather than in a
truly effective sharing of the in
tellectual life among students
and faculty or even among stu
dents themselves," summarized
John D. Black, director of Coun
seling and Testing Service, from
two recent studies.
One of the studies ranked
Stanford students in the top
two per cent nationally in aware
ness — the search for personal,
poetic and political meaning in
life.
The combination of awareness
of social problems and a lonely
atmosphere has led in part to
the Community for Relevant Ed
ucation (CRE) which involves
nearly 1000 adults in the area
and some 200 Stanford students.
CRE has come under fire, how
ever, as being an Up With Peo
ple, moral re-armament, white
missionary, sentimental, collec
tion of people who are interested
in change but at the same time
supporting and drawn from the
institutions that need to be de
stroyed.
Founded during fall quar
ter, CRE is based on a need
for more effective personal re
lationships. Specifically by us
ing encounter-group dynamic
techniques in small groups of
students and adults in the lo
cal community, CRE combats

some of the frustrations and
loneliness of Stanford with a
plan of action.
These groups (CRE calls them
relevance groups) are relatively
new efforts for people to become
less defensive and more aware
of their personal feelings
through small groups.
There are several kinds of
relevance groups at Stanford.
The Counseling and Testing
Center carries on "Project En

counter" involving 100 students,
faculty, and staff, which speci
fically helps to counter anxieties
in people. In the Speech and
Drama department, Professor
Helen Schrader has been a prime
mover in what she calls "human
groups," learning groups deal
ing with the human potential.
The Department of Psychiatry
offers its interns an optional "T
-group" experience in the sum
mers; sponsors and other upper
classmen take part with fresh
men in non-directed discussion
groups; and the Midpeninsula
Free University and the Univer
sity Christian Movement use
group dynamic methods in much
of their work.
The distinction between many
of these groups and the Com
munity For Relevant Education
is that the "relevance" groups
are "action or goal oriented,"
while many of the others are
"process-oriented." The distinc
tions are manifest in such areas
as the interaction in the group.
One student who has taken
part in several kinds of these
groups suggested that in CRE
the effort is directed at "over
coming differences between peo
ple" effectively aimed at getting
them to all work together to
ward one goal. In other groups,
however, the person said she felt
that there was no end goal in
sight, but only an interacting
group per se.
A typical CRE encounter be
gins when a group leader and
his group (there is quite a bit
of emphasis on leadership
within the relevance group)
sit down and he suggests that
all the group are merely hu
man beings and that "we have
no reason to be afraid of each
other. We all have the same
hang-ups, so we know what
it's like. We can all trust each
other." The group is then di
rected to tell each other what
the others in the group think
of them.
The group then goes about
shaping itself into a smoothly
working organization that can
get things done. "We want to do
something. We have to take ac
tion," explained one member.
And they do. The march after
Martin Luther King's death was
spirited by the Community and
related groups. Projects includ
ing a Christmas House, a East

Palo Alto project, and a National
Service program are outgrowths
of this movement.
"One purpose . . . will be to
experience a form of education
which stresses the development
of personal awareness and po
tential. At the most fundamental
level we must discard self-isola
tion and re-discover communica
tion. In small group discussions
we will explore the inner world
and its relation to action in shap
ing the outer world," a pam
phlet reads.
The group's philosophy is par
tially expressed in a quotation
from Teilhard de Chardin which
is on the pamphlet cover: "The
task before us now, if we would
not perish, is to build the earth."
How did CRE get its start?
CRE Is centered around a
number of activities and ideas
initiated by a group called
"New Sphere." New Sphere
Itself was an outgrowth of a
philosophy practiced by Ame
lia and Harry Rathbun. The
Rathbuns are faculty residents
in fraternity cluster No. 1.
Rathbun is an Emeritus Pro
fessor of Eaw and Business.
The .Rathbuns have been as
sociated with forming relevance
groups with students and adults
in the community for the last
twenty-five years. This type of
activity has spread, according
to Amelia Rathbun, to Foothill
College, UC Santa Cruz, Cabril
lo, San Jose State, Berkeley, San
Francisco State, Davis and Sac
ramento State.
The various organizations
spirited by the Rathbuns and
others vary in activities and
goals and tend to change their
names often. New Sphere was
only very recently renamed
"Challenge to Change." Mrs.
Rathbun explains that there
is no over-all pattern of organi
zation of New Sphere. As goals
shift, the people heading the
group at the moment shift.
CRE, according to Mrs. Rath
bun, "more like an organism,"
organizes itself around specific
goals. The theme of the whole
organization is "to build indivi
dualism and independence."
CRE, anxious to spread the
word of their organization, was
once called Community for Rele
vant Education in the World
(CREW). Since then the group
has dropped the "W". According
to Mrs. Rathbun, the "W" was
dropped because the students
felt they wanted the universal
implications to be implied. Also,
the group didn't want to be con
fused with a nautical group on
campus by the same name.
Another organization that
is loosely tied with the others
is "Build the Earth." Former
ly "Women to Women Work
ing to Build the Earth For
The Children's Sake" and then
simply "Women to Women
Working to Build the Earth,"
Build the Earth is headed by
a board of one-hundred wom
en "who are carefully select
ed," according to Eemlia Rath
bun.
Build the Earth demonstrates
a "hope that it could achieve
something positive, a festival of
good will. We have relevant ed
ucation courses with the empha
sis on a woman's existence be
ing relevant to social problems
of the day."
National Service Foundation,
a group of people in the com
munity interested in setting up
an alternative to the monolithic
selective service system, main
tains, "The goal is to shift the
attitude of this country, and
eventually of the world, from
one of narrow self-interest to
one of positive and willing con

tribution to build the earth for
all people."
National Service, which has
been highly controversial on
campus, has been evolving for
some time. National Service is
not a new idea. It was first sug
gested by William James, psy
chologist and philosopher, at
Stanford in 1906. Essentially the
program calls for all Americans
to serve their country in a civi
lian or military capacity.
National Service Foundation,
however, feels that the program
should be voluntary. The pro
posal states, "At age 18 all men
and women will have the oppor
tunity to apply for National
Service through the National
Service System. For men, this
application will be coupled with
registration for selective ser
vice."
The groups have a com
munal decision-making pro
cess in common. Regarding
CRK's policy of decision mak
ing, Enieiia Rathbun said,
"We use the Quaker method
of unanimity. We struggle
until we get unanimity.*
Although CRE has a follow
ing of hard-core enthusiasts, it
also has its dissenters —within
and without. An ex-CRE mem
ber touched upon a sense of
moral superiority that she did
not like. She felt that there was
a subtle implication that "It's
people like you and me who can
change the world. . ."
This brown-haired coed spoke
of her interaction with CRE
adults. She felt the adults were
saying, "We're different from
other adults, aren't we? You
can confide in us, can't you?"
When she did not agree with
them, she said they would
accuse her of being hostile.
At the meeting with alumni
in Bishop Auditorium, a white
haired, impeccably dressed man
stood up and told the CRE
group, "You remind me of a
zealous white missionary orga
nization."
Jim King, one of the students
who helped start CRE, said rec
ently there "are three compet
ing philosophies today. There
are those who are for the status
quo, the radicals, and those who
seek social change through edu
cation and action."
He called the status quo
"forces interested in keeping
things the way they are;" ami
radicals: "those who seek vio
lent destruction of the social
institutions;" and character
ized CRE as embodying the
third ideal.
He also contrasted himself to
the radicals: "I know their way
won't work," but added that
"they have a right to their opin
ion, but they're wrong."
CRE works within the struc
ture of institutions, one profes
sor criticizes that "it's support
ive of the institutions that even
tually have to go."
CRE member Bill McElroy,
senior in electrical engineering,
feels "CRE is offering people a
solid basis for interpersonal re
lations. Sometimes I wonder if
we can get going fast enough."
Senior Charles Burbach says,
"Our basic policy is to solve a
lot of the problems out in soci
ety that are not being solved.
People aren't going to change
unless you do it on a person-to
person manner."
Gary Williams, Administra
tive Director for the Continu
ing Education Program at
Stanford Business School and
active in CRE activities, told
a recent alumni gathering
that Stanford has changed in
the last few years from a
sleepy, comfortable campus ta

a concerned, charged-up op
eration.
"Students insist on being in
volved up to their ears .... We
adults have a choice to work
with them, for them or against
them . . . And we have a plan,
and that's why we're here."
Several critics have said it
"smacks" of an Up With People,
Moral Re-armament type of
group. Other including Profes
sor Wilfred Stone criticize th?
organization for trying to work
out current problems without
even having Negroes in the
group.
Others have said the National
Service program and CRE are
"politically naive" and "while
a well-meaning group, it could
be easily taken over by a not-so
well-meaning individual." Critics
draw parallels to the youth
groups in Germany at the time
of Hitler. "That's what can hap
pen when a group is built
around emotion and sentimen
tality," one said.
CRE hopes that by keeping
the organization in private
hands, de-centralized, and aware
of dangerous possibilities, the
critic's fears will not be real
ized.
There has been some rumor
that after a five-week program
of relevance groups, students
must decide whether or not
they wish to belong and sign
something to that effect. The
Daily however can find no
evidence to support this.
There are some lists and
phoning chains to keep inter
ested people informed but
only that.
Several participants claim
however that they have been
made to feel if they can't go
along with th orientation and
goals of the program, they must
leave. "I was told 'you're either
with us or against us' and that
I was 'hostile' if I rejected peo
ple in the group," one ex-partici
pant said.
Another adult, a '56 graduate
of Stanford, homemaker Bea
Herrick, told the same group
meeting in Bishop Auditorium
on April 7, "There are adults in
CRE who really care about
those students. Kids need our
help desperately. They need us,
and we need them."
Bobbie Birleffl, junior com
munications major, said, "CRE
is a community of individuals
committed to moving out to
make this country a whole coun
try."
The people involved in tho
Community feel they have
found in CRE a haven from an
authoritarian, materialistic soci
ety and hope to share this ex
perience with others. Mark Rud
dick, a pre-med junior, told the
alumni "My father would die
for the dollar and youth today
would die for hate of the estab
lishment."
He said that because of the
CRE program he doesn't
hate his father. "There is no
generation gap." He said, "we
have to shake that indiffer
ence, shake that hate."
Probably the greatest attack
on CRE, has been the charge
that it is a religion. "It's Christ
and Christianity and all that,
but they've just left off the gold
tinsel and the magic show," said
one student.
"It's a sect and a hoax,"
claims another.
One members of the Univer
sity staff acquainted with it said
it was specifically designed to
"co-opt dissenters into the insti
tutions of society with as little
change as possible. As middle
class people who are involved,
the adults specially have an in

torest in maintaining the status
quo."
So the Committee for Rele
vant Education, working with a
vast network of organizations
encompassing thousands of peo
ple in the Bay Area alone, is
growing further. The partici
pants are as enthusiastic as the
dissenters are frightened.
