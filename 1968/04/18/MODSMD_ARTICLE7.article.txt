## CRE: Force For Change? 
### PATRICK McMAHON SUSAN SWARD 
Stanford is a lonely place.
"The atmosphere is highly aca
demic, but the emphasis seems
to lie in and competitive
achievement, rather than in a
truly effective sharing of the in
tellectual life among students
and faculty or even among stu
dents themselves," summarized
John D. Black, director of Coun
seling and Testing Service, from
two recent studies.
One of the studies ranked
Stanford students in the top
two per cent nationally in aware
ness — the search for personal,
poetic and political meaning in
life.
The combination of awareness
of social problems and a lonely
atmosphere has led in part to
the Community for Relevant Ed

nearly 1000 adults in the area
and some 200 Stanford students.
CRE has come under fire, how

for more effective personal re
lationships. Specifically by us

techniques in small groups of
students and adults in the lo
cal community, CRE combats

some of the frustrations and
loneliness of Stanford with a
plan of action.
These groups (CRE calls them
relevance groups) are relatively
new efforts for people to become
less defensive and more aware
of their personal feelings
through small groups.
There are several kinds of
relevance groups at Stanford.
The Counseling and Testing
Center carries on "Project En

counter" involving 100 students,
faculty, and staff, which speci
fically helps to counter anxieties
in people. In the Speech and
Drama department, Professor
Helen Schrader has been a prime
mover in what she calls "human
groups," learning groups deal
ing with the human potential.
The Department of Psychiatry
offers its interns an optional "T
