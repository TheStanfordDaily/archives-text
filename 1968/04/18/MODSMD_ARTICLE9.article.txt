## King Killing Suspect Named 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
FBI Wednesday charged Eric
Starvo Gait with Conspiracy in
the murder of Dr. Martin Lu
ther King Jr.
It was the first time that any
conspiracy had been officially
mentioned in connection with
the April 4 assassination of
King in Memphis.
And the FBI issued a photo
graph which it identified as be
ing one of Gait, "also known as
Harvey Lowmyer and John Wil
lard."
The FBI said a warrant '|as
issu d in Birmingham, i'a.,
Wednesday, on the basis of an
FBI complaint which charged
that Gait "and an individua'
whom he a'leged to be his broth
er, entered into a conspiracy"
which began around March 29
at Birmingham and ended about
April 5 to "injure, oppress,
threaten, or intimidate Martin
Luther King Jr."
Gait was charged with con
spiring to violate King's civil
rights.
The FBI statement said that
Gait, on or about March 20,
bought a rifle at Birmingham.
The bureau did not say specifi
cally that this was the rifle that
killed King.
But the statement said, "a
30.06 rifle equipped with a tele
scopic sight was found near a
rooming house on South Main
Street in Memphis immediately
after the fatal shooting of Dr.
King occurred." The rooming
house overlooks the Lorraine
Hotel and Motel where King
was staying.
The bureau warned that "Gait

should be considered armed and
dangerous," and any informa
tion concerning him should be
furnished immediately to the
FBI.
The FBI gave no further iden
tification of the man Gait has
alleged to be his brother, would
not say where it obtained the
photograph, and would not dis
close in what connection Gait
used the Lowmyer a'ias.
• Pence Hopes Sag
TOKYO (AP)—North Viet
nam, its tone scorning to hard
en, rejected Wednesday as in
adequate the sites proposed by
the United States for prelimi
nary talks on the Vietnam war.
A Hanoi broadcast onc p again
claimed that world opinion de
manded the Americans stop
creating "difficulties" in the se
lection of a meeting place. It
coupled this statement with a
reassertion of its hard-line
stand, that if the United States
really wanted peace, it should
immediately halt all air raids
over North Vietnam, withdraw
troops from South Vietnam and
"let the Vietnamese people set
tle their own affairs."
The broadcast coincided with
disclosure in Tokyo that Japan
had informally asked the Soviet
Union to help arrive at an early
decision on selection of a site
for the talks. The request was
made by Foreign Minister Tak
eo Miki at a meeting on another
subject with Soviet Ambassador
Oleg Troyanovsky. The Soviet
envoy was reported replying
noneommittally that the Soviet
Union also was "looking for

ward to early peace" in Viet
nam.
• Rusk Urged To Quit
PITTSBURGH TAP) - — Sen.
Eugene J. McCarthy said
Wednesday night Dean Rusk
should be replaced by a new
secretary of state, to give evi
dence of administration "will
ingness to change its course" in
the Vietnam war.
He said that would be an en
couraging sign that th" White
House is prepared for "a proc
ess of joint conciliation" with
the Communists to end the
fighting.
He said there must be "a bas
ic change of diplomatic ap
proach" in the quest for peace.
"In view of Secretary Rusk's
commitment to our policy from
its outset, an encouraging sign
of the administration's willing
ness to change its course would
be his replacement as secretary
of state. ..."
McCarthy was seeking votes
for Pennsylvania's April 23
presidential primary. In this
one, McCarthy is alone on the
presidential ballot, which will
not bind the state's 130 Demo
cratic convention votes. In ad
dition, a slate of McCarthy
aligned Democrats, perhaps as
many as 80 will be running for
delegate spots.
• Czech Turmoil
PRAGUE (AP) — Czechoslo
vakia's ousted president and
party chief, Antonin Novotny,
was reported Wednesday lead
ing a group of orthodox Commu
nists struggling to retain their

antiliberal influence in the par
ty's Central Committee.
Informants said the orthodox
group had been given an ultima
tum by liberal reform elements
to surrender their holdout posi

where Novotny retains member
ship or face exposure for their
roles in Stalinist terror trials.
Novotny's supporters include
once-powerful men now reduced
to bare committee membership.
But Novotny has a considerable
following among lower echelon
party bureaucrats.
According to the sources, he
threatened at one stage to bring
Soviet pressure on the liberals
unless he is allowed to remain
on the policy making commit

• Khe Sanh Shelled
SAIGON (AP) — North Viet
namese guns, firing from posi
tions still largely immune to
U.S. air power, have zeroed in
again on U.S. Marines at Khe
Sanh, pounding the combat base
with a fury like that of its 77-
day siege, military spokesmen
said Wednesday.
The spokesmen reported 19
Marines attached to Khe Sanh
were killed and 56 wounded,
most in an ambush set for an
American patrol operating about
four miles outside the base. Four

were reported missing.
About 50 miles from Khe
Sanh, in the A Shau Valley, Air
Force 852 Stratofortresses flew
eight missions against a North
