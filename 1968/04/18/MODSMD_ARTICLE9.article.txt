## King Killing Suspect Named 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
FBI Wednesday charged Eric
Starvo Gait with Conspiracy in
the murder of Dr. Martin Lu
ther King Jr.
It was the first time that any
conspiracy had been officially
mentioned in connection with
the April 4 assassination of
King in Memphis.
And the FBI issued a photo
graph which it identified as be
ing one of Gait, "also known as
Harvey Lowmyer and John Wil
lard."
The FBI said a warrant '|as
issu d in Birmingham, i'a.,
Wednesday, on the basis of an
FBI complaint which charged
that Gait "and an individua'
whom he a'leged to be his broth
er, entered into a conspiracy"
which began around March 29
at Birmingham and ended about
April 5 to "injure, oppress,
threaten, or intimidate Martin
Luther King Jr."
Gait was charged with con
spiring to violate King's civil
rights.
The FBI statement said that
Gait, on or about March 20,
bought a rifle at Birmingham.
The bureau did not say specifi
cally that this was the rifle that
killed King.
But the statement said, "a
30.06 rifle equipped with a tele
scopic sight was found near a
rooming house on South Main
Street in Memphis immediately
after the fatal shooting of Dr.
King occurred." The rooming
house overlooks the Lorraine
Hotel and Motel where King
was staying.
The bureau warned that "Gait

should be considered armed and
dangerous," and any informa
tion concerning him should be
furnished immediately to the
FBI.
The FBI gave no further iden
tification of the man Gait has
alleged to be his brother, would
not say where it obtained the
photograph, and would not dis
close in what connection Gait
used the Lowmyer a'ias.
• Pence Hopes Sag
TOKYO (AP)—North Viet
nam, its tone scorning to hard
en, rejected Wednesday as in
adequate the sites proposed by
the United States for prelimi
nary talks on the Vietnam war.
A Hanoi broadcast onc p again
claimed that world opinion de
manded the Americans stop
creating "difficulties" in the se
lection of a meeting place. It
coupled this statement with a
reassertion of its hard-line
stand, that if the United States
really wanted peace, it should
immediately halt all air raids
over North Vietnam, withdraw
troops from South Vietnam and
"let the Vietnamese people set
tle their own affairs."
The broadcast coincided with
disclosure in Tokyo that Japan
had informally asked the Soviet
Union to help arrive at an early
decision on selection of a site
for the talks. The request was
made by Foreign Minister Tak
eo Miki at a meeting on another
subject with Soviet Ambassador
Oleg Troyanovsky. The Soviet
envoy was reported replying
noneommittally that the Soviet
Union also was "looking for

ward to early peace" in Viet
nam.
• Rusk Urged To Quit
PITTSBURGH TAP) - — Sen.
Eugene J. McCarthy said
Wednesday night Dean Rusk
should be replaced by a new
secretary of state, to give evi
dence of administration "will
ingness to change its course" in
the Vietnam war.
He said that would be an en
couraging sign that th" White
House is prepared for "a proc
ess of joint conciliation" with
the Communists to end the
fighting.
He said there must be "a bas
ic change of diplomatic ap
proach" in the quest for peace.
"In view of Secretary Rusk's
commitment to our policy from
its outset, an encouraging sign
of the administration's willing
ness to change its course would
be his replacement as secretary
of state. ..."
McCarthy was seeking votes
for Pennsylvania's April 23
presidential primary. In this
one, McCarthy is alone on the
presidential ballot, which will
not bind the state's 130 Demo
cratic convention votes. In ad
dition, a slate of McCarthy
aligned Democrats, perhaps as
many as 80 will be running for
delegate spots.
• Czech Turmoil
PRAGUE (AP) — Czechoslo
vakia's ousted president and
party chief, Antonin Novotny,
was reported Wednesday lead
ing a group of orthodox Commu
nists struggling to retain their

antiliberal influence in the par
ty's Central Committee.
Informants said the orthodox
group had been given an ultima
tum by liberal reform elements
to surrender their holdout posi
tions on the powerful committee
where Novotny retains member
ship or face exposure for their
roles in Stalinist terror trials.
Novotny's supporters include
once-powerful men now reduced
to bare committee membership.
But Novotny has a considerable
following among lower echelon
party bureaucrats.
According to the sources, he
threatened at one stage to bring
Soviet pressure on the liberals
unless he is allowed to remain
on the policy making commit
tee.
• Khe Sanh Shelled
SAIGON (AP) — North Viet
namese guns, firing from posi
tions still largely immune to
U.S. air power, have zeroed in
again on U.S. Marines at Khe
Sanh, pounding the combat base
with a fury like that of its 77-
day siege, military spokesmen
said Wednesday.
The spokesmen reported 19
Marines attached to Khe Sanh
were killed and 56 wounded,
most in an ambush set for an
American patrol operating about
four miles outside the base. Four
teen Marines from the patrol
were reported missing.
About 50 miles from Khe
Sanh, in the A Shau Valley, Air
Force 852 Stratofortresses flew
eight missions against a North
Vietnamese stronghold within
striking distance of Hue, the old
imperial capital nearly de
stroyed in the Tet offensive.
The air war over North Viet
nam was limited for the 13th
consecutive day to the area
south of the 19th Parallel. Fight
er-bombers concentrated on
targets in the vicinity of Vinh
and Dong Hoi on the east and
the Mu Gia Pass to the west.
In a political development, the
defense committee of South
Vietnam's House of Representa
tives rejected the general mobi
lization bill President Nguyen
Van Thieu sent it last week.
• Prison Riot In N.C.
RALEIGH, N. C. (AP) — A
hail of buckshot fired by guards
into a crowd of more than 400
rioting prisoners Wednesday left
five inmates dead and 75 wound
ed at North Carolina's Central
Prison in Raleigh.
Two prison guards and two

highway patrolmen were hit by
richoeheting shots, and another
guard was struck in the face by
a thrown brick. None of the offi
cers was seriously injured.
The gunfire abruptly ha'ted a
demonstration which began as a
sitdown strike by about 500 pris
oners at the maximum security
prison Tuesday and erupted into
a torch-throwing melee.
State Correction Commission
er V. Lee Bounds said guards
and state troopers re gained con
trol of the prison after skirmish
ing less than 10 minutes after
the gunfire.
• LB] Meets Park
HONOLULU (AP) — Presi
dent Johnson met with South
Korea's President Chung Hee
Park Wednesday for a one-day
summit session on major issues
of war and peace in Asia.
Both the conduct of the Viet
nam war and Johnson's bid for
peace talks with Hanoi were on

the agenda, as well as mount
ing pressure by Communist
North Korea against the South.
The two-man summit session
at a secluded seaside estate cli
maxed a fence-mending process
begun after Communist North
Korean attacks in January set
off a crisis in relations between
Washington and Seoul.
Both the North Korean threat
and Vietnam, where South Ko
rea has nearly 50,000 troops in
the allied cause, rate priority
billing in the parley.
Johnson was reported anxious
to quiet any South Korean
qualms over his bid for direct
U.S. talks with North Vietnam.
Park, like some other Asian
allies, has let it be known that
he is for firmness in dealing
with the Reds and wants South
Korea clued in to any negotia
tions.
• Russ Charge Spying
MOSCOW (AP) — The Soviet
Union charged Wednesday that
five U.S. military attaches and
one from Canada had pushed
too hard at their intelligence
gathering missions and entered
the area of "open espionage" at
a shipyard and a military base
last week.
The U.S. Embassy, in its
strongest assertion here in
years of diplomatic rights, said
the attaches immunity was vio
lated and that the incidents had
been "staged".
"They crossed the border of
curiosity and ended up on the
path of vice," Izvestia said.
The American reply said that
the attaches were engaged in
activities "which are perfectly
normal and accepted on the part
of military attaches the world
over, including military at
taches of the Soviet Union in
the United States."

SACRAMENTO (AP) — Re
publicans and Democrats joined
Wednesday to push Gov. Rea
gan's property tax relief plan
past its first legislative test, but
coupled that with approval of
the income tax withholding plan
he opposes.

cision it made in a closed-doors
meeting, the Assembly Revenue
and Taxation Committee ap
proved the Republican gover
nor's plan to carry out $155 mil
lion in local property tax reduc
tions he and lawmakers prom
ised to pass on this year.
