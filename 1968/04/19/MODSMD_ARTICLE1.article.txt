# ASSU Convention To Meet Saturday
## 
### THOMAS DAWSON 
Siding student fees and a dras
tically reduced legislature have
been proposed by a committee
of the ASSU Constitutional Con
vention. The interim structural
committee will present its re
port at the final session of the
convention tomorrow.
The committee recommends
that the ASSU be allowed to set
its own fees based on the result
of a student referendum every
spring. There would be a mini
mum fee necessary to carry on
the operating costs of the stu
dent government and a maxi
mum of around ten dollars a
quarter.
The committee also proposed
the reduction in size of the legi
slature from the present 150

members to a 29-member student
slate.
The interim structural com*
mlttee will also propose the
following by-law: No state
ment of opinion shall be recog
nized as the position of the
membership of the association
without the approval by a
majority of the members of
the association voting In a
student referendum."
However, the following provi
sion also advanced would serve
to lessen the Impact of the first
proposal:
"The Senate, upon approval
of three-fourths of the mem
bers present and voting, may
adopt resolutions expressing
the opinion of the Senate on
a proposition."
The committee also recom
mended a change in the manner
of appointment of the Student
Financial Manager. At present
the financial manager is chosen
bv the Financial Director of the
University (currently the dean
of students).
In the new proposal the finan
cial manager will be chosen by
a committee consisting of the Fi
nancial Director, the ASSU pres
ident and the outgoing finan
cial manager.
The convention first met two
weekends ago and drew up rec
ommendations on the role of
student government. They then
appointed the interim structural
committee to formulate specific
reforms in the form of the stu
dent government.
The committee's report will
be discussed by the entire con
vention which may amend it.
The committee, while recom
mending a change in the size
of the legislature, has not for
mulated any proposals as to how
the members will be chosen,
whether by class, residence or
other criteria.
The committee did agree,
however, that graduate stu
dents should be represented
according to their schools.
Other moves proposed by the
committee include the creation
of an Educational Commission
which would provide for public
reports by student members of
Presidential and Academic Coun
cil committees.
None of the proposals made
by the Convention are binding
on the legislature. The propo
sals will be presented in the
near future to the legislature
which will vote whether to
place them on next month's
ballot.
The meeting tomorrow will
begin at nine o'clock in the busi
ness school auditorium.

ON A WARM DAY — Now that the sun is out and days are warm,
the Lake Lag dock sometimes gets just too crowded. Go to sea, they
told him.
Siding student fees and a dras
tically reduced legislature have
been proposed by a committee
of the ASSU Constitutional Con
vention. The interim structural
committee will present its re
port at the final session of the
convention tomorrow.
The committee recommends
that the ASSU be allowed to set
its own fees based on the result
of a student referendum every
spring. There would be a mini
mum fee necessary to carry on
the operating costs of the stu
dent government and a maxi
mum of around ten dollars a
quarter.
The committee also proposed
the reduction in size of the legi
slature from the present 150

members to a 29-member student
slate.
The interim structural com*
mlttee will also propose the
following by-law: No state
ment of opinion shall be recog
nized as the position of the
membership of the association
without the approval by a
majority of the members of
the association voting In a
student referendum."
However, the following provi
sion also advanced would serve
to lessen the Impact of the first
proposal:
"The Senate, upon approval
of three-fourths of the mem
bers present and voting, may
adopt resolutions expressing
the opinion of the Senate on
a proposition."
The committee also recom
mended a change in the manner
of appointment of the Student
Financial Manager. At present
the financial manager is chosen
bv the Financial Director of the
University (currently the dean
of students).
In the new proposal the finan
cial manager will be chosen by
a committee consisting of the Fi
nancial Director, the ASSU pres
ident and the outgoing finan
cial manager.
The convention first met two
weekends ago and drew up rec
ommendations on the role of
student government. They then
appointed the interim structural
committee to formulate specific
reforms in the form of the stu
dent government.
The committee's report will
be discussed by the entire con
vention which may amend it.
The committee, while recom
mending a change in the size
of the legislature, has not for
mulated any proposals as to how
the members will be chosen,
whether by class, residence or
other criteria.
The committee did agree,
however, that graduate stu
dents should be represented
according to their schools.
Other moves proposed by the
committee include the creation
of an Educational Commission
which would provide for public
reports by student members of
Presidential and Academic Coun
cil committees.
