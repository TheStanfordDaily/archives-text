# The 						Washington Merry-Go-Round
## Walt Rostow Blocked Warsaw Talks 
### Drew Pearson 
WASHINGTON — The admin
istration's turndown of Warsaw
as a negotiating place after
President Johnson had repeated
ly stated he would go anywhere
at anytime to talk peace can be
attributed in large part to
LBJ's foreign affairs advisor,
Walt Rostow.
Dr. Rostow is a personable,
highly intelligent professor from
Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology, who acted as one of
John F. Kennedy's early brain
trusters, later became one of
Kennedy's top foreign affairs
advisers. He is now completely
at odds with brother Bobby
Kennedy regarding the war in
Vietnam but has been able to
make his ideas on Southeast
Asia stick with Lyndon John
son.
The veto of Warsaw as a
meeting place caused a sour re
action in the diplomatic corps,
due to the fact that the United
States has been meeting with
the Communist Chinese in that
city for many years. One reason
the North Vietnamese picked
Warsaw was so they could tell
the Chinese —who don't want
them to talk at all—that, since
the Chinese had been talking in
Warsaw, they couldn't object to
the North Vietnamese talking
there.
In addition, the Poles have
been cooperative in supporting
the United States regarding
peace talks. They are now go
ing through student sit-ins and
internal problems somewhat
similar to those of Czechoslo
vakia; so the atmosphere for
East-West peace talks should
not be unfriendly.
Despite this, the United
States, on the advice of Dr. Ros
tow, reneged on the President's
repeated pledge to go anywhere
at any time to talk peace.
Rostow's Problems
Around the State Department
it's said that Walt Rostow suf
fers from two things: First, he

has been trying to live down the
fact that his father was a so
cialist; second, Walt Rostow
was the man who originally
recommended to President Ken
nedy that he send large scale
troops into Vietnam. Ever since,
Rostow has been trying to prove
this policy was no mistake.
It was only natural, therefore,
that Rostow was not enthusia
astic about the President's olive
branch to North Vietnam. Hence
his negative advice on Warsaw.
Rostow was born in 1915 just
as Eugene Debs, Socialist can
didate for President, was jailed
by the Wilson administration.
Walt's father, an admirer of
Debs, named one son Eugene
Debs Rostow and the other son
for the socialist poet of Civil
War days, Walt Whitman.
Walt Rostow has had a bril
liant scholastic career, but is
also regarded as something of
a bumbler.
He was a Rhodes scholar,
took a doctor's degree at Yale,
taught American history at both
Oxford and Cambridge, and
economic history at MIT.
He also was an OSS agent
aboard the British tanker Em
pire Mersey when it was sunk
by a German submarine in
1942. Rostow managed to save
his life but not his luggage,
though later Rep. Ellsworth B.
Foote, R., Conn., introduced a
bill whereby Congress voted
him $585.50 for his lost suit
cases.
His most serious loss, how
ever, was when he left behind
a confidential memo during con
ferences between President Ken
nedy and Prime Minister Dief
enbaker of Canada. On the
memo Kennedy had written the
initials SOB, referring to Dief
enbaker. Diefenbaker didn't take
kindly to this and the incident
strained Canadian-US diplomat
ic relations.
It also strained President
Kennedy's patience regarding

his special assistant for nation
al security affairs. Kennedy had
suffered a serious setback in
Vienna during his talks with
Premier Khrushchev when Ros
tow advised him to be tough.
Khrushchev, however, was in a
much better position to be
tough. Kennedy returned to the
United States so distraught that
his old back ailment returned.
Out of that meeting came the
Berlin Wall, the calling out of
American reserves and the low
est ebb in American-Soviet rela
tions.
It was on the heels of this
diplomatic defeat that President
Kennedy sent Rostow and Gen.
Maxwell Taylor to Southeast
Asia. They came back with a
recommendation that American
troop strength in South Viet
nam be increased from 1,000
men, where Eisenhower had
kept it, to 18,000 men. Kennedy,
smarting from his failure in
Vienna and the Bay of Pigs fi
asco and needing to recoup his
prestige, bought the idea.
This is how the United States
first got seriously involved in
South Vietnam.
It was only three months af
ter accepting Rostow's advice on
this major step that Kennedy
demoted the man who had given
it to him. Rostow was trans
ferred from the White House,
where he was at the President's
elbow, to the policy planning
council of the State Depart
ment.
No one who knows Rostow
questions his integrity. But
they do question his judgment.
They feel that it has been in
fluenced by his triple failure to
receive a security clearance dur
ing the Eisenhower administra
tion. This was the beginning of
the famous Otepka case, Otepka
having objected when Bobby
Kennedy demanded special
clearance for Rostow.
A great deal of controversy
has resolved around this case

and Otepka's subsequent re
moval of State Department files.
The controversy has caused
President Johnson, always loyal
to his friends, to champion Ros
tow. It has also tended to make
Rostow the toughest anti-com
munist adviser around the
White House. He wants to prove
Otepka wrong.
Korea Attack Feared
WASHINGTON — The main
reason for President Johnson's
meeting with President Chung
Hee Park of South Korea is be
cause Park expects the North
Koreans to break the 15-year
truce in Korea. Either the Ko
rean communists will plunge
again across the 38th parallel,
Park is warning President John
son, or they will flood the south
with infiltrators.
The bantam South Korean
leader also believes fiercely that
American softness toward North
Korea will merely encourage the
reds to renew the Korean war.
The United States has taken
pains to prevent the eruption of
a second front in Korea while
American troops are fighting in
Vietnam. But Park thinks this
restraint will be interpreted as
weakness and, more likely, will
embolden the North Koreans.
These were President Park's
views when I talked with him
in Seoul a few weeks before his
meeting with President John
son. The tough, taciturn Park
wanted to pursue an eye-for-an
eye policy — "prudent retalia
tion," he suggested—a gainst
North Korea's hottempered Dic
tator Kim II Sung. But the
American authorities persuaded
him to hold his fire and his
fury.
The seizure of the spy ship
Pueblo and the attempt to as
sassinate Park, which made
headlines in January, merely
climaxed a succession of harass
ments. They came on top of 400
incidents along the demilitarized
zone last year.

him $585.50 for his lost suit
cases.
His most serious loss, how
ever, was when he left behind
a confidential memo during con
ferences between President Ken
nedy and Prime Minister Dief
enbaker of Canada. On the
memo Kennedy had written the
initials SOB, referring to Dief
enbaker. Diefenbaker didn't take
kindly to this and the incident
strained Canadian-US diplomat
ic relations.
It also strained President
Kennedy's patience regarding

his special assistant for nation
al security affairs. Kennedy had
suffered a serious setback in
Vienna during his talks with
Premier Khrushchev when Ros
tow advised him to be tough.
Khrushchev, however, was in a
much better position to be
tough. Kennedy returned to the
United States so distraught that
his old back ailment returned.
Out of that meeting came the
Berlin Wall, the calling out of
American reserves and the low
est ebb in American-Soviet rela
tions.
It was on the heels of this
diplomatic defeat that President
Kennedy sent Rostow and Gen.
Maxwell Taylor to Southeast
Asia. They came back with a
recommendation that American
troop strength in South Viet
nam be increased from 1,000
men, where Eisenhower had
kept it, to 18,000 men. Kennedy,
smarting from his failure in
Vienna and the Bay of Pigs fi
asco and needing to recoup his
prestige, bought the idea.
This is how the United States
first got seriously involved in
South Vietnam.
It was only three months af
ter accepting Rostow's advice on
this major step that Kennedy
demoted the man who had given
it to him. Rostow was trans
ferred from the White House,
where he was at the President's
elbow, to the policy planning
council of the State Depart
ment.
No one who knows Rostow
questions his integrity. But
they do question his judgment.
They feel that it has been in
fluenced by his triple failure to
receive a security clearance dur
ing the Eisenhower administra
tion. This was the beginning of
the famous Otepka case, Otepka
having objected when Bobby
Kennedy demanded special
clearance for Rostow.
A great deal of controversy
has resolved around this case

and Otepka's subsequent re
moval of State Department files.
The controversy has caused
President Johnson, always loyal
to his friends, to champion Ros
tow. It has also tended to make
Rostow the toughest anti-com
munist adviser around the
White House. He wants to prove
Otepka wrong.
Korea Attack Feared
WASHINGTON — The main
reason for President Johnson's
meeting with President Chung
Hee Park of South Korea is be
cause Park expects the North
Koreans to break the 15-year
truce in Korea. Either the Ko
rean communists will plunge
again across the 38th parallel,
Park is warning President John
son, or they will flood the south
with infiltrators.
The bantam South Korean
leader also believes fiercely that
American softness toward North
Korea will merely encourage the
reds to renew the Korean war.
The United States has taken
pains to prevent the eruption of
a second front in Korea while
American troops are fighting in
Vietnam. But Park thinks this
restraint will be interpreted as
weakness and, more likely, will
embolden the North Koreans.
These were President Park's
views when I talked with him
in Seoul a few weeks before his
meeting with President John
son. The tough, taciturn Park
wanted to pursue an eye-for-an
eye policy — "prudent retalia
tion," he suggested—a gainst
North Korea's hottempered Dic
tator Kim II Sung. But the
American authorities persuaded
him to hold his fire and his
fury.
The seizure of the spy ship
Pueblo and the attempt to as
sassinate Park, which made
headlines in January, merely
climaxed a succession of harass
ments. They came on top of 400
incidents along the demilitarized
zone last year.
WASHINGTON — The admin
istration's turndown of Warsaw
as a negotiating place after
President Johnson had repeated
ly stated he would go anywhere
at anytime to talk peace can be
attributed in large part to
LBJ's foreign affairs advisor,
Walt Rostow.
Dr. Rostow is a personable,
highly intelligent professor from
Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology, who acted as one of
John F. Kennedy's early brain
trusters, later became one of
Kennedy's top foreign affairs
advisers. He is now completely
at odds with brother Bobby
Kennedy regarding the war in
Vietnam but has been able to
make his ideas on Southeast
Asia stick with Lyndon John
son.
The veto of Warsaw as a
meeting place caused a sour re
action in the diplomatic corps,
due to the fact that the United
States has been meeting with
the Communist Chinese in that
city for many years. One reason
the North Vietnamese picked
Warsaw was so they could tell
the Chinese —who don't want
them to talk at all—that, since
the Chinese had been talking in
Warsaw, they couldn't object to
the North Vietnamese talking
there.
In addition, the Poles have
been cooperative in supporting
the United States regarding
peace talks. They are now go
ing through student sit-ins and
internal problems somewhat
similar to those of Czechoslo
vakia; so the atmosphere for
East-West peace talks should
not be unfriendly.
Despite this, the United
States, on the advice of Dr. Ros
tow, reneged on the President's
repeated pledge to go anywhere
at any time to talk peace.
Rostow's Problems
Around the State Department
it's said that Walt Rostow suf
fers from two things: First, he

has been trying to live down the
fact that his father was a so
cialist; second, Walt Rostow
was the man who originally
recommended to President Ken
nedy that he send large scale
troops into Vietnam. Ever since,
Rostow has been trying to prove
this policy was no mistake.
It was only natural, therefore,
that Rostow was not enthusia
astic about the President's olive
branch to North Vietnam. Hence
his negative advice on Warsaw.
Rostow was born in 1915 just
as Eugene Debs, Socialist can
didate for President, was jailed
by the Wilson administration.
Walt's father, an admirer of
Debs, named one son Eugene
Debs Rostow and the other son
for the socialist poet of Civil
War days, Walt Whitman.
Walt Rostow has had a bril
liant scholastic career, but is
also regarded as something of
a bumbler.
He was a Rhodes scholar,
took a doctor's degree at Yale,
taught American history at both
Oxford and Cambridge, and
economic history at MIT.
He also was an OSS agent
aboard the British tanker Em
pire Mersey when it was sunk
by a German submarine in
1942. Rostow managed to save
his life but not his luggage,
though later Rep. Ellsworth B.
Foote, R., Conn., introduced a
bill whereby Congress voted
him $585.50 for his lost suit
cases.
His most serious loss, how

a second front in Korea while
American troops are fighting in
Vietnam. But Park thinks this
restraint will be interpreted as
weakness and, more likely, will
embolden the North Koreans.
These were President Park's
views when I talked with him
in Seoul a few weeks before his
meeting with President John
son. The tough, taciturn Park
wanted to pursue an eye-for-an
eye policy — "prudent retalia
tion," he suggested—a gainst
North Korea's hottempered Dic
tator Kim II Sung. But the
American authorities persuaded
him to hold his fire and his
fury.
The seizure of the spy ship
Pueblo and the attempt to as
sassinate Park, which made
headlines in January, merely
climaxed a succession of harass
ments. They came on top of 400
incidents along the demilitarized
zone last year.
WASHINGTON — The admin
istration's turndown of Warsaw
as a negotiating place after
President Johnson had repeated
ly stated he would go anywhere
at anytime to talk peace can be
attributed in large part to
LBJ's foreign affairs advisor,
Walt Rostow.
Dr. Rostow is a personable,
highly intelligent professor from
Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology, who acted as one of
John F. Kennedy's early brain
trusters, later became one of
Kennedy's top foreign affairs
advisers. He is now completely
at odds with brother Bobby
Kennedy regarding the war in
Vietnam but has been able to
make his ideas on Southeast
Asia stick with Lyndon John
son.
The veto of Warsaw as a
meeting place caused a sour re
action in the diplomatic corps,
due to the fact that the United
States has been meeting with
the Communist Chinese in that
city for many years. One reason
the North Vietnamese picked
Warsaw was so they could tell
the Chinese —who don't want
them to talk at all—that, since
the Chinese had been talking in
Warsaw, they couldn't object to
the North Vietnamese talking
there.
In addition, the Poles have
been cooperative in supporting
the United States regarding
peace talks. They are now go
ing through student sit-ins and
internal problems somewhat
similar to those of Czechoslo
vakia; so the atmosphere for
East-West peace talks should
not be unfriendly.
Despite this, the United
States, on the advice of Dr. Ros
tow, reneged on the President's
repeated pledge to go anywhere
at any time to talk peace.
Rostow's Problems
Around the State Department
it's said that Walt Rostow suf
fers from two things: First, he

has been trying to live down the
fact that his father was a so
cialist; second, Walt Rostow
was the man who originally
recommended to President Ken
nedy that he send large scale
troops into Vietnam. Ever since,
Rostow has been trying to prove
this policy was no mistake.
It was only natural, therefore,
that Rostow was not enthusia
astic about the President's olive
branch to North Vietnam. Hence
his negative advice on Warsaw.
Rostow was born in 1915 just
as Eugene Debs, Socialist can
didate for President, was jailed
by the Wilson administration.
Walt's father, an admirer of
Debs, named one son Eugene
Debs Rostow and the other son
for the socialist poet of Civil
War days, Walt Whitman.
Walt Rostow has had a bril
liant scholastic career, but is
also regarded as something of
a bumbler.
He was a Rhodes scholar,
took a doctor's degree at Yale,
taught American history at both
Oxford and Cambridge, and
economic history at MIT.
He also was an OSS agent
aboard the British tanker Em
pire Mersey when it was sunk
by a German submarine in
1942. Rostow managed to save
his life but not his luggage,
though later Rep. Ellsworth B.
Foote, R., Conn., introduced a
bill whereby Congress voted
him $585.50 for his lost suit
cases.
His most serious loss, how
ever, was when he left behind
a confidential memo during con
ferences between President Ken
nedy and Prime Minister Dief
enbaker of Canada. On the
memo Kennedy had written the
initials SOB, referring to Dief
enbaker. Diefenbaker didn't take
kindly to this and the incident
strained Canadian-US diplomat
ic relations.
It also strained President
Kennedy's patience regarding

his special assistant for nation
al security affairs. Kennedy had
suffered a serious setback in
Vienna during his talks with
Premier Khrushchev when Ros
tow advised him to be tough.
Khrushchev, however, was in a
much better position to be
tough. Kennedy returned to the
United States so distraught that
his old back ailment returned.
Out of that meeting came the
Berlin Wall, the calling out of
American reserves and the low
est ebb in American-Soviet rela
tions.
It was on the heels of this
diplomatic defeat that President
Kennedy sent Rostow and Gen.
Maxwell Taylor to Southeast
Asia. They came back with a
recommendation that American
troop strength in South Viet
nam be increased from 1,000
men, where Eisenhower had
kept it, to 18,000 men. Kennedy,
smarting from his failure in
Vienna and the Bay of Pigs fi
asco and needing to recoup his
prestige, bought the idea.
This is how the United States
first got seriously involved in
South Vietnam.
It was only three months af
ter accepting Rostow's advice on
this major step that Kennedy
demoted the man who had given
it to him. Rostow was trans
ferred from the White House,
where he was at the President's
elbow, to the policy planning
council of the State Depart
ment.
No one who knows Rostow
questions his integrity. But
they do question his judgment.
They feel that it has been in
fluenced by his triple failure to
receive a security clearance dur
ing the Eisenhower administra
tion. This was the beginning of
the famous Otepka case, Otepka
having objected when Bobby
Kennedy demanded special
clearance for Rostow.
A great deal of controversy
has resolved around this case

and Otepka's subsequent re
moval of State Department files.
The controversy has caused
President Johnson, always loyal
to his friends, to champion Ros
tow. It has also tended to make
Rostow the toughest anti-com
munist adviser around the
White House. He wants to prove
Otepka wrong.
Korea Attack Feared
WASHINGTON — The main
reason for President Johnson's
meeting with President Chung
Hee Park of South Korea is be
cause Park expects the North
Koreans to break the 15-year
truce in Korea. Either the Ko
rean communists will plunge
again across the 38th parallel,
Park is warning President John
son, or they will flood the south
with infiltrators.
The bantam South Korean
leader also believes fiercely that
American softness toward North
Korea will merely encourage the
reds to renew the Korean war.
The United States has taken
pains to prevent the eruption of
a second front in Korea while
American troops are fighting in
Vietnam. But Park thinks this
restraint will be interpreted as
weakness and, more likely, will

by the Wilson administration.
Walt's father, an admirer of
Debs, named one son Eugene
Debs Rostow and the other son
for the socialist poet of Civil
War days, Walt Whitman.
Walt Rostow has had a bril
liant scholastic career, but is
also regarded as something of
a bumbler.
He was a Rhodes scholar,
took a doctor's degree at Yale,
taught American history at both
Oxford and Cambridge, and
economic history at MIT.
He also was an OSS agent
aboard the British tanker Em
pire Mersey when it was sunk
by a German submarine in
1942. Rostow managed to save
his life but not his luggage,
though later Rep. Ellsworth B.
Foote, R., Conn., introduced a
bill whereby Congress voted
him $585.50 for his lost suit
cases.
His most serious loss, how
ever, was when he left behind
a confidential memo during con
ferences between President Ken
nedy and Prime Minister Dief
enbaker of Canada. On the
memo Kennedy had written the
initials SOB, referring to Dief
enbaker. Diefenbaker didn't take
kindly to this and the incident
strained Canadian-US diplomat
ic relations.
It also strained President
Kennedy's patience regarding

his special assistant for nation
al security affairs. Kennedy had
suffered a serious setback in
Vienna during his talks with
Premier Khrushchev when Ros
tow advised him to be tough.
Khrushchev, however, was in a
much better position to be
tough. Kennedy returned to the
United States so distraught that
his old back ailment returned.
Out of that meeting came the
Berlin Wall, the calling out of
American reserves and the low
est ebb in American-Soviet rela
tions.
It was on the heels of this
diplomatic defeat that President
Kennedy sent Rostow and Gen.
Maxwell Taylor to Southeast
Asia. They came back with a
recommendation that American
troop strength in South Viet
nam be increased from 1,000
men, where Eisenhower had
kept it, to 18,000 men. Kennedy,
smarting from his failure in
Vienna and the Bay of Pigs fi
asco and needing to recoup his
prestige, bought the idea.
This is how the United States
first got seriously involved in
South Vietnam.
It was only three months af
ter accepting Rostow's advice on
this major step that Kennedy
demoted the man who had given
it to him. Rostow was trans
ferred from the White House,
where he was at the President's
elbow, to the policy planning
council of the State Depart
ment.
No one who knows Rostow
questions his integrity. But
they do question his judgment.
They feel that it has been in
fluenced by his triple failure to
receive a security clearance dur
ing the Eisenhower administra
tion. This was the beginning of
the famous Otepka case, Otepka
having objected when Bobby
Kennedy demanded special
clearance for Rostow.
A great deal of controversy
has resolved around this case

and Otepka's subsequent re
moval of State Department files.
The controversy has caused
President Johnson, always loyal
to his friends, to champion Ros
tow. It has also tended to make
Rostow the toughest anti-com
munist adviser around the
White House. He wants to prove
Otepka wrong.
Korea Attack Feared
WASHINGTON — The main
reason for President Johnson's
meeting with President Chung
Hee Park of South Korea is be
cause Park expects the North
Koreans to break the 15-year
truce in Korea. Either the Ko
rean communists will plunge
again across the 38th parallel,
Park is warning President John
son, or they will flood the south
with infiltrators.
The bantam South Korean
leader also believes fiercely that
American softness toward North
Korea will merely encourage the
reds to renew the Korean war.
The United States has taken
pains to prevent the eruption of
a second front in Korea while
American troops are fighting in
Vietnam. But Park thinks this
restraint will be interpreted as
weakness and, more likely, will
embolden the North Koreans.
These were President Park's
views when I talked with him
in Seoul a few weeks before his
meeting with President John
son. The tough, taciturn Park
wanted to pursue an eye-for-an
eye policy — "prudent retalia
tion," he suggested—a gainst
North Korea's hottempered Dic
tator Kim II Sung. But the
American authorities persuaded
him to hold his fire and his
fury.
The seizure of the spy ship
Pueblo and the attempt to as
sassinate Park, which made
headlines in January, merely
climaxed a succession of harass
ments. They came on top of 400
incidents along the demilitarized
zone last year.
WASHINGTON — The admin
istration's turndown of Warsaw
as a negotiating place after
President Johnson had repeated
ly stated he would go anywhere
at anytime to talk peace can be
attributed in large part to
LBJ's foreign affairs advisor,
Walt Rostow.
Dr. Rostow is a personable,
highly intelligent professor from
Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology, who acted as one of
John F. Kennedy's early brain
trusters, later became one of
Kennedy's top foreign affairs
advisers. He is now completely
at odds with brother Bobby
Kennedy regarding the war in
Vietnam but has been able to
make his ideas on Southeast
Asia stick with Lyndon John
son.
The veto of Warsaw as a
meeting place caused a sour re
action in the diplomatic corps,
due to the fact that the United
States has been meeting with
the Communist Chinese in that
city for many years. One reason
the North Vietnamese picked
Warsaw was so they could tell
the Chinese —who don't want
them to talk at all—that, since
the Chinese had been talking in
Warsaw, they couldn't object to
the North Vietnamese talking
there.
In addition, the Poles have
been cooperative in supporting
the United States regarding
peace talks. They are now go
ing through student sit-ins and
internal problems somewhat
similar to those of Czechoslo
vakia; so the atmosphere for
East-West peace talks should
not be unfriendly.
Despite this, the United
States, on the advice of Dr. Ros
tow, reneged on the President's
repeated pledge to go anywhere
at any time to talk peace.
Rostow's Problems
Around the State Department
it's said that Walt Rostow suf
fers from two things: First, he

has been trying to live down the
fact that his father was a so
cialist; second, Walt Rostow
was the man who originally
recommended to President Ken
nedy that he send large scale
troops into Vietnam. Ever since,
Rostow has been trying to prove
this policy was no mistake.
It was only natural, therefore,
that Rostow was not enthusia
astic about the President's olive
branch to North Vietnam. Hence
his negative advice on Warsaw.
Rostow was born in 1915 just
as Eugene Debs, Socialist can
didate for President, was jailed
by the Wilson administration.
Walt's father, an admirer of
Debs, named one son Eugene
Debs Rostow and the other son
for the socialist poet of Civil
