## Prof. Kennedy Offers Another Version Of BSU Negotiations With University 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
The difficulty with Michael
Sweeney's "Analysis" (April 17)
of the dialog between the BSU
and various University represen
tatives is one that is common to
many treatments of very recent
history. The analyst wishes to
establish an authoritative per
spective on events; in order to
do so, he presents a good deal
of speculation in the guise of
"inside" information. I cannot
fault Sweeney's chronology, or
most of his facts. As a partici
pant in some of the discussions,
however, I can offer some rather
different views on the motiva
tions he attributes to those who
are lumped under the category
of "Administration."
First, I think it is unfortunate
to imply that the University re
sponded out of fear to the BSU
proposals. A great many people
at Stanford, as in other places,
have been aroused at a dramat
ically accelerating pace to the
plight of minority groups in
American society. The intensifi
cation provided—directly and in
directly—by Dr. King's murder
has served to awaken some of
the heaviest sleepers. One can
accept being told that he stayed
in bed too long, but it is a bit
much to be accused of waking
up only because someone has
threatened to burn the house
down. This suggestion is not
alone unfair to the Administra
tion's participants in the dialog;
it equally misrepresents the
BSU's position. Ken Washing
ton's unreferenced statement to
a white questioner that "events
often determine things like this"

is presented in the clear context
of a vague threat. Washington
and his colleagues have in fact
pointed out repeatedly that they
were not threatening anybody
with anything.
Overemphasized Hardness
In the same vein, Sweeney's
description of our Tuesday night
meeting at Tresidder overem
phasized the hardness of the
University's position and sensa
tionalizes the aura of conflict. It
seemed important to give a
frank and realistic progress re
port on the previous 24 hours,
and to do so from all of the
concerned sectors of the ad
ministration and faculty.
Stanford is not monolithic; for
it to do something, many dif
ferent kinds of people have to be
mobilized, and a day isn't very
long to do it in. The five indi
viduals representing the Uni
versity were there in a variety
of capacities, all because they
wanted to be; they had no
agreed-upon 'group view'. They
hoped to present an account that
satisfied most of the points
raised by the BSU, but felt that
policy decisions involving the
specific language of their docu
ment had to be made in a dif
ferent setting.
Temporary Impasse
Unfortunately, things came to
a temporary impasse when a

polnt-by-point discussion of the
BSU proposal was offered as a
format. As Professor Brown
said at a later and happier junc
ture, it was Washington's quick
insight in calling a recess at that
critical moment that enabled
things to go on: our group
agreed that the sequence of
their proposals constituted an
appropriate way to organize a
general response on our part,
and theirs concurred that the
response could be general.
I will admit that our position
just before the intermission
hardly met with enthusiasm
from the audience; they thought
it was uncompromising and
stuffy, and showed their reaction
with gusto. In describing that
situation, however, Sweeney
gets a little carried away. Vice-
Provost Herbert Packer is de
scribed as being "interrupted in
mid-sentence by Washington";
but at that point helpful com
ments were coming so fast from
the spectators that no one could
(possibly tell who interrupted
whom.
Walkout Probable?
In the next sentence, Sweeney
has Packer contemplating
"walking out with his delega
tion." There are two things
wrong with that speculation:
first, I don't know what he was
contemplating, and I doubt
Sweeney does; second, the rest
of us didn't consider ourselves
a "delegation" and at least one
of us wouldn't have walked out
even if Packer had. The most
interesting feature of the
Sweeney version is that it re
veals a common perception of
authority in the University as
flowing by gravity down estab
lished channels. Instead, de
cisions are much more often
made by consultation. By pro
viding the opportunity for it,
Washington saved the evening.
Sweeney's descriptions of the
possible consequences of a walk
out are even more richly inter
pretive. The audi'nee is de
scribed as "closer to civil dis
obedience than at any other time
last week," and it is aUeged that
the "crowd could even have
forcibly prevented Packer and
the others from leaving." I must
admit that I was worried—but it
was worry about the possibility
of abiding alienation and dis
trrst, not about physical vio
lence. Against Sweeney's testi
mony, I offer that of my wife.
Wives are notably sensitive to
the prospect of harm where
their husband are concerned;
yet mine, who was present
throughout the proceedings,
found no reason to worry about
my safety. In this passage
Sweeney has perpetrated a bit
of melodramatic nonsense.
I cannot comment as directly
on the rest of the piece, because
I had a more remote involve
ment with the subsequent
events. If it is as seriously mis
representative of intent and mo
tivation as is the first part, then
Sweeney has done badly by a
great many people. He has
treated genuine—if belated—
concern as cynicism. He has
dealt with a creative—if some
times tense — dialog in terms of
political expediency. Worst of
all, he has wrongly embellished
the determined and sincere—if
sometimes strident—demands of
black students with the threat
of violent action.

Sweeney Article Shows
Racism In Reporting
Editor, The Daily:
Michael Sweeney's article in
Wednesday's Daily is a textbook
example of unsubtle racism in
reporting. It is opinion in tho
guise of fact. To cite one ex
ample among many, the "ex
plosive" situation on Tresidder
deck existed only in Mr.
Sweeney's imagination. Wash
ington's comment at the time
was: "These are students. They
don't bite. They have minds."

And was there really a riot in
East Palo Alto?
Blacks and whites at Stan
ford have taken a courageous
and long overdue step toward
making this institution respon
sible to the society around it.
White bigots in the faceless
euphemistic backlash, will re
spond as they always do. Oth
ers, with more open minds,
might be spared Mr. Sweeney's
tampering with the truth.

Business Should Pay
Our Black Aid Costs
Editor, The Daily:
My first reaction to the Dally
staffers' pledge (to contribute
to the King fund, April 17) was
that it must be a parody of last
week's pledge by some faculty
and administrators who offered
to donate eight-tenths of one
percent of their annual salaries
to support black students. If
I were to make such a pledge,
(which I will not), my contribu
tion would be $17.80. Very big
deal. The Daily staffers' pledge
is less, of course, and I have
been told that they are quite
serious.
But the real point of this Is
that these pledges ought not
even to be thought necessary.
If the University really wants
money for something, it gets it.
If it can build a new basketball
pavilion, it can support black
students. But if it is interested
in playing percentage games, I
have a suggestion. Let every
corporation in the Stanford In
dustrial Park and every corpor
ation presided over by Stanford
trustees donate ten percent of
one month's war profits.
And while the University is
collecting the money, we can
think of creative ways to use
all that is left over after the
black students' program is paid
for.

Bearded Ones, Here's
A Cause To Fight For
Editor, The Daily:
Four years, $12,000, and my
emotional virginity were pre
cious little to pay for reading
the Daily of April 17; it was the
only decent bargain I ever
made. I robbed both those who
gave and spent my scholarships
for four years.
Mike Barnes' paintings
shamed the BSU and SDS, the
pot-heads, drop-outs and over
dose victims who have tried for
years to coax the Ugly Schtan
ford from its lair and into its
rightful place under the collec
tive knuckles of all war-faring
Christians. Mike's paintings and
their fate showed what any
voice which truly frames the
perception of its speaker can
expect at Stanford: condemna
tion, supression and emascula
tion.
Polite outrage (like Tim
Haight's masturbative prose, or
carefully worded statements
from Tresidder radicals are
one thing; honesty of expres
sion is another. Stanford
thrives on the first and fears
the second. Where, pray tell, is
Charlie Beye?
If you'd really like a cause to
endorse that beard of yours,
friend, here it is. Because no
white man or black man, no rich
man or poor man got screwed
when they took Mike's paint
ings out of the Old Union; that
was the voice of anyone trying
to sing the songs God gives
them to sing, from Poll Sci to
the dunes of EE.
Ite Missa est, you Adminis
trative dogs. May your graves
be uneasy ones.
