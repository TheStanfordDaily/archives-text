## CRE Has 'Patronizing' Approach 
### Prof. Wilfred Stone 
On the Sunday following the death of
Martin Luther King I attended a pilot
meeting of a new Stanford organization,
the Community for Relevant Education,
which met at Bishop Auditorium in the
Business School. It was not easy at first
do, for the early speakers were long
to make out what CRE was trying to
on pious generalities and short on spe
cifics.
"This movement is not against any
thing," said one speaker without saying
what it was for. Another commented
that CRE was "committed to move out
to make this country a whole country."
Yet another, in speaking of draft-card
burners, remarked: 'They're trying to
tell us and we aren't listening"—without
revealing what they were trying to tell
us and without revealing whether the
speaker (or the organization) agreed
with the draft-card burners. Finally, as
the last people on the panel spoke, things
got a little clearer. CRE is associated
with and helped found the National
Service Foundation. It was to be a kind
of VISTA program—but to be financed
from private sources, from foundations,
corporations and individual gifts. Ap
parently the National Service secretariat
has been in existence for over a year,
and has had its objectives more or less

cleared with General Hershey in Selec
tive Service and with certain senators
and congressmen. And apparently a lot
of money is already in.
All the speakers at that meeting were
Stanford students, faculty, or alumni,
and, so it seemed, were all the people
in the audience. It was very much a
gathering of a self-styled "Stanford
Family," and in the weeks and months
to come it is bound to enlist a great deal
of energy and enthusiasm from Stanford
people.
Here, only a day or two after the mur
der of Martin Luther King, is a new
organization coming into being that has
as part of its program an invasion of
the ghettos and a healing of the divisions
(among other things) between Black and
White in this country. Yet not a single
Black man was on that platform and,
so far as I could gather, not a single
Black man is on the Board of the Na
tional Service Foundation. Here is white
middle-class America, troubled and well
intentioned and full of generous motives,
but engaging in a missionary enterprise
that reveals a pathetic lack of under
standing of the race question in the
United States. Doesn't the CRE yet know
that the day is long past when Blacks
are going to welcome Whites in the ghet

toes with programs the Blacks had no
hand in devising? They do not want to
be patronized, studied, and helped, they
want a share in running things, they
want justice and economic equality.
The Community for Relevant Educa
tion and the National Service Founda
tion will no doubt do some good—just as
the Junior League and the Kiwanis
Clubs do some good. But that sort of
patronizing do-gooding is pathetically
anachronistic today, and it is pathetic
that CRE and NSF do not seem to real
ize it. It is especially pathetic that all
this energy and intelligence seems about
to be expended on an exercise in essen
tial futility, when it is so desperately
needed in other areas.
I am writing this to ask the people
engaged in these enterprises to recon
sider their whole organization and strat
egy. They should start all over again,
and start by seeing to it that at least
half of the Board of the National Service
Foundation is made up of Blacks. Then
one could believe that some good, some
real good, would come of it—for only
by welcoming Blacks into the structures
of our institutions, and giving them some
power to alter those structures in ac
cordance with their will and needs, will
we take a step toward mending the di
visions that rive us.

Nothing less radical makes any sense
today, and really never did. What CRE
is proposing is, in reality, nothing more
than an arrangement for making a small
club of upper-middle-class white Ameri
cans feel easier in conscience, and less
guilty about not "doing anything."
Everyone in that audience was white and
well-dressed — there was not a beard
or longhair in the place—and yet those
speakers said they were interested in
connecting with the outsiders of our
society, those who don't belong to the
establishment or the fraternity of
fast, that the dispossessed of our society
squares. But CRE needs to learn, and
are — most of them — no longer inter
ested in grasping white helping hands.
They don't want to be helped, they want
to help themselves. If CRE does not
want to be furiously resented, or simply
laughed at, it should stop looking and
acting like an old-style Stanford reunion
and invite in a few of the no longer in
visible men — not just as ornamental
guests, but possibly to take over the
whole outfit.
Is anything like that possible? If so,
CRE may indeed be influential in mak
ing this country "a whole country." If
not, CRE should not be surprised to find
that its money and its efforts are spent
in pursuit of a sentimental fantasy.
