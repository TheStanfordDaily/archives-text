## How To Fight Real Institutionalized Racism 
### Stephan Weissman 
Stanford is now against institutional
racism. But no one anywhere seems able
to explain what institutional racism is.
And, as a result, our first steps toward
slaying the beast might actually be
strengthening him.
Most of us have picked up this im
portant new way of looking at racial
problems from the mimeographed
primer on "Institutional Racism in Am
erican Society." To the authors of the
primer, racism in America is something
far more complex than a flaw somewhere
in the souls of white folks. The real
racial danger, they warn, is "the over
whelming difficulty of controlling our
own institutions which, being a product
of their history, cannot but perpetuate
practices which advantage the typical
white and penalize the typical black."

This blanket definition, however, has
a very serious hole. The racist effects
of our hard-to-control institutions stem
from (at least) two different kinds of
causes. And each requires a very dif
ferent strategy for change.
Class and cultural biases in I.Q. test
ing and ability grouping in public educa
tion, for example, are in some measure
oversights and mistakes. Suppression
of black history, while in earlier periods
a conscious decision, similarly results
from an unwitting acceptance of "habits
still wed to the basic American formula
which reads White over Black." Change
in these areas will be difficult. But the
interests of well-intentioned educators
and historians do not conflict with the
needs and desires of black people. In
fact, young educators and historians will

probably find excitement and career
openings greater in the wake of the
black revolution than on the ideological
dikes of restraint.
The second kind of institutional racism
is both more difficult to define and more
difficult to combat. This is the area of
unemployment, rat-infested housing, po
lice harrassment, and blocks to independ
ent black political participation. Here,
the plight of black people is not a ques
tion of neglect or oversight. Large urban
employers, slumlords, bankers, insur
ance companies, and big city political
machines profit from the colonial posi
tion of most American blacks. Other and
greater private profits might be possible
with reform. But to end internaJ colon
ialism, we will have to step on some
very powerful toes.

Do we believe that If we ourselves
open enough room for black students in
American colleges and universities, the
ghettos will simply dissolve? Most
likely, we simply don't understand the
economics of urban land use, the work
ings of banks and insurance companies,
the role of unemployed labor in holding
down wages and inflation and in pro
viding seasonal workers.
But whatever our class biases and in
tellectual shortcomings, we have suc
cessfully ignored the continuing im
portance of ghetto violence in our own
efforts to re-order institutional priorities.
And, even in the bloom of our new
found activism, we have steadfastly re
fused to ask how we might relate both
to the violence and to the demands of
ghetto militants.

And, even in the bloom of our new
found activism, we have steadfastly re
fused to ask how we might relate both
to the violence and to the demands of
ghetto militants.
Stanford is now against institutional
racism. But no one anywhere seems able
to explain what institutional racism is.
And, as a result, our first steps toward
slaying the beast might actually be
strengthening him.
Most of us have picked up this im
portant new way of looking at racial
problems from the mimeographed
primer on "Institutional Racism in Am
erican Society." To the authors of the
primer, racism in America is something
far more complex than a flaw somewhere
in the souls of white folks. The real
racial danger, they warn, is "the over
whelming difficulty of controlling our
own institutions which, being a product
of their history, cannot but perpetuate
practices which advantage the typical
white and penalize the typical black."

This blanket definition, however, has
a very serious hole. The racist effects
of our hard-to-control institutions stem
from (at least) two different kinds of
causes. And each requires a very dif
ferent strategy for change.
Class and cultural biases in I.Q. test
ing and ability grouping in public educa
tion, for example, are in some measure
oversights and mistakes. Suppression
of black history, while in earlier periods
a conscious decision, similarly results
from an unwitting acceptance of "habits
still wed to the basic American formula
which reads White over Black." Change
in these areas will be difficult. But the
interests of well-intentioned educators
and historians do not conflict with the
needs and desires of black people. In
fact, young educators and historians will

probably find excitement and career
openings greater in the wake of the
black revolution than on the ideological
dikes of restraint.
The second kind of institutional racism
is both more difficult to define and more
difficult to combat. This is the area of
unemployment, rat-infested housing, po
lice harrassment, and blocks to independ
ent black political participation. Here,
the plight of black people is not a ques
tion of neglect or oversight. Large urban
employers, slumlords, bankers, insur
ance companies, and big city political
machines profit from the colonial posi
tion of most American blacks. Other and
greater private profits might be possible
with reform. But to end internaJ colon
ialism, we will have to step on some
very powerful toes.

Do we believe that If we ourselves
open enough room for black students in
American colleges and universities, the
ghettos will simply dissolve? Most
likely, we simply don't understand the
economics of urban land use, the work
ings of banks and insurance companies,
the role of unemployed labor in holding
down wages and inflation and in pro
viding seasonal workers.
But whatever our class biases and in
tellectual shortcomings, we have suc
cessfully ignored the continuing im
portance of ghetto violence in our own
efforts to re-order institutional priorities.
