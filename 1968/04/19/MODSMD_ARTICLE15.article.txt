## Did Jordan Deserve Edwards' Attack? 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
Wednesday's "confrontation"
in Dinkelspiel betwen Payton
Jordan and Harry Edwards on
"The Role of Black Athletes"
raises some very disturbing
questions about the role of
white coaches.
Doubtless Mr. Jordan does
not deserve some of Mr. Ed
ward's more extreme vilifica
tion, but Mr. Jordan's speech
displayed an amazing lack of
awareness of the problems of
black athletes and an alarming
insensitivity to racial issues in
general. Indeed, his speech, con
sisting almost entirely of plati
tudes and irrelevant reminis
cences, could hardly have been
less appropriate for the occa
sion, and it depresses me pro
foundly to surmise that since
Mr. Jordan is the Olympic
track coach, his own reality
gap is not untypical of the
white American athletic estab
lishment.
It may be too late to save
the 1968 Olympics, but it would
be a pity if Stanford, which at
least shows signs of willingness
to cope with minority student
problems in the academic area,
did not make similar strides in
its athletic and other extracur
ricular programs. Obviously
some re-education is needed,
and not just for students. Per
haps students (both black and
white) who are involved in the
athletic program could help to
make clearer to their coaches
and trainers that these are no
longer the days of Jesse Owens
and that new events demand
new responses. Perhaps the
Black Student Union could
work together with the Ath
letic Department in recruiting
black students who are ath
letes and in securing financial
aid for black athletes. Certain
ly we cannot be satisfied with
the sort of "communication"
manifested in Wednesday's
meeting, a sort of "communica
tion" unfortunately not limited
to athletics. If Wednesday rep
resents white America's re
sponse to black athletes' de
mands, then I say boycott, baby,
boycott.

Editor, The Daily:
My hand was raised. I wanted
my turn to ask Harry Edwards
a question. What he had said
was very upsetting personally,
and I wished to react. But no
more questions were allowed ...
Harry Edwards, as you can see
I'm white, but I am sympathetic
to the Negro cause and I
thought you made several very
good points, nevertheless, I can
not sympathize with you tac
tics. I consider Payton Jordan a
friend. I have been acquainted
with Mr. Jordan off and on for
18 years and I respect him both
as a person and as a coach. He
has lived in accordance to high
er principles than most of us
and to the normative standards
of the times as every good citi
zen tries.
But times change and I agree
with you that injustices must
cease and people considered for
their human qualities rather
than something as irrational as

the color of their skin. These in
justices have been done by de
sign by some and in ignorance
by others. But as you say, each
Negro has the potential to be
black when he comes to a dif
ferent point of awareness, and
so too for each white. He can
be made aware of his obligation
to the black. But to project onto
Payton Jordan all of the ills of
the black athlete and of black
people in a personal vendetta is
an irresponsible and irrational
act on your part.
I accept the fact that to act
you must proceed in ignorance:
Ignorance of facts, ignorance of
ultimate outcomes, ignorance of
others, but to act irresponsibly
at the moment I will not accept.
You point to Mr. Jordan as be
ing unsympathetic to the Negro
as a human being, which you
cannot pretend to know, but by
that very indictment you are
known, for you become both ac
cuser and accused. You have
shown your callousness to the
humanness of Mr. Jordan. Two
wrongs still do not make a
right. You further insult the in
telligence of your audience
when you turn a discussion of
this country's major social prob
lem into a name calling diatribe.
Finally, it is always easy to
criticize (note my efforts) while
constructive solutions are diffi
cult. They must be clearly per
ceived and diligently worked
toward. I do not see any easy
solution to our race problem,
and although I see your activity
as being beneficial in the short
run, i.e., in making Negroes
aware of being black and whites
aware of their obligation, what
then? What constructive sug
gestion do you make?
Your resolve: "No black man
will act until the white man
pulls himself together" followed
to its logical conclusion leads
to separatism and solves noth
ing. You remind me of the kid
who quits the game a poor
loser, picks up his marbles and
goes home. What can be done
by whites and blacks alike to
truly work toward a race-free
America?

Wednesday's "confrontation"
in Dinkelspiel betwen Payton
Jordan and Harry Edwards on
"The Role of Black Athletes"
raises some very disturbing
questions about the role of
white coaches.
Doubtless Mr. Jordan does
not deserve some of Mr. Ed
ward's more extreme vilifica
tion, but Mr. Jordan's speech
displayed an amazing lack of
awareness of the problems of
black athletes and an alarming
insensitivity to racial issues in
general. Indeed, his speech, con
sisting almost entirely of plati
tudes and irrelevant reminis
cences, could hardly have been
less appropriate for the occa
sion, and it depresses me pro
foundly to surmise that since
Mr. Jordan is the Olympic
track coach, his own reality
gap is not untypical of the
white American athletic estab
lishment.
It may be too late to save
the 1968 Olympics, but it would
be a pity if Stanford, which at
least shows signs of willingness
to cope with minority student
problems in the academic area,
did not make similar strides in
its athletic and other extracur
ricular programs. Obviously
some re-education is needed,
and not just for students. Per
haps students (both black and
white) who are involved in the
athletic program could help to
make clearer to their coaches
and trainers that these are no
longer the days of Jesse Owens
and that new events demand
new responses. Perhaps the
Black Student Union could
work together with the Ath
letic Department in recruiting
black students who are ath
letes and in securing financial
aid for black athletes. Certain
ly we cannot be satisfied with
the sort of "communication"
manifested in Wednesday's
meeting, a sort of "communica
tion" unfortunately not limited
to athletics. If Wednesday rep
resents white America's re
sponse to black athletes' de
mands, then I say boycott, baby,

My hand was raised. I wanted
my turn to ask Harry Edwards
a question. What he had said
was very upsetting personally,
and I wished to react. But no
more questions were allowed ...
Harry Edwards, as you can see
I'm white, but I am sympathetic
to the Negro cause and I
thought you made several very
good points, nevertheless, I can
not sympathize with you tac
tics. I consider Payton Jordan a
friend. I have been acquainted
with Mr. Jordan off and on for
18 years and I respect him both
as a person and as a coach. He
has lived in accordance to high
er principles than most of us
and to the normative standards
of the times as every good citi
zen tries.
But times change and I agree
with you that injustices must
cease and people considered for
their human qualities rather
than something as irrational as

the color of their skin. These in
justices have been done by de
sign by some and in ignorance
by others. But as you say, each
Negro has the potential to be
black when he comes to a dif
ferent point of awareness, and
so too for each white. He can
be made aware of his obligation
to the black. But to project onto
Payton Jordan all of the ills of
the black athlete and of black
people in a personal vendetta is
an irresponsible and irrational
act on your part.
I accept the fact that to act
you must proceed in ignorance:
Ignorance of facts, ignorance of
ultimate outcomes, ignorance of
others, but to act irresponsibly
at the moment I will not accept.
You point to Mr. Jordan as be
ing unsympathetic to the Negro
as a human being, which you
cannot pretend to know, but by
that very indictment you are
known, for you become both ac
cuser and accused. You have

Editor, The Daily:
My hand was raised. I wanted
my turn to ask Harry Edwards
a question. What he had said
was very upsetting personally,
and I wished to react. But no
more questions were allowed ...
Harry Edwards, as you can see
I'm white, but I am sympathetic
to the Negro cause and I
thought you made several very
good points, nevertheless, I can
not sympathize with you tac
tics. I consider Payton Jordan a
friend. I have been acquainted
with Mr. Jordan off and on for
18 years and I respect him both
as a person and as a coach. He
has lived in accordance to high
er principles than most of us
and to the normative standards
of the times as every good citi
zen tries.
But times change and I agree
with you that injustices must
cease and people considered for
their human qualities rather
than something as irrational as

the color of their skin. These in
justices have been done by de
sign by some and in ignorance
by others. But as you say, each
Negro has the potential to be
black when he comes to a dif
ferent point of awareness, and
so too for each white. He can
be made aware of his obligation
to the black. But to project onto
Payton Jordan all of the ills of
the black athlete and of black
people in a personal vendetta is
an irresponsible and irrational
act on your part.
I accept the fact that to act
you must proceed in ignorance:
Ignorance of facts, ignorance of
ultimate outcomes, ignorance of
others, but to act irresponsibly
at the moment I will not accept.
You point to Mr. Jordan as be
ing unsympathetic to the Negro
as a human being, which you
cannot pretend to know, but by
that very indictment you are
known, for you become both ac
cuser and accused. You have
shown your callousness to the
humanness of Mr. Jordan. Two
wrongs still do not make a
right. You further insult the in
telligence of your audience
when you turn a discussion of
this country's major social prob
lem into a name calling diatribe.
Finally, it is always easy to
criticize (note my efforts) while
constructive solutions are diffi
cult. They must be clearly per
ceived and diligently worked
toward. I do not see any easy
solution to our race problem,
and although I see your activity
as being beneficial in the short
run, i.e., in making Negroes
aware of being black and whites
aware of their obligation, what
then? What constructive sug
gestion do you make?
Your resolve: "No black man
will act until the white man
pulls himself together" followed
to its logical conclusion leads
to separatism and solves noth
ing. You remind me of the kid
who quits the game a poor
loser, picks up his marbles and
goes home. What can be done
by whites and blacks alike to
truly work toward a race-free
America?

I too felt deeply for Coach
Jordan for the ordeal of per
sonal insults he took on Wed
nesday. But some things must
be said now, and time cannot
be wasted trying to soothe feel
ings.
And anyhow, a man's identity
ought to be strong enough not
to be totally annihilated by ugly
sounding names. The issue of
their truth or falsity is the cru
cial one.

Wednesday's "confrontation"
in Dinkelspiel betwen Payton
Jordan and Harry Edwards on
"The Role of Black Athletes"
raises some very disturbing
questions about the role of
white coaches.
Doubtless Mr. Jordan does
not deserve some of Mr. Ed
ward's more extreme vilifica
tion, but Mr. Jordan's speech
displayed an amazing lack of
awareness of the problems of
black athletes and an alarming
insensitivity to racial issues in
general. Indeed, his speech, con
sisting almost entirely of plati
tudes and irrelevant reminis
cences, could hardly have been
less appropriate for the occa
sion, and it depresses me pro
foundly to surmise that since
Mr. Jordan is the Olympic
track coach, his own reality
gap is not untypical of the
white American athletic estab
lishment.
It may be too late to save
the 1968 Olympics, but it would
be a pity if Stanford, which at
least shows signs of willingness
to cope with minority student
problems in the academic area,
did not make similar strides in
its athletic and other extracur
ricular programs. Obviously
some re-education is needed,
and not just for students. Per
haps students (both black and
white) who are involved in the
athletic program could help to
make clearer to their coaches
and trainers that these are no
longer the days of Jesse Owens
and that new events demand
new responses. Perhaps the
Black Student Union could
work together with the Ath
letic Department in recruiting
black students who are ath
letes and in securing financial
aid for black athletes. Certain
ly we cannot be satisfied with
the sort of "communication"
manifested in Wednesday's
meeting, a sort of "communica
tion" unfortunately not limited
to athletics. If Wednesday rep
resents white America's re
sponse to black athletes' de
mands, then I say boycott, baby,
boycott.
