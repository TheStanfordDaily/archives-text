# Motion Rejected
## Harris Denies Evasion 
### 
Witnessed by a supporting
crowd of almost 100, former stu
dent body president and draft
resister David Harris yesterday
pleaded innocent to charges of
failure to report for induction
into the armed formes.
U.S. District Court Judge Al
fonso J. Zirpoli refused to listen
to a motion to dismiss the indict
ment made by Harris' attorney
Francis Heisler of Monterey and
set the trial date for May 27. The
trial is expected to last from
one to two weeks.
Judge Zirpoli also denied a
defense motion for a three-judge
court.
Saying 1 that he had read the
defense motions, the judge re
marked that he thought there
was "nothing new in the philo
sophical concepts cited."
The defense motions dealt with
the concept that draft laws are
unconstitutional because men
are deprived of equal protection
and that the laws are contrary
to the general welfare portions
of the Constitution. The motion
also expressed the opinion that
the draft laws were enacted con
trary to the "one-man, one-vote"
rule.
The judge said, "The problems
are problems people are talking
about all over the country, but
they are problems which should
be addressed to Congress or
the executive branch."
"The courts," Harris said, "re
fuse to take responsibility just
as do people all over the world."
According to Resistance
members, the court is intent
on "rushing" through Harris'
case. Yesterday's hearing was
shortened by the court's re
fusal to hear the defense mo
tions.
Among the 100 supporters of

the Resistance leader were his
bride, folk-singer Joan Baez, and
Harris' parents, Mr. and Mrs.
Clifton Harris of Fresno. The
elder Harris, an attorney, de
clared the parents were sup
porting David in his cause.
The newlyweds will be in Car
mel for the next two weeks, rest
ing at the end of a one-month
tour of colleges in the United
States and Canada before re
turning to the speaking road.
This was Harris' fourth appear
ance in court after refusing in

duction in Oakland on Jan. 17.
For his third appearance he
was summoned from New York
en-route to Montreal to answer
charges of leaving the country.
After a few minutes in court,
the opinion was established that
since Harris had appeared in
court twice before and had re
turned from New York to ap
pear for that hearing, that he
would appear for his indictment
yesterday. That evening Harris
was back on the road, headed
for Montreal.
