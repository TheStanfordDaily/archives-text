The Graduate School of Busi
ness will develop management
education programs for Yugo
slavian executives and manage
ment educators under an $85,000
Ford Foundation grant.
The grant will cover salaries
and administrative costs for a
team of top U.S. business school
professors to instruct Yugosla
vian enterprise managers and
professors of management in
latest developments in manage
ment theory and practice in sum
mer courses over th next three
years. The Yugoslavians will pay
local expenses of the U.S. con
tingent.
The summer programs are
jointly sponsored by the Yugo
slavian Federal Chamber of
Commerce and Yugoslavian As
sociation of Universities, spon
soring agencies for Yugoslavia's
new Center for the Advance
ment of Management Sciences.

The project, said the Ford
Foundation, is "in response to
a growing need for systematic
improvement of management'
theory and practice in the con
text of reforms and decentra
lization of economic decision
making in Yugoslavia." The
new management center, it
said, will also undertake and
seek to stimulate research in
such fields as structural or
ganization of enterprises, man
agerial needs, and training pol
icies and customs.
First of the series of summer
courses will be held July 21 to
August 16 this year.
Coordinating U.S. involvement
is Harper W. Boyd Jr., Sebas
tian S. Kresge, Professor of
Marketing and Director of the
International Center for the Ad
vancement Education, who will
also teach marketing manage
ment.
The goal, said Prof. Boyd,
is to build a core of "trained
people" within Yugoslavia's lead
ing enterprises and in its major
universities.
The executive development
couse will be open to 40 en
terprise managers, 30 to 50
years old, from a variety of
industries, including banking,
retailing, wholesaling and in
surance. Their study schedule
will include courses in finan
cial management, marketing
management, quantitative
methods, organizational beha
vior, managerial economics,
and business policy.
The primary purpose of the
teacher seminars, said Prof.
Boyd, is to help the professors
build their curriculums and ac
quaint them with the latest con

cepts and techniques in their
field. The seminars, which will
concentrate on marketing man
agement and organizational be
havior this year, are expected
to emphasize finance and ac
counting in 1969. The number
of U.S. professors will be grad
ually reduced year by year, with
Yugoslavians replacing Ameri
can faculty.
In addition to Prof. Boyd, who
will teach marketing manage
ment, other Stanford Business
School faculty members will be
Harold J. Leavitt, Walter Ken
neth Kilpatrick, Professor of Or
ganizational Behavior and Psy
chology, who will teach organ

T. S. Porterfield, Professor of
Finance, who will teach finan
cial management and business
policy.
The project is not a first-time
U.S. involvement in educational
programs in Yugoslavia for a
U.S. business school, Stanford
University or other American
colleges. Indiana Graduate
School of Business has had a
program going for four years;
and Stanford University has
been involved in a variety of ed
ucational programs, the most
recent of which have been a joint
symposium on Yugoslavian Re
naissance playwrights through
Stanford's Center for Research
in International Studies and a
Stanford - Smithsonian Institute
archeological study.
Other recent U.S. programs
in Yugoslavia have included city
planning and linguistics. Yugo

since its inception in 1963.

also teach marketing manage

The goal, said Prof. Boyd,
is to build a core of "trained
people" within Yugoslavia's lead
ing enterprises and in its major
universities.
The executive development
couse will be open to 40 en
terprise managers, 30 to 50
years old, from a variety of
industries, including banking,
retailing, wholesaling and in
surance. Their study schedule
will include courses in finan
cial management, marketing
management, quantitative
methods, organizational beha
vior, managerial economics,
and business policy.
The primary purpose of the
teacher seminars, said Prof.
Boyd, is to help the professors
build their curriculums and ac
quaint them with the latest con

cepts and techniques in their
field. The seminars, which will
concentrate on marketing man
agement and organizational be
havior this year, are expected
to emphasize finance and ac
counting in 1969. The number
of U.S. professors will be grad
ually reduced year by year, with
Yugoslavians replacing Ameri
can faculty.
In addition to Prof. Boyd, who
will teach marketing manage
ment, other Stanford Business
School faculty members will be
Harold J. Leavitt, Walter Ken
neth Kilpatrick, Professor of Or
ganizational Behavior and Psy
chology, who will teach organ
izational behavior; and James
T. S. Porterfield, Professor of
Finance, who will teach finan
cial management and business
policy.
The project is not a first-time
U.S. involvement in educational
programs in Yugoslavia for a
U.S. business school, Stanford
University or other American
colleges. Indiana Graduate
School of Business has had a
program going for four years;
and Stanford University has
been involved in a variety of ed
ucational programs, the most
recent of which have been a joint
symposium on Yugoslavian Re
naissance playwrights through
Stanford's Center for Research
in International Studies and a
Stanford - Smithsonian Institute
archeological study.
Other recent U.S. programs
in Yugoslavia have included city
planning and linguistics. Yugo
slavian professors of manage
ment have attended the Business
School's International Center
since its inception in 1963.
The Graduate School of Busi
ness will develop management
education programs for Yugo
slavian executives and manage
ment educators under an $85,000
Ford Foundation grant.
The grant will cover salaries
and administrative costs for a
team of top U.S. business school
professors to instruct Yugosla
vian enterprise managers and
professors of management in
latest developments in manage
ment theory and practice in sum
mer courses over th next three
years. The Yugoslavians will pay
local expenses of the U.S. con
tingent.
The summer programs are
jointly sponsored by the Yugo
slavian Federal Chamber of
Commerce and Yugoslavian As
sociation of Universities, spon
soring agencies for Yugoslavia's
new Center for the Advance
ment of Management Sciences.

The project, said the Ford
Foundation, is "in response to
a growing need for systematic
improvement of management'
theory and practice in the con
text of reforms and decentra
lization of economic decision
making in Yugoslavia." The
new management center, it
said, will also undertake and
seek to stimulate research in
such fields as structural or
ganization of enterprises, man
agerial needs, and training pol
icies and customs.
First of the series of summer
courses will be held July 21 to
August 16 this year.
