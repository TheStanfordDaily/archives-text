# CRE Backs National Service Concept
## 
### PATRICK MCMAHON 
The Community For Relevant
Education and its related groups
have taken on a project "to shift
the attitude of this country, and
eventually of the world from
one of narrow self-interest tc
one of positive and willing con
tribution to build the earth for
all people."
This project is National Ser
vice—a plan they consider an
alternative to a military-oriented
government commitment.
It would allow people to vol
unteer for "national service" at
age 18 and it would be coupled
with selective service registra
tion for men.
Like the nature of the Com
munity for Relevant Educa
tion, National Service has also
come under attack. Its critics
Insist that it results in con
scription and would destroy
the nature of volunteer work,
both with government and
private programs.
The advantages that are most
often pointed out concerning a
national service alternative are:
• it would eliminate draft in
equities.
• it would provide a large force
of teachers and community ser
vants that weren't available be

fore.
• it would be a valuable exper
ience for youth to serve their
country and to "do something"
constructive.
The Community For Relevant
Education (CRE) was formed
during fall quarter and is asso
ciated with New Sphere (just
re-named Challenge To Change),
Build The Earth, and the Na
tional Service Foundation, which
was set up at the initiation of
these other groups.
"National Service is a posi
tive force with a positive pro
gram," explained Paul Valen
tine, an area lawyer associated
with National Service Founda
tion (NSF).
However, a student who con
tends she is not in CRE but
attends many of the meetings
says "CRE may not quite under
stand the ghetto problem. It's
the sense of moral superiority
which I don't like. They say 'It's
people like you and me who can
change the world ... it's kind of
stiffling. They are naive if they
think they can create action in
the world just because of the
inter-action groups..."
She said that she enjoyed the
interaction groups themselves
somewhat.

One CRE member said na
tional service is a "channel
through which kids can extend
themselves to the society."
Mark Herrick, a senior in pre
med, said "National Service is
creative acts growing from inner
experience."
After several Intra-CRE dis
cussions, it was decided that
the program should be volun
tary. The proposal originally
called for compulsory service
to the country—either mili
tary or social service.
Herrick said, "the compul
sory angle was a huge hang-up.
We got rid of it. If we could
change the consciences of peo
ple in America to where they
could view people as people, war
would no longer necessarily be
a means of solution to prob
lems."
"Does National Service mean
I don't have to go to Vietnam
and be shot down?" is an often
asked question, which several
GRE people disagree on.
The proposal states that "Men
may make a choice between ci
vilian and military service, or
make no choice at all. Military
needs will be satisfied first by
volunteers for military service,

then by conscription from those
who make no choice as to pref
erence ... then, as necessary, by
conscription from volunteers for
civilian service."
BUI McElroy, senior electri
cal engineering major said the
call-up of the third group, "If
things had changed so that It
was a national emergency,peo
ple would feel it was valid."
Margie Sussman, a freshman
said "the difference is that
you've already expressed a re
sponse to serve your nation.
You wouldn't be just dragged
into it."
However, Charles Burbach, a
political science senior and a
CRE member said that he "can't
see any difference really" be
tween the military situation now
and the time when the civilian
volunteers would have to be
called up for military duty.
A new book The Draft? pub
lished by the American Friends
Service Committee in one chap
ter questions National Service
and the results it might have.
Opinion in the book is that
while remedying the inequities
of the Selective Service System,
now ones would develop. It cites
such difficulties as who would

fight and who would work or
who would risk his life and who
wouldn't.
The book states "Nor would
the threat of further encroach
ments of the state on the life of
the individual be eliminated or
reduced by making a national
service plan voluntary rather
than compulsory. No matter
what labels were applied, there
is real danger that any national
service plan might, in fact, be
come compulsory. This could
happen in various ways."
They suggest that, "It Is not
Inconceiveable that failure to
choose ci\lllan service could
make one vulnerable for mili
tary Induction. If this tran
spired, then national service
would not be voluntary but
compulsory no matter what it
was called."
National Service Foundation
says 'The foundation will de
velop a growing, living pilot
program of National Service
with the objective of having the
federal government as a partner,
together with private interest,
in a nationwide National Service
program."
NSF is legally run by a group
of citizens in the Bay Area and
includes some students. It is not
officially associated with CRE
although they support each oth
er and are composed of many of
the same people. They are in
contact with the National Ser
vice Secretary in Washington,
D.C. who is charged with work
ing on National Service ideas.
An editorial in October, 1966, on
radio KPFA was entitled "Na
tional Service —The Road To A
Conscripted Society." The sta
tion said, "What we need is not
an extension of conscription, but
an end to it at least in peace
time. Nothing else could be so
effective in altering the focus of
our foreign policy from unilater
al military intervention to inter
national cooperation for justice
and human welfare."
A director of a voluntary
agency expressed recently that
national service would "alter
substantially the role of a pri
vate or public voluntary agen.-
cy."
He suggested that voluntary
groups would have to be ap
proved by the federal govern
ment of service were to replace
the draft. He suggested that the
government might be upset
if SDS-type groups were in
cluded "Then, agencies would
have to be careful about their
projects in order not to lose
their status."

An editorial in October, 1966, on
radio KPFA was entitled "Na
tional Service —The Road To A
Conscripted Society." The sta
tion said, "What we need is not
an extension of conscription, but
an end to it at least in peace
time. Nothing else could be so
effective in altering the focus of
our foreign policy from unilater
al military intervention to inter
national cooperation for justice
and human welfare."
A director of a voluntary
agency expressed recently that
national service would "alter
substantially the role of a pri
vate or public voluntary agen.-
cy."
He suggested that voluntary
groups would have to be ap
proved by the federal govern
ment of service were to replace
the draft. He suggested that the
government might be upset
if SDS-type groups were in
cluded "Then, agencies would
have to be careful about their
projects in order not to lose
their status."
The Community For Relevant
Education and its related groups
have taken on a project "to shift
the attitude of this country, and
eventually of the world from
one of narrow self-interest tc
one of positive and willing con
tribution to build the earth for
all people."
This project is National Ser
vice—a plan they consider an
alternative to a military-oriented
government commitment.
It would allow people to vol
unteer for "national service" at
age 18 and it would be coupled
with selective service registra
tion for men.
Like the nature of the Com
munity for Relevant Educa
tion, National Service has also
come under attack. Its critics
Insist that it results in con
scription and would destroy
the nature of volunteer work,
both with government and
private programs.
The advantages that are most
often pointed out concerning a
national service alternative are:
• it would eliminate draft in
equities.
• it would provide a large force
of teachers and community ser
vants that weren't available be

fore.
• it would be a valuable exper
ience for youth to serve their
country and to "do something"
constructive.
The Community For Relevant
Education (CRE) was formed
during fall quarter and is asso
ciated with New Sphere (just
re-named Challenge To Change),
Build The Earth, and the Na
tional Service Foundation, which
was set up at the initiation of
these other groups.
"National Service is a posi
tive force with a positive pro
gram," explained Paul Valen
tine, an area lawyer associated
with National Service Founda
tion (NSF).
However, a student who con
tends she is not in CRE but
attends many of the meetings
says "CRE may not quite under
stand the ghetto problem. It's
the sense of moral superiority
which I don't like. They say 'It's
people like you and me who can
change the world ... it's kind of
stiffling. They are naive if they
think they can create action in
the world just because of the
inter-action groups..."
She said that she enjoyed the
interaction groups themselves
somewhat.

One CRE member said na
tional service is a "channel
through which kids can extend
themselves to the society."
Mark Herrick, a senior in pre
med, said "National Service is
creative acts growing from inner
experience."
After several Intra-CRE dis
cussions, it was decided that
the program should be volun
tary. The proposal originally
called for compulsory service
to the country—either mili
tary or social service.
Herrick said, "the compul
sory angle was a huge hang-up.
We got rid of it. If we could
change the consciences of peo
ple in America to where they
could view people as people, war
would no longer necessarily be
a means of solution to prob
lems."
"Does National Service mean
I don't have to go to Vietnam
and be shot down?" is an often
asked question, which several
GRE people disagree on.
The proposal states that "Men
may make a choice between ci
vilian and military service, or
make no choice at all. Military
needs will be satisfied first by
volunteers for military service,

then by conscription from those
who make no choice as to pref
erence ... then, as necessary, by
conscription from volunteers for
civilian service."
BUI McElroy, senior electri
cal engineering major said the
call-up of the third group, "If
things had changed so that It
was a national emergency,peo
ple would feel it was valid."
Margie Sussman, a freshman
said "the difference is that
you've already expressed a re
sponse to serve your nation.
You wouldn't be just dragged
into it."
However, Charles Burbach, a
political science senior and a
CRE member said that he "can't
see any difference really" be
tween the military situation now
and the time when the civilian
volunteers would have to be
called up for military duty.
A new book The Draft? pub
lished by the American Friends
Service Committee in one chap

and the results it might have.
Opinion in the book is that
while remedying the inequities
of the Selective Service System,
now ones would develop. It cites
such difficulties as who would

fight and who would work or
who would risk his life and who
wouldn't.
The book states "Nor would
the threat of further encroach
ments of the state on the life of
the individual be eliminated or
reduced by making a national
service plan voluntary rather
than compulsory. No matter
what labels were applied, there
is real danger that any national
service plan might, in fact, be
come compulsory. This could
happen in various ways."
They suggest that, "It Is not
Inconceiveable that failure to
choose ci\lllan service could
make one vulnerable for mili

spired, then national service
would not be voluntary but
compulsory no matter what it
was called."

An editorial in October, 1966, on
radio KPFA was entitled "Na

Conscripted Society." The sta

an extension of conscription, but
an end to it at least in peace
time. Nothing else could be so
effective in altering the focus of
our foreign policy from unilater
al military intervention to inter
national cooperation for justice
and human welfare."
A director of a voluntary
agency expressed recently that
national service would "alter
substantially the role of a pri
vate or public voluntary agen.-
cy."
He suggested that voluntary
groups would have to be ap
proved by the federal govern
ment of service were to replace
the draft. He suggested that the
government might be upset
if SDS-type groups were in
cluded "Then, agencies would
have to be careful about their
projects in order not to lose
their status."
The Community For Relevant
Education and its related groups
have taken on a project "to shift
the attitude of this country, and
eventually of the world from
one of narrow self-interest tc
one of positive and willing con
tribution to build the earth for
all people."
This project is National Ser
vice—a plan they consider an
alternative to a military-oriented
government commitment.
It would allow people to vol
unteer for "national service" at
age 18 and it would be coupled
with selective service registra
tion for men.
Like the nature of the Com
munity for Relevant Educa
tion, National Service has also
come under attack. Its critics
Insist that it results in con
scription and would destroy
the nature of volunteer work,
both with government and
private programs.
The advantages that are most
often pointed out concerning a
national service alternative are:
• it would eliminate draft in
equities.
• it would provide a large force
of teachers and community ser
vants that weren't available be

fore.
• it would be a valuable exper
ience for youth to serve their
country and to "do something"
constructive.
The Community For Relevant
Education (CRE) was formed
during fall quarter and is asso
ciated with New Sphere (just
re-named Challenge To Change),

was set up at the initiation of
these other groups.
"National Service is a posi
tive force with a positive pro
gram," explained Paul Valen
tine, an area lawyer associated
with National Service Founda
tion (NSF).
However, a student who con
tends she is not in CRE but
attends many of the meetings
says "CRE may not quite under
stand the ghetto problem. It's
the sense of moral superiority
which I don't like. They say 'It's
people like you and me who can
change the world ... it's kind of
stiffling. They are naive if they
think they can create action in
the world just because of the
inter-action groups..."
She said that she enjoyed the
interaction groups themselves
somewhat.

One CRE member said na
tional service is a "channel
through which kids can extend
themselves to the society."
Mark Herrick, a senior in pre
med, said "National Service is
creative acts growing from inner
experience."
After several Intra-CRE dis
cussions, it was decided that
the program should be volun
tary. The proposal originally
called for compulsory service
to the country—either mili
tary or social service.
Herrick said, "the compul
sory angle was a huge hang-up.
We got rid of it. If we could
change the consciences of peo
ple in America to where they
could view people as people, war
would no longer necessarily be
a means of solution to prob
lems."
"Does National Service mean
I don't have to go to Vietnam
and be shot down?" is an often
asked question, which several
GRE people disagree on.
The proposal states that "Men
may make a choice between ci
vilian and military service, or
make no choice at all. Military
needs will be satisfied first by
volunteers for military service,

then by conscription from those
who make no choice as to pref
erence ... then, as necessary, by
conscription from volunteers for
civilian service."
BUI McElroy, senior electri
cal engineering major said the
call-up of the third group, "If
things had changed so that It
was a national emergency,peo
ple would feel it was valid."
Margie Sussman, a freshman
said "the difference is that
you've already expressed a re
sponse to serve your nation.
You wouldn't be just dragged
into it."
However, Charles Burbach, a
political science senior and a
CRE member said that he "can't
see any difference really" be
tween the military situation now
and the time when the civilian
volunteers would have to be
called up for military duty.

make no choice at all. Military
needs will be satisfied first by
volunteers for military service,

then by conscription from those
who make no choice as to pref
erence ... then, as necessary, by
conscription from volunteers for
civilian service."
BUI McElroy, senior electri
cal engineering major said the
call-up of the third group, "If
things had changed so that It
was a national emergency,peo
ple would feel it was valid."
Margie Sussman, a freshman
said "the difference is that
you've already expressed a re
sponse to serve your nation.
You wouldn't be just dragged
into it."
However, Charles Burbach, a
political science senior and a
CRE member said that he "can't
see any difference really" be
tween the military situation now
and the time when the civilian
volunteers would have to be
called up for military duty.
A new book The Draft? pub
lished by the American Friends
Service Committee in one chap
ter questions National Service
and the results it might have.
Opinion in the book is that
while remedying the inequities
of the Selective Service System,
now ones would develop. It cites
such difficulties as who would

fight and who would work or
who would risk his life and who
wouldn't.
The book states "Nor would
the threat of further encroach
ments of the state on the life of
the individual be eliminated or
reduced by making a national
service plan voluntary rather
than compulsory. No matter
what labels were applied, there
is real danger that any national
service plan might, in fact, be
come compulsory. This could
happen in various ways."
They suggest that, "It Is not
Inconceiveable that failure to
choose ci\lllan service could
make one vulnerable for mili
tary Induction. If this tran
spired, then national service
would not be voluntary but
compulsory no matter what it
was called."
National Service Foundation
says 'The foundation will de
velop a growing, living pilot
program of National Service
with the objective of having the
federal government as a partner,
together with private interest,
in a nationwide National Service
program."
NSF is legally run by a group
of citizens in the Bay Area and
includes some students. It is not
officially associated with CRE
although they support each oth
er and are composed of many of
the same people. They are in
contact with the National Ser
vice Secretary in Washington,
D.C. who is charged with work
ing on National Service ideas.
An editorial in October, 1966, on
radio KPFA was entitled "Na
tional Service —The Road To A
Conscripted Society." The sta
tion said, "What we need is not
an extension of conscription, but
an end to it at least in peace
time. Nothing else could be so
effective in altering the focus of
our foreign policy from unilater
al military intervention to inter
national cooperation for justice
and human welfare."
A director of a voluntary
agency expressed recently that
national service would "alter
substantially the role of a pri
vate or public voluntary agen.-
cy."
He suggested that voluntary
groups would have to be ap
proved by the federal govern
ment of service were to replace
the draft. He suggested that the
government might be upset
if SDS-type groups were in
cluded "Then, agencies would
have to be careful about their
projects in order not to lose
their status."
