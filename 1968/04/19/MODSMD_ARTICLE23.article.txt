# Contrary To Skeptics
## Store Holds Prices 
### MARTHA HUMPHREY 
Common in the mind of a
student waiting in line for the
cash register in the Tresidder
Store is the vague suspicion that
he is being overcharged.
This is caused both by a
healthy skepticism and by the
whispers of our inescapable mer
cantile heritage that says a
store this convenient must
charge more. Nobody would deny
that the Tresidder Store has a
captive audience and a virtual
monopoly on the market area.
To test the belief that the
prices in the store are excessive,
the prices of about twenty com
mon drug and cosmetic items
in the store were compared
with those of identical items in
a drug store in a nearby shop
ping center.
On the whole the prices in the
two stores correspond exactly,
the only difference being that
the off-campus stores carry the
"large economy size" in most
items checked.
In some articles, the prices of
the off-campus store are a little
higher.
Another common belief is that
the store is owned privately and
the space rented from the Uni
versity. However, the Tresidder
Store is owned by Stanford and
operated as a Tresidder Union
service.
The store is essentially non
profit since any profit above the
salaries of the store's employees
is used to fund other aspects of
the Union, such as its programs.
Miss Frances Silva, who has
been manager of the Tresidder
Store since its creation six years
ago, says that in spite of the pre
vailing suspicions towards the
store's ownership and business
practices, the store exists pri
marily as a service for students.
Prices are kept equitable
with those of merchants In
Palo Alto who own similar
sized stores. Miss Silva adds
that no attempt is made to
keep prices as low as some of
the cut-rate drug stores in the
area, since there is such a dif
ference in volume.
She admits that the prices of
the two necessities particular to
students, cigarettes and instant
coffee, are high. "Our price for
coffee is expensive," she says,
"but this is because we buy only
a case or two from the manu
facture at a time. Therefore they
don't give us the lower prices
that they give the groceries."
Cigarettes are a little more
expensive because the Store is
contracted to buy its supplies
at a set price from the company
that services the vending ma
chines on campus.
At present there are no plans
to enlarge the store, though this
might serve to lower prices and
increase the variety of stock.
Miss Silva speaks of the de
mands of some students on the

small store. "We have gotten all items from dogfood to dispos
sorts of calls from students for able diapers."


BOOMING BUSINESS â€” Students continue to patronize the Tre
sidder Union Store. Comparisons show the campus store's prices
are competitive with off-campus stores, contrary to frequent charges.
