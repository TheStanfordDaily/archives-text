## 'Sweet Bird' Well Adapted To Film 
### THOMAS STOCKFISH 
Film has a way of retiring
plays from circulation as far as
production is concerned. Once a
reasonably competent version of
a Broadway smash is in the can,
subsequent productions, partic
ularly by organizations and per
sons with resources less lumi
nous than those of Hollywood
or TV, often seem superfluous—
at best mere exercises.
Exceptions to this generaliza
tion include plays which are un
usually stage-bound and do not
lend themselves to cinematic
treatment, and those which are
so many-faceted that no single
rendering does them full jus
tice.

Of course these media some
times also present very poor
renditions of plays which could
have been adapted very well.
The wretched Hollywood and
TV versions of Tennessee Wil
liams' Gla«s Menagerie are clas
sic instances of such failure.
Failure was not the ease,
however with Richard Brooks'
film of Williams' Sweet Bird
of Youth, which utilized sev
eral of the principals of the
Broadway production, includ
ing Geraldine Page and Paul
Newman. The movie was
widely distributed, and Ed
Begley won an Oscar for his
portrayal of Boss Finley In it
In the light of this able prece

dent, any group which chooses
to restage Sweet Bird now, is
playing against a stacked deck.
This is not to say that the play
should not continue to be seen.
Dealing in part with a South
ern political boss and the racism
he perpetrates, it could even be
described as timely. But how
can you top the big screen?
I went to the production of
Sweet Bird currently at the Cir
cle Star Theatre on Bayshore in
San Carlos primarily to see
Shelley Winters' work, and came
away satisfied. Largely I was
satisfied for reasons which have
little to do with the merits of
the production as such.
Miss Winters is cast as an

aging screen idol. She executes
the role, more crudely, funnier
and in a less restrained manner
than Geraldine Page and is well
worth witnessing. Her rendi
tion suffers, nevertheless, from
its production context.
Substantial liberties have
been taken with the script.
Some minor characters, one lo
cale, and many lines have been
deleted.
The director, Rick Edelstein,
and several actors in addition to
Miss Winters are affiliated with
the Actors' Studio, which advo
cates the actors' discovering the
inner truth of a role. However,
the acting in this production is
very superficial.
Jackie Coogan is well used as
Boss Finley, but with the ex
ceptions of his performance and
Miss Winters', the general im
pression one receives is of a
lack of rehearsal and direction.
But, all In all, one's sensi
bilities are somehow not too
offended. Sweet Bird Is In no

way a deep play; a surface
rendering: of It is not a monu
mental aesthetic Injustice.
And the Circle Star is no pal
ace of Kultur. Its cocktail
lounge, restaurant, lobby musi
cians and moviehouse refresh
ment stands tell the tale all too
clearly. Ya pays yer money, ya
sees the show. At least we are
not promised significance and
apportioned pap, as has often
been the case at ACT and SRT
of late.
Sweet Bird is in some re
spects an intimate, intense
drama. Such characteristics are
pretty well precluded by the
Circle Star's circus-like audito
rium.
But this play also has a pano
ramic dimension which is fairly
well actualized in the produc
tion, such as by having Youth
for Tom Finley parading noisily
in the and placing a real,
live Cadillac on stage.
Bird flies nightly through
Sunday, with weekend matinees.


SWEET YOUTH — Posing here in "Sweet Bird
of Youth" are Jackie Coogan and Luana Tnders.
The two star with Shelley Winters in a film

rendering does them full jus
tice.

Of course these media some
times also present very poor
renditions of plays which could
have been adapted very well.
The wretched Hollywood and
TV versions of Tennessee Wil
liams' Gla«s Menagerie are clas
sic instances of such failure.
Failure was not the ease,
however with Richard Brooks'
film of Williams' Sweet Bird
of Youth, which utilized sev
eral of the principals of the
Broadway production, includ
ing Geraldine Page and Paul
Newman. The movie was
widely distributed, and Ed
Begley won an Oscar for his
portrayal of Boss Finley In it
In the light of this able prece

dent, any group which chooses
to restage Sweet Bird now, is
playing against a stacked deck.
This is not to say that the play
should not continue to be seen.
Dealing in part with a South
ern political boss and the racism
he perpetrates, it could even be
described as timely. But how
can you top the big screen?
I went to the production of
Sweet Bird currently at the Cir
cle Star Theatre on Bayshore in
San Carlos primarily to see
Shelley Winters' work, and came
away satisfied. Largely I was
satisfied for reasons which have
little to do with the merits of
the production as such.
Miss Winters is cast as an

aging screen idol. She executes
the role, more crudely, funnier
and in a less restrained manner
than Geraldine Page and is well
worth witnessing. Her rendi
tion suffers, nevertheless, from
its production context.
Substantial liberties have
been taken with the script.
Some minor characters, one lo
cale, and many lines have been
deleted.
The director, Rick Edelstein,
and several actors in addition to
Miss Winters are affiliated with
the Actors' Studio, which advo
cates the actors' discovering the
inner truth of a role. However,
the acting in this production is
very superficial.
Jackie Coogan is well used as
Boss Finley, but with the ex
ceptions of his performance and
Miss Winters', the general im
pression one receives is of a
lack of rehearsal and direction.
But, all In all, one's sensi
bilities are somehow not too
offended. Sweet Bird Is In no

way a deep play; a surface
rendering: of It is not a monu
mental aesthetic Injustice.
And the Circle Star is no pal
ace of Kultur. Its cocktail
lounge, restaurant, lobby musi
cians and moviehouse refresh
ment stands tell the tale all too
clearly. Ya pays yer money, ya
sees the show. At least we are
not promised significance and
apportioned pap, as has often
been the case at ACT and SRT
of late.
Sweet Bird is in some re
spects an intimate, intense
drama. Such characteristics are
pretty well precluded by the
Circle Star's circus-like audito
rium.
But this play also has a pano
ramic dimension which is fairly
well actualized in the produc
tion, such as by having Youth
for Tom Finley parading noisily
in the and placing a real,
live Cadillac on stage.
Bird flies nightly through
Sunday, with weekend matinees.


SWEET YOUTH — Posing here in "Sweet Bird
of Youth" are Jackie Coogan and Luana Tnders.
The two star with Shelley Winters in a film

adaptation of Tennessee Williams' stage play.
The movie is being shown at the Circle Star
Theater.
Film has a way of retiring
plays from circulation as far as
production is concerned. Once a
reasonably competent version of
a Broadway smash is in the can,
subsequent productions, partic
ularly by organizations and per
sons with resources less lumi
nous than those of Hollywood
or TV, often seem superfluous—
at best mere exercises.
Exceptions to this generaliza

usually stage-bound and do not
lend themselves to cinematic
treatment, and those which are
so many-faceted that no single
rendering does them full jus
tice.
