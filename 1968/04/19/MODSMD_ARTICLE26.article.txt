# Documentary 'War Game' Wins Oscar And BBC Ban
## 
### 
'The War Game,' which won
an academy award in the cate
gory of documentary features,
has been described as "a warn
ing masterpiece" of disaster,
and "may be the most import
ant film ever made," in the
words of Kenneth Tynan, re
viewer for the National Ob
server.
The film was produced by
Peter Watkins for the British
Broadcasting Company, and due
to its impact, was promtly ban
ned by that same organization.
The 47-minute film was ap
parently too realistic in its de
picting of the horrors of a nu
clear holocaust for the general
public to accept, so the film was
never scheduled for television
viewing, as was originally in
tended.
The plot is along traditional
lines as it prepares the scene
for nuclear confrontation. Due
to sudden escalation in Vietnam,
Berlin is sealed off by the Rus
sians, at which point the Ameri
cans retaliate by firing tactical
nuclear weapons. Not to be out
done, the Russians strike back
and the race is on.
The opening part of the movie
is staged in a form resembling
a news special. A metalic voiced
narrator reels off the grim suc
cession of events; the original
escalation, evacuation, and panic
which are followed by the blast,
shock wave, and firestorm char
acteristic of a nuclear explosion.

However, part of the genius
of this film lies in its under
statement. The viewer never ac
tually sees a nuclear explosion,
and is not assaulted by pure
physical horrors.
Instead, the viewer is horri
fied by the unbelievable "stupid
ities that are all too painfully
understandable." John Haag, of
Pennsylvania State University
English Department continues,
"It does not formulate for us
what we should think, but shows
us what it will cost us not to
think."
The War Game is also an at
tempt to demonstrate the price
of apathy towards the bomb on
the part of the world's popula
tion. Mary Evans, of he National
Catholic Reporter wrote, " 'The
War Game* is an all-out attempt
to convey to the complacent ex
actly what nuclear war would
mean.
"The film places the burden of
responsibility and also the
means of salvation exactly
where it belongs: on the voter.
The film makes it abundantly
clear that this is no time to be
trusting blindly to the judgment
of blind leaders."
To add to the emotional
power of the film's credibility,
no trained actors are used in the
film. All roles are played by a
group of drama students and
their families and friends.
Also, Tynan states, "The film
contains no resonant generalities
about the nobility of man; in
stead, it shows us shattered,
astonished specimens of a race
that adapted itself too readily
to an insane power structure,
and so died."
Director Watkins is severly
criticizing the "nuclear balance
of terror" in his film, and thinks
that 'The War Game' is the first
film ever made which deals hon
estly with the subject. He dis
counts both 'Fail-Safe,' and 'Dr.
Strangelove' because "they each
have an escape route built in."
"They've never shown what
the bombs do and . . . end at the
moment of detonation. They
make one hopelessly fatalistic,
and thus able to evade responsi
bility. There is no escape valve
in 'The War Game'."
What Watkins says is most
fearful is the "blanket silence"

about the bomb. "The bomb,"
he says, "has been totally ac
cepted and doesn't even figure
as a political issue any more."
Kenneth Tynan believes that
because of the tremendous
apathy to the potential horrors
of the bomb, the film "should
not only be televised, but
screened in cinemas, not just
here, but everywhere on earth."

cans retaliate by firing tactical
nuclear weapons. Not to be out
done, the Russians strike back
and the race is on.
The opening part of the movie
is staged in a form resembling
a news special. A metalic voiced
narrator reels off the grim suc
cession of events; the original
escalation, evacuation, and panic
which are followed by the blast,
shock wave, and firestorm char
acteristic of a nuclear explosion.

However, part of the genius
of this film lies in its under
statement. The viewer never ac
tually sees a nuclear explosion,
and is not assaulted by pure
physical horrors.
Instead, the viewer is horri
fied by the unbelievable "stupid
ities that are all too painfully
understandable." John Haag, of
Pennsylvania State University
English Department continues,
"It does not formulate for us
what we should think, but shows
us what it will cost us not to
think."
The War Game is also an at
tempt to demonstrate the price
of apathy towards the bomb on
the part of the world's popula
tion. Mary Evans, of he National
Catholic Reporter wrote, " 'The
War Game* is an all-out attempt
to convey to the complacent ex
actly what nuclear war would
mean.
"The film places the burden of
responsibility and also the
means of salvation exactly
where it belongs: on the voter.
The film makes it abundantly
clear that this is no time to be
trusting blindly to the judgment
of blind leaders."
To add to the emotional
power of the film's credibility,
no trained actors are used in the
film. All roles are played by a
group of drama students and
their families and friends.
Also, Tynan states, "The film
contains no resonant generalities
about the nobility of man; in
stead, it shows us shattered,
astonished specimens of a race
that adapted itself too readily
to an insane power structure,
and so died."
Director Watkins is severly
criticizing the "nuclear balance
of terror" in his film, and thinks
that 'The War Game' is the first
film ever made which deals hon
estly with the subject. He dis
counts both 'Fail-Safe,' and 'Dr.
Strangelove' because "they each
have an escape route built in."
"They've never shown what
the bombs do and . . . end at the
moment of detonation. They
make one hopelessly fatalistic,
and thus able to evade responsi
bility. There is no escape valve
in 'The War Game'."
What Watkins says is most
fearful is the "blanket silence"

about the bomb. "The bomb,"
he says, "has been totally ac
cepted and doesn't even figure
as a political issue any more."
Kenneth Tynan believes that
because of the tremendous
apathy to the potential horrors
of the bomb, the film "should
not only be televised, but
screened in cinemas, not just
here, but everywhere on earth."
'The War Game,' which won
an academy award in the cate
gory of documentary features,
has been described as "a warn
ing masterpiece" of disaster,
and "may be the most import

words of Kenneth Tynan, re
viewer for the National Ob
server.
The film was produced by
Peter Watkins for the British

The 47-minute film was ap
parently too realistic in its de

clear holocaust for the general
public to accept, so the film was
never scheduled for television

The plot is along traditional
lines as it prepares the scene

Berlin is sealed off by the Rus
