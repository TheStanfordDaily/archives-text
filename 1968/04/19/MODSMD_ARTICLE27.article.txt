# Resisters Hand In 550 Draft Cards
## 
### 
(CPS) Approximately 550
draft cards were turned in at
demonstrations last week,
almost all of them on Wednes
day, the third national day of
draft resistance held during this
academic year.
This brings the total of draft
cards that have been turned in
or burned this year to about
1,800, according to the Rosist
ance. More than 1,000 were
turned in on the first draft re
sistance day, October 16, and an
additional 150 on December 4.
The three major demonstra
tions Wednesday were in Bos
ton, San Francisco, and New
York.
In Boston about 200 persons
turned in draft cards at a dem
onstration on the Boston Com
mons before a crowd of 12,000.
The cards were sent to Presiden
tial candidate Robert F. Ken
nedy, rather than to the Justice
Department as is usual. Three
persons also turned in their in
duction papers.
In San Francisco draft resist
ers from throughout the Bay
Area turned in 144 draft cards
to 92 women, 13 clergymen, and
12 veterans who will mail them
to the Justice Department, mak
ing them liable for aiding draft
resistors. About 2,000 people at
tended the rally at the Federal
Building in San Francisco.
In New York 80 cards were
turned in at a demonstration

before a crowd of 2,500 in Cen
tral Park. Another 501 persons
signed cards indicating complic
ity with the resistors.
There were demonstrations in
three other major cities with 24
cards turned in in Philadelphia,
eight in Los Angeles, and 14 in
Minneapolis. 53 cards were re
turned on campuses nationwide.
As expected, there was an in
crease over the number of cards
turned in in December, prob
ably due primarily to the aboli
tion of graduate student defer
ments, which draft resistance
leaders say has greatly increased
student interest in their efforts.
But the number of cards may
have been cut back somewhat
by President Johnson's bombing
pause and decision not to run
for re-election.

tended the rally at the Federal
Building in San Francisco.
In New York 80 cards were
turned in at a demonstration

before a crowd of 2,500 in Cen
tral Park. Another 501 persons
signed cards indicating complic
ity with the resistors.
There were demonstrations in
three other major cities with 24
cards turned in in Philadelphia,
eight in Los Angeles, and 14 in
Minneapolis. 53 cards were re
turned on campuses nationwide.
As expected, there was an in
crease over the number of cards
turned in in December, prob
ably due primarily to the aboli
tion of graduate student defer
ments, which draft resistance
leaders say has greatly increased
student interest in their efforts.
But the number of cards may
have been cut back somewhat
by President Johnson's bombing
pause and decision not to run
for re-election.
