# Pac-8 Baseball '68
## It's Stanford-UCLA In Opener 
### GARY CAVALLI 
Pacific-8 baseball action gets
underway this afternoon as
Stanford hosts UCLA at 3 p.m.
on the Sunken Diamond. Tomor
row the Tribe hosts a rugged
USC nine for a doubleheader
beginning at noon.
Coach Ray Young's Indians,
22-5 in exhibition play, are fa
vorites to repeat their 1967 con
ference championship perfor
mance which saw them win 10
of 11 ballgames.
It will be a long rugged haul
for the eventual champion this
year, though, as the schedule
has been enlarged to 21 contests.
This means the emphasis will
be on pitching, and that is where
the Tribe seems to have have
the advantage over the other
Pac-8 teams.
Today's opponent, the Bruins,
have notched an impressive 20-8
record in pre-season play, and
must rank as one of the con
tenders for the loop title. USC
(22-9), Oregon State (14-1),
Washington State (17-2), and
Oregon (134) must also be con
sidered possible threats for the
'68 crown.

This weekend the Tribe will
send to the hill a trio of pitchers
who have accounted for two
thirds of the club's wins. Har
vey Shank, who picked up his
sixth win against Fresno State
last week, Rod Poteete, and
Sandy Vance make up the im
pressive threesome that will face
UCLA today and USC in to
morrow's twin bill.
Coach Young, who has been
pleased with the team's play
of late, analyzed Stanford's role
in the '68 race in the following
way:
"Our defense has reached a
high point," Young said, point
ing to a series of crucial double
plays over the weekend. "The
batting has steadily improved,
and the pitching has remained
strong.
"The large number of close

games before the opening of
conference action has taught the
team how to perform under
pressure and how to work for
individual runs using such tac
tics as steals, hit and runs, and
squeezes," Young continued.
"We can not logically expect
to play without a loss or even
lose just once as we did last
year in the Pacific-8, but on the
other hand we are in a good posi
tion to go all the way again.
Each team in the league will be
gunning for us by using their
best pitchers, but that's the way
we want it. The pressure will
be on them as much as us," he
concluded.
UCLA, noted during the past
few years as a strong early sea
son team, recently notched a 9 3
win over Occidental to boost
its season record to 20-8. The In

dians hope to maintain a re
cent mastery of the Bruins which
includes ten consecutive wins
over the Westwooders.
Bruin short stop Gary Sanser
ino is having his best year yet
at the plate and is being ably
supported by Steve Runk. Steve
Klausen, who topped the Paci
fic-8 with a .438 average in 1967,
also has power as he connected
for five round trippers last year.
Probable pitcher will be Guy
Hansen, who posted a 10-3 rec
ord a year ago, or Allan Hoops.
Saturday's opponent, USC, has
a series lead of 99 to 44. The
past three years a balance of
power has prevailed, and neither
team has been able to win a
season series.
The Indians scored a 9-4 non
league triumph against Troy
earlier in the season on the

strenth of a six run outburst in
the late innings. The Indian?
will probably face Bob Vaughn,
who has developed into the Tro
jan's 1968 ace, and Bill Lee, the
1967 Troy leader in wins with
13 against only 4 losses.
Saturday's ball games will be
aired on KZSU, 90.1 FM by an
nouncers John Wright and Stan
Mires. The broadcast will begin
at 11:55.
