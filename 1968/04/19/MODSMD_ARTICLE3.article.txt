## Telephone Strike Begins 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)—Some
165,000 telephone workers
walked out in a wage dispute
Thursday in their first nation
wide strike in 21 years, but
there appeared little initial in
terruption of phone service.
"The strike is on," said Jo
seph A. Beirne, president of
the AFL-CIO Communications
Workers, as he urged another
500,000 telephone employes to
refuse to cross the strikers'
picket lines.
Beirne then joined a pi c k e t
line at the Chesepeake and Po
tomac Telephone Co. of Wash
ington for about an hour.
Officials of the Bell Telephone
System and its parent firm,
American Telephone & Tele
graph Co., said they expect to
maintain almost normal service
as supervisors took over many
jobs.
But Beirne said if manage
ment officials think they can
run the huge national telephone
network for long without the
striking union members. "They
must be taking something some
what stronger than LSD."
• LB J On Talks
SAN ANTONIO, Tex. (AP) —
President Johnson said Thurs
day preliminary talks with
North Vietnam must be at a site
where other governments in
volved in the Vietnam war can
have representatives — which
seemed to rule out Warsaw.
The chief executive listed this
among four requirements for
the discussions to determine
whether serious peace negotia
tions can begin. The other three
conditions are similar to those
set forth before by the United
States.
Hanoi and Washington have
been jockeying for more than
two weeks in so far fruitless ef
forts for a site.
• 'Poor People * Plans
ATLANTA, Ga. (AP) — The

Poor People's Campaign in
Washington was outlined Thurs
day as a four-part program of
pressure to get congressional
action against poverty.
Leaders said it would be con
ducted just as Dr. Martin Lu
ther King Jr., had planned it.
Announced at a news confer
ence, the campaign will start
April 29 with some talks in
Washington and will culminate
with what was described as a
crusade of hundreds of thou
sands of demonstrators.
The Rev. Ralph Abernathy,
successor to King as head of the
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, said the first efforts
to get congressional action on
jobs or money for the poor will
come from 100 leaders who will
meet with government figures
in Washington.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — The
FBI pressed one of the most
massive manhunts in its history
Thursday for shadowy Eric
Starvo Gait, charged in the snip

But little more was known
publicly about the alleged assas
sin of the civil rights leader
than when his name first arose
a week ago. It was learned,
however, that a man registered
as Eric S. Gait in a Memphis
motel a day before King was
killed.
Police agencies continued
their "no comment" handling of
queries — including questions
about a newspaper report that
the search had spread outside
the country, to Mexico or Cuba,
and were silent about a man
with whom Gait may have con
spired.

RAWALPINDI, Pakistan

"The only way the Viet

• Mortgage Rates Up
NEW YORK (AP)— Interest
rates on new home mortgages
are climbing toward 8 per cent
in some sections of the country,
a nationwide survey shows.
And the cost of an average
home has climbed about $2,500
in the past two years, according
to a survey by The Associated
Press.
Despite the higher costs, the
nation's homebuilders expect
this to be a good year. Probably,
they point out, because people
realize prices and interest rates
may go even higher.
The industry looks for 1968
to be better than last year. The
National Association of Home
Builders predicts 1.43 million
housing starts this year, up
from 1.3 million last year.
But whatever the number of
homes built, homo buyers will
pay more for their mortgage.
• Discount Rate Up
WASHINGTON (AP) — Th e
Federal Reserve Board Thurs
day approved another increase
in its discount rate, to s*£ per
cent, in a strong tightening of

credit throughout the economy.
The action applies to the New
York, Philadelphia and Minne
apolis Federal Reserve Banks
and is effective on Friday.
It was the second increase in
the discount rate in little more
than a month.
The board raised the rate
from 4Vfe to 5 per cent in mid-
March in an attempt to stem the
gold crisis which reached its cli
max in that month.
The board said it took the
"new action to restrain intensify
ing inflationary pressure and to
strengthen the position of the
dollar at home and abroad.

• Mortgage Rates Up
NEW YORK (AP)— Interest
rates on new home mortgages
are climbing toward 8 per cent
in some sections of the country,
a nationwide survey shows.
And the cost of an average
home has climbed about $2,500
in the past two years, according
to a survey by The Associated
Press.
Despite the higher costs, the
nation's homebuilders expect
this to be a good year. Probably,
they point out, because people
realize prices and interest rates
may go even higher.
The industry looks for 1968
to be better than last year. The
National Association of Home
Builders predicts 1.43 million
housing starts this year, up
from 1.3 million last year.
But whatever the number of
homes built, homo buyers will
pay more for their mortgage.

Thursday in their first nation

"The strike is on," said Jo

SAN ANTONIO, Tex. (AP) —
President Johnson said Thurs

The chief executive listed this

Hanoi and Washington have

ATLANTA, Ga. (AP) — The

Leaders said it would be con

Announced at a news confer

April 29 with some talks in
Washington and will culminate
with what was described as a
crusade of hundreds of thou
sands of demonstrators.
The Rev. Ralph Abernathy,
successor to King as head of the

Conference, said the first efforts
to get congressional action on
jobs or money for the poor will
come from 100 leaders who will
meet with government figures

But little more was known
publicly about the alleged assas

• Mortgage Rates Up
NEW YORK (AP)— Interest
rates on new home mortgages
are climbing toward 8 per cent
in some sections of the country,
a nationwide survey shows.
And the cost of an average
home has climbed about $2,500
in the past two years, according
to a survey by The Associated
Press.
Despite the higher costs, the
nation's homebuilders expect
this to be a good year. Probably,
they point out, because people
realize prices and interest rates
may go even higher.
The industry looks for 1968
to be better than last year. The
National Association of Home
Builders predicts 1.43 million
housing starts this year, up
from 1.3 million last year.
But whatever the number of
homes built, homo buyers will
pay more for their mortgage.
