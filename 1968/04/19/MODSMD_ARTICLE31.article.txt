# Improving Trackmen Face Battle With Unbeaten Troy
## 
### 
After putting forth its finest
1968 competitive effort in a los
ing cause against U.C.L.A. last
weekend, Stanford journeys
south to face a considerably
tougher U.S.C. contingent Sat
urday at 1:15 in the L.A. Coli
seum.
Stanford Coach Payton Jor
dan predicted that his Indians
had the potential to topple the
Bruins a week ago, and the hot
ly-contested meet that followed
made believers of his listeners.
As for this week's meet, says
Jordan, "Stanford is not in the
same class as U.S.C. this year,
but if they let up in several
events, they could well be in for
some surprises."
The Trojans are undefeated

In dual meet competition and
have scored over 90 points In
each of the four meets.
The only opponent common
to the Indians and the Trojans
to date is Occidental, who took
it on the chin by a 115-29 count
from Troy but only lost 85-60 to
Stanford. Heavy favorites to
successfully defend their NCAA
title, U.S.C. has won the last 31
dual meets against Stanford.
Last Saturday, the Indians
compiled 13 lifetime bests, and
the prime standouts were a trio
of seniors who were all in the
winner's circle.
Jim Ward ran a 46.9 in the
440, which was .7 seconds un
der his previous 1968 best;
Jim Letterer posted a 4:06.4

In the mile, and triple Juniper
lan Arnold upped his school
record to 50-2 in the triple
Jump.
Competing in his first varsity
competition, Tom Massey, a let
ter winner as a defensive back
for the football team, had fine
second-place efforts in both the
high jump (6-6) and the triple
jump (49-1 ). This Saturday,
he will also compete in the high
hurdles where he has a lifetime
best of 14.6.
The Trojans scored 86
points in winning: the NCAA
title last year and athletes ac
counting for 67 of those points
have returned.
Headlining the Troy cause are
the world record 440 relay team
(38.6)— Earl McCullouch, Fred
Kuller, O. J. Simpson, and Len
nox Miller—and Bob Seagren,
who has the world's best out
doors vault this year at 17-IY2.
Last week, McCullough went
13.4 in the high hurdles, and
Fred Kuller tied his lifetime
best in the century with a fine
9.3 clocking.
Not to be out done by the
varsity, the frosh track team
also compiled 13 lifetime bests
en route to a 91%-53% victory
over Santa Ana College, which
kept the Papooses' 1968 slate
clean.
Jim Kauffman erased the old
est frosh record on the books,
Ben Eastman's 48.2 mark set in
1930, with a 48.0 clocking. This
record - breaking performance
was only part of a busy after
noon for Jim, as he found time
to run in both winning relays
and win the long and triple
jumps and also compete in the
high jump.

1968 competitive effort in a los
ing cause against U.C.L.A. last
weekend, Stanford journeys
south to face a considerably
tougher U.S.C. contingent Sat
urday at 1:15 in the L.A. Coli
seum.
Stanford Coach Payton Jor
dan predicted that his Indians
had the potential to topple the
Bruins a week ago, and the hot
ly-contested meet that followed
made believers of his listeners.
As for this week's meet, says
Jordan, "Stanford is not in the
same class as U.S.C. this year,
but if they let up in several
events, they could well be in for
some surprises."
The Trojans are undefeated

In dual meet competition and
have scored over 90 points In
each of the four meets.
The only opponent common
to the Indians and the Trojans
to date is Occidental, who took
it on the chin by a 115-29 count
from Troy but only lost 85-60 to
Stanford. Heavy favorites to
successfully defend their NCAA
title, U.S.C. has won the last 31
dual meets against Stanford.
Last Saturday, the Indians
compiled 13 lifetime bests, and
the prime standouts were a trio
of seniors who were all in the
winner's circle.
Jim Ward ran a 46.9 in the
440, which was .7 seconds un
der his previous 1968 best;
Jim Letterer posted a 4:06.4

In the mile, and triple Juniper
lan Arnold upped his school
record to 50-2 in the triple
Jump.
Competing in his first varsity
competition, Tom Massey, a let
ter winner as a defensive back
for the football team, had fine
second-place efforts in both the
high jump (6-6) and the triple
jump (49-1 ). This Saturday,
he will also compete in the high
hurdles where he has a lifetime
best of 14.6.
The Trojans scored 86
points in winning: the NCAA
title last year and athletes ac
counting for 67 of those points
have returned.
Headlining the Troy cause are
the world record 440 relay team
(38.6)— Earl McCullouch, Fred
Kuller, O. J. Simpson, and Len
nox Miller—and Bob Seagren,
who has the world's best out
doors vault this year at 17-IY2.
Last week, McCullough went
13.4 in the high hurdles, and
Fred Kuller tied his lifetime
best in the century with a fine
9.3 clocking.
Not to be out done by the
varsity, the frosh track team
also compiled 13 lifetime bests
en route to a 91%-53% victory
over Santa Ana College, which
kept the Papooses' 1968 slate
clean.
Jim Kauffman erased the old
est frosh record on the books,
Ben Eastman's 48.2 mark set in
1930, with a 48.0 clocking. This
record - breaking performance
was only part of a busy after
noon for Jim, as he found time
to run in both winning relays
and win the long and triple
jumps and also compete in the
high jump.
