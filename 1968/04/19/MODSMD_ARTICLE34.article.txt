# Tribe Volleyballers Enter Far West Championships
## 
### 
The Stanford six-man volley
ball team, fresh off a fine show
ing and several upsets in the
Santa Barbara Collegiate Tour
nament, will play today in the
Far Western Championships.
The collegiate division will
start at 9 a.m. at Alameda Naval
Air Station in Oakland, with
the masters' and armed services'
divisions to follow at 5 p.m.
Should the Indians finish in
the top six on Friday, they will
qualify to play in the Open Div
ision on Saturday starting at
9 a.m. at the same site.
This tournament is perennial
ly one of the toughest in the
nation, since nearly all the top
volleyball is played in the Far
West. Several ex-Olympians and
ex-Pan American Games team
members will play Saturday, as
the open and college teams com
pete in the last crucial tourna
ment before the National Cham
pionships.
The Nationals and Olympic
Tryouts take place simultaneous
ly on May 8-11 in Portland, Ore
gon.
The Stanford team has beaten

nearly all the top contenders
in the collegiate division, as well
as nationally-ranked Olympic
Club of the open division.
Though sometimes plagued by
inconsistency, the Tribe has
worked hard in the past weeks
and hopes to put together a
topnotch performance this wek
end.
Team members making the
trip to Alameda are: Mike Stev
ens, Erik Reinholm, Jim Julian,
Jim Ingram, Jeff Pierose, Ernie
Banks, Bob Conrad, Chris Mc-
Lashlin, Mike Moore, Rocky
Laverty, and Montessa Burch.
Since virtually the same teams
compete in the Nationals Col
legiate Division, a high finish
for the Tribe at the Far West
erns could mean a national rank
ing as well as the possibility
of landing several All-Ameri
can nominations. All in all,
hopes are high for this weekend
as the Indians will try to knock
off the top three collegiate
teams, San Diego State, UCSB,
and Santa Monica City College.
