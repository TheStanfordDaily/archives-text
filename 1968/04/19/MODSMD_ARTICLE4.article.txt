# Payment Refusals To Be Challenged
## 
### JACK KAPLAN 
Dean of Students Joel Smith
has filed with the Interim Judi
cial Body (IJB) notice of inten
tion to appeal the student Judi
cial Council's decision which
stated that students no longer
have to pay Stanford parking
fines.
The Judicial Council refuses
to recognize the jurisdiction of
the IJB, an all-faculty body.
Smith told The Daily Wednes
day that the case raises again
the question of the council's dis
puted authority to invalidate
university regulations.
The council ruled last Friday
that the University cannot force
students to pay parking tickets
while it allows hundreds of fac
ulty and staff to ignore them.
In the past, students with

unpaid fines have been denied
permission to re-register, but
there has been no punishment
for delinquent faculty and
staff members.
Since September, over 800
tickets of 22.000 issued have
gone unpaid. Most of the 800
belong to faculty and staff.
Parking fines are $2 if paid
promptly. The money goes into
the University general fund.
Meanwhile, Vice-President for
Business Affairs Alf Brandin is
organizing meetings between
the business staff and the Dean
of Students office to discuss en
forcement of faculty-staff fines.
One alternative they are con
sidering is taking delinquent
ticket holders to court, accord
ing to Don Carlson, assistant di
rector of university relations.
