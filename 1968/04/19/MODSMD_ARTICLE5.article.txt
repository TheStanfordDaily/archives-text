# Population Problems Remain
## Fusion May Solve Energy Problems 
### JOHN ALCORN 
If the United States continues
using its petroleum resources
at the present rate, our native
supplies will be exhausted in
the next decade. Fortunately,
though, nuclear energy has
come to the rescue for man
kind," explained Dr. James L.
Tuck in a Century 21 talk last
night.
Tuck, who is from the Los
Alamos Laboratory, claimed that
potentially one cubic kilometer
of sea water will keep the United
States going at its present rate
of energy consumption for 100
years.
He pointed out, however, that
as immense as the technical
problems associated with extract
ing that amount of nuclear en
ergy are, a much more press
ing problem is the population
explosion. This is especially true
because as the number of peo
ple increase, "the per capita
consumption of energy increases

even more rapidly."
Tuck disagreed with those
who point to hydroelectric
power in the future. He said
that even with all the hydro
electric plants now operating;,
this form of energy only ac
counts for five per cent of the
amount we annually use.
He also discounted solar en
ergy because t"> achieve present
energy levels, "you'd need one
million square kilometers of
roofs."
The present form of creating
nuclear energy, fission also has
many drawbacks. Besides enor
mous cost projections, the ha
zard of loose radioactive ma
terial exists. "By the time there
are 100,000 fission plants in the
world, I wouldn't be surprised if
now or then one pops," he added.
There is also a tremendous
problem concerning waste dis
posal of nuclear material. While
Tuck did not care for the idea
of contaminating the oceans or

deserts, he also dismissed the
idea of "firing our nuclear gar
bage" off into space wrapped
up in cannisters.
The main hope for the fu
ture is nuclear fusion, which
unfortunately also possesses
the most challenging problems.
The major problem with fu
sion is that, in order to achieve
usable amounts of energy,
plasma must be super-heated

to 100 million degrees, and
our strongest metal, tungsten,
melts at 4000 degrees.
Tuck noted that he has been
working on practical methods
of fusion for seventeen years.
He has always thought that it
was a "noble" project. But
emphasized that "if this energy
is just going to let people pro
liferate in squalor, I'm against
it."
