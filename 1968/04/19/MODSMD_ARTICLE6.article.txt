# LASSU Resolution:
## Stanford Should Favor Firms Hiring Blacks 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
The student legislature pro
posed last night that the Univer
sity use its power as a major
purchaser in the Mid-Peninsula
area to encourage businesses to
hire more blacks.
The resolution on purchas
ing and contracting, drawn up
by political science students,
says "Stanford University
should use whatever influence
it can to encourage other eco
nomic organization to adopt
more positive policies toward
recruitment and training of
minority group members."
A two-part policy, enforced
by the new Human Rights Com
mission, would have the Univer
sity:
1. Refuse to deal with firms
or unions that discriminate in
hiring or promotions. If a busi
ness has fewer than 5 per cent
of its workers from minority
groups, it would be guilty of
de facto discrimination, unless
the Human Rights Commission
set other guidelines.
2. Show preference in pur
chasing supplies or in contract
ing construction work to firms
that have "aggressive policies
of minority group hiring, train
ing and promotion." This would
include accepting th 1 compoti

tive bid of a firm with good poli
cies even if the bid were not the
lowest offered.
The nine • member Human
Rights Commission of students
and faculty would circulate lists
of approved and "preferred"
businesses among University
management personnel.
The legislature thus added its
support to a proposal favored
by many students and faculty,
including some future members
of the Human Rights Commis
sion. Adoption of the policy
would require approval by the
President and Board of Trus
tees.
In other business, the legisla
ture voiced its support for the
20 medical students threatened
with expulsion if they continue
to refuse to sign their examina
tions in a community health
course fall quarter. The stu
dents demanded that the course
be made optional and be im
proved in content.
The legislature urged the
medical school "not to threaten
the students involved with ex
pulsion or suspension, and to
take meaningful and effective
measures to bring about im
provement in the course in ques
tion."
"Formal mechanisms" should

be set up for curriculum reform,
the resolution said, so medical
students can seek changes with
out protest actions.
Earlier the Political Science
Graduate Student Association
passed an identical resolution.
Last night the local chapter of
the American Federation of
Teachers union added its sup
port to the medical students,
threatening "appropriate action
if their demands are not met."
Approves Judicial Reform
In closed session the legisla
ture heard a report on new judi
cial structures under considera
tion by the Committee of Fif
teen, a negotiating group of
students, faculty and adminis
trators. Afterwards the legisla
ture passed a resolution approv
ing the plans now before the
Committee.
Committee of Fifteen member
John Raskin said the details of
the group's proposals to Presi
dent Wallace Sterling won't be
made public until the Committee
of Fifteen completes work on
some details.
Judicial matters also came be
fore the legislature in the form
of an "ASSU Policy on Law and
Order." It was passed to allow
the student judicial council to
hear cases involving protest
demonstrations. Previously the
council couldn't, because it had
declared the University's demon
strations policy unconstitutional.
The resolution says it is a
"violation of ASSU policy" to
cause physical harm to any oth
er person, destroy property, pre
vent access to any place by a
person who has "legal right of
access," or make "substantial in
terference with the possession
or with the beneficial use and
enjoyment of private resident
ial property."
The legislature also passed
three money appropriations
which reduced its remaining free
funds to $314. The first of these
was $178 to help finance ASSU
presidential elections in May.

of approved and "preferred"
businesses among University
management personnel.
The legislature thus added its
support to a proposal favored
by many students and faculty,
including some future members
of the Human Rights Commis
sion. Adoption of the policy
would require approval by the
President and Board of Trus
tees.
In other business, the legisla
ture voiced its support for the
20 medical students threatened
with expulsion if they continue
to refuse to sign their examina
tions in a community health
course fall quarter. The stu
dents demanded that the course
be made optional and be im
proved in content.
The legislature urged the
medical school "not to threaten
the students involved with ex
pulsion or suspension, and to
take meaningful and effective
measures to bring about im
provement in the course in ques
tion."
"Formal mechanisms" should

be set up for curriculum reform,
the resolution said, so medical
students can seek changes with
out protest actions.
Earlier the Political Science
Graduate Student Association
passed an identical resolution.
Last night the local chapter of
the American Federation of
Teachers union added its sup
port to the medical students,
threatening "appropriate action
if their demands are not met."
Approves Judicial Reform
In closed session the legisla
ture heard a report on new judi
cial structures under considera
tion by the Committee of Fif
teen, a negotiating group of
students, faculty and adminis
trators. Afterwards the legisla
ture passed a resolution approv
ing the plans now before the
Committee.
Committee of Fifteen member
John Raskin said the details of
the group's proposals to Presi
dent Wallace Sterling won't be
made public until the Committee
of Fifteen completes work on
some details.
Judicial matters also came be
fore the legislature in the form
of an "ASSU Policy on Law and
Order." It was passed to allow
the student judicial council to
hear cases involving protest
demonstrations. Previously the
council couldn't, because it had
declared the University's demon
strations policy unconstitutional.
The resolution says it is a
"violation of ASSU policy" to
cause physical harm to any oth
er person, destroy property, pre
vent access to any place by a
person who has "legal right of
access," or make "substantial in
terference with the possession
or with the beneficial use and
enjoyment of private resident
ial property."
The legislature also passed
three money appropriations
which reduced its remaining free
funds to $314. The first of these
was $178 to help finance ASSU
presidential elections in May.
The student legislature pro
posed last night that the Univer
sity use its power as a major
purchaser in the Mid-Peninsula
area to encourage businesses to
hire more blacks.
The resolution on purchas
ing and contracting, drawn up
by political science students,
says "Stanford University
should use whatever influence
it can to encourage other eco
nomic organization to adopt
more positive policies toward
recruitment and training of
minority group members."
A two-part policy, enforced
by the new Human Rights Com
mission, would have the Univer
sity:
1. Refuse to deal with firms
or unions that discriminate in
hiring or promotions. If a busi
ness has fewer than 5 per cent
of its workers from minority
groups, it would be guilty of
de facto discrimination, unless
the Human Rights Commission
set other guidelines.
2. Show preference in pur
chasing supplies or in contract
ing construction work to firms
that have "aggressive policies
of minority group hiring, train
ing and promotion." This would
include accepting th 1 compoti

tive bid of a firm with good poli
cies even if the bid were not the
lowest offered.
