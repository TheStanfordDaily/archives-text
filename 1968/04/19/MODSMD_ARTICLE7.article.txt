# Former Provost Promotes Business-University Ties
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
In 1636 John Harvard had an
idea. Three hundred and thirty
six years later big business in
America is developing the same
idea and is giving university
business ties a major new
twist led by a man at Stanford.
Across the country in Texas,
New Jersey, and Oregon, indus
try is taking the initiative in
money and action to strengthen
existing universities and is even
planning to build new schools.
The man they often turn to
for ideas and planning is Fred
erick E. Terman, Stanford pro
vost emeritus, who shows only
one trace of being emeritus:
gray hair. In every other way
he is synonmous with energy
and initiative in education-busi
ness relations around the coun
try.
He is president of a founda
tion established by Dallas-Fort
Worth industries to spark and
help finance improvements in
the engineering division at
Southern Methodist University.
These industries are seeking to
create a high quality training
ground for skilled personnel and
a center of leading research.
In New Jersey Terman has
developed tentative plans for
establishing a graduate univer
sity sponsored by a group of
corporations, much as if the

Stanford industrial park were
to give birth to Stanford Uni
versity.
Paradoxically, it was Terman
who lead the development of
the multi-million dollar Stanford
industrial park during the last
decade.
Terman, who retired in 1965
after 10 years as Provost and
10 years as Dean of Engineer
ing, has also just completed a
report for the State of Califor
nia on the condition of engi
neering education in state
schools and colleges.
When he stops for a moment
these days to chat, his mind
bubbles with ideas about busi
ness and education and with
equal ease he speaks of recur
ring trends in educational re
form, trends he has watched
in cycle since he settled at Stan
ford in 1912.
A trend he has not watched
recur, is the innovative move
ment he's leading on business
sponsorship of university de
partments and business-sponsor
ed universities.
His work in the Dallas-Fort
Worth area is an example. Tra
ditionally many centers of in
dustry have developed around
high-grade universities, such as

Stanford industrial park and
the electronic complexes on
Route 128 circling Harvard and
MIT.
In the Dallas-Fort Worth case,
many high powered industries,
led by Texas Instruments, felt
the need for an equally high
powered university engineering
division in the area. They turn
ed to Southern Methodist Uni
versity.
The corporations created a
foundation, appointed Terman
President, and rapidly worked
to vitalize egnineering at SMU.
Last June SMU graduated its
first Ph.D. in engineering. This
coming June the number of
Ph.D.s will increase to 10 and
the following year will reach
15 or 20.
In New Jersey the industries
would like to begin from
scratch. Terman says, "There
are a group of companies spread
about a large area in the north
ern part of the state. Ifs an
educational desert and these
firms want a high quality grad
uate university in the area."
Bell Telephone Laboratories
and ESSO are leading the drive,
which seems temporarily stalled.
The area has the highest num
