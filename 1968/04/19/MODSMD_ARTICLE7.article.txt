# Former Provost Promotes Business-University Ties
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
In 1636 John Harvard had an
idea. Three hundred and thirty
six years later big business in
America is developing the same
idea and is giving university
business ties a major new
twist led by a man at Stanford.
Across the country in Texas,
New Jersey, and Oregon, indus
try is taking the initiative in
money and action to strengthen
existing universities and is even
planning to build new schools.
The man they often turn to
for ideas and planning is Fred
erick E. Terman, Stanford pro
vost emeritus, who shows only
one trace of being emeritus:
gray hair. In every other way
he is synonmous with energy
and initiative in education-busi
ness relations around the coun
try.
He is president of a founda
tion established by Dallas-Fort
Worth industries to spark and
help finance improvements in
the engineering division at
Southern Methodist University.
These industries are seeking to
create a high quality training
ground for skilled personnel and
a center of leading research.
In New Jersey Terman has
developed tentative plans for
establishing a graduate univer
sity sponsored by a group of
corporations, much as if the

Stanford industrial park were
to give birth to Stanford Uni
versity.
Paradoxically, it was Terman
who lead the development of
the multi-million dollar Stanford
industrial park during the last
decade.
Terman, who retired in 1965
after 10 years as Provost and
10 years as Dean of Engineer
ing, has also just completed a
report for the State of Califor
nia on the condition of engi
neering education in state
schools and colleges.
When he stops for a moment
these days to chat, his mind
bubbles with ideas about busi
ness and education and with
equal ease he speaks of recur
ring trends in educational re
form, trends he has watched
in cycle since he settled at Stan
ford in 1912.
A trend he has not watched
recur, is the innovative move
ment he's leading on business
sponsorship of university de
partments and business-sponsor
ed universities.
His work in the Dallas-Fort
Worth area is an example. Tra
ditionally many centers of in
dustry have developed around
high-grade universities, such as

Stanford industrial park and
the electronic complexes on
Route 128 circling Harvard and
MIT.
In the Dallas-Fort Worth case,
many high powered industries,
led by Texas Instruments, felt
the need for an equally high
powered university engineering
division in the area. They turn
ed to Southern Methodist Uni
versity.
The corporations created a
foundation, appointed Terman
President, and rapidly worked
to vitalize egnineering at SMU.
Last June SMU graduated its
first Ph.D. in engineering. This
coming June the number of
Ph.D.s will increase to 10 and
the following year will reach
15 or 20.
In New Jersey the industries
would like to begin from
scratch. Terman says, "There
are a group of companies spread
about a large area in the north
ern part of the state. Ifs an
educational desert and these
firms want a high quality grad
uate university in the area."
Bell Telephone Laboratories
and ESSO are leading the drive,
which seems temporarily stalled.
The area has the highest num

ber of business supported re
search labs in the country.
Terman feels this new twist
in the business-education rela
tionship will lead to mutual
prosperity. Universities can sup
ply industries with a valuable
source of manpower and finely
tuned centers of research, and
even more importantly, they
give an industrial area an at
mosphere that attracts highly
skilled personnel.
In turn, Terman says a busi
ness complex can provide uni
versities with an outlet for ideas
and professional contacts for
faculty members. Companies
can provide fellowship funds
and can add to the stimulating
atmosphere in communities.
Though leading sweeping in
novations, Terman remains alert
to smaller, less significant de
velopments in education and
feels much reform in higher ed
ucation is a repeat of past re
visions.
Terman sees cycles of about
50 years. He says,"It takes one
generation to forget and one to
reinvent what was forgotten."
He points, with a wry smile,
to examples such as pass/fail
grading, independent study, and
overseas education. When Stan
ford opened in 1891, Terman
notes, it had a pass/fail grading
system. This soon led professors
writing short notes on student
performance, but this system
created hazards for record keep
ing, and grades were instituted
about 1908.
Terman strongly believes it is
difficult to invent new ideas in
education. With a sparkle in his
eye, he speaks of education as
a 3000 year old institution.
'Take study abroad. The Ro
mans used to send theft sons
to Greece for polishing and later
the British sent their children
on the Continental tour."
A late sexagenarian, Terman
thinks educators have searched
for years to find some magical
combination to set undergrad
uates on fire and keep them
ablaze.
Though unacquainted with
specific developments about co
ed living, Terman correctly sug
gested that Grove House might
be less exciting than it was last
year. He cites the Hawthorne
Effect as the source of this

guess.
In short, the Hawthorne Effect
shows that people like to be
the center of attention and when
they are, their productivity will
increase. Now that Grove has
been removed from the spot
light, Terman figures "the zest
must be vanishing."
Out of the spotlight himself,
Terman seems to nullify the
whole Hawthorne thesis. He
stands over six feet and seems
in excellent health. His office
buzzes with activity and visit
ors, and he's off to Dallas, Wash
ington, Los Ariegles and Sacra
mento this month. In June?

the engineering division at
Southern Methodist University.
These industries are seeking to
create a high quality training
ground for skilled personnel and
a center of leading research.
In New Jersey Terman has
developed tentative plans for
establishing a graduate univer
sity sponsored by a group of
corporations, much as if the

Stanford industrial park were
to give birth to Stanford Uni
versity.
Paradoxically, it was Terman
who lead the development of
the multi-million dollar Stanford
industrial park during the last
decade.
Terman, who retired in 1965
after 10 years as Provost and
10 years as Dean of Engineer
ing, has also just completed a
report for the State of Califor
nia on the condition of engi
neering education in state
schools and colleges.
When he stops for a moment
these days to chat, his mind
bubbles with ideas about busi
ness and education and with
equal ease he speaks of recur
ring trends in educational re
form, trends he has watched
in cycle since he settled at Stan
ford in 1912.
A trend he has not watched
recur, is the innovative move
ment he's leading on business
sponsorship of university de
partments and business-sponsor
ed universities.
His work in the Dallas-Fort
Worth area is an example. Tra
ditionally many centers of in
dustry have developed around
high-grade universities, such as

Stanford industrial park and
the electronic complexes on
Route 128 circling Harvard and
MIT.
In the Dallas-Fort Worth case,
many high powered industries,
led by Texas Instruments, felt
the need for an equally high
powered university engineering
division in the area. They turn
ed to Southern Methodist Uni
versity.
The corporations created a
foundation, appointed Terman
President, and rapidly worked
to vitalize egnineering at SMU.
Last June SMU graduated its
first Ph.D. in engineering. This
coming June the number of
Ph.D.s will increase to 10 and
the following year will reach
15 or 20.
In New Jersey the industries
would like to begin from
scratch. Terman says, "There
are a group of companies spread
about a large area in the north
ern part of the state. Ifs an
educational desert and these
firms want a high quality grad
uate university in the area."

ber of business supported re
search labs in the country.
Terman feels this new twist
in the business-education rela
tionship will lead to mutual
prosperity. Universities can sup
ply industries with a valuable
source of manpower and finely
tuned centers of research, and
even more importantly, they
give an industrial area an at
mosphere that attracts highly
skilled personnel.
In turn, Terman says a busi
ness complex can provide uni
versities with an outlet for ideas
and professional contacts for
faculty members. Companies
can provide fellowship funds
and can add to the stimulating
atmosphere in communities.
Though leading sweeping in
novations, Terman remains alert
to smaller, less significant de
velopments in education and
feels much reform in higher ed
ucation is a repeat of past re
visions.
Terman sees cycles of about
50 years. He says,"It takes one
generation to forget and one to
reinvent what was forgotten."
He points, with a wry smile,
to examples such as pass/fail
grading, independent study, and
overseas education. When Stan
ford opened in 1891, Terman
notes, it had a pass/fail grading
system. This soon led professors
writing short notes on student
performance, but this system
created hazards for record keep
ing, and grades were instituted
about 1908.
Terman strongly believes it is
difficult to invent new ideas in
education. With a sparkle in his
eye, he speaks of education as
a 3000 year old institution.
'Take study abroad. The Ro
mans used to send theft sons
to Greece for polishing and later
the British sent their children
on the Continental tour."
A late sexagenarian, Terman
thinks educators have searched
for years to find some magical
combination to set undergrad
uates on fire and keep them
ablaze.
Though unacquainted with
specific developments about co
ed living, Terman correctly sug
gested that Grove House might
be less exciting than it was last
year. He cites the Hawthorne
Effect as the source of this

guess.
In short, the Hawthorne Effect
shows that people like to be
the center of attention and when
they are, their productivity will
increase. Now that Grove has
been removed from the spot
light, Terman figures "the zest
must be vanishing."
Out of the spotlight himself,
Terman seems to nullify the
whole Hawthorne thesis. He
stands over six feet and seems
in excellent health. His office
buzzes with activity and visit
ors, and he's off to Dallas, Wash
ington, Los Ariegles and Sacra
mento this month. In June?

In 1636 John Harvard had an
idea. Three hundred and thirty
six years later big business in
America is developing the same
idea and is giving university
business ties a major new
twist led by a man at Stanford.
Across the country in Texas,
New Jersey, and Oregon, indus

money and action to strengthen
existing universities and is even

The man they often turn to

one trace of being emeritus:

he is synonmous with energy

bubbles with ideas about busi
ness and education and with
equal ease he speaks of recur
ring trends in educational re
form, trends he has watched
in cycle since he settled at Stan
ford in 1912.
A trend he has not watched
recur, is the innovative move
ment he's leading on business
sponsorship of university de
partments and business-sponsor
ed universities.
His work in the Dallas-Fort
Worth area is an example. Tra
ditionally many centers of in
dustry have developed around
high-grade universities, such as

Stanford industrial park and
the electronic complexes on
Route 128 circling Harvard and
MIT.
In the Dallas-Fort Worth case,
many high powered industries,
led by Texas Instruments, felt
the need for an equally high
powered university engineering
division in the area. They turn
ed to Southern Methodist Uni
versity.
The corporations created a
foundation, appointed Terman
President, and rapidly worked
to vitalize egnineering at SMU.
Last June SMU graduated its
first Ph.D. in engineering. This
coming June the number of
Ph.D.s will increase to 10 and
the following year will reach
15 or 20.
In New Jersey the industries
would like to begin from
scratch. Terman says, "There
are a group of companies spread
about a large area in the north
ern part of the state. Ifs an
educational desert and these
firms want a high quality grad
uate university in the area."

ber of business supported re
search labs in the country.
Terman feels this new twist
in the business-education rela
tionship will lead to mutual
prosperity. Universities can sup
ply industries with a valuable
source of manpower and finely
tuned centers of research, and
even more importantly, they
give an industrial area an at
mosphere that attracts highly
skilled personnel.
In turn, Terman says a busi
ness complex can provide uni
versities with an outlet for ideas
and professional contacts for
faculty members. Companies
can provide fellowship funds
and can add to the stimulating
atmosphere in communities.
Though leading sweeping in
novations, Terman remains alert
to smaller, less significant de
velopments in education and
feels much reform in higher ed
ucation is a repeat of past re
visions.
Terman sees cycles of about
50 years. He says,"It takes one
generation to forget and one to
reinvent what was forgotten."
He points, with a wry smile,
to examples such as pass/fail
grading, independent study, and
overseas education. When Stan
ford opened in 1891, Terman
notes, it had a pass/fail grading
system. This soon led professors
writing short notes on student
performance, but this system
created hazards for record keep
ing, and grades were instituted
about 1908.
Terman strongly believes it is
difficult to invent new ideas in
education. With a sparkle in his
eye, he speaks of education as
a 3000 year old institution.
'Take study abroad. The Ro
mans used to send theft sons
to Greece for polishing and later
the British sent their children
on the Continental tour."
A late sexagenarian, Terman
thinks educators have searched
for years to find some magical
combination to set undergrad
uates on fire and keep them
ablaze.
Though unacquainted with
specific developments about co
ed living, Terman correctly sug
gested that Grove House might
be less exciting than it was last
year. He cites the Hawthorne
Effect as the source of this

guess.
In short, the Hawthorne Effect
shows that people like to be
the center of attention and when
they are, their productivity will
increase. Now that Grove has
been removed from the spot
light, Terman figures "the zest
must be vanishing."
Out of the spotlight himself,
Terman seems to nullify the
whole Hawthorne thesis. He
stands over six feet and seems
in excellent health. His office
buzzes with activity and visit
ors, and he's off to Dallas, Wash
ington, Los Ariegles and Sacra
mento this month. In June?

In 1636 John Harvard had an
idea. Three hundred and thirty
six years later big business in
America is developing the same
idea and is giving university
business ties a major new
twist led by a man at Stanford.
Across the country in Texas,
New Jersey, and Oregon, indus
try is taking the initiative in
money and action to strengthen
existing universities and is even
planning to build new schools.
The man they often turn to
for ideas and planning is Fred
erick E. Terman, Stanford pro
vost emeritus, who shows only
one trace of being emeritus:
gray hair. In every other way
he is synonmous with energy
and initiative in education-busi
ness relations around the coun
try.
He is president of a founda
tion established by Dallas-Fort
Worth industries to spark and
help finance improvements in
the engineering division at
Southern Methodist University.
These industries are seeking to
create a high quality training
ground for skilled personnel and
a center of leading research.
In New Jersey Terman has
developed tentative plans for
establishing a graduate univer
sity sponsored by a group of
corporations, much as if the

Stanford industrial park were
to give birth to Stanford Uni
versity.
Paradoxically, it was Terman
who lead the development of
the multi-million dollar Stanford
industrial park during the last
decade.
Terman, who retired in 1965
after 10 years as Provost and
10 years as Dean of Engineer
ing, has also just completed a
report for the State of Califor
nia on the condition of engi
neering education in state
schools and colleges.
