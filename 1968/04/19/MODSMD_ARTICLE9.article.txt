Community For Relevant Education (CRE) is Mickey Mouse,
apple pie, and an ice cream sundae on a sunny afternoon. Add a
little national service, "meaningful personal interaction," a wide
smile and you're three-quarters of the way to "building the
earth."
Using group dynamic techniques, CRE has streamlined a
group of concerned students, who really want to see positive
change, into a malleable work force susceptible to persuasive
"go-get-em" jargon.
Unfortunately, the potential for personal interaction is thwart
ed — CRE whittles away personality for unanimity. The em
phasis on the group leader and on experiencing some "truth"
aborts any value the groups might have.
Its national service program devoted to shifting the emphasis
of society from military and war to peace and brotherhood, por
tends universal conscription and the end to the voluntary nature
of social service.
It is unfortunate that CRE has chosen national service as its
project. The manpower and money in CRE and its positivism are
prerequisites for social change — but they may find themselves
short-changed. A voluntary military supplemented by a revital
ized voluntary community action program would surely be a
more constructive end.
CRE should seriously examine where it is going and set realistic
goals.
