Join United's 12-21 Club and escape to almost anywhere,
almost any time, at half-fare. When you fly 12-21 style you
can't reserve a seat, but you can get away from it all at
half-fare when space is available. Because United has more seats
to more places than anyone else, there's a better chance
you'll be in one of those seats.
It's easy to join. Stop in at any United office,
be under 22 and bring proof, slip us $3.00, and you're in.
Make sense?
Make tracks!
