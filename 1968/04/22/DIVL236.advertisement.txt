A Look At The Issues
Kennedy or McCarthy?
MM'-■?*?- /•K„ w, Mwwmh&M.
Many have said that the race between Senators Robert Kennedy and
Eugene McCarthy is a matter of personality—not issues. We disagree.
There are significant differences in the public records of the two men.
The Americans for Democratic Action in January gave Senator McCarthy
a 62 percent liberal rating for his Senate record last year on 13 selected
issues.° Senator Kennedy received a 100 percent rating.
Below we furnish an analysis based on research in the Congressional
Record, Congressional Quarterly and published works and statements of
the two candidates.
