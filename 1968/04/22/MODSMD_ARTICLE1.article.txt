# Frats Weigh Joint Action
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Stanford fraternities will con
sider proposals this week to
make a joint statement de
manding that their national or
ganizations renounce any racial
discrimination in membership.
At house meetings tonight and
morrow night the 24 fraternities
will discuss various statements
presented to the Inter-Frater
nity Council (IFC) April 18.
If enough houses concur, a pol
icy will be adopted at a meet
ing next Thursday.
Already the IFC has pledged
$1,000 to the Martin Luther
King Jr. Memorial Fund, do
nating $300 of Its operating
budget and asking individual,'
houses to contribute the re
maining $700.
All these actions are the re
sult of a widespread concern in
fraternities over racial injus
tice since the King assassina
tion, paralleling the desire for
change in the entire University.
The actions range from the
contributions to the King fund
to formal denials of discrimina
tory policy to proposals for seek
ing out minority group students
as members.
House presidents will present
two statements to members for
their consideration before the
IFC meeting. One comes from
the Alpha Sigma Phi house, ad
vocating an insistence by local
chapters that their nationals re
nounce discrimination.
Alpha Slg president Mich
ael Green says the house sent
such a proposed statement to
500 local alumni April 12.
Since then the responses have
been "ten to one" In favor, saya
Green, but the almnl also want
the Stanford chapter not to
disaffiliate from the national
If possible.
The suggestion of a demand
to nationals for a nondiscrimina
tion statement was first made
by Prof. David Abernethy at the

All-Campus Colloquium in Me
morial Auditorium April 8. The
next day, Theta Delta Chi en
dorsed Abernethy's proposal,
pointing out that its national
made such a statement in 1948.
IFC president Michael Quinn
says the 24 Stanford fraternities
have "24 different problems" on
the issue of the nationals' pol
icy, because of "diplomacy to
ward their alumni" and other
considerations.
The other statement being
considered by the fraternities
was made by Kappa Sigma
president Michael Cooper at the
IFC meeting. Besides expressing
a "commitment to the policies
of non-discrimination ... in our
rush activities," Kappa Sigma
proposed "positive action" by
Stanford fraternities to gain
members from minority groups.
"A statement against discri
mination is hollow unless It
Is backed up by action," Coop
er says.
As a first step Kappa Sigma
will invite minority group stu
dents to fill vacancies in the
house, and encourage other
houses with empty spaces to
make a special effort to get mi
nority group students to fill
them. Cooper says this could
be a short cut to the normal
procedures of selective rush.
The fraternities should "show
the black community we really
want them to be in our house,"
Cooper says. This could involve
working through the Black Stu
dent Union or other groups or
some kind of direct publicity.
"We have to go to them," he
says.
Both the Alpha Sigs and
Kappa Sigs will discuss their
racial policies at house meet
ings tonight.
Another fraternity deeply in
volved in racial questions is Phi
Delta Theta. Last weekend the
Phi Delts sponsored a benefit
party for the Martin Luther
King Memorial Fund.

Stanford fraternities to gain
members from minority groups.
"A statement against discri
mination is hollow unless It
Is backed up by action," Coop
er says.
As a first step Kappa Sigma
will invite minority group stu
dents to fill vacancies in the
house, and encourage other
houses with empty spaces to
make a special effort to get mi
nority group students to fill
them. Cooper says this could
be a short cut to the normal
procedures of selective rush.
The fraternities should "show
the black community we really
want them to be in our house,"
Cooper says. This could involve
working through the Black Stu
dent Union or other groups or
some kind of direct publicity.
"We have to go to them," he
says.
Both the Alpha Sigs and
Kappa Sigs will discuss their
racial policies at house meet
ings tonight.
Another fraternity deeply in
volved in racial questions is Phi
Delta Theta. Last weekend the
Phi Delts sponsored a benefit
party for the Martin Luther

first open house for women last night. Here one of the brothers

Stanford fraternities will con
sider proposals this week to
make a joint statement de
manding that their national or
ganizations renounce any racial
discrimination in membership.
At house meetings tonight and
morrow night the 24 fraternities
will discuss various statements
presented to the Inter-Frater
nity Council (IFC) April 18.
If enough houses concur, a pol
icy will be adopted at a meet
ing next Thursday.
Already the IFC has pledged
$1,000 to the Martin Luther
King Jr. Memorial Fund, do
nating $300 of Its operating
budget and asking individual,'
houses to contribute the re
maining $700.
All these actions are the re
sult of a widespread concern in
fraternities over racial injus
tice since the King assassina
tion, paralleling the desire for
change in the entire University.
The actions range from the
contributions to the King fund
to formal denials of discrimina
tory policy to proposals for seek
ing out minority group students
as members.
House presidents will present
two statements to members for
their consideration before the
IFC meeting. One comes from
the Alpha Sigma Phi house, ad
vocating an insistence by local
chapters that their nationals re
nounce discrimination.
Alpha Slg president Mich
ael Green says the house sent
such a proposed statement to
500 local alumni April 12.
Since then the responses have
been "ten to one" In favor, saya
Green, but the almnl also want
the Stanford chapter not to
disaffiliate from the national
If possible.
The suggestion of a demand
to nationals for a nondiscrimina
tion statement was first made
by Prof. David Abernethy at the

All-Campus Colloquium in Me
morial Auditorium April 8. The
next day, Theta Delta Chi en
dorsed Abernethy's proposal,
pointing out that its national
made such a statement in 1948.
IFC president Michael Quinn
says the 24 Stanford fraternities
have "24 different problems" on
the issue of the nationals' pol
icy, because of "diplomacy to
ward their alumni" and other
considerations.
The other statement being
considered by the fraternities
was made by Kappa Sigma
president Michael Cooper at the
IFC meeting. Besides expressing
a "commitment to the policies
of non-discrimination ... in our
rush activities," Kappa Sigma
proposed "positive action" by
Stanford fraternities to gain
members from minority groups.
"A statement against discri
mination is hollow unless It
Is backed up by action," Coop
er says.
