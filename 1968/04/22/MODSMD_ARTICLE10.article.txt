## King Fund Appeal Is Buck Passing 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The letter from The Student
Development Committee on The
Martin Luther King Fund is a
classic example of passing the
buck: those of us connected
with the University should chip
in to support the fund, while
the University spends its own
money on more important things
— like basketball pavilions and
four-lane highways.
Sending this letter to students
shows special hypocrisy: "You
started this uproar, now pay for
it."
The letter says, "Priorities
are being re-allocated to provide
some support money, but this
cannot come near to meeting
the cost." What priorities? The
University has shown no evi
dence that it is prepared to
deal creatively with the problem;
it is not accepting its share of
the jog. To quote Lyman, "The
institution that does not accept
its share of the job will suffer
the fate of the impotent and
the irrelevant."

Gilmore Says BSU
Owes Jordan Apology
Editor, The Daily:
Wednesday noon I attended
one of the "Afro-American Cul
ture Week" activities, a discus
sion of "the black athlete" by
Mr. Payton Jordan and Mr.
Harry Edwards.
I wish to express my displea
sure at the manner in which
this activity was contrived by
the Black Student Union as a
vehicle for the vilification of a

Stanford faculty member. Mr.
Jordan responded affirmatively
to a letter requesting him to
speak at this activity — no men
tion of Mr. Edward's participa
tion being included in this let
ter. After Mr. Jordan had ac
cepted the speaking engage
ment, he was informed that Mr.
Edwards would also be on the
program.
In his presentations, Mr. Jor
dan gave his impressions and
feelings about the black athletes
he has known, seen, and admir
ed in his 30 years of experience
in the field of athletics. Mr. Ed
wards then launched one of the
most vicious personal attacks
on a co-speaker which I have
ever heard. He violated, by his
speech and by his behavior dur
ing Jordan's talk, all rules of
gentlemanly conduct which I
would expect from any intelli
gent man in a leadership role.
The Black Student Union mod
erators appeared delighted at
their success as Mr. Edwards,
conveniently following Mr. Jor
dan, made his slanderous accu
sations.
What Mr. Edwards had to say
about white society's treatment
of black society is most certain
ly true, but his tirade against
Mr. Jordan was uncalled for and
was demeaning to both Jordan
and himself, I believe also that
Edwards demonstrates a reverse
racism when he judges all of us
"white racists" forever con
demned to hell for our societal
guilt, and implies that nothing
we do now can ever change that
judgment. While Edward's de
mands that we treat him (black
people) as a human being, he
publicly demonstrates himself
as a very ungentlemanly, very
unhuman being.
I respect the things he said
about white society's treatment
of black people, because they
are embarrassingly true, but I
cannot respect him as a man —
as a human being — when he
doesn't act like one.
I believe that I am not a
racist ,and that I have not in
dividually so acted in any in
stance. I am willing to lend my
efforts at changing our society
to a totally human one, and ask
for specific, rational direction
in this regard. But I must ad
mit that I hesitate to invite any
man, whatever color, into my
home, and expose my family to
him, who does not demonstrate
to me and my family the respect
which he desires us to show to
him.
In being so unhuman and in
sulting to Payton Jordan, Harry
Edwards was also unhuman and
insulting to me. As I am ex
pected to accept responsibility
for the actions of white society,
I believe that Black Student
Union members must so accept
responsibility for Harry Ed
ward's demeanor. I will be dis
appointed in BSU members as
human beings if they fail to
make some apology to Mr. Jor
dan for his treatment by Mr.
Edwards.
I wish Mr. Edwards luck in
his non-violent efforts to change
both white and black societies
to more human ones. I hope
that his own humanness will
emerge in the process!
