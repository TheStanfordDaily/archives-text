# Frats, Blacks

### 
Stanford's 24 fraternities arc now considering joint action to
end the lingering impression that they favor de facto racial dis
crimination in their membership.
At the Inter-fraternity Council meeting Thursday, they will con
sider a statement reaffirming the local chapters' nondiscrimination
and asking the national fraternity organizations to make similar
disavowals of any racial prejudice in selecting members.
Prof. David Abernethy proposed such action at the tumultuous
colloquium in Memorial Auditorium April 8. Theta Delta Chi and
Alpha Sigma Phi in particular have urged the other fraternities
to join in such a statement. Clearly, it is the least the fraternities
can do.
Some fraternity men, such as Kappa Sigma's Mike Cooper, want
to go farther. "We can't just make a statement that we don't dis
criminate and wait for blacks to come up to rush," Cooper says.
"We have to show we really want them to be in our house." He
wants fraternities to immediately fill any vacancies with boarders
from minority groups, and to take "positive action" to get minority
group students interested in future fraternity rushing.
Stanford will increase black and brown enrollment by 150 over
the next year. Do fraternities really want a significant proportion of
these students moving into their houses? It will require more than a
sincere welcomeâ€”black students must feel the differences in race,
cultural background and social philosophy between themselves
and whites will not be a barrier to a friendly, stimulating living
arrangement. Blacks won't come into a fraternity on the fraternity's
terms.
With the upsurge of black militancy and cultural awareness, "in
tegration" seems more and more dubious as a realistic social goal.
Can fraternities, traditionally the bastions of social conservatism,
make the neormous changes in attitude needed to make integration
a success? We believe they can at Stanford, if they want to.
