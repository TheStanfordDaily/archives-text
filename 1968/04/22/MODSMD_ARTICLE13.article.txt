# Listen To Those 20 Med Students
## 
### 
The recent threat to throw 20 medical students out of school
for making trouble over what they considered a third-rate course
seems odd when viewed next to the usually progressive educa
tional philosophy for which the Medical School is justly admired.
For example, the Medical School intends by next fall to rede
fine its "core" curriculum to give students more freedom of choice
in their course work. Students will soon, it is hoped, be designing
highly individualized study plans in consultation with faculty
advisers. Traditional distinctions of first, second, third, fourth, and
fifth-year students will be abolished. The grading system is already
honors-pass-fail.
We only wish undergraduate programs were so good.
But how do students fit into all this planning? No formal mech
anism now exists for students to take a real part in improving or
exaluating their curriculum. The new one-shot committee to rede
fine the required curriculum will have only two non-voting stu
dent members and a contemplated medical Faculty senate may
have a few voting students.
Limited student roles still do not give students a voice in specific
curricular matters. And neither of these bodies would give the
20 medical students a part in dealing with the question they have
raised.
The medical students presently have one demand—that "Com
munity Health (PMD 301)" (which deals almost exclusively with
epidemics) not be passed on to next year's class without im
provement.
Last quarter, Dean Robert Glaser did allow the students to set
up an elective course to cover the other important elements of
community health, including alcoholism, drug addiction, and
smoking. But the students feel that these topics should be part of
a required community health course—not an elective course thai
has to be set up by students.
The Medical School has replied that Community Health will
be reviewed by the ad-hoc curriculum committee and could pos
sibly like any other course, become elective.
Furthermore, the 20 have been given until June 15 to make up
the incompletes they received by refusing to sign the Community
Health Final exam. This is just six months from the date they
took the exam—a clear deviation from the accepted practice ol
allowing one year to make up incompletes.
The 20 students certainly had nothing to gain personally by
leaving their exams unsigned—they only wanted to improve the
course. Now they could be thrown out for their trouble.
We urge Dean Glaser to make a public statement immediately
to explain:
1) Why the Medical School is harrassing the 20 students by
threatening to expel them;
2) Why the Medical School or the preventive medicine depart
ment haven't admitted that the "core" community health course
needs improvement, and then done something about it;
3) Why the Medical School has no formal mechanism for letting
students actively take part in curricular review and reform.

seems odd when viewed next to the usually progressive educa
tional philosophy for which the Medical School is justly admired.
For example, the Medical School intends by next fall to rede
fine its "core" curriculum to give students more freedom of choice
in their course work. Students will soon, it is hoped, be designing
highly individualized study plans in consultation with faculty
advisers. Traditional distinctions of first, second, third, fourth, and
fifth-year students will be abolished. The grading system is already
honors-pass-fail.
We only wish undergraduate programs were so good.
But how do students fit into all this planning? No formal mech
anism now exists for students to take a real part in improving or
exaluating their curriculum. The new one-shot committee to rede
fine the required curriculum will have only two non-voting stu
dent members and a contemplated medical Faculty senate may
have a few voting students.
Limited student roles still do not give students a voice in specific
curricular matters. And neither of these bodies would give the
20 medical students a part in dealing with the question they have
raised.
The medical students presently have one demand—that "Com
munity Health (PMD 301)" (which deals almost exclusively with
epidemics) not be passed on to next year's class without im
provement.
Last quarter, Dean Robert Glaser did allow the students to set
up an elective course to cover the other important elements of
community health, including alcoholism, drug addiction, and
smoking. But the students feel that these topics should be part of
a required community health course—not an elective course thai
has to be set up by students.
The Medical School has replied that Community Health will
be reviewed by the ad-hoc curriculum committee and could pos
sibly like any other course, become elective.
Furthermore, the 20 have been given until June 15 to make up
the incompletes they received by refusing to sign the Community
Health Final exam. This is just six months from the date they
took the exam—a clear deviation from the accepted practice ol
allowing one year to make up incompletes.
The 20 students certainly had nothing to gain personally by
leaving their exams unsigned—they only wanted to improve the
course. Now they could be thrown out for their trouble.
We urge Dean Glaser to make a public statement immediately
to explain:
1) Why the Medical School is harrassing the 20 students by
threatening to expel them;
2) Why the Medical School or the preventive medicine depart
ment haven't admitted that the "core" community health course
needs improvement, and then done something about it;
3) Why the Medical School has no formal mechanism for letting
students actively take part in curricular review and reform.
The recent threat to throw 20 medical students out of school
for making trouble over what they considered a third-rate course
seems odd when viewed next to the usually progressive educa
tional philosophy for which the Medical School is justly admired.
