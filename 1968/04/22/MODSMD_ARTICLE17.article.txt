# REVIEW
## Cecil Taylor: He Tells It Like It Is 
### JOHNNIE SCOTT 
If you know who Cecil Taylor
is then you will understand why
it would be impossible to say
anything about him without ref
erences to the Black Arts. It
would be impossible to write a
review of the heaviest "avant
garde" (a sadly bastardized
term in contemporary art cir
cles) jazz pianist without one's
own references springing from
those same sources that provide
the wellspring for Taylor's crea
tive expression.
Cecil Taylor has to be con
ceived of as a five-dimensional
man. He is, all at one time and
place — Space, Heartbeats,
Thought, God, Motions. Time is
lost in an unself-consciousness
of historical recollections.
The scene is 1 Million 8.C.,
or ice caves in which sit hud
dled hairy savages one step re
moved from cannibalism. Out
side these caves are Angels . , .
playing trumpets, harps, giving
the Sun reason why it should
smile with favor on the earth.

Yes, it would be difficult if
not impossible to write or even
talk about the Cecil Taylor Sex
tet without any notions of per
sonal being. Brother Malcolm
X talks about personal being at
one point in his Autobiography
—"The most dangerous man in
America is the street hustler.
This is a man without moral
sanctions, inhibitions, or guilts."
Simply, the street hustler has
no traditions or customs to
guide his ideas, or references
when entering involvement. On
reaching the level of human in
tercourse, not sexual, the street
hustler is as vital as a 2000
year-old ethos whose American
history has been one of a sad
ineffectually at bringing about
Brotherhood between the races
of man without violence, de
spair, frustration, blues.
For black people in America,
it is Blues that counts most —
not frustration, or negritude, or
nationalism, or revolution. These
are only parts of the Whole.
And for black people in Amer

ica, in order to understand
Blues, it is necessary to travel
to the Holy City, or New York
(which for black people is Har
lem). It is Harlem that contains
the roots. It was Harlem that
first provided soil for the sow
ing of the Dragon's teeth.
Cecil Taylor knows this. That
is, to hear his music is to know
who that brown-skinned night
ingale Billie Holliday singing
her heart out in spite of that
heroin bursting her heart
strings . . . who she was when
late at night she would ride
home in a taxi through Harlem's
angry streets after playing a
session (perhaps with Basie, or
maybe Chico Hamilton) with no
place to go.
There she was, Lady Day and
yet her world was one of dark
ness. Again, that five-dimen
sional man—one of the dimen
sions being heartbeats.
There are those who style
themselves knowledgeable about
the legacy and the curse which
jazz is set up who call Cecil
a leader of Third Stream Music.
This is to say, Taylor is an eclec
tic tapping from all sources and
yet still retaining his own es
sence . . . expressing that es
sence in lyric.
Critics call his music angry.
Others call it disturbing. There
are the hippies like Ginsberg
who see Taylor as black angels
pulling down the Walls of Jeri
cho. They are, separately, cor
rect in their analysis and yet
they are each, separately, wrong,
Cecil Taylor—You need to dig
his bebop cap, bellbottoms,
busted-down tennis shoes (US
Keds), and streaky sideburns
knows what all of these cats
have said and still are saying,
offers this insight, "There are
and have never been two similar
sounds anyplace in the world!"
What I dug about him was the
way he would leave you (hung
up in your own fetishes) to dig
tapes of the sessions.
Last Thursday, for example,
Taylor's group played two sets.
For 1 hour and 45 minutes they
held the stage spellbound at
San Francisco State. Some three
hours later, at Tresidder's Large
Lounge, they embarked on a
115-minute adventure in music
that sent some people running
out of the room on into Tre
sidder's parking lot (one I saw
in particular leaped up and
down on a black hearse parked
there . . . driven by Stanford
students, I was later told).
The sounds are religion. They
affirm the Brotherhood through
the hungriest of all vehicles of
expression—no respect for any
thing under the sun, no belief
in any credo but that of God,
no movement but that which is
total. Tradition, it exists only

to show that what has already
been accomplished does not and
must not be repeated.
The effects, as they hit you
and You and YOU, are revolu
tionary. It is consciousness of lo
cation in a physical universe
predicated on the spit sucked
down a defeated man's throat
when he's told to hold back
what it is that he means and
compromise his Thought . . .
Nature . . . for purchasing's
sake . . . never his own.
Alan Silva (moving very
strongly on the bass himself
heehawing at the heady free
dom that being Cecil Taylor
means) got on down before the
Tresidder gig and explained his
music. "I'm that Latin-American
guerrilla named Che Guevara
doing things people talk about!"
To see him tearing apart the
bullshit of his elders (that
hoary- headed group who dis
dain the freer forms for more
rational forms of songs . . . that
sort whose music makes death
out of prayer) is to believe.
Silva's style, though radically
different from the moanin'
groanin' foot-stampin' wailin'
Frank Wright whose tenor sax
rings out with "Lome me with
your deceit and lies make me
dead if you wanna but love me
because you're goin' to havta!,"
shows more clearly even than
my words that conscience is
there in the niches of man's
own conscience.
It is You people who will have
to prepare yourselves. The pro
fundity of Taylor's thought is
staggering. The control busts
heads in a stylistic fashion Oak
land's Police Department would
surely envy yet will never come
close to simply because Taylor's
violence is hundreds of light
years from America's hang-ups.
His violence is a love ethic.
It is Armageddon—not the Fire
but the Judgment. Those who
have read REVELATIONS
know what I mean. Listen to
the small, wizened fox of a man
and the only comparable sound
is electronic music. But this
music is done and performed by
humans. It is being said by
your own brothers that there
is still time to save yourselves,
just check us out and believe!
Altoist Jimmy Lyons was
dapper, mosquito-slick in his
tweed sport jacket and hush
puppies. He carried on himself
—doing things the New York
school is famous for these be
ing cats like Archie Shepp,
Pharoh Sanders, and Marion
Brown. Lyons is a strong broth
er, and it is precisely because of
this that Lyons must be seen
in action by all of you. Cecil has
surrounded himself with gen
iuses.
The drummer, Andrew Cy

rille, justifies the statement. He
lets you know with that insist
ent individuality of his own that
this world of music encom
passes pain and trial unknown
to America's middle and upper
classes—the sound of a woman
being robbed screaming in the
middle of a busy ghetto street
at night, everybody moving too
fast to notice or even care while,
elsewhere on the planet, some
young cat is stepping out on
the town with two dollars, a
half-pint of Seagram's in that
left hip-pocket and his mind set
on shakin' up the whole Crea
tion.
This leaves God's own
trumpet player, Gabriel himself.
Gabriel will ring out the sound
of Judgment Day. Gabriel will
wake the dead. Gabriel will
bring fear to the sinnor. Gabriel
will bring smiles to the hungry
and oppressed. It is Gabriel, in
all his unadorned glory, who
will make the Prophecy com
plete.
In the Universe of Cecil Tay
lor, Gabriel goes by another
name (I hope good Christians
will welcome the fact that some
of us are religious enough to
make the identification!). Eddie
Gale, hard trumpet, City Slums,
Bedford-Stuyvestant, growing
up not like you or Him or Her
but, Eddie Gale—the strongest
horn because he plays the
youngest blues (perhaps be
cause I am young and make the
identification).
You won't hear Taylor's
group attemtping to compete
with Electric Flag, or Cream,
or whoever it was that you
were lucky enough to make
with the Charles Lloyd set at
the Fillmore last quarter. They
don't ask for lip-service, or
falsetto voices. No intense con
versation on the intricacies of
five-four beats.
Understanding what is going
on and what I personally feel
about the entire group, I would
recommend that you make it a
point to dig them, if you can.
If unable, no one is really going
to miss you. The hope is there

If you know who Cecil Taylor
is then you will understand why
it would be impossible to say
anything about him without ref
erences to the Black Arts. It
would be impossible to write a
review of the heaviest "avant
garde" (a sadly bastardized
term in contemporary art cir
cles) jazz pianist without one's
own references springing from
those same sources that provide
the wellspring for Taylor's crea
tive expression.
Cecil Taylor has to be con
ceived of as a five-dimensional
man. He is, all at one time and
place — Space, Heartbeats,
Thought, God, Motions. Time is
lost in an unself-consciousness
of historical recollections.
The scene is 1 Million 8.C.,
or ice caves in which sit hud
dled hairy savages one step re
moved from cannibalism. Out
side these caves are Angels . , .
playing trumpets, harps, giving
the Sun reason why it should
smile with favor on the earth.

Yes, it would be difficult if
not impossible to write or even
talk about the Cecil Taylor Sex
tet without any notions of per
sonal being. Brother Malcolm
X talks about personal being at
one point in his Autobiography
—"The most dangerous man in
America is the street hustler.
This is a man without moral
sanctions, inhibitions, or guilts."
Simply, the street hustler has
no traditions or customs to
guide his ideas, or references
when entering involvement. On
reaching the level of human in
tercourse, not sexual, the street
hustler is as vital as a 2000
year-old ethos whose American
history has been one of a sad
ineffectually at bringing about
Brotherhood between the races
of man without violence, de
spair, frustration, blues.
For black people in America,
it is Blues that counts most —
not frustration, or negritude, or
nationalism, or revolution. These
are only parts of the Whole.
And for black people in Amer

ica, in order to understand
Blues, it is necessary to travel
to the Holy City, or New York
(which for black people is Har
lem). It is Harlem that contains
the roots. It was Harlem that
first provided soil for the sow
ing of the Dragon's teeth.
Cecil Taylor knows this. That
is, to hear his music is to know
who that brown-skinned night
ingale Billie Holliday singing
her heart out in spite of that
heroin bursting her heart
strings . . . who she was when
late at night she would ride
home in a taxi through Harlem's
angry streets after playing a
session (perhaps with Basie, or
maybe Chico Hamilton) with no
place to go.
There she was, Lady Day and
yet her world was one of dark
ness. Again, that five-dimen
sional man—one of the dimen
sions being heartbeats.
There are those who style
themselves knowledgeable about
the legacy and the curse which
jazz is set up who call Cecil
a leader of Third Stream Music.
This is to say, Taylor is an eclec
tic tapping from all sources and
yet still retaining his own es
sence . . . expressing that es
sence in lyric.
Critics call his music angry.
Others call it disturbing. There
are the hippies like Ginsberg
who see Taylor as black angels
pulling down the Walls of Jeri
cho. They are, separately, cor
rect in their analysis and yet
they are each, separately, wrong,
Cecil Taylor—You need to dig
his bebop cap, bellbottoms,
busted-down tennis shoes (US
Keds), and streaky sideburns
knows what all of these cats
have said and still are saying,
offers this insight, "There are
and have never been two similar
sounds anyplace in the world!"
What I dug about him was the
way he would leave you (hung
up in your own fetishes) to dig
tapes of the sessions.
Last Thursday, for example,
Taylor's group played two sets.
For 1 hour and 45 minutes they
held the stage spellbound at
San Francisco State. Some three
hours later, at Tresidder's Large
Lounge, they embarked on a
115-minute adventure in music
that sent some people running
out of the room on into Tre
sidder's parking lot (one I saw
in particular leaped up and
down on a black hearse parked
there . . . driven by Stanford
students, I was later told).
The sounds are religion. They
affirm the Brotherhood through
the hungriest of all vehicles of
expression—no respect for any
thing under the sun, no belief
in any credo but that of God,
no movement but that which is
total. Tradition, it exists only

to show that what has already
been accomplished does not and
must not be repeated.
The effects, as they hit you
and You and YOU, are revolu
tionary. It is consciousness of lo
cation in a physical universe
predicated on the spit sucked
down a defeated man's throat
when he's told to hold back
what it is that he means and
compromise his Thought . . .
Nature . . . for purchasing's
sake . . . never his own.
Alan Silva (moving very
strongly on the bass himself
heehawing at the heady free
dom that being Cecil Taylor
means) got on down before the
Tresidder gig and explained his
music. "I'm that Latin-American
guerrilla named Che Guevara
doing things people talk about!"
To see him tearing apart the
bullshit of his elders (that
hoary- headed group who dis
dain the freer forms for more
rational forms of songs . . . that
sort whose music makes death
out of prayer) is to believe.
Silva's style, though radically
different from the moanin'
groanin' foot-stampin' wailin'
Frank Wright whose tenor sax
rings out with "Lome me with
your deceit and lies make me
dead if you wanna but love me
because you're goin' to havta!,"
shows more clearly even than
my words that conscience is
there in the niches of man's
own conscience.
It is You people who will have
to prepare yourselves. The pro
fundity of Taylor's thought is
staggering. The control busts
heads in a stylistic fashion Oak
land's Police Department would
surely envy yet will never come
close to simply because Taylor's
violence is hundreds of light
years from America's hang-ups.
His violence is a love ethic.
It is Armageddon—not the Fire
but the Judgment. Those who
have read REVELATIONS
know what I mean. Listen to
the small, wizened fox of a man
and the only comparable sound
is electronic music. But this
music is done and performed by
humans. It is being said by
your own brothers that there
is still time to save yourselves,
just check us out and believe!
Altoist Jimmy Lyons was
dapper, mosquito-slick in his
tweed sport jacket and hush
puppies. He carried on himself
—doing things the New York
school is famous for these be
ing cats like Archie Shepp,
Pharoh Sanders, and Marion
Brown. Lyons is a strong broth
er, and it is precisely because of
this that Lyons must be seen
in action by all of you. Cecil has
surrounded himself with gen
iuses.
The drummer, Andrew Cy

rille, justifies the statement. He
lets you know with that insist
ent individuality of his own that
this world of music encom
passes pain and trial unknown
to America's middle and upper
classes—the sound of a woman
being robbed screaming in the
middle of a busy ghetto street
at night, everybody moving too
fast to notice or even care while,
elsewhere on the planet, some
young cat is stepping out on
the town with two dollars, a
half-pint of Seagram's in that
left hip-pocket and his mind set
on shakin' up the whole Crea
tion.
This leaves God's own
trumpet player, Gabriel himself.
Gabriel will ring out the sound
of Judgment Day. Gabriel will
wake the dead. Gabriel will
bring fear to the sinnor. Gabriel
will bring smiles to the hungry
and oppressed. It is Gabriel, in
all his unadorned glory, who
will make the Prophecy com
plete.
In the Universe of Cecil Tay
lor, Gabriel goes by another
name (I hope good Christians
will welcome the fact that some
of us are religious enough to
make the identification!). Eddie
Gale, hard trumpet, City Slums,
Bedford-Stuyvestant, growing
up not like you or Him or Her
but, Eddie Gale—the strongest
horn because he plays the
youngest blues (perhaps be
cause I am young and make the
identification).
You won't hear Taylor's
group attemtping to compete
with Electric Flag, or Cream,
or whoever it was that you
were lucky enough to make
with the Charles Lloyd set at
the Fillmore last quarter. They
don't ask for lip-service, or
falsetto voices. No intense con
versation on the intricacies of
five-four beats.
Understanding what is going
on and what I personally feel
about the entire group, I would
recommend that you make it a
point to dig them, if you can.
If unable, no one is really going
to miss you. The hope is there

If you know who Cecil Taylor
is then you will understand why
it would be impossible to say
anything about him without ref
erences to the Black Arts. It
would be impossible to write a
review of the heaviest "avant
garde" (a sadly bastardized
term in contemporary art cir
cles) jazz pianist without one's
own references springing from
those same sources that provide
the wellspring for Taylor's crea
tive expression.
Cecil Taylor has to be con
ceived of as a five-dimensional
man. He is, all at one time and
place — Space, Heartbeats,
Thought, God, Motions. Time is
lost in an unself-consciousness
of historical recollections.
The scene is 1 Million 8.C.,
or ice caves in which sit hud
dled hairy savages one step re
moved from cannibalism. Out
side these caves are Angels . , .
playing trumpets, harps, giving
the Sun reason why it should
smile with favor on the earth.

Yes, it would be difficult if
not impossible to write or even
talk about the Cecil Taylor Sex
tet without any notions of per
sonal being. Brother Malcolm
X talks about personal being at
one point in his Autobiography
—"The most dangerous man in
America is the street hustler.
This is a man without moral
sanctions, inhibitions, or guilts."
Simply, the street hustler has
no traditions or customs to
guide his ideas, or references
when entering involvement. On
reaching the level of human in
tercourse, not sexual, the street
hustler is as vital as a 2000
year-old ethos whose American
history has been one of a sad
ineffectually at bringing about
Brotherhood between the races
of man without violence, de
spair, frustration, blues.
For black people in America,
it is Blues that counts most —
not frustration, or negritude, or
nationalism, or revolution. These
are only parts of the Whole.
And for black people in Amer

ica, in order to understand
Blues, it is necessary to travel
to the Holy City, or New York
(which for black people is Har
lem). It is Harlem that contains
the roots. It was Harlem that
first provided soil for the sow
ing of the Dragon's teeth.
Cecil Taylor knows this. That
is, to hear his music is to know
who that brown-skinned night
ingale Billie Holliday singing
her heart out in spite of that
heroin bursting her heart
strings . . . who she was when
late at night she would ride
home in a taxi through Harlem's
angry streets after playing a
session (perhaps with Basie, or
maybe Chico Hamilton) with no
place to go.
There she was, Lady Day and
yet her world was one of dark
ness. Again, that five-dimen
sional man—one of the dimen
sions being heartbeats.
There are those who style
themselves knowledgeable about
the legacy and the curse which
jazz is set up who call Cecil
a leader of Third Stream Music.
This is to say, Taylor is an eclec
tic tapping from all sources and
yet still retaining his own es
sence . . . expressing that es
sence in lyric.
Critics call his music angry.
Others call it disturbing. There
are the hippies like Ginsberg
who see Taylor as black angels
pulling down the Walls of Jeri
cho. They are, separately, cor
rect in their analysis and yet
they are each, separately, wrong,
Cecil Taylor—You need to dig
his bebop cap, bellbottoms,
busted-down tennis shoes (US
Keds), and streaky sideburns
knows what all of these cats
have said and still are saying,
offers this insight, "There are
and have never been two similar
sounds anyplace in the world!"
What I dug about him was the
way he would leave you (hung
up in your own fetishes) to dig
tapes of the sessions.
Last Thursday, for example,
Taylor's group played two sets.
For 1 hour and 45 minutes they
held the stage spellbound at
San Francisco State. Some three
hours later, at Tresidder's Large
Lounge, they embarked on a
115-minute adventure in music
that sent some people running
out of the room on into Tre
sidder's parking lot (one I saw
in particular leaped up and
down on a black hearse parked
there . . . driven by Stanford
students, I was later told).
The sounds are religion. They
affirm the Brotherhood through
the hungriest of all vehicles of
expression—no respect for any
thing under the sun, no belief
in any credo but that of God,
no movement but that which is
total. Tradition, it exists only

to show that what has already
been accomplished does not and
must not be repeated.
The effects, as they hit you
and You and YOU, are revolu
tionary. It is consciousness of lo
cation in a physical universe
predicated on the spit sucked
down a defeated man's throat
when he's told to hold back
what it is that he means and
compromise his Thought . . .
Nature . . . for purchasing's
sake . . . never his own.
Alan Silva (moving very
strongly on the bass himself
heehawing at the heady free
dom that being Cecil Taylor
means) got on down before the
Tresidder gig and explained his
music. "I'm that Latin-American
guerrilla named Che Guevara
doing things people talk about!"
To see him tearing apart the
bullshit of his elders (that
hoary- headed group who dis
dain the freer forms for more
rational forms of songs . . . that
sort whose music makes death
out of prayer) is to believe.
Silva's style, though radically
different from the moanin'
groanin' foot-stampin' wailin'
Frank Wright whose tenor sax
rings out with "Lome me with
your deceit and lies make me
dead if you wanna but love me
because you're goin' to havta!,"
shows more clearly even than
my words that conscience is
there in the niches of man's
own conscience.
It is You people who will have
to prepare yourselves. The pro
fundity of Taylor's thought is
staggering. The control busts
heads in a stylistic fashion Oak
land's Police Department would
surely envy yet will never come
close to simply because Taylor's
violence is hundreds of light
years from America's hang-ups.
His violence is a love ethic.
It is Armageddon—not the Fire
but the Judgment. Those who
have read REVELATIONS
know what I mean. Listen to
the small, wizened fox of a man
and the only comparable sound
is electronic music. But this
music is done and performed by
humans. It is being said by
your own brothers that there
is still time to save yourselves,
just check us out and believe!
Altoist Jimmy Lyons was
dapper, mosquito-slick in his
tweed sport jacket and hush
puppies. He carried on himself
—doing things the New York
school is famous for these be
ing cats like Archie Shepp,
Pharoh Sanders, and Marion
Brown. Lyons is a strong broth
er, and it is precisely because of
this that Lyons must be seen
in action by all of you. Cecil has
surrounded himself with gen
iuses.
The drummer, Andrew Cy

rille, justifies the statement. He
lets you know with that insist
ent individuality of his own that
this world of music encom
passes pain and trial unknown
to America's middle and upper
classes—the sound of a woman
being robbed screaming in the
middle of a busy ghetto street
at night, everybody moving too
fast to notice or even care while,
elsewhere on the planet, some
young cat is stepping out on
the town with two dollars, a
half-pint of Seagram's in that
left hip-pocket and his mind set
on shakin' up the whole Crea
tion.
This leaves God's own
trumpet player, Gabriel himself.
Gabriel will ring out the sound
of Judgment Day. Gabriel will
wake the dead. Gabriel will
bring fear to the sinnor. Gabriel
will bring smiles to the hungry
and oppressed. It is Gabriel, in
all his unadorned glory, who
will make the Prophecy com
plete.
In the Universe of Cecil Tay
lor, Gabriel goes by another
name (I hope good Christians
will welcome the fact that some
of us are religious enough to
make the identification!). Eddie
Gale, hard trumpet, City Slums,
Bedford-Stuyvestant, growing
up not like you or Him or Her
but, Eddie Gale—the strongest
horn because he plays the
youngest blues (perhaps be
cause I am young and make the
identification).
You won't hear Taylor's
group attemtping to compete
with Electric Flag, or Cream,
or whoever it was that you
were lucky enough to make
with the Charles Lloyd set at
the Fillmore last quarter. They
don't ask for lip-service, or
falsetto voices. No intense con
versation on the intricacies of
five-four beats.
Understanding what is going
on and what I personally feel
about the entire group, I would
recommend that you make it a
point to dig them, if you can.
If unable, no one is really going
to miss you. The hope is there

If you know who Cecil Taylor
is then you will understand why
it would be impossible to say
anything about him without ref
erences to the Black Arts. It
would be impossible to write a
review of the heaviest "avant
garde" (a sadly bastardized
term in contemporary art cir
cles) jazz pianist without one's
own references springing from
those same sources that provide
the wellspring for Taylor's crea
tive expression.
Cecil Taylor has to be con
ceived of as a five-dimensional
man. He is, all at one time and
place — Space, Heartbeats,
Thought, God, Motions. Time is
lost in an unself-consciousness
of historical recollections.
The scene is 1 Million 8.C.,
or ice caves in which sit hud
dled hairy savages one step re
moved from cannibalism. Out
side these caves are Angels . , .
playing trumpets, harps, giving
the Sun reason why it should
smile with favor on the earth.

Yes, it would be difficult if
not impossible to write or even
talk about the Cecil Taylor Sex
tet without any notions of per
sonal being. Brother Malcolm
X talks about personal being at
one point in his Autobiography
—"The most dangerous man in
America is the street hustler.
This is a man without moral
sanctions, inhibitions, or guilts."
Simply, the street hustler has
no traditions or customs to
guide his ideas, or references
when entering involvement. On
reaching the level of human in
tercourse, not sexual, the street
hustler is as vital as a 2000
year-old ethos whose American
history has been one of a sad
ineffectually at bringing about
Brotherhood between the races
of man without violence, de
spair, frustration, blues.
For black people in America,
it is Blues that counts most —
not frustration, or negritude, or
nationalism, or revolution. These
are only parts of the Whole.
And for black people in Amer

ica, in order to understand
Blues, it is necessary to travel
to the Holy City, or New York
(which for black people is Har
lem). It is Harlem that contains
the roots. It was Harlem that
first provided soil for the sow
ing of the Dragon's teeth.
Cecil Taylor knows this. That
is, to hear his music is to know
who that brown-skinned night
ingale Billie Holliday singing
her heart out in spite of that
heroin bursting her heart
strings . . . who she was when
late at night she would ride
home in a taxi through Harlem's
angry streets after playing a
session (perhaps with Basie, or
maybe Chico Hamilton) with no
place to go.
There she was, Lady Day and
yet her world was one of dark
ness. Again, that five-dimen
sional man—one of the dimen
sions being heartbeats.
There are those who style
themselves knowledgeable about
the legacy and the curse which
jazz is set up who call Cecil
a leader of Third Stream Music.
This is to say, Taylor is an eclec
tic tapping from all sources and
yet still retaining his own es
sence . . . expressing that es
sence in lyric.
Critics call his music angry.
Others call it disturbing. There
are the hippies like Ginsberg
who see Taylor as black angels
pulling down the Walls of Jeri
cho. They are, separately, cor
rect in their analysis and yet
they are each, separately, wrong,
Cecil Taylor—You need to dig
his bebop cap, bellbottoms,
busted-down tennis shoes (US
Keds), and streaky sideburns
knows what all of these cats
have said and still are saying,
offers this insight, "There are
and have never been two similar
sounds anyplace in the world!"
What I dug about him was the
way he would leave you (hung
up in your own fetishes) to dig
tapes of the sessions.
Last Thursday, for example,
Taylor's group played two sets.
For 1 hour and 45 minutes they
held the stage spellbound at
San Francisco State. Some three
hours later, at Tresidder's Large
Lounge, they embarked on a
115-minute adventure in music
that sent some people running
out of the room on into Tre
sidder's parking lot (one I saw
in particular leaped up and
down on a black hearse parked
there . . . driven by Stanford
students, I was later told).
The sounds are religion. They
affirm the Brotherhood through
the hungriest of all vehicles of
expression—no respect for any
thing under the sun, no belief
in any credo but that of God,
no movement but that which is
total. Tradition, it exists only

to show that what has already
been accomplished does not and
must not be repeated.
The effects, as they hit you
and You and YOU, are revolu
tionary. It is consciousness of lo
cation in a physical universe
predicated on the spit sucked
down a defeated man's throat
when he's told to hold back
what it is that he means and
compromise his Thought . . .
Nature . . . for purchasing's
sake . . . never his own.
Alan Silva (moving very
strongly on the bass himself
heehawing at the heady free
dom that being Cecil Taylor
means) got on down before the
Tresidder gig and explained his
music. "I'm that Latin-American
guerrilla named Che Guevara
doing things people talk about!"
To see him tearing apart the
bullshit of his elders (that
hoary- headed group who dis
dain the freer forms for more
rational forms of songs . . . that
sort whose music makes death
out of prayer) is to believe.
Silva's style, though radically
different from the moanin'
groanin' foot-stampin' wailin'
Frank Wright whose tenor sax
rings out with "Lome me with
your deceit and lies make me
dead if you wanna but love me
because you're goin' to havta!,"
shows more clearly even than
my words that conscience is
there in the niches of man's
own conscience.
It is You people who will have
to prepare yourselves. The pro
fundity of Taylor's thought is
staggering. The control busts
heads in a stylistic fashion Oak
land's Police Department would
surely envy yet will never come
close to simply because Taylor's
violence is hundreds of light
years from America's hang-ups.
His violence is a love ethic.
It is Armageddon—not the Fire
but the Judgment. Those who
have read REVELATIONS
know what I mean. Listen to
the small, wizened fox of a man
and the only comparable sound
is electronic music. But this
music is done and performed by
humans. It is being said by
your own brothers that there
is still time to save yourselves,
just check us out and believe!
Altoist Jimmy Lyons was
dapper, mosquito-slick in his
tweed sport jacket and hush
puppies. He carried on himself
—doing things the New York
school is famous for these be
ing cats like Archie Shepp,
Pharoh Sanders, and Marion
Brown. Lyons is a strong broth
er, and it is precisely because of
this that Lyons must be seen
in action by all of you. Cecil has
surrounded himself with gen
iuses.
The drummer, Andrew Cy

rille, justifies the statement. He
lets you know with that insist
ent individuality of his own that
this world of music encom
passes pain and trial unknown
to America's middle and upper
classes—the sound of a woman
being robbed screaming in the
middle of a busy ghetto street
at night, everybody moving too
fast to notice or even care while,
elsewhere on the planet, some
young cat is stepping out on
the town with two dollars, a
half-pint of Seagram's in that
left hip-pocket and his mind set
on shakin' up the whole Crea
tion.
This leaves God's own
trumpet player, Gabriel himself.
Gabriel will ring out the sound
of Judgment Day. Gabriel will
wake the dead. Gabriel will
bring fear to the sinnor. Gabriel
will bring smiles to the hungry
and oppressed. It is Gabriel, in
all his unadorned glory, who
will make the Prophecy com
plete.
In the Universe of Cecil Tay
lor, Gabriel goes by another
name (I hope good Christians
will welcome the fact that some
of us are religious enough to
make the identification!). Eddie
Gale, hard trumpet, City Slums,
Bedford-Stuyvestant, growing
up not like you or Him or Her
but, Eddie Gale—the strongest
horn because he plays the
youngest blues (perhaps be
cause I am young and make the
identification).
You won't hear Taylor's
group attemtping to compete
with Electric Flag, or Cream,
or whoever it was that you
were lucky enough to make
with the Charles Lloyd set at
the Fillmore last quarter. They
don't ask for lip-service, or
falsetto voices. No intense con
versation on the intricacies of
five-four beats.
Understanding what is going
on and what I personally feel
about the entire group, I would
recommend that you make it a
point to dig them, if you can.
If unable, no one is really going
to miss you. The hope is there

If you know who Cecil Taylor
is then you will understand why
it would be impossible to say
anything about him without ref
erences to the Black Arts. It
would be impossible to write a
review of the heaviest "avant
garde" (a sadly bastardized
term in contemporary art cir
cles) jazz pianist without one's
own references springing from
those same sources that provide
the wellspring for Taylor's crea
tive expression.
Cecil Taylor has to be con
ceived of as a five-dimensional
man. He is, all at one time and
place — Space, Heartbeats,
Thought, God, Motions. Time is
lost in an unself-consciousness
of historical recollections.
The scene is 1 Million 8.C.,
or ice caves in which sit hud
dled hairy savages one step re
moved from cannibalism. Out
side these caves are Angels . , .
playing trumpets, harps, giving
the Sun reason why it should
smile with favor on the earth.

Yes, it would be difficult if
not impossible to write or even
talk about the Cecil Taylor Sex
tet without any notions of per
sonal being. Brother Malcolm
X talks about personal being at
one point in his Autobiography
—"The most dangerous man in
America is the street hustler.
This is a man without moral
sanctions, inhibitions, or guilts."
Simply, the street hustler has
no traditions or customs to
guide his ideas, or references
when entering involvement. On
reaching the level of human in
tercourse, not sexual, the street
hustler is as vital as a 2000
year-old ethos whose American
history has been one of a sad
ineffectually at bringing about
Brotherhood between the races
of man without violence, de
spair, frustration, blues.
For black people in America,
it is Blues that counts most —
not frustration, or negritude, or
nationalism, or revolution. These
are only parts of the Whole.
And for black people in Amer

ica, in order to understand
Blues, it is necessary to travel
to the Holy City, or New York
(which for black people is Har
lem). It is Harlem that contains
the roots. It was Harlem that
first provided soil for the sow
ing of the Dragon's teeth.
Cecil Taylor knows this. That
is, to hear his music is to know
who that brown-skinned night
ingale Billie Holliday singing
her heart out in spite of that
heroin bursting her heart
strings . . . who she was when
late at night she would ride
home in a taxi through Harlem's
angry streets after playing a
session (perhaps with Basie, or
maybe Chico Hamilton) with no
place to go.
There she was, Lady Day and
yet her world was one of dark
ness. Again, that five-dimen
sional man—one of the dimen
sions being heartbeats.
There are those who style
themselves knowledgeable about
the legacy and the curse which
jazz is set up who call Cecil
a leader of Third Stream Music.
This is to say, Taylor is an eclec
tic tapping from all sources and
yet still retaining his own es
sence . . . expressing that es
sence in lyric.
Critics call his music angry.
Others call it disturbing. There
are the hippies like Ginsberg
who see Taylor as black angels
pulling down the Walls of Jeri
cho. They are, separately, cor
rect in their analysis and yet
they are each, separately, wrong,
Cecil Taylor—You need to dig
his bebop cap, bellbottoms,
busted-down tennis shoes (US
Keds), and streaky sideburns
knows what all of these cats
have said and still are saying,
offers this insight, "There are
and have never been two similar
sounds anyplace in the world!"
What I dug about him was the
way he would leave you (hung
up in your own fetishes) to dig
tapes of the sessions.
Last Thursday, for example,
Taylor's group played two sets.
For 1 hour and 45 minutes they
held the stage spellbound at
San Francisco State. Some three
hours later, at Tresidder's Large
Lounge, they embarked on a
115-minute adventure in music
that sent some people running
out of the room on into Tre
sidder's parking lot (one I saw
in particular leaped up and
down on a black hearse parked
there . . . driven by Stanford
students, I was later told).
The sounds are religion. They
affirm the Brotherhood through
the hungriest of all vehicles of
expression—no respect for any
thing under the sun, no belief
in any credo but that of God,
no movement but that which is
total. Tradition, it exists only

to show that what has already
been accomplished does not and
must not be repeated.
The effects, as they hit you
and You and YOU, are revolu
tionary. It is consciousness of lo
cation in a physical universe
predicated on the spit sucked
down a defeated man's throat
when he's told to hold back
what it is that he means and
compromise his Thought . . .
Nature . . . for purchasing's
sake . . . never his own.
Alan Silva (moving very
strongly on the bass himself
heehawing at the heady free
dom that being Cecil Taylor
means) got on down before the
Tresidder gig and explained his
music. "I'm that Latin-American
guerrilla named Che Guevara
doing things people talk about!"
To see him tearing apart the
bullshit of his elders (that
hoary- headed group who dis
dain the freer forms for more
rational forms of songs . . . that
sort whose music makes death
out of prayer) is to believe.
Silva's style, though radically
different from the moanin'
groanin' foot-stampin' wailin'
Frank Wright whose tenor sax
rings out with "Lome me with
your deceit and lies make me
dead if you wanna but love me
because you're goin' to havta!,"
shows more clearly even than
my words that conscience is
there in the niches of man's
own conscience.
It is You people who will have
to prepare yourselves. The pro
fundity of Taylor's thought is
staggering. The control busts
heads in a stylistic fashion Oak
land's Police Department would
surely envy yet will never come
close to simply because Taylor's
violence is hundreds of light
years from America's hang-ups.
His violence is a love ethic.
It is Armageddon—not the Fire
but the Judgment. Those who
have read REVELATIONS
know what I mean. Listen to
the small, wizened fox of a man
and the only comparable sound
is electronic music. But this
music is done and performed by
humans. It is being said by
your own brothers that there
is still time to save yourselves,
just check us out and believe!
Altoist Jimmy Lyons was
dapper, mosquito-slick in his
tweed sport jacket and hush
puppies. He carried on himself
—doing things the New York
school is famous for these be
ing cats like Archie Shepp,
Pharoh Sanders, and Marion
Brown. Lyons is a strong broth
er, and it is precisely because of
this that Lyons must be seen
in action by all of you. Cecil has
surrounded himself with gen
iuses.
The drummer, Andrew Cy

rille, justifies the statement. He
lets you know with that insist
ent individuality of his own that
this world of music encom
passes pain and trial unknown
to America's middle and upper
classes—the sound of a woman
being robbed screaming in the
middle of a busy ghetto street
at night, everybody moving too
fast to notice or even care while,
elsewhere on the planet, some
young cat is stepping out on
the town with two dollars, a
half-pint of Seagram's in that
left hip-pocket and his mind set
on shakin' up the whole Crea
tion.
This leaves God's own
trumpet player, Gabriel himself.
Gabriel will ring out the sound
of Judgment Day. Gabriel will
wake the dead. Gabriel will
bring fear to the sinnor. Gabriel
will bring smiles to the hungry
and oppressed. It is Gabriel, in
all his unadorned glory, who
will make the Prophecy com
plete.
In the Universe of Cecil Tay
lor, Gabriel goes by another
name (I hope good Christians
will welcome the fact that some
of us are religious enough to
make the identification!). Eddie
Gale, hard trumpet, City Slums,
Bedford-Stuyvestant, growing
up not like you or Him or Her
but, Eddie Gale—the strongest
horn because he plays the
youngest blues (perhaps be
cause I am young and make the
identification).
You won't hear Taylor's
group attemtping to compete
with Electric Flag, or Cream,
or whoever it was that you
were lucky enough to make
with the Charles Lloyd set at
the Fillmore last quarter. They
don't ask for lip-service, or
falsetto voices. No intense con
versation on the intricacies of
five-four beats.
Understanding what is going
on and what I personally feel
about the entire group, I would
recommend that you make it a
point to dig them, if you can.
If unable, no one is really going
to miss you. The hope is there
