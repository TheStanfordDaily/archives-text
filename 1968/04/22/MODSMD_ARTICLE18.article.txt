# SF Prof: White Society Denies Blacks Their True Heritage
## 
### BARBARA HYLAND 
Black Americans have been
hindered from knowing the
"truth of their heritage" by a
white society which has degrad
ed and misrepresented African
history, a San Francisco State
history professor told a Tresid
der large lounge audience Thurs
day night.
The talk by Roland Snelling,
one of a series during Afro-
American Culture Week, dealt
with black history from ancient
Africa to the present in the
United States ("this Christian
country smacking of the devil")
and the black consciousness.
"One of the createst farces of
these times is the invention of
the Negro and placing him in
conflict with the African," Snell
ing said. Negroes have an Afri
can heritage which they should
be informed about and which
should be an integral part of
their lives.
Instead, according to Snelling,
they are taught "diluted history"
in American schools and led to
believe that their culture began
300 years ago. They study the
"history and heroes of another
people."
In addition, he said, American
society is "self-righteously dedi
cated to racism and white Anglo-
Saxon ideals." It misrepresents
African history and ignores the
fact that three-fourths of the
world's population is colored.

A Negro child's mind is "bom
barded with images of the in
feriority of his race not only in
this country but in the home
land," Snelling continued, and
Africans are represented as be
ing "hopeless primitives, utter
ly dependent" on Western Civili

zation and missionaries.
"There's no such damn thing
as a Negro," Stelling cried. Peo
ple are named for lands, not
colors. "The proper name of
wooly-haired black peoples is
Africans," or Afro-Americans in
the United States.
