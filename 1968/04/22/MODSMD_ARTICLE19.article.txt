# Vance Hurls 3-2 Win
## Gallagher Salvages Split With USC 
### PETER DUFFY 
Bob Gallagher ripped a two
run double in the sixth inning
to give Stanford a 3-2 victory
and a doubleheaders split with
the USC Trojans, after USC
took the opener 3-1 on a one
hitter by sophomore righthander
Jim Barr.
Sandy Vance went the distance
in the nightcap to register his
fifth win of the season against
one loss. Vance allowed five hits,
one of them a homer to Rich
Braden in the ninth, while strik
ing out seven.
The Trojans scored once in
the first inning, when a runner
came in on a wild pitch by Vance.
Their 1-0 lead stood up for four
innings, as the Indians failed to
get a hit off Bob Vaughn.
Ron Shotts led oft the fifth
for Stanford with a 400-foot
line-drive home run to the base
of the wooden fence in left
field. For Shotts, a .295 hitter,
it was his first round tripper
of the season. He belted seven
last year.
This tied the score at one
apiece, and the turning point of
the game came the next inning
after the Trojans loaded the
bases with two out. Vance fell
behind the batter with two way
ward pitches which Mike Scho
maker deftly dug out of the?
dirt.
A base on balls seemed im
minent, but Schomaker caught
the Trojan runner on first base

napping by firing the ball to
first baseman Mark Marquess
instead of returning it to Vance.
Marquess made a sweeping tag
on the runner to kill the Trojan
threat and put a halt to their
momentum.
Russ Tweet then led off the
Stanford half of the sixth with
a single and moved to second
on Marquess' sacrifice bunt.
Schomaker followed with a
single to left, sending Tweet
to third, and took second on the
throw in.
With runners on second and
third and one out, Gallagher
drilled a sharp grounder down
the right-field line for his two
run double, giving the Tribe a
3-1 advantage.
Aside from Braden's home run
in the ninth, Vance set down the
Trojans easily over the last three
innings in picking up the win
and the doubleheader split.
In the first game, which went
only seven innings, USC scored
once in the second and added
two unearned runs in the third
off loser Rod Poteete.
The only hit the Tribe could
muster in the contest was a
triple by Gallagher in the
fourth. Bob Boone followed

with a fly to right that brought
home Gallagher with Stan-<
ford's only run of the game.
In a Friday afternoon game,
Stanford downed UCLA 7-3 be
hind the hitting and pitching of
Harvey Shank. Shank scattered
nine hits in picking up his sev
enth win, and blasted a two
run homer and a single to pace
the Tribe attack.

innings, as the Indians failed to
get a hit off Bob Vaughn.
Ron Shotts led oft the fifth
for Stanford with a 400-foot
line-drive home run to the base

Marquess made a sweeping tag
on the runner to kill the Trojan
threat and put a halt to their
momentum.
Russ Tweet then led off the
Stanford half of the sixth with
a single and moved to second
on Marquess' sacrifice bunt.
Schomaker followed with a
single to left, sending Tweet
to third, and took second on the

fourth. Bob Boone followed

with a fly to right that brought
