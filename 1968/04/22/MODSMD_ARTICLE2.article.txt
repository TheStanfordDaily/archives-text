# Phi Belts' Charter Returned After 18 Month Suspension
## 
### 
Stanford's chapter of Phi
Delta Fraternity regained its
national charter Saturday after
a suspension lasting one and
one-half years.
The decision of the five-mem
ber general counsel of the Phi
Delt national executive board
was given to the chapter's presi
dent, senior Bill Nordskog, at
a meeting at Lake Tahoe.
The Phi Delts lost their char
ter in November, 1966, after the
fraternity was suspended by the
University and told to vacate its
house following violations of
student regulations.
Grove house, an experimental
coeducational residence, moved
into the vacated Phi Delt house

in January, 1967. The Phi Delts
were permitted to return in
September, 1967.
But the national refused last
November to return the local's
charter until "some communica
tion started between the house
and the national," according to
Nordskog. This meant regular
reports to the national by house
officers.
The national also wanted to
house to make its pledge pro
gram conform to the national's
rules, raise the house grade
point average, and show finan
cial solvency.
The Phi Delts had some diffi
culties last fall, says Nordskog,
because the University had re

fused to let them rush new
members the previous spring,
during the suspension. The
house had twenty vacancies. A
fall rush brought in some new
members and boarders filled the
other vacancies.
"We have reorganized very
well this year," Nordskog says.
"I'll be the first to admit we
had a hell of a lot of problems
before the suspension. It was
justified. Now I'm very opti
mistic about the future."
Nordskog says the national's
representatives assured him last
weekend that a statement would
be adopted at the fratemiti's
August convention prohibiting
racial discrimination by any
chapter.
