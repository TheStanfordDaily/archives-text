# Widening Of Campus Dr.
## 
### 
Expansion of Campus Drive to
a divided highway between Gal
vez and Palm Drive began last
week and is expected to be com
pleted by commencement June
16.
The $96,000 project includes
remodeling of the intersections
at Galvez, Lasuen, and Palm
Drive with left-turn collector
lanes and high-intensity street
lighting, said Oscar Nelson,
master planner in charge of
roads for the Planning Office.
The project includes the bull
dozing over of what Nelson term
ed "displaced roads" in the Ar
boretum, used by generations
of students and picnickers seek
ing a shortcut.
The new link of Campus
Drive will have a landscaped me
dian strip.
Summertime plans call for the
eventual extension of the road
from its present terminus near
the Medical Center around the
west end of the campus to con
nect with Los Arboles Drive and
Junipero Serra Blvd. at the driv
ing range and entrance to the
golf course.
