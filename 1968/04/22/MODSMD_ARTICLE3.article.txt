# Lambda Nu Hosts Women Despite Some Opposition (?)
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
Clad in red polka dotted boxer
shorts, combat boots, a gas
mask, and a World War II Ger
man helmet, a Lambda Nu fra
ternity member attempted to
dissuade the entrance of pros
pective female residents as his
house held the first of two open
houses for women last night.
The shots from his toy ma
chine gun did not prevent more
than thirty women from exam
ining the Lambda Nu house and
asking questions about the fra
ternity's program of admitting
20 upperclass-women as resi
dents next fall.
Fraternity President Fred

Fudacz said the turnout was
much better than he had ex
pected. But he added that he
hopes that more women will
take the opportunity to be
come acquainted with the
Lambda Nu coed alternative.
This year's pledge class was
selected through Lambda Nu's
positive vote system, but the fe
male residents will be selected
as part of the campus-wide draw
in May.
A brother explained the pro
cess to one girl as a matter of
"leaving it up to the computer."
Most of the girls laughed off
the encounter with the machine
gun-toting "member of the old
guard' 'and announced that they
were "waiting to be rushed."
One house member re
sponded "I truthfully feel that
this Is better than rush."
Although the punch bowls
were present in the lounge, the
function was not intended to
proceed along the usual rush
lines. Less than a third of the
house was present to greet the
women, and it is doubtful that
rush fines will be invoked.
The usual tour through the
male residents' rooms, the din
ing room, the bar, the TV room,
and the view of Lake Lagunita
drew enthusiastic comments
from the women. "Wow, are we
impressed," said one girl.
House residents were at a
loss, however, when one girl
asked, "Where is the sewing
room?" One resident explained
there is an ironing board in one
of the closets.
Many of the girls who
showed up last night were no
strangers to the Lambda Nu
house. As one girl explained,
"There were six members of

the house In my overseas
group, and I have spent a lot
of time around here."
The girls who gathered to
talk with house members
pointed out areas that they
thought might need change
when women move in. One sug
gested that phones be set up
In the girls wing so that they
wouldn't have to answer calls
for the males.
While one house member
charged last night that the
move "would bring havoc down
upon us this fall," another mem
ber said he doubts there are
more than 10 opponents to the
move.
There will be a second open
house this Sunday. In addition,
those girls selected will partici
pate in a house hostel late in
May.
