# Heckled At USF
## Bobby Defends Talks Stand 
### DAN SNELL 
Sen. Robert Kennedy defended
President Johnson's refusal to
negotiate with the North Viet
namese in Pnom Penh, Cam
bodia, or in Warsaw, Poland,
on the grounds that in the form
er capital the U.S. has no em
bassy facilities and the latter
is not a neutral in the Vietnam
struggle.
He told a crowd at the Univer
sity of San Francisco Friday
night that it was "unforunate"
the Administration has had to
raise conditions after the state
ment was made that we would
negotiate anywhere, but that the
conditions were necessary.
As Kennedy entered the uni
versity's gymnasium, 45 minutes
after he was scheduled to begin
speaking, one heckler was
thrown out of the room when
he ran at Kennedy yelling that
he was a "fascist pig."
The crowd, predominantly
white and middle class, had
some hecklers in it, presumably
associated with the Peace and
Freedom Party.
Yesterday students at the uni
versity, a Catholic institution,
said they were planning to send
a letter of explanation to the
senator, saying that most of the
hecklers were not students at
the university.
Dispensing with his text,
Kennedy answered questions
from the floor of the gymna
sium. The San Francisco
CHKONICLE reported that
Kennedy did not use his text

because of intense heckling;
but this reporter observed
nothing of the sort.
The senator, continuing in his
campaign for the June 4 presi
dential primary, reiterated his
statement that the war in Viet
nam is more than a military
struggle.
The senator said that he want
ed to see self-determination for
the South Vietnamese people.
If elected President, Ken
nedy said he "did not expect
to give amnesty to men who
dsert from the armed forces
because of this war." He also
said he would give no specialj
privileges for return to those
who leave for Canada to es
cape the draft.
Speaking on the problems of
the cities, the senator said, "Vio
lence cannot be accepted." He
said the problems of the city
are basically problems of em
ployment and called for an in
tensified federal job-creating
program, a physical renovating
of the cities, and after that
giving tax incentives to the pri
vate sector to encourage firms
to hire the previously unem
ployable.
"We should move away
from the welfare system," he
said.
Asked if he favored lower
ing the voting age to 18, Ken
nedy replied, referring to his
young family, "Personally, I'd
like to lower it to about 6." He
said he would be in favor of
lowering the voting age to 18.
