# University To Control P.A.-Stanford Hospital
## 
### 
Stanford may take over full
control of the Palo Alto-Stan
ford Hospital if a plan proposed
by negotiators for the Univers
ity and City is approved Friday.
The agreement would enable
the University to own and oper
ate the hospital for both com
munity and medical school pa
tients. The documents will re
quire approval by both hosiptal
owners.
Terms agreed upon by City
and University negotiators were
based on a proposal submitted
to the City by University Presi
dent Wallace Sterling last Jan
uary. The chief negotiators were
City Manager George Morgan
and Dr. Robert J. Glaser, vice
president for medical affairs and
dean of the School of Medicine.
Morgan said the suggested
agreement "contains commit
ments for hospital services to

the residents and physicians of
the community in accordance
with those put forth by Presi
dent Sterling, and in some areas
exceeding the original proposal.
Dr. Glaser called the agree
ment "a very fair transaction
that will strengthen the basic
spirit of cooperation between
the Medical School and the City,
and will ensure continued high
quality care for Palo Alto resi
dents."
The main points of the agree
ment are the guarantees it pro
vides to the City in meeting its
objectives with respect to health
care of its citizens. It also guar
antees continued access to hos
pital facilities for all community
physicians now on the staff.
Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital is
owned jointly by the City and
the University. Palo Alto has
access to 220 beds in the main
420-bed hospital and 150 beds
in the nearby Hoover pavilion.
The City also leases 32 acres of
land from the University on
which the facilities are located.
The City has expressed the
desire "to get out of the hos
pital business." Stanford feels
that a single ownership would
enable its medical school to de
velop a true university hospital
that is responsive to the emerg
ing needs of medical education.
Under the terms of the agree

ment, Stanford will acquire
Palo Alto's holdings and will
operate the hospital, including
the Hoover Pavilion. The Uni
versity will grant staff priv
ileges to all communit physici
ans presently on the hospital
staff for the remainder of their
professional careers.
A total of 370 beds now used
by patients of community phys
icians will continue to be avail
able to them. Palo Alto resi
dents will be given admission
priorities in non-emergency
cases. In addition, community
doctors will have access to new
facilities that will be built by
the Medical School.
The University has agreed to
meet the payment schedule for
the City's hospital construction
bonds totalling $3.5 million in
principal and interest over a 19-
year period. In addition, Stan
ford would pay the City $500,000
in cash.
If Hoover Pavilion is closed
because of the availability of
150 beds elsewhere in the com
munity, provided by an agency
other than Stanford, another
$500,000 will be paid to the City.
The proposed agreement en
visions a unified medical staff.
Presently, the hospital has two
medical staffs—Palo Alto and
Stanford—each operating under
its own rules and by-laws.

cases. In addition, community
doctors will have access to new
facilities that will be built by
the Medical School.
The University has agreed to
meet the payment schedule for
the City's hospital construction
bonds totalling $3.5 million in
principal and interest over a 19-
year period. In addition, Stan
ford would pay the City $500,000
in cash.
If Hoover Pavilion is closed
because of the availability of
150 beds elsewhere in the com
munity, provided by an agency
other than Stanford, another
$500,000 will be paid to the City.
The proposed agreement en
visions a unified medical staff.
Presently, the hospital has two
medical staffs—Palo Alto and
Stanford—each operating under
its own rules and by-laws.
Stanford may take over full
control of the Palo Alto-Stan
ford Hospital if a plan proposed
by negotiators for the Univers
ity and City is approved Friday.
The agreement would enable
the University to own and oper
ate the hospital for both com
munity and medical school pa
tients. The documents will re
quire approval by both hosiptal
owners.
Terms agreed upon by City
and University negotiators were
based on a proposal submitted
to the City by University Presi
dent Wallace Sterling last Jan
uary. The chief negotiators were
City Manager George Morgan
and Dr. Robert J. Glaser, vice
president for medical affairs and
dean of the School of Medicine.
Morgan said the suggested
agreement "contains commit
ments for hospital services to

the residents and physicians of
the community in accordance
with those put forth by Presi
dent Sterling, and in some areas
exceeding the original proposal.
Dr. Glaser called the agree
ment "a very fair transaction
that will strengthen the basic
spirit of cooperation between
the Medical School and the City,
and will ensure continued high
quality care for Palo Alto resi
dents."
The main points of the agree
ment are the guarantees it pro
vides to the City in meeting its
objectives with respect to health
care of its citizens. It also guar
antees continued access to hos
pital facilities for all community
physicians now on the staff.
Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital is
owned jointly by the City and
the University. Palo Alto has
access to 220 beds in the main
420-bed hospital and 150 beds
in the nearby Hoover pavilion.
The City also leases 32 acres of
land from the University on
which the facilities are located.
The City has expressed the
desire "to get out of the hos
pital business." Stanford feels
that a single ownership would
enable its medical school to de
velop a true university hospital
that is responsive to the emerg
ing needs of medical education.
Under the terms of the agree

ment, Stanford will acquire
Palo Alto's holdings and will
operate the hospital, including
the Hoover Pavilion. The Uni
versity will grant staff priv
ileges to all communit physici
ans presently on the hospital
staff for the remainder of their
professional careers.
A total of 370 beds now used
by patients of community phys
icians will continue to be avail
able to them. Palo Alto resi
dents will be given admission
priorities in non-emergency
cases. In addition, community
doctors will have access to new
facilities that will be built by
the Medical School.

meet the payment schedule for
