tarized zone Sunday afternoon,
killing one U.S. soldier and
wounding three others, a U.S.
military spokesman said Mon
day.

tor. It was the second major
border incident in the area in
volving Communist North Ko
reans in a week.

tions Command soldiers — two
Americans and two South Ko
reans — were killed when they
were ambushed by Communist
raiders near the Panmunjom
conference site. Two other
American soldiers were wound
ed.

the eight Communist soldiers
who crossed the military de
marcation line were killed in

• I),K. Race Problem
LONDON (AP) — An anti-im

migration speech by a Conserv
ative leader touched off an up
roar Sunday that cost him his
position in the opposition party's
"shadow cabinet" and threat
ened to divide Britain over a
new racial bill.
The speech, delivered in Bir
mingham Saturday by Enoch
Powell, was viewed as evidence
of a widening split in Tory
ranks on racial issues. Powell,
leader of the right-wing Tory
faction, said Britain should bar
any more non-white immigrants
and pay those now here to
leave.
Conservative party chief Ed
ward Heath said Sunday night
Powell's remarks were "liable
to exacerbate racial tensions" in
Britain.
• Peace Talks . . . ?
TOKYO (AP) — North Viet
nam accused the United States
Sunday of "escalating" its con
ditions for the selection of a site
for preliminary talks aimed at
bringing peace in Vietnam.
Hanoi's Communist Party
newspaper Nhan Dan leveled
the charge and indicated the
North Vietnamese government
is still holding out for talks in
Phnom Penh, Cambodia, or
Warsaw, Poland. The United

States has cold-shouldered these
sites because it has no diplomat
ic relations with Cambodia and
because Warsaw, a Communist
capital, could not be considered
neutral.
• South Africa Out?
LAUSANNE, Switzerland
(AP) — The International
Olympic Committee's executive
board decided Sunday "it would
be most unwise for a South Afri
can team to participate in the
Mexican Games in October."
Avery Brundage, 80-yearold
American president of the IOC,
gave this information after a
two-day emergency session of
the nine-man executive board,
called after more than 40 na
tions, including Russia, had
threatened to boycott the Mexi
can Games.
The opposition to South Africa
was based on that country's po
licy of racial separation.
"It is unanmiously of the
opinion that it would be most
unwise for a South African team
to participate in the Games,"
Brundage said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The
decision for an all out push to
supply South Vietnamese troops
with the modern Ml 6 rifle came
nearly seven years after a De
fense Department study called

American eommenders in Viet
nam repeatedly asked for mop
lightweight, rapid-firing Ml6s.
But those requests, dating back
as far as Oct. 19, 1962, went un
filled or, at best, partially filled.
Meanwhile, the North Viet
namese, despite American bomb
ing raids .supplied their troops
and the Viet Cong with the So
viet-designed AK47 assault riflrv
With the AK47 Communist
troops can easilv outgun South
Vietnamese soldiers, armed with
World War II vintage Ml rifles
and carbines.

Beirne ended an eight-hour re
view of the strike with his exec
