# College Value Rebels
## 
### Max Lerner 
These are the weeks of the
most important invitations in
American society — the invita
tions to attend a college. Letters
from admission offices have been
arriving at homes all over the
nation, in cities, suburbs, small
towns, ghettos. They carry the
bursting lights of a Yes or the
gloom of a No or the suspended
limbo hope of a waiting-list May
be.
They are crucial invitations
because college and postgradu
ate education has become the
new imperative for social mo
bility and for an expressive life.
They are crucial, also, because
the university is no longer a
decorative, cultural arabesque
on the American landscape. It
is taking its place alongside the
business corporation as one of
the two central power institu
tions of American life, as wit
ness what has recently been
happening to Eugene McCarthy
and (in a negative way) to Rob
ert Kennedy.
Inevitably, the university is
the focus of the adolescent's
dreams. To "make" the univer
sity of one's choice is to be part
of the swirling currents of life;
to be rejected is, for a time, a
kind of death. Like it or not,
that is what is happening in the
inner world of the young — and,
therefore, of their parents, too.
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE
the tensions that beset the enter
ing college student. In the old
days the question was how will
the classes and grades would
go, and, for a girl, whether she
would find someone to marry.
Now the questions are more
compiev: how much political
activism and commitment will
here be? What about the drug
l 'bculture? For the girl, how

free a sex life will she lead, and
how openly? For the boy, what
will be his attitude toward the
draft when the time comes?
For both sexes and races, what
will thev feel about Nncrro f*»l.
low-students, about black power,
about the Afro-American socie
ties that are coming to promi
nence on every important cam
pus? And will they go on to
postgraduate training or find
work and a career right after
college?
These are hard questions.
They all have to do with the
problem of roots, ties and val
ues, or the lack of them. As I
see the best of the new college
generation, they are tearing up
roots, breaking ties and rebel
ling against established values.
But they are also looking to find
new roots, to form new ties and
develop values of their own.
The two groups whom Prof.
Keniston at Yale has so well
studied — the "uncommitted"
and the "young radicals" — don't
comprise the whole of the im
portant segment of the college
generation. There is a third,
less-defined, group which doesn't
fit well either into the category
of the estranged or the category
of the New Left. They are more
moderate about politics and "hip
piness." I call them the value
rebels, and I am convinced that
they will inherit the earth.
TAKE THE LINDA LECLAIR
CASE at Barnard College as a
starting point. Outwardly, it
looks, at least to many parents,
as if the larger part of the Bar
nard girls are living in unsanc
tioned sin. Linda had set up
house more or less openly with
a Columbia junior, but had lied
to the Barnard authorities about
her residence and her job. She

is up for a hearing before a
mixed board, largely of stu
dents, with some faculty and ad
ministration on it, and faces pos
sible suspension. Sixty other
Barnard girls have signed a
statement saying that if Linda
is guilty they are, too, because
they have been doing much the
same thing.
This is in itself an interesting
event, an outgrowth of the draft
resistance movement at various
colleges. In effect, it is the tac
tic of shared guilt, as a form
of participatory rebellion, if not
participatory democracy. What
they are saying is, "Don't expel
one, expel us all," on the theory
that if one is guilty, everyone is.
In moral terms, while it says
that the sexual code is no longer
there, it fails to deal with the
question of truthfulness. If you
allow yourself to lie about where
you live, then why not about
term papers, exams and the
whole relation of a student to
his work? It is this question of
integrity, rather than the ques
tion of the sexual code, which

is at the heart of it. And on this
question the value rebels, who
are re-examining the draft, mari
juana, sexual behavior and al
most everything else, are likely
to come down squarely on the
side of truthfulness, with others
as with oneself.
I LIKE THE EMPHASIS on
the right of privacy which I
find among many students to
day, The trouble with the Le-
Clair case on this score is that
the one unquestioned victim of
it has been privacy. My own ap
proach on the question of codes
is that codes are needed for a
life with meaning, just as roots
and values are needed, but that
they don't have to be the codes
of a past age.
As the girls and boys grow
into men and women, they will
find codes and roots and values
of their own. To help them do
this, the college must mean
while bring the students into
the rule-making process and then
ask them to live up to the rules
they have themselves shared in
making.

colleges. In effect, it is the tac
tic of shared guilt, as a form
of participatory rebellion, if not
participatory democracy. What
they are saying is, "Don't expel
one, expel us all," on the theory
that if one is guilty, everyone is.
In moral terms, while it says
that the sexual code is no longer
there, it fails to deal with the
question of truthfulness. If you
allow yourself to lie about where
you live, then why not about
term papers, exams and the
whole relation of a student to
his work? It is this question of
integrity, rather than the ques
tion of the sexual code, which

is at the heart of it. And on this
question the value rebels, who
are re-examining the draft, mari
juana, sexual behavior and al
most everything else, are likely
to come down squarely on the
side of truthfulness, with others
as with oneself.
I LIKE THE EMPHASIS on
the right of privacy which I
find among many students to
day, The trouble with the Le-
Clair case on this score is that
the one unquestioned victim of
it has been privacy. My own ap
proach on the question of codes
is that codes are needed for a
life with meaning, just as roots
and values are needed, but that
they don't have to be the codes
of a past age.
As the girls and boys grow
into men and women, they will
find codes and roots and values
of their own. To help them do
this, the college must mean
while bring the students into
the rule-making process and then
ask them to live up to the rules
they have themselves shared in
making.

These are the weeks of the
most important invitations in
American society — the invita
tions to attend a college. Letters
from admission offices have been
arriving at homes all over the
nation, in cities, suburbs, small
towns, ghettos. They carry the
bursting lights of a Yes or the
gloom of a No or the suspended
limbo hope of a waiting-list May
be.
They are crucial invitations
because college and postgradu
ate education has become the
new imperative for social mo
bility and for an expressive life.
They are crucial, also, because
the university is no longer a
decorative, cultural arabesque
on the American landscape. It
is taking its place alongside the
business corporation as one of
the two central power institu
tions of American life, as wit
ness what has recently been
happening to Eugene McCarthy
and (in a negative way) to Rob
ert Kennedy.
Inevitably, the university is
the focus of the adolescent's
dreams. To "make" the univer
sity of one's choice is to be part
of the swirling currents of life;
to be rejected is, for a time, a
kind of death. Like it or not,
that is what is happening in the
inner world of the young — and,
therefore, of their parents, too.
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE
the tensions that beset the enter
ing college student. In the old
days the question was how will
the classes and grades would
go, and, for a girl, whether she
would find someone to marry.
Now the questions are more
compiev: how much political
activism and commitment will
here be? What about the drug
l 'bculture? For the girl, how

free a sex life will she lead, and
how openly? For the boy, what
will be his attitude toward the
draft when the time comes?
For both sexes and races, what
will thev feel about Nncrro f*»l.
low-students, about black power,
about the Afro-American socie
ties that are coming to promi
nence on every important cam
pus? And will they go on to
postgraduate training or find
work and a career right after
college?
These are hard questions.
They all have to do with the
problem of roots, ties and val
ues, or the lack of them. As I
see the best of the new college
generation, they are tearing up
roots, breaking ties and rebel
ling against established values.
But they are also looking to find
new roots, to form new ties and
develop values of their own.
The two groups whom Prof.
Keniston at Yale has so well
studied — the "uncommitted"
and the "young radicals" — don't
comprise the whole of the im
portant segment of the college
generation. There is a third,
less-defined, group which doesn't
fit well either into the category
of the estranged or the category
of the New Left. They are more
moderate about politics and "hip
piness." I call them the value
rebels, and I am convinced that
they will inherit the earth.
TAKE THE LINDA LECLAIR
CASE at Barnard College as a
starting point. Outwardly, it
looks, at least to many parents,
as if the larger part of the Bar
nard girls are living in unsanc
tioned sin. Linda had set up
house more or less openly with
a Columbia junior, but had lied
to the Barnard authorities about
her residence and her job. She

is up for a hearing before a
mixed board, largely of stu
dents, with some faculty and ad
ministration on it, and faces pos
sible suspension. Sixty other
Barnard girls have signed a
statement saying that if Linda
is guilty they are, too, because
they have been doing much the
same thing.

work and a career right after
college?
These are hard questions.
They all have to do with the
problem of roots, ties and val
ues, or the lack of them. As I
see the best of the new college
generation, they are tearing up
roots, breaking ties and rebel
ling against established values.
But they are also looking to find
new roots, to form new ties and
develop values of their own.
The two groups whom Prof.
Keniston at Yale has so well
studied — the "uncommitted"
and the "young radicals" — don't
comprise the whole of the im
portant segment of the college
generation. There is a third,
less-defined, group which doesn't
fit well either into the category
of the estranged or the category
of the New Left. They are more
moderate about politics and "hip
piness." I call them the value
rebels, and I am convinced that
they will inherit the earth.
TAKE THE LINDA LECLAIR
CASE at Barnard College as a
starting point. Outwardly, it
looks, at least to many parents,
as if the larger part of the Bar
nard girls are living in unsanc
tioned sin. Linda had set up
house more or less openly with
a Columbia junior, but had lied
to the Barnard authorities about
her residence and her job. She

is up for a hearing before a
mixed board, largely of stu
dents, with some faculty and ad
ministration on it, and faces pos
sible suspension. Sixty other
Barnard girls have signed a
statement saying that if Linda
is guilty they are, too, because
they have been doing much the
same thing.
This is in itself an interesting
event, an outgrowth of the draft
resistance movement at various
colleges. In effect, it is the tac
tic of shared guilt, as a form
of participatory rebellion, if not
participatory democracy. What
they are saying is, "Don't expel
one, expel us all," on the theory
that if one is guilty, everyone is.
In moral terms, while it says
that the sexual code is no longer
there, it fails to deal with the
question of truthfulness. If you
allow yourself to lie about where
you live, then why not about
term papers, exams and the
whole relation of a student to
his work? It is this question of
integrity, rather than the ques
tion of the sexual code, which

is at the heart of it. And on this
question the value rebels, who
are re-examining the draft, mari
juana, sexual behavior and al
most everything else, are likely
to come down squarely on the
side of truthfulness, with others
as with oneself.
I LIKE THE EMPHASIS on
the right of privacy which I
find among many students to
day, The trouble with the Le-
Clair case on this score is that
the one unquestioned victim of
it has been privacy. My own ap
proach on the question of codes
is that codes are needed for a
life with meaning, just as roots
and values are needed, but that
they don't have to be the codes
of a past age.
As the girls and boys grow
into men and women, they will
find codes and roots and values
of their own. To help them do
this, the college must mean
while bring the students into
the rule-making process and then
ask them to live up to the rules
they have themselves shared in
making.

These are the weeks of the
most important invitations in
American society — the invita
tions to attend a college. Letters
from admission offices have been
arriving at homes all over the
nation, in cities, suburbs, small
towns, ghettos. They carry the
bursting lights of a Yes or the
gloom of a No or the suspended
limbo hope of a waiting-list May
be.
They are crucial invitations
because college and postgradu
ate education has become the
new imperative for social mo
bility and for an expressive life.
They are crucial, also, because
the university is no longer a
decorative, cultural arabesque
on the American landscape. It
is taking its place alongside the
business corporation as one of
the two central power institu
tions of American life, as wit
ness what has recently been
happening to Eugene McCarthy
and (in a negative way) to Rob
ert Kennedy.
Inevitably, the university is
the focus of the adolescent's
dreams. To "make" the univer
sity of one's choice is to be part
of the swirling currents of life;
to be rejected is, for a time, a
kind of death. Like it or not,
that is what is happening in the
inner world of the young — and,
therefore, of their parents, too.
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE
the tensions that beset the enter
ing college student. In the old
days the question was how will
the classes and grades would
go, and, for a girl, whether she
would find someone to marry.
Now the questions are more
compiev: how much political
activism and commitment will
here be? What about the drug
l 'bculture? For the girl, how

free a sex life will she lead, and
how openly? For the boy, what
will be his attitude toward the
draft when the time comes?
For both sexes and races, what
will thev feel about Nncrro f*»l.
