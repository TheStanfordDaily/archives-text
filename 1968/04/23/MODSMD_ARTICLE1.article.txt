# Jordan Denies Quotes
## Ramparts Says Coach Jordan Called Edwards A Communist 
### PATRICK McMAHON 
Copyright 1968 . The Stanford Daily
Ramparts magazine in its
April • May issue quotes Stan
ford Olympic coach Payton Jor
dan as saying that Harry Ed
wards, leader of the black Olym
pic boycott, is a communist.
Jordan, however, yesterday

denied making such a statement
and denied four of the five oth
er quotations attributed to him.
The article quotes Jordan:
"I've been reading material by
the House Committee on Un-
American Activities and I can
see that Edwards is a commie.
And I wouldn't be surprised if
Tommie Smith and Lee Evans
(San Jose State boycotting ath
letes) were also communists....
If Edwards wanted to go to
Russia, I'd give him $1,500 out of
my own pocket."
The author of the article

("The White Olympics"), Is
Jack Scott, a former Stanford
track athlete and a Ph.D. can
didate in psychology at Ber
keley. He devotes one section
of the article to Jordan as
Olympic track coach.
He discusses the incident in
which Jordan threw a star
sprinter off the team because of
the athlete's long hair. He also
describes Jordan's views on Ne
gro athletic recruiting and No
groes in general.
Ramparts contrasts other
Stanford teams to the track
team, pointing out that there are

no black students on the team
with track scholarships.
"I will never make a special
effort to recruit colored boys,
that would be discriminating
against whites," said Jordan, ac
cording to Ramparts.
Other quotations attributed by
Ramparts' sources to Jordan
are:
• ll l've always gotten on
well with colored folks; some
of my best friends are color
ed."
• "I'm really upset over this
nigger problem."
• "You can always tell a
coon by the way he laughs."
Jordan denies having made
any of these remarks. The only
statement he acknowledges as
his own is "It's too bad that th"
liberal loudmouth gets all
attention, and the person who
speaks rationally is not heard."
This is a quote from an articl 1
written by Jordan for a track
magazine, according to Scott.
Scott told the Daily that Pay
ton Jordan also told him four
weeks ago the certain black
power leaders "are nothing but
common criminals. Haven't they
been arrested more times than
you can count? Onr> polite
humble Jesse Owens has done
more for colored people than
any ten modern leaders."
The long hair incident, which
occurred in the spring of 1966,
came about when Coach Jordan
threw freshman Patrick Morri
son, a 100 and 220 yard dash
Stanford record-holder, off the
team for his "Beatle" haircut.
Jordan said that he did it for
team spirit and invalidated the
records Morrison had set.
Consequently, numerous ath
letes protested and quit the
team. One of the athletes who
quit was Rhodes scholar Dell
Martin, now a Wilbur spon
sor. Jordan wrote Martin's

parents in a letter concerning
the incident which is qnited
in the article:
"I firmly believe our country
is going through an era in which
fundamental values, laws and
free institutions (and I include
Stanford) are under attack. This
Morrison case, trite as it might
first appear, is nevertheless a
manifestation of this nationwide
philosophic anarchy.
"I have become convinced that
if America is to survive these
attacks, we will need a renewal
of respect for law and orderly
process . . .Fine young men,
like your son, should not be
duped and then follow like
sheep behind men like young
David Harris and Morrison."
Martin said yesterday after
noon he felt the letter repre
sented Jordan's "patriarehical
authoritarianism that he car
ries out on to the field" and that
Jordan saw him (Martin) "not
as a runner on his team, but
something to be manipulated
through mv parents."
The DAILY learned Monday
that Jordan also wrote letters
to several other parents of the
traek squad the spring.
Joseph Higglns, director of
Wilbur and Branner, and form
er director of intramural ath
letics, is also quoted in the Ram
parts article.
"Since Payton Jordan cannot
seem to get along with middle
class white athletes here at Stan
ford, one cannot help but wonder
what will happen when ho has
to work with black athletes on
the U.S. Olympic team," Higgins
says in the article.
The article deals generally
with the Olympic boycott and
the parts that Harry Edwards,
Payton Jordan, and Avery Brun
dage (head of the International
Olympic Committee have played
in the controversy.
