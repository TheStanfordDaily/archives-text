# Goodies On Sale
## Workshop Worth 15c 
### DAN SNELL 
The Workshop Magazine, be
ing sold today on campus, is the
latest mimeoed batch of goodies
prepared with a view to the ex
pression of student literary art.
And it is worth the 15 cents
it costs.

But that is not to say that you
will be lulled into a false sense
of the beautiful by the two ar
ticles that deal with suicide.
By far the best of the three
works in the magazine is "But
The Idiot Just Sat There," a
story by Dow Harvey. Taking

place at some sort of student
function, the story traces a con
versation between a boy and a
girl as they boy gets slightly
drunk.
Harvey plays with his images
of sex and honesty and art — the
art of using language to mani
pulate people. The main char
acter's friend has recently com
mitted suicide and has left a
paper in which attacks the un
reality, the dishonesty of the
world around him.
The character refers to the
paper and uses it to do the
very thing the dead friend de
spised — to manipulate some-}
one, to play the games people
play. For Harvey's character
the suicide was a "rational
death," properly motivated by
the lying world, but he is us
ing it now as "a tool" to make
himself seem wise and won
derful to the girl.
And Harvey is using his "tool"
— language — very successful
ly. As the lad grows more drunk,
he plays the part of a show
salesman and of the "fair prince"
of Cinderella, "beautiful" games
that he loved," as Harvey ob
serves. And using "well-planned
words," the student attains his
end.
The irony is cutting, and the
words are often well-chosen, but
Harvey's story seems longer
and more pedantic than it needed
to be.
The other story using suicide
as a theme, "The Far Side of the
Hill," by Marshall Lee, shows
little understanding of motiva
tions and has rather simplistic
analyses of actions.
A girl is "a plastic doll,"
and the hall-mate who would-f
n't talk to Abram, the student
contemplating suicide, is "Fred
laughing in rhythm, Fred the
joker, no more. He'd show him
no one cared for jokers."
The identification of death
with home and mother and with
Hoover Tower are hardly engag
ing. A more severe critic would
call them trite. But the picture
of the Mathematician as Deity
shows the imagination Lee does
possess.
Lisa Fount's poem "Taking
On Shapes" is a piece deserving
much study in spite of the styliz
ed repetition of the ambiguous
phrase "It is ..." at the begin
ning of four lines. The vision of
reality as demanding completion
by the actions of persons is very
well presented, and the poet has
a good ear for the rythmic unit
that seems to curl up and com
plete the sense unit.
As usual with "Workshop",
mimeographing damages the
potential of the content, and
for this reason drawings in)
this issue are not worth the
trouble they must have caused
the staff.
A little closer editing might
have eliminated some of the clut
ter in both the stories in the
magazine, but on the whole the
staff has done a fair job.

to be.
The other story using suicide
as a theme, "The Far Side of the
Hill," by Marshall Lee, shows
little understanding of motiva
tions and has rather simplistic
analyses of actions.
A girl is "a plastic doll,"
and the hall-mate who would-f
n't talk to Abram, the student
contemplating suicide, is "Fred
laughing in rhythm, Fred the
joker, no more. He'd show him
no one cared for jokers."
The identification of death
with home and mother and with
Hoover Tower are hardly engag
ing. A more severe critic would
call them trite. But the picture
of the Mathematician as Deity
shows the imagination Lee does
possess.
Lisa Fount's poem "Taking
On Shapes" is a piece deserving
much study in spite of the styliz
ed repetition of the ambiguous
phrase "It is ..." at the begin
ning of four lines. The vision of
reality as demanding completion
by the actions of persons is very
well presented, and the poet has
a good ear for the rythmic unit
that seems to curl up and com
plete the sense unit.
As usual with "Workshop",
mimeographing damages the
potential of the content, and
for this reason drawings in)
this issue are not worth the
trouble they must have caused
the staff.
A little closer editing might
have eliminated some of the clut
ter in both the stories in the
magazine, but on the whole the
staff has done a fair job.
The Workshop Magazine, be
ing sold today on campus, is the
latest mimeoed batch of goodies
prepared with a view to the ex
pression of student literary art.
And it is worth the 15 cents
it costs.

But that is not to say that you
will be lulled into a false sense
of the beautiful by the two ar
ticles that deal with suicide.
By far the best of the three
works in the magazine is "But
The Idiot Just Sat There," a
story by Dow Harvey. Taking

place at some sort of student
function, the story traces a con
versation between a boy and a
girl as they boy gets slightly
drunk.
Harvey plays with his images
of sex and honesty and art — the
art of using language to mani
pulate people. The main char
acter's friend has recently com
mitted suicide and has left a
paper in which attacks the un
reality, the dishonesty of the
world around him.
The character refers to the
paper and uses it to do the
very thing the dead friend de
spised — to manipulate some-}
one, to play the games people
play. For Harvey's character
the suicide was a "rational
death," properly motivated by
the lying world, but he is us
ing it now as "a tool" to make
himself seem wise and won
derful to the girl.
And Harvey is using his "tool"
— language — very successful
ly. As the lad grows more drunk,
he plays the part of a show
salesman and of the "fair prince"
of Cinderella, "beautiful" games
that he loved," as Harvey ob
serves. And using "well-planned
words," the student attains his
end.
The irony is cutting, and the
words are often well-chosen, but
Harvey's story seems longer
and more pedantic than it needed
to be.
