Hatfield says voluntary mili
tary service is the answer to
high turnover rate and low mor
ale of the armed services.

Lyndon Johnson
Democrat
President Johnson's long ten
ure in office has resulted in his
name remaining on the Choice
'68 ballot although he has de
clared he will not run.
To deal with unprecedented
foreign and domestic crises he
has sought far reaching legis
lation to provide low and middle
income housing, jobs for hard
core unemployed, and a tax sur
charge.
Johnson has looked for con
crete proof of North Vietnamese
sincerity before entering peace
negotiations.

Robert Kennedy

Robert Kennedy has served
as a Senator from New York and
as Attorney General. Domestical
ly, he has co-sponsored a num
ber of civil rights and urban im
provement bills.
In foreign affairs he has open
ly criticized the Administration's
Vietnam policy since 1965. In ad
dition to de-escalation, he calls
for the National Liberation

power.
Though he has been accused
of being "ruthless," he has an
tagonized organized labor by
prosecuting labor racketeer
Jimmy Hoffa. He also has sup

John lAnd say
Republican
Since 1965, John V. Lindsay
has been mayor of New York
City.
In his first term he has work
ed to achieve harmonious inter
group relations as a solution to
many urban problems.
Thus far, he has avoided tak
ing strong stands on national or
international issues. He was a
member of the Kerner commis
sion which blamed many of the
riots in American cities on
"white racism."
The City of New York has
been a leader in public housing
in this country. Yet it is distinc

multi-story structure in favor
of the well-integrated "vest

★ ★ ★
Eugene McCarthy
Democrat
Senator Eugene McCarthy has
an impressive voting and lead
ership record on both domestic
and foreign policy. He has spon
sored and led the fight for every
major piece oi civil rights legi
slation.
He has been a leading oppon
ent not only of our Vietnam pol
icy but also of our short-sighted
policies around the world. He is
both concerned about the qual
ified to deal with foreign-policy
questions of long term impor
tance such as arms control and
the emerging nations.
The reason that he is to be
preferred to Robert Kennedy is
not so much because of policy
differences, but because he is a
man who can be trusted not to
tamper with our political sys
tem in ways that seem expedient
but which are in the long run a
serious threat.

Richard Nixon
Republican
The United States has been
floundering. Lyndon Johnson,
thought to be the most effective
politician in the country, has
not been able to steer the ship
of state away from the shoals
of despair. It appears that,
should they be elected, most of
the other candidates would have
to spend a year, maybe two, on
on-the-job training.
The nation needs a man of
force and direction, one who has
the strength, the experience, the
political and diplomatic know
how, to lead the United States
spiritually and morally, to give
direction to the vast bureaucratic
morass that is Federal govern
ment, to direct the course of
this nation as the leader of the
free world.

Charles Percy
Republican
Few men in Washington have
been as much a real-life incar
nation of the legendary ail-
American hero, who rises from
poverty to fame and fortune

through sheer diligence, than
Charles Percy Indeed, it is Per
cy's rapid rise through the ranks
in business that has made him
after only two years in the Sen
ate a potential candidate for
President.
As Senator, Percy has shown
none of the usual freshman reti
cence. He has been critical of
the American bombing policy
and suggested that the Presi
dent be required to submit an
nually reports outlining the na
tion's foreign commitments.
He has encouraged more com
mercial and cultural contacts
with Communist nations, and
has sponsored a bill enabling
slum-dwellers to obtain funds
to remodel and buy their own
homes at low repayment
charges, a bill which the Admin
istration accepted in part.
★ ★ ★
Ronald Reagan
Republican
Ronald Reagan is a realist. He
has the ability to reach people.
He can communicate his con
cern to people. Reagan has the
leadership ability the U.S. most
desperately needs. And he can
win. History has shown us that
experience in the federal gov
ernment does not, alone and in
itself, make for a great Pres
ident. Intelligent men learn
quickly how to operate the pure
ly mechanical aspects of the
President. What really counts
are the principles and convic
tions brought into that office.
★ ★ ★
Nelson Rockefeller
Republican
Nelson Rockefeller has been
governor of New York since
1959. In a series of lectures given
at Harvard University, Rocke
feller enunciated his federalist
viewpoint:
"The federal idea, what does
this mean? Our federal idea
is complex and subtle. It in
volves a balance of strengths
It demands faith in — and an
environment for — the free play
of individual initiative, private
enterprise, social institutions, po
litical organizations, and volun
tary associations ... a federal
system, then, seeks stability
without rigidity, security with
out inertia. It encourages inno
vation and inventiveness — gov
erned by principle, and guided
by purpose. ..."

George Wallace
American Independent
George C. Wallace has been a
leading exponent of the "South
ern point of view" on civil rights.
He has consistently said not
only civil rights matters, but
most public issues such as em
ployment and education, are
best handled at the state and
local levels of government.
To non-Southerners, Wallace
is known chiefly for his oppo
sition to integration of Ala
bama's schools and the federal
intervention to bring it about.
He has, however, brought
about a number of economic and
educational improvements for
Alabama during his career in
the state legislature and state

Thus far, he has avoided tak

member of the Kerner commis

The City of New York has

policies around the world. He is
both concerned about the qual

The nation needs a man of

Eugene McCarthy

The reason that he is to be

Ronald Reagan
Republican
Ronald Reagan is a realist. He
has the ability to reach people.
He can communicate his con
cern to people. Reagan has the
leadership ability the U.S. most
desperately needs. And he can
win. History has shown us that
experience in the federal gov
ernment does not, alone and in
itself, make for a great Pres
ident. Intelligent men learn
quickly how to operate the pure
ly mechanical aspects of the
President. What really counts
are the principles and convic
tions brought into that office.

Nelson Rockefeller
Republican
Nelson Rockefeller has been
governor of New York since
1959. In a series of lectures given
at Harvard University, Rocke
feller enunciated his federalist
viewpoint:
"The federal idea, what does
this mean? Our federal idea
is complex and subtle. It in
volves a balance of strengths
It demands faith in — and an
environment for — the free play
of individual initiative, private
enterprise, social institutions, po
litical organizations, and volun
tary associations ... a federal
system, then, seeks stability
without rigidity, security with
out inertia. It encourages inno
vation and inventiveness — gov
erned by principle, and guided
by purpose. ..."

George Wallace
American Independent
George C. Wallace has been a
leading exponent of the "South
ern point of view" on civil rights.
He has consistently said not
only civil rights matters, but
most public issues such as em
ployment and education, are
best handled at the state and
local levels of government.
To non-Southerners, Wallace
is known chiefly for his oppo
sition to integration of Ala
bama's schools and the federal
intervention to bring it about.
He has, however, brought
about a number of economic and
educational improvements for
Alabama during his career in
the state legislature and state
house.
