# Employees Forming Union To Better Pay, Conditions
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Stanford, having only recent
ly resolved difficulties with the
graduate students' union, may
soon have new problems from
another fledgling union.
Workers in the physical plant
are trying to organize 4,000
nonteaching employees into a
Stanford University Employees
'Association (SUEA).
The aim of the new group Is
"promoting the general wel
fare and best Interests of em
ployees and establishing and
maintaining a spirit of friend
ly cooperation among em
ployees, administrators, and
trustees," according to Jerry
Sloan, an air conditioning tech
nician In the ventilation de4
partment and head of SUEA's
steering committee.
Sloan said the group would
not be affiliated with any outside
union. "We're trying to keep it
internal," he said.
SUEA will be patterned after
the California School Employees
Association (CSEA), a 37,000-
member group that represents
public school employees in the
state.
Along these lines, committees

will be formed to investigate the
various complaints of the em
ployees.
Included in the complaints
are wages, working conditions,
and the lack of a formal griev
ance structure.
"Wages are lower here" than
at companies in the area, accord
ing to Charles A. (Bud) Meyer,
an electrician and member of
SUEA's steering committee.
~An exact comparison of sal
aries here and at various pen
insula firms will be made by a
committee, Sloan said, and pre
sented to the University.
Already Stanford has propos
ed a four per cent increase in
salaries for next year, Sloan
said.
"But this was only after we
got together" to form the union,
Meyer noted.
A similar improvement has
been made In the grievance
structure because of the pres
enc of the new group. Sloan
noted that previously an em
ployee could expect nothing If
he went to his superior with
a complaint.
But now, "according to the
upper staff, we have the privi

lege of coming in to talk these
things over, which we feel is a
lot better understanding than
we had in the past," he said.
Another complaint is the fact
that "Stanford doesn't really
pay for any of our medical" ex
penses now, Sloan added.
A meeting will be held May
15 for all those interested in the
group to pick officers and com
mittees and write a constitution
and by-laws.
Sloan claims to have gather
ed 200 signatures from em
ployes, all In the physical plant
departments, in support of the
new group, but says many
more have expressed interest.
"With a force of all the em
ployees behind us we certainly
have a chance to let these pro
posals be known, and have a
chance to get something out of
it," Sloan said.
He noted the group has no
plans for a strike in the forsee
able future.
"We don't particularly want
to advocate a strike," he said.
"But with this kind of strength
behind us, we could very well
have a strike if some of our pro
posals aren't thoroughly looked
into."
