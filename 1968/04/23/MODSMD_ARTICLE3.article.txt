# No job Deferments For Stanford TA's
## 
### THOMAS DAWSON 
It is unlikely that Stanford
will seek occupational defer
ments for its teaching assistants,
it was learned yesterday.
Several eastern universities
including Cornell have announc
ed their intention to ask local
draft boards to grant occupa
tional deferments to their grad
uate teaching assistants. Cor
nell has also announced that it
would appeal any 1-A classifi
cations given its teaching assis
tants.
However, Stanford's Dean of
the Graduate Division Virgil K.
Whitaker said yesterday that he
considered it very unlikely that
Stanford would seek similar de
ferments.
The idea behind such defer
ments is that teaching assis
tants are primarily teachers
and thus eligible for occupa
tional deferments at the dis

cretion of the individual lo
cal draft board.
Whitaker told the Daily that
he, Vice-Provost Howard Brooks
and physics Prof. William Fair
bank met with California
state director of the Soloctiw
System last week on the subiert
of deferments for teaching as
sistants. Whitaker reported that
the director had given them
little reason for hoping such
deferments might be granted.
Harvard ten days ago an
nounced that it would not seek
deferments for its "teaching fel
lows" who hold positions similar
to teaching assistants at Stan
ford.
Harvard's Dean of the Grad
uate School of Arts and Sciences
J. P. Elder pointed out that it
would be unethical to certify
to some agencies that teaching
assistants are teachers while at
the same time certifying to other
agencies that they are students.
Such a case would arise in the
case of many fellowships which
place restrictions on the amount
of time recipients may spend
teaching.
Whitaker also told the
DAILY that there would be a
meeting of department and
division heads in the next few
days to make a final decision
of the matter of deferments.
Whitaker emphasized however
that he anticipated no re
quests for deferment of all
teaching assistants liable to
the draft.
Most of the teaching assis
tants who will be liable for the
draft are this year's first year
graduate students. Many depart
ments have a policy of only al
lowing advanced graduate stu
dents teaching positions, but
several departments particular
ly in the sciences use first year
students as lab instructors.
Harvard reported that it could
not in good conscience request
deferments for only the teach
ing assistants in the sciences,
since it would "virtually be ar
guing that some disciplines
should be recognized as sanctu
aries."
Whitaker did report, however,
that there was a possibility that
the University would ask for
a few deferments "in special
cases."
