## Censorship For Minors Ok'd 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Supreme Court told the states
Monday they have a right—even
a duty—to decide what kind of
sex material youngsters may
see and read.
"The well-being of its children
is of course a subject within the
state's constitutional power to
regulate," Justice William J.
Brennan Jr. said in a 6-3 deci
sion.
The ruling was the court's
first venture into a growing kind
of antipornography law—one de
signed especially for children.
A New York statute was spe
cifically endorsed. And in a
companion case, the court
threw out a Dallas ordinance
geared to movies, because the
justices found the classification
standards vague.
• Viet War Alert
SAIGON (AP) — South Viet
nam's army in Saigon and 11
outlying provinces was ordered
on full alert Monday, apparently
because incidents of the past
three days convinced officials
the enemy is about to launch a
second big offensive against the
capital.
Key sources laid the alert to a
case of war jitters. A U.S. mis
sion spokesman said: "No alert
or any warning has been issued
to American personnel."
Another source said U.S. mili
tary police in Saigon had been
told to exercise caution in the
next few days. Marine guards at
the U.S. Embassy were briefed
on Vietnamese intelligence re
ports, but the source described
this as routine.
• I\o Pueblo Trade
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
State Department today ruled
out ransom to obtain the return
of the 82-man crew of the U.S.
Navy intelligence ship Pueblo
which was seized Jan. 23 by
North Korean gunboats.
At the same time, a 15th pri
vate meeting was held in Pan
munjom between U.S. and
North Korean representatives
on the Pueblo deadlock. There
was no hint of a breakthrough
for the release of the ship or
crew.
State Department press offi
cer Robert J. McCloskey said he
expected there would be addi
tional meetings.
When asked about reports
that the United States might of
fer construction equipment, food
or medicines as ransom for the

Pueblo crew, McCloskey said,
"That is not correct and I know
of no inclination on the part of
this government to take such a
step."
• Panthers In Court
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)—Six
teen Black Panthers Monday
asked a federal court injunction
banning harassment by the Oak
land police department and the
Alameda County district attor
ney.
The injunction complaint
charged that the Oakland police
"for two years have made a con
certed effort" to wipe out the
militant Negro group.
Charles Garry, attorney for
Bobby Seale, 31, filed the federal
court action after asking dis
missal in Alameda county Super
ior Court of counts charging
Seale with illegal possession of
firearms.
• Strike Bill Shelved
SACRAMENTO (AP) — An
Assembly committee virtually
killed Monday the key bill in
labor's 1968 legislative campaign
— a measure to outlaw the use
of professional strikebreakers by
strikebound companies.
The Assembly Industrial Rela
tions Committee voted to keep
the bill under submission — in
effect killing its chances of com
ing before the legislature again
this session.
Author of the measure, Assem
blyman Edward E. Elliott, D-
Los Angeles, admitted to the
committee that he did not per
sonally like the bill. He ex
plained it was submitted to him
by the California Labor Feder
ation.
• S. Africa Protests
JOHANNESBURG, South Af
rica (AP) — The South African
member of the International
Olympic Committee called on
all members of the lOC's execu
tive board Monday to resign.
Reg Honey termed the action
of the board "illegal and im
moral," in unanimously recom
mending that South Africa be
barred from the summer games
at Mexico City in October.
The nine-man board, in an ex
traordinary meeting at Lau
sanne over the weekend, bowed
to tremendous pressure and
unanmiously urged the lOC
membership to reverse a pre
vious stand and bar South Afri
ca from the Games.

• Secret Research Hit
WASHINGTON (AP)—A Uni
versity of California nuclear
physicist urged Monday that all
secret research projects for the
government be removed from
university campuses so as to
prevent "erosion of university
standards."
Dr. John O. Rasmussen, of
UC's Berkeley campus, suggest
ed that all such secret projects,
in nuclear or other fields, be
relegated to separate off-cam
pus laboratories, such as the
Livermore, Calif., nuclear wea
pons laboratory.
•War Reduction Seen
NEW YORK (AP) — Defense
Secretary Clark M. Clifford said
Monday increased effectiveness
of South Vietnamese forces will
now enable the United States to
level off its war effort "and in
due time to begin the gradual
process of reduction."
Clifford offered no timetable

as he appeared before the an

the Associated Press, for his
first public address since he be
came Secretary of Defense sev

have raised the possibility of a
withdrawal of American troops
beginning in 1969.

WASHINGTON (AP)—A Uni

Monday they have a right—even

"The well-being of its children

SAIGON (AP) — South Viet

Key sources laid the alert to a

Another source said U.S. mili

Monday they have a right—even

"The well-being of its children

• Viet War Alert
SAIGON (AP) — South Viet
nam's army in Saigon and 11
outlying provinces was ordered
on full alert Monday, apparently
because incidents of the past
three days convinced officials
the enemy is about to launch a
second big offensive against the
capital.
Key sources laid the alert to a
case of war jitters. A U.S. mis
sion spokesman said: "No alert
or any warning has been issued
to American personnel."
Another source said U.S. mili
tary police in Saigon had been
told to exercise caution in the
next few days. Marine guards at
the U.S. Embassy were briefed
on Vietnamese intelligence re
ports, but the source described
this as routine.
• I\o Pueblo Trade
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
State Department today ruled
out ransom to obtain the return
of the 82-man crew of the U.S.
Navy intelligence ship Pueblo
which was seized Jan. 23 by
North Korean gunboats.
At the same time, a 15th pri
vate meeting was held in Pan
munjom between U.S. and
North Korean representatives
on the Pueblo deadlock. There
was no hint of a breakthrough
for the release of the ship or
crew.
State Department press offi
cer Robert J. McCloskey said he
expected there would be addi
tional meetings.
When asked about reports
that the United States might of
fer construction equipment, food
or medicines as ransom for the

Pueblo crew, McCloskey said,
"That is not correct and I know
of no inclination on the part of
this government to take such a
step."
• Panthers In Court
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)—Six

asked a federal court injunction

The injunction complaint

Charles Garry, attorney for

• Strike Bill Shelved
SACRAMENTO (AP) — An

— a measure to outlaw the use

The Assembly Industrial Rela

the bill under submission — in

this session.
Author of the measure, Assem

by the California Labor Feder
