# Doctors Examine Causes
## Student Suicide Rate Rises 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
There have been ten attempt
student suicides at Stanford
this year.
What drives a Stanford stu
dent to kill himself? Obviously
the reasons involved are unique
ly personal, but some generaliza
tions can be made.
According to Dr. John Black
of the Counseling and Testing
Center and Dr. Jim Paulsen of
the Health Center, one cause is
the stress and competition at
Stanford.
Students are suddenly con
fronted with situations more de
manding than anything that
they have experienced before.
The high stakes of their careers
also drive them on harder and
harder.
Both doctors also agree that
suicide cases often have a
poorly developed social life. Dr.
Black points out that they are
"so immersed in their own
problems that they can't re
late to anyone else. They don't
have any intimiate relation
ships, and they only social
ize in a superficial sen.se."
Dr. Paulsen says that at Stan
ford there is an "emphasis of

the intellectual over the social
aspects of life." He contends that
because students here are sup
posd to be brighter than most,
more is expected and required
of them.
As a result their social life
becomes stunted, and their emo
tions are neither "recognized,
expressed nor gratified." This
process, says Dr. Paulsen, "pro
duces its own bind."
He lists four basic motivations
for suicide. First there is a pres
sure on a individual to produce
more than he can. This pressure
comes from both parents and
faculty. Second, there are people
who have become deeply de
pressed for a variety of rea
sons.
Third, a person may be led to
commit suicide "When he is sud
denly deprived of an object â€”
love, or any vital relationship.
Finally, there are "communi
cational suicides" through which
a person tries to tell the people
around him something about his
plight.
But Dr. Paulsen said in most
cases it is "more likely a com
bination of these factors of so
cietal pressures, difficulties in

getting through to other peo
ple, and loneliness."
In the event a person feels
like killing himself, both doc
tors suggest immediate pro
fessional help. Dr. Black says
that discussing the matter
with friends isn't too good
since most of their advice
amounts to "Cheer up. Things
aren't that bad."
Once the student is in a psy
chiatrist's office, the doctor just
lets him talk with the idea of try
ing to get to the bottom of the
trouble. Black suggests that a
professional "lets him see the
sources of his problem. Often the
students is angry at himself, and
he turns it within instead of
outward. A person who has no
friends to discover what it is
that shuts him off from other
people."
Paulsen emphasizes the dr
tor's role in helping the studt v.
He says that there is a "de]...
sion of consciousness; people of
ten don't know why they com
mit suicide." The reasons are
subconscious, and the reasons
that a student gives are not al
ways what is causing the prob
lem.

Paulsen cited the trends in
suicide on campuses. Nationally
there is one suicide per 10,000
students, but Stanford is ahead
of this average with two so far
this year.
Foilowing the first death in
mid-October, there was no other
attempt until mid - February
when another student died.
Since then there have been eight
cases, but seven of these were
clustered in the four weeks fol
lowing the February death.
Paulsen attributed this sud
den rise in suicide cases to the
death preceding them. The
doctor said that there is a
feeling of empathy generated
by a suicide among potential
suicides.
Until another student actual
ly kills himself, a would-be sui
cide will put off taking any ac
tion. It is one thing to think of
suicide, but quite a different
natter to act on it.
But both men urged students
not to underestimate people
thinking of suicide. They recom
mended that persons suggest
they talk to a doctor, since this
may be the only way that they
will solve their problems.
