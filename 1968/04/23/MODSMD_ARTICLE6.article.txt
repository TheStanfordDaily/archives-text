# Fiscal Crisis Near, Says SJ Economist
## 
### D. McGUIRE 
The government of the United
States is faced with a series of
impossible fiscal demands, said
San Jose State economics pro
fessor James O'Connor at a
teach-in at Cuhberley sponsored
by the Students for a Democrat
ic Society last night.
While Gov. Ronald Reagan
would probably not dispute this
point, O'Connor appears con
vinced that the government's
financial problems cannot be
solved without a major restruc
turing of American society.
Modern capitalism has called
for the "socialization" of a
large part of the cost of produc
tion, O'Connor said. Industry re
quires technically trained work
ers, and the state has assumed
the burden of educating the la
bor force.
The corporations also call
upon government to finance such
expensive projects as the suDer

sonic transport and the inter
state highway system.
At the same time, o"Connor
said, the needs of the minorities,
U.S. responsibilities around the
world and the growing group
of people employed by the state
have also called for massive ex
penditures.
But the government has no
capital or money-making poten
tial. For its revenues it must de
pend on taxes.
O'Connor's thesis is that Ihe
huge surplus which industrializa
tion has made possible is not
available to the government. It
is wasted in the form of pack
aging and market costs. In the
case of products like cereal and
cosmetics, he says, the waste is
as high as 75 per cent.
Attacks on authority by strik
ing garbage collectors in Mem
phis and New York, the Black
Panthers and the New Left can
all be attributed to the financial
failure of the state, O'Connor
said.
Including college professors
from San Jose State in the cate
gory of "state workers," he out
lined measures which militant
groups can take to increase the
pressure on the government. But
O'Connor did not provide a plan
for converting the waste in pro
ducts like new cars into the
goods and services demanded by
the poor, state employees and
the corporations. Hopefully this
will be included in his forth
coming book, Corporate Capital.
O'Connor's analysis of mod
ern capitalism was accompanied
by statements of far left and
black power views from other
speakers. Martin Nicolaus, a
professor of sociology from Si
mon Frazer University, applied
"classical Marxian analysis" to
the present situation of the
United States.
Welvin Stroud, former San
Francisco school teacher and
member of the Black Panthers,
said that the Panthers are lov
ing, not violent. "We have
enough love that we're willing to
die and to kill," Stroud said.
The SDS is organizing a cat
pool to take Stanford students
to today's Stop the Draft Week
rally in Oakland. Also sponsored
by the Panthers and the Peace
and Freedom Part}, the rally
will be followed by a march to
the Alameda County Court
house where Panther leader
Huey P. Newton is being held.

Including college professors
from San Jose State in the cate
gory of "state workers," he out
lined measures which militant
groups can take to increase the
pressure on the government. But
O'Connor did not provide a plan
for converting the waste in pro
ducts like new cars into the
goods and services demanded by
the poor, state employees and
the corporations. Hopefully this
will be included in his forth
coming book, Corporate Capital.
O'Connor's analysis of mod
ern capitalism was accompanied
by statements of far left and
black power views from other
speakers. Martin Nicolaus, a
professor of sociology from Si
mon Frazer University, applied
"classical Marxian analysis" to
the present situation of the
United States.
Welvin Stroud, former San
Francisco school teacher and
member of the Black Panthers,
said that the Panthers are lov
ing, not violent. "We have
enough love that we're willing to
die and to kill," Stroud said.
The SDS is organizing a cat
pool to take Stanford students
to today's Stop the Draft Week
rally in Oakland. Also sponsored
by the Panthers and the Peace
and Freedom Part}, the rally
will be followed by a march to
the Alameda County Court
house where Panther leader
Huey P. Newton is being held.
The government of the United
States is faced with a series of
impossible fiscal demands, said
San Jose State economics pro
fessor James O'Connor at a
teach-in at Cuhberley sponsored
by the Students for a Democrat
ic Society last night.
While Gov. Ronald Reagan
would probably not dispute this
point, O'Connor appears con
vinced that the government's
financial problems cannot be
solved without a major restruc
turing of American society.
Modern capitalism has called
for the "socialization" of a
large part of the cost of produc
tion, O'Connor said. Industry re
quires technically trained work
ers, and the state has assumed
the burden of educating the la
bor force.
The corporations also call
upon government to finance such
expensive projects as the suDer

sonic transport and the inter
state highway system.
At the same time, o"Connor
said, the needs of the minorities,
U.S. responsibilities around the
world and the growing group
of people employed by the state
have also called for massive ex
penditures.
But the government has no
capital or money-making poten
tial. For its revenues it must de
pend on taxes.
O'Connor's thesis is that Ihe
huge surplus which industrializa
tion has made possible is not
available to the government. It
is wasted in the form of pack
aging and market costs. In the
case of products like cereal and
cosmetics, he says, the waste is
as high as 75 per cent.
Attacks on authority by strik
ing garbage collectors in Mem
phis and New York, the Black
Panthers and the New Left can
all be attributed to the financial
failure of the state, O'Connor
said.
