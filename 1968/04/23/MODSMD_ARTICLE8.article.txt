### JOHN ALCORN 
Patricia Mihaly, a Lagunita
sophomore, has recently earned
the Stanford-American Univer
sity of Beirut scholarship for a
year's study in Lebanon.
A political science major, Miss
Mihaly has already spent one
summer in the Middle East as
part of an American Field Ser
vice exchange program in Egypt.
The AUB exchange program,

now In its fifth year at Stan
ford, annually awards a scholar
ship to a Stanford student. The
grant covers the total cost of
tuition, room and board, and
a monthly stipend during the
nine months of study in Beirut,
Lebanon.
Nichel Nabti, chairman of the
program at Stanford, said that
applications for 1969-70 will be
available next fall. The program
fits most comfortably into the
junior year, as in Miss Mihaly's
case. All academic credit earned
at the American University of
Beirut is transferable to Stan
ford.
The American University of
Beirut was founded in 1866 as
a private, Protestant college by
the State of New York. Now
non-sectarian, it has an enroll
ment of 3500, representing 65
nations and a wide range of
religious and racial backgrounds.
AUB has one of the most beau
tiful campuses in the world.
Situated on the Mediterranean
coast, it has its own student
beach and is within a short drive
of the ski centers in the nearby
Lebanese Mountains.
The exchange program also
enables a student from AUB to
attend Stanford for a year un
der similar arrangements. Geo
rge Saliba, who lives at Beta
Chi, is this year's exchange stu
dent from Lebanon.
The Stanford-American Uni
versity of Beirut exchange pro
gram is one of several exchanges
sponsored by the Institute of
International Relations. It is the
only direct contact between Stan
ford and the Middle East.
