# Lightfoot At Folk Festival
## 
### JERRY FOGEL 
Canadian Gordan Lightfoot is
one of the featured performers
at the upcoming San Francisco
State College Folk Festival,
scheduled to run tomorrow
through Sunday.
His performances at San Fran
cisco State on Friday, April 26
at 8 p.m., Saturday the 27th at
10:30 p.m., and Sunday the 28th
at 2:30 p.m., will mark his first
Bay Area appearance.
A leading popular artist in his
own country, Lightfoot has also
won a large group of admirers
in the United States, and his
current album, his third for
United Artists, is a good indica
tion why.
This release, titled Did She
Mention My Name, is a work of
rare beauty and sensitivity.
Lightfoot gives new evidence of
his talent and versatility as a
writer, ranging from moving
love songs such as "The Last
Time I Saw Her' 'to sharply
topical compositions such as
"Black Day in July," an intense
commentary on last summer's
violence in Detroit.
His best-known contributions
to popular music, "Early Morn
ing Rain" and "That's What You
Get For Lovin' Me," have worthy
successors in the title song and
"Mountains and Marianne."
What makes the album a
thing of beauty is Lightfoot him
self. His voice is wonderfully ex
pressive, and whether a song is
light or serious, he is able to
sing it with honesty. There is
no gap between singer and listen
er â€” Lightfoot can communicate
his emotions with eloquence.
Producer John Simon, who
collaborated with the gifted team
of Albert Grossman and John
Court (Richie Havens, Peter,
Paul, and Mary) in making the
album have done a brilliant job
of arranging.
While one might expect or
chestration to detract from
Lightfoot's simple, direct per
forming style, Simon's arrange
ments enhance it greatly. "Does
Your Mother Know," perhaps
the best cut on the album, is
an authentic blend of music,
lyrics, arrangement, and per
formance.
Gordon Lightfoot has grown
with each of his three albums.
The first, titled simply Light
foot, was a delightful collection
of original compositions, mostly
in the country vein and per
formed not without rough edges.
The second, The Way I Feel,
reflected a new maturity, both
in the content of the songs and
in their execution. This latest
recording, Did She Mention My
Name, is an exciting, memor
able synthesis of creative talent
and artistic refinement.
