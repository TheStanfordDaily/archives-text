# Town Split On Traffic Loop
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
Many small merchants of
downtown Palo Alto feel they
are being choked to financial
death by the city's new one-way
traffic loop and its proponents
— City Hall, the City Council,
the Chamber of Commerce,
Downtown Palo Alto Inc., and
the Palo Alto Times.
The merchants, In fact, feel
that the directors of Chamber
of Commerce and Downtown
Inc. have presented false and
misleading evidence to support
plans for a permanent loop
and "dream" downtown Palo
Alto in the far future which
would have few, if any, small
retailers.
The proponents, in turn, ar
gue that the shopkeepers are be
hind the times and have failed
to work toward beautification
and improvement in the city.
One wealthy real estate agent
said, "How can they expect to
keep their revenue up when all
they do is stand in the street
and gripe to each other?"
Since October 1967, when the

new traffic patterns around Uni
versity Avenue were installed,
business has dropped as much
as 25 to 50 per cent for many
small retailers. They have been
pleading in vain for restoration
of the old two-way system.
Their appeals reached a cli
max in a City Council hearing
April 15 when the Council, after
listening to the pros and cons,
voted to extend the loop for four
months and indicated a desire to
make it permanent.
In response, some of the
merchants met two nights
ago and decided to carry on
their fight by trying to force
a special referendum election
on the issue in the near fu
ture.
During and before the Coun
cil session, counter efforts to ex
tend the loop were initiated by
the Chamber of Commerce,
Downtown Inc. (an association
of business men), and the Palo
Alto Times.
The day of the hearing, the
Times published an editorial pro
moting the loop and other beau

tification projects. The editorial
and coverage of the dispute by
the paper are sharply criticized
by the merchants, who believe
the Times has ignored their
troubles completely.
Asked yesterday whether the
Times had known about the mer
chant's difficulties before writing
the editorial, Editor Alexander
Bodi said, "We are very well
aware of them. But what do they
matter? Don't you write editor
ials on the basis of what you
believe is right?"
The merchants' charge about
false and misleading evidence
concerns a survey of Palo Alto
businessmen conducted by Down
town Inc. The shopkeepers
claim questionaires were sent to
all merchants but only those
answered by members of Down
town Inc. were counted because
the others were largely unfavor
able to the loop.
The survey showed that 60
per cent of Downtown Inc.
members are for the loop, or
70 of 120 members. Yet the
lrrate retailers say that of

280 businesses downtown, over
130 are against the loop and
have signed petitions.
The shop owners further pro
test that a "unanimous" recom
mendation presented to the City
Council for extension of the loop,
made jointly by the directors of
the Chamber and Downtown
Inc., is actually not unanimous.
The merchants point to at least
four directors who they say not
only didn't sign the recommen
dation, but support an opposing
petition.
Two supposedly dissenting di
rectors are Louis Rapp and his
son Roxy. But Richard Kluzek,
president of the Chamber of
Commerce, says that both Rapps
have since aligned themselves
with the recommendation and
have said they are sorry they
signed the petition. Neither of
the Rapps could be reached for
comment yesterday.
Kluzek points out that not all
directors were present at the
meeting when a vote was taken.
Nevertheless they were listed.
One of those not present but

listed is Stanford Vice President
Kenneth Cuthbcrtson. Cuthbert
son says he did not know there
was such strong opposition to
the loop while the Chamber was
forming its recommendation.
Ryland Kelley, of Hare-
Brewer and Kelley, owners of
the high rise office building
downtown, and a director of
Downtown Inc., described ontf
of the dissenting directors as
a man "who has not been for
a single improvement in the
history of mankind."
Kelley's firm is leading the
drive for transforming the down
town area into "a mini-urban
center," with "four or five high
rise buildings."
At the City Council hearing
last week opponents of the loop
brought with them petitions
signed by 1,885 people calling
for renewed two-way traffic on
University Avenue. The Coun
cil felt most of the signatures
were meaningless since they had
been made before January, not
giving the "loop" enough time

DIVERSION — This intersection, at University Ave. and High St.
in Palo Alto, intentionally diverts traffic away from University Ave.
The traffic pattern is at the center of a heated dispute among Palo
Alto businessmen.
