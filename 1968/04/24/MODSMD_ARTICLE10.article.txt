## GOP Draft Board Session 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON"The â€”"The Re
publican Draft Board is now In
session. Whose case are we hear
ing today?"
"We have a fellow by the name
of Nelson Rockefeller."
"Send him in."
"Mr. Rockefeller, I see by our
records that you are requesting
your draft status be reclassified
from 4-F to 1-A. We're curious
about why you want to be clas
sified 1-A at this stage."
"I've always wanted to serve
my country, sir, but when I ask
ed to be 4-F, I did it because I
didn't want to split the Repub
lican Army. But I've decided
now that with all my friends
going in, I would be considered
a draft dodger."
"That's very interesting, and
we certainly admire your change
of heart, but we see in your
folder that you have said that
you don't want to fight in the
primaries. How could you be a
good Republican soldier if you
don't want to fight?"

"I do want to fight, but I be
lieve in just wars against the
Democrats. If I fought in the
primaries I would be trying to
kill my brothers, and this is a
matter of conscience with me."
"Nelson, we had classified you
4-F because you had been mar
ried twice, you were a member
of the Eastern Establishment
and you refused to campaign for
our dearly beloved Gen. Barry
Goldwater in the Battle of '64.
We still consider you a security
risk."
"I'm a loyal Republican and
I would do anything to be draft
ed. Give me a chance. We've got
a tough battle ahead, and you
know the Republican Army can't
win it with Richard Nixon."
"Nixon is an experienced sol
dier. He's fought in many cam
paigns. It's true he's lost a few
of them, but I would like to re
mind you that 'old soldiers never
die,' at least not as far as the
Republicans are concerned."
"I didn't come here to beg, but

if you don't draft me, I'll never
be able to face my grandchil
dren. I'm a poor man, but I'll
sacrifice everything if you giv*
me this one chance."
"Nelson, a few months ago
you were going to volunteer to
fight for the Republican Army.
Then, at the last moment, to
everyone's surprise, you burned
your draft card and announced
you were a conscientious objec
tor. How do you square that
with what you've been telling us
today?"
"I had a change of heart. I
was all ready to go in, but I was
talked out of it by my friends.
They said, 'Don't volunteer and
then they'll have to draft you.'
So I decided not to go in. But
I didn't realize it was so hard to
be drafted. I talked it over with
my wife and she said, 'You'll
never be happy if you don't get
in the war.' So that's why I've
come down here today. Nobody's
more raring to go than I am. I
even brought my own ammuni
tion."

"You still haven't made a good
case for wanting to be inducted."
"I can beat the Democrats.
With me leading the Republican
Army we could get the liberals
to defect and the Democrats to
surrender. I could end the war
in Vietnam and bring law and
order to the streets of America.
I am a symbol of economic sta
bility. Besides, no one knows
what I really think about most
of the issues of the day. You
have to admit that's a plus."
"Nelson, we will reconsider
your case, though at this time
we can't give you any assurance
that you'll be drafted. Go back
to your home and wait until you
hear from us."
"That's what you told me in
1964. I'm not leaving this draft
board until I'm reclassified."
"Nelson, sitting down on the
floor is going to do you no good
at all. Besides, whoever heard
of a Rockefeller staging a sit
in?"
