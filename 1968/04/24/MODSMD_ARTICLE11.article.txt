## Jordan Spoke To Racial Issue 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
Mr. Smythe's letter (Friday,
April 19) concerning the Jordan-
Edwards "confrontation" in
Dinkelspiel contained a glaring
error in judgment which he
committed by reason of a mis
understanding of the circum
stances surrounding the inci
dent.
Mr. Smythe noted that "Mr.
Jordan's speech displayed an
amazing lack of awareness of
the problems of black athletes
and an alarming insensitivity to
racial issues in general." As
a matter for the public record,
the Black Student Union invited
Mr. Jordan to speak on the role
of the Negro in athletics. The
intended purpose of the gather
ing (insofar as Mr. Jordan was
informed by the BSU) was not
to analyze the merits and ob
jectives of the Olympic boycott.
(And needless to say, Mr. Ed
wards never once throughout
his diatribe of seething hatred
addressed himself to a critical
examination of the raison d'
etre of the boycott.
Mr. Jordan's "irrelevant rem
iniscences" comprised his at
tempt to point out how athletics
have served to break down rac
ial barriers by reason of the
fact that a man's athletic per
formances on the field are
viewed without regard to racial
or religious distinction by both
spectator and fellow competitor.
By relating incidents from his
own experience, Mr. Jordan at
tempted to present this positive
aspect of amateur and profes
sional sports, i.e., the invaluable
function that they can perform
of bridging the racial hiatus be
tween black and white Ameri
ca.
Mr. Smythe further stated

that "it would be a pity if Stan
ford, which at least shows signs
of willingness to cope with mi
nority student problems in the
academic area, did not make
similar strides in its athletic
and other extracurricular pro
grams." For years the Stanford
athletic department has been
unequivocally instrumental in
enabling black student-athletes
to attend this university. Thus,
Mr. Smythe, if you wish to point
the accusatory finger, do so
other than in the direction of
the Department of Athletics.

Jordan Didn't Discuss
Complex Race Probs
Editor, The Daily:
While appreciating the spirit
of Coach John Gilmore's letter
(April 22), I must take issue
with the criticism of Harry Ed
wards, and with any implied de
fense of Payton Jordan.
It would seem reasonable to
hope that the coach of the U.S.
Olympic Team might possess
some small spark of understand
ing concerning the complexities
of race relations and the sensi
tivities of minority groups.
In his speech of April 17,
Coach Jordan displayed an ap
palling lack of insight in this
area, saying in effect that if a
nigger can run fast enough (he
didn't say in which direction),
he can also be a part-time man,
provided he doesn't leave the
track.
Who cares what color track
shoes Bob Hayes wore in the
Olympic semifinals? Who really
gives a damn about the anchor
man in the 100 m. relay? No
body, Payton baby, and nobody

cares about Jackie Robinson's
sixth grade track meet either.
Mr. Jordan's address was so
devoid of any comprehension of
racial problems and so totally
offensive in its implications that
I can only sympathize with the
rage and frustration voiced by
Edwards, who certainly spoke
what I — and judging by au
dience reaction, others — felt. I
am sorry Edward's behavior did
not meet what Coach Gilmore
called "the rules of gentlemanly
conduct," but is Jordan a gentle
man because he wears a suit,
speaks softly and defames by
omission? Is Edwards at fault
for telling it like it is? . . .
He graphically illustrates the
reason for the non-existence of
black-white communication, and
it is he owes an apology to the
black community. Such an apol
ogy might be best demonstrated
by resigning as Olympic Coach
in favor of someone capable of
recognizing that a problem exists
and is willing to act. Now.

Suicide Rise One Year
Doesn't Make A Trend
Editor, The Daily:
Contrary to the article in the
Daily of 23 April regarding sui
cide, I would like to state that
the suicide rate at Stanford is
not rising.
While it is not unusual for
suicide attempts to occur in
"clusters", it is unusual at Stan
ford to have as many as have
occurred this year. However, an
unusual occurence during one
year does not make a trend.
During the past five years,
there have been five Stanford
student suicide deaths. In 1966
there were none; during this
academic year there have been
two.
In the same five years, there
have been forty-seven suicide at
tempts, which averages out to
about ten yer year. The rate
varies: in 1964 there were six
teen, in 1967 three.
The article in the Daily pre
sented a reasonable discussion
of factors and motivations in
volved in suicide. However, the
title of the article "Student Sui
cide Rate Rises" belongs more
in the province of energetic
journalism than in statistical
reality.

ADA Gave Humphrey
100% Rating, Too
Editor, The Daily:
Reading the Kennedy for
President advertisement in the
Daily of April 22, in which Ken
nedy reportedly received a 100

per cent liberal rating by th
ADA, made me remember with
grim amusement that Hubert
Humphrey was also the proud
holder of many a 100 per cent
ADA liberal rating back in the
good old days. In picking up a
few points from history I might
humbly suggest that the liber
al's candidate of the future is
Reagan.
KLAUS GALDA
McCarthy Opposed Bills
Because Of 'Insight 9
Editor, The Daily:
The Students for Kennedy ad
vertisement which appeared in
Monday's Daily is "A Look at
the Issues" with considerable as
tigmatism. The cases it presents
against McCarthy are unfairly
slanted. Quite noteworthy is the
complete lack of concern for
why McCarthy took such seem
ingly contradictory positions on
the issues; yet the "analysis" is
"based on research in the Con
gressional Record, Congression
al Quarterly ..." These sources
also contain position statements
by McCarthy and other similar
ly-voting Senators.
My own impression is that,
once clarified, McCarthy's posi
tion on most of the advertised
issues would be found quite re
spectable by a liberal who thinks
twice. . . .
It is one thing to oppose lib
eral legislation because of con
servative beliefs. It is another
thing to oppose liberal legisla
tion because of insight into the
deeper problems which such leg
islation might create.
I myself feel somewhat un
easy about anyone with a 100
per cent liberal rating. The lib
eral legislation of the past,
while perhaps 100 per cent com
mendable in spirit, has blunder
ed into many unforeseen prob
lems and consequently merits
less than a 100 per cent perfor
mance rating. Accordingly, my
own performance is for a Pres
ident who is both liberal and
competent enough to see through
the issues. And this is not a
matter of personalities.

Write-In Dick Gregory
On Choice '68 Ballot
Editor, The Daily:
Was I surprised at who the
International Coffee Organiza
tion believes are the legitimate
candidates in the 1968 President
ial election? Well, not exactly.
Since the political power struc
tures within the two maior par
ties seem intent on letting me
choose between Richard Nixon
and Hubert Humphrey this fall
... I suggest we write Dick Gre
gory in on the "Choice '68" bal
lot."

King Fund Is Way Out
Of Facing The Ghetto
Editor, The Dally:
We feel that the argument
presented by Mr. Starkovich
(Dally, April 17) on getting
money for the Black Panthers
rather than for the Martin Lu
ther King Memorial Fund is thn
most cogent of all that have
been presented in the Univers
ity over the last several weeks.
We do not feel that the King
Fund is comprehensive enough.
While we would grant, as Mr.
Starkovich does, that it is a val
uable contribution to Stanford
as an educational institution, we
feel that to dedicate a portion
of one's salary or attend a bene
fit dance to raise money so that
several black students can at
tend the University may become
an easy way out of confronting
the situation in the ghetto areas
today. . .
