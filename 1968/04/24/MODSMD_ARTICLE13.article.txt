## 
### 
The ASSU Constitutional Con
vention closed Saturday after
drawing up a new constitution
and charter intended to clarify
and strengthen the role of stu
dents in the workings of the
university.
The new constitution is tech
nically an amendment to the old
one, but since it amends every
section except the title, it is in
fact a new document. A new
charter attempts to "delimit the

powers, responsibilities and
rights of the student body."
A new by-law would provide
for a student senate of 14 under
graduates and 14 graduate stu
dents as voting members with
6 ex-officio members including
one faculty member and one
representative of the adminis
tration.
Copies of all three documents
will be available by Friday in
