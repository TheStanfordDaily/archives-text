# The 						Scoreboard
## Action Starts On BSU Points 
### Louis Knowles 
The spectacular concessions
that the BSU won from the uni
versity last week are only a
starting point on the road to so
cial reform in an institution as
large and as complex cts Stan
ford.
The black students do not
have sufficient numbers to ap
ply pressure on the dozens of
committees and governing bod
ies that can and should be at
tacking the problem of de facto
discrimination in the individual
departments and schools. Whites
must keep track of the bureau
cratic vagaries of the various
departments and continue press
ing for swift action.
This column will be devoted
to a review of movements and
programs concerned with racial
justice in all parts of the uni
versity. Don't forget that most
of the actions to date have been
proposals with no meaning un
less they are acted upon in the
near future.

The Students Against White
Racism voted last Tuesday to
support a proposal which would
give preference in bidding to
companies with aggressive mi
nority recruitment. The proposal

will be submitted to University
officials and the Human Rela
tions Commission for consid
eration.
The business school is plan
ning an all-day conference on
institutional racism for May 15.
The morning will be devoted to
addresses by authorities in the
field, and the remainder of the
day will be spent in small task
groups oriented around issues
such as jobs for the victims of
poverty, model city grants, and
housing.
The business school admini
stration has created a committee
under the chairmanship of Prof.
Gail M. Oxley to examine how
the school can respond to the
racial crisis. The committee has
had one short organizational
meeting and should be able to
report progress during the next
few weeks.
The newly formed Business
Aid Society will provide volun
teer counseling by students for
small businessmen from low
income groups through an OEO
program. John Osterweiss and
Hoff Staufer are organizing the

Stanford BAS which will co
ordinated with continuing pro
grams of the Santa Clara Count"
OEO.
A group of students in the
School of Education headed by
Jackie Griffith and Tom Gris
som have drawn up a proposa l
for a crash teacher retraining
program that would take plac l
this summer. The program
would concentrate on
and methods for the teaching
of Afro-American studies and
the history of white racism. It
is also hoped that this program
can become a part of the regu
lar M.A.-Ph.D. curriculum. Con
siderable faculty support has
already been mustered behind
the proposal.
Several graduate students in
political science have launched
a proposal for an M.A. program
in urban and racial affairs in
which the emphasis would be on
current problems and methods
of social and political change.
Dick Young, a backer of the
proposal, noted the great lack
of applied studies in the poli
tical science department.

current problems and methods
of social and political change.
Dick Young, a backer of the
proposal, noted the great lack
of applied studies in the poli
tical science department.
The spectacular concessions
that the BSU won from the uni
versity last week are only a
starting point on the road to so
cial reform in an institution as
large and as complex cts Stan
ford.
The black students do not
have sufficient numbers to ap
ply pressure on the dozens of
committees and governing bod
ies that can and should be at
tacking the problem of de facto
discrimination in the individual
departments and schools. Whites
must keep track of the bureau
cratic vagaries of the various
departments and continue press
ing for swift action.
This column will be devoted
to a review of movements and
programs concerned with racial
justice in all parts of the uni
versity. Don't forget that most
of the actions to date have been
proposals with no meaning un
less they are acted upon in the
near future.

ning an all-day conference on

housing.
The business school admini
stration has created a committee
under the chairmanship of Prof.
Gail M. Oxley to examine how
the school can respond to the
racial crisis. The committee has
had one short organizational
meeting and should be able to
report progress during the next
few weeks.
The newly formed Business
Aid Society will provide volun
teer counseling by students for
small businessmen from low
income groups through an OEO
program. John Osterweiss and
Hoff Staufer are organizing the

OEO.
A group of students in the
School of Education headed by
Jackie Griffith and Tom Gris
som have drawn up a proposa l
for a crash teacher retraining
program that would take plac l
this summer. The program
would concentrate on
and methods for the teaching
of Afro-American studies and
the history of white racism. It
is also hoped that this program
can become a part of the regu
lar M.A.-Ph.D. curriculum. Con
siderable faculty support has
already been mustered behind
the proposal.
Several graduate students in
political science have launched
a proposal for an M.A. program
in urban and racial affairs in

current problems and methods
of social and political change.
