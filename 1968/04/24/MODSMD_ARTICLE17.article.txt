## CRE Defended As Open Group With Disputes Over Goals 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
Having had at least tangen
tial association with the Com
mittee on Relevant Education
during the past few months, I
was especially interested in the
editorial comments about the or
ganization in your editorial of
April 19.
I believe that the tone of the
editorial was far too sarcastic
to succeed in promoting any
change in CRE — which was
your stated purpose. It is also re
markable that such a strong
condemnation has appeared edit
orially since to my knowledge
no one on the Editorial Board
has ever participated in a series
of meetings of a CRE relevance
group.
In the few groups where I
have been present there has been
no coercive leadership (indeed,
sometimes no leadership at all)
and no apple pie or ice cream
sundaes, much less "Mickey
Mouse" or a "malleable work
force susceptible to persuasive
. . . jargon."
There has been open and oc
casionally violent disagreement
within CRE on its nature and
goals; your editorial, however,
discards this fact and denounces
darkly CRE's power to manipu
late people with Hitlerian
Gleichsrhaltung while claiming
scurrilously at the same time
that CRE is in "truth" innocu
uous. Furthermore, hostile ridi
cule of a "wide smile" and some
students' desire to experience
more substantial personal inter
action does nothing to inform
us why these concepts should
merit intrinsically the wrath of
the Editorial Board.
Finally, I ask for some evi

dence that CRE "whittles away
personality for unanimity." At
tending CRE meetings has not
left me bereft of my personal
ity, and I have witnessed more
than one other personality
emerge into healthy indepen
dence and much deeper maturity
through CRE groups. Your edit

orial cannot and should not an
nul any value which CRE has
had for those individuals. CRE
is not faultless, but for many it
has meant more constructive and
positive progress in experienc
ing truth than reading editorials
based on sarcasm.
