# Thousands In Oakland Protest War, Racism
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Confusion reigned in the
ranks of both police and demon
strators as 2,000 anti-war and
anti-racism protestors marched
from the Oakland Induction
Center to the Alameda County
Courthouse yesterday.
Police arrested 18 demon
strators, three of them juven
iles, on charges ranging from
assaulting police and resisting
arrest to jaywalking, loiter
ing, and blocking traffic.
Most of the arrests came dur
ing the march, not at rallies
near the induction center and
courthouse.
The march, originally sched
uled for 9:30 a.m., began almost
two hours early, and did not
follow the path stated in the
permit granted for the demon
stration.
This unplanned disruption of
Oakland's early rush hour traf
fic brought the police into ac
tion as they tried to clear the
protestors from six blocks of
14th Street.
Shouts and curses by the
demonstrators and shoving
and some clubbing by the
police marked the progress of
the march. Some protestors
also reported the use of
MACE by at least one Oak
land policeman.
When the crowd finally
reached the courthouse, the
police cleared them away from
it into a park across the street.
Many demonstrators were
shoved and hit by police during
this episode.
The rally, sponsored by Stop
the Draft Week, began at La
fayette Square Park, where bal
loons and wooden shields were
distributed.
Shortly before 6:30 a.m., the
scheduled starting time of the
rally, the bulk of those on the
scene marched from the park to
the induction center.
About 100 protestors were al
ready there. They had arrived
early to greet the buses of in
ductees, who were brought in an
hour early.
As demonstrators milled about
on Clay St. chanting ."Hell No,
Nobody Goes' 'and "Free Huey

Now," Oakland's Deputy Police
Chief Robert Cazadd warned the
crowd they would be arrested
if they did not stay on the side
walk.
They were cleared from the
street by a phalanx of police as
a truck carrying the people
scheduled to speak at the rally
arrived.
Speakers included H. Bruce
Franklin, associate professor of
English at Stanford, Mario
Savio, Rev. John Parriman
Brown, David Welch of Ram
parts, and others.
The confusion began when,
shortly after 7:30, the people
on the speakers' truck de
cided to start for the court
house. The entire crowd fol
lowed.
Police did not disturb the
march until it had reached the
corner of 14th St.and Broad
way. At that point, an unmarked
police car raced through the

crowd at about 30 m.p.h., fol
lowed by about a half-dozen
motorcycle patrolmen.
They surrounded the truck at
the intersection, and cleared the
crowd from the roadway. The
police then backed away, and
the truck was allowed to pro
ceed halfway into the next
block, when the scene was re
peated.
At this point, scattered vio
lence broke out. Trying to get
the crowd back on the side
walk, the police encountered
some resistance from the pro
testors and began to shove
and swing their clubs. Two
demonstrators, one a young
Negro, were arrested.
The police then arrested the
driver of the truck, Joe Weiss
man, and cleared all riders from
it.
The march then became less
organized, as the protestors

street to the courthouse.
A squad of motorcycle patrol
men were then brought in to
clear the street. One officer,
badge No. 727, hit at least five
protestors with his motorcycle
in the process.
Police soon cleared the pro
testors from the courthouse to
a park across the street. Several
people were shoved and clubbed
by the police here when the
press of the crowd behind them
prevented them from retreating,
as the police ordered.
In the park, a debate took
place over what further action

should be taken. Eventually, the
crowd left, with some returning
to picket the induction center
for a short time.
At least three demonstrators
were arrested by police on the
return march.
At a meeting later yester
day at Berkeley, Stop-the-Draft
Week decided to hold no furth
er rallies this week.
Also arrested yesterday was
Vince Mannino, a member of the
Resistance, and Bob Mandel, one
of those indicted for conspiracy
in the last Stop the Draft Week.
Mandel was picked up while eat
ing in a restaurant, on a prior
warrant.

MACE by at least one Oak
land policeman.
When the crowd finally
reached the courthouse, the
police cleared them away from
it into a park across the street.
Many demonstrators were
shoved and hit by police during
this episode.
The rally, sponsored by Stop
the Draft Week, began at La
fayette Square Park, where bal
loons and wooden shields were
distributed.
Shortly before 6:30 a.m., the
scheduled starting time of the
rally, the bulk of those on the
scene marched from the park to
the induction center.
About 100 protestors were al
ready there. They had arrived
early to greet the buses of in
ductees, who were brought in an
hour early.
As demonstrators milled about
on Clay St. chanting ."Hell No,
Nobody Goes' 'and "Free Huey

Now," Oakland's Deputy Police
Chief Robert Cazadd warned the
crowd they would be arrested
if they did not stay on the side
walk.
They were cleared from the
street by a phalanx of police as
a truck carrying the people
scheduled to speak at the rally
arrived.
Speakers included H. Bruce
Franklin, associate professor of
English at Stanford, Mario
Savio, Rev. John Parriman
Brown, David Welch of Ram
parts, and others.
The confusion began when,
shortly after 7:30, the people
on the speakers' truck de
cided to start for the court
house. The entire crowd fol
lowed.
Police did not disturb the
march until it had reached the
corner of 14th St.and Broad
way. At that point, an unmarked
police car raced through the

crowd at about 30 m.p.h., fol
lowed by about a half-dozen
motorcycle patrolmen.
They surrounded the truck at
the intersection, and cleared the
crowd from the roadway. The
police then backed away, and
the truck was allowed to pro
ceed halfway into the next
block, when the scene was re
peated.
At this point, scattered vio
lence broke out. Trying to get
the crowd back on the side
walk, the police encountered
some resistance from the pro
testors and began to shove
and swing their clubs. Two
demonstrators, one a young
Negro, were arrested.
The police then arrested the
driver of the truck, Joe Weiss
man, and cleared all riders from
it.

street to the courthouse.
A squad of motorcycle patrol
men were then brought in to
clear the street. One officer,
badge No. 727, hit at least five
protestors with his motorcycle
in the process.
Police soon cleared the pro
testors from the courthouse to
a park across the street. Several
people were shoved and clubbed
by the police here when the
press of the crowd behind them
prevented them from retreating,
as the police ordered.
In the park, a debate took
place over what further action

should be taken. Eventually, the
crowd left, with some returning
to picket the induction center
for a short time.
At least three demonstrators
were arrested by police on the
return march.
At a meeting later yester
day at Berkeley, Stop-the-Draft
Week decided to hold no furth
er rallies this week.
Also arrested yesterday was
Vince Mannino, a member of the
Resistance, and Bob Mandel, one
of those indicted for conspiracy
in the last Stop the Draft Week.
Mandel was picked up while eat

Confusion reigned in the
ranks of both police and demon
strators as 2,000 anti-war and
anti-racism protestors marched
from the Oakland Induction
Center to the Alameda County
Courthouse yesterday.
Police arrested 18 demon
strators, three of them juven
iles, on charges ranging from
assaulting police and resisting
arrest to jaywalking, loiter
ing, and blocking traffic.
Most of the arrests came dur
ing the march, not at rallies
near the induction center and
courthouse.
The march, originally sched
uled for 9:30 a.m., began almost
two hours early, and did not
follow the path stated in the
permit granted for the demon
stration.
This unplanned disruption of
Oakland's early rush hour traf
fic brought the police into ac
tion as they tried to clear the
protestors from six blocks of
14th Street.
Shouts and curses by the
demonstrators and shoving

parts, and others.
The confusion began when,
shortly after 7:30, the people
on the speakers' truck de
cided to start for the court
house. The entire crowd fol
lowed.
Police did not disturb the
march until it had reached the
corner of 14th St.and Broad
way. At that point, an unmarked
police car raced through the

crowd at about 30 m.p.h., fol
lowed by about a half-dozen
motorcycle patrolmen.
They surrounded the truck at
the intersection, and cleared the
crowd from the roadway. The
police then backed away, and
the truck was allowed to pro
ceed halfway into the next
block, when the scene was re
peated.
At this point, scattered vio
lence broke out. Trying to get
the crowd back on the side
walk, the police encountered
some resistance from the pro
testors and began to shove
and swing their clubs. Two
demonstrators, one a young
Negro, were arrested.
The police then arrested the
driver of the truck, Joe Weiss
man, and cleared all riders from
it.
The march then became less
organized, as the protestors

moved in some disarray up the
street to the courthouse.
A squad of motorcycle patrol
men were then brought in to
clear the street. One officer,
badge No. 727, hit at least five
protestors with his motorcycle
in the process.
Police soon cleared the pro
testors from the courthouse to
a park across the street. Several
people were shoved and clubbed
by the police here when the
press of the crowd behind them
prevented them from retreating,
as the police ordered.
In the park, a debate took
place over what further action

should be taken. Eventually, the
crowd left, with some returning
to picket the induction center
for a short time.
At least three demonstrators
were arrested by police on the
return march.
At a meeting later yester
day at Berkeley, Stop-the-Draft
Week decided to hold no furth
er rallies this week.
Also arrested yesterday was
Vince Mannino, a member of the
Resistance, and Bob Mandel, one
of those indicted for conspiracy
in the last Stop the Draft Week.
Mandel was picked up while eat
ing in a restaurant, on a prior
warrant.
Confusion reigned in the
ranks of both police and demon
strators as 2,000 anti-war and
anti-racism protestors marched
from the Oakland Induction
Center to the Alameda County
Courthouse yesterday.
Police arrested 18 demon
strators, three of them juven
iles, on charges ranging from
assaulting police and resisting
arrest to jaywalking, loiter
ing, and blocking traffic.
Most of the arrests came dur
ing the march, not at rallies
near the induction center and
courthouse.
The march, originally sched
uled for 9:30 a.m., began almost
two hours early, and did not
follow the path stated in the
permit granted for the demon
stration.
This unplanned disruption of
Oakland's early rush hour traf
fic brought the police into ac
tion as they tried to clear the
protestors from six blocks of
14th Street.
Shouts and curses by the
demonstrators and shoving
and some clubbing by the
police marked the progress of
the march. Some protestors
also reported the use of
MACE by at least one Oak
land policeman.
When the crowd finally
reached the courthouse, the
police cleared them away from
it into a park across the street.
Many demonstrators were
shoved and hit by police during
this episode.
The rally, sponsored by Stop
the Draft Week, began at La
fayette Square Park, where bal
loons and wooden shields were
distributed.
Shortly before 6:30 a.m., the
scheduled starting time of the
rally, the bulk of those on the
scene marched from the park to
the induction center.
About 100 protestors were al
ready there. They had arrived
early to greet the buses of in
ductees, who were brought in an
hour early.
As demonstrators milled about
on Clay St. chanting ."Hell No,
Nobody Goes' 'and "Free Huey

Now," Oakland's Deputy Police
Chief Robert Cazadd warned the
crowd they would be arrested
if they did not stay on the side
walk.
They were cleared from the
street by a phalanx of police as
a truck carrying the people
scheduled to speak at the rally
arrived.
