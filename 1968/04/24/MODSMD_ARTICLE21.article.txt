# The 						Inside Track
## A 						Case For Ear Flaps 
### Gary Cavalli 
It was mid-August, 1967, and the 100-to-l shot Boston Red Sox
were fighting for the American League pennant. Their talented
young outfielder Tony Conigliaro was having his finest season, with
a .287 batting average, 20 home runs, and 67 runs-batted-in.
But on August 18 Jack Hamilton of the Angels lost control of
one of his fast balls, and with it was lost Conigliaro's brilliant fu
ture. The ball sailed high and inside, crashing sickeningly against
the left side of Conigliaro's face, just below the eye.
Conigliaro missed the final seven weeks of the '67 season, and
it was a minor miracle that the Sox went on to win the pennant on
th final day of the season. But the fact that Boston won the AL
flag with Conigliaro has become the most insignificant consequence
of his injury. What now impresses itself on the minds of everyone
connected with baseball is that the promising career of 23-year-old
Tony Conigliaro has been shattered.
Hamilton's pitch broke Conig's cheekbone and caused an undeter
mined amount of damage to the left eye. Throughout the off-season
baseball buffs questioned Tony's ability to comeback successfully
from such an injury.
Conigliaro is not a quitter. He tried to work himself back into
shape, and last November talked teammate Darryl Brandon into
pitching to him at Fenway Park in Boston. The workout was an
encouraging one for Conigliaro, as the blurred vision which plagued
him since the day of the beaning had vanished.
But the blur returned when Conigliaro reported to spring train
ing two months ago. He told teammates he had trouble focusing
on pitches, that he was squinting a lot and bothered by headaches.
The impaired vision was most noticeable at the plate, where the
1965 AL home-run champ was only a shadow of his former self.
He struck out 22 of his first 66 times at bat, including eight of his
last ten times up, before an examination was deemed necessary.
It now looks as though Tony Conigliaro will never play major
league ball again. An eye specialist discovered that "his eyesight
is deteriorating. He has vision distortion, and little or no depth
perception."
While Conigliaro's case is the most serious, it is by no means the
only recent injury resulting from a beaning incident. Don Mincher
was struck by a Sam McDowell fast ball the first week of the cur
rent season and needed several stitches to close a severe cut near
his mouth. Mincher has not yet returned to the Angel lineup. Last
week All-Star catcher Joe Torre was beaned and rushed from the
field with blood spurting from the side of his head. Torre will be
out two weeks with a fractured nose.
The examples are endless. As more and more pitchers discover
the advantages of brushing back hitters who like to crowd the plate,
more and more batters will be wheeled to the hospital with head
injuries.
Obviously, something needs to be done, before batters are left
as helpless as ducks in a shooting gallery. Compulsory use of the
more protective batting helmet, complete with ear flap, seems to be
the answer. Besides eliminating the possibility of an eye injury
such as Conigliaro's, it removes any chance of fatal damage to the
head.
General managers will argue that these helmets are unattractive,
and since such serious injuries are infrequent (after all, only one
player has been killed by a pitched ball in major league history),
they are also unnecessary.
This line of reasoning seems to be a foul ball in anybody's ball
park. Baseball is in sorry shape when attractiveness takes prece
dence over a player's safety.
A few days ago Boston manager Dick Williams announced that
Conigliaro is trying to make a comeback as a pitcher. Conigliaro
has been working out on his own, and "with his determination, I
wouldn't sell him short," Williams said Saturday. The possessor of
an excellent throwing arm during his days in the outfield, Conig
liaro may pitch his way back into baseball. We hope he makes it.
