# Remain Undefeated
## Laxmen Down Denver 
### 
Proving its mettle against non
league competition, the Stanford
varsity lacrosse team stayed un
defeated over the weekend, beat
ing a strong Denver University
team 7-5 in a double overtime,
and smashing the University of
Oregon 134.
The Denver contest proved to
be the major intersectional bat
tle it was billed as, and the Den

ver team was certainly the
toughest competition Stanford
has faced all year.
Stanford maintained a pre
carious lead the whole game
until Denver's Craig Patrick
sneaked in a goal with only five
seconds left in the game to tie
the score 5-5 and send the game
into two overtime periods. Stan
ford controlled the overtime,
with George Muser providing the
margin of victory and Pete Eak
land the insurance.
Stanford took early control
of the game with three goals
in the first period. Attacknian
George "Muser dodged around
the defenseman and scored
alone only two minutes into
the game.
Denver's "All American Can
didate" Sandy Larkin tied mat
ters up two minutes later on a
fast break play. Larkin only got
two more shots the rest of the
afternoon.
Disk Speas then scored unas
sisted and Peter Hovey scored
with help from Muser to round
out the first quarter scoring.
Larkin struck again in the
second period on another brok
en play to inch Denver closer
to the Indians.

Hovey whirled and dodged for
an unassisted goal in the next
period to preserve the two-froal
margin, but Denver's Tug Howe
got credit for a goal which slip
ped off the lip of Stanford goalie
Mel Ellis' stick.
Harry Beaver tied things up in
a man-down situation to set the
stage for Patrick's thrilling goal.
The key again to the Stan
ford victory was the outstand
ing defense. Wade Klllefer,
Denny McNeeley, and Bill Eak
land turned In fine perfor
mances. The Indians were
charged with twenty-one pen
alties and were down a man
most of the second half. Nat
Benchley and Gay Urness
were superb on the man-down
defense.
Coach Oon Ronavne singled
out captain and goalie Mel Ellis
for praise. A strong candidate
for All-American honors Ellis
frustrated the Denver attack all
afternoon.
Sunday's Oregon contest fea
tured Killefer and McNeely in
their debut at attack, and Tim
Abena's first competitive goal.
George Muser and Pete Eakland
and Mark Telter all turned hat
tricks for Stanford.
