The Stanford crew continued
its winning ways by defeating
crews from the University of
Washington, University of Ore
gon, and Oregon State Univer
sity in Corvallis last Saturday.
The varsity and junior var
sity Stanford boats are unbeaten
this season, and from all indica
tions, no one may be able to
catch them. The Tribe varsity
is the only unbeaten crew on
the coast.
Saturday's victory was the
first time Stanford has taken
shirts from Washington
1916. Three years ago the In
dians defeated a JV contingent
from UW when the Huskies
failed to send a varsity crew.
In the first race of the morn
ing the Stanford freshmen boat
was defeated by high-stroking
crews from Washington and
OSU. Washington won in a time
of 5:51, and the Indians clock
ed 6:00. Kent Mitchell's frosh
hope to get back on the war
path in time for next week's
race with UC Irvine.
In the JV race the Stanlord
boat, stroked by Doug Liver
more, scored an impressive vic
tory over the other three crews
in a time of 5:54. Rowing into a
headwind, the Card crew finish
ed nearly a length-and-a-half
ahead of the Washington boat.
In the final race of the morn
ing, the Stanford varsity whip
ped the Husky varsity by two
seats, in a time of 5:35. The
Stanford time was a new OSU
course record.
The highly-touted Washing
ton boat did everything possible
to pull out a victory, but a good
start and steady stroking by
first boaters Jim Madden, Don
Connolly, Russ Barto, John Hot
son, McKim Brnes, Steve Cross
land, Bob Thomas, and Gaynor
Dawson proved to be too much
for the struggling Huskies.
Next week, the Stanford crew
turns to UC Irvine for a race
Sunday morning. Coach Wil Con
don's varsity oarsmen are now
beginning an intensive workout
schedule in preparation for th»
last year's Western Sprint
Champs, UCLA, on May 3.
