## Action On Black Programs 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Monday night a group of Stan
ford black students moved into
the Admission Office to tele
phone each of the 71 Negroes
admitted to the next freshman
class. With the encouragement
of the University, they were try
ing to make sure the admitted
students actually enroll in Sep
tember.
Last week two University offi
cials flew to Washington, D.C. to
sound out federal officials on th a
prospect of government support
for Stanford minority group ef
forts.
And today a "task force"
of faculty and black students,
led by Education Prof. Robert
Hess, will meet to plan the re- 1
cruitment of 10 minority group
students who don't meet Stan
ford's normal entrance re
quirements.

These are a few examples of
how work is proceeding in Stan
ford's effort to eliminate de
facto discrimination in enroll
ment and employment, now that
the dramatic confrontations be
tween the Black Student Union
and the administration have
passed.
The University agreed April
11 to a nine-point program which
intimately involved BSU mem
bers in minority group policy.
Already a special search com
mittee has received a "great
number" of nominations for the
new position of Coordinator of
Inter-group Relations, a key
BSU demand. The committee,
consisting of Prof. James Gibbs,
Personnel director Joseph
Scroggs, and Assistant Provost
Raymond Bacchetti, will meet
with two BSU consultants today.
The black administrator
they hire will work with an
other new entity, the Human
Relations Commission. Law
Prof. Byron Sher, chairman,
should receive the commis
sion's formal "charter" from
President Wallace Sterling

later this week. Two BSU ap
pointees among its nine mem
bers haven't yet been named.
But one University depart
ment has needed no "start-up"
time to implement the minority
group plans. Mike Ravizza in
the personnel office has been
working since November with
the sole aim of hiring more
blacks and Mexican-Americans.
The promises by Sterling April
8 just gave Ravizza a higher
goal and more resources to
achieve it with.
Before Ravizza was assigned
to minority group affairs, Stan
ford had made no effort to over
come the acute racial imbalance
among its 6,000 employees. "We
just didn't get enough of the
'right kind' of job applications
from minority group members.
Formal qualifications for consid
eration for jobs were too high,"
Ravizza says.
Ravizza started out by exam
ining every opening listed with
the Personnel Office to find out
if a person could be trained to
fill it. By "examining each and
every position as it became

open" he pin-pointed those which
would most easily be filled by
minority group applicants.
Then Ravizza intensified re
cruiting at placement centers
such as Opportunity Industriali
zation Center West (OICW) in
East Menlo Park, giving blacks
and Mexican-Americans the first
chance to apply for openings.
"I tried to give them more
than just lip-service," Ravizza
says.
He also set up the "first or
ganized training program" at
Stanford April 1. The first class
of five women will graduate Fri
day after four weeks of on-the
job practice and workshop train
ing clerical skills. Another class
will begin in May.
From November 15 through
April 12, Ravizza succeeded in
filling . r >6 out of 18;"» openings
with minority group members.
But now the University is com
mitted to "doubling" the pro
portion of employees who are
Negro or Mexican American.
Ravizza interprets this as a "min
imum of 350 more" employees
from these groups by Anril,
19G9. He would have to triple
the minority group employment
rate, but is "confident" he can
do it.
As a first step he expects to
hire a black "Minority Emloy
ment Representative" within the
next two weeks to work with
him in recruiting, training and
follow-up counseling.
Other action will include a
point-by-point implementation of
a publicity campaign proposed
in March by Negro Prof. James
L. Gibbs. This would widely pub
licize Stanford's desire to give
special help to minority group
applicants and educate all Uni
versity staff on the University's
new policies.
Beyond that, Ravizza has pro
posed special rules for all Uni
versity departments to give mi
nority groups a first chance at
filling a wide variety of job
openings. More formal and ex
tensive recruiting of blacks and
Mexican-Americans will also be
needed, Ravizza says.
"What we've had so far are
positive programs, but they're
very small," Ravizza says. He ar
gues that the Personnel Office
alone can not overcome imbal
