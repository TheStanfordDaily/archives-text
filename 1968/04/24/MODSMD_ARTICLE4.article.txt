## 
### 
The Stanford chapter of Alpha
Sigma Phi urged in a resolu
tion Monday that all discrimina
tion policies of local Alpha Sig
chapters be prohibited.
Acording to house president
Mike Greeve, Alpha Sigma Phi
national has no discrimination
policy, but the purpose of the
resolution "is to force the na
tional fraternity to make a posi
tive commitment."
In a resolution passed unan
imously the Stanford Alpha
Sigs urged that the "National
Constitution explicitly prohibit
all discriminatory clauses con
cerning race, creed, color, or
national origin from the gov
erning provisions of the respec
tive chapters."
The present national policy is

derived from a statement by the
Grand Council that there is
nothing in their regulations
"which restricts undergraduate
members of a chapter of Alpha
Sigma Phi from selecting a man
because of race, creed, color, or
national origin."
The Stanford chapter, accord
ing to Greene, has notified its
alumni of its beliefs and have
already received much response.
They also hope to adopt the
resolution at a meeting this
weekend of Western Alpha Sig
chapters, and pass it at the na
tional convention this summer.
They also would like to set up
a National Review Board to in
vestigate and take action on
complaints of selective prejud
ice in Alpha Sigma Phi.
