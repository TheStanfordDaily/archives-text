## King Killed For $1,000,000? 
### 
DALTON, Ga. (AP) — A con
victed murderer who was in
prison with the mysterious
James Earl Ray, now hunted in
the slaying of Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr., said Tuesday he heard
Ray say he would be willing to
try to collect $1 million for kill
ing the civil rights leader.
Raymond Curtis, 40, the same
age as Ray, is serving a life
sentence at Whitfield County
jail. Curtis said he and Ray
were prisoners at the Missouri
State Penitentiary when John F.
Kennedy was assassinated Nov.
22, 1963, in Dallas, Tex.
"Another boy said, 'Well,
there's a million-dollar bounty
to get King.' King was running
his mouth pretty good then. Ray
said, 'If there is a million-dollar
bounty on King, I believe I can
collect it,' " Curtis said in an in
terview.
• Peace Talks May Re
IS ear, Says U Thant
PARIS (AP) — U Thant, op
timistic about preliminary talks
between the United States and
North Vietnam, said Tuesday he

hoped they will begin shortly
"perhaps even this week."
Rumors rippled around world
capitals that a site already had
been agreed upon, but a State
Department spokesman in
Washington declared: "You can
say flatly that no agreement has
been reached."
Talking with reporters at the
airport before leaving for New
York, the U.N. secretary-gener
al appeared to belittle the hag
gling that has gone on between
North Vietnam and the United
States over a meeting place.
He said that Phnom Penh,
Cambodia's capital, Warsaw,
Paris or Geneva "are the cities
where these preliminary talks
could be held."
The United States has reject
ed Phnom Penh because it has
no relations with Cambodia and
Warsaw because as a Commu
nist nation it is not neutral in
the war. The North Vietnamese
have cold-shouldered the U.S.
suggestion they meet at Gene
va.
• White Rights March?
NEW YORK (AP) — Negro

leader Whitney Young Jr. sug
gested Tuesday that top echelon
white leaders organize a huge
"white march" on Washington
to demonstrate white America's
commitment to racial equality.
Such a march of hundreds of
thousands of whites, followed up
by white marches on city halls
all across the country, is "the
last chance" to avoid rebellion
by poor and frustrated Negroes,
the executive director of the Na
tional Urban League said.
"Black people have marched
for a long time . . . and it hasn't
gotten us much more than sore
feet," he told about 700 newspa
per publishers at the American
Newspaper Publishers Associa
tion annual meeting.
Young said the white march
would demonstrate to Congress
it must regard the urban crisis
as its top priority. It would tell
white Americans, he said, that
they must end their "conspiracy
of silence and injustice" toward
the Negro and it would show the
Negro that there is cause for
hope in a white-dominated so
ciety.

• S. Africa Voted Out
LAUSANNE, Switzerland
(AP) —South Africa was offi
cially voted out of the Mexico
City Olympics Tuesday.
The International Olympic
Committee said a majority of
its 71 members had voted to
withdraw the invitation to South
Africa to compete in the Oct.
12-27 Games.
A simple majority of 36 was
required, but an lOC sopkesman
said at least 40 votes already
have come in against South Af

in yet, he added.
This reversed an lOC verdict
decided by a postal vote during
the Winter Olympics at Greno

seven weeks ago.
