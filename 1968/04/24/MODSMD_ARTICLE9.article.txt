# The 						Washington Merry-Go-Round
## Vietnamese Diseases Spread 
### Drew Pearson 
WASHINGTON — Nature is
waging warfare against both
sides in Vietnam, and some of
the germs are beginning to infil
trate into the United States.
Half the Gls in our battlefield
hospitals are sent there by mi
crobes and parasites, not enemy
bullets. And the Viet Cong,
without proper innoculations
and sanitary facilities, often liv
ing in swamps and forests, are
even more vulnerable to these
diseases than are Americans.
The germs thrive in the dank
cities and the hot, humid coun
tryside where our troops are sta
tioned. With half-a-million ser
vicemen rotating through Viet
nam each year, the contagious
diseases and exotic fevers of
Asia can easily be transported
to America.
Our troops pick up these di
seases merely from sloshing
through the rice paddies or rustl
ing through the tall elephant
grass. The guerillas who are
killed may be more deadly dead
than alive. Their bodies may
be ridden with diseases, ready
to transfer to the unwary vic
tors.
Malaria and hepatitis are ram
pant. Tetanus, typhus and tuber
culosis have increased. More
than 38,000 cholera cases wero
reported between 1965 and 1968.
And Navy doctors estimate that
30 per cent of the prostitutes in
Vietnam have venereal disease.
Terrifying Export
Despite every precaution,
these diseases clearly are being
exported. Plague infection has
been discovered in the rodents
and fleas at every major port
and airfield in Vietnam. In recent
weeks, the terrifying disease has
suddenly appeared in two coast
al towns in Indonesia.
Plague is found in rats that
live around human habitation,
and is transmitted by flea bites.
More than 95 per cent of the
world's plague cases have been
discovered in Vietnam, and all
six of the disease's varieties have
been found in 27 of the 47 prov
inces.
Fortunately, only 10 suspect

ed cases have been detected
among the Gls who are innocu
lated against plague. Yet the in
fected rats and fleas at Viet
nam's harbors and airports could
spread the disease around the
world if they manage to slip
aboard departing ships and
planes.
The authorities, of course, are
alert to the danger. There is con
stant rat surveillance at all de
barkation points. Ships are re
quired to fasten rat guards to
the great cables that fasten the
vessels to the docks, so rats

can't scamper aboard. Rat-infest
ed warehouses are fumigated.
These safeguards, however,
are by no means foolproof. Doc
tors have told us that the U.S.
military has been careless with
cargo containers around air
ports. These metal cases come
in varying sizes and are welded
shut when packed with cargo.
But it would be easy for rats
to slip into empty containers
awaiting shipment back to the
U.S.
Returning soldiers are also
bringing malaria with them back

to the U.S. The disease has in
creased tenfold in this country
during the last two years. Doc
tors fear even more cases will
be reported as more veterans
come home.
Servicemen are also bringing
home infectious hepatitis, known
in its milder form as yellow
jaundice. The most celebrated
carrier is Secretary of Defense
Clark Clifford, who was stricken
with hepatitis while in Vietnam
on a special fact-finding tour for
the White House.

waging warfare against both
sides in Vietnam, and some of
the germs are beginning to infil
trate into the United States.
Half the Gls in our battlefield
hospitals are sent there by mi
crobes and parasites, not enemy
bullets. And the Viet Cong,
without proper innoculations
and sanitary facilities, often liv
ing in swamps and forests, are
even more vulnerable to these
diseases than are Americans.
The germs thrive in the dank
cities and the hot, humid coun
tryside where our troops are sta
tioned. With half-a-million ser
vicemen rotating through Viet
nam each year, the contagious
diseases and exotic fevers of
Asia can easily be transported
to America.
Our troops pick up these di
seases merely from sloshing
through the rice paddies or rustl
ing through the tall elephant
grass. The guerillas who are
killed may be more deadly dead
than alive. Their bodies may
be ridden with diseases, ready
to transfer to the unwary vic
tors.
Malaria and hepatitis are ram
pant. Tetanus, typhus and tuber
culosis have increased. More
than 38,000 cholera cases wero
reported between 1965 and 1968.
And Navy doctors estimate that
30 per cent of the prostitutes in
Vietnam have venereal disease.
Terrifying Export
Despite every precaution,
these diseases clearly are being
exported. Plague infection has
been discovered in the rodents
and fleas at every major port
and airfield in Vietnam. In recent
weeks, the terrifying disease has
suddenly appeared in two coast
al towns in Indonesia.
Plague is found in rats that
live around human habitation,
and is transmitted by flea bites.
More than 95 per cent of the
world's plague cases have been
discovered in Vietnam, and all
six of the disease's varieties have
been found in 27 of the 47 prov
inces.
Fortunately, only 10 suspect

ed cases have been detected
among the Gls who are innocu
lated against plague. Yet the in
fected rats and fleas at Viet
nam's harbors and airports could
spread the disease around the
world if they manage to slip
aboard departing ships and
planes.
The authorities, of course, are
alert to the danger. There is con
stant rat surveillance at all de
barkation points. Ships are re
quired to fasten rat guards to
the great cables that fasten the
vessels to the docks, so rats

can't scamper aboard. Rat-infest
ed warehouses are fumigated.
These safeguards, however,
are by no means foolproof. Doc
tors have told us that the U.S.
military has been careless with
cargo containers around air
ports. These metal cases come
in varying sizes and are welded
shut when packed with cargo.
But it would be easy for rats
to slip into empty containers
awaiting shipment back to the
U.S.
Returning soldiers are also
bringing malaria with them back

to the U.S. The disease has in
creased tenfold in this country
during the last two years. Doc
tors fear even more cases will
be reported as more veterans
come home.
Servicemen are also bringing
home infectious hepatitis, known
in its milder form as yellow
jaundice. The most celebrated
carrier is Secretary of Defense
Clark Clifford, who was stricken
with hepatitis while in Vietnam
on a special fact-finding tour for
the White House.
