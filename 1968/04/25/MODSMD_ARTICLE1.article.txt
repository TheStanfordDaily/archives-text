# Doubts Voiced On Giving To King Fund
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Just as dollars have started to pour into the
Martin Luther King Memorial Fund, some
doubts have been raised by many on campus
about the use of the money and the wisdom
of contributing to the University instead of
directly to black ghettos.
"Give it to the Black Panthers" has been the
argument heard more and more frequently as
students and faculty take a second look at the
fund-raising cause that attracted *so , much
emotional support after King's assassination
April 5.
In the student legislature Thursday a reso
lution asking that the student discount at
the Bookstore—amounting to more than $200,-
000 a year—be given to the King fund was
tabled after some members attacked the idea
of giving money to the University. "This fund
will just bring twelve more bourgeois Negroes
to Stanford," argued Rich Bogart. He pro
posed a donation to the Black Panther milit
ants instead.
Branner Hall put off a decision this week
on how to donate its $1,000 social fund be
cause a small group of residents demanded
a vote to choose between the King fund and
the Panthers.
The ballots were never counted, because the
freshmen, acting on the advice of faculty resi
dent Lawrence Bennigson, decided to continue
discussing other ways the money could be
used to aid the black community.

"We didn't want to just give the money to
the University with no say on how its spent,"
says Branner freshman Adam Bennion.
"Blacks are already getting priority on schol
arships at Stanford. Maybe we can figure out
something better to use it for than the King
fund."
Another source of skepticism toward the
enegetically-promoted King fund has been let
ters to the Daily. Dennis Starkovich wrote
last week that "a scholarship fund would in
fluence the lives of no more than a few black
men every year," while the Black Panthers aid
the ghetto, which "really needs help."
Another letter, from Mark Riley and
Richard Sack, blasted the King fund as
"hypocrisy."
Meanwhile every student and University
employee has been sent a leter asking for
cash contributions to the fund or permission
to deduct a monthly contribution from pay
checks . The faculty-staff drive, under the
co-chairmanship of Religion Prof. William A.
Clebsch and Associate Dean of Research Rob
ert H. Moulton, Jr., had collected $29,724
from 358 employees as of yesterday. Most of
the contributions—s22,3Bs—will be deducted
from paychecks over the next year.
The student drive, which started a week
later, has netted about $3,600 cash. But stu
dent groups and residences have already
pledged more than $12,000.

The King fund was born three days after
the black leader's death. A group of 35 faculty
and staff wrote a letter to the Daily pledging
contributions for a "scholarship fund for black
students."
Now the combined student and faculty
staff funis are being handled by the Gen
eral Secretary's office, the University's regu
lar fund-raising agency. The recent mail
ings, complete with IBM pledge card and
business-reply envelope, are being supple
mented by "follow-up" visits by representa
tives in each University department. Stu
dent fund raisers will be recruited for each
residence.
The University doesn't want to commit the
King fund to a single, limited purpose, accord
ing to Vice President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson. "We want to use it to help ac
complish our total program for minority
groups," he says. Yearly costs of this program
will be $600,000 to $1,000,000 by 1969. Cuthbert
son expects "the major call on this fund will
be for financial aid to students."
But the proper use of the student contri
butions has been a cause of disagreement be
tween the two co-chairmen of the student
drive, business graduate Warren R. Lyons
and senior Rod Levine.
"I'm not entirely happy with the present
situation," says Levine. "Because this is an
ad-hoc and quickly organized drive, there is

little definition. We know we want to do some
thing, but we don't know what or perhaps
even why."
"Personally I think contributions to the
Oakland ghetto might be more important,"
says Levine. "But contributions to Stanford's
action is important, too."
Levine believes students should "be more
involved" in how their contributions are used.
He doesn't want the University to simply
apply the fund to meet the general goals in
black enrollment, tutoring and employment.
New projects should be considered, Levine
argues, including direct grants to East Palo
Alto groups, "low cost housing on campus,"
and even aid to the Black Panthers. Levine
points out that Yale University recently made
a flat $40,000 gift to projects in the New Haven
ghetto.
Co-chairman Lyons, however, wants the
University to promise to confine the student
King fund to "student aid uses at Stanford."
Daryl Pearson, the general secretary, said yes
terday that he had agreed to keep a separate
accounting of the student contributions.
But it's clear that students and others are
beginning to have second thoughts al>out the
most effective use of their money. Michael
Weinstein, speaker of the student legisla
ture, says he will ask that special conditions
be put on any appropriation by the ASSU
for black aid programs.

University administrators like Cuthbortson
are hardly counting on the King fund to meet
the new expenses of (he minority group pro
grams. They have sent out directives to staff
asking "reassessment" of priorities so a "re
allocation of resources" can be made to over
come d(> fai'to discrimination. A new effort has
started to secure foundation and government
support, especially for the costs of the pilot
program for ten "marginal" minority students
and the compensatory training for minority
employees.
During the 1968-69 fiscal year, Stanford's
new commitments will cost about $100-150,000,
mostly for the pilot program tutorials and fi
nancial aid and for new admissions and em
ployment recruiting staff.
Heavier yearly costs will come in 1969-70,
with $150-200,000 for recruitment and train
ing of minority group employees and $450-
700,000 for financial aid and tutoring for 175
more minority students.
Eventually the yearly cost of the programs
will exceed $1.2 million, President Wallace
Sterling predicts.
And after the relatively tiny King fund is
consumed to help pay the initial costs, Stan
ford will have to meet these commitments by
taking money from other uses in the operat
ing budget. Next year this budget totals $46.5
million, up from $43.5 million in 1967-68. The
increase mostly goes to pay four to per
cent salary hikes for all Stanford employees.

New projects should be considered, Levine
argues, including direct grants to East Palo
Alto groups, "low cost housing on campus,"
and even aid to the Black Panthers. Levine
points out that Yale University recently made
a flat $40,000 gift to projects in the New Haven
ghetto.
Co-chairman Lyons, however, wants the
University to promise to confine the student
King fund to "student aid uses at Stanford."
Daryl Pearson, the general secretary, said yes
terday that he had agreed to keep a separate
accounting of the student contributions.
But it's clear that students and others are
beginning to have second thoughts al>out the
most effective use of their money. Michael
Weinstein, speaker of the student legisla
ture, says he will ask that special conditions
be put on any appropriation by the ASSU
for black aid programs.

University administrators like Cuthbortson
are hardly counting on the King fund to meet
the new expenses of (he minority group pro
grams. They have sent out directives to staff
asking "reassessment" of priorities so a "re
allocation of resources" can be made to over
come d(> fai'to discrimination. A new effort has
started to secure foundation and government
support, especially for the costs of the pilot
program for ten "marginal" minority students
and the compensatory training for minority
employees.
During the 1968-69 fiscal year, Stanford's
new commitments will cost about $100-150,000,
mostly for the pilot program tutorials and fi
nancial aid and for new admissions and em
ployment recruiting staff.
Heavier yearly costs will come in 1969-70,
with $150-200,000 for recruitment and train
ing of minority group employees and $450-
700,000 for financial aid and tutoring for 175
more minority students.
Eventually the yearly cost of the programs
will exceed $1.2 million, President Wallace
Sterling predicts.
And after the relatively tiny King fund is
consumed to help pay the initial costs, Stan
ford will have to meet these commitments by
taking money from other uses in the operat
ing budget. Next year this budget totals $46.5
million, up from $43.5 million in 1967-68. The
increase mostly goes to pay four to per
cent salary hikes for all Stanford employees.
Just as dollars have started to pour into the
Martin Luther King Memorial Fund, some
doubts have been raised by many on campus
about the use of the money and the wisdom
of contributing to the University instead of
directly to black ghettos.
"Give it to the Black Panthers" has been the
argument heard more and more frequently as
students and faculty take a second look at the
fund-raising cause that attracted *so , much
emotional support after King's assassination
April 5.
In the student legislature Thursday a reso
lution asking that the student discount at
the Bookstore—amounting to more than $200,-
000 a year—be given to the King fund was
tabled after some members attacked the idea
of giving money to the University. "This fund
will just bring twelve more bourgeois Negroes
to Stanford," argued Rich Bogart. He pro
posed a donation to the Black Panther milit
ants instead.
Branner Hall put off a decision this week
on how to donate its $1,000 social fund be
cause a small group of residents demanded
a vote to choose between the King fund and
the Panthers.
The ballots were never counted, because the
freshmen, acting on the advice of faculty resi
dent Lawrence Bennigson, decided to continue
discussing other ways the money could be
used to aid the black community.

"We didn't want to just give the money to
the University with no say on how its spent,"
says Branner freshman Adam Bennion.
"Blacks are already getting priority on schol
arships at Stanford. Maybe we can figure out
something better to use it for than the King
fund."
Another source of skepticism toward the
enegetically-promoted King fund has been let
ters to the Daily. Dennis Starkovich wrote
last week that "a scholarship fund would in
fluence the lives of no more than a few black
men every year," while the Black Panthers aid
the ghetto, which "really needs help."
Another letter, from Mark Riley and
Richard Sack, blasted the King fund as
"hypocrisy."
Meanwhile every student and University
employee has been sent a leter asking for
cash contributions to the fund or permission
to deduct a monthly contribution from pay
checks . The faculty-staff drive, under the
co-chairmanship of Religion Prof. William A.
Clebsch and Associate Dean of Research Rob
ert H. Moulton, Jr., had collected $29,724
from 358 employees as of yesterday. Most of
the contributions—s22,3Bs—will be deducted
from paychecks over the next year.
The student drive, which started a week
later, has netted about $3,600 cash. But stu
dent groups and residences have already
pledged more than $12,000.

The King fund was born three days after
the black leader's death. A group of 35 faculty
and staff wrote a letter to the Daily pledging
contributions for a "scholarship fund for black
students."
Now the combined student and faculty
staff funis are being handled by the Gen
eral Secretary's office, the University's regu
lar fund-raising agency. The recent mail
ings, complete with IBM pledge card and
business-reply envelope, are being supple
mented by "follow-up" visits by representa
tives in each University department. Stu
dent fund raisers will be recruited for each
residence.
The University doesn't want to commit the
King fund to a single, limited purpose, accord
ing to Vice President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson. "We want to use it to help ac
complish our total program for minority
groups," he says. Yearly costs of this program
will be $600,000 to $1,000,000 by 1969. Cuthbert
son expects "the major call on this fund will
be for financial aid to students."
But the proper use of the student contri
butions has been a cause of disagreement be
tween the two co-chairmen of the student
drive, business graduate Warren R. Lyons
and senior Rod Levine.
"I'm not entirely happy with the present
situation," says Levine. "Because this is an
ad-hoc and quickly organized drive, there is

little definition. We know we want to do some
thing, but we don't know what or perhaps
even why."
"Personally I think contributions to the
Oakland ghetto might be more important,"
says Levine. "But contributions to Stanford's
action is important, too."
Levine believes students should "be more
involved" in how their contributions are used.
He doesn't want the University to simply

Clebsch and Associate Dean of Research Rob
ert H. Moulton, Jr., had collected $29,724
from 358 employees as of yesterday. Most of
the contributions—s22,3Bs—will be deducted
from paychecks over the next year.
The student drive, which started a week
later, has netted about $3,600 cash. But stu
dent groups and residences have already
pledged more than $12,000.

The King fund was born three days after
the black leader's death. A group of 35 faculty
and staff wrote a letter to the Daily pledging
contributions for a "scholarship fund for black
students."
Now the combined student and faculty
staff funis are being handled by the Gen
eral Secretary's office, the University's regu
lar fund-raising agency. The recent mail
ings, complete with IBM pledge card and
business-reply envelope, are being supple
mented by "follow-up" visits by representa
tives in each University department. Stu
dent fund raisers will be recruited for each
residence.
The University doesn't want to commit the
King fund to a single, limited purpose, accord
ing to Vice President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson. "We want to use it to help ac
complish our total program for minority
groups," he says. Yearly costs of this program
will be $600,000 to $1,000,000 by 1969. Cuthbert
son expects "the major call on this fund will
be for financial aid to students."
But the proper use of the student contri
butions has been a cause of disagreement be
tween the two co-chairmen of the student
drive, business graduate Warren R. Lyons
and senior Rod Levine.
"I'm not entirely happy with the present
situation," says Levine. "Because this is an
ad-hoc and quickly organized drive, there is

little definition. We know we want to do some
thing, but we don't know what or perhaps
even why."
"Personally I think contributions to the
Oakland ghetto might be more important,"
says Levine. "But contributions to Stanford's
action is important, too."
Levine believes students should "be more
involved" in how their contributions are used.
He doesn't want the University to simply
apply the fund to meet the general goals in
black enrollment, tutoring and employment.
New projects should be considered, Levine
argues, including direct grants to East Palo
Alto groups, "low cost housing on campus,"
and even aid to the Black Panthers. Levine
points out that Yale University recently made
a flat $40,000 gift to projects in the New Haven
ghetto.
Co-chairman Lyons, however, wants the
University to promise to confine the student
King fund to "student aid uses at Stanford."
Daryl Pearson, the general secretary, said yes
terday that he had agreed to keep a separate
accounting of the student contributions.
But it's clear that students and others are
beginning to have second thoughts al>out the
most effective use of their money. Michael
Weinstein, speaker of the student legisla
ture, says he will ask that special conditions
be put on any appropriation by the ASSU
for black aid programs.

University administrators like Cuthbortson
are hardly counting on the King fund to meet
the new expenses of (he minority group pro
grams. They have sent out directives to staff
asking "reassessment" of priorities so a "re
allocation of resources" can be made to over
come d(> fai'to discrimination. A new effort has
started to secure foundation and government
support, especially for the costs of the pilot
program for ten "marginal" minority students
and the compensatory training for minority
employees.
During the 1968-69 fiscal year, Stanford's
new commitments will cost about $100-150,000,
mostly for the pilot program tutorials and fi
nancial aid and for new admissions and em
ployment recruiting staff.
Heavier yearly costs will come in 1969-70,
with $150-200,000 for recruitment and train
ing of minority group employees and $450-
700,000 for financial aid and tutoring for 175
more minority students.
Eventually the yearly cost of the programs
will exceed $1.2 million, President Wallace
Sterling predicts.
And after the relatively tiny King fund is
consumed to help pay the initial costs, Stan
ford will have to meet these commitments by
taking money from other uses in the operat
ing budget. Next year this budget totals $46.5
million, up from $43.5 million in 1967-68. The
increase mostly goes to pay four to per
cent salary hikes for all Stanford employees.
Just as dollars have started to pour into the
Martin Luther King Memorial Fund, some
doubts have been raised by many on campus
about the use of the money and the wisdom
of contributing to the University instead of
directly to black ghettos.
"Give it to the Black Panthers" has been the
argument heard more and more frequently as
students and faculty take a second look at the
fund-raising cause that attracted *so , much
emotional support after King's assassination
April 5.
In the student legislature Thursday a reso
lution asking that the student discount at
the Bookstore—amounting to more than $200,-
000 a year—be given to the King fund was
tabled after some members attacked the idea
of giving money to the University. "This fund
will just bring twelve more bourgeois Negroes
to Stanford," argued Rich Bogart. He pro
posed a donation to the Black Panther milit
ants instead.
Branner Hall put off a decision this week
on how to donate its $1,000 social fund be
cause a small group of residents demanded
a vote to choose between the King fund and
the Panthers.
The ballots were never counted, because the
freshmen, acting on the advice of faculty resi
dent Lawrence Bennigson, decided to continue
discussing other ways the money could be
used to aid the black community.

"We didn't want to just give the money to
the University with no say on how its spent,"
says Branner freshman Adam Bennion.
"Blacks are already getting priority on schol
arships at Stanford. Maybe we can figure out
something better to use it for than the King
fund."
Another source of skepticism toward the
enegetically-promoted King fund has been let
ters to the Daily. Dennis Starkovich wrote
last week that "a scholarship fund would in
fluence the lives of no more than a few black
men every year," while the Black Panthers aid
the ghetto, which "really needs help."
Another letter, from Mark Riley and
Richard Sack, blasted the King fund as
"hypocrisy."
Meanwhile every student and University
employee has been sent a leter asking for
cash contributions to the fund or permission
to deduct a monthly contribution from pay
checks . The faculty-staff drive, under the
co-chairmanship of Religion Prof. William A.

million, up from $43.5 million in 1967-68. The
increase mostly goes to pay four to per
cent salary hikes for all Stanford employees.
Just as dollars have started to pour into the
Martin Luther King Memorial Fund, some
doubts have been raised by many on campus
about the use of the money and the wisdom
of contributing to the University instead of
directly to black ghettos.
"Give it to the Black Panthers" has been the
argument heard more and more frequently as
students and faculty take a second look at the
fund-raising cause that attracted *so , much
emotional support after King's assassination
April 5.
In the student legislature Thursday a reso
lution asking that the student discount at
the Bookstore—amounting to more than $200,-
000 a year—be given to the King fund was
tabled after some members attacked the idea
of giving money to the University. "This fund
will just bring twelve more bourgeois Negroes
to Stanford," argued Rich Bogart. He pro
posed a donation to the Black Panther milit
ants instead.
Branner Hall put off a decision this week
on how to donate its $1,000 social fund be
cause a small group of residents demanded
a vote to choose between the King fund and
the Panthers.
The ballots were never counted, because the
freshmen, acting on the advice of faculty resi
dent Lawrence Bennigson, decided to continue
discussing other ways the money could be
used to aid the black community.

"We didn't want to just give the money to
the University with no say on how its spent,"
says Branner freshman Adam Bennion.
"Blacks are already getting priority on schol
arships at Stanford. Maybe we can figure out
something better to use it for than the King
fund."
Another source of skepticism toward the
enegetically-promoted King fund has been let
ters to the Daily. Dennis Starkovich wrote
last week that "a scholarship fund would in
fluence the lives of no more than a few black
men every year," while the Black Panthers aid
the ghetto, which "really needs help."
Another letter, from Mark Riley and
Richard Sack, blasted the King fund as
"hypocrisy."
Meanwhile every student and University
employee has been sent a leter asking for
cash contributions to the fund or permission
to deduct a monthly contribution from pay
checks . The faculty-staff drive, under the
co-chairmanship of Religion Prof. William A.
Clebsch and Associate Dean of Research Rob
ert H. Moulton, Jr., had collected $29,724
from 358 employees as of yesterday. Most of
the contributions—s22,3Bs—will be deducted
from paychecks over the next year.
The student drive, which started a week
later, has netted about $3,600 cash. But stu
dent groups and residences have already
pledged more than $12,000.

The King fund was born three days after
the black leader's death. A group of 35 faculty
and staff wrote a letter to the Daily pledging
contributions for a "scholarship fund for black
students."
Now the combined student and faculty
staff funis are being handled by the Gen
eral Secretary's office, the University's regu
lar fund-raising agency. The recent mail
ings, complete with IBM pledge card and
business-reply envelope, are being supple
mented by "follow-up" visits by representa
tives in each University department. Stu
dent fund raisers will be recruited for each
residence.
The University doesn't want to commit the
King fund to a single, limited purpose, accord
ing to Vice President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson. "We want to use it to help ac
complish our total program for minority
groups," he says. Yearly costs of this program
will be $600,000 to $1,000,000 by 1969. Cuthbert
son expects "the major call on this fund will
be for financial aid to students."
But the proper use of the student contri
butions has been a cause of disagreement be
tween the two co-chairmen of the student
drive, business graduate Warren R. Lyons
and senior Rod Levine.
"I'm not entirely happy with the present
situation," says Levine. "Because this is an
ad-hoc and quickly organized drive, there is

little definition. We know we want to do some
thing, but we don't know what or perhaps
even why."
"Personally I think contributions to the
Oakland ghetto might be more important,"
says Levine. "But contributions to Stanford's
action is important, too."
Levine believes students should "be more
involved" in how their contributions are used.
He doesn't want the University to simply
apply the fund to meet the general goals in
black enrollment, tutoring and employment.
New projects should be considered, Levine
argues, including direct grants to East Palo
Alto groups, "low cost housing on campus,"
and even aid to the Black Panthers. Levine
points out that Yale University recently made
a flat $40,000 gift to projects in the New Haven
ghetto.
Co-chairman Lyons, however, wants the
University to promise to confine the student
King fund to "student aid uses at Stanford."
Daryl Pearson, the general secretary, said yes
terday that he had agreed to keep a separate
accounting of the student contributions.
But it's clear that students and others are
beginning to have second thoughts al>out the
most effective use of their money. Michael
Weinstein, speaker of the student legisla
ture, says he will ask that special conditions
be put on any appropriation by the ASSU
for black aid programs.

University administrators like Cuthbortson
are hardly counting on the King fund to meet
the new expenses of (he minority group pro
grams. They have sent out directives to staff
asking "reassessment" of priorities so a "re
allocation of resources" can be made to over
come d(> fai'to discrimination. A new effort has
started to secure foundation and government
support, especially for the costs of the pilot
program for ten "marginal" minority students
and the compensatory training for minority
employees.
During the 1968-69 fiscal year, Stanford's
new commitments will cost about $100-150,000,
mostly for the pilot program tutorials and fi
nancial aid and for new admissions and em
ployment recruiting staff.
Heavier yearly costs will come in 1969-70,
with $150-200,000 for recruitment and train
ing of minority group employees and $450-
700,000 for financial aid and tutoring for 175
more minority students.
Eventually the yearly cost of the programs
will exceed $1.2 million, President Wallace
Sterling predicts.
And after the relatively tiny King fund is
consumed to help pay the initial costs, Stan
ford will have to meet these commitments by
taking money from other uses in the operat
ing budget. Next year this budget totals $46.5
million, up from $43.5 million in 1967-68. The
increase mostly goes to pay four to per
cent salary hikes for all Stanford employees.
