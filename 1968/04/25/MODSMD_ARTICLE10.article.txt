# New Pot Law
## 
### 
The California Assembly passed yesterday what many have
billed as a significant change in the state's marijuana possession
regulations. Under pressure from California judges, the law
makers approved altering the present state law which makes pos
session of marijuana a felony, punishable by up to 10 years in
prison.
The proposed law leaves it up to the judge's discretion to
prosecute marijuana possession as either a felony or a mis
demeanor.
Since possession of marijuana still remains a punishable crime,
there is no reason to suppose the change will make police enforce
ment any less rigorous.
Nor is there any reason to suppose that sentencing will be any
lighter either. Under the old law many judges handling cases of
defendants under 21 waived the usual felony prison term. Instead
these judges placed those convicted on probation with the re
quirement that they serve three or more months in jail.
We welcome any new law as a sign of change in the legislature's
archaic attitude towards marijuana. Eventually we hope the law
makers will overcome fear and superstition and eliminate all
penalties against use of marijuana.
