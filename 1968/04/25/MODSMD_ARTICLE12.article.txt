# The 						Capitol Scenes
## Peace Talks Are Question Of Face 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON—"The trouble
with small wars," said my friend,
Finsterman, who is in charge
of small wars at the State De
partment, "is that both sides
think they have won. We think
we've defeated the North Viet
namese and they are sure that
they have defeated us. Under
these circumstances it's not only
difficult to arrive at a peace set
tlement, it's impossible to agree
on a site to even discuss it."
"But didn't we say we'd go
anywhere, anytime to discuss
peace with Hanoi?"
"Ah, yes, but we didn't say
we'd go to Cambodia or War
saw."
"That's true," I admitted.
"We've got them there."
"You must keep in mind that
we've offered Hanoi the choice

of 15 sites and they've only of
fered us the choice of two."
"It sounds like a body count
to me."
"Their two sites have many
drawbacks. Warsaw is in a Com
munist country, and Cambodia
is a neutralist nation where, un
fortunately, we have no diplo
matic relations. In Warsaw, we
know it would be much easier
for them to bug us than for us
to bug them. You can't have a
peace conference without recip
rocal bugging."
"What's wrong with Cambo
dia?"
"Besides the fact we have no
diplomatic relations there, Cam
bodia was the first site the
North Vietnamese selected, so
naturally we had to reject or
it would look as if were going

to the conference table from a
position of weakness."
"Why did North Vietnam turn
down Geneva?"
"Because that's the first site
we suggested. If they accepted
our first suggestion it would
look as if they were going to
the conference table as the de
feated party."
"But we must have known
that before we suggested Gene
va. Why did we suggest it?"
"We had to suggest some
place," Finsterman said. "You
see, the trick of these negotia
tions ir for both sides to sug
gest places because they are sure
the other side won't go there.
The one you want to go to you
never mention and neither do
they."
"Paris hasn't been mention
ed," I said.
"Exactly. If we offered to
meet Hanoi in Paris they would
reject it out of hand. If they
said they would meet us in Paris
we would be hard put to ac
cept it as it would look as though
we were bowing to them. Paris

makes sense to both sides at the
moment because neither one has
suggested it as a meeting place."
"You'll have to admit," I said,
"that the average person is very
confused about the fact that we
can't agree on a site to talk.
Why couldn't we announce that
under no conditions would the
United States meet Hanoi in
Paris? When they heard that we
didn't want to go to Paris they
might insist on meeting us in
Paris and no place else. Would
n't that resolve the problem?"
"Absolutely not. For one thing,
if we announced that we didn't
want to go to Paris and then we
agreed to Paris, it would be a
diplomatic victory for the Com
munists. Besides, if we met in
Paris it would make De Gaulle
look very good, which is some
thing we would prefer to avoid
if we possible can."
"But if we never meet," I said,
"then the chances for peace
might run out on us and we'll
have to continue the war, which
is something I understand the

United States doesn't want to
do."
"It isn't a question of meet
ing. The real problem is to meet
in good faith. Hanoi has shown
bad faith by rejecting the sites
we offered for a peace meet
ing."
"And they say we have shown
bad faith by rejecting the sites
they have suggested. Who is
right?"
"To quote our great secretary
of state, it depends on whose
side you're on."
"If you had your choice of
any site in the world to hold
your conference, where would
you select?"
"Ambassador Averill Harri
man's house in Georgetown. The
communications are excellent,
the food is good and everyone
knows that Georgetown is ab
solutely neutral, in word,
thought and deed."

tlement, it's impossible to agree
on a site to even discuss it."
"But didn't we say we'd go
anywhere, anytime to discuss
peace with Hanoi?"
"Ah, yes, but we didn't say
we'd go to Cambodia or War
saw."
"That's true," I admitted.
"We've got them there."
"You must keep in mind that
we've offered Hanoi the choice

of 15 sites and they've only of
fered us the choice of two."
"It sounds like a body count
to me."
"Their two sites have many
drawbacks. Warsaw is in a Com
munist country, and Cambodia
is a neutralist nation where, un
fortunately, we have no diplo
matic relations. In Warsaw, we
know it would be much easier
for them to bug us than for us
to bug them. You can't have a
peace conference without recip
rocal bugging."
"What's wrong with Cambo
dia?"
"Besides the fact we have no
diplomatic relations there, Cam
bodia was the first site the
North Vietnamese selected, so
naturally we had to reject or
it would look as if were going

to the conference table from a
position of weakness."
"Why did North Vietnam turn
down Geneva?"
"Because that's the first site
we suggested. If they accepted
our first suggestion it would
look as if they were going to
the conference table as the de
feated party."
"But we must have known
that before we suggested Gene
va. Why did we suggest it?"
"We had to suggest some
place," Finsterman said. "You
see, the trick of these negotia
tions ir for both sides to sug
gest places because they are sure
the other side won't go there.
The one you want to go to you
never mention and neither do
they."
"Paris hasn't been mention
ed," I said.
"Exactly. If we offered to
meet Hanoi in Paris they would
reject it out of hand. If they
said they would meet us in Paris
we would be hard put to ac
cept it as it would look as though
we were bowing to them. Paris

makes sense to both sides at the
moment because neither one has
suggested it as a meeting place."
"You'll have to admit," I said,
"that the average person is very
confused about the fact that we
can't agree on a site to talk.
Why couldn't we announce that
under no conditions would the
United States meet Hanoi in
Paris? When they heard that we
didn't want to go to Paris they
might insist on meeting us in
Paris and no place else. Would
n't that resolve the problem?"
"Absolutely not. For one thing,
if we announced that we didn't
want to go to Paris and then we
agreed to Paris, it would be a
diplomatic victory for the Com
munists. Besides, if we met in
Paris it would make De Gaulle
look very good, which is some
thing we would prefer to avoid
if we possible can."
"But if we never meet," I said,
"then the chances for peace
might run out on us and we'll
have to continue the war, which
is something I understand the

United States doesn't want to
do."
"It isn't a question of meet
ing. The real problem is to meet
in good faith. Hanoi has shown
bad faith by rejecting the sites
we offered for a peace meet
ing."
"And they say we have shown
bad faith by rejecting the sites
they have suggested. Who is
right?"
"To quote our great secretary
of state, it depends on whose
side you're on."
"If you had your choice of
any site in the world to hold
your conference, where would
you select?"
"Ambassador Averill Harri
man's house in Georgetown. The
communications are excellent,
the food is good and everyone
knows that Georgetown is ab
solutely neutral, in word,
thought and deed."

we've offered Hanoi the choice

of 15 sites and they've only of
fered us the choice of two."
"It sounds like a body count
to me."
"Their two sites have many
drawbacks. Warsaw is in a Com
munist country, and Cambodia
is a neutralist nation where, un
fortunately, we have no diplo
matic relations. In Warsaw, we
know it would be much easier
for them to bug us than for us
to bug them. You can't have a
peace conference without recip
rocal bugging."
"What's wrong with Cambo
dia?"
"Besides the fact we have no
diplomatic relations there, Cam
bodia was the first site the
North Vietnamese selected, so
naturally we had to reject or
it would look as if were going

to the conference table from a
position of weakness."
"Why did North Vietnam turn
down Geneva?"
"Because that's the first site
we suggested. If they accepted
our first suggestion it would
look as if they were going to
the conference table as the de
feated party."
"But we must have known
that before we suggested Gene
va. Why did we suggest it?"
"We had to suggest some
place," Finsterman said. "You
see, the trick of these negotia
tions ir for both sides to sug
gest places because they are sure
the other side won't go there.
The one you want to go to you
never mention and neither do
they."
"Paris hasn't been mention
ed," I said.
"Exactly. If we offered to
meet Hanoi in Paris they would
reject it out of hand. If they
said they would meet us in Paris
we would be hard put to ac
cept it as it would look as though
we were bowing to them. Paris

makes sense to both sides at the
moment because neither one has
suggested it as a meeting place."
"You'll have to admit," I said,
"that the average person is very
confused about the fact that we
can't agree on a site to talk.
Why couldn't we announce that
under no conditions would the
United States meet Hanoi in
Paris? When they heard that we
didn't want to go to Paris they
might insist on meeting us in
Paris and no place else. Would
n't that resolve the problem?"
"Absolutely not. For one thing,
if we announced that we didn't
want to go to Paris and then we
agreed to Paris, it would be a
diplomatic victory for the Com
munists. Besides, if we met in
Paris it would make De Gaulle
look very good, which is some
thing we would prefer to avoid
if we possible can."
"But if we never meet," I said,
"then the chances for peace
might run out on us and we'll
have to continue the war, which
is something I understand the

United States doesn't want to
do."
"It isn't a question of meet
ing. The real problem is to meet
in good faith. Hanoi has shown
bad faith by rejecting the sites
we offered for a peace meet
ing."
"And they say we have shown
bad faith by rejecting the sites
they have suggested. Who is
right?"
"To quote our great secretary
of state, it depends on whose
side you're on."
"If you had your choice of
any site in the world to hold
your conference, where would
you select?"
"Ambassador Averill Harri
man's house in Georgetown. The
communications are excellent,
the food is good and everyone
knows that Georgetown is ab
solutely neutral, in word,
thought and deed."
