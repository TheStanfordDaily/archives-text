# The Washington Merry-Go-Round
## Berlin Protests Too Violent 
### Drew Pearson 
WASHINGTON — There are
some ominous comparisons be
tween the student riots in Berlin
and the racial riots in the United
States. Though the causes are
not the same, the overtones are
identical. They add up to the
fact that when there is a break
down in law and order it leads
to a breakdown in government,
eventually to revolution.
In the days of the Weimar Re
public, during that period fol
lowing Germany's defeat in
World War I, there were burn
ings and violence by the Right
directed against the Left. Such
left-wing revolutionaries as Rosa
Luxemburg and Karl Lieb
knecht were killed, and Walthor
Rathenau, a moderate, was shot.
Eventually violence became a
way of life in Germany and led
to the Nazi takeover.
Today the violence taking
place in Germany is from the
Left. Its origin, however, is not
as important as the fact that a
relatively small group of stu
dents is determined to make vio
lence the order of the day, just
as a small group of Negroes in
the United States is making vio
lence the order of the day.
In Hitler's day the Commu
nist advocates of violence quick
ly became Nazi advocates of
violence. It was a simple matter
for the Communist party to
merge into the Nazi party. Their
principles of force and totalitar
ianism were the same.
Likewise in America, force
and violence exercised by the

Negro minority could lead to a
revival of the Ku Klux Klan
and fascist terrorism by mem
bers of the white majority.
Recently in Berlin more than
2,000 left-wing students have
been rioting against the West
German newspapers of Axel
Springer on the trumped-up
charge that the Springer news
papers inspired the attack on
their leader Rudi Dutschke, a
follower of Mao Tse tung, who
was shot by a Nazi sympathizer,
Joseph Bachmann.
The Springer newspapers hap
pen to be the backbone of a mod
erate, free-enterprise, demo
cratic West Germany. Axel
Springer, their publisher, has
been a staunch defender of the
Jews. In recognition of his
championship of religious and
racial tolerance, he was given
an honorary degree by Brandeis
University in Boston.
Die Welt, the New York Times
of West Germany, was actually
founded by the British Army in
Hamburg, after the war, for
the purpose of establishing a
free, nongovernment-dominated
press in occupied Germany. It
has now developed into one of
the most influential free enter
prise newspapers in Europe.
Bild-Zieting, another Springer
publication, has the largest cir
culation—4,ooo,ooo daily—on the
European continent, surpassed
in the world only by the circula
tion of Tokyo newspapers.
The Springer press has stuck
to a democratic, nonviolent, pro-
American editorial policy. But

left-wing students in Germany,
taking censorship into their
own hands, proceeded to gut the
lower floor of the Springer sky
scraper in West Berlin, tear edi
tions of the newspapers to
shreds, destroy five newspaper
trucks, and for a time com
pletely disrupt the delivery' of
newsappers. They also planted
a red flag in the court of the 18-
story Springer building which
publisher Springer built along
side the Berlin wall as a token
of his determination to unite
the two Berlins.
The immediate spark which
ignited Berlin was the attack on
Rod Rudi Dutschke, just as the
spark which ignited racial riot
ing in Washington and other
American cities was the death
of Martin Luther King. But the
real issue went deeper. Dutschke
was a hater of the USA, had
denounced the Vietnam war and
burned the American flag.
Springer had supported the
United States.
Negro Censorship
The manner in which Negro
students are emulating Berlin
students in trying to suppress
freedom of expression was illu
strated not long ago at Swarth
more, the Quaker college out
side Philadelphia which for one
hundred years has kept its doors
open to Negroes. It has also
championed the right of dissent.
In exercising that right, it
invited to its campus Edgar
Brooks, a white South African
who has advocated the end of
racial barriers in his, the most

racially segregated country in
the world.
Brooks' views on integration
have been such a pain in the
nock to his own government
that South Africa was delighted
when he went to the United
States. When invited to Swarth
more, a small black power
group of about ten Negroes ob
jected. They claimed his views
were too moderate, that change
in South Africa must come not
by legislation but by force. And
they proposed using force in
the form of noise to prevent
Brooks from b heard.
The ten black power students
constituted only one-fourth of
the forty Negro students at
Swart hmore, yet they demanded
their way and were ready to
use violence to achieve it.
Finally, however, they were dis
suaded.
On the day the South African
speaker was to appear, however,
and while he was sitting on the
platform, a black power student
jumped to the platform and an
nounced, "All that you are about
to hear is a lie." He then led a
walk-out of four Negro students
and some white sympathizers.
Germany, with a new-found
democracy in the 19205, permit
ted violence and assassination to
undermine that democracy. Its
present leaders, including such
men as Chancellor Kiessinger
and publisher Springer, are de
termined that this shall not hap
pen again.
