## Is Senator McCarthy Lazy? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Peter Isard, in his letter
Wednesday, stated that he con
siders it unfair to look at Sen
ator McCarthy's voting record
issue by issue. He says that
once McCarthy's voting record
is "clarified" his position might
be considered "respectable." But
Mr. Isard does nothing to clari
fy the Senator's position.
Perhaps Mr. Isard would con
sider it significant that only four
Senators (Smathers, Tower,
Russell, and Dodd) had poorer
Senate attendance records than
did Senator McCarthy in 1967.
Senator McCarthy voted on only
66 per cent of the issues; he
failed to vote on 105 roll-call
votes (of a total of 315). And
even these figures are more fav
orable to Senator McCarthy than
the facts actually indicate for
Senators Dodd and Russell—but
not McCarthy—were absent be
cause of illness. By comparison,

Senator Kennedy's participation
record—he voted in 83 per cent
of the roll-call votes—was
slightly above the 1967 average
for Democratic Senators.
Moreover, there is reason to
believe that Senator McCarthy
failed to vote on the most cru
cial issues. Congressional Quar
terly has compiled the results
of 57 controversial votes in
which the conservative coalition
of Republicans and Southern
Democrats followed a united
course. McCarthy voted with the
conservative coalition on 13 per
cent of these issues, voted
against it on 45 per cent, and
failed to vote at all on 42 per
cent. And these were votes in
which the liberals needed every
vote they could get.
The comparable figures for
Senator Robert Kennedy show
that he voted with the coalition
on only 2 per cent of the issues
(one vote), voted against it on

86 per cent, and failed to vote
on only 12 per cent. What in
sight, I wonder, did Senator Mc-
Carthy have on over half of
these controversial issues that
convinced him not to oppose the
conservatives?
McCarthy's 1967 voting record
has been no more impressive on
the issues selected by the ADA
at the end of the 1967 sessions,
McCarthy had not only failed
to vote, but had also failed to
announce a position, on three.
Only Senator Hayden had a
poorer record. In addition, Sen
ator McCarthy voted against the
liberal position on two other
issues.
Senator McCarthy, with his
anti-war program, was the first
to challenge President John
son's nomination. In response
to this challenge liberals all over
the country flocked to McCar
thy's camp. But in doing so they
have tried to remake McCarthy

according to their own image.
The irony is that in so doing
they have appropriated Robert
Kennedy's fine voting record to
their own candidate. . . .

McCarthy Missed Vote
By Leadership Goof
Editor, The Daily:
The tactic of printing half a
story is not limited to the ex
tremists of the left or right as
can be seen by the Kennedy ail
in Monday's Daily. Taking just
one example: the ad says that
Senator McCarthy "did not both
er to show up to vote on clotun
while many of his colleagues
were desperately seeking votes.''
The full story was reporte I
by the March 5 New York Times.
Senator McCarthy was in hi*
Senate office that day and ha 1
asked the floor leadership to teli
him when the cloture vote was
to be taken so that he could be
there. The leadership failed to
notify the Senator and he ar
rived on the floor one minutr
after the vote was announced
Reason for his being awav
from the Senate floor: he was in
the midst of the New Hamp
shire primary campaign, the
election being a week away.
was single-handedly opposing
the policies of President John
son. Senator McCarthy was also
desperately seeking votes;
where was Senator Kennedy?
