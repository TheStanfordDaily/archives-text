## Comicsâ€”A Literary Form? 
### JORGE LOZOYA 
For those who still have
doubts about the legitimacy of
the comic strip as a literary
form, Grove Press has given a
final answer by publishing its
first comic book.
The publishing house has just
put on the market an edition
of Barbarella, the French comic
strip which Roger Vadim, one
of the most sophisticated direc
tors in France, used as a pat
tern for a recent movie.
In such a revolutionary mo
ment, Palo Alto might consid
er itself a representative of
the "avante-garde": the town
has one of the first comicbook
shops in the state of Califor
nia. In the garage of an ele
gant house located on 500)
North California Ave., two
young men are in business
buying and selling nothing
but comic books.
The Yancy Street Garage
might not be as fancy as the

shops in Town & Country Vil
lage but its owners have an en
cyclopedic knowledge of the his
tory of comic book publishers,
the main artists, and develop
ments of the comic book mar
ket during the past thirty years.
Patrick Price, a junior at Palo
Alto High School, and Jim Vade
boncouer, a senior at San Jose
State decided to open the shop
only a couple of months ago.
Price has been a collector of
comic books for a long time and
Vadeboncouer wanted some
"field practice" while majoring
in business management.
They seem to be doing extre
mely well, and claim to have
sold over five hundred dollars in
books during the seven weeks
they have been in business. The
shop is open only in the after
noons and all day on Saturday.
The national market is amaz
ingly large and the fluctuations
in the prices are not an easy
matter to understand and fol
low.
Most comic books have ani
original price of ten cents.
However, only seven years af
ter their publication, the first
Issues of "The Fantastic Four"
already cost $15.00 a copy. If
you wish to buy the first is
sue of "Superman," published
in 1938, you will have to pay
$250.00, provided you ! are
lucky enough to find some
body willing to sell. Daily
trade involves comic books
costing between 70 cents and
$2.00 a copy.
The Yancy Street Garage
keeps in close contact with col
lectors all over the country. In
this respect, more can be said of
the efficiency of comic fans than,

for instance, of most student
organizations. Over a hundred
magazines are published to in
form the collectors of the new
precious issues in the market.
These publications rank from
ditto pages to a lengthy monthly
magazine, The Rocket's Blast,
edited in New York. Moreover,
the Science Fiction societies have
official magazines which carry
long sections devoted to comic
books.
The fanzines (fan magazines)
also re-edit the earliest comic
strips or prepare special editions

of the masterpieces in the genre.
The magazine "AVitzend" is
an independent organ of the
artists Involved in the crea-4
tion of comic strips. In it,
artists publish works free
from the moral code of the
commercial comic books.
Price and Vadeboncouer, be
cause of their connections with
fans all over the country, guar
antee that they can track down
almost any comic book, if you
have the patience to wait. Price,
however, is "subject to the fluc
tuations of the market."
