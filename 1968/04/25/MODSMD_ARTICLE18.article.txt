# Two Minutes of Haight
## 'White Devils' Have Help 
### Tim Haight 
Although it may seem just too
melodramatic, he really did ap
pear in a puff of smoke. And he
even had a red suit and a long
pointed tail. He had come to
discuss race relations.
He came right to the point.
Although he actively encourag
ed people calling themselves
God, he thought the recent
charges by certain parties that
the collective white man was the
Devil were a bit much. He had
a reputation to maintain.
"I admit," he said, "that they
have a good case. You or your
forefathers — it's all the same
to them and to me, with my
sense of time — invaded their
continent, murdered one hun
dred million of them, and made
them slaves.
"Then you raped their worn
humiliated and lynched their
men, and set them free — fo
discover new chains. You in
vented social structures, and
jokes, and psychologlical hang
ups to keep them in the poorest
conditions possible, made them
fight your wars. I loved the way
you fought the racist Hitler with
segregated companies.
"You even stole their souls
while calling their things 'soul.'
You stole their names, their his
tory, their sense of self-respect.
You made them torture them
selves to try to look like you,
and even made them the loving
followers of a God and Savior
that you claimed has white skin
when you foisted him upon
them.
"Now they call you by my
name. And, from their point of
view, how could they do any
thing else? But you know you're
not the Devil, don't you?" At
this point in his discourse, His
Satanic Majesty became con
vulsed with laughter, until the
tears flowed from his eyes, fell,
and burned holes in my living
room rug. Finally, he continued.
You see, that's the best

part! Long: agr>, I tried Just cor
rupting: you all. Old Whatshis
name pulled the Noah bit. And
when I tried a limited action
in Sodom and Gommorrah —
well, you know the story there,
too.
"But what's kept Big Humble
up there doing twenty-light-year
handstands was that this time
I managed to get all you white
people to do my work while
believing you were doing His!
And you know, it was the same
old con, the tree of good and
evil again.
"You see, it's all in a prob
lem of measurement. Like the
main rule of the game is choice.
Well, once you've eaten of the
fruit, you've got to make an in
formed choice, right? And that
means data and measurement.
Hard evidence. Hard cash. Sal
vation through good works or
the indications of the Elect, it's
all the same — quantifying
grace.
"Even I was amazed how fast
you made the connection. Al
most as soon as you measured
salvation by price, you started
selling souls. Of course you
used Highand-Mighty's religion
to define them as savages and
barbarians, but each slave you
murdered or sold had a soul.
You old white Devil, you.
"So you made your money,
and your empires, and built up
your societies on the backs of
those one hundred million corp
ses and fifteen million slaves.
And you called it 'civilization'
and 'progress'. And you meant
it. In the same days you were
committing some of your worst
atrocities men were writing,
'Whatever is, is right.' It was
the will of God, you said. You
should have seen Old Ageless
then!
"He couldn't do a thing:, you
were so lily-white innocent!
How could he strike you- down
when you were Ignorant? So

he set up a string: of reformers
to work the thing: out. And
that made things even better
for me. Because it just meant
a new kick, a new twist.
"Like when you stole their
history, you were just judging
good and bad evidence. Obvious
ly those cultures who left the
written records got put in, and
the others not. And obviously
those famous figures and rich
social classes who left records
got top billing once civilizations
got started. You never knew
you were doing my work.
"And your institutions to mea
sure who got what. You never
realized how your institutions
forced people to the bottom, or
if you did you justified it out of
the Bible, like the Mormons or
the white Southerners. For most
of you, it was an academic exer
cise, for separated you from the
black and kept you innocent and
him hurting.
"Of course today, a lot of you
know all this. In fact, instead of
talking about Jackie Robinson
and your maids, you're now dis
cussing The Autobiography of
Malcolm X and the riot commis
sion report. And, in a way, that's
why I'm here.
"You see, the last years have
gone pretty much my way. So
now I offered Big Boy double
or nothing. I bet him, like that
Job time. I bet him that I could
come down here and tell all you
noble whites just what I've been
doing, and it wouldn't make any
difference. Your rhetoric might
change, but not your Devil's
work.
"I told him, 'OK, Your Gross
ness, I'll even go to those 'ideal
istic youths' your sanctimonious
servants are always sniveling
about. I'll get my pitch in every
college newspaper in White
America! The only way you
will ever see change for the
good is with evil means, and
then I win.'

You see, you probably won't
even print this. They'd think
you were loco. And if you do,
people will just be enter
tained. And even if they be
lieve it, the professors and
the party politicians will
tempt them away from mean
ingful work with their talk
of practicality and truth and
reason —all those narcotics.
"And even if some have the
will to act, they'll be stuck in
the Army, or in jail, or out of
America, or in school. All those
are good institutions for creat
ing racist innocence. And the
girls will go where the boys
are. You know, I even spotted
Great-and-Terrible the 4-F's!
"So none of you will act. Or
you'll do half-assed things that
your institutions let you do,
like being weekend revolution
aries or academic firebrands.
And change will be so slow that
soon the non-whites will be
driven to do my work!"
With that, the Adversary left,
laughing just like in the movies.
I know you won't believe this,
that the Devil has been running
white history for five hundred
years. And if you send the men
in the white coats around, I'll
tell them I made the whole
thing up. But I wish someone
would believe it. When Big Boy
bets double or nothing, there's
a lot riding on the outcome.
