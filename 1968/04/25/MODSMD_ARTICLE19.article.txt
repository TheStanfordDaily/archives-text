# Berkeley Official Says Arabs Have 'Inferiority Complexes'
## 
### JOHN ALCORN 
The Arabs are a people "strug
gling to catch up, saddled by
history, with an inferiority com
plex," according to Thomas C.
Sorensen, vice president for uni
versity relations at Berkeley.
Sorensen, speaking before
about eighty people on Quad
last night, referred to the Arabs
as a people who were "proud of
themselves and often disdainful,
suspicious and fearful of us, and
at the same time admiring."
Pointing out that Arabs and
Muslims are not necessarily
synonomous, Sorensen said that
the definition of an Arab "seems
to be anyone who calls himself
an Arab, lives in the Arab Near
East, and whose cultural orien
tation is like that of others who
call themselves Arabs."

He claimed, however, that
most Americans often have a
"confused and distorted" view
of the Arabs. He cited as the
primary reason the fact that the
mass media have been predom
inently "crisis or feature orient
ed" concerning the Arabs and
the Middle East.
The most important reason
for our distorted picture, he
said, is that "our view of the
Arabs is conditioned by our
sympathy for Israel and by
our deep sense of guilt" for
Hitler's crimes committed
against Jews during the Thir
ties and Forties.
Sorensen commented that one
vital aspect we must recognize
in attempting to understand the
Arabs is their view of them
selves.

Asserting that the Arabs are
no more a "monolithic people
than we are," Sorensen said that
they have a deep pride in their
history, but that this is tempered
by a deep sense of shame "that
the last several centuries have
given them very little to be
proud of," especially in compari
son with the dramatic advances
of the West.
One way the Arabs try to con
quer their "inferiority complex,"
he emphasized, is by claiming
that they have been subjugated
by foreign imperialism and a
betrayal by the West in estab
lishing the Israeli State.
Sorensen declared that
Arabs often resent US. eco
nomic assistance and Ameri
can attempts to reduce Soviet
influence in the Middle East.
This is because they common
ly think out motivation for
such actions is "protecting
U.S. oil and strategic inter
ests in the area," instead of
genuine "altruistic" motives.
The Berkeley administrator
further stated that the Arabs
believed false rumors claiming
American military assistance to
Israel during last year's June
War because their hurt pride
and their "almost unlimited ca
pacity for self delusion" pro
hibited them from believing
that Israel could have won the
war alone.
Sorensen said this trait stunts
Arab progress and hinders Unit
ed States-Arab relations. But he
reminded his audience that 'self
delusion is not found exclus
ively among the Arabs, as wit
nessed by reepated American
statements over the last five
years that victory in Vietnam
is just around the corner."
Turning to Soviet-Arab re
lations, Sorensen said that
"one of the main attractions
to Arabs of the Soviet Union
is the myth that Russia ad
vanced in two generations
from a backward peasant
state to the second most in
dustrialized nation in the
world."
This attraction to the Soviet
Union, a fierce pride and a para
doxically deep sense of shame,
and a simultaneous respect for
and jealousy of the United
States are all factors we must
take into account in determin
ing Arab-American policy, and,
he added, in trying to see the
Arabs as they see themselves.

Arabs as they see themselves.
The Arabs are a people "strug
gling to catch up, saddled by
history, with an inferiority com
plex," according to Thomas C.
Sorensen, vice president for uni
versity relations at Berkeley.
Sorensen, speaking before
about eighty people on Quad
last night, referred to the Arabs
as a people who were "proud of
themselves and often disdainful,
suspicious and fearful of us, and
at the same time admiring."
Pointing out that Arabs and
Muslims are not necessarily
synonomous, Sorensen said that
the definition of an Arab "seems
to be anyone who calls himself
an Arab, lives in the Arab Near
East, and whose cultural orien
tation is like that of others who
call themselves Arabs."

He claimed, however, that
most Americans often have a
"confused and distorted" view
of the Arabs. He cited as the
primary reason the fact that the
mass media have been predom
inently "crisis or feature orient
ed" concerning the Arabs and
the Middle East.
The most important reason
for our distorted picture, he
said, is that "our view of the
Arabs is conditioned by our
sympathy for Israel and by
our deep sense of guilt" for
Hitler's crimes committed
against Jews during the Thir
ties and Forties.
Sorensen commented that one
vital aspect we must recognize
in attempting to understand the
Arabs is their view of them
selves.

Asserting that the Arabs are
no more a "monolithic people
than we are," Sorensen said that
they have a deep pride in their
history, but that this is tempered
by a deep sense of shame "that
the last several centuries have
given them very little to be
proud of," especially in compari
son with the dramatic advances
of the West.
One way the Arabs try to con
quer their "inferiority complex,"
he emphasized, is by claiming
that they have been subjugated
by foreign imperialism and a
betrayal by the West in estab
lishing the Israeli State.
Sorensen declared that
Arabs often resent US. eco
nomic assistance and Ameri
can attempts to reduce Soviet
influence in the Middle East.
This is because they common
ly think out motivation for
such actions is "protecting
U.S. oil and strategic inter
ests in the area," instead of
genuine "altruistic" motives.
The Berkeley administrator
further stated that the Arabs
believed false rumors claiming
American military assistance to
Israel during last year's June
War because their hurt pride
and their "almost unlimited ca
pacity for self delusion" pro
hibited them from believing
that Israel could have won the
war alone.
Sorensen said this trait stunts
Arab progress and hinders Unit
ed States-Arab relations. But he
reminded his audience that 'self
delusion is not found exclus
ively among the Arabs, as wit
nessed by reepated American
statements over the last five
years that victory in Vietnam
is just around the corner."
Turning to Soviet-Arab re
lations, Sorensen said that
"one of the main attractions
to Arabs of the Soviet Union
is the myth that Russia ad
vanced in two generations
from a backward peasant
state to the second most in
dustrialized nation in the
world."
This attraction to the Soviet
Union, a fierce pride and a para
doxically deep sense of shame,
and a simultaneous respect for
and jealousy of the United
States are all factors we must
take into account in determin
ing Arab-American policy, and,
he added, in trying to see the
Arabs as they see themselves.
