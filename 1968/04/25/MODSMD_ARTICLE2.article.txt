# Personnel Office Seeks Work For Minority Group Students
## 
### JOHN ALCORN 
Three black students are work
ing with Mike Ravizza of the
University's Personnel Office in
an effort to give minority group
youths summer jobs at Stan
ford.
"Because of everything that's
happened in the last two weeks,"
commented Ravizza, "so many
people are asking 'What can I
do?' about the racial situation
that exists at Stanford. Well,
here is something they can do
— they can participate in a
program that's already doing
something to change things."
The project is called the
"Youth Opportunity Program."
Working with Ravizza have been
Art Wilson, Johnie Scott and
Joyce King.
"The whole key," emphasizes
Ravizza, "is jobs. We have the
staff, we have the counselors,
and we have many young peo
ple from east of the Bayshore
who possess an extremely varied
collection of talent. But we can't

do anything unless wo get the
jobs."
Getting the jobs has proved
to be no minor task. Ravizza
has made several appeals to
Stanford deans, department
heads and principal Investiga
tors — people responsible for
large campus-wide programs
— but reports little success
so far.
As early as last November
he conducted a search through
out the University to find out
just how many summer jobs
exist. The only information he
could come up with is that Stan
ford summer jobs usually go to
either Stanford students, or sons
and daughters of people who
work here, usually senior admin
istration and faculty.
Because Ravizza believed that
"no group should be excluded
from summer jobs at Stanford
— especially those who need the
jobs the most," he was able to
obtain University funds to help
support the Youth Opportunity
Program.
One of the program's major
efforts was to find Stanford
jobs that could be offered at
last week's Ravenswood High
School Summer Job Fair. But
he lined up only 41 jobs to of
fer the more than 160 students
who had indicated a strong de
sire to work at Stanford this
summer.
"Are there no more than 41
jobs at Stanford that we can
offer?" asks Ravizza. "We had
to turn away three applicanis
for every one job. I had hoped
to get at the very least 75 job
offers."
Ravizza said he realized tha
some Stanford department
don't have the resources to hire
a student for the summer, but
he believes a much greater ef
fort should be made.
He mentioned that a few Stan
ford groups have shown inter
est and contributed to some ex
tent already.
Some of these include the
Medical School, the Controllers
Office, the Food Service, the
General Secretary's Office, the
Food Research Institute, Stan
ford Electronics Laboratory,
Navy ROTC, University resi
dences, fraternities and the Phy
sics Department.
Johnie Scott points out that
Negroes have always had the

potential required to fill both
summer and permanent jobs at
Stanford.
"But we just need the chance,"
he added.
Art Wilson said that there
are three ways in which Negroes
can try to obtain the things they
want — by violence and riots;
by sitting at negotiation tables
and presenting demands; or by
employment and bi-cultural pro
grams. He prefers the third way.
An often overlooked aspect of
minority employment at Stan
ford, but often stressed by both
Ravizza and Associate Provost
Robert Rosenzweig, concerns
jobs for other minority groups,
the largest of which is Mexican-
American.
Ravizza said that he is pres
ently working with Marcie Free
len, the wife of Bob Freelen who
works in the General Secretary's
Office. Mrs. Freelen is a Moun
tain View grade school teacher
who, according to Ravizza, "op
erates her own home placement
service" for Mexican-Americans.
Ravizza said "a definite propor
tion of the jobs" obtained by
the Youth Opportunity Pro
gram will be designated for
this group.
