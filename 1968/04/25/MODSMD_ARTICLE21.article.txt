# Play Review
## 'Gynt' Imaginative 
### ROGER OLIVER 
While Henrik Ibsen is most
often associated with the box
set and the realistic well-made
play, his early work, Peer Gynt,
is a panoramic view of life, en
compassing two continents and
fifty years.
In the work, now being pre
sented by the drama department
of San Francisco State College,
the action moves from the Nor
wegian mountains to the Sa
hara desert.
The explanation for this sce
nic sweep is that Ibsen did not
write the play for the stage. He
thus changes locale frequently
and introduces marked varia
tions in style. Michael Meyer,
whose translation is being used
in this production, considers it
Ibsen's most difficult play to
translate.
"Peer Gynt" traces the ad
ventures of its hero from the
youth who places his mother
on the millhouse roof and
steals a bride on her wedding
day, to the old man who
searches for the elusive truth
about himself. Although his
motto is "I live for myself, and
myself alone," Peer comes to
realize that he has allowed
pride, greed and ambition to
keep him from being himself.
Because of the broad scope of
the play, Gynt poses many
problems to the producer. Ib
sen shifts from lyricism to satire,
from the real to the supernatu
ral. The San Francisco State
production makes many of these
transitions smoothly and thus
presents an evening of imagina
tive and varied theatre. Much of
the complexity and richness of
the play is translated to the
stage.
Tom Tyrrell's direction gives
the production the pacing im
perative to the play's success.

The staging is especially effec
tive in the troll and madhouse
scenes. The individualization of
movement given to both the
trolls and the asylum inmates
is most imaginative, with the
latter scene reminiscent of Peter
Brook's production of Marat-
Sade.
The troll sequence not only
adds the supernatural dimension
of Peer's world, but also graph
ically depicts the side of Peer
which is dramatized in Act IV.
The imaginative costumes sup
plement the sinister quality of
the action.
While much of the produc
tion Is visually exciting:, Mr.
Harris' multi-leveled set caus
es difficulties In entrances and
exits, especially from the high
est platform.

The use of projections for
horses is also unsuccessful. They
seem extraneous to the rest of
the production and are not inte
grated with the action occurr
ing on stage.
Much of the success of the
production is due to John O'Con
nell, who plays Peer Gynt. While
his gestures as the young Peer
sometimes become monotonous,
he brings strength and exuber
ance to the part. His transitions
to the middle-aged and elder
Peer are skillfully executed, al
though his imitations of W. C.
Fields as the middle Peer are
jarring with the rest of his por
trayal.
The production will continue
today through Saturday April
27 at 8 p.m. in the San Francisco
State Main Theatre.
