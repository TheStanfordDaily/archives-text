# Prof Returns From 3 Weeks In Cuba
## 
### 
There is little or no hope for
rapprochement with Cuba un
less the United States has a rad
ical change in foreign policy
Professor Richard Fagen, asso
ciate professor of the Institute
for Political Studies, believes.
Fagen, who has just returned
from three weeks in Cuba as
special correspondent for a na
tional news magazine, found
that there were strong signs of
a new communist axis between
Castro, Ho Chi Minh and Kim
II Sung of North Korea.
Internationally, Cuba fears ex
ploitation by any big nation,
communist or capitalist, he said.

"They equate themselves with
'the wretched of the earth,' so
they feel a natural alliance with
all small emerging nations which
are trying to establish a strong
agricultural economy."
Fagen was in Cuba during the
annual "jornada de Giron" —
the exodus of great numbers
of school and office workers to
the countryside to work at hard
agricultural labor.
Premier Castro himself spends
perhaps two-thirds of his time
visiting cities and towns around
the Island, talking to office work
ers and farmhands alike, furth
ering the cause of the revolu
tion, and occasionally delivering
his customary five-hour lectures
over national television.
The idea behind the "jornada
de Giron," the "journey of Gi
ron" after the Cuban victory
over the invaders at the Bay of
Pigs, is to put hands in the field
and m&ke workers in sedentary
occupations realize the meaning
of dirty hands, aching muscles
and hard physical labor on be
half of the revolution, Fagen
said.
"Though the Cubans would
deny it for political reasons,"
Fagen says,"the atmos
phere in the countryside is very
similar to the Israelis and the
young people who moved into
the 'kibbutzim' on behalf of their
own nation's strength and
growth."
Fagen found the Cuban reac
tion to Martin Luther King's as
sassination strong. They felt
the tragedy marked "the death
knell of the nonviolent move
ment in the U.S."
