Applications are now available
for Stanford's exchange pro
gram with Keio University in
Japan.
The applications can be ob
tained at the upstairs office of
the International Center until
May 10. The one-year exchange
is sponsored by the Institute of
International Relations.
A private university, Keio has
a reputation and status in Japan
comparable to Stanford's in this

country. Completely student or
ganized, operated, and maintain
ed, the exchange program has
been in existence in 1956.
The program is entirely aca
demic and designed for students
interested in pursuing their
study of the Japanese language,
culture and history.
The student receives full finan
cial support upon his arrival in
Keio. Tuition is paid for and a
host family is provided. A stip
end is also granted for miscel
laneous expenses. The only ex
pense the student must cover
himself is transportation to and
from Japan.
Students will leave Stanford
for Keio after winter quarter of
next year and will return one
year later. The student must
take two quarters or 10 units
of Japanese language before his
spring departure. No other re
quirements are necessary.
