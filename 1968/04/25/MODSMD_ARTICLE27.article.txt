# Stanford Trims Navy For 2nd Kennedy Cup
## 
### BRUCE HOWARD 
The defending champion Stan
ford team staged a dramatic
come-from-behind win in the
final race of the Kennedy Cup
Regatta to overtake Navy and
win the series Sunday.
Stanford skipper Tom Mc-
Carthy guided his team to a 6-2-
2-5-1 record in the five races,
good for 39 points. Navy finish
ed second with 38 points, with
Yale a distant third at 34 points.
The races, sailed at the U.S.
Naval Academy In the Navy's
44-foot Luders yawls, were
close and evenly matched all
the way through. Going Into
the final day's competition,
Navy held a slight one-polnt
advantage over the Wester
ners, 24 points to 23, with Yale
and Ohio State tied for third
at 22 points. Padding Its lead
to two points by placing ahead
of Stanford In the fourth race,
Navy set the stage for Stan
ford's winning comback In the
last race.
Hampered throughout the se
ries by the Chesapeake's fluky
winds and strong currents, Stan
ford had a poor start in the fifth
race. Behind the other boats un
der mill pond conditions, the
Stanford boat appeared to be in
bad shape.
But this turned out to be the
best position the Stanford crew
could have been in, as the cur

rent forced them to change di
rection to avoid hitting the start
ing marker. This, and the gamble
that by breaking away from the
fleet they could find more fa
vorable conditions, did indeed
enable them to reach an area
of less current, and as the breeze
freshened, to pick up substantial
ground on the boats that stayed
on their original course.
Navy, wanting to change di
rection to follow the Stanford
boat, was boxed In by sur
rounding boats and could not
move free. This proved deci
sive, as Stanford was able
to put two boats between
themselves and Navy at the
finish to win the series by one
point.
Headed by sophomore skipper
McCarthy, the Stanford Ken
nedy Cup team also included
Kim Desenberg, Jurgen Gram
ckow, Kevin Fitzpatrick, Steve
Richard, Larry Rosensweig,
John London, and Bruce
Howard.
Other teams in the Regatta
were Yale (34 points), Prince
ton (29), Southern California
(29), Florida State (27), Ohio
State (25), Tufts (25), and Geo
rgetown (22). The nine teams
are drawn from regional districts
of the Intercollegiate Yacht Rac
ing Association to achieve na
tionwide representation.
Stanford's repeat victory

marks the first time any t<*am
has won the Cup twice. Named
in honor of the late President
John F. Kennedy, the Cup
was first won, appropriately,
by Harvard. Succeeding win
ners were Navy in 1966 and
Stanford in 1967.
The only nation-wide intercol
legiate "big boat" competition,
the Kennedy Cup has become
one of the two or three most
important collegiate regattas.
Entering teams are nominated
by their districts of the ICYRA,
and competition for nominations
is so rough that few teams man
age to be selected more than
twice in a row. Harvard, with
a second place in last year's se
ries, was not invited back this
year due to the loss of their skip
per and the improvement of
Yale and other teams in their
district. Besides Navy, only Stan
ford and Southern California
have competed more than two
times.
