The Stanford Police Depart
ment no longer issues tickets
for moving traffic violations.
Charles Prelsnick, Santa Clara
County Sheriff, "suggested" to
the Stanford police about six
months ago that only peace
officers should have the author
ity to issue traffic tickets.
University policemen are leg
ally private citizens rather than
peace officers.
The policy reversal has caused
the University to contract with
the county for 88 man-hours of
traffic patrol per month. The
patrol costs Stanford $11.70 an
hour.
The county will vary its pa
trolling hours from day to day.
In the past, the Stanford
police have provided about 250

man-hours of traffic patrol per
month, mainly between the
hours of 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. In
addition, campus policemen on
other assignments were author
ized to issue traffic tickets.
Stanford police retain author
ity held by all citizens; they may
still arrest any traffic violator
they see and bring him to the
sheriff's office, or they can re
port the violator to a court of
law.
According to Bell, the Stan
ford police will take such action
only in cases of flagrant viola
tion.
The new policy applies to bi
cyclists as well, but does not
affect the issuing of parking
tickets.
