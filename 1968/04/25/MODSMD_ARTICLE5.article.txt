# Summer Project To Promote Change In White Communities
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
The Summer Education Pro,-
ject, a program which hopes to
help participants "master the
techniques for working for
changes within the communities
we live," has been organized by
a group of Stanford students.
Registration for a series of
four lecture and discussion ses
sions and a week-end conference
began yesterday in front of the
post office and will continue
until Wednesday.
A fee of $2 is being charged
to cover the cost of materials
used in the program.
The lecture and discussion
sessions, to be held for two
hours on consecutive Thurs
day evenings, May 2, 9, 16Â«
and 23, will provide back
ground information of the his
tory of white racism, myths
about race, white response to
black power, and institutional
racism.
The week-end conference set
for May 11-12 will explore white
attitudes to race relations. Work
in the Palo Alto area that Sun
day will give participants "a
sense of how difficult it's going
to be to uncover and deal with
prejudicies," said one of the or
ganizers of the Project.
Randy Fields, a senior politi
cal science major and Project
coordinator, said that the pro
gram "will not be just academ
ic, but will be giving concerned
students the opportunity to
translate feeling into action."
The Project was first organiz
ed approximately three weeks
ago to put into action current
student concern with developing
new understanding in the white
community.
Participants will be orga

nlzed along group lines based
on their home communities so
that Project coordinators canj
get some positive feed back
at the end of the summer said
Fields.
In addition to the work of
Project members, the Students
Against White Racism and the
Community Information Proj
ect, a group of adults from the
mid-peninsula area, will also be
participating in planning the
summer action plans.
Over 20 members of the Com
munity Information Project
plan to participate in the lecture
and discussion sessions. Fields
hopes to have over 200 Stanford
students participate in the train
ing for work this summer.
Project coordinators see four

possible areas of action at this
time, but are urging students to
contribute additional ideas.
One possibility would be for
students to approach local
groups with the issue of insti
tionalized racism through lec
tures and discussions. In the
mid - peninsula area the Com
munity Information Project
could provide contracts for stu
dents.
Students could also "go back
to their home towns and train
friends in sensitivity and role
playing techniques," suggested
Fields.
Thirdly, an attitudinal sur
vey for the Palo Alto area on
reaction to a Negro family mov
ing into the neighborhood has
been suggested.

A final suggestion is that the
Project take the form of th-~>
Vietnam Summer program. In
this case participants could
serve as resource people in their
home communities.
Ray Fleming, a black his
tory instructor at C'ubberley
High school, will conduct the
first Thursday evening discus
sion on the "Origins of Racism
in America." Other speakers
have not been definitely estab
lished at this time.
The program's training, ac
cording to Project member Deb
orah Hamermesh, will provide
background information and
recommended reading materials,
but will stress the techniques
needed to promote active change
in the white community.
