## Assembly Votes To Ease State Pot Possession Law 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) — The
Assembly voted Wednesday to
ease the penalty for marijuana
possession, after hearing that
judges and prosecutors evade
the current law because it is too
harsh on young people.
At the same time, the lower
house approved a toughening of
penalties for possession of dan
gerous drugs such as LSD.
Both provisions were in the
same bill, sent to the Senate on
a 50-25 vote that found 18 Re
publicans and 32 Democrats in
favor, with 19 Republicans and
6 Democrats against. Five mem
bers were absent or not vot
ing.
The bill's author, Republican
Assemblyman W. Craig Biddle
of Riverside, said he is uncer
tain whether the measure can
pass the Senate. Gov. Reagan
was asked about the bill Tues
day and said:
"It is true that there is an
inelasticity in the penalty that
has now a tendency to let some
violators off because the penalty
is so severe. That's what it is
seeking to correct. I'm sympa
thetic to that approach ..."
• Anti-Gun Bill OK'd
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Senate Judiciary Committee
voted Wednesday to cement into
a broad anti-crime bill a section
providing tougher federal con
trols over firearms sales.
But, contrary to President
Johnson's recommendations, the
new restrictions would not pro
hibit interstate mail order sales
of rifles and shotguns to indi
viduals.
However, they would ban such
sales of other firearms, includ
ing concealable weapons like
pistols and revolvers.
There also would be an out
right ban on sales to persons un
der 21 years of age.
The bill would make it unlaw
ful for any person other than a
licensed dealer to receive in his
state of residence any firearm
other than a rifle or shotgun
obtained outside his state.

preliminary peace talks, the
State Department disclosed

nication from Washington to Ha

• Poor Red Turnout

paratory unity conference of
Communist parties opened

trench Soviet dominance over
the world's Marxist parties.

China and Albania, critics of the
Soviet Union from the far left,

PHILADELPHIA ( A P ) —
Backers of Sen. Eugene J. Mc-
Carthy cheered his showing
Wednesday in Pennsylvania's
pritjiary, but he can count on

only a handful of the .state's 130
Democratic convention votes.
McCarthy's name was the
only one on Tuesday's primary
ballot, and he far outdistanced
write-in candidates.
"As a result of the preferen
tial primary, it's fairly obvious
he is a great favorite and a
great vote getter," said Michael
H. Malin, chairman of the Penn
sylvania McCarthy for Presi
dent organization.
McCarthy had no immediate
comment.
In the voting, McCarthy's to
tals were 7-1 over the write-in
votes for Sen. Robert F. Ken
nedy and 10-1 over Vice Presi
dent Hubert Humphrey.
