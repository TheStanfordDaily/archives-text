## Assembly Votes To Ease State Pot Possession Law 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) — The
Assembly voted Wednesday to
ease the penalty for marijuana
possession, after hearing that
judges and prosecutors evade
the current law because it is too
harsh on young people.
At the same time, the lower
house approved a toughening of
penalties for possession of dan
gerous drugs such as LSD.
Both provisions were in the
same bill, sent to the Senate on
a 50-25 vote that found 18 Re
publicans and 32 Democrats in
favor, with 19 Republicans and
6 Democrats against. Five mem
bers were absent or not vot
ing.
The bill's author, Republican
Assemblyman W. Craig Biddle
of Riverside, said he is uncer
tain whether the measure can
pass the Senate. Gov. Reagan
was asked about the bill Tues
day and said:
"It is true that there is an
inelasticity in the penalty that
has now a tendency to let some
violators off because the penalty
is so severe. That's what it is
seeking to correct. I'm sympa
thetic to that approach ..."
• Anti-Gun Bill OK'd
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Senate Judiciary Committee
voted Wednesday to cement into
a broad anti-crime bill a section
providing tougher federal con
trols over firearms sales.
But, contrary to President
Johnson's recommendations, the
new restrictions would not pro
hibit interstate mail order sales
of rifles and shotguns to indi
viduals.
However, they would ban such
sales of other firearms, includ
ing concealable weapons like
pistols and revolvers.
There also would be an out
right ban on sales to persons un
der 21 years of age.
The bill would make it unlaw
ful for any person other than a
licensed dealer to receive in his
state of residence any firearm
other than a rifle or shotgun
obtained outside his state.
• Viet Peace
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
United States has sent another
message to North Vietnam In

the still-unsuccessful effort to
achieve agreement on a site for
preliminary peace talks, the
State Department disclosed
Wednesday.
It was understood that the
new U.S. message went to Ha
noi Monday and amounted to a
diplomatic prod to the Reds to
respond to earlier U.S. offers of
any of its list of 15 Asian and
European capitals as a meeting
place.
It was the fifth such commu
nication from Washington to Ha
noi announced since the oppos
ing sides publicly declared three
weeks ago their willingness to
enter into direct talks.
• Poor Red Turnout
BUDAPEST (AP) — A pre
paratory unity conference of
Communist parties opened
Wednesday in a sealed-off hotel
with barely half the 88 delega
tions invited showing up. Many
of the absentees said the meet
ing's only purpose was to en
trench Soviet dominance over
the world's Marxist parties.
The stay at homes—49 by un
official count—included Red
China and Albania, critics of the
Soviet Union from the far left,
and Yugoslavia and Romania,
both to the right of Moscow.
Cuba was reported missing as
were North Vietnam, Worth Ko
rea and other Asian parties.
• 33 IS. Viets Killed
SAIGON (AP) — U.S. infan
trymen killed 33 North Viet
namese soldiers in one of a se
ries of scattered, sharp engage
ments in the countryside 20 to 40
miles from Saigon, the U.S.
Command reported Thursday.
The four-hour battle 30 miles
northeast of the capital was
Wednesday's heaviest reported
ground action. Members of the
U.S. 199 th Light Infantry Bri
gade, supported by tactical air
strikes and helicopter gunships,
listed their losses as eight
killed, 33 wounded.
• Gene Wins In Pa.
PHILADELPHIA ( A P ) —
Backers of Sen. Eugene J. Mc-
Carthy cheered his showing
Wednesday in Pennsylvania's
pritjiary, but he can count on

only a handful of the .state's 130
Democratic convention votes.
McCarthy's name was the
only one on Tuesday's primary
ballot, and he far outdistanced
write-in candidates.
"As a result of the preferen
tial primary, it's fairly obvious
he is a great favorite and a
great vote getter," said Michael
H. Malin, chairman of the Penn
sylvania McCarthy for Presi
dent organization.
McCarthy had no immediate
comment.
In the voting, McCarthy's to
tals were 7-1 over the write-in
votes for Sen. Robert F. Ken
nedy and 10-1 over Vice Presi
dent Hubert Humphrey.
• Big Blast Protested
LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP)
The mightiest nuclear blast to
be fired in the United States is
set for Friday, and the federal
government is feeling shock
waves in advance.
Protests again possible dan
ger or damage have come from
citizens, scientists, labor lead-
ers, peace groups and from the
organization of Nevada's big
gest spender, billionaire How
ard Hughes.
The test of a hydrogen device
will pack the wallop of one mil
lion tons of TNT or more and is
expected to be felt, earthquake
style, for 250 miles or more.
A test last January rated at a
little less than a million tons
rocked buildings in San Fran
cisco and Salt Lake City and
residents of the Northern Cali
fornia coastal town of Eureka,
700 miles distance, said they
felt it.

• Watchdog May Die
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
authority of the Renegotiation
Board as the only independent
government watchdog over de
fense and space contract profits
will expire in 67 days unless it
is renewed by Congress. And
the House Committee charged
with producing a bill to con
tinue the board has indefinitely
suspended work on it.
A spokesman for the House
Ways and Means Committee
said Wednesday that "prelimi
nary work on a bill has been
completed but the proceedings
have been laid aside while the
committee works on the Presi
dent's request for an income tax
surcharge."
No date has been set for re
sumption of work on the Rene
gotiation Board, the spokesman
said.
• ISetv Black Market
NEW YORK (AP) — Silently,
steadilv a black market in im
ported domestics is flourishing
across the United States, an un
wanted offspring of the revised
Immigration Act.
Government sources say the
illegal human traffic is the work
of a handful of immigration law
yers and employment agents
who spotted a chance to make
money by circumventing some
provisions of the act.
Of an estimated 25,000 alien
domestics now entering the na
tion each year, industry sources
estimate that over half are ad
mitted illegally with fraudulent
papers provided—at a price—
to make them immediately a
vailable to work as domestics.
An estimated 5.5 million Amer
ican homes seek household help,
one source said, and Americans
fill onlv about one-quarter of
the demand.
• Dollar Crisis Cited
NEW YORK (AP) — Banker
David Rockefeller said Wednes
day the dollar crisis has been
shoved far too low on the scale
of national priorities, weakening
the country's ability to deal ef
fectively with problems consid
ered more urgent.
He did not say explicitly what
the higher priorities were but h->
made it plain he believed failure
to deal with the skidding reputa
tion of the dollar was eroding
the nation's role as world lead
er.
"Confidence in the dollar is
virtually synonymous with con
fidence in the ability of the Unit
ed States to fulfill its role of
leadership," he said.
• U.K. Race Strife
LONDON (AP) — Several
hundred more British workers
marched on Parliament Wednes
day to demand tighter nonwhite
immigration controls, but most
of their mates stayed on the
job—often with colored men be
side them.
There were signs that the ten
sions aroused by Conservative

Enoch Powell's speech Saturday
were easing.
Powell, in an outburst which
cost him his place in the opposi
tion shadow cabinet, said Brit
ain should pay immigrants to
leave the country. He claimed
he was speaking for hundreds of
thousands of Englishmen.
• Resistance Rallies
OAKLAND (AP) — Four
draftees drew cheers from a
small group of demonstrators
Wednesday when they refused
to be inducted at the Oakland
Army Induction Center.
Except for this, the second
day of an antidraft protest by
50 members of a group known
as The Resistance passed virtu
ally without incident.
The small, orderly demon
stration was in contrast to the
one staged Tuesday by a Stop
the Draft Week Committee.
About 2,000 persons, including
The Resistance, took part and
18 were arrested for scuffling
with some of 300 policemen.
• Mideast Fighting
TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) —
Gun duels between Israelis and
Jordanians broke out Wednes
day across the River Jordan in
the Beisan Valley south of the
Sea of Galilee.
The first exchanges of ma
chine-gun fire went on for 90
minutes, by most accounts. Lat
er, a Jordanian army spokes
man said Israeli tanks opened
fire on Jordanian farmers and
sporadic machine-gun battles
spread to the south Jordan Val
ley.
Each side accused the other
of opening fire. An Israeli Army
spokesman said the Jordanians
opened up with machine guns
near Yardena, in the north of
Beisan Valley.
Jordan said the Israelis began
firing machine guns from the
Beit Yousef settlement in the
northern part of the valley.
• Stocks Edge Up
NEW YORK (AP) — An uncer
tain stock market groped its
way to a slightly higher level
Wednesday, apparently lacking
incentive to make a sharp move
in either direction. Trading was
active.
Volume was 14.81 million
shares, compared with 14.1 mil
lion Tuesday. An assortment of
large blocks helped boost turn
over, even though the pace of
trading was not very fast by
current standards.
The continued absence of any
agreement on the first step in
Vietnam peace talks—selection
of a site for them—put the
brakes on the market and led
to cross currents.

• Anti-Gun Bill OK'd
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Senate Judiciary Committee
voted Wednesday to cement into
a broad anti-crime bill a section
providing tougher federal con
trols over firearms sales.
But, contrary to President
Johnson's recommendations, the
new restrictions would not pro
hibit interstate mail order sales
of rifles and shotguns to indi
viduals.
However, they would ban such
sales of other firearms, includ
ing concealable weapons like
pistols and revolvers.
There also would be an out
right ban on sales to persons un
der 21 years of age.
The bill would make it unlaw
ful for any person other than a
licensed dealer to receive in his
state of residence any firearm
other than a rifle or shotgun
obtained outside his state.
• Viet Peace
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
United States has sent another
message to North Vietnam In

the still-unsuccessful effort to
achieve agreement on a site for
preliminary peace talks, the
State Department disclosed
Wednesday.
It was understood that the
new U.S. message went to Ha
noi Monday and amounted to a
diplomatic prod to the Reds to
respond to earlier U.S. offers of
any of its list of 15 Asian and
European capitals as a meeting
place.
It was the fifth such commu

• Poor Red Turnout
BUDAPEST (AP) — A pre

Wednesday in a sealed-off hotel
with barely half the 88 delega

trench Soviet dominance over
the world's Marxist parties.
The stay at homes—49 by un

Cuba was reported missing as

• Big Blast Protested
LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP)
The mightiest nuclear blast to

Protests again possible dan

citizens, scientists, labor lead-

organization of Nevada's big

ard Hughes.
The test of a hydrogen device
will pack the wallop of one mil

style, for 250 miles or more.
A test last January rated at a

700 miles distance, said they
felt it.

• ISetv Black Market
NEW YORK (AP) — Silently,
steadilv a black market in im

across the United States, an un

Immigration Act.
Government sources say the
illegal human traffic is the work
of a handful of immigration law

who spotted a chance to make
money by circumventing some
provisions of the act.
Of an estimated 25,000 alien
domestics now entering the na

estimate that over half are ad
mitted illegally with fraudulent
papers provided—at a price—
to make them immediately a

An estimated 5.5 million Amer

one source said, and Americans

NEW YORK (AP) — Banker

He did not say explicitly what
the higher priorities were but h->

"Confidence in the dollar is

LONDON (AP) — Several

There were signs that the ten

OAKLAND (AP) — Four

Wednesday when they refused

Except for this, the second

50 members of a group known
as The Resistance passed virtu

The small, orderly demon

About 2,000 persons, including
The Resistance, took part and
18 were arrested for scuffling

• Mideast Fighting
TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) —
Gun duels between Israelis and
Jordanians broke out Wednes
day across the River Jordan in
the Beisan Valley south of the
Sea of Galilee.
The first exchanges of ma

minutes, by most accounts. Lat
er, a Jordanian army spokes
man said Israeli tanks opened
fire on Jordanian farmers and
sporadic machine-gun battles
spread to the south Jordan Val
ley.
Each side accused the other
of opening fire. An Israeli Army
spokesman said the Jordanians
opened up with machine guns
near Yardena, in the north of
Beisan Valley.
Jordan said the Israelis began
firing machine guns from the
Beit Yousef settlement in the
northern part of the valley.

• Anti-Gun Bill OK'd
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Senate Judiciary Committee
voted Wednesday to cement into
a broad anti-crime bill a section
providing tougher federal con
trols over firearms sales.
But, contrary to President
Johnson's recommendations, the
new restrictions would not pro
hibit interstate mail order sales
of rifles and shotguns to indi
viduals.
However, they would ban such
sales of other firearms, includ
ing concealable weapons like
pistols and revolvers.
There also would be an out
right ban on sales to persons un
der 21 years of age.
The bill would make it unlaw
ful for any person other than a
licensed dealer to receive in his
state of residence any firearm
other than a rifle or shotgun
obtained outside his state.
• Viet Peace
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
United States has sent another
message to North Vietnam In

the still-unsuccessful effort to
achieve agreement on a site for
preliminary peace talks, the
State Department disclosed
Wednesday.
It was understood that the
new U.S. message went to Ha
noi Monday and amounted to a
diplomatic prod to the Reds to
respond to earlier U.S. offers of
any of its list of 15 Asian and
European capitals as a meeting
place.
It was the fifth such commu

weeks ago their willingness to
enter into direct talks.
• Poor Red Turnout
BUDAPEST (AP) — A pre

Communist parties opened
Wednesday in a sealed-off hotel
with barely half the 88 delega

of the absentees said the meet

trench Soviet dominance over
the world's Marxist parties.
The stay at homes—49 by un

both to the right of Moscow.
Cuba was reported missing as

Backers of Sen. Eugene J. Mc-

"As a result of the preferen

McCarthy had no immediate

• Big Blast Protested
LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP)
The mightiest nuclear blast to
be fired in the United States is
set for Friday, and the federal

waves in advance.
Protests again possible dan

citizens, scientists, labor lead-

organization of Nevada's big

ard Hughes.
The test of a hydrogen device
will pack the wallop of one mil

expected to be felt, earthquake
style, for 250 miles or more.
A test last January rated at a

700 miles distance, said they
felt it.

• ISetv Black Market
NEW YORK (AP) — Silently,
steadilv a black market in im

across the United States, an un

Immigration Act.
Government sources say the
illegal human traffic is the work
of a handful of immigration law

who spotted a chance to make
money by circumventing some
provisions of the act.
Of an estimated 25,000 alien
domestics now entering the na

estimate that over half are ad
mitted illegally with fraudulent
papers provided—at a price—
to make them immediately a
vailable to work as domestics.
An estimated 5.5 million Amer

one source said, and Americans

NEW YORK (AP) — Banker

He did not say explicitly what
the higher priorities were but h->
made it plain he believed failure

"Confidence in the dollar is

LONDON (AP) — Several

There were signs that the ten

OAKLAND (AP) — Four

Wednesday when they refused

Except for this, the second

50 members of a group known
as The Resistance passed virtu

The small, orderly demon

About 2,000 persons, including
The Resistance, took part and
18 were arrested for scuffling

• Mideast Fighting
TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) —
Gun duels between Israelis and
Jordanians broke out Wednes
day across the River Jordan in
the Beisan Valley south of the
Sea of Galilee.
The first exchanges of ma

minutes, by most accounts. Lat
er, a Jordanian army spokes
man said Israeli tanks opened
fire on Jordanian farmers and
sporadic machine-gun battles
spread to the south Jordan Val
ley.
Each side accused the other
of opening fire. An Israeli Army
spokesman said the Jordanians
opened up with machine guns
near Yardena, in the north of
Beisan Valley.
Jordan said the Israelis began
firing machine guns from the
Beit Yousef settlement in the
northern part of the valley.

• Anti-Gun Bill OK'd
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Senate Judiciary Committee
voted Wednesday to cement into
a broad anti-crime bill a section
providing tougher federal con
trols over firearms sales.
But, contrary to President
Johnson's recommendations, the
new restrictions would not pro
hibit interstate mail order sales
of rifles and shotguns to indi
viduals.
However, they would ban such
sales of other firearms, includ
ing concealable weapons like
pistols and revolvers.
There also would be an out
right ban on sales to persons un
der 21 years of age.
The bill would make it unlaw
ful for any person other than a
licensed dealer to receive in his
state of residence any firearm
other than a rifle or shotgun
obtained outside his state.
• Viet Peace
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
United States has sent another
message to North Vietnam In

the still-unsuccessful effort to
achieve agreement on a site for
preliminary peace talks, the
State Department disclosed
Wednesday.
It was understood that the
new U.S. message went to Ha
noi Monday and amounted to a
diplomatic prod to the Reds to
respond to earlier U.S. offers of
any of its list of 15 Asian and
European capitals as a meeting
place.
It was the fifth such commu

• Poor Red Turnout
BUDAPEST (AP) — A pre

Wednesday in a sealed-off hotel
with barely half the 88 delega

trench Soviet dominance over
the world's Marxist parties.
The stay at homes—49 by un

Cuba was reported missing as

Backers of Sen. Eugene J. Mc-

"As a result of the preferen

McCarthy had no immediate

• Big Blast Protested
LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP)
The mightiest nuclear blast to

Protests again possible dan

citizens, scientists, labor lead-

organization of Nevada's big

ard Hughes.
The test of a hydrogen device
will pack the wallop of one mil

style, for 250 miles or more.
A test last January rated at a

• ISetv Black Market
NEW YORK (AP) — Silently,

across the United States, an un

Immigration Act.
Government sources say the
illegal human traffic is the work
of a handful of immigration law

who spotted a chance to make
money by circumventing some
provisions of the act.
Of an estimated 25,000 alien
domestics now entering the na

estimate that over half are ad

papers provided—at a price—
to make them immediately a

An estimated 5.5 million Amer

one source said, and Americans

NEW YORK (AP) — Banker

He did not say explicitly what

"Confidence in the dollar is

LONDON (AP) — Several

There were signs that the ten

Wednesday when they refused

Except for this, the second

50 members of a group known
as The Resistance passed virtu

The small, orderly demon

About 2,000 persons, including
The Resistance, took part and
18 were arrested for scuffling

• Mideast Fighting
TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) —
Gun duels between Israelis and
Jordanians broke out Wednes
day across the River Jordan in
the Beisan Valley south of the
Sea of Galilee.
The first exchanges of ma

minutes, by most accounts. Lat
er, a Jordanian army spokes
man said Israeli tanks opened
fire on Jordanian farmers and
sporadic machine-gun battles
spread to the south Jordan Val
ley.
Each side accused the other
of opening fire. An Israeli Army
spokesman said the Jordanians
opened up with machine guns
near Yardena, in the north of
Beisan Valley.
Jordan said the Israelis began
firing machine guns from the
Beit Yousef settlement in the
northern part of the valley.

• Anti-Gun Bill OK'd
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Senate Judiciary Committee
voted Wednesday to cement into
a broad anti-crime bill a section
providing tougher federal con
trols over firearms sales.
But, contrary to President
Johnson's recommendations, the
new restrictions would not pro
hibit interstate mail order sales
of rifles and shotguns to indi
viduals.
However, they would ban such
sales of other firearms, includ
ing concealable weapons like
pistols and revolvers.
There also would be an out
right ban on sales to persons un
der 21 years of age.
The bill would make it unlaw
ful for any person other than a
licensed dealer to receive in his
state of residence any firearm
other than a rifle or shotgun
obtained outside his state.
• Viet Peace
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
United States has sent another
message to North Vietnam In

the still-unsuccessful effort to
achieve agreement on a site for
preliminary peace talks, the
State Department disclosed
Wednesday.
It was understood that the
new U.S. message went to Ha

diplomatic prod to the Reds to
respond to earlier U.S. offers of
any of its list of 15 Asian and
European capitals as a meeting

It was the fifth such commu

• Poor Red Turnout
BUDAPEST (AP) — A pre

Wednesday in a sealed-off hotel
with barely half the 88 delega

trench Soviet dominance over
the world's Marxist parties.
The stay at homes—49 by un

Cuba was reported missing as

PHILADELPHIA ( A P ) —
Backers of Sen. Eugene J. Mc-

Wednesday in Pennsylvania's

only a handful of the .state's 130

McCarthy's name was the

"As a result of the preferen

McCarthy had no immediate

• Big Blast Protested
LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP)
The mightiest nuclear blast to

Protests again possible dan

citizens, scientists, labor lead-

organization of Nevada's big

ard Hughes.
The test of a hydrogen device
will pack the wallop of one mil

A test last January rated at a

• ISetv Black Market
NEW YORK (AP) — Silently,

across the United States, an un

Immigration Act.
Government sources say the

of a handful of immigration law

who spotted a chance to make
money by circumventing some
provisions of the act.
Of an estimated 25,000 alien
domestics now entering the na

estimate that over half are ad

papers provided—at a price—
to make them immediately a

An estimated 5.5 million Amer

one source said, and Americans

NEW YORK (AP) — Banker

He did not say explicitly what
the higher priorities were but h->

"Confidence in the dollar is

LONDON (AP) — Several

There were signs that the ten

OAKLAND (AP) — Four

Except for this, the second

50 members of a group known
as The Resistance passed virtu

The small, orderly demon

About 2,000 persons, including
The Resistance, took part and
18 were arrested for scuffling

• Mideast Fighting
TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) —
Gun duels between Israelis and
Jordanians broke out Wednes
day across the River Jordan in
the Beisan Valley south of the
Sea of Galilee.
The first exchanges of ma

minutes, by most accounts. Lat
er, a Jordanian army spokes
man said Israeli tanks opened
fire on Jordanian farmers and
sporadic machine-gun battles
spread to the south Jordan Val
ley.
Each side accused the other
of opening fire. An Israeli Army
spokesman said the Jordanians
opened up with machine guns
near Yardena, in the north of
Beisan Valley.
Jordan said the Israelis began
firing machine guns from the
Beit Yousef settlement in the
northern part of the valley.
• Stocks Edge Up
NEW YORK (AP) — An uncer

Volume was 14.81 million
shares, compared with 14.1 mil

large blocks helped boost turn
over, even though the pace of
trading was not very fast by

The continued absence of any

to cross currents.
SACRAMENTO (AP) — The
Assembly voted Wednesday to
ease the penalty for marijuana
possession, after hearing that
judges and prosecutors evade
the current law because it is too
harsh on young people.
At the same time, the lower
house approved a toughening of
penalties for possession of dan

Both provisions were in the

a 50-25 vote that found 18 Re
