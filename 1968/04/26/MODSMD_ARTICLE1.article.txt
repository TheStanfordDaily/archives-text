# 1200 Students Back McCarthy, Kennedy
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
Supporters of Sen. Robert
Kennedy and Sen. Eugene Mc-
Carthy have enlisted the aid of
almost 1200 Stanford students
in the upcoming June 4 Califor
nia Presidential primary clash
between the two contenders for
the Democratic nomination.
The McCarthy group, which
began organizing in October,
has over a thousand students,
plus members of the faculty
and staff working on the cam
paign.
Chris Harte, co-ordinator of
the student activities, estimates
that by the time of the primary
between 600 and 700 Stanford
students will have become ac
tively involved in some phase
of the McCarthy campaign.
The Kennedy group has the
support of 140 students after a
month of organization. Accord
ing to student co-ordinator
Reese Shepard, "There seems to
be more interest on the campus
for Kennedy" during the past
week.
Shepard adds that Kennedy
support isn't necessarily coming
from McCarthy defectors, but
rather students who "hadn't
made up their minds."
Stanford Engineering Prof.
George Leppert, who is cur
rently on sabbatical leave,
switched from early support of
McCarthy to join the slate of
delegates for Kennedy. How
ever, there have been only a
few Stanford professors an
nouncing that their allegiance
has been swayed by Kennedy's
entering the race.
Both campaigns are largely
student organized and run. And
both groups are dependent on
the Stanford community to fi
nance their activities.
The McCarthy group has do
nated $1100 to campaigns in
Wisconsin and Indiana and for
organization of student activi
ties in northern California.
The Stanford group is espe
cially concerned that McCarthy
have the money to purchase tel
evision time before the primary.

In the Indiana campaign Ken
nedy was able to raise money
early enough to purchase prime
television time in the state.
The basic campaign strategy
for the Kennedy group involves
phoning voters to find the "bor
derline precincts. The Palo Alto
campaign committee will do the
canvassing this weekend, and
Shepard plans to begin actual
precinct work around May 18.
During the group's organiza
tional meeting, Shepard stressed
the fact that Kennedy support
ers must concentrate their ef
forts in "the critical precincts
that will vote for Kennedy once
we have worked there."
To this end, the group is or
ganizing into "crash crews" that
have the time and interest to de
vote to precinct work.
Beginning next weekend and
continuing up until the primary,
the McCarthy committee hopes
to have 400 students involved in
precinct work.
"The New Hampshire cam
paign showed us the value of
talking to every vote at least
once," said Harte.
Two weekends ago over 300
students turned out for McCar
thy. So far, over half of the
work done for McCarthy in the
Palo Alto area has been done by
Stanford students.
This weekend students from
Stanford will join thousands of
students from all over Califor
nia for door-to-door canvassing
in Los Angeles County.
There are plans to repeat this
same "concentrated effort" later
either in the East Bay or in the
Central Valley.
"We have the energy and the
people who have the time," said
Ernest Phinney in explaining
Stanford's participation in the
Los Angeles weekend.
This project, as are many of
the Stanford activities, is a joint
effort with the Palo Alto McCar
thy campaign headquarters.

Working together serves to
both groups' advantage. The
Palo Alto headquarters has ex
panded into a four-room office
with a full-time staff. At the
same time, Stanford offers a
large number of students who

are ready to work for McCar
thy.
The Kennedy committee is
working with the Northern
County Campaign Headquarters
for Kennedy in Palo Alto. Some
of the faculty support for Ken

nedy is especially involved at
this level.
Stanford Law Prof. Marc
Franklin is co • ordinating the
Bay Area Faculty Research
Group. He hopes that their
work will give Kennedy mate

rial on both national and local
problems.
McCarthy supporters feel cer
tain that Santa Clara County
will go strongly for their candi
date. As a result, student work
ers are being sent into precincts
in Cupertino, Sunnyvale, and
parts of San Mateo County.
Chris Harte is currently work
ing on trying to establish col
lege committees as far north as
Eureka, Weed, and Redding for
McCarthy. In this area Harte is
working on organizing a com
mittee at Notre Dame.
At the same time, the Ken
nedy group is attempting to
bring "more students of all
ages" into the campaign, accord
ing to Shepard.
An advertisement in Mon
day's Daily sharply criticized
McCarthy for his low Ameri
cans for Democratic Action rat
ing on "thirteen selected issues."
Supporters of both candidates
are worried that the resulting
controversy may touch off con
tinued allegations and counter
allegations between the two
groups.
Shepard maintains that no
one in the local Kennedy organ
ization placed the ad and specu
lates that it was sent out by
the national headquarters. A
similar advertisement appeared
in the Daily Californian this
week.
At the same time, Shepard
thinks that the ad "makes
sense" and that the group will
"stand by it."

Harte is particularly bothered
by the ad. "We had been as
sured by the Kennedy people
that this wasn't going to be a
smear campaign," he said.
Bob Stern, organizer of the
Stanford law students for Mc-
Carthy, said that students are
"not deserting McCarthy now,
but they are now questioning
his stands."
On the question of the issues
selected for evaluation, the
Stanford McCarthy committee
stated in a position paper:
"While it looks good to have
voted for every piece of liberal
legislation . . . , much of that
legislation is a sham."
Both groups are planning to
invite outside speakers to boost
their man's campaign.
The Kennedy group is "fairly
certain" that Cesar Chavez, Cal
ifornia farm labor organizer,
will speak on campus in late
May. In addition, the national
organization is maintaining a
group of "brain trust" speakers
for Kennedy. As part of this
phase of the campaign, Arthur
Schlesinger will speak at Stan
ford this Sunday. (See page 4.)
This Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.
in Dinkelspiel, William Bennett,
California Public Utilities Com
missioner and candidate for the
U.S. Senate, will speak in favor
of McCarthy.
All the campaign activity at
Stanford proves, as one McCar
thy supporter pointed out, that
it is apathy that is dead on the
college campuses.

both groups' advantage. The
Palo Alto headquarters has ex
panded into a four-room office
with a full-time staff. At the
same time, Stanford offers a
large number of students who

are ready to work for McCar
thy.
The Kennedy committee is
working with the Northern
County Campaign Headquarters
for Kennedy in Palo Alto. Some
of the faculty support for Ken

nedy is especially involved at
this level.
Stanford Law Prof. Marc
Franklin is co • ordinating the
Bay Area Faculty Research
Group. He hopes that their
work will give Kennedy mate

rial on both national and local
problems.
McCarthy supporters feel cer
tain that Santa Clara County
will go strongly for their candi
date. As a result, student work
ers are being sent into precincts
in Cupertino, Sunnyvale, and
parts of San Mateo County.
Chris Harte is currently work
ing on trying to establish col
lege committees as far north as
Eureka, Weed, and Redding for
McCarthy. In this area Harte is
working on organizing a com
mittee at Notre Dame.
At the same time, the Ken
nedy group is attempting to
bring "more students of all
ages" into the campaign, accord
ing to Shepard.
An advertisement in Mon
day's Daily sharply criticized
McCarthy for his low Ameri
cans for Democratic Action rat
ing on "thirteen selected issues."
Supporters of both candidates
are worried that the resulting
controversy may touch off con
tinued allegations and counter
allegations between the two
groups.
Shepard maintains that no
one in the local Kennedy organ
ization placed the ad and specu
lates that it was sent out by
the national headquarters. A
similar advertisement appeared
in the Daily Californian this
week.
At the same time, Shepard
thinks that the ad "makes
sense" and that the group will
"stand by it."

Harte is particularly bothered
by the ad. "We had been as
sured by the Kennedy people
that this wasn't going to be a
smear campaign," he said.
Bob Stern, organizer of the
Stanford law students for Mc-
Carthy, said that students are
"not deserting McCarthy now,
but they are now questioning
his stands."
On the question of the issues
selected for evaluation, the
Stanford McCarthy committee
stated in a position paper:
"While it looks good to have
voted for every piece of liberal
legislation . . . , much of that
legislation is a sham."
Both groups are planning to
invite outside speakers to boost
their man's campaign.
The Kennedy group is "fairly
certain" that Cesar Chavez, Cal
ifornia farm labor organizer,
will speak on campus in late
May. In addition, the national
organization is maintaining a
group of "brain trust" speakers
for Kennedy. As part of this
phase of the campaign, Arthur
Schlesinger will speak at Stan
ford this Sunday. (See page 4.)
This Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.
in Dinkelspiel, William Bennett,
California Public Utilities Com
missioner and candidate for the
U.S. Senate, will speak in favor
of McCarthy.
All the campaign activity at
Stanford proves, as one McCar
thy supporter pointed out, that
it is apathy that is dead on the
college campuses.


PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS —These McCarthy volunteers are some of the more than 1200 students
on eampus who are taking an active role In the California Democratic primary. The Kennedy
supporters have also been very active on campus and in the surrounding area. The primary will be
June 4.
Supporters of Sen. Robert
Kennedy and Sen. Eugene Mc-
Carthy have enlisted the aid of
almost 1200 Stanford students
in the upcoming June 4 Califor
nia Presidential primary clash
between the two contenders for
the Democratic nomination.
The McCarthy group, which
began organizing in October,
has over a thousand students,
plus members of the faculty
and staff working on the cam
paign.
Chris Harte, co-ordinator of
the student activities, estimates
that by the time of the primary
between 600 and 700 Stanford
students will have become ac
tively involved in some phase
of the McCarthy campaign.
The Kennedy group has the
support of 140 students after a
month of organization. Accord
ing to student co-ordinator
Reese Shepard, "There seems to
be more interest on the campus
for Kennedy" during the past
week.
Shepard adds that Kennedy
support isn't necessarily coming
from McCarthy defectors, but
rather students who "hadn't
made up their minds."
Stanford Engineering Prof.
George Leppert, who is cur
rently on sabbatical leave,
switched from early support of
McCarthy to join the slate of
delegates for Kennedy. How
ever, there have been only a
few Stanford professors an
nouncing that their allegiance
has been swayed by Kennedy's
entering the race.
Both campaigns are largely
student organized and run. And
both groups are dependent on
the Stanford community to fi
nance their activities.
The McCarthy group has do
nated $1100 to campaigns in
Wisconsin and Indiana and for
organization of student activi
ties in northern California.
The Stanford group is espe
cially concerned that McCarthy
have the money to purchase tel
evision time before the primary.

In the Indiana campaign Ken
nedy was able to raise money
early enough to purchase prime
television time in the state.
The basic campaign strategy
for the Kennedy group involves
phoning voters to find the "bor
derline precincts. The Palo Alto
campaign committee will do the
canvassing this weekend, and
Shepard plans to begin actual
precinct work around May 18.
During the group's organiza
tional meeting, Shepard stressed
the fact that Kennedy support
ers must concentrate their ef
forts in "the critical precincts
that will vote for Kennedy once
we have worked there."
To this end, the group is or
ganizing into "crash crews" that
have the time and interest to de
vote to precinct work.
Beginning next weekend and
continuing up until the primary,
the McCarthy committee hopes
to have 400 students involved in
precinct work.
"The New Hampshire cam
paign showed us the value of
talking to every vote at least
once," said Harte.
Two weekends ago over 300
students turned out for McCar
thy. So far, over half of the
work done for McCarthy in the
Palo Alto area has been done by
Stanford students.
This weekend students from
Stanford will join thousands of
students from all over Califor
nia for door-to-door canvassing
in Los Angeles County.
There are plans to repeat this
same "concentrated effort" later
either in the East Bay or in the
Central Valley.
"We have the energy and the
people who have the time," said
Ernest Phinney in explaining
Stanford's participation in the
Los Angeles weekend.

the Stanford activities, is a joint
effort with the Palo Alto McCar

Kennedy and Sen. Eugene Mc-
Carthy have enlisted the aid of
almost 1200 Stanford students
in the upcoming June 4 Califor
nia Presidential primary clash
between the two contenders for
the Democratic nomination.
The McCarthy group, which
began organizing in October,
has over a thousand students,
plus members of the faculty
and staff working on the cam
paign.
Chris Harte, co-ordinator of
the student activities, estimates
that by the time of the primary
between 600 and 700 Stanford
students will have become ac
tively involved in some phase
of the McCarthy campaign.
The Kennedy group has the
support of 140 students after a
month of organization. Accord
ing to student co-ordinator
Reese Shepard, "There seems to
be more interest on the campus
for Kennedy" during the past
week.
Shepard adds that Kennedy
support isn't necessarily coming
from McCarthy defectors, but
rather students who "hadn't
made up their minds."
Stanford Engineering Prof.
George Leppert, who is cur
rently on sabbatical leave,
switched from early support of
McCarthy to join the slate of
delegates for Kennedy. How
ever, there have been only a
few Stanford professors an
nouncing that their allegiance
has been swayed by Kennedy's
entering the race.
Both campaigns are largely
student organized and run. And
both groups are dependent on
the Stanford community to fi
nance their activities.
The McCarthy group has do
nated $1100 to campaigns in
Wisconsin and Indiana and for
organization of student activi
ties in northern California.
The Stanford group is espe
cially concerned that McCarthy
have the money to purchase tel
evision time before the primary.

In the Indiana campaign Ken
nedy was able to raise money
early enough to purchase prime
television time in the state.
The basic campaign strategy
for the Kennedy group involves
phoning voters to find the "bor
derline precincts. The Palo Alto
campaign committee will do the
canvassing this weekend, and
Shepard plans to begin actual
precinct work around May 18.
During the group's organiza
tional meeting, Shepard stressed
the fact that Kennedy support
ers must concentrate their ef
forts in "the critical precincts
that will vote for Kennedy once
we have worked there."
To this end, the group is or
ganizing into "crash crews" that
have the time and interest to de
vote to precinct work.
Beginning next weekend and
continuing up until the primary,
the McCarthy committee hopes
to have 400 students involved in
precinct work.
"The New Hampshire cam
paign showed us the value of
talking to every vote at least
once," said Harte.
Two weekends ago over 300
students turned out for McCar
thy. So far, over half of the
work done for McCarthy in the
Palo Alto area has been done by
Stanford students.
This weekend students from
Stanford will join thousands of
students from all over Califor
nia for door-to-door canvassing
in Los Angeles County.
There are plans to repeat this
same "concentrated effort" later
either in the East Bay or in the
Central Valley.
"We have the energy and the
people who have the time," said
Ernest Phinney in explaining
Stanford's participation in the
Los Angeles weekend.
This project, as are many of
the Stanford activities, is a joint
effort with the Palo Alto McCar
thy campaign headquarters.

Working together serves to
both groups' advantage. The
Palo Alto headquarters has ex
panded into a four-room office
with a full-time staff. At the
same time, Stanford offers a
large number of students who

are ready to work for McCar
thy.
The Kennedy committee is
working with the Northern
County Campaign Headquarters
for Kennedy in Palo Alto. Some
of the faculty support for Ken

nedy is especially involved at
this level.
Stanford Law Prof. Marc
Franklin is co • ordinating the
Bay Area Faculty Research
Group. He hopes that their
work will give Kennedy mate

rial on both national and local
problems.
McCarthy supporters feel cer
tain that Santa Clara County
will go strongly for their candi
date. As a result, student work
ers are being sent into precincts
in Cupertino, Sunnyvale, and
parts of San Mateo County.
Chris Harte is currently work
ing on trying to establish col
lege committees as far north as
Eureka, Weed, and Redding for
McCarthy. In this area Harte is
working on organizing a com
mittee at Notre Dame.
At the same time, the Ken
nedy group is attempting to
bring "more students of all
ages" into the campaign, accord
ing to Shepard.
An advertisement in Mon
day's Daily sharply criticized
McCarthy for his low Ameri
cans for Democratic Action rat
ing on "thirteen selected issues."
Supporters of both candidates
are worried that the resulting
controversy may touch off con
tinued allegations and counter
allegations between the two
groups.
Shepard maintains that no
one in the local Kennedy organ
ization placed the ad and specu
lates that it was sent out by
the national headquarters. A
similar advertisement appeared
in the Daily Californian this
week.
At the same time, Shepard
thinks that the ad "makes
sense" and that the group will
"stand by it."

Harte is particularly bothered
by the ad. "We had been as
sured by the Kennedy people
that this wasn't going to be a
smear campaign," he said.
Bob Stern, organizer of the
Stanford law students for Mc-
Carthy, said that students are
"not deserting McCarthy now,
but they are now questioning
his stands."
On the question of the issues
selected for evaluation, the
Stanford McCarthy committee
stated in a position paper:
"While it looks good to have
voted for every piece of liberal
legislation . . . , much of that
legislation is a sham."
Both groups are planning to
invite outside speakers to boost
their man's campaign.
The Kennedy group is "fairly
certain" that Cesar Chavez, Cal
ifornia farm labor organizer,
will speak on campus in late
May. In addition, the national
organization is maintaining a
group of "brain trust" speakers
for Kennedy. As part of this
phase of the campaign, Arthur
Schlesinger will speak at Stan
ford this Sunday. (See page 4.)
This Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.
in Dinkelspiel, William Bennett,
California Public Utilities Com
missioner and candidate for the
U.S. Senate, will speak in favor
of McCarthy.
All the campaign activity at
Stanford proves, as one McCar
thy supporter pointed out, that
it is apathy that is dead on the
college campuses.

panded into a four-room office
with a full-time staff. At the
same time, Stanford offers a
large number of students who

are ready to work for McCar
thy.
The Kennedy committee is
working with the Northern
County Campaign Headquarters
for Kennedy in Palo Alto. Some
of the faculty support for Ken

nedy is especially involved at
this level.
Stanford Law Prof. Marc
Franklin is co • ordinating the
Bay Area Faculty Research
Group. He hopes that their
work will give Kennedy mate

rial on both national and local
problems.
McCarthy supporters feel cer
tain that Santa Clara County
will go strongly for their candi
date. As a result, student work
ers are being sent into precincts
in Cupertino, Sunnyvale, and
parts of San Mateo County.
Chris Harte is currently work
ing on trying to establish col
lege committees as far north as
Eureka, Weed, and Redding for
McCarthy. In this area Harte is
working on organizing a com
mittee at Notre Dame.
At the same time, the Ken
nedy group is attempting to
bring "more students of all
ages" into the campaign, accord
ing to Shepard.
An advertisement in Mon
day's Daily sharply criticized
McCarthy for his low Ameri
cans for Democratic Action rat
ing on "thirteen selected issues."
Supporters of both candidates
are worried that the resulting
controversy may touch off con
tinued allegations and counter
allegations between the two
groups.
Shepard maintains that no
one in the local Kennedy organ
ization placed the ad and specu
lates that it was sent out by
the national headquarters. A
similar advertisement appeared
in the Daily Californian this
week.
At the same time, Shepard
thinks that the ad "makes
sense" and that the group will
"stand by it."

Harte is particularly bothered
by the ad. "We had been as
sured by the Kennedy people
that this wasn't going to be a
smear campaign," he said.
Bob Stern, organizer of the
Stanford law students for Mc-
Carthy, said that students are
"not deserting McCarthy now,
but they are now questioning
his stands."
On the question of the issues
selected for evaluation, the
Stanford McCarthy committee
stated in a position paper:
"While it looks good to have
voted for every piece of liberal
legislation . . . , much of that
legislation is a sham."
Both groups are planning to
invite outside speakers to boost
their man's campaign.
The Kennedy group is "fairly
certain" that Cesar Chavez, Cal
ifornia farm labor organizer,
will speak on campus in late
May. In addition, the national
organization is maintaining a
group of "brain trust" speakers
for Kennedy. As part of this
phase of the campaign, Arthur
Schlesinger will speak at Stan
ford this Sunday. (See page 4.)
This Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.
in Dinkelspiel, William Bennett,
California Public Utilities Com
missioner and candidate for the
U.S. Senate, will speak in favor
of McCarthy.
All the campaign activity at
Stanford proves, as one McCar
thy supporter pointed out, that
it is apathy that is dead on the
college campuses.


PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS —These McCarthy volunteers are some of the more than 1200 students
on eampus who are taking an active role In the California Democratic primary. The Kennedy
supporters have also been very active on campus and in the surrounding area. The primary will be
June 4.
Supporters of Sen. Robert
Kennedy and Sen. Eugene Mc-
Carthy have enlisted the aid of
almost 1200 Stanford students
in the upcoming June 4 Califor
nia Presidential primary clash
between the two contenders for
the Democratic nomination.
The McCarthy group, which
began organizing in October,
has over a thousand students,
plus members of the faculty
and staff working on the cam
paign.
Chris Harte, co-ordinator of
the student activities, estimates
that by the time of the primary
between 600 and 700 Stanford
students will have become ac
tively involved in some phase
of the McCarthy campaign.
The Kennedy group has the
support of 140 students after a
month of organization. Accord
ing to student co-ordinator
Reese Shepard, "There seems to
be more interest on the campus
for Kennedy" during the past
week.
Shepard adds that Kennedy
support isn't necessarily coming
from McCarthy defectors, but
rather students who "hadn't
made up their minds."
Stanford Engineering Prof.
George Leppert, who is cur
rently on sabbatical leave,
switched from early support of
McCarthy to join the slate of
delegates for Kennedy. How
ever, there have been only a
few Stanford professors an
nouncing that their allegiance
has been swayed by Kennedy's
entering the race.
Both campaigns are largely
student organized and run. And
both groups are dependent on
the Stanford community to fi
nance their activities.
The McCarthy group has do
nated $1100 to campaigns in
Wisconsin and Indiana and for
organization of student activi
ties in northern California.
The Stanford group is espe
cially concerned that McCarthy
have the money to purchase tel
evision time before the primary.

In the Indiana campaign Ken
nedy was able to raise money
early enough to purchase prime
television time in the state.
The basic campaign strategy
for the Kennedy group involves
phoning voters to find the "bor
derline precincts. The Palo Alto
campaign committee will do the
canvassing this weekend, and
Shepard plans to begin actual
precinct work around May 18.
During the group's organiza
tional meeting, Shepard stressed
the fact that Kennedy support
ers must concentrate their ef
forts in "the critical precincts
that will vote for Kennedy once
we have worked there."
To this end, the group is or
ganizing into "crash crews" that
have the time and interest to de
vote to precinct work.
Beginning next weekend and
continuing up until the primary,
the McCarthy committee hopes
to have 400 students involved in
precinct work.
"The New Hampshire cam
paign showed us the value of
talking to every vote at least
once," said Harte.
Two weekends ago over 300
students turned out for McCar
thy. So far, over half of the
work done for McCarthy in the
Palo Alto area has been done by
Stanford students.
This weekend students from
Stanford will join thousands of
students from all over Califor
nia for door-to-door canvassing
in Los Angeles County.
There are plans to repeat this
same "concentrated effort" later
either in the East Bay or in the
Central Valley.
"We have the energy and the
people who have the time," said
Ernest Phinney in explaining
Stanford's participation in the
Los Angeles weekend.
This project, as are many of
the Stanford activities, is a joint
effort with the Palo Alto McCar
thy campaign headquarters.

Working together serves to
both groups' advantage. The
Palo Alto headquarters has ex
panded into a four-room office
with a full-time staff. At the
same time, Stanford offers a
large number of students who

are ready to work for McCar
thy.
