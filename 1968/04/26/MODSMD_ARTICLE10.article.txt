# The 						Washington Merry-Go-Round
## Southern Governor Resists Job Training For Negroes 
### Drew Pearson 
GREENVILLE, Miss. — What
does the South, which has seen
its share of race riots, sit-ins,
and bombings, think of the ra
cial trauma experienced by big
Northern cities today?
I got the answer down here
in the heart of the Black Belt,
an area so named not because
of the Negro population but be
cause its soil is probably the
blackest and richest In the Unit
ed States. The population also
justifies the name, for in the
Delta the ratio is sixty per cent
Negro in the countryside, fifty
per cent in the cities.
Greenville, which has that ra
tio, is a prosperous farming
community where cotton once
was king and still is queen. The
city nestles below the levee of
the Mississippi River, which is
higher than most of Greenville's
buildings. The docks where
steamboats and barges once
loaded bales of cotton are idle
now, for the river, in all its
mifht and majesty, cut a new
channel, leaving Greenville be
hind.
Aside from this geographic
freak, however, the citizens of
Greenville are not left behind.
Four years ago, in the summer
of 1964, Greenville was the head
quarters of the Delta Ministry,
a group of white Northern
preachers who carried the civil
rights gospel all over Mississip
pi. Partly as a result of that
1964 drive, Negroes have now
won their civil rights. Large

numbers are registered, and vote
in- state and national elections.
But the economic security which
they expected with political
achievement has not arrived.
The agricultural revolution
has come to Mississippi, but not
the industrial revolution. Thou
sands of Negroes have been put
out of work by the development
of cotton-picking machinery,
chemical weed killers, and acre
age cut-backs. The big planta
tion owners get subsidy pay
ments for these cutbacks (Sen.
Jim Eastland gets $129,000 an
nually), but the Negro either
goes north to Chicago and De
troit, or he swells the ranks of
the untrained and the unem
ployed at home.
Hints Of Violence
As a result, and especially
since the death of Martin Lu
ther King, there has been new
restlessness among Mississippi
Negroes.
Greenville's Chief of Police,
W. C. Burnley, one of the best
in the state, has warned the city
council of trouble ahead. He re
ported that never before had his
men been the subject of bottle
throwing. He asked for more
men, more equipment, and pay
for police overtime.
"This is the first time in my
career of 22 years that I have
seen so much animosity toward
me and my men," Chief Burnley
told the city council. "It's only a
matter of time before a serious
incident occurs."

Negro leader Charles Moore,
President of the Herbert Lee
Memorial Community Center,
objected to increased arms,
warned it would lead to blood
shed.
"I am not getting out there
in the street between the kids
and the police so they can shoot
me in the back and say I was
inciting a riot," Moore said.
The white leaders of Green
ville are definitely concerned
and definitely are doing some
thing. They are not interested
in gloating over race problems
in the North and saying we
told you so. They recognize that
the race problem is a national
one which basically calls for bet
ter Negro training.
Accordingly they have worked
out a project to take over the
barrarks of the Greenville Air
Force Base, now empty, and use
them for training projects un
der the Graflex Division of Gen
eral Precision.
Graflex has agreed. The fed
eral government in Washington
has put up $2,000,000 subject to
matching funds. The Ford Foun
dation has put up $500,000 to
help supply the matching funds.
The only party which has not
agreed is the State of Mississip
pi.
Governor Objects
Here, newly elected Gov. John
Bell Williams has thrown in a
monkey wrench. John Bell is the
rabble-rousing racist who was
demoted by the House of Repre
sentatives in Washington when
he bolted the Democratic Party
for Goldwater in 1964. He came
back to Mississippi to be elected
governor in a race where two
moderates gave him a real battle
—Democrat William Winter in
the primary and Republican Ru
bel Phillips in the final election.
Williams, now secure as gover
nor, has refused to go along with
the attempt of Greenville citi
zens to give more job training
to Negroes. Williams's objec
tions are threefold:
1. The fourteen-member bl
racial advisory board contains
some civil rights activists, such
as Fannie Lou Hamer who ran
for Congress on the Freedom
Democratic ticket, attempting to
unseat Williams.
2. The Greenville plan calls for
25 Negro families to live in the
barracks, which have been emp
ty for six years. Gov. Williams
claims this would be a "com
mune" and might lead to com
munism.
3. Williams wants safeguards
written into the contract with
Graflex whereby the project
would not become a staging area
for civil rights demonstrations.
Greenville businessmen, led
by banker Ray Smith, President
of the Chamber of Commerce,
and Gen. Albert Lake, a retired
Army officer, are trying to over
come the Governor's objections.
They are enthusiastic about the
project, believe that economic
stability through job training is
the key to better race relations.

Governor Objects
Here, newly elected Gov. John
Bell Williams has thrown in a
monkey wrench. John Bell is the
rabble-rousing racist who was
demoted by the House of Repre
sentatives in Washington when
he bolted the Democratic Party
for Goldwater in 1964. He came
back to Mississippi to be elected
governor in a race where two
moderates gave him a real battle
—Democrat William Winter in
the primary and Republican Ru
bel Phillips in the final election.
Williams, now secure as gover
nor, has refused to go along with
the attempt of Greenville citi
zens to give more job training
to Negroes. Williams's objec
tions are threefold:
1. The fourteen-member bl
racial advisory board contains
some civil rights activists, such
as Fannie Lou Hamer who ran
for Congress on the Freedom
Democratic ticket, attempting to
unseat Williams.
2. The Greenville plan calls for
25 Negro families to live in the
barracks, which have been emp
ty for six years. Gov. Williams
claims this would be a "com
mune" and might lead to com
munism.
3. Williams wants safeguards
written into the contract with
Graflex whereby the project
would not become a staging area
for civil rights demonstrations.
Greenville businessmen, led
by banker Ray Smith, President
of the Chamber of Commerce,
and Gen. Albert Lake, a retired
Army officer, are trying to over
come the Governor's objections.
They are enthusiastic about the
project, believe that economic
stability through job training is
the key to better race relations.

GREENVILLE, Miss. — What
does the South, which has seen
its share of race riots, sit-ins,
and bombings, think of the ra
cial trauma experienced by big
Northern cities today?
I got the answer down here
in the heart of the Black Belt,
an area so named not because
of the Negro population but be
cause its soil is probably the
blackest and richest In the Unit
ed States. The population also
justifies the name, for in the
Delta the ratio is sixty per cent
Negro in the countryside, fifty
per cent in the cities.
Greenville, which has that ra
tio, is a prosperous farming
community where cotton once
was king and still is queen. The
city nestles below the levee of
the Mississippi River, which is
higher than most of Greenville's
buildings. The docks where
steamboats and barges once
loaded bales of cotton are idle
now, for the river, in all its
mifht and majesty, cut a new
channel, leaving Greenville be
hind.
Aside from this geographic
freak, however, the citizens of
Greenville are not left behind.
Four years ago, in the summer
of 1964, Greenville was the head
quarters of the Delta Ministry,
a group of white Northern
preachers who carried the civil
rights gospel all over Mississip
pi. Partly as a result of that
1964 drive, Negroes have now
won their civil rights. Large

numbers are registered, and vote
in- state and national elections.
But the economic security which
they expected with political
achievement has not arrived.
The agricultural revolution
has come to Mississippi, but not
the industrial revolution. Thou
sands of Negroes have been put
out of work by the development
of cotton-picking machinery,
chemical weed killers, and acre
age cut-backs. The big planta
tion owners get subsidy pay
ments for these cutbacks (Sen.
Jim Eastland gets $129,000 an
nually), but the Negro either
goes north to Chicago and De
troit, or he swells the ranks of
the untrained and the unem
ployed at home.
Hints Of Violence
As a result, and especially
since the death of Martin Lu
ther King, there has been new
restlessness among Mississippi
Negroes.
Greenville's Chief of Police,
W. C. Burnley, one of the best
in the state, has warned the city
council of trouble ahead. He re
ported that never before had his
men been the subject of bottle
throwing. He asked for more
men, more equipment, and pay
for police overtime.
"This is the first time in my
career of 22 years that I have
seen so much animosity toward
me and my men," Chief Burnley
told the city council. "It's only a
matter of time before a serious
incident occurs."

Negro leader Charles Moore,
President of the Herbert Lee
Memorial Community Center,
objected to increased arms,
warned it would lead to blood
shed.
"I am not getting out there
in the street between the kids
and the police so they can shoot
me in the back and say I was
inciting a riot," Moore said.
The white leaders of Green
ville are definitely concerned
and definitely are doing some
thing. They are not interested
in gloating over race problems
in the North and saying we
told you so. They recognize that
the race problem is a national
one which basically calls for bet
ter Negro training.
Accordingly they have worked
out a project to take over the
barrarks of the Greenville Air
Force Base, now empty, and use
them for training projects un
der the Graflex Division of Gen
eral Precision.

chemical weed killers, and acre
age cut-backs. The big planta
tion owners get subsidy pay
ments for these cutbacks (Sen.
Jim Eastland gets $129,000 an
nually), but the Negro either
goes north to Chicago and De
troit, or he swells the ranks of
the untrained and the unem
ployed at home.
Hints Of Violence
As a result, and especially
since the death of Martin Lu
ther King, there has been new
restlessness among Mississippi
Negroes.
Greenville's Chief of Police,
W. C. Burnley, one of the best
in the state, has warned the city
council of trouble ahead. He re
ported that never before had his
men been the subject of bottle
throwing. He asked for more
men, more equipment, and pay
for police overtime.
"This is the first time in my
career of 22 years that I have
seen so much animosity toward
me and my men," Chief Burnley
told the city council. "It's only a
matter of time before a serious
incident occurs."

Negro leader Charles Moore,
President of the Herbert Lee
Memorial Community Center,
objected to increased arms,
warned it would lead to blood
shed.
"I am not getting out there
in the street between the kids
and the police so they can shoot
me in the back and say I was
inciting a riot," Moore said.
The white leaders of Green
ville are definitely concerned
and definitely are doing some
thing. They are not interested
in gloating over race problems
in the North and saying we
told you so. They recognize that
the race problem is a national
one which basically calls for bet
ter Negro training.
Accordingly they have worked
out a project to take over the
barrarks of the Greenville Air
Force Base, now empty, and use
them for training projects un
der the Graflex Division of Gen
eral Precision.
Graflex has agreed. The fed
eral government in Washington
has put up $2,000,000 subject to
matching funds. The Ford Foun
dation has put up $500,000 to
help supply the matching funds.
The only party which has not
agreed is the State of Mississip
pi.
Governor Objects
Here, newly elected Gov. John
Bell Williams has thrown in a
monkey wrench. John Bell is the
rabble-rousing racist who was
demoted by the House of Repre
sentatives in Washington when
he bolted the Democratic Party
for Goldwater in 1964. He came
back to Mississippi to be elected
governor in a race where two
moderates gave him a real battle
—Democrat William Winter in
the primary and Republican Ru
bel Phillips in the final election.
Williams, now secure as gover
nor, has refused to go along with
the attempt of Greenville citi
zens to give more job training
to Negroes. Williams's objec
tions are threefold:
1. The fourteen-member bl
racial advisory board contains
some civil rights activists, such
as Fannie Lou Hamer who ran
for Congress on the Freedom
Democratic ticket, attempting to
unseat Williams.
2. The Greenville plan calls for
25 Negro families to live in the
barracks, which have been emp
ty for six years. Gov. Williams
claims this would be a "com
mune" and might lead to com
munism.
3. Williams wants safeguards
written into the contract with
Graflex whereby the project
would not become a staging area
for civil rights demonstrations.
Greenville businessmen, led
by banker Ray Smith, President
of the Chamber of Commerce,
and Gen. Albert Lake, a retired
Army officer, are trying to over
come the Governor's objections.
They are enthusiastic about the
project, believe that economic
stability through job training is
the key to better race relations.

GREENVILLE, Miss. — What
does the South, which has seen
its share of race riots, sit-ins,
and bombings, think of the ra
cial trauma experienced by big
Northern cities today?
I got the answer down here
in the heart of the Black Belt,
an area so named not because
of the Negro population but be
cause its soil is probably the
blackest and richest In the Unit
ed States. The population also
justifies the name, for in the
Delta the ratio is sixty per cent
Negro in the countryside, fifty
per cent in the cities.
Greenville, which has that ra
tio, is a prosperous farming
community where cotton once
was king and still is queen. The
city nestles below the levee of
the Mississippi River, which is
higher than most of Greenville's
buildings. The docks where
steamboats and barges once
loaded bales of cotton are idle
now, for the river, in all its
mifht and majesty, cut a new
channel, leaving Greenville be
hind.
Aside from this geographic
freak, however, the citizens of
Greenville are not left behind.
Four years ago, in the summer
of 1964, Greenville was the head
quarters of the Delta Ministry,
a group of white Northern
preachers who carried the civil
rights gospel all over Mississip
pi. Partly as a result of that
1964 drive, Negroes have now
won their civil rights. Large

numbers are registered, and vote
in- state and national elections.
But the economic security which
they expected with political
achievement has not arrived.
The agricultural revolution
has come to Mississippi, but not
the industrial revolution. Thou
sands of Negroes have been put
out of work by the development
of cotton-picking machinery,
chemical weed killers, and acre
age cut-backs. The big planta
tion owners get subsidy pay
ments for these cutbacks (Sen.
Jim Eastland gets $129,000 an
