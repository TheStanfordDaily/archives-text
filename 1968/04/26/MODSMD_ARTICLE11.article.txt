Black people, black people,
black people .... What's going
to happen this summer? Are
there going to be many riots?
What big cities do you think
are going to go up?
These are the questions that
are asked by white America.
These are the questions that a
black Stanford student is ex
pected to answer, to be intellec
tual about, to be the black mili
tant about.
These are the wrong ques
tions to be asking. It seems per
haps that it is the American
way, to view the result, the ef
fect, instead of, viewing the
cause, the origin.
Yes. the summer is coming
and with it perhaps more riots.
It is a riot when thousands
of black youths are left jobless
during the summer months be
cause of the hiring of a white
racist system.
It is a riot when black youths
have to attend school without
the benefit of proper clothing
and a decent noon meal.
It is a riot when government
funds are used to investigate
and subsequently to declare
that America is a racist system,
especially when the black com
munity has been aware of this
fact for more than fourhundred
years and these funds should,
in fact, be used to initiate
moves to change the system and
and to correct the grave injus
tices perpetuated by that racist
system.
And, it is a riot when I have

to sit here pounding away at
this typewriter asking for
that should have been offered
long ago.
Of course, when confronted
by a black, your inevitable an
swer is going to be, "What can
I do? How can I help?"
Well, I have an answer. Can
you dig it? I have an outlet.
Interested blacks and whites
are joining efforts this summer
in an attempt to meet the ever
pressing problems of employ
ment for black youths in the
East Palo Alto and East Menlo
Park areas. They are setting up
summer employment programs
on Stanford campus and sur
rounding commercial and in
dustrial areas.
These programs will last for
various periods of time, some
three to five weeks and others
ten or eleven weeks, but this
for the most part is not what
really matters. What really
matters is that certain whites
are beginning to examine and
to test themselves, and the re
sults are that black youths are
receiving urgently needed sum
mer jobs. So why must I con
tinue to scream? Because that's
not enough. Because there are
still some, who refuse to ex
amine and test, refuse to help
change a society that is basic
ally a racist one.
In the ghetto we have a say
ing, "Every Negro is potential
ly a black man" .... and along
that same black interpretation,
another saying can be projected
. . . . "Every white man is po
tentially a feeling human be
ing." A feeling human being
that recognizes the need and

the societal inequities that are
imposed upon a fellow human
being, and upon this knowledge
takes action, That's all I'm
screaming about—ACTION.
At a Job Fair held at Ravens
wood High School a couple of
days ago, only forty jobs were
on hand, here at Stanford, to
meet the needs of about one
hundred and sixty-one black
youths. One hundred and sixty
one black youths who had to
walk away empty-handed, back
to the streets, back to the
ghetto, back to socio-political
and economic cess pools to
which the American dream has
relegated the black man.
I can still recall another
dream that was cut-short by a
sniper's bullet. A dream that
perhaps was the only thing that
could cement the differences
and ill-will among blacks and
whites, into a unity of some
type. The Rev. Dr. Martin Lu
ther King Jr. was that dream,
and now he is gone.
So without threat or malice,
in language and style that can
be easily understood, I ask all
administrators, faculty, alumni,
teaching aids, school staff, and
Stanford students to find, and if
necessary, create jobs for the
summer to benefit black youths
of the East Palo Alto and East
Menlo Park areas—to benefit
the young residents of Amer
ica's forsaken black ghettos. If
you have summer jobs or if
you have information about
jobs for this summer . . . Please
contact Mike Ravizza, Joyce
King, Johnie Scott, or myself,

Personnel Office in Encina Hall.
