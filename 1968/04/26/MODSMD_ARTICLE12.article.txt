## 45 Students Demand Art Dept. Reforms 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford Art Department
has long displayed a consistent
ly hypocritical attitude toward
studio art and creative expres
sion in the University commu
nity.
By continually sponsoring to
ken art shows and operating a
token studio art program, the
Art Department has managed to
maintain the image of foster
ing creative work, which it has
done only to an appallingly lim
ited extent. Three out of thou
sands of examples display the
superficial nature of the Uni
versity's commitment to crea
tive art:
1. Having received a generous
donation for the construction of
a new art building, the Art De
partment is proceeding to build
a structure with an architectu
ral quality similar to that of the
Undergraduate Library, com
monly called "The UGLY." A
chance to demonstrate commit
ment to creative architecture
was avoided.
2. Last week a Stanford grad
uate student's exhibit in the Old
Union was removed because it
was deemed "vile" and "sordid"
by the occupants of the build
ing. The Art Department
claimed that it was "not in
volved" with the exhibit.
Through silence it has condoned
popular opinion of the exhibit
and has aided in reinforcing the
public's belief that Michel
Barnes, the artist, is a mere
publicity seeker of dubious ar
tistic merit. Apathy is not non
involvement. If the Art Depart
ment is interested in sponsoring
studio art, it must be ready to
defend students under attack
and insist upon the right for
valid works of art to be shown
in the University. . . .
3. Next year the Art Depart
ment will not find a replacement
for Assistant Prof. Robert Mul
len, its only full - time faculty
member in the field of sculp
ture. The Art Department there
by eliminates all but a few
sculpture courses in a process
destined to phase out one of the
most exciting and vital contem
porary art forms, as well as an
art form traditionally accepted
as significant. This is not an in
dication of true concern with
studio art.
We are making no specific
complaint against any specific
member of the Art Department.
We criticize the way in which
the Art Department has func
tioned in a University suppos
edly espousing truth, freedom,
etc. . . . But in order to main
tain some sort of integrity in
the University we recommend
that:
1. The studio division of the
department should be discontin
ued, as past actions have im
plied, or
2. That the department use
funds presently budgeted to
hire a sculpture professor for
the academic year 1968-69, with
the possibility of his acquiring
tenure if found acceptable.
3. That the Art Department
discontinue its policy of non
involvement in Barnes' exhibit
in the Old Union.
4. That the Art Department,
by reallocation of funds and re
ordering of priorities, show that
it has an honest intention to
support studio art.

Banned Art Exhibit
Had Profound Vision
Editor, The Daily:
I was embarrassed to learn
that Michael Barnes' recent ex
hibit in the Old Union has been
cancelled.
Mr. Barnes' vision Is pro
foundly modern. His finest paint
ing, "Woman walking Lover"
(I.e. vacuum cleaner) Is a mirror
of our times.
In a blunt, dadaist manner the
artist has transformed the com
monplace machine into a myth.
Man must decide whether the
overwhelming, dogmatic forces
of this machine and nuclear age
will determine his fate or wheth
er the poetry of the mind will
prevail. Clearly this allegorical
lover, with a blindman's cane,
is walking down that road.
Another contemporary artist,
Eugene lonesco, in his play,
The Motor Car depicts a sim
ilar confrontation between man
and things-of-his-creation. A
gentleman who has been shown
male and female cars "un vol
ture" and "une voiture" finally
falls in love with a blond female
car and decides to marry her.
It seems to me that to judge
art morally is very bourgeois
indeed.

About Springer Press
Editor, The Daily:
A majority of German stu
dents will definitely concur with
Drew Pearson's | Thursday's
Daily] denouncing the use of
violence in the recent student
demonstrations in Germany. j
But with the rest of the ar
ticle the same majority simply
cannot go along. The essence of
this article is: Springer is pro-
American and consequently
right, Dutschke and his radicals
are anti-American, i.e. wrong.
The issues are not that sim
ple. Dutschke himself is far
from advocating violence, he is
not hating America, but hating
the policy of the current U.S.
Administration — and I have
been told that there are even in
this country a few who share
this view.
To call Springer the backbone
of German democracy is a slap
in the face for everybody who
has watched Springer's per
formance during the last ten
years, who thinks that a cold
war attitude is outdated, and
who wants to ease the tension
between East and West.

Banned Art Exhibit
Had Profound Vision
Editor, The Daily:
I was embarrassed to learn
that Michael Barnes' recent ex
hibit in the Old Union has been
cancelled.
Mr. Barnes' vision Is pro
foundly modern. His finest paint
ing, "Woman walking Lover"
(I.e. vacuum cleaner) Is a mirror
of our times.
In a blunt, dadaist manner the
artist has transformed the com
monplace machine into a myth.
Man must decide whether the
overwhelming, dogmatic forces
of this machine and nuclear age
will determine his fate or wheth
er the poetry of the mind will
prevail. Clearly this allegorical
lover, with a blindman's cane,
is walking down that road.
Another contemporary artist,
Eugene lonesco, in his play,
The Motor Car depicts a sim
ilar confrontation between man
and things-of-his-creation. A
gentleman who has been shown
male and female cars "un vol
ture" and "une voiture" finally
falls in love with a blond female
car and decides to marry her.
It seems to me that to judge
art morally is very bourgeois
indeed.

A majority of German stu
dents will definitely concur with
Drew Pearson's | Thursday's
Daily] denouncing the use of
violence in the recent student
demonstrations in Germany. j
But with the rest of the ar
ticle the same majority simply
cannot go along. The essence of
this article is: Springer is pro-
American and consequently
right, Dutschke and his radicals
are anti-American, i.e. wrong.
The issues are not that sim
ple. Dutschke himself is far
from advocating violence, he is
not hating America, but hating
the policy of the current U.S.
Administration — and I have
been told that there are even in
this country a few who share
this view.
To call Springer the backbone
of German democracy is a slap
in the face for everybody who
has watched Springer's per
formance during the last ten
years, who thinks that a cold
war attitude is outdated, and
who wants to ease the tension
between East and West.
GERNOT REINERS
Teaching Fellow, Law School
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford Art Department
has long displayed a consistent
ly hypocritical attitude toward
studio art and creative expres
sion in the University commu
nity.
By continually sponsoring to
ken art shows and operating a
token studio art program, the
Art Department has managed to
maintain the image of foster
ing creative work, which it has
done only to an appallingly lim
ited extent. Three out of thou
sands of examples display the
superficial nature of the Uni
versity's commitment to crea
tive art:
1. Having received a generous
donation for the construction of
a new art building, the Art De
partment is proceeding to build
a structure with an architectu
ral quality similar to that of the
Undergraduate Library, com
monly called "The UGLY." A
chance to demonstrate commit
ment to creative architecture
was avoided.
2. Last week a Stanford grad
uate student's exhibit in the Old
Union was removed because it
was deemed "vile" and "sordid"
by the occupants of the build
ing. The Art Department
claimed that it was "not in
volved" with the exhibit.
Through silence it has condoned
popular opinion of the exhibit
and has aided in reinforcing the
public's belief that Michel
Barnes, the artist, is a mere
publicity seeker of dubious ar
tistic merit. Apathy is not non
involvement. If the Art Depart
ment is interested in sponsoring
studio art, it must be ready to
defend students under attack
and insist upon the right for
valid works of art to be shown
in the University. . . .
3. Next year the Art Depart
ment will not find a replacement
for Assistant Prof. Robert Mul
len, its only full - time faculty
member in the field of sculp
ture. The Art Department there
by eliminates all but a few
sculpture courses in a process
destined to phase out one of the
most exciting and vital contem
porary art forms, as well as an
art form traditionally accepted
as significant. This is not an in
dication of true concern with
studio art.
We are making no specific
complaint against any specific
member of the Art Department.
We criticize the way in which
the Art Department has func
tioned in a University suppos
edly espousing truth, freedom,
etc. . . . But in order to main
tain some sort of integrity in
the University we recommend
that:
1. The studio division of the
department should be discontin
ued, as past actions have im
plied, or
2. That the department use
funds presently budgeted to
hire a sculpture professor for
the academic year 1968-69, with
the possibility of his acquiring

About Springer Press
Editor, The Daily:
A majority of German stu
dents will definitely concur with
Drew Pearson's | Thursday's
Daily] denouncing the use of
violence in the recent student
demonstrations in Germany. j
But with the rest of the ar
ticle the same majority simply
cannot go along. The essence of
this article is: Springer is pro-
American and consequently
right, Dutschke and his radicals
are anti-American, i.e. wrong.
The issues are not that sim
ple. Dutschke himself is far
from advocating violence, he is
not hating America, but hating
the policy of the current U.S.
Administration — and I have
been told that there are even in
this country a few who share
this view.
To call Springer the backbone
of German democracy is a slap
in the face for everybody who
has watched Springer's per
formance during the last ten
years, who thinks that a cold
war attitude is outdated, and
who wants to ease the tension
between East and West.
GERNOT REINERS
Teaching Fellow, Law School
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford Art Department
has long displayed a consistent
ly hypocritical attitude toward
studio art and creative expres
sion in the University commu
nity.
By continually sponsoring to
ken art shows and operating a
token studio art program, the
Art Department has managed to
maintain the image of foster
ing creative work, which it has
done only to an appallingly lim
ited extent. Three out of thou
sands of examples display the
superficial nature of the Uni
versity's commitment to crea
tive art:
1. Having received a generous
donation for the construction of
a new art building, the Art De
partment is proceeding to build
a structure with an architectu
ral quality similar to that of the
Undergraduate Library, com
monly called "The UGLY." A
chance to demonstrate commit
ment to creative architecture
was avoided.
2. Last week a Stanford grad
uate student's exhibit in the Old
Union was removed because it
was deemed "vile" and "sordid"
by the occupants of the build
ing. The Art Department
claimed that it was "not in
volved" with the exhibit.
Through silence it has condoned
popular opinion of the exhibit
and has aided in reinforcing the
public's belief that Michel
Barnes, the artist, is a mere
publicity seeker of dubious ar
tistic merit. Apathy is not non
involvement. If the Art Depart
ment is interested in sponsoring
studio art, it must be ready to
defend students under attack
and insist upon the right for
valid works of art to be shown
in the University. . . .
3. Next year the Art Depart
ment will not find a replacement
for Assistant Prof. Robert Mul
len, its only full - time faculty
member in the field of sculp
ture. The Art Department there
by eliminates all but a few
sculpture courses in a process
destined to phase out one of the
most exciting and vital contem
porary art forms, as well as an
art form traditionally accepted
as significant. This is not an in
dication of true concern with
studio art.
We are making no specific
complaint against any specific
member of the Art Department.
We criticize the way in which
the Art Department has func
tioned in a University suppos
edly espousing truth, freedom,
etc. . . . But in order to main
tain some sort of integrity in
the University we recommend
that:
1. The studio division of the
department should be discontin
ued, as past actions have im
plied, or
2. That the department use
funds presently budgeted to
hire a sculpture professor for
the academic year 1968-69, with
the possibility of his acquiring
tenure if found acceptable.
3. That the Art Department
discontinue its policy of non
involvement in Barnes' exhibit
in the Old Union.
4. That the Art Department,
by reallocation of funds and re
ordering of priorities, show that
it has an honest intention to
support studio art.

Banned Art Exhibit
Had Profound Vision
Editor, The Daily:
I was embarrassed to learn
that Michael Barnes' recent ex
hibit in the Old Union has been
cancelled.
Mr. Barnes' vision Is pro
foundly modern. His finest paint
ing, "Woman walking Lover"
(I.e. vacuum cleaner) Is a mirror
of our times.
In a blunt, dadaist manner the
artist has transformed the com
monplace machine into a myth.
Man must decide whether the
overwhelming, dogmatic forces
of this machine and nuclear age
will determine his fate or wheth
er the poetry of the mind will
prevail. Clearly this allegorical
lover, with a blindman's cane,
is walking down that road.
Another contemporary artist,
Eugene lonesco, in his play,
The Motor Car depicts a sim
ilar confrontation between man
and things-of-his-creation. A
gentleman who has been shown
male and female cars "un vol
ture" and "une voiture" finally
falls in love with a blond female
car and decides to marry her.
It seems to me that to judge
art morally is very bourgeois
indeed.

Union was removed because it
was deemed "vile" and "sordid"
by the occupants of the build
ing. The Art Department
claimed that it was "not in
volved" with the exhibit.
Through silence it has condoned
popular opinion of the exhibit
and has aided in reinforcing the
public's belief that Michel
Barnes, the artist, is a mere
publicity seeker of dubious ar
tistic merit. Apathy is not non
involvement. If the Art Depart
ment is interested in sponsoring
studio art, it must be ready to
defend students under attack
and insist upon the right for
valid works of art to be shown
in the University. . . .
3. Next year the Art Depart
ment will not find a replacement
for Assistant Prof. Robert Mul
len, its only full - time faculty
member in the field of sculp
ture. The Art Department there
by eliminates all but a few
sculpture courses in a process
destined to phase out one of the
most exciting and vital contem
porary art forms, as well as an
art form traditionally accepted
as significant. This is not an in
dication of true concern with
studio art.
We are making no specific
complaint against any specific
member of the Art Department.
We criticize the way in which
the Art Department has func
tioned in a University suppos
edly espousing truth, freedom,
etc. . . . But in order to main
tain some sort of integrity in
the University we recommend
that:
1. The studio division of the
department should be discontin
ued, as past actions have im
plied, or
2. That the department use
funds presently budgeted to
hire a sculpture professor for
the academic year 1968-69, with
the possibility of his acquiring
tenure if found acceptable.
3. That the Art Department
discontinue its policy of non
involvement in Barnes' exhibit
in the Old Union.
4. That the Art Department,
by reallocation of funds and re
ordering of priorities, show that
it has an honest intention to
support studio art.

Banned Art Exhibit
Had Profound Vision
Editor, The Daily:
I was embarrassed to learn
that Michael Barnes' recent ex
hibit in the Old Union has been
cancelled.
Mr. Barnes' vision Is pro
foundly modern. His finest paint
ing, "Woman walking Lover"
(I.e. vacuum cleaner) Is a mirror
of our times.
In a blunt, dadaist manner the
artist has transformed the com
monplace machine into a myth.
Man must decide whether the
overwhelming, dogmatic forces
of this machine and nuclear age
will determine his fate or wheth
er the poetry of the mind will
prevail. Clearly this allegorical
lover, with a blindman's cane,
is walking down that road.
Another contemporary artist,
Eugene lonesco, in his play,
The Motor Car depicts a sim
ilar confrontation between man
and things-of-his-creation. A
gentleman who has been shown
male and female cars "un vol
ture" and "une voiture" finally
falls in love with a blond female
car and decides to marry her.
It seems to me that to judge
art morally is very bourgeois
indeed.

About Springer Press
Editor, The Daily:
A majority of German stu
dents will definitely concur with
Drew Pearson's | Thursday's
Daily] denouncing the use of
violence in the recent student
demonstrations in Germany. j
But with the rest of the ar
ticle the same majority simply
cannot go along. The essence of
this article is: Springer is pro-
American and consequently
right, Dutschke and his radicals
are anti-American, i.e. wrong.
The issues are not that sim
ple. Dutschke himself is far
from advocating violence, he is
not hating America, but hating
the policy of the current U.S.
Administration — and I have
been told that there are even in
this country a few who share
this view.
To call Springer the backbone
of German democracy is a slap
in the face for everybody who
has watched Springer's per
formance during the last ten
years, who thinks that a cold
war attitude is outdated, and
who wants to ease the tension
between East and West.

The Stanford Art Department
has long displayed a consistent
ly hypocritical attitude toward
studio art and creative expres
sion in the University commu
nity.
By continually sponsoring to
ken art shows and operating a
token studio art program, the
Art Department has managed to
maintain the image of foster
ing creative work, which it has
done only to an appallingly lim
ited extent. Three out of thou
sands of examples display the
superficial nature of the Uni
versity's commitment to crea
tive art:
1. Having received a generous
donation for the construction of
a new art building, the Art De
partment is proceeding to build
a structure with an architectu
ral quality similar to that of the
Undergraduate Library, com
monly called "The UGLY." A
chance to demonstrate commit
ment to creative architecture
was avoided.
2. Last week a Stanford grad
uate student's exhibit in the Old
Union was removed because it
was deemed "vile" and "sordid"
by the occupants of the build
ing. The Art Department
claimed that it was "not in
