## Inspector General Ends SRT Year 
### TOM STOCKFISCH 
As the final offering of its
third season, Stanford Repertory
Theater is presenting Nikolai
Gogol's The Inspector General.
Dating back to 1835, the play is
an unduly long presentation of
a trivial and not particularly
amusing instance of mistaken
identity.
Set in a provincial Russian
town, The Inspector General fea
tures an array of prominently
placed local yokels who suppose
a visiting deadbeat to be a gov
ernment inspector whom they
have heard is coming to their
burg. The visitor indulges him
self in the unexpected hospitali
ty of the townspeople, accrues a
heap of rubles in bribes, and se
cures a promise of the Mayor's
daughter's hand in marriage be
fore beating a hasty retreat. The
townspeople discover their mis
take, and an announcement of
the arrival of a genuine inspec
tor ends the play.
Today it is virtually Impos
sible to view the play, as Go

gol did, as an Indictment of
injustice. The depth of char
acterization could ; be mea
sured with a micrometer. The
characters undergo little or no
change and the playwright's
Incessant display of them and
their petty faults seems tauto
logical in the extreme.
SRT's production, which en
dures for three-and-a-half hours
with a single ten-minute inter
mission, visually seeks to
achieve a cartoon-like presenta
tion of much of the action. Some
of Douglas Russell's costumes
are boldly colored and padded
about the middle, creating an
Alice in Wonderland atmos
phere, complete with Bochinsky
and Dobchinsky, balooning
Tweedlededum and Tweedlede
dees.
When the manifold asides are
delivered, all characters but the
speaker freeze in position, mak
ing asides more plausible within
the confines of the stage and
adding to the comic strip effect.
These exaggerations aid in mak

ing the play more palatable, but
the need for them is a telling
comment on the play's level of
sophistication.
The speeches of the mayor
and Khestakov, the inspector,
are at timet* interminable. As
the mayor, Paul E. Richards
markets much the same hys
teria he gave us earlier this
season In Chekov's The Boor.

Joseph Medalls is uneven as
Khestakov. At times he seems
to be shooting In all directions
and aiming at none.
Among the panoply of gro
tesques who surround the lead
characters, Carrillo Gantner
turns in an impressive and sen
sitive performance as a fright
ened, twitchy, cadaver-like su
perintendent of schools.

Director Douglas Johnson, an
M.F.A. student, would have done
well to abridge the script. The
Inspector General is a play In
which a good number of quite
unthinking people think aloud.
But Gogol appears to lack the
Chekhovian restraint which can
point up the significance of such
a phenomenon.
