# Taylor To Perform In Dink Tomorrow
## 
### 
Cecil Taylor and his jazz unit
will play tomorrow at 8 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel in a concert which
ASSU president Cesare Massa
renti calls "a very special
thing."
The concert, with tickets $1
for students and $2 for the gen
eral public, will be a continua
tion of Taylor's attempt to ex
pose Stanford students to black
culture and the contributions of

the black community to Ameri
can culture.
Massarenti says Taylor, who
was born in a middle-class fam
ily in New York City, is one of
the few true practitioners of the
jazz tradition of Duke Elling
ton. Taylor and his group have
come to Stanford to bring con
temporary jazz art to students
in a relaxed atmosphere.
The group has been playing
in student residences and talk
ing to students about their
work.
Massarenti hopes that pro
grams like this will be just the
beginning of involvement of the
universities with black artists.
He says Taylor, realizing this,
has come to Stanford for much
less than many other name ar
tists would consider.
"I believe that until the white
community realizes the histori
cal importance of the art of the
black cc%nmunity in this coun
try, there will be no integra
tion," Massarenti said.
Taylor will be on campus with
his group through May 4, but
the Saturday concert is the last
large concert he will give during
his stay.
