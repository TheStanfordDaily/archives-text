Along with television reruns
we are seeing the rerun of some
very good films, although in du
bious company. Kinff of Hearts,
a lyrical anti - war anti - society
film by deßroca, starring Alan
Bates, is showing at the Stan
ford with Planet of the Apes.
However, this verion of Hearts
is dubbed, so wait for the re
turn of the original. The Pent
house, which was around for
only a week last quarter, is back
at the Paris, with Poor Cow
(Terrance Stamp). The film is
an outstanding example of
translating the theatre of the
absurd into a film form, and
well worth seeing even though
it didn't win any awards.
Friday evening Tresidder is
showing Bunuel's Viridiana,
made in Spain in 1961. The mov
ie probes the breakdown of mor
ality, and seeks to demonstrate
man's inhumanity to his fellow
man after superficial kindness
has been stripped away. Satur
day Madera House (Wilbur
Hall) is presenting To Die in
Madrid, a documentary of the
Spanish Civil War. The film,
shown at 8 and 10, is outstand
ing, and if you are going to
any movies this weekend this
one should be included.
Several other films in the area
worth mentioning: Ulysses at
the Saratoga, The Battle of Al
giers at the Richelieu (In S.F.)
and Persona by Bergman, at the
Gateway also in San Francisco.
