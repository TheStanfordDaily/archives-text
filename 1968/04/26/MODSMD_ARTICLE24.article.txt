### 
The Stanford rifle team
closed its season yesterday on
a disappointing note, losing to
league-champion San Jose State
by the extremely close score of
1415-1417.
Led by Sue Bailey's (288),
John Hayes (287), Jim Jenkins
(282), Paul Holley (279), and
Ray Baxter (279) followed to
fill out the Stanford team.
Sue Meeks (288) was San
Jose State's top scorer.
In other action this week, the
Stanford squad defeated USF
by a whopping 91 points, 1424
to 1333, in a postal meet.
The team's final 5-5 record
includes single wins over Santa
Clara, Davis, Berkeley, and a
pair of victories over USF. Not
included in the final league
standings are second-place
team finishes in the Stanford
and UC sectionals.
