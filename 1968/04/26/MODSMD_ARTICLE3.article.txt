# Nondiscrimination Proposal
## IFC Action Delayed 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
The Inter-Fraternity Council
(IFC) failed for the second con
secutive week to agree on a
resolution reaffirming nondis
crimination in Stanford frater
nities, last night. But Mike
Quinn, IFC president, says that
final action can be expected
next Thursday.
The problem in passing a res
olution, Quinn says, is incor
porating the various ideas put
forth by different fraternities
into one plan which the entire
IFC can approve.
Quinn said the Council "ap
proved in essence" the idea of
reaffirming nondiscrimination,
but the task of determining ex
act proposals and plans was
left to a committee.
This group met immediat
ely after last night's full IFC
meeting, and will present its
results to the Council next
week. Quinn, who is a mem
ber of Delta Upsilon, declined

to reveal details of action In
the IFC or the committee,
saying it was premature to
announce anything: before the
IFC considered the resolu
tion.
"It's hard to get 45 people
to agree on one thing," he said.
"We're not trying to cover up
anything. We just want to wait
until the IFC votes on it."
Quinn noted that two of the
major proposals which have to
be considered by the committee
are those from Alpha Sigma
Phi and Kappa Sigma.
Alpha Sig has suggested that
the fraternities demand that
their nationals denounce dis
crimination. The Kappa Sig
plan includes inviting minor
ity group students to fill vac
ancies which presently exist in
the houses.
The Alpha Sig plan came out
of a suggestion from Prof.
David Ab?rnethy at the All-
Campus Colloquium in Memor
ial Auditorium April 8.

The resolution which the IFC
committee, headed by Quinn, is
supposed to produce consists of
"a statement of intent and de
tailed proposals," according to
Beta Chi Tom Amis, another
committee member.
The committee will meet
again before next Thursday's
session, and will present its
plan to all houses in time for
consideration before the meet
ing:.
Amis said that the Alpha
Sig and Kappa Sig proposals,
along with several others,
will "serve as examples and
guidelines" in the commit
tee's preparation of "the
IFC's main resolution."
Like Quinn, Amis declined to
discuss any plans undor consid
eration except those already
known.
"Almost everything involved
is interconnected," he said,
"and the revealing of any one
part of these things would jeop
ardize certain things."
Next Thursday's meeting
will be held at the DU house
at 7:30.
Other IFC actions following
the death of Dr. Martin Luther
King include pledging $1,000,
$300 from the IFC operating
budget and $700 from the indi
vidual fraternities, and a bene
fit party last weekend sponsored
by Phi Delta Theta.


THE BLACK ARTS — Play
wrlght-poet Le R«i Jones and
singer - composer Oscar Brown
Jr. will present an "experience
in drama, music and poetic
readings" at Stanford next
Monday at 4:15 in Memorial
Auditorium. Jones and Brown
will be participating in the
Afro-American folk-art festival
sponsored by the Black Stu
dent Union. Oscar Brown Jr.
has made numerous recordings
in the past ten years as a
singer with his own band. Ken
ny Washington, co-chairman of
the Black Student Union has
described Brown's style as
"modern urban blues." Jones
was to have spoken at Stan
ford in October but could not
meet the engagement due to
litigation resulting from his
alleged role in the Newark riots
last summer. His most recent
works include the play, "Dutch
man," and the books, "Black
Music, and Blues People."
