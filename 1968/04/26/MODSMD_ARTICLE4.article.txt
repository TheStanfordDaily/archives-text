# Open Houses Set For Sunday
## 
### 
University residences will hold
open houses from 6:30 to 10 this
Sunday night to acquaint stu
dents with alternative living sit
uations for next fall.
Choices include houses for
men and women from all four
classes, houses for upperclass
men and women, and 13 coedu
cational living groups.
Assistant Dean of Students
Sally Mahoney announced last
night additional plans for Uni
versity housing to be offered to
upperclassmen next autumn.
Previously unannounced plans
are for a co-operative house on
the Row. a coeducational Inter
national House in Lagunita, and
the opening of membership to
women in five of the seven eat
nig clubs.
An experiment in co-operative
living will be initiated in May
field House, formerly the ATO
house. Space is offered to 44 up
perclass males who want a liv
ing altenative in the draw to
include operating and manag
ing a residence themselves. The
group will be charged a lump
sum rate by the University.
Casa Adelfa in Lagunita will
house a new coeducational In
ternational House with the
theme "Population and Food
Supply." Residents will be both
American and foreign students
and include graduate students
as well as undergraduates. This
will be Stanford's second inter
national coeducational house;
the first was Otero House in
Wilbur, established last fall.
To complement the planned
coeducation set-up for Toyon
Hall which does not have a din
ing hall, five eating clubs are
offering membership to women
next fall quarter. Toyon resi
dents not wishing to join the
clubs may purchase meal tick
tes at Encina Commons.
The three coeducational theme
houses created last fall will for

the most part continue their
programs as before. Available
snares in Otero (international
relations), Soto (creativity), and
Serra (community servic°) will
bo filled through the draw.
Grove House, the first in the
integrated coeducational hous
ing program at Stanford, will
move from its present location
in Stern Hall to Hurlb"rt and
Stillman houses on the .Row.
Grove mnn will live in Hurlburt,
Grove women in Stillman, and
meals for the group will be
served in Hurlburt.
Roble Hall, presently housing
freshman women, will be open
next year to men and women in
all four classes.
