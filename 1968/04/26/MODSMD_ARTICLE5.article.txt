## Goldberg Resigns From U.N. 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —Presi
dent Johnson disclosed Thurs
day the long-anticipated resig
nation of Arthur J. Goldberg
as ambassador to the United
Nations and announced a sur
prise successor: former Under
secretary of State George W.
Ball.
Goldberg, a former labor law
yer who has held high federal
posts since the first day of the
John F. Kennedy administra
tion, had made no secret recent
ly of his desire to return to
private life.
Advance speculation about a
successor did not touch the 58-
year-old Ball, who resigned as
No. 2 man in the State Depart
ment nearly two years ago to
return to law practice.
Johnson, announcing the U.N.
shift at a brief news confer
ence in his office, described Ball
as a distinguished public ser
vant "who serves me unoffici
ally in many advisory capaci
ties at the present time."
When Ball left government
in 1966. he was widely regard
ed as more "dovish" on Viet
nam policy than Secretary of
State Dean Rusk.

demonstrators protesting plans

ransacked and took over the
office of the school president

The Columbia siege continued
Thursday with a classroom sit

50 sat on the floor outside the
locked door. Th" Brooklyn cam

more scholarships for Negroes,
more Negroes on the faculty,
courses on Negroe history and

• Peace Talks Co On
WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S.

But the fact that the North

Vientiane (the Laotian capital)

over for a 30-minut° chat was

that "in a very short time a

charged again in closed hear

that many corporations doing

defense contract work are mak

the Defense Department is both

He also charged that profits
reported by defense contractors

Riekover testified that he had

MOSCOW fAP)—'The Soviet
Union Thursday announced
launching of a new Cosmos in
terms that might mean it was
the first test of an orbital bomb
system since the United States
declared this country seemed to

Robert S. McNamara, then

closed the suspicions about a
Soviet orbital bomb system at
a Washington news conference

into a low orbit, from which it
would be dropped on its target
before the earth had been cir

Diplomatic sources here said
afterward the Soviet Union was
believed to be using its Cosmos
space program as a cover for

MOSCOW fAP)—'The Soviet
Union Thursday announced
launching of a new Cosmos in
terms that might mean it was
the first test of an orbital bomb
system since the United States
declared this country seemed to
be developing such a weapon.
Robert S. McNamara, then
U.S. secretary of defense, dis
closed the suspicions about a
Soviet orbital bomb system at
a Washington news conference
Nov. 3. He said it could become
combat-ready in 19G8.
As described by McNamara,
the system would consist of
a nuclear warhead launched
into a low orbit, from which it
would be dropped on its target
before the earth had been cir
cled once.
Diplomatic sources here said
afterward the Soviet Union was
believed to be using its Cosmos
space program as a cover for
testing the system.

as ambassador to the United

Goldberg, a former labor law

When Ball left government

• Peace Talks Co On
WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S.
and North Vietnamese repre
sentatives met again Thursday
in Laos without coming to
agreement on a site for prelim
inary peace talks.
But the fact that the North
Vietnamese charge d'affaires in
Vientiane (the Laotian capital)
invited the U.S. ambassador
over for a 30-minut° chat was
seen here as a possibly hopeful
s'gn of Communist interest in
breaking the deadlock.
Vice President Hubert H.
Humphrey predicted Thursday
that "in a very short time a
place will be agreed upon for
the preliminary talks."
State Department press offi
cer Robert J. McCloskey con
firmed an Associated Press re

WASHINGTON (AP) Vice
Adm. Hyman G. Rickover has
charged again in closed hear
ings before a House committee
that many corporations doing

defense contract work are mak
ing excessive profits and that
the Defense Department is both
unwilling and unable to stop it.

reported by defense contractors
are often substantially lower

that excessive profits are hid

Riekover testified that he had
warned as early as 1963 "that

Church doctrine in the modern
world.
The Roman Catholic Church

• I\eiv USSR Satellite
MOSCOW fAP)—'The Soviet
Union Thursday announced
launching of a new Cosmos in
terms that might mean it was
the first test of an orbital bomb
system since the United States
declared this country seemed to
be developing such a weapon.
Robert S. McNamara, then
U.S. secretary of defense, dis
closed the suspicions about a
Soviet orbital bomb system at
a Washington news conference
Nov. 3. He said it could become
combat-ready in 19G8.
As described by McNamara,
the system would consist of
a nuclear warhead launched
into a low orbit, from which it
would be dropped on its target
before the earth had been cir
cled once.
Diplomatic sources here said
afterward the Soviet Union was
believed to be using its Cosmos
space program as a cover for
testing the system.
