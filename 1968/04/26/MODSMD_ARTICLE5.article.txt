## Goldberg Resigns From U.N. 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —Presi
dent Johnson disclosed Thurs
day the long-anticipated resig
nation of Arthur J. Goldberg
as ambassador to the United
Nations and announced a sur
prise successor: former Under
secretary of State George W.
Ball.
Goldberg, a former labor law
yer who has held high federal
posts since the first day of the
John F. Kennedy administra
tion, had made no secret recent
ly of his desire to return to
private life.
Advance speculation about a
successor did not touch the 58-
year-old Ball, who resigned as
No. 2 man in the State Depart
ment nearly two years ago to
return to law practice.
Johnson, announcing the U.N.
shift at a brief news confer
ence in his office, described Ball
as a distinguished public ser
vant "who serves me unoffici
ally in many advisory capaci
ties at the present time."
When Ball left government
in 1966. he was widely regard
ed as more "dovish" on Viet
nam policy than Secretary of
State Dean Rusk.

• Peace Talks Co On
WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S.
and North Vietnamese repre
sentatives met again Thursday
in Laos without coming to
agreement on a site for prelim
inary peace talks.
But the fact that the North
Vietnamese charge d'affaires in
Vientiane (the Laotian capital)
invited the U.S. ambassador
over for a 30-minut° chat was
seen here as a possibly hopeful
s'gn of Communist interest in
breaking the deadlock.
Vice President Hubert H.
Humphrey predicted Thursday
that "in a very short time a
place will be agreed upon for
the preliminary talks."
State Department press offi
cer Robert J. McCloskey con
firmed an Associated Press re

man added that "there is no
agreement yet on the site," and

Riekover testified that he had
warned as early as 1963 "that
the government needed addi

profits on complicated equip

one of his strongest attacks on
extremism in the renewal of the
Church, Pope Paul VI Thursday
reaffirmed the immutability of
Church doctrine in the modern
world.
The Roman Catholic Church
is experiencing "a great and
magnificent reawakening," he
told an overflow general audi

"But the Church also suffered
