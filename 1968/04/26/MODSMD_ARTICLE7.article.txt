The Warren Court is "the
most activist" Supreme Court
in American history and has
performed daringly but suc
cessfully, Prof. Robert MeClos
key, an authority on Constitu
tional law, said last night.
Prof. McCloskey of Harvard
University spoke on "The War
ren Court in Perspective" in
the Lectures in American Dem
ocracy series. He is a guest of
the Political Science Depart
ment.

But, he said, the Supreme
Court merits only two cheers,
not three, because it has failed
in one of its three classic func
tions.
The "nine men in a marble
palace" have failed as legal
craftsmen, he said. The court
has failed to provide the ra
tional link between the pro
nouncements of today and con
stitutional tradition.
"It has lacked the will or
the capacity or both to supply
reasoned arguments to buttress
its ventures into the frontiers
of jurisprudence," said Mc-
Closkey.
The other two functions are
moral and administrative. The
court must be a moral pre
ceptor of national political mor
ality. It must also enunciate
administrative guidelines for
the uses of power.
"It is not easy to think of a
doctrinal milestone, among the
many the Warren court has
handed down, which is attended
by an opinion worthy of its
significance," he said.
A case in point is the de
segregation ruling of 1954,
Brown vs. the Board of Educa
tion. McCloskey said Chief Jus
tice Warren's opinion "offered
a sound moral precept, but it
advanced that precept in an
opinion that was calculated to
command assent only from
those who already assented."
Although the Warren Court
has "performed badly" in one
respect, its overall perform
ance has been admirable, said
McCloskey.
"It is an initiative producing
agency." It has often shoved
America instead of restrain
ing it."he said.
It has been a significant emo
tional force in the civil right
revolution. Its rulings have pre
cipitated a liberation of art,
and a marked change in police
proceedings, among other
things, he added.
"To risk an analogy, the War
ren Court is to Supreme Courts
of the past as Alexander the
Great was to Philip of Mace
donia," said McCloskey.

Brown vs. the Board of Educa
tion. McCloskey said Chief Jus
tice Warren's opinion "offered
a sound moral precept, but it
advanced that precept in an
opinion that was calculated to
command assent only from
those who already assented."
Although the Warren Court
has "performed badly" in one
respect, its overall perform
ance has been admirable, said
McCloskey.
"It is an initiative producing
agency." It has often shoved
America instead of restrain
ing it."he said.
It has been a significant emo
tional force in the civil right
revolution. Its rulings have pre
cipitated a liberation of art,
and a marked change in police
proceedings, among other
things, he added.
"To risk an analogy, the War
ren Court is to Supreme Courts
of the past as Alexander the
Great was to Philip of Mace
donia," said McCloskey.
The Warren Court is "the
most activist" Supreme Court
in American history and has
performed daringly but suc
cessfully, Prof. Robert MeClos
key, an authority on Constitu
tional law, said last night.
Prof. McCloskey of Harvard
University spoke on "The War
ren Court in Perspective" in
the Lectures in American Dem
ocracy series. He is a guest of
the Political Science Depart
ment.

But, he said, the Supreme
Court merits only two cheers,
not three, because it has failed
in one of its three classic func
tions.
The "nine men in a marble
palace" have failed as legal
craftsmen, he said. The court
has failed to provide the ra
tional link between the pro
nouncements of today and con
stitutional tradition.
"It has lacked the will or
the capacity or both to supply
reasoned arguments to buttress
its ventures into the frontiers
of jurisprudence," said Mc-
Closkey.
The other two functions are
moral and administrative. The
court must be a moral pre
ceptor of national political mor
ality. It must also enunciate
administrative guidelines for
the uses of power.
"It is not easy to think of a
doctrinal milestone, among the
many the Warren court has
handed down, which is attended
by an opinion worthy of its
significance," he said.
A case in point is the de
segregation ruling of 1954,
Brown vs. the Board of Educa
tion. McCloskey said Chief Jus
tice Warren's opinion "offered
a sound moral precept, but it
advanced that precept in an
opinion that was calculated to
command assent only from
those who already assented."
Although the Warren Court
has "performed badly" in one
