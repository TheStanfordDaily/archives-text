## Chuck Taylor Responds To Jordan Article 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Within the last week untruth
ful statements have been made
by Mr. Harry Edwards, and a
purported story in Ramparts,
which were reported in The
Daily. Normally the Depart
ment of Physical Education and
Athletics does not attempt to re
spond to statements that have
not been researched, and may
be opinions only of he writer.
However, in this case there ap
pars to be an attempt to slander
the character of Mr. Payton Jor
dan by irresponsible individuals
who have not taken the time to
gather facts. It is possible these
statements are an attempt to
secure support of the proposed
Olympic boycott by attacking
Mr. Jordan, the selected Coach
of the Olympic Track and Field
Team.
In all the years that Coach
Jordan has been at Stanford, I
have never heard him refer neg
atively about ANY black stu
dent - athlete, and emphatically
believe the same of every coach
in this Department. The track
team has had black students on
the roster in the past and at
present, and will continue to
have in the future. Some have
had athletic grants. The athletic
grants made available to the
track program are awarded, as
in all sports, to those athletes
(black or white) who qualify
for admission, are outstanding
competitors, and who in most
cases are in need of assistance
to attend Stanford. Ramparts, I
gather, conveniently neglected
to mention there are no black
students participating in eight
or nine of our other sports.
Does this then make each of
these coaches discriminatory?
Athletically, what recruiting
is done and what grants are
available, are recommended for
the best scholar athletes that
can qualify, and are admissible
to the University be they white
or black.
At present there are 14 black
athletes representing football
and basketball at Stanford, nine
of whom are receiving athletic
Grants-in-Aid help, amounting
to over $20,000 a yerr, all from
contributed funds. The others
may be receiving academic
scholarship aid. Two of the
black athletes are also partici
pating on the track team and
doing an excellent job. In years
past other black student athletes
have participated in the track
program . . . Harry McCalla and
Dale Rubin.

Each of eight athletic sports
at Stanford has a limited num
ber of Grants-in-Aid available.
There is no question in my mind
but what the recruiting efforts
and grant awards have been,
and will continue to be, entered
into and made without consider
ation of black or white, but on
the basis of ability, character,
and admissibility, as is the case
of the University in general.
Mr. Jordan has a long history
of participation with both blacks
and whites on the college level,
the national level, and in inter
national competiton. He is a
man of integrity and dedication
to his sport, as well as to his
athletes. . . .

program . . . Harry McCalla and
Dale Rubin.

Each of eight athletic sports
at Stanford has a limited num
ber of Grants-in-Aid available.
There is no question in my mind
but what the recruiting efforts
and grant awards have been,
and will continue to be, entered
into and made without consider
ation of black or white, but on
the basis of ability, character,
and admissibility, as is the case
of the University in general.
Mr. Jordan has a long history
of participation with both blacks
and whites on the college level,
the national level, and in inter
national competiton. He is a
man of integrity and dedication
to his sport, as well as to his
athletes. . . .
CHARLES A. TAYLOR

Editor, The Daily:
Within the last week untruth
ful statements have been made
by Mr. Harry Edwards, and a
purported story in Ramparts,
which were reported in The
Daily. Normally the Depart
ment of Physical Education and
Athletics does not attempt to re
spond to statements that have
not been researched, and may
be opinions only of he writer.
However, in this case there ap
pars to be an attempt to slander
the character of Mr. Payton Jor
dan by irresponsible individuals
who have not taken the time to
gather facts. It is possible these
statements are an attempt to
secure support of the proposed
Olympic boycott by attacking
Mr. Jordan, the selected Coach
of the Olympic Track and Field
Team.
In all the years that Coach
Jordan has been at Stanford, I
have never heard him refer neg
atively about ANY black stu
dent - athlete, and emphatically
believe the same of every coach
in this Department. The track
team has had black students on
the roster in the past and at
present, and will continue to
have in the future. Some have
had athletic grants. The athletic
grants made available to the
track program are awarded, as
in all sports, to those athletes
(black or white) who qualify
for admission, are outstanding
competitors, and who in most
cases are in need of assistance
to attend Stanford. Ramparts, I
gather, conveniently neglected
to mention there are no black
students participating in eight
or nine of our other sports.
Does this then make each of
these coaches discriminatory?
Athletically, what recruiting
is done and what grants are
available, are recommended for
the best scholar athletes that
can qualify, and are admissible
to the University be they white
or black.
At present there are 14 black
athletes representing football
and basketball at Stanford, nine
of whom are receiving athletic
Grants-in-Aid help, amounting
to over $20,000 a yerr, all from
contributed funds. The others
may be receiving academic
scholarship aid. Two of the
black athletes are also partici
pating on the track team and
doing an excellent job. In years
past other black student athletes
have participated in the track
program . . . Harry McCalla and
Dale Rubin.
