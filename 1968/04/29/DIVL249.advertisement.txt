Why A Gant
Shirt?
Because a Gant shirt is more than some
thing to hang a tie on. It's a stimulant to
make you feel good, look good throughout
the day.
Because a Gant shirt—from its softly flared
button-down collar to its trim Hugger body
—is tailored with singular precision.
Because the fabrics in Gant shirts have
elan in a gentlemanly manner; are exclusive
and wear superbly.
This is why we carry a complete selection of
Gant shirts. It's also why men of impec
cable taste come to us for Gant.
