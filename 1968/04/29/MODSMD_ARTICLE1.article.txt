# Oregon Students To Help Choose President
## Commentary 
### DIABMUID McGUIRE 
After three days of sit-ins and demonstra
tions, students at the University of Oregon
were granted equal representation last
Wednesday on a committee appointed to seek
a replacement for retiring President Arthur
S. Flemming.
Like Stanford, Oregon is seeking a succes
sor for an administrator who spearheaded a
period of educational expansion.
The leaders of the Oregon campaign for a
student voice in the selection of a new presi
dent stated their aims last Monday with a

letter to the Oregon Daily Emerald. They said:
"The president sets the tone and mood of the
University .... it is vital that students be
involved in the choice of the man who will
direct the university community in the fu
ture."
In announcing that he had granted the
student's demands, the Chancellor of the

State Board of Higher Education, Roy
Lieuallan, called this development "part of a
desirable and inevitable trend toward com
munity government" in education systems.
According to former Emerald editor Mike
Fancher, the idea behind community govern
ment is that students, faculty and the admin
istration should all be represented in the de
cisionmaking process.
In keeping with this principle, the Oregon
Presidential Search Committee will consist of
three representatives from each of these
groups. Provisions have been made to main
tain the same proportion if the committee is
expanded.
Fancher said in a telephone interview with
the Daily yesterday that the committee's
makeup represents "a great victory" for Ore
gon students. The fact that Chancellor Lieu
alien has approved publicly the principle of
community government Fancher said, means
that students can now press for a greater
voice in other university affairs.
In many respects, the Oregon situation
is closely paralleled at Stanford. Trustee
and faculty committees here have been
searching: for a successor to President J. E.
Wallace Sterling since January, 1967, when

he told the trustees that he wished to retire.
Sterling asked the trustees to find his re
placement as soon as possible, but in any
case before September, 1968.
But, unlike Oregon, Stanford does not ap
pear to be moving toward student representa
tion in the selection process. Trustees and
faculty involved in the presidential search
have resisted inquiries about their activities.
An invitation to students to participate in the
selection process does not seem imminent.
In response to an inquiry from Daily editor
Michael Sweeney, Roger Lewis, head of the
trustee's selection committee, said, "The plain
facts are that I do not think the selection of
a President is a matter for discussion outside
the faculty and the special committees at this
stage."
There are two Issues involved in the presi
dential search. One is the matter of disclos
ure of the names of prospective candidates.
The Oregon students agreed that such pub
licity might hinder their chances of getting
the best possible president.
The proceedings of the Presidential Search
Committee will take place behind closed doors,
even though there are students in the group.
"Students can keep their mouths shut as

well as anyone else," said Fancher. "They have
the best interests of the University in mind."
A more controversial Issue is the question
of whether students should have votes In
the selection of a president, and in univers
ity policy in general. "What's at stake here
is the role of students in the university com
munity," Fancher said.
It was on this issue that Oregon students
proved to be adamant last week. Lead by
Fancher and student body presidential candi
date Dick Jones, they occupied Johnson Hall,
a university administration building, last Sat
urday night.
At first about 50 students participated in the
movement but their numbers grew to 300 by
Wednesday. On Wednesday they also sat in at
the university business office. Within a few
days 4000 students signed a petition support
ing the group's demands.
On Monday Chancellor Lieuallen offered to
give t.ie students three seats on the search
committee while reserving eight for the fac
ulty. Scott Farleigh, outgoing president of the
Associated Students of the University of Ore
gon accepted this plan.
The Daily Emerald, however, said in an edi

torial that Farleigh had sold out, and de
manded equal representation on the commit
tee. The sit-in continued.
Speaking to students assembled at John
son Hall on Tu<*sday morning, one of the
leaders of the vigil, I-arry Moore said that,
"Although the issue here is to gain equal
representation In the selection of a new
president, the deeper Issue Is whether stu
dents are going to be treated as human
beings..
Finally on Wednesday morning, Lieuallen
met with a group of student leaders and
agreed to a committee divided equally between
students, faculty and administrators. Admin
istrators were defined as deans and depart
ment heads or those with higher offices.
The student members of the body will have
the power to make recommendations and, if
necessary, submit minority reports. In the case
of a vote, Fancher said, he hoped that the
students could form a coalition with "liberal"
members of the faculty.
The students are also going to set up a sep
arate search committee, which they hope will
add weight to the recommendations of the
students on the joint committee.
