## 'Expand And Build' Through CRE 
### 
(Two CRE members, Bobbie
Arm Blrloffi and Mac Thornton,
wrote this column on "CRE: A
New Kind of Student Activism"
as a reply to recent columns and
an editorial in the DAILY.)
The Community for Relevant
Education at Stanford is con
cerned about personal growth
and is involved in a new kind
of education—personal educa
tion. Stanford has received wide
acclaim for consistently manu
facturing brilliant scientists and
philosophers; however, like
many universities today, it has

neglected to keep up with and
contribute to the emotional and
social maturation of each stu
dent.
In attempting to fill this gap
for a more complete education,
CRE has developed a commun
ity in which individuals partici
pate in small "relevance"
groups. Relevance groups pro
vide a degree of introspection
and open exchange with others
which some find very helpful in
the maturation process.
After considerable group ex
perience, students who are will
ing take on leadership of such
a group, and work with an ex
perienced adult husband and
wife team. Last weekend, CRE
hosted 250 students from Stan
ford and surrounding Bay Area
schools for a three-day con
ference. Twenty-five male-female
teams of Stanford students led
relevance groups over a two
day period.
The relevance groups are part
of a larger philosophy and pur
pose shared by the individuals
in this community. CRE be
came "action-oriented" as a re
sult of the increased awareness
and motivation of the students.
The experience doesn't end in
the small group. Students are
encouraged, but certainly not
forced, to become involved in
some project which best utilizes
their talents. For example, at
the CRE conference, Andy Horo
witz, Stanford '68, spoke to the
group, encouraging students to
participate in the mid-peninsula
Community Information Pro
ject, in which students will be
trained to speak to white com

munities about white racism.
Students who have participated
in relevance groups will be par
ticularly useful in this area,
since they have had experience
in personal interaction.
CRE also presented National
Service as a positive way to
introduce change within individ
uals and within social institu
tions. Before clarifying some of
the misconceptions that have
grown up around National Ser
vice, the philosophy of this
method of social change must
be understood.
CRE does not support the
status quo. However, we do feel
that in order to change institu
tions we must begin from where
we are and work within them.
Because we are working within
institutions does not mean we
are bound by them or that we
are supporting them. The idea
is to approach change through
people, on an individual and
group basis.
CRE and the New Left agree
that institutions in our society
need to be changed to give more
freedom to the individual. CRE,
however, feels that non-compli
ance and protest, although im
portant, are not enough as ways
of lasting ways of social change.
Rather than destroy what we've
got, we can expand and build
constructively to bring about
change.
CRE sees a flexible National
Service program as such a
means of peaceful change. Na
tional Service would involve two
years of social service and would
be operated initially in conjunc
tion with the Selective Service,
and later would evolve as a sep
arate entity. In the beginning,
National Service would intro
duce an element of voluntari
ness into the entire draft. At
age 18, or later, depending upon
student and other deferments, a
man may . . make a choice
between civilian and military
service, or make no choice at
all." There would be, therefore,
three groups—those choosing
military service, National Ser
vice, and a third group of non
choosers. If military needs are
not met by volunteers, those
from the third group would be
conscripted first.
Hopefully, the introduction of
National Service would be
coupled with further efforts to
make military enlistment more

attractive, and thus have a
purely voluntary army with no
conscription. It is important to
note that National Service has
been started by private citizens,
and will remain a private Foun
dation. It would essentially
serve as a diversified clearing
house to provide money and
manpower to private social
action groups, as well as pro
jects such as VISTA and the
Peace Corps. Cooperation with
the government without sub
mitting to government control
is the goal.
Control of local projects would
remain with local citizens. This
means that black ghetto pro
grams would be entirely in the
hands of the blacks. Contrary to
the vision of hordes of naive
white middle-class kids descend
ing to purify the ghetto, whites
would help in the ghetto only
when requested by blacks. This
essential factor of local control
has now been recognized in the
Bay Area Pilot project for Na
tional Service, where 1,000 vol
unteers are to be scheduled for
service during the next two
years. As pointed out by Ells
Culver, San Francisco Area Su
porvisor, local boards in East (
Menlo Park and East Palo Alto
will be 100 per cent black.
Plans now call for one to two ;
weeks of intensive discussion
groups beginning in June, in |
which prospective volunteers
can decide if they wish to con- j
tinue in the Pilot Project. Bi- '
racial teams of National Service
Volunteers will begin work in i
San Francisco this summer in
conjunction with organizations
such as the Mission Rebels, an
integrated community house
where over 700 kids come to "do
their thing." Projects will be
formulated by teams with the
help of black and white adult
supervisors.
Actual work in the ghetto will
be initiated and carried out pri
marily by the black team mem
ber. The white volunteer will,
not only learn from his counter- j
part, but will also be providing
materials and money from the
white community.
Within National Service it- j
self, there would be a great
flexibility. A semi-literate ghetto
dweller, for instance, might ful
fill his National Service by edu
cating himself. An art major
might complete his service by

contributing to the country's
cultural development. The basic
Idea of contributing to others
would remain a primary requis
ite for National Service.
Today the white middle class
power structure is under severe
attack for being unaware, un
conscious, and unchanging. CRE
and the adults with whom they
work represent a new kind of
activism—it is a unique joint
effort of high school and college
students, as well as adults
around the Bay area to formu
late a solid beginning for a
shoring up of positive individ
ual initiative. If attitudes of
white middle-class people can
continue to shift in this direc
tion, there may be real hope for
building a lasting peace in this
country.
