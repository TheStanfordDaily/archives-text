# Hubert's Time Had Come
## HHH Blows A Mind 
### Michael Sweeney 
I was innocently tooling down the boulevard
Saturday morning in my humble red Polish
coupe when the radio snapped on and com
manded
"I give you the Vice President of the Lnited
States of America. ..."
My forehead burst into a cold sweat and my
right eye contorted nervously. I didn't want the
Vice President the United States.
The traffic light turned red. I stopped and he
started:
"We are here today on business: freedom's
business, America's business, the Democratic
Party's business, in that order," rasped the teddy
bear voice of Hubert Horatio Humphrey.
An inexorable, fanciful tugging in my left
rear pants pocket broke my mesmerized shock
. . . my draft card was pulling me downward,
down, farther, blacker, down into a lonely hot
Asian grave having died on freedom's business,
America's business, the Democratic Party's busi
ness, in that order . . .
"... I shall seek the nomination of the Demo
cratic Party for the presidency of the United
States ..."
An impatient horn barked from a polished
pink Chevrolet Impala. The light was green and
I sputtered ahead on life's highway, otherwise
known as Penny Lane.
And I followed the white lines of the asphalt
roadway as I reeled under the purple prose of
Hubert's speech. My humble red Polish coupe
plunged dumbly ahead as I was innundated by
an icky sweet mass of molasses flowing out of
the radio. The hot yellow sun blushed red with
embarrassment at the words that Hubert spoke:
"... I believe Lyndon Johnson's presidency
will loom large in history for its dramatic lead
ership toward social progress, human oppor
tunity and peace ..."
I swerved dazedly to avoid a small child
pedalling across the street in his toy helicopter
gunship.
"The time has come ..." said Hubert.
He kept saying "The time has come . . .
Mercilessly, at first, then mercifully, because his
cliched repetition tuned my psyche onto the
Chambers extinguishing Hubert's rasp
ings.
Now the Time has come Time!
There is no place to run Time!
I might get burned by the sun Time!
But I've had my fun Time!
I've been loved and put aside Time!
I've been crushed by the tumbling tide
Time!

And my soul has been psychedelicized
Time!
These unsung sounds faded and Hubert re
turned assertively:
"The time has come for those who share a
deep and abiding belief in the purposes and
potentialities of this nation to say: I love my
country..."
A frail human soul can endure only so much.
Murmuring "bullshit" weakly on pouted lips, I
released the steering wheel of my humble red
Polish coupe and it went careening off the
road into a Woolworth's display window, scat
tering My County 'tis of Thee all over the store.
Amid a debris of electric toothbrushes and
plastic flowers, I used a last ounce of my red
American blood to depress a button on the still
barking radio. I got KFRC and The Supremes,
singing You Just Keep Me Hangin' On . . .
. .Why doncha get out of mah life
And let me make a new start . . .
Ghoulishly I switched the radio back to Hu
bert's speech:
"I believe we can maintain the strength need
ed to protect our national security. ... I believe,
too, in the practical possibilities of peace..."
And back to The Supremes
Seein' you only breaks mah heart aga-ain
"Nineteen hundred and sixty-eight is not the
year for frenzied or inflammatory rhetoric....
1 will resist the temptation to deceive either the
people or myself."
Why do you keep comin' around, play-ing
with mah hea-art
"I enter this course with a determination to
win
Set me free why doncha babe
Get out of mah life why doncha babe
You jus' keep me hangin o-on
The Supremes sang the last of their ethereal
hymn and I was left with only Hubert's grand
finale and my aching memories.
"My fellow Americans, we are the people
of today. WE ARE THE PEOPLE OF. ... "

Hubert: "We are the people of tomorrow.
And it is to the future that we look and we
aspire. . . . The challenge is urgent ... On to
victory!"

The Supremes sang the last of their ethereal

finale and my aching memories.
"My fellow Americans, we are the people

Draft Week. Police loudspeaker tells the fear
ful young crowd jamming the doors to the In
duction Center, "i order you to disperse in the
NAME OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFOR

a cannon shout back, "WE are the people WE
are the people." My heart is in my mouth)
Hubert: "We are the people of tomorrow.
And it is to the future that we look and we
aspire. . . . The challenge is urgent ... On to
victory!"
And the yellow sun blushed red.
I was innocently tooling down the boulevard
Saturday morning in my humble red Polish
coupe when the radio snapped on and com
manded
"I give you the Vice President of the Lnited
States of America. ..."
My forehead burst into a cold sweat and my
right eye contorted nervously. I didn't want the
Vice President the United States.
The traffic light turned red. I stopped and he
started:
"We are here today on business: freedom's
business, America's business, the Democratic
Party's business, in that order," rasped the teddy
bear voice of Hubert Horatio Humphrey.
An inexorable, fanciful tugging in my left
rear pants pocket broke my mesmerized shock
. . . my draft card was pulling me downward,
down, farther, blacker, down into a lonely hot
Asian grave having died on freedom's business,
America's business, the Democratic Party's busi
ness, in that order . . .
"... I shall seek the nomination of the Demo
cratic Party for the presidency of the United
States ..."
An impatient horn barked from a polished
pink Chevrolet Impala. The light was green and
I sputtered ahead on life's highway, otherwise
known as Penny Lane.
And I followed the white lines of the asphalt
roadway as I reeled under the purple prose of
Hubert's speech. My humble red Polish coupe
plunged dumbly ahead as I was innundated by
an icky sweet mass of molasses flowing out of
the radio. The hot yellow sun blushed red with
embarrassment at the words that Hubert spoke:
"... I believe Lyndon Johnson's presidency
will loom large in history for its dramatic lead
ership toward social progress, human oppor
tunity and peace ..."
I swerved dazedly to avoid a small child
pedalling across the street in his toy helicopter
gunship.
"The time has come ..." said Hubert.
He kept saying "The time has come . . .
Mercilessly, at first, then mercifully, because his
cliched repetition tuned my psyche onto the
Chambers extinguishing Hubert's rasp
ings.
Now the Time has come Time!
There is no place to run Time!
I might get burned by the sun Time!
But I've had my fun Time!
I've been loved and put aside Time!
I've been crushed by the tumbling tide
Time!

And my soul has been psychedelicized
Time!
These unsung sounds faded and Hubert re
turned assertively:
"The time has come for those who share a
deep and abiding belief in the purposes and
potentialities of this nation to say: I love my
country..."
A frail human soul can endure only so much.
Murmuring "bullshit" weakly on pouted lips, I
released the steering wheel of my humble red
Polish coupe and it went careening off the
road into a Woolworth's display window, scat
tering My County 'tis of Thee all over the store.
Amid a debris of electric toothbrushes and
plastic flowers, I used a last ounce of my red
American blood to depress a button on the still
barking radio. I got KFRC and The Supremes,
singing You Just Keep Me Hangin' On . . .
. .Why doncha get out of mah life
And let me make a new start . . .
Ghoulishly I switched the radio back to Hu
bert's speech:
"I believe we can maintain the strength need
ed to protect our national security. ... I believe,
too, in the practical possibilities of peace..."
And back to The Supremes
Seein' you only breaks mah heart aga-ain

"The time has come for those who share a
deep and abiding belief in the purposes and
potentialities of this nation to say: I love my
country..."
A frail human soul can endure only so much.
Murmuring "bullshit" weakly on pouted lips, I
released the steering wheel of my humble red
Polish coupe and it went careening off the
road into a Woolworth's display window, scat
tering My County 'tis of Thee all over the store.
Amid a debris of electric toothbrushes and
plastic flowers, I used a last ounce of my red
American blood to depress a button on the still
barking radio. I got KFRC and The Supremes,
singing You Just Keep Me Hangin' On . . .
. .Why doncha get out of mah life
And let me make a new start . . .
Ghoulishly I switched the radio back to Hu
bert's speech:
"I believe we can maintain the strength need
ed to protect our national security. ... I believe,
too, in the practical possibilities of peace..."
And back to The Supremes
Seein' you only breaks mah heart aga-ain
"Nineteen hundred and sixty-eight is not the
year for frenzied or inflammatory rhetoric....
1 will resist the temptation to deceive either the
people or myself."
Why do you keep comin' around, play-ing
with mah hea-art
"I enter this course with a determination to
win
Set me free why doncha babe
Get out of mah life why doncha babe
You jus' keep me hangin o-on
The Supremes sang the last of their ethereal
hymn and I was left with only Hubert's grand
finale and my aching memories.
"My fellow Americans, we are the people
of today. WE ARE THE PEOPLE OF. ... "
(Oakland, 6 a.m., October 20, 1967. Stop the
Draft Week. Police loudspeaker tells the fear
ful young crowd jamming the doors to the In
duction Center, "i order you to disperse in the
NAME OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFOR

a cannon shout back, "WE are the people WE

Hubert: "We are the people of tomorrow.
And it is to the future that we look and we
aspire. . . . The challenge is urgent ... On to
victory!"
And the yellow sun blushed red.
I was innocently tooling down the boulevard
Saturday morning in my humble red Polish
coupe when the radio snapped on and com
manded
"I give you the Vice President of the Lnited
States of America. ..."
My forehead burst into a cold sweat and my
right eye contorted nervously. I didn't want the
Vice President the United States.
The traffic light turned red. I stopped and he
started:
"We are here today on business: freedom's
business, America's business, the Democratic
Party's business, in that order," rasped the teddy
bear voice of Hubert Horatio Humphrey.
An inexorable, fanciful tugging in my left
rear pants pocket broke my mesmerized shock
. . . my draft card was pulling me downward,
down, farther, blacker, down into a lonely hot
Asian grave having died on freedom's business,
America's business, the Democratic Party's busi
ness, in that order . . .
"... I shall seek the nomination of the Demo
cratic Party for the presidency of the United
States ..."
An impatient horn barked from a polished
pink Chevrolet Impala. The light was green and
I sputtered ahead on life's highway, otherwise
known as Penny Lane.
And I followed the white lines of the asphalt
roadway as I reeled under the purple prose of
Hubert's speech. My humble red Polish coupe
plunged dumbly ahead as I was innundated by
an icky sweet mass of molasses flowing out of
the radio. The hot yellow sun blushed red with
embarrassment at the words that Hubert spoke:
"... I believe Lyndon Johnson's presidency
will loom large in history for its dramatic lead
ership toward social progress, human oppor
tunity and peace ..."
I swerved dazedly to avoid a small child
pedalling across the street in his toy helicopter
gunship.
"The time has come ..." said Hubert.
He kept saying "The time has come . . .
Mercilessly, at first, then mercifully, because his
cliched repetition tuned my psyche onto the
Chambers extinguishing Hubert's rasp
ings.
Now the Time has come Time!
There is no place to run Time!
I might get burned by the sun Time!
But I've had my fun Time!
I've been loved and put aside Time!
I've been crushed by the tumbling tide
Time!

And my soul has been psychedelicized
Time!

turned assertively:
