## McCarthy Votes Show Insight 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
My letter to last Wednesday's
Dally expressed the opinion that
Kennedy supporters, prior to at
tacking McCarthy's voting
stands, ought to research more
carefully the reasons underlying
such stands. . . .
Consider all of the Foreign
Policy and Poverty-Welfare is
sues raised by the advertisement
in last Monday's Daily:
1. In 1961 Goldwater moved to
strip certain authorities from
the proposed Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency. McCarthy
voted with the conservatives, be
cause these authorities already
had been vested in other govern
ment agencies and because he
was opposed to placing all re
sponsibility for disarmament
work within a single agency.
2. In July 1966 McCarthy voted
against proposed slashes in mili
tary aid, as well as opposing cut
backs in non-military aid to Lat
in American countries with dis
proportionately large defense
budgets. Aid levels were already
low, and McCarthy expressed
his conviction that "the Senate
really ought to act to give direc
tion with reference to policy,
rather than to adopt , . . the de
vice of cutting appropriations in
order to influence policy."
3. Fulbright stated the case
against the 1965 proposal to
eliminate aid to Egypt whenever
she was found to be preparing
aggression against Israel. The
proposal was offered as a provi
sion to treat a specific country
in a specific manner; such a
measure might well have set a
precedent for other proposals by
Senators with dislikes for other
countries. McCarthy voted with
Fulbright.
4. Kuchel's 1966 proposal,
which McCarthy opposed, would
have granted a small percentage
of farm workers a substantial
minimum-wage hike; and conse
quently it might have led to ex
cessive unemployment of the re
sultingly more expensive agri
cultural laborers.
5. The Javits supported rent
supplements program, which
McCarthy voted to reduce, was
criticized both for undesirable
eligibility requirements and for
inadequate controls against in
creases in the rents charged to
subsidized families. . . .

McCarthy Hedges On
Civil Rights Support
Editor, The Daily:
In his letter last Thursday,
Bob Stern impugns a Kennedy
statement in Monday's Daily for
the "extremist" tactic of print
ing "half a story"; he then pur
ports to "set the record straight
with the full story." The charge
and Stern's answer seem typi
cal of recent attempts by Mc-
Carthy supporters to justify the
Senatorial performance of their
candidate.
Note first the single issue that
Stern chooses to comment upon:
the absence of Senator McCarthy
for the crucial fourth cloture
vote on the Civil Rights Act of
1968. Of the 16 examples cited
in the Kennedy statement, this
is the only issue that arose af
ter McCarthy's announced can
didacy. One can hardly explain
away the remainder of the Sen
ator's record by pointing to the
demands of his Presidential
campaign, since the issues cited
cover a period from 1961 throgh
1967.
Assuming that Stern merely
overlooked this fact and select
ed the cloture vote as a random
example, the "full story" that
he suggests for McCarthy's ab
sence is at best a curious one.
In the March sth issue of the
New York Times, Stern pur
ports to find a report that "Sen
ator McCarthy . . . had asked the
floor leadership to tell him when
the cloture vote was to be taken
so that he could be there. The
leadership failed to notify the
Senator and he arrived on the
floor one minute after the vote
was announced." The late edi
tion of the New York Times,
March 5, 1968, contains only the
following explanation of Mc-
Carthy's absence; "Moments af
ter the vote Eugene J. McCarthy,
Democrat of Minnesota, arrived
on the floor. He said he had been
dictating in his office and had
been assured he had adequate
time to reach the floor to vote
for cloture." There is no indica
tion that McCarthy had "asked
the floor leadership" to notify
him and that "the floor leader
ship" had failed to do so.
What we do know about the
cloture vote suggests less than
intense concern from a man
painted by his supporters as "a
leader in the fight for every ma
jor piece of civil rights legisla
tion" (Tho Daily, April 23). The
Senator clearly must have been

informed how important his
vote might be, since on March
3rd, majority leader Mike Mans
field stated that it was a "go
for-broke" vote and that the
fight for a civil rights bill would
be dropped if the cloture at
tempt failed (New York Times,
March 3). . . .
Even assuming Mr. Stern's ex
planation for McCarthy's ab
sence were correct, one must
still ask why a champion of civil
rights would not take it upon
himself to make certain he was
present for a vote likely to spell
failure for any civil rights legis
lation in 1968. . . .

Keep Calm In Midst
Of Youthful Outrage
Editor, The Dally:
To live in a community, one
must have a decent regard for
the other men's feelings. Some
members of our community
were clearly offended by the
(Michael) Barnes exhibit [re
moved from Old Union April
16]. Why not simply mount it in
a less public place? Nudists, for
example, generally observe this
ruleâ€”the slight to them or
Barnes is obviously less than to
the average man whose sensibil
ities are deeply pained (no use
jeering about it from a superior
intellectual position, the pain is
real) by these, to him extreme,
manifestations.
The many young people who
claim the privilege of outraging
the typical citizen as a right,
perhaps Constitution-based, are
evidently emotionally in need of
a counter-outrage. This is un
derstandable on the part of the
"abandoned generation", and I
sincerely sympathize with their
plight. But the best way out, I
am convinced, is to maintain a
reasonably calm and livable at
mosphere while going about the
serious business of thinking,
learning, creating.
The aim to epater le bourgeois
is a bohemian one which has
been usually eschewed by the
greatest artists, e.g. Flaubert,
MaJlarme. Or if artists like Bau
delaire had their moments of
fling, no one, including them
selves in their more sober
moods, expected the rules of so
cial behavior to be seriously al
tered. That would spoil all the
fun.
