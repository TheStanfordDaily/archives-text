# USSR ‘Involved’ In Idea Exchange

Intellectual activity in the
U.S.S.R. more intensely affects
a greater proportion of the pop
ulation than in the U.S., Profes
sor James Billington of Prince
ton said last Thursday in a Tre
sidder speech on "Intellectual
Ferment in the U.S.S.R."
Billington, professor of history
and an associate of the Wood
row Wilson School of Public and
International Affairs, recently
returned from a year spent
traveling and lecturing in Rus
sia where his children attended
Russian schools. Although at
first he was officially welcomed
last month he was denounced
by Izvestia as an "ideological
diversionist."
Billington noted Russians have
a "genuine structured dialogue
on substantive intellectual mat
ters," a real "marketplace of

ideas," even though it often has
ideological "overtones."
One reason for tills dialogue
Is that intellectual ferment In
often a substitute for enterJ
tainment and political opposi
tion. Billington called the
writer Yevtushenko "the Rus
sian version of Bobby Ken
nedy and of the Beatles,"
among others.
Another factor behind the in
tense intellectual dialogue is the
extent to which artistic and thea
trical programs solicit audience
participation. For instance, after
the performance of a play, there
is a period in which the audience
can exchange opinions and ques
tion the cast.
This intellectual activity is
apart from the "state culture"
which is centered in Moscow, the
"new window to the West."
Moscow offers the temptation
of "throwing in your lot with
the central power," and intellec
tuals are given inducements to
come into the "establishment."
But very few ever "succumb"
happily, Billington claimed, be
cause the "state culture" is "peg
ged for the 11-year-old mental
ity."
The real intellectual life is
outside the bureaucracy, in pri
vate "academics" somewhat like
the old French soirees.
The most Important intel
lectual problem In the U.S.-
S.R. today Is the "search for
a national Identity" which Is
being expressed In an "efTort
to recover all that was destroy
ed by the Stalin era." Three
things are being rediscovered:
1. "The legacy of the tradition
of truth-seeking intellectuals."
Youth is turning more and more
to older writers of the pre-revo
lutionary age who have a popu
lar purity and simplicity of
thought.
2. Rural Russia and the pea
sant. Billington compared this
increasing social concern to the
increasing concern of the prob
lems of the Negro community
in the U.S.
3. Religious interest. The
church is in the fore front of the
"civil rights movement" and orig
inated much of of the protest
literature which is possible now
that there is more freedom of
speech. This religious revival is
like "a hippie movement that
doesn't have to go outside the
country to find its guru."
In looking at Russian intellect
ual ferment, Billington warned,
one must be careful not to make
broad generalizations, but should
take into account the "tremen
dous human warmth" of the
Russians, and the diversity pres
ent in such a large country.
