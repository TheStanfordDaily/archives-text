# Sen. Albert Gore To Speak At Noon
## 
### 
United States Senator Albert
Gore (Dem., Tenn.) will speak
this noon in Cubberley Audito
rium on "Vietnam Negotiables."
His visit is being sponsored
jointly by the Political Union
and the Institute of Internation
al Relations.
In a speech in Idaho on Feb
ruary 17, The Senator said that
National Security requires the
United States to get out of the
"morass in Vietnam" by negoti
ating disengagement of U.S.
forces through the neutraliza
tion of Vietnam.
Gore said that the Adminis

tration is "mesmerized by mi
rages" and fails to see where the
real national interest lies. War
worsens U.S. relations with the
Soviet Union and Communist
China, and possibly creates con
ditions for healing the breach
between them, he suggested.
He is a leading proponent of
tax reform, and a leader in the
fight for health and hospital
care for the elderly through So
cial Security. He has supported
the Marshall Plan, NATO, the
U.N., and other policies and pro
grams for collective security and
international cooperation.
