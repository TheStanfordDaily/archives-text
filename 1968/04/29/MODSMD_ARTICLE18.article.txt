# Ibsen Play In Palo Alto
## 'Master builder' Praised 
### FRANK S. ALBERTI 
Ibsen's the Masterbuilder op
ened Friday at the Manhattan
Playhouse in Palo Alto. It was
excellent.
The consummate artistry of
Ibsen's prophetic drama con
vinced the director, Jud 11 h
Dresch, of the necessity of giv
ing this performance. By chal
lenging the egotistical master
builder, Ibsen lays bare the life
he has set for himself as a self
appointed superman.
Only by exposing the hero to
the absurdity of his blind quest
can an actor embody this tragic
conflict between dreaming and
doing which alienates so many
of Ibsen's heroes.
This added extra-dimension
of ibsenian drama was under
stood but not fully exploited by
Eric Sillins who played Halvard
Solness, the masterbuilder.
Diana Ewings brings an ex
citing personality to her role
as Hilda, full of wit and spon
taneity. The red beret she wears
is one of those personal touches
which prove that she has en
tered the realm of the play. I
question her pig-tails though, a
bit foreign even to the emanci
pated woman of the 1890's.

Jacquelyn Ames, who played
the demanding part of the mas
terbuilder's wife, is to be com
mended for the complete syn
thesis that the slow, determined
movements of her body ex
pressed in this portrayal of a
prematurely old woman; for it
is around her that the play
revolves. It is to her finally, that
all of the characters must turn.
She sacrifices her motherhood
to Solness' obsessions and can
only dream of it through her
dolls and desolate nurseries.
The minor characters were
adequately though not fully por
trayed except for Noopy Dycks'

full-bodied interpretation of
Kaja which saved the first act.
This marks Miss Dycks' debut
with the Manhattan Playhouse.
Hopefully she will be given
more important roles in the
future.
Hilda, who sleeps in the nurs
ery, is another victim of the
masterbuilder's disequilibrium.
In a brilliant moment at the
end, Miss Ewing proclaims the
chastity of her dream by re
fusing to see the masterbuilder's
fall.
The play is presented on Fri
days and Saturdays at the Play
house.
