## Mod Cow Is Illusion 
### D. McGUIRE 
The camera lies, the grizzled
veterans of cinema tell us. The
camera, along with the makeup,
editing and technical depart
ments, can exaggerate and oc
casionally confuse. It does not
contradict the truth if, in fact,
there is any truth to be had. It
Just bends it.
In Titticut Follies the horror
of a mental institution is made
more horrible by being overex
posed, jiggled and cut into frag
ments. In Charade the glamor of
jet-set life is made more allur
ing by exquisite color, beautiful
costumes and international in
trigue.
But what if the techniques of
Charade were applied to a sub
ject as drab as the Bridgewater
State Hospital? The result is
Poor Cow.
Joy (Carol White) is a slat
tern. She marries a thief who
does not treat her very well, and
has a son by him. He is sent to
jail so she starts sleeping with
another thief (Terence Stamp.)
They get along a little better,
go to Wales for a vacation and
make love in a waterfall. But

the second thief is also nabbed,
so Joy goes to work in a pub
and lays various wretched peo
ple on the side. She also poses
for a bunch of slavering photo
graphers who occasionally put
film in their cameras.
Like everyone else, Joy has
another side. She loves her son
and has some hope of a good
life with the second thief. She
feels bad when people beat her
up. She sighs when she remem
bers the waterfall in Wales.
The catch is that Joy and
her sordid environment are
brilliantly recorded in gorg
eous color. Filthy alleys and
stinking tenements are com
posed into lovely scenes.
Joy, an unexceptional girl
with a fair body, looks very at
tractive up there on the big
screen. Somehow the director
and the cameraman have suc
ceeded where nature failedâ€”
they have made her interesting.
The semblance of realism is
injected into Poor Cow by the
use of documentary and mod
film cliches. A telephoto lens
follows Joy as she hurries along
a crowded street, just as it fol
lowed Lynn Redgrave along a
similar street in Georgie Girl a
few years back.
There is even a kind of inter
view where Joy talks to the
camera, giving the film an indel
ible stamp of pseudo-honesty.
The feature that distin
guishes life from drama is us
ually a lack of plot, suspense

and climax in life. In this
respect "Poor Cow" resembles
reality.
But the glossy surface of this
film creates an insidious illus
ion. Our lives are rather trite
affairs, although we may not all
suffer from the same poverty of
spirit that affected Joy.
The fact that Joy's life is com
posed into a series of beautiful
images can lead the unwary
moviegoer to the conclusion
that someone, somewhere, per
haps the great Director in the
sky, is looking at him through a
70mm technicolor lens.
Poor Cow Is an ephemeral
piece of work. It amounts to
nothing fore than slightly sour
skim milk whipped into a tasty
froth. While the consumption of
such a concoction is one of the
minor pleasure of a hot Sunday
afternoon, a film like Poor Cow
is basically dangerous. It can
lead one unwittingly to the con
clusion that life imitates art.
There is just enough vitality in
poor Cow to conceal the fact
that it is a pretty dream. Don't
believe it.
