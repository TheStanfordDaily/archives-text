### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.,
former special assistant to Pres
ident John F. Kennedy, told an
overflow crowd in Tresidder
large lounge yesterday that Sen.
Robert Kennedy is the only
Democratic presidential candi
date capable of handling the two
major problems facing the Unit
ed States today.
The City University of New
York history professor cited the
Vietnam war and the crisis in
race relations as the two issues
candidates "must be measured
against."
Schlesinger, author of A
Thousand Days, said Vice-
President Hubert Humphrey
has been "tragically wrong on
Vietnam," while Sen. Eugene
McCarthy has been "tragically
Inadequate" In facing the
questions of racial justice and
civil rights.
On the problems of race rela
tions and poverty, Schlesinger
said Kennedy has long support
ed and proposed programs to
aid the minorities and the poor.
Schlesinger claimed that such
action was not for political mo
tives, since most of the people
his actions aided did not vote.
Kennedy has worked for those
"who in the past have been the
constiuents of no-one. He has
been the representative of the
unrepresented," Schlesinger
said.
He also noted that some
have said Kennedy as "too di
visive a personality for a mis
sion of national reconciliation"
such as the race problem.
But he defended the senator,
saying the presidencies of Eisen
hower and Johnson have shown
the results of a policy of "con
sensus for consensus sake."
"Reconciliation is to be
achieved not through tranquili
zing or poetic affirmation of

faith but through hard work,"
he said.
On foreign affairs, Schlesinger
said that Kennedy is the only
candidate who has proven capa
ble of dealing with crises, citing
the Cuban missile crisis of 1962
as his proof.
The other candidates "may
possess this capacity," he said,
"but only Kennedy has demon
strated it."
Schlesinger dismissed some
people's dislike of the manner
in which the senator entered the
race.
He called the abrupt entry a
"Kennedy trait," comparing it to
John F. Kennedy's running
against Adlai Stevenson in 1960,
Edward Kennedy's senatorial
race in 1962, and Robert Ken
nedy's decision to run for sena
tor from New York in 1964.
He also refuted the idea that
Kennedy should have left t":e
anti-Johnson campaign to Mc-
Carthy, since the Minnesota sen
ator was the first one to enter
the race.
Schlesinger compared this
case to 1952, when Estes Ke
fauver, then senator from Ten
nessee,, defeated President
Harry S. Truman in New
Hampshire, brought about
Truman's withdrawal from
the race, swept the other pri
maries, but then lost to Ste
venson in the convention.
The choice of a candidate
should be made on the basis of
who would "make a better Pres
ident," Schlesinger said, not on
who entered first.
After the speech, Schlesinger
was asked if he thought John
son would actively support any
of the three Democratic candi
dates.
"He'll probably give quiet sup
port to Humphrey," he said,
"and if the Humphrey move
fails, he'll probably support Mc-
Carthy."
