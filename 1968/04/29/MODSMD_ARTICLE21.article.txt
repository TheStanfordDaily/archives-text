### PETER DUFFY 
After losing 7-6 to the Wash
ington State Cougars Friday,
the Stanford Indians took a
doubleheader from the Wash
ington Huskies by scores of 10-4
and 7-0.
The weekend's activity, how
ever, was overshadowed to news
learned Friday that a protest
lodged by USC In the second
game of last Saturday's double
header had been upheld.
The Tribe won that contest
S-2, but according to the deci
sion handed down by the lea
gue office, the game will go
down as a 1-1 tie and will not
be replayed.
The protest concerned a situ
ation in the sixth inning where
with the game tied at one apiece
Stanford had Russ Tweet on
first with no outs. Mark Mar
quess then bunted a ball that
caromed off the ground and hit
the bat again, landing in fair
territory. Tweet moved to sec
ond and Marquess was out on
the sacrifice.
USC manager Rod Dedeaux
protested that Marquess was au
tomatically out and asked the
umpire to consult the rule book.
When the umpire told Dedeaux
to return to the dugout, the USC

mentor announced he was play
ing the game under protest.
As events turned out, Sho
maker followed with a single
moving Tweet to third and go
ing to second on the throw.
Bob Gallagher then ripped a
two-run rouble that provided the
winning 3-2 margin.
When the protest was given
official consideration, it was up
held and a 1-1 tie was decided
upon, since the bunt figured in
the winning run. Thus Stanford's
record is now 3-2 instead of 4-2,
and USC has one less defeat,
making the Tribe's title hopes a
bit less promising.
Friday afternoon Stanford
committed five errors and pave
the Cougars Ave unearned
runs In the 7-6 defeat The
Tribe rallied for two runs in
the ninth to fall short by a
single marker.
In Saturday's opening contest,

Phil Keller hit a home run and
pitched the distance in the 104
rout. Keller fanned 10 and
walked four to notch his fourth
win of the season against one
loss.
Bob Boone paced Stanford's
to return to the dugout the USC
11-hit attack with three singles
and two RBI in four trips. Mike
Ammirato and Marquess collect
ed a pair of hits apiece.
In the nine-inning nightcap
Harvey Shank allowed only
three singles In collecting his
eighth win. Shank struck out
10 and walked only one, as he
further lowered his earned
run average, which was 0.83
going Into the contest.
Chuck Williams, playing at
short for the injured Russ
Tweet, clouted a three-run homer
in the eighth inning that travel
led a good 400 feet to the base
of the wooden fence in left
corner.
