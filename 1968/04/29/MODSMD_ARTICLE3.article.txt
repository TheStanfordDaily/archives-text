## Columbia Classes Called Off 
### 
NEW YORK (AP)—Columbia
University President Grayson
R. Kirk announced late Sunday
that the school would be closed
again Monday to permit a con
tinuation of discusisons about
the student sit-in at five univers
ity buildings.
The student protest, which be
gan last Tuesday, led to a sus
pension of night classes for
three days last week and finally
to the suspension of the day ses
sion Friday.
At a meeting Sunday morn
ing, the university's professors
voted against giving amnesty to
the demonstrators, in effect, ap
proving an earlier action by the
Columbia Board of Trustees.
But as the senior faculty
members drew up their pre
scription for peace, the student
rebels stood fast for amnesty
and demanded an end to what
they called the administration's
"repressive rule."
School estimates put at 500 to
600 the number of students com
manding four campus buildings
and occupying the offices of the
university president, in the fifth
building, Memorial Library.
• Ky Hits U.S.
DALAT, Vietnam (AP) —
Aiming his words at the United
States and other allies in Viet
nam, Vice President Nguyen
Cao Ky declared Sunday that to
"any foreigner who forces us to
surrender to the Communists

and wants to withdraw from
Vietnam, I will say: 'You can
withdraw today'. "
Ky's speech was the strongest
statement to date expressing
fears among some Vietnamese
that the United States might
seek a way out of Vietnam by
negotiating a peace that would
force the government to accept
a coalition with the Viet Cong.
Ky and President Nguyen Van
Thieu, as well as other govern
ment officials and legislators,
have come out strongly against
coalition.
• A'Treaty Support
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y.
(AP) — Twelve small nations
have drafted a resolution aimed
at winning General Assembly
endorsement of the U.S.-Soviet
treaty to ban the spread of nu
clear weapons.
The sponsors believe they will
encounter a negative vote only
from Albania in the assembly's
124-nation main political com
mittee. Albania, generally is
viewed as Red China's mouth
piece in the United Nations.
The small-nation resolution
attempts to ease the fears of In
dia and other non-nuclear coun
tries that once the treaty is ap
proved the United States and
Russia will stall on nuclear dis
armament.
The draft emphasizes that the
treaty "must be followed by ef
fective steps for cessation of

the nuclear arms race and on
nuclear disarmament."
• Rights Cause Loses
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
handful of Negroes who hold
public office say the cause of
civil rights didn't gain enough
ground last year for the
Negroes who inhabit America's
slums to see any change for the
better in their lives.
"Those locked in the ghetto
did not really feel the progress
that was made," said state Sen.
John W. E. Bowen, an Ohio Re
publican.
Only a minority of those re
plying to the questionnaire
thought that the cause of civil
rights made over-all advances
in 1967.
Arthur Fletcher, a city coun
cilman in Pasco, Wash., said
college - trained Negroes and
skilled blue-collar workers are
much better off, but added that
they make up less than 20 per
cent of the Negro population.
"The remaining 80 per cent
who were either marginally em
ployed or definitely hard-core
unemployed found little mea
sureable change in their personal
circumstances during the year
1967, Fletcher said.
• ISeiv Red Attacks?
SAIGON (AP)—The Commu
nists are prepared for a new of
fensive in Vietnam and could
pick the time and the place to

launch it, according to compre
hensive allied intelligence re
ports from all parts of the coun
try.
Many Communist units that
were mangled in the February
Tet offensive have been re
stored with North Vietnamese
troop replacements, local re
cruiting and infiltrated weap
ons, these reports indicate.
Battalions committed in the
February fighting appear ready
to fight again. They may be
joined by fresh North Viet
namese units never becore com
mitted to battle in South Viet
nam.
Allied intelligence sees two
main areas of enemy interest.
One is the capital city of Sai
gon, bloodied by attacks in Feb
ruary.
The other region of peak in
terest is the northern rim of
Vietnam ranging along the
DMZ, down to the old capital of
Hue, and west to the valley of
Ashaq.
• SF Lion Shot
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A
man mauled by a 450 pound
male lion Saturday at the San
Francisco Zoo was reported re
covering today from deep lacer
ations and fractures of both
feet.
The lion, five-year-old Tommy
who was born in captivity was
shot dead between the eyes by


ARTHUR SCHLESINGER
a keeper with a high powered
rifle.
Zoo officials said the mauled

victim, Amos Watson, 59, of Mil
pitas, Calif., had climbed over
the low iron fence fronting the
lion grotto and jumped into the
25-foot deep dry moat separat
ing Tommy and his mate, Vir
ginia, from spectators.
Witnesses said the lion, sun
ning himself on a padded

• Buying Policy Hit
WASHINGTON (AP) — A
congressional committee ac
cused the Defense Department
Sunday of "loose and flagrantly
negligent management prac
tices" in its $45-billion-a-year
buying programs.
The Senate - House Economic
Subcommittee on Economy in
Government cites testimony
that a spot check on a single as
pect of defense procurement
practices indicated overcharges
of $130 million over a 10-year
period.
"Obviously, this figure repre
sents only a fraction of the total
overcharge," the subcommittee
says in a report based on hear

ings last November and Decem
ber.
A Pentagon statement called
the findings inaccurate and mis
leading.
The report says the depart
ment apparently refuses to re
verse a trend toward awarding
contracts by negotiation rather
than competitive bidding.
