# Gubser ‘Misinterpreted’ Over A-Weapon Question
## 
### 
In his press conference Fri
day, Santa Clara County Con
gressman Charles Gubser main
tained that he had been "misin
terpreted" by the press with re
gards to his statements about
the use of tactical nuclear weap
ons in February.
"I do not favor the use of
tactical nuclear weapons in
Southeast Asia," the Republican
Congressman stated, "and I

know of no presently conceiv
able circumstances under which
I would favor their use."
Gubser, having just returned
from Southeast Asia, said that
he continues to believe that an
end to the Vietnam war "must
come by negotiation."
Despite the loss of three F-11l
fighter-bombers, Gubser feels
certain that early problems with
the controversial plane's auto

matic pilot system will be work
ed out.
Gubser sharply criticized the
division of American opinion be
tween the hawks and the doves.
He feels that "the thoughtful,
deliberate, and most logical pol
icy lies between the two ex
tremes."
The advocate of unilateral
withdrawal will convince Ho Chi
Minh that he "can win every
thing he wants without talking,"
Gubser said. On the other hand,
he added that "gradually esca
lating the war to force a sur
render" would force Ho Chi Minh
to continue the war.
Attitude of Concern
Among American soldiers in
Vietnam Gubser discovered a
"universal and probably unani
mous" attitude of concern for
the support of the American pub
lic. He quoted one top military
man as saying, "I get the feel
ing there are two wars going
on — the one I'm fighting and
the one I read about in the
American press."
Gubser praised South Viet
namese President Thieu and said
he is "developing as a national
leader." He is certain that under
Thieu's leadership the country
will "shoulder more of the war's
burden."
Dissent Allowed
A taped interview with Con
gressman Chou, who was one of
Thieu's opponents for the Pres
idency, showed that "dissent is
allowed and exists to a consider
able extent," said Gubser.
While admitting that the Tet
offensive was a major one by
the North Vietnamese, Gubser
maintained that it was a "mili
tary failure."
Refering to another major
North Vietnamese offensive,
Gubser claimed that "The ana
logy between Khe Sanh and Dien
Bien Phu was created by the
press and is not valid."
The Tet offensive, Gubser
said, "did more to unify the
Vietnamese people against the
V.C. than any other thing that
has happened."
Offensive Expected
American military intelligence
had anticipated the Tet offen
sive Gubser said, but had ex

pected it to occur "a little later
during the holiday." He added
that "another attack on the
cities is expected in the reason
ably near future."
The North Vietnamese defeat
at Khe Sanh in Gubser's esti
mation rests largely on the capa
bilities of the B-52. Referring to
the results of the bombing
around the base's perimeter, he
said he had "never in all my life
seen so many acres plowed so
deep."
Turning to other travels, Gub
ser found the Koreans "our
staunchest and friendliest al
lies." However, he added that ex
cluding them from talks regard
ing the Pueblo "caused real con
cern that we may be reneging
our commitment."
Settlement of the Pueblo inci
dent, Gubser speculated, "will
be an humiliating 'confession'
and apology, after which the
United States will disavow the
apology,"
Four Proposals
Gubser also delineated four
proposals which he feels are rea
sonable and "represent the best
chance for the earliest possible
peace."
The first proposal calls for
Ambassador Harriman and Cy
rus Vance to "daily take their
seats at the appropriate nego
iating table" in France until
North Vietnam agrees to nego
tiations. Gubser said that the
U.S. should "hold forth the
tempting offer of a complete
cessation of bombing when the
North agrees to stop its illegal
shipman of arms and supplies
and its infiltration to the south."
Secondly, Gubser calls for
"complete frankness" and "cau
tions candor" by the Adbinistra
tion.
Gubser wants negotiations
with both the North and the
National Liberation Front with
concessions on a quid pro quo
basis.
Finally, Gubser said that the
tour convinced him that "The
South Vietnamese are now ca
pable of doing more and that we
should do less."

U.S. should "hold forth the
tempting offer of a complete
cessation of bombing when the
North agrees to stop its illegal
shipman of arms and supplies
and its infiltration to the south."
Secondly, Gubser calls for
"complete frankness" and "cau
tions candor" by the Adbinistra
tion.
Gubser wants negotiations
with both the North and the
National Liberation Front with
concessions on a quid pro quo
basis.
Finally, Gubser said that the
tour convinced him that "The
South Vietnamese are now ca
pable of doing more and that we
should do less."
In his press conference Fri
day, Santa Clara County Con
gressman Charles Gubser main
tained that he had been "misin
terpreted" by the press with re
gards to his statements about
the use of tactical nuclear weap
ons in February.
"I do not favor the use of
tactical nuclear weapons in
Southeast Asia," the Republican
Congressman stated, "and I

know of no presently conceiv
able circumstances under which
I would favor their use."
Gubser, having just returned
from Southeast Asia, said that
he continues to believe that an
end to the Vietnam war "must
come by negotiation."
Despite the loss of three F-11l
fighter-bombers, Gubser feels
certain that early problems with
the controversial plane's auto

matic pilot system will be work
ed out.
Gubser sharply criticized the
division of American opinion be
tween the hawks and the doves.
He feels that "the thoughtful,
deliberate, and most logical pol
icy lies between the two ex
tremes."
The advocate of unilateral
withdrawal will convince Ho Chi
Minh that he "can win every
thing he wants without talking,"
Gubser said. On the other hand,
he added that "gradually esca
lating the war to force a sur
render" would force Ho Chi Minh
to continue the war.
Attitude of Concern
Among American soldiers in
Vietnam Gubser discovered a
"universal and probably unani
mous" attitude of concern for
the support of the American pub
lic. He quoted one top military
man as saying, "I get the feel
ing there are two wars going
on — the one I'm fighting and
the one I read about in the
American press."
Gubser praised South Viet
namese President Thieu and said
he is "developing as a national
leader." He is certain that under
Thieu's leadership the country
will "shoulder more of the war's
burden."
Dissent Allowed
A taped interview with Con
gressman Chou, who was one of
Thieu's opponents for the Pres
idency, showed that "dissent is
allowed and exists to a consider
able extent," said Gubser.
While admitting that the Tet
offensive was a major one by
the North Vietnamese, Gubser
maintained that it was a "mili
tary failure."
Refering to another major
North Vietnamese offensive,
Gubser claimed that "The ana
logy between Khe Sanh and Dien
Bien Phu was created by the
press and is not valid."
The Tet offensive, Gubser
said, "did more to unify the
Vietnamese people against the
V.C. than any other thing that
has happened."
Offensive Expected
American military intelligence
had anticipated the Tet offen
sive Gubser said, but had ex

pected it to occur "a little later
during the holiday." He added
that "another attack on the
cities is expected in the reason
ably near future."
The North Vietnamese defeat
at Khe Sanh in Gubser's esti
mation rests largely on the capa
bilities of the B-52. Referring to
the results of the bombing
around the base's perimeter, he
said he had "never in all my life
seen so many acres plowed so
deep."
Turning to other travels, Gub
ser found the Koreans "our
staunchest and friendliest al
lies." However, he added that ex
cluding them from talks regard
ing the Pueblo "caused real con
cern that we may be reneging
our commitment."
Settlement of the Pueblo inci
dent, Gubser speculated, "will
be an humiliating 'confession'
and apology, after which the
United States will disavow the
apology,"
Four Proposals
Gubser also delineated four
proposals which he feels are rea
sonable and "represent the best
chance for the earliest possible
peace."
The first proposal calls for
Ambassador Harriman and Cy
rus Vance to "daily take their
seats at the appropriate nego
iating table" in France until
North Vietnam agrees to nego
tiations. Gubser said that the
U.S. should "hold forth the
tempting offer of a complete
cessation of bombing when the
North agrees to stop its illegal
shipman of arms and supplies
and its infiltration to the south."

our commitment."
Settlement of the Pueblo inci
dent, Gubser speculated, "will
be an humiliating 'confession'
and apology, after which the
United States will disavow the
apology,"
Four Proposals
Gubser also delineated four
proposals which he feels are rea
sonable and "represent the best
chance for the earliest possible
peace."
The first proposal calls for
Ambassador Harriman and Cy
rus Vance to "daily take their
seats at the appropriate nego
iating table" in France until
North Vietnam agrees to nego
tiations. Gubser said that the
U.S. should "hold forth the
tempting offer of a complete
cessation of bombing when the
North agrees to stop its illegal
shipman of arms and supplies
and its infiltration to the south."
Secondly, Gubser calls for
"complete frankness" and "cau
tions candor" by the Adbinistra
tion.
Gubser wants negotiations
with both the North and the
National Liberation Front with
concessions on a quid pro quo
basis.
Finally, Gubser said that the
tour convinced him that "The
South Vietnamese are now ca
pable of doing more and that we
should do less."
In his press conference Fri
day, Santa Clara County Con
gressman Charles Gubser main
tained that he had been "misin
terpreted" by the press with re
gards to his statements about
the use of tactical nuclear weap
ons in February.
"I do not favor the use of
tactical nuclear weapons in
Southeast Asia," the Republican
Congressman stated, "and I

know of no presently conceiv
able circumstances under which
I would favor their use."
Gubser, having just returned
from Southeast Asia, said that
he continues to believe that an
end to the Vietnam war "must
come by negotiation."
Despite the loss of three F-11l
fighter-bombers, Gubser feels
certain that early problems with
the controversial plane's auto

matic pilot system will be work
ed out.
Gubser sharply criticized the
division of American opinion be
tween the hawks and the doves.
He feels that "the thoughtful,
deliberate, and most logical pol
icy lies between the two ex
tremes."
The advocate of unilateral
withdrawal will convince Ho Chi
Minh that he "can win every
thing he wants without talking,"
Gubser said. On the other hand,
he added that "gradually esca
lating the war to force a sur
render" would force Ho Chi Minh
to continue the war.
Attitude of Concern
Among American soldiers in
Vietnam Gubser discovered a
"universal and probably unani
mous" attitude of concern for
the support of the American pub
lic. He quoted one top military
man as saying, "I get the feel
ing there are two wars going
on — the one I'm fighting and
the one I read about in the
American press."
Gubser praised South Viet
namese President Thieu and said
he is "developing as a national
leader." He is certain that under
Thieu's leadership the country
will "shoulder more of the war's
burden."
Dissent Allowed
A taped interview with Con
gressman Chou, who was one of
Thieu's opponents for the Pres
idency, showed that "dissent is
allowed and exists to a consider
able extent," said Gubser.
While admitting that the Tet
offensive was a major one by
the North Vietnamese, Gubser
maintained that it was a "mili
tary failure."
Refering to another major
North Vietnamese offensive,
Gubser claimed that "The ana
logy between Khe Sanh and Dien
Bien Phu was created by the
press and is not valid."
The Tet offensive, Gubser
said, "did more to unify the
Vietnamese people against the
V.C. than any other thing that
has happened."
Offensive Expected
American military intelligence
had anticipated the Tet offen
sive Gubser said, but had ex

pected it to occur "a little later
during the holiday." He added
that "another attack on the
cities is expected in the reason
ably near future."
The North Vietnamese defeat
at Khe Sanh in Gubser's esti
mation rests largely on the capa
bilities of the B-52. Referring to
the results of the bombing
around the base's perimeter, he
said he had "never in all my life
seen so many acres plowed so
deep."
Turning to other travels, Gub
ser found the Koreans "our
staunchest and friendliest al
lies." However, he added that ex
cluding them from talks regard
ing the Pueblo "caused real con
cern that we may be reneging
our commitment."
Settlement of the Pueblo inci
dent, Gubser speculated, "will
be an humiliating 'confession'
and apology, after which the
United States will disavow the
apology,"
