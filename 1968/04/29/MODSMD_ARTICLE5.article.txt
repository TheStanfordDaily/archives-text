# Nine Candidates Campaign In ASSU Presidential Primary
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
Nine slates of candidates for
ASSU president and vice-presi
dent began campaigning this
weekend for the May 7-8 pri
mary election.
Included on the ballot will be
nine propositions, plus election
of senior class president and
vice-president, three posts in
the Woman's Recreation Asso
ciation (WRA) and two repre
sentatives to the National Stu
dent Association (NSA) con
vention.
Jack Collins, a senior history
major from Alpha Sigma Phi,
and Bruce Smith, a junior ma
jor in engineering, are the only
announced candidates for the
two senior class posts.
No petitions were presented
for the NSA and WRA posi
tions. However, write-ins are al
lowed in the primaries, so that
a student could be elected to
these posts without formally an
nouncing his intention to seek
an office.

The record number of candi
dates for leadership of the exec
utive branch of student govern
ment promises to attract most
student attention, as it has in
years past.
The following candidates'
names will appear on the ballot
for ASSU president and vice
president:
• Michael Bruwer, a j un i or
social though major and Rin
conada sponsor, and David Rob
ertson, a junior political science
major living in Portola Valley;
• Vicky Drake, a senior Span
ish major living at 130 Fulton
Street, Palo Alto and John Hejl,
a senior in German living at the
same address;
• Denis Hayes, a senior his
tory major living at 2249 Euclid
Avenue, East Palo Alto, and Vic
tor Von Schlegell, a junior ma
joring in political science and a
member of Theta Chi;
• Harvey H. Hukari, Jr. a
senior majoring in political sci
ence and a member of Grove

House, and Larry Biehl, a first
year business student living at
East O'Keefe in Palo Alto;
• Steven Kaplan, a senior in
Alpha Sigma and a psychology
major, and Don Griffin, a junior
political science major and a
sponsor in Arroyo;
• Hugh (Hue) Mac Donald, a
senior in electrical engineering
living in Fremont, and Mareie
Sussman, a freshman in Roble
with an undeclared major;
• Ira Mendlowitz, a graduate
student in music living at 1305
Bay Laurel, Menlo Park, and
Bil Zigrang, a medical student
living at 723 Marsh Road, Men
lo Park;
• Joe Reich, a senior political
science major living at 130 Ful
ton Street, Palo Alto, and Jeff
Kane, a junior biological science
major living at 635 Gerona;
• Jurgen M. Wolff, a junior
in Toyon with an undeclared
major, and Nancy Soule-Amen,
a sophomore in Soto with an un
declared major.
One slate of candidates, Cal
decot Chubb and William Klin
gel, withdrew on Friday, and
their names will not appear on
the ballot.
In the past four years, Stan
ford students have had six dif
ferent student body presidents.
The first of these three cam
paigns was especially enlivened
by three Daily staffers who were
running as R.F. candidates.
Roger Magnuson, who ran in
the spring of 1965, insisted,
"Ambiguity in the pursuit of
ambivalence is no vice; clarity
in the pursuit of commitment is
no virtue."
Scott Mcßride, the successful
candidate for president in 1964,
called for "an investigation of
the entire judicial procedure"
and a "committee of faculty,
student, and administrators to
provide quality control in all
areas of academic concern."
However, it was Mcßride's
main opponent, John Bryson,
who called for the "establish
ment of a student committee on
University housing for the air
ing and coordination of stu
dents' views and suggestions."
That suggestion was finally
realized with the election of Da
vid Harris in 1966.
The successful candidate in
1965, Sandy MacKenzie, said that
it was "essential" that there
were "students serving on all
relevant administration and fac
ulty committees."
However it remained until
1966 that the Daily and most
other observers, completely un
derestimated the popularity of
the eventual president, David
Harris.
In an editorial of April 20,
1966, the Daily rfiid of Harris:
"He is too radical to win. . and
if he were to win, too unrealistic
and dogmatic to accomplish any
thing."
But opinions about Harris
changed.
When Harris resigned, Jacobi,
who was co-chairman of the
ASSU Housing Commission
that Harris initiated, said that
Harris "by the strength of his
convictions and the vision he
holds of the ideal educational
community . . . changed the at
mosphere at this University
from one of stagnation to one
where change is indeed pos
sible."

One slate of candidates, Cal

their names will not appear on

In the past four years, Stan
ford students have had six dif
ferent student body presidents.
The first of these three cam
paigns was especially enlivened
by three Daily staffers who were
running as R.F. candidates.
Roger Magnuson, who ran in
the spring of 1965, insisted,
"Ambiguity in the pursuit of
ambivalence is no vice; clarity
in the pursuit of commitment is
no virtue."
Scott Mcßride, the successful
candidate for president in 1964,
called for "an investigation of
the entire judicial procedure"
and a "committee of faculty,
student, and administrators to
provide quality control in all
areas of academic concern."
However, it was Mcßride's
main opponent, John Bryson,
who called for the "establish
ment of a student committee on
University housing for the air
ing and coordination of stu
dents' views and suggestions."
That suggestion was finally
realized with the election of Da
vid Harris in 1966.
The successful candidate in
1965, Sandy MacKenzie, said that
it was "essential" that there
were "students serving on all
relevant administration and fac
ulty committees."
However it remained until
1966 that the Daily and most
other observers, completely un
derestimated the popularity of
the eventual president, David
Harris.
In an editorial of April 20,
1966, the Daily rfiid of Harris:
"He is too radical to win. . and
if he were to win, too unrealistic
and dogmatic to accomplish any
thing."
But opinions about Harris
changed.
When Harris resigned, Jacobi,
who was co-chairman of the
ASSU Housing Commission
that Harris initiated, said that
Harris "by the strength of his
convictions and the vision he
holds of the ideal educational
community . . . changed the at
mosphere at this University
from one of stagnation to one
where change is indeed pos
sible."
Nine slates of candidates for
ASSU president and vice-presi
dent began campaigning this
weekend for the May 7-8 pri
mary election.
Included on the ballot will be
nine propositions, plus election
of senior class president and
vice-president, three posts in
the Woman's Recreation Asso
ciation (WRA) and two repre
sentatives to the National Stu
dent Association (NSA) con
vention.
Jack Collins, a senior history
major from Alpha Sigma Phi,
and Bruce Smith, a junior ma
jor in engineering, are the only
announced candidates for the
two senior class posts.
No petitions were presented
for the NSA and WRA posi
tions. However, write-ins are al
lowed in the primaries, so that
a student could be elected to
these posts without formally an
nouncing his intention to seek
an office.

The record number of candi
dates for leadership of the exec
utive branch of student govern
ment promises to attract most
student attention, as it has in
years past.
The following candidates'
names will appear on the ballot
for ASSU president and vice
president:
• Michael Bruwer, a j un i or
social though major and Rin
conada sponsor, and David Rob
ertson, a junior political science
major living in Portola Valley;
• Vicky Drake, a senior Span
ish major living at 130 Fulton
Street, Palo Alto and John Hejl,
a senior in German living at the
same address;
• Denis Hayes, a senior his

However, it was Mcßride's
main opponent, John Bryson,
who called for the "establish
ment of a student committee on
University housing for the air
ing and coordination of stu
dents' views and suggestions."
That suggestion was finally
realized with the election of Da
vid Harris in 1966.
The successful candidate in
1965, Sandy MacKenzie, said that
it was "essential" that there
were "students serving on all
relevant administration and fac
ulty committees."
However it remained until
1966 that the Daily and most
other observers, completely un
derestimated the popularity of
the eventual president, David
Harris.
In an editorial of April 20,
1966, the Daily rfiid of Harris:
"He is too radical to win. . and
if he were to win, too unrealistic
and dogmatic to accomplish any
thing."
But opinions about Harris
changed.
When Harris resigned, Jacobi,
who was co-chairman of the
ASSU Housing Commission
that Harris initiated, said that
Harris "by the strength of his
convictions and the vision he
holds of the ideal educational
community . . . changed the at
mosphere at this University
from one of stagnation to one
where change is indeed pos
sible."
Nine slates of candidates for
ASSU president and vice-presi
dent began campaigning this
weekend for the May 7-8 pri
mary election.
Included on the ballot will be
nine propositions, plus election
of senior class president and
vice-president, three posts in
the Woman's Recreation Asso
ciation (WRA) and two repre
sentatives to the National Stu
dent Association (NSA) con
vention.
Jack Collins, a senior history
major from Alpha Sigma Phi,
and Bruce Smith, a junior ma
jor in engineering, are the only
announced candidates for the
two senior class posts.
No petitions were presented
for the NSA and WRA posi
tions. However, write-ins are al
lowed in the primaries, so that
a student could be elected to
these posts without formally an
nouncing his intention to seek
an office.

The record number of candi
dates for leadership of the exec
utive branch of student govern
ment promises to attract most
student attention, as it has in
years past.
The following candidates'
names will appear on the ballot
for ASSU president and vice
president:
• Michael Bruwer, a j un i or
social though major and Rin
conada sponsor, and David Rob
ertson, a junior political science

ish major living at 130 Fulton
Street, Palo Alto and John Hejl,
a senior in German living at the
same address;

tor Von Schlegell, a junior ma

House, and Larry Biehl, a first

gel, withdrew on Friday, and
their names will not appear on
the ballot.
In the past four years, Stan
ford students have had six dif
ferent student body presidents.
The first of these three cam
paigns was especially enlivened
by three Daily staffers who were
running as R.F. candidates.
Roger Magnuson, who ran in
the spring of 1965, insisted,
"Ambiguity in the pursuit of
ambivalence is no vice; clarity
in the pursuit of commitment is
no virtue."
Scott Mcßride, the successful
candidate for president in 1964,
called for "an investigation of
the entire judicial procedure"
and a "committee of faculty,
student, and administrators to
provide quality control in all
areas of academic concern."
However, it was Mcßride's
main opponent, John Bryson,
who called for the "establish
