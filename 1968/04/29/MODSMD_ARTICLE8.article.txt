"As it was inevitable that simple minds would
see in the play (The Inspector General, by Niko
lai Gogol) a social satire violently volleyed at the
idyllic system of official corruption in Russia, one
wonders what hopes the author or anybody else
could have had of seeing the play performed.
"The censor's committee was as blatantly a
collection of bringing noodles or pompous asses
as all such organizations are, and the mere fact
of a writer daring to portray officers of the state
otherwise than as abstract figures and symbols
of superhuman virtue was a crime that sent
shivers down the censor's fat backs. That The
Inspector General happened to be the greatest
play ever written in Russia (and never surpassed
since) was naturally a matter infintely remote
from the committee's mind.
"The first performance of The Inspector Gen
eral was a vile affair in regard to acting and
setting, and Gogol was most bitter in his criti
cism of the abominable wigs and clownish clothes
and gross over-acting that the theater inflicted

upon his play. This started the tradtion of stag
ing The Inspector General as a burlesque; later
to this was added a background suggestive of
a 'comedie de moeurs'; so that the Twentieth
Century inherited a strange concoction of extra
vagant Gogolian speech and dingy matter-of-fact
setting — a state of affairs only solved now and
then by the personality of some actor of genius.
"Only once have I seen the play performed in
a foreign language (in English) and it is not a
memory I care to evoke. Of course nothing has
remained of Gogol's style. The English is dry
and flat, and always unbearably demure. None
but an Irishman should ever try tackling Gogol."

"When I first came to the U.S. nearly 40 years
ago, I played in many cities where the cello was
unknown. If the reviewer found that the Stradi
vari and the composition were bad, obviously I
had been very poor. But if the review said how
magnificent the composition was and how glor
ious the cello was, but how poorly Piatrigorsky
played, then I knew that I had been able to pre
sent the piece so that it was beautiful."
