## Gifts Needed To Meet Goals 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In your article Thursday
("Doubts Voiced on Giving To
King Fund," page 1) you state,
"And after the relatively tiny
King Fund is consumed to help
pay the initial costs, Stanford
will have to meet these commit
ments by taking money from
other uses in the operating bud
get." I hope you are wrong in
assuming that the King Fund
will be "relatively tiny," because
it seems to me that gifts to it
are particularly appropriate as
one means for individuals in the
Stanford Community to sacrifice
something to improve minority
opportunities.
What troubles me more is the
notion that it's all that easy "tak
ing money from other uses."
Each of us may have a pet peeve
about some University activity
which appears non-essential, but
I don't think every last member
of the Community is expected
to be in favor of every single ac
tivity. The pressure for funds at
Stanford and the necessity an
nually to postpone obvious im
provements have for many years
forced careful weighing of short
and long range priorities toward
improving the University's abil
ity to serve society.
In recognition of the high
priority now given minority op
portunity programs, we are ask
ing that other planned expendi
tures be reviewed; and in the
short run we will be able to re
allocate some resources, I'm
sure. But it is strictly a short run
possibility, for we face potential
deficits (in spite of tuition in
creases) in future years just to
'meet minimum operating re
quirements — unless gifts to the
University grow substantially.
I would hope that out of cam
pus interest in the King Fund
we might all be reminded that it
is through gifts that the Stan
ford we know exists. Excepting
sponsored federal projects and
self-supporting activities, the
basic needs of the University are
financed mainly from tuition and
gifts; in the last ten years Stan
ford received $122,000,000 in tui
tion and $233,000,000 in gifts. So
where do we think we'd be if
everyone had the kind of doubts
you reported about giving to
Stanford?
Certainly we as individuals
should be responding to other
calls for sacrifice, including gifts
to other agencies working di
rectly in the interest of minor
ity groups. But it needn't be an
"either - or" decision. We can, as
I know many have, consider and
select a number of these agen
cies to support by gifts. How
ever, I think it would be tragic
for those of us right here at
Stanford to ignore this Univer
sity's new commitments or to
assume that somebody else is
going to make all the sacrifices
to meet those commitments.
On another aspect of your re
porting — Yale's "flat $40,000
gift to projects in the New
Haven ghetto": My information
from Yale is that the $40,000 is
a new fund within the univer
sity's administration for the pur
pose of increasing Yale activities
(cultural, employment, etc.)
aimed at improving the oppor
tunities for disadvantaged
groups in the New Haven com
munity. In part at least, it is not
unlike Stanford funds being allo
cated to step up the recruiting
and training of summer and full
time employees from East Palo
Alto and Mountain View (in
cluding the Youth Opportunity

Program reported in Thursday's
Dally).
Quite apart from this $40,000
fund, Yale — thanks to a gift
available for the purpose — has
indicated to a newly formed
"black coalition" in New Haven
that the university would par
ticipate in lending financial sup
port to the coalition's organizing
and administrative costs. I un
derstand this action was taken
in Yale's own interest because
of the apparently chaotic and
competitive state of minority
group activities in New Haven.
My contact said no dollar
amount for this activity had
been made public and that Yale
was expecting to respond afte v
seeing concrete proposals from
the coalition.

Editor, The Daily:
For the benefit of those read
ers of the Daily who were ex
posed to the grotesquely distort
ed picture drawn by Drew Pear
son of the events in Berlin fol
lowing the attempted assassina
tion of Rudi Dutschke, I offer
the following summary of a
full page article in Die Zeit, 23
April, 1968. Die Zeit is a liberal
independent weekly newspaper,
friendly to the United States. The
Spring Press, so highly touted
by Pearson, is a German coun
terpart of the Hearst Press.
Pearson probably knows this but
he has apparently adopted the
Johnson - Humphrey line of a
few months ago: hint that your
opponents are fascists if you
suspect they are beginning to
have the same belief about you.
On Thursday, April 18, a house
painter named Josef Bachmann,
a communist hater, admirerer of
Hitler and would be imitator of
King's assassin, shot and critic
ally wounded the graduate stu
dent Rudi Dutschke. The reac
tion of the German Press varied
from high to low on the moral
scale, the low point being reach
ed by Springer's Bild am Sonn
tag with a headline "Dutscke
fiucht wieder" that Die Zeit
called "infamous."
A few hours later several
thousand students gathered
spontaneously in front of Spring
er's skyscraper on Kochstrasse.
They broke some windows and
a few tried to penetrate the
building but were turned back
by armed workers. About a
dozen students then overthrew
a delivery wagon containing
Springer periodicals, set fire to
the contents and sang the Inter
nationale. Minor disorders con
tiinued for the next two days.
On Easter Sunday the students
attempted to stop traffic and en
gage passersby in discussion at
three different places in Berlin.
About 300 demonstrators who
formed the first of the blockade
groups were maneuvered into
a position between two chains of
police. Without warning they
were then brutally attacked by

says Pie Zeit, that employed by
the police on June 2. On Easter
afternoon, the police again at
tacked student demonstrators
without warning and using ex
tremely harsh measures.
Sunday evening, without
knowledge of the Rector of the
University, or of the police pres
ident, the police attempted to
occupy the University but were
prevented by the Rector from
using tear gas against the audi
torium maximum where the
students were debating strategy
and tactics. Die Zeit calls the po
lice intervention during this
period "brutal and chaotic". As
on June 2, the police were stir
red up to more extreme behavior
by false statements reaching
them over their loud speakers.
When students came by auto
mobile to meet some students
who were being released, the
police were told that the auto
mobiles were loaded with stu
dents coming to free prisoners.

The police then attacked the
automobile and its passengers
and managed, in passing, to beat
up a Spiegel reporter.
Meanwhile students at the
University continued their al
most unending debates in the
auditorium maximum, rejecting
such extreme proposals as a plan
to blockade the roads to Berlin
and to free the remaining pris
oners by force.
Something else American stu
dents shown know is this: "Red
Rudi", as the Springer Press
calls him is violent enough to
throw tomatoes and eggs but
little else. He fled from the DDR
because he refused to enter
military service.

In your article Thursday
("Doubts Voiced on Giving To
King Fund," page 1) you state,
"And after the relatively tiny
King Fund is consumed to help
pay the initial costs, Stanford
will have to meet these commit
ments by taking money from
other uses in the operating bud
get." I hope you are wrong in
assuming that the King Fund
will be "relatively tiny," because
it seems to me that gifts to it
are particularly appropriate as
one means for individuals in the
Stanford Community to sacrifice
something to improve minority
opportunities.
What troubles me more is the
notion that it's all that easy "tak
ing money from other uses."
Each of us may have a pet peeve
about some University activity
which appears non-essential, but
I don't think every last member
of the Community is expected
to be in favor of every single ac
tivity. The pressure for funds at
Stanford and the necessity an
nually to postpone obvious im
provements have for many years
forced careful weighing of short
and long range priorities toward
improving the University's abil
ity to serve society.
In recognition of the high
priority now given minority op
portunity programs, we are ask
ing that other planned expendi
tures be reviewed; and in the
short run we will be able to re
allocate some resources, I'm
sure. But it is strictly a short run
possibility, for we face potential
deficits (in spite of tuition in
creases) in future years just to
'meet minimum operating re
quirements — unless gifts to the
University grow substantially.
I would hope that out of cam
pus interest in the King Fund
we might all be reminded that it
is through gifts that the Stan
ford we know exists. Excepting
sponsored federal projects and
self-supporting activities, the
basic needs of the University are
financed mainly from tuition and
gifts; in the last ten years Stan
ford received $122,000,000 in tui
tion and $233,000,000 in gifts. So
where do we think we'd be if
everyone had the kind of doubts
you reported about giving to
Stanford?
Certainly we as individuals
should be responding to other
calls for sacrifice, including gifts
to other agencies working di
rectly in the interest of minor
ity groups. But it needn't be an
"either - or" decision. We can, as
I know many have, consider and
select a number of these agen
cies to support by gifts. How
ever, I think it would be tragic
for those of us right here at
Stanford to ignore this Univer
sity's new commitments or to
assume that somebody else is
going to make all the sacrifices
to meet those commitments.
On another aspect of your re
porting — Yale's "flat $40,000
gift to projects in the New
Haven ghetto": My information
from Yale is that the $40,000 is
a new fund within the univer
sity's administration for the pur
pose of increasing Yale activities
(cultural, employment, etc.)
aimed at improving the oppor
tunities for disadvantaged
groups in the New Haven com
munity. In part at least, it is not
unlike Stanford funds being allo
cated to step up the recruiting
and training of summer and full
time employees from East Palo
Alto and Mountain View (in
cluding the Youth Opportunity

Program reported in Thursday's
Dally).
Quite apart from this $40,000
fund, Yale — thanks to a gift
available for the purpose — has
indicated to a newly formed

Editor, The Daily:
For the benefit of those read

ed picture drawn by Drew Pear
son of the events in Berlin fol
lowing the attempted assassina
tion of Rudi Dutschke, I offer
the following summary of a
full page article in Die Zeit, 23
April, 1968. Die Zeit is a liberal
independent weekly newspaper,
friendly to the United States. The
Spring Press, so highly touted
by Pearson, is a German coun
terpart of the Hearst Press.
Pearson probably knows this but
he has apparently adopted the
Johnson - Humphrey line of a
few months ago: hint that your
opponents are fascists if you
suspect they are beginning to
have the same belief about you.
On Thursday, April 18, a house
painter named Josef Bachmann,
a communist hater, admirerer of
Hitler and would be imitator of
King's assassin, shot and critic
ally wounded the graduate stu
dent Rudi Dutschke. The reac
tion of the German Press varied
from high to low on the moral
scale, the low point being reach
ed by Springer's Bild am Sonn
tag with a headline "Dutscke
fiucht wieder" that Die Zeit
called "infamous."
A few hours later several
thousand students gathered
spontaneously in front of Spring
er's skyscraper on Kochstrasse.
They broke some windows and
a few tried to penetrate the
building but were turned back
by armed workers. About a
dozen students then overthrew
a delivery wagon containing
Springer periodicals, set fire to
the contents and sang the Inter
nationale. Minor disorders con
tiinued for the next two days.
On Easter Sunday the students
attempted to stop traffic and en
gage passersby in discussion at
three different places in Berlin.
About 300 demonstrators who
formed the first of the blockade
groups were maneuvered into
a position between two chains of
police. Without warning they
were then brutally attacked by

L. S. BATHER
Professor of Pathology
Editor, The Daily:
In your article Thursday
("Doubts Voiced on Giving To
King Fund," page 1) you state,
"And after the relatively tiny
King Fund is consumed to help
pay the initial costs, Stanford
will have to meet these commit
ments by taking money from
other uses in the operating bud
get." I hope you are wrong in
assuming that the King Fund
will be "relatively tiny," because
it seems to me that gifts to it
are particularly appropriate as
one means for individuals in the
Stanford Community to sacrifice
something to improve minority
opportunities.
What troubles me more is the
notion that it's all that easy "tak
ing money from other uses."
Each of us may have a pet peeve
about some University activity
which appears non-essential, but
I don't think every last member
of the Community is expected
to be in favor of every single ac
tivity. The pressure for funds at
Stanford and the necessity an
nually to postpone obvious im
provements have for many years
forced careful weighing of short
and long range priorities toward
improving the University's abil
ity to serve society.
In recognition of the high
priority now given minority op
portunity programs, we are ask
ing that other planned expendi
tures be reviewed; and in the
short run we will be able to re
allocate some resources, I'm
sure. But it is strictly a short run
possibility, for we face potential
deficits (in spite of tuition in
creases) in future years just to
'meet minimum operating re
quirements — unless gifts to the
University grow substantially.
I would hope that out of cam
pus interest in the King Fund
we might all be reminded that it
is through gifts that the Stan
ford we know exists. Excepting
sponsored federal projects and
self-supporting activities, the
basic needs of the University are
financed mainly from tuition and
gifts; in the last ten years Stan
ford received $122,000,000 in tui
tion and $233,000,000 in gifts. So
where do we think we'd be if
everyone had the kind of doubts
you reported about giving to
Stanford?
Certainly we as individuals
should be responding to other
calls for sacrifice, including gifts
to other agencies working di
rectly in the interest of minor
ity groups. But it needn't be an
"either - or" decision. We can, as
I know many have, consider and
select a number of these agen
cies to support by gifts. How
ever, I think it would be tragic
for those of us right here at
Stanford to ignore this Univer
sity's new commitments or to
assume that somebody else is
going to make all the sacrifices
to meet those commitments.
On another aspect of your re
porting — Yale's "flat $40,000
gift to projects in the New
Haven ghetto": My information
from Yale is that the $40,000 is
a new fund within the univer
sity's administration for the pur
pose of increasing Yale activities
(cultural, employment, etc.)
aimed at improving the oppor
tunities for disadvantaged
groups in the New Haven com
munity. In part at least, it is not
unlike Stanford funds being allo
cated to step up the recruiting
and training of summer and full
time employees from East Palo
Alto and Mountain View (in
cluding the Youth Opportunity

Program reported in Thursday's
Dally).
Quite apart from this $40,000
fund, Yale — thanks to a gift
available for the purpose — has
indicated to a newly formed
"black coalition" in New Haven
that the university would par
ticipate in lending financial sup
port to the coalition's organizing
and administrative costs. I un
derstand this action was taken
in Yale's own interest because
of the apparently chaotic and
competitive state of minority
group activities in New Haven.
My contact said no dollar
amount for this activity had
been made public and that Yale
was expecting to respond afte v
seeing concrete proposals from
the coalition.

Editor, The Daily:
In your article Thursday
("Doubts Voiced on Giving To
King Fund," page 1) you state,
"And after the relatively tiny
King Fund is consumed to help
pay the initial costs, Stanford
will have to meet these commit
ments by taking money from
other uses in the operating bud
get." I hope you are wrong in
assuming that the King Fund
will be "relatively tiny," because
it seems to me that gifts to it
are particularly appropriate as
one means for individuals in the
Stanford Community to sacrifice
something to improve minority
opportunities.
What troubles me more is the
notion that it's all that easy "tak
ing money from other uses."
Each of us may have a pet peeve
about some University activity
which appears non-essential, but
I don't think every last member
of the Community is expected
to be in favor of every single ac
tivity. The pressure for funds at
Stanford and the necessity an
nually to postpone obvious im
provements have for many years
forced careful weighing of short
and long range priorities toward
improving the University's abil
ity to serve society.
In recognition of the high
priority now given minority op
portunity programs, we are ask
ing that other planned expendi
tures be reviewed; and in the
short run we will be able to re
allocate some resources, I'm
sure. But it is strictly a short run
possibility, for we face potential
deficits (in spite of tuition in
creases) in future years just to
'meet minimum operating re
quirements — unless gifts to the
University grow substantially.
I would hope that out of cam
pus interest in the King Fund
we might all be reminded that it
is through gifts that the Stan
ford we know exists. Excepting
sponsored federal projects and
self-supporting activities, the
basic needs of the University are
financed mainly from tuition and
gifts; in the last ten years Stan
ford received $122,000,000 in tui
tion and $233,000,000 in gifts. So
where do we think we'd be if
everyone had the kind of doubts
you reported about giving to
Stanford?
Certainly we as individuals
should be responding to other
calls for sacrifice, including gifts
to other agencies working di
rectly in the interest of minor
ity groups. But it needn't be an
"either - or" decision. We can, as
I know many have, consider and
select a number of these agen
cies to support by gifts. How
ever, I think it would be tragic
for those of us right here at
Stanford to ignore this Univer
