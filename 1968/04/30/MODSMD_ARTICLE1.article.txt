Insistence upon Western po
litical values in Southeast Asia,
where they may not be applic
able or desirable, undermines
United States foreign policy and
obstructs successful Vietnam
negotiations, said U.S. Senator
Albert Gore yesterday.
Senator Gore (Dem., Tenn.),
a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee and advo
cate of a negotiated disengage
ment from Vietnam, addressed
a noon hour audience in Cubber
ley.
His topic was "Vietnam Nego
tiables." He was sponsored joint
ly by the Political Union and the
Institute of International Rela
tions.
From the beginning, the
U.S. was Involved on the
wrong side of the colonial
question in Vietnam, said
Gore. "We have made one bis
take after another, each ag
gravating and deepening our
involvement," he said.
Senator Gore disagreed with
Vice-President Humphrey's state
ment that the intervention of
combat troops is necessary to in
sure liberty in Vietnam, calling
the move "unnecessary, one of
the greatest mistakes this coun
try has made."
"As long as the U.S. insists on
a separate, independent, pro
western republic governed by
those we support, there is not
likely to be a negotiated Viet
nam settlement," said Gore.
Nor is a settlement likely as
long as North Vietnam in
sists on complete U.S. cessation
of combat or withdrawal, leav
ing Ho Chi Minh in control of
all Vietnam.
An" settlement must be a

compromise position between
that of the United States and
North Vietnam, the Senator
said. He advocated negotia
tions for a neutral, unified, and
self-determining Vietnam, as
stipulated by the Geneva Ac
cords. Gore said both Johnson
and Ho Chi Minh have indicat
ed the Accords as a more or
less adequate basis for ne
gotiation.
To achieve this end, however,
it will be necessary to negotiate
on several levels. First, he list
ed is South Vietnam, followed
by Vietnam as a whole, the Indo-
Chinese Peninsula, and finally
the three major political, nuclear
powers, the United States, the
Soviet Union, and Red China.
The first level of negotiations,
said Gore, must be a reconcili
ation of opposing forces within
South Vietnam. "We must re
alize we are participating in a
civil war.
"There is a sizeable indigen
ous opposition to the Saigon
government and to the U.S. al
liance with it ... In my opinion
South Vietnam would be better
off if Ky had no part in any
government," explained Gore.
"If we, with all our superior
forces, equipment, mobility, etc.,
are unable to quell resistance to
the South Vietnam government,
how can we negotiate in the
interests of that government and
expect the nation to concur?" he
asked.
"Unlike Richard Nixon, I
am not opposed to a coalition
government or dealings with
the National Liberation
Front," Gore added.
The second thrust of the nego
tiations must be for self-deter-
