## Rhetoric Hides Violent Reality 
### Mike Vawter 
Pained, confused, and groping,
Liberalism is at last slipping
into the whirring cogs and gears
of time and reality. The initial
jolts that it is experiencing to
day are being absorbed with
varying degrees of frantic reas
sertion. McCarthy reaffirms the
value and efficacy of honor, in
tegrity, and moral courage;
Kennedy appeals to reason and
the non-violent ethos; and in the
more intricate machinery the
Liberal coup defines Johnson as
a weary and worn victim of the
"world situation".
But come, let us reason toge
ther. The reality of violence and
oppression in the world today
cannot be ignored; it cannot be
dealt with in words; it cannot
be eliminated by legislation,
education, or macrobiotic foods.
It is an integral and necessary
part of the American Way:
you'd better believe that coun
terinsurgency will stop at noth
ing but the victory of insur
gency.
Moral protest is today "in dan
ger of becoming a harmless

spectator sport, licensed, well
regulated and, up to a point,
even encouraged by the power
ful." While the mortal and only
significant enemy of U.S. im
perialism is revolutionary
change, people bicker over de
grees of oppression, degrees of
violence, forms of oppression,
and forms of violence. And all
this distorted by a basic interest
in maintaining the status quo,
or at least the fundamental ele
ments of it.
The illusory effects of that in
terest manifest themselves in
Liberalism, in the belief that
Liberal reform through Liberal
channels will correct the aber
rant facets of society, thus avert
ing potential violence, and con
sequently avoiding the need for
fascism.
But time, and the reality of
Vietnam, the reality of the CIA
around the world, the reality of
troops in the ghetto, the reality
of Martin Luther King's assas
sination attest to the fact of the
basically repressive, racist, and
whenever necessary violent na

ture of White Imperialist Amer
ica.
Time and reality attest to the
bankruptcy of Liberalism, espe
cially in the Black Struggle, and
yet we give to the Martin Lu
ther King Fund to help a very
few, aspiring Blacks, we crawl
optimistically through the mire
of civil rights legislation, and
we utterly condemn black mili
tancy, while America builds an
army and technology for the re
pression of human beings strug
gling for dignity.
Panthers Give Hope
The Black Panther Party rep
resents perhaps the only hope
America has to avoid race war.
It is also perhaps the only hope
black people have for survival
and growth. Indiscriminate reac
tion to racism, in the form of
spontaneous insurrection is
doomed to failure. Therefore it
is crucial, that white people
realize the importance of the
Panther's organizing work.
While building a mass move
ment for basic wide -range
change in the ghetto, they are

challenging the authority of cops
in the ghetto as the chief bar
rier to the formulation of a func
tional political movement de
signed to strive for essential
radical change. The violent sup
pression that they are being
confronted with must be met
with organized resistance. The
Panthers present a practical,
constructive, and effective pro
gram aimed at dealing with all
the problems of the ghetto: so
cial, economic, and military.

Liberal reform through Liberal
channels will correct the aber
rant facets of society, thus avert
ing potential violence, and con
sequently avoiding the need for
fascism.
But time, and the reality of
Vietnam, the reality of the CIA
around the world, the reality of
troops in the ghetto, the reality
of Martin Luther King's assas
sination attest to the fact of the
basically repressive, racist, and
whenever necessary violent na

ture of White Imperialist Amer
ica.
Time and reality attest to the
bankruptcy of Liberalism, espe
cially in the Black Struggle, and
yet we give to the Martin Lu
ther King Fund to help a very
few, aspiring Blacks, we crawl
optimistically through the mire
of civil rights legislation, and
we utterly condemn black mili
tancy, while America builds an
army and technology for the re
pression of human beings strug
gling for dignity.
Panthers Give Hope
The Black Panther Party rep
resents perhaps the only hope
America has to avoid race war.
It is also perhaps the only hope
black people have for survival
and growth. Indiscriminate reac
tion to racism, in the form of
spontaneous insurrection is
doomed to failure. Therefore it
is crucial, that white people
realize the importance of the
Panther's organizing work.
While building a mass move
ment for basic wide -range
change in the ghetto, they are

challenging the authority of cops
in the ghetto as the chief bar
rier to the formulation of a func
tional political movement de
signed to strive for essential
radical change. The violent sup
pression that they are being
confronted with must be met
with organized resistance. The
Panthers present a practical,
constructive, and effective pro
gram aimed at dealing with all
the problems of the ghetto: so
cial, economic, and military.
Pained, confused, and groping,
Liberalism is at last slipping
into the whirring cogs and gears
of time and reality. The initial
jolts that it is experiencing to
day are being absorbed with
varying degrees of frantic reas
sertion. McCarthy reaffirms the
value and efficacy of honor, in
tegrity, and moral courage;
Kennedy appeals to reason and
the non-violent ethos; and in the
more intricate machinery the
Liberal coup defines Johnson as
a weary and worn victim of the
"world situation".
But come, let us reason toge
ther. The reality of violence and
oppression in the world today
cannot be ignored; it cannot be
dealt with in words; it cannot
be eliminated by legislation,
education, or macrobiotic foods.
It is an integral and necessary
part of the American Way:
you'd better believe that coun
terinsurgency will stop at noth
ing but the victory of insur
gency.
Moral protest is today "in dan
ger of becoming a harmless

spectator sport, licensed, well
regulated and, up to a point,
even encouraged by the power
ful." While the mortal and only
significant enemy of U.S. im
perialism is revolutionary
change, people bicker over de
grees of oppression, degrees of
violence, forms of oppression,
and forms of violence. And all
this distorted by a basic interest
in maintaining the status quo,
or at least the fundamental ele
ments of it.
The illusory effects of that in
terest manifest themselves in
Liberalism, in the belief that
Liberal reform through Liberal
channels will correct the aber
rant facets of society, thus avert
ing potential violence, and con
sequently avoiding the need for
fascism.
