# A 						Conspiracy Of One
## No Battle Cry For Humphrey 
### Dan Snell 
Hubert Humphrey—you re
member Hubert Humphrey—is
now in the race for President,
to no one's surprise. I was chat
ting Saturday with a usually
specious source close to the
Vice President.
"Well, he finally declared his
candidacy," I cunningly ob
served.
"Yes, but it was a big strug
gle," my source said.
"In what way?"
"Well, quite understandably
he didn't want to criticize the
Administration's policies, nor
did he want to defend them,
since they are so unpopular," he
said.
"I understand. He had to find
something to talk about that he
felt comfortable talking about,"
I observed.
"Exactly. We were sitting
around Friday night trying to
think of what he could talk
about—the President, the Vice
President, and the bathroom
cabinet. Humphrey himself
ruled out talking about Vietnam
and the cities because of the
delicate problems the Adminis
tration is having in those areas,"
he said.

"Quite understandable," I
nodded.
"And the President asked
Humphrey to forget about talk
ing about his civil rights record.
'Give 'em an inch, and they'll
take Washington,' the President
said."
"That makes sense." I said.
Everything's Taken
"So what was there to talk
about? Talk about beautifica
tion, and Lady Bird would be
offended. Talk about Republi
cans, and conservatives would
be offended. Talk about George
Wallace, and who'd we get for
Vice President?"
"It really is a problem," I
observed.
"First one of the bathroom
cabinet members suggested he
talk about freedom, but Humph
rey pointed out that that
sounded like Communism. Then
someone from Minnesota sug
gested he talk about Commun
ism, but Humphrey pointed out
that that sounded like McCar
thy, Joe McCarthy, but he didn't
want to take any chances on
confusing the voters."
"I see."
"So finally Humphrey himself

lit on it. 'I'll talk about unity,'
he said. 'There's no one who
could argue with unity.' So we
wrote a speech emphasizing un
ity, how the nation should
unite itself behind Humphrey."
"Yes, I heard the speech," I
said knowingly.
Not God or Family
"But we can't keep on talking
unity. It sounds too much like
Nixon. We can't talk about God.
That sounds too much like Rom
ney—you remember Romney.
Why Hubert can't even talk
about his own family. It sounds
too much like Kennedy."
"You certainly do have a prob
lem," I said.
"Yes, but I think it will work
itself out," he said.
"How?" I asked.
"We'll just let the Vice Presi
dent feel his own way. He has
a real knack for knowing what
not to say," he said. "The prob
lem that's really bothering me
now is convincing his wife to
change her name."
"Why would you want to do
that?" I asked.
"Her name is Muriel. How
would you want a First Lady
named after a cigar?"
