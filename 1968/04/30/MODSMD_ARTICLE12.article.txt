Educating More Blacks
Is Rest Money Use
Editor, The Daily:
It seems obvious that there is
no way of deciding whether more
good would be done by giving
money to the King fund or to
the Black Panthers. Good for
whom? In the short or long run?
Obviously all college students,
black and white, could do more
immediate good for the ghettos
by dropping out of school and
going to work in them. But the
long term consequences of such
action would be disastrous for
society (not necessarily for the
students).
Blacks and concerned whites
are justly incensed over the rela
tive lack of immediate progress
in the fight against racism and
its appalling consequences but
this need must not blind us to
the continuing demand for more
well-trained black leaders in the
long years to come. And if the
first student who came here be
cause of the King fund turned
out to be another Martin Luth
er King, what could we then say
of its value?
The argument that the fund
would "benefit only a few black
men a year" is, however, serious
ly mistaken; doubling the en
rollment of minority and low
income students holds immense
potential benefit for the entire
Stanford community. Indeed, I
would maintain that its impact
on the rest of the community is
its primary justification.
Perhaps there is one valid ar
gument in favor of giving the
money to Stanford: we know this
community and its needs and
can in some measure evaluate
over time the outcomes of our
gifts. Most of us, unfortunately,
are less competent to decide how
best to help the ghetto with our
limited personal resources.
