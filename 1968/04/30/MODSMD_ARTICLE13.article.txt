# Letters To The Editor
## Art Dept. Answers Charges 
### 
Edltor, The Daily:
The following observations
concern the letter by 45 students
in last Friday's Daily, in which
the Art Department is accused
of maintaining a "consistently
hypocritical attitude toward stu
dio art and creative expression."
The students cite only three ex
amples, "out of thousands" to
illustrate the Department's hy
pocrisy.
1. They object to the architec
tural quality of the new Art
Building. I wonder on what ba
sis? The building is now begin
ning to rise from its excavated
site. They can have only the dim
mest idea of its future appear
ance. Is it possible that the pre
monition of it has so distressed
them during the current year
that they gave to this com
plaint the first place in their
sampling?
2. The students are indignant
about the future sculpture pro
gram at Stanford. Do they know
what is being planned? So far as
I am aware, they have not taken
the trouble to inform them
selves. Can the thought of sculp
ture's future condition, about
which they have no authentic in
formation, really have given
them such distress as to move
them to make a public com
plaint?
3. The letter writers criticize
the Department for having re
mained silent following the re
cent removal of paintings by one
of our graduate students from
an administrative building on
campus. Neither the exhibition
of these paintings, nor their re
moval, was undertaken under
Departmental auspices. The De
partment is quite ready to de
fend it students from attack,
and has done so on various oc
casions, although this defense
may not necessarily take the
form of manifestos in the Daily.
These are the complaints on
which the students base their
charge of hypocrisy and dishon
esty. There is, in addition, a
passing reference to "token
shows of art." I assume that this
refers to four exhibitions of con
temporary art held at Stanford
during the current year, the
Cowles Collection, the Weisman
Collection, Neo-Dada art, and
Contemporary Graphics. Togeth
er, the four exhibitions included
works by nearly all the more
prominent American artists of
the present. In terms of our re
sources, they represented a very
strenuous effort.
In speaking of the work and
the teaching of the artists who
staff the Art Department at Stan
ford, the students used terms
such as "hypocritical," and
"token," and very broadly im
plied a lack of honesty and truth
in our work. I wonder whether
they realize the full seriousness
of these charges? I do not ques
tion their commitment to art.
Why do they, in a letter of slap
dash composition and minimal
accuracy, feel entitled to ques
tion the integrity of artists and
teachers who have invested their
lives in their art, and in their
teaching, and whose work — for
whatever recognition may be
worth — is respected in the
world of art? Is this not an act
of considerable arrogance? . . .
Students are today helping to
transform the universities. I, for
one, wholeheartedly welcome
their participation. But some
times there rises from among
the constructive debate a spe
cial and familiar voice. The tone
brings to mind the lady on the
hotel terrace who — stridently,
irritably — commands the amb
ling waiter. It is the voice of
large privilege and small com
mitment, the voice of those who
demand all and give little. It
should not be confused with the
authentic voice of protest and
concern.

Little Effects Of Pot
Add Up To Danger
Editor, The Daily:
A number of articles about
marijuana have appeared rec
ently which seek to establish its
harmlessness. The other side of
the picture needs to be seen as
well.
Marijuana, at all effective dos
ages, affects mood and decision
making centers of the brain as
does alcohol only at the level
of drunkenness. Pot, in contrast
to alcohol, has little effect on
the mechanics of body move
ment, whereas the drunk is par
tially protected by being unable
to carry out many of his impet
uous, deluded inclinations. The
pot high lasts more than four
hours, is easily extended, and
is not easily detected by those
who should be warned of the
partial incapacitation of the
potted.
The quality of the mind de
pends on the sum of experiences
in judging whether information
is reliable or false. Chronic ex
posure to conditions which pro
duce hallucination must impart
memory references which may
impair long-term judgment.
Proof that pot is safe or harm
ful will require study of thous
ands of habitual users over
long periods of time to achieve
statistical validity. Proof of de
terioration of health of cigar

ette smokers was established in
this way. The evidence is strong
for physiological, mental, and
social deterioration associated
with prolonged use of mari
juana. Although the Individual
user may congratulate himself
on the negligible effects from
single uses, the accumulation
of small effects may be serious.
The argument that marijuana
may be safe because it has a
ten thousandfold range from the
least effective dose to lethal
levels ignores the fact that ac
cumulation of small Injuries to
mind and body, rather than sud
den death, is the issue. Living
through a harmful experience
is not assurance that no damage
was done. The recuperative ca
pacities and health reserves of
the body are remarkable, but I
advise: Don't waste health on
hallucination.

Courageous New Step
Needs Student Support
Editor, The Daily:
I am quite perplexed by the
attitude of some Stanford stu
dents toward the Martin Luther
King Fund.
Two weeks ago, in the after
math of Dr. King's death, the
discussion focussed on the ques
tion: What Can Stanford Do?
It was observed that Stanford
was a rich, white, racist institu
tion that was doing little if any
thing to help alleviate the plight
of black Americans. This was
followed by the demands of the
Black Student Union that cer
tain steps be taken.
Acting with great courage and
understanding, I think, the Uni
versity has taken almost all
those steps. Although it already
faces large financial deficits in
the future, the university de
cided to undertake new pro
grams that will cost $1.2 million
per year in the future. Vice
President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson has sent out a di
rective asking each unit to find
ways to cut costs so as to help
fund the new work.
In addition, Stanford is fend
ing off the back-lash from some
alumni who object to "watering
down" academic standards or to
Stanford's "capitulation under
duress." It is safe to say that
the university has lost many
gifts as a result.
It is therefore difficult to un
derstand how students—who
loudly demanded that "the Uni
versity" do something to help
solve the problem—can now ob
ject when "the University" has
acted and must find the where
withal to pay for its major new
commitments. Stanford has re
sponded in the best way it can,
and is seeking support from
every source—internally, pri
vate, and governmental.
To me, the argument that
Stanford has "shifted the load
to others" or that money can
better be spent by the Black
Panthers sounds like rationali
zation. Are those who argue for
gifts to the Black Panthers giv
ing themselves to that organi
zation? Or are they merely con
tent to sit at the Union, drink
ing coffee in self-righteous sup
port of the BSU and grumbling
paranoically that anything that
"the University" does is auto
matically wrong?
PETER MULLEN
Army Private Sees
Vast Bureaucracy
Editor, The Daily:
I just saw Pvt. Baxstresser's
letter to the editor in the Daily,
April 18. I was inducted into the
Army on March 13, 1968. Due to
my father's occupation I could
not have refused induction or
fled to Canada without causing
my family severe financial hard
ship.
Pvt. Baxstresser apparently
went into the Army expecting
to find a totally inhuman ma
chine bent upon destroy,
ing him personally. This seems
to be a very popular paranoid
fantasy among certain elements
at Stanford. Now that he has es
caped the forced draft of Stan
ford, the fire of his commitment
has died down.
He is so delighted to discover
human beings in the Army that
he has completely lost sight of
what should have been the real
reason for his opposition to the

draft: not simply what the Army
might do to him, but the entire
nature and purpose of the mili
tary establishment. He is now
another weapon in the hands of
an organization whose purpose
is to impose the policies of the
United States Government on
the rest of the world by force
and violence. He's "The man who
lends his body as a weapon of
the war."
However, Pvt. Baxstresser did
touch upon one very valid point:
the juggernaut will grind you
under if you stand in its way.
More frightening than the fan
tasy of the Army as an inhuman
machine bent upon your destruc
tion as a human being is the re
ality of the Army as a vast bu
reaucracy that can entirely re
fuse to recognize you as a hu
man being.
Personally, I have been treat
ed fairly and well by Army
standards. On April 2 I refused
to participate in any further bay
onet practice. After some un
pleasant name-calling by a
couple of gung-ho sergeants, I
was given a Conscientious Ob
jector application to fill out and
submit. There were a couple of
days of harassment, but I am
now acting as a clerk in the
company office until the Depart
ment of the Army returns a
decision on my application. How
ever, if anyone asks my advice,
I will tell them to avoid the
draft by any means available,
honest or dishonest, short of go
ing to jail. The felony conviction
could be a hassle.
I too would appreciate hear
ing from any of my friends at
Stanford, or from anyone who
has anything to say about this.

No Prejudice But Sex
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to quote from the
international constitution of one
of the Stanford fraternities that
you seem to think are all racial
ly and/or religiously prejudiced.
Article 4, paragraph 2.
Except as otherwise herein
procided, the membership in the
fraternity may be attained only
through membership in an ac
tive chapter, and no candidate
shall be eligible for membership
unless he is a duly accredited
and regularly enrolled under

graduate or graduate student In
good standing and a candidate
for baccalaureate or graduate de
gree in a college or university
in which the fraternity has or is
in the process of establishing an
active chapter.
Article 4, paragraph 5.
Membership shall be limited
to males, and regardless of eli
gibility otherwise, no one who
is a member of any other social
college fraternity shall be eligi
ble for membership.
This is from the constitution
of the Zeta Psi Fraternity of
North America, effective 22
June 1951. Admittedly, this does
exclude from possible member
ship over 50 percent of the na
tion's population and 23.5 per
cent of the Stanford students;
but I am excluded from joining
the DAR and the WCTU, so
there is some discrimination al
ways.
The Zetes have rushed without
the thought of either racial or
religious quotas. They, as other
Stanford fraternities, can only
choose from what is made avail
able to them through the univer
sity admission policies and the
students who want to go through
rushing fraternities. The Zetes
believe in the right of freedom
of association. Students who
have intelligence, a thirst for
education, social graces, a will
ingness to work, call it what you
may, will be asked to join the
Zete fraternity. A student will
be asked to join because of these
and other traits, not because he
may be a Laplander (The Lap
lander ratio within the local Zete
house is below the national aver
age.) and an ethnic balance must
be maintained. If the fraternity
pledges two Laplanders and
thereby achieves a higher ratio
than the nation as a whole,
should one be asked to depledge?
The demonstration houses, the
row houses, the dormitories, off
campus housing, Florence
Moore, and fraternities all have
a place at Stanford. Each one
will appeal to a group of stu
dents. Let each type continue
to appeal to the students, and
don't always jump onto the
"latest and greatest" living sche
me as a panacea that will cure
all social ills, prevent dandruff,
provide a "complete educational
experience," and assure that
everyone will be ASSU president
at least once during his studies
at Stanford.

Little Effects Of Pot

Marijuana, at all effective dos

cumulation of small Injuries to

through a harmful experience
is not assurance that no damage

the body are remarkable, but I
advise: Don't waste health on

ands of habitual users over
long periods of time to achieve
statistical validity. Proof of de
terioration of health of cigar

ette smokers was established in
this way. The evidence is strong
for physiological, mental, and
social deterioration associated
with prolonged use of mari
juana. Although the Individual
user may congratulate himself
on the negligible effects from
single uses, the accumulation
of small effects may be serious.
The argument that marijuana
may be safe because it has a
ten thousandfold range from the
least effective dose to lethal
levels ignores the fact that ac
cumulation of small Injuries to
mind and body, rather than sud
den death, is the issue. Living
through a harmful experience
is not assurance that no damage
was done. The recuperative ca
pacities and health reserves of
the body are remarkable, but I
advise: Don't waste health on
hallucination.

Courageous New Step
Needs Student Support
Editor, The Daily:
I am quite perplexed by the
attitude of some Stanford stu
dents toward the Martin Luther
King Fund.
Two weeks ago, in the after
math of Dr. King's death, the
discussion focussed on the ques
tion: What Can Stanford Do?
It was observed that Stanford
was a rich, white, racist institu
tion that was doing little if any
thing to help alleviate the plight
of black Americans. This was
followed by the demands of the
Black Student Union that cer
tain steps be taken.
Acting with great courage and
understanding, I think, the Uni
versity has taken almost all
those steps. Although it already
faces large financial deficits in
the future, the university de
cided to undertake new pro
grams that will cost $1.2 million
per year in the future. Vice
President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson has sent out a di
rective asking each unit to find
ways to cut costs so as to help
fund the new work.
In addition, Stanford is fend
ing off the back-lash from some
alumni who object to "watering
down" academic standards or to
Stanford's "capitulation under
duress." It is safe to say that
the university has lost many
gifts as a result.
It is therefore difficult to un
derstand how students—who
loudly demanded that "the Uni
versity" do something to help
solve the problem—can now ob
ject when "the University" has
acted and must find the where
withal to pay for its major new
commitments. Stanford has re
sponded in the best way it can,
and is seeking support from
every source—internally, pri
vate, and governmental.
To me, the argument that
Stanford has "shifted the load
to others" or that money can
better be spent by the Black
Panthers sounds like rationali
zation. Are those who argue for
gifts to the Black Panthers giv
ing themselves to that organi
zation? Or are they merely con
tent to sit at the Union, drink
ing coffee in self-righteous sup
port of the BSU and grumbling
paranoically that anything that
"the University" does is auto
matically wrong?
PETER MULLEN
Army Private Sees
Vast Bureaucracy
Editor, The Daily:
I just saw Pvt. Baxstresser's
letter to the editor in the Daily,
April 18. I was inducted into the
Army on March 13, 1968. Due to
my father's occupation I could
not have refused induction or
fled to Canada without causing
my family severe financial hard
ship.
Pvt. Baxstresser apparently
went into the Army expecting
to find a totally inhuman ma
chine bent upon destroy,
ing him personally. This seems
to be a very popular paranoid
fantasy among certain elements
at Stanford. Now that he has es
caped the forced draft of Stan
ford, the fire of his commitment
has died down.
He is so delighted to discover
human beings in the Army that
he has completely lost sight of
what should have been the real
reason for his opposition to the

draft: not simply what the Army
might do to him, but the entire
nature and purpose of the mili
tary establishment. He is now
another weapon in the hands of
an organization whose purpose
is to impose the policies of the
United States Government on
the rest of the world by force
and violence. He's "The man who
lends his body as a weapon of
the war."
However, Pvt. Baxstresser did
touch upon one very valid point:
the juggernaut will grind you
under if you stand in its way.
More frightening than the fan
tasy of the Army as an inhuman
machine bent upon your destruc
tion as a human being is the re
ality of the Army as a vast bu
reaucracy that can entirely re
fuse to recognize you as a hu
man being.
Personally, I have been treat
ed fairly and well by Army
standards. On April 2 I refused
to participate in any further bay
onet practice. After some un
pleasant name-calling by a
couple of gung-ho sergeants, I
was given a Conscientious Ob
jector application to fill out and
submit. There were a couple of
days of harassment, but I am
now acting as a clerk in the
company office until the Depart
ment of the Army returns a
decision on my application. How
ever, if anyone asks my advice,
I will tell them to avoid the
draft by any means available,
honest or dishonest, short of go
ing to jail. The felony conviction
could be a hassle.
I too would appreciate hear
ing from any of my friends at
Stanford, or from anyone who
has anything to say about this.

No Prejudice But Sex
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to quote from the
international constitution of one
of the Stanford fraternities that
you seem to think are all racial
ly and/or religiously prejudiced.
Article 4, paragraph 2.
Except as otherwise herein
procided, the membership in the
fraternity may be attained only
through membership in an ac
tive chapter, and no candidate
shall be eligible for membership
unless he is a duly accredited
and regularly enrolled under

graduate or graduate student In
good standing and a candidate
for baccalaureate or graduate de
gree in a college or university
in which the fraternity has or is
in the process of establishing an
active chapter.
Article 4, paragraph 5.
Membership shall be limited
to males, and regardless of eli
gibility otherwise, no one who
is a member of any other social
college fraternity shall be eligi
ble for membership.
This is from the constitution
of the Zeta Psi Fraternity of
North America, effective 22
June 1951. Admittedly, this does
exclude from possible member
ship over 50 percent of the na
tion's population and 23.5 per
cent of the Stanford students;
but I am excluded from joining
the DAR and the WCTU, so
there is some discrimination al
ways.
The Zetes have rushed without
the thought of either racial or
religious quotas. They, as other
Stanford fraternities, can only
choose from what is made avail
able to them through the univer
sity admission policies and the
students who want to go through
rushing fraternities. The Zetes
believe in the right of freedom
of association. Students who
have intelligence, a thirst for
education, social graces, a will
ingness to work, call it what you
may, will be asked to join the
Zete fraternity. A student will
be asked to join because of these
and other traits, not because he
may be a Laplander (The Lap
lander ratio within the local Zete
house is below the national aver
age.) and an ethnic balance must
be maintained. If the fraternity
pledges two Laplanders and
thereby achieves a higher ratio
than the nation as a whole,
should one be asked to depledge?
The demonstration houses, the
row houses, the dormitories, off
campus housing, Florence
Moore, and fraternities all have
a place at Stanford. Each one
will appeal to a group of stu
dents. Let each type continue
to appeal to the students, and
don't always jump onto the
"latest and greatest" living sche
me as a panacea that will cure
all social ills, prevent dandruff,
provide a "complete educational
experience," and assure that
everyone will be ASSU president
at least once during his studies
at Stanford.
A. D. KIRKLAND
Director, Region Two,
Zeta Psi Fraternity
Edltor, The Daily:
The following observations
concern the letter by 45 students
in last Friday's Daily, in which
the Art Department is accused
of maintaining a "consistently
hypocritical attitude toward stu
dio art and creative expression."
The students cite only three ex
amples, "out of thousands" to
illustrate the Department's hy
pocrisy.
1. They object to the architec
tural quality of the new Art
Building. I wonder on what ba
sis? The building is now begin
ning to rise from its excavated
site. They can have only the dim
mest idea of its future appear
ance. Is it possible that the pre
monition of it has so distressed
them during the current year
that they gave to this com
plaint the first place in their
sampling?
2. The students are indignant
about the future sculpture pro
gram at Stanford. Do they know
what is being planned? So far as
I am aware, they have not taken
the trouble to inform them
selves. Can the thought of sculp
ture's future condition, about
which they have no authentic in
formation, really have given
them such distress as to move
them to make a public com
plaint?
3. The letter writers criticize
the Department for having re
mained silent following the re
cent removal of paintings by one
of our graduate students from
an administrative building on
campus. Neither the exhibition
of these paintings, nor their re
moval, was undertaken under
Departmental auspices. The De
partment is quite ready to de
fend it students from attack,
and has done so on various oc
casions, although this defense
may not necessarily take the
form of manifestos in the Daily.
These are the complaints on
which the students base their
charge of hypocrisy and dishon
esty. There is, in addition, a
passing reference to "token
shows of art." I assume that this
refers to four exhibitions of con
temporary art held at Stanford
during the current year, the
Cowles Collection, the Weisman
Collection, Neo-Dada art, and
Contemporary Graphics. Togeth
er, the four exhibitions included
works by nearly all the more
prominent American artists of
the present. In terms of our re
sources, they represented a very
strenuous effort.
In speaking of the work and
the teaching of the artists who
staff the Art Department at Stan
ford, the students used terms
such as "hypocritical," and
"token," and very broadly im
plied a lack of honesty and truth
in our work. I wonder whether
they realize the full seriousness
of these charges? I do not ques
tion their commitment to art.
Why do they, in a letter of slap
dash composition and minimal
accuracy, feel entitled to ques
tion the integrity of artists and
teachers who have invested their
lives in their art, and in their
teaching, and whose work — for
whatever recognition may be
worth — is respected in the
world of art? Is this not an act
of considerable arrogance? . . .
Students are today helping to
transform the universities. I, for
one, wholeheartedly welcome
their participation. But some
times there rises from among
the constructive debate a spe
cial and familiar voice. The tone
brings to mind the lady on the
hotel terrace who — stridently,
irritably — commands the amb
ling waiter. It is the voice of
large privilege and small com
mitment, the voice of those who
demand all and give little. It
should not be confused with the
authentic voice of protest and
concern.

Little Effects Of Pot
Add Up To Danger
Editor, The Daily:
A number of articles about
marijuana have appeared rec
ently which seek to establish its
harmlessness. The other side of
the picture needs to be seen as
well.
Marijuana, at all effective dos
ages, affects mood and decision
making centers of the brain as
does alcohol only at the level
of drunkenness. Pot, in contrast
to alcohol, has little effect on
the mechanics of body move
ment, whereas the drunk is par
tially protected by being unable
to carry out many of his impet
uous, deluded inclinations. The
pot high lasts more than four
hours, is easily extended, and
is not easily detected by those
who should be warned of the
partial incapacitation of the
potted.
The quality of the mind de
pends on the sum of experiences
in judging whether information
is reliable or false. Chronic ex
posure to conditions which pro
duce hallucination must impart
memory references which may
impair long-term judgment.
Proof that pot is safe or harm
ful will require study of thous
ands of habitual users over
long periods of time to achieve
statistical validity. Proof of de
terioration of health of cigar

ette smokers was established in
this way. The evidence is strong
for physiological, mental, and
social deterioration associated
with prolonged use of mari
juana. Although the Individual
user may congratulate himself
on the negligible effects from
single uses, the accumulation
of small effects may be serious.
The argument that marijuana
may be safe because it has a
ten thousandfold range from the
least effective dose to lethal
levels ignores the fact that ac
cumulation of small Injuries to
mind and body, rather than sud
den death, is the issue. Living
through a harmful experience
is not assurance that no damage

the body are remarkable, but I
advise: Don't waste health on

Personally, I have been treat

was given a Conscientious Ob

submit. There were a couple of
days of harassment, but I am
now acting as a clerk in the

ever, if anyone asks my advice,
I will tell them to avoid the
draft by any means available,
honest or dishonest, short of go

I too would appreciate hear

No Prejudice But Sex
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to quote from the
international constitution of one
of the Stanford fraternities that
you seem to think are all racial
ly and/or religiously prejudiced.
Article 4, paragraph 2.
Except as otherwise herein
procided, the membership in the
fraternity may be attained only
through membership in an ac
tive chapter, and no candidate
shall be eligible for membership
unless he is a duly accredited
and regularly enrolled under

graduate or graduate student In
good standing and a candidate
for baccalaureate or graduate de
gree in a college or university
in which the fraternity has or is
in the process of establishing an
active chapter.
Article 4, paragraph 5.
Membership shall be limited
to males, and regardless of eli
gibility otherwise, no one who
is a member of any other social
college fraternity shall be eligi
ble for membership.
This is from the constitution
of the Zeta Psi Fraternity of
North America, effective 22
June 1951. Admittedly, this does
exclude from possible member
ship over 50 percent of the na
tion's population and 23.5 per
cent of the Stanford students;
but I am excluded from joining
the DAR and the WCTU, so
there is some discrimination al
ways.
The Zetes have rushed without
the thought of either racial or
religious quotas. They, as other
Stanford fraternities, can only
choose from what is made avail
able to them through the univer
sity admission policies and the
students who want to go through
rushing fraternities. The Zetes
believe in the right of freedom
of association. Students who
have intelligence, a thirst for
education, social graces, a will
ingness to work, call it what you
may, will be asked to join the
Zete fraternity. A student will
be asked to join because of these
and other traits, not because he
may be a Laplander (The Lap
lander ratio within the local Zete
house is below the national aver
age.) and an ethnic balance must
be maintained. If the fraternity
pledges two Laplanders and
thereby achieves a higher ratio
than the nation as a whole,
should one be asked to depledge?
The demonstration houses, the
row houses, the dormitories, off
campus housing, Florence
Moore, and fraternities all have
a place at Stanford. Each one
will appeal to a group of stu
dents. Let each type continue
to appeal to the students, and
don't always jump onto the
"latest and greatest" living sche
me as a panacea that will cure
all social ills, prevent dandruff,
provide a "complete educational
experience," and assure that
everyone will be ASSU president
at least once during his studies
at Stanford.
A. D. KIRKLAND
Director, Region Two,
Zeta Psi Fraternity
Edltor, The Daily:
The following observations
concern the letter by 45 students
in last Friday's Daily, in which
the Art Department is accused
of maintaining a "consistently
hypocritical attitude toward stu
dio art and creative expression."
The students cite only three ex
amples, "out of thousands" to
illustrate the Department's hy
pocrisy.
1. They object to the architec
tural quality of the new Art
Building. I wonder on what ba
sis? The building is now begin
ning to rise from its excavated
site. They can have only the dim
mest idea of its future appear
ance. Is it possible that the pre
monition of it has so distressed
them during the current year
that they gave to this com
plaint the first place in their
sampling?
2. The students are indignant
about the future sculpture pro
gram at Stanford. Do they know
what is being planned? So far as
I am aware, they have not taken
the trouble to inform them
selves. Can the thought of sculp
ture's future condition, about
which they have no authentic in
formation, really have given
them such distress as to move
them to make a public com
plaint?
3. The letter writers criticize
the Department for having re
mained silent following the re
cent removal of paintings by one
of our graduate students from
an administrative building on
campus. Neither the exhibition
of these paintings, nor their re
moval, was undertaken under
Departmental auspices. The De
partment is quite ready to de
fend it students from attack,
and has done so on various oc
casions, although this defense
may not necessarily take the
form of manifestos in the Daily.
These are the complaints on
which the students base their
charge of hypocrisy and dishon
esty. There is, in addition, a
passing reference to "token
shows of art." I assume that this
refers to four exhibitions of con
temporary art held at Stanford
during the current year, the
Cowles Collection, the Weisman
Collection, Neo-Dada art, and
Contemporary Graphics. Togeth
er, the four exhibitions included
works by nearly all the more
prominent American artists of
the present. In terms of our re
sources, they represented a very
strenuous effort.
In speaking of the work and
the teaching of the artists who
staff the Art Department at Stan
ford, the students used terms
such as "hypocritical," and
"token," and very broadly im
plied a lack of honesty and truth
in our work. I wonder whether
they realize the full seriousness
of these charges? I do not ques
tion their commitment to art.
Why do they, in a letter of slap
dash composition and minimal
accuracy, feel entitled to ques
tion the integrity of artists and
teachers who have invested their
lives in their art, and in their
teaching, and whose work — for
whatever recognition may be
worth — is respected in the
world of art? Is this not an act
of considerable arrogance? . . .
Students are today helping to
transform the universities. I, for
one, wholeheartedly welcome
their participation. But some
times there rises from among
the constructive debate a spe
cial and familiar voice. The tone
brings to mind the lady on the
hotel terrace who — stridently,
irritably — commands the amb
ling waiter. It is the voice of
large privilege and small com
mitment, the voice of those who
demand all and give little. It
should not be confused with the
authentic voice of protest and
concern.

Little Effects Of Pot
Add Up To Danger
Editor, The Daily:
A number of articles about
marijuana have appeared rec
ently which seek to establish its
harmlessness. The other side of
the picture needs to be seen as
well.
Marijuana, at all effective dos
ages, affects mood and decision
making centers of the brain as
does alcohol only at the level
of drunkenness. Pot, in contrast
to alcohol, has little effect on
the mechanics of body move
ment, whereas the drunk is par
tially protected by being unable
to carry out many of his impet
uous, deluded inclinations. The
pot high lasts more than four
hours, is easily extended, and
is not easily detected by those
who should be warned of the
partial incapacitation of the
potted.
The quality of the mind de
pends on the sum of experiences
in judging whether information
is reliable or false. Chronic ex
posure to conditions which pro
duce hallucination must impart
memory references which may
impair long-term judgment.
Proof that pot is safe or harm
ful will require study of thous
ands of habitual users over
long periods of time to achieve
statistical validity. Proof of de
terioration of health of cigar

ette smokers was established in
this way. The evidence is strong
for physiological, mental, and
social deterioration associated
with prolonged use of mari
juana. Although the Individual
user may congratulate himself
on the negligible effects from
single uses, the accumulation
of small effects may be serious.
The argument that marijuana
may be safe because it has a
ten thousandfold range from the
least effective dose to lethal
levels ignores the fact that ac
cumulation of small Injuries to
mind and body, rather than sud
den death, is the issue. Living
through a harmful experience
is not assurance that no damage
was done. The recuperative ca
pacities and health reserves of
the body are remarkable, but I
advise: Don't waste health on
hallucination.

Courageous New Step
Needs Student Support
Editor, The Daily:
I am quite perplexed by the
attitude of some Stanford stu
dents toward the Martin Luther
King Fund.
Two weeks ago, in the after
math of Dr. King's death, the
discussion focussed on the ques
tion: What Can Stanford Do?
It was observed that Stanford
was a rich, white, racist institu
tion that was doing little if any
thing to help alleviate the plight
of black Americans. This was
followed by the demands of the
Black Student Union that cer
tain steps be taken.
Acting with great courage and
understanding, I think, the Uni
versity has taken almost all
those steps. Although it already
faces large financial deficits in
the future, the university de
cided to undertake new pro
grams that will cost $1.2 million
per year in the future. Vice
President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson has sent out a di
rective asking each unit to find
ways to cut costs so as to help
fund the new work.
In addition, Stanford is fend
ing off the back-lash from some
alumni who object to "watering
down" academic standards or to
Stanford's "capitulation under
duress." It is safe to say that
the university has lost many
gifts as a result.
It is therefore difficult to un
derstand how students—who
loudly demanded that "the Uni
versity" do something to help
solve the problem—can now ob
ject when "the University" has
acted and must find the where
withal to pay for its major new
commitments. Stanford has re
sponded in the best way it can,
and is seeking support from
every source—internally, pri
vate, and governmental.
To me, the argument that
Stanford has "shifted the load
to others" or that money can
better be spent by the Black
Panthers sounds like rationali
zation. Are those who argue for
gifts to the Black Panthers giv
ing themselves to that organi
zation? Or are they merely con
tent to sit at the Union, drink
ing coffee in self-righteous sup
port of the BSU and grumbling
paranoically that anything that
"the University" does is auto
matically wrong?
PETER MULLEN
Army Private Sees
Vast Bureaucracy
Editor, The Daily:
I just saw Pvt. Baxstresser's
letter to the editor in the Daily,
April 18. I was inducted into the
Army on March 13, 1968. Due to
my father's occupation I could
not have refused induction or
fled to Canada without causing
my family severe financial hard
ship.
Pvt. Baxstresser apparently
went into the Army expecting
to find a totally inhuman ma
chine bent upon destroy,
ing him personally. This seems
to be a very popular paranoid
fantasy among certain elements
at Stanford. Now that he has es
caped the forced draft of Stan
ford, the fire of his commitment
has died down.
He is so delighted to discover
human beings in the Army that
he has completely lost sight of
what should have been the real
reason for his opposition to the

draft: not simply what the Army
might do to him, but the entire
nature and purpose of the mili
tary establishment. He is now
another weapon in the hands of
an organization whose purpose
is to impose the policies of the
United States Government on
the rest of the world by force
and violence. He's "The man who
lends his body as a weapon of
the war."
However, Pvt. Baxstresser did
touch upon one very valid point:
the juggernaut will grind you
under if you stand in its way.
More frightening than the fan
tasy of the Army as an inhuman
machine bent upon your destruc
tion as a human being is the re
ality of the Army as a vast bu
reaucracy that can entirely re
fuse to recognize you as a hu
man being.
Personally, I have been treat

Little Effects Of Pot
Add Up To Danger
Editor, The Daily:
A number of articles about
marijuana have appeared rec

harmlessness. The other side of
the picture needs to be seen as
well.
Marijuana, at all effective dos
ages, affects mood and decision
making centers of the brain as
does alcohol only at the level
of drunkenness. Pot, in contrast
to alcohol, has little effect on
the mechanics of body move
ment, whereas the drunk is par
tially protected by being unable
to carry out many of his impet
uous, deluded inclinations. The
pot high lasts more than four
hours, is easily extended, and
is not easily detected by those
who should be warned of the
partial incapacitation of the
potted.
The quality of the mind de
pends on the sum of experiences
in judging whether information
is reliable or false. Chronic ex
posure to conditions which pro
duce hallucination must impart
memory references which may
impair long-term judgment.
Proof that pot is safe or harm
ful will require study of thous
ands of habitual users over
long periods of time to achieve
statistical validity. Proof of de

this way. The evidence is strong
for physiological, mental, and

The argument that marijuana
may be safe because it has a
ten thousandfold range from the
least effective dose to lethal
levels ignores the fact that ac
cumulation of small Injuries to
mind and body, rather than sud
den death, is the issue. Living
through a harmful experience
is not assurance that no damage
was done. The recuperative ca

the body are remarkable, but I
advise: Don't waste health on
hallucination.

ning to rise from its excavated
site. They can have only the dim
mest idea of its future appear
ance. Is it possible that the pre
monition of it has so distressed
them during the current year
that they gave to this com
plaint the first place in their
sampling?
2. The students are indignant
about the future sculpture pro
gram at Stanford. Do they know
what is being planned? So far as
I am aware, they have not taken
the trouble to inform them
selves. Can the thought of sculp
ture's future condition, about
which they have no authentic in
formation, really have given
them such distress as to move
them to make a public com
plaint?
3. The letter writers criticize
the Department for having re
mained silent following the re
cent removal of paintings by one
of our graduate students from
an administrative building on
campus. Neither the exhibition
of these paintings, nor their re
moval, was undertaken under
Departmental auspices. The De
partment is quite ready to de
fend it students from attack,
and has done so on various oc
casions, although this defense
may not necessarily take the
form of manifestos in the Daily.
These are the complaints on
which the students base their
charge of hypocrisy and dishon
esty. There is, in addition, a
passing reference to "token
shows of art." I assume that this
refers to four exhibitions of con
temporary art held at Stanford
during the current year, the
Cowles Collection, the Weisman
Collection, Neo-Dada art, and
Contemporary Graphics. Togeth
er, the four exhibitions included
works by nearly all the more
prominent American artists of
the present. In terms of our re
sources, they represented a very
strenuous effort.
In speaking of the work and
the teaching of the artists who
staff the Art Department at Stan
ford, the students used terms
such as "hypocritical," and
"token," and very broadly im
plied a lack of honesty and truth
in our work. I wonder whether
they realize the full seriousness
of these charges? I do not ques
tion their commitment to art.
Why do they, in a letter of slap
dash composition and minimal
accuracy, feel entitled to ques
tion the integrity of artists and
teachers who have invested their
lives in their art, and in their
teaching, and whose work — for
whatever recognition may be
worth — is respected in the
world of art? Is this not an act
of considerable arrogance? . . .
Students are today helping to
transform the universities. I, for
one, wholeheartedly welcome
their participation. But some
times there rises from among
the constructive debate a spe
cial and familiar voice. The tone
brings to mind the lady on the
hotel terrace who — stridently,
irritably — commands the amb
ling waiter. It is the voice of
large privilege and small com
mitment, the voice of those who
demand all and give little. It
should not be confused with the
authentic voice of protest and
concern.

Little Effects Of Pot
Add Up To Danger
Editor, The Daily:
A number of articles about
marijuana have appeared rec
ently which seek to establish its
harmlessness. The other side of
the picture needs to be seen as
well.
Marijuana, at all effective dos
ages, affects mood and decision
making centers of the brain as
does alcohol only at the level
of drunkenness. Pot, in contrast
to alcohol, has little effect on
the mechanics of body move
ment, whereas the drunk is par
tially protected by being unable
to carry out many of his impet
uous, deluded inclinations. The
pot high lasts more than four
hours, is easily extended, and
is not easily detected by those
who should be warned of the
partial incapacitation of the
potted.
The quality of the mind de
pends on the sum of experiences
in judging whether information
is reliable or false. Chronic ex
posure to conditions which pro
duce hallucination must impart
memory references which may
impair long-term judgment.
Proof that pot is safe or harm
ful will require study of thous
ands of habitual users over
long periods of time to achieve
statistical validity. Proof of de
terioration of health of cigar

ette smokers was established in
this way. The evidence is strong
for physiological, mental, and
social deterioration associated
with prolonged use of mari
juana. Although the Individual
user may congratulate himself
on the negligible effects from
single uses, the accumulation
of small effects may be serious.
The argument that marijuana
may be safe because it has a
ten thousandfold range from the
least effective dose to lethal
levels ignores the fact that ac
cumulation of small Injuries to
mind and body, rather than sud
den death, is the issue. Living
through a harmful experience
is not assurance that no damage
was done. The recuperative ca
pacities and health reserves of
the body are remarkable, but I
advise: Don't waste health on
hallucination.

Courageous New Step
Needs Student Support
Editor, The Daily:
I am quite perplexed by the
attitude of some Stanford stu
dents toward the Martin Luther
King Fund.
Two weeks ago, in the after
math of Dr. King's death, the
discussion focussed on the ques
tion: What Can Stanford Do?
It was observed that Stanford
was a rich, white, racist institu
tion that was doing little if any
thing to help alleviate the plight
of black Americans. This was
followed by the demands of the
Black Student Union that cer
tain steps be taken.
Acting with great courage and
understanding, I think, the Uni
versity has taken almost all
those steps. Although it already
faces large financial deficits in
the future, the university de
cided to undertake new pro
grams that will cost $1.2 million
per year in the future. Vice
President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson has sent out a di
rective asking each unit to find
ways to cut costs so as to help
fund the new work.
In addition, Stanford is fend
ing off the back-lash from some
alumni who object to "watering
down" academic standards or to
Stanford's "capitulation under
duress." It is safe to say that
the university has lost many
gifts as a result.
It is therefore difficult to un
derstand how students—who
loudly demanded that "the Uni
versity" do something to help
solve the problem—can now ob
ject when "the University" has
acted and must find the where
withal to pay for its major new
commitments. Stanford has re
sponded in the best way it can,
and is seeking support from
every source—internally, pri
vate, and governmental.
To me, the argument that
Stanford has "shifted the load
to others" or that money can
better be spent by the Black
Panthers sounds like rationali
zation. Are those who argue for
gifts to the Black Panthers giv
ing themselves to that organi
zation? Or are they merely con
tent to sit at the Union, drink
ing coffee in self-righteous sup
port of the BSU and grumbling
paranoically that anything that
"the University" does is auto
matically wrong?
PETER MULLEN
Army Private Sees
Vast Bureaucracy
Editor, The Daily:
I just saw Pvt. Baxstresser's
letter to the editor in the Daily,
April 18. I was inducted into the
Army on March 13, 1968. Due to
my father's occupation I could
not have refused induction or
fled to Canada without causing
my family severe financial hard
ship.
Pvt. Baxstresser apparently
went into the Army expecting
to find a totally inhuman ma
chine bent upon destroy,
ing him personally. This seems
to be a very popular paranoid
fantasy among certain elements
at Stanford. Now that he has es
caped the forced draft of Stan
ford, the fire of his commitment
has died down.
He is so delighted to discover
human beings in the Army that
he has completely lost sight of
what should have been the real
reason for his opposition to the

draft: not simply what the Army
might do to him, but the entire
nature and purpose of the mili
tary establishment. He is now
another weapon in the hands of
an organization whose purpose
is to impose the policies of the
United States Government on
the rest of the world by force
and violence. He's "The man who
lends his body as a weapon of
the war."
However, Pvt. Baxstresser did
touch upon one very valid point:
the juggernaut will grind you
under if you stand in its way.
More frightening than the fan
tasy of the Army as an inhuman
machine bent upon your destruc
tion as a human being is the re
ality of the Army as a vast bu
reaucracy that can entirely re
fuse to recognize you as a hu
man being.
Personally, I have been treat
ed fairly and well by Army
standards. On April 2 I refused
to participate in any further bay
onet practice. After some un
pleasant name-calling by a
couple of gung-ho sergeants, I
was given a Conscientious Ob
jector application to fill out and
submit. There were a couple of
days of harassment, but I am
now acting as a clerk in the
company office until the Depart
ment of the Army returns a
decision on my application. How
ever, if anyone asks my advice,
I will tell them to avoid the
draft by any means available,
honest or dishonest, short of go
ing to jail. The felony conviction
could be a hassle.
I too would appreciate hear
ing from any of my friends at
Stanford, or from anyone who
has anything to say about this.

No Prejudice But Sex
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to quote from the
international constitution of one
of the Stanford fraternities that
you seem to think are all racial
ly and/or religiously prejudiced.
Article 4, paragraph 2.
Except as otherwise herein
procided, the membership in the
fraternity may be attained only
through membership in an ac
tive chapter, and no candidate
shall be eligible for membership
unless he is a duly accredited
and regularly enrolled under

graduate or graduate student In
good standing and a candidate
for baccalaureate or graduate de
gree in a college or university
in which the fraternity has or is
in the process of establishing an
active chapter.
Article 4, paragraph 5.
Membership shall be limited
to males, and regardless of eli
gibility otherwise, no one who
is a member of any other social
college fraternity shall be eligi
ble for membership.
This is from the constitution
of the Zeta Psi Fraternity of
North America, effective 22
June 1951. Admittedly, this does
exclude from possible member
ship over 50 percent of the na
tion's population and 23.5 per
cent of the Stanford students;
but I am excluded from joining
the DAR and the WCTU, so
there is some discrimination al
ways.
The Zetes have rushed without
the thought of either racial or
religious quotas. They, as other
Stanford fraternities, can only
choose from what is made avail
able to them through the univer
sity admission policies and the
students who want to go through
rushing fraternities. The Zetes
believe in the right of freedom
of association. Students who
have intelligence, a thirst for
education, social graces, a will
ingness to work, call it what you
may, will be asked to join the
Zete fraternity. A student will
be asked to join because of these
and other traits, not because he
may be a Laplander (The Lap
lander ratio within the local Zete
house is below the national aver
age.) and an ethnic balance must
be maintained. If the fraternity
pledges two Laplanders and
thereby achieves a higher ratio
than the nation as a whole,
should one be asked to depledge?
The demonstration houses, the
row houses, the dormitories, off
campus housing, Florence
Moore, and fraternities all have
a place at Stanford. Each one
will appeal to a group of stu
dents. Let each type continue
to appeal to the students, and
don't always jump onto the
"latest and greatest" living sche
me as a panacea that will cure
all social ills, prevent dandruff,
provide a "complete educational
experience," and assure that
everyone will be ASSU president
at least once during his studies
at Stanford.
A. D. KIRKLAND

Edltor, The Daily:
The following observations
concern the letter by 45 students
in last Friday's Daily, in which
the Art Department is accused
of maintaining a "consistently
hypocritical attitude toward stu
dio art and creative expression."
The students cite only three ex
amples, "out of thousands" to
illustrate the Department's hy
pocrisy.
1. They object to the architec
tural quality of the new Art
Building. I wonder on what ba
sis? The building is now begin

2. The students are indignant

what is being planned? So far as
I am aware, they have not taken

which they have no authentic in

them such distress as to move
them to make a public com

3. The letter writers criticize

levels ignores the fact that ac
cumulation of small Injuries to
mind and body, rather than sud
den death, is the issue. Living
through a harmful experience
is not assurance that no damage
was done. The recuperative ca
pacities and health reserves of
the body are remarkable, but I
advise: Don't waste health on
hallucination.

Courageous New Step
Needs Student Support
Editor, The Daily:
I am quite perplexed by the
attitude of some Stanford stu
dents toward the Martin Luther
King Fund.
Two weeks ago, in the after
math of Dr. King's death, the
discussion focussed on the ques
tion: What Can Stanford Do?
It was observed that Stanford
was a rich, white, racist institu
tion that was doing little if any
thing to help alleviate the plight
of black Americans. This was
followed by the demands of the
Black Student Union that cer
tain steps be taken.
Acting with great courage and
understanding, I think, the Uni
versity has taken almost all
those steps. Although it already
faces large financial deficits in
the future, the university de
cided to undertake new pro
grams that will cost $1.2 million
per year in the future. Vice
President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson has sent out a di
rective asking each unit to find
ways to cut costs so as to help
fund the new work.
In addition, Stanford is fend
ing off the back-lash from some
alumni who object to "watering
down" academic standards or to
Stanford's "capitulation under
duress." It is safe to say that
the university has lost many
gifts as a result.
It is therefore difficult to un
derstand how students—who
loudly demanded that "the Uni
versity" do something to help
solve the problem—can now ob
ject when "the University" has
acted and must find the where
withal to pay for its major new
commitments. Stanford has re
sponded in the best way it can,
and is seeking support from
every source—internally, pri
vate, and governmental.
To me, the argument that
Stanford has "shifted the load
to others" or that money can
better be spent by the Black
Panthers sounds like rationali
zation. Are those who argue for
gifts to the Black Panthers giv
ing themselves to that organi
zation? Or are they merely con
tent to sit at the Union, drink
ing coffee in self-righteous sup
port of the BSU and grumbling
paranoically that anything that
"the University" does is auto
matically wrong?
PETER MULLEN
Army Private Sees
Vast Bureaucracy
Editor, The Daily:
I just saw Pvt. Baxstresser's
letter to the editor in the Daily,
April 18. I was inducted into the
Army on March 13, 1968. Due to
my father's occupation I could
not have refused induction or
fled to Canada without causing
my family severe financial hard
ship.
Pvt. Baxstresser apparently
went into the Army expecting
to find a totally inhuman ma
chine bent upon destroy,
ing him personally. This seems
to be a very popular paranoid
fantasy among certain elements
at Stanford. Now that he has es
caped the forced draft of Stan
ford, the fire of his commitment
has died down.
He is so delighted to discover
human beings in the Army that
he has completely lost sight of
what should have been the real
reason for his opposition to the

draft: not simply what the Army
might do to him, but the entire
nature and purpose of the mili
tary establishment. He is now
another weapon in the hands of
an organization whose purpose
is to impose the policies of the
United States Government on
the rest of the world by force
and violence. He's "The man who
lends his body as a weapon of
the war."
However, Pvt. Baxstresser did
touch upon one very valid point:
the juggernaut will grind you
under if you stand in its way.
More frightening than the fan
tasy of the Army as an inhuman
machine bent upon your destruc
tion as a human being is the re
ality of the Army as a vast bu
reaucracy that can entirely re
fuse to recognize you as a hu
man being.
Personally, I have been treat
ed fairly and well by Army
standards. On April 2 I refused
to participate in any further bay
onet practice. After some un
pleasant name-calling by a
couple of gung-ho sergeants, I
was given a Conscientious Ob
jector application to fill out and
submit. There were a couple of
days of harassment, but I am
now acting as a clerk in the
company office until the Depart
ment of the Army returns a
decision on my application. How
ever, if anyone asks my advice,
I will tell them to avoid the
draft by any means available,
honest or dishonest, short of go
ing to jail. The felony conviction
could be a hassle.
I too would appreciate hear
ing from any of my friends at
Stanford, or from anyone who
has anything to say about this.

No Prejudice But Sex
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to quote from the
international constitution of one
of the Stanford fraternities that
you seem to think are all racial
ly and/or religiously prejudiced.
Article 4, paragraph 2.
Except as otherwise herein
procided, the membership in the
fraternity may be attained only
through membership in an ac
tive chapter, and no candidate
shall be eligible for membership
unless he is a duly accredited
and regularly enrolled under

graduate or graduate student In
good standing and a candidate
for baccalaureate or graduate de
gree in a college or university
in which the fraternity has or is
in the process of establishing an
active chapter.
Article 4, paragraph 5.
Membership shall be limited
to males, and regardless of eli
gibility otherwise, no one who
is a member of any other social
college fraternity shall be eligi
ble for membership.
This is from the constitution
of the Zeta Psi Fraternity of
North America, effective 22
June 1951. Admittedly, this does
exclude from possible member
ship over 50 percent of the na
tion's population and 23.5 per
cent of the Stanford students;
but I am excluded from joining
the DAR and the WCTU, so
there is some discrimination al
ways.
The Zetes have rushed without
the thought of either racial or
religious quotas. They, as other
Stanford fraternities, can only
choose from what is made avail
able to them through the univer
sity admission policies and the
students who want to go through
rushing fraternities. The Zetes
believe in the right of freedom
of association. Students who
have intelligence, a thirst for
education, social graces, a will
ingness to work, call it what you
may, will be asked to join the
Zete fraternity. A student will
be asked to join because of these
and other traits, not because he
may be a Laplander (The Lap
lander ratio within the local Zete
house is below the national aver
age.) and an ethnic balance must
be maintained. If the fraternity
pledges two Laplanders and
thereby achieves a higher ratio
than the nation as a whole,
should one be asked to depledge?
The demonstration houses, the
row houses, the dormitories, off
campus housing, Florence
Moore, and fraternities all have
a place at Stanford. Each one
will appeal to a group of stu
dents. Let each type continue
to appeal to the students, and
don't always jump onto the
"latest and greatest" living sche
me as a panacea that will cure
all social ills, prevent dandruff,
provide a "complete educational
experience," and assure that
everyone will be ASSU president
at least once during his studies
at Stanford.
A. D. KIRKLAND
Director, Region Two,
Zeta Psi Fraternity
Edltor, The Daily:
The following observations
concern the letter by 45 students
in last Friday's Daily, in which
the Art Department is accused
of maintaining a "consistently
hypocritical attitude toward stu
dio art and creative expression."
The students cite only three ex
amples, "out of thousands" to
illustrate the Department's hy
pocrisy.
1. They object to the architec
tural quality of the new Art
Building. I wonder on what ba
sis? The building is now begin
ning to rise from its excavated
site. They can have only the dim
mest idea of its future appear
ance. Is it possible that the pre
monition of it has so distressed
them during the current year
that they gave to this com
plaint the first place in their
sampling?
2. The students are indignant
about the future sculpture pro
gram at Stanford. Do they know
what is being planned? So far as
I am aware, they have not taken
the trouble to inform them
selves. Can the thought of sculp
ture's future condition, about
which they have no authentic in
formation, really have given
them such distress as to move
them to make a public com
plaint?
3. The letter writers criticize
the Department for having re
mained silent following the re
cent removal of paintings by one
of our graduate students from
an administrative building on
campus. Neither the exhibition
of these paintings, nor their re
moval, was undertaken under
Departmental auspices. The De
partment is quite ready to de
fend it students from attack,
and has done so on various oc
casions, although this defense
may not necessarily take the
form of manifestos in the Daily.
These are the complaints on
which the students base their
charge of hypocrisy and dishon
esty. There is, in addition, a
passing reference to "token
shows of art." I assume that this
refers to four exhibitions of con
temporary art held at Stanford
during the current year, the
Cowles Collection, the Weisman
Collection, Neo-Dada art, and
Contemporary Graphics. Togeth
er, the four exhibitions included
works by nearly all the more
prominent American artists of
the present. In terms of our re
sources, they represented a very
strenuous effort.
In speaking of the work and
the teaching of the artists who
staff the Art Department at Stan
ford, the students used terms
such as "hypocritical," and
"token," and very broadly im
plied a lack of honesty and truth
in our work. I wonder whether
they realize the full seriousness
of these charges? I do not ques
tion their commitment to art.
Why do they, in a letter of slap
dash composition and minimal
accuracy, feel entitled to ques
tion the integrity of artists and
teachers who have invested their
lives in their art, and in their
teaching, and whose work — for
whatever recognition may be
worth — is respected in the
world of art? Is this not an act
of considerable arrogance? . . .
Students are today helping to
transform the universities. I, for
one, wholeheartedly welcome
their participation. But some
times there rises from among
the constructive debate a spe
cial and familiar voice. The tone
brings to mind the lady on the
hotel terrace who — stridently,
irritably — commands the amb
ling waiter. It is the voice of
large privilege and small com
mitment, the voice of those who
demand all and give little. It
should not be confused with the
authentic voice of protest and
concern.

Little Effects Of Pot
Add Up To Danger
Editor, The Daily:
A number of articles about
marijuana have appeared rec
ently which seek to establish its
harmlessness. The other side of
the picture needs to be seen as
well.
Marijuana, at all effective dos
ages, affects mood and decision
making centers of the brain as
does alcohol only at the level
of drunkenness. Pot, in contrast
to alcohol, has little effect on
the mechanics of body move
ment, whereas the drunk is par
tially protected by being unable
to carry out many of his impet
uous, deluded inclinations. The
pot high lasts more than four
hours, is easily extended, and
is not easily detected by those
who should be warned of the
partial incapacitation of the
potted.
The quality of the mind de
pends on the sum of experiences
in judging whether information
is reliable or false. Chronic ex
posure to conditions which pro
duce hallucination must impart
memory references which may
impair long-term judgment.
Proof that pot is safe or harm
ful will require study of thous
ands of habitual users over
long periods of time to achieve
statistical validity. Proof of de
terioration of health of cigar

ette smokers was established in
this way. The evidence is strong
for physiological, mental, and
social deterioration associated
with prolonged use of mari
juana. Although the Individual
user may congratulate himself
on the negligible effects from
single uses, the accumulation
of small effects may be serious.
The argument that marijuana
may be safe because it has a
ten thousandfold range from the
least effective dose to lethal
levels ignores the fact that ac
cumulation of small Injuries to
mind and body, rather than sud
den death, is the issue. Living
through a harmful experience
is not assurance that no damage
was done. The recuperative ca
pacities and health reserves of
the body are remarkable, but I
advise: Don't waste health on
hallucination.

No Prejudice But Sex
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to quote from the
international constitution of one
of the Stanford fraternities that
you seem to think are all racial
ly and/or religiously prejudiced.
Article 4, paragraph 2.
Except as otherwise herein
procided, the membership in the
fraternity may be attained only
through membership in an ac
tive chapter, and no candidate
shall be eligible for membership
unless he is a duly accredited
and regularly enrolled under

graduate or graduate student In
good standing and a candidate
for baccalaureate or graduate de
gree in a college or university
in which the fraternity has or is
in the process of establishing an
active chapter.
Article 4, paragraph 5.
Membership shall be limited
to males, and regardless of eli
gibility otherwise, no one who
is a member of any other social
college fraternity shall be eligi
ble for membership.
This is from the constitution
of the Zeta Psi Fraternity of
North America, effective 22
June 1951. Admittedly, this does
exclude from possible member
ship over 50 percent of the na
tion's population and 23.5 per
cent of the Stanford students;
but I am excluded from joining
the DAR and the WCTU, so
there is some discrimination al
ways.
The Zetes have rushed without
the thought of either racial or
religious quotas. They, as other
Stanford fraternities, can only
choose from what is made avail
able to them through the univer
sity admission policies and the
students who want to go through
rushing fraternities. The Zetes
believe in the right of freedom
of association. Students who
have intelligence, a thirst for
education, social graces, a will
ingness to work, call it what you
may, will be asked to join the
Zete fraternity. A student will
be asked to join because of these
and other traits, not because he
may be a Laplander (The Lap
lander ratio within the local Zete
house is below the national aver
age.) and an ethnic balance must
be maintained. If the fraternity
pledges two Laplanders and
thereby achieves a higher ratio
than the nation as a whole,
should one be asked to depledge?
The demonstration houses, the
row houses, the dormitories, off
campus housing, Florence
Moore, and fraternities all have
a place at Stanford. Each one
will appeal to a group of stu
dents. Let each type continue
to appeal to the students, and
don't always jump onto the
"latest and greatest" living sche
me as a panacea that will cure
all social ills, prevent dandruff,
provide a "complete educational
experience," and assure that
everyone will be ASSU president
at least once during his studies
at Stanford.
A. D. KIRKLAND
Director, Region Two,
Zeta Psi Fraternity
Edltor, The Daily:
The following observations
concern the letter by 45 students
in last Friday's Daily, in which
the Art Department is accused
of maintaining a "consistently
hypocritical attitude toward stu
dio art and creative expression."
The students cite only three ex
amples, "out of thousands" to
illustrate the Department's hy
pocrisy.
1. They object to the architec
tural quality of the new Art
Building. I wonder on what ba
sis? The building is now begin
ning to rise from its excavated
site. They can have only the dim
mest idea of its future appear
ance. Is it possible that the pre
monition of it has so distressed
them during the current year
that they gave to this com
plaint the first place in their
sampling?
2. The students are indignant
about the future sculpture pro
gram at Stanford. Do they know
what is being planned? So far as
I am aware, they have not taken
the trouble to inform them
selves. Can the thought of sculp
ture's future condition, about
which they have no authentic in
formation, really have given
them such distress as to move
them to make a public com
plaint?
3. The letter writers criticize
the Department for having re
mained silent following the re
cent removal of paintings by one
of our graduate students from
an administrative building on
campus. Neither the exhibition
of these paintings, nor their re
moval, was undertaken under
Departmental auspices. The De
partment is quite ready to de
fend it students from attack,
and has done so on various oc
casions, although this defense
may not necessarily take the
form of manifestos in the Daily.
These are the complaints on
which the students base their
charge of hypocrisy and dishon
esty. There is, in addition, a
passing reference to "token
shows of art." I assume that this
refers to four exhibitions of con
temporary art held at Stanford
during the current year, the
Cowles Collection, the Weisman
Collection, Neo-Dada art, and
Contemporary Graphics. Togeth
er, the four exhibitions included
works by nearly all the more
prominent American artists of
the present. In terms of our re
sources, they represented a very
strenuous effort.
In speaking of the work and
the teaching of the artists who
staff the Art Department at Stan
ford, the students used terms
such as "hypocritical," and
"token," and very broadly im
plied a lack of honesty and truth
in our work. I wonder whether
they realize the full seriousness
of these charges? I do not ques
tion their commitment to art.
Why do they, in a letter of slap
dash composition and minimal
accuracy, feel entitled to ques
tion the integrity of artists and
teachers who have invested their
lives in their art, and in their
teaching, and whose work — for
whatever recognition may be
worth — is respected in the
world of art? Is this not an act
of considerable arrogance? . . .
Students are today helping to
transform the universities. I, for
one, wholeheartedly welcome
their participation. But some
times there rises from among
the constructive debate a spe
cial and familiar voice. The tone
brings to mind the lady on the
hotel terrace who — stridently,
irritably — commands the amb
ling waiter. It is the voice of
large privilege and small com
mitment, the voice of those who
demand all and give little. It
should not be confused with the
authentic voice of protest and
concern.

Little Effects Of Pot
Add Up To Danger
Editor, The Daily:
A number of articles about
marijuana have appeared rec
ently which seek to establish its
harmlessness. The other side of
the picture needs to be seen as
well.
Marijuana, at all effective dos
ages, affects mood and decision
making centers of the brain as
does alcohol only at the level
of drunkenness. Pot, in contrast
to alcohol, has little effect on
the mechanics of body move
ment, whereas the drunk is par
tially protected by being unable
to carry out many of his impet
uous, deluded inclinations. The
pot high lasts more than four
hours, is easily extended, and
is not easily detected by those
who should be warned of the
partial incapacitation of the
potted.
The quality of the mind de
pends on the sum of experiences
in judging whether information
is reliable or false. Chronic ex
posure to conditions which pro
duce hallucination must impart
memory references which may
impair long-term judgment.
Proof that pot is safe or harm
ful will require study of thous
ands of habitual users over
long periods of time to achieve
statistical validity. Proof of de
terioration of health of cigar

ette smokers was established in
this way. The evidence is strong
for physiological, mental, and
social deterioration associated
with prolonged use of mari
juana. Although the Individual
user may congratulate himself
on the negligible effects from
single uses, the accumulation
of small effects may be serious.
The argument that marijuana
may be safe because it has a
ten thousandfold range from the
least effective dose to lethal
levels ignores the fact that ac
cumulation of small Injuries to
mind and body, rather than sud
den death, is the issue. Living
through a harmful experience
is not assurance that no damage
was done. The recuperative ca
pacities and health reserves of
the body are remarkable, but I
advise: Don't waste health on
hallucination.

Courageous New Step
Needs Student Support
Editor, The Daily:
I am quite perplexed by the
attitude of some Stanford stu
dents toward the Martin Luther
King Fund.
Two weeks ago, in the after
math of Dr. King's death, the
discussion focussed on the ques
tion: What Can Stanford Do?
It was observed that Stanford
was a rich, white, racist institu
tion that was doing little if any
thing to help alleviate the plight
of black Americans. This was
followed by the demands of the
Black Student Union that cer
tain steps be taken.
Acting with great courage and
understanding, I think, the Uni
versity has taken almost all
those steps. Although it already
faces large financial deficits in
the future, the university de
cided to undertake new pro
grams that will cost $1.2 million
per year in the future. Vice
President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson has sent out a di
rective asking each unit to find
ways to cut costs so as to help
fund the new work.
In addition, Stanford is fend
ing off the back-lash from some
alumni who object to "watering
down" academic standards or to
Stanford's "capitulation under
duress." It is safe to say that
the university has lost many
gifts as a result.
It is therefore difficult to un
derstand how students—who
loudly demanded that "the Uni
versity" do something to help
solve the problem—can now ob
ject when "the University" has
acted and must find the where
withal to pay for its major new
commitments. Stanford has re
sponded in the best way it can,
and is seeking support from
every source—internally, pri
vate, and governmental.
To me, the argument that
Stanford has "shifted the load
to others" or that money can
better be spent by the Black
Panthers sounds like rationali
zation. Are those who argue for
gifts to the Black Panthers giv
ing themselves to that organi
zation? Or are they merely con
tent to sit at the Union, drink
ing coffee in self-righteous sup
port of the BSU and grumbling
paranoically that anything that
"the University" does is auto
matically wrong?
PETER MULLEN
Army Private Sees
Vast Bureaucracy
Editor, The Daily:
I just saw Pvt. Baxstresser's
letter to the editor in the Daily,
April 18. I was inducted into the
Army on March 13, 1968. Due to
my father's occupation I could
not have refused induction or
fled to Canada without causing
my family severe financial hard
ship.
Pvt. Baxstresser apparently
went into the Army expecting
to find a totally inhuman ma
chine bent upon destroy,
ing him personally. This seems
to be a very popular paranoid
fantasy among certain elements
at Stanford. Now that he has es
caped the forced draft of Stan
ford, the fire of his commitment
has died down.
He is so delighted to discover
human beings in the Army that
he has completely lost sight of
what should have been the real
reason for his opposition to the

draft: not simply what the Army
might do to him, but the entire
nature and purpose of the mili
tary establishment. He is now
another weapon in the hands of
an organization whose purpose
is to impose the policies of the
United States Government on
the rest of the world by force
and violence. He's "The man who
lends his body as a weapon of
the war."
However, Pvt. Baxstresser did
touch upon one very valid point:
the juggernaut will grind you
under if you stand in its way.
More frightening than the fan
tasy of the Army as an inhuman
machine bent upon your destruc
tion as a human being is the re
ality of the Army as a vast bu
reaucracy that can entirely re
fuse to recognize you as a hu
man being.
Personally, I have been treat
ed fairly and well by Army
standards. On April 2 I refused
to participate in any further bay
onet practice. After some un
pleasant name-calling by a
couple of gung-ho sergeants, I
was given a Conscientious Ob
jector application to fill out and
submit. There were a couple of
days of harassment, but I am
now acting as a clerk in the
company office until the Depart
ment of the Army returns a
decision on my application. How
ever, if anyone asks my advice,
I will tell them to avoid the
draft by any means available,
honest or dishonest, short of go
ing to jail. The felony conviction
could be a hassle.
I too would appreciate hear

Little Effects Of Pot
Add Up To Danger
Editor, The Daily:
A number of articles about

harmlessness. The other side of
the picture needs to be seen as
well.
Marijuana, at all effective dos
ages, affects mood and decision
making centers of the brain as
does alcohol only at the level
of drunkenness. Pot, in contrast
to alcohol, has little effect on
the mechanics of body move
ment, whereas the drunk is par
tially protected by being unable
to carry out many of his impet
uous, deluded inclinations. The
pot high lasts more than four
hours, is easily extended, and
is not easily detected by those
who should be warned of the
partial incapacitation of the
potted.
The quality of the mind de
pends on the sum of experiences
in judging whether information
is reliable or false. Chronic ex
posure to conditions which pro
duce hallucination must impart
memory references which may
impair long-term judgment.
Proof that pot is safe or harm

long periods of time to achieve

The argument that marijuana
may be safe because it has a
ten thousandfold range from the
least effective dose to lethal
levels ignores the fact that ac
cumulation of small Injuries to
mind and body, rather than sud
den death, is the issue. Living
through a harmful experience
is not assurance that no damage
was done. The recuperative ca

the body are remarkable, but I
advise: Don't waste health on
hallucination.

ture's future condition, about
which they have no authentic in
formation, really have given
them such distress as to move
them to make a public com
plaint?
3. The letter writers criticize
the Department for having re
mained silent following the re
cent removal of paintings by one
of our graduate students from
an administrative building on
campus. Neither the exhibition
of these paintings, nor their re
moval, was undertaken under
Departmental auspices. The De
partment is quite ready to de
fend it students from attack,
and has done so on various oc
casions, although this defense
may not necessarily take the
form of manifestos in the Daily.
These are the complaints on
which the students base their
charge of hypocrisy and dishon
esty. There is, in addition, a
passing reference to "token
shows of art." I assume that this
refers to four exhibitions of con
temporary art held at Stanford
during the current year, the
Cowles Collection, the Weisman
Collection, Neo-Dada art, and
Contemporary Graphics. Togeth
er, the four exhibitions included
works by nearly all the more
prominent American artists of
the present. In terms of our re
sources, they represented a very
strenuous effort.
In speaking of the work and
the teaching of the artists who
staff the Art Department at Stan
ford, the students used terms
such as "hypocritical," and
"token," and very broadly im
plied a lack of honesty and truth
in our work. I wonder whether
they realize the full seriousness
of these charges? I do not ques
tion their commitment to art.
Why do they, in a letter of slap
dash composition and minimal
accuracy, feel entitled to ques
tion the integrity of artists and
teachers who have invested their
lives in their art, and in their
teaching, and whose work — for
whatever recognition may be
worth — is respected in the
world of art? Is this not an act
of considerable arrogance? . . .
Students are today helping to
transform the universities. I, for
one, wholeheartedly welcome
their participation. But some
times there rises from among
the constructive debate a spe
cial and familiar voice. The tone
brings to mind the lady on the
hotel terrace who — stridently,
irritably — commands the amb
ling waiter. It is the voice of
large privilege and small com
mitment, the voice of those who
demand all and give little. It
should not be confused with the
authentic voice of protest and
concern.

Little Effects Of Pot
Add Up To Danger
Editor, The Daily:
A number of articles about
marijuana have appeared rec
ently which seek to establish its
harmlessness. The other side of
the picture needs to be seen as
well.
Marijuana, at all effective dos
ages, affects mood and decision
making centers of the brain as
does alcohol only at the level
of drunkenness. Pot, in contrast
to alcohol, has little effect on
the mechanics of body move
ment, whereas the drunk is par
tially protected by being unable
to carry out many of his impet
uous, deluded inclinations. The
pot high lasts more than four
hours, is easily extended, and
is not easily detected by those
who should be warned of the
partial incapacitation of the
potted.
The quality of the mind de
pends on the sum of experiences
in judging whether information
is reliable or false. Chronic ex
posure to conditions which pro
duce hallucination must impart
memory references which may
impair long-term judgment.
Proof that pot is safe or harm
ful will require study of thous
ands of habitual users over
long periods of time to achieve
statistical validity. Proof of de
terioration of health of cigar

ette smokers was established in
this way. The evidence is strong
for physiological, mental, and
social deterioration associated
with prolonged use of mari
juana. Although the Individual
user may congratulate himself
on the negligible effects from
single uses, the accumulation
of small effects may be serious.
The argument that marijuana
may be safe because it has a
ten thousandfold range from the
least effective dose to lethal
levels ignores the fact that ac
cumulation of small Injuries to
mind and body, rather than sud
den death, is the issue. Living
through a harmful experience
is not assurance that no damage
was done. The recuperative ca
pacities and health reserves of
the body are remarkable, but I
advise: Don't waste health on
hallucination.

Courageous New Step
Needs Student Support
Editor, The Daily:
I am quite perplexed by the
attitude of some Stanford stu
dents toward the Martin Luther
King Fund.
Two weeks ago, in the after
math of Dr. King's death, the
discussion focussed on the ques
tion: What Can Stanford Do?
It was observed that Stanford
was a rich, white, racist institu
tion that was doing little if any
thing to help alleviate the plight
of black Americans. This was
followed by the demands of the
Black Student Union that cer
tain steps be taken.
Acting with great courage and
understanding, I think, the Uni
versity has taken almost all
those steps. Although it already
faces large financial deficits in
the future, the university de
cided to undertake new pro
grams that will cost $1.2 million
per year in the future. Vice
President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson has sent out a di
rective asking each unit to find
ways to cut costs so as to help
fund the new work.
In addition, Stanford is fend
ing off the back-lash from some
alumni who object to "watering
down" academic standards or to
Stanford's "capitulation under
duress." It is safe to say that
the university has lost many
gifts as a result.
It is therefore difficult to un
derstand how students—who
loudly demanded that "the Uni
versity" do something to help
solve the problem—can now ob
ject when "the University" has
acted and must find the where
withal to pay for its major new
commitments. Stanford has re
sponded in the best way it can,
and is seeking support from
every source—internally, pri
vate, and governmental.
To me, the argument that
Stanford has "shifted the load
to others" or that money can
better be spent by the Black
Panthers sounds like rationali
zation. Are those who argue for
gifts to the Black Panthers giv
ing themselves to that organi
zation? Or are they merely con
tent to sit at the Union, drink
ing coffee in self-righteous sup
port of the BSU and grumbling
paranoically that anything that
"the University" does is auto
matically wrong?
PETER MULLEN
Army Private Sees
Vast Bureaucracy
Editor, The Daily:
I just saw Pvt. Baxstresser's
letter to the editor in the Daily,
April 18. I was inducted into the
Army on March 13, 1968. Due to
my father's occupation I could
not have refused induction or
fled to Canada without causing
my family severe financial hard
ship.
Pvt. Baxstresser apparently
went into the Army expecting
to find a totally inhuman ma
chine bent upon destroy,
ing him personally. This seems
to be a very popular paranoid
fantasy among certain elements
at Stanford. Now that he has es
caped the forced draft of Stan
ford, the fire of his commitment
has died down.
He is so delighted to discover
human beings in the Army that
he has completely lost sight of
what should have been the real
reason for his opposition to the

draft: not simply what the Army
might do to him, but the entire
nature and purpose of the mili
tary establishment. He is now
another weapon in the hands of
an organization whose purpose
is to impose the policies of the
United States Government on
the rest of the world by force
and violence. He's "The man who
lends his body as a weapon of
the war."
However, Pvt. Baxstresser did
touch upon one very valid point:
the juggernaut will grind you
under if you stand in its way.
More frightening than the fan
tasy of the Army as an inhuman
machine bent upon your destruc
tion as a human being is the re
ality of the Army as a vast bu
reaucracy that can entirely re
fuse to recognize you as a hu
man being.
Personally, I have been treat
ed fairly and well by Army
standards. On April 2 I refused
to participate in any further bay
onet practice. After some un
pleasant name-calling by a
couple of gung-ho sergeants, I
was given a Conscientious Ob
jector application to fill out and
submit. There were a couple of
days of harassment, but I am
now acting as a clerk in the
company office until the Depart
ment of the Army returns a
decision on my application. How
ever, if anyone asks my advice,
I will tell them to avoid the
draft by any means available,
honest or dishonest, short of go
ing to jail. The felony conviction
could be a hassle.
I too would appreciate hear
ing from any of my friends at
Stanford, or from anyone who
has anything to say about this.

Zete Rushees Face
No Prejudice But Sex
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to quote from the
international constitution of one
of the Stanford fraternities that
you seem to think are all racial
ly and/or religiously prejudiced.
Article 4, paragraph 2.
Except as otherwise herein
procided, the membership in the
fraternity may be attained only
through membership in an ac
tive chapter, and no candidate
shall be eligible for membership
unless he is a duly accredited
and regularly enrolled under

graduate or graduate student In
good standing and a candidate
for baccalaureate or graduate de
gree in a college or university
in which the fraternity has or is
in the process of establishing an
active chapter.
Article 4, paragraph 5.
Membership shall be limited
to males, and regardless of eli
gibility otherwise, no one who
is a member of any other social
college fraternity shall be eligi
ble for membership.
This is from the constitution
of the Zeta Psi Fraternity of
North America, effective 22
June 1951. Admittedly, this does
exclude from possible member
ship over 50 percent of the na
tion's population and 23.5 per
cent of the Stanford students;
but I am excluded from joining
the DAR and the WCTU, so
there is some discrimination al
ways.
The Zetes have rushed without
the thought of either racial or
religious quotas. They, as other
Stanford fraternities, can only
choose from what is made avail
able to them through the univer
sity admission policies and the
students who want to go through
rushing fraternities. The Zetes
believe in the right of freedom
of association. Students who
have intelligence, a thirst for
education, social graces, a will
ingness to work, call it what you
may, will be asked to join the
Zete fraternity. A student will
be asked to join because of these
and other traits, not because he
may be a Laplander (The Lap
lander ratio within the local Zete
house is below the national aver
age.) and an ethnic balance must
be maintained. If the fraternity
pledges two Laplanders and
thereby achieves a higher ratio
than the nation as a whole,
should one be asked to depledge?
The demonstration houses, the
row houses, the dormitories, off
campus housing, Florence
Moore, and fraternities all have
a place at Stanford. Each one
will appeal to a group of stu
dents. Let each type continue
to appeal to the students, and
don't always jump onto the
"latest and greatest" living sche
me as a panacea that will cure
all social ills, prevent dandruff,
provide a "complete educational
experience," and assure that
everyone will be ASSU president
at least once during his studies
at Stanford.
