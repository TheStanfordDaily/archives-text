## 
### 
Three slates of candidates for
ASSU presir' ;nt and vice-presi
dent withdrew yesterday, bring
ing the total number of slates
aspiring to these offices to six.
Don Griffin, who was running
with Steven Kaplan, announced
yesterday that he did not have
the time to devote to the office.
Kaplan's name will not appear
on the ballot, although he an
nounced that he still had a num
ber of programs in his platform
that he would like to see "push
ed through."
Ira Mendlowitz and Bill Zig
rang offered "no comment" in

their withdrawal.
Michael Jurgen Wolff and
Nancy Ciaf Arnon stated in their
withdrawal that they had never
intended to enter the race.
In a letter to the Daily, Wolff
thanked Roger Wilner, who "or
ganized the grass-roots support
which I sincerely appreciate re
ceiving."
Wolff insisted that recent ac
ceptance to the British overseas
campus convinced him that he
did not wish to seek the office
of president. He added that he
had "never even talked to" his
running mate.

There are some corrections in
the information listed for the
candidates in yesterday's Daily.
Denis Hayes is a junior, not a
senior as previously reported.
His running mate, Victor Von
Schlegell lives in East Palo Alto.
Hugh (Hue) Mac Donald is a
sponsor in Madera.
William Klingel and Caldecot
Chubb had announced last Fri
day that they would not be run
ning.
Craig Brown, ASSU elections
commissioner, said that none of
the names for the four slates
will appear on the ballot.
