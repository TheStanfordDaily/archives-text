## Panthers Guilty? 
### MARLENE CHARYN 
Statements obtained through
threats of punishment and phy
sical violence were used by Ala
meda County District Attorney
Frank Coakley to get Grand
Jury indictments against eight
members of the Black Panther
Party. The Panthers have al
ready filed affidavits with the
United States District Court
swearing that the statements
were forced out of them by Oak
land police the weekend they
were arrested.
The statements, made by four
of the eight indicted, were read
or referred to by Sergeants Nor
man Stevenson and Elza Turk
ington before the Alameda Coun
ty Grand Jury, which indicted
seven of the Panthers on two
counts each of attempted mur
der and assault with a deadly
weapon. Panther Information
Minister Eldridge Cleaver faces
the same charges but on three
counts.
Last Friday's San Francisco
Chronicle quoted from the
Grand Jury testimony state
ments by four of the eight Pan
thers arrested after the April 6
shoot-out with Oakland police.
The statements of the four said
the Panthers were out on that
night "to do some shooting."
The indictments were returned
April 24 after a three-day Grand
Jury investigation. "Investiga
tion" is a euphemism, however.
On Monday, April 22, Panther
attorney Charles Garry filed suit
in San Francisco Federal Court
in the names of 17 Panthers,
charging that the City of Oak
land, Mayor John Reading, Chief
of Police Charles Gain, and Dis
trict Attorney Coakley, as well
as Herbert Heanes of the Oak

land police, have violated the
Civil Rights Act of 1871 and the
First and Fourteenth Amend
ments to the Constitution.
The suit requests an injunc
tion stopping the trial of Huey
Newton and the other Panthers
presently under indictment, and
prohibiting the continued ha
rassment of the Panthers by po
lice.
There are also a group affi
davits by Donnell Lankford.
Terry Cotton, Wendell Wade,
and Warren Wells which de
scribe how the police attempted
to divide the Panthers by telling
each that the others had testi
fied against him, how the police
tried to get particularly damag
ing statements against Eldridge
Cleaver.
All four were told that if they
signed the statements they
would be charged only with mis
demeanor gun violations, not
with attempted murder.
Wendell Wade, 22, at first re
fused to make or sign any state
ments. When he told police he
wanted to see his lawyer, he
swore in his affidavit, an officer
"replied that I couldn't get an
attorney until Monday and that
by then all the information
would be turned in to the Dis
trict Attorney's office and then
I couldn't make any statements
and it would be too late to make
any statement to help myself."
Later the officer "pulled out a
snub-nosed pistol . . . and said
'my gun can shoot too.' During
all this he was pointing the gun
right into my face. He then
asked me more questions. I then
signed the statement he had
written without reading it be
cause I was afraid he would
shoot me if I didn't."

Donnell Lankford, 18, was told
when he first arrived at City
Jail, by Sgt. Stevenson, that the
others were blaming everything
on him. "He also told me," Lank
ford swore in his affidavit, "that
Eldridge Cleaver had said that
everybody had made statements
against him, so he was going to
make statements against the
rest of us."
Stevenson also threatened
Lankford with the death penal
ty, and asked Lankford if he
was being paid by the Panthers.
Lankford testified that Steven
son said "nobody in the Black
Panthers was getting any money
except Eldridge Cleaver, Bobby
Seale, and Huey Newton.
He said the lawyers were only
going to work for these three
who had the money, and
wouldn't do anything for the
rest of us. He told me that if I
told any of the things that he
said to me my lawyer, he would
deny them all."
Warren Wells, 21, was also
questioned by Stevenson and an
other officer. Wells testified they
said "if I did not cooperate with
them and give them the state
ment that they wanted, they had
the power to see that Eldridge
Cleaver and I would be convict
ed of the murder of Bobby Hut
ton and that we would both be
sent to the gas chamber. . .

the same charges but on three
counts.
Last Friday's San Francisco
Chronicle quoted from the
Grand Jury testimony state
ments by four of the eight Pan
thers arrested after the April 6
shoot-out with Oakland police.
The statements of the four said
the Panthers were out on that
night "to do some shooting."
The indictments were returned
April 24 after a three-day Grand
Jury investigation. "Investiga
tion" is a euphemism, however.
On Monday, April 22, Panther
attorney Charles Garry filed suit
in San Francisco Federal Court
in the names of 17 Panthers,
charging that the City of Oak
land, Mayor John Reading, Chief
of Police Charles Gain, and Dis
trict Attorney Coakley, as well
as Herbert Heanes of the Oak

land police, have violated the
Civil Rights Act of 1871 and the
First and Fourteenth Amend
ments to the Constitution.
The suit requests an injunc
tion stopping the trial of Huey
Newton and the other Panthers
presently under indictment, and
prohibiting the continued ha
rassment of the Panthers by po
lice.
There are also a group affi
davits by Donnell Lankford.
Terry Cotton, Wendell Wade,
and Warren Wells which de
scribe how the police attempted
to divide the Panthers by telling
each that the others had testi
fied against him, how the police
tried to get particularly damag
ing statements against Eldridge
Cleaver.
All four were told that if they
signed the statements they
would be charged only with mis
demeanor gun violations, not
with attempted murder.
Wendell Wade, 22, at first re
fused to make or sign any state
ments. When he told police he
wanted to see his lawyer, he
swore in his affidavit, an officer
"replied that I couldn't get an
attorney until Monday and that
by then all the information
would be turned in to the Dis
trict Attorney's office and then
I couldn't make any statements
and it would be too late to make
any statement to help myself."
Later the officer "pulled out a
snub-nosed pistol . . . and said
'my gun can shoot too.' During
all this he was pointing the gun
right into my face. He then
asked me more questions. I then
signed the statement he had
written without reading it be
cause I was afraid he would
shoot me if I didn't."

Donnell Lankford, 18, was told
when he first arrived at City
Jail, by Sgt. Stevenson, that the
others were blaming everything
on him. "He also told me," Lank
ford swore in his affidavit, "that
Eldridge Cleaver had said that
everybody had made statements
against him, so he was going to
make statements against the
rest of us."
Stevenson also threatened
Lankford with the death penal
ty, and asked Lankford if he
was being paid by the Panthers.
Lankford testified that Steven
son said "nobody in the Black
Panthers was getting any money
except Eldridge Cleaver, Bobby
Seale, and Huey Newton.
He said the lawyers were only
going to work for these three
who had the money, and
wouldn't do anything for the
rest of us. He told me that if I
told any of the things that he
said to me my lawyer, he would
deny them all."
Warren Wells, 21, was also
questioned by Stevenson and an
other officer. Wells testified they
said "if I did not cooperate with
them and give them the state
ment that they wanted, they had
the power to see that Eldridge
Cleaver and I would be convict
ed of the murder of Bobby Hut
ton and that we would both be
sent to the gas chamber. . .
Statements obtained through
threats of punishment and phy
sical violence were used by Ala
meda County District Attorney
Frank Coakley to get Grand
Jury indictments against eight
members of the Black Panther
Party. The Panthers have al
ready filed affidavits with the
United States District Court
swearing that the statements
were forced out of them by Oak
land police the weekend they
were arrested.
The statements, made by four
of the eight indicted, were read
or referred to by Sergeants Nor
man Stevenson and Elza Turk
ington before the Alameda Coun
ty Grand Jury, which indicted
seven of the Panthers on two
counts each of attempted mur
der and assault with a deadly
weapon. Panther Information

as Herbert Heanes of the Oak

land police, have violated the
Civil Rights Act of 1871 and the
First and Fourteenth Amend
ments to the Constitution.
The suit requests an injunc
tion stopping the trial of Huey
Newton and the other Panthers
presently under indictment, and
prohibiting the continued ha
rassment of the Panthers by po
lice.
There are also a group affi
davits by Donnell Lankford.
Terry Cotton, Wendell Wade,
and Warren Wells which de
scribe how the police attempted
to divide the Panthers by telling
each that the others had testi
fied against him, how the police
tried to get particularly damag
ing statements against Eldridge
Cleaver.
All four were told that if they
signed the statements they
would be charged only with mis
demeanor gun violations, not
with attempted murder.
Wendell Wade, 22, at first re
fused to make or sign any state
ments. When he told police he
wanted to see his lawyer, he
swore in his affidavit, an officer
"replied that I couldn't get an
attorney until Monday and that
by then all the information
would be turned in to the Dis
trict Attorney's office and then
I couldn't make any statements
and it would be too late to make
any statement to help myself."
Later the officer "pulled out a
snub-nosed pistol . . . and said
'my gun can shoot too.' During
all this he was pointing the gun
right into my face. He then
asked me more questions. I then
signed the statement he had
written without reading it be
cause I was afraid he would
shoot me if I didn't."

Donnell Lankford, 18, was told
when he first arrived at City
Jail, by Sgt. Stevenson, that the
others were blaming everything
on him. "He also told me," Lank
ford swore in his affidavit, "that
Eldridge Cleaver had said that
everybody had made statements
against him, so he was going to
make statements against the
rest of us."
Stevenson also threatened
Lankford with the death penal
ty, and asked Lankford if he
was being paid by the Panthers.
Lankford testified that Steven
son said "nobody in the Black
Panthers was getting any money
except Eldridge Cleaver, Bobby
Seale, and Huey Newton.
He said the lawyers were only
going to work for these three
who had the money, and
wouldn't do anything for the
rest of us. He told me that if I
told any of the things that he
said to me my lawyer, he would
deny them all."
Warren Wells, 21, was also
questioned by Stevenson and an
other officer. Wells testified they
said "if I did not cooperate with
them and give them the state
ment that they wanted, they had
the power to see that Eldridge
Cleaver and I would be convict
ed of the murder of Bobby Hut
ton and that we would both be
sent to the gas chamber. . .
