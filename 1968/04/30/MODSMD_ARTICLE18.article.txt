# Advanced Study
## 'Postdocs' Increase 
### SUE CRIBARI First of Three Parts 
Since the days of the little
red school house, there has been
a dramatic "evolution" in the
academic realm: It has become
necessary to stay in school for
an ever-increasing amount of
time in order to contribute to
a highly technical and competit
ive society.
Evidence of this evolution can
be seen at Stanford and other
universities throughout the
country where more and more
students are doing postdoctoral
work—study and research in
their chosen field beyond their
Ph.D.
Virgil Whitaker, dean of the
graduate division, said the num
ber of postdoctoral students is
"rising very rapidly." In con
junction with a national survey
of "post-docs," his office did a
survey in the Spring of 1967
which counted 232 of such stu
dents at Stanford that year. As
Whitaker pointed out, this was
a "considerable number," be
cause there were only 455 Ph.D.
candidates the same year.
The survey figures show
that most of these post-docs
are in natural sciences, a few
are in social sciences and prac
tically none are in the hu
manities. Whitaker said this
is the "prevailing pattern
throughout the country."
A student in the natural
sciences would do post doctoral
work, he said, because "the
amount of material in the sci
ences is accumulating at an in
credible rate," and it is "simply
impossible" to get a working
knowledge of the necessary ma
terial in the time alloted for
study toward the Ph.D. degree.
In addition, he said that study
in the natural sciences and some
of the social sciences in many
cases trains Ph.D.'s for indus
tries and government. The
Ph.D., then, is scaled to the gen
eral need. But special needs,
such as lifetime careers of "re
search on the highest possible
level," or teaching in a univers
ity are fulfilled by postdoctoral
work.
Whitaker's survey showed
that for Spring, 1967, there
was a total of 101 post-docs
in the School of Medicine, the
largest concentrations being
20 in the Department of Bio

chemistry; 17 tn the Depart
ment of Medicine; and 14 in
the Department of Pediatrics.
The School of Humanities
and Sciences had a total of 100
post-docs with a concentration
of 35 in the Department of
Chemistry; 25 in the Depart
metn of Physics; and 14 in the
Department of Biological Sci
ences. The Schools of Earth
Sciences and Business both had
2 postdoctoral students. The
School of Engineering, while it
showed a total of only 21, had
at least one post-doc in 5 out of
7 departments.
One of the difficulties with a
survey of this type, however, is
that the term "postdoctoral stu
dent" is very difficult to define.
As Whitaker remarked, "There
are a variety of over-lapping
categories." There are those
students who come to Stanford
for a year or more of study or
research beyond their Ph.D.
They are financed by fellowship
from a national agency or foun
dation, or by funds made avail
able to the professors under
whom they work.
These "genuine postdoctorals"
are termed "postdoctoral re
search associates" or "postdoc
toral research fellows." But
there are also those students
who come on their own power,
those who are hired as research
associates, and visiting scholars
of various ages and various
lengths of permanency who
want to use Stanford as a base
for their research.
To further complicate the
matter, each department has its
own interpretation of the term.
The department of chemistry,
for example, does not distin
guish between "research associ
ates" and "postdoctoral research
associates." In addition, survey
figures suffer because the length
of stay of each student varies
and overlaps with that of other
students,and there is a constant
changeover.
So any figures presented are
bound to be confusing. As Whit
aker commented, "We just have
no effective control on them
(the post-docs) in the area of
statistical control."
Scattered interviews with
department heads, postdoctor
al students themselves, and
others yielded more specific
information about this unde

fined group of scholars within
the university.
William R. Rambo, associate
dean of research for the School
of Engineering, agreed with Dr.
Whitaker that the "most per
plexing thing" about post-docs
is identifying them. None are
specifically identified as "post
doctoral students." But refer
ing to Whitaker's definition of
"genuine postdoctorals," he said
the Department of Electrical
Engineering, has "eight or ten"
this year.
The department of engineer
ing differs from the norm in
that certain postdoctoral stu
dents may be financed by com
panies, which send their employ
ees "back to school" to learn
new engineering techniques.
Rambo termed this the com
pany's version of the sabbatical.
Rambo commented that the
life of a professional engineer
today may be short if he is
put in an environment which
is not forward-looking and
progressive, because "What
he learned ten years ago may
be pretty well ploughed
through by now . . . His own
expertise may be out of date."
To illustrate his point, he said
that 15 years ago, an engi
neering student would have
graduated from Stanford
knowing virtually nothing
about computers.
Generally, Rambo said, engi
neering postdoctoral work is
done for pragmatic rather than
scholarly purposes, "to learn to
build better bridges," as he put
it. In addition to company-spon
sored postdoctoral students,
there is also the "man that has
what he considers to be a red
hot idea and comes here to try
it out."
Another post-doc described by
Rambo is the student who has
just recently gotten his doctor
ate. In the course of his Ph.D.
work, something new, and in
the research sense, exciting,
may have come up. But pru
dence dictated finishing his dis
sertation first. After receiving
his degree, however, he is free
to explore the new area. In this
case, he is likely to stay on at
the same university where he
did his doctoral work.

(Tomorrow: The Postdoctoral
Student and his work)
Since the days of the little
red school house, there has been
a dramatic "evolution" in the
academic realm: It has become
necessary to stay in school for
an ever-increasing amount of
time in order to contribute to
a highly technical and competit
ive society.
Evidence of this evolution can
be seen at Stanford and other
universities throughout the
country where more and more
students are doing postdoctoral
work—study and research in
their chosen field beyond their
Ph.D.
Virgil Whitaker, dean of the
graduate division, said the num
ber of postdoctoral students is
"rising very rapidly." In con
junction with a national survey
of "post-docs," his office did a
survey in the Spring of 1967
which counted 232 of such stu
dents at Stanford that year. As
Whitaker pointed out, this was
a "considerable number," be
cause there were only 455 Ph.D.
candidates the same year.
The survey figures show
that most of these post-docs
are in natural sciences, a few
are in social sciences and prac
tically none are in the hu
manities. Whitaker said this
is the "prevailing pattern
throughout the country."
A student in the natural
sciences would do post doctoral
work, he said, because "the
amount of material in the sci
ences is accumulating at an in
credible rate," and it is "simply
impossible" to get a working
knowledge of the necessary ma
terial in the time alloted for
study toward the Ph.D. degree.
In addition, he said that study
in the natural sciences and some
of the social sciences in many
cases trains Ph.D.'s for indus
tries and government. The
Ph.D., then, is scaled to the gen
eral need. But special needs,
such as lifetime careers of "re
search on the highest possible
level," or teaching in a univers
ity are fulfilled by postdoctoral
work.
Whitaker's survey showed
that for Spring, 1967, there
was a total of 101 post-docs
in the School of Medicine, the
largest concentrations being
20 in the Department of Bio

chemistry; 17 tn the Depart
ment of Medicine; and 14 in
the Department of Pediatrics.
The School of Humanities
and Sciences had a total of 100
post-docs with a concentration
of 35 in the Department of
Chemistry; 25 in the Depart
metn of Physics; and 14 in the
Department of Biological Sci
ences. The Schools of Earth
Sciences and Business both had
2 postdoctoral students. The
School of Engineering, while it
showed a total of only 21, had
at least one post-doc in 5 out of
7 departments.
One of the difficulties with a
survey of this type, however, is
that the term "postdoctoral stu
dent" is very difficult to define.
As Whitaker remarked, "There
are a variety of over-lapping
categories." There are those
students who come to Stanford
for a year or more of study or
research beyond their Ph.D.
They are financed by fellowship
from a national agency or foun
dation, or by funds made avail
able to the professors under
whom they work.
These "genuine postdoctorals"
are termed "postdoctoral re
search associates" or "postdoc
toral research fellows." But
there are also those students
who come on their own power,
those who are hired as research
associates, and visiting scholars
of various ages and various
lengths of permanency who
want to use Stanford as a base
for their research.
To further complicate the
matter, each department has its
own interpretation of the term.
The department of chemistry,
for example, does not distin
guish between "research associ
ates" and "postdoctoral research
associates." In addition, survey
figures suffer because the length
of stay of each student varies
and overlaps with that of other
students,and there is a constant
changeover.
So any figures presented are
bound to be confusing. As Whit
aker commented, "We just have
no effective control on them
(the post-docs) in the area of
statistical control."
Scattered interviews with
department heads, postdoctor
al students themselves, and
others yielded more specific
information about this unde

fined group of scholars within
the university.
William R. Rambo, associate
dean of research for the School
of Engineering, agreed with Dr.
Whitaker that the "most per
plexing thing" about post-docs
is identifying them. None are
specifically identified as "post
doctoral students." But refer
ing to Whitaker's definition of
"genuine postdoctorals," he said
the Department of Electrical
Engineering, has "eight or ten"
this year.
The department of engineer
ing differs from the norm in
that certain postdoctoral stu
dents may be financed by com
panies, which send their employ
ees "back to school" to learn
new engineering techniques.
Rambo termed this the com
pany's version of the sabbatical.
Rambo commented that the
life of a professional engineer
today may be short if he is
put in an environment which
is not forward-looking and
progressive, because "What
he learned ten years ago may
be pretty well ploughed
through by now . . . His own
expertise may be out of date."
To illustrate his point, he said
that 15 years ago, an engi
neering student would have
graduated from Stanford
knowing virtually nothing
about computers.
Generally, Rambo said, engi
neering postdoctoral work is
done for pragmatic rather than
scholarly purposes, "to learn to
build better bridges," as he put
it. In addition to company-spon
sored postdoctoral students,
there is also the "man that has
what he considers to be a red
hot idea and comes here to try
it out."
Another post-doc described by
Rambo is the student who has
just recently gotten his doctor
ate. In the course of his Ph.D.
work, something new, and in
the research sense, exciting,
may have come up. But pru
dence dictated finishing his dis
sertation first. After receiving

sored postdoctoral students,
there is also the "man that has
what he considers to be a red
hot idea and comes here to try
it out."
Another post-doc described by
Rambo is the student who has
just recently gotten his doctor
ate. In the course of his Ph.D.
work, something new, and in
the research sense, exciting,
may have come up. But pru
dence dictated finishing his dis
sertation first. After receiving
his degree, however, he is free
to explore the new area. In this
case, he is likely to stay on at
the same university where he
did his doctoral work.
(Tomorrow: The Postdoctoral
Student and his work)
Since the days of the little
red school house, there has been
a dramatic "evolution" in the
academic realm: It has become
necessary to stay in school for
an ever-increasing amount of
time in order to contribute to
a highly technical and competit
ive society.
Evidence of this evolution can
be seen at Stanford and other
universities throughout the
country where more and more
students are doing postdoctoral
work—study and research in
their chosen field beyond their
Ph.D.
Virgil Whitaker, dean of the
graduate division, said the num
ber of postdoctoral students is
"rising very rapidly." In con
junction with a national survey
of "post-docs," his office did a
survey in the Spring of 1967
which counted 232 of such stu
dents at Stanford that year. As
Whitaker pointed out, this was
a "considerable number," be
cause there were only 455 Ph.D.
candidates the same year.
The survey figures show
that most of these post-docs
are in natural sciences, a few
are in social sciences and prac
tically none are in the hu
manities. Whitaker said this
is the "prevailing pattern
throughout the country."
A student in the natural
sciences would do post doctoral
work, he said, because "the
amount of material in the sci
ences is accumulating at an in
credible rate," and it is "simply
impossible" to get a working
knowledge of the necessary ma
terial in the time alloted for
study toward the Ph.D. degree.
In addition, he said that study
in the natural sciences and some
of the social sciences in many
cases trains Ph.D.'s for indus
tries and government. The
Ph.D., then, is scaled to the gen
eral need. But special needs,
such as lifetime careers of "re
search on the highest possible
level," or teaching in a univers
ity are fulfilled by postdoctoral
work.
Whitaker's survey showed
that for Spring, 1967, there
was a total of 101 post-docs
in the School of Medicine, the
largest concentrations being
20 in the Department of Bio

chemistry; 17 tn the Depart
ment of Medicine; and 14 in
the Department of Pediatrics.
The School of Humanities
and Sciences had a total of 100
post-docs with a concentration
of 35 in the Department of
Chemistry; 25 in the Depart
metn of Physics; and 14 in the
Department of Biological Sci
ences. The Schools of Earth
Sciences and Business both had
2 postdoctoral students. The
School of Engineering, while it
showed a total of only 21, had
at least one post-doc in 5 out of
7 departments.
One of the difficulties with a
survey of this type, however, is
that the term "postdoctoral stu
dent" is very difficult to define.
As Whitaker remarked, "There
are a variety of over-lapping
categories." There are those
students who come to Stanford
for a year or more of study or
research beyond their Ph.D.
They are financed by fellowship
from a national agency or foun
dation, or by funds made avail
able to the professors under
whom they work.
These "genuine postdoctorals"
are termed "postdoctoral re
search associates" or "postdoc
toral research fellows." But
there are also those students
who come on their own power,
those who are hired as research
associates, and visiting scholars
of various ages and various
lengths of permanency who
want to use Stanford as a base
for their research.
To further complicate the
matter, each department has its
own interpretation of the term.
The department of chemistry,
for example, does not distin
guish between "research associ
ates" and "postdoctoral research
associates." In addition, survey
figures suffer because the length
of stay of each student varies
and overlaps with that of other
students,and there is a constant
changeover.
So any figures presented are
bound to be confusing. As Whit
aker commented, "We just have
no effective control on them
(the post-docs) in the area of
statistical control."
Scattered interviews with
department heads, postdoctor
al students themselves, and
others yielded more specific
information about this unde

fined group of scholars within
the university.
William R. Rambo, associate
dean of research for the School
of Engineering, agreed with Dr.
Whitaker that the "most per
plexing thing" about post-docs
is identifying them. None are
specifically identified as "post
doctoral students." But refer
ing to Whitaker's definition of
"genuine postdoctorals," he said
the Department of Electrical
Engineering, has "eight or ten"
this year.
The department of engineer
ing differs from the norm in
that certain postdoctoral stu
dents may be financed by com
panies, which send their employ
ees "back to school" to learn
new engineering techniques.
Rambo termed this the com
pany's version of the sabbatical.
Rambo commented that the
life of a professional engineer
today may be short if he is
put in an environment which
is not forward-looking and
progressive, because "What
he learned ten years ago may
be pretty well ploughed
through by now . . . His own
expertise may be out of date."
To illustrate his point, he said
that 15 years ago, an engi
neering student would have
graduated from Stanford
knowing virtually nothing
about computers.
Generally, Rambo said, engi
neering postdoctoral work is
done for pragmatic rather than
scholarly purposes, "to learn to
build better bridges," as he put
it. In addition to company-spon
sored postdoctoral students,
there is also the "man that has
what he considers to be a red
hot idea and comes here to try
it out."

that 15 years ago, an engi
neering student would have
graduated from Stanford
knowing virtually nothing
about computers.
Generally, Rambo said, engi
neering postdoctoral work is
done for pragmatic rather than
scholarly purposes, "to learn to
build better bridges," as he put
it. In addition to company-spon
sored postdoctoral students,
there is also the "man that has
what he considers to be a red
hot idea and comes here to try
it out."
Another post-doc described by
Rambo is the student who has
just recently gotten his doctor
ate. In the course of his Ph.D.
work, something new, and in
the research sense, exciting,
may have come up. But pru
dence dictated finishing his dis
sertation first. After receiving
his degree, however, he is free
to explore the new area. In this
case, he is likely to stay on at
the same university where he
did his doctoral work.

Student and his work)
