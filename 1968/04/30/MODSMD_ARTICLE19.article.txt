# Space Building Will Increase Stanford's Science Research
## 
### JIM CONE 
The new Space Engineering
and Science Building, presently
under construction at the corner
of Panama Street and Lomita
Drive, represents a major new
commitment to the future of
the space sciences and research
at Stanford.
Due for completion by Janu
ary, 1969, the four-floor, $4,460,-
000 structure is financed as a
joint project of the U.S. Air
Force, the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration
(NASA), and Stanford.
The University's share of
the building's cost, $1,380,000,
will provide classrooms, In
struction laboratories, semi

nar and conference rooms, li
brary and information storage
areas.
There also will be numerous
offices, research laboratories,
shops, and a large computer fa
cility — enough to serve approx
imately 50 faculty members, 40
research associates, and 180
graduate students from a doz
en or more departments.
Scheduled individual research,
already supported by more than
40 different grants and contracts,
will focus on the areas of space
craft guidance control, electron
ics systems, radio astronomy
and structure design.
The new building will let re
searchers centralize and coor

dinate the use of costly equip
ment for a number of different
projects as well as develop ad
ditional capabilities to handle
special needs.
While these activities will be
primarily space-oriented, at
least 11 other departments In
the Schools of Engineering
and Humanities and Sciences
will be Involved. Even a phil
osopher Is Included — one
whose research Interests In
clude mathematical studies of
human performance.
"Although research has tradi
tionally been organized along de
partmental lines," explained En
gineering Dean Joseph M. Pettit,
"most major engineering prob
lems today cross the classical
boundaries of aeronautical, elec
trical, and mechanical engineer
ing.
"It is interesting to note," he
added, "that one of the first
such research contracts ever re
ceived at Stanford was a $5,000
government award to the late
Prof. William Durand for pro
peller research during World
War I.
"It resulted In his develop
ment of the first variable pitch
propeller, and marked the be
ginning of aircraft studies at
Stanford."

The University's share of
the building's cost, $1,380,000,
will provide classrooms, In
struction laboratories, semi

nar and conference rooms, li
brary and information storage
areas.
There also will be numerous
offices, research laboratories,
shops, and a large computer fa
cility — enough to serve approx
imately 50 faculty members, 40
research associates, and 180
graduate students from a doz
en or more departments.
Scheduled individual research,
already supported by more than
40 different grants and contracts,
will focus on the areas of space
craft guidance control, electron
ics systems, radio astronomy
and structure design.
The new building will let re
searchers centralize and coor

dinate the use of costly equip
ment for a number of different
projects as well as develop ad
ditional capabilities to handle
special needs.
While these activities will be
primarily space-oriented, at
least 11 other departments In
the Schools of Engineering
and Humanities and Sciences
will be Involved. Even a phil
osopher Is Included — one
whose research Interests In
clude mathematical studies of
human performance.
"Although research has tradi
tionally been organized along de
partmental lines," explained En
gineering Dean Joseph M. Pettit,
"most major engineering prob
lems today cross the classical
boundaries of aeronautical, elec

ing.
"It is interesting to note," he
added, "that one of the first
such research contracts ever re
ceived at Stanford was a $5,000
government award to the late
Prof. William Durand for pro
peller research during World
War I.
"It resulted In his develop
ment of the first variable pitch
propeller, and marked the be
ginning of aircraft studies at
Stanford."


SPACE ENGINEERING BUILDING tn architects final drawing.
The new Space Engineering
and Science Building, presently
under construction at the corner
of Panama Street and Lomita
Drive, represents a major new
commitment to the future of
the space sciences and research
at Stanford.
Due for completion by Janu
ary, 1969, the four-floor, $4,460,-
000 structure is financed as a
joint project of the U.S. Air
Force, the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration
(NASA), and Stanford.
