# First Event Tomorrow
## Black Arts Theater Formed 
### 
A theater of the black arts,
AFRO-WEST, was officially
founded here last week, and has
already planned its first presen
tation, a poetry reading by
Johnnie Scott tomorrow night
at Beta Chi.
Scott, prime mover in this
new enterprise, said the aim of
the group was "to pave the
way for others. That's just the
way we see ourselves, breaking
ground. We're going to bring
in both known and unknown
black writers."
The new group is complete
ly independent from the
Black Student Union. "We're
not an outgrowth of BSU at
all," Scott said. "We're not
competing with BSU. BSU is
political, that's not our bag.
We're artists, and we're con
cerned with art."
AFRO-WEST will "bring
poets and playwrights to the
campus," Scott said, with the
poets reading their works, and
the group presenting produc
tions of the plays.
In order to produce the plays,
AFRO-WEST will form a stock
company of actors, Scott said.
"We're going wherever we
have to go to get these people,"
he added.

Scott's reading tomorrow
will be "Rites of Death," a
long poem which he also read
for an NBC television special
on Watts which appeared in
March.
Besides "bringing talent to
this campus," Scott also says
the group wants to "make
money" for the artists. "I don't
believe in poor poets and starv
ing playwrights," he said.
"America is too affluent for
them."
The group's productions "will
tell the truth—even if it hurts,"
Scott said. "The performing arts
are dead in western culture.
We're here to revitalize it.
"We've dedicated ourselves to
the forging of a new conscience
—the old one was part of a men
tality that could assassinate a
King, a Malcolm X, a Medgar
Evers."
But the method is cultural,
not political, he explained.
The presentations, especially
poetry readings, will be what
Scott calls "the complete art,"
with background music. This
accompanyment will include
"everything from tribal drums
from Africa to the new music—
like Otis Taylor—and rhythm

and blues —Otis Redding and
James Brown."
Although AFRO-WEST is
chartered by ASSU, most of its
funds has come from
sources," Scott said. The main
reason the group decided to got
a charter here was to get us
of the facilities on campus, he
added.
Scott declined to reveal any of
the contributors to AFRO
WEST, saying they were people
who had a "mandate of con
science."
Officers of the group are
Seott, who carries the title of
director of affairs; Art Wil
son, director of promotions;
Walter Banks, director of fi
nance; Joe Goone, director of
the exchequer; and Bob
O'lVlealiy, director of public
relations.
Scott will be publicizing the
group in the near future. He
will tape a program for KPFA
next week, which will include
readings and a discussion of
AFRO-WEST.
Scott also said he has been
approached by groups from
East Palo Alto who have asked
him to start a similar black arts
group there.
