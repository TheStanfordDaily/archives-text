# Moliere's 'Le Sicilien' Recalls Louis XIV Era
## 
### FRANK S. ALBERTI 
The flickering gas footlights
of the old Theatre du Palais-
Royal are replaced by high in
tensity spotlights just for now.
Curtain time for tonight's spe
cial performance of Moliere's
Le Sicilien ou I'Amour Pientre
is 8:00. Dinkelspiel Auditorium
is set to be transformed.
Director Jean Duschesne, visit
ing instructor in French from
the Ecole Normale
de Saint-Cloud leads us back in
time to the 17th century Thea
tre Francais. Everything is evo
cative, from the costumes to the
set.
M. Duschesne, a member of
the French student group Aqua
rium, previously won the best
director award for his interpre
tation of Musset's play Fantasio.
The similarities between the two
plays are striking and M. Duech
esne has brought all his experi
ence and flair to Moliere's farce.
The original music by Lully
which delighted the king and
his entourage has- been adapted
for this performance by visiting
Swiss Professor Paul Hooreman.
Properly bucolic the orchestra
tion follows the dancers and the
actors through this miniature
comedie-ballet.
Stephen Soderland plays the
lead role of Adraste. Dan R.

Young will recreate the role of
Dom Pedre, originally played
by Moliere. Having just return
ed from a cure of milk, Moliere
was said to be in excellent
spirits. Mr. Young is too.
He is assisted by Alan Weiner
as Hali, Adraste's slave. Mssrs.
Young and Weiner participated
in the over-seas campus produc
tion of Le Medecin MalgTe lui
at Tours.
They are joined by Kit Cam
eron as Isidore, Page Taaffe as
Climene and Ken Peterson as
the senator who proclaims a
day of merriment. Bill L. Her
bert is producer.
Helene Laroche in collabora
tion with Professor George
House has arranged the choreo
graphy. Hiss Laroche, formerly
a pupil of Mourice Bejart, is cur
rently a student of French at
Stanford.
The artifice of Moliere's come
dy is born in the poetry of the
language. The words themselves
prompt the actor's facial gest
tures. To perform Moliere is to
exalt this marvelous dramatic
poetry.
The musicians and actors of
the Department of Music's se
ries "Then and Now" do just
that. And for a moment th
spectacle of Moliere's troupe is
reborn.
