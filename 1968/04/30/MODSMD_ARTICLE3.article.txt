• LRJ vs. Goldberg
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y.
(AP)—U.S. Ambassador Arthur
J. Goldberg is making a deter
mined effort both publicly and
privately to knock down reports
that his resignation was prompt
ed by disagreement with Presi
dent Johnson.
In a statement issued Monday
"in response to press queries"
Goldberg said such reports "are
entirely without foundation."
Some newspaper dispatches
from Washington reporting
Johnson's announcement of
Goldberg's resignation last
Thursday noted that while the
President expressed regret he
voiced no praise of Goldberg.
In his statement to the press
Goldberg said the timing of his
resignation arose solely from
the fact that Johnson at his last
Cabinet meeting gave leave to
any member to resign before
the end of his administration
to meet personal needs.

new heart was beating normally
and there were no signs that he
was rejecting it. However, the

surgery at La Pitie Hospital
where the heart transplant was
performed Saturday night and
early Sunday.
