# LeRoi Jones Appears
## Blacks' Play Jolts Whites 
### MARK LITTLE 
More than a few of the 1500
white students at Memorial Au
ditorium yesterday cringed in
their seats as a black actor point
ed his .32 caliber pistol at them
and started firing.
Although the black wasn't
shooting lead, a girl in the au
dience after the performance
commented, "It was like Rus
sian roulette. We were wonder
ing when he was going to stop
shooting blanks and start using
real bullets."
The show, performed by
Leßoi Jones' Acting Com
pany, was sponsored by the
Black Student's Union who re

served the first six rows for
themselves. Farther back in
the bus, or, rather the audi
torium, were the whites who
hid behind black heads as the
fireworks began. That was the
finale which lead whites to
walk dazedly out of the audi
torium muttering comments
like, "It's an experiment in po
litical terror. Er . . . I hope
it's an experiment."
Although the show was divid
ed into poetry readings and plays
it really constituted one play in
three acts historically outlining
the history of Afro-Americans,
past, present and future.
Act one was a pantomime of
the subjugation of the Africans
and their regimentation into
slavery. Leßoi Jones played the
African thumb piano and one
of his actors played an African
flute as musical accompaniment.
The lack of dialogue symbolized
the stage of the Negroes silent
acquiescene.
Act two was a series of poetry
readings accompanied by the
African music incorporating
notably a mock trial of blacks
who didn't heed the advice of
such black militants as Patrice
Lumumba, H. Rap Brown and
Stokely Carmichael. The blacks
indicted were called "Negroes"

and charged with tolerance of
white control of society and th->
even greater charge of adhering
to white culture.
The defendants were called
treasoners and sentenced to
continued subjugation.
The next "poem" was about
the misadventures of a black
man who went to school and had
nothing but white professors,
went to work and had a white
boss, went to the movies and
saw nothing but white actors
("except Sidney Portier, ha, ha,
ha!"), "went to church and
what color was Christ?—white,
white, white! the hippy, the
white sissy."
The third act of Jones' per
formance was a play about the
decline and fall of the white
race and the celluloid society.
As the scene opens a number of
black actors dressed and made
up as white people are in an of
fice, but instead of working they
are watching television. They
are dressed as "flusies" and
"fops".
A black man enters the of-<
fice to apply for a job, carry
ing a pistol not for any speci
fic purpose but just as part of
his general attire. He ridicules
them and orders them around.

The "whites" represent the de
cadence of white society and,
significantly white masks are
plastic. They speak a foreign
language neither he nor the au
dience can understand. cul
ture is obviously totally alien to
any that the "normal" black
man knows.
Several friends of the black
man show up and start a party
and the exhaustion tires the
weaker white people to the point
at which their innate automa
tism is all they have left and
everything the white man says
comes out like a "This is a re
cording" telephone operator.
The whites then die of exhaus
tion.
One of the black men cele
brates the fall of the whites and
the rise of the blacks by firing
the pistol out into the audience.
The only visible response of the
shots were the rumblings of
mass hysteria in the audience
and a lot of smoke from the
blanks fired.
The party has lasted all night
and as the play concludes the
blacks are joyous to see the
sun rising. The white audience,
unfortunately, cannot see the
sunrise due to the thick smoke
in the way.

PARADISE REGAINED — The Leßoi Jones acting company performing; the black interpretation
of the second coming. After whites usurped the achievements of black civilization and subjugated
them for centuries, the black man rises again and forces the white man to "fall". The black man
(above) is forcing the white back into the cave from which he had originally emerged.
