# High School Seniors Look At Stanford For Next Year
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
Last Saturday over 300 high
school seniors were on campus
in an effort to find out if Stan
ford is really the college for
them. All of the students had
been accepted by the Admissions
Office, but it remained for these
students to decide for them
selves whether they wanted to
come here.
The students were presented
with a wide ranging program of
speeches, movies, panels, and
tours. Bob Mallek, Cardinal's
Board member in charge of the
event, described the day as an
attempt at "not so much selling
Stanford as simply acquainting
them with it."
Most of the seniors had al
ready decided to come. How
ever for quite a few who
hadn't made up their minds
yet the day was an opportuni
ty to form impressions and
answer questions.
At the start many of the visit
ors were nervous. Conversations
at the Tresidder coffee break in
mid-morning rarely seemed to
get beyond the"The people are
so nice and the weather is so
beautiful" level.
Following the break, there was
i discussion of residence options

available to freshmen next year.
The panel included three stu
dents. Barbara Kirby from Ro
ble, Margaret Ishiyama from
Serra, and John a Rin
eonada sponsor, as well as Prof.
Lewis Spitz, chairmen of the
SES housing committee, and
Sally Mahoney, Assistant Dean
of Students.
The audience was deeply in
terested in what the panel had
to say, since many were un
aware of the coed living
groups that exist now. Ques
tions after the talk attempted
to discover the limits of coed
living's advantages.
"What will be the ratio of
boys to girls? What can I ex
pect?" queried a suspicious
male. When Miss Mahoney said
that the incoming freshman
class will be made up of 440
women and 850 men, all the
males booed loudly, drowning
out the girls' cheers.
Another question asked about
lock out hours, and Miss Mahon
ey replied that the limit was
2:30 a.m. This hour was received
with pleased murmurs.
The seniors then split up into
groups of seven hoys or seven
girls, and headed off to fresh
man dorms for lunch with their

tour guides. Quite a few arrived
at Branner to investigate into
the all-freshmen, coed dorm. Af
ter some initial confusion over
which bathrooms were for men
and which for women, the sen
iors wandered through the
rooms, asking freshman what
they thought of Branner life.
Nearly all of the vistors
were anxious to know what
"pressures" existed during the
first year. As one girl put it,
"Stanford scares me because
♦ here are so many high school
presidents and newspaper edi
tors. I don't want to go to a
place like that." She has de
cided to attend LJC at Santa
Cruz instead.
Several students tried to find
out how hard the first quarter
was. "How many units do you
have to take?" "Did you find
that college education was a lot
different?" The fear of tough
competition for grades effected
a lot of the seniors.
Around the student guides the
seniors became visibly more re
laxed. They began asking about
specific courses and what dorm
social life was like. The ques
tions shifted from "where do
you live?" to "Will the sponsor
buy up for us or not?"

At the start many of the visit
ors were nervous. Conversations
at the Tresidder coffee break in
mid-morning rarely seemed to
get beyond the"The people are
so nice and the weather is so
beautiful" level.
Following the break, there was
i discussion of residence options

available to freshmen next year.
The panel included three stu
dents. Barbara Kirby from Ro
ble, Margaret Ishiyama from
Serra, and John a Rin
eonada sponsor, as well as Prof.
Lewis Spitz, chairmen of the
SES housing committee, and
Sally Mahoney, Assistant Dean
of Students.
The audience was deeply in
terested in what the panel had
to say, since many were un
aware of the coed living
groups that exist now. Ques
tions after the talk attempted
to discover the limits of coed
living's advantages.
"What will be the ratio of
boys to girls? What can I ex
pect?" queried a suspicious
male. When Miss Mahoney said
that the incoming freshman
class will be made up of 440
women and 850 men, all the
males booed loudly, drowning
out the girls' cheers.
Another question asked about
lock out hours, and Miss Mahon
ey replied that the limit was
2:30 a.m. This hour was received
with pleased murmurs.
The seniors then split up into
groups of seven hoys or seven
girls, and headed off to fresh
man dorms for lunch with their

tour guides. Quite a few arrived
at Branner to investigate into
the all-freshmen, coed dorm. Af
ter some initial confusion over
which bathrooms were for men
and which for women, the sen
iors wandered through the
rooms, asking freshman what
they thought of Branner life.
Nearly all of the vistors
were anxious to know what
"pressures" existed during the
first year. As one girl put it,
"Stanford scares me because
♦ here are so many high school
presidents and newspaper edi
tors. I don't want to go to a
place like that." She has de
cided to attend LJC at Santa
Cruz instead.
Several students tried to find
out how hard the first quarter
was. "How many units do you
have to take?" "Did you find
that college education was a lot
different?" The fear of tough
competition for grades effected
a lot of the seniors.
Around the student guides the
seniors became visibly more re
laxed. They began asking about
specific courses and what dorm
social life was like. The ques
tions shifted from "where do
you live?" to "Will the sponsor
buy up for us or not?"
Last Saturday over 300 high
school seniors were on campus
in an effort to find out if Stan
ford is really the college for
them. All of the students had
been accepted by the Admissions
Office, but it remained for these
students to decide for them
selves whether they wanted to
come here.
The students were presented
with a wide ranging program of
speeches, movies, panels, and
tours. Bob Mallek, Cardinal's
Board member in charge of the
event, described the day as an
attempt at "not so much selling
Stanford as simply acquainting
them with it."
Most of the seniors had al
ready decided to come. How
ever for quite a few who
hadn't made up their minds
yet the day was an opportuni
ty to form impressions and
answer questions.
