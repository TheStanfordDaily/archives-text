# Opposing Students Clash At Columbia
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) â€”Colum
bia University demonstrators,
with Negroes in their vangaurd,
fought their way through a fist
swinging student blockade Mon
day to bring food to a sit-in
force occupying President Gray
son Kirk's office. Later, the
blockade runners were pushed
back after tossing food to the
sit-ins.
A group of about 80 Negro
and white students, sympathetic
to their self-imprisoned fellow
demonstrators, chanted "Black
Power" and "Food Power" be

fore rushing a superior force of
200 blockaders opposed to the
demonstrations.
There were no reports of in
juries in the brief punching
and kicking match on the Low
Memorial Library lawn outside
Kirk's second floor office.
It was the first clash of any
magnitude between opposing
groups of Columbia students
during a week-long militant up
rising that has disrupted the Ivy
League campus.
Sit-ins by 500 to 600 demon
strators protesting a university

building expansion program
have brought a halt to educa
tional activities for most of
Columbia's 27,500-member stu
dent body.
The university classrooms
were deserted again Monday as
the sit-ins refused to budge
from five buildings they have
occupied unless granted am
nesty.
Possibility of a break in the
deadlock came when Kirk said
he was willing to accept a stu
d~nt-faculty-administrative com
mittee of 12 to act as a court of
appeals for any punishment
meted out to the demonstrators.
Such a committee had been rec
ommended by a faculty group.
Meanwhile, a sixth building,
Uris Hall, was seized by 300
nondemonstrating students, who
said they wanted to keep it out
of the hands of rebels who
might shut it down.
Over the weekend, about 200
nondemonstrating students
launched their blockade of the
Low Library in an effort to
starve out 100 or so rebels in
Kirk's office.
Paul Vilardi, a pre-medical
student and former football
player, said his blockade group
was in sympathy with the sit
in's aims but not with the tac
tics.
The blockade thwarted initial
efforts to replenish the food sup
plies of the sit-ins in Kirk's of
five. Also barred from entering
was an unidentified woman who
said she was a doctor and who
tried to bring a shopping bag
full of medical supplies into the
library.
The blockaders spent the
night bivouaced on the lawn out
side the library in rather chilly
spring temperatures. With the
dawn, they shook themselves
out of blankets.
The student demonstrations
began April 23, with a group
of Students for an Afro-Ameri
can Society protesting Colum
bia's plans to build an $11.5 mil
lion gymnasium on two of 30
acres in Morningside Park. The
city-owned recreational area
separates Columbia from Har
lem.
The protestors, joined by
white Students for a Democratic
Society .contended Columbia's
expansion onto city-owned park
land deprived the Harlem com
munity of needed recreational
space.
The white students also de
manded an end to Columbia's
participation in a defense-or
iented government research
project, which they linked with
the war in Vietnam.
The university last week
agreed to suspend construction
of the gym at least temporarily.
However, the demonstrations
continued, with the students In
sisting on total amnesty. Presi
dent Kirk already was on record
as saying they were liable to
disciplinary action for violating
university regulations.
The gym was to be divided
into two sections, one for uni
versity undergraduates and the
other for residents of Harlem.
Although hailed at first by
some Negro leaders, the gym
project later became a symbol
raised by Negro militants of a
separate but equal form of
segregation.
