# Hoskins Draw Set
## 
### 
Women wishing to live in Hos
kins in Escondido Village next
year must participate in a gen
eral draw tomorrow or Thurs
day in the Dean of Students Of
fice on the third floor of the Old
Union.
Students must draw in pairs
for the high-rise apartments.
Priority will be given first to
seniors, then juniors, and last to
sophomores. If women from dif
ferent classes form a pair, its
priority will be that of the lower
class.
Results of the draw will be
announced Friday.
The Hoskins draw is separate
from the general housing draw
which will be next week.
Women chosen by this draw
to live in Hoskins may still par
ticipate later in the general
draw and list Hoskins as their
present residence. However, the
pair must enter the general
draw as a unit.
A separate waiting list for
Hoskins will be kept to fill
spaces vacated by Hoskins resi
dents who choose to live else
where. Students can decide to
live off-campus up until June 1
without forfeiting their room
deposit.
