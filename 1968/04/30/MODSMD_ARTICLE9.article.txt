# The 						Inevitable
## 
### 
The events last week at two universities provide Stanford with
a grim warning and a model for change.
At Columbia University hundreds of students forced the ad
ministration to cancel classes by occupying several buildings, in
cluding the president's office. Compared to their strong protest
action, the students' grievances seemed minor. But the campus
mood was ugly, radical leaders had the initiative, and there was
no restraining force for compromise. And now the barricades are
literally raised across the classroom doors.
Meanwhile the University of Oregon also had a sit-in protest.
But it was settled in a fashion which will help avoid future polar
ization of the university into administrators, faculty and students,
with inevitable conflict as a result.
Oregon's experience is a! 1 the more remarkable because the
protest concerned something of tremendous importance to the
university's welfare — the selection of a new president. The stu
dents won the right to have tliree representatives on a nine-mem
ber committee that will search for a new president.
The Oregon administration apparently has realized that its
concession on presidential selection must be duplicated in spirit
and fact throughout the university. Roy Lieuallan, chancellor of
the State Board of Higher Education, called the settlement "part
of a desirable and inevitable trend toward community govern
ment" of the university.
Only a fool would deny that the internal convulsions rocking
universities throughout the nation will eventually come to
Stanford. And anyone in a position of responsibility here would
he equally a fool to be aware of the threat of disruptive con
flict and still do nothing to remove its cause.
Stanford could be closed down for trivial reasons, as at Colum
bia. Or a determined sit-in with wide student support could force
the trustees to grant student demands, amid the glare of national
publicity and with all the residual bitterness resulting from a
bald use of force. Or Stanford could learn the lesson of Oregon
and move toward communiy government without being pushed.
Community government does not mean abject surrender to the
whims of student radicals, on the Latin American or Italian model.
It does not mean abandonment of the principle, so often enun
ciated by Wallace Sterling, that a university must be concerned
with a troubled society yet preserve a certain scholarly detach
ment.
And community government is not a bitter pill that a student
mob will force the Establishment to swallow. A university with
out vigorous student participation in its decision-making is a
dead university, alien to progress and antithetical to education.
Stanford is slowly awakening from the dead.
The recent agreements with the Black Student Union were a
promising sign at Stanford, although Provost Richard Lyman
had to protect himself three days later by insisting that at no
point . . . has the power to make decisions in academic matters
been delegated to any group of students." There may be other
promising changes soon, or else foolhardy recalcitrance. On the
judicial system, formulation of campus regulations, student voice
in the Academic Senate and its committees, and integrity of the
Associated Students, this University will advance or it will danger
ously stagnate.
And then there is the selection of a new president. After sixteen
months of search, a trustee-faculty committee has evidently fail
ed to find a suitable successor to Wallace Sterling. At least we
would assume so, not having heard a single progress report from
the selection committee since it started its work. So the trustees
have an opportunity to follow the progressive example of Oregon
and involve the student body in the selection of a man who will
probably exert a decisive influence on the quality of a Stanford
education. The selection committee could issue a progress report
on its work. It could consult the newly-elected ASSU president
and other student representatives in its continuing search.
Or the trustees and other established groups can do nothing
at all about community government, closing their eyes and ears
to an impatient, idealistic student spirit which is stirring the
nation and the world. Then they will find themselves the prison
ers of events, sooner than they think.

ously stagnate.
And then there is the selection of a new president. After sixteen
months of search, a trustee-faculty committee has evidently fail
ed to find a suitable successor to Wallace Sterling. At least we
would assume so, not having heard a single progress report from
the selection committee since it started its work. So the trustees
have an opportunity to follow the progressive example of Oregon
and involve the student body in the selection of a man who will
probably exert a decisive influence on the quality of a Stanford
education. The selection committee could issue a progress report
on its work. It could consult the newly-elected ASSU president
and other student representatives in its continuing search.
Or the trustees and other established groups can do nothing
at all about community government, closing their eyes and ears
to an impatient, idealistic student spirit which is stirring the
nation and the world. Then they will find themselves the prison
ers of events, sooner than they think.
The events last week at two universities provide Stanford with
a grim warning and a model for change.
At Columbia University hundreds of students forced the ad
ministration to cancel classes by occupying several buildings, in
cluding the president's office. Compared to their strong protest
action, the students' grievances seemed minor. But the campus
mood was ugly, radical leaders had the initiative, and there was
no restraining force for compromise. And now the barricades are
literally raised across the classroom doors.
Meanwhile the University of Oregon also had a sit-in protest.
But it was settled in a fashion which will help avoid future polar
ization of the university into administrators, faculty and students,
with inevitable conflict as a result.
Oregon's experience is a! 1 the more remarkable because the
protest concerned something of tremendous importance to the
university's welfare — the selection of a new president. The stu
dents won the right to have tliree representatives on a nine-mem
ber committee that will search for a new president.
The Oregon administration apparently has realized that its
concession on presidential selection must be duplicated in spirit
and fact throughout the university. Roy Lieuallan, chancellor of
the State Board of Higher Education, called the settlement "part
of a desirable and inevitable trend toward community govern
ment" of the university.
Only a fool would deny that the internal convulsions rocking
universities throughout the nation will eventually come to
Stanford. And anyone in a position of responsibility here would
he equally a fool to be aware of the threat of disruptive con
flict and still do nothing to remove its cause.
Stanford could be closed down for trivial reasons, as at Colum
bia. Or a determined sit-in with wide student support could force
the trustees to grant student demands, amid the glare of national
publicity and with all the residual bitterness resulting from a
bald use of force. Or Stanford could learn the lesson of Oregon
and move toward communiy government without being pushed.
Community government does not mean abject surrender to the
whims of student radicals, on the Latin American or Italian model.
It does not mean abandonment of the principle, so often enun
ciated by Wallace Sterling, that a university must be concerned
with a troubled society yet preserve a certain scholarly detach
ment.
And community government is not a bitter pill that a student
mob will force the Establishment to swallow. A university with
out vigorous student participation in its decision-making is a
dead university, alien to progress and antithetical to education.
Stanford is slowly awakening from the dead.
The recent agreements with the Black Student Union were a
promising sign at Stanford, although Provost Richard Lyman
had to protect himself three days later by insisting that at no
point . . . has the power to make decisions in academic matters
been delegated to any group of students." There may be other
promising changes soon, or else foolhardy recalcitrance. On the
judicial system, formulation of campus regulations, student voice
in the Academic Senate and its committees, and integrity of the
Associated Students, this University will advance or it will danger
ously stagnate.
