# 'Topless' ASSU Candidate Has Eligibility Confirmed
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
In the course of yesterday's
campaigning, Vicky Drake, a
sexy candidate in the "tradition
of the R.F.," was in the race,
out of the race, and back in
again.
Meanwhile, outside of her
flurry of nationwide newspaper
coverage and local radio and
TV announcements, another
slate of candidates for ASSU
president and vice-president
withdrew, while the other four
slates remaining in the race
continued with their campaigns.
Joe Reich and Jeff Kane said
in withdrawing from the race,
"Our enemies will stop at noth
ing."
Reich's withdrawal narrow
ed the field of presidential
candidates to Michael Bruwer,
Vicki Drake, Denis Hayes,
Harvey H. Hukari and Hugh
McDonald. A primary election
open to registered students
next Tuesday and Wednesday
will choose two of them for a
run off May 14-15.
"The more confusion the bet
ter," said ASSU presidential
hopeful Vicki Drake, a some
time topless dancer, who has
completed nine quarters of work
at Stanford under the names of
Victoria Bowles and Victoria
Bowles Reich.
Miss Drake's student status
first came into question when
Dean of Students Joel Smith re
leased the following tongue-in

cheek statement in response to
outside press inquiries:
"While Miss Drake's cam
paign has barely begun, it prom
ises to be diverting. She clearly
is a young woman of conspicu
ous talent. But the fact which
tops it off is that she is not now
a Stanford student and there
fore is not eligible for student
office. That fact should cover
up the entire matter."
But Elections Commissioner
Craig Brown said later in the
day, "As far as I am con
cerned, she can run."
The ASSU constitution says
only that students who are not
currently enrolled can run for
election if they are students in
the academic quarter immedi
ately preceding the election.
Miss Drake has completed six
continuous quarters of aca
demic work since the fall of
1966, and she plans to enroll
next fall.
Legislature Speaker Michael
Weinstoin made a preliminary
ruling yesterday that Miss
Drake be allowed to run.
If that decision is contested,
it will be brought up at the
LASSU meeting sehedul?d for
next Thursday night.
Both Weinstein and ASSU
President Cesare Massarenti
have indicated that they do not
intend to call a special legisla
ture meeting to consider the is
sue and predicted that the group
would approve Miss Drake's

running, should further ques
tions of her eligibility arise.
Later yesterday afternoon
Dean Smith clarified his stance:
"For those who lack a sense
of humor," Smith said, "I am
eager to explain that my
statement was intended as a
joke. Of course student gov
ernment at Stanford has the
authority to determine who is
an eligible candidate for stu
dent office."
The remaining candidates in
dicated that they had no objec
tions to Miss Drake's campaign
ing and urged her to run.
In an effort to provide more
exposure of the candidates,
Craig Brown has called a can
didates' meeting at 5 p.m. today
to set up a series of White
Plaza debates.
Mac Donald has requested the
plaza for Thursday, while Hu
kari has reserved it for Friday
and Monday. Both have indicat-

Ed a willingness to debate the
other candidates.
The Daily will carry a forum
of the candidates' platform
statements on Friday.
A majority of the vote cast
on May 7 and 8 is required for
election in the primary. Should
no candidate receive a majority,
the two candidates with the
most votes will meet in a run
off on May 14 and 15.
In addition to the presidential
and vice-presidential race, there
will be ten propositions on the
ballot. As of yet, the elections
/commission has not received
them.
Several posters went up to
day, and candidates are begin
ning to distribute position fly
ers throughout the living
groups. Miss Drake's posters,
which showed her posed in the
nude by a marble column of the
Masoleum, were all taken
down for souvenirs by noon.

sexy candidate in the "tradition
of the R.F.," was in the race,
out of the race, and back in
again.
Meanwhile, outside of her
flurry of nationwide newspaper
coverage and local radio and
TV announcements, another
slate of candidates for ASSU
president and vice-president
withdrew, while the other four
slates remaining in the race
continued with their campaigns.
Joe Reich and Jeff Kane said
in withdrawing from the race,
"Our enemies will stop at noth
ing."
Reich's withdrawal narrow
ed the field of presidential
candidates to Michael Bruwer,
Vicki Drake, Denis Hayes,
Harvey H. Hukari and Hugh
McDonald. A primary election
open to registered students
next Tuesday and Wednesday
will choose two of them for a
run off May 14-15.
"The more confusion the bet
ter," said ASSU presidential
hopeful Vicki Drake, a some
time topless dancer, who has
completed nine quarters of work
at Stanford under the names of
Victoria Bowles and Victoria
Bowles Reich.
Miss Drake's student status
first came into question when
Dean of Students Joel Smith re
leased the following tongue-in

cheek statement in response to
outside press inquiries:
"While Miss Drake's cam
paign has barely begun, it prom
ises to be diverting. She clearly
is a young woman of conspicu
ous talent. But the fact which
tops it off is that she is not now
a Stanford student and there
fore is not eligible for student
office. That fact should cover
up the entire matter."
But Elections Commissioner
Craig Brown said later in the
day, "As far as I am con
cerned, she can run."
The ASSU constitution says
only that students who are not
currently enrolled can run for
election if they are students in
the academic quarter immedi
ately preceding the election.
Miss Drake has completed six
continuous quarters of aca
demic work since the fall of
1966, and she plans to enroll
next fall.
Legislature Speaker Michael
Weinstoin made a preliminary
ruling yesterday that Miss
Drake be allowed to run.
If that decision is contested,
it will be brought up at the
LASSU meeting sehedul?d for
next Thursday night.
Both Weinstein and ASSU
President Cesare Massarenti
have indicated that they do not
intend to call a special legisla
ture meeting to consider the is
sue and predicted that the group
would approve Miss Drake's

running, should further ques
tions of her eligibility arise.
Later yesterday afternoon
Dean Smith clarified his stance:
"For those who lack a sense
of humor," Smith said, "I am
eager to explain that my
statement was intended as a
joke. Of course student gov
ernment at Stanford has the
authority to determine who is
an eligible candidate for stu
dent office."
The remaining candidates in
dicated that they had no objec
tions to Miss Drake's campaign
ing and urged her to run.
In an effort to provide more
exposure of the candidates,
Craig Brown has called a can
didates' meeting at 5 p.m. today
to set up a series of White
Plaza debates.
Mac Donald has requested the
plaza for Thursday, while Hu
kari has reserved it for Friday
and Monday. Both have indicat-

Ed a willingness to debate the
other candidates.
The Daily will carry a forum
of the candidates' platform
statements on Friday.
A majority of the vote cast
on May 7 and 8 is required for
election in the primary. Should
no candidate receive a majority,
the two candidates with the
most votes will meet in a run
off on May 14 and 15.
In addition to the presidential
and vice-presidential race, there
will be ten propositions on the
ballot. As of yet, the elections
/commission has not received
them.
Several posters went up to
day, and candidates are begin
ning to distribute position fly
ers throughout the living
groups. Miss Drake's posters,
which showed her posed in the
nude by a marble column of the
Masoleum, were all taken
down for souvenirs by noon.
