# Statement By Sit-In Students
## 
### JACK GERSON MARC SAPIR 
On the day after the BSU confrontation with
the Administration in Memorial Auditorium, the
Daily reported an edict by President Wallace
Sterling which declared, in effect, that LASSU's
ruling against the legitimacy and authority of
the Interim Judicial Body (IJB) would not be
tolerated. Students who defy the authority of
this Body or other Administration fronts will
face severe punishment, Sterling intimated.
Because four of the students singled out for
intimidation and prosecution are no longer reg
istered at Stanford, and two others are no longer
involved in the case, it falls upon us alone to state
emphatically that we will not cower or submit
to the arrogance of power. Although we are cur
rently without any organizational support, we
believe that insofar as the question of blatant
and unwarranted intimidation and authoritarian
ism is concerned, we represent LASSU, the
ASSU president, the Judicial Council, and the
student body at large.
We do not intend to hide our radical anti-im
perialist political position. Rather we want to
make it clear that this situation does grow out

of our politics and our activism. But more than
that, the attitude and the prosecution we face
is not directed solely at demonstrations or at
radical activists. It is, all in all, the frantic at
tempt by institutional power to maintain the
status quo to prevent ascendency of a new cul
ture that will give power to people rather than
to bureaucracies and institutions.
The irony of the Administration's accession
to BSU demands simultaneously with a harden
ing of administrative attitudes towards anti
authoritarianism is clear. The university is will
ing to relinquish even a fraction of its control
only grudingly, and only in reaction to external
events such as the assassination of Dr. King.
But even then, it must immediately react by
tightening the hold in another area.
The administration would like to do this quiet
ly, accepting praise for their concessions to the
BSU while concealing their outright flaunting of
LASSU and the Student Judicial Council's juris
diction. We are deeply concerned that our rights
are being trampled, but we also feel that more
than just the punishment of the CIA defendants
is at stake. If they can do it to us, they can do
it to you.
