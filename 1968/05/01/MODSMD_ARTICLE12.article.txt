WASHINGTON â€” It was
bound to happen. The students
of Goodcheer University, after
having attained all their goals,
had nothing more to demon
strate about. They called a mass
meeting on the quadrangle in
front of the administration
building.
"Students." yelled Hardin Hel
razor, "we have run out of de
mands. The administration has
given in to our every wish, and

if we don't come up with some
thing soon, we may have to go
back to classes."
Loud booing.
"Why can't we demand that
boys and girls live in the same
rooms?" a student shouted.
"They can, stupid," another
student shouted. "We got that
privilege when we locked up the
football coach for three days
itt the shower room."
"Why don't we demand that
no teacher can be hired without
first going through a year of
hazing at one of the fraterni
ties?" another student said.
"Idiot, that was put through
after we burned down the sci
ence building," Helrazor said.
"Oh, I thought we burned
down the science building be
cause they wouldn't give us a
coffee break during tests."
"No, we got the coffee break
after we kidnapped the dean of
men."
We Have It All
'Come on, students, don't just
stand there with your tongues
sticking out," Helrazor said.
"There must be something we
want that they haven't given
us."
"What about parking space?"
a coed cried. "We don't have
enough parking space."
"We got them to tear down
the medical school to give us
more parking space," Helrazor
said. "It would be hard to go
back to them again with that
one."

"Free love in the library,"
someone shouted.
"We're allowed to have free
love in the library now."
"Yeh, but you have to show
your student union card. If it's
free, it should be free for non
students as well as students."
"Let's kidnap the dean of the
law school, and let them come
up with some ideas," a bearded
youth yelled.
"Yeh," his companion shouted.
"Why should we have to think
up our demands all the time?
The school has a responsibility
to make some up for us."
Loud cheering.
Helrazor said, "That's playing
the administration's game.
They'd love to think up student
demands they could give in to.
But what kind of demonstration
is that? I say this time we have
to go for broke. They've got to
believe we mean business. Oth
erwise, they'll have us back in
those classes studying all that
garbage. Is that what we came
to college for?"
Chorus: "No!"
"I've got it. I've got it. Let's
hold a demonstration protest
ing the fact that the administra
tion has given in to all our de
mands," a student said.
"They're patronizing us."
"They've taken our pride
away from us."
Muttering from the crowd.
"We're sick and tired of liv
ing in a permissive society."
Helrazor tried to restore or
der. "It may work. We'll lock

the dean of women in the drama
department and won't let her
out unless the university takes
disciplinary action against us.
We want our manhood back."
"If they give us an amnesty,
we'll tear the faculty club
apart."
After the dean of women was
held for four days, the adminis
tration of Goodcheer University
finally gave in and agreed to
punish all the troublemakers in
the school.
It was the demonstrators'
finest hour. Goodcheer has been
served notice that if, in the fu
ture, they refuse to discipline
any student for an infraction,
the student union will be burned
to the ground.
