## Student Interest Strikes Out 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Supposedly, university stu
dents are "interested in" and
"concerned about" the major is
sues of the day. If only 100 stu
dents out of 11,000 can be en
couraged to hear Senator Al
bert Gore — a United States
Senator, a member of the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Commit
tee and an advocate of a nego
iated withdrawal from Vietnam
since 1964 — we must ask
whether this interest and con
cern stops at the classroom
door.
The money which supports
Political Union, which pays the
honoraria of men such as Sen
ator Gore, is taken from ASSU
funds, in turn taken from tui
tion fees. Each student is pay
ing for the programs Political
Union presents, and we can
only wonder why we, as Board
members, expend time, energy
— and money — in the face of
such an obvious lack of sup

port.
It's an embarrassing situation
for the few in attendance and
we can only imagine the dis
mal view of Stanford students
Senator Gore will relate to his
colleagues in the Senate. Ob
viously, Stanford is not prepared
to entertain such visitors.
On the face of it, this appears
to be simply apathy. But the
fact that the Daily, with its
monopoly on news, determines
at its whim, whether men such
as Senator Gore, Robert Scheer
or Eldon Griffiths (MP) will re
ceive front-page coverage as
suring them an adequate audi
ence, or be reduced to a 4-inch
story on p. 3 or a 3-paragraph
story of p. 5. Meanwhile we
see pictures of Stanford dollies
lounging on the pier at Lake
Lag on the front page. Respon
sible journalism?

... Is it not strange, given her
(Miss Alpert) and her friends'
evident intensity of feeling, that
none of them made an attempt
to get the facts straight or to
seek consultation with the De
partment? I am ready to dis
cuss all these matters with any
student who may wish to speak
with me. I am willing to guide
Miss Alpert and her friends
through the building site of the
new Art Building and take them
to the "token exhibitions" at
the Museum. But I had never
received a request from any of
them, for any discussion or con
sultation, before they released
their offensive blast.

Editor, The Daily:
Supposedly, university stu
dents are "interested in" and
"concerned about" the major is
sues of the day. If only 100 stu
dents out of 11,000 can be en
couraged to hear Senator Al
bert Gore — a United States
Senator, a member of the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Commit
tee and an advocate of a nego
iated withdrawal from Vietnam
since 1964 — we must ask
whether this interest and con
cern stops at the classroom
door.
The money which supports
Political Union, which pays the
honoraria of men such as Sen
ator Gore, is taken from ASSU
funds, in turn taken from tui
tion fees. Each student is pay
ing for the programs Political
Union presents, and we can
only wonder why we, as Board
members, expend time, energy
— and money — in the face of
such an obvious lack of sup

port.
It's an embarrassing situation
for the few in attendance and
we can only imagine the dis
mal view of Stanford students
Senator Gore will relate to his
colleagues in the Senate. Ob
viously, Stanford is not prepared
to entertain such visitors.
On the face of it, this appears
to be simply apathy. But the
fact that the Daily, with its
monopoly on news, determines
at its whim, whether men such
as Senator Gore, Robert Scheer
or Eldon Griffiths (MP) will re
ceive front-page coverage as
suring them an adequate audi
ence, or be reduced to a 4-inch
story on p. 3 or a 3-paragraph
story of p. 5. Meanwhile we
see pictures of Stanford dollies
lounging on the pier at Lake
Lag on the front page. Respon
