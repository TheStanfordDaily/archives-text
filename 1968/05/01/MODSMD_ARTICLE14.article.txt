# Two Minutes of Haight
## Tell The World Who's Crazy 
### Tim Haight 
You must see the motion pic
ture "King of Hearts". In it, a
British soldier is sent into a
French town which the Germans
have planted with explosives. At
midnight, all the TNT will go
off unless the soldier can find
the timer.
The town is deserted, except
for the left-behind inmates of
the local insane asylum. They
get loose and create, with the
help of the possessions left be
hind by the fleeing townspeople,
a wonderland of kings, dukes,
prostitutes, ballet dancers,
bears, lions, and generals.
It is a completely mad — and
beautiful — scene. I may see
the picture again just for the
pure visual kick of it. In the
end, though, the British and
Germans both enter the town at
the same time and kill each
other to the man, except for the
hero, who is with the nuts at
the time.
Hero and his carrier pigeon
are decorated — equally — by
the returning French, and he is
instructed to proceed to another
German-occupied town to blow
it up. Going past the insane
asylum with his new platoon,
the hero jumps truck. The nuns
find him at the gate of the
mental hosiptal, completely
nude, holding his birdcage.
Beautiful Insanity
The effect of the picture is
to make the viewer choose this
beautiful insanity over the mad

ness of war. I can really dig
it. But immediately a sort of
melancholy comes, as all the
bullshit about values, interests,
coercion, ideology, and politics
descends around me.
I mean, if I went to a profes
sor and told him how I felt he
would sympathize with me and
then recite the various self-jus
tifying phrases that have allow
ed him to float around on his
little island of "sanity" in a
cruel, rotten, selfish world.
I would be called naive. It's
like that bumper sticker, "Sup
pose they gave a war and no
body came?" Everybody knows
that the vicious old John Wayne
types will rig the laws so that
you will go to jail if you prefer
not to kill. The discussion there
fore must shift to how to turn
John Wayne on, the very
thought of which constitutes a
reductlo ad absurdam.
Murderers All
Naturally, we then consider
how to force John Wayne to
change his behavior, if not his
mind. Failing that, we buy an
M-16 and a full size poster from
"El Dorado" or "The Green 1
Berets". By this time people

are calling us potential murder
ers, too. And they are right.
So there we are. Meanwhile,
wife or girlfriend wants some
entertainment or thing. The pay
ment on the car is due. The
midterm is the day after to
morrow. Well, it was a good
movie, "King of Hearts." That's
the way we die a little.
But wait. Instead of getting
caught up in this bag-talking
and feeling bad as the tides of
insanity softly waft us away
to smiling participation in ra
cism and war and inhumanity
— what if each of us could just
tell this vast technological em
pire, which is depending on our
egos and brains, to jump in the
lake?
I mean, we could get some
sort of job and keep things to
gether. And we could pool re
sources. And we could even en
tertain each other. You know,
talented human beings have a lot
to offer each other, once the TV
breaks.
And we could even say that

we would bug two more people,
preferably professors or others
whose absence would hurt the
John Wayne Machine, until they
decided it was more beautiful to
be crazy than to be murderously
sane.
That would be really wonder
ful. Think of it. What if all of
Stanford University just told
the world, "You are crazy. We
are not going to train or be
trained to fit into the channels
of your Empires any more."
We could get to know each
other. We could go places and
help people who asked for help.
We could make ends meet with
out compromising if we really
tried. And it could have a bit of
the magic, of the love, of that
movie about the crazy people.
Of course, this will never hap
pen. None of us think enough of
ourselves to think we could sur
vive without Math Technology.
None of us t*ust others to go
with us. None of us think we
could convince anybody. And
that's really sad.
