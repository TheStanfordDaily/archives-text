# Editorial Policy

### 
• SIGNED COLUMNS reflect
the writer's views only. The
DAILY will consider guest col
umns, in addition to our regular
features.
• LETTERS will be printed at
the discretion of the editor and
may be shortened or subject to
other editing. Only signed letters
typed with double-spacing will be
considered.
