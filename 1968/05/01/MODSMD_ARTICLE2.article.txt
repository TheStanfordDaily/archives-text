# CIA Sit-In Defendants Ignore IJB Summons
## 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON 
Nine of the ten CIA sit-in
case defendants failed to show
up at last night's Interim Judi
cial Body (IJB) hearing.
The tenth, Yale Braunstein,
appeared with an attorney for
the hearing in front of the all
faculty group. The non-appear
ance of the nine defendants
came after student body lead
ers had urged the students to
Ignore the summons of the IJB.
In a letter to the ten students
yesterday ASSU President Ce
sare Massarenti asked the dem
onstrators to refuse to recog
nize the jurisdiction of the
group. Legislature speaker
Michael Weinstein joined Mas
sarenti in the request.
In a statement published in
today's Daily demonstrators
Marc Sapir and Jack Gerson
say they do not recognize the
jurisdiction of what they call a
"kangaroo court,"and that they
"will not cower or submit to
the arrogance of power."
The action stems from last
November's anti-CIA sit-in at
Encina Hall. The ten are accus
ed of violating the University's
policy on campus demonstra
tions which outlaws any protests
which interfere with "vehicular
or pedestrian traffic."

All ten students were found
not guilty by the student judi
cial council in a unanimous de
cision. The student judicial coun
cil includes r>ne faculty member,
Lorie Tarshis, executive head
of the economics department.
After the adverse decision Dean
of Students Joel Smith appealed
the case to the IJB.
Massarenti, Gerson and Sapir
attack the competence of the
faculty group on several
grounds. Massarenti says the
faculty group exists despite the
recommendation of a President
ial commission that a faculty
student appeal group be set up.
Massarenti says he believes
that the students should first
be tried by the judicial council
and that any appeals should be
handled by a student-faculty
group. Massarenti also pointed
out that in normal judicial mat
ters a prosecutor does not have
the right to appeal an adverse
decision on any but procedural
groups. The student body presi
dent calls the decision on the
judicial council "sound, brilliant
and just."
He further attacks the entire
In loco parentis concept. Mas
sarenti believes that student
courts should only handle aca
demic cases and that all non

academic matters should be
handled by the state and local
authorities. He said that the
present system makes students
"first-class citizens outside the
university and second-class citi
zens within."
The case was originally sche
duled for March 7 but the hear
ing was postponed at the request
of Dean Smith. The judicial
council has refused to surrend
er tapes of the first hearing to
either Smith or the IJB. The
IJB has five members with the
chairman law professor Howard
Williams.
