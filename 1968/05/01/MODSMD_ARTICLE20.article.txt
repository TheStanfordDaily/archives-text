# Gap Left By CIA
## Senate Examines New Fund Source 
### 
WASHINGTON (CPS) â€” A
Senate subcommittee has begun
hearings on a proposed govern
ment foundation which would
provide money to private groups
for international programs for
merly funded by the Central
Intelligence Agency.
At the same time, a commit
tee appointed last winter by
President Johnson to propose
new ways of funding such proj
ects will make its report "in
the near future," according to
its executive director.
The foundation created by
the Senate bill would be fund
ed by Federal appropriations
and private gifts. It would be
governed by a director and 11-
member council selected from
persons "eminent in the fields
of education, student activi
ties, youth activities, labor,
health, scientific research"
and other fields to which the
foundation would give funds.
The bill, introduced by Sen.
Ralph Yarborough (D-Tex.),
who is also chairman of the sub
committee holding the hearings,
authorizes expenditures of up
to $100 million by 1972.
Yarborough introduced the
bill last winter after it was re
vealed that the CIA had been
covertly giving money to many
student and educational organi
zations. But no action was taken
on the bill at that time because
of the study committee appoint
ed by President Johnson and
chaired by Secretary of State
Dean Rusk.
However, in late December
there were reports that the
Rusk committee was unable to
agree on a solution, was meet
ing rarely, and was in no hurry

to make a report. At that point
Yarborough decided to begin
work on his bill and created a
special subcommittee to hold
hearings.
But James Clark, a Bureau of
the Budget official and executive
director of the President's com
mittee, told CPS that "as far
as I'm concerned, our report
will be coming out in the near
future."
Yarborough's bill closely re
sembles one of the four possi
bilities being considered by
the Rusk committee. The oth
ers are a similar foundation
but with only limited funds
and responsibilities, provid
ing the funds through the
State Department, and provid
ing funds through the Agency
for International Develop
ment.
One of Yarborough's staff
members, however, said the sub
committee is not interested in
the other three proposals. All
of the witnesses who testified
opposed getting the money from
the State Department or AID
or said those groups had limit
ed funds for such programs.
Yarborough said, "We're try
ing to cut out the bureaucracy
that people have to go through
in some of these other organiza
tions."
Most of the witnesses, all of
them from organizations like
ly to receive money from the
new foundation, praised the idea.
But several suggested that the
foundation's independence would
have to be maintained in order
for it to be useful to them.
The bill specifically prohibits
the government from requiring
grant recipients to engage in in

telligence work, as was done
when the CIA funded programs.
And the bill prohibits the Presi
dent and other executive agen
cies from controlling decisions
on grants made by the council.
However, the bill does require
the foundation's director to re
port to both the President and
Congress.
Richard Humphrey of the
American Council on Education
suggested the funds should
either be provided wholly with
in the government or by a com
pletely private foundation which
would get its money from the
government through contracts.
He said the second proposal was
probably closer to what was
needed.
The two representatives of
student organizations who ap
peared before the subcommittee
also said complete independence
would be essential.
National Student Associa
tion President Ed Schwartz,
warned the subcommittee that
the independence of the foun
dation will be "critical to win
ning student support" for it.
"There are many students to
day who feel that a student
group which accepts money
from the government loses
its independence," he added.
He said NSA would be very
careful about taking money
from the new foundation.
James Fowler, president of
the U.S. Youth Council (USYC)
urged that "qualified, relevant
young people" be placed on the
council that will govern the
foundation to make it "fresh,
alive, and innovative."
Only one member of the sub
committee was critical of th^

bill. Sen. Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.)
suggested that the government
could provide funds through
AID and private groups through
the large foundations. But most
of the witnesses said this was
not practical.
Joseph Beirne of the Com
munications Workers of Ameri
ca said AID has limited funds
and the foundations "have their
work cut out for them already."
Edwin Golin of the Inter-Amer
ican Partners of the Alliance
also said that neither AID nor
the foundations would fund
projects involving small amounts
of money, nor are they willing
to pay overhead costs of groups
with international programs.
Schwartz said NSA had cut
out its international programs
almost entirely becouse it could
not find funds for the kind of
programs he wants to do. He
said foundations were willing
to pay for the same kind of pro
grams the CIA paid forâ€”send
ing students to "conferences

that pass meaningless resolu
tions." He said NSA is interest
ed mainly in bringing foreign
students to the U.S. and cul
tural and student exchanges.
Fowler said USYC was un
able to jjet funds for most of
its programs from the private
foundations and the "logical
place" to get such funds Is
the government, through such
a foundation.
Despite Javit's criticism, Yar
borough's bill has a good chance
of passage. Sen. Wayne Morse
(D-Ore.), one of the most in
fluential members of the Labor
and Public Welfare Committee,
said he would do everything
possible to see that the bill is
approved by the full commit
tee.
The bill's major problem may
be getting funds after it is pass
ed. The International Education
Act, which provides many new
government programs in that
area, was passed two years agf>
but has never been funded.
