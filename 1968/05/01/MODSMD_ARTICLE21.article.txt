## Taylor Music Daring And Powerful 
### JERRY FOGEL 
Music in the hands of genius
can be a pure, unbridled ex
pression of thoughts and emo
tions. Too often it is not: con
ventions and accepted standards
inhibit even the finest artists.
The "daring" and the "experi
mental" are at once praised and
condemned by the "open-mind
ed" public.
But what is "daring* 'or "ex
perimental" about elevating an
art form to its highest degree
of perfection—that point at
which form seems to disappear
and the artist is communicating
directly with his listener?
Why should musicians whose
creativity and insipration en
ables them to shatter the bar
riers which have limited their

predecessors be relegated to the
realm of the "far-out" and "in
teresting" by those whose appre
ciation of art is characterized
in the familiar rationalization,
"I don't know anything about
, but I know what I like."
The Cecil Taylor Sextet,
which has been appearing at
Stanford since April 17, Is a
group of incredibly talented,
passionate jazz musicians. The
Sextet has a small, loyal fol
lowing, but the dissonant,
free-form improvisation which
marks its playing apparently
is too advanced for modern
ears.
Each of the six performers
is blessed with superb instru
mental skill. Cecil Taylor has
what Ralph Gleason has called
"a frightening command" of
the piano; his fingers move
with seemingly impossible rapi
dity. Drummer Andrew Cyrille
has both the fluid motion and
sense of rythmic anticipation
which make a great percussion
ist.
Sax players Jimmy Lyons
(alto) and Frank Wright tenor)
each have their own message,
but both have complete mastery
of their instrument. The string
bass in the hands of Alan Silva
becomes as expressive as a cello
or violin while providing, along
with the drums, the rhythmic
backbone of the group's music.
Eddie Gale Stevens' trumpet
seems almost mellow in con
trast to the sextet's dissonant
sound, but there can be no doubt
of Stevens' virtuosity.
The difference between the
music of the Cecil Taylor Sex
tet and formless, meaningless
musical experimentation is that
Taylor's group uses music in
the pure form to express itself
while most experimentation
tries to say something in spite
of music. Each of the musicians
in the sextet has devoted most
of his life to learning about his
art; through practice and per
formance each has grown and
continues to grow.
What comes out in perform
ance is an intense, consuming
experience. None of the six are

restrained—there is no catchy
theme or simple chord structure
to which they must return again
and again. The group begins
together; then one member be
gins a solo, then another.
During the solo even the
limitation of having to ac
company other musicians falls
away—for fifteen or twenty
minutes the soloist seems to
be alone with his instrument,
and the ecstacy, or anguish,
or torment that he is feeling
then come through the instru
ment and directly to the indi
vidual listener.
But very few are really listen
ing. After the first two or three
minutes most are telling them
selves that even though they
don't like the sound of this
group and would rather be lis
tening to ... . then they realize
that they can't think of another
jazz group they'd rather listen
to ... . they had best be "open
minded" and try to dig this
"avant-garde" music because
that's what "open-minded" peo
ple are supposed to do. Mean
while Frank Wright is dancing
with his sax, writhing to an
unearthly wail and the beat of
Andrew Cyrille's drums.
The total experience of listen
ing to the Cecil Taylor Sextet
is unforgettable. The screaming
horns, the throbbing percussion,
and Taylor's flowing inventions
rise and fall, building toward
climaxes and falling away just
before getting there. Each new
surge twists the nerves closer
and closer to the breaking point,
involving the listener as com

pletely as he will allow himself
to be involved. The dramatic,
wholly unbounded solos are ac
ccompanied by eerie chants and
cries—at times, if one closes his
eyes, a horrifying vision of Hell
seems to happen all around him.
The greatness, the importance
of this group is not restricted
to contemporary jazz. What
Taylor and his fellow musicians
have done is come closer to pure
creative expression than per
haps any other group in con
temporary music. The group's
collective message, though often
difficult to appreciate because
of its atonality, is powerful and
unmistakable.
It is the unfortunate pro
pensity of those imbued with
modern "culture" to react in
stinctively against what seems
to be the "unorganized disson
ance" of groups such as Tay
lor's. It is equally unfortunate
that the intensity and purity
of the Sextet's music is such
that this tendency must be
overcome if the music is to be
meaningful. Too few are will
ing or have the capability to
make the effort.
Cecil Taylor has been good
for Stanford. Many of those
who have heard him in the
small intimate audiences of the
past two weeks no doubt have
enjoyed the music and will re
member the group that created
it. But the greatest rewards
have come to those who have
recognized a voice speaking to
them through the stunning
work of six gifted artists, and
who have listened to it.

wholly unbounded solos are ac
ccompanied by eerie chants and
cries—at times, if one closes his
eyes, a horrifying vision of Hell
seems to happen all around him.
The greatness, the importance
of this group is not restricted
to contemporary jazz. What
Taylor and his fellow musicians
have done is come closer to pure
creative expression than per
haps any other group in con
temporary music. The group's
collective message, though often
difficult to appreciate because
of its atonality, is powerful and
unmistakable.
It is the unfortunate pro
pensity of those imbued with
modern "culture" to react in
stinctively against what seems
to be the "unorganized disson
ance" of groups such as Tay
lor's. It is equally unfortunate
that the intensity and purity
of the Sextet's music is such
that this tendency must be
overcome if the music is to be
meaningful. Too few are will
ing or have the capability to
make the effort.
Cecil Taylor has been good
for Stanford. Many of those
who have heard him in the
small intimate audiences of the
past two weeks no doubt have
enjoyed the music and will re
member the group that created
it. But the greatest rewards
have come to those who have
recognized a voice speaking to
them through the stunning
work of six gifted artists, and
who have listened to it.
Music in the hands of genius
can be a pure, unbridled ex
pression of thoughts and emo
tions. Too often it is not: con
ventions and accepted standards
inhibit even the finest artists.
The "daring" and the "experi
mental" are at once praised and
condemned by the "open-mind
ed" public.
But what is "daring* 'or "ex
perimental" about elevating an
art form to its highest degree
of perfection—that point at
which form seems to disappear
and the artist is communicating
directly with his listener?
Why should musicians whose
creativity and insipration en
ables them to shatter the bar
riers which have limited their

predecessors be relegated to the
realm of the "far-out" and "in
teresting" by those whose appre
ciation of art is characterized
in the familiar rationalization,
"I don't know anything about
, but I know what I like."
The Cecil Taylor Sextet,
which has been appearing at
Stanford since April 17, Is a
group of incredibly talented,
passionate jazz musicians. The
Sextet has a small, loyal fol
lowing, but the dissonant,
free-form improvisation which
marks its playing apparently
is too advanced for modern
ears.
Each of the six performers
is blessed with superb instru
mental skill. Cecil Taylor has
what Ralph Gleason has called
"a frightening command" of
the piano; his fingers move
with seemingly impossible rapi
dity. Drummer Andrew Cyrille
has both the fluid motion and
sense of rythmic anticipation
which make a great percussion
ist.
Sax players Jimmy Lyons
(alto) and Frank Wright tenor)
each have their own message,
but both have complete mastery
of their instrument. The string
bass in the hands of Alan Silva
becomes as expressive as a cello
or violin while providing, along
with the drums, the rhythmic
backbone of the group's music.
Eddie Gale Stevens' trumpet
seems almost mellow in con
trast to the sextet's dissonant
sound, but there can be no doubt
of Stevens' virtuosity.
The difference between the
music of the Cecil Taylor Sex
tet and formless, meaningless
musical experimentation is that
Taylor's group uses music in
the pure form to express itself
while most experimentation
tries to say something in spite
of music. Each of the musicians
in the sextet has devoted most
of his life to learning about his
art; through practice and per
formance each has grown and
continues to grow.
What comes out in perform
ance is an intense, consuming
experience. None of the six are

restrained—there is no catchy
theme or simple chord structure
to which they must return again
and again. The group begins
together; then one member be
gins a solo, then another.
During the solo even the
limitation of having to ac
company other musicians falls
away—for fifteen or twenty
minutes the soloist seems to
be alone with his instrument,
and the ecstacy, or anguish,
or torment that he is feeling
then come through the instru
ment and directly to the indi
vidual listener.
But very few are really listen
ing. After the first two or three
minutes most are telling them
selves that even though they
don't like the sound of this
group and would rather be lis
tening to ... . then they realize
that they can't think of another
jazz group they'd rather listen
to ... . they had best be "open
minded" and try to dig this
"avant-garde" music because
that's what "open-minded" peo
ple are supposed to do. Mean
while Frank Wright is dancing
with his sax, writhing to an
unearthly wail and the beat of
Andrew Cyrille's drums.
The total experience of listen
ing to the Cecil Taylor Sextet
is unforgettable. The screaming
horns, the throbbing percussion,
and Taylor's flowing inventions
rise and fall, building toward
climaxes and falling away just
before getting there. Each new
surge twists the nerves closer
and closer to the breaking point,
involving the listener as com

pletely as he will allow himself
to be involved. The dramatic,
wholly unbounded solos are ac
ccompanied by eerie chants and
cries—at times, if one closes his
eyes, a horrifying vision of Hell

together; then one member be
gins a solo, then another.
During the solo even the
limitation of having to ac
company other musicians falls
away—for fifteen or twenty
minutes the soloist seems to
be alone with his instrument,
and the ecstacy, or anguish,
or torment that he is feeling
then come through the instru
ment and directly to the indi
vidual listener.
But very few are really listen
ing. After the first two or three
minutes most are telling them
selves that even though they
don't like the sound of this
group and would rather be lis
tening to ... . then they realize
that they can't think of another
jazz group they'd rather listen
to ... . they had best be "open
minded" and try to dig this
"avant-garde" music because
that's what "open-minded" peo
ple are supposed to do. Mean
while Frank Wright is dancing
with his sax, writhing to an
unearthly wail and the beat of
Andrew Cyrille's drums.
The total experience of listen
ing to the Cecil Taylor Sextet
is unforgettable. The screaming
horns, the throbbing percussion,
and Taylor's flowing inventions
rise and fall, building toward
climaxes and falling away just
before getting there. Each new
surge twists the nerves closer
and closer to the breaking point,
involving the listener as com

pletely as he will allow himself
to be involved. The dramatic,
wholly unbounded solos are ac
ccompanied by eerie chants and
cries—at times, if one closes his
eyes, a horrifying vision of Hell
seems to happen all around him.
The greatness, the importance
of this group is not restricted
to contemporary jazz. What
Taylor and his fellow musicians
have done is come closer to pure
creative expression than per
haps any other group in con
temporary music. The group's
collective message, though often
difficult to appreciate because
of its atonality, is powerful and
unmistakable.
It is the unfortunate pro
pensity of those imbued with
modern "culture" to react in
stinctively against what seems
to be the "unorganized disson
ance" of groups such as Tay
lor's. It is equally unfortunate
that the intensity and purity
of the Sextet's music is such
that this tendency must be
overcome if the music is to be
meaningful. Too few are will
ing or have the capability to
make the effort.
Cecil Taylor has been good
for Stanford. Many of those
who have heard him in the
small intimate audiences of the
past two weeks no doubt have
enjoyed the music and will re
member the group that created
it. But the greatest rewards
have come to those who have
recognized a voice speaking to
them through the stunning
work of six gifted artists, and
who have listened to it.
Music in the hands of genius
can be a pure, unbridled ex
pression of thoughts and emo
tions. Too often it is not: con
ventions and accepted standards
inhibit even the finest artists.
The "daring" and the "experi
mental" are at once praised and
condemned by the "open-mind
ed" public.
But what is "daring* 'or "ex
perimental" about elevating an
art form to its highest degree
of perfection—that point at
which form seems to disappear
and the artist is communicating
directly with his listener?
Why should musicians whose
creativity and insipration en
ables them to shatter the bar
riers which have limited their

predecessors be relegated to the
realm of the "far-out" and "in
teresting" by those whose appre
ciation of art is characterized
in the familiar rationalization,
"I don't know anything about
, but I know what I like."
The Cecil Taylor Sextet,
which has been appearing at
Stanford since April 17, Is a
group of incredibly talented,
passionate jazz musicians. The
Sextet has a small, loyal fol
lowing, but the dissonant,
free-form improvisation which
marks its playing apparently
is too advanced for modern
ears.
Each of the six performers
is blessed with superb instru
mental skill. Cecil Taylor has
what Ralph Gleason has called
"a frightening command" of
the piano; his fingers move
with seemingly impossible rapi
dity. Drummer Andrew Cyrille
has both the fluid motion and
sense of rythmic anticipation
which make a great percussion
ist.
Sax players Jimmy Lyons
(alto) and Frank Wright tenor)
each have their own message,
but both have complete mastery
of their instrument. The string
bass in the hands of Alan Silva
becomes as expressive as a cello
or violin while providing, along
with the drums, the rhythmic
backbone of the group's music.
Eddie Gale Stevens' trumpet
seems almost mellow in con
trast to the sextet's dissonant
sound, but there can be no doubt
of Stevens' virtuosity.
The difference between the
music of the Cecil Taylor Sex
tet and formless, meaningless
musical experimentation is that
Taylor's group uses music in
the pure form to express itself
while most experimentation
tries to say something in spite
of music. Each of the musicians
in the sextet has devoted most
of his life to learning about his
art; through practice and per
formance each has grown and
continues to grow.
What comes out in perform
ance is an intense, consuming
experience. None of the six are

restrained—there is no catchy
theme or simple chord structure
to which they must return again
and again. The group begins
together; then one member be
gins a solo, then another.
During the solo even the
limitation of having to ac
company other musicians falls
