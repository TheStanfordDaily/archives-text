# Post-Doctoral Students Aid Research
## 
### SUE CRIBARI Second of Three Parts 
There are many postdoctoral
students at Stanford, most of
them in the field of science.
One such student is Carroll
Norris. He did both his under
graduate and graduate work in
electrical engineering at Stan
ford, and received his Ph.D. in
January of 1967 While working
toward his doctorate, he became
interested in studying an ampli
fication principle first discovered
in 1950.
A conceivable application of
the principle would be the de
velopment of a wide-band ampli
fier, such as that used in an
oscilloscope, which would be
capable of amplifying signals
from zero frequency up to hun
dreds, or conceivably thousands,
of megacycles, with constant
gain. This device, called the
Electron Beam —PN Junction
Amplifier, is just one of many
possible applications of the
principle. Norris called it "quite
an attractive application be
cause what you can do with
transistors here is quite lim
ited." The best transistor oscillo
scope is in the 100 megacycle
category.
"The work I did for my de
gree uncovered only a small
fraction of the potential In
this area," Norris said. His
decision to do postdoctoral
study was made when he
could not find an industry in
terested in finishing- the work
he had started. He explained
that industry too often wants
a specific product to come of
research. He found a com
pany willing to finance his de
velopment of the oscilloscope,
for example, but that Is where
its Interest ceased.
This was unsatisfactory to
Norris because he is "interested
in basic phenomena, not neces
sarily in specific applications."
He explained that the object of
his current postdoctoral pro
gram is "not to build the device,
but to obtain an understanding
of how the device works and an
understanding of how to opti
mize the device for a general

class of applications."
Norris is doing "contract re
search," financed by U.S. Army
and Navy funds, in conjunction
with Professor James F. Gib
bons. The military will grant
contracts only if they have a
direct interest in a research pro
ject. "Since the Electron Beam —
PN Junction Amplifier is an im
provement over existing devices,
this interests the military for
application to their systems,"
Norris said.
In return for the funds, Nor
ris is expected to write short
research reports periodically,
and a more substantial docu
ment about once a year.
He has contract commitments
for another 18 months. After
that, his plans are indefinite, but
he will keep doing research as
long as he can find interesting
work to do and the funds to
make it possible. Though he
could make more money in in
dustry, he will only go into in
dustry "if it becomes necessary
or desirable to do research
work." Working for industry,
he would have to sacrifice being
able to work on what interests
him.
Norris, as a postdoctoral
student, does not consider
himself part of the Stanford
student body as such. But he
does feel that he and all post
doctoral students should have
a definite role in the univers
ity —namely upgrading the
level of research done In the
various departments and pro
viding motivation and exam
ple for pre-doctoral students.
Sharing his view is William
S. Johnson, Executive Head of
the Department of Chemistry.
He calls the postdoctoral and
visiting scholar program "an ex
ceedingly important part of our
graduate program." The inter
change of ideas among scholars,
postdoctoral and pre-doctoral
students "raises the whole level
of our teaching operation," he
said.
The Department of Chem
istry's method is "to mix up
postdoctoral and pre-doctoral
students in the same labora
tory." Less experienced pre-docs
can learn a great deal about re
search methods this way be
cause these people "bring new
techniques and pass them on to
our students."
According to Johnson,
chemistry post-docs usually
decide in the last year of work
on their Ph.D. that they want
to spend an additional year
of study, often in a field com
pletely unrelated to their doc
toral work, so that they can
broaden their perspectives in
the field.
Those who do postdoctoral
work are "in a better position
to get a job" teaching at the
university level. Johnson, who
arrived at Stanford in 1960, said

that in the last seven years,,
every assistant professor who
has been hired in his depart
ment (about 12) has had at
least a year of postdoctoral
work. "There are a lot of good
candidates around," he said,
"and everything else being
equal, you take the man who
has had the most experience."
To apply for postdoctoral
work, a student writes a letter
of inquiry directly to the pro
fessor he is interested in work
ing under. A vague letter, sent
to the department instead of to
a professor, will not usually be
given consideration. Each pro
fessor does his own screening
and selecting of post-docs from
the letters he receives.
Johnson said he accepts only
eight to ten post-docs per year,
out of 40 to 50 applications. Ap
plicants who have won their
own fellowships, he said, "are
usually very good and are al
most always accepted."
But in certain cases, a pro
fessor may choose to accept a
highly-qualified man without
a fellowship to whom he pays
a stipend from federal grants
made available to him. These
post-docs are termed "re
search associates."
Dr. Koenrad Wiedhaup be
came a research associate under
Dr. Johnson in March of 1967.
He received his Ph.D. in organic
chemistry from the University
of Amsterdam in January of
1966, and a week later traveled
to the United States, on a Full
bright travel grant. His first
postdoctoral assignment was at
the University of California
Medical Center in San Fran
cisco. He studied there until
February of the following year,
and then came to Stanford.
He had become acquainted
with Dr. Johnson's work in
steroid chemistry while in Hol

land. The study of steroids has
tremendous biological import
because many of the hormones
in the human body consist of
steroidal molecules. Wiedhaup's
own doctoral dissertation was
"The Total Synthesis of Several
Anthrasteroids and Aza-Anthra
steroids."
When Johnson came to Stan
ford in 1960 from the University
of Wisconsin, he initiated a new
project concerning "Nonenzym
ic Biogenetic-like Olefinic Cycli
zations." This explores a recent
ly-developed approach toward
the synthesis, without enzymes,
of steroid like molecules. Wied
haup became interested in the
project and wrote Johnson a let
ter asking if he could work un
der him as a research associate.
His application was accepted
and in March, 1967, he joined
the laboratory staff.
After three months at Stan
ford, he was appointed head or
senior post-doc. This position
has broadened his range of ac
tivities. He has the opportunity
to meet and talk with more peo
ple; he inspects and cares for
new scientific equipment; and
he does some administrative
work. Along with the 9 other
post-docs in organic chemistry,
he is auditing some chemistry
courses, "just for my pleasure,
not to obtain any further de
grees," and he participates in
weekly seminars with Johnson,
the post-docs and the ten pre

docs in his department. Each
week, one of the participants in
the seminar presents a report
of his current work.
Wiedhaup has made a ma
jor contribution to Johnson's
project in the year he has
been at Stanford. He has pre
pared a tetraenic molecule
and achieved its stereo-selec
tive cyclizatlon to a tetracyclic
substance, the first time tliat
such a tetracyclic molecule
has been fully cyclized with
out the help of enzymes.
That no one seems to know
quite what to do with postdoc
toral students is illustrated by
the fact that Wiedhaup was not
able to vote in the recent na
tionwide campus "election,"
Choice '68. He did not have a
Stanford student body card.
Since his visa and his stay at
Stanford will both terminate in
July of this year, "The question
I'm asking myself." Wiedhaup
remarked, is whether to remain
in the United States or go back
to Europe. He will probably not
do any additional postdoctoral
work after July. "I will have
done postdoctoral work for two
and a half years altogether," he
said. "I think that's sufficient
for broadening my experience."
Living either here or abroad, he
will probably do further chemi
cal work in a pharmaceutical
industry.

work are "in a better position
to get a job" teaching at the
university level. Johnson, who
arrived at Stanford in 1960, said

that in the last seven years,,
every assistant professor who
has been hired in his depart
ment (about 12) has had at
least a year of postdoctoral
work. "There are a lot of good
candidates around," he said,
"and everything else being
equal, you take the man who
has had the most experience."
To apply for postdoctoral
work, a student writes a letter
of inquiry directly to the pro
fessor he is interested in work
ing under. A vague letter, sent
to the department instead of to
a professor, will not usually be
given consideration. Each pro
fessor does his own screening
and selecting of post-docs from
the letters he receives.
Johnson said he accepts only
eight to ten post-docs per year,
out of 40 to 50 applications. Ap
plicants who have won their
own fellowships, he said, "are
usually very good and are al
most always accepted."
But in certain cases, a pro
fessor may choose to accept a
highly-qualified man without
a fellowship to whom he pays
a stipend from federal grants
made available to him. These
post-docs are termed "re
search associates."
Dr. Koenrad Wiedhaup be
came a research associate under
Dr. Johnson in March of 1967.
He received his Ph.D. in organic
chemistry from the University
of Amsterdam in January of
1966, and a week later traveled
to the United States, on a Full
bright travel grant. His first
postdoctoral assignment was at
the University of California
Medical Center in San Fran
cisco. He studied there until
February of the following year,
and then came to Stanford.
He had become acquainted
with Dr. Johnson's work in
steroid chemistry while in Hol

land. The study of steroids has
tremendous biological import
because many of the hormones
in the human body consist of
steroidal molecules. Wiedhaup's
own doctoral dissertation was
"The Total Synthesis of Several
Anthrasteroids and Aza-Anthra
steroids."
When Johnson came to Stan
ford in 1960 from the University
of Wisconsin, he initiated a new
project concerning "Nonenzym
ic Biogenetic-like Olefinic Cycli
zations." This explores a recent
ly-developed approach toward
the synthesis, without enzymes,
of steroid like molecules. Wied
haup became interested in the
project and wrote Johnson a let
ter asking if he could work un
der him as a research associate.
His application was accepted
and in March, 1967, he joined
the laboratory staff.
After three months at Stan
ford, he was appointed head or
senior post-doc. This position
has broadened his range of ac
tivities. He has the opportunity
to meet and talk with more peo
ple; he inspects and cares for
new scientific equipment; and
he does some administrative
work. Along with the 9 other
post-docs in organic chemistry,
he is auditing some chemistry
courses, "just for my pleasure,
not to obtain any further de
grees," and he participates in
weekly seminars with Johnson,
the post-docs and the ten pre

docs in his department. Each
week, one of the participants in
the seminar presents a report
of his current work.
Wiedhaup has made a ma
jor contribution to Johnson's
project in the year he has
been at Stanford. He has pre
pared a tetraenic molecule
and achieved its stereo-selec
tive cyclizatlon to a tetracyclic
substance, the first time tliat
such a tetracyclic molecule
has been fully cyclized with
out the help of enzymes.
That no one seems to know
quite what to do with postdoc
toral students is illustrated by
the fact that Wiedhaup was not
able to vote in the recent na
tionwide campus "election,"
Choice '68. He did not have a
Stanford student body card.
Since his visa and his stay at
Stanford will both terminate in
July of this year, "The question
I'm asking myself." Wiedhaup
remarked, is whether to remain
in the United States or go back
to Europe. He will probably not
do any additional postdoctoral
work after July. "I will have
done postdoctoral work for two
and a half years altogether," he
said. "I think that's sufficient
for broadening my experience."
Living either here or abroad, he
will probably do further chemi
cal work in a pharmaceutical
industry.

CONTRAC T RESEARCH —Car-
roll Norris, post doctoral
student in electrical engineering
is developing a wideband ampli
fier. His work is financed by
the U.S. Army and Navy to
whom Norris Is expected to re
port his findings.
There are many postdoctoral
students at Stanford, most of
them in the field of science.
One such student is Carroll
Norris. He did both his under
graduate and graduate work in
electrical engineering at Stan
ford, and received his Ph.D. in
January of 1967 While working
toward his doctorate, he became
interested in studying an ampli
fication principle first discovered
in 1950.
A conceivable application of
the principle would be the de
velopment of a wide-band ampli
fier, such as that used in an
oscilloscope, which would be
capable of amplifying signals
from zero frequency up to hun
dreds, or conceivably thousands,
of megacycles, with constant
gain. This device, called the
Electron Beam —PN Junction
Amplifier, is just one of many
possible applications of the
principle. Norris called it "quite
an attractive application be
cause what you can do with
transistors here is quite lim
ited." The best transistor oscillo
scope is in the 100 megacycle
category.
"The work I did for my de
gree uncovered only a small
fraction of the potential In
this area," Norris said. His
decision to do postdoctoral
study was made when he
could not find an industry in
terested in finishing- the work
he had started. He explained
that industry too often wants
a specific product to come of
research. He found a com
pany willing to finance his de
velopment of the oscilloscope,
for example, but that Is where
its Interest ceased.
This was unsatisfactory to
Norris because he is "interested
in basic phenomena, not neces
sarily in specific applications."
He explained that the object of
his current postdoctoral pro
gram is "not to build the device,
but to obtain an understanding
of how the device works and an
understanding of how to opti
mize the device for a general

class of applications."
Norris is doing "contract re
search," financed by U.S. Army
and Navy funds, in conjunction
with Professor James F. Gib
bons. The military will grant
contracts only if they have a
direct interest in a research pro
ject. "Since the Electron Beam —
PN Junction Amplifier is an im
provement over existing devices,
this interests the military for
application to their systems,"
Norris said.
In return for the funds, Nor
ris is expected to write short
research reports periodically,
and a more substantial docu
ment about once a year.
He has contract commitments
for another 18 months. After
that, his plans are indefinite, but
he will keep doing research as
long as he can find interesting
work to do and the funds to
make it possible. Though he
could make more money in in
dustry, he will only go into in
dustry "if it becomes necessary
or desirable to do research
work." Working for industry,
he would have to sacrifice being
able to work on what interests
him.
Norris, as a postdoctoral
student, does not consider
himself part of the Stanford
student body as such. But he
does feel that he and all post
doctoral students should have
a definite role in the univers
ity —namely upgrading the
level of research done In the
various departments and pro
viding motivation and exam
ple for pre-doctoral students.
Sharing his view is William
S. Johnson, Executive Head of
the Department of Chemistry.
He calls the postdoctoral and
visiting scholar program "an ex
ceedingly important part of our
graduate program." The inter
change of ideas among scholars,
postdoctoral and pre-doctoral
students "raises the whole level
of our teaching operation," he
said.
The Department of Chem
istry's method is "to mix up
postdoctoral and pre-doctoral
students in the same labora
tory." Less experienced pre-docs
can learn a great deal about re
search methods this way be
cause these people "bring new
techniques and pass them on to
our students."
According to Johnson,
chemistry post-docs usually
decide in the last year of work
on their Ph.D. that they want
to spend an additional year
of study, often in a field com
pletely unrelated to their doc
toral work, so that they can
broaden their perspectives in
the field.
Those who do postdoctoral
work are "in a better position
to get a job" teaching at the
university level. Johnson, who
arrived at Stanford in 1960, said

that in the last seven years,,
every assistant professor who

CONTRAC T RESEARCH —Car-
roll Norris, post doctoral
student in electrical engineering
is developing a wideband ampli
fier. His work is financed by
the U.S. Army and Navy to
whom Norris Is expected to re
port his findings.
There are many postdoctoral
students at Stanford, most of
them in the field of science.
One such student is Carroll
Norris. He did both his under
graduate and graduate work in
electrical engineering at Stan
ford, and received his Ph.D. in
January of 1967 While working
toward his doctorate, he became
interested in studying an ampli
fication principle first discovered
in 1950.
A conceivable application of
the principle would be the de
velopment of a wide-band ampli
fier, such as that used in an
oscilloscope, which would be
capable of amplifying signals
from zero frequency up to hun
dreds, or conceivably thousands,
of megacycles, with constant
gain. This device, called the
Electron Beam —PN Junction
Amplifier, is just one of many
possible applications of the
principle. Norris called it "quite
an attractive application be
cause what you can do with
transistors here is quite lim
ited." The best transistor oscillo
scope is in the 100 megacycle
category.
"The work I did for my de
gree uncovered only a small
fraction of the potential In
this area," Norris said. His
decision to do postdoctoral
study was made when he
could not find an industry in
terested in finishing- the work
he had started. He explained
that industry too often wants
a specific product to come of
research. He found a com
pany willing to finance his de
velopment of the oscilloscope,
for example, but that Is where
its Interest ceased.
This was unsatisfactory to
Norris because he is "interested
in basic phenomena, not neces
sarily in specific applications."
He explained that the object of
his current postdoctoral pro
gram is "not to build the device,
but to obtain an understanding
of how the device works and an
understanding of how to opti
mize the device for a general

class of applications."
Norris is doing "contract re
search," financed by U.S. Army
and Navy funds, in conjunction
with Professor James F. Gib
bons. The military will grant
contracts only if they have a
direct interest in a research pro
ject. "Since the Electron Beam —
PN Junction Amplifier is an im
provement over existing devices,
this interests the military for
application to their systems,"
Norris said.
In return for the funds, Nor
ris is expected to write short
research reports periodically,
and a more substantial docu
ment about once a year.
He has contract commitments
for another 18 months. After
that, his plans are indefinite, but
he will keep doing research as
long as he can find interesting
work to do and the funds to
make it possible. Though he
could make more money in in
dustry, he will only go into in
dustry "if it becomes necessary
or desirable to do research
work." Working for industry,
he would have to sacrifice being
able to work on what interests
him.
Norris, as a postdoctoral
student, does not consider
himself part of the Stanford
student body as such. But he
does feel that he and all post
doctoral students should have
a definite role in the univers
ity —namely upgrading the
level of research done In the
various departments and pro
viding motivation and exam
ple for pre-doctoral students.
Sharing his view is William
S. Johnson, Executive Head of
the Department of Chemistry.
He calls the postdoctoral and
visiting scholar program "an ex
ceedingly important part of our
graduate program." The inter
change of ideas among scholars,
postdoctoral and pre-doctoral
students "raises the whole level
of our teaching operation," he
said.
The Department of Chem
istry's method is "to mix up
postdoctoral and pre-doctoral
students in the same labora
tory." Less experienced pre-docs
can learn a great deal about re
search methods this way be
cause these people "bring new
techniques and pass them on to
our students."
According to Johnson,
chemistry post-docs usually
decide in the last year of work
on their Ph.D. that they want
to spend an additional year
of study, often in a field com
pletely unrelated to their doc
toral work, so that they can
broaden their perspectives in
the field.
Those who do postdoctoral
work are "in a better position
to get a job" teaching at the
university level. Johnson, who
arrived at Stanford in 1960, said

that in the last seven years,,
every assistant professor who
has been hired in his depart
ment (about 12) has had at
least a year of postdoctoral
work. "There are a lot of good
candidates around," he said,
"and everything else being
equal, you take the man who
has had the most experience."
To apply for postdoctoral
work, a student writes a letter
of inquiry directly to the pro
fessor he is interested in work
ing under. A vague letter, sent
to the department instead of to
a professor, will not usually be
given consideration. Each pro
fessor does his own screening
and selecting of post-docs from
the letters he receives.
Johnson said he accepts only
eight to ten post-docs per year,
out of 40 to 50 applications. Ap
plicants who have won their
own fellowships, he said, "are
usually very good and are al
most always accepted."
But in certain cases, a pro
fessor may choose to accept a
highly-qualified man without
a fellowship to whom he pays
a stipend from federal grants
made available to him. These
post-docs are termed "re
search associates."
Dr. Koenrad Wiedhaup be
came a research associate under
Dr. Johnson in March of 1967.
He received his Ph.D. in organic
chemistry from the University
of Amsterdam in January of
1966, and a week later traveled
to the United States, on a Full
bright travel grant. His first
postdoctoral assignment was at
the University of California
Medical Center in San Fran
cisco. He studied there until
February of the following year,
and then came to Stanford.
He had become acquainted
with Dr. Johnson's work in
steroid chemistry while in Hol

land. The study of steroids has
tremendous biological import
because many of the hormones
in the human body consist of
steroidal molecules. Wiedhaup's
own doctoral dissertation was
"The Total Synthesis of Several
Anthrasteroids and Aza-Anthra
steroids."
When Johnson came to Stan
ford in 1960 from the University
of Wisconsin, he initiated a new
project concerning "Nonenzym
ic Biogenetic-like Olefinic Cycli
zations." This explores a recent
ly-developed approach toward
the synthesis, without enzymes,
of steroid like molecules. Wied
haup became interested in the
project and wrote Johnson a let
ter asking if he could work un
der him as a research associate.
His application was accepted
and in March, 1967, he joined
the laboratory staff.
After three months at Stan
ford, he was appointed head or
senior post-doc. This position
has broadened his range of ac
tivities. He has the opportunity
to meet and talk with more peo
ple; he inspects and cares for
new scientific equipment; and
he does some administrative
work. Along with the 9 other
post-docs in organic chemistry,
he is auditing some chemistry
courses, "just for my pleasure,
not to obtain any further de
grees," and he participates in
weekly seminars with Johnson,
the post-docs and the ten pre

docs in his department. Each
week, one of the participants in
the seminar presents a report
of his current work.
Wiedhaup has made a ma
jor contribution to Johnson's
project in the year he has
been at Stanford. He has pre
pared a tetraenic molecule
and achieved its stereo-selec
tive cyclizatlon to a tetracyclic
substance, the first time tliat
such a tetracyclic molecule
has been fully cyclized with
out the help of enzymes.
That no one seems to know
quite what to do with postdoc
toral students is illustrated by
the fact that Wiedhaup was not
able to vote in the recent na
tionwide campus "election,"
Choice '68. He did not have a
Stanford student body card.
Since his visa and his stay at
Stanford will both terminate in
July of this year, "The question
I'm asking myself." Wiedhaup
remarked, is whether to remain
in the United States or go back
to Europe. He will probably not
do any additional postdoctoral
work after July. "I will have
done postdoctoral work for two
and a half years altogether," he
said. "I think that's sufficient
for broadening my experience."
Living either here or abroad, he
will probably do further chemi
cal work in a pharmaceutical
industry.

students in the same labora
tory." Less experienced pre-docs
can learn a great deal about re
search methods this way be
cause these people "bring new
techniques and pass them on to
our students."
According to Johnson,
chemistry post-docs usually
decide in the last year of work
on their Ph.D. that they want
to spend an additional year
of study, often in a field com
pletely unrelated to their doc
toral work, so that they can
broaden their perspectives in
the field.
Those who do postdoctoral
work are "in a better position
to get a job" teaching at the
university level. Johnson, who
arrived at Stanford in 1960, said

that in the last seven years,,
every assistant professor who
has been hired in his depart
ment (about 12) has had at
least a year of postdoctoral
work. "There are a lot of good
candidates around," he said,
"and everything else being
equal, you take the man who
has had the most experience."
To apply for postdoctoral
work, a student writes a letter
of inquiry directly to the pro
fessor he is interested in work
ing under. A vague letter, sent
to the department instead of to
a professor, will not usually be
given consideration. Each pro
fessor does his own screening
and selecting of post-docs from
the letters he receives.
Johnson said he accepts only
eight to ten post-docs per year,
out of 40 to 50 applications. Ap
plicants who have won their
own fellowships, he said, "are
usually very good and are al
most always accepted."
But in certain cases, a pro
fessor may choose to accept a
highly-qualified man without
a fellowship to whom he pays
a stipend from federal grants
made available to him. These
post-docs are termed "re
search associates."
Dr. Koenrad Wiedhaup be
came a research associate under
Dr. Johnson in March of 1967.
He received his Ph.D. in organic
chemistry from the University
of Amsterdam in January of
1966, and a week later traveled
to the United States, on a Full
bright travel grant. His first
postdoctoral assignment was at
the University of California
Medical Center in San Fran
cisco. He studied there until
February of the following year,
and then came to Stanford.
He had become acquainted
with Dr. Johnson's work in
steroid chemistry while in Hol

land. The study of steroids has
tremendous biological import
because many of the hormones
in the human body consist of
steroidal molecules. Wiedhaup's
own doctoral dissertation was
"The Total Synthesis of Several
Anthrasteroids and Aza-Anthra
steroids."
When Johnson came to Stan
ford in 1960 from the University
of Wisconsin, he initiated a new
project concerning "Nonenzym
ic Biogenetic-like Olefinic Cycli
zations." This explores a recent
ly-developed approach toward
the synthesis, without enzymes,
of steroid like molecules. Wied
haup became interested in the
project and wrote Johnson a let
ter asking if he could work un
der him as a research associate.
His application was accepted
and in March, 1967, he joined
the laboratory staff.
After three months at Stan
ford, he was appointed head or
senior post-doc. This position
has broadened his range of ac
tivities. He has the opportunity
to meet and talk with more peo
ple; he inspects and cares for
new scientific equipment; and
he does some administrative
work. Along with the 9 other
post-docs in organic chemistry,
he is auditing some chemistry
courses, "just for my pleasure,
not to obtain any further de
grees," and he participates in
weekly seminars with Johnson,
the post-docs and the ten pre

docs in his department. Each
week, one of the participants in
the seminar presents a report
of his current work.
Wiedhaup has made a ma
jor contribution to Johnson's
project in the year he has
been at Stanford. He has pre
pared a tetraenic molecule
and achieved its stereo-selec
tive cyclizatlon to a tetracyclic
substance, the first time tliat
such a tetracyclic molecule
has been fully cyclized with
out the help of enzymes.
That no one seems to know
quite what to do with postdoc
toral students is illustrated by
the fact that Wiedhaup was not
able to vote in the recent na
tionwide campus "election,"
Choice '68. He did not have a
Stanford student body card.
Since his visa and his stay at
Stanford will both terminate in
July of this year, "The question
I'm asking myself." Wiedhaup
remarked, is whether to remain
in the United States or go back
to Europe. He will probably not
do any additional postdoctoral
work after July. "I will have
done postdoctoral work for two
and a half years altogether," he
said. "I think that's sufficient
for broadening my experience."
Living either here or abroad, he
will probably do further chemi
cal work in a pharmaceutical
industry.

CONTRAC T RESEARCH —Car-
roll Norris, post doctoral
student in electrical engineering
is developing a wideband ampli
fier. His work is financed by
the U.S. Army and Navy to
whom Norris Is expected to re
port his findings.
There are many postdoctoral
students at Stanford, most of
them in the field of science.
One such student is Carroll
Norris. He did both his under
graduate and graduate work in
electrical engineering at Stan
ford, and received his Ph.D. in
January of 1967 While working
toward his doctorate, he became
interested in studying an ampli
fication principle first discovered
in 1950.
A conceivable application of
the principle would be the de
velopment of a wide-band ampli
fier, such as that used in an
oscilloscope, which would be
capable of amplifying signals
from zero frequency up to hun
dreds, or conceivably thousands,
of megacycles, with constant
gain. This device, called the
Electron Beam —PN Junction
Amplifier, is just one of many
possible applications of the
principle. Norris called it "quite
an attractive application be
cause what you can do with
transistors here is quite lim
ited." The best transistor oscillo
scope is in the 100 megacycle
category.
"The work I did for my de
gree uncovered only a small
fraction of the potential In
this area," Norris said. His
decision to do postdoctoral
study was made when he
could not find an industry in
terested in finishing- the work
he had started. He explained
that industry too often wants
a specific product to come of
research. He found a com
pany willing to finance his de
velopment of the oscilloscope,
for example, but that Is where
its Interest ceased.
This was unsatisfactory to
Norris because he is "interested
in basic phenomena, not neces
sarily in specific applications."
He explained that the object of
his current postdoctoral pro
gram is "not to build the device,
but to obtain an understanding
of how the device works and an
understanding of how to opti
mize the device for a general

class of applications."
Norris is doing "contract re
search," financed by U.S. Army
and Navy funds, in conjunction
with Professor James F. Gib
bons. The military will grant
contracts only if they have a
direct interest in a research pro
ject. "Since the Electron Beam —
PN Junction Amplifier is an im
provement over existing devices,
this interests the military for
application to their systems,"
Norris said.
In return for the funds, Nor
ris is expected to write short
research reports periodically,
and a more substantial docu
ment about once a year.
He has contract commitments
for another 18 months. After
that, his plans are indefinite, but
he will keep doing research as
long as he can find interesting
work to do and the funds to
make it possible. Though he
could make more money in in
dustry, he will only go into in
dustry "if it becomes necessary
or desirable to do research
work." Working for industry,
he would have to sacrifice being
able to work on what interests
him.
Norris, as a postdoctoral
student, does not consider
himself part of the Stanford
student body as such. But he
does feel that he and all post
doctoral students should have
a definite role in the univers
ity —namely upgrading the
level of research done In the
various departments and pro
viding motivation and exam
ple for pre-doctoral students.
Sharing his view is William
S. Johnson, Executive Head of
the Department of Chemistry.
He calls the postdoctoral and
visiting scholar program "an ex
ceedingly important part of our
graduate program." The inter
change of ideas among scholars,
postdoctoral and pre-doctoral
students "raises the whole level
of our teaching operation," he
said.
The Department of Chem
istry's method is "to mix up
postdoctoral and pre-doctoral
students in the same labora
tory." Less experienced pre-docs
can learn a great deal about re
search methods this way be

out the help of enzymes.
That no one seems to know
quite what to do with postdoc
toral students is illustrated by
the fact that Wiedhaup was not
able to vote in the recent na
tionwide campus "election,"
Choice '68. He did not have a
Stanford student body card.
Since his visa and his stay at
Stanford will both terminate in
July of this year, "The question
I'm asking myself." Wiedhaup
remarked, is whether to remain
in the United States or go back
to Europe. He will probably not
do any additional postdoctoral
work after July. "I will have
done postdoctoral work for two
and a half years altogether," he
said. "I think that's sufficient
for broadening my experience."
Living either here or abroad, he
will probably do further chemi
cal work in a pharmaceutical
industry.
