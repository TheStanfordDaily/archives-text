## Of Pitchers And Pennants 
### Gary Cavalli 
The present edition of the San Francisco Gaints is the only major
league team possessing four pitchers who have won 20 games in
a season at one time or another during their careers. This has,
of course, led to speculation as to whether all four Giant hurlers
(Juan Marichal, Ray Sadeki, Mike McCormick, Gaylord Perry),
can either repeat or nearly match their 20-game seasons of yester
year, and thus lead the SF nine to the National League pennant.
The current issue of Sporting News points out that the last
time a ballclub had four 20-game winners was back in 1900, when
the Chicago White Sox did it. In that historic season, Urban Faber
won 23 games, Claude Williams won 22, and Eddie Cicotte and
Dickie Werr each nabbed 21 victories. This is the only time on
record when a team has accomplished the feat, so the odds against
the Giant hurlers doing it are stacked pretty high.
Sporting News also reveals that 18 teams have had three 20-
game winners in major league history, the latest being the 1956
Cleveland Indians, when Herb Score, Early Wynn and Bob Lemon
each pocketed 20 triumphs.
The bad thing about such statistics is that they tend to detract
from the main issue — will two, three, or four 20-game winners
necessarily bring a ballclub a pennant? Using only the most cur
rent years as examples, the answer is no.
The last three teams that have had two 20-game winners were
the 1965 Cincinnati Reds (Jim Maloney and Sammy Ellis), the 1965
LA Dodgers (Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale) and the 1966 SF
Giants (Juan Marichal and Gaylord Perry). Of this trio, only the
'65 Dodgers won the pennant. And back in 1956, when the Indians
had those three 20-game winners, they didn't even win the AL flag.
These examples tend to point up the fact that pitching is not —
though many experts claim it is — 70 or 75 per cent of the game
of baseball.
Just ask Sadecki. A few nights back he was cruising along with
a one-hit shutout when first-baseman Willie McCovey's dropped
popup enabled the Dodgers to score four unearned runs in the
ninth to win 4-1. The fact that Sadecki pitched brilliantly could not
alter the final 4-1 tally recorded on the scoreboard.
The Giants can win the 1968 pennant. They have the best pitch
ing staff in baseball, but it'll take better fielding, better base
running and better hitting than they've been getting to beat the
Cardinals.

The less said about the recent WBA championship fight between
Jerry Quarry and Jimmy Ellis the better. If the fight was any
indication of the calibre of talent in the current heavyweight crop,
we'd propose retaining deposed champ Muhammed Ali as the reign
ing titlist.
Ellis was declared the winner of a fight in which neither con
testant showed any agression, polish or extraordinary skill. If
All was there to witness the fiasco, he must have felt very com
fortable. Even after five years in jail, a slowed and rusty Ali
would have no trouble with either Ellis or Quarry.
