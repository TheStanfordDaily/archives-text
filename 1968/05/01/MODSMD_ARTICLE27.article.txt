## 
### PETER DUFFY 
The Stanford Indians extend
ed their winning skein of five
games as they won a double
header from the Oregon State
Beavers Monday by scores of
2-0, and 11-2, and downed the
Oregon Ducks yesterday 11-3
in a single contest.
The opener in Monday's
doubleheader was marked by
the return to form of Stanford
righthander Don Rose, who
handcuffed Oregon State on
three hits in a 2-0 victory, strik
ing out four and walking one
in the process.
For Rose, a junior, it was
his first major start this year
and he responded with a com-'
plete game shutout Ineligible
last quarter and bothered by
arm trouble last year, the tal
ented righthander now ap
pears ready to assume a regu
lar starting role.
The addition of Rose, who
was most valuable player on the
1966 freshman squad, will give
the Tribe a starting staff of five
hard throwing righthanders in
Rose, Harvey Shank, Rod Po
teete, Phil Keller and Sandy
Vance. This gives Stanford val
uable depth as they try to re
gain the Pac-8 lead from the
USC Trojans.
Bob Boone, who has been

swinging a hot bat lately,
batted in both Tribe runs with
a 410 ft. homer in the first
and an RBI single in the
fourth.
In the nightcap Monday the
Tribe pounded out 14 hits in an
11-2 rout. Ron Shotts paced the
Tribe with three RBl's as he
belted a single, double and two
run homer over the centerfield
fence in three trips to the plate.
Bob Gallagher also knocked
in three runs with a sacrifice fly
and a two run single, as the
Beavers used three pitchers in
the contest.
, Rod Poteete allowed seven
hits and struck out ten without
walking a man in posting his
sixth win of the year against
two setbacks.
Chuck Williams, who had
three hits in the second Oregon
State game, came back yester
day against the Ducks to blast
a two-run homer in the 11-3 vic
tory.
Williams, who also rapped
a homer Saturday, is wielding
a hot stick. He started Satur
day at shortstop for the in
jured Tweet and already he
Is tied for the team lead in
home runds. Not only is he hit
ting the ball, but is also play
ing an excellent game at short
stop for the Tribe.

Boone continued to hit the
ball as he rapped out two dou
bles and a single in five trips,
driving in five runs against the
Ducks. Gallagher, who is also
in a hitting groove, collected
three singles and two RBl's,
while Shotts added a pair of
hits as well.
The Tribe was tied with the
Ducks at three apiece going
into the sixth, but tallied four
big markers in that frame
to pull away.
With two away and Shotts on
first, Sandy Vance reached base
on an error by Duck shortstop
John Guthrie. Duck hurler Jon
Wheeler then walked Mark Mar
quess and Mike Schomaker for
one run, and threw a wild pitch
to bring home another and move
the runners to second and third
Gallagher then laced a single,
scoring Marquess and Schomak
er, to put the game on ice.
Sandy Vance gave up seven
hits, striking out eleven and
walking four, in posting his
sixth win of the year against
a pair of losses.
