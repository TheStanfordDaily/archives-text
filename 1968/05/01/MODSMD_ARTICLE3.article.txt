# Black Journalist Studies Ancestry
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
Black journalist Alex Haley
last night told an audience of
several hundred in TMU of his
attempts to trace his ancestry.
His work, "a very, very exhaus
tive black geneology study,"
will be the subject of a new
book.
Haley, co-author of "The Auto
biography of Malcolm X", has
been interested in his ances
tors since his youth.
At age 4, he recalled listening
to his grandmother's "long, con
voluted tale." No one else in
the family seemed to pay much
attention to what she said, but
Haley recalled the family re
unions when all of the old wom
en would talk of their history.
Later when he became an es
tablished writer, he casually re
searched his middle name of

Murray, thinking that it would
be the name of the plantation
owner for whom his family had
worked. What he found "fasci
nated me — the first bite of
geneological bug."
He managed to trace his fam
ily back to a maimed slave in
Maryland, who turned out to be
his earliest relative in America.
He also gathered up scraps of
dialect that his family had pre
served for generations, and with
the aid of an expert on African
language, Haley discovered what
region of Africa the family was
from.
"This happened on a Wednes
day. I was in Africa on Mon
day — there was just no other
way," he smiled. Once there he
learned from town elders, with
the aid of the phonetic clues,
which tribe he was in. In ad
dition, he said, "People could
tell from looking at me."
He made a long trip into the
back country in an effort to
pinpoint the exact location from
which where his slave ancestor
was kidnapped. After a long
talk with the tribal chief, Haley
discovered further family roots.
But what he had just dis
covered was only the maternal
side of the family, and he set
about tracing his paternal side.
He found out that his grand
father was a white. Irishman.
"So I went to Ireland."
There he hired professional
geneologists and now has r
lengthly list of Irish relatives.
"With this list, I know I'm go
ing to turn up some startled
cousins."
