## 
### 
The registrar's advisory com
mittee said last week that It
had decided to permit graduat
ing seniors to be exempt from
final examinations in spring
quarter again this year, at the
discretion of the instructor.
The Academic Council had ap
proved a two-year trial period
of letting the teacher decide
whether seniors could be ex
empt from the final in his
course during spring quarter.
The senior also had the option
of taking the exam in spite of
the teacher's decision.
Last year should have been
the final one for the trial, but
the advisory committee decided
to extend the option to this
quarter so as not to disrupt
"arrangements which might al
ready have been made between
instructors and graduation can
didates," a committee memo dis
tributed to instructional staff
said.
The committee also ruled that
students reporting for perman
anent jobs could expect to have
their petitions for change of
exam times approved.
The committee also said that
students reporting for a sum
mer job who could show by doc
umentation that "employment is
contingent upon the student's
being present on a specific date"
and whose instructors approve
could expect to get his exam
schedule change approved.
