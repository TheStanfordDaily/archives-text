# New York Police End Student Sit-In
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — New
York City police stormed five
occupied Columbia University
buildings in the dead of night
Tuesday and broke up a week
long student sit-in, which had
paralyzed the Ivy League cam
pus.
"We anticipate a full schedule
of classes Wednesday," a uni
versity spokesman announced.
However, even as he spoke,
undergraduate militants sought
to promote an all-out strike of
students and faculty. Their tar
get was Columbia President
Grayson Kirk, who called in the
police to smash the disruptive
demonstration.
Groups roamed the littered
uptorn Manhattan campus,
shouting, "Kirk must go! Kirk
must go!"
Kirk said he had no intention
of resigning.
The demonstrations were
sponsored by white students for
a Democratic Society and black
Students for an Afro-American
Society.
The Negroes, barked by the
white group, protested con
struction of an $11.5-million
university gymnasium on 2.1
acres of Morningside Park, a
public area which separates
Columbia from Harlem. They

joined neighborhood activists
in contending the gym de
prived the Harlem community
of a needed part of the 30-arre
park. •
Midway in the demonstration,
as its crippling effects spread,
the university agreed to a tem
porary suspension of the gym
project. The demonstrators then
demanded total amnesty as
their price for ending the sit-ins.
Kirk already was committed to
disciplinary action against them
for violating college regulations.
In the club swinging, fist
fighting, pushing and kneeing
that marked the violent subju
gation of the Columbia demon
strators, 100 youths and 15 po
licemen were reported injured,
none seriously. There were 628
arrests, on charges of trespass
ing.
The early morning assault
against the barricaded and oc
cupied buildings turned the
once • placid Morningside
Heights campus into a dark
and seething uproar of stu
dents, who bled, wept, scream
ed and denounced police as
"fascists."
There were complaints of po
lice brutality against the 600 to
700 students whose sit-ins began
April 23. Columbia has an en
rollment of 25,381.
