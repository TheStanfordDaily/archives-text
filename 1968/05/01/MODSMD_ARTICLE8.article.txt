### 
ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Gov.
Nelson . Rockefeller, reversing
his previous position, threw him
self into contention Tuesday for
the Republican Presidential nom
ination and vowed to fight Rich
ard Nixon for it, "right up to
the last vote."
"I now commit myself to
seeking this office—and so serve
our nation —with all my heart
and mind and will," he said.
Republican leaders across the
nation welcomed Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller into the presidential
race Tuesday .
Many felt he would not be
able to overcome Richard Nix
on's lead. Some wondered how
Rockefeller's action will affect
Gov. Ronald Reagan of Califor
nia who is so far only a favor
ite-son candidate.
Nixon himself said Rockefel
ler's active candidacy will
"make for a more exciting con
vention and will result in a
more meaningful discussion of
the issues."
"He can conduct a very vigor
ous campaign from his strong
position as governor of New
York, but I think I'll win the
nomination," said Nixon, who
was in Harrisburg, Pa., confer
ring with Gov. Raymond Shafer.
In a conversation at his offi
cial residence later, Rockefeller
said to a reporter, "The country
has changed. Never in history
has so much changed in five
weeks. Now I am giving the
people an option."
• Massachusetts J ote
BOSTON AP) — Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller of New York
emerged as the write-in favorite
of Massachusetts Republicans
Tuesday in the presidential
preference section of the pri
mary ballot.
The voting already was under
way when Rockefeller an
nounced his candidacy in Al
bany.
Massachusetts Gov. John

Volpe, the only candidate with
his name printed on the ballot,
ran ahead as a favorite son can
didate, but with his eye really
on the vice presidency.
But Rockefeller, at the half
way mark neared in the count,
was running well ahead of the
only other major announced Re
publican candidate, former Vice
President Richard Nixon.
On the Democratic ballot,
Sen. Eugene McCarthy D-Min.,
also alone on the preference
section of the ballot, ran as ex
pected far ahead of Sen. Robert
F. Kennedy, D-N.Y., a native
son of Massachusetts, and Vice
President Hubert H. Humphrey.
The names of Kennedy and
Humphrey were not on the bal
lot and neither made any drive
for white-in support.
The latest returns gave:
Republican (848 of 1,734 pre
cincts)
Volpe 21,436
Nixon 13,514
Rockefeller 16,542

• Heart Patient Dips
PARIS (AP) — A 66-year-old
French grandfather, the oldest
man to undergo a heart trans
plant, died Tuesday when the
strong young heart placed in his
chest flooded his lungs with
blood, according to an autopsy
report.
Clovis Roblain died Tuesday
51 1 hours after he received a
new heart. Dr. Charistian Ca
brol, who headed the transplant
team, said the autopsy showed
he "had a deficient circulatory
system and because he had re
mained in bed for so long he

had numerous clots in his
veins."
"When a new and vigorous
heart propelled a normal circu
latory flow, it swept away all
the clots and completely flooded
his longs," Cabrol said.
Dr. Maurice Mercadier, chief
of surgery at La Pitie Hospital
where Robtain underwent the
nine-hour operation Saturday
night ,said earlier that the re
tired truck driver had suc
cumbed to an insufficient flow
of blood to the brain.
There was no immediate ex
planation how the autopsy re
sults could bo reconciled with
the explanation of death given
by Mercadier, who did not parti
cipate in the operation but was
spokesman for the team.
Roblain, called "Pop" by hh
friends, never regained con
sciousness after the operation at
La Pitie.
Doctors gave Roblain, who
suffered a cardiac attack 1 rt
year, the heart of Michel Gyp
paz, a 23-year-old metal worker
who died Friday of brain injur
ies suffered in an auto collision
The doctors said Roblain's
age was a major problem. Mer
cadier said, "We must have a
patient sufficiently resistant to
have a chance of success," in op
erations the team plans in the
future.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Rep
resentatives of the Poor Peo
ple's Campaign calling on some
of the most powerful men in
government continued to got red
carpet treatment Tuesday but
their leader insisted: "We don't
just want sympathy, we want
action."
Taking stock on the cam
paign's second day, the Rev.
Ralph Abernath assured his
followers that polite receptions
and declarations of good inten
sions won't sway him.
The plan is still to bring thou

sands of poor persons to Wash
ington, ho said, to camp here
and apply mounting pressure to
the governmental apparatus un
til the lot of America's poor im
proves dramatically.
"They were concerned about
our demonstrations," Abernathy
said after a round of confer
ences. "We made it clear wo in
tend to conduct nonviolent,
peaceful demonstrations. Wo
also made it vory clear to thorn
that we are leaders of a revolu
tion that is taking place in this
country today."

Tuesday for a quick U.S. ratifi
cation of a plan for paper gold
the first basic change in inter
national currency in more than
two decades.
In a special message to Con
gress, Johnson .said Iho United
States, as a leader in the five
years of negotiations which led
to the plan, should be one of the
first nations to ratify it.
He called the plan a landmark
and a historic step and said fail
ure to approve it 'could turn
the clock backward to the dark
days of restrictive economic
policies, narrow interests, empty
ports and idle men."
If ratified by 65 nations with
an 80 per cent weighted vote in
the International Monetary
Fund the agreement will repre
sent the first basic change in
IMF operations since the Fund
was established by the Bretton
Woods conference of 1944.
The new money would take
the form of a bookkeeping entry
on government and IMF books
and would be called officially a
Special Drawing Right, or SDR
in the Fund. Individual citizens
would never sec it.
It would be created when and
as needed to supplement con
