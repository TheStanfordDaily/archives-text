# Playing With Fire
## 
### 
On Monday we suggested that the Stanford administration and
Board of Trustees would be wise to aet soon on a number of
basic issues concerning the role of students in the University.
One of these issues is the judicial system for students.
Wallace Sterling should know he is playing with fire. No other
issue has been more inflammatory at universities than disciplinary
action against students for politically motivated violations. Yet
Sterling is stalling on an intelligent plan for judicial reform sub
mitted to him months ago by the Committee of Fifteen.
This plan could head off many student-administration conflicts
in Stanford's next few troubled years. It would set up a "legis
lative council" of faculty, students and administrators to draw
up regulations for student conduct and discipline. The Univer
sity president would keep a veto on their actions.
"Presumably if students have a say in what rules the Univer
sity makes, the problem of getting them to follow them will dis
appear," says one Committee of Fifteen member.
The judicial reform would set up a student-faculty "Stanford
Judicial Couneil" to enforce the regulations. This would replace
the all-student Judicial Council and the all-faculty Interm Judi
cial Body which have caused so much futile controversy this
year.
Why hasn't Sterling accepted these intelligent, moderate re
forms? Because he resists any method of selection of the student
members of the legislative and judicial councils that would "ex
clude the President of the University." In other words, he wants
some kind of veto.
The Committee of Fifteen has suggested several methods for
choosing the student members, including selection by a student
faculty board chosen by the ASSU president and the Academic
Senate.
Wallace Sterling has neither logic nor wisdom on his side,
should he continue to resist a compromise on judicial reform.
And time isn't on his side, either.
