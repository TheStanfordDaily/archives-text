# Springer Press: Student Enemy No. 1
## 
### Robert Wheeler 
(The following- reply to national
columnists Max Lerner and
Drew Pearson is submitted by
Robert Wheeler, an instructor
in the history department)
The total ignorance and prej
udice exhibited by Max Lerner
and Drew Pearson in their re
cent feature articles in the
Daily, is nothing less than an
insult to the intelligence of the
Stanford community. Allow me
to help set the record straight
with an exerpt from the over
seas edition of the Manchester
Guardian, a highly respected
moderate English newspaper
(4-18-68).
"The students are right . . .
to identify Springer as their
chief and most powerful enemy.
He is not only against the ex
treme radicalism of Rudi Dut
schke but against all radicalism
and all radicals. Herr Springer
does not want to make friends
with Eastern Europe. He wants
West Germany to have the
Bomb. He supports above all
other politicians the right wing
Finance Minister, Franz Josef

Strauss. He probably has suc
cumbed to the newspaper mag
nate's disease—a hankering for
power without responsibility, a
desire to run the country with
out running for office. He cer
tainly owns more newspapers
than are good for him . . .
"Worst of all, from the stu
dents' point 'of view, Herr
Springer has consistently and
immoderately condemned their
movement, their desire for
change, and their methods. Per
haps the students take offence
too easily; students must expect
this sort of thing from their
elders. But perhaps Herr Spring
er, for his part, condemns the
students too readily. A desire to
change society is not a crime.
Nor is it a crime to want to
change the educational system.
German conservatives like Herr
Springer have always tended to
call every nonconformist a Com
munist and to assume that the
argument ends there. The argu
ment used to end there when
Hitler was in power, but it
ought not to end there now.

"Since Hitler's death West
Germans have protested not too
much but too little. Democracy
is an animal that needs exercise.
Perhaps the Germans do not
realise that their rights can
wither away if they do not use
them. Perhaps the Germans ab
hor protest because they abhor
being in a minority. Perhaps
they still revere authority too
much. Perhaps, too, people who
have been given their democrat
ic liberty instead of having to
fight for it are inclined to value
their rights less highly because
they were a gift. Whatever the
answer the radical students
throughout Germany cannot be
blamed for demanding change.
Nor can they be blamed for the
manner of their demand. With
the grand coalition in power in
Bonn there is only nominal po
litical Opposition in Germany,
and there has been no effective
Opposition since the death of
the Social Democrats last radi
cal leader, Kurt Schumacher."
It is interesting to note that
Schumacher was the last West
German political figure of any
importance to have spent time
in a Concentration Camp. The
current Chancellor, Kurt Kis
singer, was a Nazi party mem
ber from 1933-45.
In the same issue Norman
Crossland, the Guardian's Ger
man correspondent, writes that
the headline writers of the
Springer press in Berlin have
described student demonstrators

as "academic spivs", "neurotics",
"Communists", and "undergrad
uate mob". Crossland goes on
to note further that "After the
student, Benno Ohnesorg, was
shot dead by a policeman last
June, the Springer press at first
chose to ignore the brutality of
the police and the ineptness of
the measures taken by the Ber
lin Senate and contented itself
with printing halftruths from
the authorities and letters from
readers letting off steam about
the students". While Springer
attempts to improve the West
German 'image' abroad by con
tributing to library construction
in Israel, his papers foster a
pogrom atmosphere at home
against a new minority scape
goat, the students!
But not only Springer finds
the student movements useful
as a scapegoat. Only a few days
ago Chancellor Kissinger blamed
the increase in the vote of the
neo-Nazi NPD in the state elec
tions of Baden-Wurttemberg on
the student demonstrations. This
despite the fact that the NPD
has made dramatic gains in
every state election it has en
tered in the past two years.
Over a year ago it was general
ly conceded that the NPD would
continue to roll up impressive
gains in the state elections and
could expect to elect about 20
members to the next Bundestag.
Actually the students have been
the most active opponents of
the NPD.

If the shadow of the Nazi past
haunts Germany today, it is not
the younger generation that is
responsible but rather those
adults who continue to confuse
the terms 'democracy' and 'free
dom' with 'order' and "authori
ty'.

answer the radical students
throughout Germany cannot be

manner of their demand. With
the grand coalition in power in
Bonn there is only nominal po
litical Opposition in Germany,
and there has been no effective
Opposition since the death of
the Social Democrats last radi
cal leader, Kurt Schumacher."
It is interesting to note that
Schumacher was the last West
German political figure of any
importance to have spent time
in a Concentration Camp. The
current Chancellor, Kurt Kis
singer, was a Nazi party mem
ber from 1933-45.
In the same issue Norman
Crossland, the Guardian's Ger
man correspondent, writes that
the headline writers of the
Springer press in Berlin have
described student demonstrators

as "academic spivs", "neurotics",
"Communists", and "undergrad
uate mob". Crossland goes on
to note further that "After the
student, Benno Ohnesorg, was
shot dead by a policeman last
June, the Springer press at first
chose to ignore the brutality of
the police and the ineptness of
the measures taken by the Ber
lin Senate and contented itself
with printing halftruths from
the authorities and letters from
readers letting off steam about
the students". While Springer
attempts to improve the West
German 'image' abroad by con
tributing to library construction
in Israel, his papers foster a
pogrom atmosphere at home
against a new minority scape
goat, the students!
But not only Springer finds
the student movements useful
as a scapegoat. Only a few days
ago Chancellor Kissinger blamed
the increase in the vote of the
neo-Nazi NPD in the state elec
tions of Baden-Wurttemberg on
the student demonstrations. This
despite the fact that the NPD
has made dramatic gains in
every state election it has en
tered in the past two years.
Over a year ago it was general
ly conceded that the NPD would
continue to roll up impressive
gains in the state elections and
could expect to elect about 20
members to the next Bundestag.
Actually the students have been
the most active opponents of
the NPD.

If the shadow of the Nazi past
haunts Germany today, it is not
the younger generation that is
responsible but rather those
adults who continue to confuse
the terms 'democracy' and 'free
dom' with 'order' and "authori
ty'.

columnists Max Lerner and
Drew Pearson is submitted by
Robert Wheeler, an instructor
in the history department)
The total ignorance and prej
udice exhibited by Max Lerner
and Drew Pearson in their re
cent feature articles in the
Daily, is nothing less than an
insult to the intelligence of the
Stanford community. Allow me
to help set the record straight
with an exerpt from the over
seas edition of the Manchester
Guardian, a highly respected
moderate English newspaper
(4-18-68).
"The students are right . . .
to identify Springer as their
chief and most powerful enemy.
He is not only against the ex
treme radicalism of Rudi Dut
schke but against all radicalism
and all radicals. Herr Springer
does not want to make friends
with Eastern Europe. He wants
West Germany to have the
Bomb. He supports above all
other politicians the right wing
Finance Minister, Franz Josef

Strauss. He probably has suc
cumbed to the newspaper mag
nate's disease—a hankering for
power without responsibility, a
desire to run the country with
out running for office. He cer
tainly owns more newspapers
than are good for him . . .
"Worst of all, from the stu
dents' point 'of view, Herr
Springer has consistently and
immoderately condemned their
movement, their desire for
change, and their methods. Per
haps the students take offence
too easily; students must expect
this sort of thing from their
elders. But perhaps Herr Spring
er, for his part, condemns the
students too readily. A desire to
change society is not a crime.
Nor is it a crime to want to
change the educational system.
German conservatives like Herr
Springer have always tended to
call every nonconformist a Com
munist and to assume that the
argument ends there. The argu
ment used to end there when
Hitler was in power, but it
ought not to end there now.

"Since Hitler's death West
Germans have protested not too
much but too little. Democracy
is an animal that needs exercise.
Perhaps the Germans do not
realise that their rights can
wither away if they do not use
them. Perhaps the Germans ab
hor protest because they abhor
being in a minority. Perhaps
they still revere authority too
much. Perhaps, too, people who
have been given their democrat
ic liberty instead of having to
fight for it are inclined to value
their rights less highly because
they were a gift. Whatever the
answer the radical students
throughout Germany cannot be
blamed for demanding change.
Nor can they be blamed for the
manner of their demand. With
the grand coalition in power in
Bonn there is only nominal po
litical Opposition in Germany,
and there has been no effective
Opposition since the death of
the Social Democrats last radi
cal leader, Kurt Schumacher."
It is interesting to note that
Schumacher was the last West
German political figure of any
importance to have spent time
in a Concentration Camp. The
current Chancellor, Kurt Kis
singer, was a Nazi party mem
ber from 1933-45.
In the same issue Norman
Crossland, the Guardian's Ger
man correspondent, writes that
the headline writers of the
Springer press in Berlin have
described student demonstrators

as "academic spivs", "neurotics",
"Communists", and "undergrad
uate mob". Crossland goes on
to note further that "After the
student, Benno Ohnesorg, was
shot dead by a policeman last
June, the Springer press at first
chose to ignore the brutality of
the police and the ineptness of
the measures taken by the Ber
lin Senate and contented itself
with printing halftruths from
the authorities and letters from
readers letting off steam about
the students". While Springer
attempts to improve the West
German 'image' abroad by con
tributing to library construction
in Israel, his papers foster a
pogrom atmosphere at home
against a new minority scape
goat, the students!
But not only Springer finds
the student movements useful
as a scapegoat. Only a few days
ago Chancellor Kissinger blamed
the increase in the vote of the
neo-Nazi NPD in the state elec
tions of Baden-Wurttemberg on
the student demonstrations. This
despite the fact that the NPD
has made dramatic gains in
every state election it has en
tered in the past two years.
Over a year ago it was general
ly conceded that the NPD would
continue to roll up impressive
gains in the state elections and
could expect to elect about 20
members to the next Bundestag.
Actually the students have been
the most active opponents of
the NPD.

If the shadow of the Nazi past
haunts Germany today, it is not
the younger generation that is
responsible but rather those
adults who continue to confuse
the terms 'democracy' and 'free
dom' with 'order' and "authori
ty'.
