# Humphrey Builds A Campaign

WASHINGTON - When Vice
President Humphrey delivered
his recent speech on building
bridges to China, most people
figured that either he was break
ing with President Johnson or
had cleared his speech with the
White House in advance. Real
fact is that he had done neither.
It was a speech quite differ
ent from that of six months
ago when he talked about
"militant aggressive Asian com
munism with its headquarters
in Peking." Instead, last week
he talked about replacing "iron
curtains" with "open doors."
"I look forward to the day
when the great Chinese people,
no longer victimized from with
in, take their place in the mod
ern world," Humphrey said.
People who wondered about
the speech didn't know that af
ter its delivery the Vice Presi
dent got a phone call from Pres
dent Johnson congratulating
him. They also didn't know that
previously Johnson had told
Humphrey to go out "on your
own, make your own policy."
"It was a great speech," the
President said after delivery.

"It was the same speech you
delivered at White Sulphur
Springs last year," the Vice Pres
ident replied.
HHH Organizes
Before Vice President Hum
phrey made it official, behind
the scenes he had been making
a lot of political hay. He now
has a close-knit campaign or
ganization, a top money raiser,
and a brainstrust, together with
a lot of delegates quietly pledg
ed around the nation.
Most interesting member of
the Humphrey team is Dick
Maguire, one-time money-raiser
for John F. Kennedy and once
a close friend of the Kennedy
family. Today, however, Ma
guire is esconced in the May
flower hotel in Washington as
treasurer of "United Democrats
for Humphrey."
The Vice President's cam
paign managers are two live
wire members of the Senate â€”
Fred Harris of Oklahoma, who
may be the next Senate Demo
cratic Whip, and Walter Mon
dale, Hubert's fellow Minneso
tan.

Bob Short, former owner of
the Minneapolis Lakers, who
was Minnesota campaign man
ager for Sen. Estes Kefauver
when Kefauver trounced both
Adlai Stevenson and Humphrey
in the 1952 Minnesota primary,
has also joined the Vice Presi
dent's brain trust.
Italian-American Senator
Humphrey's most interesting
Senate backer is the leading Ita
lian-American of the nation, Sen.
John Pastore of Rhode Island,
Pastore packs a lot of punch in
the Senate, also in the White
House. President Johnson gives
him credit for his new technique
in holding televised press con
ferences.
"That little bantam rooster
came in here and told me to
stop being a Baptist preacher,"
the President told a friend.
" 'Get away from the podium,'
he said, 'and be the old swinging
Lyndon Johnson!'"
Sen. Pastore suffered a heart
attack this winter, and also has
been under attack by the Ken
nedy forces. Bobby Kennedy has
applied tremendous pressure to
get Pastore to support him. He

has argued that Rhode Island is
the neighbor of Massachusetts
and he wanted all of New En
gland to be for him for Presi
dent.
Despite the pressure, the Vice
President last week got a call
from Sen. Pastore.
"Hubert," he said, "I've just
called the Providence papers
in here and I've told them I'm
for you. You're the best quali
fied man we have to be Presi
dent."
"Can I quote you on that?"
Humphrey asked.
"Sure you can," Sen. Pastore
replied.
The Vice President has talked
to members of the Johnson cabi
net, and with three exceptions,
advised them not to endorse him.
He was fearful of the political
reaction.
"I can just hear Bobby say in
his next speech that Lyndon
Johnson was meat-axing me by
turning his entire Cabinet loose
to cut me up," the Vice Presi
dent told Cabinet friends. "He's
just waiting for a chance to
make that speech."
