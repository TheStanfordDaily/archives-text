# 'The Farm' In Berkeley?

### 
Editor, The Daily:
Several weeks ago the SES
released its report on Greater
Minorities at Stanford, and a
few months ago they comment
ed on the housing deficiencies
at Stanford. All contain much
needed reform. However, the
SES has neglected one area in
its study of education at the
university — the area of inter
campus communication.
We believe that there is a defi
nite lack of communication be
tween students at Berkeley and
at Stanford and a need for a
campus exchange program.
Also, there exists a problem of
arranging for transfer of credits

from one institution to the oth
er. Therefore, we propose that
the SES implement as soon as
possible a program allowing
course work at the other institu
tion.
The program would entail ex
changing a certain number of
students for a quarter's dura
tion. Primarily open to upper
division students who would pay
the regularly-stated fees at the
respective institution, it would
allow for a one-to-one transfer
of units and grades for students
involved and eliminate most of
the bureaucratic red-tape. Fur
ther enrollment at the institu
tion would have to revert back
to normal admissions proced

ures. Of course, scholarships
and other financial aid would
have to be adjusted for students
entering the program.
We feel that the advantages
derived would be an increased
awareness of the general stu
dent community around the area
and a polarization of viewpoints.
It would also enable students to
take courses which cannot be
taken at Stanford and vice ver
sa. In essence, it would be a
Stanford - in - Berkeley program,
except that admission to the
program would not hinge upon
maintenance of a specific GPA.

6 McCarthy The Man'
Seen By His Record
Editor, The Daily:
Senator McCarthy's support
ers repeatedly tell us that he is
a totally committed idealist
above political compromise. His
recent record strongly suggests
otherwise.
McCarthy's "total" commit
ment to civil rights is illustra
tive. Shortly before the Wiscon
sin primary an open split devel
oped in McCarthy's staff over
his failure to formulate a strong
civil rights position. Moreover,
a number of McCarthy's aides
were dissatisfied with his fail
ure to campaign actively in the
ghettos — only one out of 49
campaign offices in the state
was in a Negro area and that
was the last office to be open
ed — and his failure to utilize
Negro talent in responsible staff
positions.
The New York Times (March
27, 1968, p. 31) reported that Mc-
Carthy's campaign director op
posed any major civil rights ac
tivity before the primary because
of his "fear of arousing opposi
tion in the heavily Polish and
German wards in Milwaukee.
There is much anti-Negro feel
ing in those wards because of
the demonstrations for improve
ment in slum conditions led by
the Rev. James E. Groppi." The
Senator's response to questions
concerning the staff split was
that he record was "clear on
civil rights" and that he would
continue nis campaign as plan
ned.
However, on March 29, Sena
tor McCarthy finally made plans
to appear on a tour of the Mil
waukee ghetto. A campaign aide
attributed McCarthy's previous
failure to appear in the area
to "lack of time." But the Sen
ator previously had managed to
find time for such diverse acti
vities as an appearance in Wau
sau — the heart of the Wiscon
sin dairy country — to propose
increased federal subsidies for
dairy farmers and an appear
ance in Stevens Point to address
local union leaders.
The Wisconsin experience
seems to demonstrate that there
is a McCarthy The Man who is
quite a different fellow from Mc-
Carthy The Product Of Wistful
Imagination. Can we now begin
to discuss The Man?
