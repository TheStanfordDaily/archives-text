# Trancos House Tries Innovation In Advising
## 
### DAN SNELL 
An innovation in the concept
of residence-oriented academic
advising is being put to the test
in Trancos House this year.
Trancos, one of the Wilbur
Hall houses, has 90 freshmen
men. In theory six professors
meet frequently with their ad
visees in the house on an infor
mal basis over dinner or at spe
cial advising sessions held quar
terly in the house.
The advisers also led an un
dergraduate special seminar last
quarter, "Law, Man, and Na
ture," which about a fourth of
the Trancos freshmen took.
All freshman advisers are
assigned groups of students
who live In the same house,
but contact like that brought
about this year in Trancos has
been largely an individual ad
viser's affair.
The subcommittee on advis
ing of the General Studies Com
mittee moved last year to try
this "experiment" to get advis
ers more involved in the affairs
of the freshman residences. The
move to get advisers to the resi
dences was originally to have
consisted of two all-freshman
dorms, but in the end the pro
gram could be started only in
Trancos.
The program pivots about the
faculty resident for the house,
Doug Davis, a graduate of Stan
ford's law school and an assist
ant dean of students. Davis and


'NO EXIT' — Actors from the Studio Watts Workshop portray
characters In hell in the play by Jean-Paul Sartre. The play will
be presented in the Serra House courtyard this Friday and Satur
day at 8 p.m. Tickets are 50c for students and $1 for adults. There
may not be enough chairs so bring pillows and blankets.
