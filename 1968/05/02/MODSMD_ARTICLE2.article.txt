# Black Admissions
## GPA's Almost Equal 
### 
Black students admitted to
Stanford next fall have some
what lower grades and college
board scores than non-blacks,
the University disclosed this
week.
Robert Rosenzweig, associate
provost, said that black students
admitted to the 1968 freshman
class have a median grade point
average about one-third of a
point lower than non-blacks and
scored about 100 points lower
on college board verbal and
math aptitude tests.

The differences, however, are
comparable to those within re
cent entering classes of fresh
men, in which black students
have performed about on a par
with nonblack students.
"All students were admitted
on the prediction that they were
fully capable of succeeding in
Stanford's rigorous academic
program.
"Test scores and grades
form only part of the basis on
which students are judged.
Letters of reference, inter
views and personal statements
are evaluated carefully for
those distinctive qualities of
mind, character, and motiva
tion that make successful stu
dents and outstanding adults."
A total of 74 black students
have been admitted for next
fall, an increase of about 40 per
cent over last year at this time.
Members of the Black Student
Union called these students last
week to encourage them to at
tend the university next year.
Their calls were part of a
broad University effort to dou
ble present enrollment of black
students to about 350 by 1969-
70. At present, there are ap
proximately 100 black under
graduates and 50 black graduate
students at Stanford.
A recent report drafted by
Rosenzweig urged a sharp ex
pansion in financial aid for
black students admitted to
Stanford. Now adopted by
President Wallace Sterling,

Provost Richard Lyman and
unanimously endorsed by the
faculty, this recommendation
Is the most costly component
in a series of University com
mitments to expand minority
enrollment and employment.
Total estimated costs may ex
ceed $1 million by 1969-70.
Data released by Rosenzweig
on median grade point averages
and college board scores among
those already admitted as fresh
men is as follows:
ADMITTED
Nonblacks Blacks
G.P.A. 3.90 3.61
Verbal 663 558
Math 689 577
NOT ADMITTED
Nonblacks Blacks
G.P.A. 3.68 3.15
Verbal 616 460
Math 644 485
Stanford is also developing a
new pilot program for ten stu
dents from minority groups.
The program will be headed by
Professor Robert Hess from the
School of Education, a national
ly known expert in urban youth
education.
The students will be admitted
this fall. They will be selected
from those who do not meet
present Stanford admissions cri
teria but are deemed capable of
high-level college work with tu
toring and other assistance. Re
sults of the pilot program are
expected to shed new light on
admissions criteria.
