## 
### 
A special matinee perform
ance has been added to the
schedule for "Carnival," Ram's
Held Productions' spring show.
The matinee, to be held Sat
urday afternoon, May 18, will be
for youth groups, with children
from the Convalescent Home be
ing admitted free. The day of
the performance is the last day
of Con Home Week.
School and scouting groups
will be admitted at a reduced
rate.
The additional show was made
possible through a contribution
from Hewlett-Packard.
Tickets are on sale now for
the Memorial Auditorium show
at the Tresidder Union box of
fice. Prices are $2.60, $2.10, $1.60,
and $1.10. The show runs the
nights of May 16, 17, 18, 23, 24,
and 25, besides the matinee.
Block tickets, for 20 or more
people, are available at a 20 per
cent discount. Anyone interested
should contact Coco Pratt or the
Ram's Head office.

John Goheen, professor of phi
losophy, have done the organi
zational work.
Goheen was expecting to have
trouble in getting faculty to be
advising "fellows" in the house,
but he said, "No one I asked
turned me down."
The advisers have co-operated
in giving the house seminar, five
of the advisers directing the dis
cussion for one evening.
In a recent report Davis and
Goheen wrote, "The class pro
vides a vehicle for Interaction
between the adviser and the
students. They come together
to discuss a topic of mutual
interest that opens up avenues

for subsequent personal con
tact and advising 1 ."
The advisers encourage fresh
men to come to any one of them
for advice. The freshmen are
told that any of the advisers
will be willing to talk to him
and also to sign his study list
card at registration.
According to Goheen, this lets
the student get acquainted with
scholars in a variety of disci
plines.
Goheen admits that students
do not come to see advisers so
frequently in their offices. But
he says there is much more con
tact in the Trancos program
than in office-oriented advising.

and $1.10. The show runs the
nights of May 16, 17, 18, 23, 24,
and 25, besides the matinee.
Block tickets, for 20 or more
people, are available at a 20 per
cent discount. Anyone interested
should contact Coco Pratt or the
Ram's Head office.

John Goheen, professor of phi
losophy, have done the organi
zational work.
Goheen was expecting to have
trouble in getting faculty to be
advising "fellows" in the house,
but he said, "No one I asked
turned me down."
The advisers have co-operated
in giving the house seminar, five
of the advisers directing the dis
cussion for one evening.
In a recent report Davis and
Goheen wrote, "The class pro
vides a vehicle for Interaction
between the adviser and the
students. They come together
to discuss a topic of mutual
interest that opens up avenues

for subsequent personal con
tact and advising 1 ."
The advisers encourage fresh
men to come to any one of them
for advice. The freshmen are
told that any of the advisers
will be willing to talk to him
and also to sign his study list
card at registration.
According to Goheen, this lets
the student get acquainted with
scholars in a variety of disci
plines.
Goheen admits that students
do not come to see advisers so
frequently in their offices. But
he says there is much more con
tact in the Trancos program
than in office-oriented advising.
