# Actors From Watts To Present 'No Exit'
## 
### 
"No Exit," a play by Jean-
Paul Sarte, will be given at Ser
ra House in Stern Hall Friday
and Saturday evenings by actor
apprentices from the Studio
Watts Workshop in Los Angeles.
The play is about three people
who have died and are in hell,
the hell of not being able to
communicate with others. It will
be given at 8 p.m. in the Serra
House courtyard.
Tickets will be sold at the
door —$1 for adults, 50c for stu
dents. Those attending are asked
to bring pillows and blankets, in
case there aren't enough chairs
to go around. The play is being
directed by James M. Woods,
founder-president of Studio
Watts Workshop. The actors are
Cheryl Powell, Wanda Coleman,
Xavier Nash, and Samuel Mc-
Gowan.
Woods was here a couple of
weeks ago as guest-in-residence
at Serra House. He described

the Watts Workshop which he
and his wife began in January
1965. It is being run on a master
apprentice basis in the Negro
ghetto area of Los Angeles with
about 100 enrolled as appren
tices and six masters.
He sees the art forms (design,
drama, dance, writing, muisc)
taught and learned as "ve
hicles of change," rather than
art for art's sake. Ke says,
"Art is the tool we use to
establish In a person a sense
of worth and personal value."
The apprentices, Woods ex
plained, are school dropouts of
Watts, alienated youths who are
searching for their place in life.
He continued, "The problem of
sensitive people dropping out—
and they're the ones that do—
is that at that point of aliena
tion they are not in a position
to communicate. We have to re
store communication . . . find
what we have in common, de
velop a communication situa
tion.
"One key," Woods explained,
"is to develop a technique for a
creative breakthrough of the
tension that is where alienation

is, where dropping out is." He
looks for a "something" to do
together.
"Another key," he went on,
"is to understand exposure. If
you increase Negro exposure
to white understanding, for
example, you begin to break
the myths of both. Placing in
dividuals In new environments
makes observation possible,
understanding a potential. The
ghetto gives the Negro no new
exposure, no new experience
. . . nor do white ghettos, rich
or poor.
"We try to remove the void
ness of experience of the ghetto
individual . . . and we're all ghet
to individuals in some degree.
We work to create new exper
iences, new exposure, new com
munication situations. An indi
vidual isolated, alienated from
all that is, suffers from voidness.
Voidness is caused by separated
ness, by segmentation, by un
knowing.
"The real key is the healing
of voidness so that a richness
occurs . . . politically, socially,
economically. Racism is just
one avenue out of voidness."
