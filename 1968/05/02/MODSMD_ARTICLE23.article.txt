# Computer Service Expansion Planned
## 
### 
In response to a $700,000 grant
from the Ford Foundation, Stan
ford plans to speed up a pro
gram already underway to more
effectively use computer capa
bilities in its administrative op
erations.
Dubbed Project INFO — In
formation Network For Opera
tions — the University will be
able to design and test in three
years instead of nine a coordi
nated and comprehensive infor
mation system covering pur
chasing, personnel, student ser
vices, alumni, finance and insti
tutional self-study.
The overall goal, reports
Colin MacLeod, systems coordi
nator and manager of Project

INFO, is to improve efficiency
without compromising individ
ualism or quality of education.
"Recent advances in data proc
essing technology, properly ap
plied through new computer
equipment, promise improved
services to students and faculty,
economy in day-to-day activities,
and better information for man
agement decisions. As this proj
ect processes, it will report on
innovative uses for these new
management tools," MacLeod
said.
For example, Stanford now
has many separate systems of
information and recordkeeping,
including different files kept hy
various administrative and de
partmental offices. Project INFO
will integrate and bring this in
formation together into one com
puter file, to eliminate duplica
tion of data and clerical effort.
This central "data bank" will,
through a communication net
work, be able to provide infor
mation to authorized users at
remote points on the campus.
Some examples include:
— For Personnel, which keeps
track of 10,000 employees: fac
ulty, researchers and admini
strative staff — for Payroll,
Benefits, Employee Directory
and basic personnel informa
tion;
— Student services, provid
ing basic data for directories,
courses and grades for nhnut
12,000 students, with Informa
tion kept current through me
Registrar's Office;
— Finance, to keep track of
the more $140 million a year it
takes to operate the University:
tuition fees, scholarships, gifts
from alumni, payrolls, expendi
tures for goods and services.

I)K. JOHN MARQI'IS, chief clinical psychologist at the Menlo
Park Veteran's Administration Hospital, will lead the discussion
following tonight's performance of "The Inspector General" at
8 p.m. in the Little Theater. Tickets for the SRT performance are
available at Tresidder Box Office.

Dubbed Project INFO — In
formation Network For Opera
tions — the University will be
able to design and test in three
years instead of nine a coordi
nated and comprehensive infor
mation system covering pur
chasing, personnel, student ser
vices, alumni, finance and insti
tutional self-study.
The overall goal, reports
Colin MacLeod, systems coordi
nator and manager of Project

INFO, is to improve efficiency
without compromising individ
ualism or quality of education.
"Recent advances in data proc
essing technology, properly ap
plied through new computer
equipment, promise improved
services to students and faculty,
economy in day-to-day activities,
and better information for man
agement decisions. As this proj
ect processes, it will report on
innovative uses for these new
management tools," MacLeod
said.
For example, Stanford now
has many separate systems of
information and recordkeeping,
including different files kept hy
various administrative and de
partmental offices. Project INFO
will integrate and bring this in
formation together into one com
puter file, to eliminate duplica
tion of data and clerical effort.
This central "data bank" will,
through a communication net
work, be able to provide infor
mation to authorized users at
remote points on the campus.
Some examples include:

track of 10,000 employees: fac
