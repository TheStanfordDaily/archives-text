# Biz School Teach-In
## Speak-Out Delays Talk 
### PAUL DE LIBAN 
About 100 Stanford Business
school students staged a half
hour "speak-out" backing Ameri
can world involvement today
outside the Graduate School of
Business delaying the start of
the teach-in, on imperialism,
sponsored by Students for a
Democratic Society and the Palo
Alto Concerned Citizens.
Speech instructor John Kulsar
said the "speak out" gave stu
dents in public speaking a
chance to test their skills before
a relatively small, transient
crowd.
He said the event was "entire
ly voluntary" and not part of a
regular class.
Half an hour after the "speak
out" started, Kulsar suggested
students move into the auditor
ium. He acted in response to a
request from Associate Dean of
Students Bill Wyman.
William Dumoff, author of
Who Rules America?, presented
his views on the destruction of
corporate capitalism in America
yesterday in Bishop Auditorium.
His was the first speech in a
teach-in.
Dumhoff strongly condemned
what he called "corporate feud
alism" in America.
Three Points
He outlined three points for
revolutionaries to follow in
achieving power. The three
needs are: (1) a comprehensive
overall program, (2) relatively
detailed plans for improvement
on today's society and plans
for post-industrial America, and
(3) a program for taking power.
The first revolutionary activ
ity for students, he said, is to
research and analyze the pres
ent system in order to more ef
fectively criticize it.
He suggested students de
velop iheir own blueprints for
a post-industrial society. These
should stress local political con
trol with "freedom, flexibility,

and individuality."
One need not rely on foreign
inspirations such as Mao, Lenin,
Trotsky, or Marx, he said. "You
are Americans and you want to
build a better America."
Pychsic guerrilla warfare is
the most effective or practical
method of weakening the cor
porate rich, Dumhoff implied.
Using psychological dynamite
to blast the corporate system
has several prerequisites.. The
first step is to form a new open
party. Then one must develop
local party chapters, followed
by the formation of governing
bodies to rule when the party
secures the Presidency. When
the Presidency is reached, the
local governing bodies should
take over, thus putting the en
tire nation under the control
of the revolutionaries.
Infiltration of Army
In achieving this goal, in
filtration of the army is import
ant, said Dumhoff. The corporate
rich depend upon the army to
maintain their position, and if
the army is effectively infil
trated, it will be unwilling to fire
upon the non-violent revolution
aries.
The initial bases of power for
the revolution are radical stu
dents and professors. After
them, the youth have the great
est potential. Disaffected teach
ers and blue collar workers are
the third source of support.
Rightest support should also
be courted, he said. In dealing
with the right, religion should
not be an issue; it was in Ameri
ca before the industrial society
and will remain so in the post
industrial society. Finally, in
dividuality must be respected.
For additional support, Dum
hoff suggests the revolutionar
ies meet the blacks when they
have determined where they are
going. Blue collar support will
come once they realize their
need for the revolutionaries.

Dumhoff said the corporate
rich should not be fought, but re
placed. The group should plan
governing bodies to take over
when the party assumes power,
and run candidates for political
office. If the corporate rich at
tempt suppression by force the
revolutionaries must call on the
police for protection. A truly
effective job will lead to much
popular support and the fall
of the rich, Dumhoff said.
