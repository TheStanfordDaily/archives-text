# Okinawa Conference Views Island's Problems, Future
## 
### 
Tomorrow and Saturday Stan
ford will host the "first, confer
ence of its kind on the Okin
awan question." The student-or
ganized conference will present
speakers representing the Amer
ican, Okinawan, and Japanese
positions on the small, Pacific
island which plays such a stra
tegic part in the United State's
East Asia foreign policy.
Pat Shea, one of the student
organizers of the conference and
a junior in political science, ex
p'ained that the Okinawa con
ference presents students with
the unique opportunity of being
able to express a major voice
in a foreign policy change.
Students who participated in
the Volunteers in Asia (VIA)
Hong Kong project provided the
initial impetus for the confer
once.
According to VIA head
Dwight Clark, "While many
Americans remain unaware
how galling this question is to
the Japanese, it is a subject
of continual controversy in the
Japanese press."
The conference will begin to
morrow night at 8 when three
speakers will present the re
spective positions.
John Emmerson, former
Charge d'Affaires with the Amer
ican Embassy in Tokyo from
1962-66 and currently a member
of the Stanford political science

department, will offer the Amer
ican government's view. Emmer
son was closely involved in the
Okinawan question during his
work in Japan.
The two other panel members
are native Okinawans. Prof.
Toshio Akamine, who is cur
rently a member of the Wash
ington State faculty, will dis
cuss how Okinawans in general
regard the American presence.
One of the major spokesmen
of the Japanese government on
Okinawa and a personal advisor
of Prime Minister Sato, Dr. No
bumoto Ohama will discuss his
government's position. In Sep
temper of 1967, Ohama argued
that "the Okinawa issue is the
cancer of Japan-U.S. relations."
Concern is particularly ris
ing among Japanese students
because the Mutual
Treaty between the United
States and Japan comes up for
renewal in 1970.
"The Japanese government
is in sympathy with the student
demands," Shea notes. "But it
has such strong ties, economic
ally and militarily, with the
United States that it can't right
eously and indignantly demand
the island's return."
So important does the Jap
anese government regard dis
cussion of the problem, they are
paying the travelling expenses
of Ohama and Prof. Kei Waka

izmi of Kyoto Industrial Univer
sity, who will participate in a
Saturday panel discussion.
Prof. George Kerr, who has
written the only full length
English book which deals ade
quately with the Okinawan
situation, will discuss the his
torical and cultural past of
the island 11:30 Saturday)
morning.
Saturday afternoon at 1:30
Wakaizumi will be joined by
Col. Humphreys of the Hoover
Institution and Tamotsu Takase,
who is retiring as Deputy Cura
tor of the East Asian Collection
at Hoover to teach at Kyoto In
dutsrial University. Wakaizumi
is regarded as one of the top
military experts on Far Eastern
affairs and is second in com
mand in one of Japan's largest
private defense contracting cor
porations.
Col. Humphreys has done
studies of Japanese self-con
trol treaties and is regarded
as an expert on arms control.
Takase has been involved in
both Japanese and American
research on the Okinawan
question.

of Okinawa, particularly as they

with Japan and American pres
ence.
