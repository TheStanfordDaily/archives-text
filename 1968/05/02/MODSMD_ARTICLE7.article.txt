# CORE Official For McCarthy
## 
### KIM BELL 
The head of the Public Utili
ties Commission of California
and a Black civil rights organizer
joined together last night in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium to sup
port the candidacy of Senator
Eugene McCarthy.
Both men laid heavy empha
sis on the implications of the
Senator's challenge to the Presi
dent and to the Democratic

Party.
Wiliiam M. Bennet, the Utili
ties Commissioner, a lawyer,
and a candidate for the U.S.
Senate from California, began
the two-part presentation by
stating that both Senator Mc-
Carthy and Senator Kennedy
have equivalent voting records
on civil rights.
What distinguishes the two
men, he went on to say, was
McCarthy's "demonstration of
courage, when courage in the
face of the administration was
conspicuously scarce."
"Apart from his positive rec
ord on the rights question, the
Senator's brave comment on
Vietnam has been his greatest
public contribution to the civil
rights cause," Bennett asserted.
"Because without that ... all
discussion of other subjects is
idle talk."
Elijah Turner, the second
member of the panel, spoke as
the national treasurer of the
Congress of Racial Equality
(CORE) and as its Oakland
chapter chairman. "One of the
biggest problems with poli
ticians in America is their ten
dency to make political moves
rather than moral moves," he
said.
Turner went on to say that
he considered McCarthy's can
didacy a "moral move" and in
dicated that he endorsed the
Senator because only he could
"push politics in America to
wards the right direction."
