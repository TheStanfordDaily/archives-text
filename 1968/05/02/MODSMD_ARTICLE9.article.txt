## Warship Probable Peace Talk Site 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
White House quickly agreed
Wednesday to an Indonesian
proposal to hold preliminary
peace talks with North Vietnam
aboard an Indonesian cruiser to
be sent to Tonkin Gulf.
Indonesia's foreign minister,
Adam Malik, said after a cabi
net meeting in Jakarta that his
country has told the opposing
sides it is willing to sail a cruis
er to the Tonkin Gulf—lying be
tween the North Vietnamese
and Red Chinese coasts —for a
meeting site.
Malik reported no formal re
ply had arrived yet from either
Washington or Hanoi, although
the Communists had agreed to
three peace talk sites — Phnom
Penh, Cambodia or Warsaw.
An Indonesian site is presum
ably objectionable to North
Vietnam's ally, Communist Chi
na. Peking broke relations with
Indonesia after the current lead
ership there ousted the left-lean
ing Sukarno regime.
The White House said Indone
sia's offer — which comes in ad
dition to 15 Asian and European
locations previously proposed
by U.S. diplomats — "is accept

able to the United States.
"A neutral ship on a neutral
sea would be a good meeting
place," news secretary George
Christian told newsmen in words
recalling some presidential ora
tory aboard the U.S. carrier En
terprise last Veterans Day.
• Tax Bill Near?
WASHINGTON (AP)—Presi
dent Johnson's campaign for a
$10-billion tax increase was
blasted out of deadlock Wednes
day when the House Appropria
tions Committee agreed on an
$18-billion total long and short
range appropriations cut.
The committee specified that
the reduction must include an
actual spending cut of not less
than $4 billion beginning July
1. Because of long-range pro
grams, appropriations and
spending never exactly coincide
in any one year.
The committee action, adop
tion of a resolution setting out
its intentions, does not guaran
tee that the tax-economy bill
will be passed, or even that it
will be submitted in the form
outlined.
Republicans said they will

carry on the fight for deeper
cuts, and some Democrats are
known to be ready to join them.
Nevertheless, the action goes
a long way toward meeting the
price that economy advocates
set for a tax increase and it is
certain to revive meaningful
discussion of a bill that has been
bogged down in a Senate-House
conference for weeks.
• Columbia Quieter
NEW YORK (AP) — More
fighting erupted between police
and a handful of Columbia Uni
versity students Wednesday, and
later Wednesday night some 400
Negroes marched from Harlem
to Columbia's gates, carrying
such signs as "Now you know
why we hate cops."
The Negro demonstrators,
who circled the campus during
their march but did not enter
it, were joined by about 100 pre
dominately white students at
Columbia for a march back to
Harlem, where the crowd dis
persed.
As they strode through Morn
ingside Park adjoining Colum
bia's campus, the marchers —
mostly highly school-aged young

sters — clapped and chanted:
"Morningside Park Is The DMZ.
On the other side is the
En-em-y."
• Rockefeller Wins
BOSTON (AP)— Gov. Nelson
A. Rockefeller of New York won
a surprise victory on the Repub
lican ballot in the Massachusetts
primary or write-in support that
developed with the announce
ment of his presidential candi
dacy.
Gov. John Volpe, running un
opposed as a favorite son, had
been expected to win, but the
tabulation of returns showed
Wednesday that Rockefeller
won by about 1000 votes on the
same day that he entered the
race.
Sen. Eugene McCarthy of
Minn., the only candidate on the
Democratic ballot, received
slightly more than 50 percent
of his party's vote. Sen. Robert
F. Kennedy ran second, outdis
tancing Vice-president Hubert
Humphrey, by a 3 to 2 margin
in write-ins.
Former Vice-president Rich
ard Nixon was third in the Re

publican column, about 5,000
votes behind Rockefeller.
• Communist May Day
(AP) —Boots thumped on the
streets of Moscow, Peking and
East Berlin Wednesday while
Prague's hippies and Boy Scouts
marched out of step in May Day
parades that showed the cracks
and contrasts in the face of
communism.
"Down with Zionists," "Shame
on the Americans," placards in
Warsaw said.
"Make love not war," "Truth
prevails but it is hard work,"
read those in Prague, where a
wave of liberalization has made
free speech possible and elimi

reflexes of the orthodox Com
munist world.

dent Johnson's campaign for a
$10-billion tax increase was
blasted out of deadlock Wednes
day when the House Appropria
tions Committee agreed on an
$18-billion total long and short
range appropriations cut.
The committee specified that
the reduction must include an
actual spending cut of not less
than $4 billion beginning July
1. Because of long-range pro
grams, appropriations and
spending never exactly coincide
in any one year.
The committee action, adop
tion of a resolution setting out
its intentions, does not guaran
tee that the tax-economy bill
will be passed, or even that it
will be submitted in the form
outlined.
Republicans said they will

carry on the fight for deeper
cuts, and some Democrats are
known to be ready to join them.
Nevertheless, the action goes
a long way toward meeting the
price that economy advocates
set for a tax increase and it is
certain to revive meaningful
discussion of a bill that has been
bogged down in a Senate-House
conference for weeks.
• Columbia Quieter
NEW YORK (AP) — More
fighting erupted between police
and a handful of Columbia Uni
versity students Wednesday, and
later Wednesday night some 400
Negroes marched from Harlem
to Columbia's gates, carrying
such signs as "Now you know
why we hate cops."
The Negro demonstrators,
who circled the campus during
their march but did not enter
it, were joined by about 100 pre
dominately white students at
Columbia for a march back to
Harlem, where the crowd dis
persed.
As they strode through Morn
ingside Park adjoining Colum
bia's campus, the marchers —
mostly highly school-aged young

sters — clapped and chanted:
"Morningside Park Is The DMZ.
On the other side is the
En-em-y."
• Rockefeller Wins
BOSTON (AP)— Gov. Nelson
A. Rockefeller of New York won
a surprise victory on the Repub
lican ballot in the Massachusetts
primary or write-in support that
developed with the announce
ment of his presidential candi
dacy.
Gov. John Volpe, running un
opposed as a favorite son, had
been expected to win, but the
tabulation of returns showed
Wednesday that Rockefeller
won by about 1000 votes on the
same day that he entered the
race.
Sen. Eugene McCarthy of
Minn., the only candidate on the
Democratic ballot, received
slightly more than 50 percent
of his party's vote. Sen. Robert
F. Kennedy ran second, outdis
tancing Vice-president Hubert
Humphrey, by a 3 to 2 margin
in write-ins.
Former Vice-president Rich
ard Nixon was third in the Re

publican column, about 5,000
votes behind Rockefeller.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The
White House quickly agreed
Wednesday to an Indonesian
proposal to hold preliminary
peace talks with North Vietnam
aboard an Indonesian cruiser to
be sent to Tonkin Gulf.
Indonesia's foreign minister,
Adam Malik, said after a cabi
net meeting in Jakarta that his
country has told the opposing
sides it is willing to sail a cruis
er to the Tonkin Gulf—lying be
tween the North Vietnamese
and Red Chinese coasts —for a
meeting site.
Malik reported no formal re
ply had arrived yet from either
Washington or Hanoi, although
the Communists had agreed to
three peace talk sites — Phnom
Penh, Cambodia or Warsaw.
An Indonesian site is presum
ably objectionable to North
Vietnam's ally, Communist Chi
na. Peking broke relations with
Indonesia after the current lead
ership there ousted the left-lean
ing Sukarno regime.
The White House said Indone
sia's offer — which comes in ad
dition to 15 Asian and European
locations previously proposed
by U.S. diplomats — "is accept

able to the United States.
"A neutral ship on a neutral
sea would be a good meeting

who circled the campus during
their march but did not enter
it, were joined by about 100 pre
dominately white students at
Columbia for a march back to
Harlem, where the crowd dis
persed.
As they strode through Morn
ingside Park adjoining Colum
bia's campus, the marchers —
mostly highly school-aged young

sters — clapped and chanted:
"Morningside Park Is The DMZ.
On the other side is the
En-em-y."
• Rockefeller Wins
BOSTON (AP)— Gov. Nelson
A. Rockefeller of New York won
a surprise victory on the Repub
lican ballot in the Massachusetts
primary or write-in support that
developed with the announce
ment of his presidential candi
dacy.
Gov. John Volpe, running un
opposed as a favorite son, had
been expected to win, but the
tabulation of returns showed
Wednesday that Rockefeller
won by about 1000 votes on the
same day that he entered the
race.
Sen. Eugene McCarthy of
Minn., the only candidate on the
Democratic ballot, received
slightly more than 50 percent
of his party's vote. Sen. Robert
F. Kennedy ran second, outdis
tancing Vice-president Hubert
Humphrey, by a 3 to 2 margin
in write-ins.
Former Vice-president Rich
ard Nixon was third in the Re

publican column, about 5,000
votes behind Rockefeller.
• Communist May Day
(AP) —Boots thumped on the
streets of Moscow, Peking and
East Berlin Wednesday while
Prague's hippies and Boy Scouts
marched out of step in May Day
parades that showed the cracks
and contrasts in the face of
communism.
"Down with Zionists," "Shame
on the Americans," placards in
Warsaw said.
"Make love not war," "Truth
prevails but it is hard work,"
read those in Prague, where a
wave of liberalization has made
free speech possible and elimi

reflexes of the orthodox Com

WASHINGTON (AP) — The
White House quickly agreed
Wednesday to an Indonesian
proposal to hold preliminary
peace talks with North Vietnam
aboard an Indonesian cruiser to
be sent to Tonkin Gulf.
Indonesia's foreign minister,
Adam Malik, said after a cabi
net meeting in Jakarta that his
country has told the opposing
sides it is willing to sail a cruis
er to the Tonkin Gulf—lying be
tween the North Vietnamese
and Red Chinese coasts —for a
meeting site.
Malik reported no formal re
ply had arrived yet from either
Washington or Hanoi, although
the Communists had agreed to
three peace talk sites — Phnom
Penh, Cambodia or Warsaw.
An Indonesian site is presum
ably objectionable to North
Vietnam's ally, Communist Chi
na. Peking broke relations with
Indonesia after the current lead
ership there ousted the left-lean
ing Sukarno regime.
The White House said Indone
sia's offer — which comes in ad
dition to 15 Asian and European
locations previously proposed
by U.S. diplomats — "is accept

able to the United States.
"A neutral ship on a neutral
sea would be a good meeting
place," news secretary George
Christian told newsmen in words
recalling some presidential ora
tory aboard the U.S. carrier En
terprise last Veterans Day.
• Tax Bill Near?
WASHINGTON (AP)—Presi
dent Johnson's campaign for a
$10-billion tax increase was
blasted out of deadlock Wednes
day when the House Appropria
tions Committee agreed on an
$18-billion total long and short
range appropriations cut.
The committee specified that
the reduction must include an
actual spending cut of not less
than $4 billion beginning July
1. Because of long-range pro
grams, appropriations and
spending never exactly coincide
in any one year.
The committee action, adop
tion of a resolution setting out
its intentions, does not guaran
tee that the tax-economy bill
will be passed, or even that it
will be submitted in the form
outlined.
Republicans said they will

carry on the fight for deeper
cuts, and some Democrats are
known to be ready to join them.
Nevertheless, the action goes
a long way toward meeting the
price that economy advocates
set for a tax increase and it is
certain to revive meaningful
discussion of a bill that has been
bogged down in a Senate-House
conference for weeks.

NEW YORK (AP) — More
