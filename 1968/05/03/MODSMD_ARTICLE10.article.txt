# Attack On IJB
## 
### 
(The following statement was
issued yesterday by the ASSU
Judicial Council in response to
the guilty verdict passed on sev
en student demonstrators by the
all-faculty Interim Judicial
Body (IJB). On February 19 the
Judicial Council found the de
fendants not guilty of the same
charges because the l)niversity's
demonstrations policy was "un
enforceable.")
The University has deprived
the defendants in the CIA dem
onstration case, or some of
them, of their civil right to due
process of law and has breached,
as to the defendants, or some of
them, a contractual obligation
of fair treatment, in that:
1. The Interim Judicial Body
does not have jurisdiction over
any students.
2. The IJB does not have jur
isdiction over such of the de
fendants as did not appear at
the IJB hearing.
3. The IJB does not have jur
isdiction over such of the de
fendants as are not registered
this quarter.
1. The IJB does not have jur
isdiction over this case.
5. The IJB does not have jur
isdiction over the factual issues
in this case.
6. The decision of the IJB ap
plied an unconstitutionally
vague and overbroad policy, and
the defendants were therefore
deprived of the right guaranteed
by the ASSU By-Laws "to pro
vide for their own regulations
by means of a judicial system
incorporating traditional and ac
cepted safeguards of individual
liberties."
7. The verdict of the IJB, as
to each of the defendants with

the possible exception of Yale
Braunstein, is not supported by
the evidence presented at the
IJB hearing, and the defendants
are therefore deprived of the
right guaranteed by the ASSU
By-Laws "to be considered inno
cent until proven guilty."
8. The opinion of the IJB does
not specify in what way and to
what degree the defendants
have violated University policy,
and the defendants have violated
University policy, and the de
fendants are therefore deprived
on the rights implicit in the
ASSU By-Laws "to be informed
of the charge against him and
of the alleged act upon which
the charge is based."
9. The sentence of the IJB is
not in proportion to previous
sentences of the IJB or ASSU
Judicial Council in similar cases,
and the defendants are therefore
deprived of the rights implicit
in Article IV, Section 1, B, 1-3
of the ASSU By-laws.
In view of 7 and 8 above and
of the fact which was developed
at the hearings of the ASSU
Judicial Council in this case
that at least five of the original
nine defendants were not active
participants in the demonstra
tion and did not commit any ac
tion that could be condemned as
a violation of the University
Policy on Campus Demonstra
tions, if it were enforceable, or
of the Fundamental Standard, it
is apparent that the IJB has
found several of the defendants
guilty of a violation of Univer
sity policy on the basis of their
mere presence in the demonstra
tion.
This raises another due proc
ess objection to the conviction
of these defendants. . . .

is apparent that the IJB has
found several of the defendants
guilty of a violation of Univer
sity policy on the basis of their
mere presence in the demonstra
tion.
This raises another due proc
ess objection to the conviction
of these defendants. . . .
(The following statement was
issued yesterday by the ASSU
Judicial Council in response to
the guilty verdict passed on sev
en student demonstrators by the
all-faculty Interim Judicial
Body (IJB). On February 19 the
Judicial Council found the de
fendants not guilty of the same
charges because the l)niversity's
demonstrations policy was "un
enforceable.")
The University has deprived
the defendants in the CIA dem
onstration case, or some of
them, of their civil right to due
process of law and has breached,
as to the defendants, or some of
them, a contractual obligation
of fair treatment, in that:
1. The Interim Judicial Body
does not have jurisdiction over
any students.
2. The IJB does not have jur
isdiction over such of the de
fendants as did not appear at
the IJB hearing.
3. The IJB does not have jur
isdiction over such of the de
fendants as are not registered
this quarter.
1. The IJB does not have jur
isdiction over this case.
5. The IJB does not have jur
isdiction over the factual issues
in this case.
6. The decision of the IJB ap
plied an unconstitutionally
vague and overbroad policy, and
the defendants were therefore
deprived of the right guaranteed
by the ASSU By-Laws "to pro
vide for their own regulations
by means of a judicial system
incorporating traditional and ac
cepted safeguards of individual
liberties."
7. The verdict of the IJB, as
to each of the defendants with

the possible exception of Yale
Braunstein, is not supported by
the evidence presented at the
IJB hearing, and the defendants
are therefore deprived of the
right guaranteed by the ASSU
By-Laws "to be considered inno
cent until proven guilty."
8. The opinion of the IJB does
not specify in what way and to
what degree the defendants
have violated University policy,
and the defendants have violated
University policy, and the de
fendants are therefore deprived
on the rights implicit in the
ASSU By-Laws "to be informed
of the charge against him and
of the alleged act upon which
the charge is based."
9. The sentence of the IJB is
not in proportion to previous
sentences of the IJB or ASSU
Judicial Council in similar cases,
and the defendants are therefore
deprived of the rights implicit
in Article IV, Section 1, B, 1-3
of the ASSU By-laws.
In view of 7 and 8 above and
of the fact which was developed
at the hearings of the ASSU
Judicial Council in this case
that at least five of the original
nine defendants were not active
participants in the demonstra
tion and did not commit any ac
tion that could be condemned as
a violation of the University
Policy on Campus Demonstra
tions, if it were enforceable, or
of the Fundamental Standard, it
is apparent that the IJB has
found several of the defendants
guilty of a violation of Univer
sity policy on the basis of their
mere presence in the demonstra
tion.

ess objection to the conviction
