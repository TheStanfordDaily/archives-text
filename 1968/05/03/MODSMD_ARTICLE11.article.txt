## Judicial Proposal Not Final 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
As student members of the
Committee of the Fifteen, we
think the editorial of May 2 re
garding judicial reform to be ill
timed and unfortunate.
There are three issues which
we would like to make clear:
1. During the presentation of
the judicial proposals to LASSU
on April 18, the Legislature was
in closed session, and it was
made explicit that all reports
and discussion were to be con
fidential, until the Committee of
Fifteen had issued a proposal
in its final form. The editorial
of May 2 violates that confiden
tiality.
2. The proposals which the
Legislature discussed were ten
tative: they were working-pro
posals, which had not been sub
mitted to a final vote of the
Committee, nor been submitted
as a formal recommendation to
President Sterling.
3. Since President Sterling has
not received the completed rec
ommendation, it is irresponsible
for the editorial board to accuse
him of "stalling" or "resisting a
compromise."
We are confident that the
Committee's final proposal will
be an "intelligent, moderate re
form" mutually acceptable to
the student body and to Presi
dent Sterling.

IJB Decision Found
Lacking In Reasons
Editor, The Daily:
I have had the opportunity to

read the opinion of the IJB con
cerning the CIA demonstration.
The opinion made two signifi
cant decisions: one of the fac
tual question of the guilt of the
defendants and the other on the
question of whether the univer
sity policy on demonstrations
was enforceable.
In an example of clear and
careful judicial reasoning, the
factual issue was explained in
one conclusive sentence which
said the defendants were guilty.
The question of the enforceabili
ty of the university demonstra
tion policy was upheld in one
short paragraph which stated
that the ASSU Judicial Council
decision against enforceability
was contrary to previous deci
sions of that body and the IJB.
Normally a respectable Amer
ican court will spend some time
explaining and giving reasons
for its decision. The striking
thing about the IJB decision is
the scarcity of reasons in the
opinion. As students I guess we
should expect such behavior
from professors, but since the
IJB contains two law professors
one might expect a little better.

Columbia Should Heed
Lesson From Stanford
Editor, The Daily:
Already a faculty petition is
circulating in defense of Presi
dent Grayson Kirk of Columbia,
who called in police to evict the
600-700 protesting students at
that institution. It is reported
that 100 students and 15 police
men were injured, and 628 ar

rests made.
I do not approve of the sit
ting-in tactic as it was used at
Columbia, just as I didn't ap
prove of it when it was used
here at Stanford a few years
ago. But neither do I approve of
the up tight attitude of the Co
lumbia administration which, in
its persistent refusal to set up
lines of communication with stu
dents (and indeed with the jun
ior faculty), is primarily to
blame for the development of
the present crisis.
Where has Grayson Kirk been
all these years? Is he totally ig
norant of the experience of
Clark Kerr and, indeed, of Pres
ident Sterling? He has had sev
eral years in which to do his
homework and to wake up to
the fact that slamming doors
in students' faces is no longer
the way to conduct academic
business. It never was the way,
though some administrators
learn slowly, but now it is cWr
(••ind has been for some years)
that they cannot even get away
with it.
Clearly, what is needed is not
a petition getting faculty to line
up on one side or the other, but
a petition asking that a dialogue
be started. Maybe it is too late
for that, but it seems to me that
Stanford faculty should come
out for that instead of for po
lice repression of dissent.
If the students were wrong,
President Kirk and his adminis
tration were wrong first. The
signers of that protest petition
are, it seems to me, reacting
solely to the threat to authority
represented in the Columbia stu
dent uprising. The more impor

tant question to ask is what I
kind of authority that was. Was
it responsible? intelligent? rea
sonably tolerant? The evidence
that has come to my attention
suggests that it was none of
these things.
President Kirk could have
taken a lesson or two from the
way the Stanford administra
tion handled a comparable con
frontation a few days ago. Pres
ident Kirk seems, at the very
least, lamentably out of touch
with modem realities—at least
as far out of touch as Mayor
Daly of Chicago. I hope not
many Stanford faculty mem
bers sign that petition.

Columbia, just as I didn't ap
prove of it when it was used
here at Stanford a few years
ago. But neither do I approve of
the up tight attitude of the Co
lumbia administration which, in
its persistent refusal to set up
lines of communication with stu
dents (and indeed with the jun
ior faculty), is primarily to
blame for the development of
the present crisis.
Where has Grayson Kirk been
all these years? Is he totally ig
norant of the experience of
Clark Kerr and, indeed, of Pres
ident Sterling? He has had sev
eral years in which to do his
homework and to wake up to
the fact that slamming doors
in students' faces is no longer
the way to conduct academic
business. It never was the way,
though some administrators
learn slowly, but now it is cWr
(••ind has been for some years)
that they cannot even get away
with it.
Clearly, what is needed is not
a petition getting faculty to line
up on one side or the other, but
a petition asking that a dialogue
be started. Maybe it is too late
for that, but it seems to me that
Stanford faculty should come
out for that instead of for po
lice repression of dissent.
If the students were wrong,
President Kirk and his adminis
tration were wrong first. The
signers of that protest petition
are, it seems to me, reacting
solely to the threat to authority
represented in the Columbia stu
dent uprising. The more impor

tant question to ask is what I
kind of authority that was. Was
it responsible? intelligent? rea
sonably tolerant? The evidence
that has come to my attention
suggests that it was none of
these things.
President Kirk could have
taken a lesson or two from the
way the Stanford administra
tion handled a comparable con
frontation a few days ago. Pres
ident Kirk seems, at the very
least, lamentably out of touch
with modem realities—at least
as far out of touch as Mayor
Daly of Chicago. I hope not
many Stanford faculty mem
bers sign that petition.

As student members of the
Committee of the Fifteen, we
think the editorial of May 2 re
garding judicial reform to be ill
timed and unfortunate.
There are three issues which
we would like to make clear:
1. During the presentation of
the judicial proposals to LASSU
on April 18, the Legislature was
in closed session, and it was
made explicit that all reports
and discussion were to be con
fidential, until the Committee of
Fifteen had issued a proposal
in its final form. The editorial
of May 2 violates that confiden
tiality.
2. The proposals which the
Legislature discussed were ten
tative: they were working-pro
posals, which had not been sub
mitted to a final vote of the
Committee, nor been submitted
as a formal recommendation to
President Sterling.
3. Since President Sterling has
not received the completed rec
ommendation, it is irresponsible
for the editorial board to accuse
him of "stalling" or "resisting a
compromise."
We are confident that the
Committee's final proposal will
be an "intelligent, moderate re
form" mutually acceptable to
the student body and to Presi
dent Sterling.

IJB Decision Found
Lacking In Reasons
Editor, The Daily:
I have had the opportunity to

read the opinion of the IJB con
cerning the CIA demonstration.
The opinion made two signifi
cant decisions: one of the fac
tual question of the guilt of the
defendants and the other on the
question of whether the univer
sity policy on demonstrations
was enforceable.
In an example of clear and
careful judicial reasoning, the
factual issue was explained in
one conclusive sentence which
said the defendants were guilty.
The question of the enforceabili
ty of the university demonstra
tion policy was upheld in one
short paragraph which stated
that the ASSU Judicial Council
decision against enforceability
was contrary to previous deci
sions of that body and the IJB.
Normally a respectable Amer
ican court will spend some time
explaining and giving reasons
for its decision. The striking
thing about the IJB decision is
the scarcity of reasons in the
opinion. As students I guess we
should expect such behavior
from professors, but since the
IJB contains two law professors
one might expect a little better.

Committee of the Fifteen, we
think the editorial of May 2 re
garding judicial reform to be ill
timed and unfortunate.
There are three issues which
we would like to make clear:
1. During the presentation of
the judicial proposals to LASSU
on April 18, the Legislature was
in closed session, and it was
made explicit that all reports
and discussion were to be con
fidential, until the Committee of
Fifteen had issued a proposal
in its final form. The editorial
of May 2 violates that confiden
tiality.
2. The proposals which the
Legislature discussed were ten
tative: they were working-pro
posals, which had not been sub
mitted to a final vote of the
Committee, nor been submitted
as a formal recommendation to
President Sterling.
3. Since President Sterling has
not received the completed rec
ommendation, it is irresponsible
for the editorial board to accuse
him of "stalling" or "resisting a
compromise."
We are confident that the
Committee's final proposal will
be an "intelligent, moderate re
form" mutually acceptable to
the student body and to Presi
dent Sterling.

IJB Decision Found
Lacking In Reasons
Editor, The Daily:
I have had the opportunity to

read the opinion of the IJB con
cerning the CIA demonstration.
The opinion made two signifi
cant decisions: one of the fac
tual question of the guilt of the
defendants and the other on the
question of whether the univer
sity policy on demonstrations
was enforceable.
In an example of clear and
careful judicial reasoning, the
factual issue was explained in
one conclusive sentence which
said the defendants were guilty.
The question of the enforceabili
ty of the university demonstra
tion policy was upheld in one
short paragraph which stated
that the ASSU Judicial Council
decision against enforceability
was contrary to previous deci
sions of that body and the IJB.
Normally a respectable Amer
ican court will spend some time
explaining and giving reasons
for its decision. The striking
thing about the IJB decision is
the scarcity of reasons in the
opinion. As students I guess we
should expect such behavior
from professors, but since the
IJB contains two law professors
one might expect a little better.

Law School
Columbia Should Heed
Lesson From Stanford
Editor, The Daily:
Already a faculty petition is
circulating in defense of Presi
dent Grayson Kirk of Columbia,
who called in police to evict the
600-700 protesting students at
that institution. It is reported
that 100 students and 15 police
men were injured, and 628 ar

rests made.
I do not approve of the sit
ting-in tactic as it was used at
Columbia, just as I didn't ap
prove of it when it was used
here at Stanford a few years
ago. But neither do I approve of
the up tight attitude of the Co
lumbia administration which, in
its persistent refusal to set up
lines of communication with stu
dents (and indeed with the jun
ior faculty), is primarily to
blame for the development of
the present crisis.
Where has Grayson Kirk been
all these years? Is he totally ig
norant of the experience of
Clark Kerr and, indeed, of Pres
ident Sterling? He has had sev
eral years in which to do his
homework and to wake up to
the fact that slamming doors
in students' faces is no longer
the way to conduct academic
business. It never was the way,
though some administrators
learn slowly, but now it is cWr
(••ind has been for some years)
that they cannot even get away
with it.
Clearly, what is needed is not
a petition getting faculty to line
up on one side or the other, but
a petition asking that a dialogue
be started. Maybe it is too late
for that, but it seems to me that
Stanford faculty should come
out for that instead of for po
lice repression of dissent.
If the students were wrong,
President Kirk and his adminis
tration were wrong first. The
signers of that protest petition
are, it seems to me, reacting
solely to the threat to authority
represented in the Columbia stu
dent uprising. The more impor

tant question to ask is what I
kind of authority that was. Was
it responsible? intelligent? rea
sonably tolerant? The evidence
that has come to my attention
suggests that it was none of
these things.
President Kirk could have
taken a lesson or two from the
way the Stanford administra
tion handled a comparable con
frontation a few days ago. Pres
ident Kirk seems, at the very
least, lamentably out of touch
with modem realities—at least
as far out of touch as Mayor
Daly of Chicago. I hope not
many Stanford faculty mem
bers sign that petition.
