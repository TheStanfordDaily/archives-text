# The 						Washington Merry-Go-Round
## Past Mistakes Haunt Kennedy 
### Drew Pearson 
Robert F. Kennedy is a man
with a terrific Senate record, a
lot of courage—sometimes bor
dering on gall—and a strong
belief in the divine right of Ken
nedys. Though the 13 colonies
discarded the divine right of
kings 100 years before Bobby's
Irish ancestors migrated to Bos
ton, he still operates on the

theory that the nearest relative
should inherit the White House
throne.
What the American voter will
have to decide is whether he
wants a President whose chief
qualifications are brilliant abil
ity—not always well directed—
a lot of political know-how, ac
cess to a family fortune of $300,-

000,000, and the glamor of the
Kennedy name. The voter will
also have to decide whether
Bobby has matured enough to
profit from the mistakes of the
past.
This judgment will have to be
exercised particularly by liberal
voters who tend to regard Bob
by as their new knight in shin
ing armor, but who regarded his
late employer, Joseph R. Mc-
Carthy of Wisconsin, as the em
bodiment of evil.
Bobby latched onto McCar
thy's staff as a result of the fact
that old Joe Kennedy early had
contributed $50,000 to the Wis
consin Senator's witch-hunting
campaign and helped in a con
ference with the late Cardinal
Spellman to plot McCarthy's
course. Old Joe, therefore, was
in a position to ask that his son
be put on McCarthy's payroll.
He was.
McCarthy Exposed
Significantly, this was at a
time when most mature citizens
had reason to realize that Mc-
Carthy was a fake. He had been
thoroughly exposed for defend
ing the Nazi storm troopers who
massacred unarmed prisoners at
Malmedy in the Battle of the
Bulge. He had challenged the
patriotism of Gens. George Mar
shall and Dwight Eisenhower.
He had teamed up with anti-
Semitic rabble-rouser Gerald L.
K. Smith in an investigation of
Anna Rosenberg. He had slan
dered dozens of loyal Americans
without evidence. He had called
the Democratic party the "Party
of Treason" and accused the
Truman administration of har
boring 205 card-carrying Com
munists in the State Depart
ment.
Bobby Kennedy now wants to
be head of the Democratic party
and receive the blessing of the
Trumanites.
Sen. Kennedy's friends now
argue that he was too young to
pass judgment on Joe McCar
thy, that he knows his mistake
now that he has become a lib
eral. The truth is, however, that
Bobby has never repudiated the
demagogue from Wisconsin.

When in July 1953 every Senator
walked off McCarthy's commit
tee in protest over his methods,
Bobby remained on his staff. He
finally quit three weeks later
because he couldn't get along
with Roy Cohn, then general
counsel.
Two years afterward, Bobby
walked out of a banquet where
he was being honored as one of
the nation's ten "Outstanding
Young Men" because the main
speaker, the late Edward R.
Murrow, was critical of Joe Mc-
Carthy.
Bobby's biggest investigation
for McCarthy was into Aliled
trade with Communist China
during the Korean War. Ken
nedy was outraged over the
fact that the British, Greeks
and other allies shipping
supplies to the Chinese for pos
sible use against American
troops in Korea.
Kennedy Switch
Yet when the same question
came up 13 years later, Sen.
Robert Kennedy voted against
cutting off foreign aid to coun
tries engaged in trade with
North Vietnam. As the liberal
lodestar, he was no longer in
dignant against shipments that
might be used against Ameri
can troops—in this case in Viet
nam.
The late President Kennedy
has been criticized for not sound
ing off against McCarthy as did
other Democratic Senators. In
explanation JFK told James Mc-
Gregor Burns: "I was rather in
ill grace personally to be around
hollering about what McCarthy
had done in 1952 and 1951 when
my brother had been on the
staff in 1953. That is really the
guts of the matter."
Perhaps this is why old Jot
Kennedy bolstered up his third
son. "He's a great kid. He hates
the same way I do."
Has Sen. Kennedy now grown
up enough to profit from the
mistakes of the past?

the same way I do."
Has Sen. Kennedy now grown
up enough to profit from the
mistakes of the past?
(c) 1968, Bell-McClure Syndicate
Robert F. Kennedy is a man
with a terrific Senate record, a
lot of courage—sometimes bor
dering on gall—and a strong
belief in the divine right of Ken
nedys. Though the 13 colonies
discarded the divine right of
kings 100 years before Bobby's
Irish ancestors migrated to Bos
ton, he still operates on the

theory that the nearest relative
should inherit the White House
throne.
What the American voter will
have to decide is whether he
wants a President whose chief
qualifications are brilliant abil
ity—not always well directed—
a lot of political know-how, ac
cess to a family fortune of $300,-

000,000, and the glamor of the
Kennedy name. The voter will
also have to decide whether
Bobby has matured enough to
profit from the mistakes of the
past.
This judgment will have to be
exercised particularly by liberal
voters who tend to regard Bob
by as their new knight in shin
ing armor, but who regarded his
late employer, Joseph R. Mc-
Carthy of Wisconsin, as the em
bodiment of evil.
Bobby latched onto McCar
thy's staff as a result of the fact
that old Joe Kennedy early had
contributed $50,000 to the Wis
consin Senator's witch-hunting
campaign and helped in a con
ference with the late Cardinal
Spellman to plot McCarthy's
course. Old Joe, therefore, was
in a position to ask that his son
be put on McCarthy's payroll.
He was.
McCarthy Exposed
Significantly, this was at a
time when most mature citizens
had reason to realize that Mc-
Carthy was a fake. He had been
thoroughly exposed for defend
ing the Nazi storm troopers who
massacred unarmed prisoners at
Malmedy in the Battle of the
Bulge. He had challenged the
patriotism of Gens. George Mar
shall and Dwight Eisenhower.
He had teamed up with anti-
Semitic rabble-rouser Gerald L.
K. Smith in an investigation of
Anna Rosenberg. He had slan
dered dozens of loyal Americans
without evidence. He had called
the Democratic party the "Party
of Treason" and accused the
Truman administration of har
boring 205 card-carrying Com
munists in the State Depart
ment.
Bobby Kennedy now wants to
be head of the Democratic party
and receive the blessing of the
Trumanites.
Sen. Kennedy's friends now
argue that he was too young to
pass judgment on Joe McCar
thy, that he knows his mistake
now that he has become a lib
eral. The truth is, however, that
Bobby has never repudiated the
demagogue from Wisconsin.

When in July 1953 every Senator
walked off McCarthy's commit
tee in protest over his methods,
Bobby remained on his staff. He
finally quit three weeks later
because he couldn't get along
with Roy Cohn, then general
counsel.
Two years afterward, Bobby
walked out of a banquet where
he was being honored as one of
the nation's ten "Outstanding
Young Men" because the main
speaker, the late Edward R.
Murrow, was critical of Joe Mc-
Carthy.
Bobby's biggest investigation
for McCarthy was into Aliled
trade with Communist China
during the Korean War. Ken
nedy was outraged over the
fact that the British, Greeks
and other allies shipping
supplies to the Chinese for pos
sible use against American
troops in Korea.
Kennedy Switch
Yet when the same question
came up 13 years later, Sen.
Robert Kennedy voted against
cutting off foreign aid to coun
tries engaged in trade with
North Vietnam. As the liberal
lodestar, he was no longer in
dignant against shipments that
might be used against Ameri
can troops—in this case in Viet
nam.
The late President Kennedy
has been criticized for not sound
ing off against McCarthy as did
other Democratic Senators. In
explanation JFK told James Mc-
Gregor Burns: "I was rather in
ill grace personally to be around
hollering about what McCarthy
had done in 1952 and 1951 when
my brother had been on the
staff in 1953. That is really the
guts of the matter."
Perhaps this is why old Jot
Kennedy bolstered up his third
son. "He's a great kid. He hates
the same way I do."
