Platform Statement
Let's be honest.
We are not running for the offices of ASSU
president vice president. We are running to mo
bilize the power which students, by right and by
concern, deserve.
Stanford today is not a university, a commu
nity of scholars. Rather, it is only a collection
of fragmented and artificial constituencies, each
protecting its own interests and all failing to
construct Stanford as a true uni-versity.
The Board of Trustees holds the most power
yet knows and participates the least. The Admin
istration, whose members should be grease on
the cogs but are the cogs themselves, does not
administer what others decide but decides aca
demic policy by itself. The Faculty, who have ab

dicated their proper power, ratify rather than in
itiate academic change.
We as students can expect creative change only
if we change, only if we decide to seize the power
for decision-making that we, as membrs of the
Stanford Community, deserve. The Board of
Trustees, the Administration, the faculty did not
force the issues of pass-fail grading, co-ed hous
ing, work-study programs, and BSU demands.
Students did.
Why should others continue to hold all respon
sibility for innovation if their only qualification
is prior inertia?
And the power can be seized. In the last few
months students forced changes in Columbia's
building program, Boston University's academic
curriculum, University of Georgia's social rules,
Colgate's fraternity regulations, and the Uni
versity of Oregon's election of a new president.
In each case students, often in small numbers,
demonstrated their ability to affect university
decisions even though denied institutionalized
power.
We agree with Hayes', Hukari's, McDonald's
promises. We could promise more, but all reor
ganization of ASSU is just so much stirring of
alphabet soup: all promises of the preservation
of residences, the elimination of general studies,
the expansion of TMU should follow, not pre
cede, the mobilization of student power. Let's
avoid false consciousness.
We believe something is wrong in this univer
sity, in this society, and that we, as students,
have a right and an obligation to help try to cor
rect it, and this requires, first of all, student
power. We ask that you join us, that we all lay
our bodies on the line.
