# Hayes Demands Replacement For Meaningless Government
## 
### 
DENIS HAYES, 23, is a junior in history from
Camas, Washington, and currently is vice pres
ident of the Associated Students.
Hayes lives off-campus. He returned to Stan
ford this year after two years of travel and work
in Africa and Asia.
Hayes was elected ASSU vice president in
March in a special election to fill the vacancy
created by Peter Lyman's resignation as presi
dent and Cesare Massarenti's moving up to that
office. ran on a platform of ASSU consti
tutional reform and recently conducted meet
ings of a vice presidential committee which drew
up a proposed new constitution.
His running mate, VICTOR von SCHLEGELL,
20, is a member of SAE fraternity from Aurora,
Illinois. He is a junior psychology major and
was president of France XV.
Platform Statement
The ASSU has evolved from a harmless, but
meaningless, charade into a robust, hilarious
farce . . . the process has now reached its logi
cal conclusion.
The prevalent mood on this campus can be
summed up as: "The ASSU is already a joke;
so let's make it a real RF."
But the key issue in this campaign Is not the
ASSU.
The present ASSU must soon cease to exist.
Its death rattle is heard every other Thursday
night. The question is, What will replace it?
We want very badly to get rid of the present
ASSU, and we spent the last month helping to
design a new Constitution which does just that.
The proposed new structure can work at Stan
ford.
But the ASSU will never be evaluated in terms

of this Constitution. It will be judged on the
basis of how effectively it functions. The way for
student government to gain legitimacy at Stan
ford is for it to do something.
The following are some of the things we pro
pose to do. All of them have been extensively in
vestigated, and found feasible. We are already at
work on some of them.
1) Expand the advising program, filling the
present void with graduates and upper-division
students, along the lines of the Harvard tutorial
program.
2) Mobilize the necessary means to acquire the
old fire station for a student coffee house.
3) Coordinate the myriad student "action"
projects, both in the local community, and with
other universities.
4) Set up a concert series with a diversity of
performers.
5) Create a series of social, educational, and ath
letic activities which will bring graduates and
undergraduates into closer contact.
6) Supplementing classroom academics with
a comprehensive work-study program.
Among the long-range goals we advocate are:
1) Expansion of the Overseas Campus pro
gram into Japan, Africa, and Latin America.
2) The establishment of an optional six-year
undergraduate curriculum, with two years spent
outside the university.
The above suggestions may begin to fill the
gap which is now the ASSU. The new Constitu
tion provides the flexible structure necessary
for the coordination and implementation of any
other ad hoc endeavors. The present condition
of the ASSU can be drastically changed.

The prevalent mood on this campus can be
summed up as: "The ASSU is already a joke;
so let's make it a real RF."
But the key issue in this campaign Is not the
ASSU.
The present ASSU must soon cease to exist.
Its death rattle is heard every other Thursday
night. The question is, What will replace it?
We want very badly to get rid of the present
ASSU, and we spent the last month helping to
design a new Constitution which does just that.
The proposed new structure can work at Stan
ford.
But the ASSU will never be evaluated in terms

of this Constitution. It will be judged on the
basis of how effectively it functions. The way for
student government to gain legitimacy at Stan
ford is for it to do something.
The following are some of the things we pro
pose to do. All of them have been extensively in
vestigated, and found feasible. We are already at
work on some of them.
1) Expand the advising program, filling the
present void with graduates and upper-division
students, along the lines of the Harvard tutorial
program.
2) Mobilize the necessary means to acquire the
old fire station for a student coffee house.
3) Coordinate the myriad student "action"
projects, both in the local community, and with
other universities.
4) Set up a concert series with a diversity of
performers.
5) Create a series of social, educational, and ath
letic activities which will bring graduates and
undergraduates into closer contact.
6) Supplementing classroom academics with
a comprehensive work-study program.
Among the long-range goals we advocate are:
1) Expansion of the Overseas Campus pro
gram into Japan, Africa, and Latin America.
2) The establishment of an optional six-year
undergraduate curriculum, with two years spent
outside the university.
The above suggestions may begin to fill the
gap which is now the ASSU. The new Constitu
tion provides the flexible structure necessary
for the coordination and implementation of any
other ad hoc endeavors. The present condition
of the ASSU can be drastically changed.

Platform Statement
The ASSU has evolved from a harmless, but
meaningless, charade into a robust, hilarious
farce . . . the process has now reached its logi
