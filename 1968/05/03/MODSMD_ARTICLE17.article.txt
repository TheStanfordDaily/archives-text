# Hukari Denounces ASSU Failure In Representation, Communication
## 
### 
HARVEY H. HUKARI, JR., is a 21-yta. old senior from Menlo
Park. He transferred here from San Francisco State College in
his junior year. He lives in Grove house.
Hukari expects to graduate in June with a degree in political
science but will return to Stanford in the fall for graduate study
in communications.
At Stanford he has been active in the Young Republicans and
Young Americans for Freedom. He has written columns for the
Daily and the Ar^na.
His running mate, LARRY BIEHL, is a 22-year-old business grad
uate student from Chicago. He graduated from Stanford in his
tory and English literature.
As an undergraduate he was a member of the chorus and a
movie reviewer for the Daily.
Platform Statement
The growth and diversification of Stanford has outstripped stu
dent government. The minority problem here left student govern
ment gaping, because a small group of students, with grievances
which ASSU had done nothing to remedy, seized leadership of the
student body.
The responsiveness of private tutorial groups and University
sponsored programs (such as the Small Business class at the
Business School) are at this moment deeply engaged in rendering
aid to disadvantaged minorities in East Palo Alto, Mountain View,
and other neighboring cities. Yet where is ASSU?
A handful of activists, more interested in broadcasting a political
ideology than in solving pressing on campus and in the

immediate environment, has run student government in recent
years.
LASSU has done nothing more than pass resolutions and hand
out student body funds to its favorite causes, and recent ASSU
presidents have done little to redirect the resources of student gov
ernment.
Harvey H. Hukari and Larry Biehl seek to enhance diversity on
campus and to give representation to the whole student body rather
than a particular clique.
Their full positions are stated in position papers on housing, ed
ucation, minorities, and ASSU. Exceprts from these statements
follow:
1. Establishment of accredited and extra-curricula seminars to
deal with SPECIFIC Bay Area community problems.
2. ASSU support for 500 minority group admissions by 1970.
3. Power for ASSU president to appoint all student representa
tives on SES, Presidential committees, etc.
4. Phased withdrawal of student financial support from the
Stanford Dally. This proposal would eventually save the student
body $28,000 every year.
5. ASSU-financed and run coffee house.
Stanford is suffering from a breakdown in communications and
growing depersonalization, and ASSU's recent failure to represent
all Stanford students and to lead the fight for student rights is as
culpable as anything.
A vote for Hukari and Biehl is a vote for a change in the direction
of student government. HABVEY H. HUKARI, JB.
