Platform Statement
Most don't really understand
my campaign. They don't think
I'm serious. Hug Me, and Keep
Humor In Your Heart, Serious
ness In Your Bellybutton are
extremely sober. Nietzsche said,
" . . . we should call every truth
false which was not accompanied
by at least one laugh." Quick
laughter belies your underlying
sensitivity.
Please don't vote for me un
less you understand the serious
ness in my campaign slogans,

will demand your trust, support
and understanding.
If any words must be said,
let them be yours, and let you
verbalize your agony. It is high
time that the very agonies of our
times should become a medium
for the bringing of a real un
derstanding of human relation
ship.
Love Poem: Awaken student
body! Stanford is a huge pit of
bones, a grave of structured
size! Dead students still smile.
(Polyurethane.) Not bodily
death, Stanford royally attacks
the highest steaks: Successfully
shot Spirit to hell, (else the
grant might.)
Damn you students for not
telling anybody you are dead!
Damn you teachers for teach
ing a death of everlasting rest
lessness at 3:30 in the morning
with a sore throat.
And you teachers who worry
about all this. Thanks a lot. Be
happy!
Damn tests — you all know
they don't test anything, they
don't mean a thing, they are hell
to make suffering a pleasant ex
perience to gt out of. And dou
ble-A-damn you who like tests
— you bones — you can do it!
you can do it! What do you do?
At least dogs bite the hand
that feeds them.
Damn you Humanities people
who read so many words and
even memorize a few and damn
you, you confess words "I'm a
hypocrite" and you laugh cause

now it's all right.
God damn words! Almighty
hex! words used to be symbols
of reality; now they're it (poly
urethane). You touch, make love,
and get pregnant with words.
Lesser god damn for money.
Another symbol - reality. Lazy
asses sitting on a corrugated
dollar bill which consumes 47
times it excess weight in stom
ach lining.
(damn) I see the love in your
hate. Everytime you strike, if
only you could fondle . . . Stop
bastard-smiling. Love gives both
the good and the bad.
Damn makes you human.
You're lovable now.

that feeds them.
Damn you Humanities people
who read so many words and
even memorize a few and damn
you, you confess words "I'm a
hypocrite" and you laugh cause

now it's all right.
God damn words! Almighty
hex! words used to be symbols
of reality; now they're it (poly
urethane). You touch, make love,
and get pregnant with words.
Lesser god damn for money.
Another symbol - reality. Lazy
asses sitting on a corrugated
dollar bill which consumes 47
times it excess weight in stom
ach lining.
(damn) I see the love in your
hate. Everytime you strike, if
only you could fondle . . . Stop
bastard-smiling. Love gives both
the good and the bad.
Damn makes you human.
You're lovable now.

Platform Statement
Most don't really understand
my campaign. They don't think
I'm serious. Hug Me, and Keep
Humor In Your Heart, Serious
ness In Your Bellybutton are
extremely sober. Nietzsche said,
" . . . we should call every truth
false which was not accompanied
by at least one laugh." Quick
laughter belies your underlying
sensitivity.
Please don't vote for me un
less you understand the serious
ness in my campaign slogans,
for my actions as president
will demand your trust, support
and understanding.
If any words must be said,
let them be yours, and let you
verbalize your agony. It is high
time that the very agonies of our
times should become a medium
for the bringing of a real un
derstanding of human relation
ship.
Love Poem: Awaken student
body! Stanford is a huge pit of
bones, a grave of structured
size! Dead students still smile.
(Polyurethane.) Not bodily
death, Stanford royally attacks
the highest steaks: Successfully
shot Spirit to hell, (else the
grant might.)
Damn you students for not
telling anybody you are dead!
Damn you teachers for teach
ing a death of everlasting rest
lessness at 3:30 in the morning
with a sore throat.
And you teachers who worry
about all this. Thanks a lot. Be
happy!
Damn tests — you all know
they don't test anything, they
don't mean a thing, they are hell
to make suffering a pleasant ex
perience to gt out of. And dou
ble-A-damn you who like tests
— you bones — you can do it!
you can do it! What do you do?
At least dogs bite the hand
that feeds them.
Damn you Humanities people
who read so many words and
even memorize a few and damn
you, you confess words "I'm a
hypocrite" and you laugh cause

now it's all right.
God damn words! Almighty
