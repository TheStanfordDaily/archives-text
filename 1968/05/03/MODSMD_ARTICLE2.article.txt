# Second Transplant At Stanford Hospital
## 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON 
Stanford's second heart trans
plant patient is reported in fair
condition after undergoing the
four and a half hour operation
yesterday morning.
The recipient, Joseph Rizor, is
a 40-year old carpenter from
Salinas.
The operation was performed
by Dr. Norman E. Shumway of
the Stanford School of Medicine.
Dr. Shumway performed a sim
ilar transplant at Stanford last
January.
The patient is reported to be
breathing with the aid of a res
pirator. Rizor suffers from a
lung condition. Mike Kasperak,
Stanford's first heart transplant
patient also had a lung condi
tion, and it was one of the fac
tors leading to his death fifteen
days after he received the heart
of Virginia Mae White.
Rizor has suffered from
heart disease since 1961 and
has been in and out of Stan
ford Medical Center for the
Last two months. His new
heart Is from a 43-year-old
northern California man who
suffered from "irrepairable
brain damage." The donor's
family has asked that his
name remain anonymous.
Before the operation both the
donor and recipient were ex
amined by a committee of the
medical school and by outside
loctors. There has been some
criticism in the past of opera
tions being performed without
proper examination of the donor

and recipient. Apparently this
procedure was taken to forestall
such criticism.
Two kidneys were also re
moved from the donor and trans
planted into two other patients.
No information was released
about the kidney recipients.
The heart operation began
at 7:30 yesterday morning: and
finished at noon. In a change
from the first operation offici
als announced that an opera
tion was underway early in
the morning:. In January offici
als would not admit that any
operation was taking: place un
til after the operation was
completed.
In a statement released yes
terday, Mrs. Rizor said, "It
never entered my mind that Joe
would be selected for a heart
transplant. I remember his
commenting 'I wish that were
me,' following the first heart
transplant by Dr. Barnard in
South Africa."
"At first I was shocked by the
idea," she said, "but time and
the knowledge of how desper
ately my husband wanted to
undergo the operation have
made me realize that this may
be his only chance to live." The
Rizors have four children.
Mrs. Rizor has described her
htisband as "outgoing, active
and happy," though he has not
been well enough to work for
two years.
Dr. Shumway has stated
that he does not regard these
operations as therapy, saying:,

"heart transplantation can
not be termed therapy . . .
therefore the recipient must
be one whose death appears
imminent or whose life is so
unbearable that he qualifies
for this kind of clinical trial."
Dr. Shumway developed the
technique used in most of the
eight heart transplants to date.
A 45-year old professor of sur
gery, Shumway has been at
Stanford ten years and pioneer
ed in transplantation of hearts
in dogs as early as 1959. Shum
way is married and has four
children.
He first announced that he
was preparing for human heart
transplantations last November.
He had to wait, however, until
January before both a donor and
recipient were available. Since
the operation in January sev
eral potential recipients have
died because of a lack of don
ors.
Yesterday's operation was
the second transplant in less
than a week. A 66-yoar-old
Parisian underwent the opera
tion last Saturday but died
Tuesday from brain damage.
The only other living heart
transplant patient is Phillip
Blaiberg, a South African den
tist who underwent the opera
tion in January. He has been
released from the hospital and is
living at home. His doctor,
Christian Barnard, was in San
Francisco earlier this year
where he met briefly with Dr.
Shumway.
