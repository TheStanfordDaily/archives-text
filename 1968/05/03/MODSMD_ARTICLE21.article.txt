# Shurmann Judges Bombing Failure
## 
### 
Franz Shurman, one of the
nation's leading China scholars
gave his view of North Vietnam
in Room 214 last night. Shur
mann just arrived from North
Vietnam where he spent nine
teen days leaving Hanoi the
day after the assassination of
Martin Luther King.
Shurmann focused his atten
tion on the general conditions
in North Vietnam. He reported
how in spite of the fact that
the country "mounted the most
incredible resistance to a war"
the population looks "healthy,
properous and psychologically
normal."
According to Shurmann, North
Vietnam has followed three
principles in the resistance to
the air war: dispersal, exacua
tion, and decentralization. No
concentration of people or war
material is evident in North
Vietnam.
The cities have been exacu
ated. Even in Hanoi, all the large
buildings are empty. The city
has been "brought out to the
village."
The government expects the
complete destruction of Hanoi
and Haiphong, therefore the
population and th einstitutions
— such as the government and
the universities — are now scat
tered in straw huts all over the
country, according to Shur

mann.
The government has been
completely decentralized. Using
extraordinary systems of com
munications, the provincial gov
ernment travels constantly from
one village to another. There is
no centralized bureaucracy, nor
centralized orders, Schurmann
says.
Shurmann is convinced that
North Vietnam has won the war.
From his conversations with
leaders of North Vietnam and
of the NLF, he concludes that
the North Vietnamese are aware
of the fact that the American
troops will never be pushed out
by the Viet Cong. "To get rid
of them" it is necessary to hold
conversations with the Ameri
can government the North Viet
namese believe.
