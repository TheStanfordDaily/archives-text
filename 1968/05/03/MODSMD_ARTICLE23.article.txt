# Fraternity Relevance
## IFC Changing Role 
### MARGARET McGAUGHEY 
When someone mentions the
Inter â€¢ Fraternity Council (IFC),
most Stanford students think of
Greek Week and the IFC Ball.
That is probably all. According
to IFC president Mike Quinn,
however, IFC is making a con
certed effort to "make the fra
ternity system relevant to the
needs of the students."
IFC is a forum made up of
the presidents of each of Stan
ford's fraternities as well as an
elected representative of each
house.
Much of the organization's
work is done in committees. The
scholarship committee, for ex
ample, tries to find enough fac
ulty associates and resident as
sistants for fraternities that
want them, as well as helping to
set up house seminars. Not con
cerned with improving grade
point averages in individual
houses, the committee is trying
to more fully integrate fraternal
with academic life.
Closely associated with the

scholarship committee Is the
guest4n-residence committee.
In attempting to attract prom
inent figures to speak at and
visit individual fraternities
the committee has run into
problems of finances. The IFC
budget simply cannot afford
$2,000 to bring William Buck
ley here for a day, for example.
Although the committee was
successful in bringing former
Supreme Court Justice Tom
Clark as a guest-in-residence, it
has found it both less expensive
and more productive to work
with other campus organizations
in attracting noted speakers.
IFC indirectly sponsored Sen
ator Eugene McCarthy's visit
to Stanford this winter.
One of the better known
functions of IFC is its work with
Rush. In the past, a committee
has been formed each fall to
formulate policy for the coming
year. Under Quinn, however, an
effort is being made to convene
the committee at the end of
Rush each spring so that rush
problems can be worked out
sooner with the aid of newly
pledged freshmen.
Stanford sees Its fraternities
primarily as social organiza
tions, and IFC does not have
an active social committee.
Greek Week and the IFC Ball
have traditionally been big
events of winter quarter. This
year, however, IFC is trying to
change the emphasis of these
activities. Proceeds from the
IFC Ball at the San Franciscan
Hotel this year went toward a
$1,000 contribution IFC is mak
ing to the Haight-Ashbury Medi
cal Clinic.
Each year IFC finances the
delegates at the Western re
gional IFC convention in Lori
Angeles and the national con
vention in New York. Quinn
confesses that the delegates
get little out of these confer
ences except personal contacts.
Quinn says, however, that
meeting with IFC heads of other
universities has shown him that
Stanford's fraternity system is
becoming something unique. The
decreased emphasis on rituals
and national policy, as well as
the disaffiliation of Sigma Chi,
ATO, Beta Chi, and Lambda Nu
from their nationals indicates
the Stanford fraternities in

creasingly favor autonomy of
local chapters as they are more
relevant to individual needs.
Says Quinn, "People here are
so busy getting an education
that there is not time for the
same kind of concern with na
tionals and rituals."
Member fraternities seem to
think IFC could be improved.
Monty Orr, a Beta Theta Pi, sees
the IFC's present function as "a
sounding board to which all fra
ternities can come and speak
about the things they have in
common." In that the fraterni
ties are not a homogeneous
group, Orr feels IFC "affords
a valuable conflict of views."
In its attempt to Integrate the
fraternities with university life,
however, Orr feels IFC has fail
ed. Virtually the only contact
the university has with frater
nities as a group is Greek Week
and the IFC Ball. "There was a
time," Orr says, "when the rah
rah, beer-guzzling, Greek Week
bit appealed to people, but not
any more."
Orr would like to see Greek,
Week and the IFC Ball abol
ished, and have the Council
concentrate on integration
with the academic community.
Another fraternity man sees
IFC as "a body of tremendous
potential and great resources
which can be mobilized toward
any purpose it chooses to define,"
but which seems now to be
"oriented toward inaction."
He feels IFC is moving in a
healthy direction with its guest
in-residence program and its de
cision to make fraternity parti
cipation in Greek Week option
al, but is disappointed that IFC
has not succeeded in directing
its members toward a joint
effort of social projects outside
the university.
Many fraternities feel that
IFC is potentially a very useful
instrument. The problem seems
to be how to make the most
of it. Says Quinn: "The biggest
disappointment for me this year
has been the failure to use IFC.
It's like saying that Christian
ity is a good thing, but it's nev
er been tried. IFC has never
been approached by people with
ideas that can be shared by all
fraternity men. It should be
used as a forum for the ideas of
all its members."
