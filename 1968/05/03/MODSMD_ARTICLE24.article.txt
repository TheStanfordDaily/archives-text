# Peace Party Backs Lower Voting Age
## 
### 
The statewide Peace and Free
dom Movement is presently
sponsoring an initiative consti
tutional amendment to lower
the California minimum voting
age to 18.
In order to place this initia
tive on the November '68 ballot,
600,000 signatures of registered
voters are needed by June 4.
With people working in al
most every county of the state,
the Peace and Freedom Move
ment is aiming for a total of
one million signatures.
According to Karl and Janet
Simpson, campus organizers of
the initiative drive, support from
the Stanford community is cru
cial to achievement of Santa
Clara County's projected goal of
40,000 signatures. They hope
that a high percentage of Stan
ford student-faculty-staff signa
tures will give impetus to the
final countywide push planned
for late May.
Simpson stated "The 18-year
old vote is kind of like the end
of colonialism. Everyone is so
content to sing its praises, they
conveniently forget that the
song hasn't been written yet.
The issue hasn't generated much
excitement in the past. We need

excitement.
"The initiative would transfer
real electoral power to the col
lege age (and draft age) popu
lation, which is critical to radi
calization of the voting popu
lace."
There will be a meeting May
7th in room 1-A, Inner Quad, for
any interested faculty, staff or
students.
