Several good films highlight a rather mediocre Holloywood se
lection of cinema. Madera House, Wilbur Hall, continues its out
standing Saturday evening series (8 and 10 p.m.) with the Bay
Area premiere of Carlos Saura's film The Hunt. The movie is
set in post-civil war Spain, and deals with three war veterans, now
hunters, who through the vehicle of the hunt symbolicly re-enact
the war. Admission is free to this outstanding film, an appropriate
sequel to To Die in Madrid.
Also local is OPEN CITY, directed by Rossellini with a screen
play by Fellini. CITY will be at Tresidder Friday evening (7:30,
8:30 and 9:30). This was the first important film to come out of
post-war Italy, and it set the trend for other films of the Italian
realism genre.
Sunday the flicks is presenting Zorba the Greek.
There are several films worth mentioning in the area. Closely
Watched Trains, a very good Czech film dealing with adolescent
love, is at the Guild Theatre. Also worth seeing is Ulysses, now at
the Paris. Beware The Fox! Despite a fine performance by Sandy
Dennis this film fails miserably; The Fox . . . symbol of Hollywood.
The move is done with typical Hoolywood beauty, insensitivity
(to D. H. Lawrence) and unsubtlty.
Appearing at the Filmore this weekend are Moby Grape, Hour
Glass and the United States of America. Country Joe and the Fish
will replace the Grape on Friday only. Junior Wells and Canned
Heat will be at the Avalon.
This weekend ACT if. presenting six plays. Friday at 8:30 the
Crucible will be at the Geary, and Don't Shoot Mable at the Ma
rine's Memorial Theatre. Our Town will be presented Saturday at
thee Gory, while Charley's Aunt is at the Marine's. Hamlet will be
performed Sunday afternoon, 2 p.m. at the Geary and again at 7:30,
while A Delicate Balance will start at the same time at the Marine's
(7:30 only for Balance).
