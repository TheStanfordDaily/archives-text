# Columbia Clash
## Students Versus Police 
### A.M. ROSENTHAL Copyright by The New York Times 
NEW YORK (May 1, 1968) —
It was 4:30 in the morning and
the president of the university
leaned against the wall of the
room that had been his office. He
passed a hand over his face.
"My God ,"he said, "how could
human beings do a thing like
this?"
For four hours Grayson Kirk
had heard the sound of Colum
bia in chaos — the police sirens,
the smashing of glass, the
chants of "Kirk must go," the
shrieked obscenities.
Now the campus was quiet
except for the taunts and shouts
of the arrested students wait
ing to be taken away in the
paddy wagons. They did not
reach the room in which Dr.
Kirk stood.
He wandered about the room.
It was almost empty of furni
ture. The desks and chairs had
been smashed, broken and shov
ed into adjoining rooms by the
occupying students, who had just
been led down the stairs, man
acled and whistling "We Shall
Overcome."
Dr. Kirk picked his way slow
ly among the dirty blankets,
half-eaten sandwiches, comic
books and tin cans on his spat
tered green rug. He looked
around for some of his memen
toes.
"I think I found one," he said.
"An ashtray."
He was still neat and dap
per but his face was gray and
he seemed to move and walk
In a trance. So did almost
everybody in the room. A po
liceman picked up a book on
the floor and said: "The whole
world is In these books; how
could they do this to these
books?" and put it down.
Dr. David Truman, vice pres
ident of the university, was
there, too, exhaustion on his
face. He wandered through the
suite, back and forth from
wrecked room to wrecked room
and at one point he said, almost

to himself, "Do you think they
will know why we had to do
this, to call in the police? Will
they know what went through
before we decided?"
A police inspector strolled
over to Dr. Kirk and silently
showed him something he had
just picked up from the floor
that a student had left behind
— a piece of iron pipe tied to
a bit of rope. "What is it?" Dr.
Kirk asked. The inspector look
ed surprised.
"A knuckle duster," he said.
"Unbelievable," Dr. Kirk said.
Somehow the whole night
seemed unbelievable, a mixture
of moods that seemed to have
no relationship to each other;
violence and compassion, talk
of hatred and death and talk of
gentle philosophites, ugliness of
action and of speech, and mo
ments of tenderness, a place
of learning become a place of
destruction.
"Columbia is finished," a stu
dent said as he heard the
smashing of glass in the}
Mathematics Building.
"It isn't, it isn't," the girl next
to him said. "Please, please,"
she was weeping. The boy walk
ed away and the girl stayed
and for a long time she cried,
standing in the dark.
Most of the university was
dark. Lights showed from a
lamppost here and there but
they seemed somehow just to
accentuate the grayness of the
campus rather than brighten it.
Everybody moved in shadows,
alone or in groups running
from building to building to try
to put their bodies between the
police and the doors, or just to
watch and see what was hap
pening to Columbia.
There was, at times, a sense
of almost being smothered in
a stream of obscenity. It was
not casual obscenity that came
from angry students, but hard,
cold and directed at target — a
policeman, a newspaperman, a
stranger, and most particularly
at anybody older.
Three middle-aged men were

standing near Hamilton Hall,
just beyond the fringe of th?
crowd. A young man walked
by, stopped, peered in the
gloom and screamed in a voice
strangled with fury:
"I hope you old . . . die! I
hope all you old . . . die. Go
ahead and watch us and die?"
And then, a few paces away
and a few moments later, a
young woman, hardly older than
the young man but with a white
armband worn by faculty mem
bers, spoke softly and kindly
to the same men and told them
how she certainly did not ap
prove of occupation of the build
ings by the students but said
that the administration had
handled it all wrong and that
at least the boys and girls of
the building had made Colum
bit awake to what they felt in
their souls.
One o'f the men asked her
then if she would go out with
a "colored man." The young in
structor said that she certainly
might but somehow she indi
cated that that did not seem to
be exactly to the point.
Some of the students outside
the buildings seemed seized with
a kind of nervous exhilaration.
They leaped up and down,
laughed and one boy shouted
"go it bear, go it man."
There were others who al
most trembled with fear, not
so much for themselves but at
what they were seeing on their
campus.
There were students who
flung themselves passionately
into danger, rushing past po
licemen to guard the doors
with their bodies. And there/
were a few students who con
centrate, quite coolly, at urg
ing others into danger.
A line of silent policemen was
drawn up at the far edge of the
lawn in front of the Mathematics
Building, keeping the crowd
well away from the doors. A
few hundred students stood be
hind a hedge, a dozen feet away
from the police. One young man
stepped over the hedge and kept
shouting: "Come on, step over,
join us, move up."
Some of the youngsters did
and moved up to the police
line. The young barker stood

back, well away from any po
liceman's reach and kept up his
pitch.
There was, on the campus,
really only two groups of par
ticipants throughout the long
night, who seemed to be in any
relationship to each other and
to have any significance — the
students and the police. There
were faculty members with
their armbands who rushed
from group to group, there
were observers from Mayor
Lindsay's office, there were re
porters and cameramen but few
seemed to have any real role
at all.
Almost nobody left the cam
pus and there were moments
when there was a sense of the
curtain going up — and of an
ticipation.
When the police arrived,
marching in formation from
various parts of the campus,
a couple of hundred students
formed a kind of barricade in
front of the police command
post, a series of rooms on thej
first floor of a wing in Low.
The police let them stay for
a long time just keeping
enough room for policemen to
come and go.
Around the campus there were
were a few policemen and plain
clothesmen who delivered them
selves, to each other, of four
letter opinions of some of the
students but for the most part
the police were silent through
out the evening. Some of them
seemed almost fond, in a profes
sional way, of the students.
"Pretty good crowd," said one
officer strolling about the cam
pus. "A little singing, a little
moving, that's all right. Not
much running, that would be
bad, running. Not too hard to
handle."

But in other parts of the cam
pus there were students with
bloody heads. And for every
student with a bloody head
there were 50 who saw him and
were filled with a sense of hor
ror.
Whatever the degree of harsh
force that grew out of the po
lice's order to clear the build
ings of students, there was no
sense of satisfaction in the
command post.
Police Commissioner How*
ard R. Leary moved among
his senior officers, received re
ports of the progress of the
clearing process, but nobody
talked of triumph or victory,
but just of a quite nasty job.
The Commissioner left Low
about 5 a.m. The patrol wag
ons were drawn up in front of
the building and from behind
the steel mesh students inside
taunted the few adults on the
steps.
"Is this what your parents
slaved and worked for to send
you to college, so you could
break up the university," one
of the adults, who had walked
onto the campus, screamed at
the boy, moving toward him.
"Leave him alone," said the
Commissioner, "leave hi m
alone."
That was about 5 o'clock in
the morning. The students had
been pushed out of the campus
onto Broadway. They stayed
for hours and so did Grayson
Kirk, in his office one flight
up in Low.

most trembled with fear, not
so much for themselves but at
what they were seeing on their
campus.
There were students who
flung themselves passionately
into danger, rushing past po
licemen to guard the doors
with their bodies. And there/
were a few students who con
centrate, quite coolly, at urg
ing others into danger.
A line of silent policemen was
drawn up at the far edge of the
lawn in front of the Mathematics
Building, keeping the crowd
well away from the doors. A
few hundred students stood be
hind a hedge, a dozen feet away
from the police. One young man
stepped over the hedge and kept
shouting: "Come on, step over,
join us, move up."
Some of the youngsters did
and moved up to the police
line. The young barker stood

back, well away from any po
liceman's reach and kept up his
pitch.
There was, on the campus,
really only two groups of par
ticipants throughout the long
night, who seemed to be in any
relationship to each other and
to have any significance — the
students and the police. There
were faculty members with
their armbands who rushed
from group to group, there
were observers from Mayor
Lindsay's office, there were re
porters and cameramen but few
seemed to have any real role
at all.
Almost nobody left the cam
pus and there were moments
when there was a sense of the
curtain going up — and of an
ticipation.
When the police arrived,
marching in formation from
various parts of the campus,
a couple of hundred students
formed a kind of barricade in
front of the police command
post, a series of rooms on thej
first floor of a wing in Low.
The police let them stay for
a long time just keeping
enough room for policemen to
come and go.
Around the campus there were
were a few policemen and plain
clothesmen who delivered them
selves, to each other, of four
letter opinions of some of the
students but for the most part
the police were silent through
out the evening. Some of them
seemed almost fond, in a profes
sional way, of the students.
"Pretty good crowd," said one
officer strolling about the cam
pus. "A little singing, a little
moving, that's all right. Not
much running, that would be
bad, running. Not too hard to
handle."

But in other parts of the cam
pus there were students with
bloody heads. And for every
student with a bloody head
there were 50 who saw him and
were filled with a sense of hor
ror.
Whatever the degree of harsh
force that grew out of the po
lice's order to clear the build
ings of students, there was no
sense of satisfaction in the
command post.
Police Commissioner How*
ard R. Leary moved among
his senior officers, received re
ports of the progress of the
clearing process, but nobody
talked of triumph or victory,
but just of a quite nasty job.
The Commissioner left Low
about 5 a.m. The patrol wag
ons were drawn up in front of
the building and from behind
the steel mesh students inside
taunted the few adults on the
steps.
"Is this what your parents
slaved and worked for to send
you to college, so you could
break up the university," one
of the adults, who had walked
onto the campus, screamed at
the boy, moving toward him.
"Leave him alone," said the
Commissioner, "leave hi m
alone."
That was about 5 o'clock in
the morning. The students had
been pushed out of the campus
onto Broadway. They stayed
for hours and so did Grayson
Kirk, in his office one flight
up in Low.
NEW YORK (May 1, 1968) —
It was 4:30 in the morning and
the president of the university
leaned against the wall of the
room that had been his office. He
passed a hand over his face.
"My God ,"he said, "how could
human beings do a thing like
this?"
For four hours Grayson Kirk
had heard the sound of Colum
bia in chaos — the police sirens,
the smashing of glass, the
chants of "Kirk must go," the
shrieked obscenities.
Now the campus was quiet
except for the taunts and shouts
of the arrested students wait
ing to be taken away in the
paddy wagons. They did not
reach the room in which Dr.
Kirk stood.
He wandered about the room.
It was almost empty of furni
ture. The desks and chairs had
been smashed, broken and shov
ed into adjoining rooms by the
occupying students, who had just
been led down the stairs, man
acled and whistling "We Shall
Overcome."
Dr. Kirk picked his way slow
ly among the dirty blankets,
half-eaten sandwiches, comic
books and tin cans on his spat
tered green rug. He looked
around for some of his memen
toes.
"I think I found one," he said.
"An ashtray."
He was still neat and dap
per but his face was gray and
he seemed to move and walk
In a trance. So did almost
everybody in the room. A po
liceman picked up a book on
the floor and said: "The whole
world is In these books; how
could they do this to these
books?" and put it down.
Dr. David Truman, vice pres
ident of the university, was
there, too, exhaustion on his
face. He wandered through the
suite, back and forth from
wrecked room to wrecked room
and at one point he said, almost

to himself, "Do you think they
will know why we had to do
this, to call in the police? Will
they know what went through
before we decided?"
A police inspector strolled
over to Dr. Kirk and silently
showed him something he had
just picked up from the floor
that a student had left behind
— a piece of iron pipe tied to
a bit of rope. "What is it?" Dr.
Kirk asked. The inspector look
ed surprised.
"A knuckle duster," he said.
"Unbelievable," Dr. Kirk said.
Somehow the whole night
seemed unbelievable, a mixture
of moods that seemed to have
no relationship to each other;
violence and compassion, talk
of hatred and death and talk of
gentle philosophites, ugliness of
action and of speech, and mo
ments of tenderness, a place
of learning become a place of
destruction.
"Columbia is finished," a stu
dent said as he heard the
smashing of glass in the}
Mathematics Building.
"It isn't, it isn't," the girl next
to him said. "Please, please,"
she was weeping. The boy walk
ed away and the girl stayed
and for a long time she cried,
standing in the dark.
Most of the university was
dark. Lights showed from a
lamppost here and there but
they seemed somehow just to
accentuate the grayness of the
campus rather than brighten it.
Everybody moved in shadows,
alone or in groups running
from building to building to try
to put their bodies between the
police and the doors, or just to
watch and see what was hap
pening to Columbia.
There was, at times, a sense
of almost being smothered in
a stream of obscenity. It was
not casual obscenity that came
from angry students, but hard,
cold and directed at target — a
policeman, a newspaperman, a
stranger, and most particularly
at anybody older.
Three middle-aged men were

standing near Hamilton Hall,
just beyond the fringe of th?
crowd. A young man walked
by, stopped, peered in the
gloom and screamed in a voice
strangled with fury:
"I hope you old . . . die! I
hope all you old . . . die. Go
ahead and watch us and die?"
And then, a few paces away
and a few moments later, a
young woman, hardly older than
the young man but with a white
armband worn by faculty mem
bers, spoke softly and kindly
to the same men and told them
how she certainly did not ap
prove of occupation of the build
ings by the students but said
that the administration had
handled it all wrong and that
at least the boys and girls of
the building had made Colum
bit awake to what they felt in
their souls.
One o'f the men asked her
then if she would go out with
a "colored man." The young in
structor said that she certainly
might but somehow she indi
cated that that did not seem to
be exactly to the point.
Some of the students outside
the buildings seemed seized with
a kind of nervous exhilaration.
They leaped up and down,
laughed and one boy shouted
"go it bear, go it man."
There were others who al
most trembled with fear, not
so much for themselves but at
what they were seeing on their
campus.

per but his face was gray and
he seemed to move and walk
In a trance. So did almost
everybody in the room. A po
liceman picked up a book on
the floor and said: "The whole
world is In these books; how
could they do this to these
books?" and put it down.
Dr. David Truman, vice pres
ident of the university, was
there, too, exhaustion on his
face. He wandered through the
suite, back and forth from
wrecked room to wrecked room
and at one point he said, almost

to himself, "Do you think they
will know why we had to do
this, to call in the police? Will
they know what went through
before we decided?"
A police inspector strolled
over to Dr. Kirk and silently
showed him something he had
just picked up from the floor
that a student had left behind
— a piece of iron pipe tied to
a bit of rope. "What is it?" Dr.
Kirk asked. The inspector look
ed surprised.
"A knuckle duster," he said.
"Unbelievable," Dr. Kirk said.
Somehow the whole night
seemed unbelievable, a mixture
of moods that seemed to have
no relationship to each other;
violence and compassion, talk
of hatred and death and talk of
gentle philosophites, ugliness of
action and of speech, and mo
ments of tenderness, a place
of learning become a place of
destruction.
"Columbia is finished," a stu
dent said as he heard the
smashing of glass in the}
Mathematics Building.
"It isn't, it isn't," the girl next
to him said. "Please, please,"
she was weeping. The boy walk
ed away and the girl stayed
and for a long time she cried,
standing in the dark.
Most of the university was
dark. Lights showed from a
lamppost here and there but
they seemed somehow just to
accentuate the grayness of the
campus rather than brighten it.
Everybody moved in shadows,
alone or in groups running
from building to building to try
to put their bodies between the
police and the doors, or just to
watch and see what was hap
pening to Columbia.
There was, at times, a sense
of almost being smothered in
a stream of obscenity. It was
not casual obscenity that came
from angry students, but hard,
cold and directed at target — a
policeman, a newspaperman, a
stranger, and most particularly
at anybody older.
Three middle-aged men were

standing near Hamilton Hall,
just beyond the fringe of th?
crowd. A young man walked
by, stopped, peered in the
gloom and screamed in a voice
strangled with fury:
"I hope you old . . . die! I
hope all you old . . . die. Go
ahead and watch us and die?"
And then, a few paces away
and a few moments later, a
young woman, hardly older than
the young man but with a white
armband worn by faculty mem
bers, spoke softly and kindly
to the same men and told them
how she certainly did not ap
prove of occupation of the build
ings by the students but said
that the administration had
handled it all wrong and that
at least the boys and girls of
the building had made Colum
bit awake to what they felt in
their souls.
One o'f the men asked her
then if she would go out with
a "colored man." The young in
structor said that she certainly
might but somehow she indi
cated that that did not seem to
be exactly to the point.
Some of the students outside
the buildings seemed seized with
a kind of nervous exhilaration.
They leaped up and down,
laughed and one boy shouted
"go it bear, go it man."
There were others who al
most trembled with fear, not
so much for themselves but at
what they were seeing on their
campus.
There were students who
flung themselves passionately
into danger, rushing past po
licemen to guard the doors
with their bodies. And there/
were a few students who con
centrate, quite coolly, at urg
ing others into danger.
A line of silent policemen was
drawn up at the far edge of the
lawn in front of the Mathematics
Building, keeping the crowd
well away from the doors. A
few hundred students stood be
hind a hedge, a dozen feet away
from the police. One young man
stepped over the hedge and kept
shouting: "Come on, step over,
join us, move up."
Some of the youngsters did
and moved up to the police
line. The young barker stood

back, well away from any po
liceman's reach and kept up his
pitch.
There was, on the campus,
really only two groups of par
ticipants throughout the long
night, who seemed to be in any
relationship to each other and
to have any significance — the
students and the police. There
were faculty members with
their armbands who rushed
from group to group, there
were observers from Mayor
Lindsay's office, there were re
porters and cameramen but few
seemed to have any real role
at all.
Almost nobody left the cam
pus and there were moments
when there was a sense of the
curtain going up — and of an
ticipation.
When the police arrived,
marching in formation from
various parts of the campus,
a couple of hundred students
formed a kind of barricade in
front of the police command
post, a series of rooms on thej
first floor of a wing in Low.
The police let them stay for
a long time just keeping
enough room for policemen to
come and go.
Around the campus there were
were a few policemen and plain
clothesmen who delivered them
selves, to each other, of four
letter opinions of some of the
students but for the most part
the police were silent through
out the evening. Some of them
seemed almost fond, in a profes
sional way, of the students.
"Pretty good crowd," said one
officer strolling about the cam
pus. "A little singing, a little
moving, that's all right. Not
much running, that would be
bad, running. Not too hard to
handle."

But in other parts of the cam
pus there were students with
bloody heads. And for every
student with a bloody head
there were 50 who saw him and
were filled with a sense of hor
ror.
Whatever the degree of harsh
force that grew out of the po
lice's order to clear the build
ings of students, there was no
sense of satisfaction in the
command post.
Police Commissioner How*
ard R. Leary moved among
his senior officers, received re
ports of the progress of the
clearing process, but nobody
talked of triumph or victory,
but just of a quite nasty job.
The Commissioner left Low
about 5 a.m. The patrol wag
ons were drawn up in front of
the building and from behind
the steel mesh students inside
taunted the few adults on the
steps.
"Is this what your parents
slaved and worked for to send
you to college, so you could
break up the university," one
of the adults, who had walked
onto the campus, screamed at
the boy, moving toward him.
"Leave him alone," said the
Commissioner, "leave hi m
alone."
That was about 5 o'clock in
the morning. The students had
been pushed out of the campus
onto Broadway. They stayed
for hours and so did Grayson
Kirk, in his office one flight
up in Low.
NEW YORK (May 1, 1968) —
It was 4:30 in the morning and
the president of the university
leaned against the wall of the
room that had been his office. He
passed a hand over his face.
"My God ,"he said, "how could
human beings do a thing like
this?"
For four hours Grayson Kirk
had heard the sound of Colum
bia in chaos — the police sirens,
the smashing of glass, the
chants of "Kirk must go," the
shrieked obscenities.
Now the campus was quiet
except for the taunts and shouts
of the arrested students wait
ing to be taken away in the
paddy wagons. They did not
reach the room in which Dr.
Kirk stood.
He wandered about the room.
It was almost empty of furni
ture. The desks and chairs had
been smashed, broken and shov
ed into adjoining rooms by the
occupying students, who had just
been led down the stairs, man
acled and whistling "We Shall
Overcome."
Dr. Kirk picked his way slow
ly among the dirty blankets,
half-eaten sandwiches, comic
books and tin cans on his spat
tered green rug. He looked
around for some of his memen
toes.
"I think I found one," he said.
"An ashtray."
He was still neat and dap

he seemed to move and walk

when there was a sense of the
curtain going up — and of an
ticipation.
When the police arrived,
marching in formation from
various parts of the campus,
a couple of hundred students
formed a kind of barricade in
front of the police command
post, a series of rooms on thej
first floor of a wing in Low.
The police let them stay for
a long time just keeping
enough room for policemen to
come and go.
Around the campus there were
were a few policemen and plain
clothesmen who delivered them
selves, to each other, of four
letter opinions of some of the
students but for the most part
the police were silent through
out the evening. Some of them
seemed almost fond, in a profes
sional way, of the students.
"Pretty good crowd," said one
officer strolling about the cam
pus. "A little singing, a little
moving, that's all right. Not
much running, that would be
bad, running. Not too hard to
handle."

But in other parts of the cam
pus there were students with
bloody heads. And for every
student with a bloody head
there were 50 who saw him and
were filled with a sense of hor
ror.
Whatever the degree of harsh
force that grew out of the po
lice's order to clear the build
ings of students, there was no
sense of satisfaction in the
command post.
Police Commissioner How*
ard R. Leary moved among
his senior officers, received re
ports of the progress of the
clearing process, but nobody
talked of triumph or victory,
but just of a quite nasty job.
The Commissioner left Low
about 5 a.m. The patrol wag
ons were drawn up in front of
the building and from behind
the steel mesh students inside
taunted the few adults on the
steps.
"Is this what your parents
slaved and worked for to send
you to college, so you could
break up the university," one
of the adults, who had walked
onto the campus, screamed at
the boy, moving toward him.
"Leave him alone," said the
Commissioner, "leave hi m
alone."
That was about 5 o'clock in
the morning. The students had
been pushed out of the campus
onto Broadway. They stayed
for hours and so did Grayson
Kirk, in his office one flight
up in Low.
NEW YORK (May 1, 1968) —
It was 4:30 in the morning and
the president of the university
leaned against the wall of the
room that had been his office. He
passed a hand over his face.
"My God ,"he said, "how could
human beings do a thing like
this?"
For four hours Grayson Kirk
had heard the sound of Colum
bia in chaos — the police sirens,
the smashing of glass, the
chants of "Kirk must go," the
shrieked obscenities.
Now the campus was quiet
except for the taunts and shouts
of the arrested students wait
ing to be taken away in the
paddy wagons. They did not
reach the room in which Dr.
Kirk stood.
He wandered about the room.
It was almost empty of furni
ture. The desks and chairs had
been smashed, broken and shov
ed into adjoining rooms by the
occupying students, who had just
been led down the stairs, man
acled and whistling "We Shall
Overcome."
Dr. Kirk picked his way slow
ly among the dirty blankets,
half-eaten sandwiches, comic
books and tin cans on his spat
tered green rug. He looked
around for some of his memen
toes.
"I think I found one," he said.
"An ashtray."
He was still neat and dap
per but his face was gray and
he seemed to move and walk
In a trance. So did almost
everybody in the room. A po
liceman picked up a book on
the floor and said: "The whole
world is In these books; how
could they do this to these
books?" and put it down.
Dr. David Truman, vice pres
ident of the university, was
there, too, exhaustion on his
face. He wandered through the
suite, back and forth from
wrecked room to wrecked room
and at one point he said, almost

to himself, "Do you think they
will know why we had to do
this, to call in the police? Will
they know what went through
before we decided?"
A police inspector strolled
over to Dr. Kirk and silently
showed him something he had
just picked up from the floor
that a student had left behind
— a piece of iron pipe tied to
a bit of rope. "What is it?" Dr.
Kirk asked. The inspector look
ed surprised.
"A knuckle duster," he said.
"Unbelievable," Dr. Kirk said.
Somehow the whole night
seemed unbelievable, a mixture
of moods that seemed to have
no relationship to each other;
violence and compassion, talk
of hatred and death and talk of
gentle philosophites, ugliness of
action and of speech, and mo
ments of tenderness, a place
of learning become a place of
destruction.
"Columbia is finished," a stu
dent said as he heard the
smashing of glass in the}
Mathematics Building.
"It isn't, it isn't," the girl next
to him said. "Please, please,"
she was weeping. The boy walk
ed away and the girl stayed
and for a long time she cried,
standing in the dark.
Most of the university was
dark. Lights showed from a
lamppost here and there but
they seemed somehow just to
accentuate the grayness of the
campus rather than brighten it.
Everybody moved in shadows,
alone or in groups running
from building to building to try
to put their bodies between the
police and the doors, or just to
watch and see what was hap
pening to Columbia.
There was, at times, a sense
of almost being smothered in
a stream of obscenity. It was
not casual obscenity that came
from angry students, but hard,
cold and directed at target — a
policeman, a newspaperman, a
stranger, and most particularly
at anybody older.
Three middle-aged men were

standing near Hamilton Hall,
just beyond the fringe of th?
crowd. A young man walked
by, stopped, peered in the
gloom and screamed in a voice
strangled with fury:
"I hope you old . . . die! I
hope all you old . . . die. Go
ahead and watch us and die?"
And then, a few paces away
and a few moments later, a
young woman, hardly older than
the young man but with a white
armband worn by faculty mem
bers, spoke softly and kindly
to the same men and told them
how she certainly did not ap
prove of occupation of the build
ings by the students but said
that the administration had
handled it all wrong and that
at least the boys and girls of
the building had made Colum
bit awake to what they felt in
their souls.
One o'f the men asked her
then if she would go out with
a "colored man." The young in
structor said that she certainly
might but somehow she indi
cated that that did not seem to
be exactly to the point.
Some of the students outside
the buildings seemed seized with
a kind of nervous exhilaration.
They leaped up and down,
laughed and one boy shouted
"go it bear, go it man."
There were others who al
most trembled with fear, not
so much for themselves but at
what they were seeing on their
campus.
There were students who
flung themselves passionately
into danger, rushing past po
licemen to guard the doors
with their bodies. And there/
were a few students who con
centrate, quite coolly, at urg
ing others into danger.
A line of silent policemen was
drawn up at the far edge of the
lawn in front of the Mathematics
Building, keeping the crowd
well away from the doors. A
few hundred students stood be
hind a hedge, a dozen feet away
from the police. One young man
stepped over the hedge and kept
shouting: "Come on, step over,
join us, move up."
Some of the youngsters did
and moved up to the police
line. The young barker stood

back, well away from any po
liceman's reach and kept up his
pitch.
There was, on the campus,
really only two groups of par
ticipants throughout the long
night, who seemed to be in any
relationship to each other and
to have any significance — the
students and the police. There
were faculty members with
their armbands who rushed
from group to group, there
were observers from Mayor
Lindsay's office, there were re
porters and cameramen but few
seemed to have any real role
at all.
Almost nobody left the cam

when there was a sense of the
curtain going up — and of an
