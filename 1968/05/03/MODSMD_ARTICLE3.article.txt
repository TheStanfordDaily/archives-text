# Columbia Clash
## Students Versus Police 
### A.M. ROSENTHAL Copyright by The New York Times 
NEW YORK (May 1, 1968) —
It was 4:30 in the morning and
the president of the university
leaned against the wall of the
room that had been his office. He
passed a hand over his face.
"My God ,"he said, "how could
human beings do a thing like
this?"
For four hours Grayson Kirk
had heard the sound of Colum
bia in chaos — the police sirens,
the smashing of glass, the
chants of "Kirk must go," the
shrieked obscenities.
Now the campus was quiet
except for the taunts and shouts
of the arrested students wait
ing to be taken away in the
paddy wagons. They did not
reach the room in which Dr.
Kirk stood.
He wandered about the room.
It was almost empty of furni
ture. The desks and chairs had
been smashed, broken and shov
ed into adjoining rooms by the
occupying students, who had just
been led down the stairs, man
acled and whistling "We Shall
Overcome."
Dr. Kirk picked his way slow
ly among the dirty blankets,
half-eaten sandwiches, comic
books and tin cans on his spat
tered green rug. He looked
around for some of his memen
toes.
"I think I found one," he said.
"An ashtray."
He was still neat and dap
per but his face was gray and
he seemed to move and walk
In a trance. So did almost
everybody in the room. A po
liceman picked up a book on
the floor and said: "The whole
world is In these books; how
could they do this to these
books?" and put it down.
Dr. David Truman, vice pres
ident of the university, was
there, too, exhaustion on his
face. He wandered through the
suite, back and forth from
wrecked room to wrecked room
and at one point he said, almost

to himself, "Do you think they
will know why we had to do
this, to call in the police? Will
they know what went through
before we decided?"
A police inspector strolled
over to Dr. Kirk and silently
showed him something he had
just picked up from the floor
that a student had left behind
— a piece of iron pipe tied to
a bit of rope. "What is it?" Dr.
Kirk asked. The inspector look
ed surprised.
"A knuckle duster," he said.
"Unbelievable," Dr. Kirk said.
Somehow the whole night
seemed unbelievable, a mixture
of moods that seemed to have
no relationship to each other;
violence and compassion, talk
of hatred and death and talk of
gentle philosophites, ugliness of
action and of speech, and mo
ments of tenderness, a place
of learning become a place of
destruction.
"Columbia is finished," a stu
dent said as he heard the
smashing of glass in the}
Mathematics Building.
"It isn't, it isn't," the girl next
to him said. "Please, please,"
she was weeping. The boy walk
ed away and the girl stayed
and for a long time she cried,
standing in the dark.
Most of the university was
dark. Lights showed from a
lamppost here and there but
they seemed somehow just to
accentuate the grayness of the
campus rather than brighten it.
Everybody moved in shadows,
alone or in groups running
from building to building to try
to put their bodies between the
police and the doors, or just to
watch and see what was hap
pening to Columbia.
There was, at times, a sense
of almost being smothered in
a stream of obscenity. It was
not casual obscenity that came
from angry students, but hard,
cold and directed at target — a
policeman, a newspaperman, a
stranger, and most particularly
at anybody older.
Three middle-aged men were

standing near Hamilton Hall,
just beyond the fringe of th?
crowd. A young man walked
by, stopped, peered in the
gloom and screamed in a voice
strangled with fury:
"I hope you old . . . die! I
hope all you old . . . die. Go
ahead and watch us and die?"
And then, a few paces away
and a few moments later, a
young woman, hardly older than
the young man but with a white
armband worn by faculty mem
