# Passport Law May Change
## 
### 
The Senate passed a bill early
this month to make several
changes in the passport laws,
but the bill (S. 1418) is now
pending before the House For
eign Affairs State Department
Subcommittee.
The bill would raise the total
cost of a passport to $15, but
it would also extend the period
of passport validity to five years.
Thus the total cost for a pass
port would be the same as that
for the present three year pass
port, renewed for two more
years.
