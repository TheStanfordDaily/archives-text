# Cal 9 Entertains Resurgent Tribe
## 
### GARY CAVALLI 
After bouncing back into the
thick of a Pacific-8 baseball con
tention with five straight wins,
Stanford journeys to Berkeley
tomorrow for an encounter with
Cal's hard-luck Bears at 2:00.
This afternoon the Indians
host the San Diego Marines in a
non-league contest at 3:00.
The Berkeley nine lost three
one-run games last weekend,
losing to Washington State
1-0 and 5-4, and dropping an
other 1-0 shutout to Oregon
In the opener of Monday's
doubleheader.
The Bears came back to
whitewash Oregon 5-0 in Mon
day's nightcap behind the five
hit pitching of Tony Murray.
Murray's shutout was the first
thrown by a Cal hurler since
1966.
Tuesday the Bears battered
Oregon 13-1 to up their Pac-8
mark to 3-6. First-baseman Bob
Rebuschatis, who is batting just
below .500 in league play,
sparked the win with two hits
in a seven-run first inning.
Stanford (28-7 overall) clob
bered Oregon 113 Tuesday to
climb within a half-game of
second place in the western
circuit with a 6-2 mark. Un
beaten USC (8-0) is in first,
while UCLA holds on to sec
ond with a 7-2 ledger.
Recent Tribe baseball action

has been highlighted by the hot
hitting of Ron Shotts and the
surprising play of shortstop
Chuck Williams, who moved
into the lineup when regular
shortstop Russ Tweet pulled a
hamstring muscle.
Shotts, with two home runs
last week, has climbed over
the .320 mark and is pushing
slumping JefT Rohlflng for the
team batting lead.
Williams responded to his
chance to play full time by ham
mering two home runs in the
four games he played, while
also fielding well.
Tweet returned to the lineup
in Tuesday's game, and Wil
liams moved to second, replac
ing Mike Ammirato. In that
contest Williams belted his sec
ond homer of the week, collected
two RBI, and executed two nifty
sacrifice bunts.
The Indians seem to have
come out of the hitting dul
drums which plagued them
throughout the previous two
weeks, scoring 41 runs in their
last five games.
The insertion of Williams into
the lineup was certainly a factor
in this offensive resurgence, and
now Coach Ray Young is faced
with the problem of having
three capable men (Tweet, Am
mirato and Williams) for only
two positions (short and sec
ond). But this is the type of
problems coaches like to have.

mering two home runs in the
four games he played, while
also fielding well.
Tweet returned to the lineup
in Tuesday's game, and Wil
liams moved to second, replac
ing Mike Ammirato. In that
contest Williams belted his sec
ond homer of the week, collected
two RBI, and executed two nifty
sacrifice bunts.
The Indians seem to have
come out of the hitting dul
drums which plagued them
throughout the previous two
weeks, scoring 41 runs in their
last five games.
The insertion of Williams into
the lineup was certainly a factor
in this offensive resurgence, and
now Coach Ray Young is faced
with the problem of having
three capable men (Tweet, Am
mirato and Williams) for only
two positions (short and sec
ond). But this is the type of
problems coaches like to have.
After bouncing back into the
thick of a Pacific-8 baseball con
tention with five straight wins,
Stanford journeys to Berkeley
tomorrow for an encounter with
Cal's hard-luck Bears at 2:00.
This afternoon the Indians
host the San Diego Marines in a
non-league contest at 3:00.
The Berkeley nine lost three
one-run games last weekend,
losing to Washington State
1-0 and 5-4, and dropping an
other 1-0 shutout to Oregon
In the opener of Monday's
doubleheader.
The Bears came back to
whitewash Oregon 5-0 in Mon
day's nightcap behind the five
hit pitching of Tony Murray.
Murray's shutout was the first
thrown by a Cal hurler since
1966.
Tuesday the Bears battered
Oregon 13-1 to up their Pac-8
mark to 3-6. First-baseman Bob
Rebuschatis, who is batting just
below .500 in league play,
sparked the win with two hits
in a seven-run first inning.
Stanford (28-7 overall) clob
bered Oregon 113 Tuesday to
climb within a half-game of
second place in the western
circuit with a 6-2 mark. Un
beaten USC (8-0) is in first,
while UCLA holds on to sec
ond with a 7-2 ledger.
Recent Tribe baseball action

has been highlighted by the hot
hitting of Ron Shotts and the
surprising play of shortstop
Chuck Williams, who moved
into the lineup when regular
shortstop Russ Tweet pulled a
hamstring muscle.
Shotts, with two home runs
last week, has climbed over
the .320 mark and is pushing
slumping JefT Rohlflng for the
team batting lead.
Williams responded to his
chance to play full time by ham
mering two home runs in the
four games he played, while
also fielding well.
