# Indian Spikers Face Cal In 74th Big Meet
## 
### 
For the 74th renewal of the
Big Meet, host California will be
a slight favorite to topple the
Stanford trackmen, though the
Cards put three new school rec
ords on the board last weekend
in a losing performance against
Oregon. Frosh field events start
at 11:00 a.m. and varsity field
events at 1:30 p.m. Running
events begin at 1:55 p.m.
Though both varsity contin
gents have taken their lumps at
various times during the season,
the featured event will be the
high jump which features a bat
tle of unbeatens—Cal's Clarence
Johnson, who has cleared seven
feet three times this year, and
Stanford's Peter Boyce, who
owns the world's best 1968 jump
to date at 7-3.
Cal goes Into the Big Meet
with a good team victory at
its back. In fact, Coach Sam
Bell called his team's 76-68
victory over U.C.L.A. the fin
est overall gToup effort he has
had since coming to Berkeley.
The 1968 season for Stanford
has seen numerous competitors
reach deep down for outstand
ing performances, but not
enough have come at the same

time, and a somewhat disap
pointing 2-5 dual meet record to
date has been the result. The
"dopesheet" has Stanford a
close loser on the basis of best
performances, so that several
come through performances
could swing the balance in favor
of the Tribe.
In Intermediate hurdler Pad
dy McCrary (51.5), long Jump
er Stan Royster (24-7'/j), and
half mller Devone Smith
(1:50.5), Cal has three ath
letes besides Johnson who
have not lost in college com
petition this year.
Add in a 16 foot pole vaulter
in Mike Robinson, a trio of out
standing low hurdlers (Lou
Kirtman, Bob McLennan, and
McCrary), and strength in the
shot put, and to offset this mix
ture Stanford will have to pick
up 10 to 15 unexpected points.
The three Indians who post
ed new school marks against
Oregon will be heavy favor
ites. Tom Colby, a transfer
from Tulane, unleashed the
javeline 258-2, which is the
best collegiate mark this year
and fifth best in the country.
Joining the select company of

Larry Questad and Ernie Cun
liffe, who both have their names j
in the record book twice, sopho
more Greg Brock added the
three-mile record to the two-mile
record he had broken the week
before. He ran 13:49.6 to break
Dave Deubner's 1962 standard
by more than eight seconds and
will be a favorite against Cal's
impressive sophomore, Bob Wal
don.
Lan Arnold broke his triple
jump school record for the
third time this year with a
51-8 Vi leap at CorvallLn last
week.
To lend further optimism to
the Tribe camp, senior sprinter
Roger Cox emerged as its top
sprinter with a 9.9, 21.4 double
against the Ducks. Also, Tom
Massey picked up runner-up
honors in the high and triple
jumps and had a season best in
the high hurdles.
At the frosh level, another
battle of the unbeatens will
take place as both teams are
undefeated, but the 9-0 Stan
ford team appears to have the
depth and balance to halt a
two year losing streak in the
Little Big Meet.
The Bear Cubs can claim su
periority in the weight events
and possibly in the sprints
where Dave Masters (9.6, 21.6)
is a top prospect, but otherwise
the Papooses can at best be par
tially checked.
Stanford freshman Jim Kauff
man will be entered in six
events, four individual events
and two relays. The holder of
the frosh school record in the
440 at 48.0, KaufTman also will
be favored in the long and triple
jumps and will be a sure placer
in the high jump as Cal will
have no entrants.

and fifth best in the country.
Joining the select company of

Larry Questad and Ernie Cun
liffe, who both have their names j
in the record book twice, sopho

three-mile record to the two-mile
record he had broken the week
before. He ran 13:49.6 to break
Dave Deubner's 1962 standard
by more than eight seconds and
will be a favorite against Cal's
impressive sophomore, Bob Wal

Lan Arnold broke his triple
jump school record for the
third time this year with a
51-8 Vi leap at CorvallLn last
week.
To lend further optimism to
the Tribe camp, senior sprinter
Roger Cox emerged as its top
sprinter with a 9.9, 21.4 double
against the Ducks. Also, Tom
Massey picked up runner-up
honors in the high and triple
jumps and had a season best in
the high hurdles.
At the frosh level, another
battle of the unbeatens will
take place as both teams are
undefeated, but the 9-0 Stan
ford team appears to have the
depth and balance to halt a
two year losing streak in the
Little Big Meet.
The Bear Cubs can claim su

Stanford freshman Jim Kauff

have no entrants.
For the 74th renewal of the

Stanford's Peter Boyce, who
owns the world's best 1968 jump
to date at 7-3.
Cal goes Into the Big Meet

The 1968 season for Stanford
has seen numerous competitors
reach deep down for outstand
