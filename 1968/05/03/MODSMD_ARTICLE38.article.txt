# Laxmen Host Claremont, Gun For 9th Straight Win
## 
### 
The undefeated Stanford la
crosse team can peak for one
game this weekend, when it
hosts Claremont College in a
North-South duel at 2:00 Satur
day.
For the past two weekends
the Indians have played gruel
ling doubleheaders. Last week
end they beat California 8-5
and the San Francisco La
crosse Club 84 to extend their
season record to 8-0.
Stanford Coach Don Ronayne
hopes that this weekend the

Stanford offense will have come
of age and put a consistent bar
rage on the Claremont goalie in
preparation for next week's
showdown against Air Force.
When the offense has been
good it has been very good,
but that has not happened of
ten enough for Ronayne's
nerves. But he feels that at
tackmen George Muser, Peter
Eakland, Mark Teeter, and a
healthy Peter Hovey are due
to explode. He is particularly
pleased with Eakland's recent
work on the crease.
