# Female Persuationâ€”IM Track Meet Goes Coed
## 
### ROBERT SPANNER 
Last year, Stanford women
won the right to move off-cam
pus. This year, an even greater
victory has been won.
The annual intramural track
meet is going coed.
I Feverish negotiating by
Ginger Smith, who has been
running competitively for sev
eral years, is what made it
all possible.
She had asked Pay ton Jordan,
Stanford track coach, what he
thought of having a few girls'
events in the IM meet, and Jor
dan said he thought it was a
good idea. However, Dutch
Fehring, in charge of intramur
al athletics, was adamant in up
holding a traditional Stanford
policy barring girls from IM
athletics.
But when Miss Smith explain
ed that what she had in mind
was not competition with the
men, but rather separate races
in which only women would be

entered, Fehring was happy to
comply with her request to open
the IM track meet to women.
So there will be seven track
events open to women Mon
day when the track prelimi
naries are help: the 70-yard
low hurdles, the 50-yard dash,
the quarter-mile, the 440 relay,
the 220-yard dash, and the high
jump and long jump.
The meet begins at 3:00 p.m.
with the high jump, the long
jump, and the 70-yard hurdles.
Experience is absolutely un
necessary. According to Miss
Smith, "This is for fun."
It has been a matter of de
bate for some time among
Stanford men as to whether
the women on the Row or
those In Florence Moore are
the fastest At long last, the
issue can be resolved.
So if you were decisvely
beaten in the last RF, get re
venge. Challenge the house next
door in the 440 relay.
