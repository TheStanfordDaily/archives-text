# IJB Finds Demonstrators Guilty; Asks Suspensions
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Overruling a decision of the ASSU Judi
cial Council, the all-faculty Interim Judi
cial Body (IJB) yesterday found seven stu
dents guility of violating the University
demonstrations policy during a protest
against CIA recruiting last Nov. 1.
The IJB recommended to President Wal
lace Sterling that he suspend five of the
students for summer quarter and two of
them, Marc Sapir and Barry Greenberg, for
summer and autumn quarters. Sapir and
Greenberg have been convicted on a previ
ous occasion of violating the demonstra
tions rule.
Student government leaders immedi
ately condemned the 1.18 decision and
asked Sterling not to carry through the
suspensions.
Yesterday Sapir announced that he will
be a write-in candidate for ASSU president
in the primary election May 7-8. "I am go
ing to force the issue of the administra
tion's authoritarian attitude toward stu
dents," he told the Daily last night.
Of the seven defendants, only three can
be directly penalized by the proposed sus
pensions. Sapir says he has been classified
1-A by his draft board and fears that he
will be inducted if he is unable to continue
his studies next fall.
Two other students, Jack R. Gerson and
Andrew H. Fames, said they had planned
to complete work on their masters degrees
this summer.
Three other defendants are not currently
registered.
President Sterling was unavailable for
comment yesterday on the LIB recommen
dations. Dean of Students Joel Smith,
who conferred with Sterling yesterday
morning on the verdict, told the DAILY
he expects some action by Sterling
within "several days."
Sapir said he would begin his cam
paign for the ASSU presidency at noon
today in White Plaza by presenting "de
mands" to President Sterling that he reject
the proposed suspensions, abolish the IJB,
and come out in favor of selection of his
successor by a student-faculty committee,
with ratification by a vote of the entire
University community.
Sterling will have until Monday to an

swer these demands, said Sapir, or lace
"immediate action to secure them." He did
not elaborate.
By its unanimous decision, the IJB heated
up the coals of a controversy which has
dragged on since the anti-CIA protest in
November, when an amused crowd of 50
leftist students tried to prevent a lone CIA
recruiter from conducting job interviews
in Encina hall.
Dean Smith has patiently tried to bring
disciplinary action against the student
demonstrators ever since. His efforts have
caused a running battle between the Associ
ated Students and the University.
After the ASSU Judicial Council vindi
cated nine indicted demonstrators Feb. 19,
Dean Smith appealed the decision to the
IJB. But the ASSU refuses to recognize the
IJB's jurisdiction, claiming that any ap
peals court must have student members.
Only one of the defendants, Yale M.
Braunstein, appeared before the IJB. The
other six boycotted the April 30 hearing.
"This sentence is like capital punish
ment because several of the students
could be drafted," ASSU President Cesare
Massarenti said angrily. "The Interim
Judicial Body is illegal."
"I ask President Sterling not to accept
the recommendations of the IJB and instead
to set up a student-faculty judicial system,"
Massarenti said. Michael Weinstein, speaker
of the ASSU legislature, concurred and said
he would seek a meeting with Sterling
today.
Meanwhile the ten-member ASSU Ju
dicial Council issued a statement (see
page two) denying the IJB's jurisdiction
and accusing the IJB of violating accept
ed legal procedure in handling the case.
Other criticism of the IJB action came
from a member of the Committee of Fif
teen, who called it "unfortunate in the ex
treme." The Committee of Fifteen, which
has five student, five faculty and five ad
ministration members, has been working
for the past five months on a solution to the
judicial dispute which would substitute a
new student-faculty court for both the IJB
and the ASSU Judicial Council.
In its three-page decision, the IJB re
peated its opinion that it does not recognize
the right of the ASSU Judicial Council to

declare the University demonstrations pol
icy "unenforceable." The IJB, chaired by
Law Professor Howard Williams, said it
"gave careful consideration" before recom
mending the suspension penalties.
Sapir has been involved in protest ac
tivities since he came to Stanford four
years ago. This year's judicial controversy,
in fact, is like a re-run of an unresolved
dispute last year between the IJB and stu
dent government over other University dis
ciplinary action against Sapir.
Sapir, from Yonkers, N.Y., graduated
from Brandeis University in 1963 and did a
year of biochemical research at Albert Ein
stein Medical Center in New York City. He
enrolled at the Stanford Medical School in
1964.
In April, 1965, Sapir orgunized the first
"teach-In" at Stanford to protest the Viet
nam war. He also helped found the Stan
ford Committee for Peace in Vietnam and
the Stanford Anti-Draft union.
Sapir's conflicts with the Stanford admin
istration began in May, 1966 when he par
ticipated in a sit-in in President Wallace
Sterling's office to protest the now defunct
"Selective Service Test" being administered
on campus. At that time Sapir was on leave
from the University.
The other students at the sit-in were tried
and put on probation by the ASSU Judicial
Council, but Sapir was not prosecuted by
the Dean of Students until he re-enrolled
at Stanford in January, 1967. The Judicial
Council acquitted Sapir because he had not
been enrolled as a student at the time of the
sit-in.
But the newly-installed Dean of Students
Smith decided to appeal the Sapir case to
the Interim Judicial Body, which had been
set up in 1966 by Sterling to hear appeals
from the Judicial Council.
Sapir refused to appear before the IJB
because the ASSU did not recognize the
body's legitimacy. The IJB found Sapir
guilty but no disciplinary action was taken.
This year Sapir has been involved in oth
er protests besides the anti-CIA demonstra
tion in November. He is one of 20 medical
students who have refused to sign their fi
nal examinations in Community Health,
demanding that the Medical School prom
ise to improve the course before it is of
fered again.
