# Frat Discrimination Banned By Inter-Fraternity Council
## 
### MARGARET McGAUGHEY 
Last night the Stanford Inter-
Fraternity Council unanimously
adopted a resolution which pro
hibits discrimination against mi
nority groups in all fraternity
activities and provides for spe
cific programs to deal with mi
nority problems.
After talks with Black Stu
dent Union leaders and a series
of committee meetings, the IFC
adopted the following resolu
tion:
"We, the members of the
Stanford Interfraternity Coun
cil wish to reaffirm our com
mitment to the policy of non
discrimination with regards
to minority groups in all our
activities including rush. The
IFC encourages and supports
all efforts by member frater
nities to influence the policy
of their nationals on this mat
ter.
"Specifically the goals of such
efforts would be the inclusion
within the charter of each na

tional fraternity of a clause or
amendment explicitly prohibit
ing discriminatory clauses or
practices by any local chapter.
In addition the IFC will make
systematic reports on the prog
ress of the individual houses."
Specifically, the resolution pro
vides that "IFC will finance
through its Guest-in-Residence
fund programs which will deal
with the education of the white
community with regards to mi
nority groups". An unspecified
sum from the annual IFC budg
et will be used to bring speakers
to individual fraternity houses
who represent the viewpoint of
the Negro Community. The
Council will work with the BSU
in its choice of speakers.
The resolution also sets up
a standing committee to deal
with the problems of minority
groups. The committee will
distribute information about
non-discriminatory rush policy
in registration packets each
quarter.

In addition, the committee will
offer to work with the Univer
sity in the recruitment of mi
nority students.
Finally, the committee will
publish the efforts of member
fraternities toward minority
group non-discrimination. This
is intended both to inform the
national fraternities, and to in
spire them to adjust their dis
criminatory policies following
the example of local chapters.
