## Shipboard Peace Possibility Sunk 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)— An In
donesian offer of a shipboard
site for preliminary talks on
Vietnam was reported sunk
Thursday by North Vietnam,
leaving unbroken a month-old
stalemate between Hanoi and
Washington.
In Vientiane, The Associated
Press quoted a North Vietna
mese embassy spokesman as re
jecting Indonesia's offer to send
a cruiser to the Tonkin Gulf to
serve as a meeting place for
U.S. and North Vietnamese en
voys charged with determining
whether serious peace negotia
tions are possible.
The word from the Laotian
capital killed still another of the
fleeting hopes for agreement
that have arisen sporadically
since Hanoi accepted on April 3
a U.S. suggestion that prelimi
nary talks be held.
The White House had agreed
to the Indonesian proposal Wed
nesday.
The State Department made
plain that the U.S. government
still objects to the site pushed
hardest by the Communists —
Warsaw. It reaffirmed an April
II U.S. statement preferring a
neutral site over the capital of

Red Poland, a backer of North
Vietnam in the war.
• Reuther Hits Meany
ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP)
— President Walter P. Reuther
of the United Auto Workers Un
ion renewed his fight Thursday
with AFL-CIO President George
Meany and hinted at pulling the
UAW out of the powerful labor
federation.
Reuther declared on the eve
of the UAW's 21st constitutional
convention that if his call for a
special AFL-CIO convention is
refused, "We could not in good
conscience continue to be con
fined within the restricted limits
of an organization ruled by the
dead hand of the past."
He said the 1.5 million-mem
ber UAW will be obligated "to
take those steps that offer the
best prospects" for achieving
the purposes of a modern and
progressive labor movement.
Asked if Reuther meant break
ing off with the AFL-CIO. a un
ion spokesman replied: "What
else is left?"
• King's March Starts
MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP)—The
late Dr. Martin Luther King's

Poor People's March on Wash
ington got off to a slow, creak
ing start Thursday—starting at
the point where a sniper killed
him April 4.
"The moment has come." the
Rev. Ralph Abernathy told the
crowd gathered for the memo
rial service. "The days of weep
ing are ended. The days of
march have begun."
Led by a battered old wagon
hauled by two lop-eared mules,
the some 400 who joined the
symbolic 2V&-mile march
through a slum area walked
eight abreast under a hot sun.
Dr. King's widow was a trim
dignified figure in mourning
black, spoke at the somber me
morial service that preceded the
march.
Abernathy, wearing blue den
ims instead of sober preacher's
garb, told the crowd the Poor
People's March will not exclude
any color of people.
• TeloffTione Accord
(AP) — Tele
phone strikers won three-year
wage and fringe benefit in
creases totaling nearly 20 per
cent Thursday in 1968's fattest
labor contract agreement thus

far. It will affect some 600,000
workers across the nation.
The AFL-CIO Communica
tions Workers estimated the set
tlement will cost the Bell Sys
tem more than $2 million and top
company offlicals said it will
mean higher bills for many of
the nation's 50 million telephone
subscribers.
Some 200,000 strikers will vote
in the next few days on whether
to end their 15-day-old nation
wide walkout and accept the
agreement, which would set a
pattern for most of the 400,000
other Bell System workers
whose contracts expire later.
• Jerusalem Parade
JERUSALEM (AP) — The
might of Zion - Soviet - made
arms seized from the Arabs and
planes and guns bought in the
United States and France-sped
across captured Jerusalem
Thursday in an Israeli celebra
tion of 20 years of statehood that
defied the United Nations and
the Arab world.
Under a burning sun, 4,500
troops and 450 vehicles
crunched along a five-mile pa
rade route that led through an
Arab quarter held by Jordan un
til the Middle East war last

June and into a traditionally
Jewish area of the once divided
city.
Some 250,000 Israelis and visi
tors cheered as 300 planes
screamed overhead.
The parade, denounced last
week by the United Nations Se
curity Council as a blow to Mid
dle East peace, caused angry
demonstrations in Lebanon and
Syria. But Jerusalem's Arabs
were quiet and threat of terror
ism by the A 1 Fatah guerrilla
organization did not material
ize.

bia University offered new
