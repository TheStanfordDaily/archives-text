# Sterling Rejects Demands As Students Vote Action
## 
### DAN SNELL 
As University President J. E.
Wallace Sterling issued a state
ment rejecting student demands
on the judicial controversy, one
hundred forty students meeting
last night in TMU voted to stage
"some sort of militant demon
stration" at noon today starting
in White Plaza.
Sterling's statement (reprint
ed on page three) invites "each
of the defendants (in the CIA
demonstrations case) individual
ly to present any facts he may
wish to bring to my attention
before I decide to accept, modi
fy, or reject the recommenda
tions of the Interim Judicial
Body," issued Thursday.
The militant students voted to
demonstrated unless the Interim
Judicial Body (IJB) decision
proposed suspensions for seven

students are turned down,
the IJB is disbanded, and a new
board with both student and fac
ulty members that hears ap
peals from defendants only is
set up.
The demands call for Sterl
ing to appear today in White
Plaza and answer the issues.
And aide to President Sterl
ing said last night that there
would be no administration
representative at the White
Plaza rally today.
Sterling also said that he was
asked that a special meeting of
the Academic Council be con
vened at 4:15 p.m. Wed. to dis
cuss the controversy. Sterling
said ASSU President Cesare Mas
sarenti and one other student
officers would be invited to pre
sent their views at the meeting.
The students earlier had de
cided that specific tactics for
the demonstration today would
be decided by a small tactics
committee selected from the
group. Several tactics were dis
cussed in the meeting, but the
group as a whole decided only
not to include violence and de
struction of property in the dem
onstration to take place this af
-ternoon.
Massarenti said in the meet
ing that he would meet with
candidates for ASSU president
today at 9 a.m. and get them to
resign from the race if the de
mands were not met.
Massarenti said he would
resign himself "at one o'clock"
if today's noon deadline were
passed.
The four student demands
stem from the Thursday deci

sion of the all-faculty IJB to sus
pend seven students for the par
ticipation in a demonstration
Nov. 1 against a recruiter for
the Central Intelligence Agency
on campus.
Two of the students, Marc Sa
pir and Barry Greenborg, were
suspended through January; the
others, Yale Braunstein, Jeffrey
Browning, Jack Gerson, and Guy
Smythe, were suspended only
through summer quarter.
Nov. 1 several of the 50 to 100
students participating in the
demonstration attempted to
the West Wing of Encina Hall,
where the interviews were to be
held. But Dean of Students Joel
Smith informed the students
that they were violating Univer
sity policy on demonstrations,
and the students withdrew to
continue their protest outside.
Ten days later Smith brought
charges against ten of the stu
dents in the ASSU Judicial Coun
cil. After much confusion, the
Council found all ten not guilty
on the grounds that the dem
onstrations policy was "over
board." But on appeal to the IJB
seven of the students — those
who remained at Stanford were
suspended starting at the end
of this quarter.
Last Friday at noon about 150
students attending a rally in
White Plaza on the IJB issue
walked to the President's of
fice on the Inner Quad and de
manded that the seven not be
suspended, and that IJB be
abolished.
Earlier in the day Massaren
ti and other student oflFcers

had met with Stirling: to dis
cuss the situation and met
with what Massarenti called
a "cool" response. Dean Smith
and Vice Provost Packer also
were present.
The walk to Building 10 was
initiated by Marc Sapir, one of
those suspended, who also was
in charge of last night's meeting
along with Massarenti.
Massarenti, a veteran of Ital
ian student protests in Milan in
1962, said last night, "I think
we have to construct a mass
movement around this issue, a
really big one. Either Sterling
answers on White Plaza tomor
row," he said, "or we don't want
anyone to answer."
Though the students had not
seen the statement from Ster
ling, one said he felt sure the
Administration would present
"an answer designed to divide
radicals from moderates."
Massarenti announced that
students had collected about 650
signatures from students on the
list of four demands.
Among tactics discussed for
todays demonstration were a
mill-in at the Old Union, where
many administrative offices are
located, Encina Hall, or Inner
Quad.
Steve Weisman, one of those
present, said today's demonstra
tion had to be "militant enough
so that students have to choose
sides. The best thing Stanford
students do is to be concerned."
Sapir stressed that the action
planned for today should be
"flexible so that we can easily
escalate our position."

Massarenti announced that

Among tactics discussed for
todays demonstration were a

many administrative offices are
located, Encina Hall, or Inner

Steve Weisman, one of those

Sapir stressed that the action

JUDICIAL PROTEST — Over 100 students staged a sit-in protest in front of President Sterling's of
fice Friday to agree on demands concerning the recent recommended suspension of seven students
Involved in a CIA protest last Fall. ASSU President Cesare Massarenti addressed the students, while
Vice-Provost Herbert Packer and Associate Dean of Students Willard YY'yman waited to receive the de
mands.
As University President J. E.
Wallace Sterling issued a state
ment rejecting student demands
on the judicial controversy, one
hundred forty students meeting
last night in TMU voted to stage
"some sort of militant demon
stration" at noon today starting
in White Plaza.
Sterling's statement (reprint
ed on page three) invites "each
of the defendants (in the CIA
demonstrations case) individual
ly to present any facts he may
wish to bring to my attention
before I decide to accept, modi
fy, or reject the recommenda
tions of the Interim Judicial
Body," issued Thursday.
The militant students voted to
demonstrated unless the Interim
Judicial Body (IJB) decision
proposed suspensions for seven

students are turned down,
the IJB is disbanded, and a new
board with both student and fac
ulty members that hears ap
peals from defendants only is
set up.
The demands call for Sterl
ing to appear today in White
Plaza and answer the issues.
And aide to President Sterl
ing said last night that there
would be no administration
representative at the White
Plaza rally today.
Sterling also said that he was
asked that a special meeting of
the Academic Council be con
vened at 4:15 p.m. Wed. to dis
cuss the controversy. Sterling
said ASSU President Cesare Mas
sarenti and one other student
officers would be invited to pre
sent their views at the meeting.
The students earlier had de
cided that specific tactics for
the demonstration today would
be decided by a small tactics
committee selected from the
group. Several tactics were dis
cussed in the meeting, but the
group as a whole decided only
not to include violence and de
struction of property in the dem
onstration to take place this af
-ternoon.
Massarenti said in the meet
ing that he would meet with
candidates for ASSU president
today at 9 a.m. and get them to
resign from the race if the de
mands were not met.
Massarenti said he would
resign himself "at one o'clock"
if today's noon deadline were
passed.
The four student demands
stem from the Thursday deci

sion of the all-faculty IJB to sus
pend seven students for the par
ticipation in a demonstration
Nov. 1 against a recruiter for
the Central Intelligence Agency
on campus.
Two of the students, Marc Sa
pir and Barry Greenborg, were
suspended through January; the
others, Yale Braunstein, Jeffrey
Browning, Jack Gerson, and Guy
Smythe, were suspended only
through summer quarter.
Nov. 1 several of the 50 to 100
students participating in the
demonstration attempted to
the West Wing of Encina Hall,
where the interviews were to be
held. But Dean of Students Joel
Smith informed the students
that they were violating Univer
sity policy on demonstrations,
and the students withdrew to
continue their protest outside.
Ten days later Smith brought
charges against ten of the stu
dents in the ASSU Judicial Coun
cil. After much confusion, the
Council found all ten not guilty
on the grounds that the dem
onstrations policy was "over
board." But on appeal to the IJB
seven of the students — those
who remained at Stanford were
suspended starting at the end
of this quarter.
Last Friday at noon about 150
students attending a rally in
White Plaza on the IJB issue
walked to the President's of
fice on the Inner Quad and de
manded that the seven not be
suspended, and that IJB be
abolished.
Earlier in the day Massaren
ti and other student oflFcers

had met with Stirling: to dis
cuss the situation and met
with what Massarenti called
a "cool" response. Dean Smith
and Vice Provost Packer also
were present.
The walk to Building 10 was
initiated by Marc Sapir, one of
those suspended, who also was
in charge of last night's meeting
along with Massarenti.
Massarenti, a veteran of Ital
ian student protests in Milan in
1962, said last night, "I think

that they were violating Univer
sity policy on demonstrations,
and the students withdrew to
continue their protest outside.
Ten days later Smith brought
charges against ten of the stu
dents in the ASSU Judicial Coun
cil. After much confusion, the
Council found all ten not guilty
on the grounds that the dem
onstrations policy was "over
board." But on appeal to the IJB
seven of the students — those
who remained at Stanford were
suspended starting at the end
of this quarter.
Last Friday at noon about 150
students attending a rally in
White Plaza on the IJB issue
walked to the President's of
fice on the Inner Quad and de
manded that the seven not be
suspended, and that IJB be
abolished.
Earlier in the day Massaren
ti and other student oflFcers

had met with Stirling: to dis
cuss the situation and met
with what Massarenti called
a "cool" response. Dean Smith
and Vice Provost Packer also
were present.
The walk to Building 10 was
initiated by Marc Sapir, one of
those suspended, who also was
in charge of last night's meeting
along with Massarenti.
Massarenti, a veteran of Ital
ian student protests in Milan in
1962, said last night, "I think
we have to construct a mass
movement around this issue, a
really big one. Either Sterling
answers on White Plaza tomor
row," he said, "or we don't want
anyone to answer."
Though the students had not
seen the statement from Ster
ling, one said he felt sure the
Administration would present
"an answer designed to divide
radicals from moderates."
Massarenti announced that
students had collected about 650
signatures from students on the
list of four demands.
Among tactics discussed for
todays demonstration were a
mill-in at the Old Union, where
many administrative offices are
located, Encina Hall, or Inner
Quad.
Steve Weisman, one of those
present, said today's demonstra
tion had to be "militant enough
so that students have to choose
sides. The best thing Stanford
students do is to be concerned."
Sapir stressed that the action
planned for today should be
"flexible so that we can easily
escalate our position."

JUDICIAL PROTEST — Over 100 students staged a sit-in protest in front of President Sterling's of
fice Friday to agree on demands concerning the recent recommended suspension of seven students
Involved in a CIA protest last Fall. ASSU President Cesare Massarenti addressed the students, while
Vice-Provost Herbert Packer and Associate Dean of Students Willard YY'yman waited to receive the de
mands.
As University President J. E.
Wallace Sterling issued a state
ment rejecting student demands
on the judicial controversy, one
hundred forty students meeting
last night in TMU voted to stage
"some sort of militant demon
stration" at noon today starting
in White Plaza.
Sterling's statement (reprint
ed on page three) invites "each
of the defendants (in the CIA
demonstrations case) individual
ly to present any facts he may
wish to bring to my attention
before I decide to accept, modi
fy, or reject the recommenda
tions of the Interim Judicial
Body," issued Thursday.
The militant students voted to
demonstrated unless the Interim
Judicial Body (IJB) decision
proposed suspensions for seven

students are turned down,
the IJB is disbanded, and a new
board with both student and fac
ulty members that hears ap
peals from defendants only is
set up.
The demands call for Sterl
ing to appear today in White
Plaza and answer the issues.
And aide to President Sterl
ing said last night that there
would be no administration
representative at the White
Plaza rally today.
Sterling also said that he was
asked that a special meeting of
the Academic Council be con
vened at 4:15 p.m. Wed. to dis
cuss the controversy. Sterling
said ASSU President Cesare Mas
sarenti and one other student
officers would be invited to pre
sent their views at the meeting.
The students earlier had de
cided that specific tactics for
the demonstration today would
be decided by a small tactics
committee selected from the
group. Several tactics were dis
cussed in the meeting, but the
group as a whole decided only
not to include violence and de
struction of property in the dem
onstration to take place this af
-ternoon.
Massarenti said in the meet
ing that he would meet with
candidates for ASSU president
today at 9 a.m. and get them to
resign from the race if the de
mands were not met.
Massarenti said he would
resign himself "at one o'clock"
if today's noon deadline were
passed.
The four student demands
stem from the Thursday deci

sion of the all-faculty IJB to sus
pend seven students for the par
ticipation in a demonstration
Nov. 1 against a recruiter for
the Central Intelligence Agency
on campus.
Two of the students, Marc Sa
pir and Barry Greenborg, were
suspended through January; the
others, Yale Braunstein, Jeffrey
Browning, Jack Gerson, and Guy
Smythe, were suspended only
through summer quarter.
Nov. 1 several of the 50 to 100
students participating in the
demonstration attempted to
the West Wing of Encina Hall,
where the interviews were to be
held. But Dean of Students Joel
Smith informed the students
that they were violating Univer
sity policy on demonstrations,
and the students withdrew to
continue their protest outside.
