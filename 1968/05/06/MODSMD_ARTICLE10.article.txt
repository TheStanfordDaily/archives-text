# Ideas Can Restore Campus Sanity
## 
### Max Lerner 
It will be one for the history
books. The Columbia University
revolt is not over, although its
trajectory has gone askew. The
rebelling students are no longer
in possession of the five build
ings they seized and barricaded.
But they still have a powerful
weapon at their command — the
horror that most students and
faculty feel at the idea of police
intervention, and the stirring of
the spirit that comes from the
idea of revolt, especially among
those whose lives have been too
safe and immune from the
harsh beat of events.
How powerful are the wea
pons that can be mustered
against the escalation of the re
volt, by students and faculty
alike who have chosen this uni
versity and want to go on with
their work? One thing is clear:
It Is not police compulsion, but

only ideas, that can counteract
the mindless drift of a pro
tracted closing of a great uni
versity.
The police probably had to
go in when both sides reached
a total impasse and nothing
else could retrieve the buildings
and the administration offices.
But the police cannot restore
classes, nor resume the dialog
between teachers and students
that we call education. In long
range terms the only weapons
that count with students are
Ideas and symbols.
Return Of Sanity
What ideas and symbols can
be invoked now to bring back
some sanity? For one, the idea
that neither Columbia nor the
United States is ripe for revo
lution in the absurd sense envis
aged by the little huddle of extre
mist Students for a Democratic

Society leaders and their older
but not wiser mentors in
the once occupied revolutionary
mathematics building.
These little Lenins and vest
pocket Castros, who long for a
revolutionary role in history and
babble some history-book phras
es about "bourgeois revolution"
and about a true "revolutionary
situation," would have had only
contempt for Grayson Kirk and
David Truman if they had grant
ed them the amnesty they de
manded. They see themselves
as men of steel, and they see the
decadents in authority as men
of putty.
When the cops broke through
the barricades, a romantic revo
lutionary dream went aglimmer
ing. According to the fantasy
scenario which the leaders had
cooked up in their minds, the
barricades were supposed to
hold, the police were supposed
to behave like Cossacks, the
Harlem population was suppos
ed to invade the campus en
masse to start a proletarian
phase of the student revolt. One
faculty member, an expert on
African politics, had even pre
dicted that if the police came
the university would be "burned
down."
Showdown Inevitable
Happily — or from some view
points alas? — it wasn't. The
apocalyptic vision was not ful
filled. True, some 70 or 80 stu
dents and a handful of cops got
hurt, a few with bloody head
woulds. This was because both

sides had got stuck in immovable
positions over the amnesty is
sue, which was a demand by the
rebels for unconditional surrend
er, with the insurance that, later,
continuing phases of the revolt
could be organized with no
danger of disciplinary action.
Once this impasse was reached,
a showdown was bound to come.
The testimony of Negro com
munity leaders is that the po
lice behaved, as Kenneth Clark
put it, with a "fantastic pro
fessionalism." The failure of the
Harlem uprising to materialize
was the turning point of the stu
dent revolt. That may have been
what Hark Rudd, the Dudi Dut
schke of the SDS, meant when
he said that "revolutionary situ
ation" was not yet.
Police Role
The other idea that needs to
be faced is the role of police on
a university campus. Except in
the most extreme situation, they
have no business there. It would
be hard to find a college admin
istrator, including Kirk and Tru
man, who would disagree with
that. But can anyone deny that
this has become an extreme situ
ation? To make an absolute of
the taboo on police would be to
throw away the final safeguard
that any community — includ
ing a university — must have
against the kind of direct action
that destroys a community. But
also, the invoking of police force
erodes the trust without which
a college community cannot
function.

There is the nub of the Colum
bia agony. Without the police,
the university would have to be
written off, and the result would
be the kind of paramilitary, ideo
logical armies that clashed in
Germany and made Hitler pos
sible. But the use of police Is
bound to leave a harvest of re
criminations. It also plays into
the hands of the direct-action
leaders. For it enables them to
appeal to well-meaning political
innocents who abhor revolution
ary action but who also recoil
from the police symbol.
Meanwhile, the Columbia stu
dents, even without classes in
session, have a chance to get a
real education — if they know
how to read the meaning of
events. For Henri Bergson's dic
tum still holds: we must think as
men of action, yes; but we must
also act as men of thought.

those whose lives have been too
safe and immune from the
harsh beat of events.
How powerful are the wea
pons that can be mustered
against the escalation of the re
volt, by students and faculty
alike who have chosen this uni
versity and want to go on with
their work? One thing is clear:
It Is not police compulsion, but

only ideas, that can counteract
the mindless drift of a pro
tracted closing of a great uni
versity.
The police probably had to
go in when both sides reached
a total impasse and nothing
else could retrieve the buildings
and the administration offices.
But the police cannot restore
classes, nor resume the dialog
between teachers and students
that we call education. In long
range terms the only weapons
that count with students are
Ideas and symbols.
Return Of Sanity
What ideas and symbols can
be invoked now to bring back
some sanity? For one, the idea
that neither Columbia nor the
United States is ripe for revo
lution in the absurd sense envis
aged by the little huddle of extre
mist Students for a Democratic

Society leaders and their older
but not wiser mentors in
the once occupied revolutionary
mathematics building.
These little Lenins and vest
pocket Castros, who long for a
revolutionary role in history and
babble some history-book phras
es about "bourgeois revolution"
and about a true "revolutionary
situation," would have had only
contempt for Grayson Kirk and
David Truman if they had grant
ed them the amnesty they de
manded. They see themselves
as men of steel, and they see the
decadents in authority as men
of putty.
When the cops broke through
the barricades, a romantic revo
lutionary dream went aglimmer
ing. According to the fantasy
scenario which the leaders had
cooked up in their minds, the
barricades were supposed to
hold, the police were supposed
to behave like Cossacks, the
Harlem population was suppos
ed to invade the campus en
masse to start a proletarian
phase of the student revolt. One
faculty member, an expert on
African politics, had even pre
dicted that if the police came
the university would be "burned
down."
Showdown Inevitable
Happily — or from some view
points alas? — it wasn't. The
apocalyptic vision was not ful
filled. True, some 70 or 80 stu
dents and a handful of cops got
hurt, a few with bloody head
woulds. This was because both

sides had got stuck in immovable
positions over the amnesty is
sue, which was a demand by the
rebels for unconditional surrend
er, with the insurance that, later,
continuing phases of the revolt
could be organized with no
danger of disciplinary action.
Once this impasse was reached,
a showdown was bound to come.
The testimony of Negro com
munity leaders is that the po
lice behaved, as Kenneth Clark
put it, with a "fantastic pro
fessionalism." The failure of the
Harlem uprising to materialize
was the turning point of the stu
dent revolt. That may have been
what Hark Rudd, the Dudi Dut
schke of the SDS, meant when
he said that "revolutionary situ
ation" was not yet.
Police Role
The other idea that needs to
be faced is the role of police on
a university campus. Except in
the most extreme situation, they
have no business there. It would
be hard to find a college admin
istrator, including Kirk and Tru
man, who would disagree with
that. But can anyone deny that
this has become an extreme situ
ation? To make an absolute of
the taboo on police would be to
throw away the final safeguard
that any community — includ
ing a university — must have
against the kind of direct action
that destroys a community. But
also, the invoking of police force
erodes the trust without which
a college community cannot
function.

There is the nub of the Colum
bia agony. Without the police,
the university would have to be
written off, and the result would
be the kind of paramilitary, ideo
logical armies that clashed in
Germany and made Hitler pos
sible. But the use of police Is
bound to leave a harvest of re
criminations. It also plays into
the hands of the direct-action
leaders. For it enables them to
appeal to well-meaning political
innocents who abhor revolution
ary action but who also recoil
from the police symbol.
Meanwhile, the Columbia stu
dents, even without classes in
session, have a chance to get a
real education — if they know
how to read the meaning of
events. For Henri Bergson's dic
tum still holds: we must think as
men of action, yes; but we must
also act as men of thought.
(c) 1968, Los Angrles Times

It will be one for the history
books. The Columbia University
revolt is not over, although its
trajectory has gone askew. The
rebelling students are no longer
in possession of the five build
ings they seized and barricaded.
But they still have a powerful
weapon at their command — the
horror that most students and
faculty feel at the idea of police
intervention, and the stirring of
the spirit that comes from the
idea of revolt, especially among
those whose lives have been too
safe and immune from the

The police probably had to
go in when both sides reached
a total impasse and nothing
else could retrieve the buildings
and the administration offices.
But the police cannot restore
classes, nor resume the dialog
between teachers and students
that we call education. In long
range terms the only weapons
that count with students are
Ideas and symbols.
Return Of Sanity
What ideas and symbols can
be invoked now to bring back
some sanity? For one, the idea
that neither Columbia nor the
United States is ripe for revo
lution in the absurd sense envis
aged by the little huddle of extre
mist Students for a Democratic

Society leaders and their older
but not wiser mentors in
the once occupied revolutionary
mathematics building.
These little Lenins and vest
pocket Castros, who long for a
revolutionary role in history and
babble some history-book phras
es about "bourgeois revolution"
and about a true "revolutionary
situation," would have had only
contempt for Grayson Kirk and
David Truman if they had grant
ed them the amnesty they de
manded. They see themselves
as men of steel, and they see the
decadents in authority as men
of putty.
When the cops broke through
the barricades, a romantic revo
lutionary dream went aglimmer
ing. According to the fantasy
scenario which the leaders had
cooked up in their minds, the
barricades were supposed to
hold, the police were supposed
to behave like Cossacks, the
Harlem population was suppos
ed to invade the campus en
masse to start a proletarian
phase of the student revolt. One
faculty member, an expert on
African politics, had even pre
dicted that if the police came
the university would be "burned
down."
Showdown Inevitable
Happily — or from some view
points alas? — it wasn't. The
apocalyptic vision was not ful
filled. True, some 70 or 80 stu
dents and a handful of cops got
hurt, a few with bloody head
woulds. This was because both

sides had got stuck in immovable
positions over the amnesty is
sue, which was a demand by the
rebels for unconditional surrend
er, with the insurance that, later,
continuing phases of the revolt
could be organized with no
danger of disciplinary action.
Once this impasse was reached,
a showdown was bound to come.
The testimony of Negro com
munity leaders is that the po
lice behaved, as Kenneth Clark
put it, with a "fantastic pro
fessionalism." The failure of the
Harlem uprising to materialize
was the turning point of the stu
dent revolt. That may have been
what Hark Rudd, the Dudi Dut
schke of the SDS, meant when
he said that "revolutionary situ
ation" was not yet.
Police Role
The other idea that needs to
be faced is the role of police on
a university campus. Except in
the most extreme situation, they
have no business there. It would
be hard to find a college admin
istrator, including Kirk and Tru
man, who would disagree with
that. But can anyone deny that
this has become an extreme situ
ation? To make an absolute of
the taboo on police would be to
throw away the final safeguard
that any community — includ
ing a university — must have
against the kind of direct action
that destroys a community. But
also, the invoking of police force
erodes the trust without which
a college community cannot
function.

There is the nub of the Colum
bia agony. Without the police,
the university would have to be
written off, and the result would
be the kind of paramilitary, ideo
logical armies that clashed in
Germany and made Hitler pos
sible. But the use of police Is
bound to leave a harvest of re
criminations. It also plays into
the hands of the direct-action
leaders. For it enables them to
appeal to well-meaning political
innocents who abhor revolution
ary action but who also recoil
from the police symbol.
Meanwhile, the Columbia stu
dents, even without classes in
session, have a chance to get a
real education — if they know
how to read the meaning of
events. For Henri Bergson's dic
tum still holds: we must think as
men of action, yes; but we must
also act as men of thought.

It will be one for the history
books. The Columbia University
revolt is not over, although its
trajectory has gone askew. The
rebelling students are no longer
in possession of the five build
ings they seized and barricaded.
But they still have a powerful
weapon at their command — the
horror that most students and
faculty feel at the idea of police
intervention, and the stirring of
the spirit that comes from the
idea of revolt, especially among
those whose lives have been too
safe and immune from the
harsh beat of events.
How powerful are the wea
pons that can be mustered
against the escalation of the re
volt, by students and faculty
alike who have chosen this uni
versity and want to go on with
their work? One thing is clear:
It Is not police compulsion, but

only ideas, that can counteract
the mindless drift of a pro
tracted closing of a great uni
versity.
The police probably had to
go in when both sides reached
a total impasse and nothing
else could retrieve the buildings
and the administration offices.
