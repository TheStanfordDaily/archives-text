# A 						Conspiracy Of One
## News Managers 
### Dan Snell 
There are two things that
really madden me—fickle wom
en and would-be amateur news
managers.
The former have been com
mented upon from time immem
orable (Mem Time?), but the lat
ter are a newer breed who fre
quently assault the news editor,
the person who decides what is
to go into the paper when, and
other functionaries on The Daily
and other news media.
The would-be news-manager
varies in his approach, but his
basic desire is to make the
world as impossible as possible
to reflect in any sort of way in
the pages of a college news
paper.
In one form the amateur news
manager is a person who comes
in with a letter to the editor or
story which, he says, "must be
run iri toto or not at all." It is
all clear why the thing must all
be run. Perhaps he has deluded
himself into thinking that his
four of prose is decidedly
of a high literary quality or
perhaps he is convinced that the
best way to make sure that no
one readsThe Daily is to make it
boring.
And cleverly this sort of
amateur news manager has
concealed an interesting fact
or an original thought at the
very end of his piece. But you
can't just run the good part;
he demands that you run it
all.
Another sort of amateur news
manager is the special interest
pusher. This species believes
that the Armadillo Day being
sponsored by the Association of
University Infants is about the
most important thing ever to
happen at Stanford. "You've
just got to put it on page one,"
he says smiling.
And of course you calmly
explain that circumstances
frequently dictate that such
interesting material be rele
gate to an inside page. They
look at you as if you had
taken their last frontal lobe.
And then you hypocritically
that, yes, you'll try awfully
hard to get it on page one,
hut something may come up.
And someone else will come in

because he has need of page
one space for friends of friends
of his who are passionately con
cerned with some obscure lec
ture put on by the Lithuanian
department as a benefit for Dani
orphans.
I have great respect for the
Lithuanian department. I even
once considered majoring in
Lithuanian once. And far be it
from me to cast aspersions on
the cause of Dani orphans. But
the simple fact is that there is
a big wide world out there some
where that The Daily is trying—
and sometimes, I admit, failing
to cover in an objective way,
giving front page space to what
is of general interest or of spe
cial significance.
The news managers have a
point, I confess, when they
plead that their stories and re
leases and letters and so on not
be cut. In the past The Dally
has disembowelled several such
documents. But we try not to.
We try not to with a passion.
And those who take the
trouble to give us stories and
letters ought to show some
small faith in us that we are
trying not to ruin what they
write.
Each day we are struggling
to reconcile the volume of ar
ticles we have and the vast
amount of news that happens
with the limited space we have
to print things in. That is a dif
ficult task, and it is not made
a bit easier by some of the va
ricities of news managers.
This is not to say that they
are not valuable in keeping us
informed of events, in supplying
us with ideas, facts, and in
sights. But they do not help at
all when they try to manipulate
coverage or space and when
they place unreasonable limita
tions on cutting their stories.
They merely make the news
editor spend more of his week
ends at the beach.
