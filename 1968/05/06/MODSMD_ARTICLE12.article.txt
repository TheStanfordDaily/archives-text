# University Policy On Judicial Reform
## 
### 
The University faces a mo
ment of trial because of a sim
plistic attack upon good-faith at
tempts which students and fac
ulty members are making to
solve a knotty problem of Uni
versity goverance. Issues this
complex are not going to be
resolved in White Memorial
Plaza, this noon or any other
noori. Issues this ambiguous are
not going to be resolved in ans
wer to an ultimatum.
For some time the orderly
and rational process of discus
sion and debate among students,
faculty members, and officers of
the University have been direct
ed toward solving the vexing
problem of how best to construct

a rule-making and judicial sys
tem that fits the needs of the
University today. I have some
reason to believe that those dis
cussions are now very close to
producing agreement on a sys
tem that will satisfy the criteria
of all but a very few zealots of
the far Left and far Right. I
have long been committed to
the proposition that the system
as finally evolved should ac
cord significant representation to
students in the rule-making and
judicial processes of the Univer
sity and also that it should ac
cord significant representation
to students in the selection of
student rule-makers and judges.
Contrary to what seems a wide

spread misconception, there has
never been any dispute on those
issues. The question has not
been "whether" but "how" and
"to what extent."
The issues themselves have
changed a good deal. When the
problem first arose and until
fairly recently, it was viewed
as a controversy about the judi
cial system. It has become clear
in the last few months, as the
result of hard work by the mem
bers of the Committee of Fif
teen, that we must simultane
ously resolve closely linked is
sues of rule-making and judging.
Two different kinds of bodies,
one to make rules and the oth
er to pass on alleged violations
of the rules, are now being dis

cussed in the Committee of Fif
teen. Both kinds of bodies are
intended to include students.
The rule-making issues are at
least as critical as the judicial
issues. Much as we may deplore
it, the Fundamental Standard
and the Honor Code no longer
suffice as the law of the Univer
sity. Much more detailed rules
are required. The Policy on Cam
pus Demonstrations cannot be
viewed as an isolated prescrip
tion but must be revised and
integrated into a comprehensive
code of student conduct.
I sympathize with the feelings
of frustration that are engender
ed when hard problems do not
yield easy solutions. I share
those feelings of frustration.
Even in an academic community,
discussion and debate must come
to an end and decisions must
be taken. My expectation is that
by the end of this quarter we will
have agreement on revised struc
tures for rule-making and judg
ing that can go into operation
next September. The not in
considerable number of students,
faculty members, and University
officers who are working on the
problems will lend their best ef
forts to realizing this expecta
tion. If, however, that expecta
tion is not met, I shall put into
effect before Autumn Quarter a
provisional modification of the
judicial system that ensures sig
nificant student representation
at each level of the judicial
process, appellate as well as
original. And I shall recommend
to my successor that he under

take to Institute permanent
rule-making and judicial systems
not later than January 1, 1969.
The Interim Judicial Body, as
its name implies, was not visual
ized as a permanent solution to
the problem of constituting an
appellate tribunal. Its members
have rendered significant service
to the University under difficult
conditions. I hope, as they do,
that they will not be called upon
to adjudicate any more cases
during the current academic
year.
The Interim Judicial Body's
recommendations in the CIA
Demonstration Case are now be
fore me. Accordingly, I am in
viting each of the defendants in
that case individually to present
any facts he may wish to bring
to my attention before I decide
to accept, modify, or reject the
recommendations of the Interim
Judicial Body. Letters to this ef
fect are on their way to the de
fendants. Because of the public
interest in the case I should add
that I am asking each of the
defendants to let me know not
later than Friday, May 10, if he
wishes to accept this invitation.
Finally, because these issues
are so important, I have asked
that a meeting of the Academic
Council be convened for 4:15
p.m. on Wednesday, May 8, and
I have invited the President of
ASSU to appear at the meeting
with one other student officer
to make a presentation of their
views.

by the end of this quarter we will
have agreement on revised struc
tures for rule-making and judg
ing that can go into operation
next September. The not in
considerable number of students,
faculty members, and University
officers who are working on the
problems will lend their best ef
forts to realizing this expecta
tion. If, however, that expecta
tion is not met, I shall put into
effect before Autumn Quarter a
provisional modification of the
judicial system that ensures sig
nificant student representation
at each level of the judicial
process, appellate as well as
original. And I shall recommend
to my successor that he under

take to Institute permanent
rule-making and judicial systems
not later than January 1, 1969.
The Interim Judicial Body, as
its name implies, was not visual
ized as a permanent solution to
the problem of constituting an
appellate tribunal. Its members
have rendered significant service
to the University under difficult
conditions. I hope, as they do,
that they will not be called upon
to adjudicate any more cases
during the current academic
year.
The Interim Judicial Body's
recommendations in the CIA
Demonstration Case are now be
fore me. Accordingly, I am in
viting each of the defendants in
that case individually to present
any facts he may wish to bring
to my attention before I decide
to accept, modify, or reject the
recommendations of the Interim
Judicial Body. Letters to this ef
fect are on their way to the de
fendants. Because of the public
interest in the case I should add
that I am asking each of the
defendants to let me know not
later than Friday, May 10, if he
wishes to accept this invitation.
Finally, because these issues
are so important, I have asked
that a meeting of the Academic
Council be convened for 4:15
p.m. on Wednesday, May 8, and
I have invited the President of
ASSU to appear at the meeting
with one other student officer
to make a presentation of their
views.

The University faces a mo
ment of trial because of a sim
plistic attack upon good-faith at
tempts which students and fac
ulty members are making to
solve a knotty problem of Uni
versity goverance. Issues this
complex are not going to be
resolved in White Memorial
Plaza, this noon or any other
noori. Issues this ambiguous are
not going to be resolved in ans
wer to an ultimatum.
For some time the orderly
and rational process of discus
sion and debate among students,
faculty members, and officers of
the University have been direct
ed toward solving the vexing
problem of how best to construct

a rule-making and judicial sys
tem that fits the needs of the
University today. I have some
reason to believe that those dis
cussions are now very close to
producing agreement on a sys
tem that will satisfy the criteria
of all but a very few zealots of
the far Left and far Right. I
have long been committed to
the proposition that the system
as finally evolved should ac
cord significant representation to
students in the rule-making and
judicial processes of the Univer
sity and also that it should ac
cord significant representation
to students in the selection of
student rule-makers and judges.
Contrary to what seems a wide

spread misconception, there has
never been any dispute on those
issues. The question has not
been "whether" but "how" and
"to what extent."
The issues themselves have
changed a good deal. When the
problem first arose and until
fairly recently, it was viewed
as a controversy about the judi
cial system. It has become clear
in the last few months, as the
result of hard work by the mem
bers of the Committee of Fif
teen, that we must simultane
ously resolve closely linked is
sues of rule-making and judging.
Two different kinds of bodies,
one to make rules and the oth
er to pass on alleged violations
of the rules, are now being dis

cussed in the Committee of Fif
teen. Both kinds of bodies are
intended to include students.
The rule-making issues are at
least as critical as the judicial
issues. Much as we may deplore
it, the Fundamental Standard
and the Honor Code no longer
suffice as the law of the Univer
sity. Much more detailed rules
are required. The Policy on Cam
pus Demonstrations cannot be
viewed as an isolated prescrip
tion but must be revised and
integrated into a comprehensive
code of student conduct.
I sympathize with the feelings
of frustration that are engender
ed when hard problems do not
yield easy solutions. I share
those feelings of frustration.
Even in an academic community,
discussion and debate must come
to an end and decisions must
be taken. My expectation is that
by the end of this quarter we will

problem of how best to construct

a rule-making and judicial sys
tem that fits the needs of the
University today. I have some
reason to believe that those dis
cussions are now very close to
producing agreement on a sys
tem that will satisfy the criteria
of all but a very few zealots of
the far Left and far Right. I
have long been committed to
the proposition that the system
as finally evolved should ac
cord significant representation to
students in the rule-making and
judicial processes of the Univer
sity and also that it should ac
cord significant representation
to students in the selection of
student rule-makers and judges.
Contrary to what seems a wide

spread misconception, there has
never been any dispute on those
issues. The question has not
been "whether" but "how" and
"to what extent."
The issues themselves have
changed a good deal. When the
problem first arose and until
fairly recently, it was viewed
as a controversy about the judi
cial system. It has become clear
in the last few months, as the
result of hard work by the mem
bers of the Committee of Fif
teen, that we must simultane
ously resolve closely linked is
sues of rule-making and judging.
Two different kinds of bodies,
one to make rules and the oth
er to pass on alleged violations
of the rules, are now being dis

cussed in the Committee of Fif
teen. Both kinds of bodies are
intended to include students.
The rule-making issues are at
least as critical as the judicial
issues. Much as we may deplore
it, the Fundamental Standard
and the Honor Code no longer
suffice as the law of the Univer
sity. Much more detailed rules
are required. The Policy on Cam
pus Demonstrations cannot be
viewed as an isolated prescrip
tion but must be revised and
integrated into a comprehensive
code of student conduct.
I sympathize with the feelings
of frustration that are engender
ed when hard problems do not
yield easy solutions. I share
those feelings of frustration.
Even in an academic community,
discussion and debate must come
to an end and decisions must
be taken. My expectation is that
by the end of this quarter we will
have agreement on revised struc
tures for rule-making and judg
ing that can go into operation
next September. The not in
considerable number of students,
faculty members, and University
officers who are working on the
problems will lend their best ef
forts to realizing this expecta
tion. If, however, that expecta
tion is not met, I shall put into
effect before Autumn Quarter a
provisional modification of the
judicial system that ensures sig
nificant student representation
at each level of the judicial
process, appellate as well as
original. And I shall recommend
to my successor that he under

take to Institute permanent
rule-making and judicial systems
not later than January 1, 1969.
The Interim Judicial Body, as
its name implies, was not visual
ized as a permanent solution to
the problem of constituting an
appellate tribunal. Its members
have rendered significant service
to the University under difficult
conditions. I hope, as they do,
that they will not be called upon
to adjudicate any more cases
during the current academic
year.
The Interim Judicial Body's
recommendations in the CIA
Demonstration Case are now be
fore me. Accordingly, I am in
viting each of the defendants in
that case individually to present
any facts he may wish to bring
to my attention before I decide
to accept, modify, or reject the
recommendations of the Interim
Judicial Body. Letters to this ef
fect are on their way to the de
fendants. Because of the public
interest in the case I should add
that I am asking each of the
defendants to let me know not
later than Friday, May 10, if he
wishes to accept this invitation.
Finally, because these issues
are so important, I have asked
that a meeting of the Academic
Council be convened for 4:15
p.m. on Wednesday, May 8, and
I have invited the President of
ASSU to appear at the meeting
with one other student officer
to make a presentation of their
views.
