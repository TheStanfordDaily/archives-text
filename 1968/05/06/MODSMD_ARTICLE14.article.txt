# Keystone Or Cancer?
## Okinawa Resents U.S. 
### NANCY ETTENHEIM 
Prof. Toshio Akamine, a na
tive Okinawan and currently a
member of the Washington
State University faculty, said
Friday that his island "may die
from the cancer (of U.S. pres
ence) before the cure can be
taken."
Akamine's remarks were part
of a two day conference on Ok
inawa at Stanford hailed by
the speakers as the first in a
series of dialogues between the
U.S. and Japan concerning sov
ereignty of the Ryukyu Islands,
of which Okinawa is the largest.
John Emerson, former Charge
d'AfTaires with the U.S. Em
bassy in Tokyo, noted that the
problems of Okinawa could be
resolved, "If political impera
tives are strong enough."
The question at issue was
whether Okinawa, now a U.S.
protwtorate by the Security
Treaty of 1952, should remain
as such, or revert to Japanese
sovereignty when the Treaty
comes up for renewal In 1970.
Emmerson summed up the
problem by using two slogans
which reflect the widely differ
ing views of the position of
Okinawa: Is the island the "key
stone of the Pacific" or "the
cancer of Japanese-U.S. rela
tions"?
In presenting the American
position, Emmerson acknowl
edged the importance of the
U.S. military bases on Okinawa,
which are now being used in
American efforts against North
Vietnam. However, despite the
usefulness of these bases, the
policy of an "eternal" U.S. pro
tectorate of the islands has been
slowly disappearing.
In discussing the problem of
reversion, Emmerson noted that
were the U.S. allowed to main
tain use of the bases on the is
lands, an administrative prob
lem would be presented. The
problem lies in the fact that the
bases are scattered throughout

the islands and would make
separation difficult because they
are not in one governable region.
Akamine pointed out that
Okinawans are pessimistic
and have little faith in any
possible change. "They want
to be freed from the U.S. gov
ernment and become Japanese
people," Akamine stated.
"Okinawa is too far away and
insignificant" for the U.S. citi
zens' concern, Akamine charged.
Yet, the islanders are also frus
trated with the Japanese govern
ment, because it has not pressed
for settlement in light of U.S.
"stalling."
The final speaker, Dr. Nobu

moto Ohama, an advisor to Jap
anese Prime Minister Sato on
Okinawan Problems charged
that problems of Okinawan wel
fare, housing, and education had
been treated as a matter of "sec
ondary importance" by the U.S.
Ohama also quietly noted
military might does not neces
sarily Indicate power in Asia,
and that there is a distrust
of American use of military
bases.
In closing, Ohama urged co
operation between the nations
involved and indicated hope that
the problem could be settled be
fore the Security Treaty expires
in 1970.

d'AfTaires with the U.S. Em
bassy in Tokyo, noted that the
problems of Okinawa could be
resolved, "If political impera
tives are strong enough."
The question at issue was
whether Okinawa, now a U.S.
protwtorate by the Security
Treaty of 1952, should remain
as such, or revert to Japanese
sovereignty when the Treaty
comes up for renewal In 1970.
Emmerson summed up the
problem by using two slogans
which reflect the widely differ
ing views of the position of
Okinawa: Is the island the "key
stone of the Pacific" or "the
cancer of Japanese-U.S. rela
tions"?
In presenting the American
position, Emmerson acknowl
edged the importance of the
U.S. military bases on Okinawa,
which are now being used in
American efforts against North
Vietnam. However, despite the
usefulness of these bases, the
policy of an "eternal" U.S. pro
tectorate of the islands has been
slowly disappearing.
In discussing the problem of
reversion, Emmerson noted that
were the U.S. allowed to main
tain use of the bases on the is
lands, an administrative prob
lem would be presented. The
problem lies in the fact that the
bases are scattered throughout

the islands and would make
separation difficult because they
are not in one governable region.
Akamine pointed out that
Okinawans are pessimistic
and have little faith in any
possible change. "They want
to be freed from the U.S. gov
ernment and become Japanese
people," Akamine stated.
"Okinawa is too far away and
insignificant" for the U.S. citi
zens' concern, Akamine charged.
Yet, the islanders are also frus
trated with the Japanese govern
ment, because it has not pressed
for settlement in light of U.S.
"stalling."
The final speaker, Dr. Nobu

moto Ohama, an advisor to Jap
anese Prime Minister Sato on
Okinawan Problems charged
that problems of Okinawan wel
fare, housing, and education had
been treated as a matter of "sec
ondary importance" by the U.S.
Ohama also quietly noted
military might does not neces
sarily Indicate power in Asia,
and that there is a distrust
of American use of military
bases.
In closing, Ohama urged co
operation between the nations
involved and indicated hope that
the problem could be settled be
fore the Security Treaty expires
in 1970.
Prof. Toshio Akamine, a na
tive Okinawan and currently a
member of the Washington
State University faculty, said
Friday that his island "may die
from the cancer (of U.S. pres
ence) before the cure can be
taken."
Akamine's remarks were part
of a two day conference on Ok
inawa at Stanford hailed by
the speakers as the first in a
series of dialogues between the
U.S. and Japan concerning sov
ereignty of the Ryukyu Islands,
of which Okinawa is the largest.
