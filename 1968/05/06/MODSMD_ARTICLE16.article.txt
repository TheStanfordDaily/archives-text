# 42 Picked For Fall
## Sponsors Reflect Diversity 
### 
The diversity of housing alter
natives for next year's fresh
men is reflected in the list of
new sponsors, concluded Steve
Tipton, chairman of the Spon
sor Selection Committee. Tipton,
who is presently head Wilbur
sponsor, released the names of
the 42 sponsors, 29 men and
13 women, this weekend, cul
minating two weeks of review
by the nine-member sponsor-ad
ministration committee.
The sponsors will live in the
eleven "all-freshmen" residences,
which are included in the new
housing configuration.
Pam Lawrence, head Roble

sponsor and co-chairman of the
selection committee, felt an in
dividual approach to each ap
plicant had been emphasized by
the review committee. She also
admitted certain limitations in
foreseeing next year's problems
because the physical situation
of freshmen houses has been
completely altered.
Tipton stressed the difficulties
inherent in such a selection proc
ess. "From approximately eighty
men — of whom more than half
were excellent applicants, we
were forced by lack of space to
choose 29." About 30 women
originally applied and were in
terviewed.

Applications and interviews
were arranged to permit stu
dents at overseas campuses to
participate, Tipton noted.
The selection committee was
composed of s : x sponsors, the
directors of Roble and Wilbur,
and one faculty resident. The en
tire group split into three revolv
ing interview boards to encour
age a more friendly attitude and
to combat some the problems
inherent in such a group, com
mented Miss Lawrence.
Tipton confirmed the efficiency
of these groups. "The small team
allowed us to get to know one
another and to engage in a con
versation with the applicant
rather than a cross-examina
tion."
However, all nine members of
the committee read the applica
tion forms, and participated in
a general caucus.
Another innovation of the se
lection board was the combining
of the men's and women's selec
tion committees. Tipton saw this
as a response to some of the
complaints concerning the ex
tremely subjective approach in
interviewing the women's group
last year.
He continued that selections
of this nature are always some
what subjective. However, the

focus had been on the applicant
rather than an established stan
dard or system of points.
"The group is marked by some
common characteristics, since
sponsoring asks these of anyone
— carefulness with persons;
openness and tolerance, not in
any complicated or catchphrase
sense, but simply from warmth
and understanding for other
people: being at home with one's
feelings as well as one's ideas;
and knowing how to play," he
stated.

Applications and interviews
were arranged to permit stu
dents at overseas campuses to
participate, Tipton noted.
The selection committee was
composed of s : x sponsors, the
directors of Roble and Wilbur,
and one faculty resident. The en
tire group split into three revolv
ing interview boards to encour
age a more friendly attitude and
to combat some the problems
inherent in such a group, com
mented Miss Lawrence.
Tipton confirmed the efficiency
of these groups. "The small team
allowed us to get to know one
another and to engage in a con
versation with the applicant
rather than a cross-examina
tion."
However, all nine members of
the committee read the applica
tion forms, and participated in
a general caucus.
Another innovation of the se
lection board was the combining
of the men's and women's selec
tion committees. Tipton saw this
as a response to some of the
complaints concerning the ex
tremely subjective approach in
interviewing the women's group
last year.
He continued that selections
of this nature are always some
what subjective. However, the

focus had been on the applicant
rather than an established stan
dard or system of points.
"The group is marked by some
common characteristics, since
sponsoring asks these of anyone
— carefulness with persons;
openness and tolerance, not in
any complicated or catchphrase
sense, but simply from warmth
and understanding for other
people: being at home with one's
feelings as well as one's ideas;
and knowing how to play," he
stated.

SERGIO MENDES — Frost Ampitheater will be
the scen«' of some swinging sounds this Sunday,
May 12, at 2 p.m. as the annual Con Home Con
cert presents Sergio Mendes and Brasil '66 in a

benefit for the Stanford Children's Convalescent
Hospital. Also appearing will be comedian Frank
VVelker and Flamenco guitarist Peter Evans.
The diversity of housing alter
natives for next year's fresh
men is reflected in the list of
new sponsors, concluded Steve
Tipton, chairman of the Spon
sor Selection Committee. Tipton,
who is presently head Wilbur
sponsor, released the names of
the 42 sponsors, 29 men and
13 women, this weekend, cul
minating two weeks of review
by the nine-member sponsor-ad
ministration committee.
The sponsors will live in the
eleven "all-freshmen" residences,
which are included in the new
housing configuration.
Pam Lawrence, head Roble

sponsor and co-chairman of the
selection committee, felt an in
dividual approach to each ap
plicant had been emphasized by
the review committee. She also
admitted certain limitations in
foreseeing next year's problems
because the physical situation
of freshmen houses has been
completely altered.
Tipton stressed the difficulties
inherent in such a selection proc
ess. "From approximately eighty
men — of whom more than half
were excellent applicants, we
were forced by lack of space to
choose 29." About 30 women
originally applied and were in
terviewed.

Applications and interviews
were arranged to permit stu
