# Frosh Win Handily
## Bears Polarize Trackmen, 100-45 
### BOB RUND 
Cal celebrated it's centennial
anniversary as an institution of
higher learning by smashing the
Stanford Indians 100-45 in Satur
day's track meet at Berkeley.
Coach Sam Bell's trackmen
grabbed 13 firsts in handing the
Indians their worst defeat ever
in a Big Meet. However the In
dians still hold the record for
the biggest margin of victory
when they dumped the Bears
101% to 43% in 1931.
Stanford fans didn't go home
completely disappointed as the
Frosh won the Little Big Meet
easily 92-53 by setting 4 records
in the process.
Randy White smashed the

440 Intermediate hurdle record
of 55.5 with a 54.0 clocking,
and teamed with Ki'vin Me-
Nair, Jim KaufTrnan and
Chuck Francis to set a new
440 relay record of 41.8.
Rick Tipton posted a new 120
high hurdle record of 14.f>, break
ing the old record held jointly
by Stanford's Steve Cortright
and Tom Kommers of 14.7.
Devone Smith's 880 record was
surpassed both by Pete Fairchild
and Duncan Macdonald. Fair
child held off Macdonald in the
final straight to win 1:52.2 to
1:52.5.
Cal's Gary Pennington set
the only varsity meet record
by upsetting heavily favored

Tom Colby with a 237-3 throw.
Colby who had a foul on a 240
plus throw could only manage
an allowable throw of 231-10.
Only in the distances where
the Tribe swept the mile, took
1-3 in the two, and a third in
the 880 did the Tribe do better
than expected.
Allen Sanford, running in
his first meet of the season,
won his second Big Meet mile
in leading the Stanfor dsweep.
Senior Jim Letterer, who was
largely responsible for the In
dians pulling away from the
Bear trackmen, took second
place honors with a 4:09.3
while Bob Anchondo posted a
lifetime best of 4:11.7.
Greg Brock continued his win
ning ways by kicking past Cal
record holder Bob Waldon with
a 220 remaining barely missed
the meet record with 8:53.3.
Stanford's chances would
have been much better if Jim
Ward and Andy Sears had
been able to run. The Indians
were swept in the 440 and 220.
The Tribe's bad fortune did
n't end with the loss of Ward
and Sears as Gene Washington
pulled up lame in the 440 relay,
and a very sore knee caused
Peter Boyce to go out of the
high jump at 6-6. Cal's Clarence
Johnson could only clear 6-8.
Lan Arnold, Stanford's Cana
dian record holder, jumped 51'2"
to win the triple iump. Th?
jump, which would have bee a
meet record, was disallowed be
cause of wind.
