# Late Rally Nips Cal
## 
### GARY CAVALLI 
Cal almost augmented a bril
liant performance in the Big
Meet with an upset baseball win
over Stanford Saturday, but the
Indians staged a four-run rally
in the ninth inning to pull out
a 6-4 win over the Bears.
The win moved Stanford (7-2)
into second place in the Pac-8
conference, one-and-a-half games
behind USC (9-1).
The Indians trailed 4-2 going
into the top of the ninth, but
Mark Marquess singled and
Mike Schomaker beat out a
bunt to put the tying runs on
base. Bob Gallagher and Bob
Boone followed with line-drive
singles to score both baserun
ners and knot the game at 4-all.
Then Rush Tweet, who had
earlier made an error which
led to a Cal run, lashed a two
run double down the left-field
line to give the Tribe a 6-3
advantage.
The Bears came back in the
bottom half of the final frame
to score another unearned run
off Harvey Shank on Tweet's
second bobble of the game. But
Shank retired pinch-hitter Irv
Baker and shortstop Dennis Dal
ton to preserve the win.
For Shank It was his ninth
win of the year aaginst one
setback. The senior righthand
er struck out five and walked
two, while limiting the Berke
ley nine to six hits.
Stanford scored in the first
inning when Bob Gallagher
blasted a home run over the
right-field fence.
The Tribe lead was short
lived, however, as Cal tallied
In both the fourth and fifth
frames to grab a 2-1 edge.
Dave Hagen doubled, moved
to third on a passed ball, and
scored on Bob Rebuschatis'
grounder to second-baseman

Chuck Williams in the fourth.
Dave Texdahl, who had singled
and advanced to third on a sacri
fice and an infield grounder,
came across with Cal's second
run when Tweet committed his
first error.
The Indians tied things up
In the sixth when Marquess
walked, stole second, and
scored on Schomaker's line
drive single over short.
Cal regained the whip hand
In the seventh when Texdahl
collected his second hit, was sac
rificed to second, moved to third
on pitcher Bill Kirkpatrick's
single, and scored on a sacrifice
fly by Ken Wiedeman.
That set the stage for Stan
ford's four-run blitz in the ninth,
which turned out to be decisive.
Tuesday the Indians host Sac
ramento State in a non-league
encounter, but Friday and Sat
urday travel to Los Angeles
for three crucial ballgames.
Friday the league-leading Tro
jans host Stanford at USC, while
the third-place UCLA Bruins (8-
3) engage the Tribe in a Satur
day doubleheader.
