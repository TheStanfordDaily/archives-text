# New Housing Plans Complicate Residence Draw Procedure
## 
### MARTHA HUMPHREY 
During the next three weeks
the general residence draw will
assign students to University
housing for next year.
Due to the extent of innova
tions in housing choice, the draw
will be different from those of
previous years.
The first step is the signing
of an intention card by all un
dergraduates presently living on
campus, whether they plan to
enter the draw or not. The cards
will be available May 6, 7, and
8 through the residence staffs
of the dormitories.
On the intention card the
student will indicate whether
or not he wishes to enter the
draw. The draw will not con
cern him if he indicates that
he will remain in his present
residence or leave university
campus housing for any reas
on including an overseas as
signment
If he is withdrawing from the
housing system and is not as
signed to an overseas campus,
his room deposit will be re
funded by request on the in
tention card.
Students must be registered
this quarter and have a valid
student body card to be eligible
for the draw. Students not at
tending this quarter may not
participate in the draw but
should contact the Undergrad
uate Housing Office in the Old
Union about an application for
housing.
Eligible students are in two
categories: 1) those currently in
University housing and 2) those
living off-campus or in fraterni
ties.
On campus students have top
priority in the draw. The Hous
ing Office expects few places
available for those in the sec
ond category.
Students may draw alone or in
groups of up to three of the
same sex. Those drawing in
groups may list joint prefer
ences first and then individual
ones if they wish. If group mem

bers have different priorities,
the group will possess the lower
priority.
The actual draw will take
place In two rounds. Those
who remain unasslgned or dis
pleased with their assign
ments at the end of the first
round will have another
chance in the second.
Students intending to draw
should come to the first floor
of the Old Union May 13-15 from
9 a.m.—noon and 1 p.m.—4:30
and 1) present student body
card to be punched; 2) pick
draw number; 3) complete pref
erence card; 4) complete con
tact card; and 5) turn both cards
in.
On the residence preference
cards students will list their
choices in order. If a student
wishes to live off-campus or in
a fraternity if he is not assigned
to a residence other than his
present one, he may put "off" as
his last choice.
Included in the choices will
be integrated (all four classes)
and upperclass men's housing,
integrated and upperclass wo
men's housing, and 13 co-educa

tional houses with and without
specific themes.
Because of the opening of
membership in the eating clubs
to women 50 spaces are reserved
in Toyon for women club mem
bers. Priority for space in Toy
on goes first to eating club mem
bers.
The results of the first
round will be announced on
May 20. A student's assign
ment will depend first on his
priority and then on the num
ber he draws. For example,
an off-campus student will be
assigned after all on-campus
students, regardless of his
drawn number.
A student can respond to the
results of round one in three
ways. First, he may accept the
place assigned to him by sign
ing a room agreement in the
Housing Office on the third floor
of the Old Union before June 1.
Secondly, in hope of realizing
a higher preference, he may re
main in the draw for the second
round by coming to the Housing
Office May 20-22 and filling out
a card.
Round two will be the final

determination of all housing
assignments of presently regis
tered undergraduates for next
fall. Those participating in the
second round may achieve a
higher preference or a space if
unassigned at the end of the
first round.
Results of this final round
will be available May 27. A stu
dent again may respond in three
ways. He may accept his final
assignment by signing a room
agreement before June 1, he
may withdraw from the resi
dence system, or he may request
the Housing Office to place his
name on a waiting list if still
unassigned.
Students who draw Into Uni
versity housing: must sign an
agreement obligating them to
remain in the residence sys
tem for all three quarters un
less an acceptable replacement
can be found or they leave the
University.
All upperclass women have
the option of moving off-campus
next fall. Anyone living off
campus may return to Univers
ity housing during the year
only as space is available.
