Playing an on-again-off-again
game, the Stanford Lacrosse
team crushed Claremont College
Saturday by a 10-2 count.
Midfielder Bob Hawkins spark
led for the undefeated Indians
with a four-goal output. Re
serves Ben Smith and Joel Bart
lett scored two goals apiece, with
attackmen Mark Teeter and
George Muser rounding out the
scoring for the Red.
The Indians jumped off to
a five goal lead in the first per
iod, then went ragged and scor
ed only once in the second per

iod, while Claremont got on
the scoreboard for the first time.
Stanford splurged again in the
third period with three goals
and settled for one goal in the
fourth.
Coach Don Ronayne called the
victory "a good win," but hopes
for a more consistent output
from his charges in next week's
big Air Force Academy game.
The game is the biggest game
in lacrosse for the season west
of the Appalachians. The In
dians begin intensive drills this
week for that contest.
