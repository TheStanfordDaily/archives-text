FROM THE HALLS OF PROTOZOA
This column, normally a treasure house of twinkly quips
and slapdash japery, has now been appearing in your
campus newspaper for fourteen years, and if I have
learned one thing in these fourteen long years, it is not to
try to be funny in the last column of the semester. With
final exams looming obscenely close, you don't want jokes;
you want help.
So today, foregoing levity, I give you a quick cram
course in the subject you are all flunking. I refer, of
course, to biology.
Biology is divided into several phylla, or classes. First
is the protozoa, or one-celled animal. Protozoa can be
taught simple things like bringing in the newspaper, but
when shopping for pets it is best to look for animals with
at least two cells, or even four if your yard has a fence
around it.

Another popular class of animals is the periphera—a
shadowy category that borders often on the vegetable.
Take, for example, the sponge. The sponge is definitely an
animal. The wash-cloth, on the other hand, is definitely not.
Next we come to the arthropoda, or insects. Most people
find insects unattractive, but actually there is exquisite
beauty in the insect world if you trouble to look. Take, for
instance, the lovely insect poems of William Cullen
Sigafoos— Tumbling Along with the Tumbling Tumblebug
and Fly Gently, Siveet Aphid and Gnats My Mother
Caught Me. Mr. Sigafoos, alas, has been inactive since the
invention of DDT.
Our next category is the mollusca—lobsters, shrimp, and
the like. Lobsters are generally found under rocky projec
tions on the ocean bottom. Shrimps are generally found in
a circle around a small bowl containing cocktail sauce.
Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades are generally
found at any counter where Personna Super Stainless
Steel Blades are sold.
I mention Personna Blades because the makers of Per
sonna Blades pay me to write this column, and they are
inclined to get edgy if I neglect to mention their product.
Some get double edgy and some single, for Personna
Blades come both in double edge style and Injector style.
Mind you, it is no burden for me to mention Personna,
for it is a blade that shaves quickly and cleanly, slickly and
keenly,scratchlessly and matchlessly.lt isadistinct pleas
ure to shave with Personna Blades and to write about
them but sometimes, I confess, I find it difficult to work
the commercial into a column. Some years ago, for ex
ample, I had the devil's own time working a Personna plug
into a column about Alexander the Great. The way I finally
managed it was to have Alexander say to the Oracle at
Delphi, "Oracle, I have tasted all the world's pleasures,
yet I am not content. Somehow I know there is a joy I have
missed." To which the Oracle replied, "Yes, Alexander,
there is such a joy—namely Personna Blades—but, alas for
you, they will not be invented for another 2500 years."
Whereupon Alexander fell into such a fit of weeping that
Zeus finally took pity and turned him into a hydrant . . .
W r ell sir, there is no question I sold a lot of Personnas with
this ingenious commercial, but the gang down at the
American Academy of Arts and Letters gave me a mighty
good razzing, you may be sure.
But I digress. Back to biology and the most advanced
phyllum of all-the chordata, or vertebrates. There are
two kinds of vertebrates: those with vertical backbones
and those with horizontal. Generally it is easy to tell them
apart. A fish, for instance, has a horizontal backbone, and
a man has a vertical backbone. But what if you run into
a fish that swims upright or a man who never gets out of
the sack? How do you tell them apart? Science struggled
with this sticky question for years before Sigafoos of
M.I.T. came up with his brilliant solution: offer the crea
ture a pack of Personna Blades. If it is a fish, it will refuse.
If it is homo sapiens, it will accept-and the more sapient,
the quicker.
And now you know biology. And now, for the fourteenth
time, aloha.

Blades come both in double edge style and Injector style.

the commercial into a column. Some years ago, for ex
ample, I had the devil's own time working a Personna plug
into a column about Alexander the Great. The way I finally
managed it was to have Alexander say to the Oracle at
Delphi, "Oracle, I have tasted all the world's pleasures,
yet I am not content. Somehow I know there is a joy I have
missed." To which the Oracle replied, "Yes, Alexander,
there is such a joy—namely Personna Blades—but, alas for
you, they will not be invented for another 2500 years."
Whereupon Alexander fell into such a fit of weeping that
Zeus finally took pity and turned him into a hydrant . . .
W r ell sir, there is no question I sold a lot of Personnas with
this ingenious commercial, but the gang down at the
American Academy of Arts and Letters gave me a mighty
good razzing, you may be sure.
But I digress. Back to biology and the most advanced
phyllum of all-the chordata, or vertebrates. There are
two kinds of vertebrates: those with vertical backbones
and those with horizontal. Generally it is easy to tell them
apart. A fish, for instance, has a horizontal backbone, and
a man has a vertical backbone. But what if you run into
a fish that swims upright or a man who never gets out of
the sack? How do you tell them apart? Science struggled
with this sticky question for years before Sigafoos of
M.I.T. came up with his brilliant solution: offer the crea
ture a pack of Personna Blades. If it is a fish, it will refuse.
If it is homo sapiens, it will accept-and the more sapient,
the quicker.
And now you know biology. And now, for the fourteenth

FROM THE HALLS OF PROTOZOA
This column, normally a treasure house of twinkly quips
and slapdash japery, has now been appearing in your
campus newspaper for fourteen years, and if I have
learned one thing in these fourteen long years, it is not to
try to be funny in the last column of the semester. With
final exams looming obscenely close, you don't want jokes;
you want help.
So today, foregoing levity, I give you a quick cram
course in the subject you are all flunking. I refer, of
course, to biology.
Biology is divided into several phylla, or classes. First
is the protozoa, or one-celled animal. Protozoa can be
taught simple things like bringing in the newspaper, but
when shopping for pets it is best to look for animals with
at least two cells, or even four if your yard has a fence
around it.

Another popular class of animals is the periphera—a
shadowy category that borders often on the vegetable.
Take, for example, the sponge. The sponge is definitely an
animal. The wash-cloth, on the other hand, is definitely not.
Next we come to the arthropoda, or insects. Most people
find insects unattractive, but actually there is exquisite
beauty in the insect world if you trouble to look. Take, for
instance, the lovely insect poems of William Cullen
Sigafoos— Tumbling Along with the Tumbling Tumblebug
and Fly Gently, Siveet Aphid and Gnats My Mother
Caught Me. Mr. Sigafoos, alas, has been inactive since the
invention of DDT.
Our next category is the mollusca—lobsters, shrimp, and
the like. Lobsters are generally found under rocky projec
tions on the ocean bottom. Shrimps are generally found in
a circle around a small bowl containing cocktail sauce.
Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades are generally
found at any counter where Personna Super Stainless
Steel Blades are sold.
I mention Personna Blades because the makers of Per
sonna Blades pay me to write this column, and they are
