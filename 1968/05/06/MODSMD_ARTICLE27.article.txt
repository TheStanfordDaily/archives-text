# Speech Dept War Play Opens On Wednesday
## 
### 
The futility and horror of war
is the theme of the spring quar
ter undergraduate production of
the Department of Speech and
Drama. "Serjeant Musgrave's
Dance," by John Arden, will be
performed in The Nitery at 8
p.m., May 8 through 12 and
May 17 and 18.
The play was first performed
in England in 1959 and marked
a new trend in the postwar, anti
establishment English theater.
A group of British Army desert
ers led by Serjeant Musgrave
arrive at an isolated coal mining
town in England. They have
come ostensibly to recruit, but
actually to teach the towns
people a bitter and violent les
son about war.

The soldiers are both mis
trusted and accepted with open
arms as each faction of the town
sees a way to use them. The
miners on strike see the soldiers
as strikebreakers while the
power structure of the town
sees a chance to end its troubles
by forcing the miners either to
enlist or to work at gun-point.
In a wild Bacchanale the sol
diers under Musgrave's sure and
powerful hand win total accept
ance by both groups. Musgrave,
driven by God, inexorably forces
the town to face his terrible
Dance of Death.
"Serjeant Musgrave's Dance"
will be directed by Glenn Can
non. Apeparing in the exclus
ively undergraduate cast will be
Bob Fletcher as Serjeant Mus
grave, with William Clebsch,
Ted Danson and John L. Stahlin
as his troop of deserters.
Tickets are $1 for students.
