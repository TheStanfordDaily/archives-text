## Racial Problems To Be Met 
### JOHN ALCORN 
The Human Relations Com
misssion, the mechanism which
according to Vice President Ly
man is officially empowered to
"deal with all allegations of ra
cial discrimination" in the Uni
versity, met for the first time
Friday afternoon under the lead
ership of its chairman, Profes
sor Byron Sher of the Law
School.
At its first meeting the Com
mission's main concern was to
define its operating procedures
as soon as possible in order to
start handling any case involv

ing charges of discrimination
which is brought before it.
The faculty-student Commis
sion is composed of nine mem
bers, seven of whom were se
lected by the University Ad
ministration, the other two be
ing nominated by the Black
Student Union and approved
by the Administration.
The Commission members,
who have all previously been
involved to a greater or lesser
extent with such matters, are:
Byron Sher, professor of law
and chairman of the Commis
sion. Sher recently served on

the Palo Alto City Council and
according to Associate Provost
Robert M. Rosenzweig, he "is
well known for his independence
of the University."
Anthropology Professor James
Gibbs, a Negro, who was a mem
ber of the Minnesota State Com
mission Against Discrimination
and the Minneapolis Fair Em
ployment Practices Commission
and is now the advisor to the
Black Student Union.
Oliver W. Holmes, a Western
Civ instructor and a Negro.
Donald Kennedy, professor of
biology. He has served on a

number of University commis
sions dealing with a wide range
of topics.
Professor Herbert Lederman
of psychiatry, who has been in
volved at the Medical School
with minority tutoring programs
and procuring summer jobs for
high school students of racial
minorities.
Mary Montle and Nate Kirk
man, both undergraduates. They
are both appointed by the Black
Student Union to the Commis
sion.
John Trimbur, an undergradu
ate history major, and Luis No
gales, a law student presently in
volved in forming a Mexican-
American campus organization.
The University official who
has had the most responsi
bility concerning cases of dis
crimination has been Associate
Provost Robert M. Rosen
zweig. He commented "our
hope is that as the Commis
sion begins to function normal
ly most of its work will con
sist of mediation."
Rosenzweig, not a member of
the Commission, pointed out
that "there really hasn't been
any single place in this Univer
sity where people can sit down
and discuss their problems." He
said the Human Relations Com
mission "will provide a formal
mechanism for hearing cases,
taking evidence and making
recommendations to the Presi
dent.
The Commission's wide juris
diction falls into two categories.
Under its charter the Commis
sion is empowered to "consider
complaints by persons within
or without the University who
allege that they have been sub
jected to racially discriminatory
treatment by the University or
by any employee of the Univer
sity acting within the scope of
his employment."
The first case that the Com
mission will probably deal with
under this area of its jurisdic
tion is the one involving the
East Palo Alto Day School's
charges against Tresidder Union.
Sher remarked â–  that the
school requested a meeting
\v it h the Administration,
which was held but that the
problem was not resolved.
He noted that "the school made
it clear they want to pursue
the matter and they will prob
ably want to bring the case be
fore the Human Relations
Commission as soon as it Is
ready to hear It."
He also said "the Black Stu
dent Union made it clear in its
demands that the Day School
wants a hearing when the Com
mission is ready to handle it."
Both Rosen/.weig and Sher
stated that plans for establish
ment of the Human Relations
Commission had been underway
for some time. Sher emphasized
that one reason for the plans
was to find an "appropriate
mechanism to handle cases like
(he Day School which was with
us even before the BSU de
mands."

The second responsibility of
the Human Relations Commis
sion, under its charter, is to
"conduct studies and make
recommendations on the Uni
versity's performance in the
area of minority group rela
tions."
Sher explained that "while our
first obligation is to consider the
cases that the brought before us,
we hope we'll have time to work
under this other area of juris
diction and be able to make use
ful suggestions for improving
the University's relationship
with members of minority
groups on campus and in neigh
boring communities."
Concerning the Commission's
Friday meeting, Sher said that

he "was very impressed by th
sensitivity of all the Commi
sion members to the difficult
questions that we're going to
have to deal with. We also made
great strides concerning oper
ating procedures."
He maintained that "a faculty
student commission with a sub
stantial portion of minority
group members is probably the
best forum to handle cases of
alleged discrimination," and add
ed, "all members of the commis
sion are anxious that people in
and close to the University com
munity be aware of our existence
so that if they do encounter
difficulties of a discriminatory
nature they will bring them to
our attention."
