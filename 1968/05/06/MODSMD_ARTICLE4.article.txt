## Reds Continue Saigon Terror 
### 
SAIGON (AP) —Enemy troops
fought inside Saigon and shelled
more than 120 provincial capi
tals, towns and allied military
installations Sunday in what
looked like a Viet Cong effort to
duplicate their Tet offensive that
caught government forces off
guard and swept the nation.
But the fresh drives lacked
punch and they seemed to fizzle
by nightfall.
"This was a poor substitute
for the original Tet offensive,"
said Brig. Gen. Winant Sidle, the
U.S. military information chief.
Captured enemy documents
last month tipped off allied com
mands to Viet Cong plans for at
tacks on Saigon and other cen
ters. South Vietnamese forces—
half of whom were on leave
when Tet began—were on 100
per cent alert this time.
The Viet Cong claimed "bril
liant victories" in a new nation
wide offensive in South Vietnam
Sunday.
The U.S. Command in Saigon
reported the first of 122 attacks

on Saigon, provincial capitals,
towns and allied military instal
lations began early Sunday
morning.
In Quant Tri province, the
broadcast claimed, more than
2,000 U.S. and South Vietnamese
troops were "wiped out" be
tween last Monday and Friday.
At least 22 U.S. and South
Vietnamese air bases were hit.
U.S. officers said the assaults
lacked heavy punch because of
depleted Viet Cong ranks re
sulting from 60,000 enemy killed
in the last three months, by U.S.
count.
• I\. Western Demands
EVANSTON, 111. (AP) — Ne
gro students claimed a victory
Sunday in an agreement with
Northwestern University offi
cials that ended a 38-hour en
campment in a business office
building.
Each side praised the other
for the atmosphere in which the
agreement achieved. The situa
tion was peaceful—even calm—
throughout the crisis.
The pact, in which the univer
sity capitulated to virtually all
of the Negroes' demands, was

announced Saturday night after
an eight-hour conference be
tween 10 students and 10 mem
bers of the administration.
The Negro students comprise
only a small percentage of the
6,400 undergraduate students on
the Evanston campus.
Under the settlement, the uni
versity agreed to:
—Issue an immediate state
ment acknowledging that North
western has been "a university
of the white establishment."
The statement said Northwest
ern has "had in common with
the white community in Ameri
ca, in greater or lesser degree,
the racist attitudes that have
prevailed historically in this so
ciety and which constitute the
most important problem of our
time . . . The university there
fore accepts the basic senti
ments expressed in the black
students' petitions."
• Vietnam Peace Talks
PARIS (AP) — U.S. and
North Vietnamese diplomats
are expected to reach agree
ment soon — perhaps Monday
— on the place in or near Paris
to hold preliminary talks on

Vietnam peace, informants said
Sunday.
The meetings are due to begin
Friday or shortly thereafter.
Because of student riots at the
University of Paris— the Sor
bonne—on Friday, the specula
tion was that the U.S.-North
Vietnamese meetings would be
held at a chateau or mansion
in the Paris suburbs.
The informants said word was
expected shortly from Washing
ton and presumably Hanoi on
which sites were acceptable.

HOUSTON, Tex. (AP)—Doc
tors at St. Luke's Hospital said
a second heart transplant was
being performed Sunday night.
A hospital spokesman said
the patient was James B. Cobb,
48, a saleman from Alexandria,
La.
The heart donor was identi
fied as William Joseph Bran
nan, 15. of Conroe, who was

Everett Claire Thomas, 47, of
Phoenix, received the first heart
transplant at St. Luke's Friday.
He was said to be in satisfactory
• Viet Cong Movements
WASHINGTON (AP) — Ad
ministration sources said Sun
flay North Vietnam is "taking
full advantage" of a U.S. bomb
ing limitation by increasing
threefold the southward move
ment of supplies and by sending
a startling numi.er of troops to
ward South Vietnam.
These sources said that, based
on the latest intelligence reports,
as many as 75,000 to 80,000
North Vietnamese soldiers have
been moved toward South Viet
nam in March and April.
This is almost as many as in
filtrated into South Vietnam all
of last year, the sources indicat
ed. Since 19R8 began, up to
100,000 North Vietnamese have
been sent southward, it was
said.
Truck tonnage along the sup
ply routes to South Vietnam
through Laos during April were
two or three times the average
in previous months, they report
ed.
• KucheFs Warning
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Sen.
Thomas Kuchel (R., Calif.), de
clared Sunday he supports law
and order in America—but not
through federal law enforce
ment, which he said "smacks of
a police state."
Kuchel, opposed in his reelec
tion campaign by fellow Repub
lican Max RafTerty, state school

chief, said in an interview that
"there are some in this cam
paign who have talked in terms
of a federal riot squad.
"I believe and have said that
smacks of a police state, and I
do not want that kind of a de
velopment in our country," he
added.
• British Transplant
LONDON (AP) — Frederick
West, 45, winked at his wife
Sunday and that was a sign
that Britain's first heart trans
plant patient is coming along
well.
A hospital bulletin reported
his condition was satisfactory
two days after receiving the
heart of an Irish laborer killed
in a fall. It added: "He is fol
lowing the normal postoperative
course."
His wife, Josephine, visited
the National Heart Hospital and
watched through a glass screen
as her husband, propped up in
bed. sipped a drink. He winked
and gave her a wave.
The hospital's senior regis
trar, John Gibbons, said: "He is
looking very well. He is wide
awake and can almost sit up.
He is feeling a lot better than he
has done for some time."
• U.N. Pot W'arning
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y.
(AP)—The U.N. Economic and
Social Council is about to grap
ple with a demand that it strike
a blow at the growing campaign
to legalize pot—otherwise
known as marijuana.
Some college students and
hippies in the United States
have carried on the campaign

with speeches, picket lines and
public marijuana-smoking par
ties, and some doctors have
backed up their argument that
it is a stimulant like alcohol.
But the council, made up of
27 U.N. members countries, has
a recommendation from its
Commission on Narcotic Drugs
that it pass a resolution against
the movement. It will take up
the proposal at its 44th session,
starting here Monday and run
ning to May 31.
The recommended resolution
asks that governments promote
research and advance additional
information on marijuana, also
called cannabis, and "deal ef
fectively with publicity which
advocates legalization cr toler
ance of the nonmedical use of
cannnabis as a harmless drug."
It urges that they "increase
their efforts to eradicate the
abuse of illicit traffic in
cannabis."
