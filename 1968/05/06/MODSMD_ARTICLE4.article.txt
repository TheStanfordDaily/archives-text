## Reds Continue Saigon Terror 
### 
SAIGON (AP) —Enemy troops
fought inside Saigon and shelled
more than 120 provincial capi
tals, towns and allied military
installations Sunday in what
looked like a Viet Cong effort to
duplicate their Tet offensive that
caught government forces off
guard and swept the nation.
But the fresh drives lacked
punch and they seemed to fizzle
by nightfall.
"This was a poor substitute
for the original Tet offensive,"
said Brig. Gen. Winant Sidle, the
U.S. military information chief.
Captured enemy documents
last month tipped off allied com
mands to Viet Cong plans for at
tacks on Saigon and other cen
ters. South Vietnamese forces—
half of whom were on leave
when Tet began—were on 100
per cent alert this time.
The Viet Cong claimed "bril
liant victories" in a new nation
wide offensive in South Vietnam
Sunday.
The U.S. Command in Saigon
reported the first of 122 attacks

on Saigon, provincial capitals,
towns and allied military instal
lations began early Sunday
morning.
In Quant Tri province, the
broadcast claimed, more than
2,000 U.S. and South Vietnamese
troops were "wiped out" be
tween last Monday and Friday.
At least 22 U.S. and South
Vietnamese air bases were hit.
U.S. officers said the assaults
lacked heavy punch because of
depleted Viet Cong ranks re
sulting from 60,000 enemy killed
in the last three months, by U.S.
count.
• I\. Western Demands
EVANSTON, 111. (AP) — Ne
gro students claimed a victory
Sunday in an agreement with
Northwestern University offi
cials that ended a 38-hour en
campment in a business office
building.
Each side praised the other
for the atmosphere in which the
agreement achieved. The situa
tion was peaceful—even calm—
throughout the crisis.
The pact, in which the univer
sity capitulated to virtually all
of the Negroes' demands, was

announced Saturday night after
an eight-hour conference be
tween 10 students and 10 mem
bers of the administration.
The Negro students comprise
only a small percentage of the
6,400 undergraduate students on
the Evanston campus.
Under the settlement, the uni
versity agreed to:
—Issue an immediate state
ment acknowledging that North
western has been "a university
of the white establishment."
The statement said Northwest
ern has "had in common with
the white community in Ameri
ca, in greater or lesser degree,
the racist attitudes that have
prevailed historically in this so
ciety and which constitute the
most important problem of our
time . . . The university there
fore accepts the basic senti
ments expressed in the black
students' petitions."
• Vietnam Peace Talks
PARIS (AP) — U.S. and
North Vietnamese diplomats
are expected to reach agree
ment soon — perhaps Monday
— on the place in or near Paris
to hold preliminary talks on

Vietnam peace, informants said
Sunday.
The meetings are due to begin
Friday or shortly thereafter.
Because of student riots at the
University of Paris— the Sor
bonne—on Friday, the specula
tion was that the U.S.-North
Vietnamese meetings would be
held at a chateau or mansion
in the Paris suburbs.
The informants said word was
expected shortly from Washing
ton and presumably Hanoi on
which sites were acceptable.
• Eleventh Transplant
HOUSTON, Tex. (AP)—Doc
tors at St. Luke's Hospital said
a second heart transplant was
being performed Sunday night.
A hospital spokesman said
the patient was James B. Cobb,
48, a saleman from Alexandria,
La.
The heart donor was identi
fied as William Joseph Bran
nan, 15. of Conroe, who was
killed in a motorcycle accident
Sunday evening.
The spokesman did not say
when the operation began but
