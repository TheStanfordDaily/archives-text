# Stanford's Heart Patient Dies Following Initial Improvement
## 
### 
BULLETIN:
Joseph Rizor, the world's
eighth heart transplant pa
tient, died at 8:30 Sunday
night because his heart was
not getting enough oxygen,
doctors at Stanford Medical
Center announced.
Stanford's second heart trans
plant patient is reported in
slightly improved condition al
most four days after receiving

the heart of a 43-year old San
Carlos man.
The patient, Joseph Rizor,
has been suffering from a lung
condition. At a press conference
Saturday Dr. Norman Shumway,
the operating physician, said
doctors hoped that the lung
trouble would clear itself up in
two or three days.
For a short time yesterday
Rizor was off the respirator
and was speaking with doc
tors. He is on a liquid diet of
soups and juices and has ex
pressed a desire for "some
thing stronger than apple
juice" to drink. His wife also
visited him yesterday morn
ing.
In his press conference Sat
urday Shumway revealed that
he is planning another trans
plant, this one on a seven-year
old boy. At his conference Shum
way said that in future opera
tions he would concentrate on
younger recipients "where the
greater salvage is."
Thursday's operation followed
the same format as January's.
Hospital officials Friday re
leased information about the
donor. At first the information
had been withheld, but after at
least two newspapers failed to
follow the wishes of the donor's
family the hospital released bio
graphical data.

The donor was Rudy F. An
derson, an employee of Paci
fic Telephone Company. An
derson, 43, suffered a massive:
brain hemorrhage Monday
night and died early Thurs
day morning.
Anderson's wife, Margart,
said Friday, "I know he'd be
very proud right now of what's
happening at Stanford. He be
lieved so in life." Anderson was
born in Oakland and lived in the
Bay Area most of his life. He is
survived by his wife and two
children aged 14 and 10.
Thursday's operation was fol
lowed by two other heart trans
plants, one in Houston and one
in London. At last word, both
patients are reported in good
condition.
Anderson also gave his two
kidneys for transplant into two
other patients at Stanford. Both
recipients were last reported in
good condition.
After the donor's heart was
implanted in Rizor it was
started by an electric shock,
as in the first operation. In
this case the donor's heart)
was two-thirds the size of the
recipient's. In Shunnvay's first
operation the donor's heart
was only one-tliird the size of
the recipients which caused
some concern.

derson, 43, suffered a massive:
brain hemorrhage Monday
night and died early Thurs
day morning.
Anderson's wife, Margart,
said Friday, "I know he'd be
very proud right now of what's
happening at Stanford. He be
lieved so in life." Anderson was
born in Oakland and lived in the
Bay Area most of his life. He is
survived by his wife and two
children aged 14 and 10.
Thursday's operation was fol
lowed by two other heart trans
plants, one in Houston and one
in London. At last word, both
patients are reported in good
condition.
Anderson also gave his two
kidneys for transplant into two
other patients at Stanford. Both
recipients were last reported in
good condition.
After the donor's heart was
implanted in Rizor it was
started by an electric shock,
as in the first operation. In
this case the donor's heart)
was two-thirds the size of the
recipient's. In Shunnvay's first
operation the donor's heart
was only one-tliird the size of
the recipients which caused
some concern.

tion to run for ASSIJ president as write-in candidate, Mrs. Cissie
Bonini, poses here with her family of seven children and her hus
band, who is an associate professor of statistics in the Graduate
School of Business. Mrs. Bonini seeks to "put the election back in
its proper perspective" by stressing the principles of "motherhood,
the America Hag, apple pie, and closer relationships between fac
ulty and students. The debates scheduled Friday and Monday
between the ASSU candidates have been displaced by the continuing
controversy over judicial reform.
BULLETIN:
Joseph Rizor, the world's
eighth heart transplant pa
tient, died at 8:30 Sunday
night because his heart was
not getting enough oxygen,
doctors at Stanford Medical
Center announced.
Stanford's second heart trans
plant patient is reported in
slightly improved condition al
most four days after receiving

the heart of a 43-year old San
Carlos man.
The patient, Joseph Rizor,
has been suffering from a lung
condition. At a press conference
Saturday Dr. Norman Shumway,
the operating physician, said
doctors hoped that the lung
trouble would clear itself up in
two or three days.
For a short time yesterday
Rizor was off the respirator
and was speaking with doc
tors. He is on a liquid diet of
soups and juices and has ex
pressed a desire for "some
thing stronger than apple
juice" to drink. His wife also
visited him yesterday morn
ing.
In his press conference Sat
urday Shumway revealed that
he is planning another trans
plant, this one on a seven-year
old boy. At his conference Shum
way said that in future opera
tions he would concentrate on
younger recipients "where the
greater salvage is."
Thursday's operation followed
the same format as January's.
Hospital officials Friday re
leased information about the
donor. At first the information
had been withheld, but after at
least two newspapers failed to
follow the wishes of the donor's
family the hospital released bio
graphical data.

The donor was Rudy F. An
derson, an employee of Paci
fic Telephone Company. An
derson, 43, suffered a massive:
brain hemorrhage Monday
night and died early Thurs
day morning.
