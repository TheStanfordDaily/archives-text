## Faculty Urges Student Peace 
### 
Editor, The Daily :
On the afternoon of Monday,
May 6, serious damage may be
done to the generally successful
pattern of student-faculty-admin
istration negotiation over Uni
versity government that has pre
vailed at Stanford for several
years. I hope that damage can
be averted.
I say the pattern has been suc
cessful with full recognition that
complete agreement has not
been reached on all subjects of
negotiation and that the duration
of negotiations has produced
much frustration on all sides of
the table. But these are inevit
able characteristics of negotia
tion over complex and emotion
laden issues. The critical factor
is that agreement has been
reached on many subjects, and
progress toward agreement has
boon made on others. Only per
sons so far removed from real
ity as to suppose the unilateral
dictation by one constituency is
a viable alternative to negotia
tion could say that past efforts
have failed.
All constituencies deserve cre
dit for the fact that channels of
communication have remained
open and that Stanford has been
able to avoid the massive dis
ruption and violence that has oc
curred at other universities.
Within the past few weeks the
administration has demonstrated
its receptivity to reasonable stu
dent requests even when they
are presented with offensive ar
rogance and accompanied by
"deadlines."
The process of negotiation
necessarily contemplates that
any side is free to reject unrea
sonable demands, particularly
demands that violate the sub
stance of agreements previously
reached. On Friday the Univer
sity was confronted with such
a set of demands; and they will
be rejected.
A small group, led by a stu
dent whose sole claim to recog
nition is that he has twice been
convicted of violating University
regulations, made the following
five demands: (1) that the re
cent convictions stemming from
the CIA disruption be disregard
ed; (2) that the IJB be dissolve
ed; (3) that the two years of
negotiations by the Committee
of 15 be scrapped by the ap
pointment of a new judicial body
containing a majority of stu
dents; (4) that the new body
hear only appeals from students,
thus making the rulings of the
all-student council dispositive
whenever it rules in favor of a
student; and (5) that the Univer

sity surrender on the first four
demands in public at high noon
Monday.
Friday afternoon a group
of faculty members, including
members of the Executive
Committee, the Committee on
University Policy and other
faculty committee chairmen,
met to discuss problems of
University judicial machinery.
For part of that meeting we
were joined by the principal
ASSU officers and two of the 1
convicted demonstrators. At
that time one or more of the
students present agreed ex
pressly, and none disagreed ex
pressly, with each of the fol
lowing propositions: that the
existence of the IJB was con
sistent with the Tripartite
Agreement on which the pres
ent judicial structure and the
Committee of 15 are based;
that to establish the new per
manent judicial body demand
ed would be in violation of the
Tripartite Agreement; the
the only justification for deny
ing recognition to the IJB
was frustration over the dur-j
ation of C-15 negotiations;
that no accusation was being
made that any member of the
C-15 had failed to bargain
earnestly and in good faith J
and that there was no genuine
expectation on their part that
the University would accept a
judicial body containing a ma
jority of students.
In substance these students
conceded that the demands they
were presenting, under a dead
line, were in violation of
previous agreements and that
they did not expect the demands
to be accepted. They were pre
sented, in short, not with hope
of acceptance but so that they
would be rejected.
On Monday an important ques
tion may be answered. How
many students at the University
are willing to support such a
set of demands? In any sizeable
community one must expect and
cope with some number of per
sons who seek trouble, and even
violence, for its own sake or for
their own personal aggrandize
ment. Demonstrating in support
of demands known to be unac
ceptable is a tactic of such per
sons. If they are very few in
number, the processes of ne
gotiation and accommodation
can continue. If their number is
large, such processes fail; and
the community must accept its
destruction or adopt govern
ment by dictation and force.

C'l 5 Chairman Defends
Demonstrations Policy
Editor, The Daily:
Many members of the Stan
ford community are understand
ably upset by the decision of the
IJB in the case of the CIA dem
onstrators. It is imperative, how
ever, that we keep a sense of
proportion and that our acts in
the coming days be calculated to
facilitate solutions to our diffi
culties not exacerbate them.
From my limited perspective
as Chairman of the Committee
of Fifteen, I can make the fol
lowing assertions:
1. The University Policy on
Demonstrations, while perhaps
not perfect in detail, protects
rather than diminishes free
dom.
2. This policy was not de
nounced by LASSU when it was
promulgated and was in effect
when the CIA demonstrations
took place.
3. Participants in the negotia
tions that led to the Tri-Partlte
Agreement assure me that it
was then understood that Judic
ial Council would enforce uni
versity policy. It was in ex
change for this concession that
students were for the first time
given exclusive original juris
diction over judicial matters.
4. I do not know how long
an "interim" is, but I do know
that failure of the Committee of
Fifteen to reach agreement over
the past two years on a student
faculty appeals body has not
been due to intransigance on
the part of the Administration
alone.
The negotiations of the Com
mittee of Fifteen this year have
been encouragingly fruitful. Our
work was delayed by the failure
of President Lyman to appoint
student members to the Commit
tee during autumn quarter, but
we have made progress in every
session since the Committee be
gan its work in January. While
we have not submitted final pro
posals to President Sterling, our
negotiations with him have been
friendly and productive.
It is my personal belief that
we will be able to offer pro
posals that will move Stanford
decisively in the direction of
community government in
which faculty and students will
together play an important role
in formulating as well as en
forcing the rules that will gov
ern the community. It would be
a tragedy, I think, if the events
of the next few days were to in
flame passions to the point that
agreement on an entirely new
set of institutional arrange
ments becomes impossible.

Behind The Quadrille
Hide Harsh Realities
Editor, The Daily:
I have just heard of the lynch
law decision of the Interim Ju
dicial Body on the CIA case.
Many students are no doubt now
attempting to decide whether
or not to actively oppose the
IJB and the University structure
of goverance which a presiden
tially appointed appeals board
faithfully reflects.
Of course I personally feci
that students should vigorously
combat the existing system of
University administration. I
espouse this view not as a re
sult of the recent outrageous
IJB decision, but because the
IJB itself is a perfectly accur
ate representation of how the
administration has systematic
ally excluded students from any

positions of power and resopnsi
bility over student affairs.
The I in IJB stands for the
word interim. Interim is a use
ful word for those in the admin
istration who hope that student
demands for such radical inno
vations as trial by jury of one's
peers are temporaray and spor
adic outbursts of fickle youth.
The IJB has been interim for
no less than three years. Dur
ing those three years, I was
personally involved in several
efforts to establish a plain old
JB with half-and-half student
faculty representation.
Stanford's judicial system is
a permanent action item on the
agenda of the Committee of 15
(C-15). It has been an action
item for at least the 2 and a-half
years during which I was a
member of that Committee. I
would estimate that at least 150
man hour's of C-15's time has
been spent in earnest blather
about the need to consider cau
tiously and seriously such "rad
ical" proposals as student par
ticipation on the judicial board.
The administration's delega
tion to C-15 is thoroughly ac
quainted with the issue, as are
the various faculty representa
tives on the committee. Many
of these same individuals pro
test, however, that the issue of
student representation is a new
and risky idea each of the six
or eight times that the matter
has been pressed for a decision.
Behind this intricate quadrille
are harsh realities which I will
now enjoy expressing. The sen
tence passed on the CIA dem
onstrators is vicious, but it is no
more brutal that the year to
year, day to day treatment of
students at Stanford whenever
they rock the boat. Every time
an interim solution is adopted
(which, is the same as saying
that students are barred from
choosing their own representa
tives to such vital panels as the
IJB or SES or any presidential
advisory board), that patroniz
ing dean or provost says, "Golly
gee. I wish we could do this be
cause I'm really on your side,
but we're in a bind." What he is
really saying is "Go to hell."
TOM FORESTENZER
Faculty Asks Patience
In Future Discussions
Editor, The Daily:
We address the Stanford com
munity as chairman of two com
mittees elected by the faculty as
a whole. Great issues are at
stake that can be settled to the
satisfaction of students, faculty,
and administration. To accomp
lish what is possible, time is re
quired and reasonable discussion
must be continued. Open discus
sions in White Plaza, and meet
ings like that between repre
sentatives of students, faculty,
and administration last Friday
afternoon, have their parts to
play in arriving at settlements.
Demands accompanied by dead
lines, sit-ins, and forcible dis
ruption of academic activities do
not; they are destructive of the
good will that exists in the over
whelming majority of the three
constituencies.
We are confident that we rep
resent nearly all of our faculty
colleagues in urging patience,
and abstention from the use of
force. We believe that any other
course will merely delay the in
stitution of the changes in stu
dent-faculty-administration rela
tionships that all agree are
needed and toward which all
are working.
