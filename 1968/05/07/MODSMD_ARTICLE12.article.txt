# Letters To The Editor
## Demands Are Wrong Tactic 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
False issues become real is
sues leading to conflict when the
readiness to accomodate is miss
ing. Because there is as yet no
substantial basis for conflict and
because the cost to all of us
from a Columbia-type confronta
tion will far outweigh any bene
fits we can derive from it, I
would add my voice to others
which now urge the crucial im
portance of that willingness to
accommodate.
I served as the faculty mem
ber of the Student Judicial
Council at the time the CIA
case was tried. I voted with all
the other members against any
penalty; unlike some on the
Council, I did NOT even find
the defendents guilty of an in
fringement of the Fundamental
Standard. But this does not
mean that I believe that the
IJB's decision was illegal or im
moral. (It was, if the account
in the Daily was correct, bad
mannered; the IJB hardly show
ed that respect for the opinions
of the rest of the University
that it would presumably like to
have from them for its opinion
—otherwise, it would have at
least taken the trouble to say
why it overturned the Council's
decision. But rudeness is not a
crime.)
In accordance with the Tripar
tite Agreement, it has the right
to reject the Council's judgment
and to impose its own. And that
judgment should command sup
port from Bircher-like types
who believe that impeaching
Earl Warren makes sense.
Granting this, it seems to me
that the defendants cannot de
mand from the President a re
jection of the IJB's decision;
they can only appeal for a re
laxation of the penalty, and I
am sure that many members of
the Faculty would support their
appeal. And that should be
enough.
The IJB has been Interim for
far too long. Impatience with
the procedure required to grind
out a revised Appeals Body is
understandable. But, again, this
impatience should not have to
create serious conflict. The Com
mittee of Fifteen is presumably
still at work; surely it has now
received the signal; a few more
days or even weeks of waiting
to see their recommendations
will not hurt anyone. And it is
not unreasonable to expect a far
better solution from that group
than from the hastily put
together demands assembled
last week-end.
It makes sense at a time like
this to explore all possibilities
for accommodation. I believe
they exist and that failure to try
to exploit them is now the crim
inal act.

Editor, The Daily:
In his letter to the Daily of
May 6, Professor William F.
Baxter records that "Friday af
ternoon a group of faculty mem
bers . . . met to discuss prob
lems of University judicial ma
chinery," and "were joined by
the principal ASSU officers and
two of the convicted demonstra
tors."
Professor Baxter claims that
"one or more of the students

present agreed expressly, and
none disagreed expressly" with
certain propositions which he
believes to be inconsistent with
the "demands they (sic) were
presenting." . . .
Some of the propositions cited
hy Professor Baxter, because of
their irrelevancy to what was
understood to be the purpose
of the meeting (neither the pres
entation of demands nor a dis
cussion of the issues involved
in the CIA protest case), were, in
fact, undisputed. To own the
delusion that when no one both
ers to reply to one's expression
of an opinion it is because every
body share the opinion must
indeed, especially for a lawyer
and scholar, be the height of
bliss.
When, however, Professor
Baxter gave a reason for be
lieving "that the existence of the
IJB was consistent with the Tri
partite Agreement," I said that
I did not believe that that prop
osition followed from the reason
given.
I do not recall any explicit
statement "that to establish the
new permanent judicial body de
manded would be in violation of
the Tripartite Agreement." I do
agree that it is arguable that to
do so would violate the Agree
ment. It is highly arguable, on
the other hand, that the propos
ed Student-Faculty Board is en
tirely consistent with the spirit
of the Agreement and that the
failure of the Committee of Fif
teen to agree on such a Board
in two years of negotiations,
however earnest and in good
faith, is inconsistent with the
spirit of the Agreement. Further,
it seems to me that the Com
mittee's failure is a direct cause
of the current judicial crisis and
that that fact justifies by-pass
ing the Committee in order to
create such a Board and there
by partly to resolve the crisis.
Cesare Massarenti and per
haps another student indicated
"frustration over the duration
of C-15 negotiations," but no
one suggested such frustration
"was the only (or any) justifica
tion for denying recognition to
the IJB." If Professor Baxter is
interested in other justifications,
I can cite a few, including what
now seems to me to be a com
pelling justification: that the IJB
on the basis of minimal evidence
recommended disproportionate
disciplinary action against sev
en students, and, after one day's
deliberation, in one sentence
overruled the 10,000 word deci
sion, made after a week of de
liberation (not to say violent ar
gument), of the ASSU Judicial
Council. . . .

Student Demands Only-
Hurt Their Own C.ause
Editor, The Daily:
The prospect of a sit-in over
the judicial controversy can only
be dispiriting to those of us on
the faculty who desire to see
increased student participation
in decision-making at Stanford.
Such a tactic goes a long way
toward hardening the opinion
that students are too immature
to take meaningful responsibil
ity for their decisions. A tiny
minority can quickly undo all
that the more mature have al
ready done. Ecclesiastes surely
had it right: "Dead flies make
the perfumer's oil stink: so a
little folly outweighs wisdom
and honor."
The difference between this
situation and that dramatized by
the Black Students Union is that
the latter have suffered long
enough under systematic dis
crimination. The present in
stance by comparison is ludic
rous, and I, for one, urge those
who wish to see a speedy reso
lution of the judicial problems
to give their energy to encour
aging the efforts of the Com
mittee of Fifteen rather than to
fomenting meaningless disrup
tion of the University.

Student Demands Only-
Hurt Their Own C.ause
Editor, The Daily:
The prospect of a sit-in over
the judicial controversy can only
be dispiriting to those of us on
the faculty who desire to see
increased student participation
in decision-making at Stanford.
Such a tactic goes a long way
toward hardening the opinion
that students are too immature
to take meaningful responsibil
ity for their decisions. A tiny
minority can quickly undo all
that the more mature have al
ready done. Ecclesiastes surely
had it right: "Dead flies make
the perfumer's oil stink: so a
little folly outweighs wisdom
and honor."
The difference between this
situation and that dramatized by
the Black Students Union is that
the latter have suffered long
enough under systematic dis
crimination. The present in
stance by comparison is ludic
rous, and I, for one, urge those
who wish to see a speedy reso
lution of the judicial problems
to give their energy to encour
aging the efforts of the Com
mittee of Fifteen rather than to
fomenting meaningless disrup
tion of the University.
EDWIN M. GOOD
Associate Professor of
Religion and Hebrew
Editor, The Daily:
False issues become real is
sues leading to conflict when the
readiness to accomodate is miss
ing. Because there is as yet no
substantial basis for conflict and
because the cost to all of us
from a Columbia-type confronta
tion will far outweigh any bene
fits we can derive from it, I
would add my voice to others
which now urge the crucial im
portance of that willingness to
accommodate.
I served as the faculty mem
ber of the Student Judicial
Council at the time the CIA
case was tried. I voted with all
the other members against any
penalty; unlike some on the
Council, I did NOT even find
the defendents guilty of an in
fringement of the Fundamental
Standard. But this does not
mean that I believe that the
IJB's decision was illegal or im
moral. (It was, if the account
in the Daily was correct, bad
mannered; the IJB hardly show
ed that respect for the opinions
of the rest of the University
that it would presumably like to
have from them for its opinion
—otherwise, it would have at
least taken the trouble to say
why it overturned the Council's
decision. But rudeness is not a
crime.)
In accordance with the Tripar
tite Agreement, it has the right
to reject the Council's judgment
and to impose its own. And that
judgment should command sup
port from Bircher-like types
who believe that impeaching
Earl Warren makes sense.
Granting this, it seems to me
that the defendants cannot de
mand from the President a re
jection of the IJB's decision;
they can only appeal for a re
laxation of the penalty, and I
am sure that many members of
the Faculty would support their
appeal. And that should be
enough.
The IJB has been Interim for
far too long. Impatience with
the procedure required to grind
out a revised Appeals Body is
understandable. But, again, this
impatience should not have to
create serious conflict. The Com
mittee of Fifteen is presumably
still at work; surely it has now
received the signal; a few more
days or even weeks of waiting
to see their recommendations
will not hurt anyone. And it is
not unreasonable to expect a far
better solution from that group
than from the hastily put
together demands assembled
last week-end.
It makes sense at a time like
this to explore all possibilities
for accommodation. I believe
they exist and that failure to try
to exploit them is now the crim

LORIE TRASHIS
Professor, Economics
New Appeals Board
Would Be Justified
Editor, The Daily:
In his letter to the Daily of
May 6, Professor William F.
Baxter records that "Friday af
ternoon a group of faculty mem
bers . . . met to discuss prob
lems of University judicial ma
chinery," and "were joined by
the principal ASSU officers and
two of the convicted demonstra
tors."
Professor Baxter claims that
"one or more of the students

present agreed expressly, and
none disagreed expressly" with
certain propositions which he
believes to be inconsistent with
the "demands they (sic) were
presenting." . . .
Some of the propositions cited
hy Professor Baxter, because of
their irrelevancy to what was
understood to be the purpose
of the meeting (neither the pres
entation of demands nor a dis
cussion of the issues involved
in the CIA protest case), were, in
fact, undisputed. To own the
delusion that when no one both
ers to reply to one's expression
of an opinion it is because every
body share the opinion must
indeed, especially for a lawyer
and scholar, be the height of
bliss.
When, however, Professor
Baxter gave a reason for be
lieving "that the existence of the
IJB was consistent with the Tri
partite Agreement," I said that
I did not believe that that prop
osition followed from the reason
given.
I do not recall any explicit
statement "that to establish the
new permanent judicial body de
manded would be in violation of
the Tripartite Agreement." I do
agree that it is arguable that to
do so would violate the Agree
ment. It is highly arguable, on
the other hand, that the propos
ed Student-Faculty Board is en
tirely consistent with the spirit
of the Agreement and that the
failure of the Committee of Fif
teen to agree on such a Board
in two years of negotiations,
however earnest and in good
faith, is inconsistent with the
spirit of the Agreement. Further,
it seems to me that the Com
mittee's failure is a direct cause
of the current judicial crisis and
that that fact justifies by-pass
ing the Committee in order to
create such a Board and there
by partly to resolve the crisis.
Cesare Massarenti and per
haps another student indicated
"frustration over the duration
of C-15 negotiations," but no
one suggested such frustration
"was the only (or any) justifica
tion for denying recognition to
the IJB." If Professor Baxter is
interested in other justifications,
I can cite a few, including what
now seems to me to be a com
pelling justification: that the IJB
on the basis of minimal evidence
recommended disproportionate
disciplinary action against sev
en students, and, after one day's
deliberation, in one sentence
overruled the 10,000 word deci
sion, made after a week of de
liberation (not to say violent ar
gument), of the ASSU Judicial
Council. . . .

fact, undisputed. To own the
delusion that when no one both
ers to reply to one's expression
of an opinion it is because every
body share the opinion must
indeed, especially for a lawyer
and scholar, be the height of
bliss.
When, however, Professor
Baxter gave a reason for be
lieving "that the existence of the
IJB was consistent with the Tri
partite Agreement," I said that
I did not believe that that prop
osition followed from the reason
given.
I do not recall any explicit
statement "that to establish the
new permanent judicial body de
manded would be in violation of
the Tripartite Agreement." I do
agree that it is arguable that to
do so would violate the Agree
ment. It is highly arguable, on
the other hand, that the propos
ed Student-Faculty Board is en
tirely consistent with the spirit
of the Agreement and that the
failure of the Committee of Fif
teen to agree on such a Board
in two years of negotiations,
however earnest and in good
faith, is inconsistent with the
spirit of the Agreement. Further,
it seems to me that the Com
mittee's failure is a direct cause
of the current judicial crisis and
that that fact justifies by-pass
ing the Committee in order to
create such a Board and there
by partly to resolve the crisis.
Cesare Massarenti and per
haps another student indicated
"frustration over the duration
of C-15 negotiations," but no
one suggested such frustration
"was the only (or any) justifica
tion for denying recognition to
the IJB." If Professor Baxter is
interested in other justifications,
I can cite a few, including what
now seems to me to be a com
pelling justification: that the IJB
on the basis of minimal evidence
recommended disproportionate
disciplinary action against sev
en students, and, after one day's
deliberation, in one sentence
overruled the 10,000 word deci
sion, made after a week of de
liberation (not to say violent ar
gument), of the ASSU Judicial
Council. . . .

Student Demands Only-
Hurt Their Own C.ause
Editor, The Daily:
The prospect of a sit-in over
the judicial controversy can only
be dispiriting to those of us on
the faculty who desire to see
increased student participation
in decision-making at Stanford.
Such a tactic goes a long way
toward hardening the opinion
that students are too immature
to take meaningful responsibil
ity for their decisions. A tiny
minority can quickly undo all
that the more mature have al
ready done. Ecclesiastes surely
had it right: "Dead flies make
the perfumer's oil stink: so a
little folly outweighs wisdom
and honor."
The difference between this
situation and that dramatized by
the Black Students Union is that
the latter have suffered long
enough under systematic dis
crimination. The present in
stance by comparison is ludic
rous, and I, for one, urge those
who wish to see a speedy reso
lution of the judicial problems
to give their energy to encour
aging the efforts of the Com
mittee of Fifteen rather than to
fomenting meaningless disrup
tion of the University.
EDWIN M. GOOD
Associate Professor of

Editor, The Daily:
False issues become real is
sues leading to conflict when the
readiness to accomodate is miss
ing. Because there is as yet no
substantial basis for conflict and
because the cost to all of us
from a Columbia-type confronta
tion will far outweigh any bene
fits we can derive from it, I
would add my voice to others
which now urge the crucial im
portance of that willingness to
accommodate.
I served as the faculty mem
ber of the Student Judicial
Council at the time the CIA
case was tried. I voted with all
the other members against any
penalty; unlike some on the
Council, I did NOT even find
the defendents guilty of an in
fringement of the Fundamental

mean that I believe that the
IJB's decision was illegal or im
moral. (It was, if the account
in the Daily was correct, bad
mannered; the IJB hardly show
ed that respect for the opinions
of the rest of the University
that it would presumably like to
have from them for its opinion
—otherwise, it would have at
least taken the trouble to say
why it overturned the Council's
decision. But rudeness is not a
crime.)
In accordance with the Tripar
tite Agreement, it has the right
to reject the Council's judgment
and to impose its own. And that
judgment should command sup
port from Bircher-like types
who believe that impeaching

Granting this, it seems to me
that the defendants cannot de

they can only appeal for a re
laxation of the penalty, and I
am sure that many members of
the Faculty would support their
appeal. And that should be
enough.
The IJB has been Interim for
far too long. Impatience with
the procedure required to grind
out a revised Appeals Body is
understandable. But, again, this
impatience should not have to
create serious conflict. The Com
mittee of Fifteen is presumably
still at work; surely it has now
received the signal; a few more
days or even weeks of waiting
to see their recommendations
will not hurt anyone. And it is
not unreasonable to expect a far
better solution from that group
than from the hastily put
together demands assembled
last week-end.
It makes sense at a time like
this to explore all possibilities
for accommodation. I believe
they exist and that failure to try

they can only appeal for a re

am sure that many members of
the Faculty would support their
appeal. And that should be
enough.
The IJB has been Interim for
far too long. Impatience with
the procedure required to grind
out a revised Appeals Body is
understandable. But, again, this
impatience should not have to
create serious conflict. The Com
mittee of Fifteen is presumably
still at work; surely it has now
received the signal; a few more
days or even weeks of waiting
to see their recommendations
will not hurt anyone. And it is
not unreasonable to expect a far
better solution from that group
than from the hastily put

last week-end.
It makes sense at a time like

for accommodation. I believe
they exist and that failure to try

Editor, The Daily:
In his letter to the Daily of
May 6, Professor William F.
Baxter records that "Friday af
ternoon a group of faculty mem
bers . . . met to discuss prob
lems of University judicial ma
chinery," and "were joined by
the principal ASSU officers and
two of the convicted demonstra
tors."
Professor Baxter claims that
"one or more of the students

present agreed expressly, and
none disagreed expressly" with
certain propositions which he
believes to be inconsistent with
the "demands they (sic) were
presenting." . . .
Some of the propositions cited
hy Professor Baxter, because of
their irrelevancy to what was
understood to be the purpose
of the meeting (neither the pres
entation of demands nor a dis
cussion of the issues involved
in the CIA protest case), were, in
fact, undisputed. To own the
delusion that when no one both
ers to reply to one's expression
of an opinion it is because every
body share the opinion must
indeed, especially for a lawyer
and scholar, be the height of
bliss.
When, however, Professor
Baxter gave a reason for be
lieving "that the existence of the
IJB was consistent with the Tri
partite Agreement," I said that
I did not believe that that prop
osition followed from the reason
given.
I do not recall any explicit
statement "that to establish the
new permanent judicial body de
manded would be in violation of
the Tripartite Agreement." I do
agree that it is arguable that to
do so would violate the Agree
ment. It is highly arguable, on
the other hand, that the propos
ed Student-Faculty Board is en
tirely consistent with the spirit
of the Agreement and that the
failure of the Committee of Fif
teen to agree on such a Board
in two years of negotiations,
however earnest and in good
faith, is inconsistent with the
spirit of the Agreement. Further,
it seems to me that the Com
mittee's failure is a direct cause
of the current judicial crisis and
that that fact justifies by-pass
ing the Committee in order to
create such a Board and there
by partly to resolve the crisis.
Cesare Massarenti and per
haps another student indicated
"frustration over the duration
of C-15 negotiations," but no
one suggested such frustration
"was the only (or any) justifica
tion for denying recognition to
the IJB." If Professor Baxter is
interested in other justifications,
I can cite a few, including what
now seems to me to be a com
pelling justification: that the IJB
on the basis of minimal evidence
recommended disproportionate
disciplinary action against sev
en students, and, after one day's
deliberation, in one sentence
overruled the 10,000 word deci
sion, made after a week of de
liberation (not to say violent ar
gument), of the ASSU Judicial
Council. . . .

Student Demands Only-
Hurt Their Own C.ause
Editor, The Daily:
The prospect of a sit-in over
the judicial controversy can only
be dispiriting to those of us on
the faculty who desire to see
increased student participation
in decision-making at Stanford.
Such a tactic goes a long way
toward hardening the opinion
that students are too immature
to take meaningful responsibil
ity for their decisions. A tiny
minority can quickly undo all
that the more mature have al
ready done. Ecclesiastes surely
had it right: "Dead flies make
the perfumer's oil stink: so a
little folly outweighs wisdom
and honor."
The difference between this
situation and that dramatized by
the Black Students Union is that
the latter have suffered long
enough under systematic dis
crimination. The present in
stance by comparison is ludic
rous, and I, for one, urge those
who wish to see a speedy reso
lution of the judicial problems
to give their energy to encour
aging the efforts of the Com
mittee of Fifteen rather than to
fomenting meaningless disrup
tion of the University.

False issues become real is
sues leading to conflict when the
readiness to accomodate is miss

because the cost to all of us

fits we can derive from it, I
would add my voice to others
which now urge the crucial im
portance of that willingness to
accommodate.
I served as the faculty mem

the other members against any
