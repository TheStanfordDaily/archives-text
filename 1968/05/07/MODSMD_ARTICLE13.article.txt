## Two Letters Of Conscience 
### Tim Haipht 
This week's column will just
be the text of two letters I sent
this week. They're not very well
written, but perhaps my columns
will improve as a result.
Selective Service System, Lo
cal Board No. 95, Los Artgeles
County, 1301 Westwood Blvd.,
Los Angeles, Calif., 90024.
"Dear Sirs:
"Enclosed please find my
registration certificate num
ber 4-95-45-420, and my student
deferment dm* to expire this
October. I no longer wish to
"airy either of th»'se docu
ments, nor do I wish to cooper
ate any longer with tho Selec
tive Service System.
"1 can no longer cling to the
sanctuary of the University
whilo tho people I most respect
are turning in their cards.
"To me the Selective Service
System is an embodiment of
the coercive forces our material
ist, racist, sexless, and soulless
society has used to push people
of basic decency and dignity into
molds unfit for human beings.
You want us to be killers, or
workers, or technological inno
vators, so that America can lead
the way in changing a beauti
ful planet into man's progeny
and his products. Worse than
that, you wage senseless wars,
exploit people, and discriminate
in savage ways.
"I will not risk my life to sup
port that system, although I
would give it to help America
become what her vast potential
could make her. The war in Viet
nam has been responsible for
much of my thinking, but the
basic issues go even farther than
the war. Peace talks in Paris
will not cure our basic sickness.
"We must find new goals
ant! new methods. I cannot do
my part to achieve those goals
and methods while haunted by
the hypocrisy of carrying my
draft card. Sincerely,"

"Dr. Edwin B. Chair
man, Scholarship Committee,
Department of Communication,
Stanford University, Stanford,
California, 94305.
"Dear Mr. Parker:
"I have returned my draft
card to my local board. By this
time next year I may be in jail.
Although i intend to finish this
quarter here, I do not intend to
attend Stanford in the next aca
demic year. Perhaps you could
use my grant money to recruit
a black student into the Depart
ment.
"You and your fellows have
wondered about why I haven't
really gotten excited about the
curriculum. Perhaps my present
behavior sheds some light on
that question. I am not only a
student, hut a citizen and hu
man being with moral responsi
bilities.
"This issue — of going along
with a society I believe funda
mentally wrong — has been
bothering me for a long time. I
kept myself in school by believ
ing that the status and technical
proficiency I achieved would help
me be an effective proponent of
my views sometime in the fu
ture. I no longer have suffi
cient faith in that view
"You and your fellows have
that proficiency and status, and
your views on the war and prob
lems of racism are similar to
mine. But when everything is
added up, your present activities
are supporting the status quo
more than changing it.
"Although the pursuit of
truth is a noble venture in It
self, it cannot be carried out In
isolation. You are In the mad
house with the rest of the
crazy people, and withdrawing
to a corner to do good work
will not change that.
"If you and professors like you
would tell this .society and its
government that you would do

nothing for it unless if made
immediate, genuine, and lasting
commitments to wipe out the
blots on America, change could
come. Society needs you.
"Rut you won't accept that.
You will discuss the fine points,
and check the methodology, and
run it through the computer. By
that time the extensions of your
system will have murdered and
degraded millions more and per
haps destroyed the world
"How do you do it? How do
you segment your lives so that
you can be the good professor
in the corner of the arena, while
the emperors direct their games?
"I hope one day to come back
and work with you again, but
there are more important things
right now. Sincerely,"
