HIGH-JUMP FIZZLES — Peter Boyce sits dejectedly in the high-jump pit after missing his third
and final try at 6-8. The much-anticipated duel between Boyce, who has the top jump of 1958 (7-3)
, and Cal's Clarence Johnson, who has cleared 7-1 three times this year, was a big disappointment
to the 5000 fans present when neither jumper reached 6-10.


OOPS — Cal's Johnson had his troubles too, shown here missing
his first try at 6-8. The Bear sophomore later cleared that height,
however, to hand Boyce his first dual meet loss of the season. Both
men were obviously tense and bothered by the cold.
"I've had a bad knee, but I can't use that as an alibi," said Boyce
about his failure to reach the seven-foot mark.
"I was ready to pull something over seven, but I just got too work
ed up," commented Johnson after he bowed out at 6-8.


Art Harris, Stanford's all-time
single-season scoring leader, was
selected by the Oakland Oaks In
Sunday's ABA draft.
Wednesday the NBA holds its
collegiate draft in New York.
Harris is rumored to be under
consideration by several NBA
clubs.

74th Big Meet Saturday after

spikers reached the emotional
high-point of the season.
The well-balanced Bear con
tingent sent the shivering Stan
ford squad home thoroughly
beaten, the victims of a 100-45
rout
But all was not lost, however,
as the unbeaten Tribe frosh
tamed the Cal cubs 02-53 In a
sparkling effort.
Two of the frosh winners were
Chuck Francis and Randy White.
Francis (at right) topped Cal's
Dave Masters at the tape to
take the 220 in 22.1, and ran a
leg on the 440 relay. White,
shown below steaming towards
the tape in his anchor leg of the
440 relay, set a record tn the
440 IM hurdles with a 54.0 clock
ing.


TOUGH LOSS — Tribe long

hard-luck loser to Cal's Stan
Royster Saturday. Vaughan leap

only to have Royster nudge him
by a half-inch on his fourth

HIGH-JUMP FIZZLES — Peter Boyce sits dejectedly in the high-jump pit after missing his third
and final try at 6-8. The much-anticipated duel between Boyce, who has the top jump of 1958 (7-3)
, and Cal's Clarence Johnson, who has cleared 7-1 three times this year, was a big disappointment
to the 5000 fans present when neither jumper reached 6-10.


OOPS — Cal's Johnson had his troubles too, shown here missing
his first try at 6-8. The Bear sophomore later cleared that height,
however, to hand Boyce his first dual meet loss of the season. Both
men were obviously tense and bothered by the cold.
"I've had a bad knee, but I can't use that as an alibi," said Boyce
about his failure to reach the seven-foot mark.
"I was ready to pull something over seven, but I just got too work
ed up," commented Johnson after he bowed out at 6-8.


Art Harris, Stanford's all-time
single-season scoring leader, was
selected by the Oakland Oaks In
Sunday's ABA draft.
Wednesday the NBA holds its
collegiate draft in New York.
Harris is rumored to be under
consideration by several NBA
clubs.
