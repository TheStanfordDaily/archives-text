# Ambassador To Research At Hoover
## 
### 
Former United States Ambas
sador to Indonesia, Howard P.
Jones, will be a research fellow
at the Hoover Institution next
year.
Arriving next September
Jones anticipates two years in
residence. He plans to research
and write two books on Indo
nesia â€” one a work of political
analysis, the other of more gen
eral interest.
Jones represented the U.S. in
Jakarta from 1958 to mid-1965.
He experience first-hand the Su
karno government's "confronta
tion" with the Netherlands over
control of West Iran and the
Malaysian Federation over a va
riety of political and territorial
differences.
In late 1965, three months
after Jones retired, there was a
bloody revolution and counter
revolution in which the Com
munists received a major set
back.
He sees the story of Indonesia
"as not only important in itself
but also as representative of
all the other less developed na
tions."
A graduate of Columbia Uni
versity, Jones taught journalism
in the twenties. In 1925 he began
a 15-year association with the
National Municipal League, be
coming the League's executive
secretary and journal editor. He
was New York State Civil Ser
vice Commissioner from 1939
to 1943, then served four years
in the U. S. Army, emerging as
a colonel.
