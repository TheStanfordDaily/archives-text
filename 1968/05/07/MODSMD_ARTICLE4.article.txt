## U.S. Okays Paris Hotel For Talks 
### 
PARIS (AP) — American and
North Vietnamese envoys in
spected the old Hotel Majestic
near the Arch of Triumph Mon
day and it was reported that the
United States had approved the
building as the place for preli
minary Vietnam peace talks.
If North Vietnam approves as
well, the French government is
expected to announce that the
Majestic, now a center for inter
national conferences, will be the
site for negotiations.
Informed sources said North
Vietnamese representatives were
awaiting final word from Hanoi.
The U.S. approval was said to
have come from Washington.
The talks are set for Friday
or shortly thereafter.
The United States was report
ed seeking assurances that any
site inside Paris itself be free of
demonstrators. The concern
about demonstrations by French
men sharply opposed to the U.S.
role in Vietnam apparently was
heightened because of rioting
Friday and Monday by students
on the Left and Right banks of
Paris over conditions at the Uni
versity of Paris' Sorbonne and
alleged police brutality.
• Sen. Hayden Retires
WASHINGTON (AP) In a
sometimes emotional, some
times humorous farewell cere
mony, 90-year-old Sen. Carl

Hayden announced Monday he
will retire early next year after
nearly 57 years in Congress,
longer than any other man.
The Arizona Democrat lis
tened to a five-minute tribute
from President Johnson, who
called him "a senator's sena
tor," and then Hayden said in a
choking voice that there is "a
time to step aside."
Johnson told him: "You have
fought a good fight. You haven't
finished the course but you have
kept the faith and everybody
who knows you respects you."
• Tax Bill Gets Boost
WASHINGTON (AP) — Presi
dent Johnson's drive for a $10-
billion tax increase lunged for
ward Monday when the key
House committee voted to work
on the basis of an administra
tion-accepted settlement.
The Ways and Means Com
mittee told a Senate-House
conference, headed by its own
chairman, Rep. Wilbur D. Mills,
D-Ark., to work out the in
crease. It agreed also to use the
accompanying $4-billion spend
ing-cut worked out by the Ap
propriations Committee last
week as a basis for discussions
— adding that the reductions
should be at least this great.
Committee members, includ
ing Mills, who had been holding
out for deeper cuts, accepted

the action with the understand
ing that they could still fight in
the conference for a spending
reduction in the next fiscal year
greater than the $4 billion.
• UAW Rebels Routed
ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP)
— United Auto Workers Presi
dent Walter P. Ruether moved
to the attack Monday on rebels
challenging his administration's
leadership of the 1.4-million
member union and routed them
decisively.
The rebels could muster only
293 supporters among 3,000 con
vention delegates in an effort to
force a roll-call vote on their
proposal to elect officers by
unionwide referendum rather
than by convention delegates.
Under rules of the convention
the rebels would have needed
825 supporters to force a roll
call vote.
• Columbia Closed
NEW YORK (AP) — Two
weeks of campus crisis at Co
lumbia University eased Mon
day, but almost two thirds of its
schools and departments aban
doned formal classes for the
rest of the term.
The boseiged university open
ed its doors for the first time in
10 days, directing its faculty and
students to work out their own

ground rules. But the acting
dean held captive in his office
for almost 24 hours when the
student protest started April 23
said the normal education proc
ess was finished for this school
year.
Rebel students striving to
close the 25,000-student Ivy
League university altogether
mounted a boycott of classes
Monday morning. By noon,
about 300 manned token picket
lines before more than a dozen
buildings.
But after minor early morn
ing scuffling, the pickets merely
shouted and jeered at unsym
pathetic students and staff
memebrs striding through their
lines.
• Saigon Fight Rages
SAIGON (AP) — Fighting
raged through the pre-dawn
dark Tuesday on the outskirts of
Saigon. It was the third day of
an enemy show of strength ap
parently aimed at influencing
preliminary Paris peace talks
opening later this week.
Saigon's Tan Son Nhut air
base came under rocket or mor
tar fire, but the shelling was re
ported light.
North Vietnamese soldiers
were reported engaged close to
the capital for the first time
Monday.

• Transplants Better
HOUSTON, Tex. (AP) — Doc

pleased with the progress of two
men who have received heart
implants from teen-age donors
in relatively swift operations.
Removal of the heart and ac
tual suturing in a transplant
Friday required 35 minutes.
Sunday's required 42 minutes.
James B. Cobb, 48, an Alexan
dria, La., salesman, received
the heart of a 15-year old
Conroe, Tex., youth Sunday
night. Cobb was reported awake
Monday with normal blood pres

Claire Thomas, 47, a Phoenix
