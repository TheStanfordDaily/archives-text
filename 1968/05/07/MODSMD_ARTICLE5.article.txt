# Protestors Holding Old Union As Lyman Rejects Demands
## 
### DAN SNELL 
As The Daily went to press,
these were the recent develop
ments in the Interim Judicial
Board (IJB) suspensions contro
versy :
Three to four hundred stu
dents seemed prepared to oc
cupy the Old Union last night in
a peaceful demonstration that
began at 1 that afternoon.
Students on the demonstra
tion's tactics committee held a
meeting to decide what action to

take through the night and to
day.
The decision to stay the night
followed an earlier move to leave
the building in response to a vote
of an ASSU mass meeting at 8:20
p.m. in the Old Union courtyard.
In the vote students rejected the
occupation of the building as a
tactic.
Reportedly four student mem
bers of the arbitrating student
faculty - administration Commit
tee of Fifteen said last night at

an open meeting in Memorial
Auditorium they would remain
at today's meeting of the com
mittee if the committee would
adopt a final proposal to alter
the IJB. They emphasized that
the IJB must be abolished and
the case against the students
dismissed, and they said they
would stay in the committee
meeting as long as necessary to
complete a proposal today.
Provost Richard Lyman ap
peared at an open meeting in

Memorial Auditorium attended
by about 1800 students and fac
ulty in which he defended Pres
ident J. E. Wallace Sterling's
statement of Sunday.
Lyman rejected the first de
mand, that the IJB decision for
suspension not be accepted, by
saying that Sterling did not
want to act until he had al
lowed time to consult individ
ually with the defendants. Ly
man said the students' offense
was only "minor in so far as
we (the administration) pre
vented a sit-in from happen
ing."
He rejected the second de
mand, that the IJB be disbanded,
saying "it is a thoroughly legi
timate body." He said that to
grant its abolition "under the
kind of pressure we now have"
would be a "sad commentary"
on the times.
The third demand, for an ap
pellate board composed of four
faculty members and five stu
dents, would soon be met in
spirit when, according to Ly
man, the Committee of Fifteen
(Cl 5) a faculty - administration
student arbitrating body, pre
sents its recommendations "with
in the next six weeks."

Lyman said the fourth de
mand, that only appeals from de
fendants be heard by the appel
late board, could not be met be
cause "The ASSU Judicial Coun
cil is the creature of the Legi
slature." The Legislature would
then have undue power "over
every other element in this com
munity," Lyman said.
He called the demand that
Sterling address the students
yesterday a "delusive tactic"
and denounced "deadlines for»
giving simple answers to com
plex questions."
In the ASSU mass meeting at
the Old Union earlier, ASSU
President Cesare Massarenti re
iterated that there had been no
damage to anything in the build
ing. He said, "President , Sterl
ing's letter in The Daily does
not answer our demands at all."
After several students and
three faculty members had spok
en, Legislature Speaker Michael
Weinstein conducted a hand
vote of the assembled students.
Students voted to support the
sit-inners' four demands, rejected
the sit-in as a tactic, and sup
ported amnesty for those who
did sit-in.
Yesterday's demonstration ap
peared to violate the University
demonstrations policy which
reads, in part, demonstrations
are allowed which "do not inter
fere with . . . educational proc
esses of the University; (and)
are not held within University
buildings."
At the open meeting Prof.
Hubert Marshall of political
science, chairman of the Com
mittee of Fifteen, said he and
the members of the committee
believe "good progress" is be
ing made toward forming a
faculty-student appeals board
acceptable to students, faculty,
and administrators.
Prof. William Baxter of law,
speaking only as a member of
the faculty, said the University
must soon decide whether it
wants to subject itself complete
ly to outside laws or remain an
"exclave" apart from the rest of
society.
He said the complaints against
the Committee of Fifteen "can
not be taken terribly seriously"
when the committee is still con
scientiously laboring over the ju
dicial question.
Student Steven Duncan pre

sented a petition signed by 700
persons supporting the admini
stration in their reaction to the
student demands.
It was learned last night that
several other groups of students
have been circulating similar pe
titions, one of them having at
least 100 signatures by 10 p.m.
From a noon rally In White
Plaza students moved toward
the Old Union when it became
clear that no Administration
representative was to appear
to answer demands.
The Union, doors locked and
chained by 11:40 p.m., was ent
ered at about 1 p.m. by students
who had at first tried to open
windows on the ground floor.
A tactics committee, elected
at a meeting of about 150 stu
dents Sunday night in TMU, had
determined that the tone of the
demonstration would be at "a
very low level of militancy," ac
cording to ASSU President
Cesare Massarenti.
The suspensions result from a
demonstration Nov. 1 against a
recruiter for the Central Intelli
gence Agency in the West wing
of Encina Hall.
That day 50 to 100 students
participating in the demon

stration attempted to enter
the building-. But Dean of Stu
dents Joel Smith informed the
students that they were vio
lating University policy on
demonstrations, and the stu
dents withdrew to continue
their protest outside.
Later Smith brought charges
against ten of the students in
ASSU Judicial Council. The
Council found the students not
guilty on the basis that the Uni
versity policy on demonstra
tions was "overbroad."
But Smith appealed to the all
faculty IJB, and that body sus
pended seven of the students—
all those still on campus—four
for summer quarter, and two
for spring and fall quarters.
The suspensions do not go into
effect this quarter.
Massarenti had said Sunday
he might go as far as to resign
if other ASSU officers and presi
dential candidates would also,
but this action did not material
ize.
Students Inside the Union
on the whole were friendly to
ward police and the few ad
ministrators present.
But early in the protest an
ABC-TV cameraman was buf
feted about for a few moments
as students tried to prevent him
from photographing other stu
dents who were trying to open
a window in the Union.
Many of the speeches by stu
dents in the Union stressed
maintaining the non-violent pos
ture of the protest in order

to "keep the cops off our necks."
Stanford Police Chief Thomas
Bell was on the scene all day,
and the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's office did not have offi
cers in the building.
Secretaries in the Old Union
had been told to take the rest
of the day off when the pro
test began to materialize at
noon, according to Registrar
Harvey Hall.
The Union, which reportedly
has no air conditioning, was
rather hot at the beginning of
the afternoon, but the students
began to thin out in the build
ing, many of them going out
side. The crowd ranged between
300 and 900 during the day.
Students sent a delegation to
Provost Richard Lyman to ask
him to join in the free-wheeling
discussion taking place in the
Union lobby, where students had
set up a public address system.
Lyman declined to come at that
time, saying he was setting up
last night's Memorial Auditor
ium meeting.
Opinion among the students
ranged widely about the pro
test. One man said, "While we
are setting here, the adminis
tration will not accept our de
mands. They will feel intimi
dated; we've shown we mean
business already."
Another commented, "Y o u
who want to give in to the Ad
ministration are like enlighten
ment philosophers who want to
'turn on' the king. It simply
doesn't work."
