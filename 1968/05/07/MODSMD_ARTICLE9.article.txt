# How Long?
## 
### 
Stanford has finally made it into the big time. CBS, NBC], and
dozens of newspapers were here to record the historic moment
as activism blossomed into student occupation of the Old Union.
Stanford seemed poised on the edge of Morningside Heights and
the Berkeley Hills.
How long can it remain poised?
If yesterday's tumultous events are any indication, it will not
be long before lack of communication totally dominates develop
ments and all restraint is lost. Action will answer action and build
ing occupation will become small game.
The two sides must talk with each other — immediately. This
is not a time for saving face. The IJ B must go, and the administra
tion ought to have the message by now that it better go quickly.
And the administration should stop its harping about "illegal"
sit-ins when it has a totally unfair, if not illegal, judicial struc
ture. We ask the President and Provost to remember that they
felt obliged to chain and padlock the Old Union when, for all
they knew, the 20() students were simply planning to cash checks
or drop courses.
The students, in turn, must keep cool and continue the sit-in
with the consummate grace they have used so far. They must con
tinue talking as they did yesterday and should not get carried
away with illusory feeling of video-stimulated strength. Most
important, the student leaders must remember that their support
is broad and will remain so only if they keep their outlook broad
and democratic.
Yet tensions might be alleviated by talks between students and
administrators. When talk ends, fire and police begin.
How long will Wallace Sterling and Richard Lyman continue
to evade the clearly reasonable spirit of the demands for a new
judicial system?
