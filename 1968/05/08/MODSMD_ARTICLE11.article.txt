We, the student membership of the Committee or Fifteen, conside.
the work of the Committee today to have been tremendously valu
able in setting up a viable judicial and legislative structure to handle
student affairs and to involve students in decision-making processes
at Stanford over the next years.
We think the Committee failed tragically to meet the specific
grievances which the current demonstration protests. We believe that
no resolution will be found to the present impasse until the three
constituencies —students, faculty, and administration —agree that the
suspensions of the C.LA. demonstrators be rescinded and that amnesty
be guaranteed for all students now demonstrating. Only such an agree
ment of amnesty, supplementing the long-term compromises reached
in the Committee of Fifteen today, can pre-empt the possibility of
disaster for Stanford. We think that such an agreement would be a fair
accommodation.
We realize that predictions of disaster may be seen as an attempt
at coercion. Ours is not so meant. At some point, in any event, the
University must choose to ignore the elements of coercion necessarily
involved in the current situation.
