## Judicial System Controversy Rages 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford's Judicial System
cannot be defended in any circle
as effective, consistent, just or
tolerable. Re-evaluation and re
pair of this disturbing and dam
aging facet of our academic
community has come much too
slowly. Thoughtful change is ur
gent.
Admittedly, the lines of com
munication have (for administra
tion and students) failed too of
-ten. But, more often they hava
been destroyed by those who
think they need and understand
power, while all they have done
is broadcast their inability to
balance power with responsi
bility. These individuals, a mi
nority, have opened our commu
nity to restrictive and intruding
forces previously unknown at
Stanford, and have disrupted
movement toward a free think
ing, yet harmonious university
environment.
I question the purpose and
stability of a student group that
demands all power, when it has
failed to demonstrate that it can
handle its present power, shar
ing the burdens of administer
ing a university.
It is unfortunate that a bad
judicial structure serves to pun
ish students who should be con
fronted with and punished by a
good judicial system.

More Questions Posed
Over Judicial Process
Editor, The Daily:
Some important questions
about the Stanford judicial proc
ess remain unanswered:
1. The "Joint Statement on
Rights and Freedoms of Stu
dents" ( AAUP Bulletin, Dec.
1967) says,"the actions of the
student government within the
areas of its jurisdiction should
be reviewed only through order
ly and prescribed procedures."
Was this the case in the IJB
trial of the CIA demonstrators?
2. The AAUP statement says
that "Disciplinary proceedings

should be instituted only for vio
lations of standards of conduct
formulated with significant stu
dent participation." Do the "Fun
damental Standard" and the reg
ulations concerning campus dem
onstrations meet this criterion?
3. The joint statement conclud
es, "The decision of the hearing
committee should be final, sub
ject only to the student's right
of appeal to the president ..."
Is Joel Smith a student?
4. Has a sincere effort been
made to bring to trial all viola
tors of university regulations or
have certain "troublemakers"
been selected for punishment?
5. Administration spokesmen
have indicated that the present
judicial appartus is unsatisfac
tory. If this is true, why do they
feel bound to enforce its deci
sions?

Forcible Occupation
Termed Unacceptable
Editor, The Daily:
The substantive issues con
cerning judicial procedures at
Stanford are basic and worthy of
the most critical discussion. We,
the undersigned, have differing
opinions about the proper reso
lution of this controversy. How
ever, we are unanimous in our
belief that (1) the forcible oc
cupation of University buildings
and (2) the advocacy of such ac
tion by the ASSU President is a
form of behavior unacceptable at
Stanford University.
We urge support of the ini
tiative petition now circulating
that expresses these convictions.

People Can, MUST
Change Un just Laws
Editor, The Daily:
Monday, I talked with some
students on the fringes of the
crowd at the Old Union court
yard—students who were not in
complete sympathy with the oc
cupation of the building. They
told me that they agreed with
our cause—that our demands
were just—but that they did not
agree with our means. They ex
plained that the occupation was
illegal and therefore wrong and
that we ought to go through the
"proper channels".
I think they were missing the
point. Just because something is
illegal doesn't make it wrong.
Let me give some examples.
When a Stanford man "has
sexual relations with" his girl
friend he is committing a crime.
The girl and the guy know they
have done nothing wrong, yet,
legally, they are subject to jail
sentences. If they happen to be
smoking grass at the time, then
they could get a few more
years.
To pick a less homespun ex
ample, let me point out that the
extermination of millions of
Jews and Eastern Europeans
during the Second World War
was all perfectly legal. Few
would argue that it was not
wrong.
As another example, let's ima
gine that President Sterling and
the Board of Trustees went on
some weird trip and decided to
suspend all 12,000 Stanford stu
dents. That would be perfectly
legal, since "Stanford University
is a private institution, con
trolled through the President by
the Board of Trustees blah, blah,
blah." Sure, but do you think
for a minute that the alumni
and parents would put up with
such nonsense? There would be
an enormous outcry, JUST
would be quickly organized (Jet

tison Unfair Stanford Trustees),
and before long, the students
would be re-instated.
The point is that laws are
not immutable. When people get
together they can change them.
Vicky Drake would not be al
lowed to give so many people
so much pleasure if not for past
challenges to obscenity laws. Al
cholic beverages would still be
illegal if not for massive viola
tions of Prohibition laws. When
a few people cause others to
suffer and then defend their ac
tions by appeals to principles of
"law and order" or "rules and
regulations", then we must act
to defend the victims and
change the laws.
History shows us that until
people actively challenge unjust
laws, those laws are never
changed. In fact, informed
sources have revealed to me that
at least one Stanford Trustee is
a direct descendant of a mem
ber of the Boston Tea Party.)

Stanford Has Fallen
To Rule By Minority
Editor, The Daily:
The "town meeting" at the
Old Union on Monday night was
a significant event in the politi
cal atmosphere of Stanford Uni
versity. Cesare Massarenti called
this meeting with what could
only have been looked upon as
an air of hope for support of his
cause. The turnout was decided
ly different than what I am sure
he expected—for perhaps the
first time in years the vocal mi
norities on campus were not the
majority at a decision-making
rally.
The bulk of the student body
was finally represented in
enough force to let the people
occupying the building know
that their tactics are not con
doned by the community as a
whole. This was a remarkable
thing at a university where any
one but the ultra-liberal or ul
tra-conservative is rarely heard
from at all—especially in times
of crisis.
The really enlightening event
took place after the Mem Aud
meeting, however. The group
that had asked for and failed to
receive the support of the "stu
dent body" overrode the demo
cratic the process they them
selves instigated and went back
into the Old Union. Irony? No—
not really. Disturbing? — Yes,
very!
We had just heard Provost
Lyman give a very impressive
(if not totally acceptable) "lec
ture" in support of the adminis
tration's stand on the four origi
nal demands. The point which
sticks in my mind was when he
expressed concern over the po
tential crippling power of a de
fendant-appeal - only system
coupled with a student-run judi
cial board. In effect, he predict
ed anarchy; if we couldn't con
ceive of its possibility before
the resumption of the sit-in, can
we overlook its very real possi
bility now that the "ruling-mi
nority" has overthrown the
democratic decision which they
themselves instigated?
If Cesare is just frustrated
with the student body and the
rational process of change inher
ent in the system as it stands
let him resign, not thrust an in
valid image of the student body
upon the world; if he really
wants anarchy let him say that
he does—maybe then he'll see
the true depth of his support.

Students Invite Faculty
To Come To Old IJnion
Editor, The Daily:
A large number of faculty
members have shown their con
cern over the past few days.
They are concerned about the
tactics, as well as the objectives,
of the current occupation of the
Old Union building. We realize

that the students who have been
sitting in cannot attend (at least
in large numbers), the meeting
of the Academic Council sche
duled for 4:15 this afternoon. To
insure that students and faculty
understand each other in this
crisis, we urge that all faculty
members, before attending the
Academic Council, visit us at the
Old Union. We feel not only that
this will provide a channel for
discussing the issues, but it will
permit faculty members to un
derstand exactly what the stu
dents in the Old Union are doing.

Everyone Responsible
For Making Decision
Editor, The Daily:
I imagine that there comes a
time in almost everyone's life
when a decision must be made
that reflects a fundamental at
tachment or some deep convic
tion or ideal. We have witnessed
such a choice and such a con
viction recently in the campaign
of Gene McCarthy.
In these days of ferment and
activism on college campuses
one need not look far for pun
gent examples closer to home.
Many may fervently disagree
with much of what Dave Harris
says, but few would challenge
his sincerity and conviction. But
even on the campuses of colleges
and universities the voice of con
cern and conviction is all too
limited to a vociferous minority
of extremists who march under
the banner of emotional attach
ment rather than reason. Most of
us still would rather read about
the efforts of others on behalf of
issues that seem rather vague
and distant. Well you fat middle
class apathetic bastards, look
up and listen, the cause is yours
and it is here and now, today.
Threats are being made to
close this university down. A few
wild-eyed, romantically inclined,
emotionally attached "activists"
have decided for you and me that
the present administration Is in
transigent, reactionary, and un
reasonable, or should I say emo
tionally incompatible.
The administration of Stanford
University, although laced with
shortcomings, is not a monolithic
monster bent on devouring the
individuality of the poor op
pressed masses of students. To
seriously entertain such
thoughts is pure B.S. Stanford
is not on the "edge of greatness."
Our institution is one of the
finest in the world and to allow
any group to even threaten to

bring to this campus such events
as those that occurred at Colum
bia is a disgrace to us all.
The grievances being address
ed to the administration at this
time, certainly not without
merit, can only be solved by a
sincere effort on the part of all
parties concerned in reasoned
discussion.
So what can we do to bring
this about? In the coming
ASSU elections, heretofore im
puted with meaninglessness,
meaning can be added. If all of
the candidates will speak out on
this crucial issue, the future di
rection of student-administration
dialogue can be decided. The
choice should be clear, we can
vote for a reasoned attempt to
solve the problems facing the
university or we can vote a mili
tant approach.
By doing this at least the de
cision will lie with each and
every one of us, and whatever
may follow will reflect our de
cision. There is a third alterna
tive; we can always sit back on
our dead asses and read about it
in the paper.
