# Letters To The Editor
## Professor Sees Good Intentions Of Militants 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
I was disturbed to hear the re
marks addressed to the students
last night by my colleague, Pro
fessor Meyerhof. As I recall his
words ,he stated, "... I have
been here nineteen years and I
have cometo love this Univers
ity ... . you students have it
in your power now to let it con
tinue to function, or to destroy
it. I hope you will consider your
decision carefully. . ."
The experience of my own
nine years of tenure leads me to
no dispute with the first part
of Mr. Meyerhof's comment. I
derive from it, however, an in
ference very different that the
one he evidently intended.
There is at stake, it seems to
me, a much deeper issue than
the immediate question of dis
ciplinary jurisdiction, and it is
dubious that present formal is
sue would excite much interest
were our times less troubled.
Underlying the discontent, at
Stanford and elsewhere, is the
rather broad question of the
kind of world into which our
students will graduate.
As of this writing it seems to
many of them to be a world of
futility and of terror. It is a
world which the students
neither created nor chose, yet it
is they who will have to bear its
burdens. It will be for them a
kind of taxation without repre
sentation, in which the taxes
are paid in blood—the blood in
the veins of those who must
fight, and the blood on the hands
of those who devise and operate
the machines to produce the
bombs and missiles and jellied
gasoline, and the gases and
chemicals and germs.
Our college youth have been
exposed since birth to the un
savory spectacle of their elders
busily preparing the annihila
tion of the Universe for private
profit, and they are now con
strained to witness the complic
ity and silence of their Univers
ities on this central moral issue
of our time. They are right if
they feel that a University
which is unable or unwilling to
dissociate itself from the de
velopment of instruments of
torture, murder, and mass de
struction, or with the loathsome
activities of a CIA, is a Univers
ity whose highest officials
should be called to account.
In this situation it is the milit
ant students whose actions re

fleet the real best interest of all
of us, and it is those who are
content to let matters slide who
betray us. It is love for their
University, as distinguished
from its buildings, that moti
vated the CIA demonstrators,
and which motivates the stu
dents now. Their actions will not
destroy the University; they
may instead rejuvenate it.

What If They Agreed
With IJB Decision?
Editor, The Daily:
The extent to which this judi
cial issue has grown amazes me,
and it makes me wonder if the
issue is really the abolution of
the Interim Judicial Board. I
would agree that we need a new
system, but as far as the IJB
goes, it's certainly not more in
iquitous now than it was before
its recent decision. If its immedi
ate dissolution is so important
to so many people, where were
these people before the deci
sion? Why were they not dem
onstrating before?
The only answer, I think, is
that it is not the IJB they op
pose, but rather, it is the fact
that the IJB has dared to make
a decision with which they dis
agree. There is little comment
one can make upon this, I sup
pose, seeing that it is just one
more example of the kind of
onesidedness and bigotry which
seems to be permeating our
society nowadays, on all sides
of the political spectrum.
I realize that the many peo
ple who are taking action
against the IJB are very sin
cere in their beliefs, but I would
have them ask themselves,
"What would have been my re
action, had the IJB upheld the
decision of the Student Judicial
Council?"

Will Get You Nowhere
Editor, The Daily:
As a newcomer to the Stan
ford community, I have consist
ently been impressed with the
responsiveness and effectiveness
of the University Administration
vis-a-vis student concerns and

interests. I was especially im
pressed with the performance
of Provost Lyman during the
heat of the crisis which followed
Dr. King's assassination. It is
my own personal belief that the
Administration is intent on im
plementing its promises with re
spect to the position of Blacks
at Stanford, even if some of us
might have wished for more
radical change.
But all this contrasts starkly
with the attitude of the Adminis
tration in the current contro
versy over the IJB ruling. In
deed, for the first time I'm re
minded of conditions at my
alma mater, Columbia Univers
ity. Provost Lyman is quoted in
the Daily of May 7 as stating
categorically that "the IJB is a
thoroughly legitimate body" and
that its abolition would be im
possible "under the kind of pres
sure we now have." It is this
curious kind of "we win, you
lose" logic that has prevailed at
Columbia for the past decade
and a half, and which has led
inevitably to the now famous
confrontation of last week. . . .
When violence came to Colum
bia in 1965 in the form of an
anti-ROTC riot, the Student
Council and liberal faculty
groups mediated the dispute
with the Administration and
won a commitment from the Ad
ministration to form a "Tri-par
tite Committee" which would
formulate a wholly new body of
laws and regulations for the
University. To this day, nothing
has come out of the Committee,
primarily because the Adminis
tration felt under no pressure to
accept, much less support, the
findings of this body.
When the students finally re
bel and take it upon themselves
to force a new order, the Admin
istration responds by saying
that it will not negotiate "un
der pressure." I'm dismayed by
the reaction of Provost Lyman,
and hope that he will once again
find a way to respond construct
ively and in a tangible way to
the long-standing student de
mand for a greater institutional
role in decision-making. Refus
ing to negotiate under pressure
will lead only to greater pres
sure, i.e., violence. Responding
now will break the ice and make
it unnecessary for the students
to escalate their tactics. They
cannot de-escalate, however, un
less they do get some tangible

response: They have learned
from the bitter experience of
years of responsible "diplo
macy" that it will get them no
where.

Biz School Conducts
Noon Speech Series
Editor, The Daily:
We would like to make a few
observations with respect to the
Biz School "speak-out." A num
ber of students at the Business
School were concerned with pro
viding the Stanford Community
an opportunity to hear our
views with respect to the Ameri
can Scene. We wanted to en
courage dialogue and construc
tive discussion and we wanted
to encourage a mutual under
standing of positions between
our critics and ourselves.
Our speeches managed to hold
the attention of the potential
SDS "teach-in" audience, and the
SDS — that group which is so
critical of the American Estab
lishment — found it necessary
to call upon that very Establish
ment, in the form of the busi
ness school administration, to
discontinue our program. This
technique is somewhat startling,
but it is apparently consistent
with their usual practice of dis
rupting the expression of views
they oppose in their exercise
of their "right of free speech."
Nonetheless, our program is
being continued. We are holding
a series of short-speeches this
week at noon, at the Business
School.

ROTC Falls To Arson
'Second Time Around'
Editor, The Daily:
Fire is terrible the second
time around . . .
Much of the Stanford campus
accepted the first burning down
of the Navy ROTC classroom an
nex on February 19 as an under
standable, if regretable, protest
against ROTC and the war in
Vietnam.
Like a friendly home the
the second time it falls . . .
The reconstructed and enlarg
ed annex would have been avail
able fall quarter to relieve the
overcrowded facilities in the

BAC, presently serving over 400
ROTC students.
Who can say what led us to
this awful crime . . .
In a single week, protestors
have broken into university
buildings, disrupted student ser
vices in the Old Union, and at
tempted to freeze the workings
of the University, all in the
name of reform through disre
gard for law and order.
Makes you think perhaps
that rage, like youth, is wast
ing away the young . . .
Responsible university of
ficials now must try to balance
the examples of responsible stu
dent participation in education
al change against the deadlines
and ultimatums of the harrang
uing militants.
There were those who bet
that arson comes but once, and
yet, I'm so sad we met the
second time around.

STANFORD MAN? or Stanford
boy?
Does bosom bare bring so much
joy
That, lured by ancient female
ploy,
You've now become the female's
toy?
She winds you up to suit her
pleasure.
You vote for that bare chest you
treasure
When brain is more the leader's
measure
And "treasured chests" were
made for leisure.
So cherish now your right to
rule.
Though Eve made Adam look a
fool,
Though Edward VIII was
Wally's tool,
Will Topless girls now rule our
school?
Come MEN and boys, though
goggle-eyed
Like lemmings bent on suicide.
Don't abdicate! Assert your
pride
And cast your vote on manhood's
side!
(Or - you'll deserve a topless
bride - like TWIGGY!)

Who run for student head today.
Shall we then vote for llug-Me-

Hukari is after the Daily — but
phooey
Life would hold but little spice
Were one to exterminate the lice.
Brewer or Hayes might be all
right
But what we need is a guiding
light
Not someone mouthing year-old
phrases
That leave us all in year-old
dazes.
What we need is a topless femnie
Though some confuse her with
a vicious BEM
Someone to give LASSU a shot
in the arm
It certainly can't do any harm.

voiced alarm — a TWIGGY
she's not).

STANFORD CIIAPARRAL
Editor, The Dally:
I was disturbed to hear the re
marks addressed to the students
last night by my colleague, Pro
fessor Meyerhof. As I recall his
words ,he stated, "... I have
been here nineteen years and I
have cometo love this Univers
ity ... . you students have it
in your power now to let it con
tinue to function, or to destroy
it. I hope you will consider your
decision carefully. . ."
The experience of my own
nine years of tenure leads me to
no dispute with the first part
of Mr. Meyerhof's comment. I
derive from it, however, an in
ference very different that the
one he evidently intended.
There is at stake, it seems to
me, a much deeper issue than
the immediate question of dis
ciplinary jurisdiction, and it is
dubious that present formal is
sue would excite much interest
were our times less troubled.
Underlying the discontent, at
Stanford and elsewhere, is the
rather broad question of the
kind of world into which our
students will graduate.
As of this writing it seems to
many of them to be a world of
futility and of terror. It is a
world which the students
neither created nor chose, yet it
is they who will have to bear its
burdens. It will be for them a
kind of taxation without repre
sentation, in which the taxes
are paid in blood—the blood in
the veins of those who must
fight, and the blood on the hands
of those who devise and operate
the machines to produce the
bombs and missiles and jellied
gasoline, and the gases and
chemicals and germs.
Our college youth have been
exposed since birth to the un
savory spectacle of their elders
busily preparing the annihila
tion of the Universe for private
profit, and they are now con
strained to witness the complic
ity and silence of their Univers
ities on this central moral issue
of our time. They are right if
they feel that a University
which is unable or unwilling to
dissociate itself from the de
velopment of instruments of
torture, murder, and mass de
struction, or with the loathsome
activities of a CIA, is a Univers
ity whose highest officials
should be called to account.
In this situation it is the milit
ant students whose actions re

fleet the real best interest of all
of us, and it is those who are
content to let matters slide who
betray us. It is love for their
University, as distinguished
from its buildings, that moti
vated the CIA demonstrators,
and which motivates the stu
dents now. Their actions will not
destroy the University; they
may instead rejuvenate it.

What If They Agreed
With IJB Decision?
Editor, The Daily:
The extent to which this judi
cial issue has grown amazes me,
and it makes me wonder if the
issue is really the abolution of
the Interim Judicial Board. I
would agree that we need a new
system, but as far as the IJB
goes, it's certainly not more in
iquitous now than it was before
its recent decision. If its immedi
ate dissolution is so important
to so many people, where were
these people before the deci
sion? Why were they not dem
onstrating before?
The only answer, I think, is
that it is not the IJB they op
pose, but rather, it is the fact
that the IJB has dared to make
a decision with which they dis
agree. There is little comment
one can make upon this, I sup
pose, seeing that it is just one
more example of the kind of
onesidedness and bigotry which
seems to be permeating our
society nowadays, on all sides
of the political spectrum.
I realize that the many peo
ple who are taking action
against the IJB are very sin
cere in their beliefs, but I would
have them ask themselves,
"What would have been my re
action, had the IJB upheld the
decision of the Student Judicial
Council?"
EDWARD McCLURE

Will Get You Nowhere
Editor, The Daily:
As a newcomer to the Stan
ford community, I have consist
ently been impressed with the
responsiveness and effectiveness
of the University Administration
vis-a-vis student concerns and

interests. I was especially im
pressed with the performance
of Provost Lyman during the
heat of the crisis which followed
Dr. King's assassination. It is
my own personal belief that the
Administration is intent on im
plementing its promises with re
spect to the position of Blacks
at Stanford, even if some of us
might have wished for more
radical change.
But all this contrasts starkly
with the attitude of the Adminis
tration in the current contro
versy over the IJB ruling. In
deed, for the first time I'm re
minded of conditions at my
alma mater, Columbia Univers
ity. Provost Lyman is quoted in
the Daily of May 7 as stating
categorically that "the IJB is a
thoroughly legitimate body" and
that its abolition would be im
possible "under the kind of pres
sure we now have." It is this
curious kind of "we win, you
lose" logic that has prevailed at
Columbia for the past decade
and a half, and which has led
inevitably to the now famous
confrontation of last week. . . .
When violence came to Colum
bia in 1965 in the form of an
anti-ROTC riot, the Student
Council and liberal faculty
groups mediated the dispute
with the Administration and
won a commitment from the Ad
ministration to form a "Tri-par
tite Committee" which would
formulate a wholly new body of
laws and regulations for the
University. To this day, nothing
has come out of the Committee,
primarily because the Adminis
tration felt under no pressure to
accept, much less support, the
findings of this body.
When the students finally re
bel and take it upon themselves
to force a new order, the Admin
istration responds by saying
that it will not negotiate "un
der pressure." I'm dismayed by
the reaction of Provost Lyman,
and hope that he will once again
find a way to respond construct
ively and in a tangible way to
the long-standing student de
mand for a greater institutional
role in decision-making. Refus
ing to negotiate under pressure
will lead only to greater pres
sure, i.e., violence. Responding
now will break the ice and make
it unnecessary for the students
to escalate their tactics. They
cannot de-escalate, however, un
less they do get some tangible

response: They have learned
from the bitter experience of
years of responsible "diplo
macy" that it will get them no
where.

Biz School Conducts
Noon Speech Series
Editor, The Daily:
We would like to make a few
observations with respect to the
Biz School "speak-out." A num
ber of students at the Business
School were concerned with pro
viding the Stanford Community
an opportunity to hear our
views with respect to the Ameri
can Scene. We wanted to en
courage dialogue and construc
tive discussion and we wanted
to encourage a mutual under
standing of positions between
our critics and ourselves.
Our speeches managed to hold
the attention of the potential
SDS "teach-in" audience, and the
SDS — that group which is so
critical of the American Estab
lishment — found it necessary
to call upon that very Establish
ment, in the form of the busi
ness school administration, to
discontinue our program. This
technique is somewhat startling,
but it is apparently consistent
with their usual practice of dis
rupting the expression of views
they oppose in their exercise
of their "right of free speech."
Nonetheless, our program is
being continued. We are holding
a series of short-speeches this
week at noon, at the Business
School.

ROTC Falls To Arson
'Second Time Around'
Editor, The Daily:
Fire is terrible the second
time around . . .
Much of the Stanford campus
accepted the first burning down
of the Navy ROTC classroom an
nex on February 19 as an under
standable, if regretable, protest
against ROTC and the war in
Vietnam.
Like a friendly home the
the second time it falls . . .
The reconstructed and enlarg
ed annex would have been avail
able fall quarter to relieve the
overcrowded facilities in the

BAC, presently serving over 400
ROTC students.
Who can say what led us to
this awful crime . . .
In a single week, protestors
have broken into university
buildings, disrupted student ser
vices in the Old Union, and at
tempted to freeze the workings
of the University, all in the
name of reform through disre
gard for law and order.
Makes you think perhaps
that rage, like youth, is wast
ing away the young . . .
Responsible university of
ficials now must try to balance
the examples of responsible stu
dent participation in education
al change against the deadlines
and ultimatums of the harrang

ROTC Falls To Arson
'Second Time Around'
Editor, The Daily:
Fire is terrible the second
time around . . .
Much of the Stanford campus
accepted the first burning down
of the Navy ROTC classroom an
nex on February 19 as an under
standable, if regretable, protest
against ROTC and the war in
Vietnam.
Like a friendly home the
the second time it falls . . .
The reconstructed and enlarg
ed annex would have been avail
able fall quarter to relieve the
overcrowded facilities in the

BAC, presently serving over 400
ROTC students.
Who can say what led us to
this awful crime . . .
In a single week, protestors
have broken into university
buildings, disrupted student ser
vices in the Old Union, and at
tempted to freeze the workings
of the University, all in the
name of reform through disre
gard for law and order.
Makes you think perhaps
that rage, like youth, is wast
ing away the young . . .
Responsible university of
ficials now must try to balance
the examples of responsible stu
dent participation in education
al change against the deadlines
and ultimatums of the harrang
uing militants.
There were those who bet
that arson comes but once, and
yet, I'm so sad we met the
second time around.

STANFORD CIIAPARRAL
Editor, The Dally:
I was disturbed to hear the re
marks addressed to the students
last night by my colleague, Pro
fessor Meyerhof. As I recall his
words ,he stated, "... I have
been here nineteen years and I
have cometo love this Univers
ity ... . you students have it
in your power now to let it con
tinue to function, or to destroy
it. I hope you will consider your
decision carefully. . ."
The experience of my own
nine years of tenure leads me to
no dispute with the first part
of Mr. Meyerhof's comment. I
derive from it, however, an in
ference very different that the
one he evidently intended.
There is at stake, it seems to
me, a much deeper issue than
the immediate question of dis
ciplinary jurisdiction, and it is
dubious that present formal is
sue would excite much interest
were our times less troubled.
Underlying the discontent, at
Stanford and elsewhere, is the
rather broad question of the
kind of world into which our
students will graduate.
As of this writing it seems to
many of them to be a world of
futility and of terror. It is a
world which the students
neither created nor chose, yet it
is they who will have to bear its
burdens. It will be for them a
kind of taxation without repre
sentation, in which the taxes
are paid in blood—the blood in
the veins of those who must
fight, and the blood on the hands
of those who devise and operate
the machines to produce the
bombs and missiles and jellied
gasoline, and the gases and
chemicals and germs.
Our college youth have been
exposed since birth to the un
savory spectacle of their elders
busily preparing the annihila
tion of the Universe for private
profit, and they are now con
strained to witness the complic
ity and silence of their Univers
ities on this central moral issue
of our time. They are right if
they feel that a University
which is unable or unwilling to
dissociate itself from the de
velopment of instruments of
torture, murder, and mass de
struction, or with the loathsome
activities of a CIA, is a Univers
ity whose highest officials
should be called to account.
In this situation it is the milit
ant students whose actions re

fleet the real best interest of all
of us, and it is those who are
content to let matters slide who
betray us. It is love for their
University, as distinguished
from its buildings, that moti
vated the CIA demonstrators,
and which motivates the stu
dents now. Their actions will not
destroy the University; they
may instead rejuvenate it.

What If They Agreed
With IJB Decision?
Editor, The Daily:
The extent to which this judi
cial issue has grown amazes me,
and it makes me wonder if the
issue is really the abolution of
the Interim Judicial Board. I
would agree that we need a new
system, but as far as the IJB
goes, it's certainly not more in
iquitous now than it was before
its recent decision. If its immedi
ate dissolution is so important
to so many people, where were
these people before the deci
sion? Why were they not dem
onstrating before?
The only answer, I think, is
that it is not the IJB they op
pose, but rather, it is the fact
that the IJB has dared to make
a decision with which they dis
agree. There is little comment
one can make upon this, I sup
pose, seeing that it is just one
more example of the kind of
onesidedness and bigotry which
seems to be permeating our
society nowadays, on all sides
of the political spectrum.
I realize that the many peo
ple who are taking action
against the IJB are very sin
cere in their beliefs, but I would
have them ask themselves,
"What would have been my re
action, had the IJB upheld the
decision of the Student Judicial
Council?"
EDWARD McCLURE

Will Get You Nowhere
Editor, The Daily:
As a newcomer to the Stan
ford community, I have consist
ently been impressed with the
responsiveness and effectiveness
of the University Administration
vis-a-vis student concerns and

interests. I was especially im
pressed with the performance
of Provost Lyman during the
heat of the crisis which followed
Dr. King's assassination. It is
my own personal belief that the
Administration is intent on im
plementing its promises with re
spect to the position of Blacks
at Stanford, even if some of us
might have wished for more
radical change.
But all this contrasts starkly
with the attitude of the Adminis
tration in the current contro
versy over the IJB ruling. In
deed, for the first time I'm re
minded of conditions at my
alma mater, Columbia Univers
ity. Provost Lyman is quoted in
the Daily of May 7 as stating
categorically that "the IJB is a
thoroughly legitimate body" and
that its abolition would be im
possible "under the kind of pres
sure we now have." It is this
curious kind of "we win, you
lose" logic that has prevailed at
Columbia for the past decade
and a half, and which has led
inevitably to the now famous
confrontation of last week. . . .
When violence came to Colum
bia in 1965 in the form of an
anti-ROTC riot, the Student
Council and liberal faculty
groups mediated the dispute
with the Administration and
won a commitment from the Ad
ministration to form a "Tri-par
tite Committee" which would
formulate a wholly new body of
laws and regulations for the
University. To this day, nothing
has come out of the Committee,
primarily because the Adminis
tration felt under no pressure to
accept, much less support, the
findings of this body.
When the students finally re
bel and take it upon themselves
to force a new order, the Admin
istration responds by saying
that it will not negotiate "un
der pressure." I'm dismayed by
the reaction of Provost Lyman,
and hope that he will once again
find a way to respond construct
ively and in a tangible way to
the long-standing student de
mand for a greater institutional
role in decision-making. Refus
ing to negotiate under pressure
will lead only to greater pres
sure, i.e., violence. Responding
now will break the ice and make
it unnecessary for the students
to escalate their tactics. They
cannot de-escalate, however, un
less they do get some tangible

response: They have learned
from the bitter experience of
years of responsible "diplo
macy" that it will get them no
where.

ity. Provost Lyman is quoted in
the Daily of May 7 as stating
categorically that "the IJB is a
thoroughly legitimate body" and
that its abolition would be im
possible "under the kind of pres
sure we now have." It is this
curious kind of "we win, you
lose" logic that has prevailed at
Columbia for the past decade
and a half, and which has led
inevitably to the now famous
confrontation of last week. . . .
When violence came to Colum
bia in 1965 in the form of an
anti-ROTC riot, the Student
Council and liberal faculty
groups mediated the dispute
with the Administration and
won a commitment from the Ad
ministration to form a "Tri-par
tite Committee" which would
formulate a wholly new body of
laws and regulations for the
University. To this day, nothing
has come out of the Committee,
primarily because the Adminis
tration felt under no pressure to
accept, much less support, the
findings of this body.
When the students finally re
bel and take it upon themselves
to force a new order, the Admin
istration responds by saying
that it will not negotiate "un
der pressure." I'm dismayed by
the reaction of Provost Lyman,
and hope that he will once again
find a way to respond construct
ively and in a tangible way to
the long-standing student de
mand for a greater institutional
role in decision-making. Refus
ing to negotiate under pressure
will lead only to greater pres
sure, i.e., violence. Responding
now will break the ice and make
it unnecessary for the students
to escalate their tactics. They
cannot de-escalate, however, un
less they do get some tangible

response: They have learned
from the bitter experience of
years of responsible "diplo
macy" that it will get them no
where.

Biz School Conducts
Noon Speech Series
Editor, The Daily:
We would like to make a few
observations with respect to the
Biz School "speak-out." A num
ber of students at the Business
School were concerned with pro
viding the Stanford Community
an opportunity to hear our
views with respect to the Ameri
can Scene. We wanted to en
courage dialogue and construc
tive discussion and we wanted
to encourage a mutual under
standing of positions between
our critics and ourselves.
Our speeches managed to hold
the attention of the potential
SDS "teach-in" audience, and the
SDS — that group which is so
critical of the American Estab
lishment — found it necessary
to call upon that very Establish
ment, in the form of the busi
ness school administration, to
discontinue our program. This
technique is somewhat startling,
but it is apparently consistent
with their usual practice of dis
rupting the expression of views
they oppose in their exercise
of their "right of free speech."
Nonetheless, our program is
being continued. We are holding
a series of short-speeches this
week at noon, at the Business
School.

ROTC Falls To Arson
'Second Time Around'
Editor, The Daily:
Fire is terrible the second
time around . . .
Much of the Stanford campus
accepted the first burning down
of the Navy ROTC classroom an
nex on February 19 as an under
standable, if regretable, protest
against ROTC and the war in
Vietnam.
Like a friendly home the
the second time it falls . . .
The reconstructed and enlarg
ed annex would have been avail
able fall quarter to relieve the
overcrowded facilities in the

BAC, presently serving over 400
ROTC students.
Who can say what led us to
this awful crime . . .
In a single week, protestors
have broken into university
buildings, disrupted student ser
vices in the Old Union, and at
tempted to freeze the workings
of the University, all in the
name of reform through disre
gard for law and order.
Makes you think perhaps
that rage, like youth, is wast
ing away the young . . .
Responsible university of
ficials now must try to balance
the examples of responsible stu
dent participation in education
al change against the deadlines
and ultimatums of the harrang
uing militants.
There were those who bet
that arson comes but once, and
yet, I'm so sad we met the

STANFORD CIIAPARRAL
Editor, The Dally:
I was disturbed to hear the re
marks addressed to the students
last night by my colleague, Pro
fessor Meyerhof. As I recall his
words ,he stated, "... I have
been here nineteen years and I
have cometo love this Univers
ity ... . you students have it
in your power now to let it con
tinue to function, or to destroy
it. I hope you will consider your
decision carefully. . ."
The experience of my own
nine years of tenure leads me to
no dispute with the first part
of Mr. Meyerhof's comment. I
derive from it, however, an in
ference very different that the
one he evidently intended.
There is at stake, it seems to
me, a much deeper issue than
the immediate question of dis
ciplinary jurisdiction, and it is
dubious that present formal is
sue would excite much interest
were our times less troubled.
Underlying the discontent, at
Stanford and elsewhere, is the
rather broad question of the
kind of world into which our
students will graduate.
As of this writing it seems to
many of them to be a world of
futility and of terror. It is a
world which the students
neither created nor chose, yet it
is they who will have to bear its
burdens. It will be for them a
kind of taxation without repre
sentation, in which the taxes
are paid in blood—the blood in
the veins of those who must
fight, and the blood on the hands
of those who devise and operate
the machines to produce the
bombs and missiles and jellied
gasoline, and the gases and
chemicals and germs.
Our college youth have been
exposed since birth to the un
savory spectacle of their elders
busily preparing the annihila
tion of the Universe for private
profit, and they are now con
strained to witness the complic
ity and silence of their Univers
ities on this central moral issue
of our time. They are right if
they feel that a University
which is unable or unwilling to
dissociate itself from the de
velopment of instruments of
torture, murder, and mass de
struction, or with the loathsome
activities of a CIA, is a Univers
ity whose highest officials
should be called to account.
In this situation it is the milit
ant students whose actions re

fleet the real best interest of all
of us, and it is those who are
content to let matters slide who
betray us. It is love for their
University, as distinguished
from its buildings, that moti
vated the CIA demonstrators,
and which motivates the stu
dents now. Their actions will not
destroy the University; they
may instead rejuvenate it.

What If They Agreed
With IJB Decision?
Editor, The Daily:
The extent to which this judi
cial issue has grown amazes me,
and it makes me wonder if the
issue is really the abolution of
the Interim Judicial Board. I
would agree that we need a new
system, but as far as the IJB
goes, it's certainly not more in
iquitous now than it was before
its recent decision. If its immedi
ate dissolution is so important
to so many people, where were
these people before the deci
sion? Why were they not dem
onstrating before?
The only answer, I think, is
that it is not the IJB they op
pose, but rather, it is the fact
that the IJB has dared to make
a decision with which they dis
agree. There is little comment
one can make upon this, I sup
pose, seeing that it is just one
more example of the kind of
onesidedness and bigotry which
seems to be permeating our
society nowadays, on all sides
of the political spectrum.
I realize that the many peo
ple who are taking action
against the IJB are very sin
cere in their beliefs, but I would
have them ask themselves,
"What would have been my re
action, had the IJB upheld the
decision of the Student Judicial
Council?"

Editor, The Daily:
As a newcomer to the Stan

ently been impressed with the
responsiveness and effectiveness
of the University Administration
vis-a-vis student concerns and

interests. I was especially im
pressed with the performance
of Provost Lyman during the
heat of the crisis which followed
Dr. King's assassination. It is
my own personal belief that the
Administration is intent on im
plementing its promises with re
spect to the position of Blacks
at Stanford, even if some of us
might have wished for more
radical change.
But all this contrasts starkly
with the attitude of the Adminis

The extent to which this judi
cial issue has grown amazes me,
and it makes me wonder if the
issue is really the abolution of
the Interim Judicial Board. I
would agree that we need a new
system, but as far as the IJB
goes, it's certainly not more in
iquitous now than it was before
its recent decision. If its immedi
ate dissolution is so important
to so many people, where were
these people before the deci
sion? Why were they not dem
onstrating before?
The only answer, I think, is
that it is not the IJB they op
pose, but rather, it is the fact
that the IJB has dared to make
a decision with which they dis
agree. There is little comment
one can make upon this, I sup
pose, seeing that it is just one
more example of the kind of
onesidedness and bigotry which
seems to be permeating our
society nowadays, on all sides
of the political spectrum.
I realize that the many peo
ple who are taking action
against the IJB are very sin
cere in their beliefs, but I would
have them ask themselves,
"What would have been my re
action, had the IJB upheld the
decision of the Student Judicial
Council?"

Editor, The Daily:
As a newcomer to the Stan
ford community, I have consist
ently been impressed with the
responsiveness and effectiveness
of the University Administration
vis-a-vis student concerns and

interests. I was especially im
pressed with the performance
of Provost Lyman during the
heat of the crisis which followed
Dr. King's assassination. It is
my own personal belief that the
Administration is intent on im
plementing its promises with re
spect to the position of Blacks
at Stanford, even if some of us
might have wished for more
radical change.
But all this contrasts starkly
with the attitude of the Adminis
tration in the current contro
versy over the IJB ruling. In
deed, for the first time I'm re
minded of conditions at my
alma mater, Columbia Univers
ity. Provost Lyman is quoted in
the Daily of May 7 as stating
categorically that "the IJB is a
thoroughly legitimate body" and
that its abolition would be im
possible "under the kind of pres
sure we now have." It is this
curious kind of "we win, you
lose" logic that has prevailed at
Columbia for the past decade
and a half, and which has led
inevitably to the now famous
confrontation of last week. . . .
When violence came to Colum
bia in 1965 in the form of an
anti-ROTC riot, the Student
Council and liberal faculty
groups mediated the dispute
with the Administration and
won a commitment from the Ad
ministration to form a "Tri-par
tite Committee" which would
formulate a wholly new body of
laws and regulations for the
University. To this day, nothing
has come out of the Committee,
primarily because the Adminis
tration felt under no pressure to
accept, much less support, the
findings of this body.
When the students finally re
bel and take it upon themselves
to force a new order, the Admin
istration responds by saying
that it will not negotiate "un
der pressure." I'm dismayed by
the reaction of Provost Lyman,
and hope that he will once again
find a way to respond construct
ively and in a tangible way to
the long-standing student de
mand for a greater institutional
role in decision-making. Refus
ing to negotiate under pressure
will lead only to greater pres
sure, i.e., violence. Responding
now will break the ice and make
it unnecessary for the students
to escalate their tactics. They
cannot de-escalate, however, un
less they do get some tangible

response: They have learned
from the bitter experience of
years of responsible "diplo
macy" that it will get them no
where.

Noon Speech Series
Editor, The Daily:
We would like to make a few
observations with respect to the
Biz School "speak-out." A num
ber of students at the Business
School were concerned with pro
viding the Stanford Community
an opportunity to hear our
views with respect to the Ameri
can Scene. We wanted to en
courage dialogue and construc
tive discussion and we wanted
to encourage a mutual under
standing of positions between
our critics and ourselves.
Our speeches managed to hold
the attention of the potential
SDS "teach-in" audience, and the
SDS — that group which is so
critical of the American Estab
lishment — found it necessary
to call upon that very Establish
ment, in the form of the busi
ness school administration, to
discontinue our program. This
technique is somewhat startling,
but it is apparently consistent
with their usual practice of dis
rupting the expression of views
they oppose in their exercise
of their "right of free speech."
Nonetheless, our program is
being continued. We are holding
a series of short-speeches this
week at noon, at the Business
School.

ROTC Falls To Arson
'Second Time Around'
Editor, The Daily:
Fire is terrible the second
time around . . .
Much of the Stanford campus
accepted the first burning down
of the Navy ROTC classroom an
nex on February 19 as an under
standable, if regretable, protest
against ROTC and the war in
Vietnam.
Like a friendly home the
the second time it falls . . .
The reconstructed and enlarg
ed annex would have been avail
able fall quarter to relieve the
overcrowded facilities in the

BAC, presently serving over 400
ROTC students.
Who can say what led us to
this awful crime . . .
In a single week, protestors
have broken into university
buildings, disrupted student ser
vices in the Old Union, and at
tempted to freeze the workings
of the University, all in the
name of reform through disre
gard for law and order.
Makes you think perhaps
that rage, like youth, is wast
ing away the young . . .
Responsible university of
ficials now must try to balance
the examples of responsible stu
dent participation in education
al change against the deadlines
and ultimatums of the harrang
uing militants.
There were those who bet
that arson comes but once, and
yet, I'm so sad we met the
second time around.

STANFORD CIIAPARRAL
Editor, The Dally:
I was disturbed to hear the re
marks addressed to the students
last night by my colleague, Pro
fessor Meyerhof. As I recall his
words ,he stated, "... I have
been here nineteen years and I
have cometo love this Univers
ity ... . you students have it
in your power now to let it con
tinue to function, or to destroy
it. I hope you will consider your
decision carefully. . ."
The experience of my own
nine years of tenure leads me to
no dispute with the first part
of Mr. Meyerhof's comment. I
derive from it, however, an in
ference very different that the
one he evidently intended.
There is at stake, it seems to
me, a much deeper issue than
the immediate question of dis
ciplinary jurisdiction, and it is
dubious that present formal is
sue would excite much interest
were our times less troubled.
Underlying the discontent, at
Stanford and elsewhere, is the
rather broad question of the
kind of world into which our
students will graduate.
As of this writing it seems to
many of them to be a world of
futility and of terror. It is a
world which the students
neither created nor chose, yet it
is they who will have to bear its
burdens. It will be for them a
kind of taxation without repre
sentation, in which the taxes
are paid in blood—the blood in
the veins of those who must
fight, and the blood on the hands
of those who devise and operate
the machines to produce the
bombs and missiles and jellied
gasoline, and the gases and
chemicals and germs.
Our college youth have been
exposed since birth to the un
savory spectacle of their elders
busily preparing the annihila
tion of the Universe for private
profit, and they are now con
strained to witness the complic
ity and silence of their Univers
ities on this central moral issue
of our time. They are right if
they feel that a University
which is unable or unwilling to
dissociate itself from the de
velopment of instruments of
torture, murder, and mass de
struction, or with the loathsome
activities of a CIA, is a Univers
ity whose highest officials
should be called to account.
In this situation it is the milit
ant students whose actions re

fleet the real best interest of all
of us, and it is those who are
content to let matters slide who
betray us. It is love for their
University, as distinguished
from its buildings, that moti
vated the CIA demonstrators,
and which motivates the stu
dents now. Their actions will not
destroy the University; they
may instead rejuvenate it.
