## Governing A Community Of Scholars 
### 
(Following 1 are excerpts from a
letter that Victor Hori, a gradu
ate student in the Philosophy
department, sent to Provost
Richard Lyman. Mr. Hori cited
several examples of reform in
Canadian universities, which we
regretfully omit here due to
lack of space.)
Dear Provost Lyman:
When the Black Students' Un
ion camc forward with its set
of ten demands, the University
responded by stating that it was
the matter and not the manner
of presentation of the ten de
mands that was important. It
was only under such an assump
tion that the University could
consider acting upon these ten
demands. Yet both during and
after the negotiations with the
8.5. U., it was quite clear that
the real point at issue was not
the matter but the manner; that
is, the significant issue was not
the substance of the ten de
mands but the face-to-face con
frontation of administrative
authority with the power of the
B.S.U. and its white student
support. The larger issue which
was raised was the general
question of student participa
tion in university government.
At one BSU meeting, Vice-
Provost Herbert Packer made
the statement that the Univers
ity is not a monolith. It was, he
said, false to think that all
power in the University was
gathered into the hands of one
man, or even of a small group
of men. Very much the same
point was made by Professor
Donald Kennedy in a letter to
the Daily on Friday, April 19.
Both of these men have
missed the point. Whether or
not decisions are made by one
man or by a group of men is
not at issue. The point is that
these decisions are made, for the
most part, without the knowl
edge, advice or consent of stu
dents. The feature which a mon
olith and the modern university
have in common is the fact that
decision-making is closed to stu
dents.
The conflict between students
and administrators should not
be characterized merely in
terms of power and authority to
make decisions. At root, the con
flict between students and ad
ministrators Is a manifestation
of a conflict between two con
ceptions of the university. Is
the university a community of
scholars, that is, a civil polity
to bo governed, or is it a bureau
cracy, not to be governed, but
to be administered? The official

answer, sincerely given by most
administrators, is that the uni
versity Is indeed a civil polity
to be governed, that the admin
istrator's role is to be catalyst
and .co-ordinator but certainly
not controller. To most students,
the official answer does not ring
true.
Most students see that the uni
versity is, in Clark Kerr's
phrase, "a mechanism, held to
gether by administrative rules
and powered by money." In such
an institution, the locus of power
shifts away from the Academic
Council and the structure of uni
versity government, to the
Board of Trustees and the ma
chinery of administration. Con
sequently the official view that
the university is a community
scholars to be governed by schol
ars appears as little more than
false words in the face of blunt
facts. . . .
In my view, the situation at
Stanford is very bad indeed;
there is university administra
tion here, but in truth, we can
not say that there is university
government here. What steps
are necessary to institute uni
versity government at Stanford?
There are three road blocks to
radical reform of university gov
ernment at Stanford—the timid
ity of faculty, the disorganiza
tion of students, the recalcit
rance of administration. It is
true that the faculty are shaping
a more effective Academic Coun
cil; but there has been no dis
cussion of faculty participation
in the areas of responsibility
now under the jurisdiction of
the Board of Trustees.
If the university really is a
community of scholars, then
scholars should have some say
at the highest level of decision
making. Consequently the ques
tion of strong faculty participa
tion in Board affairs must
squarely be faced.
A second roadblock is the dis
organization of students. From
my view, the ASSU suffers from
poor structure —its legislature is
too large, its structure provides
neither training for initiates ot
student politics, nor continuity
of membership or policy from
year to year; its constituencies
do not penetrate the campus in
a politically effective manner; it
does not control its own fi
nances. Witrt weak political
structure and an unsophisticated
student political culture, it will
be a long time before students
at Stanford will be able to make
a place for themselves in uni
versity government.

The third roadblock is the re
calcitrance of administration. It
is a principle of good govern
ment, though not necessarily of
good administration, that there
should be channels by which the
populace can articulate their
opinions and speak on behalf
of their interests. The irritating
fact is that at Stanford there
are very few channels by which
students can present an issue
before the university and ask
for some decision.
Consider, for example, the
Placement Service's involvement
with the Dow Chemical Com
pany and the C.I.A. How could
students have brought this is
sue before the university with
out resorting to an open pro
test? The fact is that there is
no place where students can go
to present such issues for gen
eral discussion; there are no
legitimate channels by which
students can articulate their
opinions and expect to have any
influence on decisions within
the university. It is true that the
university is not a monolith in
th° sense that all decisions are
made by one man. Decisions are
made by consultation and con
sensus; yet those decisions are
made without the consultation
and consent of students.
Of all the problems that are
dealt with by the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford, university
government is surely one of the
most important. Yet I have read
the minutes of the S.E.S. Uni
versity Government (TTE), and
to all appearances, that commit
tee has hardly been active. The
few times the committee has
met, it has (with the exception
of Professor Arrow's proposals
for the Academic Council) been
concerned with the minutiae of
defining the responsibilities of
one or another of the adminis
trative positions in the univers
ity.
What is needed is a re-exam
ination of the fundamental roles
to be played by faculty, adminis
trators, Board members, and
students within university gov
ernment. What is needed is a
public debate to scrutinize the
present disposition of power and
authority in the university. The
S.E.S. presents us with a strik
ing opportunity for university
reform. But the opportunity for
reform will not become an ac
complishment unless there is a
widespread consciousness of the
possible directions which reform
can take. The public debate on
university government should
start now.

reply to Mr. Hori's letter.)
Dear Mr. Hori:
I have read with considerable
interest — and varying degrees
of agreement and disagreement
— your long letter on university
government. . . .
It does seem to me that you
place far-away events in reason
able perspective, while not sur
prisingly failing to do so when it
comes to things closer to Stan
ford. For example, you stress the
need for reforms to make louder
and clearer the faculty's voice
at Stanford, yet you appear to
dismiss the creation of the Aca
demic Senate, on which respon
sible faculty leaders have been
working hard all year, as hard
ly more than a trivial rear
rangement.
You also give far less credit
than seems to me due to those
students who sit on University
committees here — both those
of the Academic Council and
thos« appointed directly by the
President. Students have had
more to do with planning devel
opments here than you appear
to realize, and this has some
times included the planning of
buildings. Student committee
members played a crucial role,
for instance, in the decision, now
frequently criticized, to build
Tresidder Union's dining facili
ties as one large room, rather
than a series of smaller rooms
designed for a variety of func
tions.
This year, for the first time,
student members are serving on
the Committee on Land and
Building Development. Student
members of such committees
as Undergraduate Education and
General Studies have done in
valuable work, and provided a
channel for student opinion to
reach into the heart of university
decision-making. (Unhappily it
must also be admitted that a
common complaint from student
committee members has been
that their fellow • students seem
ed unaware of their presence
on the committee, and uninter
ested in contributing ideas or
criticisms to help them in their
committee work.)
Concerning the Board of Trus
tees, the entire subject of Board-
University relationships in the
United States 'or specifically at
Stanford) is, of course, a legiti
mate one for debate. There is
much to be said for diversifica
tion of Board membership, and
many of us have said it from
time to time.
On the other hand there are
good reasons for questioning the

wisdom of appointing faculty
members to the Boards of their
own institutions. I incline to
wards the view that faculty
members from other institutions
are more likely to be able to con
tribute effectively to Trustee dis
cussions and decision-making, be
cause they can speak and act
without reference to intra-Uni
versity political pressures.
Concerning; your basic prem
ise — that the University is
"a community of scholars,"
I'm not sure how far that car
ries us in deciding how best to
govern the institution. That it
is to be "governed, not admin
istered," strikes me as part
truism, part false antithesis:
every government includes an
administrative element among
others, and the tough ques
tions of delineating the prop
er sphere within government
for the administrative part
cannot be answered simply by
a phrase. I don't suppose that
anyone imagines that these
same questions have found an
ideal answer at Stanford —
or any other place.
Finally, if you can interest a
substantial number of students
in the problems of "the gover
nance of the University," and sus
tain that interest to the point of
producing a continuing and con
structive contribution towards
solving them, you'll have done a
remarkable and laudable thing.

RICHARD W. LYMAN
(Following 1 are excerpts from a
letter that Victor Hori, a gradu
ate student in the Philosophy
department, sent to Provost
Richard Lyman. Mr. Hori cited
several examples of reform in
Canadian universities, which we
regretfully omit here due to
lack of space.)
Dear Provost Lyman:
When the Black Students' Un
ion camc forward with its set
of ten demands, the University
responded by stating that it was
the matter and not the manner
of presentation of the ten de
mands that was important. It
was only under such an assump
tion that the University could
consider acting upon these ten
demands. Yet both during and
after the negotiations with the
8.5. U., it was quite clear that
the real point at issue was not
the matter but the manner; that
is, the significant issue was not
the substance of the ten de
mands but the face-to-face con
frontation of administrative
authority with the power of the
B.S.U. and its white student
support. The larger issue which
was raised was the general
question of student participa
tion in university government.
At one BSU meeting, Vice-
Provost Herbert Packer made
the statement that the Univers
ity is not a monolith. It was, he
said, false to think that all
power in the University was
gathered into the hands of one
man, or even of a small group
of men. Very much the same
point was made by Professor
Donald Kennedy in a letter to
the Daily on Friday, April 19.
Both of these men have
missed the point. Whether or
not decisions are made by one
man or by a group of men is
not at issue. The point is that
these decisions are made, for the
most part, without the knowl
edge, advice or consent of stu
dents. The feature which a mon
olith and the modern university
have in common is the fact that
decision-making is closed to stu
dents.
The conflict between students
and administrators should not
be characterized merely in
terms of power and authority to
make decisions. At root, the con
flict between students and ad
ministrators Is a manifestation
of a conflict between two con
ceptions of the university. Is
the university a community of
scholars, that is, a civil polity
to bo governed, or is it a bureau
cracy, not to be governed, but
to be administered? The official

answer, sincerely given by most
administrators, is that the uni
versity Is indeed a civil polity
to be governed, that the admin
istrator's role is to be catalyst
and .co-ordinator but certainly
not controller. To most students,
the official answer does not ring
true.
Most students see that the uni
versity is, in Clark Kerr's
phrase, "a mechanism, held to
gether by administrative rules
and powered by money." In such
an institution, the locus of power
shifts away from the Academic
Council and the structure of uni
versity government, to the
Board of Trustees and the ma
chinery of administration. Con
sequently the official view that
the university is a community
scholars to be governed by schol
ars appears as little more than
false words in the face of blunt
facts. . . .
In my view, the situation at
Stanford is very bad indeed;
there is university administra
tion here, but in truth, we can
not say that there is university
government here. What steps
are necessary to institute uni
versity government at Stanford?
There are three road blocks to
radical reform of university gov
ernment at Stanford—the timid
ity of faculty, the disorganiza
tion of students, the recalcit
rance of administration. It is
true that the faculty are shaping
a more effective Academic Coun
cil; but there has been no dis
cussion of faculty participation
in the areas of responsibility
now under the jurisdiction of
the Board of Trustees.
If the university really is a
community of scholars, then
scholars should have some say
at the highest level of decision
making. Consequently the ques
tion of strong faculty participa
tion in Board affairs must
squarely be faced.
A second roadblock is the dis
organization of students. From
my view, the ASSU suffers from
poor structure —its legislature is
too large, its structure provides
neither training for initiates ot
student politics, nor continuity
of membership or policy from
year to year; its constituencies
do not penetrate the campus in
a politically effective manner; it
does not control its own fi
nances. Witrt weak political
structure and an unsophisticated
student political culture, it will
be a long time before students
at Stanford will be able to make
a place for themselves in uni
versity government.

The third roadblock is the re
calcitrance of administration. It
is a principle of good govern
ment, though not necessarily of
good administration, that there
should be channels by which the
populace can articulate their
opinions and speak on behalf
of their interests. The irritating
fact is that at Stanford there
are very few channels by which
students can present an issue
before the university and ask
for some decision.
Consider, for example, the
Placement Service's involvement
with the Dow Chemical Com
pany and the C.I.A. How could
students have brought this is
sue before the university with
out resorting to an open pro
test? The fact is that there is
no place where students can go
to present such issues for gen
eral discussion; there are no
legitimate channels by which
students can articulate their
opinions and expect to have any
influence on decisions within
the university. It is true that the
university is not a monolith in
th° sense that all decisions are
made by one man. Decisions are
made by consultation and con
sensus; yet those decisions are
made without the consultation
and consent of students.
Of all the problems that are
dealt with by the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford, university
government is surely one of the
most important. Yet I have read
the minutes of the S.E.S. Uni
versity Government (TTE), and
to all appearances, that commit
tee has hardly been active. The
few times the committee has
met, it has (with the exception
of Professor Arrow's proposals
for the Academic Council) been
concerned with the minutiae of
defining the responsibilities of
one or another of the adminis
trative positions in the univers
ity.
What is needed is a re-exam
ination of the fundamental roles
to be played by faculty, adminis
trators, Board members, and
students within university gov
ernment. What is needed is a
public debate to scrutinize the
present disposition of power and
authority in the university. The
S.E.S. presents us with a strik
ing opportunity for university
reform. But the opportunity for
reform will not become an ac
complishment unless there is a
widespread consciousness of the
possible directions which reform
can take. The public debate on
university government should
start now.

(Below is Provost Lyman's
reply to Mr. Hori's letter.)
Dear Mr. Hori:
I have read with considerable
interest — and varying degrees
of agreement and disagreement
— your long letter on university
government. . . .
It does seem to me that you
place far-away events in reason
able perspective, while not sur
prisingly failing to do so when it
comes to things closer to Stan
ford. For example, you stress the
need for reforms to make louder
and clearer the faculty's voice
at Stanford, yet you appear to
dismiss the creation of the Aca
demic Senate, on which respon
sible faculty leaders have been
working hard all year, as hard
ly more than a trivial rear
rangement.
You also give far less credit
than seems to me due to those
students who sit on University
committees here — both those
of the Academic Council and
thos« appointed directly by the
President. Students have had
more to do with planning devel
opments here than you appear
to realize, and this has some
times included the planning of
buildings. Student committee
members played a crucial role,
for instance, in the decision, now
frequently criticized, to build
Tresidder Union's dining facili
ties as one large room, rather
than a series of smaller rooms
designed for a variety of func
tions.
This year, for the first time,
student members are serving on
the Committee on Land and
Building Development. Student
members of such committees
as Undergraduate Education and
General Studies have done in
valuable work, and provided a
channel for student opinion to
reach into the heart of university
decision-making. (Unhappily it
must also be admitted that a
common complaint from student
committee members has been
that their fellow • students seem
ed unaware of their presence
on the committee, and uninter
ested in contributing ideas or
criticisms to help them in their
committee work.)
Concerning the Board of Trus
tees, the entire subject of Board-
University relationships in the
United States 'or specifically at
Stanford) is, of course, a legiti
mate one for debate. There is
much to be said for diversifica
tion of Board membership, and
many of us have said it from
time to time.
On the other hand there are
good reasons for questioning the

wisdom of appointing faculty
members to the Boards of their
own institutions. I incline to
wards the view that faculty
members from other institutions
are more likely to be able to con
tribute effectively to Trustee dis
cussions and decision-making, be
cause they can speak and act
without reference to intra-Uni
versity political pressures.
Concerning; your basic prem
ise — that the University is
"a community of scholars,"
I'm not sure how far that car
ries us in deciding how best to
govern the institution. That it
is to be "governed, not admin
istered," strikes me as part
truism, part false antithesis:
every government includes an
administrative element among
others, and the tough ques
tions of delineating the prop
er sphere within government
for the administrative part
cannot be answered simply by
a phrase. I don't suppose that
anyone imagines that these
same questions have found an
ideal answer at Stanford —
or any other place.
Finally, if you can interest a
substantial number of students
in the problems of "the gover
nance of the University," and sus
tain that interest to the point of
producing a continuing and con
structive contribution towards
solving them, you'll have done a
remarkable and laudable thing.

RICHARD W. LYMAN
(Following 1 are excerpts from a
letter that Victor Hori, a gradu
ate student in the Philosophy
department, sent to Provost
Richard Lyman. Mr. Hori cited
several examples of reform in
Canadian universities, which we
regretfully omit here due to
lack of space.)
Dear Provost Lyman:
When the Black Students' Un
ion camc forward with its set
of ten demands, the University
responded by stating that it was
the matter and not the manner
of presentation of the ten de
mands that was important. It
was only under such an assump
tion that the University could
consider acting upon these ten
demands. Yet both during and
after the negotiations with the
8.5. U., it was quite clear that
the real point at issue was not
the matter but the manner; that
is, the significant issue was not
the substance of the ten de
mands but the face-to-face con
frontation of administrative
authority with the power of the
B.S.U. and its white student
support. The larger issue which
was raised was the general
question of student participa
tion in university government.
At one BSU meeting, Vice-
Provost Herbert Packer made
the statement that the Univers
ity is not a monolith. It was, he
said, false to think that all
power in the University was
gathered into the hands of one
man, or even of a small group
of men. Very much the same
point was made by Professor
Donald Kennedy in a letter to
the Daily on Friday, April 19.
Both of these men have
missed the point. Whether or
not decisions are made by one
man or by a group of men is
not at issue. The point is that
these decisions are made, for the
most part, without the knowl
edge, advice or consent of stu
dents. The feature which a mon
olith and the modern university
have in common is the fact that
decision-making is closed to stu
dents.
The conflict between students
and administrators should not
be characterized merely in
terms of power and authority to
make decisions. At root, the con
flict between students and ad
ministrators Is a manifestation
of a conflict between two con
ceptions of the university. Is
the university a community of
scholars, that is, a civil polity
to bo governed, or is it a bureau
cracy, not to be governed, but
to be administered? The official

answer, sincerely given by most
administrators, is that the uni
versity Is indeed a civil polity
to be governed, that the admin
istrator's role is to be catalyst
and .co-ordinator but certainly
not controller. To most students,
the official answer does not ring
true.
Most students see that the uni
versity is, in Clark Kerr's
phrase, "a mechanism, held to
gether by administrative rules
and powered by money." In such
an institution, the locus of power
shifts away from the Academic
Council and the structure of uni
versity government, to the
Board of Trustees and the ma
chinery of administration. Con
sequently the official view that
the university is a community
scholars to be governed by schol
ars appears as little more than
false words in the face of blunt
facts. . . .
In my view, the situation at
Stanford is very bad indeed;
there is university administra
tion here, but in truth, we can
not say that there is university
government here. What steps
are necessary to institute uni
versity government at Stanford?
There are three road blocks to
radical reform of university gov
ernment at Stanford—the timid
ity of faculty, the disorganiza
tion of students, the recalcit
rance of administration. It is
true that the faculty are shaping
a more effective Academic Coun
cil; but there has been no dis
cussion of faculty participation
in the areas of responsibility
now under the jurisdiction of
the Board of Trustees.
If the university really is a
community of scholars, then
scholars should have some say
at the highest level of decision
making. Consequently the ques
tion of strong faculty participa
tion in Board affairs must
squarely be faced.
A second roadblock is the dis
organization of students. From
my view, the ASSU suffers from
poor structure —its legislature is
too large, its structure provides
neither training for initiates ot
student politics, nor continuity
of membership or policy from
year to year; its constituencies
do not penetrate the campus in
a politically effective manner; it
does not control its own fi
nances. Witrt weak political
structure and an unsophisticated
student political culture, it will
be a long time before students
at Stanford will be able to make
a place for themselves in uni
versity government.

The third roadblock is the re
calcitrance of administration. It
is a principle of good govern
ment, though not necessarily of
good administration, that there
should be channels by which the
populace can articulate their
opinions and speak on behalf
of their interests. The irritating
fact is that at Stanford there
are very few channels by which
students can present an issue
before the university and ask
for some decision.
Consider, for example, the
Placement Service's involvement
with the Dow Chemical Com
pany and the C.I.A. How could
students have brought this is
sue before the university with
out resorting to an open pro
test? The fact is that there is
no place where students can go
to present such issues for gen
eral discussion; there are no
legitimate channels by which
students can articulate their
opinions and expect to have any
influence on decisions within
the university. It is true that the
university is not a monolith in
th° sense that all decisions are
made by one man. Decisions are
made by consultation and con
sensus; yet those decisions are
made without the consultation
and consent of students.
Of all the problems that are
dealt with by the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford, university
government is surely one of the
most important. Yet I have read
the minutes of the S.E.S. Uni
versity Government (TTE), and
to all appearances, that commit
tee has hardly been active. The
few times the committee has
met, it has (with the exception
of Professor Arrow's proposals
for the Academic Council) been
concerned with the minutiae of
defining the responsibilities of
one or another of the adminis
trative positions in the univers
ity.
What is needed is a re-exam
ination of the fundamental roles
to be played by faculty, adminis
trators, Board members, and
students within university gov
ernment. What is needed is a
public debate to scrutinize the
present disposition of power and
authority in the university. The
S.E.S. presents us with a strik
ing opportunity for university
reform. But the opportunity for
reform will not become an ac
complishment unless there is a
widespread consciousness of the
possible directions which reform
can take. The public debate on
university government should
start now.

(Below is Provost Lyman's
reply to Mr. Hori's letter.)
Dear Mr. Hori:
I have read with considerable
interest — and varying degrees
of agreement and disagreement
— your long letter on university
government. . . .
It does seem to me that you
place far-away events in reason
able perspective, while not sur
prisingly failing to do so when it
comes to things closer to Stan
ford. For example, you stress the
need for reforms to make louder
and clearer the faculty's voice
at Stanford, yet you appear to
dismiss the creation of the Aca
demic Senate, on which respon
sible faculty leaders have been
working hard all year, as hard
ly more than a trivial rear
rangement.
You also give far less credit
than seems to me due to those
students who sit on University
committees here — both those
of the Academic Council and
thos« appointed directly by the
President. Students have had
more to do with planning devel
opments here than you appear
to realize, and this has some
times included the planning of
buildings. Student committee
members played a crucial role,
for instance, in the decision, now
frequently criticized, to build
Tresidder Union's dining facili
ties as one large room, rather
than a series of smaller rooms
designed for a variety of func
tions.
This year, for the first time,
student members are serving on
the Committee on Land and
Building Development. Student
members of such committees
as Undergraduate Education and
General Studies have done in
valuable work, and provided a
channel for student opinion to
reach into the heart of university
decision-making. (Unhappily it
must also be admitted that a
common complaint from student
committee members has been
that their fellow • students seem
ed unaware of their presence
on the committee, and uninter
ested in contributing ideas or
criticisms to help them in their
committee work.)
Concerning the Board of Trus
tees, the entire subject of Board-
University relationships in the
United States 'or specifically at
Stanford) is, of course, a legiti
mate one for debate. There is
much to be said for diversifica
tion of Board membership, and
many of us have said it from
time to time.
On the other hand there are
good reasons for questioning the

wisdom of appointing faculty
members to the Boards of their
own institutions. I incline to
wards the view that faculty
members from other institutions
are more likely to be able to con
tribute effectively to Trustee dis
cussions and decision-making, be
cause they can speak and act
without reference to intra-Uni
versity political pressures.
Concerning; your basic prem
ise — that the University is
"a community of scholars,"
I'm not sure how far that car
ries us in deciding how best to
govern the institution. That it
is to be "governed, not admin
istered," strikes me as part
truism, part false antithesis:
every government includes an
administrative element among
others, and the tough ques
tions of delineating the prop
er sphere within government
for the administrative part
cannot be answered simply by
a phrase. I don't suppose that
anyone imagines that these
same questions have found an
ideal answer at Stanford —
or any other place.
Finally, if you can interest a
substantial number of students
in the problems of "the gover
nance of the University," and sus
tain that interest to the point of
producing a continuing and con
structive contribution towards
solving them, you'll have done a

substantial number of students
in the problems of "the gover

remarkable and laudable thing.
RICHARD W. LYMAN
(Following 1 are excerpts from a
letter that Victor Hori, a gradu
ate student in the Philosophy
department, sent to Provost
Richard Lyman. Mr. Hori cited
several examples of reform in
Canadian universities, which we
regretfully omit here due to
lack of space.)
Dear Provost Lyman:
When the Black Students' Un
ion camc forward with its set
of ten demands, the University
responded by stating that it was
the matter and not the manner
of presentation of the ten de
mands that was important. It
was only under such an assump
tion that the University could
consider acting upon these ten
demands. Yet both during and
after the negotiations with the
8.5. U., it was quite clear that
the real point at issue was not
the matter but the manner; that
is, the significant issue was not
the substance of the ten de
mands but the face-to-face con
frontation of administrative
authority with the power of the
B.S.U. and its white student
support. The larger issue which
was raised was the general
question of student participa
tion in university government.
At one BSU meeting, Vice-
Provost Herbert Packer made
the statement that the Univers
ity is not a monolith. It was, he
said, false to think that all
power in the University was
gathered into the hands of one
man, or even of a small group
of men. Very much the same
point was made by Professor
Donald Kennedy in a letter to
the Daily on Friday, April 19.
Both of these men have
missed the point. Whether or
not decisions are made by one
man or by a group of men is
not at issue. The point is that
these decisions are made, for the
most part, without the knowl
edge, advice or consent of stu
dents. The feature which a mon
olith and the modern university
have in common is the fact that
decision-making is closed to stu
dents.
The conflict between students
and administrators should not
be characterized merely in
terms of power and authority to
make decisions. At root, the con
flict between students and ad
ministrators Is a manifestation
of a conflict between two con
ceptions of the university. Is
the university a community of
scholars, that is, a civil polity
to bo governed, or is it a bureau
cracy, not to be governed, but
to be administered? The official

answer, sincerely given by most
administrators, is that the uni
versity Is indeed a civil polity
to be governed, that the admin
istrator's role is to be catalyst
and .co-ordinator but certainly
not controller. To most students,
the official answer does not ring
true.
Most students see that the uni
versity is, in Clark Kerr's
phrase, "a mechanism, held to
gether by administrative rules
and powered by money." In such
an institution, the locus of power
shifts away from the Academic
Council and the structure of uni
versity government, to the
Board of Trustees and the ma
chinery of administration. Con
sequently the official view that
the university is a community
scholars to be governed by schol
ars appears as little more than
false words in the face of blunt
facts. . . .
In my view, the situation at
Stanford is very bad indeed;
there is university administra
tion here, but in truth, we can
not say that there is university
government here. What steps
are necessary to institute uni
versity government at Stanford?
There are three road blocks to
radical reform of university gov
ernment at Stanford—the timid
ity of faculty, the disorganiza
tion of students, the recalcit
rance of administration. It is
true that the faculty are shaping
a more effective Academic Coun
cil; but there has been no dis
cussion of faculty participation
in the areas of responsibility
now under the jurisdiction of
the Board of Trustees.
If the university really is a
community of scholars, then
scholars should have some say
at the highest level of decision
making. Consequently the ques
tion of strong faculty participa
tion in Board affairs must
squarely be faced.
A second roadblock is the dis
organization of students. From
my view, the ASSU suffers from
poor structure —its legislature is
too large, its structure provides
neither training for initiates ot
student politics, nor continuity
of membership or policy from
year to year; its constituencies
do not penetrate the campus in
a politically effective manner; it
does not control its own fi
nances. Witrt weak political
structure and an unsophisticated
student political culture, it will
be a long time before students
at Stanford will be able to make
a place for themselves in uni
versity government.

The third roadblock is the re
calcitrance of administration. It
is a principle of good govern
ment, though not necessarily of
good administration, that there
should be channels by which the
populace can articulate their
opinions and speak on behalf
of their interests. The irritating
fact is that at Stanford there
are very few channels by which
students can present an issue
before the university and ask
for some decision.
Consider, for example, the
Placement Service's involvement
with the Dow Chemical Com
pany and the C.I.A. How could
students have brought this is
sue before the university with
out resorting to an open pro
test? The fact is that there is
no place where students can go
to present such issues for gen
eral discussion; there are no
legitimate channels by which
students can articulate their
opinions and expect to have any
influence on decisions within
the university. It is true that the
university is not a monolith in
th° sense that all decisions are
made by one man. Decisions are
made by consultation and con
sensus; yet those decisions are
made without the consultation
and consent of students.
Of all the problems that are
dealt with by the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford, university
government is surely one of the
most important. Yet I have read
the minutes of the S.E.S. Uni
versity Government (TTE), and
to all appearances, that commit
tee has hardly been active. The
few times the committee has
met, it has (with the exception
of Professor Arrow's proposals
for the Academic Council) been
concerned with the minutiae of
defining the responsibilities of
one or another of the adminis
trative positions in the univers
ity.
What is needed is a re-exam
ination of the fundamental roles
to be played by faculty, adminis
trators, Board members, and
students within university gov
ernment. What is needed is a
public debate to scrutinize the
present disposition of power and
authority in the university. The
S.E.S. presents us with a strik
ing opportunity for university
reform. But the opportunity for
reform will not become an ac
complishment unless there is a
widespread consciousness of the
possible directions which reform
can take. The public debate on
university government should
start now.

(Below is Provost Lyman's
reply to Mr. Hori's letter.)
Dear Mr. Hori:
I have read with considerable
interest — and varying degrees
of agreement and disagreement
— your long letter on university
government. . . .
It does seem to me that you
place far-away events in reason
able perspective, while not sur
prisingly failing to do so when it
comes to things closer to Stan
ford. For example, you stress the
need for reforms to make louder
and clearer the faculty's voice
at Stanford, yet you appear to
dismiss the creation of the Aca
demic Senate, on which respon
sible faculty leaders have been
working hard all year, as hard
ly more than a trivial rear
rangement.
You also give far less credit
than seems to me due to those
students who sit on University
committees here — both those
of the Academic Council and
thos« appointed directly by the
President. Students have had
more to do with planning devel
opments here than you appear
to realize, and this has some
times included the planning of
buildings. Student committee
members played a crucial role,
for instance, in the decision, now
frequently criticized, to build
Tresidder Union's dining facili
ties as one large room, rather
than a series of smaller rooms
designed for a variety of func
tions.
This year, for the first time,
student members are serving on
the Committee on Land and
Building Development. Student
members of such committees
as Undergraduate Education and
General Studies have done in
valuable work, and provided a
channel for student opinion to
reach into the heart of university
decision-making. (Unhappily it
must also be admitted that a
common complaint from student
committee members has been
that their fellow • students seem
ed unaware of their presence
on the committee, and uninter
ested in contributing ideas or
criticisms to help them in their
committee work.)
Concerning the Board of Trus
tees, the entire subject of Board-
University relationships in the
United States 'or specifically at
Stanford) is, of course, a legiti
mate one for debate. There is
much to be said for diversifica
tion of Board membership, and
many of us have said it from
time to time.
On the other hand there are
good reasons for questioning the

wisdom of appointing faculty
members to the Boards of their
own institutions. I incline to
wards the view that faculty
members from other institutions
are more likely to be able to con
tribute effectively to Trustee dis
cussions and decision-making, be
cause they can speak and act
without reference to intra-Uni
versity political pressures.
Concerning; your basic prem
ise — that the University is
"a community of scholars,"
I'm not sure how far that car
ries us in deciding how best to
govern the institution. That it
is to be "governed, not admin
istered," strikes me as part
truism, part false antithesis:
every government includes an
administrative element among
others, and the tough ques
tions of delineating the prop
er sphere within government
for the administrative part
cannot be answered simply by
a phrase. I don't suppose that
anyone imagines that these
same questions have found an
ideal answer at Stanford —
or any other place.
Finally, if you can interest a
substantial number of students
in the problems of "the gover

RICHARD W. LYMAN
(Following 1 are excerpts from a
letter that Victor Hori, a gradu
ate student in the Philosophy
department, sent to Provost
Richard Lyman. Mr. Hori cited
several examples of reform in
Canadian universities, which we
regretfully omit here due to
lack of space.)
Dear Provost Lyman:
When the Black Students' Un
ion camc forward with its set
of ten demands, the University
responded by stating that it was
the matter and not the manner
of presentation of the ten de
mands that was important. It
was only under such an assump
tion that the University could
consider acting upon these ten
demands. Yet both during and
after the negotiations with the
8.5. U., it was quite clear that
the real point at issue was not
the matter but the manner; that
is, the significant issue was not
the substance of the ten de
mands but the face-to-face con
frontation of administrative
authority with the power of the
B.S.U. and its white student
support. The larger issue which
was raised was the general
question of student participa
tion in university government.
At one BSU meeting, Vice-
Provost Herbert Packer made
the statement that the Univers
ity is not a monolith. It was, he
said, false to think that all
power in the University was
gathered into the hands of one
man, or even of a small group
of men. Very much the same
point was made by Professor
Donald Kennedy in a letter to
the Daily on Friday, April 19.
Both of these men have
missed the point. Whether or
not decisions are made by one
man or by a group of men is
not at issue. The point is that
these decisions are made, for the
most part, without the knowl
edge, advice or consent of stu
dents. The feature which a mon
olith and the modern university
have in common is the fact that
decision-making is closed to stu
dents.
The conflict between students
and administrators should not
be characterized merely in
terms of power and authority to
make decisions. At root, the con
flict between students and ad
ministrators Is a manifestation
of a conflict between two con
ceptions of the university. Is
the university a community of
scholars, that is, a civil polity
to bo governed, or is it a bureau
cracy, not to be governed, but
to be administered? The official

answer, sincerely given by most
administrators, is that the uni
versity Is indeed a civil polity
to be governed, that the admin
istrator's role is to be catalyst
and .co-ordinator but certainly
not controller. To most students,
the official answer does not ring
true.
Most students see that the uni
versity is, in Clark Kerr's
phrase, "a mechanism, held to
gether by administrative rules
and powered by money." In such
an institution, the locus of power
shifts away from the Academic
Council and the structure of uni
versity government, to the
Board of Trustees and the ma
chinery of administration. Con
sequently the official view that
the university is a community
scholars to be governed by schol
ars appears as little more than
false words in the face of blunt
facts. . . .
In my view, the situation at
Stanford is very bad indeed;
there is university administra
tion here, but in truth, we can
not say that there is university
government here. What steps
are necessary to institute uni
versity government at Stanford?
There are three road blocks to
radical reform of university gov
ernment at Stanford—the timid
ity of faculty, the disorganiza
tion of students, the recalcit
rance of administration. It is
true that the faculty are shaping
a more effective Academic Coun
cil; but there has been no dis
cussion of faculty participation
in the areas of responsibility
now under the jurisdiction of
the Board of Trustees.
If the university really is a
community of scholars, then
scholars should have some say
at the highest level of decision
making. Consequently the ques
tion of strong faculty participa
tion in Board affairs must
squarely be faced.
A second roadblock is the dis
organization of students. From
my view, the ASSU suffers from
poor structure —its legislature is
too large, its structure provides
neither training for initiates ot
student politics, nor continuity
of membership or policy from
year to year; its constituencies
do not penetrate the campus in
a politically effective manner; it
does not control its own fi
nances. Witrt weak political
structure and an unsophisticated
student political culture, it will
be a long time before students
at Stanford will be able to make
a place for themselves in uni
versity government.

The third roadblock is the re
calcitrance of administration. It
is a principle of good govern
ment, though not necessarily of
good administration, that there
should be channels by which the
populace can articulate their
opinions and speak on behalf
of their interests. The irritating
fact is that at Stanford there
are very few channels by which
students can present an issue
before the university and ask
for some decision.
Consider, for example, the
Placement Service's involvement
with the Dow Chemical Com
pany and the C.I.A. How could
students have brought this is
sue before the university with
out resorting to an open pro
test? The fact is that there is
no place where students can go
to present such issues for gen
eral discussion; there are no
legitimate channels by which
students can articulate their
opinions and expect to have any
influence on decisions within
the university. It is true that the
university is not a monolith in
th° sense that all decisions are
made by one man. Decisions are
made by consultation and con
sensus; yet those decisions are
made without the consultation
and consent of students.
Of all the problems that are
dealt with by the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford, university
government is surely one of the
most important. Yet I have read
the minutes of the S.E.S. Uni
versity Government (TTE), and
to all appearances, that commit
tee has hardly been active. The
few times the committee has
met, it has (with the exception
of Professor Arrow's proposals
for the Academic Council) been
concerned with the minutiae of
defining the responsibilities of
one or another of the adminis
trative positions in the univers
ity.
What is needed is a re-exam
ination of the fundamental roles
to be played by faculty, adminis
trators, Board members, and
students within university gov
ernment. What is needed is a
public debate to scrutinize the
present disposition of power and
authority in the university. The
S.E.S. presents us with a strik
ing opportunity for university
reform. But the opportunity for
reform will not become an ac
complishment unless there is a
widespread consciousness of the
possible directions which reform
can take. The public debate on
university government should
start now.

(Below is Provost Lyman's
reply to Mr. Hori's letter.)
Dear Mr. Hori:
I have read with considerable
interest — and varying degrees
of agreement and disagreement
— your long letter on university
government. . . .
It does seem to me that you
place far-away events in reason
able perspective, while not sur
prisingly failing to do so when it
comes to things closer to Stan
ford. For example, you stress the
need for reforms to make louder
and clearer the faculty's voice
at Stanford, yet you appear to
dismiss the creation of the Aca
demic Senate, on which respon
sible faculty leaders have been
working hard all year, as hard
ly more than a trivial rear
rangement.
You also give far less credit
than seems to me due to those
students who sit on University
committees here — both those
of the Academic Council and
thos« appointed directly by the
President. Students have had
more to do with planning devel
opments here than you appear
to realize, and this has some
times included the planning of
buildings. Student committee
members played a crucial role,
for instance, in the decision, now
frequently criticized, to build
Tresidder Union's dining facili
ties as one large room, rather
than a series of smaller rooms
designed for a variety of func
tions.
This year, for the first time,
student members are serving on
the Committee on Land and
Building Development. Student
members of such committees
as Undergraduate Education and
General Studies have done in
valuable work, and provided a
channel for student opinion to
reach into the heart of university
decision-making. (Unhappily it
must also be admitted that a
common complaint from student
committee members has been
that their fellow • students seem
ed unaware of their presence
on the committee, and uninter
ested in contributing ideas or
criticisms to help them in their
committee work.)
Concerning the Board of Trus
tees, the entire subject of Board-
University relationships in the
United States 'or specifically at
Stanford) is, of course, a legiti
mate one for debate. There is
much to be said for diversifica
tion of Board membership, and
many of us have said it from
time to time.
On the other hand there are
good reasons for questioning the

wisdom of appointing faculty
members to the Boards of their
own institutions. I incline to
wards the view that faculty
members from other institutions
are more likely to be able to con
tribute effectively to Trustee dis
cussions and decision-making, be
cause they can speak and act
without reference to intra-Uni
versity political pressures.
Concerning; your basic prem
ise — that the University is
"a community of scholars,"
I'm not sure how far that car
ries us in deciding how best to
govern the institution. That it
is to be "governed, not admin
istered," strikes me as part
truism, part false antithesis:
every government includes an
administrative element among
others, and the tough ques
tions of delineating the prop
er sphere within government
for the administrative part
cannot be answered simply by
a phrase. I don't suppose that
anyone imagines that these
same questions have found an
ideal answer at Stanford —
or any other place.
Finally, if you can interest a
substantial number of students
in the problems of "the gover
nance of the University," and sus
tain that interest to the point of
producing a continuing and con
structive contribution towards
