# 'Loyal Californians' Rape Band Shack
## 
### 
The Stanford Band Shack was
broken into early Saturday
morning between 4 and 6:45, ac
cording to Sergeant Ken Law
rence of the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's office.
Two University of California
signs, four Stanford Band tro
phies and several photographs
were taken.
Left on the scene was a type
written letter addressed to the
band manager which said:
"We are terribly sorry to in
convenience you by removing
your valued possessions. Cer
tain circumstances, however,
have dictated our activities.
"It seems that this fall mem
bers of the Incomparable (?)
Stanford Band illegally removed
a trophy known as the Sprague
Award from the California
Band office.
"What a cruel and merciless
act! Just think of the poor de
serving Cal bandsman who has
suffered through these terrible
times unrecognized for his
achievements.
"On another occasion sev
eral inebriated Stanford
Bandsmen unthinkingly and
again illegally removed three
California Band jackets from
a parked car. This awful act
has forced three hard-working
students to freeze through
these long winter months.
Shame! Shame!

"We know that these acts
weren't committed intentionally,
we realize that you were driven
to commit these crimes by our
cruel and hard society. There
fore, we would like to succeed
where society failed.
"You can repent from your
sins by returning these 4 stolen
pieces of property to the Cal
band. When we are informed of
your reformation we will gladly
return your valuable posses
sions.
"Thank you and we'll keep in
touch."
The note was signed "Loyal
and Concerned Californians."
The Sheriff's officio has an
yet conducted no investigation
on campus because they have
been instructed to stay away
from Stanford during the sit
in, according to Sergeant
Lawrence.
