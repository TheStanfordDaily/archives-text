# NROTC Annex Burns Again, Investigators Report No Clues
## 
### PAUL DELIBAN 
investigators or the nre tnat
burned the Naval ROTC annex
to the ground early yesterday
morning have so far turned up
no significant clues as to its
cause.
This appraisal was given by
Assistant Chief Frank A. Jurian
of the Stanford Fire Depart
ment.
All signs, however, pointed to
arson. Jurian said the fire was
"definitely assisted" since it cov
ered too wide an area for a
natural fire.
The fire's intensity also indi
cated the use of an unknown
accelerant, he added, and what
ever started it may have been
completely consumed in the
flames.
Deputy fire marshall for Santa
Clara County Daniel M. Cha
braya, also observed "the cir
cumstances (of the fire) are
suspicious."

Associate Dean of Students
Willard Wyman said he was con
vinced there was no connection
between the fire and demonstra
tions at the Old Union.
Stanford policemen Donald
Lillie and Caroll Wood each
spotted the blaze and it was re
ported at 2:47 a.m. Three Stan
ford fire trucks responded im
mediately but the building was
fully involved in flames when
they arrived, and firemen could
do little more than water down
the surrounding area to prevent
further spreading of the fire. An
hour after the blaze, only a
chimney and two charred walls
remained.
Marine Colonel Robert L.
Thomas, head of the Naval Sci
ence department, termed the ar
son a "foolish and shameful act
with absolutely no reason for
that course of action." He set the
replacement value of the build
ing at $60,000-$70,000.

Two other "harassment fires,"
as Jurian termed them, were re
ported on campus. A shed be
hind the Stanford Elementary
School was an arson attempt,
possibly a diversion, he specu
lated. A flaming mattress at the
intersection of Campus Drive
and Salvatierra Street provided
the second fire. Neither did
much damage and were quickly
extinguished.
An orange glow lighted the
sky over the NROTC Annex fire
but attracted no more than a
dozen spectators at one time.
This was the second fire to
plague the NROTC Annex this
year. The first, on February 19.
badly damaged the structure
and it was being remodeled
when yesterday's blaze erupted.
Damage in the earlier fire was
estimated at $6,000, but replace
ment cost would have been
$25,000, according to Stanford
Fire Chief John Marston.
