# 15 Students Receive Approval For Interdepartmental Study
## 
### DAN SNELL 
Fifteen undergraduates have
been approved as interdepart
mental majors, Lawrence Ryan,
associate humanities and sci
ences dean announced last week.
The authorization for approv
ing up to 20 interdepartmental
majors was made by the Aca
demic Council January 5.
Twenty - four undergraduates
applied for the option, but Ryan
said many of those who were
turned down were able to work
out suitable programs within
existing departments.
The program was Initiated,
according to a memorandum
by Robert Sears, humanities
and sciences dean, because
"certain undergraduates are
developing intellectual Inter
ests that can only be satisfied
by programs that cut across
the usual departmental lines)
and form coherent patterns
other than those marked out
by the traditional disciplines."
Interdepartmental majors in
clude Robert Abshear, American
Studies; Constance Osbury, Lin
guistic Studies; John Avery, The
ory and Development of Marx
ism; William Black, Nineteenth-

Century Studies; Ronald Brown,
Biochemical Engineering; Mar
tha Campbell, Nineteenth-Cen
tury Studies; and Diana Jo Co
hen, Japanese Studies.
Others are Warren Cornell,
Physics - Philosophy - Psycho
logy; Marilyn Hezmall, Linguis
tic Studies; Linda Ho, Philo
sophy and Intellectual History;
Jeffrey Kane, Psysiological Psy
chology; Ying Lew, Computer
Methods and Design; Ernest
Phinney, Hispanic Studies; and
Marjorie Young, Nineteenth-Cen
tury Literature.
Douglas Otto's proposed pro
gram in communication and so
cial science has also been pro
visionally approved, but Ryan
says some adjustments in the
plan will be necessary before it
is fully acceptable to the screen
ing committee.
Marilyn Hexmall and Ling
Lew were pioneers in the pro
gram. Last fall they presented
petitions for interdisciplinary
majors that spurred attempts
by the humanities and sciences
deans to get Academic Council
approval for the principle of ap
proving a limited number of in
terdepartmental majors.

The students whose programs
were approved consulted with at
least three professors who sub
sequently signed their petitions.
The faculty members will
serve as an advisory board to
the student, but one faculty
member will be designated as
the principal adviser.
Ryan said applications
would continue to be accept
ed whenever students wish
submit them, but there are
just five spaces still available
because of the Academic
Council limitation to 20 stu
dents.
Only students who are in good
academic standing will have
their petitions considered under
this program. Those approved
must still complete General Stu
dies and resident requirements
in order to obtain their degrees.
