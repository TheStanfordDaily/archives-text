# Farm Catches Spring Fever

"I don't know about my stu
dents, but I find myself wanting
to cut more classes," said one
Stanford prof, clearly wishing
to remain anonymous after be
ing questioned on his feelings
about spring quarter.
Professor Leonard Horowitz
of psychology stated that he
noticed a definite change in Stan
ford students: they stop bundl
ing up and now come to class
barefoot and in cut-offs.
Spring quarter is the time for
moving from the library to the
lawn to study. The studying of
ten gives way to an afternoon
nap. Things appear much more
relaxed.
But is spring quarter a time
for decreased work loads or aca
demic output?
According to Harvey Hall,
registrar, there is no significant
change in the amount of units
carried by the average student.
The average number of units
taken autumn quarter by under
graduates was 15.35. The num
ber rose winter quarter to 15.83
and dropped this spring to 15.29.
Hall explained that freshmen,
no longer restricted to 16 units,
accounted for the slight winter
rise. Graduating seniors, allow
ed to carry a diminished load at
half tuition, also helped lower
the average.
Students express a desire to
limit their workload, but often
find it impossible. One coed
felt trapped by series courses.
This is the last quarter for
many of the series, and stu
dents find it impractical to
drop them.
Some feel that they are work
ing harder in order to maintain
their former averages. Tension
is generated by the fact that
this is the last quarter of the
year. This tension is reflected
in the kinds of problems that
students take to the Counseling
and Testing Service.

According to Guy Browning
of the Counseling Service,
"Spring fever brings insistent
demands that decisions be made,
especially on the part of sopho
mores who have not yet decided
upon their major."
Spring also brings the feeling
of an end to work. Decisions
concerning the future become
more real for juniors and grad
uating seniors.
This quarter, the Counseling
and Testing Service reports, the
number of students coming in in
creases. Freshmen show a sharp
rise from autumn to spring. In a
survey of 100 students, there
were four freshmen who came
in autumn quarter compared to
35 in winter quarter. The num
ber is expected to increase this
quarter.
Despite continued heavy
workloads, students are find
ing more time for sunbathing.
There are always people boat
ing on Lake Lag. Students
rely on working harder in the
evening. One would expect
grades to suffer.
But through the distractions
of spring, students manage to
maintain their grade averages.
In fact, averages increase. Last
year the overall average for un
dergraduates during autumn and
winter quarters was 2.84. The
overall GPA rose to 2.95 during
spring quarter of last year.
Do Stanford students ignore
the warmer and longer days of
spring quarter? A walk around
campus will show that at least
some have yielded. Springtime
may be a time, as some contend,
for increased cramming.
Meyer Library is much more
crowded during the evenings
this quarter. As one student put
it,"I find that it is much harder
to find a place to sleep in the li
brary this quarter than last."
But whatever happens, spring
quarter students don't allow
their work or grades to suffer.
