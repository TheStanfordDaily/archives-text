# How UC Fees Were Hiked
## 
### News Analysis By ALLAN MANN 
LOS ANGELES (CPS) — The
recent passage of an $81 per year
increase in student fees by the
University of California's Board
of Regents has culminated a
15-month battle by California's
Governor Ronald Reagan to im
pose a larger share of the bur
den for financing higher educa
tion on the students.
But still unresolved is how
much of that burden the state it
self is willing to shoulder. It will
not be until mid-summer before
the second in a series of battles
between the state and the uni
versity over UC's budget will
have been concluded.
The Board of Regents has
requested $311 million from
the state for next year's op
erating budget. Reagan has
offered $280 million. Both pro
posals are awaiting debate on
the floor of California's legi
slature, now considering the
state's $5.7 billion 1968-69 bud
get of which the UC budget is
a part.
The situation is reminscent of
the controversy which engulfed
the state last year when the Re
gents requested $278 million
and the governor offered $196
million — plus $22 million to
accrue from a $250 per student
per year tuition and a $20 mil
lion in special regental funds.
In February of last year, the
Regents revised their request to
$264 million, and committed the

$20 million of their own funds
but stated emphatically that no
tuition would be enacted before
fall, 1967.
Realizing that he could no
longer force the passage of a
tuition plan, Reagan eventu
ally added $22 million to his
offer to make up for lost tui
tion funds.
In its final form, Reagan's
proposal was for $254. The com
promise Assembly-Senate figure
emerging from budget debate
last July was $256 million.
In the course of legislation
on the budget, the legislators had
restored many of the cuts made
by the governor, but they made
certain cuts of their own.
As if motivated by the prin
ciple of the thing, Reagan blue
penciled the restorations of his
cuts. He was, however, power
less to restore legislative cuts.
As a result, the budget was
finalized at $250 million — a
cut of $28 million from the
Regents original request and
$-1 million below Reagan's
highest offer.
During the course of this year,
the University has "managed
to get along" with the abbrevi
ated state allocation, according
to the University's president,
Charles J. Hitch.
But throughout the debate on
the budget Hitch made it clear
that if funds were not restored
in 1968-69, the university would
suffer irreparable damage.
To this, Reagan assured the
Board of Regents and Hitch that

the cuts would be "for one year
only," and did not constitute a
"new, lower base" for University
funding.
Displaying a naive confidence
in the governor's promise, the
Regents submitted a $311 million
request for 1968-69, only to be
shocked into reality by the gov
ernor's statement in January of
this year that the state could
not afford more than $280 mil
lion.
Cries of "fraud" filled the
room as the Regents met in Feb
ruary, shortly after the an
nouncement, and the governor
was roundly criticized. Reagan,
there at the meeting to defend
himself, read a carefully worded
statement (written by his finance
director, Gordon Smith) which
proved statistically that the uni
versity was getting a "dispropor
tionate" increase of 11 per cent
in its allocation despite an 8.3
per cent projected student en
rollment increase, that the Uni
versity was getting a larger in
crease in allotment than any
other state department and that,
in fact, complaints of "irrepar
able damage" from University
officials were nothing more than
"poormouthing."
Reagan turned a deaf ear to|
University rebuttal that the
"disproportionate increase"
was based on increases over
1967-68 which represented a
very small increase over 1966-
67, that the University re
ceived larger cuts in 1967-68
than most of the other state

departments and that, in fact,
complaints of "Irreparable
damage" were not only true
but could be documented.
At that meeting, the Regents
weakly reaffirmed their intention
to work for the passage of the
$311 million request, but, as if
admitting eventual defeat, charg
ed Hitch with the responsibility
of determining a plan for re
ducing enrollment in the fall
within the limitations of a $280
million budget.
In the meantime, behind the
scenes negotiations had appear
ed to have produced a compro
mise $290 million state - alloca
tion. But the feasibility of the
compromise was short-lived.
A few days later it was dis
covered that a public school
program authorized by the state
legislature would run $70 million
short this year and $82 million
next year.
Since the public schools have
by law first choice on mon
ey, the state will have to cut
$82 million from its 1968-69 bud
get if the school officials can't
be talked into agreeing to a cut
in their program.
To complicate matters even
more, the only departments
which do not have tax income
specifically earmarked f«r
them and therefore the only
sources of the $82 million In
cuts are the University of
California, the California state
college system, mental health,
and public hygiene.
According to newly appointed
State Finance Director Caspar
Weinberger, the $82 million in
cuts will have to be taken from
those departments, which effec
tively eliminates the possibility
of the $290 million compromise
and might even result in an al
location below Reagan's $280
million figure.
In a recent interview, Wein
berger explained that the whole
fiscal crisis revolves around the
state's refusal to work on a sys
tem of deficit spending. Thus,
the state will not spend any more
money than it has in its tills at
any one time.
Weinberger repeated charges
often leveled by Reagan that un
der the administration of former
Governor Edmund G. "Pat"
Brown the books were juggled
so that money was always avail
able even if only due and not
actually received. As a result, he
said, the state was about $45 mil
lion in the red when Reagan took
over.

Budget contingencies now, he
said, effort of the Rea
gan administration to g£t the
state in the black and keep it
there.
Against the backdrop to all
tills budget difficulty, Reagan
has maintained his fight for
Increased student charges.
After acquiescing to the Re
gents' February 1967 decision
not to impose tuition before fall
1968, Reagan renewed his cam
paign, drafting the Equal Educa
tion Plan (EEPI proposal last
summer which was a means of
financing the education of mi
nority group students with tui
tion providing the needed addi
tional funds.
Iu August, the Regents called
a special meeting and defeated
Reagan's plan and rejected the
whole concept of tuition. As an
alternative, they created a spe
cial committee to consider in
creases in student fees, which
are collected for non-educational
functions of the University. "The
Regents* felt that money from
increased fees could be used
to bolster a faltering counseling
program as well as increase
financial aids.
After five months of bickering,
a plan for $156 per student per
year increase was promulgated.
After an additional three months
of debate the plan was enacted,
but the increase was reduced to
$81.
The governor expressed ob
, vious disappointment at the
small size of the increase, but
grudgingly supported It, not
ing that this was "at least a
step in the direction of stu
dents assuming a larger part
of the financial burden for
supporting higher education."
While saddling the students
with greater financial respon
sibility, Reagan continues to
protect the state — or more cor
rectly, his constituent taxpayers
— from the same. He was, after
all, elected on an anti-University
platform and he thus firmly be
lieves that he is carrying out the
will of the people.
