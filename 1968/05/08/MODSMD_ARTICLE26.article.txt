# Educator Blames Professors For Unchanging Universities

### WALTER GRANT College Press Service 
WASHINGTON (CPS) — U.S.
Commissioner of Education
Harold Howe II says he can sym
pathize with today's disenchant
ed college students because pro
fessors "are boldly reshaping
the world outside the campus
gates while neglecting to make
corresponding changes to the
world within."
Howe says students "cannot
understand why university pro
fessors who are responsible for
the reach into space, for split
ting the atom, and for the inter
pretation of man's journey on
earth seem unable to find the
way to make the university per
tinent to their lives." College stu
dents "of the pre World II era
would be quite at home with the
ways of teaching" on campuses
today, he says.
Howe's remarks were made
last weekend before more than
COO professors attending the an
nual meeting of the American
Association of University Pro
fessors here. If there is to be
meaningful change in higher
education, Howe said, "the pro
fessors who really run the place
. . . are going to have to be the
ones to bring it about."
He said professors should ex
amine their institutions to deter
mine if the present grading sys
tem is adequate, whether or not

the curriculum is relevant to
life in tomorrow's world, if ad
missions policies are discriminat
ing against disadvantaged and
minority group students, and
whether the institutional reward
system is promoting scientific
research while devaluing under
graduate instruction.
He said universities should
provide exceptions in admis
sion standards and special help
for Negroes, Mexican-Ameri
cans, American Indians, and
Puerto Ricans whose college
potential has been scarred by
poverty and discrimination.
Professors attending the meet
ing also heard AAUP's annual
report on the economic status of
professors. The report showed
an overall percentage increase
of 7.4 per cent in compensations
of faculty members at all levels,
but said that because of the rapid
rise in the price level this year's
rate of increase is substantially
lower than that of the previous
year.
The report also showed that
the nation's private colleges and
universities continue to lag be
hind public institutions in the
improvement of faculty salaries.
It said an "air of crisis hangs
over private institutions," a crisis
which is likely to grow more se
rious with time.
The AAUP survey, however,
showed that state Institutions

are least competitive in their re
numeration of tenured faculty
— full and associate professors.
In order to help alleviate
the financial crisis and save
the dual system of higher ed
ucation, the report said fac
ulty members will have to
study and put into effect mea
sures which help increase the
productivity of teaching efforts
and thereby help keep costs
down. The report also said the
federal government will have
to increase its support of col
leges In ways that do not In
volve direct control of institu
tional activities.
