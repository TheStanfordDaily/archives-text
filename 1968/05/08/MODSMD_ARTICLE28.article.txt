# Trio Hurls One-Hitter
## Stanford Stings Hornets, 5-0 
### PETER DUFFY 
Stanford righthanders Sandy
Vance, Bob Sharpe, and Rod Po
teete limited Sacramento State
to one scratch hit yesterday, as
the Tribe whitewashed the Hor
nets 5-0.
Sacramento State first-base
man Dennis Deßoss was credit
ed with an infield single in the
fifth inning off Sharpe. Deßoss
chopped a slow grounder past
Sharpe that second - baseman
Russ Tweet charged but threw
wildly to first on what could
have been a close play.
The official scorer ruled it was
a hit and an error, as Deßoss
moved to second on the way
ward throw. That cheap safety
was all the Hornets could boast
in their hitting column after
nine innings of play.
Vance started for the Tribe

and pitched three perfect In
nings, fanning three In the
process. Sharpe followed, strik
ing out two and walking one,
but allowed Delloss's single
In the fifth.
Poteete finished up and struck
out six over the final three
frames, while walking only one.
The Tribe jumped off to a
quick 3-0 lead in the second in
ning. Following three consecu
tive bases on balls to Ron Shotts,
Jack Hodges, and Russ Tweet,
Chuck Williams slapped a
grounder to third that was boot
ed, allowing Shotts to score.
Two outs later Mark Marquess
singled home Hodges and Tweet
to cap the rally.
Stanford added a single taN
ly In the fifth when Mike Scho
maker walked, stole second,
went to third on an error,

and scored on Bob Gallagher's
double.
Bob Boone scored the final
run in the ninth on Shotts' sac
rifice fiy. Boone had reached
first on a single, gone to sec
ond on an error and moved to
third on an infield out.
Stanford managed only four
safeties, with Tweet collecting
the other base rap.
This game had no league sig
nificance, but it is comforting to
Coach Ray Young to have three
pitchers go a nine inning ball
game while allowing only one
scratch single.
Stanford's Pac-8 record re
mains at 7-2 as they prepare
for the vital southern trip this
weekend. Friday the Tribe
will play a crucial single con
test with the USC Trojans who
currently reside in first place
with a 9-1 record. Harvey
Shank is expected to hurl for
Stanford.
Saturday the Tribe moves to
UCLA for a doubleheader
against the tough Bruins. Rod Po
-teete figures to start the first
game while the second game
chores will be left with either
Vance, Don Rose or Phil Keller.
The pressure is on the Indians
right now as they have 11 Pac-8
games remaining with 10 of
those games to be played away
from home.
