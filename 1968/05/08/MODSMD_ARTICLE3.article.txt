# C15: Judicial Overhaul
## 
### 
The Committee of Fifteen (CIS)
early this morning issued its rec
ommendations for a new legisla
tive and judicial structure to make
and to enforce policies on student
conduct.
The statement (reprinted on page
two) makes no recommendations
on the case of the anti-CIA demon
strators, but presents methods of
selection for members of a student
faculty appeals board and a
conduct-legislating board.
Protestors against action of the
present judicial system slept and
talked in the Old Union through
the night.

In an open meeting with 400
present at 7:30 p.m. demonstra
tors agreed to send Anne John
son and Nan Goldie, two of their
number, to a meeting with Pro
vost Richard Lyman and Assoc.
Provost Herbert Packer at 9
a.m. today.
The meeting, proposed by
Daily Assoc. Editor Philip Taub
man, is for "an exchange of
views," anu the students will not
go as representatives but as in
dividuals.
David Packard, Stanford
trustee and president of Hew
lett - Packard Corporation of
Palo Alto, addressed the dem
ons !rators at the evening meet
ing, "If you get into these con
frontations, you may lose
everything you've gained....
Keep working with us, and
you'll find a good solution to
this."
Packard said, "We're willing
in principle to allow you to have
a larger voice, but not at this
point to decide everything."
Calling for a "partnership" ap
proach, he said, "We don't want
the type of thing we had at
Columbia. I came here to gain a
better understanding in case the
Trustees have to decide anything
in this matter — and I hope we
don't."
Packard was received by
most of the students.
History Prof. Gavin Lang
muir, Physics Prof. Walter Mey
erhof, English Prof. Lucio Ruo
tolo, and Economics Prof. Lorie
Tarshis, speaking last night to
the demonstrators, said it would
strengthen their protestors' po
sition if they left the Old Union
at that time. Other faculty mem
bers, including English Prof. H.
Bruce Eranklin, expressed oppos
ing views.
Asked what would happen if
the administration ignored an
Academic Council recommen
dation today, Tarshis said,
"There would be a crisis that
would make your thing here
look mild."
Although some students op
posed to the sit-in and the de
mands were present, last night's
meeting was orderly.

It appeared many of the dem
onstrators were going to spend
the night in the building and to
occupy it through the morning
and afternoon today.
Student protestors spent much
of their time yesterday in small
informal seminars on topics per
taining to the University and
society.
The protestors also invited fac
ulty members to an "open house"
in the Old Union this afternoon
from 2 to 4 p.m. to discuss the
campus situation. The Academic
Council (open to faculty of as
sistant professor rank and
above) meets today at 4:15 p.m.
in Dinkelspiel in special session

to consider the recent contro
versy.
At a mid-afternoon press con
ference yesterday ASSU Presi
dent Cesare Massarenti said,
"The Old Union is an open build
ing. We want concerned faculty
members to go to Lyman and
ask him why the Union offices
aren't open."
Staff who work In the build
ing had been given a "holi
day" yesterday by the admini
stration. Administration sour
ces said the building staff
would be asked to return to
work today.
At a noon rally in the Old
Union court attended by 800

persons Massarenti had said,
"We are not here to destroy
Stanford. We are here so we can
make Stanford a better place for
us to live and work in. . . . This
is an educational process."
Steve Weissman, a veteran of
Berkeley free speech controver
sies and now a grad student
here, said ho believed demonstra
tors did not want credit for any
victory for themselves, but the
credit could go to the faculty
if the demands were met, as far
as protestors were concerned.
"But I think we should demand
that there not be another series
of prosecutions because of this
demonstration," he said. "We
