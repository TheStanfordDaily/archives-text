# Many Oppose Sit-In

### MICHAEL KUHL 
A number of students circu
lated petitions last night pro
testing the continued sit-in in
the Old Union.
Eckhard Schulz, a graduate
student in engineering from
Weisbaden, Germany, has called
for a noon meeting today in
Bishop Auditorium of the Grad
uate School of Business "to try
to unite those groups who op
pose the tactic of the sit-in."
Opposition to the sit-in be
gan Monday night when over
1,500 students gathered in the
courtyard of the Old Union in
Stanford's first general stu
dent meeting and voted by a
margin of 00 per cent to evac
uate the building.
In "disapproval of militancy,"
Chris Beattie, a junior in Alpha
Sigma Phi, organized students
to call the fraternities and other
living groups to be present for
th "> 7:30 meeting called by ASSU
President Cesare Massaranti.
Many of the demonstrators in
the Old Union interpreted the
mobilization of fraternities as
a prelude to clashes between
two factions of student opinion.
Beattie insists that he knows of

no fraternity plans to physically
remove the protestors from the
building.
Beattie added that his speech
at the rally Monday night "made
it clear that many, many of us
are for reform" of the judicial
system.
At the same time that Beat
tie was urging students to atr
tend the rally, another group
of five students led by Tran
cos freshman Steve Duncan
circulated a petition in "sup
port for President Sterling
and the administration."
The 750 students who signed
the petition in 2 hours Monday
night added that they intend to
"follow President Sterling in the
manner he uses to keep his posi
tion from being dominated by a
show of force instead of student
administration compromise."
Following Dave Pugh's an
nouncement at the Monday
night meeting in Memorial Aud
itorium that only 20 or 30 pro
testors remained in the Old Un
ion, Duncan presented the peti
tions to Provost Lyman and ex
plained the group's position.
"We were concerned that the
only voice that the people were

hearing was that of the students
over at the Old Union," Duncan
explained yesterday. Over 50
students representing every liv
ing unit attended a meeting yes
terday where Duncan announced
plans to continue to circulate
the petition.
By 9:30 last night over 2,000
new signatures had been
added to the petition, accord
ing to Duncan.
Soleng Tom and Tom Shana
han began circulating a petition
yesterday requesting that two
initiative questions be placed on
the ballot for the final election
next week.

The sponsors of the initiative
maintain that a majority of the
students have not had an oppor
tunity to express their opposi
tion on the protest tactics.
By 10:30 p.m. last night the
group had 1,463 signatures. The
petitions were presented to Mas
sarenti, who has six to fourteen
days to act on them.
The first proposed initiative
poses the question of whether
"forcible occupation of Univers
ity buildings is unacceptable be
havior at Stanford University."
The second suggests that "ad
vocating and participating in
the forcible occupation" of the
Old Union is "unacceptable" to
students. The proposal adds that
"Cesare Massarenti, as Presi

dent of the Associated Students,
is hereby censured for behavior
inappropriate to his office."
A letter Ln today's DAILY
takes note of support by Tom
and Jere Horowitz, senior
class president and vice-presi
dent, Richard Ware, ASSU Fi
nancial Manager, and Mike
Quinn, IFC president.
Shanahan added last night, "I
would like the Stanford com
munity to say emphatically that
those tactics don't belong at
Stanford."
Eckhard Schulz, who is presi
dent of the engineering honors
society, declared at yesterday's
noon rally, "I don't want Stan
ford to become another Colum
bia."
