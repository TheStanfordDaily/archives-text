## Britain Faces Race Crisis 
### ROBIN KNIGHT (Second of two parts) 
Two factors combined to push
the racial issue in Britain to the
forefront of public attention.
After 14 months preparation the
Labour government published
a bill which would considerably
widen the scope of the 1965
Race Relations Act.
Little time was permitted for
public discussion of the bill, but
during the fourteen-day interval
between the bill's publication and
its debate in the House of Com
mons, an explosive and pertinent
speech by a member of the Con
servative opposition "shadow"
cabinet, Enoch Powell, ensured
that the Labour government
was made aware of divided pub
lic opinion.
Just how divided British pub
lic opinion is on the subject of
racial discrimination is shown

in a Gallup poll conducted in
mid-April. While in principle
more respondents approved than
disapproved of the bill, critics
of the detaiLs outnumbered sup
porters.
The main conclusions to be
drawn from the poll are that
coloured immigrants have their
rights, should have the vote and
be allowed to compete on equal
terms for jobs.
But white people were also felt
to have the right to pursue their
self-interest and, if they chose,
to discriminate on racial grounds
when selecting applicants for
jobs or purchasers for their
homes. A large majority, thre >
in every four, believed that con
trols at present in force to limit
coloured immigration wore insuf
ficient and should b" tightened
Against this background of
growing fear of race riots in

Britain and increasing worry
about job competition at a time
of high unemployment, both ma
jor political parties have found
themselves divided and embar
rassed by their supporters.
The Labour party, in the early
19605, opposed legislation to con
trol coloured immigration, but
public feeling on this matter
forced the party leadership to
reverse its position by the 19G4
general election. Party M.P.s re
main split, the extreme left
wing, especially, vociferously op
posing any control.
From the outset of the entry
of race relations into the politi
cal process the Conservative
party has been "split down the
middle" as one Party M.P. said
recently. Those on the right
wing, who oppose sanctions on
Rhodesia, support the reintro
duction of capital punishment
and various other "tradition"
measures, also back strict con
trol of immigration to Britain.
A group of such M.P.s, mem
bers of the Monday Club in the
Commons, thus attacked the
Race Relations Bill on the
grounds that "It seeks to limit
by legislation the citizens sphere
of personal decision and, by do
ing so, far from promoting racial

harmony, it will create justified
resentment among the "natives"
against newly-privileged new
comers."
Outside Parliament public re
action to Mr. Powell's speech in
dicated much sympathy for his
position. In this speech Mr.
Powell stated that Britain must
be "mad, literally mad" as a na
tion to allow 50,000 dependents
of immigrants into the country
each year.
After this speech, which also
advocated the policy of encour
aging re-emigration, Powell was
sacked from the shadow cabinet
by Mr. Heath, leader of the op
position, on the grounds that
the speech was "racialist in tone,
and liable to exacerbate racial
tensions."
Public sympathy for Mr.
Powell's views lias been express
ed in various ways. More than
700 members of a working-mans
club in Wolverhampton, Powell's
constituency, voted the next day
unanimously to continue a total
colour bar on membership.
In London meat porters and
dockers staged demonstrations
outside Parliament in support of
Powell. One petition stated that
"While we are in no way racial
ists we arc exceedingly anxious
to keep this country our own."
One national newspaper report
ed that 97 per cent of the letters
it had received on the race rela
tions issue supported Powell.
Debating the Bill in the Com
mons, the split in the Conser
vative party deepened. Twenty
four Conservatives deliberately
abstained from the ammend
ment put forward by Heath
which criticized the bill on the
grounds that the proposed legi
slation extending the powers of
the 1965 Act to include housing
and employment was confused
and unworkable. The bill passed
on the second reading, and will
become law after it has been

through the Committee stage
which examines the clauses in
detail.
Throughout the present con
troversy mention has constantly
been made of the relevance or
irrelevance of American experi
ences in this matter. Supporters
of legislation have consistently
claimed that unless Parliament
acted it is only a matter of time
before riots and arson erupt in
England. Those with experience
of American conditions tend to
disagree.
In the first place the scale of
the British problem is at pres
ent immeasurably smaller. In
the United States one man in ten
is Negro; in Britain one man in

fifty is coloured. Many American
cities are predominantly black:
in Washington three out of five
citizens are Negroes. In England
the largest percentage of non
whites in any city is probably
in Wolverhampton, Powell's con
stituency, but even there whites
outnumber the rest by 12 to
one.
Then again American society
is considerably more prone to
violence. It is inconceivable that
any statements such as those
made by Mayor Daley of Chi
cago would be countenaced by
British opinion.
Far from representing a co
ercive force to be opposed, police
in England are regarded by col
oured immigrants as guardians
and protectors. Even a short ex
posure to both cultures reveals
a fundamental difference in at
titudes toward law, order and
the use of force.
No policeman in Britain has
the right to shoot to kill. Con
sequently although demonstra
tions may become violent, they
do not lead to feelings of resent
ment against the police, and to
subsequent retaliation.
In this country, too, Negroes
have acquired a public voice and
public leaders. It is possible that
they can act as a unit. In Brit
ain colour opinion is largely si
lent due to the immigrant na
ture of coloured people who,
whether or not they are treated
as equals, are certainly made
aware of their alien status.
The idea of a coloured En
glishman is still unacceptable to
native English and though an
immigrant may go to England
to find work, he rarely goes to
exchange his nationality.
Finally, the American exper
ience does not encourage one to
believe that by passing laws one
solves the racial problem. No
nation in history can have
passed so many State and Fed

eral laws forbidding segregation
as has the United States.
But they have not stopped the
violence. Instead they have
created a huge gap between leg
islative promise and everyday
experience, and the harsh reality
of the Negroes' life is in cruel
contrast to the lawmakers' plati
tudes.
What the American exper
ience does teach is that the
racial question will only be
solved by creating the economic
and social conditions in which
all people learn to live together.
In American society it may be
too late to do this: the legacy of
the past 150 years may continue
long after the ending of unjust
conditions.
In Britain, with its smaller
and more recent problem, by
providing housing and education
and opportunities for all com
mensurate with skills, it may
still be possible to avert a blood
bath.
