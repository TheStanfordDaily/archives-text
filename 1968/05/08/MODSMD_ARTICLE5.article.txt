## Britain Faces Race Crisis 
### ROBIN KNIGHT (Second of two parts) 
Two factors combined to push
the racial issue in Britain to the
forefront of public attention.
After 14 months preparation the
Labour government published
a bill which would considerably
widen the scope of the 1965
Race Relations Act.
Little time was permitted for
public discussion of the bill, but
during the fourteen-day interval
between the bill's publication and
its debate in the House of Com
mons, an explosive and pertinent
speech by a member of the Con
servative opposition "shadow"
cabinet, Enoch Powell, ensured
that the Labour government
was made aware of divided pub
lic opinion.
Just how divided British pub
lic opinion is on the subject of
racial discrimination is shown

in a Gallup poll conducted in
mid-April. While in principle
more respondents approved than
disapproved of the bill, critics
of the detaiLs outnumbered sup
porters.
The main conclusions to be
drawn from the poll are that
coloured immigrants have their
rights, should have the vote and
be allowed to compete on equal
terms for jobs.
But white people were also felt
to have the right to pursue their
self-interest and, if they chose,
to discriminate on racial grounds
when selecting applicants for
jobs or purchasers for their
homes. A large majority, thre >
in every four, believed that con
trols at present in force to limit
coloured immigration wore insuf
ficient and should b" tightened
Against this background of
growing fear of race riots in

Britain and increasing worry
about job competition at a time
of high unemployment, both ma
jor political parties have found
themselves divided and embar
rassed by their supporters.
The Labour party, in the early
19605, opposed legislation to con
trol coloured immigration, but
public feeling on this matter
forced the party leadership to
reverse its position by the 19G4
general election. Party M.P.s re
main split, the extreme left
wing, especially, vociferously op
posing any control.
From the outset of the entry
of race relations into the politi
cal process the Conservative
party has been "split down the
middle" as one Party M.P. said
recently. Those on the right
wing, who oppose sanctions on
Rhodesia, support the reintro
duction of capital punishment
and various other "tradition"
measures, also back strict con
trol of immigration to Britain.
A group of such M.P.s, mem
bers of the Monday Club in the
Commons, thus attacked the
Race Relations Bill on the
grounds that "It seeks to limit
by legislation the citizens sphere
of personal decision and, by do
ing so, far from promoting racial

harmony, it will create justified
resentment among the "natives"
against newly-privileged new
comers."
Outside Parliament public re
action to Mr. Powell's speech in
dicated much sympathy for his
position. In this speech Mr.
Powell stated that Britain must
be "mad, literally mad" as a na
tion to allow 50,000 dependents
of immigrants into the country
each year.
After this speech, which also
advocated the policy of encour
aging re-emigration, Powell was
sacked from the shadow cabinet
by Mr. Heath, leader of the op
position, on the grounds that
the speech was "racialist in tone,
and liable to exacerbate racial
tensions."
Public sympathy for Mr.
Powell's views lias been express
ed in various ways. More than
700 members of a working-mans
club in Wolverhampton, Powell's
constituency, voted the next day
unanimously to continue a total
colour bar on membership.
In London meat porters and
dockers staged demonstrations
outside Parliament in support of
Powell. One petition stated that
"While we are in no way racial
ists we arc exceedingly anxious
