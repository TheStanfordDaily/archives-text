The following resolution was
adopted by a vote of 12-1:
The Committee of Fifteen urges
the President to make his decision
about the case of the CIA demon
strators independently of previous
decisions with regard to that issue.
We urge that he take into account
all relevant evidence presented
both at the meeting of the IJB
and at the meetings of the Judicial
Council, and that he confer with
representatives of both the IJB
and the Judicial Council before
arriving at a decision. He will,
of course, take into account any
communications addressed to him
by the defendants.
In addition, we recommend that,
when the President arrives at a
decision, he express his decision
and the reasons for it in writing
to the Stanford community.
RESOLUTION #2
The following resolution F AILED
to pass by a vote of 6-7:
The Committee of Fifteen makes

not prove appropriate.
(The resolution above FAILED

RESOLUTION #3
The following resolution was
adopted with 12 affirmative votes

The Committee of Fifteen urges
that any new charges brought

a temporary student-faculty judi
cial structure created by the Pres
ident after consultation with the
Committee of Fifteen.
The Committee of Fifteen has
voted unanimously to recommend
to the President, the Academic
Council, and the Legislature of
the Associated Students (the
following) proposals for a new leg
islative and judicial structure in
the area of student conduct. In
its desire to make public the broad
outline of its proposals for the
information of the Stanford com
munity, it is releasing the follow
ing rough and tentative draft of
agreements and understandings
reached today after 13 hours of
continuous deliberation. The Com
mittee expects tomorrow to begin

ulations governing student con
duct at Stanford University.
V. Relation to Present University
Policy.
Until such time as the Student
Conduct Legislative Council chang
es any present University policy,

currently conflicts of law.
STANFORD JUDICIAL COUNCIL

dent disciplinary cases, and its
decisions will not be appealable

decisions will be recommendations
to the President of the University.
11. Composition.
The Stanford Judicial Council

ing:
A. A Chairman, appointed by the
President from the faculty of the
Law School. The Chairman will
vote only to break a tie.

111. Relation to University Policy.
Each member of the Stanford
Judicial Council is obligated to
enforce the regulations of the Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council
or the legislative product of the
President acting after consulta
tion with the SCLC. Until such
time as the SCLC changes present
policy, the SJC will be obligated
in the case of conflicts of law
to enforce University policy.
IV. Student Rights.
In general, student defendants
will be accorded the same speci
fic rights now provided by the
ASSU Constitution and By-Laws.
V. Judicial Aide.
A. A Judicial Aide shall be hired
by and responsible to the Stanford

under general policies established
by the SJC but be subject to the
day-to-day direction of the Chair
man. He shall be paid half by the
University and half by the Associ
ated Students.
B. The Judicial Aide shall in
vestigate and report the facts of
each case to the Stanford Judicial
Council. He shall specifically re
port those facts which are not in
controversy. In cases where the
facts are controverted, he shall
report the controversy, his view
of the facts, and he shall report
the opposing position or allow the
person holding that position to do
so.
C. He will in no case recom
mend a decision to the SJC.
D. When the Judicial Aide finds
controverted facts adverse to one
of the parties, that party may re
try that controversy before the
SJC.
VI. Defendant Cooperation.
A student defendant must co
operate with the Judicial Aide
and the Stanford Judicial Council,
provided, however, that no stu
dent will be required to incrim
inate himself. Sanctions for re
fusal to cooperate will consist

(1) of placing a hold on next
quarter registration, or (2) of re
fusal of graduation in the case of
students in their last quarter.
VII. Role of the Dean of Students.
The Dean of Students will not
be in charge of the presentation
of evidence and will not conduct
cross-examination. He may be
present at any hearing, closed or
opan, and has the right to present
in writing his opinion of the case
and its implications. If he wishes
to present his views orally, he
may request permission of the
Chairman of the SJC, who may
at his sole discretion grant the
VIIL Alternate Judicial Procedure.
Subject to the Dean of Students'
right to refuse, a student may re
quest his case by heard by the
Dean. In such cases the student
may appeal the Dean's decision to
a three-man sub-committee of the
Stanford Judicial Council. The sub
committee for this purpose is to
consist of two faculty members
and one student chosen by the
Chairman of the Council at the be
ginning of the academic year; pro
vided, however, that the student

defendant have the right to ask
that the student member be re
placed by a faculty member.

Stanford Judicial Council. The sub
committee for this purpose is to
consist of two faculty members
and one student chosen by the
Chairman of the Council at the be
ginning of the academic year; pro
vided, however, that the student

defendant have the right to ask
that the student member be re
placed by a faculty member.

students in their last quarter.
VII. Role of the Dean of Students.
The Dean of Students will not
be in charge of the presentation
of evidence and will not conduct
cross-examination. He may be
present at any hearing, closed or
opan, and has the right to present
in writing his opinion of the case
and its implications. If he wishes
to present his views orally, he
may request permission of the
Chairman of the SJC, who may
at his sole discretion grant the
VIIL Alternate Judicial Procedure.
Subject to the Dean of Students'
right to refuse, a student may re
quest his case by heard by the
Dean. In such cases the student
may appeal the Dean's decision to
a three-man sub-committee of the
Stanford Judicial Council. The sub
committee for this purpose is to
consist of two faculty members
and one student chosen by the
Chairman of the Council at the be
ginning of the academic year; pro
vided, however, that the student

defendant have the right to ask
that the student member be re
placed by a faculty member.

The following resolution was
adopted by a vote of 12-1:
The Committee of Fifteen urges
the President to make his decision
about the case of the CIA demon
strators independently of previous
decisions with regard to that issue.
We urge that he take into account
all relevant evidence presented
both at the meeting of the IJB
and at the meetings of the Judicial
Council, and that he confer with
representatives of both the IJB
and the Judicial Council before
arriving at a decision. He will,
of course, take into account any

In addition, we recommend that,
when the President arrives at a
decision, he express his decision
and the reasons for it in writing
to the Stanford community.
RESOLUTION #2
The following resolution F AILED
to pass by a vote of 6-7:
The Committee of Fifteen makes

not prove appropriate.
(The resolution above FAILED

RESOLUTION #3
The following resolution was
adopted with 12 affirmative votes
and one abstention:
The Committee of Fifteen urges

Committee of Fifteen.
The Committee of Fifteen has
voted unanimously to recommend
to the President, the Academic
Council, and the Legislature of
the Associated Students (the
following) proposals for a new leg
islative and judicial structure in
the area of student conduct. In
its desire to make public the broad
outline of its proposals for the
information of the Stanford com

agreements and understandings
reached today after 13 hours of
continuous deliberation. The Com
mittee expects tomorrow to begin
drafting a final and detailed state
ment of its recommendations.
Some of the sections below are
verbatim resolutions adopted unan
imously by the Committee; others
have been agreed upon in principle,
although not in precise wording.

officio with no vote).
111. Voting procedure: Action by
the Council requires seven affirm

President, circumstances require
an interim regulation for student
conduct, the President shall con
sult with as many members of

a permanent regulation is approved
or the interim regulation is re
pealed.
C. Nothing in this document shall
be deemed in any way whatsoever
to contravene or limit the author
ity of the Trustees, or the author
ity delegated by the Trustees to
the President, to promulgate reg
ulations governing student con
duct at Stanford University.
V. Relation to Present University
Policy.
Until such time as the Student
Conduct Legislative Council chang
es any present University policy,
that policy will remain in effect.
The Committee of Fifteen recom

ness of the SCLC be the consider
ation of areas in which there are
currently conflicts of law.

dent disciplinary cases, and its
decisions will not be appealable

decisions will be recommendations
to the President of the University.

President from the faculty of the
Law School. The Chairman will

President acting after consulta
tion with the SCLC. Until such
time as the SCLC changes present
policy, the SJC will be obligated
in the case of conflicts of law
to enforce University policy.
IV. Student Rights.
In general, student defendants
will be accorded the same speci
fic rights now provided by the
ASSU Constitution and By-Laws.
V. Judicial Aide.
A. A Judicial Aide shall be hired
by and responsible to the Stanford

ated Students.
B. The Judicial Aide shall in
vestigate and report the facts of
each case to the Stanford Judicial

facts are controverted, he shall
report the controversy, his view
of the facts, and he shall report
the opposing position or allow the
person holding that position to do
so.
C. He will in no case recom
mend a decision to the SJC.
D. When the Judicial Aide finds
controverted facts adverse to one
of the parties, that party may re
try that controversy before the
SJC.
VI. Defendant Cooperation.
A student defendant must co
operate with the Judicial Aide
and the Stanford Judicial Council,
provided, however, that no stu
dent will be required to incrim
inate himself. Sanctions for re
fusal to cooperate will consist

(1) of placing a hold on next
quarter registration, or (2) of re
fusal of graduation in the case of
students in their last quarter.
VII. Role of the Dean of Students.
The Dean of Students will not
be in charge of the presentation
of evidence and will not conduct
cross-examination. He may be
present at any hearing, closed or

in writing his opinion of the case
and its implications. If he wishes

may request permission of the
Chairman of the SJC, who may
at his sole discretion grant the
VIIL Alternate Judicial Procedure.
Subject to the Dean of Students'
right to refuse, a student may re
quest his case by heard by the
Dean. In such cases the student
may appeal the Dean's decision to
a three-man sub-committee of the
Stanford Judicial Council. The sub
committee for this purpose is to
consist of two faculty members
and one student chosen by the
Chairman of the Council at the be

Subject to the Dean of Students'
right to refuse, a student may re
quest his case by heard by the
Dean. In such cases the student
may appeal the Dean's decision to
a three-man sub-committee of the
Stanford Judicial Council. The sub
committee for this purpose is to
consist of two faculty members
and one student chosen by the
Chairman of the Council at the be
ginning of the academic year; pro
vided, however, that the student

defendant have the right to ask
that the student member be re
placed by a faculty member.

will be accorded the same speci
fic rights now provided by the
ASSU Constitution and By-Laws.
V. Judicial Aide.
A. A Judicial Aide shall be hired
by and responsible to the Stanford
Judicial Council. He shall operate
under general policies established
by the SJC but be subject to the
day-to-day direction of the Chair
man. He shall be paid half by the
University and half by the Associ
ated Students.
B. The Judicial Aide shall in
vestigate and report the facts of
each case to the Stanford Judicial
Council. He shall specifically re
port those facts which are not in
controversy. In cases where the
facts are controverted, he shall
report the controversy, his view
of the facts, and he shall report
the opposing position or allow the
person holding that position to do
so.
C. He will in no case recom
mend a decision to the SJC.
D. When the Judicial Aide finds
controverted facts adverse to one
of the parties, that party may re
try that controversy before the
SJC.
VI. Defendant Cooperation.
A student defendant must co
operate with the Judicial Aide
and the Stanford Judicial Council,
provided, however, that no stu
dent will be required to incrim
inate himself. Sanctions for re
fusal to cooperate will consist

(1) of placing a hold on next
quarter registration, or (2) of re
fusal of graduation in the case of
students in their last quarter.
VII. Role of the Dean of Students.
The Dean of Students will not
be in charge of the presentation
of evidence and will not conduct
cross-examination. He may be
present at any hearing, closed or
opan, and has the right to present
in writing his opinion of the case
and its implications. If he wishes
to present his views orally, he
may request permission of the
Chairman of the SJC, who may
at his sole discretion grant the
VIIL Alternate Judicial Procedure.
Subject to the Dean of Students'
right to refuse, a student may re
quest his case by heard by the
Dean. In such cases the student
may appeal the Dean's decision to
a three-man sub-committee of the
Stanford Judicial Council. The sub
committee for this purpose is to
consist of two faculty members
and one student chosen by the
Chairman of the Council at the be
ginning of the academic year; pro
vided, however, that the student

defendant have the right to ask
that the student member be re
placed by a faculty member.
