# Sit-in Ended As Academic Council Supports Amnesty, No Suspensions
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
Fifty-six and one-half hours
after they walked into the Old
Union with only themselves for
support, over 650 student dem
onstrators peacefully departed
last night with an unprecedented
vote of support for their de
mands by the Stanford faculty.
The Academic Council, assist
ant professors and above, met
yesterday afternoon and early
evening for three and a half
hours and recommended after
heated and emotional debate that
the proposed suspension of sev
en Central Intelligence Agency
demonstrators be set aside by
President Wallace Sterling.
The Council also asked in a
vote of 284 to 245, that no stu
dents be penalized as a result
of the current demonstrations
in the Old Union. The Council
strongly urged the demonstra
tors to leave the building.
The Council recommendations,
which passed largely with votes
from the Humanities and Sci
ences and Medical School fac
ulties, supported a comprehen
sive plan for reformed judicial
structures which the Committee
of 15 created early yesterday
morning.
Blow To Policy
Though the Council actions
were a blow to administration
policy concerning the demonstra
tion, the Council did unanimous
ly express its confidence in Ster
ling and the administration.
Two hours after the Council
action, the demonstrators left
the Old Union following their
own emotional debate about tac
tics and goals for the future.
The group plans a meeting in
White Plaza today at noon to
discuss the Committee of 15's
proposals, the one area they
seem dissatisfied.
Several students strongly
urged that the sit-in continue,
but they were overwhelmingly
voted down as many students
stressed the importance of
quickly leaving the building in
response to the "victory" and

newly gained faculty support.
Departure Urged
Bruce Franklin, faculty mem
ber and a leader of the dissid
ent students, who had contin
ually urged remaining in the
Union until demands were met,
called for immediate departure
after the Council meeting. Ear
lier in the day, the students sit
ting-in had voted to leave the
union if the faculty agreed to
their demands.
The Council meeting and sub
sequent student action ended a
day that had begun with contin
ued discussion of tactics at the
Old Union, gatherings of stu
dents and faculty at that site,
and several completely vain at
tempts by opposing students to
organize against the demonstra
tors.
At noon in Bishop auditorium
at the Business School, leaders
of the opposing students met in
an "organizational meeting,"
but it soon degenerated into a
confused and frustrating debate
over Robert's rules. TTie stu
dents walked out after an hour.
Mass Meeting
During the afternoon, the dem
onstrators held two mass meet
ings in which they urged th"
Academic Council to consider
their demands before discussing
the Cl 5 proposals, asked for am
nesty, refused to endorse a com
plicity statement, and agreed to
vacate the Old Union if the fac
ulty "came through."
Faculty members, who had
been talking in and about the
Union all day, moved into Dinkel
spiel at 4 p.m. to begin their
meeting. There were over 500
faculty members present, the
largest number to attend a Coun
cil meeting in many years.
About 6 p.m., when such meet
ings usually conclude in time
for dinner, the Council agreed
to continue the meeting until a
decision was reached.
Meeting 'Tense'
The recommendations finally
adopted grew out of a resolu
tion introduced by Medical

School Prof. Halsted Holman.
The meeting was reported as
"tense" as differing factions at
tempted to amend the initial
resolution. Tension reached a
climax when the first vote was
taken on the proposals.
A voice vote proved too close
to judge and a standing vote
was nullified when one faculty
member said there were people
voting illegally. Four people ad
mitted they had done so, being
instructors or visiting profes
sors. This led to a roll call. Even
here, the teller's results, which
showed the proposal pass by one
were questioned and the final
count showed a majority of 40
for passage.
Text of resolutions a* adopt
ed by Stanford Academic Coun
cil May 8, 1968, (Introduced by
Medical School Prof. Halstead
Holman, with amendments In
corporated).
Whereas the current contro
versy over the Interim Judicial
Board and its recommended sus
pension of seven students who
participated in the CIA demon
strations involves complex juris
dictional issues that may have
beclouded a fair judgment of
the students' cases on their
merits both by the student Judi
cial Council and by the Interim
Judicial Board;
Whereas it is the desire and
the responsibility of the faculty
to develop, together with the
students and the administration,
relationships which foster the
most effective functioning of the
academic community;
Whereas the faculty has not
moved with maximum effective

ness in meeting with students
and administration to devise ap
propriate new policies;
Whereas the faculty recog
nizes the obligation of students
to determine, together with the
faculty and the administration,
appropriate new means of gov
erning the University.
Therefore be it resolved that:
1. Any new charges brought
against students before a Com
mittee of Fifteen judicial pro
posal has been finally accepted
by all constituencies by adjudi
cated by a temporary student
faculty judicial structure created
by the president (of the univer
sity) after consultation with the
Committee of Fifteen.
2. Upon its establishment, the
temporary student-faculty body
will replace the Interim Judicial
Board, and will itself be replac
ed by whatever permanent ju
dicial institutions are establish
ed.
3. The recommended suspen
sions of the seven students be
set aside. However, the admini
stration may appeal the student
judicial ruling to the new judi
cial board.
4. It is the sense of the Aca
demic Council that no students
should be penalized as a conse
quence of the current demonstra
tions and sit-ins to date.
5. Within the University, its
constituent schools and depart
ments, discussions begin imme
diately concerning new patterns
tof relationships between stu
dents, administration and fac
ulty.
