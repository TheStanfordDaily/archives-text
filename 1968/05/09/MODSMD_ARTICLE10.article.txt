# Performance Of 'MacBird' Coming Here
## 
### 
"Macßird," a political satire
based on Shakespeare's "Mac-
Beth," will be performed in
Cubberley Auditorium at 8 p.m.,
Sunday, May 12, by the Actors
Quarter Theatre.
Tickets are available at the
Tresidder Box Office and at the
door for $2.00.
" 'Macßird' has come true
scene by scene over the last few
years," said Barbara Garson,
San Francisco author of the
play. "I don't feel any special
sense of prophecy. I'm just as
surprised as anyone else that
it has all come true."
Contrary to popular belief,
"Macßird" concerns the nature
of American liberalism rather
than the death of President Ken
nedy.
