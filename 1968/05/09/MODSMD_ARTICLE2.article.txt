# Drake, Hayes Face ASSU Final Election
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
In a record turn-out for an
ASSU election, Vicky Drake and
Denis Hayes topped a field of
five official candidates and four
announced write-in candidates
for student president.
Since no candidate received
a majority of the votes cast for
the office, the eventual presi
dent will be determined in a
run-off election early next week.
In other voting yesterday,
students overwhelmingly
agreed with a referendum
calling for allowing "all em
ployers equal access to re
cruiting facilities."
Jack Collins and Bruce Smith,
the only announced candidates
for senior class president and
vice-president, received a major
ity of the vote cast in that race.
The over 4700 votes cast for
ASSU president, excluding bal
lots which have not been return
ed from overseas campuses,
were widely distributed: Vicki
Drake, 1575; Denis Hayes, 1232;
Harvey H. Hukari, Jr., 870, Mich
ael Bruwer, 373; Marc Sapir, 321;
"Mom" Bonini, 175; Art Wilson,
27; and Ira Mendlowitz, 6.
Vicki Drake commented last
night that her campaign ac
tivities right up to 4:15 yester
day afternoon left her "too
tired" to offer any definite state
ments.
Five referendum questions
were included on the ballot.

The first proposition asked,
"Should all employers — not
illegal in the eyes of the civil
courts — be allowed equal ac
cess to recruiting facilities?"
The measure passed by a 3920
to 676 margin.
The second question, asking
whether a campus recruiter
should be required to speak at
a "one-hour perior of discussion",
\( 100 members of the commu
nity desire, failed by 2444 to
1918.
Students recommended by a)
vote of 2116 to 1772 that Stan
ford discontinue its affiliation
with the National Student As
sociation.
Voters favored including Ter
minal Graduate students as
members of ASSU by a 3154 to
944 margin.
The final proposal that "spe
cific criteria be established for
all on-campus job recruiting"
by LASSU was defeated 3106 to
1191.
Referring to her campaign
style as "controversial," Miss
Drake indicated that she will
probably not enter into a debate
with Hayes.
Dennis Hayes said that he had
based his primary campaign on a
"low key" approach, but added
that "from now on we will be
swinging into high gear."
Candidates for the Women's
Recreation Association (WRA)
must submit a written state

ment to Craig Brown or to the
ASSU office by Friday if they
wiih to withdraw from the race.
Students receiving votes for
President were Vicky Drake,
Margaret Evans, Wendy Doheny,
Susan Heinberg, Ginger Smith,
and Susan Swarbrick. On the
ballot for vice-president were
Anne Kerwein, Ginger Smith,
Margaret Evans, and Carol Jes
sup. Listed for secretary were
Anne Kortlander, Ginger Smith,
Joan Cleminshaw, and Lilli Pur
cell.
