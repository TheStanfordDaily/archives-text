# Engineering Profs Propose Restructuring Of Curricuulm
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
An entire restructuring of un
dergraduate engineering has
been proposed by a committee
of four engineering professors
in a report released Tuesday.
Foremost among their recom
mendations was the establish
ment of a separate division for
undergraduate engineering and
greater flexibility in the curricu
lum.
The report, "Engineering Edu
cation at Stanford," was written
by Ralph J. Smith, electrical en
gineering professor and chair
man of the committee, James L.
Adams, associate professor of
mechanical enginnering, Perry
L. McCarty, civil engineering
professor, and William C. Rey
nolds, professor of mechanical
engineering.
The proposals will now go be
fore the engineering faculty for
approval.
Further suggestions Include
the establishment of four sep
arate committees to deter
mine the undergraduate curri
culum, Increased recruitment
of minority group students,
earlier exposure to general en
gineering courses, and wider
use of the computer.
The committee also pointed
out the present weaknesses in
advising and counseling, urging
that such activities be made vol
untary among the faculty so
that only those interested in the
Job will participate.
"Periodic feedback" on the

quality of advising given was
also proposed.
On the graduate level, the re
port recommended that a new
degree program, Master of Sci
ence in Engineering, be created.
This degree would be totally un
specialized.
This new degree program
would be for "students with un
usual undergraduate programs
or non â€¢ conventional career
goals." Interested students
should be allowed to create and
submit for approval their own
programs for this degree.
! Tau Beta PI will hold a for
um Wednesday, May 15, for
engineering students and fac
ulty to discuss the report. The
meeting will be at 7:30 p.m. In
the forum room of the Under
graduate Library.
The purpose of the meeting
is "to get the students to tell
the faculty how they feel about
the proposals, because the fac
ulty will vote on it, not the stu
dents," according to Eckhard
Schulz, graduate student in en
gineering and president of Tau
Beta Pi.
The most important recom
mendation in the report, Shulz
feels, is the plan for a separate
division of undergraduate edu
cation.
"The responsibility for the un
dergraduate curriculum will no
longer be with the departments,"
he said. This will lead to "greater
flexibility."
Included in this new pro
posal is the option of 30 units

of "free electlves." The com
mittee felt these were neces
sary because "engineering stu
dents not only desire Increas
ed flexibility, but they require
it In order to meet their in
dividual needs, and they are
capable of taking advantage of
It."
The recommendation for a
separate undergraduate division
cited three factors needed to en
hance undergraduate *>- ~'neer
ing education.
These include, "iden .ig
group of faculty members con
cerned with undergraduate edu
cation, assigning to them the
responsibility for devising, offer
ing, and modifying appropriate
courses of instruction, and allo
cating adequate administrative
time and funds to promote
course development, to support
educational innovation, and to
reward educational creativity."
The need for this separate
division is to "provide a focus so
that the efforts of individual pro
fessors would produce maximum
benefits at the undergraduate
level."
The report gave the following
areas as necessary to the under
graduate engineering curricu
lum: general studies, free elec
tives, basic mathematics, basic
science, engineering breadth
(basic knolwedge in more than
one specialized area), engineer
ing depth (a "coordinated se
quence of courses" in one field),
and functional balance (to pro
vide an "adequate amount of ex
perience in experimentation, ana
lysis, synthesis, and communi
cation").
