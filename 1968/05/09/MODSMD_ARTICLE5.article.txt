# Three Days Of Protest
## Students Comment On Sit-In 
### BARBARA RITZ 
Books and sleeping bags
strewn along corridors of the
Old Union represent almost 72
hours of waiting for several hun
dred Stanford students.
Tim Logan, KZSU station
manager, said there was a mis
conception of what was happen
ing at the sit-in which began
Monday.
"The hardest thing to control
are the rumors. The word got
out that 100 cops are outside
waiting to bust in, or that the
fraternities are coming down to

raid the place. It's not anything
like that."
In contrast to the crowds
on the first floor of the Union,
the second and third floors re
main nearly empty. Since Mon
day the people staying up
stairs lie on couches, study, or
talk in groups on the floor.
"People are cooperating
around here like human beings,"
according Steve Levin, a member
of the sit-in. "It's not as if the
whole thing were organized into
inanity."
Most of the police remained
apart from the sit-in yesterday,
but were willing to talk to stu

Patrolman Charles Papp call
ed the day "tiring" and jokingly
told a student lying on a couch
upstairs, "I haven't been able

Another policeman standing
in the courtyard termed the dem

"I don't know too much
about what they're doing.
We're just here to protect the
property and keep anybody
from getting hurt," he said.
Staff members resumed work
in the Union offices yesterday.

"It's a normal day for us,"
said one secretary in the cre
dentials office, "though every
thing's just a little confusing."
"We're just pushing papers,"
commented Jane Honikman and
Gloria Garing. "All our records
are not available. The people in
the building started taking pre
cautions early Monday. We were
all given a general lecture. Then
they closed the doors and lock
ed the windows. Later on the po
lice opened everything up and
the students began yelling "we
won, we won.' "
Secretary Dean Kulstad re
mained up all night with the
demonstrators.
"My husband and I are from
Columbia University," she
(aid. "I think that if you have
any sympathy with the stu
dents at all, you should stay."
"I think people ought to be
encouraged to come down and
listen to the protestors," com
mented Jo Pickford, a student
who came during the "open
house" planned for faculty mem
bers Wednesday afternoon.
"I was really against the
whole thing until I listened to
the facts. I didn't realize exact
