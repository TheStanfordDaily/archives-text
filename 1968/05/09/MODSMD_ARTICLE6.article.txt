• Campus Protests
NEW YORK (AP) — Conces
sions by school administrators
lulled student unrest on some
U.S. campuses Wednesday, but
continuing demonstrations else
where were marked by a hard
ening attitude on both sides.
An attorney representing 11
students, alumni and faculty
members of New York's trou
bled Columbia University asked
for a federal court injunction to
halt disciplinary action arising
from recent campus disorders.
Wellesley Mass., College
which has 1,750 girl students, in
cluding 24 Negroes, agreed to
admit an additional 20 Negroes
for the term beginning next Sep
tember. A Negro student organi
zation had threatened a hunger
strike unless more black under
graduates were enrolled.
Oberlin, an Ohio college of
2,700, issued an order banning
the use of school facilities for

placement interviews with stu
dents by government agencies,
universities and corporations.
The ban was triggered by stu
dent senate opposition to mili
tary recruiting on the campus.
Oberlin President Robert K.
Carr commented: "I have taken
this step very reluctantly be
cause, in my judgment, it in
volves an erosion, however
slight, of the open campus prin
ciple and practice that ought to
prevail at a college like Ober
lin."
• 'McNamara's WalV
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Pentagon is remaining close
mouthed on how North Vietnam
was able to infiltrate 80,000 to
100,000 troops into South Viet
nam this year despite a $1 bil
lion obstacle system below the
DMZ.
Defense officials have appar
ently chosen to ignore all ques

tions about the effectiveness of
the anti-infiltration setup, an
nounced last Sept. 7 by Robert
S. MeNamara, then secretary of
defense.
The system — sometimes re
ferred to as "McNamara's
wall" — includes a series of
front-line strongpoints linked
with strips of barbed wire, mine
fields and air-sown seismic de
vices that sound an alarm when
troops or vehicles move into the
area.
Although the Pentagon has
said the barrier would only be
installed in South Vietnamese
territory below the demilitar
ized zone, a high Laotian gov
ernment source in Vientiane
said Jan. 23 its electronic fea
tures were being extended into
Laos.
• Unemployment Low
WASHINGTON (AP) — Only
3.5 per cent of the nation's

workers were unemployed In
April, matching a 15-year low,
but the jobless rate was double
in big city slums, the govern
ment said Wednesday.
The number of jobless work
ers In the nation dipped under
2.5 million for the first time
since 1953. Total employment
rose by 500,000 to 75.1 million,
the Labor Department said.
But a new study showed the
poorest ghettos in the 100 larg
est U.S. cities were Islands of
poverty and hardship surround
ed by expanding jobs and in
come for most other Americans.
• President Hopeful
WASHINGTON (AP)- Short
ly before the U.S. delegation's
takeoff for its meeting with
North Vietnamese envoys, Pres

talks will lead to an honorable
