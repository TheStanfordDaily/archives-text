# Student Associates Attempt To Fill Communication Gap
## 
### VAL WESTEN 
Efforts to bridge the student
alumni and student-faculty com
munication gaps are now being
made through the Student As
sociate Club at Stanford.
The Stanford Today and To
morrow Group and the Bowman
Alumni House initiated the pro
gram last spring to facilitate
communication among students,
faculty, alumni and administra
tors. More than 20 students are
now working with the Bowman
House on projects with this pur
pose.
1 One of the chief function*
of the student associates is

being affiliated with one of the
off-campus alumni organiza
tions known as Stanford Clubs.
The clubs are really Interest
ed In what students think, and
what is happening on the cam
pus, says Miss Sarah Strong,
one of the organizers of the
program. "We would like
have students meeting with
the clubs to tell them their
views rather than have the
alums read what is going on In
the paper/' she pointed out.
The associates are also active
on campus. One notable accom
plishment is the success of the
student - faculty - alumni dinners
which they have organized
through the alumni house. In
part, the success stems from the
small size of the dinners — us
ually about 20.
The entire program is expand
ing rapidly, according to Miss
Strong. "Last year things were
much less formal and on a smal
ler scale," she said.
During fall and winter quar
ters associates travelled to Stan
ford Clubs to speak to alumni.
Speaking engagements began to
include other interested groups.
Student associate Kirk Hanson
addressed a Pasadena Women's
Club. Two other associates jour
neyed to Arizona to hold a panel
discussion for the alumni and
for high school students who
had been accepted for next year.
Spring quarter resulted in
more planning. Associates were
invited to attend the Club Lead
er Workshop, May 24-25, and to
work with the alumni in up
coming activities.
Summer plans are becoming
concrete. The associates will
be working more extensively
with the Stanford Clubs in the
areas where they live. Work
ing together they will spon

sor freshmen parties In early
September.
All entering frosh in the area
are invited and the upperclass
men will be on hand to answer
questions and offer suggestions.
The object is to provide an in
formal atmosphere where the
frosh will feel free to discuss
things they are unsure about.
Other summer projects include
all-student parties and summer
employment drives. The purpose
of the first is to bring freshmen
and upperclassmen into contact.
There has been little solicita
tion for students to join the
program. However, people keep
calling the Bowman house and
asking about it, Miss Strong said.
"I guess they just heard about
it from someone and thought it
sounded interesting."

During fall and winter quar
ters associates travelled to Stan
ford Clubs to speak to alumni.
Speaking engagements began to
include other interested groups.
Student associate Kirk Hanson
addressed a Pasadena Women's
Club. Two other associates jour
neyed to Arizona to hold a panel
discussion for the alumni and
for high school students who
had been accepted for next year.
Spring quarter resulted in
more planning. Associates were
invited to attend the Club Lead
er Workshop, May 24-25, and to
work with the alumni in up
coming activities.
Summer plans are becoming
concrete. The associates will
be working more extensively
with the Stanford Clubs in the
areas where they live. Work
ing together they will spon

sor freshmen parties In early
September.
All entering frosh in the area
are invited and the upperclass
men will be on hand to answer
questions and offer suggestions.
The object is to provide an in
formal atmosphere where the
frosh will feel free to discuss
things they are unsure about.
Other summer projects include
all-student parties and summer
employment drives. The purpose
of the first is to bring freshmen
and upperclassmen into contact.
There has been little solicita
tion for students to join the
program. However, people keep
calling the Bowman house and
asking about it, Miss Strong said.
"I guess they just heard about
it from someone and thought it
sounded interesting."
Efforts to bridge the student
alumni and student-faculty com
munication gaps are now being
made through the Student As

The Stanford Today and To
morrow Group and the Bowman
Alumni House initiated the pro
gram last spring to facilitate
communication among students,
faculty, alumni and administra

now working with the Bowman
House on projects with this pur
pose.
1 One of the chief function*
of the student associates is

being affiliated with one of the
off-campus alumni organiza
tions known as Stanford Clubs.
The clubs are really Interest
ed In what students think, and
what is happening on the cam
pus, says Miss Sarah Strong,
one of the organizers of the
program. "We would like
have students meeting with
the clubs to tell them their
views rather than have the
alums read what is going on In
the paper/' she pointed out.
The associates are also active
on campus. One notable accom
plishment is the success of the
student - faculty - alumni dinners
which they have organized
through the alumni house. In
part, the success stems from the
small size of the dinners — us
ually about 20.
The entire program is expand
ing rapidly, according to Miss
Strong. "Last year things were
