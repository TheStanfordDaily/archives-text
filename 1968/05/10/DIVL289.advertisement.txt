"If peace were to come to Vietnam tomorrow, it still would
be incumbent on every American to look at this film. .

"WAR'S MOST DEVASTATING PORTRAIT!"—David Douglas
Duncan Photographer—Correspondent LIFE MAGAZINE
"A superbly balanced sampling of this war . . . the excellence
of 'A FACE OF WAR' is not only in its fine camera work, but
also in its sense of completeness ... it grinds no axes, pleads
no cause, and its record of this battleground should enduro
long after the agony is ended."—TlME MAGAZINE
