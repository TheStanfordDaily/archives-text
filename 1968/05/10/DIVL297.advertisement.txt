Political Canvassing Is Not A Game
We canvass for a very good reason. A canvass indicates a candidate's strength in a particular
precinct. On primary election day, it is that precinct we bring out in force.
We canvass for another very good reason. A canvass tells us what issues concern the voter.
A candidate must address the issues.
And we canvass because the door-to-door approach means votes. But we don't just canvass.
We canvass for Eugene McCarthy—the candidate with the solid record—on Vietnam, on Civil
Rights, on urban problems.
