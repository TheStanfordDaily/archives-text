# LASSU Endorses C15 Plan, Recommends Three Changes
## 
### 
Last night the ASSU legisla
ture voted overwhelmingly to en
dorse the Committee of 15 (Cl 5)
judicial reform plan in principle
and suggested several revisions.
LASSU recommended:
• That the faculty members of
the Academic Council be allow
ed choose its own representatives
to the Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council (SCLC), the legisla
tive body to be composed under
the third resolution of the Cl 5
plan.
The Cl 5 statement proposes
that the President choose six
faculty members for the SCLC
from a 12 member panel nom
inated by an "agency of the Aca
demic Council."
• That the "interim regula
tion" power of the President to
make regulations when the
SCLC is not meeting be limited
to be in effect no longer than
ninety days (the length of the
summer session when the SCLC
will not be conducting meet
ings).
• That the chairman of the
Stanford Judicial Council not
be chosen by the President from
among the faculty of the Law
school, but instead proposed that
the Chairman be chosen by the
other eight members (four stu
dents, four faculty) of the SJC
from the Law school community.
The LASSU resolution endors
ing the Cl 5 plan was worded as
follows:
"LASSU accepts the recom
mendations of Cl 5 in principle;
furthermore LASSU instructs
the student members of Cl 5 to
continue to work toward a final
student judicial system, attempt
ing to implement such changes
as LASSU recommends."
The resolution was passed by
more than a three to one vote.
LASSU representative Eric
Triesman, also a member of the
Cl 5, said, "What we've got now
is nothing, but by the passage
of the Cl 5 plan we at least have
the possibility of getting what

we want. Giving power to the
faculty is better than leaving it
in the hands of the adrntnistra
tion."
In response to the request in
President Sterling's statement
that the Cl 5 plan "be submitted
at the earliest time to a refer
endum of all students and
members df the Academic Coun
cil. One member said, "There is
no need to put into a referen
dum. We represent the student
body."
After the endorsement of the
Cl 5 plan, Barry Askinas sug
gested that the proposed Stan
ford Judicial Council and all

judicial procedures at Stanford
should have jurisdiction only on
academic affairs.
An objection was made that
this would destroy Stanford's
status as a "sanctuary" where
outside police have no jurisdic
tion unless sanctioned by the
President's office. LASSU unani
mously voted against the resolu
tion.
The Legislature also rejected
a bill that would have removed
Speaker Michael Weinstein
from his post "Because of events
of the last week."

from his post "Because of events
of the last week."
Last night the ASSU legisla
ture voted overwhelmingly to en
dorse the Committee of 15 (Cl 5)
judicial reform plan in principle
and suggested several revisions.
LASSU recommended:
• That the faculty members of
the Academic Council be allow
ed choose its own representatives
to the Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council (SCLC), the legisla
tive body to be composed under
the third resolution of the Cl 5
plan.
The Cl 5 statement proposes
that the President choose six
faculty members for the SCLC
from a 12 member panel nom
inated by an "agency of the Aca
demic Council."
• That the "interim regula
tion" power of the President to
make regulations when the
SCLC is not meeting be limited
to be in effect no longer than
ninety days (the length of the
summer session when the SCLC
will not be conducting meet
ings).
• That the chairman of the
Stanford Judicial Council not
be chosen by the President from
among the faculty of the Law
school, but instead proposed that
the Chairman be chosen by the
other eight members (four stu
dents, four faculty) of the SJC
from the Law school community.
The LASSU resolution endors
ing the Cl 5 plan was worded as
follows:
"LASSU accepts the recom
mendations of Cl 5 in principle;
furthermore LASSU instructs
the student members of Cl 5 to
continue to work toward a final
student judicial system, attempt
ing to implement such changes
as LASSU recommends."
The resolution was passed by
more than a three to one vote.
LASSU representative Eric
Triesman, also a member of the
Cl 5, said, "What we've got now
is nothing, but by the passage
of the Cl 5 plan we at least have
the possibility of getting what

we want. Giving power to the
faculty is better than leaving it
in the hands of the adrntnistra
tion."
In response to the request in
President Sterling's statement
that the Cl 5 plan "be submitted
at the earliest time to a refer
endum of all students and
members df the Academic Coun
cil. One member said, "There is
no need to put into a referen
dum. We represent the student
body."
After the endorsement of the
Cl 5 plan, Barry Askinas sug
gested that the proposed Stan
ford Judicial Council and all

judicial procedures at Stanford
should have jurisdiction only on
academic affairs.
An objection was made that
this would destroy Stanford's
status as a "sanctuary" where
outside police have no jurisdic
tion unless sanctioned by the
President's office. LASSU unani
mously voted against the resolu
tion.
The Legislature also rejected
a bill that would have removed
Speaker Michael Weinstein
from his post "Because of events
of the last week."
