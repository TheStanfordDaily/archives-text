One should not judge a man on the basis of what he did during
three days. Provost Richard W. Lyman made mistakes in deal
ing with the sit-in, but much that he did not do saved this uni
versity.
He did not order in the police. He tried in all sincerity and
commitment to his conscience to deal with the crisis, even if oth
ers disagree with his actions and thoughts.
In the past Lyman has shown great skill in handling the prob
lems of his complex and difficult office. His intelligence and
ability suggest he will do so in the future.
There has been much speculation on campus that Lyman will
resign because of the Academic Council vote on Wednesday.
In this time of division and unrest on campus, Stanford needs
Richard Lyman, and we urge him to stay.
