# Sunrise

### 
Old Union business is back to normal, students are back in the
classroom, faculty have returned to their research, and Stanford
seems to have returned to its sunny, placid pace.
We wouldn't bet on it. The long range currents stimulated by
the three-day sit-in will have major consequences for the uni
versity and only 36 hours after the crisis, Stanford is a different
place.
The focus of power may not have changed dramatically enough
to satisfy many of us, but it is changing and it is exactly this fer
ment and movement that are transforming Stanford. There is
a new consciousness of power and problems underlying life in
the university.
At any moment, power can flash to the surface and focus at
tention and action on a particular issue. Such focal points are
going to be more frequent and tense, and it is a fear of the
emergence of power that now dominates this community.
The flashy transformation has temporarily ended and Stanford
has avoided the convulsive revolution that almost destroyed
Columbia University. Yet Stanford's ferment runs as deep.
We are not the same, Stanford is not the same, and if some
think otherwise, perhaps that is why change is needed.
