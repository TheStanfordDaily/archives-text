Can Election Outcome
Be Justified As Joke?
Editor, The Dally:
The faith in the judgment of
the student body to join the com
munity of rational adults mani
fested in the Academic Council
action on Thursday was short
lived. One has only to witness
the results of the ASSU elec
tion. To justify the outcome as a
joke would justify, in return,
reference to the incumbent pres
ident as the best Italian joke of
the year. On the other hand, per
haps neither requires such jus
tification?
