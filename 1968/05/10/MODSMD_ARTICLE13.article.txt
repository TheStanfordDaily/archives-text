## Colleges Slide Downhill Toward Inferior Education? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The top story on page one of
the April 29 Dally about the
pending selections of new heads
of Oregon U. and of Stanford,
brings melancholy memories to
this former foreign correspon
dent.
In years gone by, as I ob
served the turmoil and lost time
— forever lost — among student
bodies in foreign universities
who subordinated academic ex
cellence to politics and non-scho
lastic campus pursuits, I plea
sured myself immensely by
thinking of the studying stu
dents in U.S. universities and
colleges who believed that be
coming educated was their first
order of business.
Alas and lack, our collegians
— the single most privileged
group in the world today — only
too clearly are steadily sliding
down the hill that leads to in
ferior higher education.
Why is it that a student who
would not dream of consider
ing himself capable of sitting in
for David Rockefeller in the
presidency of Chase Manhattan,
blithely considers himself ca
pable of sitting-in on the the
selection of the next president
of Stanford, a task requiring
every bit as much judgment,
technical knowledge, skill and ex
perience as Mr. Rockefeller uti
lizes in running Chase Manhat
tan?
How is it that a student whose
most serious problem to date
has been which shirt to wear
sees nothing ludicrous or out of
proportion in demanding (does
n't anyone suggest, ask or rec
ommend these days?) an active
voice in the actual conduct of
a great university, which is a
really large enterprise and ex
ceedingly complex because it
deals with human beings and
human values as well as stadia,
buildings, payrolls and curricu
lums?
But far, far over and abovo
this pathetic awareness is the
certainty that student bodies
everywhere in the U.S. are not
keeping their eyes on the hole
card, which should be to ob
tain the best possible education.
What really amounts only to
mere distractions are steadily
becoming more important to too
many thousands of students
than the education they pre
sumably are seeking.
Consequently, as the years
roll by, the over-all level of
knowledge of university and col
lege graduates can onlyl de
crease. Just as has been the

case among the graduates of
foreign schools for many, many
years. . . .

Editor, The Daily:
I imagine that there comes a
time in almost everyone's life

when a decision must be made
that reflects a fundamental at
tachment or some deep convic
tion or ideal. We have witnessed
such a choice and such a con
viction recently in the cam
paign of Vicki Drake.
Three cheers for the Sit-Iners
and to hell with each and every
one of us.
