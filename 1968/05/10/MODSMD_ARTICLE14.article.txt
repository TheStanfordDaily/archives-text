# The
						Washington Merry-Go-Round
## Thailand In Danger Of Revolt 
### Drew Pearson 
The Pentagon isn't shouting
about it, but it had to send more
troops into Thailand. While truce
talks are scheduled for Vietnam
the situation in Thailand has
deteriorated.
It may well be that the United
States will find itself with troops
being transferred from one war
to another in Southeast Asia.
At present more than 43,000
American troops are stationed in

Thailand. The Air Force is op
erating eight bases throughout
the country. This is more troops
and more bases than the United
States had in South Vietnam
between 1954 and 1964. At the
end of 1964, there were only 18,-
000 U.S. troops in South Viet
nam.
Weapons Stockpiled
In addition to 43,000 U.S.
troops now in Thailand, weapons
and equipment have been stock
piled to support a far larger
force. Meanwhile the Commu
nists are stepping up their infil
tration of the country, and guer
rilla activity has increased in
three separate areas.
The United States is bound by
treaty to help defend Thailand
from a Communist takeover,
and it seems certain that Thai
authorities in the face of a Com
munist threat will invoke the
treaty. The difficulty is that
Thailand is a monarchy support
ed by a military dictatorship,
with almost no vestige of demo
cracy. There is extreme wealth
at the top, extreme poverty at
the bottom, and corruption run
ning rampant through the rul
ing class.
It's a country made to order
for Communist revolt, and if the
United States is going to defend
it, we should begin now to de
mand basic social and economic
reforms.
Johnson Compromises
In order to get Senate action
on his crime control bill, Pres
ident Johnson has made a secret
deal with Sen. John McClellan,
D-Ark., not to veto the wiretap
amendments.

Senate conservatives also ex
pect to shove down the Presi
dent's throat some amendments
overturning the Supreme Court's
controversial decisions on the
rights of criminal suspects. In
effect, the amendments would
knock out the safeguards which
the high court has upheld in
recent years and would virtual
ly negate the authority of the
federal courts to review criminal
cases.
As chairman of the Senate
Criminal Laws and Procedures
Subcommittee, McClellan refused
last year to process the crime
control bill unless the President
would agree to legalizing tele
phone taps. This was made plain
by the dour McClellan at a pri
vate White House meeting with
the President last fall.
No Snooping
LBJ happens to feel strongly
that people ought to be able to
talk on the telephone without
government snoops listening in.
He uses the telephone constant
ly himself and suspects his own
wires are tapped by inquisitive
government agencies. He also is
a great admirer of Chief Justice
Earl Warren, who is a staunch
defender of Constitutional free
doms.
Rather than permit the vital
crime measure to die, however,
the President called McClellan
to the White House recently
and agreed to his terms. LBJ not
only promised not to veto the
wiretap provisions but to per
suade House Judiciary Chair
man Emanuel Celler not to tie
them up in the House.
Once McClellan turned the

crime bill loose, however, Sen.
Sam Ervin, D-N. C., came to him
with certain hamstringing
amendments. They were care
fully worded to overrule the Su
preme Court on the rights of
citizens who are arrested by the
police.
Clever Wording
Ervin, an astute constitutional
lawyer, also phrased the amend
ments to forestall the Supreme
Court from ruling on their con
stitutionality. Since it is ques
tionable whether Ervin's clever
language can really prevent this,
Senate conservatives are gamb
ling on a switch of one vote
on the closely divided court to
uphold the amendments.
FBI boss J. Edgar Hoover also
sent his emissaries around to see
McClellan about incorporating
into the crime bill some addi
tional clauses that would give
the FBI a legislative monopoly
over police training.
This is opposed by the Inter
national Association of Chiefs
of Police, which has complained
that the FBI in the past has dis
criminated against police who re
fuse to kowtow to Hoover. The
lACP wants authority to set up
its own regional training centers.
But Hoover, going behind the
back of Attorney General Ram
sey Clark, has persuaded McClel
lan to amend the crime bill to
grant the FBI monopoly.
Meanwhile, it looks as if the
Senate hardheads are unwilling
to take action against rampant
crime unless they are also per
mitted to ride roughshod over
individual rights.
