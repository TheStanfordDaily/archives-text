## Sit-In Like 'Lord Of The Flies' 
### 
(This column was submitted
by PETE LOVE, a senior history
major).
Having visited many of the
recent "happenings" during the
present "sit-in," I was most inter
ested in the Tuesday night ses
sion when David Packard of the
Board of Trustees made an ap
pearance. At the time of his ap
pearance, I didn't think much
about it or the signficance his
presence had on the "sit
downers."
As Bruce Franklin later so
aptly described, there was a com
plete "tone change" in the meet
ing after Mr. Packard arrived
on the scene. In fact, the simi
larity of this situation to an
other one (which I'm sure many
people know about) was so strik
ing that I cannot resist mention
ing it. To my mind the two situ
ations are synonomous — only
the "sit-in" occurred in 1968
and not back in the 1950's when
William Golding wrote Lord of
the Flies.
Little Children
Everyone will recall the scene
where the "great warriors" (ac
tually little children) came
storming down the beach after
Ralph screaming at the top of
their lungs, 'Kill the pig, kill the
pig!", and then suddenly stop
ping and gazing up at this mon
strous specimen of a human be
ing who happened to be the cap
tain of a passing ship. All the
great "warriors" suddenly drop
ped all their weapons, and with
an awe-struck awareness return
ed to their true identity of little
children.
Likewise, Tuesday night.
When Mr. Packard appeared,
there was a sudden awe, respect,
quietness, and indescribable rev
erence. The immediate "tone
switch" was unbelievable—from
that of a bunch of noisy, clam
orous, powerful adults to a
throng of awe-filled, powerless
children!
Someone witnessing the event
pointed out (after Mr. Packard

had left) that he (Packard) had
continually referred to those stu
dents sitting in as "you young
sters." Many of those demonstra
ting felt this was very demean
ing to their personal character,
pride, and adult-like attitudes.
It seemed to many people
standing inside the door (myself
included) that the issue for the
moment was very simple: wheth
er or not to change the present
strategy or tactic of "sitting-in"
the Old Union, in view of a great
deal of student dissent (especial
ly when the night before, a vote
had been taken to eject them
from the premises.)
Confusion, Chaos
However, a great portion of
the talk seemed to be quite unre
lated to this matter — and to
someone entering and viewing
the dialogue without any pre
vious idea to the nature of the
discussion, it would seem like
utter confusion and chaos!
It was a bit ironic to me to
see how a representation of the

very thing in question by the
students (i.e. the administration,
Board of Trustees, etc.) created
awe in those same students. It
only pointed out, I believe, how
much the students have incul
cated values of an older genera
tion into their own lives (i.e.
how the money, power, position,
and physical "bigness" of Mr.
Packard affected them emotion
ally.)
Still Dependent
Secondly, it proved to me how
much dependent the students
still are on the "existing powers"
(faculty, administration, Board
of Trustees, etc.) no matter how
hard they try to reject that idea.
Here, in other words, were the
great revolutionaries.
So perhaps Packard was right
when he viewed the demonstra
tors as "youngster" (i.e. as those
in Lord of the Flies) — Perhaps
some of these "Stanford young
sters" being a little more pre
cocious than the average child,
however!
