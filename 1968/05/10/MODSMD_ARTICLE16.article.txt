Information concerning the
transfer of credit for courses
taken at other universities dur
ing the summer may be obtain
ed through the Credit Evalua
tion Office in the Old Union.

The decision about credit
transfer is based on the Report
to the American Association of
Collegiate Registrars and Ad
missions Officers on The Credit
Given by Educational Institu
tions. This handbook will deter
mine whether the college Is ac
credited by Stanford, according
to June Wright, secretary.
If the course to be transferred
falls under the category of Gen
eral Studies, Mrs. Wright then
consults the college's course
catalogue to determine if the
course is equivalent to any
course offered at Stanford. If the
two courses are equal, and the

grade earned is acceptable, then
Stanford credit can be given.
Any courses taken to satisfy
major requirements must be
approved by the major depart
ment at Stanford before credit
transfer can be
It is advisable to do this be
fore enrolling in the courses.
Course equivalence is deter
mined by comparison of subjects,
material covered, and depth of
coverage. If the courses do not
match, a maximum of six units
may be granted for non-parallel
work.
A C- average must be maintain
ed for all outside work if the
credit is to be transferred. The
transcript for outside work is
kept separate from the Stan
ford transcript. The reason for
this is that although the outside
units are applied towards grad
uation requirements, the grades
are not incorporated into the
Stanford GPA.
For sequence courses, such
as English, history, languages,

or math courses, credit Is al
lowed only up to the maximum
given at Stanford, Mrs. Wright
explained. For example, the
required basic history course
at Stanford is twelve units to
tal. Even if a similar series
taken is sixteen units, only
twelve units may be transfer
red.
Anyone who wishes to transfer
credit towards his Stanford grad
uation requirements must file a
petition to this effect within four
weeks of his re-registration at
Stanford. Petitions can be ob
tained in the Credit Evaluation
Office.

The decision about credit
transfer is based on the Report
to the American Association of
Collegiate Registrars and Ad
missions Officers on The Credit
Given by Educational Institu

credited by Stanford, according
to June Wright, secretary.
If the course to be transferred
falls under the category of Gen
eral Studies, Mrs. Wright then
consults the college's course
catalogue to determine if the
course is equivalent to any
course offered at Stanford. If the
two courses are equal, and the

grade earned is acceptable, then
Stanford credit can be given.
Any courses taken to satisfy
major requirements must be
approved by the major depart

transfer can be
It is advisable to do this be
fore enrolling in the courses.
Course equivalence is deter
mined by comparison of subjects,
material covered, and depth of
coverage. If the courses do not
match, a maximum of six units
may be granted for non-parallel
work.
A C- average must be maintain
ed for all outside work if the
credit is to be transferred. The
transcript for outside work is
kept separate from the Stan
ford transcript. The reason for
this is that although the outside
units are applied towards grad
uation requirements, the grades
are not incorporated into the
Stanford GPA.
For sequence courses, such
as English, history, languages,

or math courses, credit Is al
lowed only up to the maximum
given at Stanford, Mrs. Wright
explained. For example, the
required basic history course
at Stanford is twelve units to
tal. Even if a similar series
taken is sixteen units, only
twelve units may be transfer
red.
Anyone who wishes to transfer
credit towards his Stanford grad
uation requirements must file a
petition to this effect within four
weeks of his re-registration at
Stanford. Petitions can be ob
tained in the Credit Evaluation
Office.
