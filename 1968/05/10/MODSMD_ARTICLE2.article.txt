# Library, Newspaper Combined
## 'The Daily Computer' Likely 
### BARBARA HYLAND 
Professor Edwin B. Parker of
the communication department
foresees a future information
system which will use comput
ers as both libraries and a news
paper. This will be one product
of the communication revolu
tion which our society is under
going.
"The New Communication Me
dia" was the topic of the speech
made by Parker in Tresidder
to a small audience. It was part
of the Century 21 lecture series.
The computer of the near fu
ture will look like a "cross be
tween a television set and a type
writer," according to Parker.
Control will come from the re
ceiver not the sender, which is
a "drastic change." Parker said
that "the world's store of infor
mation will be at everyone's
finger tips."
In its role as a "combination
of newspaper and library," this
medium will replace a library
card catalog. One will be able to

type queries and the computer
will answer. The information of
an encyclopedia will be stored in
it for handy reference.
A display screen will supplant
newspapers. At breakfast the
headlines will be as current as
possible since, unlike in a news
paper they can be changed sec
onds before the public sees
them.
If the viewer wants more data
on a particular story, back
ground material can be trans
mitted since it is all stored in
the computer. This could in
clude biographies on people in
the news or even the cartoons
of the previous week.
Publishers who turn to this
media will bypass the fantastic
production and distribution ex
penses of newspapers. The daily
information the computer will
transmit will be like a news
paper "25 times the size of the
Sunday Times," Parker says.
The reader can choose what he
is interested in.

The social implications of the
communication revolution are
"more far reaching than those
of the Industrial Revolution,"
Parker says. Society will be
"giving the public the informa
tion they want and not what
some authority thinks they
should have." Parker thinks
that the new system will be
more democratic.
