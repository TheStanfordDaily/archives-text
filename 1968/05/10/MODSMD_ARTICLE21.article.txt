# Indian Trackmen Enter Coast Relays
## 
### 
Its dual meet season at an
end, Stanford's track and field
team will now take to the relays
trail, beginning with the West
Coast Relays at Fresno this Sat
urday and ending with the Cali
fornia Relays two weeks later
The varsity's 45-100 loss to
California last week left it with
a 2-6 dual meet record, but with
four school record holders, three
of them who have the top
Pacific-8 marks in their events,
the Tribe influence should be
felt in the upcoming meets. To
further tint the West Coast Re
lays results cardinal, a comple
ment from the undefeated (10-0)
