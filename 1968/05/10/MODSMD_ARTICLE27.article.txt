# Stanford Hosts AFA In Lacrosse Titanic
## 
### 
Sparta comes to meet Athens
this weekend in the major con
frontation of the season in west
ern lacrosse. The Air Force
Academy and Stanford will face
off this Saturday at 2 p.m. on
the Stanford Rugby field. The
game has been moved from the
regular lacrosse field to the
rugby field to accommodate the
expected crowd.
The only blemish on Stan
ford's record last year came
in Colorado at the expense of
the Falcons in a closely con
tested 6-4 game. The Indians
are going into this game once
again undefeated and this
time they hope to keep mat
ters that way.
Air Force has lost three times
to powerful teams. They suc
cumbed in overtime to defend
ing Ivy League champion Cor
nell, to Baltimore University, and
were upset on an off day by
North Carolina.
The game will not be
merely a contest between two
good teams, but a conflict be
tween two fundamental styles
of lacrosse, the Athenian and
the Spartan. Military Acad
emy teams are well-drilled,
well-conditioned and predicta
ble. Stanford plays in the Ivy
League mold: tough, but
wiley. The Indians will essen
tially be trying to outsmart
a machine.
Two-thirds of the Academy
starting artack is from Balti
more, the heart of lacrosse coun
try. One of those two is Russ
Voris, an All-American honor
able mention selection last year.

As a result, the Falcons are
a high-scoring team. But they
have not met the equivalent
of Stanford's defense all sea
son. Dubbed this week the
"pacification team," the de
fensive unit of Bill Eakland,
Dennis McNeely, Wade Kill
efer and Mel Ellis hope to put
the wraps on the Falcon of

fense with not neoessartly
pacific means.
Meanwhile, Coach Don Ron
ayne wants a rejuvenated at
tack to go to work on All-Amer
ican Falcon goalie Bill Mark
ham. "Constant pressure," Ron
ayne says, "is the way to beat
a goalie like Markham." The In
dians hope to keep the pressure
on all afternoon.

have not met the equivalent
of Stanford's defense all sea
son. Dubbed this week the
"pacification team," the de
fensive unit of Bill Eakland,
Dennis McNeely, Wade Kill
efer and Mel Ellis hope to put
the wraps on the Falcon of

fense with not neoessartly
pacific means.
Meanwhile, Coach Don Ron
ayne wants a rejuvenated at
tack to go to work on All-Amer
ican Falcon goalie Bill Mark
ham. "Constant pressure," Ron
ayne says, "is the way to beat
a goalie like Markham." The In
dians hope to keep the pressure
on all afternoon.

PACIFICATION TKAM — This Is the Stanford defense which will try to put the stoppers on the Air
Force Academy Saturday. Considered by some observers as the best defense in the nation, they are
(left to right) Hugh West, Dennis McNeely, Bill Kakland, Mel Ellis, Wade Killefer, Nat Benchley,
and Buc Wales.
Sparta comes to meet Athens
this weekend in the major con
frontation of the season in west
ern lacrosse. The Air Force
Academy and Stanford will face
off this Saturday at 2 p.m. on
the Stanford Rugby field. The
game has been moved from the
regular lacrosse field to the
rugby field to accommodate the
expected crowd.
The only blemish on Stan
ford's record last year came
in Colorado at the expense of
the Falcons in a closely con
tested 6-4 game. The Indians
are going into this game once
again undefeated and this
time they hope to keep mat
ters that way.
Air Force has lost three times
to powerful teams. They suc
cumbed in overtime to defend
ing Ivy League champion Cor
nell, to Baltimore University, and
were upset on an off day by
North Carolina.
The game will not be
merely a contest between two
good teams, but a conflict be
tween two fundamental styles
of lacrosse, the Athenian and
the Spartan. Military Acad
emy teams are well-drilled,
well-conditioned and predicta
ble. Stanford plays in the Ivy
League mold: tough, but
wiley. The Indians will essen
tially be trying to outsmart
a machine.
Two-thirds of the Academy
starting artack is from Balti
more, the heart of lacrosse coun
try. One of those two is Russ
Voris, an All-American honor
able mention selection last year.

As a result, the Falcons are
a high-scoring team. But they
have not met the equivalent
of Stanford's defense all sea
son. Dubbed this week the
"pacification team," the de
fensive unit of Bill Eakland,
Dennis McNeely, Wade Kill
efer and Mel Ellis hope to put
