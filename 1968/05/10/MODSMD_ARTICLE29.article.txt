# Shank Gets Call
## Tribe Battles USC 
### GARY CAVALLI 
League-leading USC hosts
Stanford this afternoon in what
must be labelled the most im
portant game of the Pacific-8
baseball season.
The Trojans (9-1) currently
hold a one-and-a-half game lead
over both Stanford (7-2) and
UCLA (8-3). The Indians can
move to within a half-game of
Troy with a win Friday, but they
will be even in the all-important
loss-column.
Saturday the Tribe meets the
Bruins in an equally vital dou
bleheader at UCLA. A sweep
of the twin bill would put Stan
ford in excellent position to
pocket the Pac-8 championship,
since USC and UCLA still must
face each other May 25.
Coach Ray Young has de
cided to go with senior right
hander Harvey Shank in Fri
day's pivotal contest. Shank
is 3-0 in league play (9-1 over

all) and has a sparkling 1.00
ERA.
Saturday Young will send Rod
Poteete to the mound in the
opener and use either Sandy
Vance, Phil Keller or Don Rose
in the nightcap.
The frontrunning Trojans will
counter with either Bob Vaughn
or Jim Barr, who are both
among the conference ERA
leaders.
USC also can boast a potent
offlense, as evidenced by a .278
team batting average In
league play. Outfielder Reld
Branden is currently leading
Pac-8 hitters, wielding the
stick at a .444 clip.
Stanford's hitting output
has picked up of late, and the
Indians now lead the Western
circuit in runs scored with 97.
Bob Gallagher has been the
Tribe's most consistent hitter,
iwth a .333 average in league
play and 8 RBl's.
