# Sterling Grants Demands
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
President J. E. Wallace Ster
ling and Provost Richard Lyman
last night approved the recom
mendations of the Academic Sen
ate for a new judicial system.
Their statement came seven
hours after the proposals, work
ed out by the Committee of 15,
were blasted as incomplete by
some student leaders at a White
Plaza noon rally attended by
about 900 students.
The proposed changes call for
increased student involvement in
the making and enforcement of
campus rules, but provide for a
(faculty majority on separate
committees for these two areas.
Sterling and Lyman said they
deferred to the faculty recom
mendation that "no action be
taken by the University to im
pose penalties on students" for
the recent Old Union sit-in.
The administrators called
for student and faculty refer
enda on the proposals as soon
as possible.
At the rally, many of the lead
ers of the Old Union sit-in, which
ended Wednesday night, com
plained about the faculty major
ities and the lack of an appeal
system in the Cl 5 plans.
Steve Weissman, former Ber

keley Free Speech Movement
leader, called for contained ap
plication of "confrontation pol
itics" to gain two new goals—
student control of faculty tenure
appointments and presidential
selection.
"We have to take the power
away from the trustees," th?
graduate student in Latin Amer
ican studies said. "We must de
mand not only that students sit
in on the committee for presi
dential selection, but that stu
dents vote in referendum on any
choice of that committee."
"Students need confrontation
politics so they will not be co
opted into the consensus of de
cision making," he added.
Others who criticized the Cl 5
proposals at the rally included
Tim Haight, graduate student in
communications, Peter Dolinger,
graduate student in biological
sciences, and ASSU President
Cesare Massarenti.
But others praised the work.
Hubert Marshall, professor of
political science and CIS chair
man, called the changes "a
major step toward community
government."
The Academic Council, in
urging the changes Wednesday,
had asked for a "prompt and
favorable response" from all seg
ments of the University com
munity.
The demonstrators replied
Wednesday night by ending
their sit-in. And Sterling and
Lyman approved the plans last
night.
In endorsing the change, Ster
ljng recommended that the new
plan "be submitted at the earli
est practicable time to a refer
endum of all students ... all
members of the Academic Coun
cil."
By agreeing to the Academic
Council's proposal, in effect Ster
ling and Lyman agreed to set
aside suspension proposed for
seven students by the Interim
Judicial Body in the wake of
their anti-CIA protest last No
vember, but reserved the right
to appeal the case to the new
board proposed by Cl 5.
Whether they will appeal is
another question. At the noon
rally, Sanford Dorbusch, profes
sor of sociology, he did not

know if Sterling would appeal
the case, "but it would be ex
tremely foolish to open the bag
again."
But Sterling and Lyman
made clear what action they
would take if such a situation
ever arose again.
"We wish to emphasize that
the faculty resolution (calling
for no disciplinary action)
speaks of demonstrations 'to
date,' " the statement said. "Ac
cordingly, we understand the
faculty to support the view of
the president that future dis
ruptions will not be tolerated.
"It is the intention of the pres
ident to deal with any such dis
ruptions promptly and firmly."
If those who spoke in White
Plaza yesterday have their way,
such "disruptions" may not be
far off.
Weissman defended the sev
en students who had been
threatened with suspension.
"There should be no academic
punishment for non-academic
causes," he said.
Many students in the front of
his audience gave him a stand
ing ovation at the end of his
speech, but others in the rear
did "not applaud.
Weissman noted that he knew
he could not get major support
for his demands now, "but we
should talk about them for the
next year or two. Those most
directly affected by the rules
should make the rules."
Also at the rally, Marshall dis
cussed the three types of power
which exist at Stanford: the
legal power, which resides in the
trustees; real power, which is
partly held by the faculty; and
residual power, which the stu
dents used when they staged
the sit-in.

He noted that, when employed,
residual power can work, "but
you can't get away with it very
often. You can't have the reality
of power, but you can share it
with the faculty."
Haight, in assaulting the
Cl 5 plans, said the change
only "keeps the status quo."
"We're still not equal, just
like the black people," he con
tinued. "We will get our kind
of power in rational discussions

as equals, or else it's the
streets."
He received a standing ova
tion.
Weissman, in commenting on
the suspensions, said that if a
rapist or arsonist was not likely
to commit this crime on campus
and was a straight-A stu ent,
he should be allowed to stay.
"Suspending for anything other
than course work cannot be
allowed," he said.

CONFRONTATION POLITICS — Former FSfaleader Steve Weiss
man urges students to use their experience from this week's demon
stration in their future demands.
President J. E. Wallace Ster
ling and Provost Richard Lyman
last night approved the recom
mendations of the Academic Sen
ate for a new judicial system.
Their statement came seven
hours after the proposals, work
ed out by the Committee of 15,
were blasted as incomplete by
some student leaders at a White
Plaza noon rally attended by
about 900 students.
The proposed changes call for
increased student involvement in
the making and enforcement of
campus rules, but provide for a
(faculty majority on separate
committees for these two areas.
Sterling and Lyman said they
deferred to the faculty recom
mendation that "no action be
taken by the University to im
pose penalties on students" for
the recent Old Union sit-in.
The administrators called
for student and faculty refer
enda on the proposals as soon
as possible.
At the rally, many of the lead
ers of the Old Union sit-in, which
ended Wednesday night, com
plained about the faculty major
ities and the lack of an appeal
system in the Cl 5 plans.
Steve Weissman, former Ber

keley Free Speech Movement
leader, called for contained ap
plication of "confrontation pol
itics" to gain two new goals—
student control of faculty tenure
appointments and presidential
selection.
"We have to take the power
away from the trustees," th?
graduate student in Latin Amer
ican studies said. "We must de
mand not only that students sit
in on the committee for presi
dential selection, but that stu
dents vote in referendum on any
choice of that committee."
"Students need confrontation
politics so they will not be co
opted into the consensus of de
cision making," he added.
Others who criticized the Cl 5
proposals at the rally included
Tim Haight, graduate student in
communications, Peter Dolinger,
graduate student in biological
sciences, and ASSU President
Cesare Massarenti.
But others praised the work.
Hubert Marshall, professor of
political science and CIS chair
man, called the changes "a
major step toward community
government."
The Academic Council, in
urging the changes Wednesday,
had asked for a "prompt and
favorable response" from all seg
ments of the University com
munity.
The demonstrators replied
Wednesday night by ending
their sit-in. And Sterling and
Lyman approved the plans last
night.
In endorsing the change, Ster
ljng recommended that the new
plan "be submitted at the earli
est practicable time to a refer
endum of all students ... all
members of the Academic Coun
cil."
By agreeing to the Academic
Council's proposal, in effect Ster
ling and Lyman agreed to set
aside suspension proposed for
seven students by the Interim
Judicial Body in the wake of
their anti-CIA protest last No
vember, but reserved the right
to appeal the case to the new
board proposed by Cl 5.
Whether they will appeal is
another question. At the noon
rally, Sanford Dorbusch, profes
sor of sociology, he did not

know if Sterling would appeal
the case, "but it would be ex
tremely foolish to open the bag
again."
But Sterling and Lyman
made clear what action they
would take if such a situation
ever arose again.
"We wish to emphasize that
the faculty resolution (calling
for no disciplinary action)
speaks of demonstrations 'to
date,' " the statement said. "Ac
cordingly, we understand the
faculty to support the view of
the president that future dis

plication of "confrontation pol
itics" to gain two new goals—
student control of faculty tenure
appointments and presidential
selection.
"We have to take the power
away from the trustees," th?
graduate student in Latin Amer
ican studies said. "We must de
mand not only that students sit
in on the committee for presi
dential selection, but that stu
dents vote in referendum on any
choice of that committee."
"Students need confrontation
politics so they will not be co
opted into the consensus of de
cision making," he added.
Others who criticized the Cl 5
proposals at the rally included
Tim Haight, graduate student in
communications, Peter Dolinger,
graduate student in biological
sciences, and ASSU President
Cesare Massarenti.
But others praised the work.
Hubert Marshall, professor of
political science and CIS chair
man, called the changes "a
major step toward community
government."
The Academic Council, in
urging the changes Wednesday,
had asked for a "prompt and
favorable response" from all seg
ments of the University com
munity.
The demonstrators replied
Wednesday night by ending
their sit-in. And Sterling and
Lyman approved the plans last
night.
In endorsing the change, Ster
ljng recommended that the new
plan "be submitted at the earli
est practicable time to a refer
endum of all students ... all
members of the Academic Coun
cil."
By agreeing to the Academic
Council's proposal, in effect Ster
ling and Lyman agreed to set
aside suspension proposed for
seven students by the Interim
Judicial Body in the wake of
their anti-CIA protest last No
vember, but reserved the right
to appeal the case to the new
board proposed by Cl 5.
Whether they will appeal is
another question. At the noon
rally, Sanford Dorbusch, profes
sor of sociology, he did not

know if Sterling would appeal
the case, "but it would be ex
tremely foolish to open the bag
again."
But Sterling and Lyman
made clear what action they
would take if such a situation
ever arose again.
"We wish to emphasize that
the faculty resolution (calling
for no disciplinary action)
speaks of demonstrations 'to
date,' " the statement said. "Ac
cordingly, we understand the
faculty to support the view of
the president that future dis
ruptions will not be tolerated.
"It is the intention of the pres
ident to deal with any such dis
ruptions promptly and firmly."
If those who spoke in White
Plaza yesterday have their way,
such "disruptions" may not be
far off.
Weissman defended the sev
en students who had been
threatened with suspension.
"There should be no academic
punishment for non-academic
causes," he said.
Many students in the front of
his audience gave him a stand
ing ovation at the end of his
speech, but others in the rear
did "not applaud.
Weissman noted that he knew
he could not get major support
for his demands now, "but we
should talk about them for the
next year or two. Those most
directly affected by the rules
should make the rules."
Also at the rally, Marshall dis
cussed the three types of power
which exist at Stanford: the
legal power, which resides in the
trustees; real power, which is
partly held by the faculty; and
residual power, which the stu
dents used when they staged
the sit-in.

He noted that, when employed,
residual power can work, "but
you can't get away with it very
often. You can't have the reality
of power, but you can share it
with the faculty."
Haight, in assaulting the
Cl 5 plans, said the change
only "keeps the status quo."
"We're still not equal, just
like the black people," he con
tinued. "We will get our kind
of power in rational discussions

as equals, or else it's the
streets."
He received a standing ova
tion.
Weissman, in commenting on
the suspensions, said that if a
rapist or arsonist was not likely
to commit this crime on campus
and was a straight-A stu ent,
he should be allowed to stay.
"Suspending for anything other
than course work cannot be
allowed," he said.

CONFRONTATION POLITICS — Former FSfaleader Steve Weiss
man urges students to use their experience from this week's demon
stration in their future demands.
President J. E. Wallace Ster
ling and Provost Richard Lyman
last night approved the recom
mendations of the Academic Sen
ate for a new judicial system.
Their statement came seven
hours after the proposals, work
ed out by the Committee of 15,
were blasted as incomplete by
some student leaders at a White
Plaza noon rally attended by
about 900 students.
The proposed changes call for
increased student involvement in
the making and enforcement of
campus rules, but provide for a
(faculty majority on separate
committees for these two areas.
Sterling and Lyman said they
deferred to the faculty recom
mendation that "no action be
taken by the University to im
pose penalties on students" for
the recent Old Union sit-in.
The administrators called
for student and faculty refer
enda on the proposals as soon
as possible.
At the rally, many of the lead
ers of the Old Union sit-in, which
ended Wednesday night, com
plained about the faculty major
ities and the lack of an appeal
system in the Cl 5 plans.
