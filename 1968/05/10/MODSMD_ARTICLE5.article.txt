# The 						Sterling-Lyman Statement
## 
### 
The Academic Council has adopted a number of resolutions ad
dressed to the current controversy. The President and his staff
have given careful consideration to these recommendations. We
have serious misgivings about the wisdom of some of them. We
nevertheless accept those recommendations and commit ourselves
to their implementation.
The establishment of new legislative and judicial structures
in the area of student conduct is of central importance to the fu
ture of this institution. The Academic Council has endorsed In
principle the proposals which were adopted unanimously by the
tripartite Committee of 15 on May 8. We hereby join in that en
dorsement. The Council urged prompt and favorable action on the
plan of the Committee of 15 by all constituencies. It is therecom
mendation of the President that the plan be submitted at the
earliest practicable time to a referendum of all students and to
a referendum of all members of the Academic Council.
The Council recommended that no action be taken by the Univer
sity to impose penalties on students because of their participation
in the demonstrations and sit-in at the Old Union prior to Wed
nesday evening, May 8. We defer to that faculty recommendation.
We wish to emphasize that the faculty resolution speaks of dem
onstrations "to date" and accordingly we understand the faculty
to support the view of the President that future disruptions will
not be tolerated. It is the intention of the President to deal with any
such disruptions promptly and firmly.
It is our hope and expectation that all segments of the Univer
sity will join in the task of improving Stanford through those
deliberative proccesses that should characterize a University com
munity.
