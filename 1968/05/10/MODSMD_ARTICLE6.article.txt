Way back behind the women's
gym fields there is a pleasant
old two-story building hidden
from the rest of the campus be
hind a screen of trees.
This laboratory is backed by
ten acres of experimental gar
dens, planting plots, and green
houses.
Here in the Carnegie Institu
tion's own building, but on
leased ground — Stanford re
ceives $95 per year—a staff of
more than 20 researchers and
technicians studies problems of
photosnthesis, plant biology, and
the effects of environment on
plant development.
Photosynthesis, the process all
green plants use to build life
giving sugars from water and
carbon dioxide by trapping the

sun's energy for power, is still
little known in its basic princi
ples.
The Carnegie photosynthesis
research team presently works
on segments of the whole pro
cess. The lab was started 39
years ago.
"Studies on the participation
of various pigments in photo
synthesis are the major con
cerns of the team," says C. Stacy
French, the Carnegie lab's di
rector.
"The first steps in the "assem
bly line" of the photosynthesis
process—one of them is the way
pigment complexes capture the
energy of sunlight—are under
study now," David C. Fork, one
of the scientists, said.
In the last years two separate
photochemical steps in the elec

tron transport chain of the
photochemical process have
been recognized rather than a
single light-driven reaction.
A ierlsg of different chloro
phylls Was found to part in
photosynthesis J different forms
of one pigment type were dis
covered.
Although m&hy other contri
butions to these problems were
made by researchers all over
the world, numerous puzzles re
main unsolved.
There is, for example, the de
termination of the proportions
of light that are absorbed by dif
ferent forms of chlorophyll, or
the investigation of pigments
which control the pathways of
biochemical metabolism, says
Fork.
