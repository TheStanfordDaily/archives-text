## Blooming Research 
### FRIEDRICH ABEL 
Way back behind the women's
gym fields there is a pleasant
old two-story building hidden
from the rest of the campus be
hind a screen of trees.
This laboratory is backed by
ten acres of experimental gar
dens, planting plots, and green
houses.
Here in the Carnegie Institu
tion's own building, but on
leased ground — Stanford re
ceives $95 per year—a staff of
more than 20 researchers and
technicians studies problems of
photosnthesis, plant biology, and
the effects of environment on
plant development.
Photosynthesis, the process all
green plants use to build life
giving sugars from water and
carbon dioxide by trapping the

sun's energy for power, is still
little known in its basic princi
ples.
The Carnegie photosynthesis
research team presently works
on segments of the whole pro
cess. The lab was started 39
years ago.
"Studies on the participation
of various pigments in photo
synthesis are the major con
cerns of the team," says C. Stacy
French, the Carnegie lab's di
rector.
"The first steps in the "assem
bly line" of the photosynthesis
process—one of them is the way
pigment complexes capture the
energy of sunlight—are under
study now," David C. Fork, one
of the scientists, said.
In the last years two separate
photochemical steps in the elec

tron transport chain of the
photochemical process have
been recognized rather than a
single light-driven reaction.
A ierlsg of different chloro
phylls Was found to part in
photosynthesis J different forms
of one pigment type were dis
covered.
Although m&hy other contri
butions to these problems were
made by researchers all over
the world, numerous puzzles re
main unsolved.
There is, for example, the de
termination of the proportions
of light that are absorbed by dif
ferent forms of chlorophyll, or
the investigation of pigments
which control the pathways of
biochemical metabolism, says
Fork.
Based on the present know
ledge, Fork is trying to arrange
the steps of the elctron trans
port chain in the photosynthesis
process into a logical order.
Fork aind Jan Amesz are also
studying the energy-transfer
system between submicroscopic
packages of pigments and en
zymes that constitute the photo
synthetic units.
About 20 years ago the Car
negie scientists made an import
ant discovery. In studying the
metabolism and the chemistry of
microscopic single-celled algae
the researchers learned how to
control the algae's environment
to increase their fat content
from five up to 80 per cent.
Then it seemed that food pro
duction from algae on an in
dustrial scale could become prac
tically feasible within a few de
cades. Algae diets for asronauts,
algae soup, and algae cookies
were talked about.
But farming algae ponds for
human food, attemtped by the
Japanese, proved unsuccessful
"because of economic reasons,"
says French.
However, the practical appli
cation of their findings has nev
er been the concern of the Car
negie staff. "We are just inter
ested in knowledge," says Fork.
Dramatic breakthroughs? Ev
ery step forward in obtaining
new knowledge shows more and
more complex problems, says
Fork.
There is no foreseeable end to
their work, he says. The life
process of plants will remain
among the world's great mys
teries for many more years.
Plant genetics is the second
imoprtant subject of the Insti
tution's Stanford department.
The lab maintains two field
research stations for these stu
dies: one near Camp Mather at
an altitude of 4600 feet in Tuol
umne county, and the other at
Timberline, in the Harvey Mon
roe Hall Natural Area, Mono
county, at 10,000 feet.
At the field stations, and in
the Carnegie greenhouses at
Stanford, researchers headed by

William Hlesey grow colonies of
plants, breed them with each
other, and test the effects of
varying environment.
"Why do plants survive in one
climate in contrast to another?"
is one of the questions his group
tries to answer, Hiesey says.
They found, for example, that
high altitude plants refuse to
grow at sea level, or that vary
ing concentrations of carbon di
oxide change growth patterns.
A surprising discovery was
made two years ago: the
amount of oxygen present in
normal air depresses the photo
synthetic rate to about 30 per
cent of that in oxygen free air,
Hiesey says.
The academic ties between the
Stanford Carnegie department
and Stanford University have
never been very close in the
past.
In 1928, when the laboratory
was built, the Institution was at
tracted by Stanford's climate,
soil characteristics, altitude
(about sea level), and academic
area. Stanford welcomed an In
stitute of high reputation on its
ground.
Although three Carnegie re
searchers—French, Hiesey, and
Clause n—are Professors by
Courtesy at Stanford's depart
ment of biological sciences, this
status involves only very few
contacts between the institution
and Stanford.
"Carnegie and Stanford are
linked by individual private re
lationships, but isolated as re
search groups," says Professor
Richard Holm of the biology de
partment. There had been point
staff meetings about ten years
ago, but they proved largely
social, Holm says.
This situation will change
very soon, both Hiesey and
Holm emphasize.
Just this year concurrent in
terests have developed between
the bio department and the Car
negie department, Holm says.
"Any relationship to Carnegie
in photosynthesis or experiment
al taxonomy depend on our ad
ditions to the staff," he said.

And such additions of botanic
ally oriented researchers will be
made this summer.
This development will lead
not only to "increased use of
Carnegie's physical facilities, but
also to a closer cooperation with
the Carnegie team." Holm says.
Interested biology graduate
students will get opportunities
to do research work in photosyn
thesis and plant biology in co
operation with the Carnegie In
stitution, he says.
The first sign of the new era
between Stanford University
and the Carnegie Institution is
a spring quarter course in the
biology department, Biology 160,
called Advanced Population Bi
ology. The course consists of a
series of lectures on evolution
ary studies of plants.
The course program reads,
among other things, lectures by
William Hiesey, Malcolm Nobs,
OUe Bjorkmann of the Carnegie
Laboratories.
