kissing booths, color televisions,
and a carnival all will be part of
this year's Con-Home Week set
for May 11th to 19th. The pur
pose of the week's events is to
raise funds for the Stanford
Children's Convalescent Hospi
tal.
The week will begin tomorrow
with the firing of the starting
pistol for the third annual twen
ty-five mile Wilbur Bicycle Race.
Subsequent events will in
clude a Brasil '66 concert Satur
day at 2 p.m. in Frost Amphi
theater, a Con-Home King and

Queen contest, a Hydrafollies
show on Lake Lag and a carni
val with over eighteen rides.
The Convalescent Hospital
counts heavily on donations. Con-
Home Week originated because
Stanford students wanted to play
an active role in sustaining the
work of the hospital.
Any campus group can enter
the bike race which will begin
in front of Wilbur at 1:30 n.m.
on Saturday. Each five member
team must pay a $15 entrance
fee. Groups can enter additional
teams for $10 each.
Sergio Mendes and Brasil '66
will appear in concert this Sun

day at 2 p.m. in Frost Amphi
theater. Accompanying him will
be comedian Frank Welker and
Flamenco guitarist Peter Evans.
During the past year Brasil
'66 has emerged as the top Latin
pop group in the music field.
They have continously attracted
large crowds from college cam
puses to night clubs.
Starting on Monday and con
tinuing through Friday will be
balloting for the Con-Home King
and Queen contest. Anyone can
be nominated for twenty-five
cents. Votes cost one penny and
negative votes will be sold for
three cents. Last year Delta Chi's

dog Oscar was elected King.
The carnival is expected to
be the largest money-making
event of the entire week. Cam
pus living groups will run
booths alongside eighteen adult
rides.
The carnival will be held be
hind Saks Fifth Avenue, near
the Stanford Shopping Center,
next Thursday, Friday, Satur
day and Sunday.
The Rhythm Method, a rock
band, will provide entertainment
at the carnival next Friday
night. Also to be featured are

cake tosses and dart balloons.
Throughout all of next week
living groups and clubs will be
competing to raise mon«y for
Con-Home. The group that rAises
the most will receive a free color
television set.
On Saturday, May 18, the an
nual Hydrafollies show will be
