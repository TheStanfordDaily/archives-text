Some of the simplest facts of life tend to be forgotten. Each one of us
has had two parents, at least on the night of our conception. Our very ex
istence bears witness to the fact that one man and one woman had sexual
intercourse together at least once under some set of circumstances. And,
every one of us has spent 5 to 9 months In a mother s womb so we enter
the world preconditioned by that environment.
Every child receives 50 % of his genetic inheritance from his father, and
50% from his mother. In addition our childhood interactions with both
parents have given us an additional psychological and spiritual heritage.
Because we have received from both parents, we are actually both male and
female in the same person, though one sex dominates.
In the process of growing up males tend to repress Into the unconscious
those characteristics which they believe constitute femaleness. Likewise girls
tend to deny the character traits such as dominance and assertiveness which
we tend to think of as maleness. Common sexual hang ups, which include
masturbation, pre-marital sex, extra-marital sex and homosexuality are all
internal self-centered sexual patterns in which an individual's internal male
and female contrasexual personality components remain unintegrated and at
odds with each other.
By nature human beings tend to be highly self-centered, sexually as well
as any other way. Jesus Christ, the God of the Bible solves the problem of
our inverted sexuality by transforming people from the inside out. In the
Bible the word "know" is used to describe sexual intercourse between
persons. The same word is also used of man's relationship with God. "This
is eternal life," Jesus Christ prayed to the Father, "That men might knew
Thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent." To know
God is to have deep, personal spiritual intercourse with Him. This is a pre
requisite to true human sexuality which is that exciting and unlimited adven
ture of love between man and wife in marriage.
The Bible further says that "In Christ there is neither male or female.''
When Jesus Christ enters a person's life He does so in order to restore the
repressed components of the personality bringing a new unified quality of
life which might properly be called super-sex. In the broadest sense maleness
as the Bible views it might be considered as giving love and femaleness as
receiving love from another.
So in light of what the Bible soys about life and sex, the question might
be put, Are you living the real thing, or are you content with the counterfeit?
God Is love, you know.
