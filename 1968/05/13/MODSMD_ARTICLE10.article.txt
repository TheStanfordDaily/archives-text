# Madness At Midnight
## A 						Week That Wasn't 
### Phil Taubman 
Nearly everyone at Stanford
blew his mind last week.
The administration, which
prides itself on reason, got so
committed to its reasoning it
didn't stop to examine the facts
or try to appreciate opposing
points of view.
The students sitting-in became
so enamored of their power,
they failed to perceive that with
drawal after a certain point
would help rather than hinder
their cause.
The students opposing the
sit-in found a leader who led
so forcefully he lost all his fol
lowers and almost choked him
self on Robert's rules.
And the faculty who voted
against that resolution that fin
ally passed either were com
pletely out of touch with the
situation or else felt the time
had arrived for a moral stand
come hell or high water, and
they might have gotten both if
their side had won.
Worth Trying Again
Emotion is a dangerous thing,
and Stanford was seething with
emotion last week. All sides
Seemed intrasigent to the nth
power. Yet somehow it all ended
peacefully and surely, some stu
dents think it's worth trying
again.
They feel they "won." It

worked, all right. The demands
were essentially met and there
is a new committment to deal
ing with problems on campus.
There is a new community at
Stanford and an increased con
sciousness. Plus more power for
the students.
I love it. I dig it. But this
place is a god damn mess today.
The faculty is split down the
middle, the basically liberal ad
ministration suddenly finds it
self in an alliance with many
conservative faculty members.
No One Wins
And the students aren't much
better off. If the demonstration
had continued the people sit
ting-in might have found them
selves being physically evicted
by a vigilante group of fratern
ity men. Wonderful community.
The administration was hu
miliated at the Academic Coun
cil meeting. Maybe they were
wrong, but with another admin
istration we might have had
half a dozen dead bodies out by
the union fountain. Poor Pro
vost Lyman; who would have
imagined two weeks ago he
would be lined up with 18 pro
fessors from the Business
School on a vote?
About the democracy the dem
onstrators prided themselves on.

It was excellent, but there was
more than one time when Steve
Weissman ran circles around
them as chairman.
And there in the middle of
the whole mess was Vicky
Drake running aroung campus
not only topless at chest level,
but also from the neck up. I
didn't see her getting much pub
licity for her ideas. But then,
she got votes, and she got
plenty of them even as students
supposedly had their finest hour
of commitment in in the Old
Union. A paradox?
Madness Everywhere
Unpredictable. That's the only
word for the week. Frightening.
It also fits.
I never felt or saw Stanford
the way I did last week. I
almost felt lost. I saw rational
people acting mad. I saw com
munication end. I agreed and
disagreed with the sit-in. I felt
sorry for the administration,
and incensed that they were so
slow to see realities.
You must wonder what the
hell happened to me.
It's simple. I got no sleep. I
saw everything that happened.
With some sleep I'll be O.K.
You know how it is.
Think this article is mad?
Try to remember last week.

prides itself on reason, got so
committed to its reasoning it
didn't stop to examine the facts
or try to appreciate opposing
points of view.
The students sitting-in became
so enamored of their power,
they failed to perceive that with
drawal after a certain point
would help rather than hinder
their cause.
The students opposing the
sit-in found a leader who led
so forcefully he lost all his fol
lowers and almost choked him
self on Robert's rules.
And the faculty who voted
against that resolution that fin
ally passed either were com
pletely out of touch with the
situation or else felt the time
had arrived for a moral stand
come hell or high water, and
they might have gotten both if
their side had won.
Worth Trying Again
Emotion is a dangerous thing,
and Stanford was seething with
emotion last week. All sides
Seemed intrasigent to the nth
power. Yet somehow it all ended
peacefully and surely, some stu
dents think it's worth trying
again.
They feel they "won." It

worked, all right. The demands
were essentially met and there
is a new committment to deal
ing with problems on campus.
There is a new community at
Stanford and an increased con
sciousness. Plus more power for
the students.
I love it. I dig it. But this
place is a god damn mess today.
The faculty is split down the
middle, the basically liberal ad
ministration suddenly finds it
self in an alliance with many
conservative faculty members.
No One Wins
And the students aren't much
better off. If the demonstration
had continued the people sit
ting-in might have found them
selves being physically evicted
by a vigilante group of fratern
ity men. Wonderful community.
The administration was hu
miliated at the Academic Coun
cil meeting. Maybe they were
wrong, but with another admin
istration we might have had
half a dozen dead bodies out by
the union fountain. Poor Pro
vost Lyman; who would have
imagined two weeks ago he
would be lined up with 18 pro
fessors from the Business
School on a vote?
About the democracy the dem
onstrators prided themselves on.

It was excellent, but there was
more than one time when Steve
Weissman ran circles around
them as chairman.
And there in the middle of
the whole mess was Vicky
Drake running aroung campus
not only topless at chest level,
but also from the neck up. I
didn't see her getting much pub
licity for her ideas. But then,
she got votes, and she got
plenty of them even as students
supposedly had their finest hour
of commitment in in the Old
Union. A paradox?
Madness Everywhere
Unpredictable. That's the only
word for the week. Frightening.
It also fits.
I never felt or saw Stanford
the way I did last week. I
almost felt lost. I saw rational
people acting mad. I saw com
munication end. I agreed and
disagreed with the sit-in. I felt
sorry for the administration,
and incensed that they were so
slow to see realities.
You must wonder what the
hell happened to me.
It's simple. I got no sleep. I
saw everything that happened.
With some sleep I'll be O.K.
You know how it is.
Think this article is mad?
Try to remember last week.
