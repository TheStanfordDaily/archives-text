# The 						Washington Merry-Go-Round
## Averell Harriman Is Skilled Diplomat 
### Drew Pearson 
Averell Harriman has under
taken a good many delicate dip
lomatic missions for a good
many Presidents. Whenever he
has taken a trip for President
Johnson, LB J has told him:
"You know how to do it. Go
ahead and do it your way."
Those are more or less Am
bassador Harriman's instruc
tions as he undertakes the very
difficult truce talks with North
Vietnam. He knows what the
President wants, and it will be
up to him to decide on the tac
tics and the means of reaching
that goal—peace.
Harriman started his govern
ment career as part of the New
Deal's NRA, then served as an
adviser to Harry Hopkins, who
in turn was the intimate con
fidant of Franklin Roosevelt;
then became Ambassador to
Great Britain, Ambassador to
Russia, Ambassador for the ad
ministration of the Marshall
Plan, Secretary of Commerce,
Governor of New York, and fi
nally, under Kennedy, became

Deputy Under Secretary of
State.
After John F. Kennedy en
tered the White House, Harri
man was made Deputy Under
Secretary of State with unde
fined duties. Kennedy thought
he ought to have some kind of
job but didn't know what he
should do. Harriman became
sort of a fifth wheel.
Finally he was given the
toughest diplomatic job facing
the administration—negotiating
an agreement with the Soviet
Union over Laos. The United
States, under the Dulles broth
ers in the Eisenhower Adminis
tration, had mussed up the Lao
tian situation to a point where
it was near chaos. Allen Dulles,
then in charge of the CIA, had
ousted Prince Souvanna Phou
ma, replacing him with strong
man Phoumi Nosavan, only to
find that the ClA's man could
not run the country.
Finally Harriman, given the
tough job of making Laos vi
able, restored Prince Souvanna
Phouma—with the blessing of

the Russians and the Prince has
been doing a good job ever
since. He has actually let Ameri
can planes bomb parts of Laos
in order to stop North Vietnam
from shipping men and supplies
through Laotian territory.
He Knew Khrushchev
The secret of Harriman's suc
cess, in part, was winning the
confidence of Premier Khrush
chev, whom he had known in
Moscow some years before.
Later Kennedy put Harriman in
charge of the Test Ban Treaty
negotiations, where he did a
masterful job of signing, along
with Khrushchev, one of the
most important treaties of this
decade, banning all except un
derground nuclear tests.
Since then Harriman has lost
his status as a fifth wheel. He
hasbeen a vital cog in the State
Department, very much relied
upon.
Factors For Truce
Another crisis on which Av
erell was consulted was that
which developed over the plac
ing of Russian missiles in Cuba.

He recommended to President
Kennedy: "We must give
Khrushchev a way of saving
face. Agree to take the Jupiter
missiles out of Turkey and
Italy. They are no good any
way, and they're just as close
to Russia as Cuba is to us."
Kennedy followed his advice.
Harriman has been giving
careful thought to his present
assignment. In preparation for
the truce talks with the North
Vietnamese, Harriman has stu
died what happened in North
Korea. The Korean truce talks
were drawn out for two years
—chiefly because of two factors.
One was the fact that Truman
did not want to force the com
munist prisoners to go home
because he knew what happened
to the Russian prisoners when
they were returned. Some of
them jumped over the side of
the ship rather than go home.
He was afraid communist pris
oners would be tortured or ex
ecuted on their return.
The other delaying factor was
because the American military

did not want to follow the 38th
Parallel as the boundary be
tween North and South Korea.
They occupied some mountains
a little to the north of the 38th
Parallel, and wanted to keep is
as easier to defend.
This time, however, the situ
ation is less complicated. The
United States now has about
8,000 North Vietnamese prison
ers, and North Vietnam has only
about 300 American pilots. Thus
an exchange should be fairly
simple. Nevertheless, Harriman
is reconciled to long drawn-out
talks in Paris before he finally
achieves peace.
