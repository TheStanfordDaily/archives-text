## Meaning Of Faculty Vote Clarified 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Wo are among those who
voted affirmatively on the reso
lutions passed at the last faculty
meeting. We are disturbed by
two inferences that some have
drawn from our vote:
1. At no point did we intend
our action as a vote of "no con
fidence" in the administration.
We expressed a difference of
opinion—a very deep difference
—but we believe it to be the
essence of the democratic pro
cess that reasonable men may

disagreen on the next one. Con
sequently we reaffirm our full
confidence in President Sterling,
Provost Lyman, Vice-Provost
Packer, and other administra
tion officials with whom on this
occasion we may have differed,
and we look forward to working
under their leadership in build
ing Stanford's future.
2. At no point did we intend
our action as an encouragement
to sit-ins or civil disobediences.
These do not seem to us the ap
propriate methods for determ
ining university policy, nor do
they create the kind of atmo>
phere conducive to fruitful dia
logue and real learning, and
they should not be contemplated
except in the most extreme cir
cumstances when all other
means of communication have
clearly broken down. We wish
to preclude such a situation ever
arising at Stanford, and we
therefore affirm our strong de
sire to find more creative means
through which students and fac
ulty can share appropriately in
decisions about our life together.

Repeat Third Demand
Editor, The Dally:
We, whose suspensions from
Stanford University were recom
mended by the IJB, wish to ex
press our gratitude to the 284
faculty members who stood up
assertively for the rights of the
faculty.
We believe that the faculty
has taken a courageous step in
the direction of bringing control
of Stanford to the academic
community. It is now imme
diately necessary that the stu
dent body act in a similar way.
There can be no legitimate

judicial procedure that does not
afford students the right to reg
ulate the behavior of students.
There can be no legitimate judi
cial procedure that places aca
demic penalties on students for
their behavior in non-academic
areas.
If there is to be an appeals
board consisting of faculty and
students, the faculty should be
wholly selected by the Academic
Senate and the students wholly
selected by student government
or by referendum. And appeal
must be only by the defendants
(i.e. no double jeopardy).
This judicial formula is the
essence of the third demand of
the sit-in. It was proposed by
student government leaders Win
stein and Masserenti.
Unless these changes are in
corporated into the Cl 5 formula
it will be impossible for us to
participate in the new legal sys
tem. We wish to make this posi
tion clear now in the event that
further political prosecutions
should arise.
Concerning the CIA demon
stration case, we feel quite cer
tain that Dr. Sterling under
stands the intention of the fac
ulty decision and we believe that
1 h© will act on that intention.

Don't Ignore Personal
Side Of Recent Crisis
Editor, The Daily:
Your brief baroque and some
what bombastic editorial of last
Friday (May 10) called "Sunrise"
suggests that Stanford has been
changed. You speak of a "flashy
transformation" and I wonder if
the expression doesn't give away
a certain epic longing which has
characterized much of the recent
crisis. It is this glibe histrionic
note that perhaps obscures much
that is personally at stake.
A lecturer told his large class
on Friday that few student re
alized what it may have meant
to many present at the Academic
Council meeting to have to re

spond in a roll call vote on this
issue. He suggested that many
friendships will be affected and
that both for those who as ten
ured members will remain at
Stanford for some time to come
and for those without tenure
(whose own futures often de
pend on what their colleagues
think of them) the consequences
of where they stood on this
issue may be felt long after most
students here have left. Natur
ally one hopes that an indivi
dual's feelings on a particular
issue (inadequately expressed in
a Yes or No vote) are not enough
to cost him friendships and re
spect. But, it was suggested,
the issue was tied to many sen
sitive philosophic attitudes, and
so how a member voted can't
help but have these other effects.
I have paraphrased what was
a very moving statement be
cause it is an aspect of the crisis
that has been ignored. When you
write "at any moment power can
flash to the surface" you seem
to be describing a pyrotechnical
display rather than assessing
what may be the personal con
sequences to many different
kinds of people in this commu
nity.
You know, speaking of your
baroque language, maybe you
should re-read Paradise Lost; it's
all about disobedience and pow
er struggles but somehow when
Milton writes in effect, "we are
not the same," as you do in Fri
day's editorial, he is weighing
the loss which you don't seem to
consider.

ISot All Faculty Seated
On Academic Council
Editor, The Dally:
Last Wednesday the Academic
Council met to debate an issue
of great importance to the Stan
form Community. Unfortunately
approximately one out of every
four members of the Stanford
faculty was prohibited from at

tending this meeting. The reason
for this is quit simple. The Aca
demic Council is composed of
Assistant, Associate and Full
Professors plus six staff person
nel. This means that about 25
per cent of the Stanford faculty
is excluded from this body. This
disenfranchised group is com
posed of Visiting Faculty, Act
ing Assistant Professor, In
structors, Lecturers, and Acting
Instructors.
The Stanford University Fac
ulty/Staff Directory 1967-68 in
its statistical summary lists 934
Faculty members of the Aca
demic Council and 292 "Other
teaching personnel", who are not
members. However in a page by
page chcck of the Directory I
found 328 Faculty members list
ed who are not represented on
the Academic Council. . . .
It should be pointed out that
while all students, undergradu
ate and graduate alike may vote
for LASSU, only some mem
bers of the Faculty are, as Aca
demic Council members, eligible
to vote. It is time that this
discriminatory practice was end
ed!
