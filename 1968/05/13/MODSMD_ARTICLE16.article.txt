Stanford is sputtering through
the first round of open conflict
over student rights and powers
in the university. But the judi
cial dispute is trivial if consid
ered as an isolated issue. Stan
ford's administration, led by a
wizened patriarch and backed
by arch-conservative trustees,
has not given an inch on the
fundamental question of student

power.
Let's talk about the first next
time. It must bring a decisive
student victory that will make
further disruptions unneces
sary.
All it takes is planning. Here
is a sketch of how the revolu
tion might be won at Stanford
next year:
Oct. 4, 1968 — A diverse group

of students organize the Stan
ford Student Union (SSU). They
adopt a clear philosophy of the
role of students and faculty in
the university and dealings of
the university with the rest of
society. Rejecting leftist Idiosyn
crasies they agree on these long
range objectives: (1) indepen
dence for student government,
(2) abdication of a large mea
sure of authority by the Board
of Trustees, and (3) creation of
a faculty-student committee to
decide university policies.
Oct. 11 — SSU, now consist
ing of a core of 40 students to
tal'y commited to the Union's
goals, forms task forces:
1. To infiltrate the Stanford
Daily and secure control of this
vital propaganda medium.
2. To plan seizure of a univer
sity building.
3. To recruit SSU cadres in
every university residence and
graduate department.
4. To establish close liaison
with leftist faculty in order to
increase friction between fac
ulty and administration.
Nov. 4 — To raise student and
faculty expectations, SSU pro
claims "New Stanford Week," a
sates of rallies and lectures on
the history of reform at Stan
ford, our subjugation of the hu
manities to technology, the ab
solute power of the trustees,
and Stanford's ties to the De
fense Department.
Nov. 6 — SSU invites the trus
tees to appear at a White Plaza
rally to justify their interference
in university affairs. Naturally
no trustees appear, so the SSU
releases biographical exposes on
each of the trustees, describing
their political affiliations, per
sonal wealth, and ties with the
military-industrial complex.
Nov. 8 — SSU gives the trus
tees petitions signed by 5,000
students and 100 faculty sup
porting the New Stanford pro
gram. SSU asks trustees to make
their Nov. 21 meeting an open
discussion of New Stanford. The
trustees, incensed by SSU's
earlier slanders, refuse outright.
Nov. 11 — The Daily's edi
torial board, controlled by SSU,
blasts the trustees for refusing
to talk and endorses New Stan
ford. "The trustees' silence is
more proof that they do not un
derstand the spirit of a univer
sity," the Daily says.
Nov. 20 — SSU task force sec
retly chooses Encina Hall as site
of future protest. Unlike the Old
Union, Encina is essential to day
to-day operations of the univer
sity.
Nov. 25 — SSU research urit
discovers attempt of right-wing
trustee to get leftist economics
professor fired. The whole story
is published in the Daily, along
with text of stolen letters. The
faculty is outraged.
Nov. 27 — 40 faculty join SSU.
Nov. 28 — Exploiting this tide
of support, the student legisla
ture, under SSU control, votes
SSU a $20,000 appropriation. The
Dean of Students, under intense
trustee pressure, refuses to al
low the appropriation. The stu
dent legislature immediately dis
bands the ASSU in protest, de
claring SSU to be the legitimate
representative of the Stanford
student body.
Jan. 2, 1969 — Trustees chooso
Arthur Strong, a former Army
general, as new university presi
dent.
Jan. 14 — President Strong
denies SSU the use of student
offices in Tresidder Union. SSU
mobilizes 2,000 students for pro
test rally. SSU agents in crowd
make demands for militant sit
in, but SSU leaders dramatically
reject them as national TV
watches. The press says"the re
straint of student leaders saved
tense Stanford University from
open insurrection," making Pres
ident Strong look like dirt. SSU
increases membership 30 per
cent in next week.
Jan. 17 — SSU member elect

ed editor of the Daily. Hate for
President Strong and trustees
pervade campus. Students are
united, faculty is sympathetic.
SSU leaders decide to provoke
showdown on marijuana.
Jan. 30 — San Francisco
Chronicle is given exclusive
story on marijuana sale and use
in a Stanford dormitory. SSU
mails copies of the story anony
mously to every Stanford alum
nus.
Feb. 12 — SSU sponsors mas
sive pot party in Grove house.
County police, President Strong,
the press, and key alumni are
tipped off in advance. When a
wealthy alumnus tells Strong
he will give no more money if
the party isn't raided, Strong
calls in County police. Fifty
students, including a carefully
selected cross-section of frater
nity men, graduate students, and
women, are arrested, as TV cam
eras record the action.
Feb. 13, 1 p.m. — SSU pre
sents demands to President
Strong, phrased carefully so
they sound reasonable to gen
eral public but are unacceptable
to trustees. Demands are (1) im
mediate amnesty for pot smok
ers, (2) pledge never again to
call in outside police, (3) no
further action against marijuana
and (4) acceptance of these de
mands at noon rally Feb. 14.
Feb. 13, evening — SSU cadre
mobilize students for action If
Strong rejects demands.
Feb. 18, 11 p.m. — Strong,
hearing carefully planted ru
mors, tells police to concentrate
their forces on protecting Old
Union.
Feb. 14, noon — With no ad
ministrators appearing, an im
passioned SSU orator begins to
inflame crowd of 2,000 students.
7 p.m. — With Encina secur
ed, SSU leaders announce that
they will not leave until the
three-point New Stanford pro
gram is adopted, as well as
the marijuana demands.
Feb. 15 — Stanford is para
lyzed. With the controller's of
fice in Encina seized, the univer
sity can neither receive nor pay
out money. Strong accepts a
petition from 400 faculty calling
for acceptance of SSU demands,
but he orders police to seal off
Encina to starve out the demon
strators.
SSU leaders tell press they
will harm nothing inside Encina
unless the police attempt to
eject them. The nation sees on
TV the fastidious student clean
up crews inside Encina, the rig
orous seminars for demonstra
tors, and the poignant fear on
the faces of the young students.
For public relations purposes,
SSU raises a gigantic American
flag from Encina's flag pole,
with a red flag flying under it.
Feb. 18 — Newspapers report
hunger and sickness among the
Encina demonstrators. Dally
prints exposes of how Strong,
when an Army general, once put
12 rebellious privates on short
rations as punishment. Academic
Council calls for Strong's resig
nation.
Feb. 22 — Police foray at back
entrance to Encina is beaten off
by SSU tear gas.
Feb. 28 -- University payday
approaches with controller's of
fice still closed. President Strong
resigns. Board of Trustees votes
acceptance of SSU demands. Ten
conservative trustees resign. The
revolution is won.
OK, gang, that's the script.
You got guts enough to play it?

OK, gang, that's the script.
You got guts enough to play it?
Stanford is sputtering through
the first round of open conflict
over student rights and powers
in the university. But the judi
cial dispute is trivial if consid
ered as an isolated issue. Stan
ford's administration, led by a
wizened patriarch and backed
by arch-conservative trustees,
has not given an inch on the
fundamental question of student

power.
Let's talk about the first next
time. It must bring a decisive
student victory that will make
further disruptions unneces
sary.
All it takes is planning. Here
is a sketch of how the revolu
tion might be won at Stanford
next year:
Oct. 4, 1968 — A diverse group

of students organize the Stan
ford Student Union (SSU). They
adopt a clear philosophy of the
role of students and faculty in
the university and dealings of
the university with the rest of
society. Rejecting leftist Idiosyn
crasies they agree on these long
range objectives: (1) indepen
dence for student government,
(2) abdication of a large mea
sure of authority by the Board
of Trustees, and (3) creation of
a faculty-student committee to
decide university policies.
Oct. 11 — SSU, now consist
ing of a core of 40 students to
tal'y commited to the Union's
goals, forms task forces:
1. To infiltrate the Stanford
Daily and secure control of this
vital propaganda medium.
2. To plan seizure of a univer
sity building.
3. To recruit SSU cadres in
every university residence and
graduate department.
4. To establish close liaison
with leftist faculty in order to
increase friction between fac
ulty and administration.
Nov. 4 — To raise student and
faculty expectations, SSU pro
claims "New Stanford Week," a
sates of rallies and lectures on
the history of reform at Stan
ford, our subjugation of the hu
manities to technology, the ab
solute power of the trustees,
and Stanford's ties to the De
fense Department.
Nov. 6 — SSU invites the trus
tees to appear at a White Plaza
rally to justify their interference
in university affairs. Naturally
no trustees appear, so the SSU
releases biographical exposes on
each of the trustees, describing
their political affiliations, per
sonal wealth, and ties with the
military-industrial complex.
Nov. 8 — SSU gives the trus
tees petitions signed by 5,000
students and 100 faculty sup
porting the New Stanford pro
gram. SSU asks trustees to make
their Nov. 21 meeting an open
discussion of New Stanford. The
trustees, incensed by SSU's
earlier slanders, refuse outright.
Nov. 11 — The Daily's edi
torial board, controlled by SSU,
blasts the trustees for refusing
to talk and endorses New Stan
ford. "The trustees' silence is
more proof that they do not un
derstand the spirit of a univer
sity," the Daily says.
Nov. 20 — SSU task force sec
retly chooses Encina Hall as site
of future protest. Unlike the Old
Union, Encina is essential to day
to-day operations of the univer
sity.
Nov. 25 — SSU research urit
discovers attempt of right-wing
trustee to get leftist economics
professor fired. The whole story
is published in the Daily, along
with text of stolen letters. The
faculty is outraged.
Nov. 27 — 40 faculty join SSU.
Nov. 28 — Exploiting this tide
of support, the student legisla
ture, under SSU control, votes
SSU a $20,000 appropriation. The
Dean of Students, under intense
trustee pressure, refuses to al
low the appropriation. The stu
dent legislature immediately dis
bands the ASSU in protest, de
claring SSU to be the legitimate
representative of the Stanford
student body.
Jan. 2, 1969 — Trustees chooso
Arthur Strong, a former Army
general, as new university presi
dent.
Jan. 14 — President Strong
denies SSU the use of student
offices in Tresidder Union. SSU
mobilizes 2,000 students for pro
test rally. SSU agents in crowd
make demands for militant sit
in, but SSU leaders dramatically
reject them as national TV
watches. The press says"the re
straint of student leaders saved
tense Stanford University from
open insurrection," making Pres
ident Strong look like dirt. SSU
increases membership 30 per
cent in next week.
Jan. 17 — SSU member elect

ed editor of the Daily. Hate for
President Strong and trustees
pervade campus. Students are
united, faculty is sympathetic.
SSU leaders decide to provoke
showdown on marijuana.
Jan. 30 — San Francisco
Chronicle is given exclusive
story on marijuana sale and use
in a Stanford dormitory. SSU
mails copies of the story anony
mously to every Stanford alum
nus.
Feb. 12 — SSU sponsors mas
sive pot party in Grove house.
County police, President Strong,
the press, and key alumni are
tipped off in advance. When a
wealthy alumnus tells Strong
he will give no more money if
the party isn't raided, Strong
calls in County police. Fifty
students, including a carefully
selected cross-section of frater
nity men, graduate students, and
women, are arrested, as TV cam
eras record the action.
Feb. 13, 1 p.m. — SSU pre
sents demands to President
Strong, phrased carefully so
they sound reasonable to gen
eral public but are unacceptable
to trustees. Demands are (1) im
mediate amnesty for pot smok
ers, (2) pledge never again to
call in outside police, (3) no
further action against marijuana
and (4) acceptance of these de
mands at noon rally Feb. 14.
Feb. 13, evening — SSU cadre
mobilize students for action If
Strong rejects demands.
Feb. 18, 11 p.m. — Strong,
hearing carefully planted ru

their forces on protecting Old
Union.
Feb. 14, noon — With no ad

passioned SSU orator begins to
inflame crowd of 2,000 students.
7 p.m. — With Encina secur
ed, SSU leaders announce that
they will not leave until the
three-point New Stanford pro
gram is adopted, as well as
the marijuana demands.
Feb. 15 — Stanford is para
lyzed. With the controller's of
fice in Encina seized, the univer
sity can neither receive nor pay
out money. Strong accepts a
petition from 400 faculty calling
for acceptance of SSU demands,
but he orders police to seal off
Encina to starve out the demon
strators.
SSU leaders tell press they
will harm nothing inside Encina
unless the police attempt to
eject them. The nation sees on
TV the fastidious student clean
up crews inside Encina, the rig
orous seminars for demonstra
tors, and the poignant fear on
the faces of the young students.
For public relations purposes,
SSU raises a gigantic American
flag from Encina's flag pole,
with a red flag flying under it.

Encina to starve out the demon

SSU leaders tell press they

OK, gang, that's the script.
You got guts enough to play it?
Stanford is sputtering through
the first round of open conflict
over student rights and powers
in the university. But the judi
cial dispute is trivial if consid
ered as an isolated issue. Stan
ford's administration, led by a
wizened patriarch and backed
by arch-conservative trustees,
has not given an inch on the
fundamental question of student

power.
Let's talk about the first next
time. It must bring a decisive
student victory that will make
further disruptions unneces
sary.
All it takes is planning. Here
is a sketch of how the revolu
tion might be won at Stanford
next year:
Oct. 4, 1968 — A diverse group

of students organize the Stan
ford Student Union (SSU). They
adopt a clear philosophy of the
role of students and faculty in
the university and dealings of
the university with the rest of
society. Rejecting leftist Idiosyn
crasies they agree on these long
range objectives: (1) indepen
dence for student government,
(2) abdication of a large mea
sure of authority by the Board
of Trustees, and (3) creation of
a faculty-student committee to
decide university policies.
Oct. 11 — SSU, now consist
ing of a core of 40 students to
tal'y commited to the Union's
goals, forms task forces:
1. To infiltrate the Stanford
Daily and secure control of this
vital propaganda medium.
2. To plan seizure of a univer
sity building.
3. To recruit SSU cadres in
every university residence and
graduate department.
4. To establish close liaison
with leftist faculty in order to
increase friction between fac
ulty and administration.
Nov. 4 — To raise student and
faculty expectations, SSU pro
claims "New Stanford Week," a
sates of rallies and lectures on
the history of reform at Stan
ford, our subjugation of the hu
manities to technology, the ab
solute power of the trustees,
and Stanford's ties to the De
fense Department.
Nov. 6 — SSU invites the trus
tees to appear at a White Plaza
rally to justify their interference
in university affairs. Naturally
no trustees appear, so the SSU
releases biographical exposes on
each of the trustees, describing
their political affiliations, per
sonal wealth, and ties with the
military-industrial complex.
Nov. 8 — SSU gives the trus
tees petitions signed by 5,000
students and 100 faculty sup
porting the New Stanford pro

trustees, incensed by SSU's
earlier slanders, refuse outright.
Nov. 11 — The Daily's edi
torial board, controlled by SSU,
blasts the trustees for refusing
to talk and endorses New Stan
ford. "The trustees' silence is
more proof that they do not un
derstand the spirit of a univer
sity," the Daily says.
Nov. 20 — SSU task force sec
retly chooses Encina Hall as site
of future protest. Unlike the Old
Union, Encina is essential to day

trustee to get leftist economics
professor fired. The whole story

Nov. 27 — 40 faculty join SSU.
Nov. 28 — Exploiting this tide
of support, the student legisla
ture, under SSU control, votes
SSU a $20,000 appropriation. The
Dean of Students, under intense
trustee pressure, refuses to al
low the appropriation. The stu
dent legislature immediately dis
bands the ASSU in protest, de
claring SSU to be the legitimate
representative of the Stanford
student body.
Jan. 2, 1969 — Trustees chooso
Arthur Strong, a former Army
general, as new university presi
dent.
Jan. 14 — President Strong

offices in Tresidder Union. SSU
mobilizes 2,000 students for pro
test rally. SSU agents in crowd
make demands for militant sit
in, but SSU leaders dramatically
reject them as national TV
watches. The press says"the re
straint of student leaders saved
tense Stanford University from
open insurrection," making Pres
ident Strong look like dirt. SSU
increases membership 30 per
cent in next week.
Jan. 17 — SSU member elect

ed editor of the Daily. Hate for
President Strong and trustees
pervade campus. Students are
united, faculty is sympathetic.
SSU leaders decide to provoke

sive pot party in Grove house.
County police, President Strong,
the press, and key alumni are

selected cross-section of frater
nity men, graduate students, and
women, are arrested, as TV cam
eras record the action.

sents demands to President

SSU leaders tell press they

OK, gang, that's the script.
You got guts enough to play it?
Stanford is sputtering through
the first round of open conflict
over student rights and powers
in the university. But the judi
cial dispute is trivial if consid
ered as an isolated issue. Stan
ford's administration, led by a
wizened patriarch and backed
by arch-conservative trustees,
has not given an inch on the
fundamental question of student

power.
Let's talk about the first next
time. It must bring a decisive
student victory that will make
further disruptions unneces
sary.
All it takes is planning. Here
is a sketch of how the revolu
tion might be won at Stanford
next year:
Oct. 4, 1968 — A diverse group

of students organize the Stan
ford Student Union (SSU). They
adopt a clear philosophy of the
role of students and faculty in
the university and dealings of
the university with the rest of
society. Rejecting leftist Idiosyn
crasies they agree on these long
range objectives: (1) indepen
dence for student government,
(2) abdication of a large mea
sure of authority by the Board
of Trustees, and (3) creation of
a faculty-student committee to
decide university policies.
Oct. 11 — SSU, now consist
ing of a core of 40 students to
tal'y commited to the Union's
goals, forms task forces:
1. To infiltrate the Stanford
Daily and secure control of this
vital propaganda medium.
2. To plan seizure of a univer
sity building.
3. To recruit SSU cadres in
every university residence and
graduate department.
4. To establish close liaison
with leftist faculty in order to
increase friction between fac
ulty and administration.
Nov. 4 — To raise student and
faculty expectations, SSU pro
claims "New Stanford Week," a
sates of rallies and lectures on
the history of reform at Stan
ford, our subjugation of the hu
manities to technology, the ab
solute power of the trustees,
and Stanford's ties to the De
fense Department.
Nov. 6 — SSU invites the trus
tees to appear at a White Plaza
rally to justify their interference
in university affairs. Naturally
no trustees appear, so the SSU
releases biographical exposes on
each of the trustees, describing
their political affiliations, per
sonal wealth, and ties with the
military-industrial complex.
Nov. 8 — SSU gives the trus
tees petitions signed by 5,000
students and 100 faculty sup
porting the New Stanford pro
gram. SSU asks trustees to make
their Nov. 21 meeting an open
discussion of New Stanford. The
trustees, incensed by SSU's
earlier slanders, refuse outright.
Nov. 11 — The Daily's edi
torial board, controlled by SSU,
blasts the trustees for refusing
to talk and endorses New Stan
ford. "The trustees' silence is
more proof that they do not un
derstand the spirit of a univer
sity," the Daily says.
Nov. 20 — SSU task force sec
retly chooses Encina Hall as site
of future protest. Unlike the Old
Union, Encina is essential to day
to-day operations of the univer
sity.
Nov. 25 — SSU research urit
discovers attempt of right-wing
trustee to get leftist economics
professor fired. The whole story
is published in the Daily, along
with text of stolen letters. The
faculty is outraged.
Nov. 27 — 40 faculty join SSU.
Nov. 28 — Exploiting this tide
of support, the student legisla
ture, under SSU control, votes
SSU a $20,000 appropriation. The
Dean of Students, under intense
trustee pressure, refuses to al
low the appropriation. The stu
dent legislature immediately dis
bands the ASSU in protest, de
claring SSU to be the legitimate
representative of the Stanford
student body.
Jan. 2, 1969 — Trustees chooso
Arthur Strong, a former Army
general, as new university presi
dent.
Jan. 14 — President Strong
denies SSU the use of student
offices in Tresidder Union. SSU
mobilizes 2,000 students for pro
test rally. SSU agents in crowd
make demands for militant sit
in, but SSU leaders dramatically
reject them as national TV
watches. The press says"the re
straint of student leaders saved
tense Stanford University from
open insurrection," making Pres
ident Strong look like dirt. SSU
increases membership 30 per
cent in next week.
Jan. 17 — SSU member elect

ed editor of the Daily. Hate for
President Strong and trustees
pervade campus. Students are
united, faculty is sympathetic.
SSU leaders decide to provoke
showdown on marijuana.
Jan. 30 — San Francisco
Chronicle is given exclusive
story on marijuana sale and use
in a Stanford dormitory. SSU
mails copies of the story anony
mously to every Stanford alum
nus.
Feb. 12 — SSU sponsors mas
sive pot party in Grove house.
County police, President Strong,
the press, and key alumni are
tipped off in advance. When a
wealthy alumnus tells Strong
he will give no more money if
the party isn't raided, Strong
calls in County police. Fifty
students, including a carefully
selected cross-section of frater
nity men, graduate students, and
women, are arrested, as TV cam
eras record the action.
Feb. 13, 1 p.m. — SSU pre
sents demands to President
Strong, phrased carefully so
they sound reasonable to gen
eral public but are unacceptable
to trustees. Demands are (1) im
mediate amnesty for pot smok
ers, (2) pledge never again to
call in outside police, (3) no
further action against marijuana
and (4) acceptance of these de
mands at noon rally Feb. 14.
