# Colby Sets Mark At Fresno Relays
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Saturday began as a beauti
ful day for Stanford at the West
Coast Relays in Fresno.'
The sun was shining, Tom
Colby won the javelin with a
school record of 258'4*4", and
freshman Randy White tied the
Indian record in the 440 yard in
termediate hurdles, tying for
fifth with a time of 52.4.
Then, in the early evening, it
started drizzling, and Stanford's
performances became somewhat
gray, too.
The meet was marked by out
standing performances by Bob
Seagren and Jim Ryun.
Seagren vaulted IT6V4" tor
a new meet record, and then
missed In two attempts to
set a new world record at
ITSYi". Ryun, running the
anchor leg for Kansas in the
two-mile relay, made up 35
yards on Vlllanova'n Dave)
Patrick, but could not over
take him.
Colby's throw was two-and-a
half inches better than his school
mark set two weeks ago at home
against Oregon. It was the best
collegiate mark of the year.
Rick Porter also had a life
time best mark in the Javelin of
207'9".
The only other good perfor
mance for the Indians was In the
440 hurdles, where Tom Kom
mers also turned in his best
time, 53.3.
All of these performances
were in the afternoon. In the
evening, the wind came up, the
rain came down, and the Stan
ford marks deteriorated.
Peter Boyce tied for sixth
in the high Jump, clearing
6'6", but could go no higher.
Dave Harper also cleared this
mark. The event was won by
Ed Hanks of Brlgham Young,
who went over the bar at
810".
Jan Arnold, who set a Cana

dian record in the triple jump
two weeks ago by leaping 51'
BV6", fouled on his first two
qualifying jumps and could
manage only 48'5" on his last
attempt.
He qualified for the finals, but
passed all his leaps because of
the cold wind and a sore foot.
