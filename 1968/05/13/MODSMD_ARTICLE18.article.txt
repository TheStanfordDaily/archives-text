The Stanford lacrosse team
established beyond doubt Satur
day that it is the best team in
the west by whipping the pre
tender Air Force Academy Fal
cons, 8-5.
The Indians gave up control
of the game only in the second
quarter, when the Air Force
windmill offense got three goals
and sent the Falcons Into the
half-time rest with a 3-2 advan
tage.
Stanford roared back and took
complete control with six
straight goals to put the game
out of reach. Once again the
Stanford defense was superb, led
by a masterful performance by
Bill Eakland. Assigned to Air
Force's Ail-American attackman
Russ Voris, Eakland blanketed
him so effectively that Voris
did not get a single goal or as
sist.
For the first time this sea
son, the Indians combined a
really potent pressure attack
with the defense. Mark Teeter
turned a hat-trick and Bob Haw
kins scored two goals, while
George Muser did a good job
as anchorman. The Indians came
within inches from a bigger
route, with four shots off the
pipe.
Stanford jumped on the Air
Force goalie Bill Markham with
out hesitation, as Hawkins took
the face-off and scored with only
32 seconds gone in the game.
They kept the pressure on for
the rest of the quarter, but
could not score.
In the second quarter the In
dians lost their momentum. Rick
Taylor and Phil Pignataro
scored within fifteen seconds of
each other and the Falcons took
a 2-1 lead. But four seconds after
Pignataro scored, Stanford's
Teeter took the ball at the mid
line, faked a pass to George
Muser and spread the three de
fensemen and scored.

With the half almost gone,
Brian Bell scored alone to give
the Falcons the half-time lead.
But that was the end for the
Falcons. Stanford poured In four
goals In the third period. Three
of them were unassisted goals
by Chris Rafferty, Muser and
Teeter, and the last one was an
extra man goal by Hawkins on
an assist from Peter Hovey. Air
Force meanwhile got one lone
goal by Terry Brady.
Teeter blizted the cage once
again in the final period and
Glenn Thomas converted a Haw
kins feed Into a goal to put the
game out of reach.

with the defense. Mark Teeter
turned a hat-trick and Bob Haw
kins scored two goals, while
George Muser did a good job
as anchorman. The Indians came
within inches from a bigger
route, with four shots off the
pipe.
Stanford jumped on the Air
Force goalie Bill Markham with
out hesitation, as Hawkins took
the face-off and scored with only
32 seconds gone in the game.
They kept the pressure on for
the rest of the quarter, but
could not score.
In the second quarter the In
dians lost their momentum. Rick
Taylor and Phil Pignataro
scored within fifteen seconds of
each other and the Falcons took
a 2-1 lead. But four seconds after
Pignataro scored, Stanford's
Teeter took the ball at the mid
line, faked a pass to George
Muser and spread the three de
fensemen and scored.

With the half almost gone,
Brian Bell scored alone to give
the Falcons the half-time lead.
But that was the end for the
Falcons. Stanford poured In four
goals In the third period. Three
of them were unassisted goals
by Chris Rafferty, Muser and
Teeter, and the last one was an
extra man goal by Hawkins on
an assist from Peter Hovey. Air
Force meanwhile got one lone
goal by Terry Brady.
Teeter blizted the cage once
again in the final period and
Glenn Thomas converted a Haw
kins feed Into a goal to put the
game out of reach.
The Stanford lacrosse team
established beyond doubt Satur
day that it is the best team in
the west by whipping the pre
tender Air Force Academy Fal
cons, 8-5.
The Indians gave up control
of the game only in the second
quarter, when the Air Force
windmill offense got three goals
and sent the Falcons Into the
half-time rest with a 3-2 advan
tage.
Stanford roared back and took
complete control with six
straight goals to put the game
out of reach. Once again the
Stanford defense was superb, led
by a masterful performance by
Bill Eakland. Assigned to Air
Force's Ail-American attackman
Russ Voris, Eakland blanketed
him so effectively that Voris
did not get a single goal or as
sist.
For the first time this sea
son, the Indians combined a
really potent pressure attack
with the defense. Mark Teeter
turned a hat-trick and Bob Haw
kins scored two goals, while
George Muser did a good job
as anchorman. The Indians came
within inches from a bigger
route, with four shots off the
pipe.
