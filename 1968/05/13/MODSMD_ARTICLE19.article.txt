# Tribe Hopes Fade As USC Wins 4-3
## 
### GARY CAVALLI 
Stanford's Pacific-8 baseball
hopes received a sharp jolt Fri
day afternoon when league-lead
ing USC rallied in the eighth
inning to upend the Indians 4-3.
The win put the Trojans two
and-a-half games ahead of the
second-place Stanford nine.
Saturday the Tribe rebounded
to sweep a doubleheader from
UCLA, 8-4 and 4-0. Although the
twin win put Stanford (9-3)
solidly in second place ahead of
the Bruins (8-6) and Washing
ton State (8-5), Coach Ray
Young's club has little chance
of catching USC (12-1).
Home runs by Bob Galla
gher and Bob Boone offset a
two-run smash by USCs Bill
Seinsoth, giving the Tribe a
3-2 edge after seven Innings
of play. Outside of Seinsoth's
homer, senior righthander
Harvey Shank had the Tro
jans eating out of his hand.
But shortstop Chuck Williams
booted a grounder off the bat of
Ron Drake in the bottom of the
eighth and Troy had the tying
run on base. Then Trojan hurler
Jim Barr, attempting to sacri
fice Drake along, laid down a
perfect bunt and beat it out.
Pat Kuehner laced a two-run
double to score Drake and Barr,
giving USC the win and possibly
the Pac-8 championship. Kuehn

er's two-bagger was only the
fourth hit off Shank, who ab
sorbed his first league loss after
three straight wins.
Saturday the Indians blend
ed excellent pitching and
timely hitting to crush the
Brains, but It was a day too
late.
Don Rose shutout the Bruins
in the opener for his second
straight whitewash. He blanked
OSU on three hits back on April
29.
Rod Poteete had a tougher
time of it in the nightcap, but
went the distance in Stanford's
8-4 triumph. Two-run homers by
Phil Keller and Bob Edie, plus
a solo shot by Gallagher, pro
vided the winning runs.

Stanford's Pacific-8 baseball
hopes received a sharp jolt Fri
day afternoon when league-lead
ing USC rallied in the eighth
inning to upend the Indians 4-3.
The win put the Trojans two
and-a-half games ahead of the
second-place Stanford nine.
Saturday the Tribe rebounded
to sweep a doubleheader from
UCLA, 8-4 and 4-0. Although the
twin win put Stanford (9-3)
solidly in second place ahead of
the Bruins (8-6) and Washing
ton State (8-5), Coach Ray
Young's club has little chance
of catching USC (12-1).
Home runs by Bob Galla
gher and Bob Boone offset a
two-run smash by USCs Bill
Seinsoth, giving the Tribe a
3-2 edge after seven Innings
of play. Outside of Seinsoth's
homer, senior righthander
Harvey Shank had the Tro
jans eating out of his hand.
But shortstop Chuck Williams
booted a grounder off the bat of
Ron Drake in the bottom of the
eighth and Troy had the tying
run on base. Then Trojan hurler
Jim Barr, attempting to sacri
fice Drake along, laid down a
perfect bunt and beat it out.
Pat Kuehner laced a two-run
double to score Drake and Barr,
giving USC the win and possibly
the Pac-8 championship. Kuehn

er's two-bagger was only the
fourth hit off Shank, who ab
sorbed his first league loss after
three straight wins.
Saturday the Indians blend
ed excellent pitching and
timely hitting to crush the
Brains, but It was a day too
late.
Don Rose shutout the Bruins
in the opener for his second
straight whitewash. He blanked
OSU on three hits back on April
29.
Rod Poteete had a tougher
time of it in the nightcap, but
went the distance in Stanford's
8-4 triumph. Two-run homers by
Phil Keller and Bob Edie, plus
a solo shot by Gallagher, pro
vided the winning runs.
