# Business Conference To View Programs
## 
### JEREMY BAKER 
Action programs designed by
business to alleviate racial prob
lems will be discussed at the
Stanford Graduate School of
Business (GSB) beginning at 9
Wednesday morning.
The GSB Student Association
has announced a conference of
California business leaders and
students concerned with the
racial crisis. The participants
will include men from business,
government, and labor who are
currently engaged in implement
ing programs in employment
and urban renewal. All mem
bers of the Stanford commun
ity are invited to attend.
According to Dennis Hawley,
first year MBA student and one
of the conference organizers,
"the focus of the conference will
be upon understanding and eval
uating existing programs. It is
critically important that busi
ness managers understand the
view point of the black com
munity," stated Hawley, "or
their efforts will only increase
frustration and hostility."
Members of the black com
munity have been invited to
present a critical evaluation of
the efforts on the part of busi
ness, labor and government.
Much of the conference will be
devoted to hearing and discuss
ing these comments.
The conference will begin at
9 in Bishop Auditorium with
keynote speeches by Professor
David Abemethy, professor of
political science at Stanford, and
by Mr. Henry Organ, a leader

of the Mid-Penninsula chapter
of CORE and an employee of
Lockheed.
"Workshops are the heart of
the conference," stated Roger
Coates, business school student
and conference organizer. "Rec
ent events have made the cor
porate executive particularly re
ceptive to new ideas and pro
grams for action in minority
hiring and ghetto investment.
We hope to have a freewheeling,
candid discussion of these ideas
and programs."
Workshops will be held on
Employment and Job Training;
Unions and Compensatory Hir
ing, Law in the Ghetto, Govern
ment-Business Cooperation; and
the Prospects and Possibilities
of Black Power. At each work
shop will be men who have been
active in that area.
Participants in the workshop
on Employment and Job Train
ing will include Mr. Ray Schney
er, Director of Lockheed's Voca
tional Improvement Program;
Mr. Michael Ravizza, Stanford
University Employment Office;
Mr. Leon Woods, Supervisor of
Watts Manufacturing; and Mon
ica Amador, Director Mexican-
American Opportunities Center
in San Jose.
Participants in the union
workshop will be Mr. Ben Good
enough, labor negotiator for the

and Mr. William Chester, re
gional director of the Interna
tional Longshoremen's and
Warehousemen's Union. Other
