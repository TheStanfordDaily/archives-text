# Graduate Years Appraised: Austere, Anxious, Hermitic
## 
### BARRY ASKINAS 
An editorial in the Daily be
moaned the fact that graduate
students at Stanford don't seem
to be involved In the everyday
affairs of the un.versity commu
nity. Said the Dally: "They're
alive and hiding." Why should
this be so? Why have graduate
students withdrawn into their
books and their departments?
If they are to be the priests of
the academy, must they first live
the austere life of a monk?
This withdrawal may be a
condition for their success. Grad
uate students are subject to a

subtle kind of academic pressure
that makes the 18 units life of
an undergraduate seem like
nirvana.
From several points of view,
graduate education in this coun
try is a failure. Graduate pro
grams ultimately grant doctoral
degrees to one-fifth of the Ph.D.
aspirants that grind through
their doors. Stanford may grant
degrees to as many as one-third
of its doctoral students. Clearly,
in comparison with the average
institution, Stanford is doing a
superior job. But what happen
ed to those other two-thirds?

What is it about them, that holds
them back? What is it about
Stanford that won't let them
through?
Potential Loss
Can universities afford to lose
two-thirds or more their poten
tial teachers? Just at Stanford,
the financial waste is in the mil
lions. The university expends on
the average, $120,000 per doc
torate in the humanities, and
$180,000 in the sciences.
For students who don't suc
ceed, it is rarely a question of
intellectual ability. Stanford
simply doesn't accept very many
"poor" students for graduate
work. The university claims to
get only the cream of the stu
dents that have distinguished
themselves as undergraduates.
The explanation must lie else
where.
Until the end of the 19th cen
tury, there were no graduate
schools in this country. Graduate
training was taken, if at all, in
Europe, usually in Germany. It
is not surprising then, that
American graduate institutions
are patterned on a German mod
el. Students did research under
famous professors, tried to sup
port themselves by giving lec
tures, and if lucky were finally
admitted into the small frater
nity of professors. Almost invar
iably students came from the
most affluent segment of society.
Students were very much subject
to the arbitrary whims of their
professors.
American Programs
American programs now differ
in two significant ways. First,
recent massive government and
foundation support for graduate
students (except in the hard-core
humanities) has made it pos
sible for students from all socio
economic classes to attend. Sec
ondy, the fantastic demand for
