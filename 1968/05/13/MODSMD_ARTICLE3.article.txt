# Graduate Years Appraised: Austere, Anxious, Hermitic
## 
### BARRY ASKINAS 
An editorial in the Daily be
moaned the fact that graduate
students at Stanford don't seem
to be involved In the everyday
affairs of the un.versity commu
nity. Said the Dally: "They're
alive and hiding." Why should
this be so? Why have graduate
students withdrawn into their
books and their departments?
If they are to be the priests of
the academy, must they first live
the austere life of a monk?
This withdrawal may be a
condition for their success. Grad
uate students are subject to a

subtle kind of academic pressure
that makes the 18 units life of
an undergraduate seem like
nirvana.
From several points of view,
graduate education in this coun
try is a failure. Graduate pro
grams ultimately grant doctoral
degrees to one-fifth of the Ph.D.
aspirants that grind through
their doors. Stanford may grant
degrees to as many as one-third
of its doctoral students. Clearly,
in comparison with the average
institution, Stanford is doing a
superior job. But what happen
ed to those other two-thirds?

What is it about them, that holds
them back? What is it about
Stanford that won't let them
through?
Potential Loss
Can universities afford to lose
two-thirds or more their poten
tial teachers? Just at Stanford,
the financial waste is in the mil
lions. The university expends on
the average, $120,000 per doc
torate in the humanities, and
$180,000 in the sciences.
For students who don't suc
ceed, it is rarely a question of
intellectual ability. Stanford
simply doesn't accept very many
"poor" students for graduate
work. The university claims to
get only the cream of the stu
dents that have distinguished
themselves as undergraduates.
The explanation must lie else
where.
Until the end of the 19th cen
tury, there were no graduate
schools in this country. Graduate
training was taken, if at all, in
Europe, usually in Germany. It
is not surprising then, that
American graduate institutions
are patterned on a German mod
el. Students did research under
famous professors, tried to sup
port themselves by giving lec
tures, and if lucky were finally
admitted into the small frater
nity of professors. Almost invar
iably students came from the
most affluent segment of society.
Students were very much subject
to the arbitrary whims of their
professors.
American Programs
American programs now differ
in two significant ways. First,
recent massive government and
foundation support for graduate
students (except in the hard-core
humanities) has made it pos
sible for students from all socio
economic classes to attend. Sec
ondy, the fantastic demand for
teachers and researchers has
turned many graduate programs
into mass production programs,
often destroying the sense of
community in the university,
and greatly reducing the oppor
tunity for close student-faculty
interaction. The federal largesse
in the form of grants has turned
some faculty hustlers into ad
ministrators with staffs of grad
uate students working hard on a
small part of the professor's re
search program. This leads, in
evitably, to exploitation of SOME
graduate students by SOME fac
ulty members. What stands be
tween the graduate student and
the sometimes arbitrary or ex
ploitive treatment of a particular
professor? Only the good inten
tions of the professor â€” and
professors are only human.
There are no Institutionalized
means of dealing with graduate
student grievances. Faculty have
their AAUP, a national associa
tion of professors, and often the
threat of leaving for another
job, at some other illustrious in
stitution. Graduate students
have had no such association,
and the leaving of an individual
graduate student would hardly
upset the administration, as the
leaving of Kenneth Arrow or
Sidney Verba does. Furthermore,
the student could only gain en
trance into another esteemed
graduate program with the good
recommendations of his profes
sors. Why should they be forth
coming for a "troublemaker?"
Examinations
Oral exams come late in the
student's career, after 2, 3, or
4 years of course work and in
dependent study. Ranged against
him are a set of examiners who
may possess a half-century or
more of experience in the field.
The student often studies many
months for this "day of reckon
ing" which assumes an import
ance out of proportion to its
value. Its purpose is to test
whether or not a student has
reached a certain level of com
petence, not complete mastery.
But from time to time, a stu
dent will come to orals so para
lyzed with fear, that he must
take them over again, a few
months later when he has "cool
ed down." It is a psychological
principle that a little anxiety is
a good thing, it accelerates the
learning process. But too much
anxiety is crippling. We must
somehow redefine the examina
tion structure so that it stimu
lates only learning and not
dread.
The academic world is popu
lated with people who have
passed exams, but never finished
their dissertations. They circu
late from one university to an
other as perennial instructors
and assistant professors, for it
is almost impossible to obtain
a tenured position without a doc
torate. Often they are good
teachers, but remain second class
citizens in the academy. In these
days of wild expansion, the in
ability of universities and col
leges to assimilate and properly
reward these instructors is noth
ing but foolish and spiteful
waste. Why do so many scho
lars never finish their doctor
ates?
Two Reasons
There seem to be two predomi
nant reasons. The first is eco
nomic necessity. Graduate stu
dents, especially married ones,
often must take full-time teach
ing jobs before they have finish
ed the dissertation. They may
never be able to afford to take
time off to finish up.
The second reason is psycho
logical. Students get exasperat
ed with the "degree race." Some

discover that they do not really
belong In the university. Others
get caught up in intradepart
mental feuds or personal dis
agreements and are not allowed
to finish. Some are discovered
at the last minute to be incom
petent. And finally some simply
avoid making the final break
between being a student and be
ing a full-fledged member of the
academic community.
Critics have written that grad
uate programs punish the incom
petent and the brilliant, and re
ward the mediocre. Certainly
getting a Ph.D. has a lot to do
with "sitting ability."
Medical School
Many programs are just plain
boring. It is Ironical that the
Stanford medical school, a pro
fessional school, has one of the
most exciting programs in the
university, and that the Human
ities and Sciences contain some
of the most stifling programs In
the school. While the Medical
school is serving as a model for
change, the academic depart
ments may exhibit tired, old for
mulas.
Many graduate students come
straight from college. Many are
not sure of their commitment to
this or that discipline. Many
really have little idea what they
are getting into. The university
must do a better job of commu
nicating what it Is all about be
fore the prospective student ap
plies, and of properly orienting
him when he arrives. The need
for college teachers and the cost
of training them, makes "sink
or swim" a very foolish policy.
Programs must be broad enough
and loose enough to let younger
graduate students make "mis
takes" and to grow. Too narrow
or too constricting a program
may send them out of the uni
versity convinced, not only that
they didn't like that subject, but
that university life was definite
ly not for them. Potentially good
scholars and teachers are lost
before they have a chance to
develop.
