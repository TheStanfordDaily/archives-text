# Fall Housing Draw Begins This Week
## 
### 
The University Housing draw
for the 1968-69 academic year
will be on the Prst floor of the
Old Union today, Tuesday, and
Wednesday from 9 to 12 and
from 1 to 4:30.
This is the second step in the
draw procedure following the
signing of intention cards last
week by all those presently in
University housing.
Students now living on cam
pus who wish to change their
University residence have top
priority in the draw. The Hous
ing Office expects few places
available for those presently liv
ing in fraternities or off-campus
who plan to draw. Those wish
ing to remain in their present
housing need not draw.
To enter the draw students
must be registered this quarter
and present a valid student body
card. They may draw alone or
in groups of up to three of the

same sex. If they wish, those
drawing in groups may list joint
preferences then individual ones.
If the members of the group
have different priorities, i.e. a
fraternity resident and an on
campus student, the group will
take the lower priority.
The procedures of the draw
are as follows: 1) present stu
dent body card to be punched,
2) pick draw number, 3) com
plete preference card, 4) com
plete contract card, and 5) turn
both cards in.
To minimize delays and confu
sion students wishing to draw
are asked to observe the follow
ing schedule, according to the
first letter of their last names:
A-C—Monday 9-12.
D-G—Monday 1-4:30.
H-L—Tuesday 9-12.
MR—Tuesday 1-4.
S-Z—Wednesday 9-12.
All—Wednesday 1-4:30.
