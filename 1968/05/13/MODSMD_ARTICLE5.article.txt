# House Votes To Withhold Aid From Demonstrators
## 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON 
The recent wave of student
unrest in the United States has
drawn a sharp reaction from
Congress.
In two separate actions late
last week, the House voted to
withhold aid funds from stu
dents and professors who par
ticipate in campus sit-ins and
other 'illegal' activities.
The bills would apply to recip
ients of National Science Foun
dation Fellowships (NSF) and
National Defense Education Act
loans (NDEA).
Stanford officials estimate
that 2500 Stanford students
could be covered by the pro
posed law. Chances of the
laws' approval by the Senate
appear to be strong.
Both measures are amend
ments to appropriations bills for
the NDEA and NSF programs.
The NDEA amendment was
adopted Thursday night by a
vote of 306-54.
It would withhold NDEA
loans from any person who
"willfully refuses to obey a law
ful regulation or order of the
university . . . when such re
fusal is certified (by the uni
versity) to have been of a ser
ious nature and contributed to
the disruption of the university
or college administration."
The NSF amendment is sim
ilarly worded and was passed
Wednesday night by a voice
vote. Both amendments were in
troduced by Rep. Louis Wyman
(R.N.H.). Wyman said both

amendments were intended "to
help the institutions in control
ling their own internal affairs."
He said that the recent disturb
ances at Columbia led him to
introduce the measure.
Some officials have ex
pressed the fear that the Con
gress could extend similar re
strictions to all forms of stu
dent aid, including: Social
Security and Veterans' Ad
ministration programs.
In a statement released late
last night Stanford's Provost
Richard Lyman said, "The vote
in the House of Representatives
to deny federal loans, grants
and other aid to students who
take part in campus disturb
ances is hardly a surprising re
action to recent episodes that
have shocked the general pub
lic, but it is unlikely to help
the universities in the essential
task of re-establishing respect
for due process and freedom
from coercion and intimidation."
"That task we must perform
for ourselves within the uni
versities; it cannot effectively
be done from Washington by
provisions which President
Johnson's Science Adviser has
described as 'unenforceable, un
workable and an administrative
nightmare.'
"The mere existence of such
proposals, however, let alone
their endorsement by the
House of Representatives,
should alert universities to the
danger of failing: to keep their
houses in order. If we do not

do the Job, outside agencies
will try to do it for us. The
choice is ours to make, and
it's high time we made It"
Earl Cilley, research adminis
trator at Stanford, said Friday
that Stanford, probably in con
junction with other schools,
would "attempt to get the legis
lation modified, if not removed,
before it finally gets into law."
However, he expected that some
measure aimed at protesting
students would probably be en
acted.
Nationwide, more than 1.4

million students, one-fourth of
all college students, are di
rectly affected by the two
votes.
There was little opposition
voiced to the Wyman amend
ment. One congressman said
that he had attended a small
Baptist college where dancing
was prohibited. A violation of
this regulation could, he pointed
out, lead to the loss of federal
aid by the student.
The bill would leave consid
erable discretion in the hands
of university administrators.
One Stanford official, how
ever, pointed out that it would
not be inconceivable for Con
gress to add another amend
ment stating that all universi
ties that do not enforce the law
would lose all federal aid. Stan
ford currently receives some 40
per cent of its income from the
federal government (including
SLAC).
Rep. Ogden Held (B. N.Y.),
one of the few to oppose the
Wyman amendment, said,
"Quite aside from Constitu
tional questions and the ques
tions of academic freedom
that they raise, there Is the
question of Congress enter
ing Into the Internal affairs
of universities."
Robert Huff, director of fi
nancial aids at Stanford, re
ported that approximately 1600
Stanford students receive ND
EA loans. No figure was avail
able on NSF fellowships and
other aid, but it was estimated
that another 1000 students may
receive such aid.
The NDEA bill has not yet
been reported out of committee
in the Senate. It was introduced
as an extension of the student
aid program which is due to
expire at the end of June. The
NDEA bill authorizes loans and
other student aid of more than
$1 billion for two years.
