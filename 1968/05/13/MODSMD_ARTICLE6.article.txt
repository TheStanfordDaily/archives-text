# IFC Picks Phi Delt As New President
## 
### 
The Inter-fratemity Council
(IFC) elected Doug Chandler, a
Phi Delta Theta sophomore,
president for next year during
its meeting Thursday night.
Chandler, who was opposed by
Mike Cooper of Kappa Sigma
and Gregg Murphy of Phi Kap
pa Sigma, hopes to bring
"changes within the IFC struc
ture and its relationship with
the rest of the University."
The increasing number of al
ternatives for campus living
convince Chandler that "fraterni
ties are going to have to main
tain increasing relevance to the
freshmen."

Referring to one charge lev
eled against fraternities, Chand
ler noted, "It is not quite honest
to say that fraternities are Iso
lated." He added that the cur
rent involvement of fraternity
members m University affairs
sets the stage for "expanding
the scope" of IFC and a "more
intense relationship" to other
University affairs.
Chandler feels the recent ac
tion of the two IFC committees
which he served on, one to re
structure the IFC and the other
to present a statement of non
discrimination, are examples of
the direction in which IFC hope
fully will move next year.
The IFC decision, in consulta
tion with Black Stutdent Union
members, to reorient its guest
in-residence program and invite
authorities on the Negroes' prob
lems could be just one step fra
ternities could take in co-spon
soring programs with other
groups on campus, according to
Chandler.
Chandler has been talking
with people on University com
mittees and establishing new
committees in IFC in hopes that
fraternities can "make people
aware that IFC is going to co
operate more closely with other
student groups in the communi
ty."
