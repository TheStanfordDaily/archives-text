# N.Y. Symposium Cancelled
## Shockley Talk Draws Threats 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Threats of demonstrations and
possible violence against a
planned speech by Stanford pro
fessor William B. Shockley
caused the sudden cancellation
of a scientific symposium in
New York last week.
Shockley's speech was titled
"Human Quality Problems and
Research Taboos," and proposed
"that the greatest relief for the
frustrated agony of Black Amer
icans might come from objec
tive diagnosis, painful though
the diagnosis might be, to deter
mine how much of the average
Negro intellectual deficit results
from environmental disadvan
tage and how much from differ
ences in neurological brain
functioning caused by evolu

tionary adolescence," the Nobel
prize winner said.
Professors in the Depart
ment of Social Sciences at the
Polytechnic Institute of Brook
lyn, where the meeting was
supposed to be held, made the
threat in a letter to college
president Ernst Weber, who
subsequently canceled the con
ference.
Shockley said he received a
telegram Tuesday morning in
forming him that the convoca
tion was cancelled.
He later calJ'xl the school and
learned the true reasons for the
cancellation, which were not
those released to the press.
The symposium was to be
sponsored by Sigma Xi, a scien
tific honorary society.
Weber said he called off the
meeting when it was learned
that "problems" might arise
from the fact that Shockley's
speech dealt with the possible
role of genetics in alleged de
ficiencies in Negro intellectual
development.
No further details were given
of what the "problems" might
be.
"Mr. Shockley did not submit
a text of his proposed address,"
Weber said, "but he did convey
the subject matter and the sym

posium was subsequently can
celled."
Shockley questioned the truth
of this statement, since the title
of his speech was submitted
long ago, and the fact that all of
his recent talks have dealth with
this subject is well known.
Shockley was unhappy with
the cancellation.
"Reluctance to expose to
open inquiry into central prob
lems of vital human beliefs is
blocked by dogmatism or fear
or any other cause, the result
is often human agony of the
forms seen under Hitler In
Germany, the Inquisition In
Spain, and under Stalin In
Russia," Shockley continued.
"I personally greatly regret
the loss of an opportunity to ex
pose my preliminary researches
to the scrutiny of the distin
guished Sigma Xi interdiscipli
nary group of research scien
tists.
"I had hoped to present to
Sigma Xi's critical analytic
eye quantitative reasoning
showing that high guaranteed
income alone could not make
American Negro mental test
performance match whites' be
cause new research suggests
relationships that project to a
requirement amounting to

half the Gross National Prod
uct," he added.
Reportedly, the threat in
volved informing local civil
rights groups about Shockley's
topic on the expectation that
picketing would follow.
Shockley said he had the im
pression the faculty of Brooklyn
Poly felt that he should be al
lowed to speak, but that Weber
had decided to cancel the sym
posium anyhow to avoid possible
violence.
Shockley noted that Weber
had stated he "was proud of the
stand" taken by his faculty.
It was learned from other
sources that many of those
participating: in or attending:
the meeting had liked the idea
of Shockley speaking:, because
they wanted the opportunity
to refute him.
About 25 other scientists, in
cluding Nobel Prize winner An
dre Courman, were to have
taken part in the symposium.
Shockley won his Nobel award
in physics for the invention of
the transistor.
The organizer of the symposi
um, James Goldman, professor
of chemistry and vice-president
of the Sigma Xi chapter at
Brooklyn Poly, was reportedly
very disturbed with the entire
affair.

supposed to be held, made the
threat in a letter to college
president Ernst Weber, who
subsequently canceled the con
ference.
Shockley said he received a
telegram Tuesday morning in
forming him that the convoca
tion was cancelled.
He later calJ'xl the school and
learned the true reasons for the
cancellation, which were not
those released to the press.
The symposium was to be
sponsored by Sigma Xi, a scien
tific honorary society.
Weber said he called off the
meeting when it was learned
that "problems" might arise
from the fact that Shockley's
speech dealt with the possible
role of genetics in alleged de
ficiencies in Negro intellectual
development.
No further details were given
of what the "problems" might
be.
"Mr. Shockley did not submit
a text of his proposed address,"
Weber said, "but he did convey
the subject matter and the sym

posium was subsequently can
celled."
Shockley questioned the truth
of this statement, since the title
of his speech was submitted
long ago, and the fact that all of
his recent talks have dealth with
this subject is well known.
Shockley was unhappy with
the cancellation.
"Reluctance to expose to
open inquiry into central prob
lems of vital human beliefs is
blocked by dogmatism or fear
or any other cause, the result
is often human agony of the
forms seen under Hitler In
Germany, the Inquisition In
Spain, and under Stalin In
Russia," Shockley continued.
"I personally greatly regret
the loss of an opportunity to ex
pose my preliminary researches
to the scrutiny of the distin
guished Sigma Xi interdiscipli
nary group of research scien
tists.
"I had hoped to present to
Sigma Xi's critical analytic
eye quantitative reasoning
showing that high guaranteed
income alone could not make
American Negro mental test
performance match whites' be
cause new research suggests
relationships that project to a
requirement amounting to

half the Gross National Prod

Reportedly, the threat in
volved informing local civil

topic on the expectation that
picketing would follow.
Shockley said he had the im
pression the faculty of Brooklyn
Poly felt that he should be al
lowed to speak, but that Weber
had decided to cancel the sym

violence.
Shockley noted that Weber
had stated he "was proud of the
stand" taken by his faculty.
It was learned from other
sources that many of those
participating: in or attending:
the meeting had liked the idea
of Shockley speaking:, because
they wanted the opportunity
to refute him.
About 25 other scientists, in
cluding Nobel Prize winner An
dre Courman, were to have
taken part in the symposium.
Shockley won his Nobel award
in physics for the invention of
the transistor.
The organizer of the symposi
um, James Goldman, professor
of chemistry and vice-president
of the Sigma Xi chapter at
Brooklyn Poly, was reportedly
very disturbed with the entire
affair.
Threats of demonstrations and
possible violence against a
planned speech by Stanford pro
fessor William B. Shockley
caused the sudden cancellation
of a scientific symposium in
New York last week.
Shockley's speech was titled
"Human Quality Problems and
Research Taboos," and proposed
"that the greatest relief for the
frustrated agony of Black Amer
icans might come from objec
tive diagnosis, painful though
the diagnosis might be, to deter
mine how much of the average
Negro intellectual deficit results
from environmental disadvan
tage and how much from differ
