## Viet Peace Talks Underway 
### 
PARIS (AP) — North Viet
nam issued a fresh call yester
day for a total cutoff of Ameri
can operations against its terri
tory on the eve of Paris talks
over the war in Vietnam.
President Johnson's special
envoys, W. Averell Harriman
and Cyrus R. Vance, braced to
counter Hanoi's move with de
mands for guarantees that the
Northern Reds will not exploit
any bombing halt.
The meetings begin this morn
ing in France's International
Conference Center.
France has given assurances
that a scheduled general strike
in Paris would not hinder the
talks.
Security measures will be tak
en to make sure the conferees
are not disturbed. Thousands of
labor union members are sched
uled to march through the city
in support of students demand
ing university reforms.
The line of the planned pro
test march is more than two
miles from the meeting site, but
demonstrations may spread to
other parts of the city.
French authorities have ac
cused a hard core of pro-
Chinese Communists of riding
the wave of student unrest in a
bid to upset the conference,
which Peking opposes.
Hanoi's call for an uncondi

tional end to American attacks
on the North, as the first step
toward wider peace, was backed
by the Russians.
• Pravda Pessimistic
MOSCOW (AP) — Pravda
said yesterday U.S. commit
ments to allies in the Vietnam
war "cannot favor the success
of the Paris talks."
The Communist party news
paper said the obligations of
America "come down to spread
ing aggression against the iVet
namese people, to attempt to
consolidate in Southeast Asia
and to continue to carry out p<v
lice functions taken there
against the national liberation
movement."
At the same time, Foreign
Minister Andrie A. Gromyko
was quoted in Rome as saying
the Soviet Union will continue
to send military aid to the
North Vietnamese and the Viet
Cong while the Paris talks are
going on.
Pravda said that, because of
U.S. obligations to allies, "those
who thought that the luggage
of chief U.S. negotiator W. Av
erell Harriman contains a
'peace plan' can expect disap
pointment."

• VC Offensive
SAIGON (AP) — The Viet
Cong brought their offensive
against Saigon into a second
week yesterday with attacks on
two vital bridges in the capital's
northern fringes while continu
ing a holdout in the rubble of a
devastated neighborhood near a
Y-shaped bridge leading to the
Mekong Delta in the south.
U.S. FlOO Super Saber jets
hammered the holdouts yester
day night with bombing attacks
that shook downtown Saigon,
two miles away.
At the same time, the U.S.
Command, reporting on the first
week of fighting in the capital
and its immediate vicinity, said
allied forces had killed 2,982 en
emy troops and took 261 prison
ers.
It said another 1,000 enemy
were killed outside the capital
area.
• Heart Transplant
PARIS (AP) — France's third
human heart transplant was
successfully performed yester
day, French medical sources re
ported today.
The Broussais Hospital, where
the operation was said to have
taken place, refused to confirm

Reports of the operation were

widely published in morning
papers without official confir
mation.
• Mrs. King Marches
WASHINGTON (AP)— The
widow of Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. led a Mother's Day
march yesterday in support of
increased welfare benefits.
It was the national capital's
first mass phase of the Poor

The march was a calm, al
though somewhat confused, pre
lude to what is planned as a

sopnsored by the Southern
Christian Leadership Confer
ence to press demands for legis
lation to help the poor.
Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark said
yesterday every reasonable pre
caution has been taken to pro
tect the citizens of Washington
and participants in the Poor
People's Campaign against any
outbreak of violence.
The National Park Service is
sued a permit Friday to the

ground in a park between the
Lincoln Memorial and the Wash
