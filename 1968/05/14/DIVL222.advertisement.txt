But your own 2-way radio is. Personal hand-held
sets from the little "squawkie-talkies" to the full 5-
watt unit used on the U.S. Antarctic Expedition are
useful tools in many situations.

stations at home or work.
Lafayette's own make of 2-way radio transceivers
are top sellers throughout the U.S.
Let us show you how any citizen can use 2-way
radio to advantage.
