# Med Students End Protest Over Health Curriculum
## 
### HANK LIESE 
Twenty medical students who
took their December final in
Community Health anonymous
ly have decided to sign their
exams and halt their protest af
ter a decision by an Interim
Curriculum Committee to make
the course elective next year.
The third-year students, ob
jecting to the 'redundancy, nar
rowness of scope, work load, and
teaching of the Community
Health course," did not sign their

final examinations fall quarter
and were given incompletes in
the course.
In a letter written to the
faculty of the medical school
last week, the protesting stu
dents stated that "if signing
our exams or taking make
ups is required to show our
willingness to participate
meaningfully in relevant
changes, then we will do so."
The students said that their
goal is "constructive change"

and asked that several recom
mendations be considered, one
being that the current Commu
nity Health course be made an
elective.
Dr. Leroy Pesch, associate
dean of the medical school and
chairman of the Interim Cur
riculum Committee (ICC), said
that the Committee was "trying
to respond not to the protest
itself, but to the concern of these
students with their curriculum."
Dr. Pesch also stated that
the recent action of the ICC is
part of the continuing curricu
lum change in the entire medi
cal school, and is not purpose
ly "singling out" a specific
course.
He explained that following
their failure to sign the final ex
amination the twenty students
were treated in the same man
ner as any medical student with
an academic deficiency.
The students were given a
warning at the beginning of
spring quarter that failure to
make up the incomplete by June
15 might prevent future registra
tion.
Commenting on the action
taken last December by the
students, Dr. Bernard Nelson,
assistant dean for student af
fairs at the medical school,
said that it is much easier and
more productive to work
through curriculum problems
without such a confrontation.
Lincoln Russin, one of the
twenty students, said that the
group uniformly the Com
munity Health course had to
change, but it wasn't going to
change unless something was
done.
Russin feels that the fact this
issue was discussed in the first
few meetings of the ICC is due

to the activism of the twenty
students.
"I am fairly sure there will
be an alternative course in com
munity medicine next year
which will deal with the more
pressing issues of community
care today."
"We are very pleased and en
couraged by recent develop
ments. If the ICC had not act
ed with the foresight it did,
we would have continued our
protest. But we realize now
that the time has come for
progress, and we are signing
our exams in good faith."
In their letter of last week, the
twenty students claimed that
there was no "appropriate chan
nel" for their protest last fall.
Dr. Pesch conceded that, had
the Interim Curriculum Commit
tee been in existence last Decem
ber, the protest would probably
not have taken the form it did.
The ICC which began work
three weeks ago, is the forerun
ner of a permanent Committee
on Courses and Curriculum
which will be composed of both
students and faculty, the stu
dents having full voting power.
One of three other resolutions
made by the ICC last Tuesday
stated that the Committee feels
that the proposed permanent
Committee on Courses and Cur
riculum will, in the future, "pro
vide a channel through which
student opinion and ideas can be
effectively considered and imple
mented, and the committee wel
comes such participation by the
student body."
"I hope," said Dr. Pesch, "that
students involved have learned
we're interested in their con
cerns. We have begun to estab
lish communication between stu
dents and faculty."
