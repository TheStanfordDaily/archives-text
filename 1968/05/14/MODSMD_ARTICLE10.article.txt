# Faculty Letter Correction
## 
### 
(Editor's note: Due to a typo
graphical error, two lines were
omitted from the letter in yes
terday's DAILY, signed by Ga
briel Almond and ten other fac
ulty members. Their first point
should read in full as follows:
1. At no point did we intend
our action as a vote of "no con
fidence' 'in the administration.
We expressed a difference of
opinion—a very deep difference
—but we believe it to be the es

sence of the democratic proc
ess that reasonable men may
disagree on one issue and im
mediately be prepared to make
common cause on the next one.
Consequently we reaffirm our
full confidenc in President Ster
ling, Provost Lyman, Vice-Pro
vost Packer, and other admini
stration officials with whom on
this occasion we may have dif
fered, and we look forward to
working under their leadership
in building Stanford's future.
