# Letters To The Editor
## Alum Disputes Minority Policy 
### 
(Editor's note: This is a copy
of a letter sent to President Ster
ling by a Stanford alumnus.)
Editor, The Daily:
I am a graduate of Stanford
University and for the last ten
years have a consistent, al
though moderate financial sup
porter of Stanford. I have read
in my local newspapers and in
a recent issue of the Stanford
Daily, of Stanford's new admis
sion policies as regards minority
groups.
I have deliberately delayed
writing this letter because I
wished to collect and organize
my thinking about this complex
matter. It is my understanding
of the proposed new minority
policy that Stanford will vigor
ously recruit minority applicants
to the University. They will ad
mit a proportionate number of
"promising" minority applicants
even if their qualifications are
not otherwise equivalent to the
remainder of the student body.
I recognize that an education
al problem for minority groups
does exist in this country and
I also feel that it is the duty of
any great university to do its
part to solve it. My tentative
objections to the current Stan
ford program lie with the
method rather than the goal. I
feel very strongly that Stanford
should recruit for qualified
minority students, but I also
strongly feel that the standards
for acceptance, for financial sup
port, and for maintenance with
in the University should be equal
and identical for all students.
To do otherwise is to substi
tute one form of discrimination
for another and I can see no
point in contributing financial
support for the creation of a
new type of radical privilege
when it has proven so catastro
phically expensive for this na
tion to rid itself of the old.
I feel this way especially since
the people who will be hurt by
the new program are those non
minority applicants who are cer
tainly innocent of any part in
the creation of the present struc
ture of racial prejudice and who
will be qualified for admission
to Stanford in every respect, but
who can not in the future be
admitted to Stanford because
their places have been given to
less qualified applicants, simply
because they are deserving mem
bers of a minority group.
In summary, although I recog

nize the worth of the goal which
the new program is attempting
to achieve, I fear that Stanford
is attempting to correct one in
justice with the substitution of
another and I do not believe this
is possible. In an attempt to be
fair to one racial group, Stan
ford is implementing a system
which must inevitably be unfair
to individuals of another. Simp
ly put, I do not believe that good
ever comes from evil.
It is certainly unnecessary for
me to point out that any form
of discrimination begins because
it seems to solve an immediate
social problem or produce a
temporary good. Four hundred
years of racial strife in this
country should have taught us
all that any type of special
privilege or preference for one
group at the expense of others
produces a body of resentment,
frustration, and bitterness which
soon overwhelms whatever bene
fit was originally obtained.
I am very grateful to Stan
ford. I have always respected
my University and would like
to continue to support it. I also
believe that if the very begin
ning of our country, people had
recognized and refused to sup
port discrimination our racial
problems would never have
grown to the terrible monster
that now exists. Knowing this,
why should I continue to sup
port Stanford? I am anxious to
be convinced. I would appreciate
an answer.

Students Display New
False Consciousness
Editor, The Daily:
The orators of the sit-in did
not all adjust easily to a differ
ent atmosphere. That is not sur
prising, but some of their state
ments were.
"We're still not equal, just like
the black people," was one as
sertion quoted in the Daily from
last Thursday's noon meeting.
The speaker thereby equated the
sufferings of black men and
women in the least favored parts
of America with the grievances
of middle-class white students
in a suburban university. This,
despite the obvious contrasts be
tween an oppressed class and a
fortuitious gathering of privi
leged men and women sitting
in the sunlight. The implication
underlying the speaker's state

ment is not herioc; it is, in fact,
profoundly racist.
Another speaker said that a
student must never be suspend
ed for anything but academic
failure. This doctrine would
grant to students an immunity
that is not given to faculty mem
bers, who can be deprived of
tenure for various "non-aca
demic" offenses. The same
speaker called for student con
trol of faculty appointments at
tenure rank.
When this speaker talks of
equality, he evidently means
that every student must be the
equal of every other student;
and that every faculty member,
including not only the President,
the Provost, and the deans but
even the lowliest instructor,
must be subordinated.
He proved that candor is no
protection against incoherence.
Supposing that students had the
kind of privilege he wants, it is
difficult to see how they could
surrender it when they grad
uate — particularly if the only
thing they are fit for is to be
come faculty members.
Those who study revolutions
will be interested in thes new
varieties of false consciousness,
unknown to previous theoreti
cians.

To this end any member of

Stanford Faculty Vote
In Favor Of Anarchy?
Editor, The Daily:
At a meeting held last Wed
nesday, the Stanford Faculty
has (1) rewarded President
Sterling for his loyal and de
voted service to the University
by kicking him in the teeth, (2)
made it impossible to find a
suitable successor to Dr. Ster
ling, and (3) declared itself in
favor of lawlessness and, indeed,
anarchy.

Difference Between
Choosing And Being
Editor, The Dally:
I would like to answer myself
to the letter written by James
Alan Coogan which appeared
in last Friday's Daily. In that
letter Mr. Coogan laments what
he considers to be the impend
ing deterioration in American
higher education caused by stu
dent political activism.
As an example of what he is

concerned about, he compares
the desire of students to partici
pate in the selection of Stan
ford's next president with a stu
dent desiring to sit in place of
David Rockefeller as president
of the Chase Manhattan.
I might point out to Mr. Coo
gan that there is a considerable
difference between sitting in for
an administrator and sitting in
on the selection of an adminis
trator. An example of that dif
ferr ; v?e is that T am quite sure
most Americans would never
<liv. 112 serving as President
of the United States, but neither
would they dream of not partici
pating in his selection. . . .
Since Mr. Coogan feels people
engaged in academic activity
are incapable of choosing the
man for a "task requiring every
bit as much judgment, technical
knowledge, skill and experience
as Mr. Rockefeller utilizes in
running Chase Manhattan" I
would respectfully suggest that
Mr. Coogan refrain from vot
ing, (if eligible), in this year's
presidential election.

Talk On Racial Crisis
Editor, The Daily:
Business is often criticised for
being out of touch with the real
problems that face society to
day. Business school students
have perhaps insufficient con
tact with other student groups.
Yet MBA's will soon be in a
strong position to influence the
environment within which most
people live and work.
As many of you know there
will be a conference in Bishop
Auditorium at the - Business
School Wednesday morning on
the racial crisis* It will provide
an ideal / opportunity for stu
dents from all fields to discuss
the action we should be taking,
along with both black and white
persons who have been taking
positive steps.
The Business School LASSU
representatives are particularly
keen that all those interested in
this topic will spare the time
to discuss it with us.

Editor, The Dally:
I would like to answer myself
to the letter written by James
Alan Coogan which appeared
in last Friday's Daily. In that
letter Mr. Coogan laments what
he considers to be the impend
ing deterioration in American
higher education caused by stu
dent political activism.
As an example of what he is

concerned about, he compares
the desire of students to partici
pate in the selection of Stan
ford's next president with a stu
dent desiring to sit in place of
David Rockefeller as president
of the Chase Manhattan.
I might point out to Mr. Coo
gan that there is a considerable
difference between sitting in for
an administrator and sitting in
on the selection of an adminis
trator. An example of that dif
ferr ; v?e is that T am quite sure
most Americans would never
<liv. 112 serving as President
of the United States, but neither
would they dream of not partici
pating in his selection. . . .
Since Mr. Coogan feels people
engaged in academic activity
are incapable of choosing the
man for a "task requiring every
bit as much judgment, technical
knowledge, skill and experience
as Mr. Rockefeller utilizes in
running Chase Manhattan" I
would respectfully suggest that
Mr. Coogan refrain from vot
ing, (if eligible), in this year's
presidential election.

Talk On Racial Crisis
Editor, The Daily:
Business is often criticised for
being out of touch with the real
problems that face society to
day. Business school students
have perhaps insufficient con
tact with other student groups.
Yet MBA's will soon be in a
strong position to influence the
environment within which most
people live and work.
As many of you know there
will be a conference in Bishop
Auditorium at the - Business
School Wednesday morning on
the racial crisis* It will provide
an ideal / opportunity for stu
dents from all fields to discuss
the action we should be taking,
along with both black and white
persons who have been taking
positive steps.
The Business School LASSU
representatives are particularly
keen that all those interested in
this topic will spare the time
to discuss it with us.
NICK FALK
Business School
(Editor's note: This is a copy
of a letter sent to President Ster
ling by a Stanford alumnus.)
Editor, The Daily:
I am a graduate of Stanford
University and for the last ten
years have a consistent, al
though moderate financial sup
porter of Stanford. I have read
in my local newspapers and in
a recent issue of the Stanford
Daily, of Stanford's new admis
sion policies as regards minority
groups.
I have deliberately delayed
writing this letter because I
wished to collect and organize
my thinking about this complex
matter. It is my understanding
of the proposed new minority
policy that Stanford will vigor
ously recruit minority applicants
to the University. They will ad
mit a proportionate number of
"promising" minority applicants
even if their qualifications are
not otherwise equivalent to the
remainder of the student body.
I recognize that an education
al problem for minority groups
does exist in this country and
I also feel that it is the duty of
any great university to do its
part to solve it. My tentative
objections to the current Stan
ford program lie with the
method rather than the goal. I
feel very strongly that Stanford
should recruit for qualified
minority students, but I also
strongly feel that the standards
for acceptance, for financial sup
port, and for maintenance with
in the University should be equal
and identical for all students.
To do otherwise is to substi
tute one form of discrimination
for another and I can see no
point in contributing financial
support for the creation of a
new type of radical privilege
when it has proven so catastro
phically expensive for this na
tion to rid itself of the old.
I feel this way especially since
the people who will be hurt by
the new program are those non
minority applicants who are cer
tainly innocent of any part in
the creation of the present struc
ture of racial prejudice and who
will be qualified for admission
to Stanford in every respect, but
who can not in the future be
admitted to Stanford because
their places have been given to
less qualified applicants, simply
because they are deserving mem
bers of a minority group.
In summary, although I recog

nize the worth of the goal which
the new program is attempting
to achieve, I fear that Stanford
is attempting to correct one in
justice with the substitution of
another and I do not believe this
is possible. In an attempt to be
fair to one racial group, Stan
ford is implementing a system
which must inevitably be unfair
to individuals of another. Simp
ly put, I do not believe that good
ever comes from evil.
It is certainly unnecessary for
me to point out that any form
of discrimination begins because
it seems to solve an immediate
social problem or produce a
temporary good. Four hundred
years of racial strife in this
country should have taught us
all that any type of special
privilege or preference for one
group at the expense of others
produces a body of resentment,
frustration, and bitterness which
soon overwhelms whatever bene
fit was originally obtained.
I am very grateful to Stan
ford. I have always respected
my University and would like
to continue to support it. I also
believe that if the very begin
ning of our country, people had
recognized and refused to sup
port discrimination our racial
problems would never have
grown to the terrible monster
that now exists. Knowing this,
why should I continue to sup
port Stanford? I am anxious to
be convinced. I would appreciate
an answer.

The orators of the sit-in did
not all adjust easily to a differ

prising, but some of their state

"We're still not equal, just like
the black people," was one as
sertion quoted in the Daily from
last Thursday's noon meeting.
The speaker thereby equated the
sufferings of black men and

of America with the grievances
of middle-class white students
in a suburban university. This,
despite the obvious contrasts be

fortuitious gathering of privi

in the sunlight. The implication
underlying the speaker's state

ment is not herioc; it is, in fact,
profoundly racist.
Another speaker said that a
student must never be suspend

failure. This doctrine would
grant to students an immunity
that is not given to faculty mem

(Editor's note: This is a copy
of a letter sent to President Ster

Editor, The Daily:
I am a graduate of Stanford
University and for the last ten
years have a consistent, al
though moderate financial sup
porter of Stanford. I have read
in my local newspapers and in
a recent issue of the Stanford
Daily, of Stanford's new admis
sion policies as regards minority
groups.
I have deliberately delayed
writing this letter because I
wished to collect and organize
my thinking about this complex
matter. It is my understanding
of the proposed new minority
policy that Stanford will vigor
ously recruit minority applicants
to the University. They will ad
mit a proportionate number of
"promising" minority applicants
even if their qualifications are
not otherwise equivalent to the
remainder of the student body.
I recognize that an education
al problem for minority groups
does exist in this country and
I also feel that it is the duty of
any great university to do its
part to solve it. My tentative
objections to the current Stan
ford program lie with the
method rather than the goal. I
feel very strongly that Stanford
should recruit for qualified
minority students, but I also
strongly feel that the standards
for acceptance, for financial sup
port, and for maintenance with
in the University should be equal
and identical for all students.
To do otherwise is to substi
tute one form of discrimination
for another and I can see no
point in contributing financial
support for the creation of a
new type of radical privilege
when it has proven so catastro
phically expensive for this na
tion to rid itself of the old.
I feel this way especially since
the people who will be hurt by
the new program are those non
minority applicants who are cer
tainly innocent of any part in
the creation of the present struc
ture of racial prejudice and who
will be qualified for admission
to Stanford in every respect, but
who can not in the future be
admitted to Stanford because
their places have been given to
less qualified applicants, simply
because they are deserving mem
bers of a minority group.
In summary, although I recog

nize the worth of the goal which
the new program is attempting
to achieve, I fear that Stanford
is attempting to correct one in
justice with the substitution of
another and I do not believe this
is possible. In an attempt to be
fair to one racial group, Stan
ford is implementing a system
which must inevitably be unfair
to individuals of another. Simp
ly put, I do not believe that good
ever comes from evil.
It is certainly unnecessary for
me to point out that any form
of discrimination begins because
it seems to solve an immediate
social problem or produce a
temporary good. Four hundred
years of racial strife in this
country should have taught us
all that any type of special
privilege or preference for one
group at the expense of others
produces a body of resentment,
frustration, and bitterness which
soon overwhelms whatever bene
fit was originally obtained.
I am very grateful to Stan
ford. I have always respected
my University and would like
to continue to support it. I also
believe that if the very begin
ning of our country, people had
recognized and refused to sup
port discrimination our racial
problems would never have
grown to the terrible monster
that now exists. Knowing this,
why should I continue to sup
port Stanford? I am anxious to
be convinced. I would appreciate
an answer.

Students Display New
False Consciousness
Editor, The Daily:
The orators of the sit-in did
not all adjust easily to a differ
ent atmosphere. That is not sur
prising, but some of their state
ments were.
"We're still not equal, just like
the black people," was one as
sertion quoted in the Daily from
last Thursday's noon meeting.
The speaker thereby equated the
sufferings of black men and
women in the least favored parts
of America with the grievances
of middle-class white students
in a suburban university. This,
despite the obvious contrasts be
tween an oppressed class and a
fortuitious gathering of privi
leged men and women sitting
in the sunlight. The implication
underlying the speaker's state

ment is not herioc; it is, in fact,
profoundly racist.
Another speaker said that a
student must never be suspend
ed for anything but academic
failure. This doctrine would
grant to students an immunity
that is not given to faculty mem
bers, who can be deprived of
tenure for various "non-aca
demic" offenses. The same
speaker called for student con
trol of faculty appointments at
tenure rank.
When this speaker talks of
equality, he evidently means
that every student must be the
equal of every other student;
and that every faculty member,
including not only the President,
the Provost, and the deans but
even the lowliest instructor,
must be subordinated.
He proved that candor is no
protection against incoherence.
Supposing that students had the
kind of privilege he wants, it is
difficult to see how they could
surrender it when they grad
uate — particularly if the only
thing they are fit for is to be
come faculty members.
Those who study revolutions
will be interested in thes new
varieties of false consciousness,
unknown to previous theoreti

Difference Between
Choosing And Being
Editor, The Dally:
I would like to answer myself
to the letter written by James
Alan Coogan which appeared
in last Friday's Daily. In that
letter Mr. Coogan laments what
he considers to be the impend
ing deterioration in American
higher education caused by stu
dent political activism.
As an example of what he is

concerned about, he compares
the desire of students to partici
pate in the selection of Stan
ford's next president with a stu
dent desiring to sit in place of
David Rockefeller as president
of the Chase Manhattan.
I might point out to Mr. Coo
gan that there is a considerable
difference between sitting in for
an administrator and sitting in
on the selection of an adminis
trator. An example of that dif
ferr ; v?e is that T am quite sure
most Americans would never
<liv. 112 serving as President
of the United States, but neither
would they dream of not partici
pating in his selection. . . .
Since Mr. Coogan feels people
engaged in academic activity
are incapable of choosing the
man for a "task requiring every
bit as much judgment, technical
knowledge, skill and experience
as Mr. Rockefeller utilizes in
running Chase Manhattan" I
would respectfully suggest that
Mr. Coogan refrain from vot
ing, (if eligible), in this year's
presidential election.

Editor, The Dally:
I would like to answer myself
to the letter written by James
Alan Coogan which appeared
in last Friday's Daily. In that
letter Mr. Coogan laments what
he considers to be the impend
ing deterioration in American
higher education caused by stu
dent political activism.
As an example of what he is

concerned about, he compares
the desire of students to partici
pate in the selection of Stan
ford's next president with a stu
dent desiring to sit in place of
David Rockefeller as president
of the Chase Manhattan.
I might point out to Mr. Coo
gan that there is a considerable
difference between sitting in for
an administrator and sitting in
on the selection of an adminis
trator. An example of that dif
ferr ; v?e is that T am quite sure
most Americans would never
<liv. 112 serving as President
of the United States, but neither
would they dream of not partici
pating in his selection. . . .
Since Mr. Coogan feels people
engaged in academic activity
are incapable of choosing the
man for a "task requiring every
bit as much judgment, technical
knowledge, skill and experience
as Mr. Rockefeller utilizes in
running Chase Manhattan" I
would respectfully suggest that
Mr. Coogan refrain from vot
ing, (if eligible), in this year's
presidential election.

Talk On Racial Crisis
Editor, The Daily:
Business is often criticised for
being out of touch with the real
problems that face society to
day. Business school students
have perhaps insufficient con
tact with other student groups.
Yet MBA's will soon be in a
strong position to influence the
environment within which most
people live and work.
As many of you know there
will be a conference in Bishop
Auditorium at the - Business
School Wednesday morning on
the racial crisis* It will provide
an ideal / opportunity for stu
dents from all fields to discuss
the action we should be taking,
along with both black and white
persons who have been taking
positive steps.
The Business School LASSU
representatives are particularly
keen that all those interested in
this topic will spare the time
to discuss it with us.
NICK FALK
Business School
(Editor's note: This is a copy
of a letter sent to President Ster
ling by a Stanford alumnus.)
Editor, The Daily:
I am a graduate of Stanford
University and for the last ten
years have a consistent, al
though moderate financial sup
porter of Stanford. I have read
in my local newspapers and in
a recent issue of the Stanford
Daily, of Stanford's new admis
sion policies as regards minority
groups.
I have deliberately delayed
writing this letter because I
wished to collect and organize
my thinking about this complex
matter. It is my understanding
of the proposed new minority
policy that Stanford will vigor
ously recruit minority applicants
to the University. They will ad
mit a proportionate number of
"promising" minority applicants
even if their qualifications are
not otherwise equivalent to the
remainder of the student body.
I recognize that an education
al problem for minority groups
does exist in this country and
I also feel that it is the duty of
any great university to do its
part to solve it. My tentative
objections to the current Stan
ford program lie with the
method rather than the goal. I
feel very strongly that Stanford
should recruit for qualified
minority students, but I also
strongly feel that the standards
for acceptance, for financial sup
port, and for maintenance with
in the University should be equal
and identical for all students.
To do otherwise is to substi
tute one form of discrimination
for another and I can see no
point in contributing financial
support for the creation of a
new type of radical privilege
when it has proven so catastro
phically expensive for this na
tion to rid itself of the old.
I feel this way especially since
the people who will be hurt by
the new program are those non
minority applicants who are cer
tainly innocent of any part in
the creation of the present struc
ture of racial prejudice and who
will be qualified for admission
to Stanford in every respect, but
who can not in the future be
admitted to Stanford because
their places have been given to
less qualified applicants, simply
because they are deserving mem
bers of a minority group.
In summary, although I recog

nize the worth of the goal which
the new program is attempting
to achieve, I fear that Stanford
is attempting to correct one in
justice with the substitution of
another and I do not believe this
is possible. In an attempt to be
fair to one racial group, Stan
ford is implementing a system
which must inevitably be unfair
to individuals of another. Simp
ly put, I do not believe that good
ever comes from evil.
It is certainly unnecessary for
me to point out that any form
of discrimination begins because
it seems to solve an immediate
social problem or produce a
temporary good. Four hundred
years of racial strife in this
country should have taught us
all that any type of special
privilege or preference for one
group at the expense of others
produces a body of resentment,
frustration, and bitterness which
soon overwhelms whatever bene
fit was originally obtained.
I am very grateful to Stan
ford. I have always respected
my University and would like
to continue to support it. I also
believe that if the very begin
ning of our country, people had
recognized and refused to sup
port discrimination our racial
problems would never have
grown to the terrible monster
that now exists. Knowing this,
why should I continue to sup
port Stanford? I am anxious to
be convinced. I would appreciate
an answer.

The orators of the sit-in did
not all adjust easily to a differ

"We're still not equal, just like
the black people," was one as
sertion quoted in the Daily from

The speaker thereby equated the
sufferings of black men and

of America with the grievances
of middle-class white students
in a suburban university. This,
despite the obvious contrasts be

fortuitious gathering of privi

in the sunlight. The implication
underlying the speaker's state

ment is not herioc; it is, in fact,
profoundly racist.
Another speaker said that a
student must never be suspend

failure. This doctrine would
grant to students an immunity
that is not given to faculty mem

(Editor's note: This is a copy
of a letter sent to President Ster
ling by a Stanford alumnus.)
Editor, The Daily:
I am a graduate of Stanford
University and for the last ten
years have a consistent, al
though moderate financial sup
porter of Stanford. I have read
in my local newspapers and in
a recent issue of the Stanford
Daily, of Stanford's new admis
sion policies as regards minority
groups.
I have deliberately delayed
writing this letter because I
wished to collect and organize
my thinking about this complex
matter. It is my understanding
of the proposed new minority
policy that Stanford will vigor
ously recruit minority applicants
to the University. They will ad
mit a proportionate number of
"promising" minority applicants
even if their qualifications are
not otherwise equivalent to the
remainder of the student body.
I recognize that an education
al problem for minority groups
does exist in this country and
I also feel that it is the duty of
any great university to do its
part to solve it. My tentative
objections to the current Stan
ford program lie with the
method rather than the goal. I
feel very strongly that Stanford
should recruit for qualified
minority students, but I also
strongly feel that the standards
for acceptance, for financial sup
port, and for maintenance with
in the University should be equal
and identical for all students.
To do otherwise is to substi
tute one form of discrimination
for another and I can see no
point in contributing financial
support for the creation of a
new type of radical privilege
when it has proven so catastro
phically expensive for this na
tion to rid itself of the old.
I feel this way especially since
the people who will be hurt by
the new program are those non
minority applicants who are cer
tainly innocent of any part in
the creation of the present struc
ture of racial prejudice and who
will be qualified for admission
to Stanford in every respect, but
who can not in the future be
admitted to Stanford because
their places have been given to
less qualified applicants, simply
because they are deserving mem
bers of a minority group.
In summary, although I recog

nize the worth of the goal which
the new program is attempting
to achieve, I fear that Stanford
is attempting to correct one in
justice with the substitution of
another and I do not believe this
is possible. In an attempt to be
fair to one racial group, Stan
ford is implementing a system
which must inevitably be unfair
to individuals of another. Simp
ly put, I do not believe that good
ever comes from evil.
It is certainly unnecessary for
me to point out that any form
of discrimination begins because
it seems to solve an immediate
social problem or produce a
temporary good. Four hundred
years of racial strife in this
country should have taught us
all that any type of special
privilege or preference for one
group at the expense of others
produces a body of resentment,
frustration, and bitterness which
soon overwhelms whatever bene
fit was originally obtained.
I am very grateful to Stan
ford. I have always respected
my University and would like
to continue to support it. I also
believe that if the very begin
ning of our country, people had
recognized and refused to sup
port discrimination our racial
problems would never have
grown to the terrible monster
that now exists. Knowing this,
why should I continue to sup
port Stanford? I am anxious to
be convinced. I would appreciate
an answer.

Students Display New
False Consciousness
Editor, The Daily:
The orators of the sit-in did
not all adjust easily to a differ
ent atmosphere. That is not sur
prising, but some of their state
ments were.
"We're still not equal, just like
the black people," was one as
sertion quoted in the Daily from
last Thursday's noon meeting.
The speaker thereby equated the
sufferings of black men and
women in the least favored parts
of America with the grievances
of middle-class white students
in a suburban university. This,
despite the obvious contrasts be
tween an oppressed class and a
fortuitious gathering of privi
leged men and women sitting
in the sunlight. The implication
underlying the speaker's state

ment is not herioc; it is, in fact,
profoundly racist.
Another speaker said that a
student must never be suspend
ed for anything but academic
failure. This doctrine would
grant to students an immunity
that is not given to faculty mem
bers, who can be deprived of
tenure for various "non-aca
demic" offenses. The same
speaker called for student con
trol of faculty appointments at
tenure rank.
When this speaker talks of
equality, he evidently means
that every student must be the
equal of every other student;
and that every faculty member,
including not only the President,
the Provost, and the deans but
even the lowliest instructor,
must be subordinated.
He proved that candor is no
protection against incoherence.
Supposing that students had the
kind of privilege he wants, it is
difficult to see how they could
surrender it when they grad
uate — particularly if the only
thing they are fit for is to be
come faculty members.
Those who study revolutions
will be interested in thes new
varieties of false consciousness,
unknown to previous theoreti
cians.

Lunch Forum Offers
Means For Contact
Editor, The Daily:
The recent demonstrations
have pointed, among other
things, to the need for more stu
dent • faculty - administration
contact. Although a variety of
channels of communication al
ready exist, others could fruit
fully be opened up.
To this end any member of
the student body, faculty and
administration is invited to a
Student - Faculty Open Lunch
Forum in order to discuss topics
concerning the future of the Uni
versity. The Forum meets every
Thursday at noon in the Club
house (Old Union Court). Please
reserve places by calling Miss
Hansen, Ext. 4521. The Dean of
Students' Office pays for the
meals of students.

Stanford Faculty Vote
In Favor Of Anarchy?
Editor, The Daily:
At a meeting held last Wed
nesday, the Stanford Faculty
has (1) rewarded President
Sterling for his loyal and de
voted service to the University
by kicking him in the teeth, (2)
made it impossible to find a
suitable successor to Dr. Ster
ling, and (3) declared itself in
favor of lawlessness and, indeed,
anarchy.
SHAME!

Difference Between
Choosing And Being
Editor, The Dally:
I would like to answer myself
to the letter written by James
Alan Coogan which appeared
in last Friday's Daily. In that
letter Mr. Coogan laments what
he considers to be the impend
ing deterioration in American
higher education caused by stu
dent political activism.
As an example of what he is

concerned about, he compares
the desire of students to partici
pate in the selection of Stan
ford's next president with a stu
dent desiring to sit in place of
David Rockefeller as president
of the Chase Manhattan.
I might point out to Mr. Coo
gan that there is a considerable
difference between sitting in for
an administrator and sitting in
on the selection of an adminis
trator. An example of that dif
ferr ; v?e is that T am quite sure
most Americans would never
<liv. 112 serving as President
of the United States, but neither
would they dream of not partici
pating in his selection. . . .
Since Mr. Coogan feels people
engaged in academic activity
are incapable of choosing the
man for a "task requiring every
bit as much judgment, technical
knowledge, skill and experience
as Mr. Rockefeller utilizes in
running Chase Manhattan" I
would respectfully suggest that
Mr. Coogan refrain from vot
ing, (if eligible), in this year's
presidential election.

Talk On Racial Crisis
Editor, The Daily:
Business is often criticised for
being out of touch with the real
problems that face society to
day. Business school students
have perhaps insufficient con
tact with other student groups.
Yet MBA's will soon be in a
strong position to influence the
environment within which most
people live and work.
As many of you know there
will be a conference in Bishop
Auditorium at the - Business
School Wednesday morning on
the racial crisis* It will provide
an ideal / opportunity for stu
dents from all fields to discuss
the action we should be taking,
along with both black and white
persons who have been taking
positive steps.
The Business School LASSU
representatives are particularly
keen that all those interested in
this topic will spare the time
to discuss it with us.
