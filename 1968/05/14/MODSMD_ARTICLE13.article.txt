# My Wits Faint
## Wise Man Needed 
### Mercutio 
"A» you are old and reverend,
should be wise."
Lear I:lv
Oh pity Standard University,
that needs a wise leader but
has none! That great citadel of
learning, nestled under the
smog of a metropolitan area,
drifts from crisis to crisis. The
future arouses fear.
Hear me right: Standard
needs a wise President, not a
tyrant. A man who can kick
those people in the pants who
need kicking—such as fat-assed
faculty and fat-headed students.
But he must also calmly endure
being kicked around himself.
Presently Standard is afflicted
with two kinds of leaders. One
kind—the Patriarchs—have dig
nity and calm, but no brains.
The other kind—the Tight-lips
—have brains and cunning, but
also an ugly streak of meanness.
Standard does have a few bona
fule wise men, blessed with the
better parts of both the Patri
archs and the Tight-lips. But
being wise, these professors
know enough to hide behind
their books.
The Patriarchs are men who
should have retired the day
(hey started calling students
"youngster." Down deep they
look on students as lesser be
ings. They have stopped listen
ing, content with keeping their
dignity in the airy clouds. Al
though Patriarchs do meritor
ious service as Defenders of the
university against the outside
forces of Barbarism, they are
superfluous to the life within
the University.
Whirlwind TighMips
Not so the Tight-lips. They
are never superfluous to any
thing. The Tight-lips are verit

able whirlwinds of energy,
working long nights with blood
shot eyes. Unlike the Patriarchs,
the Tight-lips listen intently to
everyone. They fly around the
nation to win dollars for Stan
dard or spit defiance at Sena
tors. They have a mighty faith
in the Liberal creed, and write
learned articles for scholarly
journals.
Why do the Tight-lips fail as
leaders of the university? Be
cause they take everything to
heart. They lose their cool. They
inspire hate. When a Tight-lip
is trying to push a reform past
the conservative faculty, he
steps on toes. When radical stu
dents find quarrel in a straw
and sit-in, a Tight-lip covers his
eyes with a blindfold called
"Principle" and finds himself
voted down by the students,
faculty, and even the Patriarchs.
The Patriarchs, you see, are
skilled at using the Tight-lips
to do their dirty work.
Standard sputters along, alter
nately stymied by the Patri
arch's complacency and torn by
the Tight-lip's artlessness. But
there is hope. The head Patri
arch will retire. The Board of
Patriarches is looking for a suc
cessor. With luck, they might
find a wise man.
For their benefit I will de
scribe the wise man they should
seek. I know of whom I speak,
because he is my second cousin
in Ogden, Utah, presently em
ployed as a fishmonger. But I
will let the Patriarchs of Stan
dard find him out by my clues.
Young Old Man
He is a very young old man,
who can out-patriarch a Patri
arch but also has some fast
friends in the freshman dorm.

He has brilliant scholarly cre
dentials, but having realized
that immersion in dead things
eventually brings spiritual death,
he has put aside his scholarly
speciality in favor of the world
of people and change.
Like the Patriarchs, he has
unshakeable calm. And like the
Tight-lips, he listens eagerly. He
is a cagey judge of men, using
them skillfully for his half-sec
ret, radical ends. He knows well
what the Tight-lips are good for,
and has a whole provost's office
full of them. Inspired by his
blessing, the Tight-lips use their
furious energy to raise mil
lions for Standard, get General
Hershey fired, charm the Secre
tary of Health, Education and
Welfare, and draw up a ten-year
master plan to shift Standard's
emphasis from research to
teaching. The President just
makes sure his Tight-lips don't
take defeats too much to heart.
He teaches them grace.
Meanwhile he keeps the Board
of Patriarchs happy by having
lunch with them once a month
and laughing about the latest
fraternity pranks.
And when student radicals
seize the dean's office in frustra
tion at the world's inertia, the
President debates with them
there for seven hours in his
shirt-sleeves. He is loved. The
radicals stop sitting-in and start
trying to win their battles with
reason.
Because he is wise, the Presi
dent knows he must be a cat
alyst for the pervasive forces
of change in the university. Dol
lars, buildings, fame and pres
tige he sees as mere tools to the
liberation of human minds.
