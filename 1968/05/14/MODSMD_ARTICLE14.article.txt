### 
Dr. Ralph Abernathy is ex
pected to lead a rally tomorrow
in San Francisco foV the Bay
Area Poor People's Campaign.
On Thursday, several hundred
poor people from the Bay Area
and Central Valley will be
bussed to Washington, D.C.
There over 3,000 poor people
from all over the nation will
take part in the second phase
of the Southern Christian Lead
ership Conference's Poor Peo
ple's Campaign.
The late Dr. Martin Luther
King envisioned the campaign
as follows:
"We will go there, we will
demand to be heard, and we will
stay until America responds. . .
We hope, with growing confi
dence, that our camapign in
Washington will receive at first
a sympathetic understanding
across the nation, followed by
dramatic expansion of nonvio
lent demonstrations in Wash
ington and simultaneous pro
tests elsewhere.

"In short, we will be petition
ing our government for specific
reforms, and we intend to build
militant nonviolent actions until
that government moves against
poverty."
Dr. AbematTiy considers stu
dents important for having "pro
vided great moral and intellec
tual support for human rights

movements in the past."
"It was the students who were
the shock troops throughout the
sit-ins, freedom rides, and Birm
ingham and Selma movements.
We are now confident that they
will join their poor brothers and
sisters of all races, faiths, and
nationalities in this campaign,"
he said.
