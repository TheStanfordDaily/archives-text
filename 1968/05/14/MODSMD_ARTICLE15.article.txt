Stanford Band Shack with foul
smelling hydrogen sulfide gas in
a raid last Saturday night.
Armed with a sledge-hammer,
pliers, screwdriver, hacksaw,
copper wire, three smoke bombs,
hydrochloric acid and several
ounces of ferric sulfide, the two
tried to break in through a win

used masking tape to prevent
the burglar alarm from sound
ing. ,
But the alarm went off despite
their precautions and drew two
Stanford policemen who were
patrolling the area.
One of the Cal freshmen then
hopped into his car and sped
off towards Campus Drive.
After a short chase, he was ap
prehended by the campus police.
The other walked to Town
and Country Village and called
his parents. He later turned him
self in at the Stanford Police
Station.
Both intruders confessed their

guilt, wrote statements and
were released, according to the
Stanford Police Department.
One of the statements ex
plained that "the best and quick
est way to show our dislike of
the Stanford Band was to ren
der their Band Shack unsuitable
for human habitation."
A report will be sent to the
University of California for fur
ther disciplinary action. The
Stanford Band will decide
whether to press burglary
charges.
The incident was the second
of its kind this month. On May
4, $60 to $70 worth of trophies,
banners and photographs were
taken from the Shack. A letter
was left offering to exchange
the stolen items for Cal Band
uniforms and a trophy allegedly
taken by members of the Stan
ford Band.

ual Stanford Band members
