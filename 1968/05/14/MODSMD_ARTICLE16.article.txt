# Gold Price Causes Inflation
## 
### 
The nation's only way out of
its present inflationary mess
may well be to raise the price
of gold, Prof. Arthur R. Burns,
former chairman of the Presi
dent's Council of Economic Ad
visers, suggested recently.
Prof. Burns, visiting professor
of economics at Stanford, ac
knowledged that this maneuver
would almost certainly be sub
ject to political criticism and in
addition, would allow a reaping

of windfall profits by such na
tions as Russia, China, France,
South Africa and thousands of
private speculators.
"When a nation permits its
economy to become engulfed in
inflation," he said in a campus
interview, "policy makers no
longer have any good choices.
This is the tough legacy and the
chief peril of inflation."
He described the President's
suggested 10 percent surcharge
on income tax as more symbolic
than realistic, and indicates the
Administration is "showing
some willingness to curb ex
penditures in the interests of in
ducing the Congress to accept
the IX) percent surcharge. . "
But the power of the sur
charge, he said, "has been ex
aggerated. . . Not many corpora
tions will revise downward their
capital exepnditure plans just
because of a temporary 10 per
cent increase in their income
tax.
Rather, he said, "the effect of
the tax surcharge will be greater
on consumer spending. . . A
large part of the increase in
personal tax payments will
probably be at the expense of
savings."
Actually, the inflationary eco
nomic conditions and the bad
balance-of-payments situation of
today can't be blamed entirely
on the Vietnam war, Prof. Burns
said. It all began about 1964,
when the economic system and

world trade were in good bal
ance. The administration failed
to take the necessary safe
guards when the Vietnam war
impact began to be felt in 1965,
the former Presidential adviser
said.
Prices of raw materials, the
wholesale index and other eco
nomic weathervanes began in
creasing as early as 1963. The
full blame, he said, lies with the
Johnson administration, because
"in 1965, when the economy was
already advancing rapidly, the
government accelerated the ap
plication of monetary and fiscal
stimuli,"instead of moving grad
ually toward a policy of re
straint."
"Practically every weapon in
the arsenal of economic stimu
lation was released during 1965,"
he said. "In that year, we had
the second installment of the
cut in personal income taxes en
acted in 1964. In that year, the
second installment of the cut in
corporate income taxes also be
came effective."
Also simultaneously, excise
taxes were reduced, spending in
the "Great Society" program
was increased, and both money
supply and bank credit were
stepped up. "All this happened
despite the exapnsion of federal
spending on behalf of Vietnam,"
Prof. Burns stressed.
Governmental promises that
once full employment was ap
proached, total demand would

not be allowed to rise faster
than productive capacity were
not fulfilled, and the federal
budget deficit has continued to
mount, he pointed out.
"It is this growth of an ac
celerating money supply and an
increasingly expansionist fiscal
policy that is the basic cause
of the wage price-spiral we have
been experiencing. The federal
government has pursued an in
creasingly expansionist policy in
the face of practically full em
ployment and a soaring price
level."
In addition to the overall bad
effects of inflation, Prof. Burns
added, it is especially unjust to
the poor, whose savings ac
counts, insurance policies and
government bonds are devalu
ated by the lessening value of
the dollar.
Furthermore, inflation has
hurt our foreign trade and
caused an international loss of
confidence in the U.S. dollar for
the first time since 1933.
He suggested that it was un
realistic to imagine a genuine
program of austerity for the
U.S., but that a reduction in
government expenditures, in
cluding a speedy conclusion to
the war in Vietnam, would be
a "more potent device" for re
straining total demand. "But
there is little prospect of cutting
expenditures in the present pol
itical climate," he added.

charge, he said, "has been ex
aggerated. . . Not many corpora
tions will revise downward their
capital exepnditure plans just
because of a temporary 10 per
cent increase in their income
tax.
Rather, he said, "the effect of
the tax surcharge will be greater
on consumer spending. . . A
large part of the increase in
personal tax payments will
probably be at the expense of
savings."
Actually, the inflationary eco
nomic conditions and the bad
balance-of-payments situation of
today can't be blamed entirely
on the Vietnam war, Prof. Burns
said. It all began about 1964,
when the economic system and

world trade were in good bal
ance. The administration failed
to take the necessary safe
guards when the Vietnam war
impact began to be felt in 1965,
the former Presidential adviser
said.
Prices of raw materials, the
wholesale index and other eco
nomic weathervanes began in
creasing as early as 1963. The
full blame, he said, lies with the
Johnson administration, because
"in 1965, when the economy was
already advancing rapidly, the
government accelerated the ap
plication of monetary and fiscal
stimuli,"instead of moving grad
ually toward a policy of re
straint."
"Practically every weapon in
the arsenal of economic stimu
lation was released during 1965,"
he said. "In that year, we had
the second installment of the
cut in personal income taxes en
acted in 1964. In that year, the
second installment of the cut in
corporate income taxes also be
came effective."
Also simultaneously, excise
taxes were reduced, spending in
the "Great Society" program
was increased, and both money
supply and bank credit were
stepped up. "All this happened
despite the exapnsion of federal
spending on behalf of Vietnam,"
Prof. Burns stressed.
Governmental promises that
once full employment was ap
proached, total demand would

not be allowed to rise faster
than productive capacity were
not fulfilled, and the federal
budget deficit has continued to
mount, he pointed out.
"It is this growth of an ac
celerating money supply and an
increasingly expansionist fiscal
policy that is the basic cause
of the wage price-spiral we have
been experiencing. The federal
government has pursued an in
creasingly expansionist policy in
the face of practically full em
ployment and a soaring price
level."
In addition to the overall bad
effects of inflation, Prof. Burns
added, it is especially unjust to
the poor, whose savings ac
counts, insurance policies and
government bonds are devalu
ated by the lessening value of
the dollar.
Furthermore, inflation has
hurt our foreign trade and
caused an international loss of
confidence in the U.S. dollar for
the first time since 1933.
He suggested that it was un
realistic to imagine a genuine
program of austerity for the
U.S., but that a reduction in
government expenditures, in
cluding a speedy conclusion to
the war in Vietnam, would be
a "more potent device" for re
straining total demand. "But
there is little prospect of cutting
expenditures in the present pol
itical climate," he added.
The nation's only way out of
its present inflationary mess
may well be to raise the price
of gold, Prof. Arthur R. Burns,
former chairman of the Presi
dent's Council of Economic Ad
visers, suggested recently.
Prof. Burns, visiting professor
of economics at Stanford, ac
knowledged that this maneuver
would almost certainly be sub
ject to political criticism and in
addition, would allow a reaping

of windfall profits by such na
tions as Russia, China, France,
South Africa and thousands of
private speculators.
"When a nation permits its
economy to become engulfed in
inflation," he said in a campus
interview, "policy makers no
longer have any good choices.
This is the tough legacy and the
chief peril of inflation."
He described the President's
suggested 10 percent surcharge
on income tax as more symbolic
than realistic, and indicates the
Administration is "showing
some willingness to curb ex
penditures in the interests of in
ducing the Congress to accept
the IX) percent surcharge. . "

Johnson administration, because
"in 1965, when the economy was
already advancing rapidly, the
government accelerated the ap
plication of monetary and fiscal
stimuli,"instead of moving grad
ually toward a policy of re
straint."
"Practically every weapon in
the arsenal of economic stimu
lation was released during 1965,"
he said. "In that year, we had
the second installment of the
cut in personal income taxes en
acted in 1964. In that year, the
second installment of the cut in
corporate income taxes also be
came effective."
Also simultaneously, excise
taxes were reduced, spending in
the "Great Society" program
was increased, and both money
supply and bank credit were
stepped up. "All this happened
despite the exapnsion of federal
spending on behalf of Vietnam,"
Prof. Burns stressed.
Governmental promises that
once full employment was ap
proached, total demand would

not be allowed to rise faster
than productive capacity were
not fulfilled, and the federal
budget deficit has continued to
mount, he pointed out.
"It is this growth of an ac
celerating money supply and an
increasingly expansionist fiscal
policy that is the basic cause
of the wage price-spiral we have
been experiencing. The federal
government has pursued an in
creasingly expansionist policy in
the face of practically full em
ployment and a soaring price
level."
In addition to the overall bad
effects of inflation, Prof. Burns
added, it is especially unjust to
the poor, whose savings ac
counts, insurance policies and
government bonds are devalu
ated by the lessening value of
the dollar.
Furthermore, inflation has
hurt our foreign trade and
caused an international loss of
confidence in the U.S. dollar for
the first time since 1933.
He suggested that it was un
realistic to imagine a genuine
program of austerity for the
U.S., but that a reduction in
government expenditures, in
cluding a speedy conclusion to
the war in Vietnam, would be
a "more potent device" for re
straining total demand. "But
there is little prospect of cutting
expenditures in the present pol
itical climate," he added.
