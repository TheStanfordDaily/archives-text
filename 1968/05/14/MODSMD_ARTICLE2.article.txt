# Drake vs. Hayes
## ASSU Race Starts Today 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
The two-day final ASSU elec
tion begins today at five poll
ing places across campus with
a number of hotly contested is
sues on the ballot.
Polls will be open from 8:30
a.m. until 4:30 p.m. at engineer
ing corner, the physics tank,
and two locations on White Me
morial Plaza. There will be a
fifth "roving poll" at the Busi
ness School from 8:30 a.m. till
12:30 p.m. and at history corner
from 12:30 to 4:30 this after
noon.
Of central attention in the
voting will be the run-off race
for ASSU president between
topless dancer Vicky Drake and
Denis Hayes, current vice-presi
dent and chairman of the consti
tutional convention held this
spring.
There are a number of candi
dates seeking Women's Recrea
tion Association positions as a
result of write-in votes in last
week's primary election.
Five of the eight initiative
questions on the ballot offer the
voter three choices in regards
to student government—adopt
ing the proposed constitution
and by laws, maintaining the
current constitution and by
laws, or abolishing ASSU.
Two of the initiative ques
tions arise out of the events
surrounding last week's sit-in in
the Old Union. The first calls
"the use of force in seeking
change contrary to the spirit of
an academic community."
The second of these initiative

questions seeks the censure of
ASSU Cesare Massarenti for
"advocating and participating in
the forcible occupation of a Uni
versity building" during the sit
in.
The final initiative proposes
that the Firehouse be utilized as
a "student operated coffeehouse"
when the fire department moves
to its new location this summer.
Elections Commissioner Craig
Brown has requested students
to note on their ballots whether
they wish to abstain on the in
itiative questions. Changes in
the student government require
two-thirds of the vote cast on
the question.
The text of the proposed con
stitution and by-laws and the
eight initiative questions appear
on pages four and five of to
day's Daily.
Despite the lack of serious de
bate between the candidates be
fore the primary, almost half of
the student body turned out to
vote in that election.
Denis Hayes, who polled 1200
votes to Vicky Drakes' 1500, in
dicated that he was surprised
by the large amount of student
response to his "low key cam
paign."
Since that time Hayes has
put out a number of position
papers attempting to stress
what he calls the "preservation
of constructive criticism and
real student involvement in the
process of change."
Miss Drake, whose real name
is Vicky Bowles and whose
father is a chaplain at the State
Penitentiary in Soledad, Cali
fornia, has based most of her

campaign on the nation-wide
publicity that has followed her
electioneering.
Interviews by four radio sta
tions, four TV stations, and a
number of newspapers on the
second day of her campaign left
her "confused," Miss Drake said.
Miss Drake said then that
since her campaign was "in the
tradition of the RF," she would
not be speaking around campus.
"My style is more conversa
tional," Miss Drake has said. A
Wilbur sponsor who watched
one of he more than 40 per
formances on campus referred
to the style as one of "visual
utterances."
Hayes hopes to gain student
appointments to the trustee's

presidential selection committee.
He also envisions student rati
fication of the new president in
a campus-wide referendum.
Hayes has proposed a number
of programs which he feels will
provide the student body with
an "atmosphere of awareness."
"The important thing," he feels,
"is that students see themselves
as having a real influence on
change."
Although Miss Drake claims
the initial format of her cam
paign has not changed, since
Sunday she has indicated that
she will not make any committee
or commission appointments ex
cept from a student union,
which would parallel the cur
rent ASSU structure.

Despite the lack of serious de

fore the primary, almost half of
the student body turned out to
vote in that election.
Denis Hayes, who polled 1200
votes to Vicky Drakes' 1500, in
dicated that he was surprised
by the large amount of student
response to his "low key cam
paign."
Since that time Hayes has
put out a number of position
papers attempting to stress
what he calls the "preservation
of constructive criticism and
real student involvement in the
process of change."
Miss Drake, whose real name
is Vicky Bowles and whose
father is a chaplain at the State
Penitentiary in Soledad, Cali
fornia, has based most of her

campaign on the nation-wide
publicity that has followed her
electioneering.
Interviews by four radio sta
tions, four TV stations, and a
number of newspapers on the
second day of her campaign left
her "confused," Miss Drake said.
Miss Drake said then that
since her campaign was "in the
tradition of the RF," she would
not be speaking around campus.
"My style is more conversa
tional," Miss Drake has said. A
Wilbur sponsor who watched
one of he more than 40 per
formances on campus referred
to the style as one of "visual
utterances."
Hayes hopes to gain student
appointments to the trustee's

presidential selection committee.
He also envisions student rati
fication of the new president in
a campus-wide referendum.
Hayes has proposed a number
of programs which he feels will
provide the student body with
an "atmosphere of awareness."
"The important thing," he feels,
"is that students see themselves
as having a real influence on
change."
Although Miss Drake claims
the initial format of her cam
paign has not changed, since
Sunday she has indicated that
she will not make any committee
or commission appointments ex
cept from a student union,
which would parallel the cur
rent ASSU structure.
The two-day final ASSU elec
tion begins today at five poll
ing places across campus with
a number of hotly contested is
sues on the ballot.
Polls will be open from 8:30
a.m. until 4:30 p.m. at engineer
ing corner, the physics tank,
and two locations on White Me
morial Plaza. There will be a
fifth "roving poll" at the Busi
ness School from 8:30 a.m. till
12:30 p.m. and at history corner
from 12:30 to 4:30 this after
noon.
Of central attention in the
voting will be the run-off race
for ASSU president between
topless dancer Vicky Drake and
Denis Hayes, current vice-presi
dent and chairman of the consti
tutional convention held this
spring.
There are a number of candi
dates seeking Women's Recrea
tion Association positions as a
result of write-in votes in last
week's primary election.
Five of the eight initiative
questions on the ballot offer the
voter three choices in regards
to student government—adopt
ing the proposed constitution
and by laws, maintaining the
current constitution and by
laws, or abolishing ASSU.
Two of the initiative ques
tions arise out of the events
surrounding last week's sit-in in
the Old Union. The first calls
"the use of force in seeking
change contrary to the spirit of
an academic community."
The second of these initiative

questions seeks the censure of
ASSU Cesare Massarenti for
"advocating and participating in
the forcible occupation of a Uni
versity building" during the sit
in.
The final initiative proposes
that the Firehouse be utilized as
a "student operated coffeehouse"
when the fire department moves
to its new location this summer.
Elections Commissioner Craig
Brown has requested students
to note on their ballots whether
they wish to abstain on the in
