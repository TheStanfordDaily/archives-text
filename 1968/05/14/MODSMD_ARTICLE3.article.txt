# Student Leaders Comment On Revision Of Legislature
## 
### 
The pending vote on the new
ASSU constitution has evoked
comments from several student
government leaders.
Cesare Massaranti, ASSU
president, is "uncertain" about
the merits of the new constitu
tion and expresses "deep reser
vations." He asserts that like
its predecessor, it does not prop
erly define the role of student
government. Massarenti also ob
jects to the "division of respon
sibility between the ASSU presi
dent and the financial director."
Denis Hayes, ASSU presiden
tial hopeful, is an enthusiastic

proponent of the new constitu
tion. He considers the replace
ment of the 150-seat Legislature
with a 28-member Senate, an im
provement which will permit
more efficient management of
the Association's funds and
agencieis.
According to Hayes, the new
constitution provides a "finan
cial structure which gives the
government the kind of auton
omy it should and must have."
Michael Weinstein, speaker of
LASSU, states the document
should be defeated because
enough time has been

allowed to adequately discuss it.
Weinstein also objects that
some of the sections are based
on assumptions. For example,
the constitution empowers the
students to set fees, yet he be
lieves this right is not neces
sarily granted by the adminis
tration.
A particularly controversial
section of the now constitution
is the provision which makes
the vice-president of the Associ
ation the presiding officer of the
Senate.
Both Massarenti and Wein
stein maintain the proposal is
"dangerous because it removes
a check on the executive by the
legislature. Weinstein fears it
will provide a greater opportun
ity for one individual to "mold"
government to his own person
ality.
Denis Hayes, however, finds
this feature of the constitution
advantageous because it will
"reduce squabbles and focus at
tention on issues rather than
perscm ality."
