## Thuy Blasts U.S. Policies 
### 
PARIS (AP) — Formal peace
talks got under way Monday in
Paris with North Vietnamese
ambassador Thuy denouncing
America's role in Vietnam.
"To say that the northern part
of Vietnam carries out aggres
sion against the southern part of
Vietnam," he argued at one
point, "is tantamount to saying
that Washington . . . carries out
aggression against New York.
"Vietnam is one, the Viet
namese nation is one."
United States Ambassador-at
large W. Averell Harriman's im
mediate reaction to much of
this during the three-hour and
15-minute session was frigid.
"You have raised this morn
ing many matters in a manner
and in substance with which we
disagree or which we complete
ly reject," he said. "I will not
today answer your allegations
but will make an affirmative
statement Wednesday which we
hope will contribute to progress
toward the objective that brings
us here."
The duel between Thuy and
Harrimon now seems to center
on one immediate issue:
Are the talks to dwell only on
arrangements for ending U.S.
military actions against the
North as Thuy insists—or are
they to range far and wide over
the main elements of a political
steelement as Harriman wants?

• Paris Demonstration
PARIS (AP) — Hundreds of
thousands of protestors against
the De Gaulle regime surged
through the heart of Paris Mon
day in the climax of a day of
general strike and demonstra
tions across France. The pro
tests seemed a success, but
strike effects were so spotty it
was often difficult to tell one
was on.
Workers, students, people of
all ages and classes marched
for three miles amid chants for
President Charles de Gaulle to
resign and cries of "De Gaulle
assassin! DeGaulle assassin!"
It was the largest people's pa
rade through Paris in memory
and the strongest such demon
stration against De Gaulle's 10-
year-old Fifth Republic.
De Gaulle's government took
steps to see to it that the Paris
demonstration was kept as
peaceful as possible. Premier
Georges Pompidou bowed to
student demands and granted a
number of concession, includ
ing freeing the last 28 students
held by police in the aftermath
of recent student rioting.
• Panel For Columbia
NEW YORK (AP) — A blue
ribbon panel headed by former
U.S. Solicitor General Archibald
Cox opened hearings Monday
into the "why" of the turmoil at

Columbia University, but rebel
students refused to testify.
Cox said the fact finders plan
a "broad and far-reaching in
quiry" into the Columbia dem
onstrations.
The hearing opened with the
refusal of two student groups to
testify. Spokesmen for a group
called Black Students from
Hamilton Hall said the absence
of representatives of the Negro
community indicated the "un
impartiality" of the commis
sion. The Student Strike Coordi
nating Committee claimed the
panel has "little relation to the
broader body of university fac
ulty and no relation to the stu
dents of the university."
The student strikers said in a
statement that the panel's func
tion was "to divert attention
from the issues and to channel
energy into safe areas." They
said "the administration would
rather obscure the issues than
confront them here."
The five - man panel was
named May 5 by the executive
committee of the Columbia fac
ulty. The committee asked the
panel to establish the chronolo
gy of events that led the dis
turbances and to look into the
underlying causes of the prob
lems.
• Poor People's March
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Poor People's Campaign raised

its wooden camp on a lawn by
the Lincoln Memorial Monday
to begin what its leaders say
will be a summer-long siege of
Congress.
The Rev. Ralph David Aber
nathy promised protestors,
"We're going to plague the
pharaohs of this nation, with
plague after plague, until they
agree to give us meaningful
jobs and a guaranteed annual
income."
About 400 demonstrators
chanted "Freedom!" with each
blow of the hammer as Aber
nathy drove the first nail for the
tent-shaped plywood dwellings
that will house the throng of
marchers convering on the na
tion's capital.
Abernathy will meet with law
makers Wednesday to present
in more detail the legislative
goals of the campaign, it was
announced Monday.
A bipartisan, biracial comit
tee of four congressmen and
senators invited Abernathy to
detail his aims.
• Stocks Level Off
NEW YORK (AP) — After
a nearly vertical ascent for six
weeks this spring, the market
faltered last week, and Monday's
session was more of the same,
analysts said.
The Dow Jones industrial av
erage dropped 2.95 to 909.96.

into the "why" of the turmoil at

Columbia University, but rebel
students refused to testify.
Cox said the fact finders plan
a "broad and far-reaching in
quiry" into the Columbia dem
onstrations.
The hearing opened with the
refusal of two student groups to
testify. Spokesmen for a group
called Black Students from
Hamilton Hall said the absence
of representatives of the Negro
community indicated the "un
impartiality" of the commis
sion. The Student Strike Coordi
nating Committee claimed the
panel has "little relation to the
broader body of university fac
ulty and no relation to the stu
dents of the university."
The student strikers said in a
statement that the panel's func
tion was "to divert attention
from the issues and to channel
energy into safe areas." They
said "the administration would
rather obscure the issues than
confront them here."
The five - man panel was
named May 5 by the executive
committee of the Columbia fac
ulty. The committee asked the
panel to establish the chronolo
gy of events that led the dis
turbances and to look into the
underlying causes of the prob
lems.
• Poor People's March
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Poor People's Campaign raised

its wooden camp on a lawn by
the Lincoln Memorial Monday
to begin what its leaders say
will be a summer-long siege of
Congress.
The Rev. Ralph David Aber
nathy promised protestors,
"We're going to plague the
pharaohs of this nation, with
plague after plague, until they
agree to give us meaningful
jobs and a guaranteed annual
income."
About 400 demonstrators
chanted "Freedom!" with each
blow of the hammer as Aber
nathy drove the first nail for the
tent-shaped plywood dwellings
that will house the throng of
marchers convering on the na
tion's capital.
Abernathy will meet with law
makers Wednesday to present
in more detail the legislative
goals of the campaign, it was
announced Monday.
A bipartisan, biracial comit
tee of four congressmen and
senators invited Abernathy to
detail his aims.
• Stocks Level Off
NEW YORK (AP) — After
a nearly vertical ascent for six
weeks this spring, the market
faltered last week, and Monday's
session was more of the same,
analysts said.
The Dow Jones industrial av
erage dropped 2.95 to 909.96.
PARIS (AP) — Formal peace
talks got under way Monday in
Paris with North Vietnamese
ambassador Thuy denouncing
America's role in Vietnam.
"To say that the northern part
of Vietnam carries out aggres
sion against the southern part of
Vietnam," he argued at one
point, "is tantamount to saying
that Washington . . . carries out
aggression against New York.
"Vietnam is one, the Viet
namese nation is one."
United States Ambassador-at
large W. Averell Harriman's im
mediate reaction to much of
this during the three-hour and
15-minute session was frigid.
"You have raised this morn
ing many matters in a manner
and in substance with which we
disagree or which we complete
ly reject," he said. "I will not
today answer your allegations
but will make an affirmative
statement Wednesday which we
hope will contribute to progress
toward the objective that brings
us here."
The duel between Thuy and
Harrimon now seems to center
on one immediate issue:
Are the talks to dwell only on
arrangements for ending U.S.
military actions against the
North as Thuy insists—or are
they to range far and wide over
the main elements of a political
steelement as Harriman wants?

• Paris Demonstration
PARIS (AP) — Hundreds of
thousands of protestors against
the De Gaulle regime surged
through the heart of Paris Mon
day in the climax of a day of
general strike and demonstra
tions across France. The pro
tests seemed a success, but
strike effects were so spotty it
was often difficult to tell one
was on.
Workers, students, people of
all ages and classes marched
for three miles amid chants for
President Charles de Gaulle to
resign and cries of "De Gaulle
assassin! DeGaulle assassin!"
It was the largest people's pa
rade through Paris in memory
and the strongest such demon
stration against De Gaulle's 10-
year-old Fifth Republic.
De Gaulle's government took
steps to see to it that the Paris
demonstration was kept as
peaceful as possible. Premier
Georges Pompidou bowed to
student demands and granted a
number of concession, includ
ing freeing the last 28 students
held by police in the aftermath
of recent student rioting.

PARIS (AP) — Formal peace
talks got under way Monday in
Paris with North Vietnamese
ambassador Thuy denouncing
America's role in Vietnam.
"To say that the northern part
of Vietnam carries out aggres
sion against the southern part of
Vietnam," he argued at one
point, "is tantamount to saying
that Washington . . . carries out
aggression against New York.
"Vietnam is one, the Viet
namese nation is one."
United States Ambassador-at
large W. Averell Harriman's im
mediate reaction to much of
this during the three-hour and
15-minute session was frigid.
"You have raised this morn
ing many matters in a manner
and in substance with which we
disagree or which we complete
ly reject," he said. "I will not
today answer your allegations
but will make an affirmative
statement Wednesday which we
hope will contribute to progress
toward the objective that brings
us here."
The duel between Thuy and
Harrimon now seems to center
on one immediate issue:
Are the talks to dwell only on
arrangements for ending U.S.
military actions against the
North as Thuy insists—or are
they to range far and wide over
the main elements of a political
steelement as Harriman wants?

• Paris Demonstration
PARIS (AP) — Hundreds of
thousands of protestors against
the De Gaulle regime surged
through the heart of Paris Mon
day in the climax of a day of
general strike and demonstra
tions across France. The pro
tests seemed a success, but
strike effects were so spotty it
was often difficult to tell one
was on.
Workers, students, people of
all ages and classes marched
for three miles amid chants for
President Charles de Gaulle to
resign and cries of "De Gaulle
assassin! DeGaulle assassin!"
It was the largest people's pa
rade through Paris in memory
and the strongest such demon
stration against De Gaulle's 10-
year-old Fifth Republic.
De Gaulle's government took
steps to see to it that the Paris
demonstration was kept as
peaceful as possible. Premier
Georges Pompidou bowed to
student demands and granted a
number of concession, includ
ing freeing the last 28 students
held by police in the aftermath
of recent student rioting.
• Panel For Columbia
NEW YORK (AP) — A blue
ribbon panel headed by former
U.S. Solicitor General Archibald
Cox opened hearings Monday
into the "why" of the turmoil at

Columbia University, but rebel
students refused to testify.
Cox said the fact finders plan
a "broad and far-reaching in
quiry" into the Columbia dem
onstrations.
The hearing opened with the
refusal of two student groups to
testify. Spokesmen for a group
called Black Students from
Hamilton Hall said the absence
of representatives of the Negro
community indicated the "un
impartiality" of the commis
sion. The Student Strike Coordi
nating Committee claimed the
panel has "little relation to the
broader body of university fac
ulty and no relation to the stu
dents of the university."
The student strikers said in a
statement that the panel's func
tion was "to divert attention
from the issues and to channel
energy into safe areas." They
said "the administration would
rather obscure the issues than
confront them here."
The five - man panel was
named May 5 by the executive
committee of the Columbia fac
ulty. The committee asked the
panel to establish the chronolo
gy of events that led the dis
turbances and to look into the
underlying causes of the prob
lems.
• Poor People's March
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Poor People's Campaign raised

its wooden camp on a lawn by
the Lincoln Memorial Monday
to begin what its leaders say
will be a summer-long siege of
Congress.
The Rev. Ralph David Aber
nathy promised protestors,
"We're going to plague the
pharaohs of this nation, with
plague after plague, until they
agree to give us meaningful
jobs and a guaranteed annual
income."
About 400 demonstrators
chanted "Freedom!" with each
blow of the hammer as Aber
nathy drove the first nail for the
tent-shaped plywood dwellings
that will house the throng of
marchers convering on the na
tion's capital.
Abernathy will meet with law
makers Wednesday to present
in more detail the legislative
goals of the campaign, it was
announced Monday.
A bipartisan, biracial comit
tee of four congressmen and
senators invited Abernathy to
detail his aims.

a nearly vertical ascent for six

session was more of the same,
analysts said.
