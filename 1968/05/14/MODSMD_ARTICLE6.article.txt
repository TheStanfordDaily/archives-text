# Blacks Greet IFC Pledge With Skeptical Acceptance
## 
### JOHN ALCORN 
Individual blacks on campus
have expressed mixed reactions
to last week's Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC) resolution reaf
firming its policy of non-discrim
ination in all fraternity activities.
The IFC's action has been
viewed as a strong moral step
in a positive direction by some,
while others continue to look at
the resolution and white frater
nities in general with a doubtful
eye regarding the sincerety of
their words.
Charles Countee, co-chair
man of the Black Student
Union, emphasized he was
speaking for himself when he
commented that "the state
ment is certainly good for a
first step, but nonetheless It
is still weak."
Countee, who lives off campus,
remarked that the resolution is
not strong enough regarding the
fraternities' national affiliations.
He declared the action is "utter
ly unenforceable," and probably
"just a reaction to the death of
Martin Luther King."
Although the resolution called
for "member fraternities to in
fluence the policy of their na
tionals on this matter" and stat
ed that the IFC will make sys
tematic reports on the progress
of the individual houses, Coun
tee said, "There is still a hell
of a lot more the IFC can do.
It could tell fraternities which
discriminate that it would recom

mend to the University that
they be suspended."
Keith Naylor, a freshman, has
pledged Alpha Tau Omicron,
which has been local for several
years because of its national's
policy about discrimination. He
wanted to know why such a
stand has not been taken in the
past when some fraternities
have faced expulsion from their
national.
Naylor hoped that "this Is
the real thing, not just a re
action to a certain event." But
he claimed that "this action is
not enough — a statement by
the IFC is fine, but the real
change has to come through
each person."
A black now living in ATO,
Dwayne Rhetta, also agreed that
the resolution is a "fine gesture,"
although he said he could not
predict whether the resolution
would increase the number of
blacks living in fraternities. He
pointed out that "a lot of Ne
groes would feel out of place
in many fraternities even if they
are welcome because so many
fraternities are predominently
white."
Sibby Freeman, a freshman
who has just pledged Theta Del
ta Chi, expressed some displea
sure with the resolution. "I had
hoped the IFC would come out
a bit stronger. In effect, all
they're saying is 'we don't dis
criminate here, and that's nice.' "

viewed as a strong moral step
in a positive direction by some,
while others continue to look at
the resolution and white frater
nities in general with a doubtful
eye regarding the sincerety of
their words.
Charles Countee, co-chair
man of the Black Student
Union, emphasized he was
speaking for himself when he
commented that "the state
ment is certainly good for a
first step, but nonetheless It
is still weak."
Countee, who lives off campus,
remarked that the resolution is
not strong enough regarding the
fraternities' national affiliations.
He declared the action is "utter
ly unenforceable," and probably
"just a reaction to the death of
Martin Luther King."
Although the resolution called
for "member fraternities to in
fluence the policy of their na
tionals on this matter" and stat
ed that the IFC will make sys
tematic reports on the progress
of the individual houses, Coun
tee said, "There is still a hell
of a lot more the IFC can do.
It could tell fraternities which
discriminate that it would recom

mend to the University that
they be suspended."
Keith Naylor, a freshman, has
pledged Alpha Tau Omicron,
which has been local for several
years because of its national's
policy about discrimination. He
wanted to know why such a
stand has not been taken in the
past when some fraternities
have faced expulsion from their
national.
Naylor hoped that "this Is
the real thing, not just a re
action to a certain event." But
he claimed that "this action is
not enough — a statement by
the IFC is fine, but the real
change has to come through
each person."
A black now living in ATO,
Dwayne Rhetta, also agreed that
the resolution is a "fine gesture,"
although he said he could not
predict whether the resolution
would increase the number of
blacks living in fraternities. He
pointed out that "a lot of Ne
groes would feel out of place
in many fraternities even if they
are welcome because so many
fraternities are predominently
white."
Sibby Freeman, a freshman
who has just pledged Theta Del
ta Chi, expressed some displea
sure with the resolution. "I had
hoped the IFC would come out
a bit stronger. In effect, all
they're saying is 'we don't dis
criminate here, and that's nice.' "
Individual blacks on campus
have expressed mixed reactions
to last week's Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC) resolution reaf
firming its policy of non-discrim
ination in all fraternity activities.
