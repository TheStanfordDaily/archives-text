# Alumni Conference To Offer Expanded Program Saturday
## 
### 
Registrations continue to pour
in for this Saturday's campus
conference, which offers the
largest program ever in the
thirty-five year history of bring
ing alumni back to the campus.
According to Jay Johnson,
chairman of this year's confer
ence, organizers hope that the
expansion of this year's pro
gram to include everyone inter
ested in Stanford will give "com
munity leaders, citizens and
members of the staff the same
type of stimulus that alumni
would receive."
A registration frÂ»e of $1 is be
ing charged of all participants.
However, those students who
pre-register in the Bowman
Alumni Office before tomorrow
may attend the day long pro
gram free of charge.
In contrast to the format of
previous conferences where par
ticipants have been offered
speeches by a few professors,

this year there will be featured
130 programs with 143 profes
sors participating.
Philosophy Prof. Philip Rhine
lander, chairman of the alumni
conference presidential commit
tee, said that the variety of pro
grams offered by each of the de
partments will "give alumni a
closer idea of what the uni
versity is."
Another participant in the
program, Prof. Ralph Smith of
the engineering department,
pointed out that even in his de
partment where there is a "con
stant interchange of information
with alumni on a professional
and technological basis," the
conference will provide a unique
opportunity to view many of
the new programs undertaken.
In conjunction with the con
ference. a number of other ac
tivities will be taking place in
the university.
Seven classes will be holding

their reunions, including the
class of 1918's initiation into the
Half Century Club of Stanford
alumni.
President Wallace Sterling
will make his last talk to alumni
before his retirement following
a luncheon in the Oak Grove
behind the Bowman Alumni
House.
The Music Department will
offer an "open rehearsal" per
formance of the third act of
Verdi's "Falstaff" in Dinkelspiel
at 3:15 p.m.
At the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter, the senior class and the
Cardinals Board will sponsor a
Con Home Carnival complete
with 18 major rides and 15 gam
ing booths manned by various
living groups.
According to senior class vice
president Jere Horowitz, orga
nizers of the carnival hope to
double or triple the amount of
money usually raised during
Con Home week.
