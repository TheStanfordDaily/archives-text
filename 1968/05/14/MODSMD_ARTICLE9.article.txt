Stanford University is presented with an unfortunate dilemma
tomorrow, when students vote to elect a new ASSU president.
But the dilemma is not nearly so important as it may seem.
The past two years have shown that no matter what kind of
president we have, not much is accomplished. And what is ac
complished comes not from the ASSU organization but from
students who devote their time to projects that are important to
them. This has been as true of cultural activities as of the sit-in.
The question is not who will be the figurehead for the students.
More pressing is the question of how students, faculty, and ad
ministrators will communicate after what happened in the Old
Union and in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The people who are lurking behind Vicki Drake are generally
unknown, and they supposedly are planning to come forward
with a radical platform to replace Vicki's famous "Nudity for
Lake Lag" plank. Miss Drake's candidacy is therefore an unknown
quantity of questionable worth.
The vapidity of Vicki Drake, who now claims to be a serious
candidate though she has shown no ability to speak coherently
about student problems, and the myopia of Denis Hayes, in his
commitment to the belief that the ASSU can still accomplish any
thing, only highlight the importance of individual students in
keeping lines of communication open on the subjects of judicial
reform, educational reform, presidential selection, and the entire
future of the University.
Last week the politics of confrontation were consistent with
rhe ethos of love. But they may not be at another time.
If you think that voting for Vicky Drake represents a vote
for the Stanford that died with sororities and academic medio
crity, you're wrong. In fact, it means a vote for a semi-rational
platform of University committees without students and blanket
confrontation tactics.
However, Denis Hayes has presented only an elusive picture
of his plans. He seems to have only a limited understanding of
the impotence of the Associated Students. It is as if he wanted
to reform and remake a dead dog.
The faculty have a new consciousness of the importance of
their role in the University as a result of the Academic Council
vote Wednesday. Students can be instrumental in enlarging that
consciousness and working with the faculty to bring about con
structive change here, no matter who is elected to sit in the
office in Tresidder.
What we are aiming for is a community government, and it
is the community that matters — not the people who ostensibly
lead it.
Don't bother voting at all.

However, Denis Hayes has presented only an elusive picture
of his plans. He seems to have only a limited understanding of
the impotence of the Associated Students. It is as if he wanted
to reform and remake a dead dog.
The faculty have a new consciousness of the importance of
their role in the University as a result of the Academic Council
vote Wednesday. Students can be instrumental in enlarging that
consciousness and working with the faculty to bring about con
structive change here, no matter who is elected to sit in the
office in Tresidder.
What we are aiming for is a community government, and it
is the community that matters — not the people who ostensibly
lead it.
Don't bother voting at all.
Stanford University is presented with an unfortunate dilemma
tomorrow, when students vote to elect a new ASSU president.
But the dilemma is not nearly so important as it may seem.
The past two years have shown that no matter what kind of
president we have, not much is accomplished. And what is ac
complished comes not from the ASSU organization but from
students who devote their time to projects that are important to
them. This has been as true of cultural activities as of the sit-in.
The question is not who will be the figurehead for the students.
More pressing is the question of how students, faculty, and ad
ministrators will communicate after what happened in the Old
Union and in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The people who are lurking behind Vicki Drake are generally
unknown, and they supposedly are planning to come forward
with a radical platform to replace Vicki's famous "Nudity for
Lake Lag" plank. Miss Drake's candidacy is therefore an unknown
quantity of questionable worth.
The vapidity of Vicki Drake, who now claims to be a serious
candidate though she has shown no ability to speak coherently
about student problems, and the myopia of Denis Hayes, in his
commitment to the belief that the ASSU can still accomplish any
thing, only highlight the importance of individual students in
keeping lines of communication open on the subjects of judicial
reform, educational reform, presidential selection, and the entire
future of the University.
Last week the politics of confrontation were consistent with
rhe ethos of love. But they may not be at another time.
If you think that voting for Vicky Drake represents a vote
for the Stanford that died with sororities and academic medio
crity, you're wrong. In fact, it means a vote for a semi-rational
platform of University committees without students and blanket
confrontation tactics.
