# Kennedy Wins Nebraska; McCarthy--29 Per Cent

### 
OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy, D-NY swept
to an impressive victory Tues
day in the Nebraska presiden
tial primary, dealing a crushing
blow to his chief ballot rival,
Sen, Eugene J. McCarthy, D-
Minn.
Former Vice President
Richard M. Nixon ran away
with the Republican race,
although California Gov. Ron
ald Reagan surprised by
chalking up nearly a fourth
of the GOP vote.
Kennedy, striving for a ma
jority of the Democratic count
in a state that gave his late
brother, John F. K nnedy the
lowest percentage support in

1960, whirled off to an early
lead. He see-sawed around 50
per cent of the total party vote
with outlying rural areas wh re
he might not be as strong re
maining to be tabulated.
McCarthy said the Nebraska
outcome would not deter him
from trying to bolster his falter
ing drive for the presidential
nomination in the Oregon, Cali
fornia and South Dakota pri
maries
His supporters said In ad
vance that they would be satis
fied with 30 per cent of the
Democratic vote, and that was
about where he was riding as
the tabulation mounted.
The count from 416 of the
2,133 precincts was:
Democratic—Kennedy 19,109,
or 53 per cent of the vote count
ed; McCarthy 10,463, or 29 per
cent; Humphrey 3,678, or 10 per
cent; Johnson 1,917, or 5 per
cent.
Republican—Nixon 23,799, or
69 per cent; Reagan 8,280, or
24 per cent; Rockefeller 1,696, or
5 per cent.
Vice President Hubert H.
Humphrey, who looms as
Kennedy's chief rival for the
nomination, got only about a
tenth of the Democratic vote
on a write In that he publicly
discouraged.
President Johnson, who quit
the contest too late to get his
name off the ballot, was polling
about half of Humphrey's total.
Kenedy said his showing,
plus the votes that went to Mc-

Carthy, made it clear that Dem
ocrats are dissatisfied with
pr sent policies and want to
change the course of the party.
"I would hope, based on what
has happened so far, that we
'wld join together," Kennedy
said, "work together In Oregon
and California."
McCarthy insisted that he
could have done far better in a
contest which matched him and
Kennedy head to head, without
other entrants or write-in cam
paigns.

"We'll go on to Oregon as
we've planned and also to Cali
fornia," he said.
McCarthy said Kennedy never
has indicated what he has in
mind in the suggestion that the
rivals work together—which the
New York senator first made in
announcing his candidacy.
"I don't really know whether
I have to beat him" in the com
ing primaries, McCarthy said of
Kennedy. "Losing one or two I
don't think makes that differ
ence."

The count from 416 of the
2,133 precincts was:
Democratic—Kennedy 19,109,
or 53 per cent of the vote count
ed; McCarthy 10,463, or 29 per
cent; Humphrey 3,678, or 10 per
cent; Johnson 1,917, or 5 per
cent.
Republican—Nixon 23,799, or
69 per cent; Reagan 8,280, or
24 per cent; Rockefeller 1,696, or
5 per cent.
Vice President Hubert H.
Humphrey, who looms as
Kennedy's chief rival for the
nomination, got only about a
tenth of the Democratic vote
on a write In that he publicly
discouraged.
President Johnson, who quit
the contest too late to get his
name off the ballot, was polling
about half of Humphrey's total.
Kenedy said his showing,
plus the votes that went to Mc-

Carthy, made it clear that Dem
ocrats are dissatisfied with
pr sent policies and want to
change the course of the party.
"I would hope, based on what
has happened so far, that we
'wld join together," Kennedy
said, "work together In Oregon
and California."
McCarthy insisted that he
could have done far better in a
contest which matched him and
Kennedy head to head, without
other entrants or write-in cam
paigns.

"We'll go on to Oregon as
we've planned and also to Cali
fornia," he said.
McCarthy said Kennedy never
has indicated what he has in
mind in the suggestion that the
rivals work together—which the
New York senator first made in
announcing his candidacy.
"I don't really know whether
I have to beat him" in the com
ing primaries, McCarthy said of
Kennedy. "Losing one or two I
don't think makes that differ
ence."

OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy, D-NY swept
to an impressive victory Tues
day in the Nebraska presiden
tial primary, dealing a crushing
blow to his chief ballot rival,
Sen, Eugene J. McCarthy, D-
Minn.
Former Vice President
Richard M. Nixon ran away
with the Republican race,
although California Gov. Ron
ald Reagan surprised by
chalking up nearly a fourth
of the GOP vote.
Kennedy, striving for a ma
jority of the Democratic count
in a state that gave his late
brother, John F. K nnedy the
lowest percentage support in

1960, whirled off to an early
lead. He see-sawed around 50
per cent of the total party vote
with outlying rural areas wh re
he might not be as strong re
maining to be tabulated.
McCarthy said the Nebraska
outcome would not deter him
from trying to bolster his falter
ing drive for the presidential
nomination in the Oregon, Cali
fornia and South Dakota pri
maries
His supporters said In ad
vance that they would be satis
fied with 30 per cent of the
Democratic vote, and that was
about where he was riding as
the tabulation mounted.
