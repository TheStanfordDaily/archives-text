# Letter From Mom
## 
### 
(The following Is a copy of
a letter received by freshman
Terry Moore.)
Dear Son,
Although we still have heard
nothing from you, we feel we
have been in touch with you
throughout the week due to all
we've read about Stanford in
the newspapers. Being a some
what typical, conservative par
ent, I must say that none of
what we've read has endeared
the faculty or administration to
us.
Is this why we spent over
$3500 a year — to Rive you the
opportunity to have a topless
dancer as student body presi
dent, gaze at nude pictures of
her plastered all over the cam
pus, have the rules and regula
tions for 11,000 students dictated
by 400 rioters, and be governed
by an administration too spine
less to stand up for any of their
principles!
In the words of Pres. Sterling,
"we accept these provisions with
serious misgivings." Somehow
it would appear that without
much more profound or lengthy
thought he could have come up
with a statement for the press
that would read better than that.
It must be most rewarding to
students to find that it is so easy
to dictate to those supposedly
in charge. Things should be real
ly swinging next year with a
nudist running student affairs
and a handful of rioters run
ning the school administration.
I think this summer a long
hard look should be taken at
the advisability of spending your
father's hard earned money on
this type of education. This year
a minimum outlay of $3600 has
gone to provide you an oppor
tunity to live in an environment
that we should be spending $3600
to guard you against. One is
left with the undesirable im
pression that you are living in
an atmosphere of drugs and
anarchy.
In one year we have provided
you the funds to exist in sur
roundings that I would bolt the
doors against at home — with
the result that you have virtual
ly tossed aside your religion and
could conceivably be on your
way to becoming a long-haired
atheist. This is not a very pretty
picture. And all this in the space

of one year! What can we expect
in four? At the moment, I shud
der to think.
Somehow, I do not take a lot
of pride in saying that our son
is attending Stanford. I prefer
to say that you are at school in
the San Francisco area. (Not
much better, I must admit.)
Surely you and your friends,
in addition to being annoyed
with this letter from a member
of what you must consider "The
Establishment" will have many
good laughs over what a ha-ha
thing it is that your stupid,
fuddy-duddy, back-in-the-middle
ages mother is so far removed
from the scene and where it's at.
So be it. I am not preaching
apple pie, motherhood, and God
Bless America, but I must plead
guilty to preaching respect and
decency and some kind of phi
losophy of moral values.
To me, the current idea of
"When we consider some action
unfair, we sit down and not
budge until we get it," has got to
be stopped somewhere along the
line. To toss over all those old
fashioned, out of date values for
this approach to living just can
not make for a society that will
survive in the long run.
If I understand correctly, cur
rent thought Is that each per
son should be allowed to do his
own "thing" without interference
from anyone. Stanford's "thing"
is definitely not mine, and while
I suppose I should recognize
their right to it, by the same
token we do not give them fin
ancial assistance to continue a
method of operation so foreign
to ours.
In all honesty, I have not
meant this to be a personal at
tack and criticism, but I con
fess that it is an attack on the
school and its administration. I
waited to write until the sit-in
came to an end and the admin
istration came to its well thought
out decision. I've seen it and
I don't like it.
Perhaps on talking with you
this summer, you can enlighten
us more and put this whole
thing in a different perspective.
I sincerely hope so. You can be
assured that we will listen. We
would like so very much to see
your school in a different light
than the one in which we now
see it.
Love, Mother

us.
Is this why we spent over
$3500 a year — to Rive you the
opportunity to have a topless
dancer as student body presi
dent, gaze at nude pictures of
her plastered all over the cam
pus, have the rules and regula
tions for 11,000 students dictated
by 400 rioters, and be governed
by an administration too spine
less to stand up for any of their
principles!
In the words of Pres. Sterling,
"we accept these provisions with
serious misgivings." Somehow
it would appear that without
much more profound or lengthy
thought he could have come up
with a statement for the press
that would read better than that.
It must be most rewarding to
students to find that it is so easy
to dictate to those supposedly
in charge. Things should be real
ly swinging next year with a
nudist running student affairs
and a handful of rioters run
ning the school administration.
I think this summer a long
hard look should be taken at
the advisability of spending your
father's hard earned money on
this type of education. This year
a minimum outlay of $3600 has
gone to provide you an oppor
tunity to live in an environment
that we should be spending $3600
to guard you against. One is
left with the undesirable im
pression that you are living in
an atmosphere of drugs and
anarchy.
In one year we have provided
you the funds to exist in sur
roundings that I would bolt the
doors against at home — with
the result that you have virtual
ly tossed aside your religion and
could conceivably be on your
way to becoming a long-haired
atheist. This is not a very pretty
picture. And all this in the space

of one year! What can we expect
in four? At the moment, I shud
der to think.
Somehow, I do not take a lot
of pride in saying that our son
is attending Stanford. I prefer
to say that you are at school in
the San Francisco area. (Not
much better, I must admit.)
Surely you and your friends,
in addition to being annoyed
with this letter from a member
of what you must consider "The
Establishment" will have many
good laughs over what a ha-ha
thing it is that your stupid,
fuddy-duddy, back-in-the-middle
ages mother is so far removed
from the scene and where it's at.
So be it. I am not preaching
apple pie, motherhood, and God
Bless America, but I must plead
guilty to preaching respect and
decency and some kind of phi
losophy of moral values.
To me, the current idea of
"When we consider some action
unfair, we sit down and not
budge until we get it," has got to
be stopped somewhere along the
line. To toss over all those old
fashioned, out of date values for
this approach to living just can
not make for a society that will
survive in the long run.
If I understand correctly, cur
rent thought Is that each per
son should be allowed to do his
own "thing" without interference
from anyone. Stanford's "thing"
is definitely not mine, and while
I suppose I should recognize
their right to it, by the same
token we do not give them fin
ancial assistance to continue a
method of operation so foreign
to ours.
In all honesty, I have not
meant this to be a personal at
tack and criticism, but I con
fess that it is an attack on the
school and its administration. I
waited to write until the sit-in
came to an end and the admin
istration came to its well thought
out decision. I've seen it and
I don't like it.
Perhaps on talking with you
this summer, you can enlighten
us more and put this whole
thing in a different perspective.
I sincerely hope so. You can be
assured that we will listen. We
would like so very much to see
your school in a different light
than the one in which we now
see it.
Love, Mother

less to stand up for any of their
principles!
In the words of Pres. Sterling,
"we accept these provisions with
serious misgivings." Somehow
it would appear that without
much more profound or lengthy
thought he could have come up
with a statement for the press
that would read better than that.
It must be most rewarding to
students to find that it is so easy
to dictate to those supposedly
in charge. Things should be real
ly swinging next year with a
nudist running student affairs
and a handful of rioters run
ning the school administration.
I think this summer a long
hard look should be taken at
the advisability of spending your
father's hard earned money on
this type of education. This year
a minimum outlay of $3600 has
gone to provide you an oppor
tunity to live in an environment
that we should be spending $3600
to guard you against. One is
left with the undesirable im
pression that you are living in
an atmosphere of drugs and
anarchy.
In one year we have provided
you the funds to exist in sur
roundings that I would bolt the
doors against at home — with
the result that you have virtual
ly tossed aside your religion and
could conceivably be on your
way to becoming a long-haired
atheist. This is not a very pretty
picture. And all this in the space

of one year! What can we expect
in four? At the moment, I shud
der to think.
Somehow, I do not take a lot
of pride in saying that our son
is attending Stanford. I prefer
to say that you are at school in
the San Francisco area. (Not
much better, I must admit.)
Surely you and your friends,
in addition to being annoyed
with this letter from a member
of what you must consider "The
Establishment" will have many
good laughs over what a ha-ha
thing it is that your stupid,
fuddy-duddy, back-in-the-middle
ages mother is so far removed
from the scene and where it's at.
So be it. I am not preaching
apple pie, motherhood, and God
Bless America, but I must plead
guilty to preaching respect and
decency and some kind of phi
losophy of moral values.
To me, the current idea of
"When we consider some action
unfair, we sit down and not
budge until we get it," has got to
be stopped somewhere along the
line. To toss over all those old
fashioned, out of date values for
this approach to living just can
not make for a society that will
survive in the long run.
If I understand correctly, cur
rent thought Is that each per
son should be allowed to do his
own "thing" without interference
from anyone. Stanford's "thing"
is definitely not mine, and while
I suppose I should recognize
their right to it, by the same
token we do not give them fin
ancial assistance to continue a
method of operation so foreign
to ours.
In all honesty, I have not
meant this to be a personal at
tack and criticism, but I con
fess that it is an attack on the
school and its administration. I
waited to write until the sit-in
came to an end and the admin
istration came to its well thought
out decision. I've seen it and
I don't like it.
Perhaps on talking with you
this summer, you can enlighten
us more and put this whole
thing in a different perspective.
I sincerely hope so. You can be
assured that we will listen. We
would like so very much to see
your school in a different light
than the one in which we now
see it.
Love, Mother
