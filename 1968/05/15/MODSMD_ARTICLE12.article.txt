## House Legislation Invites Confusion 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I agree with Mr. Taubman's
column, "A Week that Wasn't."
And if last week was mad and
confusing, this week's no differ
ent. Suddenly, the House of Rep
resentatives passed legislation
which forces the universities to
withhold funds from students
and faculty who participate in
campus sit-ins a"nd "other ille
gal activities." Now what will
happen?
I was pleased to see Provost
Lyman's quick response oppos
ing this legislation. But I was
confused by much of what he
said, such as . . the vote . . .
is unlikely to help the universi
ties in the essential task of re
establishing respect for due pro
cess and freedom from coercion
and intimidation . . ."
What does the provost mean
by "due process"? I take it to
mean the establishment of com
munication and mechanisms
which will lead to the students
and faculty having a genuine
voice in the affairs of the uni
versity and which lead to the
protection of the rights of every
one to free speech and lawful
assembly. But if the House leg
islation becomes law, does "due
process" also mean a University
Court to review political actions
of faculty and students to de
termine whether their actions
are illegal? Does it mean the
establishment of procedures for
reporting these cases to the Fed
eral Government as well?
Mr. Lyman asks for an end to
"coercion and intimidation." By
whom? Of whom? Mr. Lyman

asks the universities to keep
"their houses in order." What
does that mean?
Now is the time for the uni
versity to be united. There must
be discussions and communica
tion between students, faculty,
and administration to face this
threat. We must not let the
House vote scare us into the
kind of confusion and mistrust
which was generated so easily
during the days of Sen. Joseph
McCarthy.

No Time To Debate
ASSU Constitution
Editor, The Dally:
I'd like to register a very
strenuous objection to the way
in which Proposition I—the vote
on the ratification of the new
ASSU Constitution—has been
presented to the students. If a
new constitution is ratified, we
and our successors will pre
sumably have to live with it for
a fairly long time. Yet no one
got around to publishing the
text of the draft in the Daily
until the very day of the ratifi
cation election.
This means that the student
body is required to accept or
reject the draft in its entirety
before the community has ha
any chance to discuss its merits
or point out its potential trouble
spots. For example, Article IV.
Sec. 4 states that the ASSU
"Judicial Council shall have or
iginal jurisdiction in all cases

involving violation of the Fun
damental Standard and all
rules." There is an obvious con
flict here with the recent Cl 5
proposals; this conflict should be
brought out into the open and
settled before a final constitu
tion is ratified. I don't know how
many other such sore spots are
hiding in that mass of print,
but I'd like more time to find
out.
It's too late now to get Propo
sition 1 off the ballot. I only
hope that members of the uni
versity community, in interpret
ing the vote on the Proposition,
will consider how little time we
had to make our decisions. I
hope that, regardless of the out
come, further discussion and re
drafting of the new constitution
will continue. And I sincerely
hope that whoever was respon
sible for this inanity—the ASSU
Elections Commission, the Daily,
the Constitutional Convention
or all three—will in future con
sider communicating a bit more
with their electorate. After all,
we live here too.

A New ASSU JSeeds
To Be Bothered About
Editor, The Dally:
True, ASSU as an organiza
tion has been lacking in recent
years. But at least there is some
one who recognizes this and has
made efforts to change it. The
real dead duck is a community
of "concerned students" who
wait for community crisis to ex
press their concern. The Daily
itself fails to recognize that a
student government (a new
ASSU) can act as a forum for
student interest and open up
channels of communication be
tween the members of the com
munity.
In effect, ASSU is to student
government as the Daily is to
student publications.
In regards to a recent edi
torial—When it comes to read
ing the Daily tomorrow . . .
don't bother!

l\OW 7 Is The Time
For Wonka To Shine
Editor, The Dally:
"Things fall apart; the centre
cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is lossed upon
the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is
loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is
drowned;
The best lack all conviction,
while the worst
Are full of passionate
intensity."
—W. B. Yeats
