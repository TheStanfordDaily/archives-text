## Dollars Wasted On Lectures 
### JACK KAPLAN 
Families around the country
are becoming increasingly con
cerned over the cost of higher
education. Cars, houses, vaca
tions must be sacrificed for four
years at Stanford.
But the money being wasted
in the nation's classrooms does
more harm than merely elimin
ating a few middle class luxur
ies. Universities unnecessarily
devour a huge source of funds
which are desperately needed to
solve pressing public problems.
Courses a t Stanford are
almost always taught primarily
through the most expensive and
inefficient mass presentation
imaginable â€” lectures. Why?
The information is all contained
in books, usually in a clearer
form. Are we so affluent that we
can spend billions of dollars to
pay people to tell us what we
can just as easily read?
Perhaps the half-contact a

student has with a lecturer is
more pleasant than the distance
between him and an author.
Nevertheless, the material can
be learned either way, and it is
senseless to be spending billions
for the luxury of substituting
spoken texts for written texts.
It is especially ridiculous when
the U.S. Congress is cutting
back already inadequate funds
from its poverty programs.
The cost of higher education
is tiny compared to the amount
we lavish on it. We are told
that our tuition, soon to ap
proach $2000, doesn't cover half
the expense. Society, then,
spends at least $4000 per year
on the academic life of each one
of us.
By eliminating superfluous
lectures, thereby eliminating as
well the need to construct and
maintain more and more class
rooms, that figure could be re
duced enormously. Undergrad

uates could easily accumulate
the knowledge necessary for a
degree with, say, a seminar each
quarter, laboratory courses, li
brary and study facilities, fac
ulty and graduate student office
hours, testing procedures and
books.
Some may contend that lec
tures are stimulating, and with
out them students would be
come disinterested. However,
the joyous reaction of any class
to an announcement that a
scheduled lecture has been can
celed should dispel most of
those illusions. Few students
look forward to lectures.
Students are charged a lump
sum tuition they must pay to
acquire a degree and, therefore,
ultimately to obtain a respect
able job. They then may go to
their lectures at no additional
charge.
If, instead, students each class
period had to face squarely the

question, "Is this lecture worth
its cost?", there is little doubt
how the vast majority would
answer.
The average lecture costs
probably between $4 and $7 per
student. If an admission of sev
eral dollars were charged at the
door of each classroom, almost
every student would stay away
from class and learn from his
books.
