## Cure For Social Ills: Fear 
### Mercutio 
The New York state legislature has made
the sale of marijuana to a minor punishable
by up to life imprisonment, the state's
maximum penalty.
It's about time the authorities started
cracking down on our indulgent habits.
Ever since that man in the White House,
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, abandoned all
decency and repealed Prohibition, this coun
try has been sinfully remiss in its moral
duty to encourage temperate habits among
the people.
Naturally the severity of the punish
ment must be suited to the seriousness of
the crime. We are confident the New York
legislature will soon make the sale of cig
arettes to minors, a much more lethal act,
punishable by burning at the stake.
New Panacea
Perhaps New York will teach America
a new panacea to all its problems — moral,
political, racial and economic. The panacea
is fear. If the authorities can make the
consequences of some undesirable act suffi
ciently terrible, may they can control the
errant human soul. George Orwell hinted
to us in 1984 that rigorous codes of be
havior and rigorous punishment may be
the salvation of our soft, immoral society.
At last we can tackle our problems head
on, with no bleeding-heart softness. For a
start, America should overcome its obe-

sity. A law should forbid any citizen from
having a fold of fat anywhere on his body
thicker than one-half inch. Police should be
equipped with calibrators to measure flab.
And for a penalty, how about whipping?
Twenty lashes for the first offense and forty
for each subsequent violation. If flagellation
doesn't cure the offender of overeating, at
least it will ease sexual frustrations.
After whipping posts have been set up
in every city and town, we can turn our
attention to those silly little disorders which
have been plaguing cities and re
cently. An old Southern institution should
be revived to lick this problei" — the
chain gang. Black rioters and student pro
testors should be rounded up and sentenced
to six months at hard labor. If disorders
continue, the hard labor sentences can be
lengthened to a year, five years, and even
tually life. Fear of the chain gang will
bring some sense into the heads of those
nasty rebels.
Pack Them OfT
One social ill after another will vanish as
the chain gangs grow. Urban unemployment
will end. College administrators will never
have to take any back-talk from students.
With a quick phone call to the sheriff,
they can pack off troublemakers to the
chain gang.
Naturally mayors and school deans might

over-use so facile a remedy for the prob
lems of leadership. Several million men
and women might be difficult to employ in
forced labor. In a pinch the authorities can
have the chain-gangs dig holes and fill
them up again. (An economically presti
gious variant of this is called gold-mining.)
But shrewd politicians will try to use the
chain-gangs to overcome yet another of
America's problems air pollution from
automobiles. Prisoners will be rented out
to pull carriages in teams of 20. Admit
tedly a 20-man team is a bit slower than
a V-8, but the timeless appeal of exploiting
one's fellow man will make chain-gang
propulsion a smashing success.
Yes, the New York legislature has set an
invaluable example for America to follow.
When we have solved all our own problems
by repression, we can turn our attention
to the rest of the world. Let's face it: Pax
Romana and Pax Ilritannicu were blessings
to all nations, and consisted essentially of
Rome or Britain applying the mailed fist
to anyone who broke the rules set down
by the dominant power.
America has vacillated tragically sine
1945 in establishing Pax Americana.
Strengthened by the moral rectitude we
shall enforce at home, America must now
keep the rest of the world from selling mari
juana to minors.
