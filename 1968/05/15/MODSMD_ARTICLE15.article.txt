# Letters To The Editor
## Eastern School Opposes Draft 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
A letter has just been sent to
me by my graduate department
at the State University of New
York at Buffalo. The department
proposes sending this letter to
my draft board when I enroll
next Fall. It reads as follows:
"Dear Sirs: The following
resolution was voted by the Fac
ulty Senate of the State Univer
sity of New York at Buffalo on
March 8, 1968 and constitutes
the University's policy on the
draft and deferments: WHERE
AS the War in Vietnam is im
moral, illegal, contrary to Amer
ican principles and to the best
interests of the United States,

and genocidal to the Vietnamese
people; WHEREAS the violent
forces of armed conflict that
lead to destruction and deplora
ble human suffering are not the
effective forces of progress and
development, and the need for
these in Vietnam is questionable
at best; WHEREAS all evidence
points to the severity of the cri
sis that exists in our nation be
tween the affluent and the eco
nomically, educationally, social
ly and politically deprived; AND
WHEREAS these factors, repre
senting the result of a misorder
ing of priorities in our national
interests, are responsible for a
continuing erosion of confidence

in our nation, at home and
abroad;
THEREFORE be is resolved
that the Faculty Senate stands
opposed to military conscription
in any form or of any individual
for the purposes of pursuing
that war; BE IT FURTHER RE
SOLVED that the Faculty Sen
ate of the State University of
New York at Buffalo strongly
urges the President of the Unit
ed States and his Administration
to take all immediate steps to
seek immediate negotiations for
an immediate cessation of armed
conflict and destruction in Viet
nam, immediate de-escalation of
the military forces present and

immediate relief of human suf
fering.
Furthermore, the Faculty
Senate urgently reeofnmends
that all necessary action pro
grams be instituted immediate
ly to relieve the stress and in
dignation existent among the de
prived people of this nation and
thereby, hopefully, avoid further
violent domestic confrontation.
We submit that sueh bold action
is necessary to restore confi
dence in this, our United States
of America. Yours very truly
I wonder if our Academic Sen
ate and University is capable of
a similar stand. Or are we too
involved in that "immoral, ille
gal . . . and genocidal war" to
be able or willing to take a
stand against it?

Hoiv Many Ever Heed
Those Calls For Help?
Editor, The Daily:
I'm not sure who should
really receive this letter, but I
figured this was the easiest way
to reach the most people. I am
speaking only for myself, but
I hope there are others who
feel the same way.
Ron Hatfield killed himself
last week. Indeed, I helped kill
Ron Hatfield. Not because I am
a member of a society that gave
Ron his reasons for taking his
own life. But because I received
his letters, and discussed them
and finally decided he was a
very sick individualâ€”yet did
nothing.
I didn't know Ron, but I've
known several people like him.
They, too screamed and scream
ed that they needed help. Luck
ily, most of them got it before
it was too late.
There will be more Ron Hat
fields. What we must prevent
is the tragic final step that Ron
took. Someone, somehow must
answer the call. And those who
think of suicide, must know that
there are persons whose whole
life is built around answering
such calls.
