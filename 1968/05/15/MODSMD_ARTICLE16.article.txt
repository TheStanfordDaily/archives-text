# The 						Capitol Scenes
## Upping Bobby's Allowance 
### Art Buchwald 
Mrs. Rose Kennedy, mother
of Sen. Robert Kennedy, added
fuel to her son's presidential
campaign when she told a re
porter of Women's Wear Daily
that she saw nothing wrong
with spending a greal deal of
Kennedy money to win the Dem
ocratic nomination.
She was quoted as saying, "It's
our money, and we're free to
spend it any way please . . .
It's part of this campaign busi
ness. If you have the money,
you spend it to win. And the
more you can afford, the more
you'll spend."
Mrs. Kennedy said her family
was no different from the Rocke
fellers. "The Rockefellers are
like us. We both have lots of
money to spend on our cam
paigns."
I can just imagine a telephone
conversation with Mrs. Kennedy
and her son, Robert.
Used It Up
"Hello, Bobby, this is Mother.
I heard you ran out of your al
lowance after the primary in
Indiana, and you're now bor
rowing from Teddy."
"Yes, Mother. I tried to be
careful, but the money just dis
appeared."
"Bobby, you have to be more
careful. I gave you more than
enough money for Indiana and
I was hoping you'd have some
left over Nebraska."
"I'm sorry, Mother, but you
can't imagine what television

time costs these d&ys. And then
the newspapers in Indianapolis
were against me, so I had to
spend money for posters and
outdoor advertising, and before
I knew it, it was gone."
"Now, I don't want to lecture,
Bobby, but you and I agreed
that you would not indulge
yourself in one state. After all,
you still have Oregon and South
Dakota and California to go,
and if you start borrowing mon
ey now from your sisters and
brothers you won't have any left
for the summer."
Rocky Gets More
"But, Mother," Bobby protest
ed, "I think my allowance is too
low. Nelson Rockefeller gets
wtice as much as I do and he
isn't even running in the pri
maries."
"We're not the Rockefellers,
son, and besides, he's older than
you are. I could give you more
money, but I'm trying to teach
you thrift and the value of mon
ey. After all, if you're going to
be President of the United
States, you should have an ap
preciation for the worth of the
dollar."
"Mother, you talk as if I'm
throwing my allowance away.
Every ccnt I spent can be jus
tified. I didn't buy any candy or
soda pop with it. It all went to
the campaign."
Nebraska Cheap?
"I believe you, Bobby. But
there are these terrible stories

the neighbors are spreading that
Rose Kennedy's son is throwing
money around like water. Now
it's none of their business what
we do with our money, but at
the same time I hate to hear
them talking about you this way.
Teddy just called and told me
you're using your Oregon mon
ey in Nebraska. I thought you
told me Nebraska would be
cheap."
"Teddy's a squealer. It's not
true. I'll have plenty of money
left for Oregon. Teddy's just
angry because you gave me
more allowance to run in the
primary in the District of Co
lumbia than you gave him to
run for senator of Massachu
setts."
"I wish you boys would stop
quarreling all the time over al
lowances. But Teddy did make
a good point. If you spend all
your money in the primaries,
you won't have anything left
over to run in the election.
Don't you think you could put
aside a little each week for a
rainy day in November?"
Be More Careful
"I'll try, Mother, but if you
could just give me $100,000 more
a week, I wouldn't have to keep
asking you for money all the
time. All the kids running have
more dough than I do."
"We'll talk about it the next
time I see you. Until then, try
to be a little more careful. You
don't have to buy prime time on
television every time you get
the urge."
"All right, Mother. But in the
meantime, could you let me
have my California primary al
lowance in advance? Ethel's hav
ing another baby."

could just give me $100,000 more
a week, I wouldn't have to keep
asking you for money all the
time. All the kids running have
more dough than I do."
"We'll talk about it the next
time I see you. Until then, try
to be a little more careful. You
don't have to buy prime time on
television every time you get
the urge."
"All right, Mother. But in the

lowance in advance? Ethel's hav

Mrs. Rose Kennedy, mother
of Sen. Robert Kennedy, added
fuel to her son's presidential
campaign when she told a re
porter of Women's Wear Daily
that she saw nothing wrong
with spending a greal deal of
Kennedy money to win the Dem
ocratic nomination.
She was quoted as saying, "It's
our money, and we're free to
spend it any way please . . .
It's part of this campaign busi
ness. If you have the money,
you spend it to win. And the
more you can afford, the more
you'll spend."
Mrs. Kennedy said her family
was no different from the Rocke
fellers. "The Rockefellers are
like us. We both have lots of
money to spend on our cam
paigns."
I can just imagine a telephone
conversation with Mrs. Kennedy
and her son, Robert.

"Hello, Bobby, this is Mother.
I heard you ran out of your al
lowance after the primary in
Indiana, and you're now bor
rowing from Teddy."
"Yes, Mother. I tried to be
careful, but the money just dis
appeared."
"Bobby, you have to be more
careful. I gave you more than
enough money for Indiana and
I was hoping you'd have some
left over Nebraska."
"I'm sorry, Mother, but you
can't imagine what television

time costs these d&ys. And then
the newspapers in Indianapolis
were against me, so I had to
spend money for posters and
outdoor advertising, and before
I knew it, it was gone."
"Now, I don't want to lecture,
Bobby, but you and I agreed
that you would not indulge
yourself in one state. After all,
you still have Oregon and South
Dakota and California to go,
and if you start borrowing mon
ey now from your sisters and
brothers you won't have any left
for the summer."
Rocky Gets More
"But, Mother," Bobby protest
ed, "I think my allowance is too
low. Nelson Rockefeller gets
wtice as much as I do and he
isn't even running in the pri
maries."
"We're not the Rockefellers,
son, and besides, he's older than
you are. I could give you more
money, but I'm trying to teach
you thrift and the value of mon
ey. After all, if you're going to
be President of the United
States, you should have an ap
preciation for the worth of the
dollar."
"Mother, you talk as if I'm
throwing my allowance away.
Every ccnt I spent can be jus
tified. I didn't buy any candy or
soda pop with it. It all went to
the campaign."
Nebraska Cheap?
"I believe you, Bobby. But
there are these terrible stories

the neighbors are spreading that
Rose Kennedy's son is throwing
money around like water. Now
it's none of their business what
we do with our money, but at
the same time I hate to hear
them talking about you this way.
Teddy just called and told me
you're using your Oregon mon
ey in Nebraska. I thought you
told me Nebraska would be
cheap."
"Teddy's a squealer. It's not
true. I'll have plenty of money
left for Oregon. Teddy's just
angry because you gave me
more allowance to run in the
primary in the District of Co
lumbia than you gave him to
run for senator of Massachu
setts."
"I wish you boys would stop
quarreling all the time over al
lowances. But Teddy did make
a good point. If you spend all
your money in the primaries,
you won't have anything left
over to run in the election.
Don't you think you could put
aside a little each week for a

angry because you gave me
more allowance to run in the
primary in the District of Co
lumbia than you gave him to
run for senator of Massachu
setts."
"I wish you boys would stop
quarreling all the time over al
lowances. But Teddy did make
a good point. If you spend all
your money in the primaries,
you won't have anything left
over to run in the election.
Don't you think you could put
aside a little each week for a
rainy day in November?"
Be More Careful
"I'll try, Mother, but if you
could just give me $100,000 more
a week, I wouldn't have to keep
asking you for money all the
time. All the kids running have
more dough than I do."
"We'll talk about it the next
time I see you. Until then, try
to be a little more careful. You
don't have to buy prime time on
television every time you get
the urge."
"All right, Mother. But in the
meantime, could you let me
have my California primary al
lowance in advance? Ethel's hav
ing another baby."

Mrs. Rose Kennedy, mother
of Sen. Robert Kennedy, added
fuel to her son's presidential
campaign when she told a re
porter of Women's Wear Daily
that she saw nothing wrong
with spending a greal deal of
Kennedy money to win the Dem
ocratic nomination.
She was quoted as saying, "It's
our money, and we're free to
spend it any way please . . .
It's part of this campaign busi
ness. If you have the money,
you spend it to win. And the
more you can afford, the more
you'll spend."
Mrs. Kennedy said her family
was no different from the Rocke
fellers. "The Rockefellers are
like us. We both have lots of
money to spend on our cam
paigns."
I can just imagine a telephone
conversation with Mrs. Kennedy
and her son, Robert.
Used It Up
"Hello, Bobby, this is Mother.
I heard you ran out of your al
lowance after the primary in
Indiana, and you're now bor
rowing from Teddy."
"Yes, Mother. I tried to be
careful, but the money just dis
appeared."
"Bobby, you have to be more
careful. I gave you more than
enough money for Indiana and
I was hoping you'd have some
left over Nebraska."
"I'm sorry, Mother, but you
can't imagine what television

time costs these d&ys. And then
the newspapers in Indianapolis
were against me, so I had to
spend money for posters and
outdoor advertising, and before
I knew it, it was gone."
"Now, I don't want to lecture,
Bobby, but you and I agreed
that you would not indulge
yourself in one state. After all,
you still have Oregon and South
Dakota and California to go,
and if you start borrowing mon
ey now from your sisters and
brothers you won't have any left
for the summer."
Rocky Gets More
"But, Mother," Bobby protest
ed, "I think my allowance is too
low. Nelson Rockefeller gets
wtice as much as I do and he
isn't even running in the pri
maries."
"We're not the Rockefellers,
son, and besides, he's older than
you are. I could give you more
money, but I'm trying to teach
you thrift and the value of mon
ey. After all, if you're going to
be President of the United
States, you should have an ap
preciation for the worth of the
dollar."
"Mother, you talk as if I'm
throwing my allowance away.
Every ccnt I spent can be jus
tified. I didn't buy any candy or
soda pop with it. It all went to
the campaign."
Nebraska Cheap?
"I believe you, Bobby. But
there are these terrible stories

the neighbors are spreading that
Rose Kennedy's son is throwing
money around like water. Now
it's none of their business what
we do with our money, but at
the same time I hate to hear
them talking about you this way.
Teddy just called and told me
you're using your Oregon mon
ey in Nebraska. I thought you
told me Nebraska would be
cheap."
"Teddy's a squealer. It's not
true. I'll have plenty of money
left for Oregon. Teddy's just
angry because you gave me
more allowance to run in the
primary in the District of Co
lumbia than you gave him to
run for senator of Massachu
setts."
"I wish you boys would stop
quarreling all the time over al
lowances. But Teddy did make
