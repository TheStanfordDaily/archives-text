# Campus Pot Busts On Upswing

### PHIL SEMAS 
WASHINGTON (CPS) — Ar
rests for possession of mari
juana are becoming as common
as protests on many campuses.
No one knows exactly how
many there have been. A com
pilation by the National Student
Association lists 90 raids involv
ing 333 persons, most of them
college students arrested for pos
session, during the four month
period from Nov. 2, 1967, to Feb.
23.
An informal survey by CPS
turned up an additional 21 busts
involving more than 100 stu
dents during the present aca
demic year.
The most famous bust was
at the State University of
New York at Stony Brook
where students were rousted
out of bed Just before dawn in
a police raid complete with
extensive on-the-spot press
coverage.
But Stony Brook is not the
only college to face the pre dawn
raid tactic. At Bard College in
New York police stormed onto
the campus at 1 a.m., setting up
road blocks, searching dorms
and rousting students out of bed.
They arrested 34 students, 14 on
drug possession charges, the
rest on charges from drunk
driving to harrassing an officer.
Two New Hampshire colleges,
Franconia and Keene State, have
felt the brunt of the pre-dawn
tactics. So has American Univer
sity in Washington, D.C.
Even Lyndon B. Johnson's al
ma mater has been busted. In
January seven Southwest Texas
State College students were ar
rested for possession of mari
juana after a month-long inves
tigation in which college officials
co-operated closely with federal
narcotics agents.
Although predawn raids at
small schools like Stony Brook
have gotten the most publicity,
pot busts are so frequent at
large campuses that they go un
noticed.
In response to a recent CPS
survey, college editors at

many large schools, such as
the Universities of Wisconsin,
Colorado, and California at
Los Angeles, said there had
been too many arrests for
marijuana to count.
Arrests for possession of mari
juana are rising. In 1966 the Cal
ifornia Department of Criminal
Statistics reported 14,209 arrests
on marijuana charges. In 1967
there were 37,513 or about two
and-a-half times as many ar
rests.
Why this upsurge in arrests?
There are three major reasons:
—Marijuana use among stu
dents is increasing. Chuck Hol
lander, director of drug studies
for the U.S. National Student
Association, estimates that in
1966 10 to 15 per cent of the
nation's students used mari
juana.
Today he estimates that it has
risen to at least 20 per cent
everywhere except in the South
and as much as 35 per cent on
the West Coast. Moreover, he
says that may be a conservative
estimate.
A CPS survey of about 20
different schools showed 20-30
per cent on most campuses.
Most of these were results of
surveys taken by the campus
newspaper. The effect of this
increase in use has been com
pounded by publicity. There
are few national magazines
which have not run at least
one story about drug use on
campus, usually with scare
headlines on the cover.
—Students are not careful
about when and where they use
marijuana. An editorial in the
Daily Cardinal at the University
of Wisconsin recently warned:
"Drug users at this university
.. . insist on smoking marijuana
in dormitories and advertising
the fact to all the world . . .
"The moral of Stony Brook is
that students let down their
guard and let themselves be in
filtrated by police informers.
Wisconsin is ripe for a similar
experience unless students here

begin to realize that drug use is
not a game."
—Perhaps the most important
reason is the triumph of the
philosophy of strict enforcement
view of drug use over the edu
cational view. This confrontation
has occurred primarily within
the Federal Government.
The two protaganists in the
battle have been Harry Giorda
no, director of the Bureau of
Narcotics, and James Goddard,
commissioner of the Food and
Drug Administration. Giordano
is an advocate of strict enforce

ment of anti-marijuana laws and
strict new laws against LSD and
other hallucinogens. Goddard
has publicly questioned the laws
against possession of marijuana.
Goddard has lost the battle.
President Johnson called for
new anti-drug efforts in his
State of the Union message,
lambasting those who "sell
slavery to the young."
The Administration is pushing
a bill for strict new laws
against LSD, which Goddard has
been forced to reluctantly sup
port.

The two associate directors
will be Giordano and John Fin
lator, director of the Bureau of
Drug Abuse Control, who is ex
pected to take a much tougher
line now that he is out from un
der Goddard's wing.
In other words, Goddard has
been eased out. And many edu
cators fear the result will be
dozens of Stony Brooks and
hundreds of narcotics agents
coming onto their campuses.
The big question is what the
educators' response will be.
