# The 						Controversial Shockley
## Bigot Or Brave Scientist? 
### JEFF ROBISON 
If Professor William B. Shock
ley seems a little defensive when
it comes to interviews, he can
hardly be blamed.
For, though he will sincerely
acknowledge equitable treat
ment by the press, (the one ex
ception: science reporter David
Perlman of the San Francisco
Chronicle), it is primarily a re
sult of mass media publicity
that he has come to be called a
"blithering idiot" and a "racist."
Not that it unduly ruffles the
58-year-old Stanford physicist
and Nobel Laureate — three
years of speeches, letter-writing,
and research on human eugenics
(the science of improving quali
ties of the human race through
careful selection of parents) and
its possible application to Amer
ican society innured him long
ago to such polemics. It is only
that he has little patience or
time to waste with those not
already informed of his exact
position.
With the objective of be
coming so Informed, I spent
the better part of a week
scrutinizing the mountain of
past speeches and assorted in
terviews proffered by Shock

ley's dedicated assistant, Mrs.
Shockley.
("He really Is a very nice
man," she comforted one morn
ing, my disappointment all too
obvious at not yet being able
to see The Man — seated per
haps ten feet away behind a
closed door.)
A few days later, the compul
sory qualifying exam successful
ly passed, note-taking began in
earnest.
It is probably more to the
point of the Shockley Contro
versy to begin with what the
professor does not advocate. He
does not publicly advocate, as so
many infer, the establishment
of a eugenics program in the
United States.
Nor does he conclude a "gen
etic offset" exists between the
races, deny the importance of
environmental factors in shap
ing an individual's potential, or
discount the various poverty pro
grams now in operation.
Shockley said, "I Intend my
actions In raising these ques
tions to have the effect of a
visitor to a sick friend who
strongly urges a diagnosis,
painful though it may be, that
seeks to expose all significant

ailments. I feel that no one
should be more concerned with
these possibilities than Negro
intellectuals."
Given the virulence of cur
rent race relations — much less
the sordid memory of how Nazi
Germany chose to study eugenics
— one would think Shockley
content with the mere adduce
ment of such questions. But he
is not.
What little public support he
may have had embarrassingly
wilts in light of his "thinking ex
ercises," the most prominent of
which deals with birth control:
Step 1: The public votes for
the rate of population increase,
say one-third per cent per year
so that national population will
double in two centuries.
Step 2: The Census Bureau
computes that on the average
this means 2.2 per children per
each girl who reaches maturity.
Step 3: The public health
agencies insure that every
girl is temporarily sterilized
at an early age by the subcu
taneous injection of a sponge
like time capsule contracep
tive (now being developed).
She will then remain sterile
until the sponge is removed.

Step 4: Upon reaching matur
ity every girl is issued 22 deci
child certificates. A married
couple could use ten of
to pay for sponge removal until
childbirth. Then a new time cap
sule is installed.
Step 5: After two babies the
couple can either sell the two
remaining certificates or buy
eight more on the open market
to have a third pregnancy.
Predictably, Shockley's think
ing exercise soon became "Shock
ley's Five-Point Plan to Get Rid
of Negroes" — such is the emo
tional impact of even the most
objective reporting on an al
ready inflamed audience.
The point Is this: Shock
ley's private estimation of tho>
advisability of this "plan"
should be of precious little
matter to anyone but Dr.
Shockley.
The man should not be judged
on someone's conjecture about
that opinion, but T rather on what
he has publicly stated — in this
case, that the proposition pro
vokes the study of one's own
conscience on a subject of in
estimable consequence.
Shockley says, in effect, that
the present state of the human
condition is far more repugnant
than any intrusion by manda
tory contraception on the prin
ciples of individual liberty.
He notes, "Less than ten years
ago President Eisenhower, and
with him the majority of the na
tion, held that population con
trol aid to underdeveloped na
tions was, and I quote, 'emphat
ically a subject that is not a
proper political or governmental
activity. . . . ' "
"Eisenhower has publicly
changed his stand. We are fur
nishing birth control aid abroad,
and two months ago the United
Nations at long last reported,
through its Food and Agri
culture Organization that birth
control is necessary to save half
the world from increasing hung
er caused by human quality
problems."
The bulk of the criticism
aimed at Shockley falls into
two categories: (1) That he is
not a genetics scientist and,
therefore, not competent to
discuss the matter; (2) That
what research he has conduct
ed on the subject is sloppy,
unscientific, and unacceptable
to respected men in genetics.
To the first, Shockley admits
"My qualifications to reach con
clusion in the field of human
genetics are not those of a gene
ticist, a psychologist, or an an
thropologist — nor have any of
my statements suggested that
I thought I was so qualified."
He is, however, not inexperi
enced in the ways of scientific re
search:
I do . . . bring the qualifica
tions of a scientist, an educa

tor, an engineer, and specific
ally my operations research
experience of World War 11.
. . . My contributions in these
fields brought me the Medal
of Merit, the highest civilian
decoration. I regard my role t
in respect to human genetics
as being professionaly similar
to my wartime experiences in
the sense that detailed knowl
edge of the intricacies of the
field may even distract atten
tion from the central Issues
to important but irrelevant de
tails.
Such qualifications would
mean next to nothing had Shock
ley in fact publicly concluded
a genetic difference exists be
tween the races, that mandatory
contraception present man's last
chance for salvation, or that en
vironment is less important
than heredity in the develop
ment of an individual.
They do, on the other hand,
assume undeniable significance
when an eminent scientist,
long-trained in the methodo
logy of research, concludes
only that, in his estimation,
enough evidence is available
to warrant further investiga
tion. This is the crux of Shock
ley's position.
This reporter will not pretend
to analyze the pros and cons of
the second criticism — such in
terpretation is better left to
those competent in statistics and
research methods. Suffice it to
say that knowledgeable men
have taken both sides.
Among those who at least
prescribe further investigation:
Robert C. Nichols, Director of
Research, National Merit Scho
larship Corporation; Prof. A. B.
Wilson, University of Califor
nia, who conducted a research
project for the National Insti
tutes of Mental Health in 1966
on "The Educational Conse
quence of Segregation in a Cali
fornia Community"; author
psychologist Audrey M. Shuey
(The Testing of Negro Intelli
gence); and Prof. Curt Stern,
human genetics, Berkeley.

More disappointing to Shock
ley than the critics' response,
though, are the answers of those
in positions of potentially prac
tical influence. Shockley's 1964-65
correspondence with the De
partment of Labor is illustra
tive.
Wrote Secretary Wi 11 ar d
Wirtz: "There is a strong indi
cation that a disproportionate
number of unemployed come
from large families, but we do
not pursue evidence that would
permit establishing this as a
fact or evaluating its signifi
cance." Similarly, the office of
former Secretary of Health, Ed
ucation and Welfare John Gard
ner wrote thif his department
had conducted "no studies" on
the problem.
Shockley constantly hits what
he calls "inverted liberalism."
Shockley says, "A recent essay
quoted the typical inverted lib
eral position regarding human
quality questions: named 'No
knows,' 'there is no way to tell,'
'any inquiry is felt to be danger
ous.'

"These can't • don't - shouldn't
slogans characterize inverted lib
erals. A true liberal asserts "the
truth shall set you free" and
"the ability to doubt in the face
of the desire to belief is the
true mark of the scientist."
In the final analysis, though,
there is no doubt Shockley has
left himself one on one front
in the controversy: a review
of his speeches and writings
over the past three years un
avoidably lends itself to the
"inference" that the man has
already privately concluded
what he publicly
should only be investigated.
In the McMaster speech, for
example, Shockley states both
that "I do not conclude that my
studies prove that a genetic off
set actually exists" and"I am,
myself, prepared only to con
clude that the data are consis
tent with a major genetic racial
offset."
A careful reading of these two
remarks reveals no illogic, but
it is, to say the least, a point of
the finest distinction; and it is

unfortunate the racial tumult
of our time makes no allowances
for such semantic delicacies.
Conjecture over Shockley's
private opinions and the quality
of his research obscure the one
truly consequential issue: has
every idea, every imagination,
every proposal to improve the
quality of human life been con
sidered fairly?
The results of answers thus
far submitted suggest their own
conclusion.

earnest.
It is probably more to the
point of the Shockley Contro
versy to begin with what the
professor does not advocate. He
does not publicly advocate, as so
many infer, the establishment
of a eugenics program in the
United States.
Nor does he conclude a "gen
etic offset" exists between the
races, deny the importance of
environmental factors in shap
ing an individual's potential, or
discount the various poverty pro
grams now in operation.
Shockley said, "I Intend my
actions In raising these ques
tions to have the effect of a
visitor to a sick friend who
strongly urges a diagnosis,
painful though it may be, that
seeks to expose all significant

ailments. I feel that no one
should be more concerned with
these possibilities than Negro
intellectuals."
Given the virulence of cur
rent race relations — much less
the sordid memory of how Nazi
Germany chose to study eugenics
— one would think Shockley
content with the mere adduce
ment of such questions. But he
is not.
What little public support he
may have had embarrassingly
wilts in light of his "thinking ex
ercises," the most prominent of
which deals with birth control:
Step 1: The public votes for
the rate of population increase,
say one-third per cent per year
so that national population will
double in two centuries.
Step 2: The Census Bureau
computes that on the average
this means 2.2 per children per
each girl who reaches maturity.
Step 3: The public health
agencies insure that every
girl is temporarily sterilized
at an early age by the subcu
taneous injection of a sponge
like time capsule contracep
tive (now being developed).
She will then remain sterile
until the sponge is removed.

Step 4: Upon reaching matur
ity every girl is issued 22 deci
child certificates. A married
couple could use ten of
to pay for sponge removal until
childbirth. Then a new time cap
sule is installed.
Step 5: After two babies the
couple can either sell the two
remaining certificates or buy
eight more on the open market
to have a third pregnancy.
Predictably, Shockley's think
ing exercise soon became "Shock
ley's Five-Point Plan to Get Rid
of Negroes" — such is the emo
tional impact of even the most
objective reporting on an al
ready inflamed audience.
The point Is this: Shock
ley's private estimation of tho>
advisability of this "plan"
should be of precious little
matter to anyone but Dr.
Shockley.
The man should not be judged
on someone's conjecture about
that opinion, but T rather on what
he has publicly stated — in this
case, that the proposition pro
vokes the study of one's own
conscience on a subject of in
estimable consequence.
Shockley says, in effect, that
the present state of the human
condition is far more repugnant
than any intrusion by manda
tory contraception on the prin
ciples of individual liberty.
He notes, "Less than ten years
ago President Eisenhower, and
with him the majority of the na
tion, held that population con
trol aid to underdeveloped na
tions was, and I quote, 'emphat
ically a subject that is not a
proper political or governmental
activity. . . . ' "
"Eisenhower has publicly
changed his stand. We are fur
nishing birth control aid abroad,
and two months ago the United
Nations at long last reported,
through its Food and Agri
culture Organization that birth
control is necessary to save half
the world from increasing hung
er caused by human quality
problems."
The bulk of the criticism
aimed at Shockley falls into
two categories: (1) That he is
not a genetics scientist and,
therefore, not competent to
discuss the matter; (2) That
what research he has conduct
ed on the subject is sloppy,
unscientific, and unacceptable
to respected men in genetics.
To the first, Shockley admits
"My qualifications to reach con
clusion in the field of human
genetics are not those of a gene
ticist, a psychologist, or an an
thropologist — nor have any of
my statements suggested that
I thought I was so qualified."
He is, however, not inexperi
enced in the ways of scientific re
search:
I do . . . bring the qualifica
tions of a scientist, an educa

tor, an engineer, and specific
ally my operations research
experience of World War 11.
. . . My contributions in these
fields brought me the Medal
of Merit, the highest civilian
decoration. I regard my role t
in respect to human genetics
as being professionaly similar
to my wartime experiences in
the sense that detailed knowl
edge of the intricacies of the
field may even distract atten
tion from the central Issues
to important but irrelevant de
tails.
Such qualifications would
mean next to nothing had Shock
ley in fact publicly concluded
a genetic difference exists be
tween the races, that mandatory
contraception present man's last
chance for salvation, or that en
vironment is less important
than heredity in the develop
ment of an individual.
They do, on the other hand,
assume undeniable significance
when an eminent scientist,
long-trained in the methodo
logy of research, concludes
only that, in his estimation,
enough evidence is available
to warrant further investiga
tion. This is the crux of Shock
ley's position.
This reporter will not pretend
to analyze the pros and cons of
the second criticism — such in
terpretation is better left to
those competent in statistics and
research methods. Suffice it to
say that knowledgeable men
have taken both sides.
Among those who at least
prescribe further investigation:
Robert C. Nichols, Director of
Research, National Merit Scho
larship Corporation; Prof. A. B.
Wilson, University of Califor
nia, who conducted a research
project for the National Insti
tutes of Mental Health in 1966
on "The Educational Conse
quence of Segregation in a Cali
fornia Community"; author
psychologist Audrey M. Shuey
(The Testing of Negro Intelli
gence); and Prof. Curt Stern,
human genetics, Berkeley.

More disappointing to Shock
ley than the critics' response,
though, are the answers of those
in positions of potentially prac
tical influence. Shockley's 1964-65
correspondence with the De
partment of Labor is illustra
tive.
Wrote Secretary Wi 11 ar d
Wirtz: "There is a strong indi
cation that a disproportionate
number of unemployed come
from large families, but we do
not pursue evidence that would
permit establishing this as a
fact or evaluating its signifi
cance." Similarly, the office of
former Secretary of Health, Ed
ucation and Welfare John Gard
ner wrote thif his department
had conducted "no studies" on
the problem.
Shockley constantly hits what
he calls "inverted liberalism."
Shockley says, "A recent essay
quoted the typical inverted lib
eral position regarding human
quality questions: named 'No
knows,' 'there is no way to tell,'
'any inquiry is felt to be danger
ous.'

"These can't • don't - shouldn't
slogans characterize inverted lib
erals. A true liberal asserts "the
truth shall set you free" and
"the ability to doubt in the face
of the desire to belief is the
true mark of the scientist."
In the final analysis, though,
there is no doubt Shockley has
left himself one on one front
in the controversy: a review
of his speeches and writings
over the past three years un
avoidably lends itself to the
"inference" that the man has
already privately concluded
what he publicly
should only be investigated.
In the McMaster speech, for
example, Shockley states both
that "I do not conclude that my
studies prove that a genetic off
set actually exists" and"I am,
myself, prepared only to con
clude that the data are consis
tent with a major genetic racial
offset."
A careful reading of these two
remarks reveals no illogic, but
it is, to say the least, a point of
the finest distinction; and it is

unfortunate the racial tumult
of our time makes no allowances
for such semantic delicacies.
Conjecture over Shockley's
private opinions and the quality
of his research obscure the one
truly consequential issue: has
every idea, every imagination,
every proposal to improve the
quality of human life been con
sidered fairly?
The results of answers thus
far submitted suggest their own
conclusion.
If Professor William B. Shock
ley seems a little defensive when
it comes to interviews, he can
hardly be blamed.
For, though he will sincerely
acknowledge equitable treat
ment by the press, (the one ex
ception: science reporter David
Perlman of the San Francisco
Chronicle), it is primarily a re
sult of mass media publicity
that he has come to be called a
"blithering idiot" and a "racist."
Not that it unduly ruffles the
58-year-old Stanford physicist
and Nobel Laureate — three
years of speeches, letter-writing,
and research on human eugenics
(the science of improving quali
ties of the human race through
careful selection of parents) and
its possible application to Amer
ican society innured him long
ago to such polemics. It is only
that he has little patience or
time to waste with those not
already informed of his exact
position.
With the objective of be
coming so Informed, I spent
the better part of a week
scrutinizing the mountain of
past speeches and assorted in
terviews proffered by Shock

ley's dedicated assistant, Mrs.
Shockley.
("He really Is a very nice
man," she comforted one morn
ing, my disappointment all too
obvious at not yet being able
to see The Man — seated per
haps ten feet away behind a
closed door.)

Step 3: The public health
agencies insure that every
girl is temporarily sterilized
at an early age by the subcu
taneous injection of a sponge
like time capsule contracep
tive (now being developed).
She will then remain sterile
until the sponge is removed.

Step 4: Upon reaching matur
ity every girl is issued 22 deci
child certificates. A married
couple could use ten of
to pay for sponge removal until
childbirth. Then a new time cap
sule is installed.
Step 5: After two babies the
couple can either sell the two
remaining certificates or buy
eight more on the open market
to have a third pregnancy.
Predictably, Shockley's think
ing exercise soon became "Shock
ley's Five-Point Plan to Get Rid
of Negroes" — such is the emo
tional impact of even the most
objective reporting on an al
ready inflamed audience.
The point Is this: Shock
ley's private estimation of tho>
advisability of this "plan"
should be of precious little
matter to anyone but Dr.
Shockley.
The man should not be judged
on someone's conjecture about
that opinion, but T rather on what
he has publicly stated — in this
case, that the proposition pro
vokes the study of one's own
conscience on a subject of in
estimable consequence.
Shockley says, in effect, that
the present state of the human
condition is far more repugnant
than any intrusion by manda
tory contraception on the prin
ciples of individual liberty.
He notes, "Less than ten years
ago President Eisenhower, and
with him the majority of the na
tion, held that population con
trol aid to underdeveloped na
tions was, and I quote, 'emphat
ically a subject that is not a
proper political or governmental
activity. . . . ' "
"Eisenhower has publicly
changed his stand. We are fur
nishing birth control aid abroad,
and two months ago the United
Nations at long last reported,
through its Food and Agri
culture Organization that birth
control is necessary to save half
the world from increasing hung
er caused by human quality
problems."
The bulk of the criticism
aimed at Shockley falls into
two categories: (1) That he is
not a genetics scientist and,
therefore, not competent to
discuss the matter; (2) That
what research he has conduct
ed on the subject is sloppy,
unscientific, and unacceptable
to respected men in genetics.
To the first, Shockley admits
"My qualifications to reach con
clusion in the field of human
genetics are not those of a gene
ticist, a psychologist, or an an
thropologist — nor have any of
my statements suggested that
I thought I was so qualified."
He is, however, not inexperi
enced in the ways of scientific re
search:
I do . . . bring the qualifica
tions of a scientist, an educa

tor, an engineer, and specific
ally my operations research
experience of World War 11.
. . . My contributions in these
fields brought me the Medal
of Merit, the highest civilian
decoration. I regard my role t
in respect to human genetics
as being professionaly similar
to my wartime experiences in
the sense that detailed knowl
edge of the intricacies of the
field may even distract atten
tion from the central Issues
to important but irrelevant de
tails.
Such qualifications would
mean next to nothing had Shock
ley in fact publicly concluded
a genetic difference exists be
tween the races, that mandatory
contraception present man's last
chance for salvation, or that en
vironment is less important
than heredity in the develop
ment of an individual.
They do, on the other hand,
assume undeniable significance
when an eminent scientist,
long-trained in the methodo
logy of research, concludes
only that, in his estimation,
enough evidence is available
to warrant further investiga
tion. This is the crux of Shock
ley's position.
This reporter will not pretend
to analyze the pros and cons of
the second criticism — such in
terpretation is better left to
those competent in statistics and
research methods. Suffice it to
say that knowledgeable men
have taken both sides.
Among those who at least
prescribe further investigation:
Robert C. Nichols, Director of
Research, National Merit Scho
larship Corporation; Prof. A. B.
Wilson, University of Califor
nia, who conducted a research
project for the National Insti
tutes of Mental Health in 1966
on "The Educational Conse
quence of Segregation in a Cali
fornia Community"; author
psychologist Audrey M. Shuey
(The Testing of Negro Intelli
gence); and Prof. Curt Stern,
human genetics, Berkeley.

More disappointing to Shock
ley than the critics' response,
though, are the answers of those
in positions of potentially prac
tical influence. Shockley's 1964-65
correspondence with the De
partment of Labor is illustra
tive.
Wrote Secretary Wi 11 ar d
Wirtz: "There is a strong indi
cation that a disproportionate
number of unemployed come
from large families, but we do
not pursue evidence that would
permit establishing this as a
fact or evaluating its signifi
cance." Similarly, the office of
former Secretary of Health, Ed
ucation and Welfare John Gard
ner wrote thif his department
had conducted "no studies" on
the problem.
Shockley constantly hits what
he calls "inverted liberalism."
Shockley says, "A recent essay
quoted the typical inverted lib
eral position regarding human
quality questions: named 'No
knows,' 'there is no way to tell,'
'any inquiry is felt to be danger
ous.'

"These can't • don't - shouldn't
slogans characterize inverted lib
erals. A true liberal asserts "the
truth shall set you free" and
"the ability to doubt in the face
of the desire to belief is the
true mark of the scientist."
In the final analysis, though,
there is no doubt Shockley has
left himself one on one front
in the controversy: a review
of his speeches and writings
over the past three years un
avoidably lends itself to the
"inference" that the man has
already privately concluded
what he publicly
should only be investigated.
In the McMaster speech, for
example, Shockley states both
that "I do not conclude that my
studies prove that a genetic off
set actually exists" and"I am,
myself, prepared only to con
clude that the data are consis
tent with a major genetic racial
offset."
A careful reading of these two
remarks reveals no illogic, but
it is, to say the least, a point of
the finest distinction; and it is

unfortunate the racial tumult
of our time makes no allowances
for such semantic delicacies.
Conjecture over Shockley's
private opinions and the quality
of his research obscure the one
truly consequential issue: has
every idea, every imagination,
every proposal to improve the
quality of human life been con
sidered fairly?
The results of answers thus
far submitted suggest their own
conclusion.
If Professor William B. Shock
ley seems a little defensive when
it comes to interviews, he can
hardly be blamed.
For, though he will sincerely
acknowledge equitable treat
ment by the press, (the one ex
ception: science reporter David
Perlman of the San Francisco
Chronicle), it is primarily a re
sult of mass media publicity
that he has come to be called a
"blithering idiot" and a "racist."
Not that it unduly ruffles the
58-year-old Stanford physicist
and Nobel Laureate — three
years of speeches, letter-writing,
and research on human eugenics
(the science of improving quali
ties of the human race through
careful selection of parents) and
its possible application to Amer
ican society innured him long
ago to such polemics. It is only
that he has little patience or
time to waste with those not
already informed of his exact
position.
With the objective of be
coming so Informed, I spent
the better part of a week
scrutinizing the mountain of
past speeches and assorted in
terviews proffered by Shock

ley's dedicated assistant, Mrs.
Shockley.
("He really Is a very nice
man," she comforted one morn
ing, my disappointment all too
obvious at not yet being able
to see The Man — seated per
haps ten feet away behind a
closed door.)
A few days later, the compul
sory qualifying exam successful
ly passed, note-taking began in
earnest.
It is probably more to the
point of the Shockley Contro
versy to begin with what the
professor does not advocate. He
does not publicly advocate, as so
many infer, the establishment
of a eugenics program in the
United States.
Nor does he conclude a "gen
etic offset" exists between the
races, deny the importance of
environmental factors in shap
ing an individual's potential, or
discount the various poverty pro
grams now in operation.
Shockley said, "I Intend my
actions In raising these ques
tions to have the effect of a
visitor to a sick friend who
strongly urges a diagnosis,
painful though it may be, that
seeks to expose all significant

ailments. I feel that no one
should be more concerned with
these possibilities than Negro
intellectuals."
Given the virulence of cur
rent race relations — much less
the sordid memory of how Nazi
Germany chose to study eugenics
— one would think Shockley
content with the mere adduce
ment of such questions. But he
is not.
What little public support he
may have had embarrassingly
wilts in light of his "thinking ex
ercises," the most prominent of
which deals with birth control:
Step 1: The public votes for
the rate of population increase,
say one-third per cent per year
so that national population will
double in two centuries.
Step 2: The Census Bureau
computes that on the average
this means 2.2 per children per
each girl who reaches maturity.
Step 3: The public health
agencies insure that every
girl is temporarily sterilized
at an early age by the subcu
taneous injection of a sponge
like time capsule contracep
tive (now being developed).
She will then remain sterile
until the sponge is removed.

ciples of individual liberty.
He notes, "Less than ten years
ago President Eisenhower, and
with him the majority of the na
tion, held that population con
trol aid to underdeveloped na
tions was, and I quote, 'emphat
ically a subject that is not a
proper political or governmental
activity. . . . ' "
"Eisenhower has publicly
changed his stand. We are fur
nishing birth control aid abroad,
and two months ago the United
Nations at long last reported,
through its Food and Agri
culture Organization that birth
control is necessary to save half
the world from increasing hung
er caused by human quality
problems."
The bulk of the criticism
aimed at Shockley falls into
two categories: (1) That he is
not a genetics scientist and,
therefore, not competent to
discuss the matter; (2) That
what research he has conduct
ed on the subject is sloppy,
unscientific, and unacceptable
to respected men in genetics.
To the first, Shockley admits
"My qualifications to reach con
clusion in the field of human
genetics are not those of a gene
ticist, a psychologist, or an an
thropologist — nor have any of
my statements suggested that
I thought I was so qualified."
He is, however, not inexperi
enced in the ways of scientific re
search:
I do . . . bring the qualifica
tions of a scientist, an educa

tor, an engineer, and specific
ally my operations research
experience of World War 11.
. . . My contributions in these
fields brought me the Medal
of Merit, the highest civilian
decoration. I regard my role t
in respect to human genetics
as being professionaly similar
to my wartime experiences in
the sense that detailed knowl
edge of the intricacies of the
field may even distract atten
tion from the central Issues
to important but irrelevant de
tails.
Such qualifications would
mean next to nothing had Shock
ley in fact publicly concluded
a genetic difference exists be
tween the races, that mandatory
contraception present man's last
chance for salvation, or that en
vironment is less important
than heredity in the develop
ment of an individual.
They do, on the other hand,
assume undeniable significance
when an eminent scientist,
long-trained in the methodo
logy of research, concludes
only that, in his estimation,
enough evidence is available
to warrant further investiga
tion. This is the crux of Shock
ley's position.
This reporter will not pretend
to analyze the pros and cons of
the second criticism — such in
terpretation is better left to
those competent in statistics and
research methods. Suffice it to
say that knowledgeable men
have taken both sides.
Among those who at least
prescribe further investigation:
Robert C. Nichols, Director of
Research, National Merit Scho
larship Corporation; Prof. A. B.
Wilson, University of Califor
nia, who conducted a research
project for the National Insti
tutes of Mental Health in 1966
on "The Educational Conse
quence of Segregation in a Cali
fornia Community"; author
psychologist Audrey M. Shuey
(The Testing of Negro Intelli
gence); and Prof. Curt Stern,
human genetics, Berkeley.

More disappointing to Shock
ley than the critics' response,
though, are the answers of those
in positions of potentially prac
tical influence. Shockley's 1964-65
correspondence with the De
partment of Labor is illustra
tive.
Wrote Secretary Wi 11 ar d
Wirtz: "There is a strong indi
cation that a disproportionate
number of unemployed come
from large families, but we do
not pursue evidence that would
permit establishing this as a
fact or evaluating its signifi
cance." Similarly, the office of
former Secretary of Health, Ed
ucation and Welfare John Gard
ner wrote thif his department
had conducted "no studies" on
the problem.
Shockley constantly hits what
he calls "inverted liberalism."
Shockley says, "A recent essay
quoted the typical inverted lib
eral position regarding human
quality questions: named 'No
knows,' 'there is no way to tell,'
'any inquiry is felt to be danger
ous.'

"These can't • don't - shouldn't
slogans characterize inverted lib
erals. A true liberal asserts "the
truth shall set you free" and
"the ability to doubt in the face
of the desire to belief is the
true mark of the scientist."
In the final analysis, though,
there is no doubt Shockley has
left himself one on one front
in the controversy: a review
of his speeches and writings
over the past three years un
avoidably lends itself to the
"inference" that the man has
already privately concluded
what he publicly
should only be investigated.
In the McMaster speech, for
example, Shockley states both
that "I do not conclude that my
studies prove that a genetic off
set actually exists" and"I am,
myself, prepared only to con
clude that the data are consis
tent with a major genetic racial
offset."
A careful reading of these two
remarks reveals no illogic, but
it is, to say the least, a point of
the finest distinction; and it is

unfortunate the racial tumult
of our time makes no allowances
for such semantic delicacies.
Conjecture over Shockley's
private opinions and the quality
of his research obscure the one
truly consequential issue: has
every idea, every imagination,
every proposal to improve the
quality of human life been con
sidered fairly?
The results of answers thus
far submitted suggest their own
conclusion.
If Professor William B. Shock
ley seems a little defensive when
it comes to interviews, he can
hardly be blamed.
For, though he will sincerely
acknowledge equitable treat
ment by the press, (the one ex
ception: science reporter David
Perlman of the San Francisco
Chronicle), it is primarily a re
sult of mass media publicity
that he has come to be called a
"blithering idiot" and a "racist."
Not that it unduly ruffles the
58-year-old Stanford physicist
and Nobel Laureate — three
years of speeches, letter-writing,
and research on human eugenics
(the science of improving quali
ties of the human race through
careful selection of parents) and
its possible application to Amer
ican society innured him long
ago to such polemics. It is only
that he has little patience or
time to waste with those not
already informed of his exact
position.
With the objective of be
coming so Informed, I spent
the better part of a week
scrutinizing the mountain of
past speeches and assorted in
terviews proffered by Shock

ley's dedicated assistant, Mrs.
Shockley.
("He really Is a very nice
man," she comforted one morn
ing, my disappointment all too
obvious at not yet being able
to see The Man — seated per
haps ten feet away behind a
closed door.)
A few days later, the compul
sory qualifying exam successful
ly passed, note-taking began in
earnest.
It is probably more to the
point of the Shockley Contro
versy to begin with what the
professor does not advocate. He
does not publicly advocate, as so
many infer, the establishment
of a eugenics program in the
United States.
Nor does he conclude a "gen
etic offset" exists between the
races, deny the importance of
environmental factors in shap
ing an individual's potential, or
discount the various poverty pro
grams now in operation.
Shockley said, "I Intend my
actions In raising these ques
tions to have the effect of a
visitor to a sick friend who
strongly urges a diagnosis,
painful though it may be, that
seeks to expose all significant

ailments. I feel that no one
should be more concerned with
these possibilities than Negro
intellectuals."
Given the virulence of cur
rent race relations — much less
the sordid memory of how Nazi
Germany chose to study eugenics
— one would think Shockley
content with the mere adduce
ment of such questions. But he
is not.
What little public support he
may have had embarrassingly
wilts in light of his "thinking ex
ercises," the most prominent of
which deals with birth control:
Step 1: The public votes for
the rate of population increase,
say one-third per cent per year
so that national population will
double in two centuries.
Step 2: The Census Bureau
computes that on the average
this means 2.2 per children per
each girl who reaches maturity.
Step 3: The public health
agencies insure that every
girl is temporarily sterilized
at an early age by the subcu
taneous injection of a sponge
like time capsule contracep
tive (now being developed).
She will then remain sterile
until the sponge is removed.

Step 4: Upon reaching matur
ity every girl is issued 22 deci
child certificates. A married
couple could use ten of
to pay for sponge removal until
childbirth. Then a new time cap
sule is installed.
Step 5: After two babies the
couple can either sell the two
remaining certificates or buy
eight more on the open market
to have a third pregnancy.
Predictably, Shockley's think
ing exercise soon became "Shock
ley's Five-Point Plan to Get Rid
of Negroes" — such is the emo
tional impact of even the most
objective reporting on an al
ready inflamed audience.
The point Is this: Shock
ley's private estimation of tho>
advisability of this "plan"
should be of precious little
matter to anyone but Dr.
Shockley.
The man should not be judged
on someone's conjecture about
that opinion, but T rather on what
he has publicly stated — in this
case, that the proposition pro
vokes the study of one's own
conscience on a subject of in
estimable consequence.
Shockley says, in effect, that
the present state of the human
condition is far more repugnant
than any intrusion by manda
tory contraception on the prin
ciples of individual liberty.
He notes, "Less than ten years
ago President Eisenhower, and
with him the majority of the na
tion, held that population con

fields brought me the Medal

in respect to human genetics
as being professionaly similar

edge of the intricacies of the
field may even distract atten
tion from the central Issues

tails.
Such qualifications would
mean next to nothing had Shock
ley in fact publicly concluded
a genetic difference exists be
tween the races, that mandatory
contraception present man's last
chance for salvation, or that en
vironment is less important
than heredity in the develop
ment of an individual.
They do, on the other hand,
assume undeniable significance
when an eminent scientist,
long-trained in the methodo
logy of research, concludes
only that, in his estimation,
enough evidence is available
to warrant further investiga
tion. This is the crux of Shock
ley's position.
This reporter will not pretend
to analyze the pros and cons of
the second criticism — such in
terpretation is better left to
those competent in statistics and
research methods. Suffice it to
say that knowledgeable men
have taken both sides.
Among those who at least
prescribe further investigation:
Robert C. Nichols, Director of
Research, National Merit Scho
larship Corporation; Prof. A. B.
Wilson, University of Califor
nia, who conducted a research
project for the National Insti
tutes of Mental Health in 1966
on "The Educational Conse
quence of Segregation in a Cali
fornia Community"; author
psychologist Audrey M. Shuey
(The Testing of Negro Intelli
gence); and Prof. Curt Stern,
human genetics, Berkeley.

More disappointing to Shock
ley than the critics' response,
though, are the answers of those
in positions of potentially prac
tical influence. Shockley's 1964-65
correspondence with the De
partment of Labor is illustra
tive.
Wrote Secretary Wi 11 ar d
Wirtz: "There is a strong indi
cation that a disproportionate
number of unemployed come
from large families, but we do
not pursue evidence that would
permit establishing this as a
fact or evaluating its signifi
cance." Similarly, the office of
former Secretary of Health, Ed
ucation and Welfare John Gard
ner wrote thif his department
had conducted "no studies" on
the problem.
Shockley constantly hits what
he calls "inverted liberalism."
Shockley says, "A recent essay
quoted the typical inverted lib
eral position regarding human
quality questions: named 'No
knows,' 'there is no way to tell,'
'any inquiry is felt to be danger
ous.'

"These can't • don't - shouldn't
slogans characterize inverted lib
erals. A true liberal asserts "the
truth shall set you free" and
"the ability to doubt in the face
of the desire to belief is the
true mark of the scientist."
In the final analysis, though,
there is no doubt Shockley has
left himself one on one front
in the controversy: a review
of his speeches and writings
over the past three years un
avoidably lends itself to the
"inference" that the man has
already privately concluded
what he publicly
should only be investigated.
In the McMaster speech, for
example, Shockley states both
that "I do not conclude that my
studies prove that a genetic off
set actually exists" and"I am,
myself, prepared only to con
clude that the data are consis
tent with a major genetic racial
offset."
A careful reading of these two
remarks reveals no illogic, but
it is, to say the least, a point of
the finest distinction; and it is

unfortunate the racial tumult
of our time makes no allowances
for such semantic delicacies.
Conjecture over Shockley's
private opinions and the quality
of his research obscure the one
truly consequential issue: has
every idea, every imagination,
every proposal to improve the
quality of human life been con
sidered fairly?
The results of answers thus
far submitted suggest their own
conclusion.
If Professor William B. Shock
ley seems a little defensive when
it comes to interviews, he can
hardly be blamed.
For, though he will sincerely
acknowledge equitable treat
ment by the press, (the one ex
ception: science reporter David
Perlman of the San Francisco
Chronicle), it is primarily a re
sult of mass media publicity
that he has come to be called a
"blithering idiot" and a "racist."
Not that it unduly ruffles the
58-year-old Stanford physicist
and Nobel Laureate — three
years of speeches, letter-writing,
and research on human eugenics
(the science of improving quali
ties of the human race through
careful selection of parents) and
its possible application to Amer
ican society innured him long
ago to such polemics. It is only
that he has little patience or
time to waste with those not
already informed of his exact
position.
With the objective of be
coming so Informed, I spent
the better part of a week
scrutinizing the mountain of
past speeches and assorted in
terviews proffered by Shock

ley's dedicated assistant, Mrs.
Shockley.
("He really Is a very nice
man," she comforted one morn
ing, my disappointment all too
obvious at not yet being able
to see The Man — seated per
haps ten feet away behind a
closed door.)
A few days later, the compul
sory qualifying exam successful
ly passed, note-taking began in
earnest.
It is probably more to the
point of the Shockley Contro
versy to begin with what the
professor does not advocate. He
does not publicly advocate, as so
many infer, the establishment
of a eugenics program in the
United States.
Nor does he conclude a "gen
etic offset" exists between the
races, deny the importance of
environmental factors in shap
ing an individual's potential, or
discount the various poverty pro
grams now in operation.
Shockley said, "I Intend my
actions In raising these ques
tions to have the effect of a
visitor to a sick friend who
strongly urges a diagnosis,
painful though it may be, that
seeks to expose all significant

ailments. I feel that no one
should be more concerned with
these possibilities than Negro
intellectuals."
Given the virulence of cur
rent race relations — much less
the sordid memory of how Nazi
Germany chose to study eugenics
— one would think Shockley
content with the mere adduce
ment of such questions. But he
is not.
What little public support he
may have had embarrassingly
wilts in light of his "thinking ex
ercises," the most prominent of
which deals with birth control:
Step 1: The public votes for
the rate of population increase,
say one-third per cent per year
so that national population will
double in two centuries.
Step 2: The Census Bureau
computes that on the average
this means 2.2 per children per
each girl who reaches maturity.
Step 3: The public health
agencies insure that every
girl is temporarily sterilized
at an early age by the subcu
taneous injection of a sponge
like time capsule contracep
tive (now being developed).
She will then remain sterile
until the sponge is removed.

Step 4: Upon reaching matur
ity every girl is issued 22 deci
child certificates. A married
couple could use ten of
to pay for sponge removal until
childbirth. Then a new time cap
sule is installed.
Step 5: After two babies the
couple can either sell the two
remaining certificates or buy
eight more on the open market
to have a third pregnancy.
Predictably, Shockley's think
ing exercise soon became "Shock
ley's Five-Point Plan to Get Rid
of Negroes" — such is the emo
tional impact of even the most
objective reporting on an al
ready inflamed audience.
The point Is this: Shock
ley's private estimation of tho>
advisability of this "plan"
should be of precious little
matter to anyone but Dr.
Shockley.
The man should not be judged
on someone's conjecture about
that opinion, but T rather on what
he has publicly stated — in this
case, that the proposition pro
vokes the study of one's own
conscience on a subject of in
estimable consequence.
Shockley says, in effect, that
the present state of the human
condition is far more repugnant
than any intrusion by manda
tory contraception on the prin
ciples of individual liberty.
He notes, "Less than ten years
ago President Eisenhower, and
with him the majority of the na
tion, held that population con
trol aid to underdeveloped na
tions was, and I quote, 'emphat
ically a subject that is not a
proper political or governmental
activity. . . . ' "
"Eisenhower has publicly
changed his stand. We are fur
nishing birth control aid abroad,
and two months ago the United
Nations at long last reported,
through its Food and Agri
culture Organization that birth
control is necessary to save half
the world from increasing hung
er caused by human quality
problems."
The bulk of the criticism
aimed at Shockley falls into
two categories: (1) That he is
not a genetics scientist and,
therefore, not competent to
discuss the matter; (2) That
what research he has conduct
ed on the subject is sloppy,
unscientific, and unacceptable
to respected men in genetics.
To the first, Shockley admits
"My qualifications to reach con
clusion in the field of human
genetics are not those of a gene
ticist, a psychologist, or an an
thropologist — nor have any of
my statements suggested that
I thought I was so qualified."
He is, however, not inexperi
enced in the ways of scientific re
search:
I do . . . bring the qualifica
tions of a scientist, an educa

tor, an engineer, and specific
ally my operations research
experience of World War 11.
. . . My contributions in these
fields brought me the Medal
of Merit, the highest civilian
decoration. I regard my role t
in respect to human genetics
as being professionaly similar

the sense that detailed knowl
edge of the intricacies of the
field may even distract atten
