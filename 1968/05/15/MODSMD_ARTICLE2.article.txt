# The
						Controversial Shockley
## Bigot Or Brave Scientist? 
### JEFF ROBISON 
If Professor William B. Shock
ley seems a little defensive when
it comes to interviews, he can
hardly be blamed.
For, though he will sincerely
acknowledge equitable treat
ment by the press, (the one ex
ception: science reporter David
Perlman of the San Francisco
Chronicle), it is primarily a re
sult of mass media publicity
that he has come to be called a
"blithering idiot" and a "racist."
Not that it unduly ruffles the
58-year-old Stanford physicist
and Nobel Laureate — three
years of speeches, letter-writing,
and research on human eugenics
(the science of improving quali
ties of the human race through
careful selection of parents) and
its possible application to Amer
ican society innured him long
ago to such polemics. It is only
that he has little patience or
time to waste with those not
already informed of his exact
position.
With the objective of be
coming so Informed, I spent
the better part of a week
scrutinizing the mountain of
past speeches and assorted in
terviews proffered by Shock

ley's dedicated assistant, Mrs.
Shockley.
("He really Is a very nice
man," she comforted one morn
ing, my disappointment all too
obvious at not yet being able
to see The Man — seated per
haps ten feet away behind a
closed door.)
A few days later, the compul
sory qualifying exam successful
ly passed, note-taking began in
earnest.
It is probably more to the
point of the Shockley Contro
versy to begin with what the
professor does not advocate. He
does not publicly advocate, as so
many infer, the establishment
of a eugenics program in the
United States.
Nor does he conclude a "gen
etic offset" exists between the
races, deny the importance of
environmental factors in shap
ing an individual's potential, or
discount the various poverty pro
grams now in operation.
Shockley said, "I Intend my
actions In raising these ques
tions to have the effect of a
visitor to a sick friend who
strongly urges a diagnosis,
painful though it may be, that
seeks to expose all significant

ailments. I feel that no one
should be more concerned with
these possibilities than Negro
intellectuals."
Given the virulence of cur
rent race relations — much less
the sordid memory of how Nazi
Germany chose to study eugenics
— one would think Shockley
content with the mere adduce
ment of such questions. But he
is not.
What little public support he
may have had embarrassingly
wilts in light of his "thinking ex
ercises," the most prominent of
which deals with birth control:
Step 1: The public votes for
the rate of population increase,
say one-third per cent per year
so that national population will
double in two centuries.
Step 2: The Census Bureau
computes that on the average
this means 2.2 per children per
each girl who reaches maturity.
Step 3: The public health
agencies insure that every
girl is temporarily sterilized
at an early age by the subcu
taneous injection of a sponge
like time capsule contracep
tive (now being developed).
She will then remain sterile
until the sponge is removed.

Step 4: Upon reaching matur
ity every girl is issued 22 deci
child certificates. A married
couple could use ten of
to pay for sponge removal until
childbirth. Then a new time cap
sule is installed.
Step 5: After two babies the
couple can either sell the two
remaining certificates or buy
eight more on the open market
to have a third pregnancy.
Predictably, Shockley's think
ing exercise soon became "Shock
ley's Five-Point Plan to Get Rid
of Negroes" — such is the emo
tional impact of even the most
objective reporting on an al
ready inflamed audience.
The point Is this: Shock
ley's private estimation of tho>
advisability of this "plan"
should be of precious little
matter to anyone but Dr.
Shockley.
The man should not be judged
on someone's conjecture about
that opinion, but T rather on what
he has publicly stated — in this
case, that the proposition pro
vokes the study of one's own
conscience on a subject of in
estimable consequence.
Shockley says, in effect, that
the present state of the human
condition is far more repugnant
than any intrusion by manda
tory contraception on the prin
ciples of individual liberty.
He notes, "Less than ten years
ago President Eisenhower, and
