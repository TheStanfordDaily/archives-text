## Mame: Fine Entertainment 
### ROGER OLIVER 
The San Francisco Light
Opera Association's production
of Mame needs no critic to tell
it how good it is. From the mo
ment the overture begins this
is a show confident of thorough
ly entertaining its audience.
Mame is not a profound eve
ning of theatre or even an im
portant musical comedy. Its
goal is to present a generous
portion of entertainment, and
taken on its own terms it is a
delight.
Based On Novel
Mame is based on Patrick
Dennis' novel Auntie Mame as
well as the play by Lawrence
and Lee, who have written the
book for the musical version.
While the story is a familiar
one, it still stands up well.
The chief reason for this suc
cess is that Mame is now being
played by Angela Lansbury, a
musical comedy star of the high
est magnitude. Miss Lansbury
makes the character her own, as
if she were the first to play the
role. She also displays a grace
and a charm on the stage that
makes her every movement a
pleasure.
Miss Lansbury is delightful
from her anticipated entrance at

the top of a staircase to her
final ascent up that staircase
with her grand-nephew. She
sings and dances with great
skill, displaying the ability in
these categories that has long
been evident in her acting.
While Miss Lansbury is un
questionably the key to this
production, she is well-support
ed by many members of the
New York cast who made the
trip to California with her.
Especially noteworthy are Anne
Francine as Mame's "best
friend" and Jane Connell as
Gooch, the secretary who learns
how to live.
Support Roles Good
Miss Francine brings the per
fect amount of acidity to her
role as she trades barbs with
Mame, culminating in their num
ber "Bosom Buddies," a classic
of sarcastic by-play. Miss Con
nell's excellent interpretation of
Gooch provides the right con
trast to both Miss Francine's
portrayal of the first lady of
the American theatre and Miss
Lansbury's ebullient Mame.
While the female roles in this
show are the better ones, the
male performers also excell,
especially Stuart Getz, the
twelve year old redhead who

plays Mame's nephew Patrick.
Jerry Lanning, the elder Pat
rick, Charles Braswell, Mame's
husbead Beau, and Willard
Waterman, Babcock, also sup
port Miss Lansbury ably.
Jerry Herman's songs except
the title song, have not gained
popularity outside the show,
but they work well and are ex
cellently presented. "Open a
New Window," "My Best Girl"
and "If He Walked into My
Life" are especially entertain
ing.
The cast has been well di
rected by Gene Saks, who has
given the show a precision and
smoothness that is also evident
in Onna White's dance numbers.
The visual elements of this
production also deserve praise.
William and Jean Eckart's set
tings, Robert Mackintosh's cos
tumes and Tharon Musser's
lighting all blend well to creat
Mame's world, the environment
necessary for her to work her
magic.
Mame will continue at the
Curran Theatre in San Fran
cisco through June 15. Perform
ances are Monday through Sat
urday at 8:30 p.m. with matinees
at 2 p.m. on Wednesday and
Saturday.

and a charm on the stage that
makes her every movement a
pleasure.
Miss Lansbury is delightful
from her anticipated entrance at

the top of a staircase to her
final ascent up that staircase
with her grand-nephew. She
sings and dances with great
skill, displaying the ability in
these categories that has long
been evident in her acting.
While Miss Lansbury is un
questionably the key to this
production, she is well-support
ed by many members of the
New York cast who made the
trip to California with her.
Especially noteworthy are Anne
Francine as Mame's "best
friend" and Jane Connell as
Gooch, the secretary who learns
how to live.
Support Roles Good
Miss Francine brings the per
fect amount of acidity to her
role as she trades barbs with
Mame, culminating in their num
ber "Bosom Buddies," a classic
of sarcastic by-play. Miss Con
nell's excellent interpretation of
Gooch provides the right con
trast to both Miss Francine's
portrayal of the first lady of
the American theatre and Miss
Lansbury's ebullient Mame.
While the female roles in this
show are the better ones, the
male performers also excell,
especially Stuart Getz, the
twelve year old redhead who

plays Mame's nephew Patrick.
Jerry Lanning, the elder Pat
rick, Charles Braswell, Mame's
husbead Beau, and Willard
Waterman, Babcock, also sup
port Miss Lansbury ably.
Jerry Herman's songs except
the title song, have not gained
popularity outside the show,
but they work well and are ex
cellently presented. "Open a
New Window," "My Best Girl"
and "If He Walked into My
Life" are especially entertain
ing.
The cast has been well di
rected by Gene Saks, who has
given the show a precision and
smoothness that is also evident
in Onna White's dance numbers.
The visual elements of this
production also deserve praise.
William and Jean Eckart's set
tings, Robert Mackintosh's cos
tumes and Tharon Musser's
lighting all blend well to creat
Mame's world, the environment
necessary for her to work her
magic.
Mame will continue at the
Curran Theatre in San Fran
cisco through June 15. Perform
ances are Monday through Sat
urday at 8:30 p.m. with matinees
at 2 p.m. on Wednesday and
Saturday.
The San Francisco Light
Opera Association's production
of Mame needs no critic to tell
it how good it is. From the mo
ment the overture begins this
is a show confident of thorough
ly entertaining its audience.
Mame is not a profound eve
ning of theatre or even an im
portant musical comedy. Its
goal is to present a generous
portion of entertainment, and
taken on its own terms it is a
delight.
Based On Novel
Mame is based on Patrick
Dennis' novel Auntie Mame as
well as the play by Lawrence
and Lee, who have written the
book for the musical version.
While the story is a familiar
one, it still stands up well.
The chief reason for this suc
cess is that Mame is now being
played by Angela Lansbury, a
musical comedy star of the high
est magnitude. Miss Lansbury
makes the character her own, as
if she were the first to play the
role. She also displays a grace
and a charm on the stage that
makes her every movement a
pleasure.
