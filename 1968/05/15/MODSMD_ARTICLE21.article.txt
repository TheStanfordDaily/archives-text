# Why The Paly High Suspensions?
## 
### AL TAMMANY BARBARA RITZ 
Last month 30 Palo Alto High
School students were suspended
for participating in a strike at
the school expressing their con
cern over the war in Vietnam
and racism. The administration
said that the students disobeyed
school officials' orders to return
to class and encouraged other
students to join their strike.
Principal Ray Ruppel suspend
ed the students for 5 days in ac
cordance with a decision made
at the superintendent's office.
Normally punitive action is left
to the discretion of the principal,
but in this case it was felt the
strike would spread to all three
high schools in Palo Alto. The
strike, however, never spread to
Gunn or Cubberley.
Some teachers were reported
as having threatened to flunk
any student participating in the

strike, but later explained that
their actions were not threats,
rather a reaction to the possi
bility that the students were
being used by someone outside
of the school; that the strike
was not entirely their own do
ing. They also felt that some
students would take advantage
of the situation and cut classes
for the hell of it.
The Daily questioned Mr.
George Millar, assistant princi
pal at Palo Alto High School to
clarify the suspension of the
strikers:
Dally: We understand that
there was an underlying cause
for the strike not associated
with the"Day of Conscience" di
rectly. Is that true?
Millar: Yes. The whole thing
started when a student was al
lowed to use school office equip
ment to print up a tract for dis
tribution outside of school. He
then violated our agreement by
turning around and distributing
it on the school premises.
Daily: The punitive action
brought against this student
then was due to his violation of
an agreementâ€”having nothing
to do with the content of the
tract?
Millar: Right. Kids here have

more freedom of speech than
many high schools. In our pub
lications we refuse to print only
those things which contain libel,
slander, open profanity, and
views supporting the violation
of laws.
Daily: Only 30 students partic
ipated. Would you say that the
majority of students were in
agreement with their strike?
Millar: No. There was a mon
umental apathy among the stu
dents. Out of 1500 kids, only 30
actively participated. That's
about 2 per cent.
Daily: What about the petition
being circulated in support of
the strikers; it's supposed to
have some 400 to 500 signatures?
Millar: Students will sign any
thing. I could start a petition for
Donald Duck and have that
many signatures by this after
noon. So it means nothing.
Daily: About the suspension.
Isn't there a better way to deal
with truancy? Or are you bound
by state and county laws in these
matters?
Millar: It has nothing to do
with state or county ordinances
on truancy. I suppose if there
is a single most important fact
or in this suspension business
it's that it tends to force paren

tal involvement. In this particu
lar case parental involvement
was one of our main issues. Had
we done nothing to the kids, it
would have encouraged other
kids to act.
Daily: But it seems that you
are suspending the very students
that in society's mind need
school the most.
Millar: It does seem to be an
anachronism to suspend them
for suspending themselves, but
there was little recourse for us.
Daily: But the school gets
paid for its attendance. Aren't
you losing money by suspending
students?
Millar: Yes.
Daily: Why did you have the
students sign a statement before
they were allowed to return to
school?
Millar: It was more of a ploy
to force parental participation.
Basically, schools use a negative
type of coercion. It's a shame
that we can't use a more posi
tive approach.
Daily: By forcing students to
attend classes, how can you be
gin to prepare them to take re
sponsibility for their own educa
tion?
Millar: This problem exists in
all areas where compulsory edu

cation is. The kids haven't made
a commitment to education like
college students have, that's
why they can't be given freedom
to attend class or not.
Kids are not knowledgable or
rational enough to make deci
sions concerning these things.
For example, if there is a con
troversial subject we have to
have persons speaking on both
sides of the issue.
Daily: What would happen as
suming attendance were not
mandatory?
Millar: The school would not
become deserted, but attendance
would significantly drop. We are
trying to move the school in the
direction that kids would want
to come.
Daily: If the ultimate goal
then is to have students want to
attend, why is passing automat
ic? The kids realize how phony
it all is, and graduation is just
another superficial no-big-deal.
Millar: I know. It's like the
kids who simply sit in the class
and tune things off. But then
automatically on June 13th they
go thru an initiation ceremony.
When they take off that cap and
gown they are adults. Before
this they are kids. This is the
premise upon which we operate.
