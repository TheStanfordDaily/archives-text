# Columbia Faculty 'Powerless'
## 
### News Analysis By RICHARD ANTHONY 
NEW YORK (CPS) — During
the period that students were
occupying buildings at Colum
bia, it became clear to many ob
servers that the university's
lack of a formal body repre
senting the faculty as a whole
was a serious liability.
Unlike Berkeley, where the
faculty senate stepped into the
student administration struggle
in 1964, Columbia has no mech
anism that allows the will of
the faculty to be translated into
action.
The faculty members who
tried to act as mediators be
tween students and the ad
ministration, therefore, found/
themselves faced with the Im
mediate problem of establish
ing their own legitimacy. It is
a problem that still hampers
the faculty's efforts to deal
with the situation at Colum
bia.
Concerned faculty members
got together Wednesday, the day
after the first building was oc
cupied, and decided they should
try to get negotiations going and
keep police off the campus. Ac
cording to Homer Brown, assis
tant professor of English, mem
bers of the group felt they had
given themselves legitimacy by
the fact of their willingness to
stand in front of the occupied
buildings and try to keep police
out.
"People felt that the univer
sity faculty was a legitimate
mediating force. In addition, the
students made two demands that
were unacceptable to the fac
ulty negotiators.
First, they said the faculty
group (which eventually came
to be known as the Ad Hoc Fac
ulty) should take a political posi
tion on the strike. And second,
they set the granting of amnesty
as a precondition for negotia
tions.
According to Alan Westln,
professor of public law and a
member of the faculty
tiating team, "At no point was
there sentiment in the (fac
ulty) steering committee, nor
in the majority of the group
as a whole, for granting am
nesty."
The faculty effort, never very
promising, fell apart over the
weekend. Two developments pro
vided the coup de grace. First,
faculty standing in front of Low
Library, the main administration
building, began blocking off food
deliveries into the building. This
erased any possibility of trust be
tween the student committee
and faculty negotiators, and it
also alienated some younger
members of the ad hoc group.
The second development was
Saturday night, when Mark
Rudd, chairman of SDS, told a
meeting of the Ad Hoc Faculty
that any reports of progress
they had heard were "bullshit."
The question of whether or
not progress was being made
has since become a sorepoint be
tween different factions of the
Ad Hoc Faculty. Marvin Harris
of the anthropology department
charged that the group's steering
committee deluded the member
ship into thinking progress was
being made.
West in, one of the members
of the steering committee, noted
only that the administration had
made concessions on the gym
and other issues, and that "in
side the buildings there was a
willingness to talk."
Whatever the truth of the
matter, it is clear the faculty
was more or less irrelevant
by the weekend. By that time
the students themselves saw
Mayor John Lindsay and his
staff as the only middle force
that they could deal with. And
interestingly enough, many of
the members of the strike
steering committee say they
did not think Lindsay would
send in the police.
"I absolutely guaranteed peo
ple there wouldn't be a bust,"
says Jon Shils, a member of the
committee who was involved in

negotiations with the mayor's
aides. Shils and others assumed
Lindsay would be reluctant to
call in police, because their use
against the black students in
Hamilton Hall could be expected
to inflame the residents of neigh
boring Harlem.
According to Shils the strike
committee was prepared to ne
gotiate with Lindsay himself if
he was willing. The mayor de
cided to send in the police, how
ever, and so now the question
of whether or not a bust could
have been avoided is academic.
In any case, the bust proved
to be a major break for the
strikers because it galvanized
student support for their move
ment. In its aftermath the steer
ing committee was expanded by
delegates from a broad spec
trum of student groups on cam
pus, all of them fully in favor of
the strike.
The bust came early in the
morning on Tuesday, April 30.
Later that morning a huge fac
ulty meeting was held to con
sider a vote in favor of the strike.
But at the meeting Westin, who
had helped draw up the reso
lution, said he had decided it
ought to be put to a vote but
should be studied further.
When demands came from the
floor that there be a vote, he
said he was going to leave the
meeting and asked those who
agreed with him to leave also
Several hundred did so.
If the faculty had passe<f
the resolution, or even if a
substantial minority of them
had voted for it, there would
have been the basis for a co
alition between faculty and
students that would luive con
stituted a major bargaining
power.
As it is now, though indivi
dual members of the faculty
support the strike, the faculty as
a whole is fragmented and ap
parently impotent.
Westin has become co-chair
man of a special executive com
mittee, set up at a faculty meet
ing held in the afternoon of
the day of the bust to recom
mend changes in the university's
structure.
Westin and other members
of the committee have said they
plan to involve students in the
study, but it's difficult to imagine
that any students prominently
involved in the strike — a group
that would include many mod
erates who opposed the original
tactics of SDS and the black stu
dents — will have anything to do
with the executive committee.
The administration, mean
while, has further isolated the
faculty by turning down its
recommendations on the disci
plining of students. After the
bust the faculty passed a reso
lution, saying that criminal

charges against the students
should be dropped.
Last Thursday, Columbia
President Grayson Kirk said
he would not drop the charges.
In addition, he refused to sur
render ultimiate disciplinary
authority over the students to
a tripartite committee that
was set up during the occupa
tion of the buildings.
Kirk's intransigence may have
the effect of aligning the fac
ulty with the striking students,
but it just as likely could create
new divisions and sub-divisions
in the faculty. In any case, it is
difficult to see how the faculty
can become ar effective middle
voice at this stage of the situa
tion.
Meanwhile, the strike con
tinues at Columbia. There is no
way of gauging how successful
the strike has been, nor would
there be even if official counters
were to attend each class and
tally up the students, because
formal classes at Columbia Col
lege have been called off, and
many students have no doubt
simply gone home for the rest
of the semester.
But the question of how many
students are attending classes is
irrelevant, anyway. The crucial
question is who is running Co
lumbia.
For anyone who has visited
the campus since the bust, the
answer to that question is not
immediately evident. It's not
that the campus is in an ad
vanced state of seige, although
police are in fact stationed
all around the outside of it,
nor that total anarchy has
broken out.
Rather there is an ambiguous
atmosphere to the scene. First,
the strike is immediately evi
dent, because at almost anytime
of the day the strikers will be
holding rallies in the huge cen
tral court yard in front of Low
Library, or else trying to drum
up volunteers to picket class
room buildings over an incred
ibly loud public address system.
Since I left Columbia last Wed
nesday, I've learned that the pub
lic address equipment has been
more or less destroyed by the
students who oppose the strike,
so that the level of noise has
gone down.
On the other hand, two of
the communes — groups that
were formed by students in each
of the occupied buildings — have
set up parachutes on campus
as tents. The parachutes are
dyed red.
It is also reported that some
of the athletes who have been
most vehemently opposed to the
strike were taken into these out
door communes yesterday, and
have thus been "radicalized."
All of these circumstances
are an obvious afront to the
administration, and yet so far

the administration has made
no attempt to counter the
strikers' activities, and has
b<N*n content to\ Issue an
nouncements that Columbia
has returned to normal.
For the moment, therefore, it
appears that the strikers have
the upper hand. The strikers do
have serious organizational prob
lems, many of them stemming
from the enormous size of the
current steering committee.
One of the few ways the ad
ministration could regain con
trol, short of bringing the po
lice back on campus and setting
up a more or less permanent
garrison, would be for them to
split the steering committee. The
committee has reportedly had
some serious rifts already.
There was heavy debate, for
example, over the question
whether or not letters taken
from President Kirk's tile ought
to be published (ultimately they
were). So far the committee has
managed to hold itself together,
however. Yet even if the com
mittee stays together, the strik
ers have other problems.
Whatever happens, though, the
strike has clearly had some use
ful consequences. There has
probably never been so much
discussion among members of
a university community about
what a university ought to be.
There has been a mild, almost
bloodless semi-revolution; there
has been a sudden change in the
direction of greater freedom;
there is an unprecedented sense
the old system will bo reimposed
by force, or that the radicals
will push the shaky new sys
tem beyond its limits; and yet,
while the revolution continues,
there is an unprecdented sense
of old structures being taken
away, and the paths opened for
now departures.



AND AROUND AND AROUND THEY GO — For fifty laps around Wilbur, to be exact. It was
the annual Con Home Bike Race held last Saturday. The winning team was the defending: champ
lon, Crothers Memorial, taking the event with a time of 62 minutes, 17 seconds. The Frosh Crew,
having rowed earlier that morning, came in second.
