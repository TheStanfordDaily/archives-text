# Spring Football '68
## Stanford Adopts Pro Style Offense 
### GARY CAVALLI 
1968 may well be remembered
as the "year of the pass" in
Stanford football history.
During past years the Tribe
has relied heavily on roll-out
options by the quarterback, with
running plays the key offensive
weapon. But next fall Coach
John Rlaston is planning on
making the switch to a pro-type,
drop-back passing attack.
The main reason for the
change is 6-3, 200-pound quar
terback Jim Plunkett, a red
shirt last year with three
seasons of eligibility remain
ing. Plunkett is a strong, accu
rate passer, who Ralston con
siders "better suited to the
pro-type offense."
"We feel Plunkett is a guy
we can build on," confided Ral
ston, "and we intend to. He's
got a very strong arm, and
possesses some very fine qual
ities."
Besides Plunkett, the Indian
quarterbacking corps will in
clude Don Bunco, Ron Fuji
kawa, and baseball star Mark
Marquess.
Bunce, a sophomor**, and
Fujikawa, who shared the
quarterbacking chores with
Plunkett on the 1966 frosh
squad and red shir ted last
year, "have come along in
tine shap*-," according to Ral
ston.
Marquess, the team's most ex

perienced signal-caller, divided
the starting assignments with
Chuck Williams in 1967, his
junior year. A scrambler whose
quickness rather than throwing
accuracy proved to be his major
asset, Marquess may have trou
ble fitting into the new style
offense.
The quarterbacking—while in
exeprienced—provides just one
example of the depth that the
'68 Indian squad should have.
Despite the loss of seven key
men to graduation—defensive
end Tom Hazelrlgg, defensive
tackle Blaine Nye, confer Don
Swartz, Williams, defensive half
Donn Renwick, fullback Jack
Root, linebacker Marty Brill—
Ralston feels he has the talent
to replace them. The return of
31 lettermen gives Stanford an
experienced man at nearly every
position.
Thus far in spring drills,
Ralston has been most pleased
with the play of senior full
back Greg Broughton, junior
linebacker Don Parish, and
flanker Jack Lasater (a soph
omore, eligibility-wise).
Broughton has been "contin
uing to develop into a strong
running back," while Parish,
making the switch from de
fensive end, "has been outstand
ing" in Ralston's estimation. The
fast-improving Lasater, who
moved to flanker from the half
back spot, has been one of the

big surprises of spring practice.
Parish and Lasater are only
two of seven key prospects who
have switched positions. Junior
Bob Reinhard has been moved
from linebacker to tight end,
where he is engaged in a three
way battle for the starting berth
with sophomore Ron Kadziel
and Bob Moore (who red-shirted
last year and has three years
of eligibility left).
Ace place kicker Bill Shoe
maker, who was a flanker in
196, now operates as the rov
ing linebacker or "mover" on
defense. Last fall's freshman
MVP, Jim Kauffman, has
switched from flanker to de
fensive hack. According to
Italston, Kauffman "should be
outstanding" in the Tribe sec
ondary next season.
Former offensive end George
Buehler (senior) moved to de
fensive tackle, and senior Tom
Weingartner has switched from
linebacker to defensive end.
Besides Bunce, Kauffman and
Kadziel, Ralston has been very
impressed by seven other sopho
more prospects—halfback Jack
Schultz, end Tom Sones, tackles
Bill Alexander and Larry But
ler, linebacker Tim McClure, and
centers Steve Jubb and John
Sande.
Two other new faces mak
ing their apitearance at the
Indian spring drills are assist
ant coaches .Jack Christiansen
and Bob Waters. Christiansen,
the former San Francisco 49er
coach, is working with llne
baekers, while Waters, a for
nier defensive hack and
quarterback with the 49ers,
is working with the receiving
corps.
Several members of the team
have missed spring practice, in
cluding those engaged in spring
athletics (such as Kauffman and
flanker Gene Washington) and
others on the mend (such as
Buehler).
Stanford's leading ground
gainer last season, Nate Kirt
nian, has passed up spring
drills because of involvement
in helping the people of his
race. Kirtman, who tutors
black high school students in
East Palo Alto and is a mem
ber of Stanford's Human Re
lations Commission, reported
ly still hopes to play for the
Indians in the fall.
Last Saturday the Reds beat
the Whites in the first intra
squad game in Stanford Sta
dium. The second-string offense,
quarterbacked by Bunce and
Fujikawa, combined with the
first-line defense to upend the

first offense-second defense tan
dem 9-6.
The only score generated by
the Plunkett-led first eleven
(Whites) came after an inter
ference call gave them the ball
on the one yard line. Then
Broughton plowed over for the
touchdown.
The elusive Fujikawa fired
a 55-yard aerial to Lasater,
who had out raced the White
secondary, for the Red tally.
Bunce also looked impressive,
faking, running and handling
the ball well, but couldn't
engineer a sustained drive.
Plunkett showed his ability to
throw the ball far, if not always
straight, and ran well. The
White running backs could man
age only two yards-per-carry,
and this bogged down the at
tack on numerous occasions.
Both defenses did the Job.
The first string bottled up
Plunkett and company most
of the afternoon, looking fast,
tough, and aggressive. Parish
krdfed through the line to
make several jarring tackles,
while Shoemaker and Weln

gartner showed their switches
have been successful with ex
cellent efforts.
Ralston was "generally fairly
pleased" with the game, and felt
that the quarterbacking "loked
good, for the most part."
"If you score too much
against yourself you worry
about the defense, but if you
don't score enough you worry
about the offense," the Tribe
mentor commented, "but this
was an even game."
This Saturday afternoon the
same two squads will meet
again in the final Red-White
encounter, marking the end of
spring practice. With the track
season at an end, speedsters
Washington and Kauffman will
be participating for virtually the
first time this spring.

kawa, and baseball star Mark
Marquess.
Bunce, a sophomor**, and
Fujikawa, who shared the
quarterbacking chores with
Plunkett on the 1966 frosh
squad and red shir ted last
year, "have come along in
tine shap*-," according to Ral
ston.
Marquess, the team's most ex

perienced signal-caller, divided
the starting assignments with
Chuck Williams in 1967, his
junior year. A scrambler whose
quickness rather than throwing
accuracy proved to be his major
asset, Marquess may have trou
ble fitting into the new style
offense.
The quarterbacking—while in
exeprienced—provides just one
example of the depth that the
'68 Indian squad should have.
Despite the loss of seven key
men to graduation—defensive
end Tom Hazelrlgg, defensive
tackle Blaine Nye, confer Don
Swartz, Williams, defensive half
Donn Renwick, fullback Jack
Root, linebacker Marty Brill—
Ralston feels he has the talent
to replace them. The return of
31 lettermen gives Stanford an
experienced man at nearly every
position.
Thus far in spring drills,
Ralston has been most pleased
with the play of senior full
back Greg Broughton, junior
linebacker Don Parish, and
flanker Jack Lasater (a soph
omore, eligibility-wise).
Broughton has been "contin
uing to develop into a strong
running back," while Parish,
making the switch from de
fensive end, "has been outstand
ing" in Ralston's estimation. The
fast-improving Lasater, who
moved to flanker from the half
back spot, has been one of the

big surprises of spring practice.
Parish and Lasater are only
two of seven key prospects who
have switched positions. Junior
Bob Reinhard has been moved
from linebacker to tight end,
where he is engaged in a three
way battle for the starting berth
with sophomore Ron Kadziel
and Bob Moore (who red-shirted
last year and has three years
of eligibility left).
Ace place kicker Bill Shoe
maker, who was a flanker in
196, now operates as the rov
ing linebacker or "mover" on
defense. Last fall's freshman
MVP, Jim Kauffman, has
switched from flanker to de
fensive hack. According to
Italston, Kauffman "should be
outstanding" in the Tribe sec
ondary next season.
Former offensive end George
Buehler (senior) moved to de
fensive tackle, and senior Tom
Weingartner has switched from
linebacker to defensive end.
Besides Bunce, Kauffman and
Kadziel, Ralston has been very
impressed by seven other sopho
more prospects—halfback Jack
Schultz, end Tom Sones, tackles
Bill Alexander and Larry But
ler, linebacker Tim McClure, and
centers Steve Jubb and John
Sande.
Two other new faces mak
ing their apitearance at the
Indian spring drills are assist
ant coaches .Jack Christiansen
and Bob Waters. Christiansen,
the former San Francisco 49er
coach, is working with llne
baekers, while Waters, a for
nier defensive hack and
quarterback with the 49ers,
is working with the receiving
corps.
Several members of the team
have missed spring practice, in
cluding those engaged in spring
athletics (such as Kauffman and
flanker Gene Washington) and
others on the mend (such as
Buehler).
Stanford's leading ground
gainer last season, Nate Kirt
nian, has passed up spring
drills because of involvement
in helping the people of his
race. Kirtman, who tutors
black high school students in
East Palo Alto and is a mem
ber of Stanford's Human Re
lations Commission, reported
ly still hopes to play for the
Indians in the fall.
Last Saturday the Reds beat
the Whites in the first intra
squad game in Stanford Sta
dium. The second-string offense,
quarterbacked by Bunce and
Fujikawa, combined with the
first-line defense to upend the

first offense-second defense tan
dem 9-6.
The only score generated by
the Plunkett-led first eleven
(Whites) came after an inter
ference call gave them the ball
on the one yard line. Then
Broughton plowed over for the
touchdown.
The elusive Fujikawa fired
a 55-yard aerial to Lasater,
who had out raced the White
secondary, for the Red tally.
Bunce also looked impressive,
faking, running and handling
the ball well, but couldn't
engineer a sustained drive.
Plunkett showed his ability to
throw the ball far, if not always
straight, and ran well. The
White running backs could man
age only two yards-per-carry,
and this bogged down the at
tack on numerous occasions.
Both defenses did the Job.
The first string bottled up
Plunkett and company most
of the afternoon, looking fast,
tough, and aggressive. Parish
krdfed through the line to
make several jarring tackles,
while Shoemaker and Weln

gartner showed their switches
have been successful with ex
cellent efforts.
Ralston was "generally fairly
pleased" with the game, and felt
that the quarterbacking "loked
good, for the most part."
"If you score too much
against yourself you worry
about the defense, but if you
don't score enough you worry
about the offense," the Tribe
mentor commented, "but this
was an even game."
This Saturday afternoon the
same two squads will meet
again in the final Red-White
encounter, marking the end of
spring practice. With the track
season at an end, speedsters
Washington and Kauffman will
be participating for virtually the
first time this spring.

BUNCE RAMBLES — Sophomore quarterback Don Bunee (I) tries
to elude a would-be tackier as he skirts the left end In the opening
minutes of Saturday's contest. Bunee completed 7 of 14 passes for
f»6 yards.
1968 may well be remembered
as the "year of the pass" in
Stanford football history.
During past years the Tribe
has relied heavily on roll-out
options by the quarterback, with
running plays the key offensive
weapon. But next fall Coach
John Rlaston is planning on
making the switch to a pro-type,
drop-back passing attack.
The main reason for the
change is 6-3, 200-pound quar

seasons of eligibility remain

to replace them. The return of
31 lettermen gives Stanford an
experienced man at nearly every
position.
Thus far in spring drills,
Ralston has been most pleased
with the play of senior full
back Greg Broughton, junior
linebacker Don Parish, and
flanker Jack Lasater (a soph
omore, eligibility-wise).
Broughton has been "contin
uing to develop into a strong
running back," while Parish,
making the switch from de
fensive end, "has been outstand
ing" in Ralston's estimation. The
fast-improving Lasater, who
moved to flanker from the half
back spot, has been one of the

big surprises of spring practice.
Parish and Lasater are only
two of seven key prospects who
have switched positions. Junior
Bob Reinhard has been moved
from linebacker to tight end,
where he is engaged in a three
way battle for the starting berth
with sophomore Ron Kadziel
and Bob Moore (who red-shirted
last year and has three years
of eligibility left).
Ace place kicker Bill Shoe
maker, who was a flanker in
196, now operates as the rov
ing linebacker or "mover" on
defense. Last fall's freshman
MVP, Jim Kauffman, has
switched from flanker to de
fensive hack. According to
Italston, Kauffman "should be
outstanding" in the Tribe sec
ondary next season.
Former offensive end George
Buehler (senior) moved to de
fensive tackle, and senior Tom
Weingartner has switched from
linebacker to defensive end.
Besides Bunce, Kauffman and
Kadziel, Ralston has been very
impressed by seven other sopho
more prospects—halfback Jack
Schultz, end Tom Sones, tackles
Bill Alexander and Larry But
ler, linebacker Tim McClure, and
centers Steve Jubb and John
Sande.
Two other new faces mak
ing their apitearance at the
Indian spring drills are assist
ant coaches .Jack Christiansen
and Bob Waters. Christiansen,
the former San Francisco 49er
coach, is working with llne
baekers, while Waters, a for
nier defensive hack and
quarterback with the 49ers,
is working with the receiving
corps.
Several members of the team
have missed spring practice, in
cluding those engaged in spring
athletics (such as Kauffman and
flanker Gene Washington) and
others on the mend (such as
Buehler).
Stanford's leading ground
gainer last season, Nate Kirt
nian, has passed up spring
drills because of involvement
in helping the people of his
race. Kirtman, who tutors
black high school students in
East Palo Alto and is a mem
ber of Stanford's Human Re
lations Commission, reported
ly still hopes to play for the
Indians in the fall.
Last Saturday the Reds beat
the Whites in the first intra
squad game in Stanford Sta
dium. The second-string offense,
quarterbacked by Bunce and
Fujikawa, combined with the
first-line defense to upend the

first offense-second defense tan
dem 9-6.
The only score generated by
the Plunkett-led first eleven
(Whites) came after an inter
ference call gave them the ball
on the one yard line. Then
Broughton plowed over for the
touchdown.
The elusive Fujikawa fired
a 55-yard aerial to Lasater,
who had out raced the White
secondary, for the Red tally.
Bunce also looked impressive,
faking, running and handling
the ball well, but couldn't
engineer a sustained drive.
Plunkett showed his ability to
throw the ball far, if not always
straight, and ran well. The
White running backs could man
age only two yards-per-carry,
and this bogged down the at
tack on numerous occasions.
Both defenses did the Job.
The first string bottled up
Plunkett and company most
of the afternoon, looking fast,
tough, and aggressive. Parish
krdfed through the line to
make several jarring tackles,
while Shoemaker and Weln

gartner showed their switches
have been successful with ex
cellent efforts.
Ralston was "generally fairly
pleased" with the game, and felt
that the quarterbacking "loked
good, for the most part."
"If you score too much
against yourself you worry
about the defense, but if you
don't score enough you worry
about the offense," the Tribe
mentor commented, "but this
was an even game."
This Saturday afternoon the
same two squads will meet
again in the final Red-White
encounter, marking the end of
spring practice. With the track
season at an end, speedsters
Washington and Kauffman will
be participating for virtually the
first time this spring.

BUNCE RAMBLES — Sophomore quarterback Don Bunee (I) tries
to elude a would-be tackier as he skirts the left end In the opening
minutes of Saturday's contest. Bunee completed 7 of 14 passes for
f»6 yards.
1968 may well be remembered
as the "year of the pass" in
Stanford football history.
During past years the Tribe
has relied heavily on roll-out
options by the quarterback, with
running plays the key offensive
weapon. But next fall Coach
John Rlaston is planning on
making the switch to a pro-type,
drop-back passing attack.
The main reason for the
change is 6-3, 200-pound quar
terback Jim Plunkett, a red
shirt last year with three
seasons of eligibility remain
ing. Plunkett is a strong, accu
rate passer, who Ralston con
siders "better suited to the
pro-type offense."
"We feel Plunkett is a guy
we can build on," confided Ral
ston, "and we intend to. He's
got a very strong arm, and
possesses some very fine qual
ities."
Besides Plunkett, the Indian
quarterbacking corps will in
clude Don Bunco, Ron Fuji
kawa, and baseball star Mark
Marquess.
Bunce, a sophomor**, and
Fujikawa, who shared the
quarterbacking chores with
Plunkett on the 1966 frosh
squad and red shir ted last
year, "have come along in
tine shap*-," according to Ral
ston.
Marquess, the team's most ex

perienced signal-caller, divided
the starting assignments with
Chuck Williams in 1967, his
junior year. A scrambler whose
quickness rather than throwing
accuracy proved to be his major
asset, Marquess may have trou
ble fitting into the new style
offense.
The quarterbacking—while in
exeprienced—provides just one
example of the depth that the
'68 Indian squad should have.
Despite the loss of seven key
men to graduation—defensive
end Tom Hazelrlgg, defensive
tackle Blaine Nye, confer Don
Swartz, Williams, defensive half
Donn Renwick, fullback Jack
Root, linebacker Marty Brill—
Ralston feels he has the talent

Ace place kicker Bill Shoe
maker, who was a flanker in
196, now operates as the rov
ing linebacker or "mover" on
defense. Last fall's freshman
MVP, Jim Kauffman, has
switched from flanker to de
fensive hack. According to
Italston, Kauffman "should be
outstanding" in the Tribe sec
ondary next season.
Former offensive end George
Buehler (senior) moved to de
fensive tackle, and senior Tom
Weingartner has switched from
linebacker to defensive end.
Besides Bunce, Kauffman and
Kadziel, Ralston has been very
impressed by seven other sopho
more prospects—halfback Jack
Schultz, end Tom Sones, tackles
Bill Alexander and Larry But
ler, linebacker Tim McClure, and
centers Steve Jubb and John
Sande.
Two other new faces mak
ing their apitearance at the
Indian spring drills are assist
ant coaches .Jack Christiansen
and Bob Waters. Christiansen,
the former San Francisco 49er
coach, is working with llne
baekers, while Waters, a for
nier defensive hack and
quarterback with the 49ers,
is working with the receiving
corps.
Several members of the team
have missed spring practice, in
cluding those engaged in spring
athletics (such as Kauffman and
flanker Gene Washington) and
others on the mend (such as
Buehler).
Stanford's leading ground
gainer last season, Nate Kirt
nian, has passed up spring
drills because of involvement
in helping the people of his
race. Kirtman, who tutors
black high school students in
East Palo Alto and is a mem
ber of Stanford's Human Re
lations Commission, reported
ly still hopes to play for the
Indians in the fall.
Last Saturday the Reds beat
the Whites in the first intra
squad game in Stanford Sta
dium. The second-string offense,
quarterbacked by Bunce and
Fujikawa, combined with the
first-line defense to upend the

first offense-second defense tan
dem 9-6.
The only score generated by
the Plunkett-led first eleven
(Whites) came after an inter
ference call gave them the ball
on the one yard line. Then
Broughton plowed over for the
touchdown.
The elusive Fujikawa fired
a 55-yard aerial to Lasater,
who had out raced the White
secondary, for the Red tally.
Bunce also looked impressive,
faking, running and handling
the ball well, but couldn't
engineer a sustained drive.
Plunkett showed his ability to
throw the ball far, if not always
straight, and ran well. The
White running backs could man
age only two yards-per-carry,
and this bogged down the at
tack on numerous occasions.
Both defenses did the Job.
The first string bottled up
Plunkett and company most
of the afternoon, looking fast,
tough, and aggressive. Parish
krdfed through the line to
make several jarring tackles,
while Shoemaker and Weln

gartner showed their switches
have been successful with ex
cellent efforts.
Ralston was "generally fairly
pleased" with the game, and felt
that the quarterbacking "loked
good, for the most part."
"If you score too much
against yourself you worry
about the defense, but if you
don't score enough you worry
about the offense," the Tribe
mentor commented, "but this
was an even game."
This Saturday afternoon the
same two squads will meet
again in the final Red-White
encounter, marking the end of
spring practice. With the track
season at an end, speedsters
Washington and Kauffman will
be participating for virtually the
first time this spring.

BUNCE RAMBLES — Sophomore quarterback Don Bunee (I) tries
to elude a would-be tackier as he skirts the left end In the opening
minutes of Saturday's contest. Bunee completed 7 of 14 passes for
f»6 yards.
1968 may well be remembered
as the "year of the pass" in
Stanford football history.
During past years the Tribe
has relied heavily on roll-out
options by the quarterback, with
running plays the key offensive
weapon. But next fall Coach
John Rlaston is planning on
making the switch to a pro-type,
drop-back passing attack.
The main reason for the
change is 6-3, 200-pound quar
terback Jim Plunkett, a red
shirt last year with three
seasons of eligibility remain
ing. Plunkett is a strong, accu
rate passer, who Ralston con
siders "better suited to the
pro-type offense."
"We feel Plunkett is a guy
we can build on," confided Ral
ston, "and we intend to. He's
got a very strong arm, and
possesses some very fine qual
ities."
Besides Plunkett, the Indian
quarterbacking corps will in
clude Don Bunco, Ron Fuji
kawa, and baseball star Mark
Marquess.
Bunce, a sophomor**, and
Fujikawa, who shared the
quarterbacking chores with
Plunkett on the 1966 frosh
squad and red shir ted last
year, "have come along in
tine shap*-," according to Ral
ston.
Marquess, the team's most ex

perienced signal-caller, divided
the starting assignments with
Chuck Williams in 1967, his
junior year. A scrambler whose
quickness rather than throwing
accuracy proved to be his major
asset, Marquess may have trou
ble fitting into the new style
offense.
The quarterbacking—while in
exeprienced—provides just one
example of the depth that the
'68 Indian squad should have.
Despite the loss of seven key
men to graduation—defensive
end Tom Hazelrlgg, defensive
tackle Blaine Nye, confer Don
Swartz, Williams, defensive half
Donn Renwick, fullback Jack
Root, linebacker Marty Brill—
Ralston feels he has the talent
to replace them. The return of
31 lettermen gives Stanford an
experienced man at nearly every
position.
Thus far in spring drills,
Ralston has been most pleased
with the play of senior full
back Greg Broughton, junior
linebacker Don Parish, and
flanker Jack Lasater (a soph
omore, eligibility-wise).
Broughton has been "contin
uing to develop into a strong
running back," while Parish,
making the switch from de
fensive end, "has been outstand
ing" in Ralston's estimation. The
fast-improving Lasater, who
moved to flanker from the half
back spot, has been one of the

big surprises of spring practice.
Parish and Lasater are only
two of seven key prospects who
have switched positions. Junior
Bob Reinhard has been moved
from linebacker to tight end,
where he is engaged in a three
way battle for the starting berth
with sophomore Ron Kadziel
and Bob Moore (who red-shirted
last year and has three years
of eligibility left).
