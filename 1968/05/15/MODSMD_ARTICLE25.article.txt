# Varsity 'Swamps' Cal, But Bears Grab Cup
## 
### 
The Stanford crew swamped
Cal's varsity Saturday morning,
with a little help from the
weather.
The Cal shell filled with water
200 meters from the start of the
race, and the boat overturned
in the choppy waters of Red
wood City Harbor. The Stanford
crew rowed home alone, with
four men rowing and four men

plus the coxswain bailing water
out of the shell.
Despite the "win" in thd
varsity division, Stanford lost
the first annual Jim Reynolds
Cup when Cal won both frosh
races, the .TV race, and the
third varsity competition.
In the first race the Cal third
varsity took advantage of Stan
ford mistakes in the rough
water to win in a time of 6:38.4,
four seats ahead of Stanford's
6:39.8.
The Bear crew handled the
wind and water more deftly than
Stanford again in the second
frosh race, winning by slightly
under ten seconds in 6:54.5.
At the start of the JV race
Stanford fell quickly behind in
the rough water. The Card crew
gradually caught up to the Cal
shell, however, losing by only
four-tenths of a second. Cal won
with a time of 6:36.6.
A steering error at the begin
ning of the first frosh race left
Stanford more than a length
and a half down. The gap was
closed, but once again not quite
soon enough. Cal won by 1.2
seconds in a time of 6:49.0.
Friday and Saturday the West
ern Sprints will be held in Seat
tle. Preliminary heats will be
held Friday and the finals on
Saturday.
