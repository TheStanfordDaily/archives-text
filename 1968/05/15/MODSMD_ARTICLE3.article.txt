# Palo Alto Council Hikes Price On City's Share Of Hospital
## 
### 
New cash terms have been set
for the Palo Alto-Stanford Hos
pital Center transaction, as the
Palo Alto City Council recently
doubled the price of the city's
share of the Hospital.
Still approving of the sale "in
principle," the council raised the
price from $500,000 to $1 million.
The action was one of five
amendments to the negotiations
going on between Stanford and
Palo Alto officials. Dr. Robert
Glaser, Stanford vice-president
for medical affairs and medical
school dean, said he would have
no immediate statement concern
ing the amendments until after
a discussion of the new terms at
tomorrow's University Board of
Trustees meeting.
Other amendments include a
comprehensive arbitration

clause in the final contract; ex
tending the "courtesy staff" cate
gory to all departments; addi
tion of the term "dental" to a
reference to the medical staff to
include oral surgeons now on
the Palo Alto physician staff;
and a complete definition of
"hospital care."
The transaction terms which
remained intact after the coun
cil vote were the payment of
$3.5 million in city construction
bonds over a 20-year period and
a 40-year guarantee of commu
nity hospital services.
Mayor Frances Dias, au
thorized by the council, an
nounced plans to call a special
meeting of the council to con
sider the university's response
to the new terms after the trus
tees' meeting.

Questioned by the council, Dr.
Glaser emphasized that "the uni
versity can no longer delay tak
ing steps in proceeding with a
university hospital" and that a
decision must be made soon.
Rates and fees at the univer
sity-owned hospital, Glaser
said, would be set according to
procedures whereby patients
would only be billed for services
received, in accordance with
state and federal billing stan
dards.
Palo Alto's share of the hos
pital includes 220 beds at the
main center, 150 beds in the
separate Hoover Pavilion, 33
acres of land leased from Stan
ford and a portion of the cen
ter's operating and equipment
assets and services.
