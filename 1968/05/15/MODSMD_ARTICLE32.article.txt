# Ram's Head 'Carnival' Opens Tomorrow Night
## 
### 
"Carnival!", the 1960 award
winning musical, will open a
two week run at Memorial Au
ditorium tomorrow.
Directed by Robert Morgon,
MFA candidate, and under
the auspices of Ram's Head
Productions, "Carnival" is the
simple story of a young girl
who is forced to grow up in a
harsh and strange world — the
world under the Big Top.
"Carnival in essence is a love
story," says director Morgon, "a
very simple love story about a

girl who faces the problems of
growing up, of learning about
love, and learning how she can
love. In contrast to this simple
and natural story there Is the
Carnival itself — a perfect foil
to simplicity.
"The Carnival is perverted and
unnatural, it is a life totally
alien to Liliy, filled with misfits
of every kind. Its people are dis
illusioned and hardened to the
world Liliy represents, and it is
both through them and in spite
of them that she arrives at a
new view of her own life."
"Carnival!" was the winner of
numerous awards when it first
appeared on Broadway in 1960,
among them the Critics Award
for the best musical of the year.
Morgan attributes this to its
tightly written script, a kind of
simple integrity, and a return to
the best aspects of the older,
romantic form of musical of the
1920'5.
In the role of Liliy is Gretchen
Grant, a veteran of many Ram's
Head productions including the
"Boy Friend" and Gaieties 1965.
Meeting her in the world of the
Carnival are the puppetteers,
played by Peter Van Neil and
Stan Rutherford. Other major
roles are filled by Sergei Tscher
nisch, Lucille Medalis and Char
lie Edelman.
"Carnival" will run May 16,
17, 18, 23, 24 and 25 at Memor
ial Auditorium, with a matinee
on May 18. Tickets are available
at Tresidder Box Office and from
the Ram's Head table in front
of the Post Office.
