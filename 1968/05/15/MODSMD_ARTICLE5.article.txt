## French Students Strike In Protest 
### 
PARIS (AP)—Flying the rod
and black flags of rebellion and
anarchy, students occupied most
of France's 18 universities Tues
day in a seizure that Premier
Georges Pompidou called an in
ternational plot and a "trial of
our civilization."
Shaken by the rebellion and a
censure motion, Pompidou went
before the National Assembly
with offers of new concessions
to the students. Virtually all
their original demands were
met.
Referring to the seizures and
rioting last week in Paris' Latin
Quarter, the premier said the
rebellion involved "individuals,
backed by important financial
means, apparently belonging to
an international organization."
The government apparently
was hinting that Red China
would like the unrest to force
the collapse of negotiations be
tween the United States and
North Vietnam.
• Poor People March
WASHINGTON (AP)—A few

dozen families today began
moving into the hundreds of un
painted plywood Poor People's
Campaign shanties taking shape
in front of the Lincoln Me
morial.
"This is okay, it's better than
what we have at home," said a
Marks, Miss, woman as she
brushed her hand over the ply
wood sides, and the plywood
flooring raised off the ground
with two-by-four joists.
"We're living in little raggedy
houses there, so we might as
well be here," she said.
A privately circulated staff
memo tentatively set next Mon
day for the initial demonstra
tions which it said may provoke
"mass arrests and police brutal
ity."
In Detroit, where marchers
clashed with police the previous
night, Vice President Hubert H.
Humphrey said in the text of an
address to a Negro audience,
progress will not be achieved on
a tightrope with a "balance of
terror."
Sen. Charles H. Percy, R-111.,

visiting the poverty camp to
pound a ceremonial nail in one
shanty, said as long as the cam
paign stays nonviolent and rea
sonable, Congress and the na
tion "must be receptive."
• Genocide Bill Fails
SACRAMENTO (AP) — An
Assembly committee rejected a
perennial measure Tuesday to
make it a crime to incite geno
cide — the mass killing of per
sons because they belong to a
racial or national group.
The hearing included opposi
tion testimony from witnesses
who said they were members of
the American Nazi Party and
the Sons of Liberty.
But Assembly Criminal Pro
cedure Committee members,
most of them lawyers by pro
fession, made it clear their op
position was based on their be
lief that current laws already
would make genocide a crime.
Similar bills have died in past
years.
During testimony by the bill's
opponents, some wearing swas

tika armbands and lapel pins,
Assemblyman John J. Miller,
(D„ Berkeley), commented, "I
don't think we want this to be
a forum for those who want to
castigate Jews."
• Medal Of Honor
WASHINGTON (AP) — Pres
ident Johnson presented the
Medal of Honor to four veterans
of the Vietnam war today, and
expressed hope that talks under
way in Paris will bring an end
to the fighting.
"The world prays that the way
to peace will be found at that
table," Johnson said with refer
ence to talks which started Mon
day. But he noted that very hard
negotiations lie ahead.
The President spoke at cere
monies dedicating a Hall of He
roes at the Pentagon. They in
cluded the presentation of four
Medals of Honor—one each to
a member of the Army, Navy,
Marines and Air Force.
Johnson noted that this
marked the first time that men
representing the four services

had been honored on a single
occasion.

• Poor People March
WASHINGTON (AP)—A few

dozen families today began
moving into the hundreds of un
painted plywood Poor People's
Campaign shanties taking shape
in front of the Lincoln Me
morial.
"This is okay, it's better than
what we have at home," said a
Marks, Miss, woman as she
brushed her hand over the ply
wood sides, and the plywood
flooring raised off the ground
with two-by-four joists.
"We're living in little raggedy
houses there, so we might as
well be here," she said.
A privately circulated staff
memo tentatively set next Mon
day for the initial demonstra
tions which it said may provoke
"mass arrests and police brutal
ity."
In Detroit, where marchers
clashed with police the previous
night, Vice President Hubert H.
Humphrey said in the text of an
address to a Negro audience,
progress will not be achieved on
a tightrope with a "balance of
terror."
Sen. Charles H. Percy, R-111.,

• Genocide Bill Fails
SACRAMENTO (AP) — An
Assembly committee rejected a
perennial measure Tuesday to
make it a crime to incite geno
cide — the mass killing of per
sons because they belong to a
racial or national group.
The hearing included opposi
tion testimony from witnesses
who said they were members of
the American Nazi Party and
the Sons of Liberty.
But Assembly Criminal Pro
cedure Committee members,
most of them lawyers by pro
fession, made it clear their op
position was based on their be
lief that current laws already
would make genocide a crime.
Similar bills have died in past
years.
During testimony by the bill's

Assemblyman John J. Miller,

don't think we want this to be
a forum for those who want to

Referring to the seizures and
rioting last week in Paris' Latin
Quarter, the premier said the
rebellion involved "individuals,
backed by important financial
means, apparently belonging to
an international organization."
The government apparently
was hinting that Red China
would like the unrest to force
the collapse of negotiations be
tween the United States and
North Vietnam.
• Poor People March
WASHINGTON (AP)—A few

dozen families today began
moving into the hundreds of un
painted plywood Poor People's
Campaign shanties taking shape
in front of the Lincoln Me
morial.
"This is okay, it's better than
what we have at home," said a
Marks, Miss, woman as she
brushed her hand over the ply
wood sides, and the plywood
flooring raised off the ground
with two-by-four joists.
"We're living in little raggedy
houses there, so we might as
well be here," she said.
A privately circulated staff
memo tentatively set next Mon
day for the initial demonstra
tions which it said may provoke
"mass arrests and police brutal
ity."
In Detroit, where marchers
clashed with police the previous
night, Vice President Hubert H.
Humphrey said in the text of an
address to a Negro audience,
progress will not be achieved on
a tightrope with a "balance of
terror."
Sen. Charles H. Percy, R-111.,

visiting the poverty camp to
pound a ceremonial nail in one
shanty, said as long as the cam
paign stays nonviolent and rea
sonable, Congress and the na
tion "must be receptive."
• Genocide Bill Fails
SACRAMENTO (AP) — An
Assembly committee rejected a
perennial measure Tuesday to
make it a crime to incite geno
cide — the mass killing of per
sons because they belong to a
racial or national group.
The hearing included opposi
tion testimony from witnesses
who said they were members of
the American Nazi Party and
the Sons of Liberty.
But Assembly Criminal Pro
cedure Committee members,
most of them lawyers by pro
fession, made it clear their op
position was based on their be
lief that current laws already
would make genocide a crime.
Similar bills have died in past
years.
During testimony by the bill's
opponents, some wearing swas

tika armbands and lapel pins,
Assemblyman John J. Miller,
(D„ Berkeley), commented, "I
don't think we want this to be
a forum for those who want to
castigate Jews."

ence to talks which started Mon
