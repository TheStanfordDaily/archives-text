# Pot Charges Dismissed, Ruling Sets Precedent
## 
### 
Charges have been dismissed
against two Stanford students
arrested in March for smoking
marijuana in Breaker's eating
club.
In a preliminary hearing yes
terday, the judge dismissed the
charges against David Menasian
and Eric Miller. The judge ac
cepted the contention of de
fense attorney William Keogh
that Stanford police had no right
to enter the eating club.
The judge ruled that Break
er's is private property, which
police needed a search warrant
to enter.
Furthermore, the judge ruled

that the Stanford police, who are
private citizens rather than peace
officers, needed a warrant to
enter the club. Previously only
actual police officers needed such
permission. Keogh said this sets
a definite precedent for future
cases.
The two were arrested March
15 at 4:30 a.m. by Stanford po
lice who said they observed the
pair passing a homemade pipe
between them in the lounge of
Breakers. Stanford officers de
tained the two at the Stanford
police station until Santa Clara
county deputies arrived to take
custody.
