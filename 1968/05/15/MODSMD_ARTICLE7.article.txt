# Profiling A Student Radical: Weissman Explains Views
## 
### SUSAN SWARD 
Steve Weissman is a bearded,
freckle-faced individual who is
commonly described as "a for
mer FSM leader at Berkeley."
He is twenty-eight years old.
He received an M.A. from the
University of Michigan and took
one graduate course at Berkeley
before he quit to work with SDS
against the war in mid-1965. At
Berkeley he was chairman of the
graduate students in the Free
Speech Movement.
At present, Weissman lives in
San Francisco and is a graduate
student in Latin American Stud
ies at Stanford. He is studying
Brazil.
His part in the sit-in in the
Old Union last week has made
his face more familiar to Stan
ford. He claims that the sin
gin most important gain of
the sit-in was to build a con
sciousness of the necessity of
student power.
Weissman notes, "The biggest
block to student or faculty
power is the students and fac
ulty themselves. Once either
group settles for getting power
and not for a 'realistic second
they'll get power."
Weissman hopes that when
the faculty saw Provost Lyman
demand a roll call vote last week
at the Academic Council meet
ing on the sit-in, they developed
some consciousness of the need
for faculty power.
Commenting on the Board of
Trustees, Weissman explains
that he is for eliminating the
control of the University by

anything that remotely repre
sents the Board of Trustees.
"Even if the Trustees made
their money more honestly
than Leland Stanford Sr., and
I'm not sure of that," he says,
"the riches of the Board of
Trustees should not give them
control over a social utility
such as education."
Weissman expanded his re
marks to cover public institu
tions, like UC. It isn't satisfac
tory that the governor appoints
wealthy people to the Board of
Regents, he says; such a system
of appointment only serves to
integrate the university into the
overall priorities of the estab
lished liberal society.
These priorities are that:
• Monopolistic corporations
become the dominant institu
tions in American society, with
increasing direct social respon
sibility for social reform.
• International responsibility
is taken for economic, cultural,
political development.
• Increasing emphasis is
placed on administrative and
consensus decision making with
elections and politics serving the
role of religious spectacle.
• Increasing integration of in

ternational and national decision
making takes place.
Weissman points out that he
cannot condone these priorities
and finds himself in the position
—along with other radicals—of
defending a very old program:
isolationism, populist democra
cy and opposition to large scale
corporations.
" 'Liberal' to me Is a bad
word," Weissman says."The
view liberals have of the
world Isn't adequate to deal
with the problems they want
to deal with."
"Radicals believe the truth of
the whole determines the truth
of the parts. Liberals focus on
parts and tacitly accept the
working of the whole as they do
so."
Focusing on the 1968 Presiden
tial election, Weissman blasted
all the candidates from Nixon to
McCarthy. "Everyone of the
candidates in the election is mak
ing it a farce by not talking
about the real issues involved in
getting out of Vietnam," he said.
"All assume that the United
States must be fully involved
abroad and that Vietnam is sim
ply the wrong war in the wrong
place," he said.
Weissman especially com
plained that none of the candi
dates have made clear why the
business community is tired of
the war.
"Besides the fact that we're
losing the war, businessmen
are concerned with the war
time inflation which threatens
our balanee of payments, our
gold stock and the internation
al monetary system. But un
derlying the whole problem is
the fact that American busi
nessmen iLsed our gold stock
buying up the most significant
sectors of European industry
with the cooperation of the
government."
Commenting on Stanford's ad
ministration, Weissman said he
thought it was one of the most
liberal in the country. On some
social problems it is on the
whole more progressive than
many students.
Nevertheless, it is the same
administration that has been re
sponsible for making Stanford
and the Stanford Research In
stitute among the top university
defense contractors in the coun
try, he pointed out.
Weissman gave an example of
his criticism of the administra
tion. Concerning Vietnam in the
Days of Concern, the adminis
tration wanted both sides to be
heard. But in the process of
clarifying what the two sides

were, the administration defined
which question the students
should be objective about.
According to Weissman, a
similar situation occurred re
garding the Martin Luther
King Fund. Administrators,
he said, never seriously dealt
with the fact that there are at
least two very different polit
ical strategies for dealing
with the situation of black
people: a liberal integration
strategy and a black power
militant strategy.
On these questions the admin
istrators weren't interested in
"airing both sides." In fact they
purposefully kept the Fund from
being used to support black
power groups.
Weissman pointed to specific
tactics students should use at
this time. The ASSU should be
dissolved. People should use
their positions on advisory com
mittees and the C 15 to legiti
mate student power demands.
Furthermore, students should
attempt to find a viable form for
their emerging radicalism. A di
rect involvement with groups in
the ghetto, with students groups
internationally and with revolu
tionary movements of underde
veloped nations should proceed
immediately.
Finally, Weissman criticized
the idea of the university as an
autonomous body—a pleasant
place to live While the world
burns.
