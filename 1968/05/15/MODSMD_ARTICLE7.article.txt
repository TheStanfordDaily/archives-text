# Profiling A Student Radical: Weissman Explains Views
## 
### SUSAN SWARD 
Steve Weissman is a bearded,
freckle-faced individual who is
commonly described as "a for
mer FSM leader at Berkeley."
He is twenty-eight years old.
He received an M.A. from the
University of Michigan and took
one graduate course at Berkeley
before he quit to work with SDS
against the war in mid-1965. At
Berkeley he was chairman of the
graduate students in the Free
Speech Movement.
At present, Weissman lives in
San Francisco and is a graduate
student in Latin American Stud
ies at Stanford. He is studying
Brazil.
His part in the sit-in in the
Old Union last week has made
his face more familiar to Stan
ford. He claims that the sin
gin most important gain of
the sit-in was to build a con
sciousness of the necessity of
student power.
Weissman notes, "The biggest
block to student or faculty
power is the students and fac
ulty themselves. Once either
group settles for getting power
and not for a 'realistic second
they'll get power."
Weissman hopes that when
the faculty saw Provost Lyman
demand a roll call vote last week
at the Academic Council meet
ing on the sit-in, they developed
some consciousness of the need
for faculty power.
Commenting on the Board of
Trustees, Weissman explains
that he is for eliminating the
control of the University by

anything that remotely repre
sents the Board of Trustees.
"Even if the Trustees made
their money more honestly
than Leland Stanford Sr., and
I'm not sure of that," he says,
"the riches of the Board of
Trustees should not give them
control over a social utility
such as education."
Weissman expanded his re
marks to cover public institu
tions, like UC. It isn't satisfac
tory that the governor appoints
wealthy people to the Board of
Regents, he says; such a system
of appointment only serves to
integrate the university into the
overall priorities of the estab
lished liberal society.
These priorities are that:
• Monopolistic corporations
become the dominant institu
tions in American society, with
increasing direct social respon
sibility for social reform.
• International responsibility
is taken for economic, cultural,
political development.
• Increasing emphasis is
placed on administrative and
consensus decision making with
elections and politics serving the
role of religious spectacle.
• Increasing integration of in

ternational and national decision
making takes place.
Weissman points out that he
cannot condone these priorities
and finds himself in the position
—along with other radicals—of
defending a very old program:
isolationism, populist democra
cy and opposition to large scale
corporations.
" 'Liberal' to me Is a bad
word," Weissman says."The
view liberals have of the
world Isn't adequate to deal
with the problems they want
to deal with."
"Radicals believe the truth of
the whole determines the truth
of the parts. Liberals focus on
parts and tacitly accept the
working of the whole as they do
so."
Focusing on the 1968 Presiden
tial election, Weissman blasted
all the candidates from Nixon to
McCarthy. "Everyone of the
candidates in the election is mak
ing it a farce by not talking
about the real issues involved in
getting out of Vietnam," he said.
"All assume that the United
States must be fully involved
abroad and that Vietnam is sim
