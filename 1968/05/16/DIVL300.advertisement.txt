"SHADOWS OF FORGOTTEN ANCESTORS"
SHADOWS 7:15, 10:50; NEVSKY 8:10, 11:50
The Nature of Temptation
Every one of us is both male and female—we've received equal genetic
heritages from both parents. Though dominantly and externally either male
or female, the contra-sexual components of our personality, in the unconscious
mind, play an important role in our functioning as total persons in the world.
The war between the sexes, for example, is not primarily an external problem,
but an internal one. Somehow we need to get married inside in order to
accept ourselves as we really are and become whole.
James in the New Testament says that all temptation to sin comes from
within ourselves, and that all human evil is produced internally by a process
resembling sexual intercourse:
"Each man is tempted," James writes, "When he is lured and enticed by
his own desire. Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and
sin when it is full grown brings forth death" (James 1:13-15).
According to this passage of Scripture, the self-centered person who follows
the dictates of his inner urges in the pursuit of sex, power, prestige, wealth
or glory experiences in the long run only death. The "children of death"
which grow and are reproduced within ourselves include boredom, loneliness,
despair, guilt, anxiety, emptiness and moral bankruptcy. Death, according
to the Bible, is simply the absence of real life.
Spiritual intercourse with our Creator, coming to "know" God by opening
our hearts fully to His love, breaks the internal ties of human selfishness,
and an inner marriage of contra-sexual opposites results. "He who is joined
to the Lord", the Apostle Paul says, becomes one spirit together with God."
The first and greatest commandment of Moses, "You shall love the Lord
your God with all your heart and with all your mind and with all your soul
and with all your might," indicates that God has always intended man to
live exclusively for God and God alone. Only then is our inner sexuality
in gear, and our relationships with others in line with the second command
ment, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." In fact, the Bible says the
man who loves the world system in preference to God is actually prostituting
himself. James continues, "Youadulteresses. Do you not know that friendship
with the world (system) is enmity with God. Therefore whoever wishes to be
a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God" (James 4:4).
It was Jesus Christ who said, "He who seeks to save his own life will lose
it, but he who loses his life for my sake will find it." Real life, God tells us,
is to be lived unselfishly for others. The man who thinks otherwise simply
cuts himself off from others, from reality and in the end destroys himself
from within.

accept ourselves as we really are and become whole.
James in the New Testament says that all temptation to sin comes from
within ourselves, and that all human evil is produced internally by a process
resembling sexual intercourse:
"Each man is tempted," James writes, "When he is lured and enticed by
his own desire. Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and
sin when it is full grown brings forth death" (James 1:13-15).
According to this passage of Scripture, the self-centered person who follows
the dictates of his inner urges in the pursuit of sex, power, prestige, wealth
or glory experiences in the long run only death. The "children of death"
which grow and are reproduced within ourselves include boredom, loneliness,
despair, guilt, anxiety, emptiness and moral bankruptcy. Death, according
to the Bible, is simply the absence of real life.
Spiritual intercourse with our Creator, coming to "know" God by opening
our hearts fully to His love, breaks the internal ties of human selfishness,
and an inner marriage of contra-sexual opposites results. "He who is joined
to the Lord", the Apostle Paul says, becomes one spirit together with God."
The first and greatest commandment of Moses, "You shall love the Lord
your God with all your heart and with all your mind and with all your soul
and with all your might," indicates that God has always intended man to
live exclusively for God and God alone. Only then is our inner sexuality
in gear, and our relationships with others in line with the second command
ment, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." In fact, the Bible says the
man who loves the world system in preference to God is actually prostituting
himself. James continues, "Youadulteresses. Do you not know that friendship
with the world (system) is enmity with God. Therefore whoever wishes to be
a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God" (James 4:4).
It was Jesus Christ who said, "He who seeks to save his own life will lose
it, but he who loses his life for my sake will find it." Real life, God tells us,
is to be lived unselfishly for others. The man who thinks otherwise simply
cuts himself off from others, from reality and in the end destroys himself
from within.

The Nature of Temptation
Every one of us is both male and female—we've received equal genetic
heritages from both parents. Though dominantly and externally either male
or female, the contra-sexual components of our personality, in the unconscious
mind, play an important role in our functioning as total persons in the world.
The war between the sexes, for example, is not primarily an external problem,
but an internal one. Somehow we need to get married inside in order to
accept ourselves as we really are and become whole.
