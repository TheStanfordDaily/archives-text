# Hayes Wins, Cesare Censured; Students Vote To Keep ASSU
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
Denis Hayes defeated Vicky
Drake for student body presi
dent by a margin of 3458 to 2136
yesterday.
In the heaviest turnout in re
cent years, students also voted
against both the proposed new
constitution and the existing
one.
By a 3247 to 2271 margin stu
dents voted to censure ASSU
president Cesare Massarenti for
"advocating and participating
in the forcible occupation of a
University building" during the
May 6 sit-in at the Old Union.
A proposition on whether to
approve the Associated Students
charter failed to get the majority
needed to pass. The votes in
favor of the charter outnum
bered the votes against it by
2463 to 1366 with 2107 ob
sentions.
| But Cesare Massarenti, Legi
slature speaker Michael Weln
stein, and election commission--
er Craig Brown made a rul
ing before yesterday's vote

count making it necessary for
a measure to pass on the to
tal balloting, not simply on the
yes's and no's.
The new constitution failed to
pass since it did not muster a
two-thirds majority based on the
total vote. The final tally was
2817 in favor and 1312 opposed
with 1820 absentions.
New ASSU by-laws failed to
obtain a majority. There were
2591 ballots for the by-laws, 1395
against, and 1991 abstentions.
But students rejected the pres
ent constitution by a vote of 808
in favor and 2930 against with
abstentions totaling 2223. Due
to the wording of the proposi
tion, the measure amounts to
only a student opinion and does
not mean that the constitution
is scrapped.
The voters decided against
abolishing the ASSU with 1457
in favor and 2920 opposed with
1520 abstaining.
Students voted in support of
the sixth initiative stating that
the use of force in seeking

change is contrary to the spirit
of an academic community. In
particular, the forcible occupa
tion of University buildings."
The vote was 3924 in favor and
1695 against the measure.
Students voted to "favor the
provision of a student-oper
ated coffeehouse in "an at
tractive location. The Fire
house, to be vacated in August
1968, would suit this purpose
well." The balloting was 4928
to 452.

Last night Massarenti said,
"Today, we have seen the polit
ical immaturity of Stanford stu
dents voting for a constitution
they haven't read to replace one
they have never read.
"It would be one thing to
censure me personally for tak
ing part in the sit-in, but I
feel that I have performed my
duties as president more than
adequately. I am sorry that
many students are not able
to distinguish between indiv
uals and roles.

"I suppose that In part the
vote reflects the prejudice of
some students towards foreign
ers, the kind of prejudice they
were not able to express in the
BSU controversy.
"After two years of radical
leadership, the inevitable reac
tion has set in, the reaction of
those who still see Stanford as
a playground rather than as a
place for serious intellectual
work. Let's see what Stanford
will look like in two or three
years."
