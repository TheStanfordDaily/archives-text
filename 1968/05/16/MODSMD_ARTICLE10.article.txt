## Peace Proposals Traded 
### 
PARIS (AP) — The United
States, citing possible areas of
agreement, urged North Viet
nam Wednesday to accept a
three-point proposal "Vital to
peace" in Vietnam. Hanoi re
sponded by insisting the Ameri
cans immediately halt all bomb
ing and acts of war before other
matters "of common interest"
could be discussed.
Ambassador W. Averell Har
riman, the chief U.S. negotiator,

and Xuan Thuy, chief envoy for
North Vietnam, held a 210-min
ute discussion at the French
Foreign Ministry's conference
hall and adjourned their prelim
inary Vietnam peace talks until
Saturday.
In Washington Secretary of
State Dpan Rusk said any sug
gestion that the United States is
ready to impose a Communist
role on South Vietnam is "mis
chievous and false."
Each side had its three-point
proposal. Despite the differing
proposals, the American side
said it declined to be wholly pes
simistic.
The U.S. proposal involved
restoration of the demilitarized
status of the six-mile-wide buf
fer zone between North and
South Vietnam and international
action to insure the neutrality
and territorial integrity of Laos
and Cambodia, Vietnam's Indo-
Chinese neighbors.
North Vietnam's proposal
spelled out three points, de
manding the immediate cessa
tion of all acts of war against
the North by the United States,
including propaganda and psy
chological warfare, "without
putting any condition" for this
before Hanoi.

• Mid-East Peace?

CAIRO (AP) — A govern
ment spokesman said today Gun
nar V. Jarring, the U.N. Middle
East peace envoy, has notified
Secretary-General U Thant that
Israel has accepted the Security
Council resolution for a peace
ful settlement. Egypt previously
accept ed it.
"Now we want to see Jar
ring's proposals translated into
action and a timetable for im
plementing the Security Council
resolution," the spokesman, Mo

hammed Hassan el Zayyat, told
a press conference.
He said Egypt's only source
of information that Israel ac
cepted the resolution was Jar
ring's letter to Thant.
Israel has taken the line at de
bate in the United Nations that
it accepts the resolution, which
calls for withdrawal of Israeli
forces from Arab territory con
quered in last June's war. It al
so calls for negotiations for a
peaceful settlement.
The resolution does not say
whether withdrawal or negotia
tions should take precedence,
but Egypt and Jordan have
been demanding that Israel
first withdraw from conquered
Egyptian and Jordanian terri
tory.

• AFL-CIO Splits

DETROIT (AP) — The long
threatened final break between
the AFL-CIO and Walter Reu
ther's United Auto Workers
(UAW) was due at midnight.
Wednesday, deadline set by the
federation for a dues payment
the auto workers vowed they
would not make.
As the deadline approached,
Emil Mazey, secretary-treasurer
of the UAW, affirmed his un
ion's intention not to pay.
The AFL-CIO pictures the sit
uation as "a withdrawal" by the
UAW, but a UAW spokesman
said "we're being kicked out."
Either way, it is labor's big
gest schism since the AFL-CIO
expHled the Teamsters Union
11 years ago on charges of cor
ruption. The Teamsters claim
1.8 million members; the UAW
1.6 million.
The AFL-CIO is made up of
130 unions claiming 14 million
members. The UAW is the lar
gest affiliate.
The current split stems from
a squabble between two men
who brought together once rival
organizations into the AFL-CIO:
George Meany, chief of the old
American Federation of Labor,
and Walter P. Reuther, leader
of the old Congress of Indus
trial Organizations. Dues are a
secondary issue.
• Poor People 9 s Drive
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sym
pathetic congressmen shaped a
task force Wednesday to push
Poor People's programs after
an unprecendented meeting with
march leaders on Capitol Hill.
About 70 senators and House
members met in a lVfe-hour ses
sion with the Rev. Ralph
David Abernathy, who said the
mass demonstrations he plans
will turn to civil disobedience
only as "a very last resort."
Busloads of protestors rolled
toward the capitol from Cleve
land, Charlotte and Philadelphia
to join 500 poverty-hit Negroes
already camping in tent-shaped
wooden shanties near the Lin
coln Memorial.
Abernathy mentioned no price
tag in sketching for congress
men the broad goals of more
jobs, better housing and an end
to poverty in America. Sen. Ja
cob K. Javits, R-N.Y., said pri
vate speculation on the cost
ranged as high as $30 billion.
Sen. Edward W. Brooke, R-
Mass., the Senate's lone Negro,
drew up the framework of a
special House-Senate committee
to meet with the protest leaders
and mold specific programs.
Top leaders of both parties in
the House and Senate were noti
ceably absent from the session
and one congressman conceded
many colleagues have taken a
chary attitude toward the
march.
• Anti-Labor Strike
LONDON (AP) — Prime Min
ister Harold Wilson shrugged
off a nationwide strike by three
million engineering workers
Wednesday and won support
from his Labor party legislators
for the government's tough
wage restraint policies.
Wilson was reported to have
delivered a fighting speech be
hind closed doors to swing the
Laborite members of Parlia
ment 205-42 in favor of the mea
sures, which run counter to ba

sic principles of the left-wing
party.
But, while Wilson drew sup
port in London, engineering
workers in motor plants, ship
yards and aviation plants
around Britain walked off the
job for 24 hours to protest the
government's tough line on pay
hikes.
• Draft Call Down
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Pentagon's draft calls, which
began shooting up in January
and peaked at 48,000 in April,
continued to slide down Wednes
day with a request for 15,000
Army recruits in July.
At the same time, the Defense
Department said the Army finds
it needs 9,500 fewer men in June
than expected, so the draft call
for that month is being reduced
from 29,500 to 20,000. It was ex
plained that the Army overesti
mated the number of men who
will be discharged during the
month.
• Stocks Deadlocked
NEW YORK (AP) — A few
sharp moves by specific issues
highlighted a virtually dead
locked stock market Wednesday.
Trading was active.
Gains and losses were equal
at 638 each on the New York
Stock Exchange. New highs for
the year totaled 114 and new
lows 20. A total of 1,512 issues
changed hands.
The Dow Jones industrial av
erage closed with a loss of .24
at 907.82, a negligible change,
after showing a gain of .57 a
half-hour before the bell.
Once again, the market was
groping and "consolidating", as
analysts put it.
The peace talks and tax bill
were the major factors which
seemed to be keeping investors
in a watch-and-wait mood.
The Associated Press average
of 60 stocks closed unchanged
at 329.9, with industrials off 1.0,
rails up .6 to a new high for the
year, and utilities up .2.
U.S. Treasury bonds went
through a mild decline. Corpo
rate bonds were mostly un
changed.
The New York Stock Ex
change index lost 2 cents at
$54.96.
Ten of the 15 most-active
stocks advanced, and 5 declined.
Prices were mixed also on the
American Stock Exchange. Vol

• AFL-CIO Splits

DETROIT (AP) — The long

As the deadline approached,

The AFL-CIO pictures the sit

Either way, it is labor's big

• Poor People 9 s Drive
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sym

About 70 senators and House

Busloads of protestors rolled

WASHINGTON (AP) — The

At the same time, the Defense

• Anti-Labor Strike
LONDON (AP) — Prime Min

off a nationwide strike by three
million engineering workers
Wednesday and won support
from his Labor party legislators
for the government's tough
wage restraint policies.
Wilson was reported to have
delivered a fighting speech be
hind closed doors to swing the
Laborite members of Parlia

But, while Wilson drew sup

• Draft Call Down
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Pentagon's draft calls, which
began shooting up in January
and peaked at 48,000 in April,
continued to slide down Wednes
day with a request for 15,000
Army recruits in July.
At the same time, the Defense
Department said the Army finds
it needs 9,500 fewer men in June
than expected, so the draft call
for that month is being reduced
from 29,500 to 20,000. It was ex
plained that the Army overesti

• Stocks Deadlocked
NEW YORK (AP) — A few
sharp moves by specific issues
highlighted a virtually dead
locked stock market Wednesday.
Trading was active.
Gains and losses were equal
at 638 each on the New York
Stock Exchange. New highs for
the year totaled 114 and new
lows 20. A total of 1,512 issues
changed hands.
The Dow Jones industrial av

at 907.82, a negligible change,
after showing a gain of .57 a
half-hour before the bell.
Once again, the market was
groping and "consolidating", as
analysts put it.
The peace talks and tax bill
were the major factors which
seemed to be keeping investors
in a watch-and-wait mood.
The Associated Press average
of 60 stocks closed unchanged
at 329.9, with industrials off 1.0,

year, and utilities up .2.
U.S. Treasury bonds went
through a mild decline. Corpo

The New York Stock Ex

Ten of the 15 most-active

Prices were mixed also on the
American Stock Exchange. Vol

PARIS (AP) — The United
States, citing possible areas of
agreement, urged North Viet
nam Wednesday to accept a
three-point proposal "Vital to
peace" in Vietnam. Hanoi re
sponded by insisting the Ameri
cans immediately halt all bomb
ing and acts of war before other
matters "of common interest"
could be discussed.
Ambassador W. Averell Har
riman, the chief U.S. negotiator,

and Xuan Thuy, chief envoy for
North Vietnam, held a 210-min
ute discussion at the French
Foreign Ministry's conference
hall and adjourned their prelim
inary Vietnam peace talks until
Saturday.
In Washington Secretary of
State Dpan Rusk said any sug
gestion that the United States is
ready to impose a Communist
role on South Vietnam is "mis
chievous and false."
Each side had its three-point
proposal. Despite the differing
proposals, the American side
said it declined to be wholly pes
simistic.
The U.S. proposal involved
restoration of the demilitarized
status of the six-mile-wide buf
fer zone between North and
South Vietnam and international
action to insure the neutrality
and territorial integrity of Laos
and Cambodia, Vietnam's Indo-
Chinese neighbors.
North Vietnam's proposal
spelled out three points, de
manding the immediate cessa
tion of all acts of war against
the North by the United States,
including propaganda and psy
chological warfare, "without
putting any condition" for this
before Hanoi.

• Mid-East Peace?

CAIRO (AP) — A govern
ment spokesman said today Gun
nar V. Jarring, the U.N. Middle
East peace envoy, has notified
Secretary-General U Thant that
Israel has accepted the Security
Council resolution for a peace
ful settlement. Egypt previously
accept ed it.
"Now we want to see Jar
ring's proposals translated into
action and a timetable for im
plementing the Security Council
resolution," the spokesman, Mo

hammed Hassan el Zayyat, told
a press conference.
He said Egypt's only source
of information that Israel ac
cepted the resolution was Jar
ring's letter to Thant.
Israel has taken the line at de
bate in the United Nations that
it accepts the resolution, which
calls for withdrawal of Israeli
forces from Arab territory con
quered in last June's war. It al
so calls for negotiations for a
peaceful settlement.
The resolution does not say
whether withdrawal or negotia
tions should take precedence,
but Egypt and Jordan have
been demanding that Israel
first withdraw from conquered
Egyptian and Jordanian terri
tory.

• AFL-CIO Splits

DETROIT (AP) — The long
threatened final break between
the AFL-CIO and Walter Reu
ther's United Auto Workers
(UAW) was due at midnight.
Wednesday, deadline set by the
federation for a dues payment
the auto workers vowed they
would not make.
As the deadline approached,
Emil Mazey, secretary-treasurer
of the UAW, affirmed his un
ion's intention not to pay.
The AFL-CIO pictures the sit
uation as "a withdrawal" by the
UAW, but a UAW spokesman
said "we're being kicked out."
Either way, it is labor's big
gest schism since the AFL-CIO
expHled the Teamsters Union
11 years ago on charges of cor
ruption. The Teamsters claim
1.8 million members; the UAW
1.6 million.
The AFL-CIO is made up of
130 unions claiming 14 million
members. The UAW is the lar
gest affiliate.
The current split stems from
a squabble between two men
who brought together once rival
organizations into the AFL-CIO:
George Meany, chief of the old
American Federation of Labor,
and Walter P. Reuther, leader
of the old Congress of Indus
trial Organizations. Dues are a
secondary issue.
• Poor People 9 s Drive
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sym
pathetic congressmen shaped a
task force Wednesday to push
Poor People's programs after
an unprecendented meeting with

About 70 senators and House
members met in a lVfe-hour ses
sion with the Rev. Ralph
David Abernathy, who said the
mass demonstrations he plans
will turn to civil disobedience
only as "a very last resort."
Busloads of protestors rolled
toward the capitol from Cleve
land, Charlotte and Philadelphia
to join 500 poverty-hit Negroes
already camping in tent-shaped
wooden shanties near the Lin
coln Memorial.
Abernathy mentioned no price
tag in sketching for congress
men the broad goals of more
jobs, better housing and an end
to poverty in America. Sen. Ja
