## Peace Proposals Traded 
### 
PARIS (AP) — The United
States, citing possible areas of
agreement, urged North Viet
nam Wednesday to accept a
three-point proposal "Vital to
peace" in Vietnam. Hanoi re
sponded by insisting the Ameri
cans immediately halt all bomb
ing and acts of war before other
matters "of common interest"
could be discussed.
Ambassador W. Averell Har
riman, the chief U.S. negotiator,

and Xuan Thuy, chief envoy for
North Vietnam, held a 210-min
ute discussion at the French
Foreign Ministry's conference
hall and adjourned their prelim
inary Vietnam peace talks until
Saturday.
In Washington Secretary of
State Dpan Rusk said any sug
gestion that the United States is
ready to impose a Communist
role on South Vietnam is "mis
chievous and false."
Each side had its three-point
proposal. Despite the differing
proposals, the American side
said it declined to be wholly pes
simistic.
The U.S. proposal involved
restoration of the demilitarized
status of the six-mile-wide buf
fer zone between North and
South Vietnam and international
action to insure the neutrality
and territorial integrity of Laos
and Cambodia, Vietnam's Indo-
Chinese neighbors.
North Vietnam's proposal
spelled out three points, de
manding the immediate cessa
tion of all acts of war against
the North by the United States,
including propaganda and psy
chological warfare, "without
putting any condition" for this
before Hanoi.

• Mid-East Peace?

CAIRO (AP) — A govern
ment spokesman said today Gun
nar V. Jarring, the U.N. Middle
East peace envoy, has notified
Secretary-General U Thant that
Israel has accepted the Security
Council resolution for a peace
ful settlement. Egypt previously
accept ed it.
"Now we want to see Jar
ring's proposals translated into
action and a timetable for im
plementing the Security Council
resolution," the spokesman, Mo

hammed Hassan el Zayyat, told
a press conference.
He said Egypt's only source
of information that Israel ac
cepted the resolution was Jar
ring's letter to Thant.
Israel has taken the line at de
bate in the United Nations that
it accepts the resolution, which
calls for withdrawal of Israeli
forces from Arab territory con
quered in last June's war. It al
so calls for negotiations for a
peaceful settlement.
The resolution does not say
whether withdrawal or negotia
tions should take precedence,
but Egypt and Jordan have
been demanding that Israel
first withdraw from conquered
Egyptian and Jordanian terri
tory.

• AFL-CIO Splits

DETROIT (AP) — The long
threatened final break between
the AFL-CIO and Walter Reu
ther's United Auto Workers
(UAW) was due at midnight.
Wednesday, deadline set by the
federation for a dues payment
the auto workers vowed they
would not make.
As the deadline approached,
Emil Mazey, secretary-treasurer
of the UAW, affirmed his un
ion's intention not to pay.
The AFL-CIO pictures the sit
uation as "a withdrawal" by the
UAW, but a UAW spokesman
said "we're being kicked out."
Either way, it is labor's big
gest schism since the AFL-CIO
expHled the Teamsters Union
11 years ago on charges of cor
ruption. The Teamsters claim
1.8 million members; the UAW
1.6 million.
The AFL-CIO is made up of
130 unions claiming 14 million
members. The UAW is the lar
