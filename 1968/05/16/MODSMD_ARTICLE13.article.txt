## Wisdom Of Faculty Vote Still Doubted 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
At the academic council meet
ing of Wednesday, May 7, a slim
majority of the faculty voted in
favor of a motion which many
of us felt expressed a lack of
confidence in the administra
tion. The behavior of some of
the council members was any
thing but exemplary.
We were treated to the spec
tacle of one member storming
uninvited to the podium, shoul
dering President Sterling aside,
grabbing the microphone, and
angrily condemning the Presi
dent's acquiescence to a request
for a roll call. The request was
legitimate, being based on the
closeness of the vote and the ac
knowledged fact that th r o u g h
misunderstanding some illegal
votes had been cast.
The victors, having undercut
the administration's position,
then proposed a vote of confi
dence in the President and his
administration, a move which
some of us felt was hypocritical
and which would better have
'teen left in limbo.
I do not believe that Monday's
letter to the editor by eleven
faculty members did much to
undo the impression created at
the meeting. I wonder, hnd the
vote gone against them, whether
this group would still have pro
posed a vote of confidence in the
administration.
As for the results of the meet
ing: they were achieved by a
close but democratic vote of
those present and it behooves
us all to accept the decision

gracefully. This does not mean,
however, that we accept the
wisdom of the vote. I am con
vinced, as a result of two years
experience in Latin America,
that by surrendering to illegal
student pressure we have op
ened the door to eventual chaos
and inevitable erosion of the
educational process.

4 Cleaning Up 9 Could Be
Theatening Prospect
I agree with Mr. Gutman's
letter in Wednesday's Daily. Ly
man's statement on the House
of Representatives' bill is indeed
ambiguous. Especially disturb
ing is Lyman's urging that the
university "keep its house in or
der" to avoid outside agencies
doing it for us.
Does this mean the establish
ment of free and open communi
cation between administration,
faculty, and students which
would hopefully eliminate the
necessity for sit-ins and demon
strations? If this is what the
statement means, I'm all for it.
Or does it mean the rejection
of the concepts of "student
power" and "faculty power"?
Does it mean coercion of the in
dividuals involved as suggested
by the bill?
Talk about "keeping one's
house in order" is an unpleasant
reminder of the response to Sen
ator Joe McCarthy, when univer
sities and government agencies
reacted by "cleaning up" their

respective faculties and staffs.

How Close The War
To Trustee's Work?
Editor, The Daily:
I have just learned that two
Stanford trustees are directors
of companies that are making
some of the newest and most
advanced antipersonnel weapons
for the Army. They are William
R. Hewlett, a director of FMC
Corporation, and Thomas V.
Jones, chairman and president
of Northrop Corporation.
Both companies were recently
awarded Army contracts for
two projectiles: the XM626, 152-
mm. canister projectile, and
XMS94EI metal parts for the
XMSBOEI, 90-mm projectile. Nei
ther projectile is given in the
usual Army ammunition lists,
but as the Army had previously
announced its intention to pro
cure XM626 projectiles "under
the Beehive program," I assume
this is one of the "Beehive"
projectiles. I suspect the
XMSBOEI is also Beehive.
"Beehive" ammunition was
characterized at a Congressional
hearing in 1967 as "a version of
the canister, a more sophisti
cated version." A canister pro
jectile is a sort of huge shotgun
shell that spews forth tiny pro
jectiles. The Beehive canister,
according to the National Guar
dian, contains thousands of
needle-like slivers; other anti

personnel canisters contain
flechettes or steel slugs. One of
the 90-mm. canister projectiles
has an effective range of 400
yardsâ€”four times the length of
a football field.
Another of Northrop's prod
ucts in the antipersonnel line is
the WDU-4/A flechette warhead
for the 2.75-in. rocket. Flechettes
are tiny steel dirts that inflict
gaping wounds. The rocket it
self has been one of the main
weapons in Vietnam; it is fired
from low-flying aircraft and
helicopters against ground
targets.
I wonder how these men rec
oncile their companies' work
with their own "philanthropic"
activities such as being a uni
versity trustee.

Do-It-Your self Exam
On University Ideals
Editor, The Dally:
At the Old Union sit-in, stu
d?nt body president Cesare Mas
sarenti told a reporter, "We are
not here to destroy Stanford.
We are here to make it a better
place to work and study." Pres
ident Sterling has often ex
pressed similar views.
To test whether or not the
students and faculty share these
views, I have devised the follow
ing questionnaire. It is in the
form of a self-graded pass-fail
examination. You will know
whether you pass or fail.

1. In the following list, check
th" activities from which you
believe the university adminis
tration should protect you by
banning them from the campus:
(a) A speech by H. Rap Brown
(b) A speech by Eug n
MacCarthy.
(c) A speech by Rusk.
(d) A lecture entitled "Black
People Are Genetically In
ferior."
(e) A lecture entitled "White
People Are Genetically In
ferior."
(112) A lecture entitled "Cal Stu
dents Are Genetically In
ferior."
(g) A recruiting rally for Stu
dents for a Democratic So
ciety.
(h) A recruiting rally for t'""*
Flat Earth Society.
(i) A recruiter for the CIA.
2. From the list in question 1,
indicate the activities that you
believe should be driven from
the campus by student harrass
ment, intimidation, and disrup
tion.
3. Is there a difference be
tween your answers to questions
1 and 2? Explain.
4. Combine your answers to
question 2 with your best guess
at the Trustees' answers to
question 1. Are there any items
not included in the combined
list? Explain.
5. Do you believe that Stan
ford will be "a better place to
work and study" if wrong ideas
and beliefs are suppressed by
the methods suggested in either
question 1 or question 2? Ex
plain.
6. (Extra credit) Describe the
criteria for identifying ideas and
beliefs that are wrong and
should be suppressed.
That's the end of the test.
How did you do?
