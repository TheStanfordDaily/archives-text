# A
						Conspiracy Of One
## Power In The Wrong Hands 
### Dan Snell 
The crisis last week high
lighted the impotence of the fac
ulty and the students, except, of
course, for the much-touted resi
dual power. That is if they
want something bad enough,
students can sit in and faculty
members can resign.
But as pundits last week
pointed out, if you use your
residual power too often, people
start ignoring you.
It is supremely frustrating to
think that if the administration
had not been inclined to accept
the recommendation of the Aca
demic Council, there is not much
anyone could have done about
it. The Chronicle for a few days
might have run headlines about
professors resigning in protest,
and of course students might
have "escalated" their tactics,
with Columbian consequences.
But in the long run the sage
trustees would have still pos
sessed the legal right to put a
stop to the shinanigans, to re
flect the opinions of the business
community on the running of
the University, and to return the
institution to what Jane Stan
ford meant it to be, whatever
that is.
Ignorance
The Trustees are not sinister
ogres, I am sure, but they do
know amazingly little about

what really goes into a Univers
ity. As trustee David Packard,
multimillionaire man sometimes
about campus, put it last week
in an unguarded moment ad
dressing demonstrators in the
Old Union, "We don't know very
much about this sort of thing."
Packard was talking about
the ASSU Judicial Council, but
he could have said the same
thing with equal truth about
any number of University func
tions and problems.
The Trustees do somehow
give the University money and
wrangle contributions out of
their acquaintances. In that
way, they are a very helpful
auxiliary. And they should con
tinue to serve—as an auxiliary
but not as the primary decision
making body of the University.
The Distant Rich
The power—both residual and
legal—should in fact rest with
the faculty and students, with
those who go about the real
business of teaching and learn
ing, and not with the distant
and rich scions of industrial
America.
as one faculty member puts
it,"The trustees are the boss,
I'm just the hired help, and the
student is the consumer."
This economic model is not
adequate to the proper running

of the University. Last week if
the administration had had to
answer to the faculty instead of
the Board, it might have been
more flexible to student de
mands. Indeed, if the students
felt they had some voice in what
really makes decisions around
the University—in some sort of
legally powerful student-faculty
body—the need for sit-ins might
never aagin be so pressing as it
seemed last week.
Faculty Lobbying
But the way to get the trust
ees to stop running the Uni
versity probably has little to do
with sit-ins or more violent
methods. What is needed is the
memory and continuing possi
bility of militant action linked
to the fervent lobbying of the
faculty.
Provost Lyman hinted that
de facto power might eventually
be transferred from Trustees to
the faculty, but this hardly
seems sufficient in light of the
speed with which key decisions
will have to be made and fully
authorized in the near future.
Sad to say, we need the
change now; we needed it last
week; and we needed it when
Martin King died. This quarter
has been an amazing one in that
the crises the University has en
countered during it have been

so many. But there is no reason
to think that the temper of the
community and the nation will
stop breeding more crises with
which the present system of Uni
versity "governance" (as the
lawyers say) cannot adequately
cope.
What we need is a faculty-stu
dent governing body with real
legal power—power to right
wrongs, pick presidents, as well
as to run the physical plant of
the University efficiently.
