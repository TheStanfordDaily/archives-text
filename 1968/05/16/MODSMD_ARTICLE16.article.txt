# From A Reporter's Notebook
## Foreign Students Feel Categorized 
### JORGE LOZOYA 
A line from a Daily editorial
(April 30) refering to the Latin
American universities en masse
produced strong reactions
among foreign students on
campus. Francisco A. Mezzadri
sent a letter to the Editor (May
2) in which he points out a basic
question: Does an entity called
the Latin American university
exist? In the same line of
thought you can ask what is a
"foreign student" apart from a
member of the Stanford com
munity who does not hold an
American passport?
What is happening today in
American universities is prob
ably one of the most important
phenomena in the life of this
country in the last decade. Per
sonally, I have been in contact
with American universities and
American students since 1959,
when I first spent some time at
the American University in
Washington, D.C.
Things have changed a lot
since then. In those days, the
American student in general
thought of the rest of the world,
probably with the exception of
Western Europe and the Soviet
Union, as non-existent. A stu
dent from Peru or Morocco was
a visitor from another planet
for most people on campus.
Too Many Categories
Nowadays, Stanford is more
and more concerned with a bet
ter knowledge of the realities
of other nations. However, we
are caught in categories.
First we have "the foreign
student." Ten per cent of the
students in Stanford belong in
this category. But, what makes
a foreign student? It is difficult
to classify a Japanese and a
Canadian in the same box, how
ever it is done all the time in
Stanford.

Ten per cent of the student
body is treated in "equal terms"
as if the knowledge the Ameri
can student has of the cultures
of other nations would be par
allel. For instance: an American
student, when confronting a
German student, knows from
his Western Civ that Germany
exists, but he is not very sure
about Uruguay being "one of
those new nations in Africa" or
an extinguished Indian culture
in South America.
At the same time, Mexico has
been the neighbor of the United
States for two hundred years
and therefore a Mexican student
has been in touch with Ameri
cans all his life, while a student
from Kenya is probably the first
member of his family ever get
ting in direct contact with Amer
ican culture.
Cultural Areas
Then, the second category:
the "cultural area." We talk of
students from "Western Eu
rope" as if a Spaniard and a
Briton could agree on anything!
The case of the students coming
from the Western hemisphere is
pathetic. If a student is a citizen
of a country south of Texas, he
fits into the category of "Latin
American student."
Few people realize that the
distance separating Mexico City
and Buenos Aires is longer than
the distance between Mexico
City and Paris. Communications
do not yet solve the geographical
gap. It is possible to fly directly
from the Mexican capital to
Paris any day of the week, while
to get from Mexico City to
Buenos Aires it is faster to fly
first to New York.
Some People think in terms
of Spanish being a common
language to the Latin Ameri
cans. This disregards over 85

million Brazilians, plus the Ja
maicans, Haitians, etc. And even
among the so-called Spanish
speaking countries, the Para
guayans often prefer to speak
guaranl, their other national
language.
The differences between the
the language of the Mexicans
and the Argentinians are as
sharp as the differences between
the English of California and
the one used in Ireland. The
cultural, social and economical
differences in the continent are
so great that you wonder what
does a Guatemalan, a Chilean
and a Haitian have in common,
besides a seat at the O.A.S.
Alone At Stanford
As far as Stanford is con
cerned, the students from all
over the world might be of great
utility for the community. But
future leaders of Africa sip cof
fee at Tresidder or become
lonely watchers of TV at the I-
Center, that place called an
island by some and a ghetto by
others. Their contact with Amer
ican students is minimal. For
eigners will often go back home
thinking that out of the Kaf
kaesque Escondido Villiage they
have no role in Stanford. Even
before they leave the country
the image of the American be
comes a cliche in their minds.
While this happens, the Amer
ican student specializing in "cul
tural areas" rarely gets in touch
with the nationals on campus.
Students taking Chinese com
plain that the course does not
provide enough practice of the
language, but they never talk
to the Chinese students who
always hope to have visitors in
their house, next to the PO.
In this moment of planning
and breaking of barriers, the
one between foreign and nation
al students in Stanford is still

very high. Probably a good way
to begin to destroy it will be by
changing attitudes, removing
categories.
The students from abroad
should not expect to find a smil
ing face everywhere just be
cause they are from strange
lands (too often pejoratively
called underdeveloped countries

or Third World). The American
student should not expect the
foreigners to be representatives
of their national folklore or
cuisine teachers. It might be a
good idea to start thinking that
if we should all have something
in common, it ought to be the
fact of being young people work
ing for a better world.

eigners will often go back home
thinking that out of the Kaf
kaesque Escondido Villiage they
have no role in Stanford. Even
before they leave the country
the image of the American be
comes a cliche in their minds.
While this happens, the Amer
ican student specializing in "cul
tural areas" rarely gets in touch
with the nationals on campus.
Students taking Chinese com
plain that the course does not
provide enough practice of the
language, but they never talk
to the Chinese students who
always hope to have visitors in
their house, next to the PO.
In this moment of planning
and breaking of barriers, the
one between foreign and nation
al students in Stanford is still

very high. Probably a good way
to begin to destroy it will be by
changing attitudes, removing
categories.
The students from abroad
should not expect to find a smil
ing face everywhere just be
cause they are from strange
lands (too often pejoratively
called underdeveloped countries

or Third World). The American
student should not expect the
foreigners to be representatives
of their national folklore or
cuisine teachers. It might be a
good idea to start thinking that
if we should all have something
in common, it ought to be the
fact of being young people work
ing for a better world.
A line from a Daily editorial
(April 30) refering to the Latin
American universities en masse
produced strong reactions
among foreign students on
campus. Francisco A. Mezzadri
sent a letter to the Editor (May
2) in which he points out a basic
question: Does an entity called
the Latin American university
exist? In the same line of
thought you can ask what is a
"foreign student" apart from a
member of the Stanford com
munity who does not hold an
American passport?
What is happening today in
American universities is prob
ably one of the most important
phenomena in the life of this
country in the last decade. Per
sonally, I have been in contact
with American universities and
American students since 1959,
when I first spent some time at
the American University in
Washington, D.C.
Things have changed a lot
since then. In those days, the
American student in general
thought of the rest of the world,
probably with the exception of
Western Europe and the Soviet
Union, as non-existent. A stu
dent from Peru or Morocco was
a visitor from another planet
for most people on campus.
Too Many Categories
Nowadays, Stanford is more
and more concerned with a bet
ter knowledge of the realities
of other nations. However, we
are caught in categories.
First we have "the foreign
student." Ten per cent of the
students in Stanford belong in
this category. But, what makes
a foreign student? It is difficult
to classify a Japanese and a
Canadian in the same box, how
ever it is done all the time in
Stanford.

Ten per cent of the student
body is treated in "equal terms"
as if the knowledge the Ameri
can student has of the cultures
of other nations would be par
allel. For instance: an American
student, when confronting a
German student, knows from
his Western Civ that Germany
exists, but he is not very sure
about Uruguay being "one of
those new nations in Africa" or
an extinguished Indian culture
in South America.
At the same time, Mexico has
been the neighbor of the United
States for two hundred years
and therefore a Mexican student
has been in touch with Ameri
cans all his life, while a student
from Kenya is probably the first
member of his family ever get
ting in direct contact with Amer
ican culture.
Cultural Areas
Then, the second category:
the "cultural area." We talk of
students from "Western Eu
rope" as if a Spaniard and a
Briton could agree on anything!
The case of the students coming
from the Western hemisphere is
pathetic. If a student is a citizen
of a country south of Texas, he
fits into the category of "Latin
American student."
Few people realize that the
distance separating Mexico City
and Buenos Aires is longer than
the distance between Mexico
City and Paris. Communications
do not yet solve the geographical
gap. It is possible to fly directly
from the Mexican capital to
Paris any day of the week, while
to get from Mexico City to
Buenos Aires it is faster to fly
first to New York.
Some People think in terms
of Spanish being a common
language to the Latin Ameri
cans. This disregards over 85

million Brazilians, plus the Ja
maicans, Haitians, etc. And even
among the so-called Spanish
speaking countries, the Para
guayans often prefer to speak
guaranl, their other national
language.
The differences between the
the language of the Mexicans
and the Argentinians are as
sharp as the differences between
the English of California and
the one used in Ireland. The
cultural, social and economical
differences in the continent are
so great that you wonder what
does a Guatemalan, a Chilean
and a Haitian have in common,
besides a seat at the O.A.S.
Alone At Stanford
As far as Stanford is con
cerned, the students from all
over the world might be of great
utility for the community. But
future leaders of Africa sip cof
fee at Tresidder or become
lonely watchers of TV at the I-
Center, that place called an
island by some and a ghetto by
others. Their contact with Amer
ican students is minimal. For
eigners will often go back home
thinking that out of the Kaf
kaesque Escondido Villiage they

Paris any day of the week, while
to get from Mexico City to
Buenos Aires it is faster to fly
first to New York.
Some People think in terms
of Spanish being a common
language to the Latin Ameri
cans. This disregards over 85

million Brazilians, plus the Ja
maicans, Haitians, etc. And even
among the so-called Spanish
speaking countries, the Para
guayans often prefer to speak
guaranl, their other national
language.
The differences between the
the language of the Mexicans
and the Argentinians are as
sharp as the differences between
the English of California and
the one used in Ireland. The
cultural, social and economical
differences in the continent are
so great that you wonder what
does a Guatemalan, a Chilean
and a Haitian have in common,
besides a seat at the O.A.S.
Alone At Stanford
As far as Stanford is con
cerned, the students from all
over the world might be of great
utility for the community. But
future leaders of Africa sip cof
fee at Tresidder or become
lonely watchers of TV at the I-
Center, that place called an
island by some and a ghetto by
others. Their contact with Amer
ican students is minimal. For
eigners will often go back home
thinking that out of the Kaf
kaesque Escondido Villiage they
have no role in Stanford. Even
before they leave the country
the image of the American be
comes a cliche in their minds.
While this happens, the Amer
ican student specializing in "cul
tural areas" rarely gets in touch
with the nationals on campus.
Students taking Chinese com
plain that the course does not
provide enough practice of the
language, but they never talk
to the Chinese students who
always hope to have visitors in
their house, next to the PO.
In this moment of planning
and breaking of barriers, the
one between foreign and nation
al students in Stanford is still

very high. Probably a good way
to begin to destroy it will be by
changing attitudes, removing
categories.
The students from abroad
should not expect to find a smil
ing face everywhere just be
cause they are from strange
lands (too often pejoratively
called underdeveloped countries

or Third World). The American
student should not expect the
foreigners to be representatives
of their national folklore or
cuisine teachers. It might be a
good idea to start thinking that
if we should all have something
in common, it ought to be the
fact of being young people work
ing for a better world.
A line from a Daily editorial
(April 30) refering to the Latin
American universities en masse
produced strong reactions
among foreign students on
campus. Francisco A. Mezzadri
sent a letter to the Editor (May
2) in which he points out a basic
question: Does an entity called
the Latin American university
exist? In the same line of
thought you can ask what is a
"foreign student" apart from a
member of the Stanford com
munity who does not hold an
American passport?
What is happening today in
American universities is prob
ably one of the most important
phenomena in the life of this
country in the last decade. Per
sonally, I have been in contact
with American universities and
American students since 1959,
when I first spent some time at
the American University in
Washington, D.C.
Things have changed a lot
since then. In those days, the
American student in general
thought of the rest of the world,
probably with the exception of
Western Europe and the Soviet
Union, as non-existent. A stu
dent from Peru or Morocco was
a visitor from another planet
for most people on campus.
Too Many Categories
Nowadays, Stanford is more
and more concerned with a bet
ter knowledge of the realities
of other nations. However, we
are caught in categories.
First we have "the foreign
student." Ten per cent of the
students in Stanford belong in
this category. But, what makes
a foreign student? It is difficult
to classify a Japanese and a
Canadian in the same box, how
ever it is done all the time in
Stanford.

Ten per cent of the student
body is treated in "equal terms"
as if the knowledge the Ameri
can student has of the cultures
of other nations would be par
allel. For instance: an American
student, when confronting a
German student, knows from
his Western Civ that Germany
exists, but he is not very sure
about Uruguay being "one of
those new nations in Africa" or
an extinguished Indian culture
in South America.
At the same time, Mexico has
been the neighbor of the United
States for two hundred years
and therefore a Mexican student
has been in touch with Ameri
cans all his life, while a student
from Kenya is probably the first
member of his family ever get
ting in direct contact with Amer
ican culture.
Cultural Areas
Then, the second category:
the "cultural area." We talk of
students from "Western Eu
rope" as if a Spaniard and a
Briton could agree on anything!
The case of the students coming
from the Western hemisphere is
pathetic. If a student is a citizen
of a country south of Texas, he
fits into the category of "Latin
American student."
Few people realize that the
distance separating Mexico City
and Buenos Aires is longer than
the distance between Mexico
City and Paris. Communications
do not yet solve the geographical
gap. It is possible to fly directly
from the Mexican capital to
Paris any day of the week, while
to get from Mexico City to
Buenos Aires it is faster to fly
first to New York.
