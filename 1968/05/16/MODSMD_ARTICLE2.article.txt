# Role Of Business In Slums Debated
## 
### 
Contradictory opinions about
the role of business in the Amer
ican ghettos were expressed by
Professor David Abernathy and
Henry Organ at a Stanford
Graduate School of Business
conference Wednesday.
Abernathy, a political science
professor, and Organ, a black
psychologist for Lockheed and a
community action coordinator in
East Palo Alto, were the key
note speakers at the student
sponsored "Urban Crisis" con
ference.
Abernathy offered a three
option plan to the future busi
nessmen at the conference—
1. for white businessmen to
actively recruit ghetto talent
for white Industry; 2. to locate
Industry in the ghetto for
local employment; and 3. to
'decolonize' the ghetto by na
tionalizing homes, stores, and

Industry and turning It over
to black management.
Organ countered with warn
ings against promises of equal
opportunity that don't deliver.
He also pointed out that both
producers and consumers must
refuse to deal with companies
who do not have proportional
Negro help.
Professor Abernathy acknowl
edged the difficulties in imple
menting his proposals—the addi
tional costs, worker tensions,
and political pressures.
He also suggested that the
best solutions would include
"negotiation sessions" between
white and black businessmen,
"preferably in a tenement, so
you can see it like it is." He said
that these sessions "should in
clude members of the Black
Panther movement, who might
well emerge as Junior execu
tives. This might work because
nothing else has."
