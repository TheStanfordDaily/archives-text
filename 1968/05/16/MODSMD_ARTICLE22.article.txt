"Serjeant Musgrave's Dance,"
an anti-war, anti-Establishment
play by John Arden, now play
ing in The Nitery, tells of the
futility and horror of war.
First performed in England in
1959, the play marked a new
trend in the postwar, anti-Estab
lishment English theater. A
group of British Army deserters
led by Serjeant Musgrave ar
rives at an isolated coal mining
town in England. They have
come ostensibly to recruit, but

actually to teach the towns
people a bitter and violent les
son about war.
The final undergraduate pro
duction of the year, "Musgrave"
is directed by Stanford Reper
tory Theater's Glenn Cannon.
The exclusively undergraduate
cast is headed by Bob Fletcher
as Musgrave, William Clebsch
as Private Sparky, and Mar
guerite Olson as Annie.
Final performances of "Ser
jeant Musgrave's Dance" will be
at 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday
in The Nitery. Tickets are avail
able through the Tresidder Un
ion Box Office.
