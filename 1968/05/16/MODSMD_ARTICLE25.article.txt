# Tribe Falls To SC Rally, Embarks On 6-Game Tour
## 
### GARY CAVALLI 
Stanford embarks on a crucial
northern road trip today, faced
with the prospect of having to
win six straight games in the
span of five days.
The defending Pacific-8 cham
pions now trail frontrunning
USC by two-and-a-half games,
and another conference defeat
would just about hammer the
final nail into the Tribe coffin.
Tuesday the Indians drop
ped a non-league encounter to
the rugged Santa Clara Uni
versity nine, as the Broncos
rallied for five runs in the
eighth Inning to win 7-6.
Sandy Vance was the victim
of the Bronco explosion, absorb
ing his third loss of the season
against seven wins.
Santa Clara took a 2-1 lead
in the second on a home run by
first-baseman Hank Mott.
Four Bronco errors, a triple
by Jeff Rohlfing and a double
by Bob Boone enabled the In
dians to score four runs in the
fifth off Ron Boyle and grab a
5-2 lead.
In addition to his double,
Boone collected three singles
and raised his season's batting
average to an even .300.
John Mispagel led off the
Santa Clara eighth with a tower
ing shot over the right-center
field fence. Vance lost his com
posure and walked Bronco re
liefer Gary Fitzgerald, and Al
vin Strane followed with a
single. Then Albert Strane, Russ
Bigone, Fred Ott and Rod
Pommes drilled RBI singles to
provide the winning runs.

The win gave Santa Clara a
30-10 record for the year, and
the Broncos intend to ask for
an at-large berth in the NCAA
Region 8 playoffs. They clinched
the West Coast Athletic Con
ference championship last week.
The Indians (9-3), who fin
ished third in the NCAA
World Series in Omaha last
year, won't even make the
Begionals this time around
unless someone knocks off
USC (12-1) twice. The Tribe,
meanwhile, must win eight
consecutive Pac-8 contests.
Stanford coach Ray Young,
figuring that his club has the
strongest pitching staff in the
circuit, still feels the Indians
have a good chance for the title.

"We still feel we're defin
itely In the race," he said
Tuesday. "I think we're every
bit as good as last year when
we won the championship."
"Our pitching has carried us
(in 12 of Stanford's last 15
games the pitcher has gone the
distance), and our hitters are
coming along," Young went on
to say. "Defense is our biggest
question mark. Mike Ammirato,
our outstanding second base
man, has a broken hand and
we've had to change the infield
around."
The Tribe begins the northern
series with a single game at
Oregon State (5-8) Friday, and
a doubleheader at Oregon (6-7)
Saturday. The Indians journey
to Pullman for a twin bill with
Washington State (8-5) Monday,
and conclude the trip with a
single game at Washington
(0-13) Tuesday.
