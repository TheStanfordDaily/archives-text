UNDEB THE WEATHEB —Two members of Cal's varsity crew cling sheepishly to the sides of their
overturned shell Saturday morning at wind-swept Redwood City Harbor. The Bear boat swamped
about IVi minutes into the race, after both boats had taken on considerable water during two false
starts. Complaints by Cal coach Marty McNair that starter Phil Waters, a former Stanford oarsman,
was deliberately trying to hurt the Bear cause led to counter-charges by Tribe coach Wil Condon that
McNair was guilty of swearing at the starter and shouting instructions to his team from the coach
ing launch. After both sides denied the charges, the two coaches decided to determine the winner of
the "Big Bow" on the basis of who finishes first In the Western Sprints this weekend.
