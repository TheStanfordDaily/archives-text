# Fencers Finish 4th In NorCal, Jordan Reaches Semi-Finals
## 
### 
The collegiate fencing season
came to a close at the College
of San Mateo in the Novice meet
last Saturday, where new Stan
ford fencers competed for the
first time on the collegiate level.
The highlight of the meet was
the performance of Lee Jordan,
who made it to the semifinals in
the women's division before be
ing eliminated.
Stanford finished fourth in the
Northern California team cham
pionships at CSM missing sec
ond place by just two touches.
Again injury plagued the team
as Captain Bob Hunter was still
recovering from a severe attack
of bronchitis and was not up
to his usual form. However the
other team members, John Kel
ler and Hal Hayes, fenced their
usual good bouts.
In the men's Western Colle
giate held at Long Beach
State, the men entering In
only the foil division finished
seventh in the team cham
pionships, beating out all
Northern California teams, In
cluding top ranked University
of California at Berkeley.
Top performances were turned
in by team members Bob Hunt
er, Hay Hayes and Bruce Kahl.
This performance was sparked
by the victory of Bob Hunter
over Hik Hamburzumium, the
10th ranked fencer in the na
tion.
This year Stanford was rep
resented in the NCAA at De
troit by John Keller, who en
tered in the foil division. An
injury received by John dur
ing the competition prevented
a better finish of 10-29. The
foil was won by Gerald Es
ponda of University of San
Francisco, who is the sth

ranked fencer in the nation.
In the women's fencing this
year, Stanford first fenced at
Berkeley on two consecutive
days in the Western Collegiate
championships for individual
and team championships. On the
first day in the individual, the
Tribe fencers were eliminated
in the semi-finals.
The next day in the team
championships, rebounding from
the previous bad day, they
(Mary Cachu, Duelween Baker
and Linda Wing) began rolling
over their opponents, highlight
ed by Mary Cachu's victory over
Diane Amidon, the top West
coast fencer.
Then an attack of tendonl
tis forced Linda Wing to with
draw and forfeit her three
bouts in each of the two re

maining team matches. Stan
ford lost the last two team
bouts by a score of 5-4 to the
number one and two teams
and finished a disappointing
fourth.
May 4, at San Jose State Col
lege, the team composed of
Mary Cachu, Linda Wing, Duel
ween Baker and Susie Wong fin
ished 3rd in the Northern Cali
fornia Championships.
Meanwhile the Stanford Fen
cing Association (Thomas
Charles Brody, John
Chang, Paul Dillinger, Ik Hong,
Bob Hunter and Bruce Kahl)
qualified both individuals and
teams in both foil and epee to
the United States National.
From this meet, held in Miami,
Florida on June 22-29, an Olym
pic team will bo chosen.
