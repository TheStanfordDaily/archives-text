One of the big guns of the
Kennedy Presidential campaign
was leveled at Stanford yester
day.
Harris WofTord, former Asso
ciate Director of the Peace
Corps and organizing president
of the experimental Old West
bury campus of the State Uni
versity of New York, invaded
this bastion of McCarthy
strength with a disturbing analy
sis of the current political situ
ation.
If Wofford's assessment is
correct, Senator McCarthy's
followers face a difficult deci
sion. He contends that Robert
Kennedy's chances for the
Democratic nomination will be
killed If he loses In the forth

coming California primary.
But, he says, a McCarthy vic
tory will only guarantee that
some member of the Johnson
establishment will become
the Democratic candidate.
There is strong evidence to
support Wofford's case. Hubert
Humphrey is already guaran
teed nearly half of the first-bal
lot convention votes. Since New
Hampshire, McCarthy has not
demonstrated the kind of pri
mary strength that would ena
ble him to overcome Humph
rey's initial advantage.
Kennedy, on the other hand,
has the makings of a coalition
that might be able to match the
strength of the conservative
Southern-big business-big labor
alliance that would like to per
petuate most of Lyndon John
son's policies.
The young Senator's vote-get
ting power among the minori
ties, based on his civil rights
record and his support of men
like farm labor leader Ceasar
Chavez, is undeniable. His vic
tory in Nebraska, which has a
Negro population of less than
erne per cent, demonstrates that
he also has support among the
white middle class.
Balanced against this kind of
political reasoning is the emo
tional reaction that has built up
against Kennedy after his late
entry into the Presidential con
test. "Ruthless opportunist" was
one of the kinder terms that was
used to describe Wofford's fav
orite candidate yesterday.
Wofford has had a great deal
of contact with Robert Kennedy.
He was one of John Kennedy's
principle advisers in the 1960
campaign, joined Kennedy's
staff as Special Assistant for
Civil Rights in 1961, and was
also a member of the task force
which drew up and implemented
plans for the Peace Corps.
His first reaction to Bobby
Kennedy, Wofford says, was
Intense dislike. But he later
realized that part of Ken
nedy's reserve and apparent
arrogance could be attributed
to shyness.
The words that Wofford uses

to describe Kennedy are "elec
tric, learning and challenging."
Of these three, he emphasizes
"learning." From the Cuban mis
sile crisis, Wofford says, Ken
nedy learned something about
the need for coexistence, and
gained a sense "that Commu
nism is not a monolith."
Wofford appears convinced
that Kennedy would remain
open to new ideas if he
elected to the White House. As
President, he says, Kennedy
"could start processes and
changes, the consequences of
which are not easily discerned."
Although it is impossible to
predict what any candidate
would do as President, the idr>a
of having an innovator as chief
executive would certainly ap
peal to most young people. And
Wofford's opinions about inno
vation are to be respected. Be
sides his role in organizing the
Peace Corps, he is now starting
a college which is designed to
challenge some of the basic as
sumptions of higher education,
such as admissions policies, divi
sions between subject areas, and
the need for grades.
If anything, Wofford's visit
helped dispel the image of ma
chine-like precision that sur
rounds the Kennedy organiza
tion. Kennedy headquarters in
San Francisco was only vaguely
aware that he was coming, and
his appearance at Stanford was
unpublicized.
The crowd that greeted Wof
ford was commensurate with
the effort and planning that pre
ceded his arrival. It consisted of
about a dozen students and
members of the faculty who
Joined him for coffee at the In
ternational Center. Most of thus
throng consisted of McCarthy
supporters.
Wofford realizes that Ken
nedy has nothing to gain from
an attack on McCarthy. He
docs not distinguish between
the positions of the candidates
on the basic Issih's, although
he does characterize Kennedy
as more of a man of action
than his opponent


HARRIS WOFFORD, JR.
Asked to choose between the
two contenders on the basis of
personality, Wofford says that
he prefers Kennedy.
He feels that Kennedy would
seek out radical and social-revo
lutionary forces that he could
work with, both inside the Unit
ed States and abroad. He points
out that Kennedy's interest in
projects like the urban develop
ment program in Brooklyn's
Bedford-Stuyvesant area has
helped him establish lines of
communication with the poor
and the militant that are not
available to any other candidate.
But the thing that concerns
Wofford most seems to be the
alternative to a Kennedy, or
even a McCarthy, victory. The
kind of campaign planned by
Humphrey will be based on un
ity. But Wofford says that the
kind of unity that would result
from a Humphrey victory would
be "specious and disastrous."
The Humphrey coalition.
Wofford says, would not In
clude either the young or the
blacks. He predicts that a
Humphrey victory would
mean further deterioration in
our relations with the rest of
the world, as well as the ex
plosion of our cities.
This kind of reasoning leads
those who are working for
change in American society
straight back to their original
dilemma. Should they support
candidate who they regard as a
man of great principle, or
should they turn to a man of
action who might have a hotter

chance to be elected?
The question is complicated
by Wofford's conviction that
Kennedy also possesses both
strength of character and the
right attitude towards our for
eign and domestic problems.
And it is still impossible to
prove or disprove Wofford's as
sertion that McCarthy could not
be nominated even if he won in

California.
The only sure thing is that
these questions must be an
swered, and that the price for
answering them incorrectly will
be very high.

Kennedy Presidential campaign
was leveled at Stanford yester
day.
Harris WofTord, former Asso
ciate Director of the Peace
Corps and organizing president
of the experimental Old West
bury campus of the State Uni
versity of New York, invaded
this bastion of McCarthy
strength with a disturbing analy
sis of the current political situ
ation.
If Wofford's assessment is
correct, Senator McCarthy's
followers face a difficult deci
sion. He contends that Robert
Kennedy's chances for the
Democratic nomination will be
killed If he loses In the forth

coming California primary.
But, he says, a McCarthy vic
tory will only guarantee that
some member of the Johnson
establishment will become
the Democratic candidate.
There is strong evidence to
support Wofford's case. Hubert
Humphrey is already guaran
teed nearly half of the first-bal
lot convention votes. Since New
Hampshire, McCarthy has not
demonstrated the kind of pri
mary strength that would ena
ble him to overcome Humph
rey's initial advantage.
Kennedy, on the other hand,
has the makings of a coalition
that might be able to match the
strength of the conservative
Southern-big business-big labor
alliance that would like to per
petuate most of Lyndon John
son's policies.
The young Senator's vote-get
ting power among the minori
ties, based on his civil rights
record and his support of men
like farm labor leader Ceasar
Chavez, is undeniable. His vic
tory in Nebraska, which has a
Negro population of less than
erne per cent, demonstrates that
he also has support among the
white middle class.
Balanced against this kind of
political reasoning is the emo
tional reaction that has built up
against Kennedy after his late
entry into the Presidential con
test. "Ruthless opportunist" was
one of the kinder terms that was
used to describe Wofford's fav
orite candidate yesterday.
Wofford has had a great deal
of contact with Robert Kennedy.
He was one of John Kennedy's
principle advisers in the 1960
campaign, joined Kennedy's
staff as Special Assistant for
Civil Rights in 1961, and was
also a member of the task force
which drew up and implemented
plans for the Peace Corps.
His first reaction to Bobby
Kennedy, Wofford says, was
Intense dislike. But he later
realized that part of Ken
nedy's reserve and apparent
arrogance could be attributed
to shyness.
The words that Wofford uses

to describe Kennedy are "elec
tric, learning and challenging."
Of these three, he emphasizes
"learning." From the Cuban mis
sile crisis, Wofford says, Ken
nedy learned something about
the need for coexistence, and
gained a sense "that Commu
nism is not a monolith."
Wofford appears convinced
that Kennedy would remain
open to new ideas if he
elected to the White House. As
President, he says, Kennedy
"could start processes and
changes, the consequences of
which are not easily discerned."
Although it is impossible to
predict what any candidate
would do as President, the idr>a
of having an innovator as chief
executive would certainly ap
peal to most young people. And
Wofford's opinions about inno
vation are to be respected. Be
sides his role in organizing the
Peace Corps, he is now starting
a college which is designed to
challenge some of the basic as
sumptions of higher education,
such as admissions policies, divi
sions between subject areas, and
the need for grades.
If anything, Wofford's visit
helped dispel the image of ma
chine-like precision that sur
rounds the Kennedy organiza
tion. Kennedy headquarters in
San Francisco was only vaguely
aware that he was coming, and
his appearance at Stanford was
unpublicized.
The crowd that greeted Wof
ford was commensurate with
the effort and planning that pre
ceded his arrival. It consisted of
about a dozen students and
members of the faculty who
Joined him for coffee at the In
ternational Center. Most of thus
throng consisted of McCarthy
supporters.
Wofford realizes that Ken
nedy has nothing to gain from
an attack on McCarthy. He
docs not distinguish between
the positions of the candidates
on the basic Issih's, although
he does characterize Kennedy
as more of a man of action
than his opponent


HARRIS WOFFORD, JR.
Asked to choose between the
two contenders on the basis of
personality, Wofford says that
he prefers Kennedy.
He feels that Kennedy would
seek out radical and social-revo
lutionary forces that he could
work with, both inside the Unit
ed States and abroad. He points
out that Kennedy's interest in
projects like the urban develop
ment program in Brooklyn's
Bedford-Stuyvesant area has
helped him establish lines of
communication with the poor
and the militant that are not
available to any other candidate.
But the thing that concerns
Wofford most seems to be the
alternative to a Kennedy, or
even a McCarthy, victory. The
kind of campaign planned by
Humphrey will be based on un
ity. But Wofford says that the
kind of unity that would result
from a Humphrey victory would
be "specious and disastrous."
The Humphrey coalition.
Wofford says, would not In
clude either the young or the
blacks. He predicts that a
Humphrey victory would
mean further deterioration in
our relations with the rest of
the world, as well as the ex
plosion of our cities.
This kind of reasoning leads
those who are working for
change in American society
straight back to their original
dilemma. Should they support
candidate who they regard as a
man of great principle, or
should they turn to a man of
action who might have a hotter

chance to be elected?
The question is complicated
by Wofford's conviction that
Kennedy also possesses both
strength of character and the
right attitude towards our for
eign and domestic problems.
And it is still impossible to
prove or disprove Wofford's as
sertion that McCarthy could not
be nominated even if he won in

California.
The only sure thing is that
these questions must be an
swered, and that the price for
answering them incorrectly will
be very high.

Harris WofTord, former Asso
ciate Director of the Peace
Corps and organizing president
of the experimental Old West
bury campus of the State Uni
versity of New York, invaded
this bastion of McCarthy
strength with a disturbing analy
sis of the current political situ
ation.
If Wofford's assessment is
correct, Senator McCarthy's
followers face a difficult deci
sion. He contends that Robert
Kennedy's chances for the
Democratic nomination will be
killed If he loses In the forth

coming California primary.
But, he says, a McCarthy vic
tory will only guarantee that
some member of the Johnson
establishment will become
the Democratic candidate.
There is strong evidence to
support Wofford's case. Hubert
Humphrey is already guaran
teed nearly half of the first-bal
lot convention votes. Since New
Hampshire, McCarthy has not
demonstrated the kind of pri
mary strength that would ena
ble him to overcome Humph
rey's initial advantage.
Kennedy, on the other hand,
has the makings of a coalition
that might be able to match the
strength of the conservative
Southern-big business-big labor
alliance that would like to per
petuate most of Lyndon John
son's policies.
The young Senator's vote-get
ting power among the minori
ties, based on his civil rights
record and his support of men
like farm labor leader Ceasar
Chavez, is undeniable. His vic
tory in Nebraska, which has a
Negro population of less than
erne per cent, demonstrates that
he also has support among the
white middle class.
Balanced against this kind of
political reasoning is the emo
tional reaction that has built up
against Kennedy after his late
entry into the Presidential con
test. "Ruthless opportunist" was
one of the kinder terms that was
used to describe Wofford's fav
orite candidate yesterday.
Wofford has had a great deal
of contact with Robert Kennedy.
He was one of John Kennedy's
principle advisers in the 1960
campaign, joined Kennedy's
staff as Special Assistant for
Civil Rights in 1961, and was
also a member of the task force
which drew up and implemented
plans for the Peace Corps.
His first reaction to Bobby
Kennedy, Wofford says, was
Intense dislike. But he later
realized that part of Ken
nedy's reserve and apparent
arrogance could be attributed
to shyness.
The words that Wofford uses

to describe Kennedy are "elec
tric, learning and challenging."
Of these three, he emphasizes
"learning." From the Cuban mis
sile crisis, Wofford says, Ken
nedy learned something about
the need for coexistence, and
gained a sense "that Commu
nism is not a monolith."
Wofford appears convinced
that Kennedy would remain
open to new ideas if he
elected to the White House. As
President, he says, Kennedy
"could start processes and
changes, the consequences of
which are not easily discerned."
Although it is impossible to
predict what any candidate
would do as President, the idr>a
of having an innovator as chief
executive would certainly ap
peal to most young people. And
Wofford's opinions about inno
vation are to be respected. Be
sides his role in organizing the
Peace Corps, he is now starting
a college which is designed to
challenge some of the basic as
sumptions of higher education,
such as admissions policies, divi
sions between subject areas, and
the need for grades.
If anything, Wofford's visit
helped dispel the image of ma
chine-like precision that sur
rounds the Kennedy organiza
tion. Kennedy headquarters in
San Francisco was only vaguely
aware that he was coming, and
his appearance at Stanford was
unpublicized.
The crowd that greeted Wof
ford was commensurate with
the effort and planning that pre
ceded his arrival. It consisted of
about a dozen students and
members of the faculty who
Joined him for coffee at the In
ternational Center. Most of thus
throng consisted of McCarthy
supporters.
Wofford realizes that Ken
nedy has nothing to gain from
an attack on McCarthy. He
docs not distinguish between
the positions of the candidates
on the basic Issih's, although
he does characterize Kennedy
as more of a man of action
than his opponent


HARRIS WOFFORD, JR.
Asked to choose between the
two contenders on the basis of
personality, Wofford says that
he prefers Kennedy.
He feels that Kennedy would
seek out radical and social-revo
lutionary forces that he could
work with, both inside the Unit
ed States and abroad. He points
out that Kennedy's interest in
projects like the urban develop
ment program in Brooklyn's
Bedford-Stuyvesant area has
helped him establish lines of
communication with the poor
and the militant that are not
available to any other candidate.
But the thing that concerns
Wofford most seems to be the
alternative to a Kennedy, or
even a McCarthy, victory. The
kind of campaign planned by
Humphrey will be based on un
ity. But Wofford says that the
kind of unity that would result
from a Humphrey victory would
be "specious and disastrous."
The Humphrey coalition.
Wofford says, would not In
clude either the young or the
blacks. He predicts that a
Humphrey victory would
mean further deterioration in
our relations with the rest of
the world, as well as the ex
plosion of our cities.
This kind of reasoning leads
those who are working for
change in American society
straight back to their original
dilemma. Should they support
candidate who they regard as a
man of great principle, or
should they turn to a man of
action who might have a hotter

chance to be elected?
The question is complicated
by Wofford's conviction that
Kennedy also possesses both
strength of character and the
right attitude towards our for
eign and domestic problems.
And it is still impossible to
prove or disprove Wofford's as
sertion that McCarthy could not
be nominated even if he won in

California.
The only sure thing is that
these questions must be an
swered, and that the price for
answering them incorrectly will
be very high.
