# Hayesâ€”Von Schlegell Team Comments On Future Plans
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
The election that coined a mil
lion one-line comments and at
tracted nation - wide attention
ended yesterday as many of the
supporters of Dpnis Hayes and
Vicky Drake had expected it
would.
Vicki Drake wasn't visibly
taken aback by her defeat, as
she gamely offered the follow
ing statement to the press: "My
enemies will stop at nothing.
They must have stuffed the bal
lot box."
In the other camp, Hayes'
running mate, Victor Von Schle
gell, noted that the main task
for the two who received the
largest vote ever for a slate of
candidates is "to gain some sort
of legitimacy" for student gov
ernment at Stanford.
Hayes began work last night
to gain one of the goals of his

administration by mailing let
ters to the members of thfl
Board of Trustees requesting
that students be allowed to
participate in the Presidential
Search Committee.
The defeat of a new constitu
tion proposed by a spring con
stitutional convention failed to
give Hayes the change in ASSU
that he had hoped to go into
next fall with.
If LASSU can be convinced to
place the question on the ballot
again, Hayes hopes that stu
dents will become familiar
enough with the provisions of
the document to pass it.
At the same time, Hayes says
that the experience of his past
two months as ASSU
have acquainted him with
the channels in the University
that have to be utilised for
change.
Hayes will continue to eat at

different residences around cam
pus to "try to find people inter
ested in working on those things
that we have been talking about
in our campaign."
Von Schlegell plans to work
on reforms in the University
that particularly interest him.
Within the next few weeks he
will be organizing an educa
tional commission to discuss!
the ASSU professorship,
course review, newer seminars
and other suggested changes.
"If people could get their
thoughts correlated on what
should be a community govern
ment and how to achieve stu
dent power," Von Schlegell
added, "I think that we would
have a much more viable m?ans
of expressing dissent, praise, or
whatever."
Haves is quick to point out
that he and Von Schlegell "are
in no way trying to oust the
people presently in th.? ASSU
government."
The newly-elected president
and vice-president will be trying
to draw new faces into student
government. Hayes indicated
that he will try to convince stu
d from the engineering
school, graduate students, fra
ternity members, and next yoar's
freshmen that there are a vari
ety of roles they can perform in
his government.
On a final question that has
arisen as a result of last week's
sit-in, Von Schlegell said, "I
hope that confrontations aren't
necessary next year."
Hayes added that the sit-in of
last week showed that students
"must be no longer ignored."
On another subject Hayes re
f r ed to tho matter of tenure
and advancement as a "crucial
area student perspective
is absolutely essential."
