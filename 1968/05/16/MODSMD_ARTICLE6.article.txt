# Parental Aid Unaffected By Unrest On Campus
## 
### SUE CRIBARI 
Robert P. Huff, director of
Financial Aids, squelched the
rumor that recent unrest on the
campus has caused many par
ents of Stanford students to dis
continue financial support of
their son's or daughter's educa

tion. "I think a great deal mora
of Stanford parents than to ex
pect that," he said.
Huff claimed that in the last
four to five years, his office has
not denied a loan to any student
with real financial need. How
ever, "We could really be in
trouble" if something like a
mass withdrawal of parental
support occurred.
A student's primary means
of support. Huff explained,
are his own funds, in the form
of gifts or money that he has
saved, and funds from his
family. The job of the Finan
cial Aids Office is to All any
gaps that occur.
Parents sometimes do remove
their support, Huff said, after a
disagreement over such things
as the choice of a major or mar
riage partner, and occasionally
because of activities in which
their son or daughter has par
ticipated. However, "I would not
want in any way to infer that
this occurs often," Huff said.
JRathf r, this happens in "only a
handful" of cases.
Huff added that the number
of students requesting financial
aid is not any greater than
usual for this time of year and
that he did not foresee any
large increase due to recont cam
pus activities. "Family ties have
to be pretty superficial for that
kind of thing to cause abandon
ment."
