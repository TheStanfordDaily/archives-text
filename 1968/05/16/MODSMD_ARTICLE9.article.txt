# Blacks To Present Readings Of Poetry
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
AFRO-WEST, Stanford's new
theater of the black arts, will
make its second campus presen
tation tonight while continuing
its program of poetry readings
in predominantly black high
schools in the Bay Area.
Tonight's event will be a poet
ry reading by Leroy Goodwin
of San Francisco State, at 8 p.m.
at Beta Chi.
AFRO-WEST's programs for
this quarter will consist almost
exclusively of poetry readings,
although there is a possibility a
play will be produced, according
to Johnnie Scott, the group's
founder.
Next year, however, several
dramatic productions are plan
ned, including Blues for Mister
Charlie, Raisin in the Sun, Pur
lie Victorious, George Bernard
Shaw's Black Girl in Search of
God, and The Maids.
Each production will have an
all-black cast, with actors gath
ered from around the Bay Area.
The main purpose of the
poetry readings this quarter are
"to publicize the group, to firmly
establish it, and to secure finan
cial support" for next year,
Scott said. "The theater will be
a thing unto itself."
In the meantime, AFRO
WEST has been concentrating
on bringing modern black cul
ture to the local black ghettos.
For example, Scott gave a read
ing at Antioch High School in
Antioch last Thurs ay.
Other readings have been
tentatively arranged for Oak

land Tech, McClymonds, and
Castlemont high schools in Oak
land and Ravenswood locally.
Next week, Scott and Art
Wilson will read poetry at the
Committee in San Francisco,
and the two hope to bring the
Committee to Stanford as an
exchange.
Some of the poets AFRO
WEST will bring in for readings
are from the Watts Writers'
Workshop. These include Em
mery Evans, Ojenke, and Quin
cy Troupe.
Troupe took second place in
the competition for the John
Hay Whitney fellowship in
poetry.
Scott noted that he has been
receiving many offers of help
for the project. One of these is
from John Cochran, now direct
ing Slow Dance on the Killing
Ground in San Francisco. Coch
ran was arrested in Pittsburgh
for producing Leßoi Jones' The
Toilet
Others include Leonard Sym
onds and Glen Batlte of the
Manhattan Playhouse.
Scott has been busy publi
cizing the venture, and rec
ently made a tape for KPFA
for which he read some of his
poetry and discussed AFRO
WEST. He said KPFA is In
terested In doing another show
on the project, "a group thing."
He also said the group would
like to present more events on
campus for any group willing
to meet the expenses of those
involved. Joe Goone and Walter
Banks are coordinating these
activities.

Scott said. "The theater will be
a thing unto itself."
In the meantime, AFRO
WEST has been concentrating
on bringing modern black cul
ture to the local black ghettos.
For example, Scott gave a read
ing at Antioch High School in
Antioch last Thurs ay.
Other readings have been
tentatively arranged for Oak

land Tech, McClymonds, and
Castlemont high schools in Oak
land and Ravenswood locally.
Next week, Scott and Art
Wilson will read poetry at the
Committee in San Francisco,
and the two hope to bring the
Committee to Stanford as an
exchange.
Some of the poets AFRO
WEST will bring in for readings
are from the Watts Writers'
Workshop. These include Em
mery Evans, Ojenke, and Quin
cy Troupe.
Troupe took second place in
the competition for the John
Hay Whitney fellowship in
poetry.
Scott noted that he has been
receiving many offers of help
for the project. One of these is
from John Cochran, now direct
ing Slow Dance on the Killing
Ground in San Francisco. Coch
ran was arrested in Pittsburgh
for producing Leßoi Jones' The
Toilet
Others include Leonard Sym
onds and Glen Batlte of the
Manhattan Playhouse.
Scott has been busy publi
cizing the venture, and rec
ently made a tape for KPFA
for which he read some of his
poetry and discussed AFRO
WEST. He said KPFA is In
terested In doing another show
on the project, "a group thing."
He also said the group would
like to present more events on
campus for any group willing
to meet the expenses of those
involved. Joe Goone and Walter
Banks are coordinating these
activities.
AFRO-WEST, Stanford's new
theater of the black arts, will
make its second campus presen
tation tonight while continuing
its program of poetry readings
in predominantly black high
schools in the Bay Area.
Tonight's event will be a poet
ry reading by Leroy Goodwin
of San Francisco State, at 8 p.m.
at Beta Chi.
AFRO-WEST's programs for
this quarter will consist almost
exclusively of poetry readings,
although there is a possibility a
play will be produced, according
to Johnnie Scott, the group's
founder.
Next year, however, several
dramatic productions are plan
ned, including Blues for Mister
Charlie, Raisin in the Sun, Pur
lie Victorious, George Bernard
Shaw's Black Girl in Search of
God, and The Maids.
Each production will have an
all-black cast, with actors gath
ered from around the Bay Area.
The main purpose of the
poetry readings this quarter are
"to publicize the group, to firmly
establish it, and to secure finan
cial support" for next year,
Scott said. "The theater will be
a thing unto itself."
