# Trustees Rap Sit-In Tactics
## 
### 
The Stanford Board of Trus
tees yesterday requested stu
dents, faculty, and administrat
ors to continue "with the great
est sense of urgency" their
efforts to develop means of elim
inating sit-ins and other disrup
tive activities "which strike at
the very existence of the uni
versity."
After hearing a report from
President Wallace Sterling and
other University officers on last
week's sit-in at the Old Student
Union, the trustees unanimously
adopted a resolution that "sit
ins and other activities by any
member of the university com
munity that disrupt or attempt

to disrupt the actvitives of the
university must no longer be
tolerated at Stanford."
In an all-time record vote
Tuesday and Wednesday,
Stanford students condemned
the use of force In seeking
change on campus and called
forceful occupation of Uni
versity buildings "unaccept
able behavior at Stanford."
The vote in favor of this mea
sure was 3,924 to 1,695, a 70
percent margin.
In their resolution, the trust
ees said that "confrontation tac
tics, whether involving sit-ins
of other coercive devices, in
variably subvert the very nature
and purpose of a university by:
• substituting coercion by a
militant minority for orderly
academic procedures;
• making impossible the ra
tional evolution of the univers
ity to meet changing conditions;
and
~ • denying legitimate freedom
of speech or action to those with
whom that militant minority
disagrees."
By disrupting the proper ac
tivities of the university, the
trustees added, confrontation
tactics "waste priceless intelli
gence which should be contrib
uting to a solution of the world's
problems."
They noted that "the pur
suit of knowledge requires the
free exchange of ideas, how
ever unpopular, among all
members of the academic
community."
Stanford, they said, "exists to
increase human knowledge and
to develop understanding and
respect for truth, especially
among Its own faculty and stu
dents."
