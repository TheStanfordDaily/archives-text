# When Academic Council Met
## 
### 
(The following account of the
controversial Academic Council
Meeting of May 8 was submitted
by AVRAM GOLDSTEIN, Pro
fessor of Pharmacology.)
There were good reasons not
to air the details of the stormy
meeting of the Academic Coun
cil, the vote at which resulted
directly in the peaceful resolu
tion of the sit-in crisis. But Pro
fessor Howard's misleading ac
count, calling into question the
integrity of the majority of his
colleagues, must be corrected.
The resolution that ultimately
gained acceptance by the ma
jority dealt concretely with the
issues that had led to the sit-in.
Its proponents thought the reso
lution to be in the best interest
of the university. The opponents
preferred a different course of
action. It seems clear at present
that the majority was correct.
But whether or not this view
of the matter is borne out by
long-term events, it is important
to realize that the vote on the
resolution had nothing to do with
confidence or lack of confidence
in the administration. That false
issue was introduced as follows.
At the end of the debate, when
the vote was about to be taken,
a spokesman for the administra
tion unexpectedly asserted that
passage of the resolution would
amount to a vote of no confi
dence. One could easily under
stand how the strain of the pre
vious days and the heat of the
moment had led to this extra
ordinary confusion of the issue.
The proponents of the reso
lution immediately made it
plain that this was neither
their intention nor their inter- 1
pretation — rather that there
was a straightforward ques
tion of how best to deal with
an immediate threat to the sta
bility of the university, and
that it was only upon this ques
tion that the Academic Coun
cil was being asked to express
an opinion.
The vote was then taken in the
customary manner, the ayes and
nays standing and being counted
by tellers. A question was rais
ed from the floor as to the right
of everyone present to vote. The
rules were read, in consequence
of which four visiting and act
ing faculty members disqualified
themselves. The outcome was
perfectly clear — the resolution
had passed by 284 to 245.
It was at this point that things
took a highly irregular and un
fortunate turn. A roll call was
demanded from the floor, and a
spokesman for the administra
tion insisted that on so impor

tant an issue "we are entitled to
have a roll call." The angry inter
jection of one member of the
Academic Council (alluded to by
Professor Howard) was a vain
attempt to question whether a
roll call was in order, and to
point out the inescapable mean
ing of a roll call at this point.
The administration had mis
takenly but nonetheless earnest
ly announced that those voting
affirmatively were expressing a
lack of confidence. Now assist
ant professors without tenure,
associate professors expecting
promotion, deans and assistant
deans — all those whose posi
tions might involve some degree
of dependence upon the good
will of the administration —
were to be identified on this
vote.
Moreover, whole schools, like
wise dependent upon good work
ing relationships with the ad
ministration, would inevitably
be characterized as "pro" or "an
ti" in consequence of this vote.
Thus to record these polarized
positions could only exacerbate
and perpetuate antagonisms
within the faculty, to the detri
ment of the university.
Indeed, situations of this
kind provide the classical jus
tification for a secret ballot,
the exact opposite of a roll
call. And probably for the
same reason, a roll eall may
not even be ordered legally by
the presiding officer; it re
quires a majority vote (Rob
erts Rules of Order). The sole
exception concerns assemblies
whose rules provide especially
for roll calls; in a representa
tive body like the Congress, for
example, the roll call is a
mechanism for constituents
to find out how their repre
sentatives vote.
On the whole, the outcome
was a tribute to the courage of
faculty members in standing by
thoir convictions regardless of
what seemed to be an implied
threat. But I know of at least a
few instances in which formerly
affirmative votes became nega
tive on the roll call; these were
balanced, apparently, by recip
rocal switches on the part of
people outraged by the proce
dure.
As a vocal proponent of the
majority position, who also has
full confidence in the present ad
ministration's ability to lead this
university wisely, I hope this
airing of events may contribute
to the development of better
mechanisms for faculty delibera
tion in the future. What is re
quired, both in the faculty as

a whole in the new Faculty Sen
ate, is adequate time for full
and productive discussion of
major issues, mutual respect for
opposing points of view, and
care to avoid confusing positions
with personalities. Above all, the
faculty must be willing to assert
and assume its full share of re
sponsibility for policy-making at
this collegial institution.
