# Letters To The Editor
## Standards No Longer Equal 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Dr. Wiseman's questions (Let
ters, May 14) concerned Stan
ford's new "minority group pol
icy" are often raised. The core
of Dr. Wiseman's letter is ex
pressed by the following sen
tence: "I also feel that the stand
ards for acceptance, for finan
cial support, and for mainten
ance within the university should
be equal and identical for all
students." The remaining con
text of the letter rests on the as
sumption that Stanford's new
policies are contradictory to the
doctor's view expressed above.
As I am sure the doctor knows,
black people in this country have
been segregated, by force, from
the majority group, have been
relegated to the lowest socio
economic class, and have had
their very humanity denied. One
can clearly see that all of these
factors work to prevent black
students from performing well
on tests, which are written for
and by members of the white
middle class, or from becoming
honor students in their high
schools, which are often more
oppressive than supportive.
Therefore, to judge solely by
these standards (i.e. test scores
and grades) is unjust to the stu
dent and contradictory to the
university's desire to find tal
ented people. With respect to
the opportunities for meeting
these "standards" the society has
made blacks and whites unequal.
"Equal" standards applied to
forced "unequals" become un
equal standards. Every enlight
ened university in this nation,
few as they may be, has recog
nized the fallacy of the "objec
tive standards" argument.
Stanford's new policies, al

though only a beginning, recog
nize these realities.

Stanford Position On
ISDEA Funds Unclear
Editor, The Dally:
Why hasn't the administration
of Stanford spoken out against
the proposed legislation to limit
NDEA funds to only "safe" stu
dents? Richard Lyman's state
ments were at best ambiguous
and weak; his position is still
unclear.
The members of the admini
stration have their freedom of
speech guaranteed by law. Why
don't they use it? A strong, pub
lic, unambiguous statement by
college administrations opposing
this legislation could avert its
passage by the Senate. This pro
posed law may even be uncon
stitutional. Its constitutionality
is, in any case, in doubt. These
men have a constitutionally pro
tected right to speak out loudly
and forcibly to advise against
and prevent its passage.
Is the reason that the Stan
ford administration has not
-itood against this potentially un
constitutional bill that these men
actually favor its enactment?
Would they be willirlg to accept
any means, legal or not, that
allows them to continue un
changed?

Who Is Immature?
Cesare 9 s Comments
Editor, The Daily:
Exactly who is immature was
abundantly demonstrated by the

comments of Cesare Massarnti
immediately following the elec
tion results.

Lacking Taste, Sense
Students Fail To Show
Editor, The Daily:
Cesare Massarenti's comments
on his censure exceed the bounds
of both good taste and good sen
se. He has been taken to task
not for having been born on the
wrong side of an ocean, but rath
er for having resorted to tac
tics which were incompatible
with the nature and the dignity
of his office in order to pressure
the University administration
into rescinding a decision with
which he disagreed. . . .

Respect For Individual
Editor, The Daily:
When I first heard of the rec
ord turnout in the past student
body election, I was happy to
see that a majority of Stanford
students had finally risen out of
their apathetic bed. But when I
read of the results, epecially on
particular referendums, my hap
piness turned to sadness.
A vote to censure Cesare Mas
sarenti is not only sad, but sick
ening. Perhaps I disagree with
Cesare on political issues, per
haps I don't favor some of his
"tactics," but I do respect his
sincerity in trying to help this
university, and more than that
I respect him as a person.
What do students hope to ac
complish by a vote of censure?
Is a censure vote the way to op
pose someone you disagree with?
I prefer to be on the side of Ce
sare who may be wrong in "tac
tics" than go along with those
who show a lack of respect for
him as an individual.

Don't Ignore Vote On
Recruiting Referendum
Editor, The Daily:
During the recent turmoil, an
important event occurred which
was obscured in the Daily by
placing it under a headline per
taining to the ASSU presidential
election.
I would like to call attention
to the results of the very impor
tant referendum in which Stan
ford students overwhelmingly
voted by a margin of 6 to 1
(3920 to 676) in favor of allow
ing all employers equal access
to recruiting facilities. Hopeful
ly, no student will be denied ac
cess to the campus recruitment
activities of any prospective em
ployer in the future.

Participation Likely In
New Judicial System
Editor, The Daily:
I noticed in the May 13 Daily
that Marc Sapir and co-authors
do not view all the results of
last week's events with favor.
We are now informed that un
less the Committee of Fifteen
proposes a judicial plan that
agrees point for point with the
protesters demands, Marc, et al
will find it "impossible â€” to par
ticipate in the new legal sys
tem."
While the Stanford commu
nity could probably survive with
out the participation of these co
signers, we should still invite
them to reconsider. After all, if
the past can teach us of the fu
ture, Marc and his co-thinkers
are likely to be dealing with
the new judiciary in one capa
city or another, whatever their
current intentions. Some things
never change.
