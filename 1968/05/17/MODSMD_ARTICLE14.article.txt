# A 						Proposal
## Institute Of Urban Studies 
### 
We, a group of graduate stu
dents, write this letter to ask for
responses indicating interest or
a willingness to help in forming
an interdepartmental Institute
of Urban Studies at Stanford.
The problem is the major prob
lem of this country today—the
Urban Crisis. Our motivation is
the urgent need for change in
our society and our desire to
prepare ourselves to participate
in that process.
Stanford University does not
now stand apart from that socie
ty as a training center for tech
nicians and a recluse for schol
ars. At certain levels the Univer
sity is involved in governmental
planning and in military re
search and we feel it must also
begin a deep involvement in the
urban crisis.
The university has taken ac
tion in some areas. Positive
steps have been taken to assign
new priorities for admissions,
scholarship, and hiring practices.
We know that the will to do
more exists within this academ
ic community and we know
more is needed. What has been
done is necessary, but not suf
ficient, and it is equally impor
tant, as Professor Arrow has
said, for the university to change
its academic priorities. The need
for relevant teaching and action
is clear.
At the meeting of graduate
students that produced this let
ter, we found a consensus on
two major goals: one to insti
tute a comprehensive selection
of courses on urban problems;
and two, to initiate direct action
assistance programs in the pe
ninsula's urban areas. Various
departments now have students
planning or involving in direct
assistance programs.
In the Law School, students
plan to assist the State Legisla
ture in the research needed to
draft and pass needed social leg
islation, and large numbers cur
rentlv assist the urban poor

through a legal aid program.
Business school students recent
ly embarked on a business aid
program to advise and to stimu
late small business creation
within the ghetto and slums
areas contingent to Stanford.
Sociology, Anthropology, Po
litical Science, and Education
students forsee courses on ur
ban problems and complement
ary direct assistance to commu
nities that are attempting to
design plans for change. All the
students expressed the desire to
relate their graduate studies and
research to active involvement.
Some departments were not rep
resented, but we feel that others
— Architecture, Engineering,
Communications—have comple
mentary interests.
The idea for an Institute of
Urban Studies was born from
the faculty committee report of
April, 1967 —Report of Provost's
Committee on Metropolitan
Studies, from Marvin Chodo
row's proposal to SKS for an In
stitute of Urban Studies, and
from student discussions. The
student group felt a co-operative
effort of the faculty, administra
tion, and students could most ef
fectively plan and initiate such
an institute. While we are en
couraged by stei>s taken in this
direction by individual depart
ments, we feel that a sustained,
coordinated, inter disciplinary
program is needed.
Immediately, we are forming
an Ad Hoc committee of faculty
and students to plan such an in
stitute. Short range objectives
include:
1. Coordinating and publiciz
ing existing courses and direct
action programs related to urban
affairs.
2. Developing a planned series
of speakers and workshops on
urban problems for next year.
3. Establishing a financial re
search group to seek temporary
funding from foundations, pri
vate individuals, and the govern

ment. Long range objectives are:
1. Establishing a comprehen
sive interdepartmental set of
courses on Urban Problems.
a. establishing new courses
in a wide range of depart
ments
b. gaining recognition for an
interdepartmental major in
this field
2. Endowing professorial chairs
as a part of the Institute itself.
3. Hiring a professional staff
to run the Institute.
4. Providing long range fund
ing for the Institute's teaching,
speaker-workshop, and direct ac
tion programs.
To close, we ask the help of
the administration, the faculty
and interested students to form
an Institute of Urban Studies.
