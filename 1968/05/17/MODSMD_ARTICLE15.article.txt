# Patiently Writing Up Peace
## 
### Max Lerner 
The hardest death that sol
diers will die on either side, and
the hardest for their families to
bear, will be death during the
peacemaking, between now and
the day when the script is signed
and the guns are settled. It is
hard enough to tolerate death
when a war is in full swing. It
is doubly hard when there is a
race between death and peace—
and death wins.
The Hanoi Communist regime,
which had hoped for many ad
vantages when the peace talks
finally came, has had to watch
most of them vanish. Although

a battle is still being fought on
the outskirts of Saigon, there
are no Viet Cong flags flying in
any South Vietnamese city. The
Saigon government, written off
so many times, has survived
every crisis and is functioning
tolerably.
While Hanoi is still on the
military offensive, it can no long
er strike at will and with sur
prise, as it did in the Tet at
tacks. Within America itself
Lyndon Johnson is no longer
the whipping-boy for intense an
tiwar feeling and demonstra
tions. The headlines are about

student sit-ins on campus issues,
not war or draft. Having with
drawn as a candidate for Presi
dent, Mr. Johnson can concen
trate on the home and peace
fronts.
Public Watching
The one advantage Hanoi still
has is its greater capacity to
support deaths while the talks
go on in Paris. One other linked
advantage: the America watch
ing and responding to the talks
will be totally open to view, with
its campaigns, its candidates, its
conflicts and inner violence. Not
so North Vietnam, the secret re

sponses of whose people we
shall probably never know.
In the history of peace talks,
the outcome for each side has
always depended on four sets of
factors: its military bargaining
strength, in terms of the balance
of forces in the field; the skill,
will and resourcefulness of its
negotiators; the strength and
leadership of the people, for
whom the negotiators are speak
ing; the climate surrounding
both the negotiators and the na
tion—the envelope of ideas and
emotions which contains them
both.

We have been told
how difficult it is to negotiate
with Communists, and there can
be no question that it Is. But it
is not because they are more
tortuous or inscrutable than oth
er elites and other power sys
tems. It is quite simply because
they take account of all the sets
of factors I have cited and are
especially aware of the psycho
logical and political factors.
They know that if you stretch
out the peace talks and keep up
the fighting, the other side may
tire of fighting in its eagerness
for peace. Then you get what
happened during the Korean ne
gotiations, when so many allied
lives were lost because of the
slackening of patience and the
will to fight.
Partner With Saigon
This question of patient
strength, and of good will along
with firmness at the conference
table, may well determine how
many or how few lives are lost
before the final script is signed,
and whether we can escape an
other dismal episode like the
Vietnamese war in our time. The
position of Averell Harriman
and Cyrus Vance at Paris will
be all the more difficult because
America has fought the war in
tandem with the Saigon regime
and cannot help making the
peace in tandem with them as
well. But since it is American
strength that has kept the war
going, it is America which is the
stronger partner in the team.
On the issue of recognizing
the Viet Cong as a party to the
final agreement, Saigon's veto
cannot prevail. On the issue of
an all-out end to bombing in the
north, Saigon's stress on a re
ciprocal lowering of the infiltra
tion rate into the south makes
sense.
On the question of agreeing to
a "fusion" or "coalition" govern
ment in the south after the
peace, America cannot — either
politically or morally — sign
away beforehand the right of
the people of South Vietnam to
decide on what regime they will
have. But out of the bargaining
there may merge an agreement
to make the Viet Cong a legal
party in later elections, provided
it gives up its resort to arms
and accepts the resort to the
ballot.
