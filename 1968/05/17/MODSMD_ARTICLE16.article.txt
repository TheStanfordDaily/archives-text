# Two Minutes of Haight
## Pictures At An Exhibition 
### Tim Haight 
Walking through Stanford
Shopping Center, from one bank
to the other, depositing paper
and paying the rent. Then,
among the horses and fashions,
the indistinct faces and copies
of Klee, the mind said "Why?"
and the voice said "Help!"
You see, there is this exhibit
of junior high and high school
art there. And smack dab in the
middle, glanced at by touring
housewives with their Bank-
Americards, are these collages
from a ninth grade class.
One was called (rather the
words were painted on it)
"Where will we be when the
last sun sets?" It was the figure
of a woman, completely covered
with magazine photos and
words. In the top of the head a
little "imagination" and the big
"Why?" In the mouth, a little
"Vietnam" and a big "Help "
The woman's hand was the hand
of a mannequin: 1890 doll-clay
with a broken old wristwatch,
holding a big, big pill marked
"life".

"Wow, that's a wild collage,"
said a mid - twentish well
ooifTed woman to her friend
as they hurried past. The face
of the figure was painted on,
and for some reason It re
minded me a Nebraska farm
er on the news a week ago,
saying, "The politicians don't
care about us. A man came
down from Lincoln once, to
get our votes." Magazine type
labelled it,"THE STRONG
FACE."
In her belly was an iron-hued,
slicked-down photo of Verushka,
in her thighs, rows and rows of
market shelves of detergent. On
her feet, men's shoes.
In another collage (different
artist, same teacher, a Mr.—Not
Mrs. —Robinson) the mind said,
"Stone." In the legs were Bud
weiser labels and bottle-tops, in
the crotch, an empty beer can—
Falstaff. In one arm was the Red
Cavalry, in the other the Hell's
Angels. Mick Jagger was in one
shoulder.
The older the kids got, the
more professional the work—in

a way. This one had a figure
from Kandinsky, another a cub
ist composition reminiscent of
Braque, another the texture and
cryptic black lines of a try at
Klee. They were fit to be hung
in any house, and to be pointed
out to someone, "My kid did
that." "Yes, it looks a bit like a
Klee."
There was a nice metal
sculpture of an old bike with
little wheels, with a stringy
yellow rider with steel-wool
hair giving the finger to the
world as he careened through
fixed space. I've seen that. But
most of the rest was like it
was when I was in school.
You know, people on the way
up.
All of this in that ziggurat of
commerce. I dug it. "Somebody
spoke and I went into a dream."
Those collages, the TV that is
like them, the new interdepen
dence that they preach, that
"Where will we be when the last
sun sets?" Remember what
Faulkner said:
"It is easy enough to say that
man is immortal simply because
he will endure: that when the
last ding-dong of doom has
clanged and faded from the last
worthless rock hanging tideless
in the last red and dying eve
ning, that even then there will

still be one more sound: that of
his puny inexhaustible voice,
still talking.
"I refuse to accept this. I be
lieve that man will not merely
endure: he will prevail. He is
immortal, not because he alone
among creatures has an inex
haustible voice, but because he
has a soul, a spirit capable of
compassion and sacrifice and en
durance."
Making the invisible visible.
The mind said "why?" and the
voice said "Help." This week,
people's reactions to my last
week's column went like this:
"Just because you make a deci
sion of conscience doesn't
mean we don't have them,
too." and "We're doing 1 things;
you just don't know about
them." Well, why don't you
tell me?
Meanwhile, a poor driven
chick with two ministers for
parents dances out her crisis,
woodenly; Cesare wants to wear
a "C" on his back; an identity,
our newly-elected head of stu
dent state, continues his search
for a crisis, or at least an hon
est conviction. Dylan sings about
the masters and their rules for
the wise men and the fools, and
I sing, "Goodbye, my Coney Is
land baby. Farewell, my own
true love."
