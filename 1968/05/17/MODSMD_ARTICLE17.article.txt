## Who's Who At Stanford 
### 
(George N. Crocker's column
below appeared In the "San Fran
cisco Examiner" of Monday, May
13. We reprint it here as an ex
ample of how the Stanford situ

ation may be construed by
papers across the nation.)
The demoralization of higher
education in America, expertly
scored and orchestrated, moves
along with Wagnerian continui
ty. Who turns up as an organizer
of the putsch on the Stanford
campus but Steve Weissman
This apparently perennial stu
dent was disrupting the Univer
sity of California while a "teach
ing assistant" as far back as
1964. He was inciting tumult in
the streets of San Francisco in
1965, and had established his rec
ord as a convicted and jailed
troublemaker long before Stan
ford took him on board as a
graduate student.
Before Stanford was selected
as the next focus of his atten
tion, he had been on a nation
wide tour with Mario Savio to
prove his dedication to campus
turmoil.
Imbalance
Stanford, a private institution,
was no more obligated to en
roll Steve Weissman than it
would Fidel Castro. But for some
years there has been ideological
imbalance in the administration
and faculty at Stanford, creat
ing such a tilt to the left that
Secretary of State Dean Rusk
dared not even risk an appear
ance on the campus last Janu
ary.
He cancelled his scheduled ad
dress because, as it was reported
in the Washington Post, the mili
tants among the faculty and stu
dents at Stanford "were pre
paring for an outburst to end all
outbursts."
Stanford's agony has the typ
ical antecedents. There was a his
tory professor named Lyman
who had a penchant for signing
ads in metropolitan papers to de
nounce American policy in Viet
nam and to urge recognition
of the Chinese Communist re
gime of Mao Tse-tung.
There was a law professor

named Packer whose extra-cur
ricular activities ran toward den
igrating the House Committee
on Un-American Activities, urg
ing the reopening of the Alger
Hiss case, and writing for the
New Republic, in which he in
serted a plug for "a public re
view board to investigate com
plaints of police brutality."
Promoted
Did these two know the road
to promotion in the academic
hierarchy? Evidently so; for in
November 1966, out of the hun
dreds of teachers at Stanford,
Lyman was appointed vice pres
ident and provost, the No. 2 post,
and Packer was named vice pro
vost for academic planning, the
No. 3 post.
The message got through loud
and clear to all members of the
faculty, to especially impress the
young and ambitious. Nor did
the students miss the point.
ASSU Presidents
A recent student body presi
dent was Dave Harris, now the
husband of Joan Baez and under
indictment for draft evasion. The
present one, 27-year-old Cesare
Massarenti, is an imported rad
ical from Italy. As leader of the
"demonstrators" who broke into
and occupied the administration
building, he shouted to the mob:
"This is our university. It is
not the faculty's, it is not the
administration.'s. It is ours."
Megalomania
One is tempted to stress the
symptoms of megalomania in
this nonsense. Is poor Cesare be
ing devoured by a need to be a
Caesar in more than name? He's
too big to spank.
There is a prestigious board
of trustees. It is whispered that
the trustees, for the most part,
are amiable tycoons — strong
men in their business or profes
sion, but overawed by the aca
demic mind and pusillanimous in
any showdown with the faculty.
We shall see.

Secretary of State Dean Rusk
dared not even risk an appear
ance on the campus last Janu
ary.
He cancelled his scheduled ad
dress because, as it was reported
in the Washington Post, the mili
tants among the faculty and stu
dents at Stanford "were pre
paring for an outburst to end all
outbursts."
Stanford's agony has the typ
ical antecedents. There was a his
tory professor named Lyman
who had a penchant for signing
ads in metropolitan papers to de
nounce American policy in Viet
nam and to urge recognition
of the Chinese Communist re
gime of Mao Tse-tung.
There was a law professor

named Packer whose extra-cur
ricular activities ran toward den
igrating the House Committee
on Un-American Activities, urg
ing the reopening of the Alger
Hiss case, and writing for the
New Republic, in which he in
serted a plug for "a public re
view board to investigate com
plaints of police brutality."
Promoted
Did these two know the road
to promotion in the academic
hierarchy? Evidently so; for in
November 1966, out of the hun
dreds of teachers at Stanford,
Lyman was appointed vice pres
ident and provost, the No. 2 post,
and Packer was named vice pro
vost for academic planning, the
No. 3 post.
The message got through loud
and clear to all members of the
faculty, to especially impress the
young and ambitious. Nor did
the students miss the point.
ASSU Presidents
A recent student body presi
dent was Dave Harris, now the
husband of Joan Baez and under
indictment for draft evasion. The
present one, 27-year-old Cesare
Massarenti, is an imported rad
ical from Italy. As leader of the
"demonstrators" who broke into
and occupied the administration
building, he shouted to the mob:
"This is our university. It is
not the faculty's, it is not the
administration.'s. It is ours."
Megalomania
One is tempted to stress the
symptoms of megalomania in
this nonsense. Is poor Cesare be
ing devoured by a need to be a
Caesar in more than name? He's
too big to spank.
There is a prestigious board
of trustees. It is whispered that
the trustees, for the most part,
are amiable tycoons — strong
men in their business or profes
sion, but overawed by the aca
demic mind and pusillanimous in
any showdown with the faculty.
We shall see.

The demoralization of higher
education in America, expertly
scored and orchestrated, moves
along with Wagnerian continui
ty. Who turns up as an organizer
of the putsch on the Stanford
campus but Steve Weissman
This apparently perennial stu
dent was disrupting the Univer
sity of California while a "teach
ing assistant" as far back as
1964. He was inciting tumult in
the streets of San Francisco in
1965, and had established his rec
ord as a convicted and jailed
troublemaker long before Stan
ford took him on board as a
graduate student.
Before Stanford was selected
as the next focus of his atten
tion, he had been on a nation
wide tour with Mario Savio to
prove his dedication to campus
turmoil.
Imbalance
Stanford, a private institution,
was no more obligated to en
roll Steve Weissman than it
would Fidel Castro. But for some

imbalance in the administration
