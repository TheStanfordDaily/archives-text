## Two Nuclear Reactors Here 
### FRIEDRICH ABEL 
A woman was on the phone.
"Can't you shut that thing off,"
she said heatedly. "There is a
hum in the air ... I suppose it
comes from you."
The angry lady was talking
with Prof. Rudolph Sher from
Stanford's nuclear engineering
division and she remained skep
tical about his explanation that
nuclear reactors are very quiet
things.
Stanford has had one pool
type nuclear reactor and a
subcritical assembly for ten
years now. Both are housed In
a 60-foot high steel construc
tion "barn," the Ryan Lab, on
the east side of Stanford Ave
nue behind the Pine Hill fac
ulty homes.
The "pool" is a 20-foot high
concrete silo rising in the center
of the lab's huge hall.
Entering through a series of
smaller laboratories packed with
a confusing variety of control
panels, tubes, and other research
facilities, one walks up a spiral
stairway leading to the top of
the fission reactor.
Gazing down upon the fission
elements at the bottom of the
lighted, water filled cylinder is
like looking at a sunken trea
sure ship through a submarine's
bull eye.
Three and a half kilograms
of enriched uranium 235, alloyed
with aluminum, glitter silvery in
a box-like container.
There are steel handling arms,
cylinders for introducing experi
mental equipment into the re
actor, and a horizontal tube to
lead the neutron beam to mea
suring devices.
Neutrons keep the fuel
burning' in a nuclear reactor
like oxygen feeds the flames
in a coal fired oven, explained
Prof. T. J. Connelly, director
of the nuclear engineering
division.
During the "Igniting period"
of a chain reaction neutrons are
emitted from an artificial source.
Travelling towards solid urani
um bars, some of them are ab
sorbed by uranium nuclei.
In this case the nuclei split
into two halves and heat is pro
duced, Connolly said.
The splitting nuclei also eject
high-speed neutrons; because
some of these collide with other
uranium nuclei, one fission can
cause another, and another . . •

a chain reaction sets in, he ex
plained.
To increase the number of col
lisions the neutrons have to be
slowed down — which is usual
ly done with graphite.
The Stanford reactor uses wa
ter for this purpose, according
to Sher, who is in charge of sev
eral experimental programs in
nuclear and reactor physics.
The water moderator not
only renders visibility of all
processes — essentially for
teaching purposes—but also
shields and cools the reactor,
Sher added.
To regulate or to shut down a
chain reaction, boron blades can
be inserted into the uranium
pile. Because these blades ab
sorb neutrons strongly, the
build-up of further reactions is
discouraged, Sher said.
Stanford's reactor history be
gan in 1958 when a subcritical
nuclear assembly, powered by
two tons of natural uranium
worth $80,000, was established
in connection with an expansion
in the nuclear engineering pro
gram.
Such a subcritical assembly
cannot sustain a chain reaction,
Connolly pointed out.
Mainly because of the na
ture of the fuel (natural uran
ium contains less than one per
cent uranium 235), the chain
reactions shut itself down af
ter the artificial neutron
source is removed, he ex
plained.
This apparatus is ideal for in
struction because it requires no
controls and is safe at all times,
Connolly said.
"The students pile up the re
actor themselves," he said.
For this purpose uranium
slugs are put into metal rods
and placed in a large tank of
water. When not used the eight
inch rods are locked away in a
safety chamber.
When its fission reactor went
into operation in late 1959, the
nuclear division, administered
within the department of me
chanical engineering, became
really established.
Connolly emphasized that
the Stanford reactor serves

mainly as source of a neutron
beam and as a study object of
the fission processes Itself.
The actual power generation
of the reactor is minimal —ten
kilowatts, he said.
"Our mission is to develop
knowledge relevant to more ef
ficient design of fission reac
tors," Connolly said.
Presently, reactors are built
with a large margin of safety
in mind, because not enough is
known about all processes in
volved.
The final purpose of reactor
design studies is to decrease this
margin and thereby get more
power with less cost, Connolly
said.
One research project In this
direction Is a study of the ef
fect of radiation on boiling. As
an essential experimental tool
the department operates the
world's smallest bubble cham
ber, having a diameter of two
Inches.
In this tube water is kept
liquid by means of pressure up
to 2,000 psi; when the pressure
is released an unstable condition
exists and "radiation transfers
a tiny bit of water into vapor,"
Sher explained.
Another project called "Neu
tron Spectrum Measurements by
Foil Techniques" is hoped to
bring a breakthrough in mea
surement methodology, he said.
Completely new types of mea
surement are required in a fis
sion reactor in addition to the
conventional measurements of
pressure or temperature.
"For example, it became nec
essary to determine the energies
of neutrons in a reactor," Sher
said.
To satisfy this need, the divi
sion is just now perfecting a
technique in which a few select
ed materials, like gold, are
placed into the reactor. From
the radioactivity induced in
these materials they can infer
the neutron energy distribution
in the reactor, Sher said.
Several other projects are
presently carried out at the
laboratory, ranging from
something called "Direct Con
version of Fission Energy to

Electrical Energy" to "Dop
pler Effect Measurements."
In connection with the doppler
effect measurements the division
attempts to establish design cri
teria for a power reactor which
shuts itself off before it runs
out of control.
There is a certain effect of
temperature on the reaction rate
between nuclei and neutrons,
Sher said. In the relative mo
tion between nuclei and neu
trons the nuclei pick up speed
if the temperature is increased,
he said.
At some point the fission reac
tion is broken: to determine the
control factors of this breaking
of the chain the type and shape
of uranium, together with other
components, are varied in the ex
periments, Sher said.
Could the fission reactor by
accident become dangerous to
the Stanford community?
No, Connolly said. The reactor
has a number of built-in safe
guards to prevent a "runaway"
chain reaction.
Even if all saieguards were
removed and the reactor ran un
controlled, no damage could re
sult except perhaps to the in
terior of the reactor itself, he
said.
