# New Drug Law Questioned By Campus Administration
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (CPS) — Col
lege administrators seem ex
tremely concerned about the im
pact of the new drug laws on
the independence of their insti
tutions. But they don't seem to
be doing much about it.
The thing that worries the ad
ministrators most is the pres
ence of narcotics agents, who
often pose as students. In a CPS
survey of 39 colleges, 14 cam
pus editors were sure there were
narcotics agents on their cam
puses, nine didn't know, and
only six were sure that there
weren't.
Most of the on-campus busts,
including those at Stoneybrook,
Bard, and American, came after
investigation by undercover
agents on the campus. A Vassar
college professor recently attack
ed the use of narcotics agents on
that campus.
The other big problem admini
strators face is whether to co
operate with narcotics agents
when they are contacted for in
formation or assistance. Most
of them have decided to coop
erate, and many have gone so
far as to help police pose as
students.

Most administrations have no
qualms about what to do if a
student is arrested or found
using marijuana; he is kicked
out. At Brigham Young Univer
sity, for example, any student
who is arrested is automatically
suspended from the university
even if he is later acquitted.
Such supposedly liberal institu
tions as Haverford College in
Pennsylvania will suspend a stu
dent for drug use.
Despite the "reign of terror"
in legislative investigations and
criticism of the administration
that has followed the Stoney
brook bust, the community cri
ticism that has fallen on schools
like Bard and Franconia Col
leges, and the widespread fear
of more busts at schools that
have already had some, admini
strators don't seem to be taking
any action.
Part of the problem is that
they don't know what to do. Most
of them feel obligated to co-op
erate with the authorities, yet
they want to avoid the bad pub
licity and accompanying prob
lems of a bust on their cam
puses.
One possible answer to their

dilemma was proposed in the
April issue of Trans-Action mag
azine by Northwest University
sociologist Howard Becker. Beck
er proposes that university ad
ministrations try to educate stu
dents to avoid getting caught.
He says:
"If an educational program of
this kind . . . were started on a
campus, and if students took
their lessons seriously, many
fewer might engage in those ac
tions likely to provoke arrest or
detection. There would be fewer
incidents to make publicity
about, fewer incidents for the
administration to respond to. The
administration no doubt would
still be aware that students were
using drugs on campus, but it
would not be required to re
spond."


A DIFFERENT APPROACH — One of the participants in last
year's Hydrafollles show entertained spectators with his unusual
technique. This year's Hydrafollles and the carnival bring to an
end the student charity drive, Con-Home Week.
