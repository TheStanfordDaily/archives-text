# Biz School Studies Use Of Marijuana
## 
### 
Between 20 and 30 percent of
the students in the Graduate
School of Business at Stanford
have tried marijuana, a student
poll indicates.
(An earlier, University-wide
cross-section study showed about
one in five students had tried
it.)
Among those who had tried
marijuana, almost four out of
10 (38 percent) said they no
longer use it.
"Most of those who had tried
marijuana had done so for the
first time quite recently," ac
cording to a report written by
Barry Krantz in the Business
School Reporter, a student news
paper.
One-third of those who had
tried marijuana did so for the
first time between September
1967 and February 1968, when
the survey was circulated.
About a quarter of the mari
juana users said they expected
to try stronger drugs, while a
quarter of the non-users indi
cated a desire to try marijuana.
There were no significant cor
relations between family in
come, home location, class with
in the School, or regularity of al
cohol consumption and mariju
ana use.
None of those over 30 respond
ing to the survey said they had
tried marijuana, and usage was
much lower among married stu
dents (12 percent) than single
students (43 percent).

Students with a technical back
ground reported far less usage
(24 percent) than those with
non-technical backgrounds (34
percent).
Students who were dependent
on their parents for financial
support showed a greater inci
dence of usage than those who
were independent, a finding
which may reflect lower usage
among older and married stu
dents.
About two-thirds of the 19 re
spondents who called themselves
"left wing" politically had tried
marijuana, but none of those
who described themselves as
right-wing had done so.
"This study proves nothing,
but is nevertheless enlighten
ing," Krantz said. "We as a stu
dent body, turned out to be a
valid reflection of our society
and our times.
"If usage is as high as this
study indicates, the social and
legal implications for the future
are quite relevant."
In all, two-thirds of those ask
ed to respond to a mail question
naire did so. Among the respond
ents, 30 percent said they had
tried marijuana at least once.
Krantz said the most likely bias
would be to overstate use, so the
figures should be taken "only as
approximations." Even if all
those who failed to return the
questionnaire had never tried
marijuana, the proportion of
users would be 20 percent.
