## Ghetto 's Business Debated 
### 
A white speaker suggested
that business go into the ghetto
and a black speaker suggested
that business stay out of the
ghetto at a Stanford Graduate
School of Business Conference
Wednesday.
The speakers were Prof. David
Abernathy of Stanford's Depart
ment of Political Science and
Henry Organ, Lockheed psycho
logist and community action co
ordinator in East Palo Alto.
The two men were the keynote
speakers a student-sponsored
"Urban Crisis" conference.
Prof. Abernathy offered three
options to the future business
men who attended the opening
session in Bishop Auditorium;
1. for white businessmen to ex
tract talent from the ghetto and
train them for employment in
white business and industry;
2. locate industrial branches in
the ghetto and create local em
ployment; and

3. "decolonize" the ghetto by
nationalizing homes, flats, stores
and industry and turning it over
to all-black operation.

Organ, on the other hand,
emphasized that the School's
future businessman and mam
agers "had better be debriefed"
on the equal employment op
portunity shibboleth because
the Negroes know it as "Just
another of The Man's lies" If
it isn't made to mean some
thing.
"Racial discrimination exists
in employment because someone
underwrites it," Organ told the
group of 100 students. "Black
people cannot survive economic
ally if every consumer does not
become aware of whether black
people are used in the manu
facture of every product."
Organ explained that display
ing an "equal opportunity" stick
er doesn't mean that you have
to hire blacks; "all you have to
do is offer, so as to cleanse the
image of industry."
He urged that industry go
Into the streets and hire black
employees, rather than wait
for them to come in. Most im
portant, big industry, govern
ment and institutions must In

sist that their subcontractors
hire proportional Negro help
as well and make this require
ment integral in any contract
signed.
"Just a change in (white) be
havior is all that's needed," Or
gan told the group. "It occurs
instantly and is easier to mea
sure. You must work toward the
day when employment is color
less and Is based on ability
alone."
Prof. Abernathy acknowledged
that his three suggested options
to ease the urban crisis would
be fraught with difficulties, in
cluding additional expenses to
the businessman because of ad
ditional in-service training, trans
portation costs, tension between
white and black workers, and
major political difficulties, especi
ally in the "decolonization"
phase.
He suggested that possibly the
best solution would be for "ne
gotiation sessions" between
white and black businessmen —
"preferably in a tenement, so
you can see it like it is" — so
that both sides can get together
and work out a viable program
"based on equality and mutual
self-interest."
"Any of these sessions," he
said, "should include members of
the Black Panther movement,
who might well emerge as ju
nior executives. This might work
because nothing else has."

"Any of these sessions," he
said, "should include members of
the Black Panther movement,
who might well emerge as ju
nior executives. This might work
because nothing else has."
A white speaker suggested
that business go into the ghetto
and a black speaker suggested
that business stay out of the
ghetto at a Stanford Graduate
School of Business Conference
Wednesday.
The speakers were Prof. David
Abernathy of Stanford's Depart
ment of Political Science and
Henry Organ, Lockheed psycho
logist and community action co
ordinator in East Palo Alto.
The two men were the keynote
speakers a student-sponsored
"Urban Crisis" conference.
Prof. Abernathy offered three
options to the future business
men who attended the opening
session in Bishop Auditorium;
1. for white businessmen to ex
tract talent from the ghetto and
train them for employment in
white business and industry;
2. locate industrial branches in
the ghetto and create local em
ployment; and

3. "decolonize" the ghetto by
nationalizing homes, flats, stores
and industry and turning it over
to all-black operation.

Organ, on the other hand,
emphasized that the School's
future businessman and mam
agers "had better be debriefed"
on the equal employment op
portunity shibboleth because
the Negroes know it as "Just
another of The Man's lies" If
it isn't made to mean some
thing.
"Racial discrimination exists
in employment because someone
underwrites it," Organ told the
group of 100 students. "Black
people cannot survive economic
ally if every consumer does not
become aware of whether black
people are used in the manu
facture of every product."
Organ explained that display
ing an "equal opportunity" stick
er doesn't mean that you have
to hire blacks; "all you have to
do is offer, so as to cleanse the
image of industry."
He urged that industry go
Into the streets and hire black
employees, rather than wait
for them to come in. Most im
portant, big industry, govern
ment and institutions must In

sist that their subcontractors
hire proportional Negro help
as well and make this require
ment integral in any contract
signed.
"Just a change in (white) be
havior is all that's needed," Or
gan told the group. "It occurs
instantly and is easier to mea
sure. You must work toward the
day when employment is color
less and Is based on ability
alone."
Prof. Abernathy acknowledged
that his three suggested options
to ease the urban crisis would
be fraught with difficulties, in
cluding additional expenses to
the businessman because of ad
ditional in-service training, trans
portation costs, tension between
white and black workers, and
major political difficulties, especi
ally in the "decolonization"
phase.
He suggested that possibly the
best solution would be for "ne
gotiation sessions" between
white and black businessmen —
"preferably in a tenement, so
you can see it like it is" — so
that both sides can get together
and work out a viable program
"based on equality and mutual
self-interest."

said, "should include members of
