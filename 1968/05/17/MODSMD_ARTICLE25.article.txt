# Bay Residents Refuse To Pay Telephone Tax
## 
### 
Several hundred people in the
Stanford - Palo Alto Area have
"hung up" on the Vietnam war.
Forty of them gathered Mon
day at the Cowper St. office of
the Pacific Telephone Co. to pub
licly refuse to pay the 10 per
cent federal excise tax on their
current phone bills, a tax which
they say was imposed to offset
the cost of escalating the U.S.
war effort in Vietnam.
They are part of a nation
wide war tax refusal move
ment now numbering over 5,-
000. Similar demonstrations
were held concurrently in
three other Bay Area cities â€”
San Francisco, Oakland, and
San Jose.
Those who refused to pay their
May tax were asked to donate
the amount of the tax to the
"Poor Peoples' Campaign."
David Gast, a Stanford student
and local organizer for the
SCLC march on Washington, ac
cepted $128.26 in unpaid phone
taxes diverted from war to meet
the needs of the poor.
War Resisters League, nation
wide co-ordinator of the tax re
fusal movement, says that the
telephone company passes along
the names of those who refuse
the tax to the Internal Reve*

nue Service (IRS).
Several faculty, staff, and
teaching assistants at Stanford
have had the money taken from
their paychecks as the result of
IRS action. The League esti
mates that it costs the IRS $50
to collect from each refuser,
though the amounts collected
are seldom over $5.
Those without personal phone
service have participated also.
Some students at Bard College
in Red Hook, N.Y. have dis
covered that even after telling
the operator that they will not
pay the tax, they are able to
make long distance calls from
coin phones.
The anti-war group regards
the refusal of this tax as a
small act of civil disobedience
that entails little risk. No one
has yet had his phone discon
nected, and refusers carefully
enlose letters with their bills
pointing out that they are re
sisting the tax, not evading itJ,
Already the impact has been
felt in Washington, where the
IRS recently issued orders to
"streamline" the collection pro
cedure by eliminating the right
of each refuser to meet per
sonally with an IRS representa
tive to discuss the issue.
