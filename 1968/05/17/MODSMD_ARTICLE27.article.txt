# Committee Accuses SDS Of Communism, Riot Aid
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (CPS) — The
House Committee on Un-Ameri
can Activities has accused sev
eral groups which it calls Com
munist influenced, including Stu
dents for a Democratic Society,
of laying the groundwork for
guerrilla warfare in the United
States.
The committee also makes
proposals for putting down
guerrilla uprisings. One rec
ommendation is that "most
civil liberties would have to
be suspended, search and sei
zure operations would be Insti
tuted during the daylight
hours, and anyone found arm
ed or without proper identifi
cation would be immediately
arrested."
HUAC charges that guerrilla
oriented groups are actively
working to create riot conditions
in the nation's cities. "The guer
rilla warfare advocates see furth
er massive rioting as laying the
groundwork for guerrilla war
fare," the report says.
Among the groups encourag
ing a guerrilla war in the United
States, according to the HUAC
report, are SDS, the Revolution
ary Action Committee (RAM),
the Progressive Labor Party, the
New York-based Revolutionary
Contingent, the Student Non-
Violent Coordinating Committee,
and the W.E.B. Dußois Clubs.
In his introduction to the re
port, Rep. Edwin W. Willis (D-
La.), HUAC chairman, says the
"committee has received testi
mony indicating that agents of
North Vietnam have trained
some Americans in guerrilla
warfare in Cuba."
The report draws a strong

link between the black nation
alist movement and the possi
bility of a future guerrilla war
in this country. The Commu
nist Party in the U.S., the re
port says, supports Negro vio
lence and rioting, but is op
posed to the launching of guer
rilla warfare operations at this
time, holding that conditions
are not ripe for success.
In its discussion of guerrilla
warfare advocates, HUAC says,
"Key leaders of the Students for
a Democratic Society (SDS)
have given open support to guer

rilla warfare in the United
States. SDS, generally rocoio
nized as the leading 'new left'
student organization, is openly
radical and leftist." The report
specifically mentions former SDS
president Tom Hayden as an ad
vocate of guerrilla force in ur
ban areas.
The HUAC report was largely
written by Phillip Abbott Luce, a
former member of the Progres
sive Labor Party who defected
several years ago. In recent
years, Luce has been one of
HUAC's main informers.

are not ripe for success.
In its discussion of guerrilla
warfare advocates, HUAC says,
"Key leaders of the Students for
a Democratic Society (SDS)
have given open support to guer

rilla warfare in the United
States. SDS, generally rocoio
nized as the leading 'new left'
student organization, is openly
radical and leftist." The report
specifically mentions former SDS
president Tom Hayden as an ad
vocate of guerrilla force in ur
ban areas.
The HUAC report was largely
written by Phillip Abbott Luce, a
former member of the Progres
sive Labor Party who defected
several years ago. In recent
years, Luce has been one of
HUAC's main informers.
WASHINGTON (CPS) — The
House Committee on Un-Ameri
can Activities has accused sev
eral groups which it calls Com
munist influenced, including Stu
dents for a Democratic Society,
of laying the groundwork for
guerrilla warfare in the United
States.
The committee also makes
proposals for putting down
guerrilla uprisings. One rec
ommendation is that "most
civil liberties would have to
be suspended, search and sei
zure operations would be Insti
tuted during the daylight
hours, and anyone found arm
ed or without proper identifi
cation would be immediately
arrested."
HUAC charges that guerrilla
oriented groups are actively
working to create riot conditions
in the nation's cities. "The guer
rilla warfare advocates see furth
er massive rioting as laying the
groundwork for guerrilla war
fare," the report says.
Among the groups encourag
ing a guerrilla war in the United
States, according to the HUAC
report, are SDS, the Revolution
ary Action Committee (RAM),
the Progressive Labor Party, the
New York-based Revolutionary
Contingent, the Student Non-
Violent Coordinating Committee,
and the W.E.B. Dußois Clubs.
In his introduction to the re
port, Rep. Edwin W. Willis (D-
La.), HUAC chairman, says the
"committee has received testi
mony indicating that agents of
North Vietnam have trained
some Americans in guerrilla
warfare in Cuba."
The report draws a strong

link between the black nation
alist movement and the possi
bility of a future guerrilla war
in this country. The Commu
nist Party in the U.S., the re
port says, supports Negro vio
lence and rioting, but is op
posed to the launching of guer
rilla warfare operations at this
time, holding that conditions
are not ripe for success.
