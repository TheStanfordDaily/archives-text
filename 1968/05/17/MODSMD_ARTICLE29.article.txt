## USC-Stanford Playoff? 
### Gary Cavalli 
The ruling to uphold USC's protest of the Stanford-Trojan base
ball game several weeks ago looms as a bigger factor in the Pacific
-8 pennant rape each day. Rather than having the game replayed
from the point of the protest, the conference rules commission
decided the game would be considered a tie, thus nullifying any
chance Stanford might have to pick up a game on the league
leading Troy nine.
Currently USC rests atop the Pac-8 heap with a two-and-a-half
game lead over second-place Stanford. With no future encounters
between the two teams, the Tribe is forced to rely on another
club to dump the Trojans twice and bring about a tie for the top
spot.
In the past week there has been much speculation as to what
would happen should USC lose two games while the Indians go
through the remainder of their schedule undefeated, leaving
both teams tied with identical 173 records. Would USC be de
clared the winner on the basis of having beaten Stanford twice
during the season, would a playoff result, or would the protested
game finally be played to its conclusion?
Bob Sprenger, Pac-8 Publicity Director, cleared the matter up for
us yesterday. According to league rules, which were drawn up
by the baseball coaches themselves, any suspended (protested),
postponed or delayed game is ruled a tie, unless (1) both coaches
are in agreement to finish the game, or (2) the game has a bear
ing on the league championship. Should two teams tie for the
title, the winner is not determined on the basis of who wins the
series played between the two teams tied for first —a playoff is held.
What this means in terms of this year's race is the following:
If Stanford and USC finish in a tie, then the team's coaches
would have to determine whether to decide the championship
In a playoff game, or simply complete the protested game and
settle things that way. In any case, the Trojans would not be
declared the champs simply because they won the season's series
with Stanford.
Of course all of this speculation and rule consulting will be for
naught unless USC is defeated twice before the end of the season
and the Indians win all their remaining games. The Trojans have
seven remaining contests and the Tribe has eight, but both teams
go north this weekend for six games in a five-day span. Stanford
has the pitching depth to endure this grueling schedule — USC
does not. Look for the Trojans to loose at least once during the six
game road trip.

In a playoff game, or simply complete the protested game and
settle things that way. In any case, the Trojans would not be
declared the champs simply because they won the season's series
with Stanford.
Of course all of this speculation and rule consulting will be for
naught unless USC is defeated twice before the end of the season
and the Indians win all their remaining games. The Trojans have
seven remaining contests and the Tribe has eight, but both teams
go north this weekend for six games in a five-day span. Stanford
has the pitching depth to endure this grueling schedule — USC
does not. Look for the Trojans to loose at least once during the six
game road trip.
The ruling to uphold USC's protest of the Stanford-Trojan base
ball game several weeks ago looms as a bigger factor in the Pacific
-8 pennant rape each day. Rather than having the game replayed
from the point of the protest, the conference rules commission
decided the game would be considered a tie, thus nullifying any
chance Stanford might have to pick up a game on the league
leading Troy nine.
Currently USC rests atop the Pac-8 heap with a two-and-a-half
game lead over second-place Stanford. With no future encounters
between the two teams, the Tribe is forced to rely on another
club to dump the Trojans twice and bring about a tie for the top
spot.
In the past week there has been much speculation as to what
would happen should USC lose two games while the Indians go
through the remainder of their schedule undefeated, leaving
both teams tied with identical 173 records. Would USC be de
clared the winner on the basis of having beaten Stanford twice
during the season, would a playoff result, or would the protested
game finally be played to its conclusion?
Bob Sprenger, Pac-8 Publicity Director, cleared the matter up for
us yesterday. According to league rules, which were drawn up
by the baseball coaches themselves, any suspended (protested),
postponed or delayed game is ruled a tie, unless (1) both coaches
are in agreement to finish the game, or (2) the game has a bear
ing on the league championship. Should two teams tie for the
title, the winner is not determined on the basis of who wins the
series played between the two teams tied for first —a playoff is held.
What this means in terms of this year's race is the following:
If Stanford and USC finish in a tie, then the team's coaches
would have to determine whether to decide the championship
