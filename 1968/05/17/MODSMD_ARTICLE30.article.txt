# Unbeaten Indians Meet Veteran Paly Stickmen
## 
### 
The Stanford lacrosse team re
turns to league action this week
end against the Palo Alto La
crosse Club on Saturday and the
Marin County Lacrosse Club
Sunday. Both games will be at
Stanford.
Victory over Palo Alto will
sew up the league title for the
second straight year for the Big
Red. The Indians beat the Palo
Alto Club earlier ill the year by
a 5-4 count.
Palo Alto coach Rod Palni
borg: feels that his team of
veterans will be able to knock
off the undefeated Stanford
team. He hails the return of
former All-American attack
man Bruce Lloyd to the line
up.
In their first pre-game power
play, the Palo Alto Club de-

ployed their status as adults and
got a league ruling that the
Stanford game will have only
twelve-minute quarters instead
of the customary fifteen min
utes.
The Indians have laughed
and yawned alternately In re
ply to the Palo Alto maneuver.
"We play lacrosse on the field,
not in smoke-filled rooms," re
marked one team member. "It
doesn't make any difference
how many minutes you play
when you're outrun from the
start," another has said. The
Indians hope to run the cross
town rivals completely off the
field.
The Marin Club has been the
tough-luck outfit in the NCLA
this year. They could only stop
the Red by an incredible upset.
