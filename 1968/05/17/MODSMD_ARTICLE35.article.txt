HOT BAT — Co-captain Bob Boone, shown here batting against
UCLA, has lifted his batting average from .236 to .300 since April
23 in a phenomenal hitting surge. Boone, the Tribe's cleanup hit
ter, holds the team lead in RBl's with 32. Continued clutch hitting
by the junior third-baseman will be needed if the Indians are to
sweep the six-game road trip beginning today at Oregon. Harvey
Shanke will probably hurl for Stanford at Corvallis today, with
Rod Poteete and Don Rose expected to get the call for tomorrow's
doubleheader at Oregon. The Indians meet Washington State in
another twin bill Monday, then wind up the northern tour with a
single game at Washington Tuesday.
