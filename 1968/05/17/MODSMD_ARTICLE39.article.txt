## 'Carnival' 
### DENA DAWSON 
Carnival, Ram's Heads' third
production this academic year,
contains all the requisite ingre
dients for successful musical
comedy: romantic, comic young
lovers and comic songs, pretty
girls, handsome boys, exuberant
dances, hummable tunes and a
story which exists to connect,
the songs and dances and to
bring all the lovers together at
the end. It is, of course, purely
functional, and should never be
taken seriously.
Carnival is one of the newer
"serious" musicals giving us
just enough of a look at the ugly
and the sordid to make the out
come that much more gratify
ing.
Stephanie Kelvin and Bill
Graham both achieved remark
ably well organized and lively
«lan<« and chorus numbers.
The four young men who play
the Roustabouts were particu
larly dynamic, as were the
gorgeously ghastly Bluebird
Girls.
This high-spirited college mu
sical completely shifts to anoth
er area of theatrical experience
with the first entrance of Pieter
van Niel as Paul, the tormented
puppeteer. The depth and inten
sity of his performance as well
as his beautiful voice made the
awfulness of the dialogue and
lyrics unimportant.
His partner, Jacquot, was
given a quiet, sensitive portrayal
by Stan Rutherford, (Stanford's
own Wumberlog) whose comic
talent was used to full advan
tage in his hilarious puppets—
Marguerite, the snooty prima
donna and her friend Renardo,
the amorous rake.

Charlie Edelman gave yet an
other of his famous cameo roles
in the Yiddish tradition. As the
weary, harassed, penny-pinching
circus owner Schlegel, Edelman,
although occasionally low in
audibility, had many of the best
comic moments.
Gretchen Grant as Lili pro
jects a great deal of personal
charm and vitality into the role.
Occasionally she appeared far
too self-assured and confident
for plausibility, but was none
theless quite captivating. Aileen
Robbins, who will sing Lili in
the matinee, while not as pol
ished an actress as Miss Grant,
has the advantage of a strong
pleasing voice and a somewhat
more youthful manner.
Lucille Medalis was a wry,
yet strangely Innocent Rosa
lie, in spite of her
and brassy vulgarity. A very
funny characterization but
perhaps a little too auhdued
or held back. Sergei Tschern-
Lsch as Marco, the sinister se
ducer, was badly miscast. He
was too bouncy, wholesome
and kind, to be an oily, profes
sional spoiler of virgins.
The director, Bob Morgan, was
in the unenviable position of hav
ing to choosc either actors who
could fake singing or singers
who could act acceptably. Mr.
Morgan decided on actors, with
some unfortunate results.
In the overall production, the
director's hand was conspicuous
ly absent, especially in terms of
arrangement of the stage pic
ture. Most of the time, the focus
of our attention was diverted
from an important action by un
necessary movement among the
minor characters, by poor place
ment of major characters, or by
the overcrowded, messy stage.
Don Cate's design and Regina
Cate's costumes concentrate on
the ugly reality principle—never
is there any doubt that this is,
in fact, a run-down, sleazy, third
rate circus. There is, however, a
design problem—the sleazy is an
attempt at elegance using shod
dy materials. The sets and cos
tumes were too deliberate — a
sort of self-conscious sleaziness
which is for me, at any rate, a
contradiction. The orchestra, on
the other hand, accomplished
this level quite effortlessly.
The puppet scenes are the fin
est scenes in the show—charm
ing, tender, and delightfully but
sadly funny. Paul's confession of
love to Lili via the puppets is
guaranteed to make every per
son in the audience choke up.
Anyone who doesn't is made of
stone, and that's all there is to
it. Wiping the steam off my
glasses, I can only say—"they're
beautiful." Pieter van Neil is
great, and for the love of escap
ism, go to see it.

Lucille Medalis was a wry,
yet strangely Innocent Rosa
lie, in spite of her
and brassy vulgarity. A very
funny characterization but
perhaps a little too auhdued
or held back. Sergei Tschern-
Lsch as Marco, the sinister se
ducer, was badly miscast. He
was too bouncy, wholesome
and kind, to be an oily, profes
sional spoiler of virgins.
The director, Bob Morgan, was
in the unenviable position of hav
ing to choosc either actors who
could fake singing or singers
who could act acceptably. Mr.
Morgan decided on actors, with
some unfortunate results.
In the overall production, the
director's hand was conspicuous
ly absent, especially in terms of
arrangement of the stage pic
ture. Most of the time, the focus
of our attention was diverted
from an important action by un
necessary movement among the
minor characters, by poor place
ment of major characters, or by
the overcrowded, messy stage.
Don Cate's design and Regina
Cate's costumes concentrate on
the ugly reality principle—never
is there any doubt that this is,
in fact, a run-down, sleazy, third
rate circus. There is, however, a
design problem—the sleazy is an
attempt at elegance using shod
dy materials. The sets and cos
tumes were too deliberate — a
sort of self-conscious sleaziness
which is for me, at any rate, a
contradiction. The orchestra, on
the other hand, accomplished
this level quite effortlessly.
The puppet scenes are the fin
est scenes in the show—charm
ing, tender, and delightfully but
sadly funny. Paul's confession of
love to Lili via the puppets is
guaranteed to make every per
son in the audience choke up.
Anyone who doesn't is made of
stone, and that's all there is to
it. Wiping the steam off my
glasses, I can only say—"they're
beautiful." Pieter van Neil is
great, and for the love of escap
ism, go to see it.

Carnival, Ram's Heads' third
production this academic year,
contains all the requisite ingre
dients for successful musical
comedy: romantic, comic young
lovers and comic songs, pretty
girls, handsome boys, exuberant
dances, hummable tunes and a
story which exists to connect,
the songs and dances and to
bring all the lovers together at
the end. It is, of course, purely
functional, and should never be
taken seriously.
Carnival is one of the newer
"serious" musicals giving us
just enough of a look at the ugly
and the sordid to make the out
come that much more gratify
ing.
Stephanie Kelvin and Bill
Graham both achieved remark
ably well organized and lively
«lan<« and chorus numbers.
The four young men who play
the Roustabouts were particu
larly dynamic, as were the
gorgeously ghastly Bluebird
Girls.
This high-spirited college mu
sical completely shifts to anoth
er area of theatrical experience
with the first entrance of Pieter
van Niel as Paul, the tormented
puppeteer. The depth and inten
sity of his performance as well
as his beautiful voice made the
awfulness of the dialogue and
lyrics unimportant.
His partner, Jacquot, was
given a quiet, sensitive portrayal
by Stan Rutherford, (Stanford's
own Wumberlog) whose comic
talent was used to full advan
tage in his hilarious puppets—
Marguerite, the snooty prima
donna and her friend Renardo,
the amorous rake.

Charlie Edelman gave yet an
other of his famous cameo roles
in the Yiddish tradition. As the
weary, harassed, penny-pinching
circus owner Schlegel, Edelman,
although occasionally low in
audibility, had many of the best
comic moments.
Gretchen Grant as Lili pro
jects a great deal of personal
charm and vitality into the role.
Occasionally she appeared far
too self-assured and confident
for plausibility, but was none
theless quite captivating. Aileen
Robbins, who will sing Lili in
the matinee, while not as pol
ished an actress as Miss Grant,
has the advantage of a strong
pleasing voice and a somewhat
more youthful manner.
