PARIS (AP) —The U.S. dele

talks will lead to a break in the

North Vietnamese Thursday
night as using a stony, uncom

probing for possible agreement.
With preliminary peace talks
in a two-day recess until Satur
day, the chief U.S. negotiator,
Ambassador W. Averell Harri

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The
Rev. Ralph David Abemathy,

in Southern California, endorsed
the creation of jobs, not a guar

means to bring an end to pov

Abernathy said he agreed
with Kennedy that jobs are
needed, but the Negro leader
said a guaranteed wage would

provide for those too young,
too old or unable to work who
"are also entitled to the right

The Rev. John P. Raynor,
president of Marquette, said
earlier Thursday that the school
"will not be governed by coer

NEW YORK (AP) _ A re

by Dr. Sheldon J. Segal, has
tested the capsule on rabbits
and rats for the past two years,

Such a capsule, it is believed,
