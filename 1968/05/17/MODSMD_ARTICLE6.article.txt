professorial chairs as a part of
the Institute itself; hiring a pro

The group feels the urban

that there is an urgent need
for change. The group notes
there are other institutes at
Stanford that are involved in
planning and research in oth
er important fields and that
urban development should be
included among these.
At a,meeting -'of graduate stu
dents, who wrote the? let
ter, two major goals were
agreed upon. The first was to
"institute a comprehensive se
lection of courses on urban
problems" and the other was to
"initiate direct action assistance
programs in the peninsula's ur
ban areas."
Consequently, they are form
ing an ad hoc committee of

plans for the institute. The
first objectives are to coordi
nate and publicize existing
courses and to direct action
programs related to urban af
fairs ; develop a planned series
of speakers and workshops on
urban problems for next year;
and establish a financial re
