# Law Students Criticize Inflexible Curriculum
## 
### DAN SNELL 
In public meetings yesterday
about 110 law students lit into
the present curriculum in the
law school, and many suggested
radical changes in the course of
study — mainly in the direction
of increased flexibility.
In an afternoon meeting
School of Law Dean Bayless
Manning, perched on a desk in
the school's large lecture hall,
suggested the students form
whatever structures they think
necessary to get student opinion
to the faculty.
Calling the morning meeting
he attended "seriously and im
pressively conducted," Manning
said, "The times are pregnant
and change is in the wind."
He referred to a recent speech
he gave at a Chicago convention
of lawyers in which he lambast
ed lawyers for not caring about
the future of their profession.
Manning said the law faculty
would be conducting "an overall
review" of the school and he
plans to consult students for
their views.
"I'm very serious about this,"
he said. "For me this is a very
serious topic."
The dean asserted that he
himself could not change the
school's curriculum. The whole
27-meniber faculty would have
to vote on any changes.
Peter Schilla, a second-year
student in the three-year LL.B.
program, chaired both the morn
ing and late afternoon meetings.
In the morning meeting, at
other professors, several stu

tended by Manning and about
ten other professors, several stu
dents questioned whether the
School of Law curriculum caused
future lawyers to analyse the
social causes and results of the
law. As one said, "There is no
discussion here of the basic in
stitutions of our society."
Another said the law school
was training legal technicians
who, "know how to drive the
truck ,but not where it's going."
Discussion was calm, and stu
dents seemed to agree with one
of their number who said he
rejected "use of any sort of con
frontation tactics on the fac
ulty."
A third-year student said,
"I think it Is a reasonable re
quest to make of the faculty
that students have some sub
stantial voice in what gets
taught and who teaches it."
One student presented propos
als to abolish lectures and the
case system of law study and
to institute a program of two
to four hours of seminar-style
classes each week, with the rest
of a student's time being given
over to individual research and
field work.
Another group which had met
the night before proposed new
courses to be given in the school
— comparative international law,
an anthropological approach to
law, an extension of the present
consumer protection seminar,
racism and the law, Selective Ser
vice law, and behavioral science
methodology.
The group also suggested that

credit be given for summer work
in law firms or various com
munity action and service proj
ects.
But the student meeting could
not decide yesterday whether
these proposals were acceptable
or exactly how the students
should organize themselves. Fi
nally students voted to accept
a motion that called for stu
dent participation in the deci
sion-making processes, without
specifying as yet the details of
how this should be done.
They will meet again In
the large lecture hall In the
School of Law at 12: IS today.
Answering questions from the
floor after his presentation,
Manning rejected a suggestion
that the construction of the new
law building, to be located be
tween the Post Office and Cam
pus Drive, be stopped until a
new curriculum is formulated.
"I can't think of any reason
why to stop plans on the build
ing. ... It has been planned
with a high degree of flexibility
to accommodate change," he
said.
Manning said he saw no rea
son why student proposals for
changes in the curriculum
could not come up for consider
ation so that they could be im
plemented next fall.
But he would not commit him
self to champion student sug
gestions before the faculty or
to push for student represen
tation on faculty committees.
He promised, nonetheless,
that student proposals when
formulated would "not be bur*
led In the committees," as one
student put It.
Since having come to Stanford
from Yale in 1964, Manning has
had a large part in remaking
the School of Law, now regard
ed by many observers as one
of the best in the country.
There was division among the
students as to whether the school
should specialize in a particular
phase of the law like law for the
poor. But most supported giv
ing law students more choice in
their curriculum.
Now first-year courses are all
prescribed for all LL.B. candi
dates , while second-and third
year students may choose cour
ses from a number of elec
tives.
Contacted last night, Law
Prof. Marc Franklin said of the
student meetings, "Discussion is
always helpful I don't
think there are many among
the faculty who would say that
we have a perfect school."
