# New TMU Director Controversial At Cal
## 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON 
Tresidder Union's new direc
tor, Forrest Tregea, is coming
to Stanford after sharp dispute
with some student leaders in
volving his previous job at Ber
keley.
Tregea recently came under
bitter attack by the Cal Student
Senate for refusing to recognize
them as his employer. At Berke
ley Tregea was executive direc
tor of the Associated Students.
Prior to last December Tre
gea's official position at Cal
was that of an employee of the
senate, but Chancellor Roger

Heyns In December appointed
a new board to take over the
management of student finan
ces. Tregea accepted the Chan
cellor's move and was subse
quently attacked by both the
Daily Californlan and the stu
dent senate.
The senate attempted to fire
Tregea but failed to obtain the
necessary three-fourths vote.
Trogea had accepted the Stan
ford post two weeks before the
vote to fire him.
He was unanimously selected
by a student-faculty committee
from a field of eighteen candi
dates.
Ho was first interviewed by
three members of the search
committee at the beginning of
April in Chicago at the annual
meeting of the Association of
College Unions, International.
Tregea will serve as director
of Tresidder Memorial Union
and manager of the Faculty
Club.
He succeeds Chester Berry,
the Union director for the last
ten years, who has accepted the
post of executive secretary of
the Association of College Un
ions International.
Tregea has been executive
director of the Associated Stu
dents of the University of
California (ASUC) for eight
years and prior to that was
business manager of the Ber
keley campus. In the latter
position he was involved in the
planning and construction of
the Berkeley student union.
No successor for him has been
appointed by Berkeley officials.
Tregea speculated yesterday

that a new director would not
be appointed until the student
senate-Chancellor conflict has
been resolved.
Tregea's position at Berkeley
was somewhat similar to that of
the student financial manager at
Stanford. He was in charge of
disbursing all ASUC funds. At
Stanford Dean of Students Joel
Smith has the nominal power
over the disbursement of funds,
but in practice the student finan
cial manager has Jurisdiction.
The position of manager of
the Faculty Club will take 15
per cent of Tregea's time and
that portion of his salary will be
p->id by the club.
The search committee had
eight members Including two
students, Norton Batkin and
Peter Haas. It was chaired by
Halsey Royden, recently ap
pointed Dean of Humanities
and Sciences.
Batkin, Royden and physics
professor Mason Yearian formed
the subcommittee that Inter
viewed the candidates in Chica
go last month. They reported
that Tregea had not been on
their original list of candidates
because he had indicated he was
not interested.
However, after interviewing
the other candidates and Tregea
the group decided that Tregea
was a "good cut" above the oth
ers. He submitted his resigna
tion to Berkeley officials April
15 and his appointment was an
nounced by Stanford officials
May 5.

subcommittee was unani
mously approved by the Union

Tregea has been executive
director of the Associated Stu

Tregea speculated yesterday

that a new director would not

Tregea's position at Berkeley
was somewhat similar to that of
the student financial manager at
Stanford. He was in charge of
disbursing all ASUC funds. At
Stanford Dean of Students Joel
Smith has the nominal power
over the disbursement of funds,
but in practice the student finan

The position of manager of
the Faculty Club will take 15

that Tregea had not been on
