We Support Senator Robert F. Kennedy For The Democratic
Nomination For President Of The United States
Our next president must quickly conclude the Vietnam war and develop a new and more
relevant conception of our role in the world of today and tomorrow. Equally important, he must
be willing and able to direct extensive attention and resources to the problems of our minority
groups, our poor, and our cities.
Since 1965 Senator Kennedy has been offering a sensible and creative alternative to the
Administration's Vietnam policy. During the past eight years — in speeches, in his service as At
torney General, in his votes, and in legislation introduced in the Senate — he has demonstrated
a stronger understanding of this decade's minority, poverty, and urban problems than has
either of the other candidates. Because he has the confidence of the minority groups he can
best resolve the major domestic tension of our times. In short, he is the only candidate whose
record on both foreign and domestic problems warrants our wholehearted support.
There will be no deadlock at the 1968 Democratic convention. If Senator Kennedy stumbles
in the primaries, Hubert Humphrey will be nominated. Only if Senator Kennedy runs well in the
primaries is he likely to be the party's nominee.
California Democrats must use the primary to persuade the national convention to nominate
a man committed to a reasonable solution in Vietnam, and to creative resolution of problems
at home. A study of the record convinces us that Robert F. Kennedy is that man.
