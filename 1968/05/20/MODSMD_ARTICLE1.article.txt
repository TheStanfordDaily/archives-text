# Frosh English Modified, Western Civ May Follow
## 
### JOHN ALCORN 
Western Civilization and
Freshman English, the two
courses which virtually all 1200
freshmen are now taking, are
headed for big changes in the
future.
The freshman seminar pro
gram, now in its third year, will
continue next year basically un
changed.
Although History Professor
Paul Seaver, in charge of West
ern Civ, expects no drastic
changes in the program next
year, the course as it. exists now
may have disappeared by the
1969-70 school year.
Earlier this year the Western
Civ staff submitted a proposal
for reconstructuring the course
to the History Department, the
Committee of Humanities and
Sciences for Undergraduate Ed
ucation, and the Study of Educa
tion at Stanford (SES). All three
groups are now considering the
proposal.
The freshman English pro
gram, however, is not only un
dergoing considered changes,
but will be modified to a large
extent this September. The di
rector of the program, Prof.
Robert M. Polhemus, indicated
recently that incoming fresh
men will have the option to take

English as it was presented to
freshmen this year or to choose
one of three thematic English
courses.
One change in the freshman
seminar program next year will
be five new seminars taught by
"prominent members of the
local business and scientific com
munity." These seminars are
being made possible because of
a special grant awarded to the
program by a private donor.
Seaver pointed out that His
tory 1, 2 and 3 have been re
quired courses at Stanford since
the 1930'5.
The SES recently agreed to
send out a questionnaire to all
students now taking Civ before
the end of this quarter. The
questionnaire will collect stu
dent opinion on the course as it
is now and as it could be in the
future.
In its proposed the civ staff
suggested the course be re
oriented into several "thematic"
courses revolving around specif
ic periods or trends in history
instead of the general, all-en
compassing survey course now
offered.
Seaver, who claims "any
choice is better than no choice,"
asserted that the staff's main
complaint about the present pro

gram is the same as that of
most students: no real option to
deviate from the syllabus.
The staff, beside recom
mending that students be
given five units for each quar
ter of Civ, also suggested stu
dents be given an option to
drop the course during spring
quarter on the understanding
they will take some kind of
advanced history course some
time before they graduate.
Seaver commented that so far
his staff has encountered two
main objections to the proposal.
It can be argued, he said, that
there is really no point in having
required courses, period. If one
maintained this position, "there
would be no room for a re
quired Civ course," he re
marked.
The other objection is if the
course is not going to be the
same for everyone, why make
everyone take it? While Seaver
admitted the Civ staff feels the
course as it now stands is self
defeating, he added most Civ
instructors agree some kind of
general education in history is
a good thing ior college stu
dents.
In its recommendation, the
staff has tried to confront both
objetcions by presenting both

students and instructors with a
program of "required options"
—a very general requirement
which can be fulfilled by a num
ber of different courses.
No final decision can possibly
be implemented until a year
from this coming September.
Each of the three thematic
courses to 1m» offered by the
English Department will have
approximately seventy-five
students, who will be taught
by at least one professor and
three graduate teaching as
sistants. The courses will last
for two quarters, and students
will be given four uidts for
the fall quarter and five nnits
for winter quarter.
The course will consist of
large lecture groups which will
then divide into small seminars.
According to Polhemus, if next
year's program is successful,
freshman English may evolve
into about twelve such pro
grams. Instead of being re
quired to take one general En
glish course, freshmen will then
have the option to choose the
type of English they want to
take, very similar to the way the
Civ program may operate.
The thematic courses to be
offered in September will be:
Literature in Technology, Forms
of American Contemporary Lit
erature, and Writing: the Per
sonal Forms.
Another change now being
considered for the English re
quirement is replacing the pres
ent program with the option of
taking a one quarter, five unit,
intensive writing course. This
option may be offered during
the 1969-70 school year.
In discussing changes in the
freshman English program, Pol
hemus emphasized the primary
aims of the course: helping stu
dents write clearly, enabling
them to read literature with un
derstanding and appreciation,
generating intellectual excite*
ment, stimulating students to
think critically and seriously
about themselves and their
world, and, above all, helping
them realize the immense power
of language in determining their
lives. The main reason for
changing the course, he com
mented, would be to better ac
complish these aims.
This year there have been
sixty-three freshman seminars,
up from thirty-six two years
ago when the program was initi
ated and from forty-eight last
year. Mrs. Alfred Appel, head
of the program, has said that
the response "has very

Tli© program was organized
to give freshmen the oppor
tunity to meet professors in
informal surroundings, study
a subject of their own choice
in depth, and present unique,
interdisciplinary subjects not
usually found in Stanford's
regular curriculum. Several
such courses this year are:
Fiction and Politics, The Gro
tesque in Art and Literature,
and Literature and Theology.

The entire program was
supported by a private dona
tion when it began three years
ago. It met with such a tre
mendous response that when
the original funds ran out,
the University decided to con
tinue the program with its
own money.
Freshman education is already
radically different from what it
was only a few short years ago.
Every indication suggests that
freshmen in the future will
have opportunities to learn that
will be outstanding compared
to those presented to the class
of 1971.

students, who will be taught
by at least one professor and
three graduate teaching as
sistants. The courses will last
for two quarters, and students
will be given four uidts for
the fall quarter and five nnits
for winter quarter.
The course will consist of
large lecture groups which will
then divide into small seminars.
According to Polhemus, if next
year's program is successful,
freshman English may evolve
into about twelve such pro
grams. Instead of being re
quired to take one general En
glish course, freshmen will then
have the option to choose the
type of English they want to
take, very similar to the way the
Civ program may operate.
The thematic courses to be
offered in September will be:
Literature in Technology, Forms
of American Contemporary Lit
erature, and Writing: the Per
sonal Forms.
Another change now being
considered for the English re
quirement is replacing the pres
ent program with the option of
taking a one quarter, five unit,
intensive writing course. This
option may be offered during
the 1969-70 school year.
In discussing changes in the
freshman English program, Pol
hemus emphasized the primary
aims of the course: helping stu
dents write clearly, enabling
them to read literature with un
derstanding and appreciation,
generating intellectual excite*
ment, stimulating students to
think critically and seriously
about themselves and their
world, and, above all, helping
them realize the immense power
of language in determining their
lives. The main reason for
changing the course, he com
mented, would be to better ac
complish these aims.
This year there have been
sixty-three freshman seminars,
up from thirty-six two years
ago when the program was initi
ated and from forty-eight last
year. Mrs. Alfred Appel, head
of the program, has said that
the response "has very

Tli© program was organized
to give freshmen the oppor
tunity to meet professors in
informal surroundings, study
a subject of their own choice
in depth, and present unique,
interdisciplinary subjects not
usually found in Stanford's
regular curriculum. Several
such courses this year are:
Fiction and Politics, The Gro
tesque in Art and Literature,
and Literature and Theology.

The entire program was
supported by a private dona
tion when it began three years
ago. It met with such a tre
mendous response that when
the original funds ran out,
the University decided to con
tinue the program with its
own money.
Freshman education is already
radically different from what it
was only a few short years ago.
Every indication suggests that
freshmen in the future will
have opportunities to learn that
will be outstanding compared
to those presented to the class
of 1971.
Western Civilization and
Freshman English, the two
courses which virtually all 1200
freshmen are now taking, are
headed for big changes in the
future.
The freshman seminar pro
gram, now in its third year, will
continue next year basically un
changed.
Although History Professor
Paul Seaver, in charge of West
ern Civ, expects no drastic
changes in the program next
year, the course as it. exists now
may have disappeared by the
1969-70 school year.
Earlier this year the Western
Civ staff submitted a proposal
for reconstructuring the course
to the History Department, the
Committee of Humanities and
Sciences for Undergraduate Ed
ucation, and the Study of Educa
tion at Stanford (SES). All three
groups are now considering the
proposal.
The freshman English pro
gram, however, is not only un
dergoing considered changes,
but will be modified to a large
extent this September. The di
rector of the program, Prof.
Robert M. Polhemus, indicated
recently that incoming fresh
men will have the option to take

English as it was presented to
freshmen this year or to choose
one of three thematic English
courses.
One change in the freshman
seminar program next year will
be five new seminars taught by
"prominent members of the
local business and scientific com
munity." These seminars are
being made possible because of
a special grant awarded to the
program by a private donor.
Seaver pointed out that His
tory 1, 2 and 3 have been re
quired courses at Stanford since
the 1930'5.
The SES recently agreed to
send out a questionnaire to all
students now taking Civ before
the end of this quarter. The
questionnaire will collect stu
dent opinion on the course as it
is now and as it could be in the
future.
In its proposed the civ staff
suggested the course be re
oriented into several "thematic"
courses revolving around specif
ic periods or trends in history
instead of the general, all-en
compassing survey course now
offered.
Seaver, who claims "any
choice is better than no choice,"
asserted that the staff's main
complaint about the present pro

gram is the same as that of
most students: no real option to
deviate from the syllabus.
The staff, beside recom
mending that students be
given five units for each quar
ter of Civ, also suggested stu
dents be given an option to
drop the course during spring
quarter on the understanding
they will take some kind of
advanced history course some
time before they graduate.
Seaver commented that so far
his staff has encountered two
main objections to the proposal.
It can be argued, he said, that
there is really no point in having
required courses, period. If one
maintained this position, "there
would be no room for a re
quired Civ course," he re
marked.
The other objection is if the
course is not going to be the
same for everyone, why make
everyone take it? While Seaver
admitted the Civ staff feels the
course as it now stands is self
defeating, he added most Civ
instructors agree some kind of
general education in history is
a good thing ior college stu
dents.
In its recommendation, the
staff has tried to confront both
objetcions by presenting both

students and instructors with a
program of "required options"
—a very general requirement
which can be fulfilled by a num
ber of different courses.
No final decision can possibly
be implemented until a year
from this coming September.
Each of the three thematic
courses to 1m» offered by the
English Department will have

changes in the program next
year, the course as it. exists now
may have disappeared by the
1969-70 school year.
Earlier this year the Western
Civ staff submitted a proposal
for reconstructuring the course
to the History Department, the
Committee of Humanities and
Sciences for Undergraduate Ed
ucation, and the Study of Educa
tion at Stanford (SES). All three
groups are now considering the
proposal.
The freshman English pro
gram, however, is not only un
dergoing considered changes,
but will be modified to a large
extent this September. The di
rector of the program, Prof.
Robert M. Polhemus, indicated
recently that incoming fresh
men will have the option to take

English as it was presented to
freshmen this year or to choose
one of three thematic English
courses.
One change in the freshman
seminar program next year will
be five new seminars taught by
"prominent members of the
local business and scientific com
munity." These seminars are
being made possible because of
a special grant awarded to the
program by a private donor.
Seaver pointed out that His
tory 1, 2 and 3 have been re
quired courses at Stanford since
the 1930'5.
The SES recently agreed to
send out a questionnaire to all
students now taking Civ before
the end of this quarter. The
questionnaire will collect stu
dent opinion on the course as it
is now and as it could be in the
future.
In its proposed the civ staff
suggested the course be re
oriented into several "thematic"
courses revolving around specif
ic periods or trends in history
instead of the general, all-en
compassing survey course now
offered.
Seaver, who claims "any
choice is better than no choice,"
asserted that the staff's main
complaint about the present pro

gram is the same as that of
most students: no real option to
deviate from the syllabus.
The staff, beside recom
mending that students be
given five units for each quar
ter of Civ, also suggested stu
dents be given an option to
drop the course during spring
quarter on the understanding
they will take some kind of
advanced history course some
time before they graduate.
Seaver commented that so far
his staff has encountered two
main objections to the proposal.
It can be argued, he said, that
there is really no point in having
required courses, period. If one
maintained this position, "there
would be no room for a re
quired Civ course," he re
marked.
The other objection is if the
course is not going to be the
same for everyone, why make
everyone take it? While Seaver
admitted the Civ staff feels the
course as it now stands is self
defeating, he added most Civ
instructors agree some kind of
general education in history is
a good thing ior college stu
dents.
In its recommendation, the
staff has tried to confront both
objetcions by presenting both

students and instructors with a
program of "required options"
—a very general requirement
which can be fulfilled by a num
ber of different courses.
No final decision can possibly
be implemented until a year
from this coming September.
Each of the three thematic
courses to 1m» offered by the
English Department will have
approximately seventy-five
students, who will be taught
by at least one professor and
three graduate teaching as
sistants. The courses will last
for two quarters, and students
will be given four uidts for
the fall quarter and five nnits
for winter quarter.
The course will consist of
large lecture groups which will
then divide into small seminars.
According to Polhemus, if next
year's program is successful,
freshman English may evolve
into about twelve such pro
grams. Instead of being re
quired to take one general En
glish course, freshmen will then
have the option to choose the
type of English they want to
take, very similar to the way the
Civ program may operate.
The thematic courses to be
offered in September will be:
Literature in Technology, Forms
of American Contemporary Lit
erature, and Writing: the Per
sonal Forms.
Another change now being
considered for the English re
quirement is replacing the pres
ent program with the option of
taking a one quarter, five unit,
intensive writing course. This
option may be offered during
the 1969-70 school year.
In discussing changes in the
freshman English program, Pol
hemus emphasized the primary
aims of the course: helping stu
dents write clearly, enabling
them to read literature with un
derstanding and appreciation,
generating intellectual excite*
ment, stimulating students to
think critically and seriously
about themselves and their
world, and, above all, helping
them realize the immense power
of language in determining their
lives. The main reason for
changing the course, he com
mented, would be to better ac
complish these aims.
This year there have been
sixty-three freshman seminars,
up from thirty-six two years
ago when the program was initi
ated and from forty-eight last
year. Mrs. Alfred Appel, head
of the program, has said that
the response "has very

year's program is successful,
freshman English may evolve
into about twelve such pro
grams. Instead of being re
quired to take one general En
glish course, freshmen will then
have the option to choose the
type of English they want to
take, very similar to the way the
Civ program may operate.
The thematic courses to be
offered in September will be:
Literature in Technology, Forms
of American Contemporary Lit
erature, and Writing: the Per
sonal Forms.
Another change now being
considered for the English re
quirement is replacing the pres
ent program with the option of
taking a one quarter, five unit,
intensive writing course. This
option may be offered during
the 1969-70 school year.
In discussing changes in the
freshman English program, Pol
hemus emphasized the primary
aims of the course: helping stu
dents write clearly, enabling
them to read literature with un
derstanding and appreciation,
generating intellectual excite*
ment, stimulating students to
think critically and seriously
about themselves and their
world, and, above all, helping
them realize the immense power
of language in determining their
lives. The main reason for
changing the course, he com
mented, would be to better ac
complish these aims.
This year there have been
sixty-three freshman seminars,
up from thirty-six two years
ago when the program was initi
ated and from forty-eight last
year. Mrs. Alfred Appel, head
of the program, has said that
the response "has very

such courses this year are:

and Literature and Theology.

supported by a private dona

mendous response that when
the original funds ran out,
the University decided to con
tinue the program with its
own money.
Freshman education is already
radically different from what it
was only a few short years ago.
Every indication suggests that
freshmen in the future will
have opportunities to learn that
will be outstanding compared
to those presented to the class
of 1971.
Western Civilization and
Freshman English, the two
courses which virtually all 1200
freshmen are now taking, are
headed for big changes in the
future.
The freshman seminar pro
gram, now in its third year, will
continue next year basically un
changed.
Although History Professor
Paul Seaver, in charge of West
ern Civ, expects no drastic
changes in the program next
year, the course as it. exists now
may have disappeared by the
1969-70 school year.
Earlier this year the Western
Civ staff submitted a proposal
for reconstructuring the course
to the History Department, the
Committee of Humanities and
Sciences for Undergraduate Ed
ucation, and the Study of Educa
tion at Stanford (SES). All three
groups are now considering the
proposal.
The freshman English pro
gram, however, is not only un
dergoing considered changes,
but will be modified to a large
extent this September. The di
rector of the program, Prof.
Robert M. Polhemus, indicated
recently that incoming fresh
men will have the option to take

English as it was presented to
freshmen this year or to choose
one of three thematic English
courses.
One change in the freshman
seminar program next year will
be five new seminars taught by
"prominent members of the
local business and scientific com
munity." These seminars are
being made possible because of
a special grant awarded to the
program by a private donor.
Seaver pointed out that His
tory 1, 2 and 3 have been re
quired courses at Stanford since
the 1930'5.
The SES recently agreed to
send out a questionnaire to all
students now taking Civ before
the end of this quarter. The
questionnaire will collect stu
dent opinion on the course as it
is now and as it could be in the
future.
In its proposed the civ staff
suggested the course be re
oriented into several "thematic"
courses revolving around specif
ic periods or trends in history
instead of the general, all-en
compassing survey course now
offered.
Seaver, who claims "any
choice is better than no choice,"
asserted that the staff's main
complaint about the present pro

gram is the same as that of
most students: no real option to
deviate from the syllabus.
The staff, beside recom
mending that students be
given five units for each quar
ter of Civ, also suggested stu
dents be given an option to
drop the course during spring
quarter on the understanding
they will take some kind of
advanced history course some
time before they graduate.
Seaver commented that so far
his staff has encountered two
main objections to the proposal.
It can be argued, he said, that
there is really no point in having
required courses, period. If one
maintained this position, "there
would be no room for a re
quired Civ course," he re
marked.
The other objection is if the
course is not going to be the
same for everyone, why make
everyone take it? While Seaver
admitted the Civ staff feels the
course as it now stands is self
defeating, he added most Civ
instructors agree some kind of
general education in history is
a good thing ior college stu
dents.
In its recommendation, the
staff has tried to confront both
objetcions by presenting both

students and instructors with a
program of "required options"
—a very general requirement
which can be fulfilled by a num
ber of different courses.
No final decision can possibly
be implemented until a year
from this coming September.
Each of the three thematic
courses to 1m» offered by the
English Department will have
approximately seventy-five
students, who will be taught
by at least one professor and
three graduate teaching as
sistants. The courses will last
for two quarters, and students
will be given four uidts for
the fall quarter and five nnits
for winter quarter.
The course will consist of
large lecture groups which will
then divide into small seminars.
According to Polhemus, if next
year's program is successful,
freshman English may evolve
into about twelve such pro
grams. Instead of being re
quired to take one general En
glish course, freshmen will then
