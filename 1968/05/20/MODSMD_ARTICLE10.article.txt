# Beyond An Issue
## 
### 
We freshmen seem to have become pretty smug. In our new
freedom to act we can self-assuredly sit-in at the Old Union,
return draft cards, or demand justice with the BSU. We can
confidently converse at length about politics and"the system,"
drugs and awareness, openness and honesty. We can fill an issue
of The Daily with our causes, ideals and self-righteous criticism.
But what do we really have to show for all this "involvement?"
For many, conforming to the non-conformity of activism and in
tellectual cynicism is no real change. It is only exchanging the
security of a successful high school career and sheltered home
for the security of feeling enlightened about and essential to the
salvation of the campus and the country.
Fortunately our involvement actually signifies much more. Be
hind our rebellious intolerance we are timidly searching for a
new vantage point from which to challenge ourselves and our
environment. Look at our causes, for they represent the first
stabs at the phantomlike goals, new principles. Look at the
praise and criticism in our comment, the initial efforts at mold
ing environment to new ideals.
Most importantly look behind these specifics, behind the con
tent of our trends of thought to our indecision. The insecurity of
questioning, whether voiced in the response of "involved" stu
dents or the non-response of those apparently disinterested ones
who don't yet know what to say, is the common denominator of
the freshman year.
Judge our methods and opinions if you must, but realize that
their real significance lies in the spirit they represent, in our
willingness to experiment in extremes to discover where we
really stand. The strength of the force daring us to adventure is
the real measure of our involvement.
