## Freshman Response To A 'Letter From Mom' 
### 
(Editor's note: Last Wednes
day's Daily carried a letter re
ceived by freshman Terry Moore
from his mother. Following- on
pages 2 and 3 are his reply and
letters written hy three other
freshmen in answer to Mrs.
Moore.)
Editor, The Daily:
The appearance of the "Letter
From Mom" in the Daily gen
erated a wide variety of reac
tions from Stanford students. As
expected, many dismissed it as
conservative senility, others ad
mitted that it had some redeem
ing value, and, most surprising
ly, some accepted it verbatim. A
few looked at the personal side
of the letter and offered well-in
tentioned criticism of my hair
cut and religious convictions. A
lesser number have asked me
how I personally reacted to my
Mother's letter, and why I sub
mitted it for publication. It is
to this last group that I address
myself now.
When I first read the letter, I
was extremely angry; more be
cause of personal barbs than
because of anything my Mother
had said about the bigger issues.
After a few more readings I was
able to reason more unbaisedly
and analyze her more pertinent
points.
First of all, the letter is a
passionate rather than a ra
tional reaction to the recent
activity on the Stanford cam
pus. Not only is this fact indi
cated by the tone of the letter,
but it also contained many
typographical errors and mar
ginal afterthoughts. It is as an
emotional response to distress
ing occurrences that the letter
must be interpreted.
The first thing my Mother ob
jected to was "a topless dancer
as student body president." As
a male, I cannot get quite as up
set about this as she obviously
was. I do not think she would
have been nearly as disturbed by
this if all our neighbors had not
brought her every clipping they
could find in the local news
papers. Her feelings about Vicky
were typical of a mother who is
sending away her first boy for
the first time. I think she
brought up the topless presiden
tial candidate to strengthen her
argument about the moral de
cay of the University.
Her next topic was the riots.
It is here that much of her ar
gument falls apart. I think that
the fact that she is so far re
moved from Stanford life is a
major cause of her myopia. I
cannot agree with her when she
says that "the rules and regula
tions for 11,000 students [were]
dictated by 400 rioters." Further
more, the faculty, far from be
ing "spineless," reached de
cisions which I feel required a

great deal of courage. I do not
have the time or space to go
into my reasons for these as
sertions. Others have expressed
them better than I could hope to.
The only time I feel that
my Mother is inexcusably
wrong Is when she states that
she says that she should be
spending $3600 a year to guard
me against an environment
such as Stanford's. The im
pression she gives is that she
would rather have me con
tent in my ignorance. To me,
this is completely irrational
and I would hope that she
would reconsider on this Idea
at least.
It is not until the end of the
letter that her main point be
comes clear. She is "preaching
. . . some kind of philosophy of
moral values." She contends that
old values cannot be indiscrim
inately discarded to make way
for the new. On these points I
must agree with her. Change is
necessary. Rapid change is de
sirable. But change without
thought of its consequences,
change without careful inspec
tion of the good that, is in the old
system, this type of change is
often tragedy.
My Mother sums up my final
reason for allowing her letter
to be printed. "If I understand
correctly, current thought is
that each person should be al
lowed to do his own 'thing' with
out any interference from any
one. Stanford's 'thing' is defin
itely not mine. . ." We at Stan
ford attach a tremendous im
portance to the riots and the
subsequent administrative
change that they expedited.
It is essential that we real
ize that many of those not in
volved in the Stanford Com
munity also feel that the riots
are significant, but only in a
pejorative sense. They are of;
another generation, but it Is
self-defeating to cast them
aside as irrelevant. Perhaps
college students have the solu
tions, but they will not be able
to actualize them by them
selves. The "Don't-trust-any
one-over-thirty" mentality has
no place in a progressive
society.
"Perhaps on talking with you
this summer, you can enlighten
us more and put this whole
thing in a different perspective."
Communication is not only de
sirable, it is imperative. And if
my Mother can be considered
typical of the generation with
which we are dealing, then com
munication is worth the effort.

Dear Mom,
I was rather unhappy to re
ceive your letter but I was not

surprised because you are view
ing the events of last week from
only one point of view. Al
though I can never relate ex
actly what did occur—you had
to have been at the Old Union
to fully understand—l will at
tempt to answer your letter and
give you another perspective on
the demonstrations and Stan
ford.
Certain assumptions you have
made that contributed to your
present rather disgusted im
pression of Stanford are either
incorrect or are exaggerations
that misrepresent this univers
ity. Concerning Vicky Drake,
you seem to think that her cam
paign posters are posted on
every wall of every building on
campus and students see it
wherever they go. Let me assure
you, they are few and far be
tween and those that are still
around are inside a room, prob
ably hidden.
Rioters? Mom, if you look
back at the Dailies you will
see that the completely non
violent demonstration was not
even close to a riot. The pro
testors by no means tried to
dictate rules and regulations
or run the administration but
if you insist on calling it dic
tating, remember that a ma
jority of the faculty that voted
in the Academic Council "dic
tated" virtually the same
tiling the protestors did.
I disagree with your state
ment that the administration is
"too spineless to stand up for
any of their principles." I think
they had enough sense to give
in to the opinion of the major
ity of the students and faculty
who voted on the demands and
to admit they might be wrong—
or is everything the administra
tion says automatically right?
And if you were here you would
quickly see that there is noth
ing close to anarchy at Stan
ford. The administration still
has a very firm hold on student
affairs.

Mom, what is the philosophy
of moral values that you are
preaching? Acceptance without
question of whatever is handed
down to you? Do whatever you
are told and not stand up for
the principles of judicial justice
and fairness that you have
taught me to respect? What
surroundings would you bolt the
door against at home? A place
where I can consider all the
points of view and come to my
own decision?
Why are you spending $3600
a year, Mom? You better ask
yourself that question. What
I hope to accomplish at Stan
ford, why I am spending
$3600 a year, is not only to
learn as much as I can from
the courses I am taking but
also to ingest as many differ
ent ideas as I can and to think
and judge them for myself.
Only then can I become a
free-thinking adult.
I think you have gotten many

incorrect impressions of Stan
ford and have jumped to a con
clusion too quickly I ask you
to withhold judgment on me and
this university as much as you
can and not to come to such far
reaching conclusions like I am
on my way to become a long
haired atheist until you can
safely say you really know what
the situation is. You can not at
this point.
Although the demonstrators
and the administration had dif
ferent views on the subject in
question, I think both parties
acted rationally and as a result
there was no violence or destruc
tion. It is encouraging to see
that people with such opposite
opinions can eventually work
out a peaceful solution. I think
this is a very good place to re
ceive a college education and
personally I take pride in being
a part of this university.

Certain assumptions you have
made that contributed to your
present rather disgusted im
pression of Stanford are either
incorrect or are exaggerations
that misrepresent this univers
ity. Concerning Vicky Drake,
you seem to think that her cam
paign posters are posted on
every wall of every building on
campus and students see it
wherever they go. Let me assure
you, they are few and far be
tween and those that are still
around are inside a room, prob
ably hidden.
Rioters? Mom, if you look
back at the Dailies you will
see that the completely non
violent demonstration was not
even close to a riot. The pro
testors by no means tried to
dictate rules and regulations
or run the administration but
if you insist on calling it dic
tating, remember that a ma
jority of the faculty that voted
in the Academic Council "dic
tated" virtually the same
tiling the protestors did.
I disagree with your state
ment that the administration is
"too spineless to stand up for
any of their principles." I think
they had enough sense to give
in to the opinion of the major
ity of the students and faculty
who voted on the demands and
to admit they might be wrong—
or is everything the administra
tion says automatically right?
And if you were here you would
quickly see that there is noth
ing close to anarchy at Stan
ford. The administration still
has a very firm hold on student
affairs.

Mom, what is the philosophy
of moral values that you are
preaching? Acceptance without
question of whatever is handed
down to you? Do whatever you
are told and not stand up for
the principles of judicial justice
and fairness that you have
taught me to respect? What
surroundings would you bolt the
door against at home? A place
where I can consider all the
points of view and come to my
own decision?
Why are you spending $3600
a year, Mom? You better ask
yourself that question. What
I hope to accomplish at Stan
ford, why I am spending
$3600 a year, is not only to
learn as much as I can from
the courses I am taking but
also to ingest as many differ
ent ideas as I can and to think
and judge them for myself.
Only then can I become a
free-thinking adult.
I think you have gotten many

incorrect impressions of Stan
ford and have jumped to a con
clusion too quickly I ask you
to withhold judgment on me and
this university as much as you
can and not to come to such far
reaching conclusions like I am
on my way to become a long
haired atheist until you can
safely say you really know what
the situation is. You can not at
this point.
Although the demonstrators
and the administration had dif
ferent views on the subject in
question, I think both parties
acted rationally and as a result
there was no violence or destruc
tion. It is encouraging to see
that people with such opposite
opinions can eventually work
out a peaceful solution. I think
this is a very good place to re
ceive a college education and
personally I take pride in being
a part of this university.

(Editor's note: Last Wednes
day's Daily carried a letter re
ceived by freshman Terry Moore
from his mother. Following- on
pages 2 and 3 are his reply and
letters written hy three other
freshmen in answer to Mrs.
Moore.)
Editor, The Daily:
The appearance of the "Letter
From Mom" in the Daily gen
erated a wide variety of reac
tions from Stanford students. As
expected, many dismissed it as
conservative senility, others ad
mitted that it had some redeem
ing value, and, most surprising
ly, some accepted it verbatim. A
few looked at the personal side
of the letter and offered well-in
tentioned criticism of my hair
cut and religious convictions. A
lesser number have asked me
how I personally reacted to my
Mother's letter, and why I sub
mitted it for publication. It is
to this last group that I address
myself now.
When I first read the letter, I
was extremely angry; more be
cause of personal barbs than
because of anything my Mother
had said about the bigger issues.
After a few more readings I was
able to reason more unbaisedly
and analyze her more pertinent
points.
First of all, the letter is a
passionate rather than a ra
tional reaction to the recent
activity on the Stanford cam
pus. Not only is this fact indi
cated by the tone of the letter,
but it also contained many
typographical errors and mar
ginal afterthoughts. It is as an
emotional response to distress
ing occurrences that the letter
must be interpreted.
The first thing my Mother ob
jected to was "a topless dancer
as student body president." As
a male, I cannot get quite as up
set about this as she obviously
was. I do not think she would
have been nearly as disturbed by
this if all our neighbors had not
brought her every clipping they
could find in the local news
papers. Her feelings about Vicky
were typical of a mother who is
sending away her first boy for
the first time. I think she
brought up the topless presiden
tial candidate to strengthen her
argument about the moral de
cay of the University.
Her next topic was the riots.
It is here that much of her ar
gument falls apart. I think that
the fact that she is so far re
moved from Stanford life is a
major cause of her myopia. I
cannot agree with her when she
says that "the rules and regula
tions for 11,000 students [were]
dictated by 400 rioters." Further
more, the faculty, far from be
ing "spineless," reached de
cisions which I feel required a

great deal of courage. I do not
have the time or space to go
into my reasons for these as
sertions. Others have expressed
them better than I could hope to.
The only time I feel that
my Mother is inexcusably
wrong Is when she states that
she says that she should be
spending $3600 a year to guard
me against an environment
such as Stanford's. The im
pression she gives is that she
would rather have me con
tent in my ignorance. To me,
this is completely irrational
and I would hope that she
would reconsider on this Idea
at least.
It is not until the end of the
letter that her main point be
comes clear. She is "preaching
. . . some kind of philosophy of
moral values." She contends that
old values cannot be indiscrim
inately discarded to make way
for the new. On these points I
must agree with her. Change is
necessary. Rapid change is de
sirable. But change without
thought of its consequences,
change without careful inspec
tion of the good that, is in the old
system, this type of change is
often tragedy.
My Mother sums up my final
reason for allowing her letter
to be printed. "If I understand
correctly, current thought is
that each person should be al
lowed to do his own 'thing' with
out any interference from any
one. Stanford's 'thing' is defin
itely not mine. . ." We at Stan
ford attach a tremendous im
portance to the riots and the
subsequent administrative
change that they expedited.
It is essential that we real
ize that many of those not in
volved in the Stanford Com
munity also feel that the riots
are significant, but only in a
pejorative sense. They are of;
another generation, but it Is
self-defeating to cast them
aside as irrelevant. Perhaps
college students have the solu
tions, but they will not be able
to actualize them by them
selves. The "Don't-trust-any
one-over-thirty" mentality has
no place in a progressive
society.
"Perhaps on talking with you
this summer, you can enlighten
us more and put this whole
thing in a different perspective."
Communication is not only de
sirable, it is imperative. And if
my Mother can be considered
typical of the generation with
which we are dealing, then com
munication is worth the effort.

Dear Mom,
I was rather unhappy to re

says that "the rules and regula
tions for 11,000 students [were]
dictated by 400 rioters." Further
more, the faculty, far from be
ing "spineless," reached de
cisions which I feel required a

great deal of courage. I do not
have the time or space to go
into my reasons for these as
sertions. Others have expressed
them better than I could hope to.
The only time I feel that
my Mother is inexcusably
wrong Is when she states that
she says that she should be
spending $3600 a year to guard
me against an environment
such as Stanford's. The im
pression she gives is that she
would rather have me con
tent in my ignorance. To me,
this is completely irrational
and I would hope that she
would reconsider on this Idea
at least.
It is not until the end of the
letter that her main point be
comes clear. She is "preaching
. . . some kind of philosophy of
moral values." She contends that
old values cannot be indiscrim
inately discarded to make way
for the new. On these points I
must agree with her. Change is
necessary. Rapid change is de
sirable. But change without
thought of its consequences,
change without careful inspec
tion of the good that, is in the old
system, this type of change is
often tragedy.
My Mother sums up my final
reason for allowing her letter
to be printed. "If I understand
correctly, current thought is
that each person should be al
lowed to do his own 'thing' with
out any interference from any
one. Stanford's 'thing' is defin
itely not mine. . ." We at Stan
ford attach a tremendous im
portance to the riots and the
subsequent administrative
change that they expedited.
It is essential that we real
ize that many of those not in
volved in the Stanford Com
munity also feel that the riots
are significant, but only in a
pejorative sense. They are of;
another generation, but it Is
self-defeating to cast them
aside as irrelevant. Perhaps
college students have the solu
tions, but they will not be able
to actualize them by them
selves. The "Don't-trust-any
one-over-thirty" mentality has
no place in a progressive
society.
"Perhaps on talking with you
this summer, you can enlighten
us more and put this whole
thing in a different perspective."
Communication is not only de
sirable, it is imperative. And if
my Mother can be considered
typical of the generation with

Dear Mom,
I was rather unhappy to re
ceive your letter but I was not

surprised because you are view
ing the events of last week from
only one point of view. Al
though I can never relate ex
actly what did occur—you had
to have been at the Old Union
to fully understand—l will at
tempt to answer your letter and
give you another perspective on
the demonstrations and Stan
ford.
Certain assumptions you have
made that contributed to your
present rather disgusted im
pression of Stanford are either
incorrect or are exaggerations
that misrepresent this univers
ity. Concerning Vicky Drake,
you seem to think that her cam
paign posters are posted on
every wall of every building on
campus and students see it
wherever they go. Let me assure
you, they are few and far be
tween and those that are still
around are inside a room, prob
ably hidden.
Rioters? Mom, if you look
back at the Dailies you will
see that the completely non
violent demonstration was not
even close to a riot. The pro
testors by no means tried to
dictate rules and regulations
or run the administration but
if you insist on calling it dic
tating, remember that a ma
jority of the faculty that voted
in the Academic Council "dic
tated" virtually the same
tiling the protestors did.
I disagree with your state
ment that the administration is
"too spineless to stand up for
any of their principles." I think
they had enough sense to give
in to the opinion of the major
ity of the students and faculty
who voted on the demands and
to admit they might be wrong—
or is everything the administra
tion says automatically right?
And if you were here you would
quickly see that there is noth
ing close to anarchy at Stan
ford. The administration still
has a very firm hold on student
affairs.

Mom, what is the philosophy
of moral values that you are
preaching? Acceptance without
question of whatever is handed
down to you? Do whatever you
are told and not stand up for
the principles of judicial justice
and fairness that you have
taught me to respect? What
surroundings would you bolt the
door against at home? A place
where I can consider all the
points of view and come to my
own decision?
Why are you spending $3600
a year, Mom? You better ask
yourself that question. What
I hope to accomplish at Stan
ford, why I am spending
$3600 a year, is not only to
learn as much as I can from
the courses I am taking but
also to ingest as many differ
ent ideas as I can and to think
and judge them for myself.
Only then can I become a
free-thinking adult.
I think you have gotten many

incorrect impressions of Stan
ford and have jumped to a con
clusion too quickly I ask you
to withhold judgment on me and
this university as much as you
can and not to come to such far
reaching conclusions like I am
on my way to become a long
haired atheist until you can
safely say you really know what
the situation is. You can not at
this point.
Although the demonstrators
and the administration had dif
ferent views on the subject in
question, I think both parties
acted rationally and as a result
there was no violence or destruc
tion. It is encouraging to see
that people with such opposite
opinions can eventually work
out a peaceful solution. I think
this is a very good place to re
ceive a college education and
personally I take pride in being
a part of this university.

(Editor's note: Last Wednes
day's Daily carried a letter re
ceived by freshman Terry Moore
from his mother. Following- on
pages 2 and 3 are his reply and
letters written hy three other
freshmen in answer to Mrs.
Moore.)
Editor, The Daily:
The appearance of the "Letter
From Mom" in the Daily gen
erated a wide variety of reac
tions from Stanford students. As
expected, many dismissed it as
conservative senility, others ad
mitted that it had some redeem
ing value, and, most surprising
ly, some accepted it verbatim. A
few looked at the personal side
of the letter and offered well-in
tentioned criticism of my hair
cut and religious convictions. A
lesser number have asked me
how I personally reacted to my
Mother's letter, and why I sub
mitted it for publication. It is
to this last group that I address
myself now.
When I first read the letter, I
was extremely angry; more be
cause of personal barbs than
because of anything my Mother
had said about the bigger issues.
After a few more readings I was
able to reason more unbaisedly
and analyze her more pertinent
points.
First of all, the letter is a
passionate rather than a ra
tional reaction to the recent
activity on the Stanford cam
pus. Not only is this fact indi
cated by the tone of the letter,
but it also contained many
typographical errors and mar
ginal afterthoughts. It is as an
emotional response to distress
ing occurrences that the letter
must be interpreted.
The first thing my Mother ob
jected to was "a topless dancer
as student body president." As
a male, I cannot get quite as up
set about this as she obviously
was. I do not think she would
have been nearly as disturbed by
this if all our neighbors had not
brought her every clipping they
could find in the local news
papers. Her feelings about Vicky
were typical of a mother who is
sending away her first boy for
the first time. I think she
brought up the topless presiden
tial candidate to strengthen her
argument about the moral de
cay of the University.
Her next topic was the riots.
It is here that much of her ar
gument falls apart. I think that
the fact that she is so far re
moved from Stanford life is a
major cause of her myopia. I
cannot agree with her when she
says that "the rules and regula
tions for 11,000 students [were]
dictated by 400 rioters." Further
more, the faculty, far from be

(Editor's note: Last Wednes
day's Daily carried a letter re
ceived by freshman Terry Moore
from his mother. Following- on
pages 2 and 3 are his reply and
letters written hy three other
freshmen in answer to Mrs.
Moore.)
Editor, The Daily:
The appearance of the "Letter
From Mom" in the Daily gen
erated a wide variety of reac
tions from Stanford students. As
expected, many dismissed it as
conservative senility, others ad
mitted that it had some redeem
ing value, and, most surprising
ly, some accepted it verbatim. A
few looked at the personal side
of the letter and offered well-in
tentioned criticism of my hair
cut and religious convictions. A
lesser number have asked me
how I personally reacted to my
Mother's letter, and why I sub
mitted it for publication. It is
to this last group that I address
myself now.
When I first read the letter, I
was extremely angry; more be
cause of personal barbs than
because of anything my Mother
had said about the bigger issues.
After a few more readings I was
able to reason more unbaisedly
and analyze her more pertinent
points.
First of all, the letter is a
passionate rather than a ra
tional reaction to the recent
activity on the Stanford cam
pus. Not only is this fact indi
cated by the tone of the letter,
but it also contained many
typographical errors and mar
ginal afterthoughts. It is as an
emotional response to distress
ing occurrences that the letter
must be interpreted.
The first thing my Mother ob
jected to was "a topless dancer
as student body president." As
a male, I cannot get quite as up
set about this as she obviously
was. I do not think she would
have been nearly as disturbed by
this if all our neighbors had not
brought her every clipping they
could find in the local news
papers. Her feelings about Vicky
were typical of a mother who is
sending away her first boy for
the first time. I think she
brought up the topless presiden
tial candidate to strengthen her
argument about the moral de
cay of the University.
Her next topic was the riots.
It is here that much of her ar
gument falls apart. I think that
the fact that she is so far re
moved from Stanford life is a
major cause of her myopia. I
cannot agree with her when she
says that "the rules and regula
tions for 11,000 students [were]
dictated by 400 rioters." Further
more, the faculty, far from be
ing "spineless," reached de
cisions which I feel required a

great deal of courage. I do not
have the time or space to go
into my reasons for these as
sertions. Others have expressed
them better than I could hope to.
The only time I feel that
my Mother is inexcusably
wrong Is when she states that
she says that she should be
spending $3600 a year to guard
me against an environment
such as Stanford's. The im
pression she gives is that she
would rather have me con
tent in my ignorance. To me,
this is completely irrational
and I would hope that she
would reconsider on this Idea
at least.
It is not until the end of the
letter that her main point be
comes clear. She is "preaching
. . . some kind of philosophy of
moral values." She contends that
old values cannot be indiscrim
inately discarded to make way
for the new. On these points I
must agree with her. Change is
necessary. Rapid change is de
sirable. But change without
thought of its consequences,
change without careful inspec
tion of the good that, is in the old
system, this type of change is
often tragedy.
My Mother sums up my final
reason for allowing her letter
to be printed. "If I understand
correctly, current thought is
that each person should be al
lowed to do his own 'thing' with
out any interference from any
one. Stanford's 'thing' is defin
itely not mine. . ." We at Stan
ford attach a tremendous im
portance to the riots and the
subsequent administrative
change that they expedited.
It is essential that we real
ize that many of those not in
volved in the Stanford Com
munity also feel that the riots
are significant, but only in a
pejorative sense. They are of;
another generation, but it Is
self-defeating to cast them
aside as irrelevant. Perhaps
college students have the solu
tions, but they will not be able
to actualize them by them
selves. The "Don't-trust-any
one-over-thirty" mentality has
no place in a progressive
society.
"Perhaps on talking with you
this summer, you can enlighten
us more and put this whole
thing in a different perspective."
Communication is not only de
sirable, it is imperative. And if
my Mother can be considered
typical of the generation with
which we are dealing, then com
munication is worth the effort.

Dear Mom,
I was rather unhappy to re
ceive your letter but I was not

surprised because you are view
ing the events of last week from
only one point of view. Al
though I can never relate ex
actly what did occur—you had
to have been at the Old Union
to fully understand—l will at
tempt to answer your letter and
give you another perspective on
the demonstrations and Stan
ford.
Certain assumptions you have
made that contributed to your
present rather disgusted im
pression of Stanford are either
incorrect or are exaggerations
that misrepresent this univers
ity. Concerning Vicky Drake,
you seem to think that her cam
paign posters are posted on
every wall of every building on
campus and students see it
wherever they go. Let me assure
you, they are few and far be
tween and those that are still
around are inside a room, prob
ably hidden.
Rioters? Mom, if you look
back at the Dailies you will
see that the completely non
violent demonstration was not
even close to a riot. The pro
testors by no means tried to
dictate rules and regulations
or run the administration but
if you insist on calling it dic
tating, remember that a ma
jority of the faculty that voted
in the Academic Council "dic
tated" virtually the same
tiling the protestors did.
I disagree with your state
ment that the administration is
"too spineless to stand up for
any of their principles." I think
they had enough sense to give
in to the opinion of the major
ity of the students and faculty
who voted on the demands and
to admit they might be wrong—
or is everything the administra
tion says automatically right?
And if you were here you would
quickly see that there is noth
ing close to anarchy at Stan
ford. The administration still
has a very firm hold on student
affairs.

Mom, what is the philosophy
of moral values that you are
preaching? Acceptance without
question of whatever is handed
down to you? Do whatever you
are told and not stand up for
the principles of judicial justice
and fairness that you have
taught me to respect? What
surroundings would you bolt the
door against at home? A place
where I can consider all the
points of view and come to my
own decision?
Why are you spending $3600
a year, Mom? You better ask
yourself that question. What
I hope to accomplish at Stan
ford, why I am spending
$3600 a year, is not only to
learn as much as I can from
the courses I am taking but
also to ingest as many differ
ent ideas as I can and to think
and judge them for myself.
Only then can I become a
free-thinking adult.
I think you have gotten many

incorrect impressions of Stan
ford and have jumped to a con
clusion too quickly I ask you
to withhold judgment on me and
this university as much as you
can and not to come to such far
reaching conclusions like I am
on my way to become a long
haired atheist until you can
safely say you really know what
the situation is. You can not at
this point.
Although the demonstrators

ferent views on the subject in
question, I think both parties
acted rationally and as a result

Dear Mom,
I was rather unhappy to re
ceive your letter but I was not

surprised because you are view
ing the events of last week from
only one point of view. Al
though I can never relate ex
actly what did occur—you had
to have been at the Old Union
to fully understand—l will at
tempt to answer your letter and
give you another perspective on
the demonstrations and Stan
ford.
Certain assumptions you have
made that contributed to your
present rather disgusted im
pression of Stanford are either
incorrect or are exaggerations
that misrepresent this univers
ity. Concerning Vicky Drake,
you seem to think that her cam
paign posters are posted on
every wall of every building on
campus and students see it
wherever they go. Let me assure
you, they are few and far be
tween and those that are still
around are inside a room, prob
ably hidden.
Rioters? Mom, if you look
back at the Dailies you will
see that the completely non
violent demonstration was not
even close to a riot. The pro
testors by no means tried to
dictate rules and regulations
or run the administration but
if you insist on calling it dic
tating, remember that a ma
jority of the faculty that voted
in the Academic Council "dic
tated" virtually the same
tiling the protestors did.
I disagree with your state
ment that the administration is
"too spineless to stand up for
any of their principles." I think
they had enough sense to give
in to the opinion of the major
ity of the students and faculty
who voted on the demands and
to admit they might be wrong—
or is everything the administra
tion says automatically right?
And if you were here you would
quickly see that there is noth
ing close to anarchy at Stan
ford. The administration still
has a very firm hold on student
affairs.

Mom, what is the philosophy
of moral values that you are
preaching? Acceptance without
question of whatever is handed
down to you? Do whatever you
are told and not stand up for
the principles of judicial justice
and fairness that you have
taught me to respect? What
surroundings would you bolt the
door against at home? A place
where I can consider all the
points of view and come to my
own decision?
Why are you spending $3600
a year, Mom? You better ask
yourself that question. What
I hope to accomplish at Stan
ford, why I am spending
$3600 a year, is not only to
learn as much as I can from
the courses I am taking but
also to ingest as many differ
ent ideas as I can and to think
and judge them for myself.
Only then can I become a
free-thinking adult.
I think you have gotten many

incorrect impressions of Stan
ford and have jumped to a con
clusion too quickly I ask you
to withhold judgment on me and
this university as much as you
can and not to come to such far
reaching conclusions like I am
on my way to become a long
haired atheist until you can
safely say you really know what
the situation is. You can not at
this point.
Although the demonstrators
and the administration had dif
ferent views on the subject in
question, I think both parties
acted rationally and as a result
there was no violence or destruc
tion. It is encouraging to see
that people with such opposite
opinions can eventually work
out a peaceful solution. I think
this is a very good place to re
ceive a college education and
personally I take pride in being
a part of this university.
