## Life Is Tough 
### Hank Liese 
If Stanford students had satis
fying answers to all their major
problems, they'd still be unhap
py. If in some magical manner
students received all the power
they want or were granted those
cherished but distant "decision
making" thrones, they'd still be
discontent. Why? Because of the
many trivialities which will for
ever bother, irritate, and upset
even the most secure.
For example, there is one type
of person who really stirs my
emotions. This is the guy who
arrogantly cruises the Stanford
walks on his bicycle with his
hands behind his back. Every
time I witness this phenomenon
I wonder when they will come
out with a bike without handle
bars.
Then there's the embar
rassment suffered in the cam
pus barber shop when, after
that $2.50 trim, you are forced
to view yourself in a hand
mirror held up by the barber
while ten others look on.
Or how about buying a 19c Bic
pen at the bookstore and being
asked if you have a student
body card? Of course you dig it
out for it's worth the penny
discount.
Or what about cashing a $20
check at the bookstore then find
ing you don't have .hat nickel
to pay for the process and hav
ing to walk away with $19.95?
Or how about finding a red
"Call-at-Window" card in your
post office box early Saturday
afternoon and then, since the
P.O. for some odd reason isn't
open after noon on Saturdays,
having to suffer a curiosity com
plex until Monday.
But there are two places where
I've found such trivialities to
abound: Tresidder Union and
Wilbur Hall.
Ever waited 15 minutes for
a grilled cheese sandwich at
Tresidder, then all in a mat
ter of seconds had someone
step right up to the counter,
point to a hamburger sitting
there, ask you if if's anybody's,
then walk away with it?
Or how about buying a Chron
icle in the drugstore to read over
a cup of coffee then sitting at a
table next to one on which
someone left the same paper be
hind?
Or buying a 20c cup of straw

berries, smothering them with
a little cream, which you soon
find out is 10c extra. I always
wonder why a cup of coffee over
there is 10c with or without
cream. When I'm ready for an
other cup of strawberries at
Tresidder I think I'll buy them
plain but also get a 10c glass of
milk and make my own cream.
That's called more for your mon
ey.
But such opportunities for so
lutions are rare at Wilbur, where
the more trivial the trivialities
become, the more they tend to
frustrate.
Like having the operator page
you over the intercom at 8 on
a Saturday morning with the
message, "Simon called you at
10 last night and wants you to
return the call." Thank you, but
I saw Simon last night at 11.
Then there's always the ex
perience of filling a Wilbur

washer with three weeks of
dirty laundry and several cups
of Tide then getting the first
dime stuck in the machine and
I laving to reload everything:
into another washer. It's hard
to save all the detergent.
When it comes to the Wilbur
dining hall, I find it hard to keep
my cool. Ever pull a styrofoam
cup from the metal dispenser
and get six of them, one inside
of the other? All I ever use is
one.
Or how about coming to lunch
five minutes before closing time,
seeing a full tray of chocolate
eclairs, taking one, asking the
head hasher for another and be
ing told to come back in five
minutes?
Then there's waiting in line for
20 minutes only to find you left
your meal ticket in your room.
Life is tough no matter how
you look at it.
