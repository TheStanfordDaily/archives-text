## Answers To A 'Letter From Mom' 
### 
Dear Mom,
I am as eager as you for the
chance to talk over Stanford and
my year during the summer. I
only hope that until that time
we can both keep from freezing
into a position.
The stress being placed today
on collective guilt (e.g. the guilt
of the administration) is one
with which I do not agree, al
though some results seem attri

butable to that. In the last weeks
it has been fostered by the press,
who have chosen the element of
madness in the situations here;
this has made the headlines and
made everything appear much
more stark than it is. If you
were here you could make a
more reasonable assessment;
we would be able to combine
the best of the old and new per
spectives in their true aspects.
On the idea of collective
guilt—l have not joined with
those of my peers who are at
tributing everything wrong
with the world today to the
acts or non-acts of your gener
ation. Many in my generation,
as many did in yours, will
grow up to be apathetic, unin
formed, or impatiently violent
in respect to the statu* quo.
But there is a large group of
my age which is taking the time
to survey the situation in the
world, to get a perspective of
the problems in their total as
pects, and to develop a sense of
individual responsibility; this
includes patience — it isn't pos
sible to change the world in
twenty-four hours.
I think we will not be far
apart when we have a chance for
talking away from the present

heat. If we are to learn from
each other, we need dialogue, not
catch phrases; if I think of you
as a fuddy duddy and you of
me as a long haired atheist, there
is no beginning point. For me,
the most hopeful part of your
letter was at the end; after you
had honsetly expressed your in
dignation, you left the door open
for meaningful discussion.
Let's have it.

Dear Mom,
It was really great to hear
from you in your enlightened,
well-reasoned letter. It made me
hear music, specifically the
"America the Beautiful" dubbed
over the "Could a warm summer
day just happen?" chorus from
another letter, but I must admit
that it was somewhat disturb
ing, for I learned some things
from it.
First, I was pleased to find
that your main concern was not
over anything as silly as me but
about your fiscal involvement
with the school. I am sorry that
you feel that your money is be
ing spent on nudists and "long
haired atheists" but I am sure

that it can be easily rectified.
Perhaps if you wrote a nice let
ter to the financial office they
could specifically channel your
money into the purchase of vital
educational needs, like new pom
poms and polish for the new gym
floor.
I am sure that you would
not want your money given to
the chapel, since the people in
charge of it are notorious for
occasionally making sense.
Nor would you want it chan-t
neled into scholarships, since
those will probably go to black
students, some of whom may
not even go to Big Game,
being too busy studying, try
ing to meet the school's grade
system.
You seem concerned that
atheists are trying to impose
their anarchical will upon the
student body. I will not try to
point out to you some of the
more attractive parts of our re
ligion's history, such as the mis
sionary work that spoiled many
very nice people or the Inquisi
tion, nor will I try to explain that
far from being anarchical, the
people who sat in were actually
very conservative, for all they
were attempting to do was par
ticipate in an already existing
government.
I would like only to say Amer
icans saw fit to hang people after
World War II for refusing to
commit civil disobedience and,
while the people sitting in may
have been wrong, they were
honestly trying to participate in
a government that they did not
feel was absolutely right.
Finally, your third objection
was to the losing ASSU can
didate's posters. I would like
to say that I find nothing bas
ically evil or corrupt in the
female form and I am sorry
if you do, for you must have
spent many years being dis
gusted, every time you took
a shower or bath.
Well, mom .thanks for writing,
and listen — if your bridge club
is worried about where I'm go
ing to school, tell them Biola.

I would like only to say Amer

while the people sitting in may
have been wrong, they were
honestly trying to participate in
a government that they did not

Dear Mom,
I am as eager as you for the
chance to talk over Stanford and
my year during the summer. I
only hope that until that time
we can both keep from freezing
into a position.
The stress being placed today
on collective guilt (e.g. the guilt
of the administration) is one
with which I do not agree, al
though some results seem attri

butable to that. In the last weeks
it has been fostered by the press,
who have chosen the element of
madness in the situations here;
this has made the headlines and
made everything appear much
more stark than it is. If you
were here you could make a
more reasonable assessment;
we would be able to combine
the best of the old and new per
spectives in their true aspects.
On the idea of collective
guilt—l have not joined with
those of my peers who are at
tributing everything wrong
with the world today to the
acts or non-acts of your gener
ation. Many in my generation,
as many did in yours, will
grow up to be apathetic, unin
formed, or impatiently violent
in respect to the statu* quo.
But there is a large group of
my age which is taking the time
to survey the situation in the
world, to get a perspective of
the problems in their total as
pects, and to develop a sense of
individual responsibility; this
includes patience — it isn't pos
sible to change the world in
twenty-four hours.
I think we will not be far
apart when we have a chance for
talking away from the present

heat. If we are to learn from
each other, we need dialogue, not
catch phrases; if I think of you
as a fuddy duddy and you of
me as a long haired atheist, there
is no beginning point. For me,
the most hopeful part of your
letter was at the end; after you
had honsetly expressed your in
dignation, you left the door open
for meaningful discussion.
Let's have it.

Dear Mom,
It was really great to hear
from you in your enlightened,
well-reasoned letter. It made me
hear music, specifically the
"America the Beautiful" dubbed
over the "Could a warm summer
day just happen?" chorus from
another letter, but I must admit
that it was somewhat disturb
ing, for I learned some things
from it.
First, I was pleased to find
that your main concern was not
over anything as silly as me but
about your fiscal involvement
with the school. I am sorry that
you feel that your money is be
ing spent on nudists and "long
haired atheists" but I am sure

that it can be easily rectified.
Perhaps if you wrote a nice let
ter to the financial office they
could specifically channel your
money into the purchase of vital
educational needs, like new pom
poms and polish for the new gym
floor.
I am sure that you would
not want your money given to
the chapel, since the people in
charge of it are notorious for
occasionally making sense.
Nor would you want it chan-t
neled into scholarships, since
those will probably go to black
students, some of whom may
not even go to Big Game,
being too busy studying, try
ing to meet the school's grade
system.
You seem concerned that
atheists are trying to impose
their anarchical will upon the
student body. I will not try to
point out to you some of the
more attractive parts of our re
ligion's history, such as the mis
sionary work that spoiled many
very nice people or the Inquisi
tion, nor will I try to explain that
far from being anarchical, the
people who sat in were actually
very conservative, for all they
were attempting to do was par

Perhaps if you wrote a nice let
ter to the financial office they
could specifically channel your
money into the purchase of vital
educational needs, like new pom
poms and polish for the new gym
floor.
I am sure that you would
not want your money given to
the chapel, since the people in
charge of it are notorious for
occasionally making sense.
Nor would you want it chan-t

students, some of whom may

You seem concerned that
atheists are trying to impose
their anarchical will upon the
student body. I will not try to

very conservative, for all they
were attempting to do was par

I would like only to say Amer

World War II for refusing to
commit civil disobedience and,
while the people sitting in may
have been wrong, they were
honestly trying to participate in
a government that they did not
feel was absolutely right.
Finally, your third objection
was to the losing ASSU can

to say that I find nothing bas

if you do, for you must have
spent many years being dis
gusted, every time you took
a shower or bath.
Well, mom .thanks for writing,
and listen — if your bridge club
is worried about where I'm go
ing to school, tell them Biola.

Dear Mom,
I am as eager as you for the
chance to talk over Stanford and
my year during the summer. I
only hope that until that time
we can both keep from freezing
into a position.
The stress being placed today
on collective guilt (e.g. the guilt
of the administration) is one
with which I do not agree, al
though some results seem attri

butable to that. In the last weeks
it has been fostered by the press,
who have chosen the element of
madness in the situations here;
this has made the headlines and
made everything appear much
more stark than it is. If you
were here you could make a
more reasonable assessment;
we would be able to combine
the best of the old and new per
spectives in their true aspects.
On the idea of collective
guilt—l have not joined with
those of my peers who are at
tributing everything wrong
with the world today to the
acts or non-acts of your gener
ation. Many in my generation,
as many did in yours, will
grow up to be apathetic, unin
formed, or impatiently violent
in respect to the statu* quo.
But there is a large group of
my age which is taking the time
to survey the situation in the
world, to get a perspective of
the problems in their total as
pects, and to develop a sense of
individual responsibility; this
includes patience — it isn't pos
sible to change the world in
twenty-four hours.
I think we will not be far
apart when we have a chance for
talking away from the present

heat. If we are to learn from
each other, we need dialogue, not
catch phrases; if I think of you
as a fuddy duddy and you of
me as a long haired atheist, there
is no beginning point. For me,
the most hopeful part of your
letter was at the end; after you
had honsetly expressed your in
dignation, you left the door open
for meaningful discussion.
Let's have it.

Dear Mom,
It was really great to hear
from you in your enlightened,
well-reasoned letter. It made me
hear music, specifically the
"America the Beautiful" dubbed
over the "Could a warm summer
day just happen?" chorus from
another letter, but I must admit
that it was somewhat disturb
ing, for I learned some things
from it.
First, I was pleased to find
that your main concern was not
over anything as silly as me but
about your fiscal involvement
with the school. I am sorry that
you feel that your money is be
ing spent on nudists and "long
haired atheists" but I am sure

that it can be easily rectified.
Perhaps if you wrote a nice let
ter to the financial office they
could specifically channel your
money into the purchase of vital
educational needs, like new pom
poms and polish for the new gym
