# Fraternity Pledges Escalate RF War
## 
### BRUCE HATHAWAY 
The dark forces of anti-intel
lectualism that lurk in the sha
dows of the typical Stanford
mind are given a fleeting glimpse
of sun each spring as fraternity
pledges invent new variations on
the old RF theme, and this
spring seems to be no exception.
Contrary to popular miscon
ception, the RF is really a deli
cate art form. The frat RF'er
walks a fine line between mis
chief and crime, and has to
weigh carefully several conflict
ing pressures during the plan
ning stage.
The classic RF must be dras
tic enough to cause the actives
intense discomfort, yet moder
ate enough to escape massive
retailiation either from the
irate actives or Stanford's
ever-vigilant police force.
Traditional RF's are similar
to some football plays. Everyone
knows what a draw play, an end
sweep, or a quarterback sneak
looks like, but if the play, or the
RF, is strong on execution and
enthusiasm, the results can be
devastating. Among the classic
RF's are stealing the Greek let
ters off the house, water balloon
battles, or exhibiting selected
house members around campus
in scanty attire.
Earlier this spring, ATO
pledges, armed with paint-filled
balloons and a surprisingly accu
rate water-balloon cannon, scor
ed heavily on the ATO house.
When a few actives tried to re
taliate with fire extinguishers,
the pledges captured the fire ex
tinguishers.
One gentle spring night the
DU's house president found him
self staked out spread-eagled in
the central court of Flo-Mo, clad
only in his boxer shorts. At th 1
last DU house meeting active
Brian Egolf was covered suc
cessively by layers of honey,
vacuum cleaner dust, and grass
(green variety).
One pledge trainer was found
chained to Mem Claw in his
shorts. On the other side of the
ledger, pledges are often dunked
in White Plaza fountain and ex
hibited in Row houses in some
thing less than their normal
amount of clothing.

The creative RF'er, however,
scorns these prosaic methods.
For instance, the Alpha Deltt
pledges released about fifty
very much overfed pigeons in
their house. It's rumored that
the Alpha Delt actives are still
scraping things off the floor
with putty knives. Cows are
a good bet for next year.
The ATO pledges, who move
into a new cluster next year,
used the latest weapon in the
RF war, butyric acid, which
smells pungently like rotting
flesh, to perfume the house
sleeping porch. The chemistry
whiz kids in the house, instead
of neutralizing the acid with am
monia, varnished the floor, mak
ing the odor more or less per
manent. The pledges also man
aged to paint tar on toilet seats,
door knobs, the house TV, and
the dining room chairs.
Very early one morning anoth
er pledge class quietly rolled
their actives' cars to strange and
distant points of the campus.
And at this point it is fairly ob
vious that the war will escalate
before the year ends.
No matter how one looks at it,
the pledge RF is definitely in the
Indian tradition. A perfect RF is
analogous to a young warrior
riding through Custer's camp,
stealing the hat off his head, and
escaping unscathed. While the
principle is the same, the over
eager pledge should bear in mind
how the U.S. government finally
treated the Indians: with reser
vations.

WET RF —Mike Drake, pledge trainer for Pld Sigma Kappa, one day
found his students somewhat rebellious and wound up lashed to
Mem Claw.
The dark forces of anti-intel
lectualism that lurk in the sha
dows of the typical Stanford
mind are given a fleeting glimpse
of sun each spring as fraternity
pledges invent new variations on
the old RF theme, and this
spring seems to be no exception.
Contrary to popular miscon
ception, the RF is really a deli
cate art form. The frat RF'er
walks a fine line between mis
chief and crime, and has to
weigh carefully several conflict
ing pressures during the plan
ning stage.
The classic RF must be dras
tic enough to cause the actives
intense discomfort, yet moder
ate enough to escape massive
retailiation either from the
irate actives or Stanford's
ever-vigilant police force.
Traditional RF's are similar
to some football plays. Everyone
knows what a draw play, an end
sweep, or a quarterback sneak
looks like, but if the play, or the
RF, is strong on execution and
enthusiasm, the results can be
devastating. Among the classic
RF's are stealing the Greek let
ters off the house, water balloon
battles, or exhibiting selected
house members around campus
in scanty attire.
Earlier this spring, ATO
pledges, armed with paint-filled
balloons and a surprisingly accu
rate water-balloon cannon, scor
ed heavily on the ATO house.
When a few actives tried to re
taliate with fire extinguishers,
the pledges captured the fire ex
tinguishers.
One gentle spring night the
DU's house president found him
self staked out spread-eagled in
the central court of Flo-Mo, clad
only in his boxer shorts. At th 1
last DU house meeting active
Brian Egolf was covered suc
cessively by layers of honey,
vacuum cleaner dust, and grass
(green variety).
One pledge trainer was found
chained to Mem Claw in his
shorts. On the other side of the
ledger, pledges are often dunked
in White Plaza fountain and ex
hibited in Row houses in some
thing less than their normal
amount of clothing.

The creative RF'er, however,
scorns these prosaic methods.
For instance, the Alpha Deltt
pledges released about fifty
very much overfed pigeons in
their house. It's rumored that
the Alpha Delt actives are still
scraping things off the floor
with putty knives. Cows are
a good bet for next year.
The ATO pledges, who move
into a new cluster next year,
used the latest weapon in the
RF war, butyric acid, which
smells pungently like rotting
flesh, to perfume the house
sleeping porch. The chemistry
whiz kids in the house, instead
of neutralizing the acid with am
