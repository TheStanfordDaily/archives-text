# Machine Gunning Shot Down
## Unique Jobs To Occupy Summer 
### BEV CUTLER BARBARA HYLAND 
The song may claim that it's
"summertime and the living is
easy," but most freshmen find
that vacation is a time to work,
not play. The search for summer
employment sometimes begins
months before June as students
seek the ideal jobâ€”one that is
both high paying and interest
ing.
In a random survey of mem
bers of the freshman class, it
was discovered that variety is
the keyword. Members of the
class of '71 will be doing every
thing from picking avocadoes to
lifeguarding. Some jobs were
more unusual.
The National Cheerleaders
Association asked Kim Nam
eny to be an instructor at
cheerleading clinics in Cali
fornia, Oregon and Washing
ton. The Association adds 20
new people to its staff every
year and conducts clinics
across the United States.
Each clinic lasts approxi
mately 5 days and is attended by
800 people. During those days,
there are workshops to teach
cheers and tumbling stunts. The
clinic is climaxed by competi

tions.
.Ron Rappaport will be man
aging four movie theaters in
Martha's Vineyard, Massachu
setts. Although his exact duties
are uncertain, he will probably
be in charge of booking the
movies and seeing that business
runs smoothly.
The AQUAlity Underground
Company was formed by Kim
Kimball and Bob Mithun last
summer. They install under
ground sprinkler systems in
Washington. By the end of last
summer, they had seven em
ployees. They expect business to
increase this summer and hope
to install six or seven systems.
Spending two months camp
ing in the Olympic Rain Forests
of Washington as a field assist
ant to a geologist is Jeanne
Johnson's idea of combining
work with fun. It is rare that a
girl is accepted for this job,
because the team will also in
clude two men. Jeanne will be
cleaning, cooking, and collecting
samples.
Felicia Wolford will he go
ing to Uganda with the first
group the Experiment in In
ternational Living has ever
sent there. She will be staying

in Kampala and living for two
months with a wealthy native
family.
She had hoped to go to Tan
zania where she could use her
Swahili, but political unrest
made it impossible. English is
the official language of Uganda.
Les Kaufman will be a milk
man in Denver. His hours are
from 2 a.m. until 11 a.m., but
the pay is good.
The most unique job offered
to any freshman was turned
down by Fred Witter because
he could not get any insurance.
The son of a Rhodesian diplo
mat asked him if he was inter

ested in a position that was
"high paying with excitement."
He was to be a government
police agent and patrol the
roads against rebel ambushes
and road pirates. His duty was
to ride in an armored truck
with a machine gun and shoot
down the restless natives who
were usually only armed with
knives and spears.
The pay was $120 a week
which is extremely good pay in
Rhodesia. However Fred de
cided that perhaps the risk was
not worth it, and declined the
job offer.
Whether working, traveling,

or loafing, freshmen will be
taking advantage of the change
of pace away from Stanford.
With the interesting jobs peo
ple have found, the summer
syndrome of boredom and list
lessness may be beaten. Maybe
this is the cure for the summer
time blues.
