# Talent-laden Frosh Bloom At Stanford
## 
### GARY CAVALLI 
Stanford reaped the rich har
vest of an outstanding crop of
freshmen in 1967-68, as talented
and versatile frosh athletes trig
gered hopes for a bright Indian
athletic future.
Perhaps the most outstanding
yearling was slender Jim Kauff
man from nearby Capuchino
High School. MVP of both the
frosh football and track teams,
Kauffman also contributed his
skills to Coach Naul Neumann's
basketball squad.
Varsity football coach John
Ralston sees a productive fu
ture for young Kauffman in
the Stanford defensive second*,
ary. According to Ralston,
Kauffman may be "outstand
ing" in the years to come.
Kauffman competed in the

broad jump, triple jump, high
jump, and 440 for Coach Jerry
Barland's frosh track contin
gent, besides running legs on
both the 440 and mile relay quar
tets. In a typical meet against
Santa Ana JC, Kauffman per
sonally accounted for 17 Ya
points.
Frosh fullback Jack Schultz
was another bright spot in fall
athletics. Schultz keyed the po
tent Tribe attack, gaining 170
yards against San Jose State and
188 against UCLA.
Schultz and Kauffman weren't
the only standouts on Terry De-
Sylvia's frosh grid squad. Line
men John Sande and Larry But
ler, quarterback Don Bunce, and
ends Ron Kadziel and Tom Sones
drew raves for their '67 perfor
mances and are making strong

bids for active positions on the
'68 varsity.
The strongest freshman
swimming contingent in Stan
ford history, boasting 14 high
school Ail-Americans, almost
beat the varsity in the tradi
tional varsity-frosh meet
The record - shattering group
was paced by John Ferris, who
obliterated the NCAA frosh 220-
butterfly mark, backstroker Fred
Haywood, freestyler Mitch Ivey,
butterfly ace Joe Welsh, diver
Ted Nichols, and IM ace Jamie
Knorr.
Ivey was the top scorer ijn
the strong frosh water polo
squad, while Welsh turned in a
fine job as goalie. Ken Terry and
Ray Collins stood out on defense,
while Brian Putnam, Steve Da
hout and Eagleston challenged
Ivey's scoring leadership.
Dennis O'Neill and Mike
Michel paced the frosh cagers
to a 10-6 overall mark. Back'
court ace O'Neill, who coach
Dallmar considers an excellent
prospect for the Tribe varsity,
led in scoring with 21.4 points
per game and was second in
rebounding with 100 caroms.
He had a remarkable transi
tion to guard after playing for
ward at Bellarmine Prep.
Michel, a 6-7 forward with an
amazing shooting touch, paced
Stanford rebounders with 174
and was second to O'Neill in scor
ing with 17.5 points per game.
Hustling forward Fred Green
averaged 12 points and 8 re
bounds per contest, despite miss
ing five games with a frac
tured arm.
The performances of freshmen
Steve Rochell and Dave Morgan
sparked hope for future Stan
ford success in gymnastics.
Rochell, former Illinois state
prep champion, turned in a 9.5
score on the still rings, while
Morgan was impressive on the
trampoline.
Coach Bill Boles frosh base
ball nine compiled an impres
sive 18-8 mark, largely due to*
the pitching of Steve Dun
ning and Bruce Schoen. Dun
ning posted an 8-2 mark with
a 1.95 ERA. Schoen, who often
lacked hitting support, was 44

but had an outstanding 1.09
ERA.
Dunning was the team's lead
ing hitter with a .306 average.
Outfielder Hank Marshall hit at
an even .300 clip, while catcher
Hank Snider, second-baseman
Larry Garlick, and outfielder Les
Kaufman established themselves
as future varsity prospects.

Top man on the hard-luck
frosh tennis team was Stan Pas
arell, already the nation's 40th
ranked amateur. Pasarell, who
varsity coach Dick Gould views
as one of the future "class play
ers in the area," played erratical
ly this year, at times brilliantly
but occasionally the victim of his
own mental lapses.
