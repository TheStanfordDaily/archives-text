## British Opposition Awaits Freshman 
### FRED LEESON 
If freshman Shelley Hamlin
could have things her way right
now, she'd trade an English
paper for a driver, a civ assign
ment for a pitching wedge and
an early lecture for an early
starting time.
Miss Hamlin, one of the best
amateur woman golfers in the
United States, is a member of
the Curtis Cup team which will
take on Britain's best June 14-15
in Ireland.
And logically enough, she
wouldn't mind a little time for
practice.
In six years of serious golf
Shelley has progressed from
summertime neighborhood
games in Fresno to national and
international competition.
Her first tournament, at age
14, was in Carmel. "I fell in
love with the whole idea," she
says. And then with a hint of
a smile: "I also noticed how
much fun the winner had."
Since then she's had a lot of
fun with golf.
At 16 she competed in the Na
tional Junior championship, led
all qualifiers by a surprising six
strokes, and then lost to the

eventual winner in the finals.
At 17 she tackled the U.S.
Women's Open in Minneapolis
and finished with the low ama
teur score.
From there it was to Pitts
burgh and the U.S. Women's
Amateur where again she led
qualifying rounds by six strokes
and was a medalist.
Was she surprised? "I'm al
ways surprised," she says with
a confident smile.
After that she was named
to the three-woman U.S. World
Cup team which went to Mex
ico and captured the title, a
first for the United States.
That was at 17, too.
"I'd like to win the Amateur
sometime," she says speaking of
ambitions, but she would rath
er teach junior high English and
history than turn pro.
"Being a professional doesn't
seem like a very fun life . . .
when it gets to be a business it
takes all the fun out."
The ebullient Miss Hamlin, it
appears, may be headed for a lot
of fun in the future. It could be
gin the middle of June, after she
gets past some studies and a fair
sized water hazard to the east.

the Curtis Cup team which will
take on Britain's best June 14-15
in Ireland.
And logically enough, she
wouldn't mind a little time for
practice.
In six years of serious golf
Shelley has progressed from
summertime neighborhood
games in Fresno to national and
international competition.
Her first tournament, at age
14, was in Carmel. "I fell in
love with the whole idea," she
says. And then with a hint of
a smile: "I also noticed how
much fun the winner had."
Since then she's had a lot of
fun with golf.
At 16 she competed in the Na
tional Junior championship, led
all qualifiers by a surprising six
strokes, and then lost to the

eventual winner in the finals.
At 17 she tackled the U.S.
Women's Open in Minneapolis
and finished with the low ama
teur score.
From there it was to Pitts
burgh and the U.S. Women's
Amateur where again she led
qualifying rounds by six strokes
and was a medalist.
Was she surprised? "I'm al
ways surprised," she says with
a confident smile.
After that she was named
to the three-woman U.S. World
Cup team which went to Mex
ico and captured the title, a
first for the United States.
That was at 17, too.
"I'd like to win the Amateur
sometime," she says speaking of
ambitions, but she would rath
er teach junior high English and
history than turn pro.
"Being a professional doesn't
seem like a very fun life . . .
when it gets to be a business it
takes all the fun out."
The ebullient Miss Hamlin, it
appears, may be headed for a lot
of fun in the future. It could be
gin the middle of June, after she
gets past some studies and a fair
sized water hazard to the east.
