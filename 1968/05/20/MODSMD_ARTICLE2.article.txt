Debate over the sit-in dem
onstration of two weeks ago has
been exhaustive; I can contribute
nothing new. But there are sev
eral things that I think the
events surrounding the demon
stration helped me to under
stand and I have attempted to
analyze it in terms of an edu
cational experience.
Certainly I did not involve my
self in the demonstration simply
to learn by it; to participate on
the grounds that one should be
in a demonstration just for the
experience is, of course, very
wrong and foolish.
I was sufficiently convinced
that the demands and tactics
should have been supported.
But I do not think it necessary
to give excuses for using the
demonstration as an educa
tional experience: the situation
held advantages for learning
by . observation and participa
tion.
In several ways, my involve
ment in the demonstration forc
ed me to understand abstrac
tions which might otherwise
have been almost meaningless.
Particularly after my decision to
sign the complicity statement, I
realized more fully what it
meant to make and act upon a
judgment. I had to cope with my
fear of possible consequences.
I painfully recognized the risks
involved in committment — the
possibility of a mistake if only
because the future is unknown.
I had to understand that the
alternatives for action do not
always accommodate the variety
of judgments which might be
made. The abstractions I had en
countered about making choices
became very applicable. Also con
cepts of political progress be
came more meaningful within
the context of the situation. I
understood the inadequacy of
expecting progress to seep into
the system with each passing
hour. Things were not constant
ly changing for the better — in
the university or elsewhere —
and often confrontation of some
sort was necessary for change.
Furthermore, ideas about the
relationship of power and rea
son, which Professor Novak dis
cussed during a seminar at the
sit-in, became very relevant.
" 'Realism' is defined by those

who exercise or defend present
power." Because of the situa
tion, I could more honestly say
"Yes, I understand what that
means." The point is this: no
longer were concepts only aca
demic; ideas became directly rel
evant and, whether or not I ac
cepted them completely, I under
stood how they might apply.
During the course of the dem
onstration, I learned something
about the press. Suspicion and
second-hand reports were con
firmed by personal experience. I
expected that the press would
be biased against any student
demonstration, but the blatant
distortion which occurred start
led me. At least one paper sug
gested that 100 students seized
an administration building and
burned the Navy ROTC building.
Other papers were more accur
ate and fair. But generally I
learned by the events of the dem
onstration how little credence
news coverage often deserves.
The demonstration also pro
vided an opportunity to ob
serve aspects of group dyna
mics. All the meetings of the
sit-in were remarkably demo
cratic and well-controlled. It
was Interesting, however, to

observe and experience the ef
fect of a spirit of solidarity
within the group. The leaders
were careful to preserve this
sense of unity and purpose.
The effects of group psychol
ogy, a spirit of adventure, and
devotion to a cause were appar
ent at times. Also the demonstra
tion was a micro-lab for study
ing an internal power struggle
among the leaders. Each pattern
ed his speeches and initiatives in
order to gain greater influence
with the group.
The demonstration also high
lighted for me some of the is
sues pertaining to student power.
In my discussion with others
about the place of the student
in the university, I noticed that
students may be aligned on a
certain spectrum.
At one end, students feel that
they have been accepted by an
institution which will perform
the task of their education if
they will only labor through the
process. These students seldom
worry that their lives and daily
experiences are usually divorced
from their academic pursuit.
They believe it necessary and
righteous to follow the dictates
of the institution.
At the other extreme are
those students who feel that
they are active members of a
university community which
requires their responsibility
and grants their right to affect
it directly. They want to use
the institution to make their
own education. They consider
themselves responsibleto
judge the quality of a course
or the conduct of their peers.
Most students place them
selves near the middle of this
spectrum, as I do. Those who
participated in the sit-in did not
necessarily come from one end
only. Generally, however, the in
terests and expectations of the
students at the extremes of such
an imaginary Spectrum operate
against each other.
The administration may be
receptive to student claims that
they could responsibly exercise
power over affairs involving
their education and conduct, but
any chance for eventual realiza
tion of student power is often
destroyed by students with no
interest in it. It is hardly comi
cal that headlines might have
appeared simultaneously pro
claiming "Stanford Students De
mand More Power" and "Stan
ford Students Elect Topless
Dancer."
The administration cannot be
entirely blamed for frustrating
demands for student power. The

many students who discount, ne
glect, or abuse responsibilty for
the university community de
stroy the chance the others
might have in achieving a basis
for power other than disruption.
I have pointed out several
things which I learned during
the three days of the demonstra
tion; I have neglected much de
tail and even several major as
pects. I certainly do not wish
to suggest that one should in
tentionally cause trouble in order
to learn about it. I do intend to
point out something about the
quality of our education.
Since fall quarter i have
sensed with deep frustration]
the confinements of this aca
demic community; this frus
tration will probably increase
beyond the freshman year. It
sometimes seems that an un
dergraduate education must
necessarily be a moratorium
on learning by experience. Cer
tainly this is a common com
plaint. But during the few
days of the demonstration I
was excited because there were
issues to be faced, action to
be taken, observations to be
made, and an experience to be
gained.
In analyzing and evaluating
what occurred during those three
days, I felt that I was dealing
with something relevant, some
thing that was my own business
rather than another's assign
ment.

By DAN MORROW
Debate over the sit-in dem
onstration of two weeks ago has
been exhaustive; I can contribute
nothing new. But there are sev
eral things that I think the
events surrounding the demon
stration helped me to under
stand and I have attempted to
analyze it in terms of an edu
cational experience.
Certainly I did not involve my
self in the demonstration simply
to learn by it; to participate on
the grounds that one should be
in a demonstration just for the
experience is, of course, very
wrong and foolish.
I was sufficiently convinced
that the demands and tactics
should have been supported.
But I do not think it necessary
to give excuses for using the
demonstration as an educa
tional experience: the situation
held advantages for learning
by . observation and participa
tion.
In several ways, my involve
ment in the demonstration forc
ed me to understand abstrac
tions which might otherwise
have been almost meaningless.
Particularly after my decision to
sign the complicity statement, I
realized more fully what it
meant to make and act upon a
judgment. I had to cope with my
fear of possible consequences.
I painfully recognized the risks
involved in committment — the
possibility of a mistake if only
because the future is unknown.
I had to understand that the
alternatives for action do not
always accommodate the variety
of judgments which might be
made. The abstractions I had en
countered about making choices
became very applicable. Also con
cepts of political progress be
came more meaningful within
the context of the situation. I
understood the inadequacy of
expecting progress to seep into
the system with each passing
hour. Things were not constant
ly changing for the better — in
the university or elsewhere —
and often confrontation of some
sort was necessary for change.
Furthermore, ideas about the
relationship of power and rea
son, which Professor Novak dis
cussed during a seminar at the
sit-in, became very relevant.
" 'Realism' is defined by those

who exercise or defend present
power." Because of the situa
tion, I could more honestly say
"Yes, I understand what that
means." The point is this: no
longer were concepts only aca
demic; ideas became directly rel
evant and, whether or not I ac
cepted them completely, I under
stood how they might apply.
During the course of the dem
onstration, I learned something
about the press. Suspicion and
second-hand reports were con
firmed by personal experience. I
expected that the press would
be biased against any student
demonstration, but the blatant
distortion which occurred start
led me. At least one paper sug
gested that 100 students seized
an administration building and
burned the Navy ROTC building.
Other papers were more accur
ate and fair. But generally I
learned by the events of the dem
onstration how little credence
news coverage often deserves.
The demonstration also pro
vided an opportunity to ob
serve aspects of group dyna
mics. All the meetings of the
sit-in were remarkably demo
cratic and well-controlled. It
was Interesting, however, to

observe and experience the ef
fect of a spirit of solidarity
within the group. The leaders
were careful to preserve this
sense of unity and purpose.
The effects of group psychol
ogy, a spirit of adventure, and
devotion to a cause were appar
ent at times. Also the demonstra
tion was a micro-lab for study
ing an internal power struggle
among the leaders. Each pattern
ed his speeches and initiatives in
order to gain greater influence
with the group.
The demonstration also high
lighted for me some of the is
sues pertaining to student power.
In my discussion with others
about the place of the student
in the university, I noticed that
students may be aligned on a
certain spectrum.
At one end, students feel that
they have been accepted by an
institution which will perform
the task of their education if
they will only labor through the
process. These students seldom
worry that their lives and daily
experiences are usually divorced
from their academic pursuit.
They believe it necessary and
righteous to follow the dictates
of the institution.
At the other extreme are
those students who feel that
they are active members of a
university community which
requires their responsibility
and grants their right to affect
it directly. They want to use
the institution to make their
own education. They consider
themselves responsibleto
judge the quality of a course
or the conduct of their peers.

second-hand reports were con
firmed by personal experience. I
expected that the press would
be biased against any student
demonstration, but the blatant
distortion which occurred start
led me. At least one paper sug
gested that 100 students seized
an administration building and
burned the Navy ROTC building.
Other papers were more accur
ate and fair. But generally I
learned by the events of the dem
onstration how little credence
news coverage often deserves.
The demonstration also pro
vided an opportunity to ob
serve aspects of group dyna
mics. All the meetings of the
sit-in were remarkably demo
cratic and well-controlled. It
was Interesting, however, to

observe and experience the ef
fect of a spirit of solidarity
within the group. The leaders
were careful to preserve this
sense of unity and purpose.
The effects of group psychol
ogy, a spirit of adventure, and
devotion to a cause were appar
ent at times. Also the demonstra
tion was a micro-lab for study
ing an internal power struggle
among the leaders. Each pattern
ed his speeches and initiatives in
order to gain greater influence
with the group.
The demonstration also high
lighted for me some of the is
sues pertaining to student power.
In my discussion with others
about the place of the student
in the university, I noticed that
students may be aligned on a
certain spectrum.
At one end, students feel that
they have been accepted by an
institution which will perform
the task of their education if
they will only labor through the
process. These students seldom
worry that their lives and daily
experiences are usually divorced
from their academic pursuit.
They believe it necessary and
righteous to follow the dictates
of the institution.
At the other extreme are
those students who feel that
they are active members of a
university community which
requires their responsibility
and grants their right to affect
it directly. They want to use
the institution to make their
own education. They consider
themselves responsibleto
judge the quality of a course
or the conduct of their peers.
Most students place them
selves near the middle of this
spectrum, as I do. Those who
participated in the sit-in did not
necessarily come from one end
only. Generally, however, the in
terests and expectations of the
students at the extremes of such
an imaginary Spectrum operate
against each other.
The administration may be
receptive to student claims that
they could responsibly exercise
power over affairs involving
their education and conduct, but
any chance for eventual realiza
tion of student power is often
destroyed by students with no
interest in it. It is hardly comi
cal that headlines might have
appeared simultaneously pro
claiming "Stanford Students De
mand More Power" and "Stan
ford Students Elect Topless
Dancer."
The administration cannot be
entirely blamed for frustrating
demands for student power. The

many students who discount, ne
glect, or abuse responsibilty for
the university community de
stroy the chance the others
might have in achieving a basis
for power other than disruption.
I have pointed out several
things which I learned during
the three days of the demonstra
tion; I have neglected much de
tail and even several major as
pects. I certainly do not wish
to suggest that one should in
tentionally cause trouble in order
to learn about it. I do intend to
point out something about the
quality of our education.
Since fall quarter i have
sensed with deep frustration]
the confinements of this aca
demic community; this frus
tration will probably increase
beyond the freshman year. It
sometimes seems that an un
dergraduate education must
necessarily be a moratorium
on learning by experience. Cer
tainly this is a common com
plaint. But during the few
days of the demonstration I
was excited because there were
issues to be faced, action to
be taken, observations to be
made, and an experience to be
gained.
In analyzing and evaluating
what occurred during those three
days, I felt that I was dealing
with something relevant, some
thing that was my own business
rather than another's assign
ment.

By DAN MORROW
Debate over the sit-in dem
onstration of two weeks ago has
been exhaustive; I can contribute
nothing new. But there are sev
eral things that I think the
events surrounding the demon
stration helped me to under
stand and I have attempted to
analyze it in terms of an edu
cational experience.
Certainly I did not involve my
self in the demonstration simply
to learn by it; to participate on
the grounds that one should be
in a demonstration just for the
experience is, of course, very
wrong and foolish.
I was sufficiently convinced
that the demands and tactics
should have been supported.
But I do not think it necessary
to give excuses for using the
demonstration as an educa
tional experience: the situation
held advantages for learning
by . observation and participa
tion.
In several ways, my involve
ment in the demonstration forc
ed me to understand abstrac
tions which might otherwise
have been almost meaningless.
Particularly after my decision to
sign the complicity statement, I
realized more fully what it
meant to make and act upon a
judgment. I had to cope with my
fear of possible consequences.
I painfully recognized the risks
involved in committment — the
possibility of a mistake if only
because the future is unknown.
I had to understand that the
alternatives for action do not
always accommodate the variety
of judgments which might be
made. The abstractions I had en
countered about making choices
became very applicable. Also con
cepts of political progress be
came more meaningful within
the context of the situation. I
understood the inadequacy of
expecting progress to seep into
the system with each passing
hour. Things were not constant
ly changing for the better — in
the university or elsewhere —
and often confrontation of some
sort was necessary for change.
Furthermore, ideas about the
relationship of power and rea
son, which Professor Novak dis
cussed during a seminar at the
sit-in, became very relevant.
" 'Realism' is defined by those

who exercise or defend present
power." Because of the situa
tion, I could more honestly say
"Yes, I understand what that
means." The point is this: no
longer were concepts only aca
demic; ideas became directly rel
evant and, whether or not I ac
cepted them completely, I under
stood how they might apply.

to learn by it; to participate on
the grounds that one should be
in a demonstration just for the
experience is, of course, very
wrong and foolish.
I was sufficiently convinced
that the demands and tactics
should have been supported.
But I do not think it necessary
to give excuses for using the
demonstration as an educa
tional experience: the situation
held advantages for learning
by . observation and participa
tion.
In several ways, my involve
ment in the demonstration forc
ed me to understand abstrac
tions which might otherwise
have been almost meaningless.
Particularly after my decision to
sign the complicity statement, I
realized more fully what it
meant to make and act upon a
judgment. I had to cope with my
fear of possible consequences.
I painfully recognized the risks
involved in committment — the
possibility of a mistake if only
because the future is unknown.
I had to understand that the
alternatives for action do not
always accommodate the variety
of judgments which might be
made. The abstractions I had en
countered about making choices
became very applicable. Also con
cepts of political progress be
came more meaningful within
the context of the situation. I
understood the inadequacy of
expecting progress to seep into
the system with each passing
hour. Things were not constant
ly changing for the better — in
the university or elsewhere —
and often confrontation of some
sort was necessary for change.
Furthermore, ideas about the
relationship of power and rea
son, which Professor Novak dis
cussed during a seminar at the
sit-in, became very relevant.
" 'Realism' is defined by those

who exercise or defend present
power." Because of the situa
tion, I could more honestly say
"Yes, I understand what that
means." The point is this: no
longer were concepts only aca
demic; ideas became directly rel
evant and, whether or not I ac
cepted them completely, I under
stood how they might apply.
During the course of the dem
onstration, I learned something
about the press. Suspicion and
second-hand reports were con
firmed by personal experience. I
expected that the press would
be biased against any student
demonstration, but the blatant
distortion which occurred start
led me. At least one paper sug
gested that 100 students seized
an administration building and
burned the Navy ROTC building.
Other papers were more accur
ate and fair. But generally I
learned by the events of the dem
onstration how little credence
news coverage often deserves.
The demonstration also pro
vided an opportunity to ob
serve aspects of group dyna
mics. All the meetings of the
sit-in were remarkably demo
cratic and well-controlled. It
was Interesting, however, to

observe and experience the ef
fect of a spirit of solidarity
within the group. The leaders
were careful to preserve this
sense of unity and purpose.
The effects of group psychol
ogy, a spirit of adventure, and
devotion to a cause were appar
ent at times. Also the demonstra
tion was a micro-lab for study
ing an internal power struggle
among the leaders. Each pattern
ed his speeches and initiatives in
order to gain greater influence
with the group.
The demonstration also high
lighted for me some of the is
sues pertaining to student power.
In my discussion with others
about the place of the student
in the university, I noticed that
students may be aligned on a
certain spectrum.
At one end, students feel that
they have been accepted by an
institution which will perform
the task of their education if
they will only labor through the
process. These students seldom
worry that their lives and daily
experiences are usually divorced
from their academic pursuit.
They believe it necessary and
righteous to follow the dictates
of the institution.
At the other extreme are
those students who feel that
they are active members of a
university community which
requires their responsibility
and grants their right to affect
it directly. They want to use
the institution to make their
own education. They consider
themselves responsibleto
judge the quality of a course
or the conduct of their peers.
Most students place them
selves near the middle of this
spectrum, as I do. Those who
participated in the sit-in did not
necessarily come from one end
only. Generally, however, the in
terests and expectations of the
students at the extremes of such
an imaginary Spectrum operate
against each other.
The administration may be
receptive to student claims that
they could responsibly exercise
power over affairs involving
their education and conduct, but
any chance for eventual realiza
tion of student power is often
destroyed by students with no
interest in it. It is hardly comi
cal that headlines might have
appeared simultaneously pro
claiming "Stanford Students De
mand More Power" and "Stan
ford Students Elect Topless
Dancer."
The administration cannot be
entirely blamed for frustrating
demands for student power. The

many students who discount, ne
glect, or abuse responsibilty for
the university community de
stroy the chance the others
might have in achieving a basis
for power other than disruption.
I have pointed out several
things which I learned during
the three days of the demonstra
tion; I have neglected much de
tail and even several major as
pects. I certainly do not wish
to suggest that one should in
tentionally cause trouble in order
to learn about it. I do intend to
point out something about the
quality of our education.
Since fall quarter i have
sensed with deep frustration]
the confinements of this aca
demic community; this frus
tration will probably increase
beyond the freshman year. It
sometimes seems that an un
dergraduate education must
necessarily be a moratorium
on learning by experience. Cer
tainly this is a common com
plaint. But during the few
days of the demonstration I
was excited because there were
issues to be faced, action to
be taken, observations to be
made, and an experience to be
gained.
In analyzing and evaluating
what occurred during those three
days, I felt that I was dealing
with something relevant, some
thing that was my own business
rather than another's assign
ment.
