# Pac-8 Roundup
## Golfers Nab Crown 
### 
Stanford's determined varsity
golfers upset heavily favored
USC and captured the Pacific-8
golf championship Saturday at
the Los Angeles country club.
The Indians, building a seven
stroke lead in the first round of
the 72 hole tourney and main
taining it all the way, ended
USC's four-year domination of
the event by a 1194 to 1202 count.
The Trojans had the two low
est scores, but Stanford's con
tingent of Greg Pitzer (296),
Ray Isbell (299), Sandy Adle
man (299) and Rich Harris (300)
snared the third through sixth
positions.
Tribe coach Bud Finger, whose
team was expected to finish sec
ond behind the Trojans, said
"The boys played excellent golf
. . . it was just a magnificent
tournament."
Stanford, which did not play
its best game on the greens, ac
cording to Finger, could have
won by even a larger margin.
Rich Harris suffered a scratched
cornea in practice and had a
weak first nine before bouncing
back to his normal game.
