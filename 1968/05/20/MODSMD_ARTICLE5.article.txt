# Frosh Help Candidates To Work For Change
## 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
While some freshmen are busy
working for change outside the
system as in the Old Union sit
in, others try to effect change
in a more conventional manner:
politics.
About 200 freskman have so
far committed themselves to
working for the two major can
didates in the California Demo
cratic Presidential primary.
Though they differ as to why
they support their candidate,
both the freshmen workers for
Sen. Eugene McCarthy and Sen.
Robert Kennedy agree that they
as individuals can help deter
mine the outcome of the election
and thus help change America.
"Just one person working
for a candidate can reach a
number of voters: I feel that)
I definitely can help Kennedy"
says Don Clark, a Sternfresh
man who is coordinator for
freshmen for the Kennedy
group on campus.
Other students are more ada
ment about what they can do.
John Esbenshade, a Branner res
ident, commented that "Students
can make McCarthy win." In
trying to make Sen. McCarthy
win the California primary, he
and other freshmen have spent
their Saturday's in neighbor
hoods, canvassing for their can
didate.
Mary Kelsey, another Mc-
Carthy advocate, discussed the

two weekends she spent doing
precinct work for the Minnesota
Senator. "A lot of voters haven't
heard about the election. It's im
portant just making a good per
sonal impression on them by
bothering to visit them. It in
duces them to vote for Mc-
Carthy, if they vote, because he's
the only candidate they've heard
about."
The Kennedy and McCarthy
committees on campus both
already have a number of
freshmen working for them.
The Kennedy committee has
about 50 frÂ«*shmen on its lists
and the McCarthy committee
about 150.
However many of those peo
ple have not yet started work
ing actively for the candidates.
Chris Harte of the McCarthy
group predicts that many more
of the frosh will become active
right before the June 1 primary
election.
Some of the freshmen now in
volved in working for candidates
would not have participated in
an election campaign as high
school seniors. Stanford has
changed their attitudes towards
politics.
Mary Kelsey is one freshman
who feels that before coming to
Stanford she would not have
worked for a candidate. "I've
changed because I've come in
contact with people who are con
cerned and I realized that peo

pie I know will bo affected by
the draft. Whoever is elected is
important to nie."
The reasons for this change
in attitude vary. John Esben
shade lists, "Novak (assistant
professor of religion), Napier
(dean of the chapel), the sit-in
(at the Old Union), and just
talking with the older guys."
Phil McDonald, another
freshman dorm representative
for McCarthy, says that his at
titude changed because in
high school he was treated like
a child, and here, he feels, he
is treated like an adult. "I
feel more a part of society
now," he comments.
Don Clark ventures that he
wouldn't have worked for a
Democratic candidate while in
high school. "Stanford has
changed me in that way." He ex
plained his parents are Republi
cans and he wouldn't have
thought of supporting any can
didate but a Republican.
David Jones of the Stanford
Committee for McCarthy praised
the freshmen for the work they
have done so far. "We find that
the Stanford freshman is an ex
tremely effective campaigner:
his enthusiasm and charm sug
gest to voters what they saw
on their television sets from New
Hampshire primary."
Another McCarthy worker re
plied wearily, "Maybe they're
great because they haven't been
corrupted."
