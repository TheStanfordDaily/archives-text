# 'White, Middle Class Stanford"
## Blacks Undergo Difficult Transition 
### JOHN ALCORN 
Many black freshmen at Stan
ford believe that they have spent
their first year in college at an
institution that is based upon
"typical white, upper-middle
class values." This situation has,
in a number of instances, made
these students feel that they
somehow do not "fit into Stan
ford."
Bob Enoex, a freshman living
in Madera, commented that he
was considering leaving Stan
ford during winter quarter. How
ever, he added, "some of the
things that have happened this
quarter—especially the accept
ance of the Black Student Union
demands—have made me feel
that I want to stay and help era
dicate the image the University
has."
Stanford Is "most definitely"
a white, middle-class univer
sity, according to Joy Glenn,
who lives in Itoble. She empha
sized that for the greater part
of this year, "I've felt Tm not
really a part of Stanford. I
thought that Stanford wasn't
reaching me, or else that I
wasn't corning up to par." She
feels that the main reason for
this is her background "as op
posed to the background of the
average white student here."
A freshman living in Branner,

Carolyn Hatchett, believes al
most all students have to under
go different phases and changes
during their freshman year, but
that the main transition for her
has also been coming from the
black community to Stanford.
One thing that particularly an
noys her is that "when you're
seen at Stanford, you're seen as
a black student or as a symbol
rather than a person." She
agreed that "the activities and
programs at Stanford are really
geared for the white middle
class student."
"Unless you're the type of
black student who comes from
a background similar to that of
most whites," Miss Hatchett
pointed out, "you don't feel like
you really fit."
On the other hand, Enoex com
mented, "I don't see anything
wrong with being looked at as a
black—it's something that just
can't be ignored."
Roble resident Ann Alley
claimed that "the only way a
Negro student can be effectual
In the University Is if he does
n't cater to middle class val
ues." She said that she did
not mean to Imply that mid
dle class values aren't all
right for middle class people.
Randy Hill, a Trancos fresh
man from Pittsburgh, opposed

the general attitude expressed
by most blacks. Hill said Stan
ford is "hardly conservative".
While he did say that the Uni
versity "probably is upper mid
dle-class," he asserted that he
was "very pleased" with Stan
ford.
One of the main reasons for
his attitude is that "there is so
much freedom here on campus
to express your opinions without
the threat of being penalized,
as is the case in many schools
back East."
Jan Beene, living in Branner,
voiced the complaint that al
though she came from a middle
class background, she feels just
as strongly as many other Ne
groes here that "blacks aren't
really a part of tno University.
It's hard for me to car. what
the University does outside of
its relations with blacks."
She also said that "you just
can't forget there here you're a
black — it's really impossible.
This isn't based on money or
background, but solely because
you're black."
One of the most Important
things that has happened to
her during her freshman year,
she feels, is that she has be
come "much more aware of my
obligation to other black peo
ple. I've realized that black

people cannot really become*
part of the white community
in the sense of adopting white
standards and being- 'just like
white people.'"
Trancos freshman Richard
Grant contended that "the situ
ation at Stanford for blacks is
not a question of whether they
like it here or not. Stanford rep
resents the utmost in white
middle-class institutions." As
such, he warned that "this typo
of education for blacks is just a
necessity —a convenient means
to an end."
Considering the University as
an educational institution, Miss
Alley expressed her disappoint
ment with the General Studies
program, emphasizing that she
would have preferred to take
other subjects instead of those
required.
Cynthia Hamilton of Serra
said that after completing a
quarter at Stanford she was
surprised to find that "people
here aren't as sensitive or per
ceptive as they'd like to think
they are," adding that in gen
eral "I'm just kind of disillus
ioned by Stanford. Maybe my
expectations were too high."
She also thought "the Uni
versity is ignorant of the real
world because it is such an iso
lated community." She offered

the intern program of the School
of Education as an example
where those connected with the
University do not realize that
they are being trained to "deal
with real people."
Commenting on the Black
Student Union, Miss Glenn said,
"It has definitely accomplished
much positive good, especially
in its demands, which were very
reasonable and necessary."
Miss Alley said that the
BSII has been "most effective
by shocking people into realiz
ing that racism exists in our
own institutions." Miss Hatch
ett has been very pleased with
BSU projects: tutoring in East
Palo Alto, Afro-American Cul
ture Week, anil the new Afro-
American collection of books
in the undergraduate library.
Her main complaint against
the BSU was "those running it
have been here for a long time
and tend to forget that freshmen
have a real transition to make.
The approach used by the BSU
to recruit last fall caused many
black students a lot of grief
because they were almost forced
to join. But in the main the BSU
has been constructive and effec
tive."

claimed that "the only way a

In the University Is if he does

right for middle class people.
Randy Hill, a Trancos fresh
man from Pittsburgh, opposed

the general attitude expressed
by most blacks. Hill said Stan
ford is "hardly conservative".
While he did say that the Uni
versity "probably is upper mid

was "very pleased" with Stan
ford.
One of the main reasons for
his attitude is that "there is so
much freedom here on campus

Jan Beene, living in Branner,
voiced the complaint that al
though she came from a middle
class background, she feels just
as strongly as many other Ne

really a part of tno University.
It's hard for me to car. what
the University does outside of
its relations with blacks."
She also said that "you just
can't forget there here you're a
black — it's really impossible.
This isn't based on money or
background, but solely because
you're black."
One of the most Important
things that has happened to
her during her freshman year,
she feels, is that she has be
come "much more aware of my
obligation to other black peo

people cannot really become*
part of the white community
in the sense of adopting white
standards and being- 'just like
white people.'"
Trancos freshman Richard
Grant contended that "the situ
ation at Stanford for blacks is
not a question of whether they
like it here or not. Stanford rep
resents the utmost in white
middle-class institutions." As
such, he warned that "this typo
of education for blacks is just a
necessity —a convenient means
to an end."
Considering the University as
an educational institution, Miss
Alley expressed her disappoint

program, emphasizing that she
would have preferred to take
other subjects instead of those
required.
Cynthia Hamilton of Serra
said that after completing a

surprised to find that "people
here aren't as sensitive or per

expectations were too high."
She also thought "the Uni
versity is ignorant of the real
world because it is such an iso

the intern program of the School
of Education as an example
where those connected with the
University do not realize that
they are being trained to "deal
with real people."
Commenting on the Black
Student Union, Miss Glenn said,
"It has definitely accomplished
much positive good, especially
in its demands, which were very
reasonable and necessary."
Miss Alley said that the
BSII has been "most effective
by shocking people into realiz
ing that racism exists in our
own institutions." Miss Hatch

BSU projects: tutoring in East
Palo Alto, Afro-American Cul
ture Week, anil the new Afro-
American collection of books
in the undergraduate library.
Her main complaint against
the BSU was "those running it
have been here for a long time
and tend to forget that freshmen
have a real transition to make.
The approach used by the BSU
to recruit last fall caused many
black students a lot of grief
because they were almost forced
to join. But in the main the BSU

Many black freshmen at Stan
ford believe that they have spent
their first year in college at an
institution that is based upon
"typical white, upper-middle

in a number of instances, made
these students feel that they
somehow do not "fit into Stan
ford."
Bob Enoex, a freshman living
in Madera, commented that he
was considering leaving Stan
ford during winter quarter. How
ever, he added, "some of the
things that have happened this

demands—have made me feel
that I want to stay and help era

Stanford Is "most definitely"

thought that Stanford wasn't

feels that the main reason for
this is her background "as op

program, emphasizing that she
would have preferred to take
other subjects instead of those
required.
Cynthia Hamilton of Serra
said that after completing a
quarter at Stanford she was
surprised to find that "people
here aren't as sensitive or per
ceptive as they'd like to think
they are," adding that in gen
eral "I'm just kind of disillus
ioned by Stanford. Maybe my
expectations were too high."
She also thought "the Uni
versity is ignorant of the real
world because it is such an iso
lated community." She offered

the intern program of the School
of Education as an example
where those connected with the
University do not realize that
they are being trained to "deal
with real people."
Commenting on the Black
Student Union, Miss Glenn said,
"It has definitely accomplished
much positive good, especially
in its demands, which were very
reasonable and necessary."
Miss Alley said that the
BSII has been "most effective
by shocking people into realiz
ing that racism exists in our
own institutions." Miss Hatch
ett has been very pleased with
BSU projects: tutoring in East
Palo Alto, Afro-American Cul
ture Week, anil the new Afro-
American collection of books
in the undergraduate library.
Her main complaint against
the BSU was "those running it
have been here for a long time
and tend to forget that freshmen
have a real transition to make.
The approach used by the BSU
to recruit last fall caused many
black students a lot of grief
because they were almost forced
to join. But in the main the BSU
has been constructive and effec
tive."
Many black freshmen at Stan
ford believe that they have spent
their first year in college at an
institution that is based upon
"typical white, upper-middle
class values." This situation has,
in a number of instances, made
these students feel that they
somehow do not "fit into Stan
ford."
Bob Enoex, a freshman living
in Madera, commented that he
was considering leaving Stan
ford during winter quarter. How
ever, he added, "some of the
things that have happened this
quarter—especially the accept
ance of the Black Student Union
demands—have made me feel
that I want to stay and help era
dicate the image the University
has."
Stanford Is "most definitely"
a white, middle-class univer
sity, according to Joy Glenn,
who lives in Itoble. She empha
sized that for the greater part
of this year, "I've felt Tm not
really a part of Stanford. I
thought that Stanford wasn't
reaching me, or else that I
wasn't corning up to par." She
feels that the main reason for
this is her background "as op
posed to the background of the
average white student here."
A freshman living in Branner,

Carolyn Hatchett, believes al
most all students have to under
go different phases and changes
during their freshman year, but
that the main transition for her
has also been coming from the
black community to Stanford.
One thing that particularly an
noys her is that "when you're
seen at Stanford, you're seen as
a black student or as a symbol
rather than a person." She
agreed that "the activities and
programs at Stanford are really
geared for the white middle
class student."
"Unless you're the type of
black student who comes from
a background similar to that of
most whites," Miss Hatchett
pointed out, "you don't feel like
you really fit."
On the other hand, Enoex com
mented, "I don't see anything
wrong with being looked at as a
black—it's something that just
can't be ignored."
Roble resident Ann Alley
claimed that "the only way a
Negro student can be effectual
In the University Is if he does
n't cater to middle class val
ues." She said that she did
not mean to Imply that mid
dle class values aren't all
right for middle class people.
Randy Hill, a Trancos fresh
man from Pittsburgh, opposed

the general attitude expressed
by most blacks. Hill said Stan
ford is "hardly conservative".
While he did say that the Uni
versity "probably is upper mid
dle-class," he asserted that he
was "very pleased" with Stan
ford.
One of the main reasons for
his attitude is that "there is so
much freedom here on campus
to express your opinions without
the threat of being penalized,
as is the case in many schools
back East."
Jan Beene, living in Branner,
voiced the complaint that al
though she came from a middle
class background, she feels just
as strongly as many other Ne
groes here that "blacks aren't
really a part of tno University.
It's hard for me to car. what
the University does outside of
its relations with blacks."
She also said that "you just
can't forget there here you're a
black — it's really impossible.
This isn't based on money or
background, but solely because
you're black."
One of the most Important
things that has happened to
her during her freshman year,
she feels, is that she has be
come "much more aware of my
obligation to other black peo
ple. I've realized that black

people cannot really become*
part of the white community
in the sense of adopting white
standards and being- 'just like
white people.'"
Trancos freshman Richard
Grant contended that "the situ
ation at Stanford for blacks is
not a question of whether they
like it here or not. Stanford rep
resents the utmost in white
middle-class institutions." As
such, he warned that "this typo
of education for blacks is just a
necessity —a convenient means
to an end."
