# From Apathy To Involvement
## 
### 
Whenever students display the slightest lack of concern in their
own affairs or the affairs of the University, they find themselves
staring down the barrels of the guns of apathy. And whether the
faculty, administration, or fellow students pull the trigger, these
"indifferents" are invariably hit square in the face.
Apathy, apathy, apathy — the word has been tossed around
on college campuses ad nauseum. But in view of recent campus
turmoil and student demands across the country, it seems that
the nausea has reached its saturation point.
Students are moving from apathy to involvement, and we
feel this is especially true of freshmen here at Stanford. That's
what today's freshman issue is all about.
It would be ridiculous to say this issue represents the com
posite viewpoint of 1200 freshmen. It doesn't and couldn't. We
are attempting, mainly through the opinions of a handful of fresh
man students, to express this transition from apathy to involve
ment.
And it's just that — a transition. There's a very important middle
step between the two extremes, the step of indecision. Freshmen
are questioning everything that surrounds them, within and with
out, and if they aren't audibly making themselves heard to others,
they are hearing their own selves speak, and that's what counts.
Why the transition this year? Perhaps because at Stanford, in
this country, and around the world, this year has been one of
the most critical in over a decade.
This year holds a Black Students Union-Administration con
frontation which was so crucial that, when BSU demands had
been met, Provost Lyman told the Academic Council "to stand
fast when the inevitable backlash comes from society."
In addition to participating, whether physically or mentally, in
a sit-in which people thought "couldn't happen at Stanford," more
freshman than usual voted last week in a student presidential
election which somehow gained national recognition.
On the outside, freshmen this year saw the withdrawal of
President Johnson from an election campaign which has swept up
many students on campus. This year holds the assassination of
Martin Luther King, Jr., some fourteen history-making heart
transplants, and the beginnings of Vietnam peace talks in Paris.
Such events call for a new awareness, for many, like the na
al election, are a direct cause of the transition to involvement.
It is this awareness which can silence the guns of apathy.
