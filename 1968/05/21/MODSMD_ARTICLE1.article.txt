# Chapel Funds Use Queried
## 
### PATRICK McMAHON 
An East Bay millionaire who
gave Stanford $1.2 million in
1963 to strengthen religious pro
grams on campus "is concerned
about some of the things that
are going on" in the Chapel pro
gram and is considering asking
that his money be used for some
thing else.
Lowell Berry, donor and a
Stanford alumnus, told The
Daily last night, "I have not yet
made any final decision or taken
any action, and I am looking for
ward to a meeting in the near
future."
Berry's concern about the
Chapel program was expressed
in a February letter to a mem
ber at the Stanford administra
tion.
In that letter, he expressed dis
satisfaction with Dean of the
Chapel B. Davie Napier and reli
gian professors Robert McAfee
Brown and Michael Novak.
Berry suggested that the up
coming meeting would include
Sterling and several trustees
"whom I have known for, a long
time."

Meanwhile, the President's
Committee on Religious Activi
ties is preparing a report for
the trustees on the first two
years of religious worship on
campus. It is being written at
the request of the Provost.
The report will summarize the
changes in religious activity on
campus since the trustee decision
in February 1966, to allow wor
ship on the campus. Previously,
no sectarian worship was per
mitted on campus.
Kenneth Cuthbertson, vice
president for finance, said yes
terday that redirection at the
donor's request of funds already
donated for a specific purpose
has no precedent in Stanford's
gift program.
He said that if Berry should
ask that the funds be redirected,
the trustees would decide wheth
er to grant the request or not.
