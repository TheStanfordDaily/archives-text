Dear Arthur:
Life is really exciting. I'm sure
you've heard about all thr idiot.s
arid strikes here in France. It
seems like everyone is seizing
something a factory, a uni
versity or a radio station. They
tried to seize our chatcau last
week, but we fought them off.
They did take both our color
television sets, though, and I
don't know what we'd do around
here if Jack Bland didn't have a
black and white portable TV his
uncle gave him as a bon voyage
present. We watch all the Amer
ican movies on TV the French
subtitles are hilarious.
But I want to tell you about
the seige. When the revolution
started, the Communists in
Tours got the workers and stu
dents really incensed about Viet
nam and Black Power. They
wanted to do something anti-
American, so naturally they
picked on us.
First they set up a Language
Barrier. A crowd of students sur
rounded the chateau and said
they wouldn't let anybody out
unless he could speak three sen
tences of intelligible French.
Well, you know we don't get
much practice in French since
all our classes here are in En
glish. So nobody could get past
the Language Barrier. Once we
had a girl in the group who
spoke exquisite French, but she
ran away to Paris last month
and hasn't come back. She said
some nasty things to us about
insulation from a foreign culture
and said that besides, we were
ruining her accent.

Anyway, the next day a big
crowd of French marched on th ->
chateau, shouting "Johnson As
sassin" and burning American
flags. Almost none of us like
LBJ, but some of the fraternity
guys thought we should stick
up for our flag. So they shot
some balloons full of red paint
at the crowd. Then those Frogs
really got mad. We were just
lucky all the doors were locked.
The French seized all our cars.
And do you know what? They
didn't drive the cars away, not
even Jack Bland's new Pontiac
Firebird. Instead they burned
them. These French are really
crazy.
After that nobody could get
in or out of the chateau. The
mob cut off our electricity and
water, but that didn't hurt at all.
Last time Dr. Walker was out
here he said we should be ready
for trouble and he had a gen
erator installed and a well dug,
so we had our own electricity
and water supply which tasted
better than the Tours water. But
we couldn't get any food from
Tours. Our deep freeze was al
most empty when a U-2 or some
thing from the U.S. air base in
Spain parachuted in some big
boxes full of TV dinners.
Just Like Home
So life stayed normal — just
like home, even though we
couldn't go into town anymore
to pick up our copies of Time
magazine and the Daily. Since
the French wouldn't let us out,
we had to call off our field trip
last weekend. That really burn
ed me — we had planned to real
ly broaden our cultural horizons
with that trip. Besides the

Louvre, Versailles, and the Eif
fel Tower, we were going to
spend hours and hours just sit
ting at a Paris street cafe and
engaging in serious political dia
logues with Parisiennes. But we
couldn't go to Paris and some
guys who wanted to drive to the
Riviera for the weekend couldn't
get away either.
Eye-Opener
Professor Drone says that be
ing in the midst of a social revo
lution should be one of the most
eye-opening experiences of our
lives. He says that reading Vol
taire in our French Lit class will
heighten our understanding,
even though it's an English
translation.
So despite the fact that I miss
ed out on the trip to Paris, I'm
convinced my overseas experi
ence is going to be one of the
most broadening times of my
life.
How are things at the Farm?
LOVE, JANE
