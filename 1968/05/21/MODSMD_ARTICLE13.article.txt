## Firemen Ignore Peril In Frost 
### 
Oh Stanford Fire Department,
where were you when the lights
went out at Frost Sunday night?
Snug in your own fire trap on
Santa Theresa, was it too much
trouble to respond to our request
for assistance? Aren't we all
fortunate that we didn't finally
need you? But, what if we had?
For those of you who weren't
in Frost for Sunday's 27th An
nual Spring Sing, let me try to
explain what the situation was.
About 25 minutes after the show
began two of the circuit break
ers controlling power for the
follow spots heated up and gave
out. A quick investigation indi

cated that the two breakers were
beyond repair and that it was
just a matter of time before the
breakers controlling power for
the stage floods would also give
way.
Faced with the possibility of
losing all the lights in the Amphi
theater, the light crew decided
to try and cross-tie two circuits
for every one that was being
used. This attempt proved im
possible since each circuit in
Frost is on a different phase
and no two circuits could be
found on which the phases
matched.
By this time it was intermis

sion and the light crew decided
that the only thing to do was to
bypass the defective circuit
breakers and hotwire the four
affected circuits directly into
the master circuit breaker for
the Amphitheater. The technique
involved is similar to that used
when hotwiring an automobile.
There was of course a cer
tain amount of danger involved
in following this course of ac
tion, to wit, with all lighting in
struments wired directly through
the master circuit breaker any
dead short, anywhere in the sys
tem, would have blown the
master breaker, killing all pow
er.
Of course, if all the power
were to fail, not only would there
have been no lights, there would
also have been no sound. The
light crew was, therefore, faced
with the prospect of having 4,500
people suddenly plunged into
darkness with no means of in
forming them as to what was
going on. You don't have to be
a psych major to know what
one scream would have done
under those circumstances.
With the possibility of a pan
icked crowd well in mind, tho
members of the light crew had
Mike Heathman of KZSU call
the Stanford Fire Department
and request that one man be dis
patched with two fire extinguish
ers, a bullhorn, and some emer
gency auxiliary lights. Heathman
was told by the duty officer that
a man was on the way out.
Heathman gave the duty officer
exact instructions on how to
find those members of the light
crew who knew what the prob
lem was. The light crew waited
right where they said they
would. No fireman ever showed
up.
After waiting about 20 min
utes one member of the light
crew went down to the main
exit of the Amphitheater and en
countered a patrolman from the
Stanford Police Department.
He asked the patrolman if he had
seen anybody from the Fire De
partment. The officer replied that
he had, that fireman had gone
into the Amphitheater, had come
out after a few minutes, and
had left. Later investigation re
vealed that the fireman who re
sponded to the call was in fact

the second assistant chief of the
Fire Department. The only per
son who ever saw him at Frost,
however, was the patrolman on
duty at the gate.
Approximately one hour after
Heathman called the Fire De
partment, a University electri
cian appeared on the scene. He
told the light crew that he had
been called by the Fire Depart
ment. After looking over the
jury-rigged electrical system, he
agreed with the light crew that
they had a potentially dangerous
system and that there was noth
ing more that h > could do about
it. He commented that he
thought having the Fire Depart
ment on hand was a good idea.
Apparently everybody con
cerned thought that it might tv
a good idea if the Fire Depart
ment were on hand; everybody,
that is, except the second assis
tant chief who didn't even at
tempt to find out what the prob
lem was, or whether it presented
any danger to the 4,500 people
attending the show.
It seems that a few sugges
tions are in order. First, if you
are in need of assistance don't
bother to call the Stanford Fire
Department. There is a Palo
Alto stationhouse on Hanover
that can respond equally as fast
and they have a Civil Defense
disaster unit attached to the reg
ular complement of men. Second,
rewire Frost Amphitheater in a
safer and saner manner. Third,
install an emergency electrical
system in Frost and make sure
that it works. Fourth, make sure
that emergency electrical sys
tems in all other auditoriums
on campus work. Fifth, do it
yourself; no one else is con
cerned.

trouble to respond to our request
for assistance? Aren't we all
fortunate that we didn't finally
need you? But, what if we had?
For those of you who weren't
in Frost for Sunday's 27th An
nual Spring Sing, let me try to
explain what the situation was.
About 25 minutes after the show
began two of the circuit break
ers controlling power for the
follow spots heated up and gave
out. A quick investigation indi

cated that the two breakers were
beyond repair and that it was
just a matter of time before the
breakers controlling power for
the stage floods would also give
way.
Faced with the possibility of
losing all the lights in the Amphi
theater, the light crew decided
to try and cross-tie two circuits
for every one that was being
used. This attempt proved im
possible since each circuit in
Frost is on a different phase
and no two circuits could be
found on which the phases
matched.
By this time it was intermis

sion and the light crew decided
that the only thing to do was to
bypass the defective circuit
breakers and hotwire the four
affected circuits directly into
the master circuit breaker for
the Amphitheater. The technique
involved is similar to that used
when hotwiring an automobile.
There was of course a cer
tain amount of danger involved
in following this course of ac
tion, to wit, with all lighting in
struments wired directly through
the master circuit breaker any
dead short, anywhere in the sys
tem, would have blown the
master breaker, killing all pow
er.
Of course, if all the power
were to fail, not only would there
have been no lights, there would
also have been no sound. The
light crew was, therefore, faced
with the prospect of having 4,500
people suddenly plunged into
darkness with no means of in
forming them as to what was
going on. You don't have to be
a psych major to know what
one scream would have done
under those circumstances.
With the possibility of a pan
icked crowd well in mind, tho
members of the light crew had
Mike Heathman of KZSU call
the Stanford Fire Department
and request that one man be dis
patched with two fire extinguish
ers, a bullhorn, and some emer
gency auxiliary lights. Heathman
was told by the duty officer that
a man was on the way out.
Heathman gave the duty officer
exact instructions on how to
find those members of the light
crew who knew what the prob
lem was. The light crew waited
right where they said they
would. No fireman ever showed
up.
After waiting about 20 min
utes one member of the light
crew went down to the main
exit of the Amphitheater and en
countered a patrolman from the
Stanford Police Department.
He asked the patrolman if he had
seen anybody from the Fire De
partment. The officer replied that
he had, that fireman had gone
into the Amphitheater, had come
out after a few minutes, and
had left. Later investigation re
vealed that the fireman who re
sponded to the call was in fact

the second assistant chief of the
Fire Department. The only per
son who ever saw him at Frost,
however, was the patrolman on
duty at the gate.
Approximately one hour after
Heathman called the Fire De
partment, a University electri
cian appeared on the scene. He
told the light crew that he had
been called by the Fire Depart
ment. After looking over the
jury-rigged electrical system, he
agreed with the light crew that
they had a potentially dangerous
system and that there was noth
ing more that h > could do about
it. He commented that he
thought having the Fire Depart
ment on hand was a good idea.
Apparently everybody con
cerned thought that it might tv
a good idea if the Fire Depart
ment were on hand; everybody,
that is, except the second assis
tant chief who didn't even at
tempt to find out what the prob
lem was, or whether it presented
any danger to the 4,500 people
attending the show.
It seems that a few sugges
tions are in order. First, if you
are in need of assistance don't
bother to call the Stanford Fire
Department. There is a Palo
Alto stationhouse on Hanover
that can respond equally as fast
and they have a Civil Defense
disaster unit attached to the reg
ular complement of men. Second,
rewire Frost Amphitheater in a
safer and saner manner. Third,
install an emergency electrical
system in Frost and make sure
that it works. Fourth, make sure
that emergency electrical sys
tems in all other auditoriums
on campus work. Fifth, do it
yourself; no one else is con
cerned.

in Frost for Sunday's 27th An
nual Spring Sing, let me try to
explain what the situation was.
About 25 minutes after the show
began two of the circuit break
ers controlling power for the
follow spots heated up and gave
out. A quick investigation indi

cated that the two breakers were
beyond repair and that it was
just a matter of time before the
breakers controlling power for
the stage floods would also give
way.
Faced with the possibility of
losing all the lights in the Amphi
theater, the light crew decided
to try and cross-tie two circuits
for every one that was being
used. This attempt proved im
possible since each circuit in
Frost is on a different phase
and no two circuits could be
found on which the phases
matched.
By this time it was intermis

sion and the light crew decided
that the only thing to do was to
bypass the defective circuit
breakers and hotwire the four
affected circuits directly into
the master circuit breaker for
the Amphitheater. The technique
involved is similar to that used
when hotwiring an automobile.
There was of course a cer
tain amount of danger involved
in following this course of ac
tion, to wit, with all lighting in
struments wired directly through
the master circuit breaker any
dead short, anywhere in the sys
tem, would have blown the
master breaker, killing all pow
er.
Of course, if all the power
were to fail, not only would there
have been no lights, there would
also have been no sound. The
light crew was, therefore, faced
with the prospect of having 4,500
people suddenly plunged into
darkness with no means of in
forming them as to what was
going on. You don't have to be
a psych major to know what
one scream would have done
under those circumstances.
With the possibility of a pan
icked crowd well in mind, tho
members of the light crew had
Mike Heathman of KZSU call
the Stanford Fire Department
and request that one man be dis
patched with two fire extinguish
ers, a bullhorn, and some emer
gency auxiliary lights. Heathman
was told by the duty officer that
a man was on the way out.
Heathman gave the duty officer
exact instructions on how to
find those members of the light
crew who knew what the prob
lem was. The light crew waited
right where they said they
would. No fireman ever showed
up.
After waiting about 20 min
utes one member of the light
crew went down to the main
exit of the Amphitheater and en
countered a patrolman from the
Stanford Police Department.
He asked the patrolman if he had
seen anybody from the Fire De
partment. The officer replied that
he had, that fireman had gone
into the Amphitheater, had come
out after a few minutes, and
had left. Later investigation re
vealed that the fireman who re
sponded to the call was in fact

the second assistant chief of the
Fire Department. The only per
son who ever saw him at Frost,
however, was the patrolman on
duty at the gate.
Approximately one hour after
Heathman called the Fire De
partment, a University electri
cian appeared on the scene. He
told the light crew that he had
been called by the Fire Depart
ment. After looking over the
jury-rigged electrical system, he
agreed with the light crew that
they had a potentially dangerous
system and that there was noth
ing more that h > could do about
it. He commented that he
thought having the Fire Depart
ment on hand was a good idea.
Apparently everybody con
cerned thought that it might tv
a good idea if the Fire Depart
ment were on hand; everybody,
that is, except the second assis
tant chief who didn't even at
tempt to find out what the prob
lem was, or whether it presented
any danger to the 4,500 people
attending the show.
It seems that a few sugges
tions are in order. First, if you
are in need of assistance don't
bother to call the Stanford Fire
Department. There is a Palo
Alto stationhouse on Hanover
that can respond equally as fast
and they have a Civil Defense
disaster unit attached to the reg
ular complement of men. Second,
rewire Frost Amphitheater in a
safer and saner manner. Third,
install an emergency electrical
system in Frost and make sure
that it works. Fourth, make sure
that emergency electrical sys
tems in all other auditoriums
on campus work. Fifth, do it
yourself; no one else is con
cerned.

Oh Stanford Fire Department,
where were you when the lights
went out at Frost Sunday night?
Snug in your own fire trap on
Santa Theresa, was it too much
trouble to respond to our request
for assistance? Aren't we all
fortunate that we didn't finally
need you? But, what if we had?
