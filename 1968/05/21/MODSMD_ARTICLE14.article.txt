# Thinclads Dead Last As Only Three Indians Place
## 
### 
Stanford's thinclads, hurt by
two key injuries, finished dead
last in the Pac-8 track and field
championships at Berkeley Sat
urday, won by the University of
Southern California.
Earl (The Pearl) McCullouch
and Lennox Miller sparked the
Trajons to victory, as McCul
louch won the long jump and the
120 high hurdles, Miller took
both the 11 and 220 yard dashes,
and both ran legs on the win
ning 440 yard relay team.
The injured Indians were
high jumper Peter Boyce and
javelin thrower Tom Colby.
Colby, who won his event at
the West Coast Relays in Fres
no the week before with a heave
of 258'4Vt", the best collegiate
throw this year, was suffering
from a groin injury.
In his three qualifying throws,
Colby fouled twice and could

only manage a toss of 159' on his
last try.
Boyce, still suffering from a
knee injury, finished third in
the high jump, by clearing 6-
10. Boyce has not reached the
seven-foot mark since March
29, when he went 7-3 against
Fresno State. That jump still
rates as the best of 1968.
Greg Brock took a fine fourth
for the Indians in the three mile,
after holding second place for
most of the race. Brock stuck
close to winner Gerry Lindgren
for the first 10 laps of the gruel
ing event, but USC's Ole Oleson
and Oregon's Norm Trerise over
took the tiring sophomore on the
final two laps.
Lan Arnold was the only other
Indian who placed, grabbing sec
ond in the triple jump with a
leap of 50-6.
