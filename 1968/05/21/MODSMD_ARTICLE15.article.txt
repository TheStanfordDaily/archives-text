# Netmen Bounce Cal For Third In Pac-8
## 
### GARY CAVALLI 
The road to the top of the
Pacific-8 tennis laddes may be
shortening for Coach Dick
Gould's Stanford varsity.
The Indians took third in the
conference last week by, virtue
of a surprisingly easy 7-2 win
over California. The only two
teams finishing ahead of Stan
ford were USC and UCLA, the
top-ranking net squads in the
nation.
Earlier in the season, the
Bears had finished ahead of the
Tribe in the Northern Califor
nia Intercollegiates and won a
5-4 meet on the Indian courts.
But the gradually - improving
Stanford contingent got revenge
by turning the tables on Cal and
taking a 5-4 decision on the Berk
eley courts, and also finishing
ahead of the Bears at the Ojai
Intercollegiate Tournament.
Both teams had relatively easy
matches in the opening round of
the Pac-8 tournament Thursday,
as Stanford whipped Washing
ton 7-2 and Cal toppled OSU 6-3.
Friday UCLA beat the Indians
6-3 and USC dumped Cal 7-2,
sending Gould's crew into the
battle for third place with their
rivals from Berkeley.
Chuck Darley won the first
singles over Stanford's John
Spiegel, but the Indians took
the next three matches as Dean
Schlobohm upset Mike Gilfil
lin, Rob Rippner edged Corky
Meinhardt, and Chuck Alloo
bounced Bob Waldman, 6-3, 6-4.

Gary Hippensteil gave Cal re
newed life by taking Rick Reed
in throe sets, but captain Brad
Cornell provided the Indians
with a 4-2 lead going into the
doubles by stopping Dennis Carl
ston 6-4, 6-3.
Spiegel and Rippner quickly
dispelled any hopes Cal had for
a comeback win by upsetting the
combo of Darley and Meinhardt
9-7, 10-8. Alloo and Jamie Carroll
followed with a triumph over
Gilfillin and Waldman, and the
Schlobohm - Cafnell duo locked
the match up with an easy 6-4,
6-0 win over Hippensteil and
Greg Olson.
Coach Gould was especially
pleased with the performance of
Spiegel and Rippner, who pull
ed another major upset Friday
by beating UCLA's top doubles
team, Roy Barth and Steve Tid
ball, 6-4, 15-13.
With only one graduating se
nior on this year's team (Reed),
Gould is optimistic about the
Tribe future. Spiegel and Rip
pner are only sophomores, while
Schlobohm, Alloo and Cornell are
juniors. Frosh sensation Stan
Pasarell will be eligible for var
sity competition next year.

Schlobohm - Cafnell duo locked
the match up with an easy 6-4,
6-0 win over Hippensteil and
Greg Olson.
Coach Gould was especially
pleased with the performance of
Spiegel and Rippner, who pull
ed another major upset Friday
by beating UCLA's top doubles
team, Roy Barth and Steve Tid
ball, 6-4, 15-13.
With only one graduating se
nior on this year's team (Reed),
Gould is optimistic about the
Tribe future. Spiegel and Rip
pner are only sophomores, while
Schlobohm, Alloo and Cornell are
juniors. Frosh sensation Stan
Pasarell will be eligible for var
sity competition next year.
The road to the top of the
Pacific-8 tennis laddes may be
shortening for Coach Dick
Gould's Stanford varsity.
The Indians took third in the
conference last week by, virtue
of a surprisingly easy 7-2 win
over California. The only two
teams finishing ahead of Stan
ford were USC and UCLA, the
top-ranking net squads in the
nation.
Earlier in the season, the
Bears had finished ahead of the
Tribe in the Northern Califor
nia Intercollegiates and won a
5-4 meet on the Indian courts.
But the gradually - improving
Stanford contingent got revenge
by turning the tables on Cal and
taking a 5-4 decision on the Berk
eley courts, and also finishing
ahead of the Bears at the Ojai
Intercollegiate Tournament.
Both teams had relatively easy
matches in the opening round of
the Pac-8 tournament Thursday,
as Stanford whipped Washing
ton 7-2 and Cal toppled OSU 6-3.
Friday UCLA beat the Indians
6-3 and USC dumped Cal 7-2,
sending Gould's crew into the
battle for third place with their
rivals from Berkeley.
Chuck Darley won the first
singles over Stanford's John
Spiegel, but the Indians took
the next three matches as Dean
Schlobohm upset Mike Gilfil
lin, Rob Rippner edged Corky
Meinhardt, and Chuck Alloo
bounced Bob Waldman, 6-3, 6-4.

Gary Hippensteil gave Cal re
newed life by taking Rick Reed
in throe sets, but captain Brad
Cornell provided the Indians
with a 4-2 lead going into the
doubles by stopping Dennis Carl
ston 6-4, 6-3.
Spiegel and Rippner quickly
dispelled any hopes Cal had for
a comeback win by upsetting the
combo of Darley and Meinhardt
9-7, 10-8. Alloo and Jamie Carroll
followed with a triumph over
Gilfillin and Waldman, and the
Schlobohm - Cafnell duo locked
the match up with an easy 6-4,
6-0 win over Hippensteil and
Greg Olson.
