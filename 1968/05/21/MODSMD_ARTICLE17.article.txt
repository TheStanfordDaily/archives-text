# Laxmen Clinch Title With Lackluster Wins
## 
### 
The Stanford lacrosse team
emerged from a weekend double
header still undefeated and the
Northern California Lacrosse As
sociation champions, but they
did the job the hard way.
In the Saturday contest
against a talented Palo Alto La
crosse Club team Stanford mid
fielder Chris Rafferty took the
ball at the defensive end of the
field, dodged two men at the re
straining line, churned past two
more at the midfield line, and
plunged into a forest of Palo
Alto defense sticks to cap a
phenomenal sixty yard sprint

with a goal for a 7-6 Stanford
victory and the league champ
ionship.
Rafferty scored his goal
with thirty seconds left on the
clock. It was the only time in
the game that the Indians
held the lead, and it happened
to be the right time.
Apparently the Indians didn't
learn their lesson for the Sun
day game against the less talent
ed Marin County Lacrosse Club.
Defenseman Dennis McNeeley
had to turn on a sprint into of
fensive territory to feed Mark
Teeter, who bounced a shot off
the Marin goalie Dick Tread
well, took the rebound and scor
ed to tie the game with fifty
eight seconds left and send it into
overtime.
The Indians played some out
rageously bad lacrosse in both
contests. They were held score
less throughout the first thirty
four minutes of play against
Palo Alto while the Palo Altans
were scoring four goals.
In the Marine game Stanford
took 59 shots in regulation play
to hit on only four. Marin goalie
Treadwell made a phenomenal
thirty-three saves.
But the Indians also proved
what they could do when they
concentrated on lacrosse. They
scored seven goals against
Palo Alto in the last twenty
six minutes, five of them In
man-up situations and four
of them by Dirk Speas.
In a more concentrated effort,
the Indians scored six goals in
the ten minutes of overtime
against Marin to make the final
score 10-6.
The key to the Palo Alto at
tack was the magic stick of
Bruce Llyod, who scored five of
the club's six goals.
