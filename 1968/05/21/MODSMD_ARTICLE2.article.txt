# Constitution Invalidated
## 
### 
In two decisions last night the
proposed ASSU Constitution was
first ratified and then declared
invalid.
The student judicial council
ruled in the first case that ab
stentions should not be counted
as votes in determining wheth
er a proposition receives the ne
cessary two-thirds vote.
Elections commissioner Craig
Brown had earlier ruled that
blank ballots would count in de
termining whether the necessary
vote had been obtained.
The proposed constitution, by
laws and charter would all be
enacted under the terms of the
decision.
However, the ASSU Violations
Investigation Committee later
ruled that the measures had not
been adopted because they had
not been printed in the Daily
two times in the week preced
ing the election as the ASSU Con
stitution requires.
The text of the two decisions
follows.
Judicial Council Ruling
"Article VII, Section 4, of the
ASSU Constitution, which reads
as follows:
Two-thirds of the votes cast
by members of the Association
on the proposed amendments
and the approval of the Pres
ident of the University shall
be required for adoption,
is interpreted to mean that two
thirds of the sum of the "yeses"
and "noes" cast by members of
the Association on the proposi
tion in question and the ap
proval of the President of the
University shall be required for
adoption.
Committee Ruling
"It is the ruling of the ASSU
Violations Investigation Commit
tee that the proposed new Con
stitution is not accepted for the
reason that the proposed amend
ment, together with the part of
the old Constitution affected
thereby, was not published in
the Stanford Daily on at least
two separate days during the
week prior to election day, as
required by Article VII, Section
3 of the ASSU Constitution."

The latter ruling may be ap
pealed to the student judicial
council.
