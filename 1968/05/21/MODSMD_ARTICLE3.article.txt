# 'Dialogue' Between Radicals, Rightists
## 
### 
The Stanford chapter of the
Young Americans for Freedom
(YAF) is sponsoring a conser
vative - radical dialogue on con
temporary issues today at 4:15
p.m. in Dinkelspiel.
Entitled "Would You Want
Your Sister to Marry a Liberal?",
the program will include two
student activists. Steve Weiss
man and Harvey H. Hukari, Jr.,
and two college journalists,
David Ransom and Brien Ben
son.
The intent of the program,
according to YAF President Har
vey H. Hukari, Jr., is to explore
the similarity of conservative
and radical thought on campus
and national issues and "to ex
pose bankruptcy of creativity in
contemporary liberalism."
The program is not intended
to be a debate, but will rather

encourage a maximum of audi
ence participation.
Chuck Bell, former head of
the Political Union and current
president of the Western Poli
tical Society, will serve as mod
erator.
Weissman was formerly ac
tive in Students for Democratic
Society and the Free Speech
Movement at Berkeley.
Ransom is editor of the "Mid
peninsula Observer" and serves
as an English TA at Stanford.
Hukari was recently a candi
date for ASSU president and is
a columnist for the Daily and
"Arena."
Benson is a graduate of Har
vard and is currently a student
in the Graduate School of Busi
ness. He is editor of the "Arena"
and was active in organizing that
paper.
