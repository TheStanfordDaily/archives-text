# Sterling Raps Sit-Ins At Alum Conference
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
It is necessary that students,
faculty, and administrators adopt
rules that "reject coercion as a
means to an end" President Wal
lace Sterling said Saturday.
Sterling's remarks, which were
part of the day-long Campus
Conference for 2500 alumni and
friends of Stanford, were a de
parture from the usual address
that he has delivered in the past
at the annual program.
Sterling noted that both the
student body in the recent elec
tions and the Board of Trustees
at their Thursday meeting had
"declared themselves against co
ercive tactics."
"It is not yet as clear, as I
feel confident it will soon be
come, where the faculty stands
on this particular issue," Ster
ling said.
Sterling drew extended ap
plause from the alumni when he
pointed that the American Asso
ciation of University Professors
(AAUP) had adopted a resolu
tion condemning the participa
tion of individual faculty mem
bers in "demonstrations which
disrupt educational activities of
academic institutions" at its an
nual meeting two weeks ago.
After discussing those men
who had preceeded him as presi
dent and noting the change in
emphasis on education during
his term of office, Sterling spent
the major part of his speech at
tempting to answer alumni pro
tests that he had received as a
result of the Old Union sit-in.
The charges of capitulation
on his part are "unimpressive!
and unconvincing/' Sterling
said.
Although he "did not favor the
majority faculty vote" of the
Academic Council, Sterling said
that his decision not to disregard
it was based on "confidence that
the great majority of students
and faculty on this campus dis
approve of coercive tactics and
will make that disapproval
known."
"What was at stake," Sterling
said in regard to accepting the
recommendations, "was the op
portunity to avoid a polarized
and bitterly divided house from
which constructive recovery
would have been difficult and
long."
On the national scene, Ster
ling said that disruptions on col
lege and university campuses
have seriously undermined pub
lic confidence in higher educa
tion.
"It is mandatory that con

fidence be restored," Sterling
said. "Otherwise both higher
education and the nation will
suffer. That restoration is a
task for the entire University
community."
Sterling took note of a num
ber of changes which are involv
ed In this "restoration" at Stan
ford.
Repeating an earlier statement
to the student body, Sterling
said that "general rules of con
duct, such as Fundamental Stan
dards, much be supplemented or
replaced by a codification of
rules."
"There must be a judicial sys
tem, which, with appropriate re
gard to due process, will indeed
serve and act judicially, and
will apply appropriate penalties,"
Sterling added.
Sterling also referred to the
Academic Senate, which was ap
proved by the TYustees Thurs
day, as holding "high promise of
affording needed improvement of
communication between faculty
and the officers of the Univer
sity."
The actions of the faculty
during the sit-in came under
even further attack from some
of the alumni attending the con
ference.
The class of 1918, which cele
brated its fiftieth reunion over
the weekend, requested a ses
sion with University officials to
register some of their com
plaints.

According to Cylde Cook, who
organized the session for mem
bers of his class, biographical
statements received prior to the
conference were split about 50-50
between "Stanford in going to
hell" and "Stanford is great."
The approximately 100 alumni
present met Cook's question of
whether they no longer took
pride in Stanford with unani
mous statements of "no. no. no."
One alumnus summed up what
appeared to be the general
opinion of those with a "50
year perspective:
"I don't think that the adminis
tration should be afraid of the
faculty, although they may be
difficult at times."
Another alumnus noted that
"the faculty does have a ten
dency to regard the university
as theirs."
One suggested plan to deal
with the possibility of future
sit-ins was to see that there was
a "minimum of leftist radicals"
admitted as graduate or transfer
students or selected as faculty
members.
At the same time, alumni were
surprised to learn that the rec
ommended suspensions had been
handed down by an all faculty
body.
"When we were here, the stu
dent council was all students,"
one alumnus said. "I know, be
cause they suspended me."
The trustees also received
some advice.

mous statements of "no. no. no."
One alumnus summed up what
appeared to be the general
opinion of those with a "50
year perspective:
"I don't think that the adminis
tration should be afraid of the
faculty, although they may be
difficult at times."
Another alumnus noted that
"the faculty does have a ten
dency to regard the university
as theirs."
One suggested plan to deal
with the possibility of future
sit-ins was to see that there was
a "minimum of leftist radicals"
admitted as graduate or transfer
students or selected as faculty
members.
At the same time, alumni were
surprised to learn that the rec
ommended suspensions had been
handed down by an all faculty
body.
"When we were here, the stu
dent council was all students,"
one alumnus said. "I know, be
cause they suspended me."
The trustees also received
some advice.
It is necessary that students,
faculty, and administrators adopt
rules that "reject coercion as a
means to an end" President Wal
lace Sterling said Saturday.
Sterling's remarks, which were
part of the day-long Campus
Conference for 2500 alumni and
friends of Stanford, were a de
parture from the usual address
that he has delivered in the past
at the annual program.
Sterling noted that both the
student body in the recent elec
tions and the Board of Trustees
at their Thursday meeting had
"declared themselves against co
ercive tactics."
"It is not yet as clear, as I
feel confident it will soon be
come, where the faculty stands
on this particular issue," Ster
ling said.
Sterling drew extended ap
plause from the alumni when he
pointed that the American Asso
ciation of University Professors
(AAUP) had adopted a resolu
tion condemning the participa
tion of individual faculty mem
bers in "demonstrations which
disrupt educational activities of
academic institutions" at its an
nual meeting two weeks ago.
After discussing those men
who had preceeded him as presi
dent and noting the change in
emphasis on education during
his term of office, Sterling spent
the major part of his speech at
tempting to answer alumni pro
tests that he had received as a
result of the Old Union sit-in.
The charges of capitulation
on his part are "unimpressive!
and unconvincing/' Sterling
said.
Although he "did not favor the
majority faculty vote" of the
Academic Council, Sterling said
that his decision not to disregard
it was based on "confidence that
the great majority of students
and faculty on this campus dis
approve of coercive tactics and
will make that disapproval
known."
"What was at stake," Sterling
said in regard to accepting the
recommendations, "was the op
portunity to avoid a polarized
and bitterly divided house from
which constructive recovery
would have been difficult and
long."
On the national scene, Ster
ling said that disruptions on col
lege and university campuses
have seriously undermined pub
lic confidence in higher educa
tion.
"It is mandatory that con

fidence be restored," Sterling
said. "Otherwise both higher
education and the nation will
suffer. That restoration is a
task for the entire University
community."
Sterling took note of a num
ber of changes which are involv
ed In this "restoration" at Stan
ford.
Repeating an earlier statement
to the student body, Sterling
said that "general rules of con
duct, such as Fundamental Stan
dards, much be supplemented or
replaced by a codification of
rules."
"There must be a judicial sys
tem, which, with appropriate re
gard to due process, will indeed
serve and act judicially, and
will apply appropriate penalties,"
Sterling added.
Sterling also referred to the
Academic Senate, which was ap
proved by the TYustees Thurs
day, as holding "high promise of
affording needed improvement of
communication between faculty
and the officers of the Univer
sity."
The actions of the faculty
during the sit-in came under
even further attack from some
of the alumni attending the con
ference.
The class of 1918, which cele
brated its fiftieth reunion over
the weekend, requested a ses
sion with University officials to
register some of their com
plaints.

According to Cylde Cook, who
organized the session for mem
bers of his class, biographical
statements received prior to the
conference were split about 50-50
between "Stanford in going to
hell" and "Stanford is great."
The approximately 100 alumni
present met Cook's question of
whether they no longer took
pride in Stanford with unani
mous statements of "no. no. no."

Academic Senate, which was ap
proved by the TYustees Thurs
day, as holding "high promise of
affording needed improvement of
communication between faculty
and the officers of the Univer
sity."
The actions of the faculty
during the sit-in came under
even further attack from some
of the alumni attending the con
ference.
The class of 1918, which cele
brated its fiftieth reunion over
the weekend, requested a ses
sion with University officials to
register some of their com
plaints.

According to Cylde Cook, who
organized the session for mem
bers of his class, biographical
statements received prior to the
conference were split about 50-50
between "Stanford in going to
hell" and "Stanford is great."
The approximately 100 alumni
present met Cook's question of
whether they no longer took
pride in Stanford with unani
mous statements of "no. no. no."
One alumnus summed up what
appeared to be the general
opinion of those with a "50
year perspective:
"I don't think that the adminis
tration should be afraid of the
faculty, although they may be
difficult at times."
Another alumnus noted that
"the faculty does have a ten
dency to regard the university
as theirs."
One suggested plan to deal
with the possibility of future
sit-ins was to see that there was
a "minimum of leftist radicals"
admitted as graduate or transfer
students or selected as faculty
members.
At the same time, alumni were
surprised to learn that the rec
ommended suspensions had been
handed down by an all faculty
body.
"When we were here, the stu
dent council was all students,"
one alumnus said. "I know, be
cause they suspended me."
The trustees also received
some advice.
It is necessary that students,
faculty, and administrators adopt
rules that "reject coercion as a
means to an end" President Wal
lace Sterling said Saturday.
Sterling's remarks, which were
part of the day-long Campus
Conference for 2500 alumni and
friends of Stanford, were a de
parture from the usual address
that he has delivered in the past
at the annual program.
Sterling noted that both the
student body in the recent elec
tions and the Board of Trustees
at their Thursday meeting had
"declared themselves against co
ercive tactics."
"It is not yet as clear, as I
feel confident it will soon be
come, where the faculty stands
on this particular issue," Ster
ling said.
Sterling drew extended ap
plause from the alumni when he
pointed that the American Asso
ciation of University Professors
(AAUP) had adopted a resolu
tion condemning the participa
tion of individual faculty mem
bers in "demonstrations which
disrupt educational activities of
academic institutions" at its an
nual meeting two weeks ago.
After discussing those men
who had preceeded him as presi
dent and noting the change in
emphasis on education during
his term of office, Sterling spent
the major part of his speech at
tempting to answer alumni pro
tests that he had received as a
result of the Old Union sit-in.
The charges of capitulation
on his part are "unimpressive!
and unconvincing/' Sterling
said.
Although he "did not favor the
majority faculty vote" of the
Academic Council, Sterling said
that his decision not to disregard
it was based on "confidence that
the great majority of students
and faculty on this campus dis
approve of coercive tactics and
will make that disapproval
known."
"What was at stake," Sterling
said in regard to accepting the
recommendations, "was the op
portunity to avoid a polarized
and bitterly divided house from
which constructive recovery
would have been difficult and
long."
On the national scene, Ster
ling said that disruptions on col
lege and university campuses
have seriously undermined pub
lic confidence in higher educa
tion.
"It is mandatory that con

fidence be restored," Sterling
said. "Otherwise both higher
education and the nation will
suffer. That restoration is a
task for the entire University
community."
Sterling took note of a num
ber of changes which are involv
ed In this "restoration" at Stan
ford.
Repeating an earlier statement
to the student body, Sterling
said that "general rules of con
duct, such as Fundamental Stan
dards, much be supplemented or
replaced by a codification of
rules."
"There must be a judicial sys
tem, which, with appropriate re
gard to due process, will indeed
serve and act judicially, and
will apply appropriate penalties,"
Sterling added.
Sterling also referred to the
Academic Senate, which was ap
proved by the TYustees Thurs

sity."
