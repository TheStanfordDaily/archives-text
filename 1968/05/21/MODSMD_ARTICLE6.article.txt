# Packer's Speech Stirs Controversy
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
Repercussions at Stanford
from the sit-in two weeks ago,
have developed into uneasy com
binations of emotional recrimi
nation and constructive commit
ment to rebuild.
A week ago, at the annual ban
quet of the Association of Amer
ican University Professors
(AAUP), Vice Provost Herbert
L. Packer delivered a vitriolic
speech attacking faculty actions
during the sit-in. The speech has
since stirred heated debate and
controversy. Evolving with the
controversy, however, are signs
that many faculty members, stu
dents, and administrators, ap
parently including Packer him
self, are now turning their ef
forts toward reconciliation.
Packer's speech analyzes the
causes and results of the sit-in
with particular attention paid to
faculty actions in the Academic
Council meeting on May 8. Pack
er loosely entitled his talk, "The
Role of the Faculty in Crisis
Management During the Era of
the 'New Student.' " At the be
ginning he notes it "may sound
like a lecture on 'Highway Safe
ty' by the victim of a drunk
driver."
In the speech, Packer strong
ly attacks faculty passage at
the Academic Council meeting
of the Holman resolution!
which granted most student
demands. Using harsh, and of
ten emotional language, Pack
er lashes out at the faculty
"irresponsibility" terming
Council actions as a "mission
of securing peace in our time."
He says,"It seems to me the
height of irresponsibility for
the faculty to have acted pro
ceedurally as it did."
On Saturday, May 18, Packer
wrote a letter to local AAUP
President William Clebsch in
which he indicated he had temp
ered his views since he delivered
the speech. The letter reads in
part: "I believe it is essential for
breaches in the faculty that have
been created in recent events to
be healed. . .. We have disagreed
among ourselves in the past and
will continue to do so in the fu
ture. That is healthy, and, indeed,
necessary.
"What is unhealthy and un
necessary is for disagreement to
take place in an atmosphere of
bitterness and recrimination.
Many things have been said and
done in the last two weeks that
might perpetuate such an at
mosphere. Few of us are guilt
less in that respect. Certainly I
am not.
"I want all my colleagues
on the faculty to know that I

hold no grudges against any
of them, and I very much hope
the converse Is true."
At a special AAUP meeting
yesterday afternoon, the chapter
instructed its executive commit
tee to appoint a committee to
survey Stanford, examining
problems of participatory gov
ernment, student rights, and aca
demic freedom.
Edwin Good, Associate Profes
sor of Religion, spoke at the
meeting calling for increased de
cision making by the faculty and
students and less by the trus
tees and administration. Several
AAUP members described the
meeting as "extremely serious
and constructive." More than 140
members attended, more than
double the usual number, includ
ing many graduate students and
administrators who will soon be
or are already AAUP members.
Packers speech was not dis
cussed.
The first half of Packer's
speech delineates Packer's views
of events leading up to the sit
in and then the Academic Coun
cil meeting. Packer describes in
some detail the legal evolution
of events as the CIA case travel
led from the demonstration in
November to the IJB, where the
seven students were recommend
ed for suspension.
Speaking of the CIA demon
stration as reflecting a "facist
view," Packer proceeds to the
SJC acquittal saying It was
decided on grounds "largely
irrelevant to their (the stu
dents guilt or innocence."
Packer later describes student
attacks on the IJB decision as an
example of "Chutzpath" which
Packer illustrates with the "by
the story of the young man on
trial for murdering his parents
who asked for mercy on the
ground that he was an orphan."
As he discusses student ac
tions leading to the sit-in, Packer
says"The activist group was
looking for a casus belli." He
claims they found that in the
IJB recommendations and that
they were bent on confrontation
tactics despite plans being for
mulated by the Committee of 15.
Packer notes that the Old
Union was locked on Monday
morning, May 6, "in the vain
hope that burglary and forcible
entry were offenses that Stan
ford students would be unlike
ly to commit."
Packer then deals with the
CIS plans that were formulat
ed before the Academic Coun
cil meeting, that "the Presi
dent and his staff are in agree
ment with the position taken
by Cl 5 ... although this model

for the future goes further In
the direction of student con
trol than they think optimal."
The major part of the speech
concerns the Academic Council
meeting. In this section Packer
attacks the Holman resolution,
its method of introduction, and
finally its proponents. Packer
claims that the resolution pre
sented by the Executive Com
mittee of the Academic Council,
which met with administration
support, was tabled immediate
ly by Holman without allowing
intelligent discussion.
Packer speaks of this tabling
action as "the crucial vote of
the afternoon. ... By that single
action, the Council abandoned
any pretense to acting as a de
liberative body."
Later in the speech, Packer
says that tabling the Execu
tive Committee resolution was
J tantamount to the faculty say
ing, "We don't care who has
been working on this problem
or for how long; we know bet
ter." He says the total Coun
cil actions "taught a lesson
that is easily learned: coercion
pays."
The concluding section of the
talk develops Packers thoughts
on the future at Stanford. He ex
presses hope that the new Sen
ate of the faculty will increase
"government by reason and de
liberation rather than by mob
seer. - " Packer also puts hope
i' die "embryonic institutions of
.ule making and judging that
will emerge from the recommen
dations of the Committee of 15."
Finally, Packer's address ques
tions faculty participation in
demonstrations, and the possibil
ity that someday the Stanford
community might be policed like
any suburban town when stu
dents will "find themselves more
familiar with the North County
Court House than with the Dean
of Students Office."
The speech concludes: "So
loi.g as influential members
of the faculty continue to en
courage or submit to self-in
dulgence of those students who
think that moral passion is a
substitute for thought, hopes
for the future must remain
tentative and fragile."
Commenting on Packer's
spoech, Dean of the Chapel B.
Davie Napier says, "There aro
wounds of the spirit to be heal
ed in the Stanford corporate
body, anxieties to be allieviated,
some overdue? and radical ther
apy to be undertaken, and rea
soned confrontation of a mutu
ally productive kind to be creat
d and sustained between the
three entities at Stanford â€” all
throe caring desperately about
this place, but even more, about
divided man and this divided
world." Napier called Packer's
speoch, "hardly what is needed
now."
Napier's comments mirror
those of many other faculty
members.
Denis Hayes, student body
president elect, also voiced
hope that breeches will be clos
ed, suggesting students be
quickly granted more powers
in governing the University.

"What is unhealthy and un

At a special AAUP meeting
yesterday afternoon, the chapter
instructed its executive commit
tee to appoint a committee to
survey Stanford, examining
problems of participatory gov
ernment, student rights, and aca
demic freedom.
Edwin Good, Associate Profes
sor of Religion, spoke at the
meeting calling for increased de
cision making by the faculty and
students and less by the trus
tees and administration. Several
AAUP members described the
meeting as "extremely serious
and constructive." More than 140
members attended, more than
double the usual number, includ
ing many graduate students and
administrators who will soon be
or are already AAUP members.
Packers speech was not dis
cussed.
The first half of Packer's
speech delineates Packer's views
of events leading up to the sit
in and then the Academic Coun
cil meeting. Packer describes in
some detail the legal evolution
of events as the CIA case travel
led from the demonstration in
November to the IJB, where the
seven students were recommend
ed for suspension.
Speaking of the CIA demon
stration as reflecting a "facist
view," Packer proceeds to the
SJC acquittal saying It was
decided on grounds "largely
irrelevant to their (the stu
dents guilt or innocence."
Packer later describes student
attacks on the IJB decision as an
example of "Chutzpath" which
Packer illustrates with the "by
the story of the young man on
trial for murdering his parents
who asked for mercy on the
ground that he was an orphan."
As he discusses student ac
tions leading to the sit-in, Packer
says"The activist group was
looking for a casus belli." He
claims they found that in the
IJB recommendations and that
they were bent on confrontation
tactics despite plans being for
mulated by the Committee of 15.
Packer notes that the Old
Union was locked on Monday
morning, May 6, "in the vain
hope that burglary and forcible
entry were offenses that Stan
ford students would be unlike
ly to commit."
Packer then deals with the
CIS plans that were formulat
ed before the Academic Coun
cil meeting, that "the Presi
dent and his staff are in agree
ment with the position taken
by Cl 5 ... although this model

for the future goes further In
the direction of student con
trol than they think optimal."
The major part of the speech
concerns the Academic Council
meeting. In this section Packer
attacks the Holman resolution,
its method of introduction, and
finally its proponents. Packer
claims that the resolution pre
sented by the Executive Com
mittee of the Academic Council,
which met with administration
support, was tabled immediate
ly by Holman without allowing
intelligent discussion.
Packer speaks of this tabling
action as "the crucial vote of
the afternoon. ... By that single
action, the Council abandoned
any pretense to acting as a de
liberative body."
Later in the speech, Packer
says that tabling the Execu
tive Committee resolution was
J tantamount to the faculty say
ing, "We don't care who has
been working on this problem
or for how long; we know bet
ter." He says the total Coun
cil actions "taught a lesson
that is easily learned: coercion
pays."
The concluding section of the
talk develops Packers thoughts
on the future at Stanford. He ex
presses hope that the new Sen
ate of the faculty will increase
"government by reason and de
liberation rather than by mob
seer. - " Packer also puts hope
i' die "embryonic institutions of
.ule making and judging that
will emerge from the recommen
dations of the Committee of 15."
Finally, Packer's address ques
tions faculty participation in
demonstrations, and the possibil
ity that someday the Stanford
community might be policed like
any suburban town when stu
dents will "find themselves more
familiar with the North County
Court House than with the Dean
of Students Office."
The speech concludes: "So
loi.g as influential members
of the faculty continue to en
courage or submit to self-in
dulgence of those students who
think that moral passion is a
substitute for thought, hopes
for the future must remain
tentative and fragile."
Commenting on Packer's
spoech, Dean of the Chapel B.
Davie Napier says, "There aro
wounds of the spirit to be heal
ed in the Stanford corporate
body, anxieties to be allieviated,
some overdue? and radical ther
apy to be undertaken, and rea
soned confrontation of a mutu
ally productive kind to be creat
d and sustained between the
three entities at Stanford â€” all
throe caring desperately about
this place, but even more, about
divided man and this divided
world." Napier called Packer's
speoch, "hardly what is needed
now."
Napier's comments mirror
those of many other faculty
members.
Denis Hayes, student body
president elect, also voiced
hope that breeches will be clos
ed, suggesting students be
quickly granted more powers
in governing the University.
Repercussions at Stanford
from the sit-in two weeks ago,
have developed into uneasy com
binations of emotional recrimi
nation and constructive commit
ment to rebuild.
A week ago, at the annual ban
quet of the Association of Amer
ican University Professors
(AAUP), Vice Provost Herbert
L. Packer delivered a vitriolic
speech attacking faculty actions
during the sit-in. The speech has
since stirred heated debate and
controversy. Evolving with the
controversy, however, are signs
that many faculty members, stu
dents, and administrators, ap
parently including Packer him
self, are now turning their ef
forts toward reconciliation.
Packer's speech analyzes the
causes and results of the sit-in
with particular attention paid to
faculty actions in the Academic
Council meeting on May 8. Pack
er loosely entitled his talk, "The
Role of the Faculty in Crisis
Management During the Era of
the 'New Student.' " At the be
ginning he notes it "may sound
like a lecture on 'Highway Safe
ty' by the victim of a drunk
driver."
In the speech, Packer strong
ly attacks faculty passage at
the Academic Council meeting
of the Holman resolution!
which granted most student
demands. Using harsh, and of
ten emotional language, Pack
er lashes out at the faculty
"irresponsibility" terming
Council actions as a "mission
of securing peace in our time."
He says,"It seems to me the
height of irresponsibility for
the faculty to have acted pro
ceedurally as it did."
On Saturday, May 18, Packer
wrote a letter to local AAUP
President William Clebsch in
which he indicated he had temp
ered his views since he delivered
the speech. The letter reads in
part: "I believe it is essential for

Speaking of the CIA demon
stration as reflecting a "facist
view," Packer proceeds to the
SJC acquittal saying It was
decided on grounds "largely
irrelevant to their (the stu
dents guilt or innocence."
Packer later describes student
attacks on the IJB decision as an
example of "Chutzpath" which
Packer illustrates with the "by
the story of the young man on
trial for murdering his parents
who asked for mercy on the
ground that he was an orphan."
As he discusses student ac
tions leading to the sit-in, Packer
says"The activist group was
looking for a casus belli." He
claims they found that in the
IJB recommendations and that
they were bent on confrontation
tactics despite plans being for
mulated by the Committee of 15.
Packer notes that the Old
Union was locked on Monday
morning, May 6, "in the vain
hope that burglary and forcible
entry were offenses that Stan
ford students would be unlike
ly to commit."
Packer then deals with the
CIS plans that were formulat
ed before the Academic Coun
cil meeting, that "the Presi
dent and his staff are in agree
ment with the position taken
by Cl 5 ... although this model

for the future goes further In
the direction of student con
trol than they think optimal."
The major part of the speech
concerns the Academic Council
meeting. In this section Packer
attacks the Holman resolution,
its method of introduction, and
finally its proponents. Packer
claims that the resolution pre
sented by the Executive Com
mittee of the Academic Council,
which met with administration
support, was tabled immediate
ly by Holman without allowing
intelligent discussion.
Packer speaks of this tabling
action as "the crucial vote of
the afternoon. ... By that single
action, the Council abandoned
any pretense to acting as a de
liberative body."
Later in the speech, Packer
says that tabling the Execu
tive Committee resolution was
J tantamount to the faculty say
ing, "We don't care who has
been working on this problem
or for how long; we know bet
ter." He says the total Coun
cil actions "taught a lesson
that is easily learned: coercion
pays."
The concluding section of the
talk develops Packers thoughts
on the future at Stanford. He ex
presses hope that the new Sen
ate of the faculty will increase
"government by reason and de
liberation rather than by mob
seer. - " Packer also puts hope
i' die "embryonic institutions of
.ule making and judging that
will emerge from the recommen
dations of the Committee of 15."
Finally, Packer's address ques
tions faculty participation in
demonstrations, and the possibil
ity that someday the Stanford
community might be policed like
any suburban town when stu
dents will "find themselves more
familiar with the North County
Court House than with the Dean
of Students Office."
The speech concludes: "So
loi.g as influential members
of the faculty continue to en
courage or submit to self-in
dulgence of those students who
think that moral passion is a
substitute for thought, hopes
for the future must remain
tentative and fragile."
Commenting on Packer's
spoech, Dean of the Chapel B.
Davie Napier says, "There aro
wounds of the spirit to be heal
ed in the Stanford corporate
body, anxieties to be allieviated,
some overdue? and radical ther
apy to be undertaken, and rea
soned confrontation of a mutu
ally productive kind to be creat
d and sustained between the
three entities at Stanford â€” all
throe caring desperately about
this place, but even more, about
divided man and this divided
world." Napier called Packer's
speoch, "hardly what is needed
now."
Napier's comments mirror
those of many other faculty
members.
Denis Hayes, student body
president elect, also voiced
hope that breeches will be clos
ed, suggesting students be
quickly granted more powers
in governing the University.
Repercussions at Stanford
from the sit-in two weeks ago,
have developed into uneasy com
binations of emotional recrimi
nation and constructive commit
ment to rebuild.
A week ago, at the annual ban
quet of the Association of Amer
ican University Professors
(AAUP), Vice Provost Herbert
L. Packer delivered a vitriolic
speech attacking faculty actions
during the sit-in. The speech has
since stirred heated debate and
controversy. Evolving with the
controversy, however, are signs
that many faculty members, stu
dents, and administrators, ap
parently including Packer him
self, are now turning their ef
forts toward reconciliation.
Packer's speech analyzes the
causes and results of the sit-in
with particular attention paid to
faculty actions in the Academic
Council meeting on May 8. Pack
er loosely entitled his talk, "The
Role of the Faculty in Crisis
Management During the Era of
the 'New Student.' " At the be
ginning he notes it "may sound
like a lecture on 'Highway Safe
ty' by the victim of a drunk
driver."
In the speech, Packer strong
ly attacks faculty passage at
the Academic Council meeting
of the Holman resolution!
which granted most student
demands. Using harsh, and of
ten emotional language, Pack
er lashes out at the faculty
"irresponsibility" terming
Council actions as a "mission
of securing peace in our time."
He says,"It seems to me the
height of irresponsibility for
the faculty to have acted pro
ceedurally as it did."
On Saturday, May 18, Packer
wrote a letter to local AAUP
President William Clebsch in
which he indicated he had temp
ered his views since he delivered
the speech. The letter reads in
part: "I believe it is essential for
breaches in the faculty that have
been created in recent events to
be healed. . .. We have disagreed
among ourselves in the past and
will continue to do so in the fu
ture. That is healthy, and, indeed,
necessary.
"What is unhealthy and un
necessary is for disagreement to
take place in an atmosphere of
bitterness and recrimination.
Many things have been said and
done in the last two weeks that
might perpetuate such an at
mosphere. Few of us are guilt
less in that respect. Certainly I
am not.
"I want all my colleagues
on the faculty to know that I

hold no grudges against any
of them, and I very much hope
the converse Is true."
At a special AAUP meeting
yesterday afternoon, the chapter
instructed its executive commit
tee to appoint a committee to
survey Stanford, examining
problems of participatory gov
ernment, student rights, and aca
demic freedom.
Edwin Good, Associate Profes
sor of Religion, spoke at the
meeting calling for increased de
cision making by the faculty and
students and less by the trus
tees and administration. Several
AAUP members described the
meeting as "extremely serious
and constructive." More than 140
members attended, more than
double the usual number, includ
ing many graduate students and
administrators who will soon be
or are already AAUP members.

any pretense to acting as a de
liberative body."
Later in the speech, Packer
says that tabling the Execu
tive Committee resolution was
J tantamount to the faculty say
ing, "We don't care who has
been working on this problem
or for how long; we know bet
ter." He says the total Coun
cil actions "taught a lesson
that is easily learned: coercion
pays."
The concluding section of the
talk develops Packers thoughts
on the future at Stanford. He ex
presses hope that the new Sen
ate of the faculty will increase
"government by reason and de
liberation rather than by mob
seer. - " Packer also puts hope
i' die "embryonic institutions of
.ule making and judging that
will emerge from the recommen
dations of the Committee of 15."
Finally, Packer's address ques
tions faculty participation in
demonstrations, and the possibil
ity that someday the Stanford
community might be policed like
any suburban town when stu
dents will "find themselves more
familiar with the North County
Court House than with the Dean
of Students Office."
The speech concludes: "So
loi.g as influential members
of the faculty continue to en
courage or submit to self-in
dulgence of those students who
think that moral passion is a
substitute for thought, hopes
for the future must remain
tentative and fragile."
Commenting on Packer's
spoech, Dean of the Chapel B.
Davie Napier says, "There aro
wounds of the spirit to be heal
ed in the Stanford corporate
body, anxieties to be allieviated,
some overdue? and radical ther
apy to be undertaken, and rea
soned confrontation of a mutu
ally productive kind to be creat
d and sustained between the
three entities at Stanford â€” all
throe caring desperately about
this place, but even more, about
divided man and this divided
world." Napier called Packer's
speoch, "hardly what is needed
now."
Napier's comments mirror
those of many other faculty
members.
Denis Hayes, student body
president elect, also voiced
hope that breeches will be clos
ed, suggesting students be
quickly granted more powers
in governing the University.
Repercussions at Stanford
from the sit-in two weeks ago,
have developed into uneasy com
binations of emotional recrimi
nation and constructive commit
ment to rebuild.
A week ago, at the annual ban
quet of the Association of Amer
ican University Professors
(AAUP), Vice Provost Herbert
L. Packer delivered a vitriolic
speech attacking faculty actions
during the sit-in. The speech has
since stirred heated debate and
controversy. Evolving with the
controversy, however, are signs
that many faculty members, stu
dents, and administrators, ap
parently including Packer him
self, are now turning their ef
forts toward reconciliation.
Packer's speech analyzes the
causes and results of the sit-in
with particular attention paid to
faculty actions in the Academic
Council meeting on May 8. Pack
er loosely entitled his talk, "The
Role of the Faculty in Crisis
Management During the Era of
the 'New Student.' " At the be
ginning he notes it "may sound
like a lecture on 'Highway Safe
ty' by the victim of a drunk
driver."
In the speech, Packer strong
ly attacks faculty passage at
the Academic Council meeting
of the Holman resolution!
which granted most student
demands. Using harsh, and of
ten emotional language, Pack
er lashes out at the faculty
"irresponsibility" terming
Council actions as a "mission
of securing peace in our time."
He says,"It seems to me the
height of irresponsibility for
the faculty to have acted pro
ceedurally as it did."
On Saturday, May 18, Packer
wrote a letter to local AAUP
President William Clebsch in
which he indicated he had temp
ered his views since he delivered
the speech. The letter reads in
part: "I believe it is essential for
breaches in the faculty that have
been created in recent events to
be healed. . .. We have disagreed
among ourselves in the past and
will continue to do so in the fu
ture. That is healthy, and, indeed,
necessary.
"What is unhealthy and un
necessary is for disagreement to
take place in an atmosphere of
bitterness and recrimination.
Many things have been said and
done in the last two weeks that
might perpetuate such an at
mosphere. Few of us are guilt
less in that respect. Certainly I
am not.
"I want all my colleagues
on the faculty to know that I

hold no grudges against any
of them, and I very much hope
the converse Is true."
At a special AAUP meeting
yesterday afternoon, the chapter
instructed its executive commit
tee to appoint a committee to
survey Stanford, examining
problems of participatory gov
ernment, student rights, and aca
demic freedom.
Edwin Good, Associate Profes
sor of Religion, spoke at the
meeting calling for increased de
cision making by the faculty and
students and less by the trus
tees and administration. Several
AAUP members described the
meeting as "extremely serious
and constructive." More than 140
members attended, more than
double the usual number, includ
ing many graduate students and
administrators who will soon be
or are already AAUP members.
Packers speech was not dis
cussed.
The first half of Packer's
speech delineates Packer's views
of events leading up to the sit
in and then the Academic Coun
cil meeting. Packer describes in
some detail the legal evolution
of events as the CIA case travel
led from the demonstration in
November to the IJB, where the
seven students were recommend
ed for suspension.
Speaking of the CIA demon
stration as reflecting a "facist
view," Packer proceeds to the
SJC acquittal saying It was
decided on grounds "largely
irrelevant to their (the stu
dents guilt or innocence."
Packer later describes student
attacks on the IJB decision as an
example of "Chutzpath" which
Packer illustrates with the "by
the story of the young man on
trial for murdering his parents
who asked for mercy on the
ground that he was an orphan."
As he discusses student ac
tions leading to the sit-in, Packer
says"The activist group was
looking for a casus belli." He
claims they found that in the
IJB recommendations and that
they were bent on confrontation
tactics despite plans being for
mulated by the Committee of 15.
Packer notes that the Old
Union was locked on Monday
morning, May 6, "in the vain
hope that burglary and forcible
entry were offenses that Stan
ford students would be unlike
ly to commit."
Packer then deals with the
CIS plans that were formulat
ed before the Academic Coun
cil meeting, that "the Presi
dent and his staff are in agree
ment with the position taken
by Cl 5 ... although this model

for the future goes further In
the direction of student con
trol than they think optimal."
The major part of the speech
concerns the Academic Council
meeting. In this section Packer
attacks the Holman resolution,
its method of introduction, and
finally its proponents. Packer
claims that the resolution pre
sented by the Executive Com
mittee of the Academic Council,
which met with administration
support, was tabled immediate
ly by Holman without allowing
intelligent discussion.
Packer speaks of this tabling
action as "the crucial vote of
the afternoon. ... By that single
action, the Council abandoned
any pretense to acting as a de
liberative body."
Later in the speech, Packer
says that tabling the Execu
