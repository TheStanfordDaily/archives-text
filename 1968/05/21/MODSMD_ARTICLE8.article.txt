## Massive Strike Paralyzes France 
### 
PARIS (AP) — A massive
strike of millions flooded across
France yesterday in a grass
roots upheaval that plunged the
nation into a stage of near-para
lysis and threatened the founda
tions of Charles de Gaulle's 10-
year-old Fifth Republic.
Nearly six million of the na
tion's 16 million-member work
force were idle and 250 factories
were forced to close down. Coal
mines in the provinces, air
fields and seaports came to a
standstill.
A monumental traffic jam
choked Paris. Commuters re>-
sorted to automobiles because
trains, subways and buses were
strikebound.
Taxi drivers voted to strike
Wednesday, thereby cutting off
all public transport.
Garbage piled up in the
streets; garbagemen have been
out since Saturday.
Housewives descended on
shops to stock up on foodstuffs.
Some tourists were stranded.
The stock market plunged.
Thousands lined up at banks
to make withdrawals in the fear
the walkouts would spread to
the financial sectors.
Opposition political leaders
conferred with trade union lead
ers in preparation for an all-out
bid in the National Assembly to
day to oust De Gaulle's govern
ment. An assembly debate on an
opposition motion of censure of
the government is to end with
a vote tomorrow night or early
Thursday.
Worker's demands varied from
place to place, but all were based
on economics. In most cases the
strikers want higher pay, a
shorter work week and earlier
retirement.
The workers' upheavel grew
out of a student revolt last week
over conditions in the French
educational system. Rioting stu
dents also demanded social

changes in all areas oi French
national life.
• Tourism Loses
LONDON (AP) — European
passengers flew over France,
skirted around it, or just stayed
home as French strikes threw
Paris - bound transport into
chaos yesterday. The loser was
French tourism.
Britons were warned that
travel to France could not be
guaranteed. Only one in four
Paris-bound flights operated out
of London's Heathrow Airport.
Many passengers, seeing the
warning notices and waiting
lines, turned around and went
home.
Channel ferries dropped pas
sengers and cars on the French
coast, but onward travel could
not be assured. Trains carrying
Continental sleepers were can
celed.
Nevertheless, French travel
agents assured families of for
eign tourists stranded in France
their relatives were being cared
for efficiently. A communique
from the Union of Travel Agents
said stranded tourists were
being looked after and being
helped to solve any problems.
Travel agents and air lines
were beseiged by stranded tour
ists trying to leave France.
Buses were pressed into service
and a number of American trav
el agencies booked rooms in ho
tels for their clients so they
could await their turn to board
a bus.
• Viet Peace Talks
PARIS (AP) — The U.S. dele
gation clung yesterday night to
a hunch that a break is coming
in the snagged preliminary talks
on peace in Vietnam. The Amer
icans sent a mission to London
to brief the Foreign Office in ad
vance of a trip to Moscow

Wednesday by Foreign Secretary
Michael Stewart.
Daniel Davidson of the U.S.
negotiating staff conferred in
London for an hour with Stew
art. The American was accom
panied by William Sullivan, the
U.S. ambassador to Laos, a
Vietnam neighbor. Sullivan, en
route to the United States, had
contacts in Vientiane, the Lao
tian capital, with North Viet
namese representatives in ad
vance of the Paris talks.
Up to the present, the discus
sion — in recess from last Satur
day until Wednesday — have, in
the view of both sides, produced
no progress.
But the Paris talks took on a
more international flavor with
the London contacts and with
an announcement that President
Charles de Gaulle would meet
separately today with the
chief U.S. negotiator, Ambassa
dor W. Averell Harriman and
with Xuan Thuy, the chief North
Vietnamese.
These developments stirred
speculation something new
might be stirring.
• Spock Jury Chosen
BOSTON (AP) — A 12 - man
jury was selected in federal
court yesterday to try Dr. Ben
jamin Spock on charges of coun
seling American youth to avoid
the draft, The defense argued in
vain that women were discrimi
nated against on the panel.
The international known
baby doctor went on trial with
four other defendants associated
with him in the anti-Vietnam
war movement. Peace demon
strators marched outside the
courthouse, but not in large
numbers.
Spock, 65, is on trial with Yale
Chaplain William Sloane Coffin
Jr., 43; Michael Ferber, 23,
graduate student at Harvard;

Mitchell Goodman, 44, of New
York author and teacher; and
Marcus Raskin, 33, co-director
of the Institute for Political
Studies in Washington.
They are charged with con
spiring to "counsel, aid and
abet" young men to refuse or
evade military service and of
conspiring to interrupt the in
duction process at draft centers
across the country.
• Poor People Plan
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
leader of the Poor People's
Campaign said yesterday that
demonstrations "more militant
and more massive than have
ever taken place in the history
of this nation" will begin within
a few days.
The Rev. Ralph David Aber
nothy, successor to the slain
civil rights leader Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr., refused to give
details.
He told cheering campaigners
in "Resurrection City, U.S.A."
that "We're gonna raise hell."
But he said it will be done non
violently.
On finances, he told followers
at the rally that there is enough
money to finsh the camp and
they shouldn't worry. He told
newsmen afterward that they
don't have the money needed
for the campaign but that the
effort has many friends and he
is sure that the American peo
ple will come through with sup
port.
• Salisbury Quiet
SALISBURY, Md. (AP) —
While National Guardsmen with
rifles patroled the quiet streets
of Salisbury yesterday, Gov.
Spiro T. Agnew ordered another
all-night curfew to ward off a
renewal of Negro violence.
About 800 Guardsmen and 400
State Police were stationed in

the city of 18,000, sent in be
cause of two nights of disorder
touched off by the fatal shoot
ing Saturday of a Negro bur
glary suspect by a white police
man.
All schools were open and
business operations returned to
normal Monday following the
lifting of the curfew at 7 a.m.
State's Atty. Alfred T. Truitt
Jr. haid Henry was shot by Jer
ry C. Mason, a detective on the
police force, after a struggle
outside police headquarters.
Mason was charged with man
slaughter Sunday and released
on $1,500 bond.
• Supreme Court
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Supreme Court expanded the
right to be tried by jury yester
day and also open busy shop
ping centers to mass picketing.
The court held 7 to 2 that
states must grant the right to be
tried by jury set forth in the Bill
of Rights.
While handing down these de
cisions the court set the stage
for a full-blown debate after the
summer layoff on use of the
draft to punish young men who
publicly protest the war in Viet
nam.
The vehicle for consideration
of this heated issue is an appeal
by Jmes J. Oestereich, 2-
year-old divinity student, who
was stripped of his draft exemp
tion, classified 1 Aand scheduled
for induction when he turned in
his draft card to protest the
war.
The director of Selective Ser
vice, Lt. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey,
recommended last October that
draft boards speed the induction
of war protesters. The Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union, ap
pealing for Oestereich, claimed
this violated his constitutional
right to dissent.
• Marines Battle VC
SAIGON (AP) — U.S. Ma
rines fought three battles near
two of their combat bases in the
far north Sunday and reported
killing 125 North Vietnamese,
the U.S. Command said today.
Marine losses were given as
12 killed and 49 wounded.
Repulsed around Khe Sanh in
the far northwest and at Con
Thien, an eastern Marine an
chor just south of the demilitar
ized zone between the Vietnams,
the North Vietnamese staged a
rocket attack on Camp Evans to
the south and destroyed an am
munition dump.
The command reported the at
tack caused light casualties at
Camp Evans, home of the U.S.
Ist Air Cavalry Division.
The fighting in the far north
showed the enemy's ability to
keep on the pressure over a
wide front extending from the
demilitarized zone southward to
Hue and the Marine base at Da
Nang, about 100 miles southeast
of the zone.
• Reagan Budget Hit
SACRAMENTO (AP) — A
top Democrat denounced as
"the old flim-flam game" Gov.
Reagan's announcement yester
day that an improved state fi
nancial picture will allow a $35
million tax cut for middle-in
come families.
A sharp reaction to the gov

ernor's latest estimates of the
fiscal condition of California
came from a powerful Democra
tic foe, Sen. George Miller Jr.,
of Martinez, chairman of the
upper house finance committee.
Miller told a news conference
that "Gov. Reagan has misrep
resented the financial condition
of the state. All the cries and
warnings about financial insolv
ency are so much hogwash."

• Viet Peace Talks
PARIS (AP) — The U.S. dele
gation clung yesterday night to
a hunch that a break is coming
in the snagged preliminary talks
on peace in Vietnam. The Amer
icans sent a mission to London
to brief the Foreign Office in ad
vance of a trip to Moscow

Wednesday by Foreign Secretary
Michael Stewart.
Daniel Davidson of the U.S.
negotiating staff conferred in
London for an hour with Stew
art. The American was accom
panied by William Sullivan, the
U.S. ambassador to Laos, a
Vietnam neighbor. Sullivan, en
route to the United States, had
contacts in Vientiane, the Lao
tian capital, with North Viet
namese representatives in ad
vance of the Paris talks.
Up to the present, the discus
sion — in recess from last Satur
day until Wednesday — have, in
the view of both sides, produced
no progress.
But the Paris talks took on a
more international flavor with
the London contacts and with
an announcement that President
Charles de Gaulle would meet
separately today with the
chief U.S. negotiator, Ambassa
dor W. Averell Harriman and
with Xuan Thuy, the chief North
Vietnamese.
These developments stirred
speculation something new
might be stirring.
• Spock Jury Chosen
BOSTON (AP) — A 12 - man
jury was selected in federal
court yesterday to try Dr. Ben
jamin Spock on charges of coun

the draft, The defense argued in

graduate student at Harvard;

Mitchell Goodman, 44, of New

evade military service and of
conspiring to interrupt the in
duction process at draft centers
across the country.
• Poor People Plan
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
leader of the Poor People's
Campaign said yesterday that
demonstrations "more militant
and more massive than have
ever taken place in the history
of this nation" will begin within
a few days.
The Rev. Ralph David Aber
nothy, successor to the slain
civil rights leader Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr., refused to give
details.
He told cheering campaigners
in "Resurrection City, U.S.A."
that "We're gonna raise hell."
But he said it will be done non
violently.
On finances, he told followers
at the rally that there is enough
money to finsh the camp and
they shouldn't worry. He told
newsmen afterward that they
don't have the money needed
for the campaign but that the
effort has many friends and he
is sure that the American peo
ple will come through with sup
port.
• Salisbury Quiet
SALISBURY, Md. (AP) —
While National Guardsmen with
rifles patroled the quiet streets
of Salisbury yesterday, Gov.
Spiro T. Agnew ordered another
all-night curfew to ward off a
renewal of Negro violence.
About 800 Guardsmen and 400
State Police were stationed in

the city of 18,000, sent in be
cause of two nights of disorder
touched off by the fatal shoot
ing Saturday of a Negro bur
glary suspect by a white police
man.
All schools were open and
business operations returned to
normal Monday following the
lifting of the curfew at 7 a.m.
State's Atty. Alfred T. Truitt
Jr. haid Henry was shot by Jer
ry C. Mason, a detective on the
police force, after a struggle
outside police headquarters.
Mason was charged with man
slaughter Sunday and released
on $1,500 bond.
• Supreme Court
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Supreme Court expanded the
right to be tried by jury yester
day and also open busy shop
ping centers to mass picketing.
The court held 7 to 2 that
states must grant the right to be
tried by jury set forth in the Bill
of Rights.
While handing down these de
cisions the court set the stage
for a full-blown debate after the
summer layoff on use of the
draft to punish young men who
publicly protest the war in Viet
nam.
The vehicle for consideration
of this heated issue is an appeal
by Jmes J. Oestereich, 2-
year-old divinity student, who
was stripped of his draft exemp
tion, classified 1 Aand scheduled
for induction when he turned in
his draft card to protest the
war.
The director of Selective Ser
vice, Lt. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey,
recommended last October that
draft boards speed the induction
of war protesters. The Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union, ap
pealing for Oestereich, claimed
this violated his constitutional
right to dissent.
• Marines Battle VC
SAIGON (AP) — U.S. Ma
rines fought three battles near
two of their combat bases in the
far north Sunday and reported
killing 125 North Vietnamese,
the U.S. Command said today.
Marine losses were given as
12 killed and 49 wounded.
Repulsed around Khe Sanh in
the far northwest and at Con
Thien, an eastern Marine an
chor just south of the demilitar
ized zone between the Vietnams,
the North Vietnamese staged a
rocket attack on Camp Evans to
the south and destroyed an am
munition dump.
The command reported the at
tack caused light casualties at
Camp Evans, home of the U.S.
Ist Air Cavalry Division.
The fighting in the far north
showed the enemy's ability to
keep on the pressure over a
wide front extending from the
demilitarized zone southward to
Hue and the Marine base at Da
Nang, about 100 miles southeast
of the zone.
• Reagan Budget Hit
SACRAMENTO (AP) — A
top Democrat denounced as
"the old flim-flam game" Gov.
Reagan's announcement yester
day that an improved state fi
nancial picture will allow a $35
million tax cut for middle-in
come families.
A sharp reaction to the gov

ernor's latest estimates of the
fiscal condition of California
came from a powerful Democra
tic foe, Sen. George Miller Jr.,
of Martinez, chairman of the
upper house finance committee.
Miller told a news conference
that "Gov. Reagan has misrep
resented the financial condition
of the state. All the cries and
warnings about financial insolv

PARIS (AP) — A massive
strike of millions flooded across
France yesterday in a grass
roots upheaval that plunged the
nation into a stage of near-para
lysis and threatened the founda
tions of Charles de Gaulle's 10-
year-old Fifth Republic.
Nearly six million of the na
tion's 16 million-member work
force were idle and 250 factories
were forced to close down. Coal
mines in the provinces, air
fields and seaports came to a
standstill.
A monumental traffic jam
choked Paris. Commuters re>-
sorted to automobiles because
trains, subways and buses were
strikebound.
Taxi drivers voted to strike
Wednesday, thereby cutting off
all public transport.
Garbage piled up in the
streets; garbagemen have been
out since Saturday.
Housewives descended on
shops to stock up on foodstuffs.
Some tourists were stranded.
The stock market plunged.
Thousands lined up at banks
to make withdrawals in the fear
the walkouts would spread to
the financial sectors.
Opposition political leaders
conferred with trade union lead
ers in preparation for an all-out
bid in the National Assembly to
day to oust De Gaulle's govern
ment. An assembly debate on an
opposition motion of censure of
the government is to end with
a vote tomorrow night or early
Thursday.
Worker's demands varied from
place to place, but all were based
on economics. In most cases the
strikers want higher pay, a
shorter work week and earlier
retirement.
The workers' upheavel grew
out of a student revolt last week
over conditions in the French
educational system. Rioting stu
dents also demanded social

changes in all areas oi French
national life.
• Tourism Loses

of London's Heathrow Airport.

• Poor People Plan
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
leader of the Poor People's

demonstrations "more militant
and more massive than have
ever taken place in the history
of this nation" will begin within
a few days.
The Rev. Ralph David Aber

He told cheering campaigners
in "Resurrection City, U.S.A."
that "We're gonna raise hell."
But he said it will be done non

On finances, he told followers
at the rally that there is enough

• Salisbury Quiet
SALISBURY, Md. (AP) —
While National Guardsmen with
rifles patroled the quiet streets
of Salisbury yesterday, Gov.
Spiro T. Agnew ordered another
all-night curfew to ward off a
renewal of Negro violence.
About 800 Guardsmen and 400
State Police were stationed in

the city of 18,000, sent in be
cause of two nights of disorder
touched off by the fatal shoot
ing Saturday of a Negro bur
glary suspect by a white police
man.
All schools were open and
business operations returned to
normal Monday following the
lifting of the curfew at 7 a.m.
State's Atty. Alfred T. Truitt
Jr. haid Henry was shot by Jer
ry C. Mason, a detective on the
police force, after a struggle
outside police headquarters.
Mason was charged with man
slaughter Sunday and released
on $1,500 bond.
• Supreme Court
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Supreme Court expanded the
right to be tried by jury yester
day and also open busy shop
ping centers to mass picketing.
The court held 7 to 2 that
states must grant the right to be
tried by jury set forth in the Bill
of Rights.
While handing down these de
cisions the court set the stage
for a full-blown debate after the
summer layoff on use of the
draft to punish young men who
publicly protest the war in Viet
nam.
The vehicle for consideration
of this heated issue is an appeal
by Jmes J. Oestereich, 2-
year-old divinity student, who
was stripped of his draft exemp
tion, classified 1 Aand scheduled
for induction when he turned in
his draft card to protest the
war.
The director of Selective Ser
vice, Lt. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey,
recommended last October that
draft boards speed the induction
of war protesters. The Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union, ap
pealing for Oestereich, claimed
this violated his constitutional
right to dissent.
• Marines Battle VC
SAIGON (AP) — U.S. Ma
rines fought three battles near
two of their combat bases in the
far north Sunday and reported
killing 125 North Vietnamese,
the U.S. Command said today.
Marine losses were given as
12 killed and 49 wounded.
Repulsed around Khe Sanh in
the far northwest and at Con
Thien, an eastern Marine an
chor just south of the demilitar
ized zone between the Vietnams,
the North Vietnamese staged a
rocket attack on Camp Evans to
the south and destroyed an am
munition dump.
The command reported the at
tack caused light casualties at
Camp Evans, home of the U.S.
Ist Air Cavalry Division.
The fighting in the far north
showed the enemy's ability to
keep on the pressure over a
wide front extending from the
demilitarized zone southward to
Hue and the Marine base at Da
Nang, about 100 miles southeast
of the zone.
• Reagan Budget Hit
SACRAMENTO (AP) — A
top Democrat denounced as
"the old flim-flam game" Gov.
Reagan's announcement yester
day that an improved state fi
nancial picture will allow a $35
million tax cut for middle-in
come families.
A sharp reaction to the gov

ernor's latest estimates of the
fiscal condition of California
came from a powerful Democra
tic foe, Sen. George Miller Jr.,
of Martinez, chairman of the
upper house finance committee.
Miller told a news conference
that "Gov. Reagan has misrep
resented the financial condition
of the state. All the cries and
warnings about financial insolv
ency are so much hogwash."
PARIS (AP) — A massive
strike of millions flooded across
France yesterday in a grass
roots upheaval that plunged the
nation into a stage of near-para
lysis and threatened the founda
tions of Charles de Gaulle's 10-
year-old Fifth Republic.
Nearly six million of the na
tion's 16 million-member work
force were idle and 250 factories
were forced to close down. Coal
mines in the provinces, air
fields and seaports came to a
standstill.
A monumental traffic jam
choked Paris. Commuters re>-
sorted to automobiles because
trains, subways and buses were
strikebound.
Taxi drivers voted to strike
Wednesday, thereby cutting off
all public transport.
Garbage piled up in the
streets; garbagemen have been
out since Saturday.
Housewives descended on
shops to stock up on foodstuffs.
Some tourists were stranded.
The stock market plunged.
Thousands lined up at banks
to make withdrawals in the fear
the walkouts would spread to
the financial sectors.
Opposition political leaders
conferred with trade union lead
ers in preparation for an all-out
bid in the National Assembly to
day to oust De Gaulle's govern
ment. An assembly debate on an
opposition motion of censure of
the government is to end with
a vote tomorrow night or early
Thursday.
Worker's demands varied from
place to place, but all were based
on economics. In most cases the
strikers want higher pay, a
shorter work week and earlier
retirement.
The workers' upheavel grew
out of a student revolt last week
over conditions in the French
educational system. Rioting stu
dents also demanded social

changes in all areas oi French
national life.
• Tourism Loses
LONDON (AP) — European
passengers flew over France,
skirted around it, or just stayed
home as French strikes threw
Paris - bound transport into
chaos yesterday. The loser was
French tourism.
Britons were warned that
travel to France could not be
guaranteed. Only one in four
Paris-bound flights operated out
of London's Heathrow Airport.
Many passengers, seeing the
warning notices and waiting
lines, turned around and went
home.
Channel ferries dropped pas
sengers and cars on the French
coast, but onward travel could
not be assured. Trains carrying
Continental sleepers were can
celed.
Nevertheless, French travel
agents assured families of for
eign tourists stranded in France
their relatives were being cared
for efficiently. A communique
from the Union of Travel Agents
said stranded tourists were
being looked after and being
helped to solve any problems.
Travel agents and air lines
were beseiged by stranded tour
ists trying to leave France.
Buses were pressed into service
and a number of American trav
el agencies booked rooms in ho
tels for their clients so they
could await their turn to board
a bus.
• Viet Peace Talks
PARIS (AP) — The U.S. dele
gation clung yesterday night to
a hunch that a break is coming
in the snagged preliminary talks
on peace in Vietnam. The Amer
icans sent a mission to London
to brief the Foreign Office in ad
vance of a trip to Moscow

Wednesday by Foreign Secretary
Michael Stewart.
Daniel Davidson of the U.S.
negotiating staff conferred in
London for an hour with Stew
art. The American was accom
panied by William Sullivan, the
U.S. ambassador to Laos, a
Vietnam neighbor. Sullivan, en
route to the United States, had
contacts in Vientiane, the Lao
tian capital, with North Viet
namese representatives in ad
vance of the Paris talks.
Up to the present, the discus
sion — in recess from last Satur
day until Wednesday — have, in
the view of both sides, produced
no progress.
But the Paris talks took on a
more international flavor with
the London contacts and with
an announcement that President
Charles de Gaulle would meet
separately today with the
chief U.S. negotiator, Ambassa
dor W. Averell Harriman and
with Xuan Thuy, the chief North
Vietnamese.
These developments stirred
speculation something new
might be stirring.

• Supreme Court
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Supreme Court expanded the
right to be tried by jury yester
day and also open busy shop
ping centers to mass picketing.
The court held 7 to 2 that
states must grant the right to be
tried by jury set forth in the Bill
of Rights.
While handing down these de
cisions the court set the stage
for a full-blown debate after the
summer layoff on use of the
draft to punish young men who
publicly protest the war in Viet
nam.
The vehicle for consideration
of this heated issue is an appeal
by Jmes J. Oestereich, 2-
year-old divinity student, who
was stripped of his draft exemp
tion, classified 1 Aand scheduled
for induction when he turned in
his draft card to protest the
war.
The director of Selective Ser
vice, Lt. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey,
recommended last October that
draft boards speed the induction
of war protesters. The Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union, ap
pealing for Oestereich, claimed
this violated his constitutional
right to dissent.
• Marines Battle VC
SAIGON (AP) — U.S. Ma
rines fought three battles near
two of their combat bases in the
far north Sunday and reported
killing 125 North Vietnamese,
the U.S. Command said today.
Marine losses were given as
12 killed and 49 wounded.
Repulsed around Khe Sanh in
the far northwest and at Con
Thien, an eastern Marine an
chor just south of the demilitar
ized zone between the Vietnams,
the North Vietnamese staged a
rocket attack on Camp Evans to
the south and destroyed an am
munition dump.
The command reported the at
tack caused light casualties at
Camp Evans, home of the U.S.
Ist Air Cavalry Division.
The fighting in the far north
showed the enemy's ability to
keep on the pressure over a
wide front extending from the
demilitarized zone southward to
Hue and the Marine base at Da
Nang, about 100 miles southeast
of the zone.
• Reagan Budget Hit
SACRAMENTO (AP) — A
top Democrat denounced as
"the old flim-flam game" Gov.
Reagan's announcement yester
day that an improved state fi
nancial picture will allow a $35
million tax cut for middle-in
come families.
A sharp reaction to the gov

ernor's latest estimates of the
fiscal condition of California
came from a powerful Democra
tic foe, Sen. George Miller Jr.,
of Martinez, chairman of the
upper house finance committee.
Miller told a news conference
that "Gov. Reagan has misrep
resented the financial condition
of the state. All the cries and
warnings about financial insolv
ency are so much hogwash."
PARIS (AP) — A massive
strike of millions flooded across
France yesterday in a grass
roots upheaval that plunged the
nation into a stage of near-para
lysis and threatened the founda
tions of Charles de Gaulle's 10-
year-old Fifth Republic.
Nearly six million of the na
tion's 16 million-member work
force were idle and 250 factories
were forced to close down. Coal
mines in the provinces, air
fields and seaports came to a
standstill.
A monumental traffic jam
choked Paris. Commuters re>-
sorted to automobiles because
trains, subways and buses were
strikebound.
Taxi drivers voted to strike
Wednesday, thereby cutting off
all public transport.
Garbage piled up in the
streets; garbagemen have been
out since Saturday.
Housewives descended on
shops to stock up on foodstuffs.
Some tourists were stranded.
The stock market plunged.
Thousands lined up at banks
to make withdrawals in the fear
the walkouts would spread to
the financial sectors.
Opposition political leaders
conferred with trade union lead
ers in preparation for an all-out
bid in the National Assembly to
day to oust De Gaulle's govern
ment. An assembly debate on an
opposition motion of censure of
the government is to end with
a vote tomorrow night or early
Thursday.
Worker's demands varied from
place to place, but all were based
on economics. In most cases the
strikers want higher pay, a
shorter work week and earlier
retirement.
The workers' upheavel grew
out of a student revolt last week
over conditions in the French
educational system. Rioting stu
dents also demanded social

changes in all areas oi French
national life.
• Tourism Loses
LONDON (AP) — European
passengers flew over France,
skirted around it, or just stayed
home as French strikes threw
Paris - bound transport into
chaos yesterday. The loser was
French tourism.
Britons were warned that
travel to France could not be
guaranteed. Only one in four
Paris-bound flights operated out
of London's Heathrow Airport.
Many passengers, seeing the
warning notices and waiting
lines, turned around and went
home.
Channel ferries dropped pas
sengers and cars on the French
coast, but onward travel could
not be assured. Trains carrying
Continental sleepers were can
celed.
Nevertheless, French travel
agents assured families of for
eign tourists stranded in France
their relatives were being cared
for efficiently. A communique
from the Union of Travel Agents
said stranded tourists were
being looked after and being
helped to solve any problems.
Travel agents and air lines
were beseiged by stranded tour
ists trying to leave France.
Buses were pressed into service
and a number of American trav
el agencies booked rooms in ho
tels for their clients so they
could await their turn to board
a bus.
• Viet Peace Talks
PARIS (AP) — The U.S. dele
gation clung yesterday night to
a hunch that a break is coming
in the snagged preliminary talks
on peace in Vietnam. The Amer
icans sent a mission to London
to brief the Foreign Office in ad
vance of a trip to Moscow

Wednesday by Foreign Secretary
Michael Stewart.
Daniel Davidson of the U.S.
negotiating staff conferred in
London for an hour with Stew
art. The American was accom
panied by William Sullivan, the
U.S. ambassador to Laos, a
Vietnam neighbor. Sullivan, en
route to the United States, had
contacts in Vientiane, the Lao
tian capital, with North Viet
namese representatives in ad
vance of the Paris talks.
Up to the present, the discus
sion — in recess from last Satur
day until Wednesday — have, in
the view of both sides, produced
no progress.
But the Paris talks took on a
more international flavor with
the London contacts and with
an announcement that President
Charles de Gaulle would meet
separately today with the
chief U.S. negotiator, Ambassa
dor W. Averell Harriman and
with Xuan Thuy, the chief North
Vietnamese.
These developments stirred
speculation something new
might be stirring.
• Spock Jury Chosen
BOSTON (AP) — A 12 - man
jury was selected in federal
court yesterday to try Dr. Ben

the draft, The defense argued in
vain that women were discrimi

The international known
baby doctor went on trial with
four other defendants associated
with him in the anti-Vietnam
war movement. Peace demon
strators marched outside the
courthouse, but not in large
numbers.
Spock, 65, is on trial with Yale

graduate student at Harvard;

Mitchell Goodman, 44, of New

Marcus Raskin, 33, co-director
of the Institute for Political

They are charged with con

evade military service and of
conspiring to interrupt the in

across the country.
• Poor People Plan
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
leader of the Poor People's
Campaign said yesterday that
demonstrations "more militant

ever taken place in the history
of this nation" will begin within
a few days.
The Rev. Ralph David Aber
nothy, successor to the slain
civil rights leader Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr., refused to give
details.
He told cheering campaigners
in "Resurrection City, U.S.A."
that "We're gonna raise hell."
But he said it will be done non
violently.
On finances, he told followers
at the rally that there is enough
money to finsh the camp and
they shouldn't worry. He told
newsmen afterward that they
don't have the money needed
for the campaign but that the
effort has many friends and he
is sure that the American peo

Repulsed around Khe Sanh in
the far northwest and at Con
Thien, an eastern Marine an
chor just south of the demilitar

the North Vietnamese staged a
rocket attack on Camp Evans to
the south and destroyed an am
munition dump.
The command reported the at
tack caused light casualties at
Camp Evans, home of the U.S.
Ist Air Cavalry Division.
The fighting in the far north
showed the enemy's ability to
keep on the pressure over a
wide front extending from the
demilitarized zone southward to
Hue and the Marine base at Da
Nang, about 100 miles southeast
of the zone.
• Reagan Budget Hit
SACRAMENTO (AP) — A
top Democrat denounced as
"the old flim-flam game" Gov.
Reagan's announcement yester
day that an improved state fi
nancial picture will allow a $35
million tax cut for middle-in
come families.
A sharp reaction to the gov

ernor's latest estimates of the
fiscal condition of California
came from a powerful Democra
tic foe, Sen. George Miller Jr.,
of Martinez, chairman of the
upper house finance committee.
Miller told a news conference
that "Gov. Reagan has misrep
resented the financial condition
of the state. All the cries and
warnings about financial insolv
ency are so much hogwash."
PARIS (AP) — A massive
strike of millions flooded across
France yesterday in a grass
roots upheaval that plunged the
nation into a stage of near-para
lysis and threatened the founda
tions of Charles de Gaulle's 10-
year-old Fifth Republic.
Nearly six million of the na
tion's 16 million-member work
force were idle and 250 factories
were forced to close down. Coal
mines in the provinces, air
fields and seaports came to a
standstill.
A monumental traffic jam
choked Paris. Commuters re>-
sorted to automobiles because
trains, subways and buses were
strikebound.
Taxi drivers voted to strike
Wednesday, thereby cutting off
all public transport.
Garbage piled up in the
streets; garbagemen have been
out since Saturday.
Housewives descended on
shops to stock up on foodstuffs.
Some tourists were stranded.
The stock market plunged.
Thousands lined up at banks
to make withdrawals in the fear
the walkouts would spread to
the financial sectors.
Opposition political leaders
conferred with trade union lead
ers in preparation for an all-out
bid in the National Assembly to
day to oust De Gaulle's govern
ment. An assembly debate on an
opposition motion of censure of
the government is to end with
a vote tomorrow night or early
Thursday.
Worker's demands varied from
place to place, but all were based
on economics. In most cases the
strikers want higher pay, a
shorter work week and earlier
retirement.
The workers' upheavel grew
out of a student revolt last week
over conditions in the French
educational system. Rioting stu
dents also demanded social

changes in all areas oi French
national life.
• Tourism Loses
LONDON (AP) — European
passengers flew over France,
skirted around it, or just stayed
home as French strikes threw
Paris - bound transport into
chaos yesterday. The loser was
French tourism.
Britons were warned that
travel to France could not be
guaranteed. Only one in four
Paris-bound flights operated out
of London's Heathrow Airport.
Many passengers, seeing the
warning notices and waiting
lines, turned around and went
home.
Channel ferries dropped pas
sengers and cars on the French
coast, but onward travel could
not be assured. Trains carrying
Continental sleepers were can
celed.
Nevertheless, French travel
agents assured families of for
eign tourists stranded in France
their relatives were being cared
for efficiently. A communique
from the Union of Travel Agents
said stranded tourists were
being looked after and being
helped to solve any problems.
Travel agents and air lines
were beseiged by stranded tour
ists trying to leave France.
Buses were pressed into service
and a number of American trav
el agencies booked rooms in ho
tels for their clients so they
could await their turn to board
a bus.
• Viet Peace Talks
PARIS (AP) — The U.S. dele
gation clung yesterday night to
a hunch that a break is coming
in the snagged preliminary talks
on peace in Vietnam. The Amer
icans sent a mission to London
to brief the Foreign Office in ad
vance of a trip to Moscow

Wednesday by Foreign Secretary
Michael Stewart.
Daniel Davidson of the U.S.
negotiating staff conferred in
London for an hour with Stew
art. The American was accom
panied by William Sullivan, the
U.S. ambassador to Laos, a
Vietnam neighbor. Sullivan, en
route to the United States, had
contacts in Vientiane, the Lao
tian capital, with North Viet
namese representatives in ad
vance of the Paris talks.
Up to the present, the discus
sion — in recess from last Satur
day until Wednesday — have, in
the view of both sides, produced
no progress.
But the Paris talks took on a
more international flavor with
the London contacts and with
an announcement that President
Charles de Gaulle would meet
separately today with the
chief U.S. negotiator, Ambassa
dor W. Averell Harriman and
with Xuan Thuy, the chief North
Vietnamese.
These developments stirred
speculation something new
might be stirring.
• Spock Jury Chosen
BOSTON (AP) — A 12 - man
jury was selected in federal
court yesterday to try Dr. Ben
jamin Spock on charges of coun
seling American youth to avoid
the draft, The defense argued in
vain that women were discrimi
nated against on the panel.
The international known
baby doctor went on trial with
four other defendants associated
with him in the anti-Vietnam
war movement. Peace demon
strators marched outside the
courthouse, but not in large
numbers.
Spock, 65, is on trial with Yale
Chaplain William Sloane Coffin
Jr., 43; Michael Ferber, 23,
graduate student at Harvard;

Mitchell Goodman, 44, of New
York author and teacher; and
Marcus Raskin, 33, co-director
of the Institute for Political
Studies in Washington.
They are charged with con
spiring to "counsel, aid and
abet" young men to refuse or
evade military service and of
conspiring to interrupt the in
duction process at draft centers
across the country.
• Poor People Plan
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
leader of the Poor People's
Campaign said yesterday that
demonstrations "more militant
and more massive than have
ever taken place in the history
of this nation" will begin within
a few days.
The Rev. Ralph David Aber
nothy, successor to the slain
civil rights leader Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr., refused to give
details.
He told cheering campaigners
in "Resurrection City, U.S.A."
that "We're gonna raise hell."
But he said it will be done non
violently.
On finances, he told followers
at the rally that there is enough
money to finsh the camp and
they shouldn't worry. He told
newsmen afterward that they
don't have the money needed
for the campaign but that the
effort has many friends and he
is sure that the American peo
ple will come through with sup
port.
• Salisbury Quiet
SALISBURY, Md. (AP) —
While National Guardsmen with
rifles patroled the quiet streets
of Salisbury yesterday, Gov.
Spiro T. Agnew ordered another
all-night curfew to ward off a
renewal of Negro violence.
About 800 Guardsmen and 400
State Police were stationed in

the city of 18,000, sent in be
cause of two nights of disorder
touched off by the fatal shoot
ing Saturday of a Negro bur
glary suspect by a white police
man.
All schools were open and
business operations returned to
normal Monday following the
lifting of the curfew at 7 a.m.
State's Atty. Alfred T. Truitt
Jr. haid Henry was shot by Jer
ry C. Mason, a detective on the
police force, after a struggle
outside police headquarters.
Mason was charged with man
slaughter Sunday and released
on $1,500 bond.
• Supreme Court
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Supreme Court expanded the
right to be tried by jury yester
day and also open busy shop
ping centers to mass picketing.
The court held 7 to 2 that
states must grant the right to be
tried by jury set forth in the Bill
of Rights.
While handing down these de
cisions the court set the stage
for a full-blown debate after the
summer layoff on use of the
draft to punish young men who
publicly protest the war in Viet
nam.
The vehicle for consideration
of this heated issue is an appeal
by Jmes J. Oestereich, 2-
year-old divinity student, who
was stripped of his draft exemp
tion, classified 1 Aand scheduled
for induction when he turned in
his draft card to protest the
war.
The director of Selective Ser
vice, Lt. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey,
recommended last October that
draft boards speed the induction
of war protesters. The Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union, ap
pealing for Oestereich, claimed
this violated his constitutional
right to dissent.
