# Faculty Senate To Be Elected
## 
### 
Faculty members will elect 53
voting representatives to a new
Academic Senate at Stanford
next week.
The result of more than two
years' study of faculty organiza
tion, the Senate was approved
by the faculty in April and by
the Board of Trustees last week.
The president, the provost,
the academic deans, and the
academic secretary of the Uni
versity will serve ex-offlclo,
without vote. No students will
be represented.
The Senate will assume the
functions previously performed
by the nine-man Academic Coun
cil Executive Committee and the
940-member Academic Council,
which includes all of professor
ial rank.
The full Council will have
comprehensive power to over
rule Senate decisions and will
continue to meet quarterly dur
ing the academic year.
The Senate will meet at least
monthly during the academic
year. Its voting members,
chosen on a basis which reflects
both student enrollment and to
tal faculty within each School,
will include 25 members from
the School of Humanities and
Sciences; nine from Engineer
ing- eight from Medicine; two
ea'.h from Business, Earth Sci
ences, Education, and Law; and
one each from the Food Re
search Institute, Stanford Lin
ear Accelerator Center, and a
special group composed mainly
of University officers.
Ballots for most schools,

except Medicine, are expected
to be mailed Monday, accord
ing to Academic Secretary H.
Donald YVinbigler. It Is hoped
that the Senate will hold Its
first meeting before the end of
this academic quarter.
In a report explaining the ra
tionale for the Senate, the Aca
demic Council Executive Com
mittee said: "During the past
two decades, the Academic Coun
cil has increased more than
three fold, from 306 to 940 mem
bers. Moreover, with the evolu
tion of many specialized func
tions and programs within the
University, the faculty has be
come more and more hetero
geneous.
"As a decision-making body
and a forum for debate an com
plicated academic matters, the
present Academic Council is
handicapped both by size and by
the fragmented interests of its
membership.
"The fact that in recent
years attendance at its regu
lar meetings has rarely ex
ceeded 20() probably reflects
a widespread feeling either
that the agenda seldom in
cludes matters of genuine im
portance to the entire faculty
or that challenging new ideas
are not likely to originate on
the floor. . . .
"The Executive Committee is
much too small and is repre
sentative of and conversant with
far too few educational activi
ties of the University to function
effectively under present con
ditions."
