## Trustees' Statement Tells All 
### Michael Sweeney 
On May 16 the Board of Trus
tees issued a "Resolution" about
the Old Union sit-in. On the sur
face, this 200-word document
says only that such disruptions
"must no longer be tolerated at
Stanford."
But a careful reading of the
resolution reveals the trustees'
manifold confusion over the na
ture of the university which
they legally "own." Their atti
tude is clear if we scrutinze the
text of the resolution line by
line:
★ ★ ★
"Whereas Stanford Univer
sity exists to Increase human
knowledge and to develop un
derstanding and respect for
truth, especially among its
own faculty and students;..."
Stanford "exists" only to help
individual students educate
themselves. It must perform this
function decently before worry
ing about others.
I'm not paying $1770 tuition a
year because I have an altruistic
desire to "increase human knowl
edge." I want to learn something
from attending Stanford, and
what I want to learn isn't "un
derstanding and respect" for
truth, which is a pretentious way
of saying "accept what we tell
you." Boarding schools sugar
coat their version of truth with
"respect;" universities know bet
ter.
Naturally Stanford should in
crease general human knowledge
as an important by-product of
educating individual human be
ings. But the trustees mention
only the by-product. They seem
to want their university to be
a research institution turning
out voluminous literature to en
hance Stanford's prestige. The
excecrable state of undergradu
ate teaching here suggests that
the trustees' erroneous priorities
have the ascendancy.

"Whereas the pursuit of
knolwedge requires the free
exchange of ideas, however
unpopular, among all mem
bers of the academic commu>
nity; ..."
Free exchange of ideas? The
trustees have consistently re
fused to discuss publicly their
16-month search for a new uni
versity president. Not only will
they not name candidates, but
they refuse to talk about how
they are conducting the search,
what qualifications they think
important, or even their basic
conception of the presidency.
This doesn't indicate much of a
commitment to the "free ex
change of ideas."
★ ★ ★
"Whereas all recent experi
ence shows that confrontation
tactics, whether involving sit
ins or other coercive devices,
invariably subvert the very
nature and purpose of a uni
versity by substituting coer
cion by a militant minority
for orderly academic proce
dures, by making impossible
the rational evolution of the
university to meet changing
conditions, or by denying legi
timate freedom of speech or
action to those with whom
that militant minority dis
agrees; ..."
Certainly the harassment of
the CIA recruiter in November
was denial of "legitimate free
dom of speech or action." But the
sit-in May 6-8 had nothing to
do with the anti-CIA demonstra
tion. The immediate cause of
the sit-in was the administra
tion's refusal to engage in di
rect, public debate over student
conduct rules and the plight
of the seven students convicted
by the IJB. A less direct cause
was the years of stalling by the
administration over basic re
forms in judicial procedures and

rule-making for students.
"Orderly academic proce
dures" and "rational evolution"
are euphemisms beloved by pow
er structures everywhere. They
translate as: "Reform at a gla
cially slow pace, if at all." When
confronted by this attitude, it is
not surprising that large num
bers of students will turn to
the desperation tactic of civil
disobedience.
And civil disobedience is just
that: a desperation tactic. The
word "coercion" is a ludicrous
exaggeration of what students
attempted. By staging an order
ly, non-violent sit-in, they were
inviting the administration to
retaliate with police, tear gas,
mocking coercion, not using it.
★ ★ ★
"And whereas confrontation
tactics inevitably disrupt the
proper activities of the univer
sity and therefore waste
priceless intelligence which
should be contributing to a
solution of the world's prob
lems; ..."
Wow. This passage is another
example of the trustees' amazing
ability to discuss Stanford's
goals without using the word
"education." No "priceless intelli
gence" was wasted by the sit-in;
instead Stanford students were
stirred from their sluggish
apathy toward university affairs.
Anything that removes apathy
is educational. And education, I
must remind the trustees, is a
"proper activity of the univer
sity."
As for "a solution of the
world's problems," I can only in
vite our multi-millionaire trus
tees to visit the campus for a
week and listen to some of our
suggestions.
★ ★ ★
"Be It resolved, therefore,
that:
"Sit-ins and other activities

by any member o fthe univer
sity community that disrupt or
attempt to disrupt the activi
ties of the university must no
longer be tolerated at Stan
ford; ..."
The trustees have no business
saying what conduct will or will
not be tolerated at Stanford.
On May 9 their chief officer,
President Wallace Sterling, dele
gated authority over student reg
ulations to a council of six fac
ulty and five students.
Hopefully the faculty-student
council will show more insight
into the desirable "activities of
the university" than the trus
tees.

"And be it further resolved
that:
"This board requests that
the president, faculty, and stu
dents at Stanford continue
with the greatest sense of ur
gency their efforts to achieve
means of eliminating such dis
ruptive activities, which strike
at the very existence of the
university."
Existence of the university?
In the first sentence of the reso
lution, the trustees defined the
university as a peculiar machine
which churned out additions to
the store of human knowledge
while simultaneously teaching
students "respect for truth." If
that is the prevailing dogma at
Stanford University, it deserves
some "disruption." But I agree
with the Board of Trustees that
disorder is bad; reform tastes
sweeter when swallowed willing
ly.

Stanford "exists" only to help

I'm not paying $1770 tuition a

from attending Stanford, and
what I want to learn isn't "un

only the by-product. They seem

Free exchange of ideas? The

they not name candidates, but

Certainly the harassment of

the sit-in was the administra

was the years of stalling by the
administration over basic re

"Orderly academic proce

are euphemisms beloved by pow

translate as: "Reform at a gla

confronted by this attitude, it is
not surprising that large num

the desperation tactic of civil

And civil disobedience is just
that: a desperation tactic. The
word "coercion" is a ludicrous
exaggeration of what students
attempted. By staging an order

inviting the administration to
retaliate with police, tear gas,

Certainly the harassment of

the sit-in was the administra

of the seven students convicted

was the years of stalling by the
administration over basic re

rule-making for students.
"Orderly academic proce

are euphemisms beloved by pow

translate as: "Reform at a gla

confronted by this attitude, it is
not surprising that large num

the desperation tactic of civil
disobedience.
And civil disobedience is just
that: a desperation tactic. The
word "coercion" is a ludicrous
exaggeration of what students
attempted. By staging an order

inviting the administration to
retaliate with police, tear gas,
mocking coercion, not using it.
