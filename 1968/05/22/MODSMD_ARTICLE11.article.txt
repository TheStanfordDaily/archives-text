# Letters To The Editor
## Trustees In Financial Thumbscrew 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Berry's letter to the
Board of Trustees threatening
reallocation of $1.2 million he
donated in 1963 "to strengthen
religious programs on campus"
represents the archetype of out
side financial pressures acting
on the University.
Although, unlike Mr. Berry, I
do not personally know any of
the Trustees, I am an alumnus
(M.S. Physics, 1966) and have
no less right than he to influ
ence the use of money already
donated. If he makes good his
threat, and the Trustees accede,
I will request of the Trustees
that my donation to the Martin
Luther King Memorial Fund be
transferred to the Chapel pro
gram to offset, in a minor way,
the loss of Mr. Berry's gift.
I will request also that Stan
ford ask for no further dona
tions from me. Neither the King
nor Chapel programs, meritori
ous as they are, deserve my sup
port if administered by an ir
responsible Board of Trustees.
It will be interesting to learn
whether the Trustees reject Mr.
Berry's coercion as forcefully as
they did the recent student sit
in.

Man Of Inspiration
Editor, The Daily:
Dr. Page taught us more than
botany, which is one part of life.
After decades of botany labs and

phloem cross sections, he'd still
find "the best one yet" in a
neighbor's microscope. His ener
gy was a source of encourage
ment in and out of class. We
learned from him what a teach
er can be: a man of generous
inspiration.
A man who gives of himself
simply does live on. All of us who
have known him are grateful for
the life of Robert Page. We shar â€¢
the feeling of great loss with
his family.

ISo Sirens Respond
To Frat Call For Aid
Editor, The Daily:
In response to Bob Stone's
letter, I would like to add my
note of concern about the Stan
ford University Fire Depart
ment (SUFD).
Whether most people realize
it or not, there is no accessible
fire fighting system to fight a
fire of any consequence in any
of the new fraternity houses in
Cluster No. 1 (Kappa Sig, Theta
Delt, SAE, Phi Delt).
In each house there are three
soda-acid and one CO> fire ex
tinguishers. Concerned, I went
to the SUFD and asked why
there were no' fire hose systems
in the house. The Assistant
Chief told me that "In case of
fire, even of the most minor sort
(electrical, cigarettes on the
rug, etc.), call the fire depart

ment."
There are three call boxes lo
cated nearly 100 yards from
each house in the cluster, but I
seriously doubt if more than 30
per cent of the men know where
the call boxes are. It's not much
protection for a $2 million proj
ect.
Two weeks ago, at 2 a.m., I
noticed what looked like steam
coming out of the dryer in the
laundry room. After an inspec
tion, myself and others decided
we should call the fire depart
ment. The familiar response
was, "A man is on his way
now!" Reassured, we waited.
After 22 minutes had elapsed,
I began to lose hope. Finally,
jumping down out of his white
charger, a member of the Stan
ford Police Force showed up
and said he was responding for
the SUFD. When I asked him
what he knew about putting out
electrical fires he said, "Nuth
in\" "Why, then, did they send
you up here?" "I don't know,"
said he and left.
Well, the smoke quit and we
got a repairman up here Tues
day of the next week. As did Mr.
Stone, I would like to say I hope
our house never needs the SU
FD, 'cause we'd all burn to
death in our sleep before any
sirens would wake us up.

Facuity Vote Concerns
Rights, Responsibility
Editor, The Daily:
The resolutions of the resolu
tions of the Academic Council

passed at its meeting of May 8
have been predictably interpret
ed as a victory for demonstrat
ing students and a repudiation
of certain particular actions of
the President, the Provost and
the Interim Judicial Board
(IDJ). After time for reflection
and discussion, I feel an increas
ing obligation to explain to
those persons most especially
affected and to the community
at large the reasons why I sup
ported the Council's action.
In the first place, I agree en
tirely with the view that no rea
sonable person could consider
the Academic Council a compe
tent body to question the judg
ment of the IJB. As a matter of
fact, I am personally convinced
that the IJB made every reason
able effort to determine the
facts in the case brought before
them, and that the decision rec
ommended by the IJB to the
President was fair, just and
considerate.
However, I do not believe that
all the reasonableness resides in
the decision of the IJB; I also
feel that the demonstrating stu
dents were expressing a valid
point of view. This, as I see it,
is the view that law must be
based on the consent of the gov
erned, and specifically that stu
dents should have an effective
voice in the formulation of rec
ommendations relating to stu
dent behavior.
Being of a divided mind with
respect to the merits of the two
points of view being vigorously
put forward but also being
greatly encouraged by the re
cently announced progress of
the Committee of Fifteen to

ward a plan for permanent
rather than interim procedures
for such cases, I concurred with
the recommendation of the ma
jority of the Council to set aside
this reasonable decision of the
IJB made under unacceptable
arrangements.
A vote against law and order
is not to be taken lightly. In this
University society it can prop
erly be viewed only as a sign of
the urgency of the task of es
tablishing a new basis of regula
tions which will be universally
applied and unanimously sup
ported. The final report of C-15
promises to provide that basis,
and a referendum of the entire
community appears to be the
most effective way to assure
that support.
Only with this promise of a
renewed understanding of indi
vidual rights and responsibili
ties in our society can the action
of the Academic Council be rea
sonably accepted. Only in the
successful efforts of us all to
bring this promise to reality
will we avoid facing future con
frontations with equal ambiva
lence and frustration.
Thus, finally, I see my vote as
a vote for the position of the
students on this issue; as a re
pudiation of the administrative
procedures under dispute in this
case; and as a promise to take
personal responsibility to sup
port the new permanent ar
rangements for enforcing indi
vidual discipline soon to be
adopted.
Sincerely,
GENE F. FRANKLIN
