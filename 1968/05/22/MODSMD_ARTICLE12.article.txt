# A 						Conspiracy Of One
## Radio Peking Is Watching Us 
### Dan Snell 
Students may have been up
set to know that news of the
sit-in at the Old Union pene
trated as far as home. One jun
ior even decided to cancel his
parents' subscription to The
Daily before the demonstration
started in hopes that the paren
tal beings would not perceive
the fullness of what might be
happening.
But alas, not only did Radio
Akron pick up the news, it even
penetrated to Radio Peking.
As Michel Oksenberg, acting
assistant professor of political
science, points out. Radio Pe
king was generally "inside the
ballpark" on what they re
ported.
Nonetheless a report of
May 9 referring to Stanford
tells the world, "The demon
strating students set fire to
the building of the Naval Re
serve Officers Training Corps
on the campus."
I suppose Radio Peking could
n't very well phone Associate
Dean of Students Willard Wy
man for a denial of any link be
tween the protest and the flre as
other media did.
May 13 the flre incident was

cut or ignored in the broadcast.
Calling the suspensions of the
seven in the CIA case "unrea
sonable," Peking went on,
"Hundreds of students took over
the office of the university pres
ident on the night of May 6 and
held sit - ins there for three
days."
Again, I suppose at 5,000
miles the distance from the Old
Union to Building 10 does not
seem very big.
Oksenberg says these broad
casts should be viewed in light
of the recent statement by Co
munist Party Chairman Mao
Tsc-tung in which he proclaims
the solidarity of the Chinese
people witli the struggles of the
blacks in the United States.
In a round-up on US dem
onstrations broadcast May 6,
Radio Peking quotes ChaLr
man Mao, "the gTeat teacher
of the proletariat," saying,
"The young people are the
most active and vital force In
society."
Radio Peking goes on to com
ment, "The rapidly growing
movement of the students in the
United States will surely give
impetus to the general struggle

of the American people against
the barbarous rule of the mo
nopoly capitalist class and ac
celerate the rising of a new
storm of struggle."
In the right mood, Herbert
Packer could have said that; but
the adjectives would have been
different, no doubt.
Earlier (May 3) the peoples of
the world were informed from
Peking. "At present, US imper
ialism is being besieged ring
upon ring by the people of the
world, including the US people.
Thn day of its burial is not far
off."
Be that as it may, Mao seems
especially sensitive to student
uprisings, according to Oksen
berg, because they were impor
tant in his own rise to power in
the China of the 1930's and
1940'5.
So Mao may be watching
us. And that's a good thing if
you're a member of the local
Red Menace. But it's a bad
tiling if your father is a capi
talistic gun-runner from Tai
wan. As with the quality of
the r<'[MÂ»rting of Radio Pe
king, it's all a question of
relativity.
