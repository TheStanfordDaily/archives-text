# Administrative Challenge
## Working Against Dehumanization 
### 
(Editor's Note: This Is the
first part of an article written
by Bruce Campbell, exploring
the problems of administra
tion. It was submitted to the
Study of Education (SES) at
Stamford last summer, and
published In the DAILY in
October. Bemuse of its con
tinued relevance, we reprint it
this week in two parts.

By BRUCE CAMPBELL
"What is it about administra
tion," said the Dean, "that
seems to turn good men into
horses' asses?"
His frank statement pointed
to a problem facing Stanford's
and every other administration:
how to combat the almost demo
nically strong forces of dehuma
nization present in the act of ad
ministrating.
Those forces give ri.se to a
two-fold tragedy, both adminis
trative and personal. On the one
hand, administration carries
within it forces that tend to un
dermine administration itself;
but further, many of those who
administrate succumb on a per
sonal level as well to the strong
forces of dehumanization.
This article will discuss both
of these tragedies, looking at
their causes, remedies, and larg
er implications.
Signs of Understanding
There are at least three major
signs that administration is un
dermining itself. The first is an
administrator's refusal to deal
with any but the most immedi
ate problems. Questions which
involve reflection and long-range

planning are avoided.
This sign is perhaps the most
irksome to students, and much
of their discussion of education
in the years before the SES was
predicated on the position that
they were filling a University
lacuna to speak of goals of edu
cation, the relation of the Uni
versity to society, and related
questions. Their criticism seems
to have been tacitly accepted,
however, as a new administra
tive post for long-range plan
ning was created last year.
The second, and related, sign
is a loss of context. A focusing
of attention on problems requir
ing immediate decisions eventu
ally leads to making poor deci
sions. This is because any given
decision can only be made with
reference to a context larger
than itself.
Thus when all a person's time
is spent in making immediate
decisions, he loses the opportu
nity to reflect on the overall per
spective of what he is doing.
And this sacrifice will lead even
tually to the making of context
less decisions.
Bole Conflict
The third sign of administra
tive problems is the role con
flict. An administrative officer is
at one and the same time re
sponsible to academic bodies in
the faculty and to the hierar
chic, bureaucratic structure of
the administration.
On any given issue, where
does his highest loyalty fall? If
it is with the administration, he
loses his credibility with the fac
ulty and becomes "the adminis
tration's man." But if he sides
with the faculty, he is endan
gering his position in the admin
istrative hierarchy and there
can be no doubt that he has
grave responsibilities there.

How does a man integrate these
two roles? Maybe it cannot be
done.
There are several factors of
administration which may be
pointed to as causes of the prob
lems discussed above.
Harried Administrators
The most central of these
seems to be the time demands
made on administrators at Stan
ford. The schedule they keep is
so hectic that one feels that, at
any given time, the average ad
ministrator is approximately
thirteen minutes late to his last
appointment.
The kind of frazzled adminis
trative life led here does not
permit either deliberate treat
ment of long-range problems or
reflecting on perspectives larger
than the immediately present
one.
One can find several reasons
for the existence of this situa
tion. For one thing, Stanford
operates with a small adminis
trative staff in comparison with
other major universities, and
thus must spend proportionally
more of its total administrative
time in day-to-day decisions.
Besides the pressures exerted
by a too - high ratio between
daily problems and staff, there
are other structural factors
such as the monthly Board of
Trustees meeting which re
quires a week or more of work
out of every four.
•Administrative Mystique'
But more insidious than the
above two reasons is the admin
istrative mystique that, in the
words of one administrator,
causes some men to "revel in
having two people on the phone
at once." Being chaotically busy
is something held up as a stan
dard to be emulated, at least
among some members of the ad

ministration.
Other than the time demands
made on administrators, the
problems of role are the most
important causes of administra
tive self-undermining.
Role conflict, in which men
get pulled in two directions, is
one aspect of the problem, but
probably not the most impor
tant. As more central, one would
cite the fact that the adminis
trator is part of a hierarchical
bureaucracy in which "expedi
ency" is the key word.
Identifying with Role
A further role problem, and
one related to time demands, is
that an administrator has to
make so many appearances —
at committee meetings, at social
gatherings, etc. — in his role,
that he can easily come to iden
tify with it. This relates more
centrally to the personal trag
edy to be discussed below, but it
has its strictly administrative
aspects as well.
A person who is always in one
box never gets outside that bix
to put the box in perspective.
In other words, just as the time
demands prevent the adminis
trator from stepping back to get
perspective, so do the role de
mands inhibit his attempts to
step outside his function to put
it in perspective.
There are several solutions
which have been proposed to
solve the problems of adminis
tration outlined above. Sabbati

cals have been encouraged both
as an opportunity for reflection
and perspective-gaining and as
a way to say to a man "you're
not indispensable, we did with
out you for a year."
Rotate Posts
Rotation of administrative
posts, so that no man serves for
more than, say. throe years, has
also received attention.
There are problems with this
suggestion, however, because, in
the words of one administrator,
"many members of the faculty
wouldn't serve in the adminis
tration for one year." Perhaps
the inevitability of a profes
sional, permanent administra
tion must be accepted.
One way to circumvent at
least some of the problems
caused by a professional ad
ministration would be to clear
ly differentiate policy decisions
from practice and to have pol
icy decisions made by univer
sity • wide committees. This is
difficult to work in practice, be
cause professional administra
tions tend to win many battles
by the default of the committee
involved.
'Knowledge Is Power'
"Knowledge is power" and no
where is this truer than in com
mittee - administration relations.
It often seems that policy deci
sions depend on a thorough
knowledge of daily practice and
this, of course, only the admin
istrator has.
