# The 						Washington Merry-Go-Round
## A 						Hawk Changes Feathers 
### Drew Pearson 
Rep. Charles S. Gubser, R-
Calif., has just come back from
a taxpayer-financed junket to
South Vietnam to turn hand
springs regarding the war.
Gubser is a long-time hawk,
and no later than February of
this year proposed using low
grade tactical nuclear weapons
in Vietnam. Today he has com
pletely reversed himself.
"I do not favor the use of nu
clear weapons of any kind," he
recenitly told a group of Stan
ford University scientists. "I do
not foresee circumstances where
the use of tactical nuclear
weapons would be appropriate
in the future," Gubser emphati
cally protested.
"I do not now advocate, nor
have I ever advocated, irrational
acts which could lead to nuclear
war," said the frightened Cali
fornia Congressman.
The reason for Gubsor's sud
den right-about-face on nuclear
weapons is the fact that the
former mayor of San Jose, Jo
seph L. Pace, is challenging him
in the Republican primary. Also
Gubser has found a lot of peace
sentiment in his California dis
trict.
As a result, he now proclaims
that the whole "war was a mis
take," and has said: "I oppose
more troops for Vietnam . . ."
On the trip Gubser spent
three days in Hong Kong visit
ing his tailor and only four days
in Vietnam. He spent only one
day in Korea, where there are
constant hostilities across the
38th parallel with danger of an
other war breaking.
The Reagan Challenge
One of Richard Nixon's most
significant tests will come in Or
egon on May 28, and it won't be
with Nelson Rockefeller.
It will be with Gov. Ronald
Reagan of California, who not
only has his name entered in
Oregon but has been spending
money as if he meant business.
Reagan's Oregon campaign
manager is Tom Hazen. former
president of the Portland Cham
ber of Commerce, who has
bought large blocks of radio and
TV time and is pulling all the
stops to elect his candidate.
Oregon is considered Rocke
feller territory. In 1964 he ran
in the primary against both
Goldvvater and Nixon, clobber
ing the former and leaving
Nixon so far behind that it was
pathetic. On primary election
night you could have shot a
cannon through Nixon head
quarters without hitting a soul.
But this time Rocky is
strangely silent. Not many peo
ple know it, but he has 50,000
fresh signatures on an unused
petition putting him in the race.
The signers are out on a limb
and a little unhappy about it be
cause Rocky did not go through
with his plans. But each one of
them is a potential write - in
vo tor â€”if the governor of New
York merely says the word.
Rev. Ralph Abernathy, leader
of the Poor People's March, has
left a sour impression on tele
vision, but he made the oppo
site impression on a group of
Senators and Representatives
with whom he met behind

closed doors. He was reasonable
and in no way demanding.
Sen. Ed Brooke, R.-Mass., first
Negro to serve in the Senate in
100 years, inquired if he had
said, as quoted, that he planned
to turn Washington "upside
down."
"I did not say we would turn
Washington upside down," Ab
ernathy replied. "I said we
would turn the system upside
down. By system I meant the
poverty and second-class station
that the poor people in the ghet
to are forced to endure.
"You must not blame me for
speaking out about these things.
It is incumbent on me as the
leader of this march to do so.
If I didn't, I would not be a
leader very long. So I have to
be aggressive at times, even
though white people generally
and some of you at this meeting
may not agree with me. I hope
you understand this."
Not Enough Votes
Abernathy wasn't subjected to
any direct criticism or needling,
though excitable Rep. Clarence
Long, D.-Md., did speak out at
one time.
"I have voted for every civil

rights measure enacted by Con
gress," he said, "but if I voted
for all you are now asking for,
I'd be defeated. Please be spe
cific and state priorities in this
proposed $30 billion program of
aid you want. There aren't
enough votes in Congress to
give it all to you."
"I'll be happy to," replied Ab
emathy. "First of all, we need
three million jobs in five years
and one million houses in the
next five years. We are also ask
ing you to feed the poor and
give us adequate medical care,
which is greatly needed by
black people. We are not asking
for welfare, except of an emer
gency nature, but we would like
to have a guaranteed annual
wage."
"How soon do you want all
this?" asked Long. "Surely, you
do not expect this session of
Congress to do all of it."
"No, we don't expect this ses
sion or the next one to meet all
of our needs," said Abernathy.
"But we certainly expect this
session to show some progress
in dealing with these imperative
problems."
