## 'Workshop' Poems 
### DAN SNELL 
The most recent "Workshop"
is given over to poetry, and
though sometimes student poet
ry is a disconcerting thing to be
given over to, in this case it is
not.
Editor David Hibbard and his
group have chosen nine poems
that are frequently of uneven
quality, but there are good
phrases and good moment em
bedded in the magazine.
By far the best poems in
the magazine are the first
two. The first, R. K. Brown's
reflection on words that are
"worn to precision" is a tight
statement that recalls the best
Winters and Cunningham.
Lisa Yount's "A Woman's

Question" also shows craftsman
ship. She has, as Winters might
have said, a "good ear" for the
sound of words together.
But then you turn the page
and you get "Sunday After
noon" (shades of "Sunday Morn
ing") by Julian Sapirstein, and
you wish you hadn't. It seems
to be about a woman going
through menopause, "whence
springs human tragedy."
In the rather trite denouement
(which lasts three pages) we
get other equally poetic lines.
What passes for insight in the
poem is perverted by the desire
to imitate Wallace Steven's
poem (which was by the way,
also too long).
"Her Short While" by K.
Rousek is, of all things,
riiymed. It may also be met
rical, but Y didn't feel like
counting lines like "She picked
a rosebud for her patient cat."
There are other better mo
ments in the rest of "Work
shop," including especially Lisa
Yount's "By The Bed Next To
My Aunt." And Jane Isenberg's
untitled poem is worth treasur
ing if only for her description
of someone as "so full of under
standing/ and luncheon enthus
iasm."
The drawings in this issue are
not so ambitious as those in the
last and so come off much bet
ter in spite of the mimeograph
ing. The "mere 15 cents" the
thing sells for will be worth it
and to read it is moderately
good for your soul.
