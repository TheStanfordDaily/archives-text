# Black Enrollment To Double In Fall
## 
### 
Black students in Stanford's
freshman class will nearly dou
ble this fall, early reports in
dicate. The total is expected to
increase from 37 in this year's
entering class to 72 in an enter
ing class of about 1250 next fall.
As part of an intensified cam
paign to attract black students,
announced last month, the Stan
for Black Student Union tele
phoned those admitted urging
them to choose Stanford. More
than 4 out of 5 did so.
Following Martin Luther
King's assassination, Stanford
announced it would try to
double minority student en
rollment to a total of 350
among more than 11,000 stu
dents by 1969-70.
Estimated costs for the pro
gram are expected to reach
about $1 million annually, main
ly for sharply expanded student
aid. The program is in general
accord with recommendations
made by a student-faculty ad
missions and financial aid report
April 2 and with demands pre
sented by the Black Student
Union April 8.
In all, 77 black students were
admitted by the University in
early April as part of its regular
program. At present, 64 of these
students have indicated they will
enroll next year.
In addition, eight black stu
dents and three Mexican Ameri

cans will be admitted in a spe
cial new program for students
from minority groups, an
nounced last month.
As judged by grade point
averages and test scores, this
group was well below others
admitted to the University,
according to Prof. Robert
Hess of the School of Educa
tion, who helped develop the
selection criteria and organize
academic support for them
after they enter Stanford next
fall.
Selected from students known
to the Admissions Office and re
cruited by other students on
campus, this pilot group was
chosen on the basis of high mo
tivation for academic work and
confidence in their ability to
achieve, if given an opportunity.
Other criteria included:
• Demonstrated capacity to
overcome socio-economic back
ground not normally conducive
to achievement;
• Awareness of need for aca
demic training to achieve per
sonal goals;
• Commitment to ideals
which go beyond personal aspir
ations and awareness of the
need to deal with contemporary
social problems;
• Readiness to adopt to a new
environment and previous lead
ership in school, community, or
other activities, such as employ
ment or volunteer work.
