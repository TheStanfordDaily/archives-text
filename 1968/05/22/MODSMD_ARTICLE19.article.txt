# TV Circuit To Link Colleges, Industries
## 
### 
Engineering firms in the vicin
ity of Stanford University will
be linked even more closely with
the campus when a new uni
versity-industry instructional
television network for advanced
instruction goes into operation,
hopefully by next January.
The Stanford Board of Trus
tees has approved plans for fi
nancing and operating of the
network.
The four-channel television
system, which will be in the
2500 megahertz ITFS (Instruc
tional Television Fixed Service)
microwave band, has already
been approved by the Federal
Communications Commission
(FCC). Transmissions in this
hand cannot be received on con
ventional TV sets, so the system
is essentially "closed circuit."
A two-way video-audio link
with the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley is planned
as well, according to Dean
Joseph M. Pettit of Stanford's
School of Engineering, who is
also a member of the FCC's
national ITFS advisory com
mittee.
One-way video and two-way
audio links with San Jose State
College and Santa Clara Uni
versity are included in the plan.
To date, 10 organizations from
San Francisco to San Jose have
announced their definite inten
tion to participate in the net
work from its inception, ac
cording to Associate Dean Don
ald J. Grace, who is in charge
of the Stanford instructional
television program.
Meanwhile, the plan is now
under active consideration by
some 30 additional industrial
organizations, with many others
yet to be contacted.
The main purposes of the tele
vision system are to facilitate
an existing part-time graduate

program wherein company en
gineers take advanced courses
for degree credit, and to add
continuing education offerings
in their special fields, said As
sociate Dean Farrell McGhie,
who directs the School's Honors
Cooperative Program (HCP).
Membership in the network
will be open to all industrial
firms and government organiza
tions in the area.
More than 600 working en
gineers now take graduate in
struction for credit In HCP,
but they have to attend classes
on campus. With televised
classes they can take the same
courses from the same pro
fessors in classrooms at their
own company locations.
Considerable time and travel
expense will be saved. More
courses can be taken, speeding
progress to a graduate degree.
Audio return facilities from
each company will permit re
mote students to ask questions
and participate in class discus
sions during the lectures.
Additional students also can
be served. Working engineers
who do not want academic credit
can take courses as nonregis
tered students. Others can "sit
in" on televised classes as audit
ors.
Student fees will remain the
same as for HCP, with lower
rates for nonregistered students
and auditors. An additional
charge will be made for tele
vised courses to defray the TV
operating costs.

Student fees will remain the
same as for HCP, with lower
rates for nonregistered students
and auditors. An additional
charge will be made for tele
vised courses to defray the TV
operating costs.
Engineering firms in the vicin
ity of Stanford University will
be linked even more closely with
the campus when a new uni
versity-industry instructional
television network for advanced
instruction goes into operation,
hopefully by next January.
The Stanford Board of Trus
tees has approved plans for fi
nancing and operating of the
network.
The four-channel television
system, which will be in the
2500 megahertz ITFS (Instruc
tional Television Fixed Service)
microwave band, has already
been approved by the Federal
Communications Commission
(FCC). Transmissions in this
hand cannot be received on con
ventional TV sets, so the system
is essentially "closed circuit."
A two-way video-audio link
with the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley is planned
as well, according to Dean
Joseph M. Pettit of Stanford's
School of Engineering, who is
also a member of the FCC's
national ITFS advisory com
mittee.
One-way video and two-way
audio links with San Jose State
College and Santa Clara Uni
versity are included in the plan.
To date, 10 organizations from
San Francisco to San Jose have
announced their definite inten
tion to participate in the net
work from its inception, ac
cording to Associate Dean Don
ald J. Grace, who is in charge
of the Stanford instructional
television program.
Meanwhile, the plan is now
under active consideration by
some 30 additional industrial
organizations, with many others
yet to be contacted.
The main purposes of the tele
vision system are to facilitate
an existing part-time graduate

program wherein company en
gineers take advanced courses
for degree credit, and to add
continuing education offerings
in their special fields, said As
sociate Dean Farrell McGhie,
who directs the School's Honors
Cooperative Program (HCP).
Membership in the network
will be open to all industrial
firms and government organiza
tions in the area.
More than 600 working en
gineers now take graduate in
struction for credit In HCP,
but they have to attend classes
on campus. With televised
classes they can take the same
courses from the same pro
fessors in classrooms at their
own company locations.
Considerable time and travel
expense will be saved. More
courses can be taken, speeding
progress to a graduate degree.
Audio return facilities from
each company will permit re
mote students to ask questions
and participate in class discus
sions during the lectures.
Additional students also can
be served. Working engineers
who do not want academic credit
can take courses as nonregis
tered students. Others can "sit
in" on televised classes as audit
ors.
Student fees will remain the
same as for HCP, with lower
rates for nonregistered students
and auditors. An additional
charge will be made for tele
