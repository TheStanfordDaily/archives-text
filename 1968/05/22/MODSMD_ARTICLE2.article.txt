# Candidate Admits Change Of Heart
## 
### DIARMUID McGUIRE 
About a year ago a freshman
from San Jose State College
paused on the edge of the Gen
eration Gap and attempted to
heave a message about Vietnam
to the other side. On the far
bank stood his father, Dr. Joseph
Pace, former mayor of San Jose.
Evidently Malcolm Pace got
his message across. A year ago
his dad was a Nixon Republican.
Today Dr. Pace, a short, ener
getic surgeon, favors the uni
lateral withdrawal of the United
States from the Vietnam war.
Moreover, Pace is opposing
Rep. Charles Gubser, a ranking
member of the House Armed
Services Committee, in the forth
coming Republican primary.
Peace is the most important is
sue in his campaign.
"We have nothing to win in
Vietnam," Pace told The Daily
in an exclusive interview recent
ly. "We don't reserve to win.
We've gotten involved in a civil
war. It's none of our business."
Pace's attempt to unseat Gub
ser has been complicated by
changes in the incumbant Con
gressman's position on Vietnam.
As recently as February Gubser
was suggesting that the use of
tactical nuclear weapons might
be a way to bring a quick end
to the contlict. Today he calls
the war a "mistake" and opposes
the commitment of more troops.

But this has not slowed
down Pace's free • swinging
fight to depose the veteran Rep
resentative, who has not been
challenged In a primary since
he was first elected 16 years
ago.
Among the unorthodox tactics
of the Pace campaign are a suit
in the Federal District Court for
Northern California which would
enjoin Gubser to define himself
as either a hawk or a dove on
Vietnam, and an offer of $500 to
anyone who can produce Gubser
at a public meeting to debate
with Pace.
Pace is particularly critical of
what he calls Gubser's hypocrisy
concerning the draft. The Tenth
Congressional district, which
Gubser represents, includes
Stanford, and Gubser has been
critical of Stanford students who
oppose the selective service sys
tem.
Pace maintains that Gubser
avoided service in World War II
by quitting a teaching post in
the middle of the school year in
order to take up full-time farm
ing, which was a deferred occu
pation at that time.
"It is a strange and horrible
situation where a man . . . who
took advantage of a clause in the
selective service laws to go on to
green political pastures talks like
a hero when the draft situation
of others comes into play," Pace
says.
Pace served as a Navy flight
surgeon in the Pacific in the Sec
ond World War. But he appears
to question the fact that young
people are being sent to jail for
refusing induction today.
"If the only offense was pro
testing the Vietnam war, I
would favor amnesty," he
says. As an alternative to a
prison sentence, he suggests
that those who refuse mili
tary service be given a chance
to Join a non - combatant)
agency, like the Public Health
Service.
The main force of Pace's at
tack, however, is directed against
Gubser's record as a member of
the House. "There is not a bill
bearing his name after sixteen
years in Congress," Pace says.
"But he has yet to raise his
voice against escalation of the
war."
Pace is quick to point out
Gubser's record as a world tra
veler. The Congressman recent
ly returned from Vietnam with
the message that "dissent is al
lowed and exists to a consider
able extent" under the Thieu
regime.
"He didn't do anything but
go over there and interview the
military," Pace told The Daily.
"He should have talked to the
members of the South Vietna
mese assembly who are in jail."
Pace's criticism of United

State's foreign policy goes be
yond opposition to the Vietnam
war. "We must get rid of the
phobia of monolithic Commu
nism," he says."The best buffer
against China would be a strong,
independent Vietnam."
Among Pace's other goals as
a Congressman are:
• the reduction of penalties
for marijuana opssession. He
says that it is "archaic" to con
sider the possession of mari
juana a felony.
• the admission of China to
the United Nations. "It's para
noid to have China outside the
U.N.," he says.
• increased responsiveness by
Congress to the people, particu
larly to the nation's youth.
• the elimination of the draft,
which would be replaced by a
volunteer army.
Pace's dinner-table conversa
tions with his son may have in
fluenced his opinions on these
subjects and others. Pie says
that Malcolm's ideas were a
"challenge" and a "stimulus"
that caused him to investigate is
sues like Vietnam. "I had to
figure out what made him click,"
Pace says.
The question is, what does the
Pace family discuss now that
they agree on Vietnam? Their
mealtimes are probably more
tranquil now that father and son
are closer politically. "It was
a relief to him for me to stop
giving Nixon speeches," Dr. Pace
reports.
