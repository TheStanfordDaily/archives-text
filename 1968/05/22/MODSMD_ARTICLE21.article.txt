# Phone Service Tries To Prevent Suicides
## 
### 
The Santa Clara Mental Health
Association has recently revital
ized a 24-hour, seven day-a-week
phone service for immediate
consultation to persons thinking
of suicide or someone calling
in about them.
By dialing San Jose 287-2424,
despondent students may secure
help from the volunteer manned
Suicide and Crisis Service, a re
port of the association says.
The volunteers — some of
them students themselves —
operate in the new San Jose
Mental Health Center and are
thus able, at all times, to con
sult with a social worker, psy
chologist or psychiatrist, on
call.
Mental health professionals
are not dealing directly with the
calls, because so many of them
are inappropriate, the report
says. Nevertheless, the more
than 80 volunteers were care
fully screened and trained.
The service is unique in Cali
fornia, being operated jointly
by the County Mental Health
Association and the County
Health Department.
When a call comes in, a volun
teer immediately begins to fill
out a special form which pro
vides space for comments on
what is said over the telephone,
name and address, possible re
ferrals to other agencies and a
"lethality meter."
The latter is a system of scor
ing the possible dangers of sui
cide—the mention of certain
forms of self-destruction are

likely to be more dangerous
than others.
As a worker circles the var
ious numbers on the sheet,
he can see quickly whether or
not a score which suggests im
mediate danger is building up.
The chief aim of the service
is not to intervene directly in
the case, but to refer those who
call in to other agencies for
help. However, if intervention is
required, the agency can do this,
too.
In most cases, a talk with a
friendly voice is as much help
as anything else. Volunteers us
ually spend at least half an hour
on the phone with a troubled
person, but some calls last up to
four hours, the service center
reports.
Cases in which direct emerg
ency interventions are required
are a minority of calls, the re
port says. About two ambu
lances a week are dispatched
on an average, usually to some
one who has taken an overdose
of pills.
About 20 to 30 people each
week make attempts on their
lives in Santa Clara County;
two or three people kill them
selves in that interval.
Student volunteers are urg
ently needed at all times, said
Gloria N. Ross, administrative
director of the agency. She em
phasized that this volunteering
opportunity might help some
Stanford students to find a chal
lenging and rewarding summer
job.

on the phone with a troubled
person, but some calls last up to
four hours, the service center
reports.
Cases in which direct emerg
ency interventions are required
are a minority of calls, the re
port says. About two ambu
lances a week are dispatched
on an average, usually to some
one who has taken an overdose
of pills.
About 20 to 30 people each
week make attempts on their
lives in Santa Clara County;
two or three people kill them
selves in that interval.
Student volunteers are urg
ently needed at all times, said
Gloria N. Ross, administrative
director of the agency. She em
phasized that this volunteering
opportunity might help some
Stanford students to find a chal
lenging and rewarding summer
job.
The Santa Clara Mental Health
Association has recently revital
ized a 24-hour, seven day-a-week
phone service for immediate
consultation to persons thinking
of suicide or someone calling
in about them.
By dialing San Jose 287-2424,
despondent students may secure
help from the volunteer manned
Suicide and Crisis Service, a re
port of the association says.
The volunteers — some of
them students themselves —
operate in the new San Jose
Mental Health Center and are
thus able, at all times, to con
sult with a social worker, psy
chologist or psychiatrist, on
call.
Mental health professionals
are not dealing directly with the
calls, because so many of them
are inappropriate, the report
says. Nevertheless, the more
than 80 volunteers were care
fully screened and trained.
The service is unique in Cali
fornia, being operated jointly
by the County Mental Health
Association and the County
Health Department.
When a call comes in, a volun
teer immediately begins to fill
out a special form which pro
vides space for comments on
what is said over the telephone,
name and address, possible re
ferrals to other agencies and a
"lethality meter."
The latter is a system of scor
ing the possible dangers of sui
cide—the mention of certain
forms of self-destruction are

likely to be more dangerous
than others.
As a worker circles the var
ious numbers on the sheet,
he can see quickly whether or
not a score which suggests im
mediate danger is building up.
The chief aim of the service
is not to intervene directly in
the case, but to refer those who
call in to other agencies for
help. However, if intervention is
required, the agency can do this,
too.
In most cases, a talk with a
friendly voice is as much help
as anything else. Volunteers us
ually spend at least half an hour
on the phone with a troubled
person, but some calls last up to
four hours, the service center
reports.
