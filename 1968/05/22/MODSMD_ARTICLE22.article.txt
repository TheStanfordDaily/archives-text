# Handy Administrators' Guide: How To Deal With A Protest
## 
### 
CHICAGO (CPS) — In deal
ing with student demonstra
tions, college administrators
ought to use such tactics as
photographing demonstrators
and a public relations campaign
to keep the students "off bal
ance," according to the deputy
attorney general of California.
Writing in the May issue of
College and University Business,
a magazine for college adminis
trators, Raymond M. Momboisse
offers several "Tactics for col
leges facing student demonstra
tions." Among them:
—The administration should
gather information about the
students and their methods
and co-ordinate its "intelli
gence" operations with local
police. This includes having
observers attend any public
planning sessions.
—The administration should
find out who is the "actual"
leader of the demonstration.
"Often those who are publicly
paraded as leaders are merely
puppets of the true leaders who
for various reasons wish to re
main unknown, and unseen,"
Momboisse says.
—"Almost any contact with
the demonstration groups must
be considered as a scouting or
probing operation to test the
types of counter-measures to be
employed."
—During the demonstration,
photographs should be taken of
the demonstrators and their con

duct, since they may produce
evidence of illegal activity or
may counter adverse publicity.
—"The college's public rela
tions campaign," says Mom
boisse, "must be aggressive so
as to keep the opposition con
stantly off balance."
—When demands are "patent
ly beyond all reason" a mediat
ing conference will merely give
demonstrators recognition and
status. Momboisse says demands
can be divided into those which
are reasonable and those which
are not, although he gives no
criteria for such a division. "Na
turally," he adds, "once the pro
testers have lost public support,
there should be no meetings ex
cept on the college's terms."
—There should be two tape
recordings of any conference,
one made by each side. Accord
ing to Momboisse, "This pro
cedure assures an accurate rec
ord of the proceedings and tends
to restrain the demonstrations."
Momboisse prefaces his rec
ommendations with an analysis
of student protests. He says
there are training schools for
demonstrators and that ''Not
only are the rank and file
trained, but more and more
there is developing in this coun
try a group of experienced, in
telligent leaders."
He said demonstrators often
have legal advisors, fly to

their brothers' campuses to
help out, mainly want pub
licity, conduct "intelligent
evaluations," and recruit pro
fessors "fresh from the fever
fringes of our great univers
ities."
When it comes to rallies,
prosecutor Momboisse suggests
that school administrators tread
carefully. While civil disobed
ience is "the deliberate violation
of the law"—it justifies calling
the police—demonstrations do
constitute lawful assemblages.
He says that "a demonstration
conducted in a lawful manner
must be tolerated .... irrespec
tive of how repugnant the
cause."

—"The college's public rela
tions campaign," says Mom
boisse, "must be aggressive so
as to keep the opposition con
stantly off balance."
—When demands are "patent
ly beyond all reason" a mediat
ing conference will merely give
demonstrators recognition and
status. Momboisse says demands
can be divided into those which

are not, although he gives no
criteria for such a division. "Na
turally," he adds, "once the pro
testers have lost public support,

recordings of any conference,

Momboisse prefaces his rec
ommendations with an analysis
of student protests. He says
there are training schools for
demonstrators and that ''Not

trained, but more and more

He said demonstrators often
have legal advisors, fly to

their brothers' campuses to
help out, mainly want pub
licity, conduct "intelligent
evaluations," and recruit pro
fessors "fresh from the fever
fringes of our great univers
ities."
When it comes to rallies,
prosecutor Momboisse suggests
that school administrators tread
carefully. While civil disobed
ience is "the deliberate violation
of the law"—it justifies calling
the police—demonstrations do
constitute lawful assemblages.

conducted in a lawful manner
must be tolerated .... irrespec

CHICAGO (CPS) — In deal
ing with student demonstra
tions, college administrators
ought to use such tactics as
photographing demonstrators
and a public relations campaign
to keep the students "off bal
ance," according to the deputy
attorney general of California.
Writing in the May issue of
College and University Business,
a magazine for college adminis
trators, Raymond M. Momboisse
offers several "Tactics for col
leges facing student demonstra
tions." Among them:
—The administration should
gather information about the
students and their methods
and co-ordinate its "intelli
gence" operations with local
police. This includes having
observers attend any public
planning sessions.
—The administration should
find out who is the "actual"
leader of the demonstration.
"Often those who are publicly
paraded as leaders are merely
puppets of the true leaders who
for various reasons wish to re
main unknown, and unseen,"
Momboisse says.
—"Almost any contact with
the demonstration groups must
be considered as a scouting or
probing operation to test the
types of counter-measures to be
employed."
—During the demonstration,
photographs should be taken of
the demonstrators and their con

duct, since they may produce
evidence of illegal activity or
may counter adverse publicity.
