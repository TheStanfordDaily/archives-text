# Vote At 18?
## 
### PHIL SEMAS 
WASHINGTON (CPS) — A
Senate subcommittee completed
hearings this week on a Constitu
tional amendment to lower the
voting age to 18.
Affected would be 12 million
persons between the ages of 18
and 21, 47 per cent of whom are
college students. Only Georgia
and Kentucky have lowered the
voting age to 18, while Alaska
and Hawaii, when entering the
Union, had voting ages of 19 and
20 respectively.
The bill is sponsored by 44
senators, including Majority
Leader Mike Mansfield (D-Mont)
and Minority Leader Everett
Dirkson (R-Ill.), and thus seems
likely to pass the Senate. But
the amendment faces several ob
stacles to adoption which were
brought out in the subcommit
tee testimony.
The biggest problem In get
ting the bill through the Sen
ate may be the argument that
the decision on a minimum
voting age should be left to
the individual states.
Several opponents of the bill
argued that 18-year-olds should
not be given the vote because
they do not have many other le
gal rights of citizenship, such as
making contracts and marrying,
without parental consent.
Supporters of the bill respond
ed that these same arguments
were made for denying women
the right to vote, since women
were prohibited from making
contracts and owning land in
many states when they were
given the vote.
Supporters also noted that 18-
year-olds do have many adult re
sponsibilities, including their
draft eligiblity. They argued
that if 18-year-olds were being
asked to die for American for
eign policy objectives, they ought
to have a role in shaping those
objectives.
The recent wave of student
demonstrations may also prove
to be an obstacle, especially In
the House, which recently vot
ed to deny federal aid to stu
dents who participate in un
lawful campus demonstra
tions.
At the hearings, opponents of

the bill, including Sens. Spessard
Holland (D-Fla.) and Jack Miller
(R-Iowa), said that the demon
strations show a lack of matur
ity on the part of many 18, 19,
and 20-year-olds, who "are prone
to take an extreme point of view
and push their ideas to the ex
clusion of all others," according
to Miller.
Some proponents of the bill, in
cluding subcommittee chairman
Birch Bayh (D-Ind.), said only
a small minority participate in
such demonstrations.
But Sen. Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.)
took a different tack. He argued
that demonstrations were a good
reason for lowering the voting
age.
"I am convinced," he said,
"that self-styled student leaders
who urge acts of civil disobedi
ence would find themselves with
no support if students were
given a more meaningful role in
the electoral process."
R. Spencer Oliver, president
of the Young Democratic
Clubs of America, said he did
not believe that "the right to
vote will . . . prevent demon-i
strations and protests," but he
said it would "ease the frus
trations of a generation ob
viously intent on having a
voice in the determination of
their own destinies."
National Student Association
President Ed Schwartz, on the
other hand, told the subcommit
tee that the 18-year-old vote "will
open new avenues for student
pressure and student power."
He said the Senate would have
to choose what kind of response
it will make to campus activism
— a constructive response such
as lowering the voting age or a
destructive response such as the
House bill denying scholarships
to demonstrators.

to take an extreme point of view
and push their ideas to the ex
clusion of all others," according
to Miller.
Some proponents of the bill, in
cluding subcommittee chairman
Birch Bayh (D-Ind.), said only
a small minority participate in
such demonstrations.
But Sen. Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.)
took a different tack. He argued
that demonstrations were a good
reason for lowering the voting
age.
"I am convinced," he said,
"that self-styled student leaders
who urge acts of civil disobedi
ence would find themselves with
no support if students were
given a more meaningful role in
the electoral process."
R. Spencer Oliver, president
of the Young Democratic
Clubs of America, said he did
not believe that "the right to
vote will . . . prevent demon-i
strations and protests," but he
said it would "ease the frus
trations of a generation ob
viously intent on having a
voice in the determination of
their own destinies."
National Student Association
President Ed Schwartz, on the
other hand, told the subcommit
tee that the 18-year-old vote "will
open new avenues for student
pressure and student power."
He said the Senate would have
to choose what kind of response
it will make to campus activism
— a constructive response such
as lowering the voting age or a
destructive response such as the
House bill denying scholarships
to demonstrators.
WASHINGTON (CPS) — A
Senate subcommittee completed
hearings this week on a Constitu
tional amendment to lower the
voting age to 18.
Affected would be 12 million
persons between the ages of 18
and 21, 47 per cent of whom are
college students. Only Georgia
and Kentucky have lowered the
voting age to 18, while Alaska
and Hawaii, when entering the
Union, had voting ages of 19 and
20 respectively.
The bill is sponsored by 44
senators, including Majority
Leader Mike Mansfield (D-Mont)
and Minority Leader Everett
Dirkson (R-Ill.), and thus seems
likely to pass the Senate. But
the amendment faces several ob
stacles to adoption which were
brought out in the subcommit
tee testimony.
The biggest problem In get
ting the bill through the Sen
ate may be the argument that
the decision on a minimum
voting age should be left to
the individual states.
Several opponents of the bill
argued that 18-year-olds should
not be given the vote because
they do not have many other le
gal rights of citizenship, such as
making contracts and marrying,
without parental consent.
Supporters of the bill respond
ed that these same arguments
were made for denying women
the right to vote, since women
were prohibited from making
contracts and owning land in
many states when they were
given the vote.
Supporters also noted that 18-
year-olds do have many adult re
sponsibilities, including their
draft eligiblity. They argued
that if 18-year-olds were being
asked to die for American for
eign policy objectives, they ought
to have a role in shaping those
objectives.
The recent wave of student
demonstrations may also prove
to be an obstacle, especially In
the House, which recently vot
ed to deny federal aid to stu
dents who participate in un
lawful campus demonstra
tions.
At the hearings, opponents of

the bill, including Sens. Spessard
Holland (D-Fla.) and Jack Miller
(R-Iowa), said that the demon
strations show a lack of matur
ity on the part of many 18, 19,
and 20-year-olds, who "are prone
to take an extreme point of view
and push their ideas to the ex
clusion of all others," according
