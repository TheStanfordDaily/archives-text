# Antioch Faculty Abolishes Grades
## 
### 
YELLOW SPRINGS, Ohio
(CPS) â€” The faculty of Antioch
College has voted to abolish
grades, and replace them with
a "credit/no credit" system of
evaluating students' work.
At present Antioch has an A-
B-C-D-F grading scale. The new
system, which was approved by
the faculty May 7, requires fac
ulty to give fairly detailed re
ports on the progress of students
in addition to assigning them
credit or "no credit" for courses.
The new plan was the result
of a two-year study by the ed
ucational policy committee,
which was headed by Mrs. Ruth

Churchill, director of testing at
Antioch.
Under the plan, "no credit"
ratings will not be registered on
a student's transcript, nor will
they be released outside of cam
pus.
According to Mrs. Churchill,
the details of the new evaluation
system are still being worked out
by her committee. She says,
though, that faculty will be able
to give comments on students,
and also note their progress in
the following six areas: skills
and techniques; substan
tive learning, creative thinking,
independent thinking, quantity
of work and responsibility.
