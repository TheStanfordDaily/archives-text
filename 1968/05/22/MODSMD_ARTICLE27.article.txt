## 
### 
WASHINGTON (CPS) —
Leaders of three national stu
dent organization have come
out strongly against the bill
passed by the House to deny
federal scholarships to those
who participate in unlawful dem
onstrations.
And one organization, Cam
pus Americans for Democratic
Action, plans a campaign to try
to defeat the bill in the Senate.
Meanwhile, the large education
associations, such as the Ameri
can Council on Education, were
taking a careful approach to the
bill.
John F. Morse, director of the
ACE's federal relations commis
sion, said the education associa
tions and college presidents he
had talked to were "concerned"
about the bill, but wanted to
study .* before making public
statem its on it. The bill is not
expected to come before the Sen
ate for at least three weeks.
Columbia University Presi
dent Grayson Kirk has come
out against the bill. The Co
lumbia demonstration was the
largest of those that sparked
the House bill, and Kirk Ls the
only college president to make
a public statement on the bill.
The three student organization
leaders who spoke out against
the bill were Ellis Levin, national
secretary of CAD A; Ed Shwartz,
president of the National Student
Association; and Stephen Schon
berg, president of the University
Christian Movement. They said
passage of the bill will increase
campus protests next year.
Levin said his organization
plans a campaign or a petition
campaign among administrators
and faculty members and both
petitions and letters to Con

gressmen among students. He
said that once substantial sup
port has been gathered his group
plans to meet with members of
Congress.
He said he was "not unduly
confident that this effort will
have any discernible effect on
the decision makers."
Following is the full text of
the statement signed by Levin,
Schwartz, and Schonberg:
"As leaders of three of the
nation's largest student organi
zations and as present co
plaintiffs in a lawsuit against
General Hershey's directives
calling for reclassification of
draft protestors "1-A," we
wish to take strong exception
to the amendments passed In
the House of Representatives,
May 9, 1968, denying federal
loans to students engaged in
disruptive protests on cam
pus.
We are fighting the Hershey
directives on both Constitutional
and political grounds. We oppose
these amendments for the same
reasons. Apart from their am
biguous wording — which raises
serious questions as to their con
stitutionality — we believe that
they represent an entirely
wrongheaded approach to deal
ing with the problems of stu
dent activism.

"The issues which young peo
ple are raising — the war, the
cities, the quality of education—
cannot be wiped away by police
action and threats of federal
sanction. Young people merely
will intensify their resistance to
legal authority if they see that
the instruments of force are the
only instruments which the
country can use to solve its prob
lems.
"Passage of this bill will en
courage an increase in campus
protest next year. Students who
have been involved in protest
will be moved to anger by the
legislation, an anger which will
be translated into visible action.
"Even students more mod
erate than we are, who thus
far have tried to achieve
change within the educational
and political systems, will ex
perience further setbacks In
encouraging their techniques
on and off campus.
"Perhaps nothing which we
could say, or the many students
who have called us could say,
will forestall the enactment of
the House amendments into law.
"Yet we wish to make it clear
that the proposed legislation will
serve only to defeat its own
objectives and create an even
more volatile campus climate
than exists now."

May 9, 1968, denying federal

We are fighting the Hershey
directives on both Constitutional
and political grounds. We oppose
these amendments for the same

stitutionality — we believe that
they represent an entirely
wrongheaded approach to deal

"The issues which young peo

cities, the quality of education—

will intensify their resistance to
legal authority if they see that
the instruments of force are the
only instruments which the
country can use to solve its prob

"Passage of this bill will en
courage an increase in campus
protest next year. Students who
have been involved in protest
will be moved to anger by the
legislation, an anger which will
be translated into visible action.
"Even students more mod
erate than we are, who thus
far have tried to achieve
change within the educational
and political systems, will ex
perience further setbacks In
encouraging their techniques
on and off campus.
"Perhaps nothing which we
could say, or the many students
who have called us could say,
will forestall the enactment of
the House amendments into law.
"Yet we wish to make it clear

objectives and create an even

WASHINGTON (CPS) —
Leaders of three national stu
dent organization have come
out strongly against the bill
passed by the House to deny
federal scholarships to those
who participate in unlawful dem
onstrations.
And one organization, Cam
pus Americans for Democratic
Action, plans a campaign to try
to defeat the bill in the Senate.
Meanwhile, the large education
associations, such as the Ameri
can Council on Education, were
taking a careful approach to the
bill.
John F. Morse, director of the
ACE's federal relations commis
sion, said the education associa
tions and college presidents he
had talked to were "concerned"
about the bill, but wanted to
study .* before making public
statem its on it. The bill is not
expected to come before the Sen
ate for at least three weeks.
Columbia University Presi
dent Grayson Kirk has come
out against the bill. The Co
lumbia demonstration was the
largest of those that sparked
the House bill, and Kirk Ls the
only college president to make
a public statement on the bill.
The three student organization
leaders who spoke out against
the bill were Ellis Levin, national
secretary of CAD A; Ed Shwartz,
president of the National Student
Association; and Stephen Schon
berg, president of the University
Christian Movement. They said
passage of the bill will increase
campus protests next year.
Levin said his organization
plans a campaign or a petition
campaign among administrators
and faculty members and both
petitions and letters to Con

gressmen among students. He
said that once substantial sup
port has been gathered his group
plans to meet with members of
Congress.
He said he was "not unduly
confident that this effort will
have any discernible effect on
the decision makers."
Following is the full text of
the statement signed by Levin,
Schwartz, and Schonberg:
