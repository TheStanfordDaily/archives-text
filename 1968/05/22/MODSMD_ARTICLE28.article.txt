## Grid Hopes Soar

Things are looking up for Stanford's football future. At least
that was the general impression 1500 spectators got during the
final Red-White intra-squad game Saturday afternoon.
The Whites won the game 14-13, but that was the least important
aspect of the contest. Seventy-three passes were thrown by three
Stanford quarterbacks, and 38 were completed.
Jim Plunkett was the main attraction, connecting on 22 of 39
passes, good for 335 yards. Plunkett, a sophomore eligibility-wise,
is the main reason Coach John Ralston switched to the pro-type,
drop-back passing attack which Stanford will employ next fall.
Plunkett threw for two touchdowns, both 37-yard strikes. The
first was taken by flanker Jack Lasater on a fine over-the-shoulder
catch in the second quarter. The other came when Plunkett scram
bled away from three Red linemen and found Ilowie Williams all
alone in the end zone.
Another Plunkett touchdown pass (also for 37 yards) to split
end Jim Cross was nullified by a penalty. Cross was Plunkott's
favorite battery mate Saturday afternoon, hauling in nine serials
for 177 yards. The 6-0, 185-pound senior was very effective on 10-
to 15-yard square out patterns.
Sophomore tight end Ron Kadziel stole th« show for the Red
offense, with 10 receptions for 107 yards. Kadziel did the most
damage on slant in patterns of 5 to 10 yards, taking quick tosses
from Red quarterbacks Don Bunce and Ron Fujikawa. The 6-3,
205-pounder was tough to bring down once he had the ball, and
scored one of the Red TD's on a 17-yard bullet from sophomore
Bunce with 33 seconds left in the game.
The first Red six-pointer came on a one-yard plunge by fullback
Jon Huss, after an 11-yard pass from Fujikawa to Neil Nemec gave
the Reds a first down on the five.
Sophomore Jack Schultz and senior Williams were the most
effective ballcarriers. Williams picked up 61 yards in 15 carries
for the Whites, while Schultz netted 36 yards in 9 attempts to pace
Red rushers.
Once again Don Parish played an excellent defensive game, mak
ing several jarring tackles from his linebacking slot and putting
constant pressure on Plunkett.
The other two Red linebackers, Bill Shoemaker and Pat Preston,
also looked impressive. Shoemaker, recently switched to the "mon
ster," or roving linebacker position, was most effective in stopping
power plays through the center of the line. Preston, who batted
down several short passes, intercepted a stray Plunkett aerial and
returned it 50 yards.
The biggest gap in the Stanford offense now appears to be the
lack of a speedy, outside, broken-field threat. 1967 starter Nate
Kirtman, who missed spring drills because of involvement in
academic and extracurricular activities, may be the answer to
this problem. The shifty Kirtman showed flashes of brilliance
last year when he wasn't bothered by a bad back.
Coach Ralston felt that his four main objectives for spring prac
tice had been accomplished by the squad and coaching staff. The
goals were (1) to establish a solid passing game, (2) to strengthen
the team's knowledge and execution of fundamentals, (3) switch
several players to new positions, and (4) set up an aggressive
defense.
Overall, the pervading spirit in the Indian camp was one of opti
mism this spring. "We're all quite optimistic about the team's
chances," Ralston commented, terming this year's material the
finest he's had at Stanford in his six-year coaching career.
"We've got a good football team here," he said. "We have what
may be a whale of a passing game, and if we get some running
we have a chance to come up with a top team."
Ralston hinted that if all goes well, the Indians may make a post
season trip down south. They say Pasadena is lovely in January.
