# Indian Golfers Upset USC, 3 To U.S. Open Sectionals

There is one problem with
foregone conclusions: they don't
always stay that way.
USC golf coach Stan Wood,
after announcing that his Tro
jans figured to win their fifth
straight Pacific-8 golf champion
ship easily, had to stay around
to watch underdog Stanford up
set his team by eight strokes
for the title last Saturday in
Los Angeles.
The Los Angeles news
media out In force to record
the predicted Trojan victory,
packed up and left, however,
when it became apparent that
the Indians would capture
the title.
And the Tribe, according to
Coach Bud Finger, didn't play
its best golf. "Our kids were
hitting the ball well, but there
weren't any hot streaks," he
stated, also noting that the In
dian putting game wasn't at its
best, either.
Three Stanford golfers, how
ever, have golfed well enough
to qualify for the sectional
qualifying rounds for the U.S.
Open which will be played at
Silverado Country Club in Napa.
Freshman Tom Watson, not

yet eligible for varsity com
petition, fired a 141 total to
pace 132 professionals and
amateurs through 36 holes of
the U.S. Open local qualifying
round at Silverado.
Rich Harris, who finished sev
enth at the Pacific-8 tourna
ment, qualified with a 146, and
Terry Curran (who placed 12th
last week in Los Angeles) qual
ified with 150.
Watson, Harris and Curran
advance to the sectional tourna
ment, from which the top four
scores will advance to the Na
tional Open June 13-15 in
•Rochester, N.Y.
In the Pacific-8 tournament at
Los Angeles Country Club Stan
ford jumped off to a seven
stroke lead over USC in the first
round and maintained that sev

en stroke margin through the
second and third rounds.
In the final 18 holes the In
dians picked up another stroke
to topple the defending cham
pions from USC by eight, 1194
to 1202. Oregon, Oregon State,
Washington, Washington
State and California trailed in
that order.
The Trojans nabbed the first
two individual places but Greg
Pitzer came in third, Sandy
Adelman and Ray Isbell tied for
fifth, and Harris took seventh
to pace the Tribe to the team
championship.
Harris, victimized by double
vision after he scratched his
eyeball in a freak accident in
practice, fell to a 43 on the front
nine Saturday morning and then
came in with a par 35.
