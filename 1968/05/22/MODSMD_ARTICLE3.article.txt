# Right Vs. Left
## In Debate, The Twain Meet 
### JOHN ALCORN 
In a conservative-radical dia
logue yesterday, all four par
ticipants representing both sides
of the political spectrum came
out unanimously in favor of in
dividual rights and decentrali
zation of power.
However, they could not quite
agree on a common definition of
individual rights.
The discussion, sponsored by
the Young Americans for Free
dom, featured Brien Benson, ed
itor of the Arena; Harvey H.
Hukari, president of the Stan
ford Young Americans for Free
dom; David Ransom, English
instructor and editor of the
Mid - Peninsula Observer; and
Steve Weissman, former mem
ber of Students for a Demo
cratic Society and a loader of
the Berkeley Free Speech Move
ment and also the recent Old
Union sit-in here.

Benson claimed, "The thing
I get bugged about is the lib
eral's concept of welfare —
helping people by giving them
handouts.
"The best way to make people
totally productive is by giving
them jobs, and this means get
ting private enterprise in
volved"
Arguing that more business
participation would only lead to
a further centralization of pow
er on the part of big business,
Weissman contended that the
best way to assert individual
rights would be to "make only
one demand—the nationalization
of the means of production."
Weissman was joined by Ran
som, who held that "the only
logical and rational economy is
a socialist economy." Ransom
said that under socialism, "We
wouldn't have to waste such tre
mendous amounts in things like
advertising, which creates arti
ficial needs, and insurance."
Hukarl thought the main
threat to individualism Is the
centralization of power in the
federal government. Ho as
serted, "There Is definitely
enough talent In America to
cope with vital problems with
out bringing the government
In."
Believing that "history is
much more complex than people
acting out of self - interest,"
Weissman countered claims of
government infringement upon
individual freedom by stating
that "our very definition of free
dom historically has been free
dom of the market place," and
that the individual has been
"exploited" by business.
Ransom said that he could not
understand the conservatives'
"hangup about big govern
ment." He asked, "Aren't big
business and big government
really the same thing?"
Benson argued that "our eco

nomic structure is highly dy
namic and has created immense
material prosperity" while not
jeopardizing basic rights.
Discussion of the U.S.'s "dy
namic" economy led to con
sideration of American for
eign investments, labeled "im
perialism" by both Weissman
and Ransom
Benson pointed out that for
eign peoples and governments
"invite" U.S. business into their
countries because "they realize
it's the best way to raise their
own standard of living."
Replying to Benson's state
ment, Weissman said that the
people receptive to American in
vestment in foreign countries
are those "benefitting" from it
and that "all alternatives are
being stopped by military
force."
Turning to an analysis of

Vietnam. Benson held that the
reason for American Involve
ment was "the same reason
we fought Nazi Germany."
This statement drew snickers
from the audience, and Benson
responded by stating that those
in the audience did not realize
the real threat of aggression.
Hukari's main objection to
the war was the "possibility of
increased expenditures and in
creased federal centralization
after the war is over." He said
that there is no economic rea
son for U.S. participation in the
war.
"We've obviously been wrong
from the beginning" of our in
volvement, claimed Ransom.
Weissman said that he was for
the war because "it has been
very beneficial to the Viet Cong
and the Viet Minh. What I'm
against is U.S. intervention."
