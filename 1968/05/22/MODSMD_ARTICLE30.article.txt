DYNAMIC DUO is Stanford's second doubles team of John Spiegel and Rob Rippner, "two guys
who really did exceptionally well in the Pac-8 finals," according: to Coach Dick Gould. Friday Spie
gel and Rippner knocked off Washington's # 1 team of Dick Knight and Dick Finnegan, and Satur
day they upset UCLA's much-publicized Roy Barth-Steve Tidball combo. Sunday the hot streak con
