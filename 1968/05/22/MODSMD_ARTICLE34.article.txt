# Tribe Hopes Gone, Troy Clinches Title
## 
### 
What started out as a battle to reach first place has turned into
a struggle to hold onto second for Stanford's varsity baseball team.
The Indians left for a six-game road trip Friday afternoon, trail
ing league-leading USC by two and a half games. But after losing
to Oregon State Friday and splitting a doubleheader with Oregon
Saturday the Tribe nine found itself out of pennant contention
and grimly scrapping to retain second place.
Monday's doubleheader pitting Stanford (10-5) against third
place Washington Stat** (10-6) was rained out, so the Cougars
cannot overtake the Indians through a direct meeting between
the two clubs.
USC clinched the Pac-8 crown Monday In the most effortless
manner imaginable, by getting rained out. The Trojans (14-2) now
hold a three-and-a-half-game lead over Stanford with only two
games to play.
OSU pitcher Ken Forsch overpowered Stanford Friday, scattering
six hits as the Beavers gnawed away the Indians' title hopes with
a 4-1 upset.
Oregon continued the dream-shattering Saturday by rallying for
two ninth-inning runs to edge the Tribe 5-4 in the opener of a
twin bill. But Bob Gallagher's home run and Bob Edie's two-run
single sparked the Stanford club to a 3-1 win in the nightcap as
Rod Poteete hurled a four-hitter.
