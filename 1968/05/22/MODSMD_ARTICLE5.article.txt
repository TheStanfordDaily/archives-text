## #Leftists Launch Attack On De Gaulle 
### 
PARIS (AP) — Left-wing dep
uties launched a determined at
tack Tuesday on President
Charles de Gaulle's 10-year-long
regime, seeking to capitalize
politically on scholastic ferment
and ever-spreading strikes that
are costing France millions of
dollars a day in lost production.
The French people "have had
enough of this regime of person
al power," Weldeck Rochet,
secretary-general of the French
Communist party, told the Na
tional Assembly in debate on a
motion of censure expected to
reach a vote Wednesday night.
The president's position is not
directly threatened, for his term
runs until 1972, but passage of
the motion would oust Premier
Georges Pompidou and his Cab
inet, the executors of De
Gaulee's policies.
The Gaullist coalition has a
narrow majority in the National
Assembly, and its leaders ex
pressed confidence that it would
survive the vote. Communists
and the Federation of the Demo
cratic and So c i a 1 is t Left
charged in the censure motion
that the government had re
fused to deal effectively with de
mands of students, teachers,
farmers and workers.
• VC Hit Rasps
SAIGON (AP) - Striking with
precision, North Vietnamese

gunners hit four major U.S.
headquarters near Hue 'lues
day. Thousands of U.S. soldiers
moving in to meet the threat
posed in the far north by three

"The intensity of the war
seems to be increasing," Gen.

ing commander of U.S. forces in
Vietnam, said before taking off
for a farewell visit to American
servicemen in Thailand.

peril appeared to be in the

• Harriman Hopeful
PARIS (AP) — U.S. Ambas
sador W. Averell Harriman ex
pressed hope Tuesday that
something will come from a
British-Soviet meeting in Mos
cow on Vietnam. Other Ameri
cans professed to see a faint
prospect of progress in prelimi
nary talks here, and perhaps
their enlargement.
Harriman expressed his views
after paying what he said was a
courtesy call on President
Charles de Gaulle. Later North
Vietnam's chief negotiator,
Xuan Thuy, met with De Gaull".
Both envoys reported cordial in
terviews with the president and

Thuy said De Gaulle expressed
hope the Paris peace talks
would succeed.
• FDA Head Quits
WASHINGTON (AP) — Dr.
James Bell Goddard, colorful
and controversial chief of the
Food and Drug Administration,
is resigning effective July 31 to
join a data processing company
in Atlanta, the administration
announced Tuesday.
Goddard has been the fre
quent companion of controver
sy.
He touched off a furor last Oc
tober when he said at a news
conference at the University of
Minnesota "that whether mari
juana is a more dangerous drug
than alcohol is debatable I
don't happen to think it is."
Goddard's position has been
that penalties for use of mari
juana are inconsistent. He noted
it is a crime to possess it, but
there is no penalty for posses
sion of the potent mind-expand
ing drug LSD. And he said LSD
is far more dangerous.

• Budget Vote Off
SACRAMENTO (AP) — The
Senate decided Tuesday that it
still isn't ready to vote on Gov.
Reagan's $5.7 billion budget,
despite five months of line-bv
line scrutiny of the proposed
spending program.
A scheduled vote on the meas
ure was put off for at least a

day on the motion of Republi
can Senate Leader Donald L.
Grunsky of Watsonville. Grun
sky, a member of the Senate
Finance Committee which has
been examining the budget, said
he still had questions about it.
That drew a rebuke from
Democratic Senate President

Fresno, who said "I am sur
prised that a member of the...
finance committee would ask
for a continuance of this kind.
He's had an opportunity the rest
of us haven't, to find out what
goes into the budget."
However, Burns and Grunsky
agreed that the matter be put
off until Wednesday.
