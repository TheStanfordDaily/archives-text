Compiled from thr Associated Press
Demonstrations hit colleges at
both ends of the country yester
day, the second time in less than
a month at Columbia University
in New York, and the second
time within six months at San
Francisco State College.
Police ousted the SI State de
monstrators at 10:30 last night, and
moved in on the Columbia sit-in at
2:45 a.m„ but had not eleared the
building as the Daily went to press.
About 150 to 200 Columbia
University students occupied
Hamilton Hall on the school's
Morningside Heights campus
Tuesday night, challenging the
authority of the university ad
ministration.
Lines of the confrontation
hardened when Acting 1 Dean
Henry Coleman entered the
building shortly before 7:30
p.m. and ordered the demon
strators to leave. He said If
they did not, the university
had "no alternative" except to
summon city police.
A spokesman at police head
quarters said that police officers
were ordered at 8:20 p.m. to as

semble at a point near the uni
versity and to stand by for fur
ther instructions.
The confrontation grew out of
the student rebellion that began
29 days ago and resulted in the
occupation of Hamilton Hall
and four other university build
ings by the rebel students.
After a week, on April 30,
1,000 eity police Intervened,
arresting; 700 sit-ins. One hun
dred persons were Injured.
More than 200 students began
a sit -in Tuesday at the San
Francisco State College admin
istration building over demands
to kick out the Air Force ROTC
and admit more minority group
students.
This second sit-in since last
December was peaceful at the
outset.
President John Summersklll,
before the sit-in began, issued
a written notice that peaceful
demonstration would be allowed
but any disruption of the col
lege would bring arrests.
Sponsors of the demonstra
tion were the Students for a
Demoeratlc Society and the
Third World Liberation Front.
"Third World" refers to Latin
American and Oriental coun
tries.
The demands included admis
sion of 400 "Third World stu
"ents," hiring of at least nine
"Third World professors," and
th' 1 rehiring of histoiy professor
Juan Martinez whose employ
ment on a part-time basis was
terminated.
The Columbia demonstration
was in protest over the sum
moning of four student leaders
to a dean's office for an inquiry
into their role in an earlier dem
onstration in March.
The students, along with
about 20 parents of students,
moved into Hamilton about 4:50
p.m. They milled about in a
hallway near the first floor of
fice of the dean, Alexander
Piatt.
The ultimatum from Coleman
came about an hour after Piatt
ended a meeting with the par
ents and three lawyers, who
then left the building.

Demonstrations hit colleges at
both ends of the country yester
day, the second time in less than
a month at Columbia University
in New York, and the second
time within six months at San

moved in on the Columbia sit-in at
2:45 a.m„ but had not eleared the
building as the Daily went to press.
About 150 to 200 Columbia
University students occupied
Hamilton Hall on the school's
Morningside Heights campus
Tuesday night, challenging the
authority of the university ad
ministration.
Lines of the confrontation
hardened when Acting 1 Dean
Henry Coleman entered the
building shortly before 7:30
p.m. and ordered the demon
strators to leave. He said If
they did not, the university
had "no alternative" except to
summon city police.
A spokesman at police head
quarters said that police officers
were ordered at 8:20 p.m. to as

semble at a point near the uni
versity and to stand by for fur
ther instructions.
The confrontation grew out of
the student rebellion that began
29 days ago and resulted in the
occupation of Hamilton Hall
and four other university build
ings by the rebel students.
