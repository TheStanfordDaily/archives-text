# Campaign Organizer Relates Students' Help Is Invaluable
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
The 1968 presidential race has
seen the evolution of a new po
litical force —students.
The campaign apparatus of
all major candidates has come
to rely heavily on student man
power, more so than ever be
fore. A prime example is the
Kennedy campaign.
In canvassing especially,
students have taken "a much
more substantive role In cam
paigning," according to Koss
Pritchard, national student
coordinator for Kennedy.
"Beginning in Indiana and
Nebraska, and now in Oregon,
South Dakota, and California,
we've come to rely very heavily

on the input that college stu
dents can make," Pritchard said.
"The important thing we have
found is that students have
given much beyond what you
can normally expect students to
contribute," he continued, not
ing two major contributions stu
dents have made.
"First, if you're trying to
reach the undecided voter in
substantive issue terms, the col
lege student, who has a tremen
dous background in public is
sues like the urban crisis, the
racial crisis, Vietnam, a whole
range of problems, is able to
talk to voters in a very respon
sive way," he said.
"Secondly, having' done this,
Pritchard continued, "the stu
dent Is able to come hack to
some central point, such as a
campaign headquarters, and
tell the staff the issues which
seem to be In the forefront of
the voters' thinking."
Pritchard gave Indiana as an
example of this, where the staff
thought Vietnam was going to
be the major issue.
But when the student vol
unteers were debriefed after the
first week of canvassing, "we
found out from them that the
most essential issue in Indiana
was not Vietnam at all, but var
ious aspects of the urban con
frontation and crisis," Pritchard
said.
"Because of his very par
ticular background, the stu
dent Is the only person who
without a great deal of train
ing on issues can have this
kind of dialogue with the
voter on issues," Pritchard
said.
"It's not only the fact he's
available in very large numbers
as a rule, but that along with
the numbers, he's qualitatively
so relevant to the campaign.
"I think this is a whole new
dimension that has emerged
from student participation in
the spring primaries. I think it's
here to stay," he added.
"You're putting before the
voters an informed, articulate
person who is concerned about
people. We've never had this be
fore in large numbers. I've been
in campaigns since 1948 and I've
never seen such potential."
In California, I*ritchard ex
perts a slowdown in student
help during the next two

weeks, because of impending
exams.
"It will hurt both of us (Ken
nedy and McCarthy) consider
ably," he said. "With this in
mind, a lot of our student focus
is on a relatively short - term
basis of asking large numbers
of students to help us on elec
tion day in get-out-the-vote ac
tivities."
There are Kennedy organiza
tions at 40 or 50 northern Cali
fornia colleges, including junior
colleges, and at 25 or 30 insti
tutions in the southern part of
the state.
Pritchard noted that there
were strong groups at UCLA,
Sacramento State, Humboldt
State, Chico State, UC Davis,
and San Diego State, as well as
a group of about 600 at Berke
ley.
He also said the organization
at Stanford was "small but very
effective —as hard a working
group as we have."
Student workers for the
California primary are com
ing almost entirely from with
in the state, which was not
true of earlier campaigns.
In Indiana, students were
bussed in from Wisconsin, Mich
igan, Illinois and Ohio to help
with the work. In the Nebraska
campaign, Kansas, Missouri and
Colorado students were brought
in. The Oregon primary is a
joint Washington-Oregon effort,
Pritchard said.
