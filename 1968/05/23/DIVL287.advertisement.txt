New Hampshire was the beginning, not the end. With the achievement of its first objectives,
McCarthy's campaign became the vehicle for new hope, new issues, new ideas:
"After each of our world wars, the generation in power has tended to
remain in power for one generation to long. Except after the last world
war it has remained in power for two generations too long, thanks to
the discovery of penicillin ..."
"The office of the presidency of the United States must never
he a personal office..."
"1 hope that as we go along we will try to make this campaign a kind
of referendum in which we ask the people of this country to pass judg
ment upon the militarization of our foreign policy and also increasing
ly, the influence of the military on our domestic life."
"So long as the draft continues . . . legal options must be pro
vided for those who are morally opposed to a particular war . . .
The draft must not he used as an instrument of punishment"
"We must move to establish a whole new set of civil rights . . . the right
to a decent job becoming the dignity of a man . . . the right to adequate
health care, without regard to race . . . the right to the amount and kind
of education necessary to develop full potential. . . the right to a house
in a tieighborhood which is part of a community, which is part of the
United States of America."
"I think there are three agencies in government which need to
be altered somewhat. . . One is the Central Intelligence Agen
cy and the second is the FBI and the third is the Draft Board
under General Hershey. Since this is a partisan government of
men as well as laws 1 have in mind to make some changes."
"We have living among us a kind of colonized nation — more than 20
million persons who have been allowed no participation in our cul
ture, no economic participation, no political participation. We have ex
ploited these people, used them, denied them opportunity . . . We must
spend as much money as it takes over the next five, ten, fifteen, or twenty
years—as long as it takes, to meet these needs."
"The destruction and chaos of riot-torn cities are a shock to
those who looked away from the scandal of poverty in the land
of affluence, from frustration in a land of promise and hope . . .
Our responsibility is not just to humanity in the abstract or to
the nice and beautiful persons but to everyone in our society"
McCarthy Needs Your Support! There Is Unfinished Work To Do!
Volunteers are needed to bring to every Democrat a personal representative of Senator Mc-
Carthy to explain his campaign, clarify the issues, and inform the public about his position.

vassers will get Peter, Paul and Mary tickets at half price and lunch at Frost at 1:30 p.m.

"We have living among us a kind of colonized nation — more than 20
million persons who have been allowed no participation in our cul
ture, no economic participation, no political participation. We have ex
ploited these people, used them, denied them opportunity . . . We must
spend as much money as it takes over the next five, ten, fifteen, or twenty
years—as long as it takes, to meet these needs."
"The destruction and chaos of riot-torn cities are a shock to
those who looked away from the scandal of poverty in the land
of affluence, from frustration in a land of promise and hope . . .
Our responsibility is not just to humanity in the abstract or to
the nice and beautiful persons but to everyone in our society"

New Hampshire was the beginning, not the end. With the achievement of its first objectives,
McCarthy's campaign became the vehicle for new hope, new issues, new ideas:
"After each of our world wars, the generation in power has tended to
remain in power for one generation to long. Except after the last world
war it has remained in power for two generations too long, thanks to
the discovery of penicillin ..."
