## Why Perpetuate An ASSU? 
### JEFF KANE 
This past year I have seen
an increasing number of stu
dents who feel that the ASSU
should be abolished. They have
viewed the Association as little
more than the illusion of power,
as evidenced by the lack of stu
dent participation in the de
cision-making process of the
University.
I would like to view this mat
ter from another perspective,
viz., student finances, especially
since LASSU is now considering
next year's budget.
First—and I will just mention
this—the ASSU has no control
over the appointment of the
Student Financial Manager, nor
the ASSU secretaries, nor do
we set their wages. These mat
ters are under the control of the
Dean of Students. Furthermore,
we do not have direct control
over the level of student fees
which make up the bulk of
ASSU income.
However, my main concern
here is with the budget per se;
I seek to exploit the myth that
the ASSU is financially autono
mous from the Office of the
Dean of Students. According to
the 1968-1969 Tentative Master
Budget, the ASSU will have
$136,700 to work with.
One would think this sum
would give us a great deal of
freedom in planning our forth
coming activities. On the con
trary, our traditional commit
ments make this budget Inflex
ible. In the final analyss, we
have very little real choice on
the question of ASSU financial
appropriations. I would like to
suggest that this Is largely be
cause the ASSU is financing
activities more properly the re
sponsibility of the University.
Here Is a very rough breakdown
on that $136,700.00.
First, the administrative tasks
of running the ASSU—e.g., AS
SU Office, Executive, Legisla
ture, Elections, etc. —cost us
over $50,000 annually.
Second, appropriations to AS
SU publications (mostly the
Daily). Cost: $31,000.
Now, the following are very
worthwhile. But why should stu
dents have to finance them?
1. Pre-Registration — last
year's program was very good,
maybe even great, and I think
Pre-Reg should be run by stu
dents, but financed directly by
the University. Aside from the
incident involving Peter Ly
man's letter, we have been pay
ing for the University Presi

dent's Tea (whoever he may
be), Baggage & Transportation,
etc. Including the International
Center's participation, cost is
over $5,000.
2. Overseas Exchange Scholar
ship Commission—pays the liv
ing expenses of three foreign
students. A good program, very
relevant to the ASSU, based on
principle of students selecting
students, but why must ASSU
foot the bill? This program
should be expanded to include
participants from at least 30
foreign universities—not merely
a select few. (Note: Stanford re
quires us to take certain gen
eral studies courses because
"nations seek better to under
stand one another.) Cost: $4,653.
3. Speech Association — a
good, solid educational program
for those involved., Moreover
Kenneth Mosier is a great guy
who has dedicated his whole
life to students. He deserves our
thanks, but he also deserves
full financial support from the
University.
Because the program should
be incorporated into the educa
tional framework of the Uni
versity, and because partici
pants represent Stanford at oth
er university campuses during
inter-collegiate competition, the
University should bear full fi
nancial responsibility. Cost to
ASSU: over $7,000.
4. High School Day — a
questionable program, but why
must students pay $400.00 to
wards Stanford's recruiting?
Well, we've spent close to a
hundred grand to far. (Add it
up.) Fortunately, we have a
little left, so we can still sup
port Political Union (at last, an
activity attended by many stu
dents—also other members of
the Community and outsiders as
well), Stanford Area Tutorial,
International Center, and Stu
dent-Faculty Board (whatever
that is). And we may even get
to appropriate $10,000 for the
ASSU Professor — we should
give $25,000, and maybe even
some concert subsidies. But
then again, we may not.
In closing, I repeat my earlier
statement that most activities
sponsored by the ASSU are
worthwhile. In fact, these activi
ties are an integral part of
Stanford. They contribute sub
stantially to the cultural, social,
and in a larger sense, education
al atmosphere which is funda
mental to any university, espe
cially those on the edge of great
ness.
For this reason, many of them
should be incorporated into the
regular Annual University Bud
get; they should be financed
directly by the University, and
on a long-term basis. The point
is: somehow, these activities—
more properly the financial re
sponsibility of the University—
have been supported largely by
so-called "student fees." This
cannot continue. The ASSU

must involve itself less with
small interest groups and more
with activities that bridge the
great gap between dormitories
and classrooms, activities bene
ficial to large numbers of stu
dents.
Finally, one might speculate
on what might happen were
LASSU to refuse to support
these activities. This is a game
of Speculation, the "What If"
game. What if students appro
priated all $136,000 to Cancer
Research, or SDS, or construc
tion of a student Coffeehouse —
or what if LASSU simply re
fused to appropriate any of the
money?
Would this mean that next
year we would have no Dally,
no guest speakers, no Bon Fire,
no Pre-Reg, no I-Center? Or
perhaps then the Dean of Stu
dents would see fit to take di
rect control over student fi
nances (remember Berkeley)—
and we would find things going
on in much the same way that
they do now.
Why, then, an ASSU?
