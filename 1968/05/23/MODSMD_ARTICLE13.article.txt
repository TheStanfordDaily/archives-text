# ASSU President Writes
## Campus Aura 'Frighting' 
### 
(The following: letter, written
by ASSU President Cesare Mas
sarentl, was sent to Mark Man
call, Halsted Holman, B. Davie
Napier, William Clebsch, Mich
ael Novak, and Bruce Franklin.)
Dear Professor Mancall:
It is very difficult for me to say
what I feel in this moment and
especially to a person like you.
I am very deeply disturbed,
more I would say frightened,
when I look at how things and
positions have developed since

the last meeting of the Aca
demic Council.
I understand that several pro
fessors did not like some of the
comments made by students In
the old Union after the Aca
demic Council meeting and dis
approved of the students not
leaving the building immediate
ly. It is my belief that those
things had to be said and that
the discussion had to take place,
as many students felt that the
solution of the aims was near,
but nevertheless not assured.
The realization of what the
faculty had done was clear in
everybody's mind and the al
ready existing sense of togeth
erness only increased, I realize
also how much pressure the
professors had to bear and how
the pressure somewhat decreas
ed after the vote in the Academ
ic Council; the pressure on the
students instead was not affected
very much because we began
to fear a chain of reactions and
divisions which would be likely
to occur because of that vote and
because of the petitions circulat
ed on campus.
Also, the attitude of some
administrators during the re
maining part of that week was
not encouraging, and Herbert
Packer's speech at the AAUP
added fuel to the acquiesced
fire. I would like to stress once
more that the events that took
place and the way they devel
oped until Wednesday were not
very dramatic in themselves.
What made them become dra
matic and extremely difficult
to control was in my opinion,
the incapacity of people to dis
cuss, at all levels of analysis.
This was clarified to me once
more by the General Assembly
of Monday night, where students
were simply polarized with
willingness to consider the is

sues; it was also confirmed by
the type of discussion that occur
red at the Academic Council
meeting where issues became
very soon a personal matter. In
a University, and Stanford
claims to be such, dedicated to
scientific endeavor and investiga
tion the discussion on issues is
supposed to be one, and perhaps
the most important one, of the
fundamental characteristics in
the lives of those whom make a
University, the discussion is also
supposed to be one of the most
relevant parts of the education,
in both teaching and learning.
But, clearly, Stanford has not
and does not fulfill these points.
Atomistic individualism and dis
persion, personal enmities, and
polarizations seem to be all Stan
ford has been capable of offering
and enforcing. Few, very few
people can learn in three days
how to talk with each other
maintaining reciprocal respect.
The breakdown of communica
tions that supposedly occurred
during and after the sit-in never
really occurred, I believe, be
cause there were very few chan
nels of communications to begin
with. What occurred instead, in
my opinion, was only a chain of
personal attacks, of recrimina
tion, of accusations, of consider
ations on who won and who lost.
And the issues were almost bur
ied again. All this I consider to
be perhaps the major failure
of Stanford as an educational in
stitution.
The sit-In, instead, even in
its remarkable containment
and lack of animosity, served
as a very valuable instrument
in the process of unlearning
and releaming: We began to
educate ourselves, student and
professors, together. Can this
continue? I hope that it is pos
sible for all of us to construct

a serious unity which does not
exclude even deep disagree
ments to make this University
a place where one can learn
especially how one has the
right to determine his life.
If the walls that now exist
between groups of students and
certain groups of students and
certain faculty members con
tinue to exist, I see very little
hope to begin the discussion that
has been talked about for years
but that I have never seen hap
pen. I mean the discussions
about and among ourselves.
I can understand your feel
ings as well as those of Napier
and Holman and other faculty
members who were very close
to us in the last two weeks but
the silence that fell upon us
should not continue. Also, peo
ple are learning that there is
a limit to patience and to frus
tration and the problem of time
should be concerned too.
I am sending you this note
which I have tried to make as se
rene as I could given that my
wife and child left this country
two days ago frightened by the
threats on our lives that we re
ceived by telephone and by mail
during the past week.
In no place, in no country that
I have visited, have I ever experi
enced the violence that was
brought under my eyes and I
am more frightened because
Italy and similar small countries
are totally powerless while this
country is one of the three rulers
of the world. What I am asking
is if this feudal king is going to
remain such. To change our
selves we have to change the
world and viceversa. I hope to
see you soon over a glass of
wine.

should not continue. Also, peo
ple are learning that there is
a limit to patience and to frus
tration and the problem of time
should be concerned too.
I am sending you this note
which I have tried to make as se
rene as I could given that my
wife and child left this country
two days ago frightened by the
threats on our lives that we re
ceived by telephone and by mail
during the past week.
In no place, in no country that
I have visited, have I ever experi
enced the violence that was
brought under my eyes and I
am more frightened because
Italy and similar small countries
are totally powerless while this
country is one of the three rulers
of the world. What I am asking
is if this feudal king is going to
remain such. To change our
selves we have to change the
world and viceversa. I hope to
see you soon over a glass of
wine.

Dear Professor Mancall:
It is very difficult for me to say
what I feel in this moment and
especially to a person like you.
I am very deeply disturbed,
more I would say frightened,
when I look at how things and
positions have developed since

the last meeting of the Aca
demic Council.
I understand that several pro
fessors did not like some of the
comments made by students In
the old Union after the Aca
demic Council meeting and dis
approved of the students not
leaving the building immediate
ly. It is my belief that those
things had to be said and that
the discussion had to take place,
as many students felt that the
solution of the aims was near,
but nevertheless not assured.
The realization of what the
faculty had done was clear in
everybody's mind and the al
ready existing sense of togeth
erness only increased, I realize
also how much pressure the
professors had to bear and how
the pressure somewhat decreas
ed after the vote in the Academ
ic Council; the pressure on the
students instead was not affected
very much because we began
to fear a chain of reactions and
divisions which would be likely
to occur because of that vote and
because of the petitions circulat
ed on campus.
Also, the attitude of some
administrators during the re
maining part of that week was
not encouraging, and Herbert
Packer's speech at the AAUP
added fuel to the acquiesced
fire. I would like to stress once
more that the events that took
place and the way they devel
oped until Wednesday were not
very dramatic in themselves.
What made them become dra
matic and extremely difficult
to control was in my opinion,
the incapacity of people to dis
cuss, at all levels of analysis.
This was clarified to me once
more by the General Assembly
of Monday night, where students
were simply polarized with
willingness to consider the is

sues; it was also confirmed by
the type of discussion that occur
red at the Academic Council
meeting where issues became
very soon a personal matter. In
a University, and Stanford
claims to be such, dedicated to
scientific endeavor and investiga
tion the discussion on issues is
supposed to be one, and perhaps
the most important one, of the
fundamental characteristics in
the lives of those whom make a
University, the discussion is also
supposed to be one of the most
relevant parts of the education,
in both teaching and learning.
But, clearly, Stanford has not
and does not fulfill these points.
Atomistic individualism and dis
persion, personal enmities, and
polarizations seem to be all Stan
ford has been capable of offering
and enforcing. Few, very few
people can learn in three days
how to talk with each other
maintaining reciprocal respect.
The breakdown of communica
tions that supposedly occurred
during and after the sit-in never
really occurred, I believe, be
cause there were very few chan
nels of communications to begin
with. What occurred instead, in
my opinion, was only a chain of
personal attacks, of recrimina
tion, of accusations, of consider
ations on who won and who lost.
And the issues were almost bur
ied again. All this I consider to
be perhaps the major failure
of Stanford as an educational in
stitution.
The sit-In, instead, even in
its remarkable containment
and lack of animosity, served
as a very valuable instrument
in the process of unlearning
and releaming: We began to
educate ourselves, student and
professors, together. Can this
continue? I hope that it is pos
sible for all of us to construct

a serious unity which does not
exclude even deep disagree
ments to make this University
a place where one can learn
especially how one has the
right to determine his life.
If the walls that now exist
between groups of students and
certain groups of students and
certain faculty members con
tinue to exist, I see very little
hope to begin the discussion that
has been talked about for years
but that I have never seen hap
pen. I mean the discussions
about and among ourselves.
I can understand your feel
ings as well as those of Napier
and Holman and other faculty
members who were very close
to us in the last two weeks but
the silence that fell upon us
should not continue. Also, peo
ple are learning that there is

The sit-In, instead, even in
its remarkable containment
and lack of animosity, served
as a very valuable instrument
in the process of unlearning
and releaming: We began to
educate ourselves, student and
professors, together. Can this
continue? I hope that it is pos
sible for all of us to construct

a serious unity which does not
exclude even deep disagree
ments to make this University
a place where one can learn
especially how one has the
right to determine his life.
If the walls that now exist
between groups of students and
certain groups of students and
certain faculty members con
tinue to exist, I see very little
hope to begin the discussion that
has been talked about for years
but that I have never seen hap
pen. I mean the discussions
about and among ourselves.
I can understand your feel
ings as well as those of Napier
and Holman and other faculty
members who were very close
to us in the last two weeks but
the silence that fell upon us
should not continue. Also, peo
ple are learning that there is
a limit to patience and to frus
tration and the problem of time
should be concerned too.
I am sending you this note
which I have tried to make as se
rene as I could given that my
wife and child left this country
two days ago frightened by the
threats on our lives that we re
ceived by telephone and by mail
during the past week.
In no place, in no country that
I have visited, have I ever experi
enced the violence that was
brought under my eyes and I
am more frightened because
Italy and similar small countries
are totally powerless while this
country is one of the three rulers
of the world. What I am asking
is if this feudal king is going to
remain such. To change our
selves we have to change the
world and viceversa. I hope to
see you soon over a glass of
wine.
Sincerely,

Dear Professor Mancall:
It is very difficult for me to say
what I feel in this moment and
especially to a person like you.
I am very deeply disturbed,
more I would say frightened,
when I look at how things and
positions have developed since

the last meeting of the Aca
demic Council.
I understand that several pro
fessors did not like some of the
comments made by students In
the old Union after the Aca
demic Council meeting and dis
approved of the students not
leaving the building immediate
ly. It is my belief that those
things had to be said and that
the discussion had to take place,
as many students felt that the
solution of the aims was near,
but nevertheless not assured.
The realization of what the
faculty had done was clear in
everybody's mind and the al
ready existing sense of togeth
erness only increased, I realize
also how much pressure the
professors had to bear and how
the pressure somewhat decreas
ed after the vote in the Academ
ic Council; the pressure on the
students instead was not affected
very much because we began
to fear a chain of reactions and
divisions which would be likely
to occur because of that vote and
because of the petitions circulat
ed on campus.
Also, the attitude of some
administrators during the re
maining part of that week was
not encouraging, and Herbert
Packer's speech at the AAUP
added fuel to the acquiesced
fire. I would like to stress once
more that the events that took
place and the way they devel
oped until Wednesday were not
very dramatic in themselves.
What made them become dra
matic and extremely difficult
to control was in my opinion,
the incapacity of people to dis
cuss, at all levels of analysis.
This was clarified to me once
more by the General Assembly
of Monday night, where students
were simply polarized with
willingness to consider the is

sues; it was also confirmed by
the type of discussion that occur
red at the Academic Council
meeting where issues became
very soon a personal matter. In
a University, and Stanford
claims to be such, dedicated to
scientific endeavor and investiga
tion the discussion on issues is
supposed to be one, and perhaps
the most important one, of the
fundamental characteristics in
the lives of those whom make a
University, the discussion is also
supposed to be one of the most
relevant parts of the education,
in both teaching and learning.
But, clearly, Stanford has not
and does not fulfill these points.
Atomistic individualism and dis
persion, personal enmities, and
polarizations seem to be all Stan
ford has been capable of offering
and enforcing. Few, very few
people can learn in three days
how to talk with each other
maintaining reciprocal respect.
The breakdown of communica
tions that supposedly occurred
during and after the sit-in never
really occurred, I believe, be
cause there were very few chan
nels of communications to begin
with. What occurred instead, in
my opinion, was only a chain of
personal attacks, of recrimina
tion, of accusations, of consider
ations on who won and who lost.
And the issues were almost bur
ied again. All this I consider to
be perhaps the major failure
of Stanford as an educational in
stitution.
The sit-In, instead, even in
its remarkable containment
and lack of animosity, served
as a very valuable instrument
in the process of unlearning
and releaming: We began to
