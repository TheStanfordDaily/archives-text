# The 						Black Maze
## Dr. Shockley As Scientist 
### Theodore F. Spearman, Jr 
The human bible and Dr.
Shockley have merged to linger
beneath the submerged cata
combs of intellectual endeavor,
the result being a glow to con
catenate chthonian somethings,
not necessarily a profound some
thing but at least a somewhat
subtle something.
To accuse Prof. Shockley of
being less than a Bircher, more
than a racist, equal to a bigot,
or simply a pet of Ronald Rea
gan may have foundations in eth
ical conjuring, but suffices in
doing little to complete the por
trait of the man and his work.
In order to see Dr. Shockley
clearly we need only examine
him in relation to one adjective,
leaving all other descriptive
words to the discretion of those
who like judging such human
adultery.
Prof. Shockley as Scientist:
It is not necessary for me to
call him a brave scientist, a good
scientist, a mad scientist; he is
simply a scientist.
Dr. Shockley, scientist, is ques
tioning my evolutionary process,
and I, non-scientist, shall now
question Dr. Shockley's evolu
tionary process.
Scientists take great delight
in the concept of maintaining
a strictly objective frame of
mind; this is suppose to mean
that they have a working mental
capacity free from human vanity
which is more commonly call
ed human prejudice. This in turn,
is to allow the scientist to find

pure truth through his undis
turbed reason.
Dr. Shockley, scientist, seeker
of pure truth through reason:
The pure truth in this case
small mean that I justly belong
in some sandlot playing with
round concrete tubes and slides,
the black man's true apocalypse.
Admittedly many of us like to
scream and shout and thump
our thumbs and write about funk
in life and mind. But I personally
don't like slides, trying hard to
cover up the fact that my tail
does show when I get angry.
Dr. Shockley, scientist, as the
Nobel plumber:
Prof. Shockley, scientist, seek
er of pure truth through reason,
discovered the transistor and re
ceived the nobelity award.
Henery Murpee came over and
fixed my faucet. Henery works
with matter and so does Dr.
Shockley. Henery is just "Hen
ery, a plumber"; Dr. Shockley is
"Shockley, a Dr. plumber." Hen
ery's mind and washer keep my
faucet going as Dr. Shockley's
mind and transistor keep my ra
dio going. The 'hyperbola-Man'
is basically the same in any do
minion.
The Nobel PI umber as Tyrant:
Ever since Western man said,
"Know thyself young man, know
theyself," boys have been run
ning around in frenzied, fuli
ginous paroxysms while trying
to conquer reason/life/matter.
The only evidence of success has
been in the relationship of rea

son to matter. Nothing given
exists unless it has relation to
matter in the explicit dimen
sions of matter. Thus, the scien
tist who can determine matter
is necessarily a tyrant of exis
tence.
Dr. Shockley as the Dead God:
Unless Dr. Shockloy, scientist,
lives a total existence of reason,
ho a phony. Unless Dr. Shock
ley, scientist, is a mosaic of Mr.
Spock of Star Trek, he is a
phony. If Dr. Shockley is a
reasoning creature at all times,
there can be no laughter without
reason, no love without reason,
no hurt without reason; but
a x*easoned love is a phony love,
a reasoned laugh is a phony
laugh, a reasoned hurt is a phony
hurt.
As a result, Dr. Shockley,
whether he knows it or not, is
in a mortal bind. When a srien
tist works with the existence of
other humans who have been
properly sequenced in the men
tal lab through reason and then
fails to use reason in his life
outside of his lab, he is a phony.
And if he uses reason in his life
outside of his lab, he is like unto
a dead man who walks, one who
conceaLs his bite with a kiss.
For a man of pure reason must
deny any existence of passion,
since passion, as anyone can tell
you, is not conducive to ob
jectivity. A man is only half a
man without the disease of pas
sion; yet, there is no such thing
as a half man. There are only
live men and dead men.
So it would seem that I have
either a phony or a dead man
examining my soul. People with
passion have souls. People with

reason have death and matter (I
can always steal matter and you
can try to steal life).
Dr. Shoekley is in one sense
correct. My people's minds ar
extremely different from hi"
kind of mind. Our minds ragr>
with hut and pain and love an.l
beauty. We don't examine the
sensations of life with fal*e sin
cerity. We live them with rage.
We live the essence of life evon
if most of us don't know it yet.
We are alive Mr. Shoekley, we
are alive; and that should seem
Strang to YOU. And YOU come
before us to offer us your kind
of live which is dead. You hav
a bone in your mouth claiming
it to have power of life. You
are trying to build a transistor
to communicate with your spirit
world. Or maybe you are trying
to build a synthetic soul.
Study us well, Dr. Shoekley,
for the beauty may blind you
and then cure you.
Sittings on sittings in oblivion,
Till change hath broken down
All things save Beauty alone.
