# A 						Fundamental Gap
## Administrators Miss Student View 
### 
(Editor's Note: This is the
second part of Bruce Campbell's
article about administration,
with a conclusion written in re
sponse to recent events.)
An even greater tragedy than
the administrative one described
in the first part of this article
and a tragedy with much wider
implications is the personal tra
gedy of the human price that
men pay in order to be admini
strators. The same forces that
operate to cause administrative
problems are the forces of dehu
manization that quietly and lar
gely without notice eat away at
a man's humanness.
The time demands on an ad
ministrator, for example are not
only the cause of his difficulty
in seeing a larger perspective,
they also facilitate dealing with
people in an "administrative"
manner.
Not Seen As Humans
People are no longer seen as
human beings but rather as
possessors of information need
ed to solve a problem or as the
instruments through which an
issue will be resolved.
The way in which a person
relates to others determines the
way in which he conceives him
self. Manipulation of others, even
to do the very necessary tasks
of the university, leads to instru
mentalization of the self. This
is a strong, though not inevit
able, force of administration.
The combination of time de

mands and role filling that faci
litates an administrator's iden
tifying with his administrative
function and thus makes it diffi
cult for him to get outside to
see himself in perspective is also
the cause of personal tragedy:
a man spends so much of his
time, even his non-office time,
as Dean, that he can very easily
come to think of himself only
in terms of his function and can
not look at himself as a person.
Conflict Developing
The pervasiveness of this out
look was demonstrated to me in
conversations I had with mem
bers of the administration about
the problems discussed in this
article.
All of them agreed about the
administrative tragedy, but no
one perceived or agreed that
there was any personal price
paid in administrating.
The implications of this are
great. A conflict which may be
one of the central issues in
America in the next few decades
is developing in embryonic form
here at Stanford. It is the diver
gence between a generation
which, on the whole, thinks in
functional terms and is very
leary of asking personal ques
tions and a generation which
focuses primarily on asking
questions about qualities of be
ing human, sometimes to the
extent of refusing to confront
pragmatic considerations.

After reading over this article
in the light of recent events, I
have asked the editors to let
me re-write the conclusion. The
relation of the new ending to
body of the article may not be
readily apparent, but I will try
to make the connection at the
end.
Stress situations, like the sit
in of last week, frequently burst
illusions we had taken to be
assumptions. One that was burst
for me last week was bromide
that an atmosphere of reason,
where issues would be decided
on the merits of the case and
not by the exigencies of power,
was an ideal we should work
toward. To hold that up as an
ideal, I now see, is to be blind
to the workings of human con
flict resolution.
In any conflict situation, es
pecially those that will charact
erize Stanford in the next few
years, there are two forces: one
defending the status quo and the
other attempting to change it.
The second group is a threat
to the first and any time a per
son feels threatened, he does
not act rationally. At least, not
fully rationally. The rational
component is further decreased
when those defending the sta
tus quo are men who are per
sonally insecure, a tendency that
is heightened by the forces of
administration discussed above.
So, I am being merely de
scriptive and not prescriptive

when I say that conflicts at Stan
ford will not be settled on tho
basis of reason. Reason may
play a part, but it will not be
the sole component and prob
ably will not be the most im
portant one.
Having convinced myself that
I had overcome a bit of false
consciousness, I had to ask my
self: how had I been fooled so
long?
I began to answer by examin
ing how the university conceives
truth. Truth, I have been taught,
is perceived by the disembodied
intellect, objectively looking at
a situation. The only role the
feelings and the affective side of
man have to play, according to
this conception, is a negative
one; they may get in the way
bias the observer. In this sys
tem, the way to decide things is
to get feelings out of the way
and see what reason tells us.
Inadequate Conception
This conception is very inade
quate; it is not sufficiently at
tentive to what actually happens
when I make a judgment on a
situation. Here again I am being
descriptive and not evaluative.
When I scrutinize myself in
making a judgment, I find that
(a) I perceive the situation
through my senses so that my
contact with it comes 'through'
them and not directly to the in
tellect as if my senses could be
screened off; (b) my reaction is
conditioned and affected by all

sorts of factors not immediately
germane to a "reasonable solu
tion:" I feel that day, my attitude
toward the person because of
the clothes he wears, his past
actions, etc; (c) I am dimly a
ware of being partly controlled
by unconscious forces over which
I would like to exercise con
trol but can't. The list of factors
could be extended I am saying
that decisions are made by the
whole person. I think students
are aware of this, their adver
saries not.
Here is the tie in with the end
of the original part of the article.
Students have a different way
of conceiving truth and how it
is arrived at than does the ad
ministration and almost all of
the faculty. From the above ana
lysis it would seem that the
student view is more complete,
in that it recognizes and capi
talizes on more elements in deci
sion-making than the administra
tive conception does. This state
ment is again descriptive and
makes no judgments about the
relative merits of each side's po
sition but only analyzes each's
awareness of himself and of the
other.
Fundamental Concerns
This analysis suggests that the
gap between the two sides is in
deed very large. It involves not
only conflict resolution, but also,
ultimately, how one conceives
the university (truth is not just
intellectual) and what one con
siders to be fundamental human
concerns.
The original article suggests
that administrators, because of
the forces inherent in their jobs,
have shut themselves off from
parts of reality. I would reaffirm
now the original conclusion to
the article: "Students are claim
ing that they see things that
their elders have not seen and
that the resulting new perspec
tive changes one's priorities fun
damentally." It is in the admin
istrator's own best interest that
they begin to see these things
too.

ideal, I now see, is to be blind
to the workings of human con
flict resolution.
In any conflict situation, es
pecially those that will charact
erize Stanford in the next few
years, there are two forces: one
defending the status quo and the
other attempting to change it.
The second group is a threat
to the first and any time a per
son feels threatened, he does
not act rationally. At least, not
fully rationally. The rational
component is further decreased
when those defending the sta
tus quo are men who are per
sonally insecure, a tendency that
is heightened by the forces of
administration discussed above.
So, I am being merely de
scriptive and not prescriptive

when I say that conflicts at Stan
ford will not be settled on tho
basis of reason. Reason may
play a part, but it will not be
the sole component and prob
ably will not be the most im
portant one.
Having convinced myself that
I had overcome a bit of false
consciousness, I had to ask my
self: how had I been fooled so
long?
I began to answer by examin
ing how the university conceives
truth. Truth, I have been taught,
is perceived by the disembodied
intellect, objectively looking at
a situation. The only role the
feelings and the affective side of
man have to play, according to
this conception, is a negative
one; they may get in the way
bias the observer. In this sys
tem, the way to decide things is
to get feelings out of the way
and see what reason tells us.
Inadequate Conception
This conception is very inade
quate; it is not sufficiently at
tentive to what actually happens
when I make a judgment on a
situation. Here again I am being
descriptive and not evaluative.
When I scrutinize myself in
making a judgment, I find that
(a) I perceive the situation
through my senses so that my
contact with it comes 'through'
them and not directly to the in
tellect as if my senses could be
screened off; (b) my reaction is
conditioned and affected by all

sorts of factors not immediately
germane to a "reasonable solu
tion:" I feel that day, my attitude
toward the person because of
the clothes he wears, his past
actions, etc; (c) I am dimly a
ware of being partly controlled
by unconscious forces over which
I would like to exercise con
trol but can't. The list of factors
could be extended I am saying
that decisions are made by the
whole person. I think students
are aware of this, their adver
saries not.
Here is the tie in with the end
of the original part of the article.
Students have a different way
of conceiving truth and how it
is arrived at than does the ad
ministration and almost all of
the faculty. From the above ana
lysis it would seem that the
student view is more complete,
in that it recognizes and capi
talizes on more elements in deci
sion-making than the administra
tive conception does. This state
ment is again descriptive and
makes no judgments about the
relative merits of each side's po
sition but only analyzes each's
awareness of himself and of the
other.
Fundamental Concerns
This analysis suggests that the
gap between the two sides is in
deed very large. It involves not
only conflict resolution, but also,
ultimately, how one conceives
the university (truth is not just
intellectual) and what one con
siders to be fundamental human
concerns.
The original article suggests
that administrators, because of
the forces inherent in their jobs,
have shut themselves off from
parts of reality. I would reaffirm
now the original conclusion to
the article: "Students are claim
ing that they see things that
their elders have not seen and
that the resulting new perspec
tive changes one's priorities fun
damentally." It is in the admin
istrator's own best interest that
they begin to see these things
too.
(Editor's Note: This is the
second part of Bruce Campbell's
article about administration,
with a conclusion written in re
sponse to recent events.)
An even greater tragedy than
the administrative one described
in the first part of this article
and a tragedy with much wider
implications is the personal tra
gedy of the human price that
men pay in order to be admini
strators. The same forces that
operate to cause administrative
problems are the forces of dehu
manization that quietly and lar
gely without notice eat away at
a man's humanness.
The time demands on an ad
ministrator, for example are not
only the cause of his difficulty
in seeing a larger perspective,
they also facilitate dealing with
people in an "administrative"
manner.
Not Seen As Humans
People are no longer seen as
human beings but rather as
possessors of information need
ed to solve a problem or as the
instruments through which an
issue will be resolved.
The way in which a person
relates to others determines the
way in which he conceives him
self. Manipulation of others, even
to do the very necessary tasks
of the university, leads to instru
mentalization of the self. This
is a strong, though not inevit
able, force of administration.
The combination of time de

mands and role filling that faci
litates an administrator's iden
tifying with his administrative
function and thus makes it diffi
cult for him to get outside to
see himself in perspective is also
the cause of personal tragedy:
a man spends so much of his
time, even his non-office time,
as Dean, that he can very easily
come to think of himself only
in terms of his function and can
not look at himself as a person.
Conflict Developing
The pervasiveness of this out
look was demonstrated to me in
conversations I had with mem
bers of the administration about
the problems discussed in this
article.
All of them agreed about the
administrative tragedy, but no
one perceived or agreed that
there was any personal price
paid in administrating.
The implications of this are
great. A conflict which may be
one of the central issues in
America in the next few decades
is developing in embryonic form
here at Stanford. It is the diver
gence between a generation
which, on the whole, thinks in
functional terms and is very
leary of asking personal ques
tions and a generation which
focuses primarily on asking
questions about qualities of be
ing human, sometimes to the
extent of refusing to confront
pragmatic considerations.

After reading over this article
in the light of recent events, I
have asked the editors to let
me re-write the conclusion. The
relation of the new ending to
body of the article may not be
readily apparent, but I will try
to make the connection at the
end.
Stress situations, like the sit
in of last week, frequently burst
illusions we had taken to be
assumptions. One that was burst
for me last week was bromide
that an atmosphere of reason,
where issues would be decided
on the merits of the case and
not by the exigencies of power,
was an ideal we should work
toward. To hold that up as an
ideal, I now see, is to be blind
to the workings of human con
flict resolution.

Fundamental Concerns
This analysis suggests that the
gap between the two sides is in
deed very large. It involves not
only conflict resolution, but also,
ultimately, how one conceives
the university (truth is not just
intellectual) and what one con
siders to be fundamental human
concerns.
The original article suggests
that administrators, because of
the forces inherent in their jobs,
have shut themselves off from
parts of reality. I would reaffirm
now the original conclusion to
the article: "Students are claim
ing that they see things that
their elders have not seen and
that the resulting new perspec
tive changes one's priorities fun
damentally." It is in the admin
istrator's own best interest that
they begin to see these things
too.
(Editor's Note: This is the
second part of Bruce Campbell's
article about administration,
with a conclusion written in re
sponse to recent events.)
An even greater tragedy than
the administrative one described
in the first part of this article
and a tragedy with much wider
implications is the personal tra
gedy of the human price that
men pay in order to be admini
strators. The same forces that
operate to cause administrative
problems are the forces of dehu
manization that quietly and lar
gely without notice eat away at
a man's humanness.
The time demands on an ad
ministrator, for example are not
only the cause of his difficulty
in seeing a larger perspective,
they also facilitate dealing with
people in an "administrative"
manner.
Not Seen As Humans
People are no longer seen as
human beings but rather as
possessors of information need
ed to solve a problem or as the
instruments through which an
issue will be resolved.
The way in which a person
relates to others determines the
way in which he conceives him
self. Manipulation of others, even
to do the very necessary tasks
of the university, leads to instru
mentalization of the self. This
is a strong, though not inevit
able, force of administration.
The combination of time de

mands and role filling that faci
litates an administrator's iden
tifying with his administrative
function and thus makes it diffi
cult for him to get outside to
see himself in perspective is also
the cause of personal tragedy:
a man spends so much of his
time, even his non-office time,
as Dean, that he can very easily
come to think of himself only
in terms of his function and can
not look at himself as a person.
Conflict Developing
The pervasiveness of this out
look was demonstrated to me in
conversations I had with mem
bers of the administration about
the problems discussed in this
article.
All of them agreed about the
administrative tragedy, but no
one perceived or agreed that
there was any personal price
paid in administrating.
The implications of this are
great. A conflict which may be
one of the central issues in
America in the next few decades
is developing in embryonic form
here at Stanford. It is the diver
gence between a generation
which, on the whole, thinks in
functional terms and is very
leary of asking personal ques
tions and a generation which
focuses primarily on asking
questions about qualities of be
ing human, sometimes to the
extent of refusing to confront
pragmatic considerations.

After reading over this article
in the light of recent events, I
have asked the editors to let
me re-write the conclusion. The
relation of the new ending to
body of the article may not be
readily apparent, but I will try
to make the connection at the
end.
Stress situations, like the sit
in of last week, frequently burst
illusions we had taken to be
assumptions. One that was burst
for me last week was bromide
that an atmosphere of reason,
where issues would be decided
on the merits of the case and
not by the exigencies of power,
was an ideal we should work
toward. To hold that up as an
ideal, I now see, is to be blind
to the workings of human con
flict resolution.
In any conflict situation, es
pecially those that will charact
erize Stanford in the next few
years, there are two forces: one
defending the status quo and the
other attempting to change it.
The second group is a threat
to the first and any time a per
son feels threatened, he does
not act rationally. At least, not
fully rationally. The rational
component is further decreased
when those defending the sta
tus quo are men who are per
sonally insecure, a tendency that
is heightened by the forces of
administration discussed above.
So, I am being merely de
scriptive and not prescriptive

when I say that conflicts at Stan
ford will not be settled on tho
basis of reason. Reason may
play a part, but it will not be
the sole component and prob
ably will not be the most im
portant one.
Having convinced myself that
I had overcome a bit of false
consciousness, I had to ask my
self: how had I been fooled so
long?
I began to answer by examin
ing how the university conceives
truth. Truth, I have been taught,
is perceived by the disembodied
intellect, objectively looking at
a situation. The only role the
feelings and the affective side of
man have to play, according to
this conception, is a negative
one; they may get in the way
bias the observer. In this sys
tem, the way to decide things is
to get feelings out of the way
and see what reason tells us.
Inadequate Conception
This conception is very inade
quate; it is not sufficiently at
tentive to what actually happens
when I make a judgment on a
situation. Here again I am being
descriptive and not evaluative.
When I scrutinize myself in
making a judgment, I find that
(a) I perceive the situation
through my senses so that my
contact with it comes 'through'
them and not directly to the in
tellect as if my senses could be
screened off; (b) my reaction is
conditioned and affected by all

sorts of factors not immediately
germane to a "reasonable solu
tion:" I feel that day, my attitude
toward the person because of
the clothes he wears, his past
actions, etc; (c) I am dimly a
ware of being partly controlled
by unconscious forces over which
I would like to exercise con
trol but can't. The list of factors
could be extended I am saying
that decisions are made by the
whole person. I think students
are aware of this, their adver
saries not.
Here is the tie in with the end
of the original part of the article.
Students have a different way
of conceiving truth and how it
is arrived at than does the ad
ministration and almost all of
the faculty. From the above ana
lysis it would seem that the
student view is more complete,
in that it recognizes and capi
talizes on more elements in deci
sion-making than the administra
tive conception does. This state
ment is again descriptive and
makes no judgments about the
relative merits of each side's po
sition but only analyzes each's
awareness of himself and of the
other.

ing human, sometimes to the
extent of refusing to confront
pragmatic considerations.

After reading over this article
in the light of recent events, I
have asked the editors to let
me re-write the conclusion. The
relation of the new ending to
body of the article may not be
readily apparent, but I will try
to make the connection at the
end.
Stress situations, like the sit
in of last week, frequently burst
illusions we had taken to be
assumptions. One that was burst
for me last week was bromide
that an atmosphere of reason,
where issues would be decided
on the merits of the case and
not by the exigencies of power,
was an ideal we should work
toward. To hold that up as an
ideal, I now see, is to be blind
to the workings of human con
flict resolution.
In any conflict situation, es
pecially those that will charact
erize Stanford in the next few
years, there are two forces: one
defending the status quo and the
other attempting to change it.
The second group is a threat
to the first and any time a per
son feels threatened, he does
not act rationally. At least, not
fully rationally. The rational
component is further decreased
when those defending the sta
tus quo are men who are per
sonally insecure, a tendency that
is heightened by the forces of
administration discussed above.
So, I am being merely de
scriptive and not prescriptive

when I say that conflicts at Stan
ford will not be settled on tho
basis of reason. Reason may
play a part, but it will not be
the sole component and prob
ably will not be the most im
portant one.
Having convinced myself that
I had overcome a bit of false
consciousness, I had to ask my
self: how had I been fooled so
long?
I began to answer by examin
ing how the university conceives
truth. Truth, I have been taught,
is perceived by the disembodied
intellect, objectively looking at
a situation. The only role the
feelings and the affective side of
man have to play, according to
this conception, is a negative
one; they may get in the way
bias the observer. In this sys
tem, the way to decide things is
to get feelings out of the way
and see what reason tells us.
Inadequate Conception
This conception is very inade
quate; it is not sufficiently at
tentive to what actually happens
when I make a judgment on a
situation. Here again I am being
descriptive and not evaluative.
When I scrutinize myself in
making a judgment, I find that
(a) I perceive the situation
through my senses so that my
contact with it comes 'through'
them and not directly to the in
tellect as if my senses could be
screened off; (b) my reaction is
conditioned and affected by all

sorts of factors not immediately
germane to a "reasonable solu
tion:" I feel that day, my attitude
toward the person because of
the clothes he wears, his past
actions, etc; (c) I am dimly a
ware of being partly controlled
by unconscious forces over which
I would like to exercise con
trol but can't. The list of factors
could be extended I am saying
that decisions are made by the
whole person. I think students
are aware of this, their adver
saries not.
Here is the tie in with the end
of the original part of the article.
Students have a different way
of conceiving truth and how it
is arrived at than does the ad
ministration and almost all of
the faculty. From the above ana
lysis it would seem that the
student view is more complete,
in that it recognizes and capi
talizes on more elements in deci
sion-making than the administra
tive conception does. This state
ment is again descriptive and
makes no judgments about the
relative merits of each side's po
sition but only analyzes each's
awareness of himself and of the
other.
Fundamental Concerns
This analysis suggests that the
gap between the two sides is in
deed very large. It involves not
only conflict resolution, but also,
ultimately, how one conceives
the university (truth is not just
intellectual) and what one con
siders to be fundamental human
concerns.
The original article suggests
that administrators, because of
the forces inherent in their jobs,
have shut themselves off from
parts of reality. I would reaffirm
now the original conclusion to
the article: "Students are claim
ing that they see things that
their elders have not seen and
that the resulting new perspec
tive changes one's priorities fun
damentally." It is in the admin
istrator's own best interest that
they begin to see these things
too.
