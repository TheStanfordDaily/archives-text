## A 						Critical Look At CRE 
### VICTOR OWEN 
CRE (the Community for
Relevant Education) ... What
is it all about?
So far, it seems long on "pious
generalities and short on speci
fics," in the words of Professor
Stone of the English Depart
ment.
As information continues to
flow, I find myself alarmed at the
implications of what CRE is say
ing and what it is doing.
A pause for reflection Is need
ed here before we are asked to
follow the newest messianic
movement into the millenium.
The Birleffi - Thornton article
in the Daily (April 29) attempt
ed an explanation of the "larger
philosophy and purpose shared
by the individuals in this com
munity." The major points: if
contribution to personal growth
achieved through relevance
groups if a philosophy of change
within present institutions and
structures ★ a program of Na
tional Service as a major em
bodiment of this change.
The relevance group concept
as explained by CRE seems a
contradiction of the original idea
of "human groups" for develop
ment of human potential.
The "human groups," con
ceived by Professor Helen
Schrader of the Speech and
Drama Department and others
in "Project Encounter," are es
sentially leaderless and non
directed. CRE, on the other
hand, calls Its "relevance
groups" goal-oriented, "action
oriented," with an emphasis on
the leadership. The contradic
tion is clear from CRE's own
phraseology.
I question whether personal
growth could occur in such an
atmosphere. CRE could not pos
sibly tolerate something so sub
versive as growth in just any
direction — a direction which
might conflict with these goals,
actions, and leaders.
In this way, CRE represents
a dangerous threat to the very
personal growth it proposes to
encourage. According to Mrs.
Emelia Rathbun, founder of one

of CRE's forerunners: "We use
the Quaker method, we struggle
until we get unanimity." This
is anathema to personal growth
and individuality.
The function of the relevance
group is one of disseminating
propaganda. "The effort is di
rected at 'overcoming differences
between people' effectively aimed
at getting them to all (sic) work
together toward one goal."
Personal growth involves
personal goals, not one goal.
As far as performing the func
tion of combatting "some of
the frustration and loneliness
of Stanford," CRE probably
has had some measure of suc
cess. But it must face the re
ality that its program of in
creasing self - consciousness,
while relevant in its way to
educated, intellectual white
communities, may simply be
nonsense to the black ghetto
dweller.
The second aspect I question
is the philosophy of change with
in institutions. This is desper
ately simple-minded. CRE is ap
parently not aware that insti
tutions are more powerful than
the people who operate within
them.
CRE receives its strongest and
perhaps only major support
from upper-middle class white
America. Professor Stone's cri
ticism that there were no black
leaders in CRE's recent week
end conference is further vali
dated by the fact that its initial
approaches to BCRA and other
black leadership groups have
been politely but firmly rejected.
What CRE does not realize is
that the white man in the ghet
to, any white man, regardless
of his good intentions, is a sym
bol of white power. It has been
argued that blacks need white
technical advice — legal, politi
cal, social — because there are
so few black lawyers, politicians,
and social workers. But this ad
vice implies cooperation with the
white establishment. Black lead
ership is certainly more capable
of finding solutions to prob
lems in the black community

than imported white leadership.
It is presumptious of CRE
to expect the black community
to solve these problems accord
ing to the white institutional
framework, but that would be
the price of CRE's working
within the present structure.
When blacks speak of black
power, they could hardly en
vision its resting on a basis of
white advice. That would be
nothing more than a more
subtle form of Kipling's
"whiteman's burden."
The racial problem lies in the
minds of white Americans. CRE
does not belong in the black
ghetto, but in the white ghetta
as Andy Horowitz suggested...
speaking "to white communities
about white racism."
CRE appeals to upper-middle
class white students, scions of
important and powerful fami
lies; and their worth could be
in the white community where
they have considerable power.
But these people are accus
tomed to the exercise of power
— what Fulbright calls the "ar
rogance of power." They are
accustomed to controlling the
destinies of thousands without
once considering how these thou
sands might conceive their own
destiny.
It is also interesting that CRE
emphasizes leadership, since its
member are the ones who have
a firmly vested interest in the
establishment. When they reach
middle-age, they will be ready
to step into leadership positions
within the white community.
Thus, CRE is good practice foi
their probable futures.

CRE (the Community for
Relevant Education) ... What
is it all about?
So far, it seems long on "pious
generalities and short on speci
fics," in the words of Professor
Stone of the English Depart
ment.
As information continues to
flow, I find myself alarmed at the
implications of what CRE is say
ing and what it is doing.
A pause for reflection Is need
ed here before we are asked to
follow the newest messianic
movement into the millenium.
The Birleffi - Thornton article
in the Daily (April 29) attempt
ed an explanation of the "larger
philosophy and purpose shared
by the individuals in this com
munity." The major points: if
contribution to personal growth
achieved through relevance
groups if a philosophy of change
within present institutions and
structures ★ a program of Na
tional Service as a major em
bodiment of this change.
The relevance group concept
as explained by CRE seems a
contradiction of the original idea
of "human groups" for develop
ment of human potential.
The "human groups," con
ceived by Professor Helen
Schrader of the Speech and
Drama Department and others
in "Project Encounter," are es
sentially leaderless and non
directed. CRE, on the other
hand, calls Its "relevance
groups" goal-oriented, "action
oriented," with an emphasis on
the leadership. The contradic
tion is clear from CRE's own
phraseology.
I question whether personal
growth could occur in such an
atmosphere. CRE could not pos
sibly tolerate something so sub
versive as growth in just any
direction — a direction which
might conflict with these goals,
actions, and leaders.
In this way, CRE represents
a dangerous threat to the very
personal growth it proposes to
encourage. According to Mrs.
Emelia Rathbun, founder of one

of CRE's forerunners: "We use
the Quaker method, we struggle
until we get unanimity." This
is anathema to personal growth
and individuality.
The function of the relevance
group is one of disseminating
propaganda. "The effort is di
rected at 'overcoming differences
between people' effectively aimed
at getting them to all (sic) work
together toward one goal."
Personal growth involves
personal goals, not one goal.
As far as performing the func
tion of combatting "some of
the frustration and loneliness
of Stanford," CRE probably
has had some measure of suc
cess. But it must face the re
ality that its program of in
creasing self - consciousness,
while relevant in its way to
educated, intellectual white
communities, may simply be
nonsense to the black ghetto
dweller.
The second aspect I question
is the philosophy of change with
in institutions. This is desper
ately simple-minded. CRE is ap
parently not aware that insti
tutions are more powerful than
the people who operate within
them.
CRE receives its strongest and
perhaps only major support
from upper-middle class white
America. Professor Stone's cri
ticism that there were no black
leaders in CRE's recent week
end conference is further vali
dated by the fact that its initial
approaches to BCRA and other
black leadership groups have
been politely but firmly rejected.
What CRE does not realize is
that the white man in the ghet
to, any white man, regardless
of his good intentions, is a sym
bol of white power. It has been
argued that blacks need white
technical advice — legal, politi
cal, social — because there are
so few black lawyers, politicians,
and social workers. But this ad
vice implies cooperation with the
white establishment. Black lead
ership is certainly more capable
of finding solutions to prob
lems in the black community

than imported white leadership.
It is presumptious of CRE
to expect the black community
to solve these problems accord
ing to the white institutional
framework, but that would be
the price of CRE's working
within the present structure.
When blacks speak of black
power, they could hardly en
vision its resting on a basis of
white advice. That would be
nothing more than a more
subtle form of Kipling's
"whiteman's burden."
The racial problem lies in the
minds of white Americans. CRE
does not belong in the black
ghetto, but in the white ghetta
as Andy Horowitz suggested...
speaking "to white communities
about white racism."
CRE appeals to upper-middle
class white students, scions of
important and powerful fami
lies; and their worth could be
in the white community where
they have considerable power.
But these people are accus
tomed to the exercise of power
— what Fulbright calls the "ar
rogance of power." They are
accustomed to controlling the
destinies of thousands without
once considering how these thou
sands might conceive their own
destiny.
It is also interesting that CRE
emphasizes leadership, since its
member are the ones who have
a firmly vested interest in the
establishment. When they reach
middle-age, they will be ready
to step into leadership positions
within the white community.
Thus, CRE is good practice foi

tomed to the exercise of power
— what Fulbright calls the "ar
rogance of power." They are
accustomed to controlling the
destinies of thousands without
once considering how these thou
sands might conceive their own
destiny.
It is also interesting that CRE
emphasizes leadership, since its
member are the ones who have
a firmly vested interest in the
establishment. When they reach
middle-age, they will be ready
to step into leadership positions
within the white community.
Thus, CRE is good practice foi
their probable futures.

CRE (the Community for
Relevant Education) ... What
is it all about?
So far, it seems long on "pious
generalities and short on speci
fics," in the words of Professor
Stone of the English Depart
ment.
As information continues to
flow, I find myself alarmed at the
implications of what CRE is say
ing and what it is doing.
A pause for reflection Is need
ed here before we are asked to
follow the newest messianic
movement into the millenium.
The Birleffi - Thornton article
in the Daily (April 29) attempt
ed an explanation of the "larger
philosophy and purpose shared
by the individuals in this com
munity." The major points: if
contribution to personal growth
achieved through relevance
groups if a philosophy of change
within present institutions and
structures ★ a program of Na
tional Service as a major em
bodiment of this change.
The relevance group concept
as explained by CRE seems a
contradiction of the original idea
of "human groups" for develop
ment of human potential.
The "human groups," con
ceived by Professor Helen
Schrader of the Speech and
Drama Department and others
in "Project Encounter," are es
sentially leaderless and non
directed. CRE, on the other
hand, calls Its "relevance
groups" goal-oriented, "action
oriented," with an emphasis on
the leadership. The contradic
tion is clear from CRE's own
phraseology.
I question whether personal
growth could occur in such an
atmosphere. CRE could not pos
sibly tolerate something so sub
versive as growth in just any
direction — a direction which
might conflict with these goals,
actions, and leaders.
In this way, CRE represents
a dangerous threat to the very
personal growth it proposes to
encourage. According to Mrs.
Emelia Rathbun, founder of one

of CRE's forerunners: "We use
the Quaker method, we struggle
until we get unanimity." This
is anathema to personal growth
and individuality.
The function of the relevance
group is one of disseminating
propaganda. "The effort is di
rected at 'overcoming differences
between people' effectively aimed
at getting them to all (sic) work
together toward one goal."
Personal growth involves
personal goals, not one goal.
As far as performing the func
tion of combatting "some of
the frustration and loneliness
of Stanford," CRE probably
has had some measure of suc
cess. But it must face the re
ality that its program of in
creasing self - consciousness,
while relevant in its way to
educated, intellectual white
communities, may simply be
nonsense to the black ghetto
dweller.
The second aspect I question
is the philosophy of change with
in institutions. This is desper
ately simple-minded. CRE is ap
parently not aware that insti
tutions are more powerful than
the people who operate within
them.
CRE receives its strongest and
perhaps only major support
from upper-middle class white
America. Professor Stone's cri
ticism that there were no black
leaders in CRE's recent week
end conference is further vali
dated by the fact that its initial
approaches to BCRA and other
black leadership groups have
been politely but firmly rejected.
What CRE does not realize is
that the white man in the ghet
to, any white man, regardless
of his good intentions, is a sym
bol of white power. It has been
argued that blacks need white
technical advice — legal, politi
cal, social — because there are
so few black lawyers, politicians,
and social workers. But this ad
vice implies cooperation with the
white establishment. Black lead
ership is certainly more capable
of finding solutions to prob
lems in the black community

than imported white leadership.
It is presumptious of CRE
to expect the black community
to solve these problems accord
ing to the white institutional
framework, but that would be
the price of CRE's working
within the present structure.
When blacks speak of black
power, they could hardly en
vision its resting on a basis of
white advice. That would be
nothing more than a more
subtle form of Kipling's
"whiteman's burden."
The racial problem lies in the
minds of white Americans. CRE
does not belong in the black
ghetto, but in the white ghetta
as Andy Horowitz suggested...
speaking "to white communities
about white racism."
CRE appeals to upper-middle
class white students, scions of
important and powerful fami
lies; and their worth could be
in the white community where
they have considerable power.
But these people are accus
tomed to the exercise of power
— what Fulbright calls the "ar
rogance of power." They are
accustomed to controlling the
destinies of thousands without
once considering how these thou
sands might conceive their own
destiny.
