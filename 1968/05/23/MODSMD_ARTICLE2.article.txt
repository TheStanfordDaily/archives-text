# ASSU Professorship May Begin Next Fall
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Students at Stanford will be
hiring a few professors them
selves next year — with a little
luck and a little money.
The ASSU professorship, orig
inated last year but delayed un
til now by a lack of funds, is a
plan to bring "somebody on the
campus that the campus cannot
offer," according to Cesare Mas
sarenti, ASSU president.
The present plan for next
year, if sufficient funds can be
found, Is to have three ASSU
professors, one each quarter.
One of the three would be
a humanist. Under consideration
now are Claude Levi-Strauss,
sociologist at the Sorbonne, and
Herbert Marcuse, social philos
opher.
Of tne other two proiessors,
one would be a scientist, hope
fully one involved with the uses

of atomic energy, "certain as
pects of the scientific world
which are never talked about
but are of extreme interest,"
Massarenti said.
The other would be a black
artist, such as Cecil Taylor, who
was on campus for two weeks
earlier this quarter.
The professorship was estab
lished about this time last year
after an effort to get it added
to the ASSU by-laws, spear
headed by Peter Lyman, Tom
Forstenzer, and Chris Harte.
Three thousand dollars was
put into the contingecy fund for
the project, "with the hope we
could do something." Massarenti
said. But attempts to get sup
port from various foundations
during the summer failed, and
the plans went into a temporary
limbo.

Massarenti held conferences
with members of the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council in November to clear
up some details as to academic
credentials necessary to have the
person invited by ASSU called
a "professor."
Massarenti sent out letters to
about 40 people earlier this year,
hoping to get the program un
derway this spring, but the Leg
islature refused to appropriate
funds, claiming the program was
"not well organized."
Since then, it has been de
cided to have three professors
instead of one for next year.
One reason was the late start
in finding people, another the
loss of interest by the students
in one man over the span of
three quarters.

til now by a lack of funds, is a
plan to bring "somebody on the
campus that the campus cannot
offer," according to Cesare Mas
sarenti, ASSU president.
The present plan for next
year, if sufficient funds can be
found, Is to have three ASSU
professors, one each quarter.
One of the three would be
a humanist. Under consideration
now are Claude Levi-Strauss,
sociologist at the Sorbonne, and
Herbert Marcuse, social philos
opher.
Of tne other two proiessors,
one would be a scientist, hope
fully one involved with the uses

of atomic energy, "certain as
pects of the scientific world
which are never talked about
but are of extreme interest,"
Massarenti said.
The other would be a black
artist, such as Cecil Taylor, who
was on campus for two weeks
earlier this quarter.
The professorship was estab
lished about this time last year
after an effort to get it added
to the ASSU by-laws, spear
headed by Peter Lyman, Tom
Forstenzer, and Chris Harte.
Three thousand dollars was
put into the contingecy fund for
the project, "with the hope we
could do something." Massarenti
said. But attempts to get sup
port from various foundations
during the summer failed, and
the plans went into a temporary
limbo.

Massarenti held conferences
with members of the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council in November to clear
up some details as to academic
credentials necessary to have the
person invited by ASSU called
a "professor."
Massarenti sent out letters to
about 40 people earlier this year,
hoping to get the program un
derway this spring, but the Leg
islature refused to appropriate
funds, claiming the program was
"not well organized."
Since then, it has been de
cided to have three professors
instead of one for next year.
One reason was the late start
in finding people, another the
loss of interest by the students
in one man over the span of
three quarters.
