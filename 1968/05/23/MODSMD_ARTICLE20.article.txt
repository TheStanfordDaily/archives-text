## Rape Or Beauty? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Have you ever stopped to
consider the analogy between
social intercourse and sexual in
tercourse: The racial issue is
like a man trying to "teach" a
virgin, that first time. The
blacks are trying to enter a ra
ther virginal white society.
It may be a little painful at
first—particularly to us, the
whites. The blacks are like a
man who tries to "teach" a wo
man who won't let him; so he
sits and sulks in protest. He
may attempt a few forcible en
tries, but we are too "up tight."
As in love, you know, those at
tempts which fail are met with
hatred; those which succeed are
met with the joy of a new-found
universe. But the analogy ends
here: There is always another
woman; another society is hard
to find.
On a more sublime plane, the
choice is up to us: Will it be
rape .... or beauty?

In reference to Dick Mar
shall's letter (Dally, May 22), I
would point out that elementary
common sense dictates that one
first pull the plug on smoking
electrical equipment, and then
see if there is a fire.
Stanford's Fire Department
has never failed to promptly
respond to a real fire, but we've
been hauled out of bed a good
many times by phony 2 a.m.
calls from the fraternity area—
and not infrequently greeted by
a water balloon. As most of us
are students we don't get too
bent about it, and just go back
to our "firetrap on Santa Ter
esa."
If it's a 2 a.m. fire you'll get
sirens and enthusiasm; if it's a
2 a.m. RF we'll still some, but
silently.

Editor, The Dally:
Newly-elected President Denis
Hayes has called for the estab
lishment of an Educational
Commission to discuss the vari
ous aspects of education rele
vant to the Associated Students.
In particular, Hayes suggests
that the ASSU Professorship,
Stanford Course Review, new
seminars, etc., be the topics for
such discussion. I would like to
speak on behalf of the members
of the Academic Affairs Com
mittee in saying that there is
such a commission, and that we
have been discussing these mat
ters all year.
If any blame can be directed
for the seemingly "do-nothing
ness" of the Committee it
should be placed either on the
disinterest of students in the
affairs of the Committee, or on

the general apathy in these mat
ters as is reflected by the stu
dent body on the whole.
We therefore suggest that an
other committee not be organ
ized, but that the energies of
the offices of President and
Vice - President be directed in
seeing that the various ASSU
Committees and Commissions
are filled with active and inter
ested students who will work
and stay at it.
Progress in changing educa
tion at Stanford is totally de
pendent upon the students' in
terest and willingness to work,
not only with each other, but
with various University repre
sentatives. We have made little
progress not because there is a
lack of organization but rather
a lack of interest

Editor, The Daily:
From the editorials and the
responses to the "Letter from
Mom" in Monday's Daily, the
freshman writers paint a rather
sympathetic picture of the so
called gapped generation. There
are only two things they can't
stand—decadence in the adult
generation, and failure of their
parents and society to extend
to them unlimited credit while
they "experiment in extremes"
and "dare to adventure."
Make him earn his way, Mom,
and watch how rapidly enlight
enment takes place. Not only
will he gain satisfaction from
such an effort, but probably,
he'll be too busy and tired to at
tempt to correct all the terrible
injustices being perpetrated
against himself and his down
trodden peers. At least, he will
learn that what is being fed to
him by the Massarentis and
Weissmans, as well as their fac
ulty abettors whose courage ex
tends only to the inside wall of
the bastion of academic free
dom, does not contain calories.

Have you ever stopped to
consider the analogy between
social intercourse and sexual in
tercourse: The racial issue is
like a man trying to "teach" a
virgin, that first time. The
blacks are trying to enter a ra
ther virginal white society.
It may be a little painful at
first—particularly to us, the
whites. The blacks are like a
man who tries to "teach" a wo
man who won't let him; so he
sits and sulks in protest. He
may attempt a few forcible en
tries, but we are too "up tight."
As in love, you know, those at
tempts which fail are met with
hatred; those which succeed are
met with the joy of a new-found
universe. But the analogy ends
here: There is always another
woman; another society is hard
to find.
On a more sublime plane, the
choice is up to us: Will it be
rape .... or beauty?

In reference to Dick Mar
shall's letter (Dally, May 22), I
would point out that elementary
common sense dictates that one
first pull the plug on smoking
electrical equipment, and then
see if there is a fire.
Stanford's Fire Department
has never failed to promptly
respond to a real fire, but we've
been hauled out of bed a good
many times by phony 2 a.m.
calls from the fraternity area—
and not infrequently greeted by
a water balloon. As most of us
are students we don't get too
bent about it, and just go back
to our "firetrap on Santa Ter
esa."
If it's a 2 a.m. fire you'll get
sirens and enthusiasm; if it's a
2 a.m. RF we'll still some, but
silently.

Editor, The Dally:
Newly-elected President Denis
Hayes has called for the estab
lishment of an Educational
Commission to discuss the vari
ous aspects of education rele
vant to the Associated Students.
In particular, Hayes suggests
that the ASSU Professorship,
Stanford Course Review, new
seminars, etc., be the topics for
such discussion. I would like to
speak on behalf of the members
of the Academic Affairs Com
mittee in saying that there is
such a commission, and that we
have been discussing these mat
ters all year.
If any blame can be directed
for the seemingly "do-nothing
ness" of the Committee it
should be placed either on the
disinterest of students in the
affairs of the Committee, or on

the general apathy in these mat
ters as is reflected by the stu
dent body on the whole.
We therefore suggest that an
other committee not be organ
ized, but that the energies of
the offices of President and
Vice - President be directed in
seeing that the various ASSU
Committees and Commissions
are filled with active and inter
ested students who will work
and stay at it.
Progress in changing educa
tion at Stanford is totally de
pendent upon the students' in
terest and willingness to work,
not only with each other, but
with various University repre
sentatives. We have made little
progress not because there is a
lack of organization but rather
a lack of interest

Progress in changing educa
tion at Stanford is totally de
pendent upon the students' in
terest and willingness to work,
not only with each other, but
with various University repre
sentatives. We have made little
progress not because there is a
lack of organization but rather
a lack of interest

Editor, The Daily:
From the editorials and the
responses to the "Letter from
Mom" in Monday's Daily, the
freshman writers paint a rather
sympathetic picture of the so
called gapped generation. There
are only two things they can't
stand—decadence in the adult
generation, and failure of their
parents and society to extend
to them unlimited credit while
they "experiment in extremes"
and "dare to adventure."
Make him earn his way, Mom,
and watch how rapidly enlight
enment takes place. Not only
will he gain satisfaction from
such an effort, but probably,
he'll be too busy and tired to at
tempt to correct all the terrible
injustices being perpetrated
against himself and his down
trodden peers. At least, he will
learn that what is being fed to
him by the Massarentis and
Weissmans, as well as their fac
ulty abettors whose courage ex
tends only to the inside wall of
the bastion of academic free
dom, does not contain calories.
