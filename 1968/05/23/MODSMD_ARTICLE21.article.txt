# More Minority Jobs Sought By Sterling
## 
### 
President J. E. Wallace Ster
ling sent a letter Friday to all
faculty and staff requesting a
three-step program to "make
every possible effort to double
the proportion of minority group
employment over the next year."
Sterling requested that;
• Work that lends itself to
on-the-job training and that is
open now be brought to the at
tention of the Personnel Office

so that minority group ap
plicants can apply;
• Administrative and skill
ed, technical or supervisory
jobs that have vacancies be
"reviewed with the Personnel
Office with a view to the pos
sibility of filling these posi
tions with minority group
members currently employed
at the University";
• University departments re

examine their staff needs to cre
ate trainee jobs for minority
group members and help the
Personnel Department devise
new programs for minority
group involvement.
Sterling promised that funds
will be available to help depart
ments in on-the-job training and
improving current minority em
ployment programs.
The president wrote, "This
Is not a one-time-only crash
program! It is rather a contin
uing commitment which will
require imagination, under
standing and hard work on the
part of ail in the University
who have responsibilities for
hiring or supervising mem
bers of the staff."
He also mentioned the Human
Relations Commission chaired
by Law Professor Byron Sher as
a body to which employees could
bring charges in the realm of
minorities relations.
