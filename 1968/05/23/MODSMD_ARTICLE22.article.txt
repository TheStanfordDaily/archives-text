# Meeting Scheduled For Urban Studies
## 
### 
A meeting for all students and
faculty Interested in the forma
tion of an Institute of Urban
Studies has been called for noon
today in Tresidder Union, rooms
267-8.
The meeting, which will focus
on establishing goals for setting
up the Institute, will be directed
by a committee of graduate stu
dents in Political Science, So
ciology and related fields.
Preliminaries to be covered are
the following:
A list of courses presently of
fered and relevant to the study
of urban problems will be com
piled.
Ideas for new courses not cur
rently taught at Stanford should
be presented at this time. In
cluded in this are ideas for sour
ce-material, methods of presen
tation and so on. Design your
own course — this might be your
only chance while you are here.
Professors who would be will
ing to teach or organize material
for the new courses must be
found. Another necessary task is
to find professors interested in
forming an interdepartmental
Committee for Urban Studies.
The meeting committee hopes
to formulate ideas to create
academic programs in Urban
Studies at Stanford. Specific
ally, they hope to obtain support
for:
• an undergraduate major in
Urban Studies.
• a minor in Urban Studies
for doctoral candidates in appro
priate fields.
• doctoral dissertations on Ur
ban Studies Topics in appropri
ate departments.
A lobby to bring in scholars in
Urban Studies will be discussed.
Tentatively, the scholars will be
accepted on joint appointments
in the Committee for Urban Stu
dies and appropriate depart
ments.

Money is a crucial factor. The
meeting committee plans to ob
tain support by applying for
grants from foundation and gov
ernment sources.
