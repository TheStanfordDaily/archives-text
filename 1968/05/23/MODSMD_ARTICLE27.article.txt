# Hershey Opposing Right To Counsel

### 
WASHINGTON (CPS) —Selec
tive Service Director Lewis B.
Hershey, who has opposed every
major proposal to reform the
draft, testified before Congress
last week that young men
should not have the right to be
represented by an attorney when
they appear before local draft
boards.
Giving potential draftees
the right of counsel would
cause "infinite delays" in the
Induction process, Hershey
said. "We have a great many
people who can stall off for a
year or a year and a half
the way it is now."
Presently, Selective Service
regulations specifically deny the
right of counsel to potential
draftees when they appear in
person before their local draft
boards. Ten senators, however,
are sponsoring a bill which

would guarantee this right to
all Selective Service registrants.
"If we get this war over, and
if a fellow can already put off
getting in for a year or more,
he may be able to get out of the
service entirely" if the bill
passes, Hershey said. He testi
fied before the Senate's Judici
ary Subcommittee on Adminis
trative Practice and Procedure.
Sen. Edward V. Long, the
chairman of the subcommittee
and the chief sponsor of the bill,
rejected Hershey's arguments,
saying, "When the young man
has been called before his draft
board, there is perhaps no great
er time when he might need the
assistance of counsel."
When he introduced the bill,
Long said, "we are concerned
with the very freedom of an in
dividual—perhaps even a life or
death situation."
