Foreign student enrollment at
Stanford passed the 1000 mark
again this year, Kenneth J. Coop
er, associate graduate dean for
international students and direct
or of the Bechtel International
Student Center, reported today.
The exact count as of autumn
quarter is 1013, down three from
1966-67, Dr. Cooper's report dis
closed. The greatest majority

are male graduate students in
engineering. More than # half
(56 per cent) are unmarried.
After engineering, which en
compasses nearly 40 per cent of
the foreign student enrollment
by school, come in descending
order humanities and sciences
and business.
Less than 10 per cent are en
rolled in such fields as earth sci

ences, education, general studies,
food research, and medicine, the
report showed. Less than one
cent are enrolled in law, bio
physics, nursing or graduate
special programs.
Of the total registration, near
ly 12 per cent are enrolled in
electrical engineering. Slightly
over seven per cent are enrolled
in civil engineering and busi
ness. t
Breakdown of enrollment by
geographic area reveals that
nearly 27 per cent come from Eu
ropean countries, including Great
Britain; more than 23 per cent
come from Asian and South Pa
cific countries, including Austra
lia and New Zealand; nearly 19
per cent come from Latin Amer
ican countries, and nearly 13
per cent come from Canada.
Seven per cent each come
from the Middle East, North Af
rica and South Asia, including
India, Pakistan and Ceylon.
By country, the largest for
eign student contingent comes
from Canada (129). Other large
groups include Taiwan (84), En
gland and Wales (73), India (56),
France (53), Brazil (43), Mexico
(43), Australia (29), Japan (28),
West Germany (27), Norway
