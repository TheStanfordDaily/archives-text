SAN FRANCISCO (AP)â€”San
Francisco State College author
ities said Wednesday that sit-in
dissidents would be allowed to
occupy the Administration build
ing through the night as long as
their demonstration was peace
ful.
Police were called and the
demonstrators were ejected for
cibly from the building Tuesday
night under a rule requiring its
closing at 10 p.m.
The Academic Senate ap
proved a policy of keeping ad
ministration and classroom
buildings open 24 hours during
the current unrest.
A statement said the purpose
was to permit productive dia
logue among concerned students
and faculty members seeking
solution of the issues.
The protest group resumed
their sit-in as soon as the Ad
ministration building reopened
Wednesday morning.
After recessing at noon for an
outdoor rally the number in the
building reached 300 by mid-af
ternoon.

Tuesday's nine-hour sit-in by
about 400 militants ended when
police moved in with clubs to
clear the building. They arrest
ed 28, and several spectators
complained they were handled
roughly.
The dissidents are against re
tention of an ROTC unit on the
campus and demand the admis
sion of more minority students.
The college faculty voted pre
viously to keep the ROTC. May
or Joseph Alioto and college of
ficials disclosed that about 400
students from disadvantaged
areas would be admitted next
fall and nine more minority
group faculty emembers em
ployed.
Another source of dissension
on the campus of 19,000 students
has been the dissidents' demand
to retain a controversial teach
er of Latin American history.
Mayor Aloto supported police
and the college administration
for breaking up Tuesday night's
melee.
"No willful minority has the
right to seize a university," said

Alioto, attributing the cause of
the disorder to "street hood
lums."
Alioto, commending Negro
students for not becoming in
volved, called the demonstra
tors "right - wing storm trooper
types who seem to think they
can use a small group for their
own ends."
