# Columbia Rebel Students Denied Amnesty By Kirk
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Dr.
Grayson Kirk, president of Co
lumbia University, said Wednes
day he is ready to discipline,
suspend, or expel "any number"
of rebellious students necessary
and refused again student de
mands for amnesty.
Kirk spoke at a news confer
ence after the second early
morning campus police raid in a
month left 56 more persons in
jured, including 16 policemen.
Police said 178 persons, includ
ing 53 women, were arraigned.
A senior faculty committee
also condemned the latest out*
burst of student disorder on
the Ivy League school's Morn
ing-side Heights campus, call
ing on all students to disasso
ciate themselves from those
"who are clearly intent upon
the destruction of the univer
sity."
A rally called by leaders of a
student strike committee dis
persed after an hour Wednesday
night without incident. About
700 students gathered outside
the Columbia gates heard the
leaders urge them to "stay
calm."
The month-long student pro
tests have resulted in 998 ar
rests and more than 200 inju

ries. The school suspended all
evening classes Wednesday and
closed <41 academic buildings.
Police vans were stationed in
the area and 100 uniformed po
lice were visible.
Columbia has been In a state
of disruption since the begin
ning of the outbreaks on its
campus April 23.
The holding of classes has
been left to the discretion of the
various departments, teachers
and students since the reopen
ing of the campus after the first
police rail April 30. However,
some students have been boy
cotting classes ever since.
The executive faculty commit
tee said the action of students
who barricaded Hamilton Hall
early Wednesday was "destruc
tive of all efforts to create a cli
mate of mutual discussion."
The committee said the action
was part of "a politics of con
frontation" and that those en
gaging in such politics "bear
the major responsibility for re
sort to the civil authorities."
The Columbia Dally Specta
tor, the student newspaper, cri
ticized the university admin
istration in a special edition
for "repressive measures."
Deploring arson and violence,

the editorial said the adminis
tration has "failed to realize
that a broad base of students
seek a voice in the decision
making processes of the univer
sity."
Mark Rudd, a student leader
of the protests, told the Wednes
day night rally the strikers were
giving the administration "one
more chance" to grant amnes
ty.
"These people," Rudd said,

"are the bourgeoisie. They rep
resent institution that cannot
yield," because "they have a
vested interest in them."
Kirk, 64, an expert in politi
cal science and one-time diplo
mat, rejected the students'
most pressing; demand — am
nesty.
"There's no likelihood of
granting amnesty," he said.
"To the barricades!" the
students cried.

Columbia has been In a state
of disruption since the begin
ning of the outbreaks on its
campus April 23.
The holding of classes has
been left to the discretion of the
various departments, teachers
and students since the reopen
ing of the campus after the first
police rail April 30. However,
some students have been boy
cotting classes ever since.
The executive faculty commit
tee said the action of students
who barricaded Hamilton Hall
early Wednesday was "destruc
tive of all efforts to create a cli
mate of mutual discussion."
The committee said the action
was part of "a politics of con
frontation" and that those en
gaging in such politics "bear
the major responsibility for re
sort to the civil authorities."
The Columbia Dally Specta
tor, the student newspaper, cri
ticized the university admin
istration in a special edition
for "repressive measures."
Deploring arson and violence,

the editorial said the adminis
tration has "failed to realize
that a broad base of students
seek a voice in the decision
making processes of the univer
sity."
Mark Rudd, a student leader
of the protests, told the Wednes
day night rally the strikers were
giving the administration "one
more chance" to grant amnes
ty.
"These people," Rudd said,

"are the bourgeoisie. They rep
resent institution that cannot
yield," because "they have a
vested interest in them."
Kirk, 64, an expert in politi
cal science and one-time diplo
mat, rejected the students'
most pressing; demand — am
nesty.
"There's no likelihood of
granting amnesty," he said.
"To the barricades!" the
students cried.
