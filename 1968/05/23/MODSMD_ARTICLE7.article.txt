## Dissatisfied With Draw? Try Again 
### BARBARA RITZ 
The second round of the Uni
versity draw tomorrow will give
tho'-e still unassigned to resi
dences nnother rhance to live on
eampus.
Students dissatisfied with
their present assignments may
also participate in the second
draw.
Doug Davis, assistant to the
dean of students, explained
that rouphlv 1.20 men In
freshmen residences were un
able to be placed on campus.
"We were able to take one
third of the freshmen men who
live in all freshmen residences,"
said Davis. "Those with num
bers higher than 2900 were not
assigned at this time unless
they indicated that they elected
an eating club and would live
in Toyon."
"We had originally expected
to house all freshmen men who
wanted to live on campus," he
explained. "Part of our prob
lem was the reduced number of
women who planned to go off
campus. The other problem is
that about 150 more freshmen
are coming to Stanford than
expected."
One difficulty for freshmen
who did not get residences
was brought about by the

priority system, Davis com
mented.
First priority for men was
given to upper classmen who
wanted to continue living in
their same residences. The sec
ond category were freshmen in
all freshmen residences. Trans
fer students have last priority.
As a result of this draw sys
tem, there were several ques
tions asked about priorities,
Davis commented. If you start
arguing equities as to who
housing most, then you
a dilemma, he Do
you give priority to transfer
students, next year's sorho
mores, or seniors who have al
ready invested a lot of their
time in a residence and want
to remain there, he askM. He
explained that a number
of the freshmen men suff r as
a result.
All students assigned places
on campus have to sign resi
dence contracts by June 1 or
forfeit their places on campus.
"The difficulty with the
June deadline is that stu
dents, after getting assign
ments, can wait until June 1
before declaring their Inten
tion to move off campus. The
sooner we know people are
moving off campus or going

overseas, the sooner we can
make assignments to fresh
men."
July 1 is the last date for any
cancellation of a housing assign
ment without forfeiture of the
50 dollar deposit. Davis explain
ed that the University hoped to
get enough cancellations from
men and women to provide
housing for some of the fresh
men. During the summer the
housing office will be in corre
housing office will be in corres
pondence v. ith those who haven't
b nn pl"ie,~d in residences.
According to Assistant Dean
of Students Sally Mahoney, the
University may not be able to
house transfer men and possibly
not miny transfer women next
fall. "We don't know how many
people are going to commit
themselves to off-campus," she
explained. "The demand for
space exceeds the number of
places on campus."
Numbers of students came to
the Old Union yesterday to ask
questions about the second
round of the housing draw.
I'm wondering if I'm put
ting myself in an undesir
able position by choosing to
live off-campus," said fresh
man Peter Goldsmith. "Next
year if I wanted to move back

on campus, I'd have more dif
ficulty because of the priority
system."
"Anyone who wanted to be
on campus should have written
down an eating club," said Brian
Custer, a freshman who wasn't
placed in a residence next year.
"You have until June to make
up your mind. But the form
asks whether you are a mem
ber, not whether you intend to
join."
Bob Herman, a sophomore
sponsor In Madera, said that
between 10 and 15 freshmen
In his house aa well as him
self were not akslgned places
on campus.
