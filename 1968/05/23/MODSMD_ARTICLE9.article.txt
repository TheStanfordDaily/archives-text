## Censure Motion Fails In France 
### 
PARIS (AP) — Premier
Georges Pompidou successfully
rode out Wednesday night at
tempts in the National Assem
bly to overthrow his govern
ment, but was immediately
faced with the threat of re
newed student upheavals.
A motion of censure over the
government's handling of stu
dent riots and the spreading
strike wave which has idled
eight million workers needed
244 votes for passage. It won
the support of 233 deputies and
thus failed by 11 votes.
Passage of the motion would
have forced the resignation of
Pompidou and his cabinet and
compounded politically an aca
demic and industrial crisis that
has all but paralyzed France
and jolted the 10-year-old re
gime of President Charles de
Gaulle.
In the showdown on the cur
rent unrest, 73 Communists, 121
members of the Federation of
the Democratic and Cocialist
Left, 34 centrists, 4 independ
ents and Edgard Pisani, Presi
dent de Gaulle's former agricul
ture minister, all voted to cen
sure Pompidou's government.
The premier beat down the
motion by announcing his readi
ness to discuss the demands of
the striking workers. Trade un
ion leaders came back almost
immediately with word they
were ready for "real negotia
tions."
But the leaders of the three
major trade union federations
presented a sweeping list of de
mands that would add millions
of dollars to the nation's wage
costs Just when French industry

was girding for head-on unfet
tered competition with its five
partners in the European Com
mon Market.
• Spock Trial
BOSTON (AP) — To the peal
of organ music in a darkened
federal court room Wednesday,
several young men were shown
burning what were described as
their draft cards before the al
tar of a Boston church.
The television films symbol
ized the government's case
against Dr. Benjamin Spock and
four antiwar associates on trial
on charges of counseling draft
evasion.
Spock was not present in the
Arlington Street Unitarian-Uni
versalist Church last Oct. 16
when the cards were burned.
The only defendants there were
Yale chaplain William Sloan
Coffin Jr. and Michael Ferber,
a student.
Dr. Coffin was shown shaking
hands with one of the youths as
he ignited his card from a burn
ing candle and then dropped it
with others in a metal recep
tacle. Ferber delivered a speech
during the ceremony entitled,
"A Time to Say No" but it was
not recorded by the television
crew.
The church ceremony is one
of the basic acts upon which the
government based its indict
ment against all five defend
ants.
• March Trouble
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
ranks of the poor at Resurrec
tion City, U.S.A., fluctuated rap
idly Wednesday as officials of

the Poor People's Campaign
banished 200 demonstrators
homeward and welcomed 400
new ones.
The departing group was
made up largely of militant
young men from Chicago, De
troit and other Midwestern cit
ies who were expelled for dis
ciplinary reasons.
The Rev. James Bevel, a di
rector of the Southern Chris
tian Leadership Conference,
sponsoring the campaign, said
the youths had been unable to
get along with the others in the
camp, especially the whites.
"They went around and beat
up on our white people," said
jßevel, "They interfered with
the workers and were hostile to
the press. We had to get them
out."
The arrivals and departures
left the shantytown headquar
ters of the campaign near its
planned capacity of 3,000, but
Bevel and other officials were
unable to say precisely how
many were on hand.
• 852s Pound Reds
SAIGON (AP) — U.S. Air
Force 852 sand Marine fighter
bombers teamed up Wednesday
to pound enemy positions in the
demilitarized zone, where grow
ing North Vietnamese strength
poses a threat in the far north.
The zone not only provides thr?
North Vietnamese with a base
close to Marine positions just to
the south, but it also is an infil
tration route into South Viet
nam.
In the air war over North
Vietnam, the U.S. Command re
ported two planes were shot

down Tuesday when pilots flew
131 missions against the south
ern panhandle.
In politics, Vice President
Nguyen Cao Ky told reporters
he will support premier-desig
nate Tran Van Huong "as long
as he remains anti-Commu
nist." President Nguyen Van
Thieu forced out Ky's man, Pre
mier Nguyen Van Loc, last Sat
urday.
Ky and Loc both oppose nego
tiations with the Viet Cong. With
U.S. backing, Thieu appointed
Huong who favors the Paris
talks between the United States
and North Vietnam.
• Talks Recess
PARIS (AP) — The United
States and North Vietnam
Wednesday night recessed their
preliminary peace talks until
Monday after the Hanoi delega
tion for the first time suggested
the possibility that these dis
cussions might fail.
In calm tones but with acid
words the two delegations once
again declined to budge from
stated positions. The leader of
the Hanoi delegation, Xuan
Thuy, asserted: "In the event
these official conversations do
not conclude with results, the
American side must bear the
full and entire responsibility."
A U.S. delegation spokesman
said he did not take Thuy's
statement as an implied threat
to break off the talks.
"It is a statement of position,
preparing the way for the posi
tion to take if, for any reason,
the talks did fail," said William
J. Jordpn, the American spokes
man. "If the talks should fail

the people of the world will
make their own judgment."
But the way the U.S. spokes
man described the session, he
left the impression the Ameri
cans felt they were sparring
with wraiths. The North Vietna
mese refuse to admit they have
any troops in South Vietnam, al
though U.S. intelligence reports
from Vietnam say Hanoi has
virtually stripped tis own terri
tory and has the equivalent of
12 divisions in the south.
• Boycott Reaction
GARY, Ind. (AP) — White cit
izens concerned about a Negro
boycott of Gary schools called
of their march on City Hall to
day after a meeting with Negro
Mayor Richard G. Hatcher and
a plea from the school board.
Mrs. Allen Myers, spokesman
for the three white groups which
had planned to assemble 1,000
strong on the steps of City Hall,
said Hatcher requested the
meeting late Tuesday night aft
er the seven-day boycott was
ended by a court order.
"We accomplished our main
objective by the return of Gary
children to the classroom," she
said. "Though not in complete
agreement with his (Hatcher's)
lack of action in last week's
school crisis, we projected our
position and determination to
continue our efforts to protect
our schools from future chaotic
disruptions."
