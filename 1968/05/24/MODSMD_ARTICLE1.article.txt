# Hospital Sale Proposal OK
## 
### 
The Palo Alto city council last
night voted to accept new terms
for the sale of the Palo Alto-
Stanlord Hospital Center. Their
vote was 8-1.
President Sterling had sent a
letter to the City Council noting
the trustees' agreement to dou
ble the original cash offer, mak
ing it $1 million.
The University also accepted
four other amendments pro
posed by the council. They are
arbitration provisions, advan
tages to community patients,
oral surgeons rights, and "cour
tesy staff" provisions for all hos
pital departments.
The City Council held the spe
cial meeting last night to con
sider Sterling's response. They
had previously voted 7-2 to ac
cept the negotiation terms "in
principle" if the amendments
were accepted.
Other terms of the proposed
sale are that the University
pick up payments of the city's
$3.5 million hospital construc
tion bond debt over the next
20 years and provide contin
ued community hospital care
over a 40-year period.
Sterling's letter concluded by
thanking the Council for its
"careful consideration" of the
proposed agreement. "We hope
very much that the city will join
Stanford in creating a university
hospital uniquely designed to
serve effectively the best inter
ests of the community and of
the university."
City Manager George Mor
gan, who headed the city's ne
gotiation teapi. said yesterday
he feels the university action is
"most responsive" and may
"point the way to an early reso
lution of the subject."
Morgan said he is convinced
the university agreement to
make 370 beds available to com
munity patients, with the at
tendant care and financial re
sponsibilities, "implies an equal
commitment that there will be
access to these beds by commu
nity physicians."
He said he is not concerned,
therefore, about the lack of a
specific "guarantee" that the

part-time teaching "clinical fac
ulty" will be maintained.
Palo Alto owns space for 220
beds in the new Palo Alto-Stan
ford Hospital and 150 beds in
Hoover Pavilion, the former
Palo Alto Hospital. In addition,
it has a share of equipment and
the operating room and service
centers at the new hospital.
In related action, the execu
tive committee of the Palo Alto
Medical Staff — comprised of
community physicians — has
asked in a letter to the council
that it be "provided the oppor
tunity to take part in any fu
ture hospital negotiations."
