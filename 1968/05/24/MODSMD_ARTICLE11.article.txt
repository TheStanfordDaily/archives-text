# On Flexibility
## 
### 
The University slowly is moving to meet the spirit of the ideal
outlined in the Study of Education steering committee paper on
undergraduate education issued earlier this year.
The English Department has gotten approval for a series of
two lecture courses with sections to fulfill the General Studies
requirement for freshman English. In spite of the quibbling that
went on over the number of units these courses should carry, ap
proving it was a step in the right direction.
And the Dean of Humanities and Sciences and his associates
have authorized about 15 of the special interdisciplinary majors
voteckjan. 5 by the Academic Council. Although this program
reaches only a handful of students, it sets a good precedent for
flexible educational programs.
The School of Engineering's recent study, on which there is
likely to be a lot more debate, also seems to be an encouraging
sign that scholars of many discipilnes are interested in helping
students tailor the Stanford experience to their desires and needs.
The open dialogue that has begun in the School of Law be
tween professors and students upset over the rigidity of the
school's requirements can only be a positive development.
The Medical School has been in the forefront of these innova
tions. Not only is each Medical School student's program indi
vidually tailored, all courses are on a pass-fail basis. The school
is in the process of setting up a permanent student-faculty cur
riculum review board.
llie aim of all these programs is more flexibility for the student,
and this is a goal that is eminently valuable.
We believe that in line with these developments undergrad
uates should at least have the option of completing their General
Studies courses on a pass-fail basis. If the courses really are for
the purpose of broadening our intellectual horizons, at least we
should not be threatened with the arbitrary agony of being
graded in them.
Rut the obvious extension of this trend toward flexibility is an
end to the General Studies System as now defined. That would
be a big step toward the sort of flexibility the Study of Educa
tion envisioned.
Education may then cease to be an obstacle course and begin
to be a creative, exploratory adventure.
