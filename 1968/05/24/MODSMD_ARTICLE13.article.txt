## New Politics Of Conscience 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
The charge that Eugene Mc-
Carthy's candidacy is ensuring
the nomination of Hubert Hum
phrey is one that disturbs me
greatly. It disturbs me all the
more because I am working 15
hours a day for McCarthy.
To the pragmatist I would re
spond that McCarthy is the only
Democrat in the field who the
polls indicate can defeat Richard
Nixon in November.
To the pragmatist I would re
spond that I trust Robert McAfee
Brown and Eliot Leventhal with
my vote, that I do not trust Jesse
Unruh.
But, for myself, the answer to
the McCarthy - Kennedy dilem
ma had to be resolved on a higher
level than pragmatism or politi
cal expediency. I have made
my decision for McCarthy be
cause I believe that his candidacy
has introduced a new style and a
new conscience into American
politics.
McCarthy's candidacy was in
strumental in the won't-run de
cision of Lyndon Johnson and the
initiation of the Paris Peace
talks. But, more important, it has
served notice to the Richard
Dalys and the James Tates. It
has served notice that the day of
voter manipulation and money
cum-machine politics will be re
placed. In California we will test
this hypothesis in direct confron
tation with the Unruh machine.
We must vote for and support
the candidate whom we feel in
our conscience is superior. Too
long, we have nominated second
best in the name of expediency:
Eisenhower over Taft, Nixon
over Rockefeller — and Lyndon
Johnson because we feared Barry
Goldwater.
With the supporter of Robert
Kennedy, I have no quarrel. But,

to the McCarthy defector, I say,
you have betrayed the politics of
conscience. And conscience is
what this campaign is about.

Left-Winged Minority
Resents Persecution
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to call your atten
tion to a blatant, thoughtless
omission of the administrators
and planners of Our University.
This omission is the gauche,
senseless disregard for left-hand
ed students who constitute at
least 10 per cent of our student
body.
Few of our classrooms are
designed to accommodate these
left-handed students with the re
sult that they labor under a try
ing handicap and an undeserved
disadvantage while pursuing
their education.
It is also my purpose to call
this grevi'- ?rror to the atten
tion of tne oppressive admini
strators and the hind-sighted
planners of Our University so
that they can act, within a rea
sonable period of time, to remove
this overt persecution of left
handed students from Our other
wise perfect University. Failure
to do so, I might add, most pos
sibly could result in corporate
action which I do not care to elab
orate here.
For those interested, an orga
nizational demonstration will be
held in the middle of the south
bound lane of Bayshore Freeway
between the Embarcadero and
University entrances at five
o'clock next Friday evening.

Secretary Questions
Motive Of Trip Plans
Editor, The Dally:
After seeing the article on
page five of Wednesday's Daily,
I would like to offer some infor
mation to set the record straight.
Enclosed is a copy of a letter
which Cesare dictated to me on
May 3rd. In that letter Cesare
said, "Chiara will be Milano
within the next three weeks and
will be living at her mother's
home in via della Chiusa 13." On
the same date, Cesare dictated
another letter which said the fol
lowing: "Since Chiara is going
to Italy on May 11, could you
please set up an interview for us
as soon as possible."
These letters, dated before the
sit-in of the Old Union, shows
that Cesare's wife was planning
the trip to Italy before any har
assment could have taken place.

ASSU Secretary
(Editor's Note — President
Massarenti yesterday denied the
conclusion reached by Miss Ta
vares. Massarenti says he did
plan for his wife's return to Italy
several weeks ago, before the
plans, and plane tickets he had
purchased, because his wife de
cided to leave her job and rest at
Stanford until Massarenti could
return with her. Renewed plans
for Mrs. Massarenti's departure
were formulated last Thursday,
May 16, when Massarenti pur
chased new plane tickets, feeling
his wife and child were being
harassed as a result of the sit-in
and the vote to censure him as
ASSU President)
