# The 						Capitol Scenes
## Predicting The Percentages 
### Art Buchwald 
There is a tendency this year
for all presidential candidates to
poor-mouth the results of a pri
mary. In the old days a candi
date would brag that he was go
ing to sweep a state, and there
was no doubt that his victory
was in the bag.
But with the pollsters and stat
isticians examining every pri
mary result in minute detail, the
candidates are all crying that
they'll be lucky to still be listed
in a Harris Survey.
Over at Kennedy headquar
ters, a manager told me, when I
asked him how Kennedy would
do in South Dakota, "We'll be
very satisfied with 2 per cent of
the vote. After all, we got in late.
Bobby really hasn't had a chance
to campaign and, besides, his
name is still unknown in the
state."
"How do you think McCarthy
will do in South Dakota?"
"He'll probably get 70 per cent
of the vote. It would obviously
be a big defeat for him if he
didn't."
n, And what about Hubert Hum
phrey?"
"Hubert has to do very well
in South Dakota. If he gets less
than 25 per cent, he'll have to
bow out."
McCarthy's people were fu
rious when I told them Ken
nedy's managers said if Gene
got less than 70 per cent of the
vote he'd be in trouble. "We

don't expect more than 3 per
cent. After all, we haven't any
money and, besides, Hubert
Humphrey is taking a lot of
votes away from us. We should
have an overwhelming
in South Dakota. But if Bobby
gets less than 80 per cent, he
can kiss California goodby."
At Humphrey headquarters,
they were also pleading disaster.
"Hubert got in too late for the
primaries. If he gets a vote of
any kind, we'll be surprised."
"The Kennedy people told me
Hubert has to get at least 25 per
cent of the votes."
"Twenty-five per cent—they're
out of their minds. They're just
trying to make us look bad if
we don't. Remember in Indiana
when Bobby only got 42 per cent
of the vote and he was supposed
to get 50 per cent? Well, that
was worse than Branigin getting
33 per cent, because Branigin
only expected 30 per cent."
"It seems to me," I said, "that
all the Democratic candidates
are predicting very low figures
for themselves so if they go over
those figures they'll look good,
and they're predicting high fig
ures for their opponents so if
they go below them the opposi
tion will look bad."
"I won't comment on that, but
if Humphrey gets one-half of 1
per cent of the Swedish vote in
South Dakota with the little cam
paigning he's done, then we'll be
very much encouraged."

I thought at Nixon's head
quarters they would at least
be optimistic, since he is not
running against anyone, but I
found nothing but despair.
"Vice-President Nixon with
out opposition will be lucky to
win the Republican nomina
tion."
"How do you explain that?"
"Why would anyone vote in a
primary when there is only one
candidate running? If Nixon
gets 85 votes in South Dakota,
we'd be surprised."
"But he's got to do better than
that, particularly with Rockefel
ler creeping up on him in the
polls."
"Our people feel that if Rocke
feller doesn't get at least 349,000
write-in votes, we can consider
his effort in the West a defeat."
"But if Nixon is on the ballot
and you say he'll be lucky to get
85 votes, how can Rocky get
349,000 write-in votes, when you
can't write in a name in South
Dakota?"
"That's his problem."
On the basis of the tour, I
decided to be very suspicious
of what each of the candidates
was predicting for himself as
victories. To hear them tell it,
they're lucky to be in the race
at all.
