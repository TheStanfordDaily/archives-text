## Misunderstanding Poverty 
### 
(Editor's Note: Following: Is
the second part of an article
written by VICTOR OWEN,
examining the Community for
Relevant Education —CRE. The
first part was concerned with
relevance groups and the phi
losophy of change within ex
isting frameworks.)
CRE . . . what is it all about?
The third aspect is this nebu
lous concept of National Service.
To quote Birleffi and Thornton
(Daily, April 29):
"National Service has been
started by private citizens and
will remain a private founda
tion."
"National Service . . . would
be operated initially in conjunc
tion with Selective Service."
As one sees from such clearly
contradictory statements within
the same article, CRE does not
understand itself; and since self
understanding must precede ac
tion, particularly action dealing
with others, CRE is just not
ready to be turned loose on the
ghetto.
Such statements appear based
on the assumption that there
will be "cooperation with the
Government without submitting
to government control." This na
ivete is regrettable. The price of
access to public resources, par
ticularly public funds, is control
by the trustee of those resources
—that is, the Government.
Cooperation with the Selective
Service is an ambiguous and
misleading tenet of the CRE pro
gram. Birleffi and Thornton im
ply that student and other defer
ments would continue—but most
especially deferments for CRE
activities, since a third group
choosing neither military service
nor National Service would al
ways be drafted first.
CRE has suggested that one
of the advantages of the al
ternative of National Service is
that "it would eliminate draft
inequities." What utter pom
posity! I doubt that anyone
has ever proposed a system
which would eliminate inequi
ties, but the CRE plan cer
tainly does not. It would ap
pear that upper middle-class
white students would be as
sured deferments if only they
join CRE or one of its affili
ates.
CRE envisions including blacks
in their program, but I argue
again that black leadership, even
if less well educated by white
standards, is better capable of
seeing and solving most black

problems than well-intentioned
white students descending on
the ghetto.
The problem is that CRE
seems too often not to under
stand the nature of poverty, but
how could it? Few, if any, of its
members have ever experienced
poverty. People who do not know
where they will get their next
meal, people who do not study
at wealthy private institutions,
people who do not have depend
able financial support from their
families—such people just might
not be able to afford the luxury
of indulging themselves in CRE.
What CRE members do not
understand is that there is a re
lationship between poverty in
the ghetto and their families'
next vacation trips to Hawaii;
that there is a relationship be
tween poverty in the ghetto and
the alpaca sweaters they wear
to drive their late model sports
cars into East Palo Alto to help
out in the ghetto; that there is
a relationship between poverty
in the ghetto and the money
financing their Stanford educa
tions.
But CRE is most dangerous
in attempting to "serve as a
diversified clearing house to pro
vide money and manpower "
I personally dissent from the
CRE program and resent their
attempts to coopt opportunitis
for dissent.
It would be tragic to see the
CRE program of National Ser
vice — a paragon of white mis
conceptions, white misguid
ance, but most definitely white
vested interests — to become
the definitive source of aid to
the black community.
What is CRE really about,
then? In the last analysis it
seems most beneficial to its own
upper-middle class white adher
ents. It is a way of reducing the
anxieties caused by the contra
diction between their emotional
ties to their past and to their
future and what the intellectual
arm of this University has been
trying to tell them.
These students have had a
comfortable and secure past and
can look for the same in the fu
ture, but only if they solve the
racial question in the United
States within the present insti
tutional framework. Otherwise,
it is a very insecure future for
upper-middle class white Amer
ica.
But intellectually they have
been exposed to some of the
faults in the sacred basics of the

American institutional system.
Nevertheless, because such
people stand to benefit most
from these institutions, they un
wittingly tie themselves to these
sacred white institutions.
CRE's weakness is the weak
ness of that class of society from
which it draws support. And
some of the preceding critique
is more a critique of that class
than of CRE itself. This weak
ness is a program of action
now, thought later.
CRE needs a great deal more
self-examination of the latent
content of its motives before
it dons the sacred white insti
tutional armour to ride into
the ghetto astride a white
charger to combat the "un
aware, unconscious, and un
changing" white middle class
power structure.
In their statement Birleffl and
Thornton clearly indicate the
location of the problem — white
America, not black America.
There, too, is the location of the
solution — in themselves and not
in the blacks.
