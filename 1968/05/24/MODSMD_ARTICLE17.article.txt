# Letters To The Editor
## Firemen Ever Alert 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
After reading the letter to the
editor quote "Firemen Ignore
Peril in Frost" I am sure every
fireman's wife is up at arms
just as I am.
As the article started "Were
The Firemen Snug at Santa Te
resa" the general public should
know that no fireman is snug
when he is on duty, I don't think
the public knows the statistics
on how many firemen die from
hypertension every year. This is
mainly caused from always be
ing alert and apprehensive.
It seems that all bad news
can travel fast; as far as fire
and police departments are con

cerned, but is the public aware
of how many times the men are
called out of their beds at all
hours of the night, even when
they are off duty? Also how
many times the firemen respond
on an alarm when it is just a
prankster?
Do the public think the fire
men just respond to the alarm
and return to the station just
to go back to bed? No! They
must check out the building con
cerned, determine whether an
emergency exists, or if it is a
false alarm. Upon returning to
the station before retiring all
the fire engines must be washed
and placed back into service.
I am under the opinion that
the person who wrote the article
which appeared in the Stanford
Daily Tuesday May 21, appears
to be incompetent. He did not
check the lighting or wiring be
fore the arrival of the 4,500 per
sons attending the Sunday's 27th
annual Spring Sing. I wonder if
he checked with the electric de
partment to see if the equipment
was operable under these condi
tions.
Firemen and police are not
electricians, but are dedicated to
the saving of lives and proper
ty.
I know from my experience
and also from anyone who
knows anything at all about the
fire department that they are ad
ways there when they are need
ed for the preservation of life
and property.
