# White Plaza Rally
## Demos, GOP's Join Efforts 
### 
Democratic and Republi
can efforts to stop the war in
Vietnam were joined in a noon
rally at White Plaza yesterday.
Dr. Joseph Pace, who aims to
unseat incumbant Rep. Charles
Gubser in the June 4 Republi
can primary, and religion pro
fessor Robert McAfee Brown, a
member of Sen. Eugene McCar
thy's California delegation to the
Democratic National Conven
tion, spoke to less than a hun
dred students.
Brown, responding in part to
religion professor Michael No
vak's recent declaration of sup
port for Sen. Robert Kennedy,
declared that he "Would rather
fight than switch."
In an attempt to counter
the argument that a Kennedy-
McCarthy standoff In Califor
nia will deliver the nomination
to Hubert Humphrey, Brown
said that all-out support for
McCarthy will enable the Min
nesota Senator to spearhead
the defeat of Humphrey.
'The plea to switch from Mc-
Carthy to Kennedy because Mc-
Carthy can't win .... is no
more than an attempt at self

fulfilling prophecy," Brown
said.
Novak said on Tuesday that
his switch was caused by "a re
flection on the key strength of
Vice President Humphrey, Sen.
McCarthy, and Sen. Kennedy."
He said that McCarthy drew
his support from "a new force"
in American politics, the well
educated middle class, and Ken
nedy from the poor and minori
ty groups. He then claimed that
Kennedy is "in a position to
build a coalition between those
whom Sen. McCarthy awakened
and the poor and the minori
ties." In Novak's opinion, this
coalition can be the decisive
voice at the convention.
He warned however that a
split between these two forces
and the two candidates in the
Oregon and California pri
maries would knock both can
didates out of the race for the
Democratic nomination and
would allow Vice President
Humphrey to take the nomina
tion at the convention.
Novak observed that Humph
rey's delegate vote strength lies
in delegations picked by state

conventions rather than at pri
maries. He said that he feared
that McCarthy and Kennedy
might break even in the vote
totals in the last two major pri
maries and thus weaken the
cause they are both fighting for.
"McCarthy has already been
weakened" by his defeats in the
Nebraska and Indiana primary
contests, Novak said. He called
for support of Kennedy as the
most effective way to elect a
peace candidate. Novak has been
active as a critic of the Viet
nam war.
At White Plaza yesterday.
Brown denied the possibility
that McCarthy might throw
his support to the Vice Presi
dent if the nomination should
prove to be beyond his reach.
As one of McCarthy's dele
gates, Brown said, he could
"testify that we are not going
to the . . . convention to see
the policies of the present ad
ministration continued."
A member of the audience
asked how Brown would com
pare McCarthy's stance on the
minority problem with Ken
nedy's strong private support of
programs like- ihe urban renewal
project in Brooklyn's
Stuyvesant. Brown answered
by pointing to "the strength and
consistancy of McCarthy's vot
ing record on civil rights."
In a local campaign, San Jose
physician Joseph Pace referred
to Santa Clara Congressman
Charles Gubser as a "deter
mined hawk."
"Gubser has voted for every
escalation of the war in Viet
nam," Pace said. The former
mayor of San Jose chararter
ized himself as "101 per cent
dove" and called for orderly
but imemdiate and unilateral
withdrawal by the U.S. from
the Vietnam conflict.

On the civil rights issue, Pace
advocated quick implementation
of the Kernor Report on riots
and racism. "We have used up
our time," he said. "Now we
must actually do something."

nesota Senator to spearhead
the defeat of Humphrey.
'The plea to switch from Mc-
Carthy to Kennedy because Mc-
Carthy can't win .... is no
more than an attempt at self

fulfilling prophecy," Brown
said.
Novak said on Tuesday that
his switch was caused by "a re
flection on the key strength of
Vice President Humphrey, Sen.
McCarthy, and Sen. Kennedy."
He said that McCarthy drew
his support from "a new force"
in American politics, the well
educated middle class, and Ken
nedy from the poor and minori
ty groups. He then claimed that
Kennedy is "in a position to
build a coalition between those
whom Sen. McCarthy awakened
and the poor and the minori
ties." In Novak's opinion, this
coalition can be the decisive
voice at the convention.
He warned however that a
split between these two forces
and the two candidates in the
Oregon and California pri
maries would knock both can
didates out of the race for the
Democratic nomination and
would allow Vice President
Humphrey to take the nomina
tion at the convention.
Novak observed that Humph
rey's delegate vote strength lies
in delegations picked by state

conventions rather than at pri
maries. He said that he feared
that McCarthy and Kennedy
might break even in the vote
totals in the last two major pri
maries and thus weaken the
cause they are both fighting for.
"McCarthy has already been
weakened" by his defeats in the
Nebraska and Indiana primary
contests, Novak said. He called
for support of Kennedy as the
most effective way to elect a
peace candidate. Novak has been
active as a critic of the Viet
nam war.
At White Plaza yesterday.
Brown denied the possibility
that McCarthy might throw
his support to the Vice Presi
dent if the nomination should
prove to be beyond his reach.
As one of McCarthy's dele
gates, Brown said, he could
"testify that we are not going
to the . . . convention to see
the policies of the present ad
ministration continued."
A member of the audience
asked how Brown would com
pare McCarthy's stance on the
minority problem with Ken
nedy's strong private support of
programs like- ihe urban renewal
project in Brooklyn's
Stuyvesant. Brown answered
by pointing to "the strength and
consistancy of McCarthy's vot
ing record on civil rights."
In a local campaign, San Jose
physician Joseph Pace referred
to Santa Clara Congressman
Charles Gubser as a "deter
mined hawk."
"Gubser has voted for every
escalation of the war in Viet
nam," Pace said. The former
mayor of San Jose chararter
ized himself as "101 per cent
dove" and called for orderly
but imemdiate and unilateral
withdrawal by the U.S. from
the Vietnam conflict.

On the civil rights issue, Pace
advocated quick implementation
of the Kernor Report on riots
and racism. "We have used up
our time," he said. "Now we
must actually do something."
Democratic and Republi
can efforts to stop the war in
Vietnam were joined in a noon
rally at White Plaza yesterday.
Dr. Joseph Pace, who aims to
unseat incumbant Rep. Charles
Gubser in the June 4 Republi
can primary, and religion pro
fessor Robert McAfee Brown, a
member of Sen. Eugene McCar
thy's California delegation to the
Democratic National Conven
tion, spoke to less than a hun
dred students.
Brown, responding in part to
religion professor Michael No
vak's recent declaration of sup
port for Sen. Robert Kennedy,
declared that he "Would rather
fight than switch."
In an attempt to counter
the argument that a Kennedy-
McCarthy standoff In Califor
nia will deliver the nomination
to Hubert Humphrey, Brown
said that all-out support for
McCarthy will enable the Min
nesota Senator to spearhead
the defeat of Humphrey.
