## Way Out At Flick 
### DIAMUID McGUIRE 
Student and experimental films
are often an attempt to snare
significance and bludgeon it into
submission. Starting out with
out script or plot, the non-pro
fessional movie maker generally
attacks a theme that seems im
portant to him—something like
the meaning of life.
Experimental films are, how
ever, important and often inter
esting. It is tempting to say that
they are important despite their
earnestness, but earnestness
may be one of the most useful
assets of avant-garde cinema.
Without it the student of film
could easily be drawn into the
business of producing more and
better Salem advertisements.
The Flick is putting 1 on two
programs of short films this
weekend in Cubberley, on Fri
day and Saturday nights. Sev
eral very powerful pieces of
work will be screened, along
with some vivid examples of
the pitfalls that await novice
film makers.
Probably the most compelling
movie that will be shown is Sur
vivors by Dr. Henry Mayer. It
is a record of Mayer's tour of
civilian hospitals in South Viet

nam. The sound track and cam
era work are amateurish, but
Mayer's pictures of the shat
tered, maimed, ruined people of
Vietnam are beyond description.
Mayer says that his purpose
in making the picture was to
publicize the need to provide
medical aid for those who have
been shot, burned or ripped
apart by the war. But it is ob
vious that nothing can ever put
those people back together. The
damage that has been done to
them should be seen by those
who are responsible for it.
Pictures like Dihedron, Warm
Waves and Coirnne Liberte illus
trate the problems that student
film-makers have been trying to
make sense out of life without
having access to the grotesque
inhumanity witnessed by Dr.
Mayer. The three films abound
in the images that have become
cliches of experimental cinema
—the sea, the freeway and the
female body. With varying de
grees of success, these images
are used to bridge the gap be
tween what the film-makers see
and how they feel about it.
Warm Waves is a piece of
plastic nonsense. A naked blond
squirms around on a superim
posed pattern of surfers and
crashing waves. Better it should
have been kept in Southern Cali
fornia, where people think that
such things pierce deeply the in

ner mysteries. Waves is so bad
that it cannot be saved by the
most unusual set of nipples west
of the Rockies.
Comme Liberte is almost
excellent. Rick Wise, who
made it, shot some very good
footage, including a startling
birth sequence. He attempted
to use the best feature of ab
stract still photography, and
in some cases the result is
brilliant. But the pace of his
picture is often wrong, and
the sound track is burdened
by some pretentious French
poetry.
Dihedron is the ultimate stu
dent film. Survivors of Prof.
Henry Breitrose's beginning film
production will recognize all the
ideas and devices that they once
considered very original—speed
ing traffic, earth-moving ma
chines, stop lights and naked
girls walking in the hills. But
Terry Hayes, a student from
San Jose, demonstrates more
technical competence than many
of his peers.
There are many more. Dog is
God Spelled Backwards is a one
joke film, but it is a pretty good
joke. Language of Faces is a
document of the peace move
ment as it was an age ago, in
1960.
On Sunday evening The Flick
will also show Seven Samurai,
Akira Kurosawa's classic action
Eastern.

Dihedron is the ultimate stu
dent film. Survivors of Prof.
Henry Breitrose's beginning film
production will recognize all the
ideas and devices that they once
considered very original—speed
ing traffic, earth-moving ma
chines, stop lights and naked
girls walking in the hills. But
Terry Hayes, a student from
San Jose, demonstrates more
technical competence than many
of his peers.
There are many more. Dog is
God Spelled Backwards is a one
joke film, but it is a pretty good
joke. Language of Faces is a
document of the peace move
ment as it was an age ago, in
1960.
On Sunday evening The Flick
will also show Seven Samurai,
Akira Kurosawa's classic action
Eastern.
Student and experimental films
are often an attempt to snare
significance and bludgeon it into
submission. Starting out with
out script or plot, the non-pro
fessional movie maker generally
attacks a theme that seems im
portant to him—something like
the meaning of life.
Experimental films are, how
ever, important and often inter
esting. It is tempting to say that
they are important despite their
earnestness, but earnestness
may be one of the most useful
assets of avant-garde cinema.
Without it the student of film
could easily be drawn into the
business of producing more and
better Salem advertisements.
The Flick is putting 1 on two
programs of short films this
weekend in Cubberley, on Fri
day and Saturday nights. Sev
eral very powerful pieces of
work will be screened, along
with some vivid examples of
the pitfalls that await novice
film makers.
Probably the most compelling
movie that will be shown is Sur
vivors by Dr. Henry Mayer. It
is a record of Mayer's tour of
civilian hospitals in South Viet

nam. The sound track and cam
era work are amateurish, but
Mayer's pictures of the shat
tered, maimed, ruined people of
Vietnam are beyond description.
Mayer says that his purpose
in making the picture was to
publicize the need to provide
medical aid for those who have
been shot, burned or ripped
apart by the war. But it is ob
vious that nothing can ever put
those people back together. The
damage that has been done to
them should be seen by those
who are responsible for it.
Pictures like Dihedron, Warm
Waves and Coirnne Liberte illus
trate the problems that student
film-makers have been trying to
make sense out of life without
having access to the grotesque
inhumanity witnessed by Dr.
Mayer. The three films abound
in the images that have become
cliches of experimental cinema
—the sea, the freeway and the
female body. With varying de
grees of success, these images
are used to bridge the gap be
tween what the film-makers see
and how they feel about it.
Warm Waves is a piece of
plastic nonsense. A naked blond
squirms around on a superim
posed pattern of surfers and
crashing waves. Better it should
have been kept in Southern Cali
fornia, where people think that
such things pierce deeply the in

ner mysteries. Waves is so bad
that it cannot be saved by the
most unusual set of nipples west
of the Rockies.
Comme Liberte is almost
excellent. Rick Wise, who
made it, shot some very good
footage, including a startling
birth sequence. He attempted
to use the best feature of ab
stract still photography, and
in some cases the result is
brilliant. But the pace of his
picture is often wrong, and
the sound track is burdened
by some pretentious French
poetry.
