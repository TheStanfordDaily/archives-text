# Apply To Eat With Frosh
## 
### 
Any student interested in be
ing an eating associate at a
freshman dorm next year, can
pick up an application at either
the Wilbur or Roble office.
The program of eating asso
ciates is attempting to increase
freshman contact with upper
classmen, both on and off-cam
pus.
The eating associates within
the program will also attempt to
provide contacts for campus
functions, act as liasons with
professors in various depart
ments, and to arrange or con
duct informal or formal house
seminars.
Lastly, the program's spon
sors hope that the associates
will assist in pre-reg activities
for the frosh.
