# Ram's Head Interview
## 'Carnival' Producer Talks 
### BARBARA RITZ 
The following is an interview
with senior communications ma
jor Robert Stone, who is pro
ducer of Carnival. The Ram's
Head production was praised in
reviews from both the Daily and
the Palo Alto Times. Carnival's
final performances are May 24
and 25 in Memorial Auditorium.
Due to the small number of
ticket sales, Thursday night's
performance had to be can
celled.
Daily: What are some of the
difficulties in putting on a play
or musical at Stanford? Is it
true that the student body con
tributes greatly to the success
or failure of a production?
Stone: I feel that there is a
certain amount of apathy for
plays, musicals, and other Stan
ford productions. I know for a
fact that this apathy endangers
the lives of many campus thea
trical organizations like Ram's
Head, SRT, and Summer Festi
vals. Ram's Head, more than
the other two, depends on stu
dent support at the box office for
its very existence. We receive
no money from ASSU or the
University, and, therefore, each
show must pay for itself if we
are to continue to produce.
Dally: There were approxi
mately 95 people at opening
night of Carnival. Why is there
often low attendance for open
ing night performances at Stan
ford?
Stone: I think that one of the
main reasons is that so many
opening nights in the past have
been bad. People don't want to
spend money to see a bad show,
so they wait until the reviews
come out or until they hear
from a friend that such and
such is a really good show, and
they ought to see it.
Dally: How did the director,
Bob Morgan, include the pup
pets, dancers, and music into
the special appeal of Carnival?
Stone: Since you have seen
the show you know that there
are a number of appealing
things about it. High on this
list I think are the puppets. In
Carnival the puppets are the
lead characters, yet they are
also part of the people who re
late to them, Lili, Paul, and
Jaquot. As Paul says at the
end of the show, he is the pup
pets. He is, however, not alone.
Lili is also the puppets. The
way the show is written the

puppets become the people, and
the only method of communica
tion between the people. They
are real for both Paul and Lili,
and I think they become quite
real for the audience as well.
Some of the other appeal that
I think the show has is tied up
in the basic design that Bob
Morgan had for the show. He
wantedto put a carnival on stage
and make the audience feel that
they were part of it. I think
that he succeeded admirably.
Dally: What effect does cast
enthusiasm have on the suc
cess of a performance? Did you
feel that the spirt shown by
the cast on opening night was
sustained for other perform
ances?
Stone: Cast enthusiasm is per
haps the most important ingre
dient in the success of any per
formance. It is not, however,
something that a cast can turn
on and off at will. One of the
factors controlling cast enthusi
asm is ! i*nce enthusiasm. I
have seen audiences of 95 peo
ple really relate to a cast and
coax a truly great performance
out of them, and at the same
time I have seen audiences of
1000 people turn a cast off so
completely that a show will just
fall apart on stage.
Daily: Why do you feel such
great responsibility for the
show's success?
Stone: According to the con
tract that each producer has
with the Ram's Head Board, he
has "final responsibility for each
aspect of the production."
The producer's work begins
with the gathering of his pro
duction staff. To these people
he delegates the responsibility
for getting the show on stage
ready for opening night. After
his staff is chosen and at work,
the producer becomes a switch
board for communications be
tween staff members. I feel that
to perform this switchboard op
eration successfully a producer
must keep in touch with what
is happening to the show. He
has to see his staff members
regularly and run interference
for them with SRT, the Ram's
Head Business Manager, and a
host of university departments.
Often he finds himself doing
everything that there is to do
on a show, from hanging lights
to writing publicity releases.
Not every producer will do these

things, but the ones who care
wUL
In the final analysis, a show
that I'm producing goes on the
boards with my name on it.
Everybody connected with it
knows that I have a responsibil
ity to see that it goes in sound
condition. I, perhaps, feel this
responsibility more than I
should, but that is irrelevant.
Everything I do as producer af
fects the show one way or an
other. Sometimes I do the right
thing, sometimes I don't. Nev
ertheless, when I do do some
thing, I feel that I should take
the responsibility for that act.
It is not fair to say maybe this
would have been better if we
had done it this way. My job
is to see that it gets done the
best possible way the first time.

It is not fair to say maybe this
would have been better if we
had done it this way. My job
is to see that it gets done the
best possible way the first time.
The following is an interview
with senior communications ma
jor Robert Stone, who is pro
ducer of Carnival. The Ram's
Head production was praised in
reviews from both the Daily and
the Palo Alto Times. Carnival's
final performances are May 24
and 25 in Memorial Auditorium.
Due to the small number of
ticket sales, Thursday night's
performance had to be can
celled.
Daily: What are some of the
difficulties in putting on a play
or musical at Stanford? Is it
true that the student body con
tributes greatly to the success
or failure of a production?
Stone: I feel that there is a
certain amount of apathy for
plays, musicals, and other Stan
ford productions. I know for a
fact that this apathy endangers
the lives of many campus thea
trical organizations like Ram's
Head, SRT, and Summer Festi
vals. Ram's Head, more than
the other two, depends on stu
dent support at the box office for
its very existence. We receive
no money from ASSU or the
University, and, therefore, each
show must pay for itself if we
are to continue to produce.
Dally: There were approxi
mately 95 people at opening
night of Carnival. Why is there
often low attendance for open
ing night performances at Stan
ford?
Stone: I think that one of the
main reasons is that so many
opening nights in the past have
been bad. People don't want to
spend money to see a bad show,
so they wait until the reviews
come out or until they hear
from a friend that such and
such is a really good show, and
they ought to see it.
Dally: How did the director,
Bob Morgan, include the pup
pets, dancers, and music into
the special appeal of Carnival?
Stone: Since you have seen
the show you know that there
are a number of appealing
things about it. High on this
list I think are the puppets. In
Carnival the puppets are the
lead characters, yet they are
also part of the people who re
late to them, Lili, Paul, and
Jaquot. As Paul says at the
end of the show, he is the pup
pets. He is, however, not alone.
Lili is also the puppets. The
way the show is written the

puppets become the people, and
the only method of communica
tion between the people. They
are real for both Paul and Lili,
and I think they become quite
real for the audience as well.
Some of the other appeal that
I think the show has is tied up
in the basic design that Bob
Morgan had for the show. He
wantedto put a carnival on stage
and make the audience feel that
they were part of it. I think
that he succeeded admirably.
Dally: What effect does cast
enthusiasm have on the suc
cess of a performance? Did you
feel that the spirt shown by
the cast on opening night was
sustained for other perform
ances?
Stone: Cast enthusiasm is per
haps the most important ingre
dient in the success of any per
formance. It is not, however,
something that a cast can turn
on and off at will. One of the
factors controlling cast enthusi
asm is ! i*nce enthusiasm. I
have seen audiences of 95 peo
ple really relate to a cast and
coax a truly great performance
out of them, and at the same
time I have seen audiences of
1000 people turn a cast off so
completely that a show will just
fall apart on stage.
Daily: Why do you feel such
great responsibility for the
show's success?
Stone: According to the con
tract that each producer has
with the Ram's Head Board, he
has "final responsibility for each
aspect of the production."
The producer's work begins
with the gathering of his pro
duction staff. To these people
he delegates the responsibility
for getting the show on stage
ready for opening night. After
his staff is chosen and at work,
the producer becomes a switch
board for communications be
tween staff members. I feel that
to perform this switchboard op
eration successfully a producer
must keep in touch with what
is happening to the show. He
has to see his staff members
regularly and run interference
for them with SRT, the Ram's
Head Business Manager, and a
host of university departments.
Often he finds himself doing
everything that there is to do
on a show, from hanging lights
to writing publicity releases.
Not every producer will do these

things, but the ones who care
wUL
In the final analysis, a show
that I'm producing goes on the
boards with my name on it.
Everybody connected with it
knows that I have a responsibil
ity to see that it goes in sound
condition. I, perhaps, feel this
responsibility more than I
should, but that is irrelevant.
Everything I do as producer af
fects the show one way or an
other. Sometimes I do the right
thing, sometimes I don't. Nev
ertheless, when I do do some
thing, I feel that I should take
the responsibility for that act.

thing, sometimes I don't. Nev
ertheless, when I do do some
thing, I feel that I should take
the responsibility for that act.
It is not fair to say maybe this
would have been better if we
had done it this way. My job
is to see that it gets done the
best possible way the first time.
The following is an interview
with senior communications ma
jor Robert Stone, who is pro
ducer of Carnival. The Ram's
Head production was praised in
reviews from both the Daily and
the Palo Alto Times. Carnival's
final performances are May 24
and 25 in Memorial Auditorium.
Due to the small number of
ticket sales, Thursday night's
performance had to be can
celled.
Daily: What are some of the
difficulties in putting on a play
or musical at Stanford? Is it
true that the student body con
tributes greatly to the success
or failure of a production?
Stone: I feel that there is a
certain amount of apathy for
plays, musicals, and other Stan
ford productions. I know for a
fact that this apathy endangers
the lives of many campus thea
trical organizations like Ram's
Head, SRT, and Summer Festi
vals. Ram's Head, more than
the other two, depends on stu
dent support at the box office for
its very existence. We receive
no money from ASSU or the
University, and, therefore, each
show must pay for itself if we
are to continue to produce.
Dally: There were approxi
mately 95 people at opening
night of Carnival. Why is there
often low attendance for open
ing night performances at Stan
ford?
Stone: I think that one of the
main reasons is that so many
opening nights in the past have
been bad. People don't want to
spend money to see a bad show,
so they wait until the reviews
come out or until they hear
from a friend that such and
such is a really good show, and
they ought to see it.
Dally: How did the director,
Bob Morgan, include the pup
pets, dancers, and music into
the special appeal of Carnival?
Stone: Since you have seen
the show you know that there
are a number of appealing
things about it. High on this
list I think are the puppets. In
Carnival the puppets are the
lead characters, yet they are
also part of the people who re
late to them, Lili, Paul, and
Jaquot. As Paul says at the
end of the show, he is the pup
pets. He is, however, not alone.
Lili is also the puppets. The
way the show is written the

puppets become the people, and
the only method of communica
tion between the people. They
are real for both Paul and Lili,
and I think they become quite
real for the audience as well.
Some of the other appeal that
I think the show has is tied up
in the basic design that Bob
Morgan had for the show. He
wantedto put a carnival on stage
and make the audience feel that
they were part of it. I think
that he succeeded admirably.
Dally: What effect does cast
enthusiasm have on the suc
cess of a performance? Did you
feel that the spirt shown by
the cast on opening night was
sustained for other perform
ances?
Stone: Cast enthusiasm is per
haps the most important ingre
dient in the success of any per
formance. It is not, however,
something that a cast can turn
on and off at will. One of the
factors controlling cast enthusi
asm is ! i*nce enthusiasm. I
have seen audiences of 95 peo
ple really relate to a cast and
coax a truly great performance
out of them, and at the same
time I have seen audiences of
1000 people turn a cast off so
completely that a show will just
fall apart on stage.
Daily: Why do you feel such
great responsibility for the
show's success?
Stone: According to the con
tract that each producer has
with the Ram's Head Board, he
has "final responsibility for each
aspect of the production."
The producer's work begins
with the gathering of his pro
duction staff. To these people
he delegates the responsibility
for getting the show on stage
ready for opening night. After
his staff is chosen and at work,
the producer becomes a switch
board for communications be
tween staff members. I feel that
to perform this switchboard op
eration successfully a producer
must keep in touch with what
is happening to the show. He
has to see his staff members
regularly and run interference
for them with SRT, the Ram's
Head Business Manager, and a
host of university departments.
Often he finds himself doing
everything that there is to do
on a show, from hanging lights
to writing publicity releases.
Not every producer will do these

things, but the ones who care
wUL
In the final analysis, a show
that I'm producing goes on the
boards with my name on it.
Everybody connected with it
knows that I have a responsibil
ity to see that it goes in sound
condition. I, perhaps, feel this
responsibility more than I
should, but that is irrelevant.
Everything I do as producer af
fects the show one way or an
other. Sometimes I do the right
thing, sometimes I don't. Nev
ertheless, when I do do some

the responsibility for that act.
