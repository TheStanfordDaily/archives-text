# 'Build The Earth' Pageant To Be Co-Hosted by CRE
## 
### 
The National Service Founda
tion, a Palo Alto group sup
ported by Stanford's Commu
nity for Relevant Education,
(CRE) has added the word "vol
untary" to its name to symbo
lize a newly-defined stance in
regard to the Selective Service.
The organization is co-spon
soring a pageant this Sunday
which will feature a concert by
the Stanford Band.
Originally, the National Vol
untary Service Foundation
(NVSF) envisioned itself as a
privately-operated, nationwide
clearinghouse for social service
projects in which young people
could serve in civilian capacities
as an alternative to military ser
vice. This remains the basic
idea, but the Board of Directors
has now removed all prospective
ties to the draft and all vestiges
of conscription.
Over 2500 Bay Area adults
and students are working to
promote the concept of Nation
al Vountary Service as a posi
tive way that the youth between
the ages of 18 and 26 can con
tribute two years of service to
the people of this and other
countries.
The "Build the Earth" page
ant, which is being co-sponsored
by the NVSF, CRE, Youth for
Positive Action, and the Bay
Area chapter of "Build the
Earth", will be held Sunday,
May 26 in Frost Amphitheater
at 2 p.m.
The pageant will feature the
Stanford University Band. Its
theme centers around the con
tributions made by other na

tions to America. Foreign stu
dents will wear their native
costumes and groups represent
ing the Lion Dancers of China
town and Fiesta Mexicana will
perform. Other dancers will rep
resent Thailand, Africa, Scot
land, and Russia.
An admission of 50c for stu
dents and $1.00 for adults is
sought as a donation to the
NVSF. Children will be admit
ted free. Tickets can be bought
at the Tresidder Box Office.
