# Tribe Nine Fights For 2nd In Closing Series With Cal
## 
### GARY CAVALLI 
Coach Ray Young's varsity
baseball team will try to salvage
a second-place finish out of the
disappointing 1968 Pacific-8 race
this weekend in a season-ending
home-and-home series with Cal.
The Bears will host Stanford
at 3:00 Friday, while Sunken
Diamond will be the scene of
Saturday's 2:00 affair.
To other teams in the league
the second rung on the Pacific
-8 ladder would be a welcome
perch. But for the defending
conference champions from
Stanford, it is a bitter disap
pointment.
Prior to the start of the sea
son, the Tribe loomed as the fa

vorite to snare its second
straight circuit crown and third
in four years, with USC, UCLA,
and Washington State the main
contenders. But a couple of in
juries to key men and occasion
al hitting lapses cost Stanford
the pennant.
Second baseman Mike Am
mirato broke his hand and
shortstop Russ Tweet was vic
timized by a leg injury. Sen
ior Chuck Williams and util
ity man Phil Keller did ade
quate jobs as fill-ins, but nei
ther could match the fielding
or consistent .300 hitting of
Ammirato and Tweet.
The youthful Indians (with
only five seniors on the team)

are currently 34-12-1 overall and
11-5 in league play. They lost
ground on frontrunning USC by
dropping two out of three games
to Oregon teams last weekend,
then had to sit idly by as the
Trojans clinched the pennant
Monday when their doublehead
er with Oregon State was rained
out.
The Tribe holds a one-game
lead over UCLA (11-7) and
Washington State (10-6) in
the scrap for second place.
The Bruins meet USC Satur
day in their only remaining
contest, while WSU has a two
game series with Washington
Friday and Saturday.
Young will probably go with
senior righthander Harvey
Shank in one of the Cal en
counters, and either Don Rose
or Rod Poteete in the other.
Hitting-wise, the injury
plagued Tweet leads the club
with a .360 average, while Mark
Marquess and Bob Gallagher
are also well above the .300
mark. Gallagher blasted a home
run in both games of the Tribe's
twin bill with OSU, while Mar
quess' homer sparked the In
dians to a 12-0 win over Wash
ington Tuesday behind Sandy
Vance's five-hit pitching.
