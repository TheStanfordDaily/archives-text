# Fromm: 'McCarthyites Appreciate Life More'
## 
### LARRY McBRIDE 
Noted psychologist Erich
Fromm, speaking before a ca
pacity audience at Tresldder
yesterday, claimed that the re
sults of a recent study showed
that the supporters of Sen. Mc-
Carthy are on the whole people
who appreciate life.
The body of his thirty minute
speech was devoted to making
a distinction between two types
of people—biophiles and necro
philes. A biophile, according to
Fromm, is any person who loves
life, who appreciates all that

lives, grows and changes human
relationships, nature.
In opposition to the biophiles
are the necrophiles, those in
whom attraction to death is
stronger than attraction to life.
In this category go all those
who love any manifestation of
death—those who love gadgetry,
strict order, inflexible authority,
machines, anything which su
bordinates the individual to the
inhuman.
While Freud, according to
Fromm, held that the death and
life Instincts were of equal
strength in the personality, he

holds that biophilia is the in
herent and natural personality
orientation, while necrophilia is
for those personalities that can
not or are not allowed to de
velop love for life.
Fromm cited statistics from
a poll of a representative sample
of registered California voters,
including members of all eco
nomic, racial, and ethnic group
ings. It questioned both the
psychological and political atti
tudes of the respondents.
The study showed that 75 per
cent of prospective McCarthy
voters had biophiliac personality
orientations, and 25 per cent
were necrophiles, while 65 per
cent of Kennedy's supporters
have necrophiliac personality
orientation, and only 35 per cent
were biophiles.
The "statistically significant"
correlation between biophiles
and McCarthy supporters is the
reason why Fromm is cham
pioning McCarthy's campaign.
According to Fromm, McCarthy
has drawn a response from
those who are tired of the in
creasing forces of dehumaniza
tion, those who hope to inject
biophiliac attitudes into Ameri
can institutions.
Americans are growing out of
the myth that Washington does
not aff#ct private lives, and Mc-
Carthy is the candidate whose
program is based on a mechan
ical, biophiliac reassessment of
Washington's present orienta
tion.
