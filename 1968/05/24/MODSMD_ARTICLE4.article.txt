# Housing Shortage Affects Roble, Lag
## 
### 
(The following statement was
released by the Dean's office
last night.)
The first round of the Draw
makes it clear we must create
additional on-campus spaces for
undergraduates. The University
Housing Office is cooperating
with us in this effort
We now must ask the assist
ance of students who already
have assignments for next year
and who will be affected by any
changes we effect.
At this point we foresee the

following: assignment of grad
uate staff to single rather than
double rooms; re-allocation of
some residence space now used
for program purposes; convers
ion of some single rooms to
double occupancy.
The latter prospect directly
affects Lagunita Court and
Roble Hall. At Lagunita we an
ticipate an occupancy of 336, or
about 50 double-singles through
out the Court. Roble occupancy
may Increase 30, again through
the use of double-single ar
rangements.
