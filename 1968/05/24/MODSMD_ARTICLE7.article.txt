# Reston Rejects Images, Sees HHH-RFK Team
## 
### DIARMUID McGUIRE 
A leading spokesman of Ameri
can journalism, "James Keston,
advised a Stanford audience last
night to "wait, see, watch, and
forget stereotypes" before de
ciding who to support in the
1968 Presidential contest.
But Reston shocked the audi
ence which packed Memorial
Auditorium by saying that his
bet was on a Humphrey-Ken
nedy ticket for the Democratic
party.
He pictures Johnson and Ken
nedy meeting in some Chicago
hotel room after the fourth bal
lot, Reston said. And the Presi

dent will ask Kennedy to "do
for Hubert what I did for your
brother in 1960," he said.
This prediction brought some
laughter from the audience, but
Reston assured them he was
serious. Johnson's argument
that Kennedy must consider na
tional unity would be a com
pelling one, he said.
As he delivered the fourth an
nual Carlos McClatchy Memo
rial Lecture, Reston was more
concerned with what he regards
as the fundamental questions
that face American than with
the personalities on the current
political scene.
The questions, Reston said,
are "What kind of people are
we?" and "What should our re
lation be to the rest of the
world?"
But the crowd that turned out
to the newly designated
executive editor of The New
York Times seemed more inter
ested in his assessment of the
potential Presidential nominees.
In a series of thumbnail
that he passed up in
his speech and road in response
to a question, Reston described
the candidates this way:

• Robert Kennedy appeals to
the young and the minor
ities, but he has frightened the
middle aged and the middle
class — the voters who usually
decide an election. He is a pas
sionate, ambitious young man
who, in Reston's opinion, would
be a very effective President.
But he can be classified as the
"prosecutor type," a kind of
person that the American voter
usually avoids. If elected, he
might face even less Congres
sional cooperation than his
brother.
• Eugene McCarthy is an ap
pealing candidate who might do
the nation great service as a
teacher in the White House. But,
Reston said, McCarthy seems al
most too civilized, too detached
from the struggle win the Pres
idency. The momentum he lost
in Indiana and Nebraska prob
ably will prevent him from get
ting the nomination.
• Richard Nixon has carried
the burden for party for many
years, and is now in a position
to call in many political "i.o.u.'s."
Middle age seems to have been
good to him, but, in Reston's

dential election. He suggested that a Humphrey-Kennedy ticket
was a good possibility.
