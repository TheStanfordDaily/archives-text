# Reston Rejects Images, Sees HHH-RFK Team
## 
### DIARMUID McGUIRE 
A leading spokesman of Ameri
can journalism, "James Keston,
advised a Stanford audience last
night to "wait, see, watch, and
forget stereotypes" before de
ciding who to support in the
1968 Presidential contest.
But Reston shocked the audi
ence which packed Memorial
Auditorium by saying that his
bet was on a Humphrey-Ken
nedy ticket for the Democratic
party.
He pictures Johnson and Ken
nedy meeting in some Chicago
hotel room after the fourth bal
lot, Reston said. And the Presi

dent will ask Kennedy to "do
for Hubert what I did for your
brother in 1960," he said.
This prediction brought some
laughter from the audience, but
Reston assured them he was
serious. Johnson's argument
that Kennedy must consider na
tional unity would be a com
pelling one, he said.
As he delivered the fourth an
nual Carlos McClatchy Memo
rial Lecture, Reston was more
concerned with what he regards
as the fundamental questions
that face American than with
the personalities on the current
political scene.
The questions, Reston said,
are "What kind of people are
we?" and "What should our re
lation be to the rest of the
world?"
But the crowd that turned out
to the newly designated
executive editor of The New
York Times seemed more inter
ested in his assessment of the
potential Presidential nominees.
In a series of thumbnail
that he passed up in
his speech and road in response
to a question, Reston described
the candidates this way:

• Robert Kennedy appeals to
the young and the minor
ities, but he has frightened the
middle aged and the middle
class — the voters who usually
decide an election. He is a pas
sionate, ambitious young man
who, in Reston's opinion, would
be a very effective President.
But he can be classified as the
"prosecutor type," a kind of
person that the American voter
usually avoids. If elected, he
might face even less Congres
sional cooperation than his
brother.
• Eugene McCarthy is an ap
pealing candidate who might do
the nation great service as a
teacher in the White House. But,
Reston said, McCarthy seems al
most too civilized, too detached
from the struggle win the Pres
idency. The momentum he lost
in Indiana and Nebraska prob
ably will prevent him from get
ting the nomination.
• Richard Nixon has carried
the burden for party for many
years, and is now in a position
to call in many political "i.o.u.'s."
Middle age seems to have been
good to him, but, in Reston's

was a good possibility.
opinion, Nixon's thinking may
be too deeply rooted in the Cold
War. Under pressure, he tends
to fall back on out moded for
mulae.
• Nelson Rockefeller, as a lib
eral Republican President,
might be able to organize a more

effective coalition in Congress
than any of the other candidates.
But he is also the oldest of the
front-runners and says he has
no burning desire to occupy the
White House.
• Hubert Humphrey finds
himself in the unaccustomed po
sition of being the candidate of
the establishment. He has all
the resources, prestige and in
formation of the White House at
his disposal, along with the sup
port of big business, big labor,
the urban bosses and the lead
ers of the old Confederacy. But,
if elected he would have trouble
making a clean break with the
present administration. He
seems to be a symbol of the past
at a time when the country is
ready for a new beginning.
Each of these men has prob
able compromised his principles
at some point in his career, Res
ton said. But he expressed the
belief that the responsibilities
of the executive office would
probably improve their judge
ment.
"At th# 1 -ii'-hest level, power

is not corrupting but ennobling,"
Reston said. For this reason,
Kennedy and Nixon, who have
shared some of the power of
the Presidency, may have a
deeper understanding of its uses

As he delivered the fourth an
nual Carlos McClatchy Memo
rial Lecture, Reston was more
concerned with what he regards
as the fundamental questions
that face American than with
the personalities on the current
political scene.
The questions, Reston said,
are "What kind of people are
we?" and "What should our re
lation be to the rest of the
world?"
But the crowd that turned out
to the newly designated
executive editor of The New
York Times seemed more inter
ested in his assessment of the
potential Presidential nominees.
In a series of thumbnail
that he passed up in
his speech and road in response
to a question, Reston described
the candidates this way:

• Robert Kennedy appeals to
the young and the minor
ities, but he has frightened the
middle aged and the middle
class — the voters who usually
decide an election. He is a pas
sionate, ambitious young man
who, in Reston's opinion, would
be a very effective President.
But he can be classified as the
"prosecutor type," a kind of
person that the American voter
usually avoids. If elected, he
might face even less Congres
sional cooperation than his
brother.
• Eugene McCarthy is an ap
pealing candidate who might do
the nation great service as a
teacher in the White House. But,
Reston said, McCarthy seems al
most too civilized, too detached
from the struggle win the Pres
idency. The momentum he lost
in Indiana and Nebraska prob
ably will prevent him from get
ting the nomination.
• Richard Nixon has carried
the burden for party for many
years, and is now in a position
to call in many political "i.o.u.'s."
Middle age seems to have been
good to him, but, in Reston's

was a good possibility.
opinion, Nixon's thinking may
be too deeply rooted in the Cold
War. Under pressure, he tends
to fall back on out moded for
mulae.
• Nelson Rockefeller, as a lib
eral Republican President,
might be able to organize a more

effective coalition in Congress
than any of the other candidates.
But he is also the oldest of the
front-runners and says he has
no burning desire to occupy the
White House.
• Hubert Humphrey finds
himself in the unaccustomed po
sition of being the candidate of
the establishment. He has all
the resources, prestige and in
formation of the White House at
his disposal, along with the sup
port of big business, big labor,
the urban bosses and the lead
ers of the old Confederacy. But,
if elected he would have trouble
making a clean break with the
present administration. He
seems to be a symbol of the past
at a time when the country is
ready for a new beginning.
Each of these men has prob
able compromised his principles
at some point in his career, Res
ton said. But he expressed the
belief that the responsibilities
of the executive office would
probably improve their judge
ment.
"At th# 1 -ii'-hest level, power

is not corrupting but ennobling,"
Reston said. For this reason,
Kennedy and Nixon, who have
shared some of the power of
the Presidency, may have a
deeper understanding of its uses
and its weight than the other
contenders.
A leading spokesman of Ameri
can journalism, "James Keston,
advised a Stanford audience last
night to "wait, see, watch, and
forget stereotypes" before de
ciding who to support in the
1968 Presidential contest.
But Reston shocked the audi
ence which packed Memorial
Auditorium by saying that his
bet was on a Humphrey-Ken
nedy ticket for the Democratic
party.
He pictures Johnson and Ken
nedy meeting in some Chicago
hotel room after the fourth bal
lot, Reston said. And the Presi

dent will ask Kennedy to "do
for Hubert what I did for your
brother in 1960," he said.
This prediction brought some
laughter from the audience, but
Reston assured them he was
serious. Johnson's argument
that Kennedy must consider na
tional unity would be a com
pelling one, he said.
