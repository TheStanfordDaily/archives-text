# 'Aggressive' McCarthy Speech Arouses Cow Palace Crowd
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
In New Hampshire, Eugene
McCarthy avoided crowds, ent
ering auditoriums via back doors
when he spoke. Wednesday night
at the Cow Palace, Senator Mc-
Carthy walked down the middle
aisle joshed by admiring students
who pushed and scrambled to
touch the man or his clothing.
McCarthy's entrance set the
tone for his speech — aggressive.
He immediately attacked Senator
Kennedy saying "Kennedy didn't
want to divide the party in Jan
uary. I thought the time had
come to divide the party and
raise issues tfle party should
have been raising."
McCarthy continued, "If we
are going to ask everyone in the
country to risk something for his
country why should the politi
cians not run some risks also."
Interrupted often by loud ap
plause from more than 7000
people in the Cow Palace, Mc-
Carthy pursued his criticisms
of Kennedy. He said, "Senator
Kennedy is looking for a new
image. He doesn't want to be
John Kennedy and he doesn't
want to be Robert Kennedy."
In response to reports that he
might support Vice President
Humphrey at the convention in
August, McCarthy repeated past
promises that he "will not offer
any deals or accept any deals,
but will carry my fight to the
finish."
McCarthy did not spare Hum
phrey as he sarcastically joked
about the "politics of happiness."
The Senator said, "Humphrey
has a conception of an homogen
ized America. He pretends there
are no differences and that we're
all happy together."
"Kennedy," McCarthy said,
"has no organic concept of Amer

ica. He has 26 different commit
tees for 26 different groups in the
mrntry. I had no there were
than many different kinds of
America."
McCarthy said, "I'm for a unity
of understanding, a unity of pur
pose, and a unity of accomplish
ment."
In a general assault on
American foreign policy, Mc-
Carthy called the "policy of
containment now known as
counter • Insurrgency," dan
gerous and obsolete. He traced
its roots back to John Foster
Dulles and questioned the wis
dom Of the Keiuiedy Admini
stration in implementing and
expanding the policy.

McCarthy used this as a lever
to further criticize Robert Ken
n"dy, whom he said thinks with
in old line policies and old poli
tics.
McCarthy again called for the
removal of Dean Rusk and re
newed his public skepticism
about performances of the CIA
and the FBI. He said the United
States should have recognized
Communist China years ago, and
said Rusk's refusal to deal with
the Chinese was "carrying some
thing too far."
McCarthy concluded by saying,
"I will prove to the world that
the politics of courage, commit
ment and reason can be the poli
tics of success."
