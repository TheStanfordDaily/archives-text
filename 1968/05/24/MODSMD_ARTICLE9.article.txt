## Arrest Welfare Protestors 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — A
welfare protest on Capitol Hill
produced the first arrests of the
Poor People's Campaign Thurs
day.
Eighteen demonstrators sing
ing outside a House office build
ing were jailed on charges of
unlawful assembly, a misde
meanor.
Only the intervention of a con
gressman and a promise by the
Rev. Jesse Jackson, a leader of
the campaign, that other dem
onstrators would leave quietly
prevented the arrest of perhaps
50 more.
The arrests and a hint by
Jackson that Negro leaders are
looking beyond the current cam
paign to an economic boycott in
the nation's major cities
marked a day of tension in the
drive by the poor for jobs and
income.
Congressional leaders an
nounced the formation of an un
official bipartisan group of 30
senators and representatives to
provide "a line of communica
tion" between Congress and the
Poor People's Campaign.
• Talks Drag On
PARIS (AP> — The American
delegation now believes the Par
is talks seeking a road to peace
in Vietnam can go on for a long
time, but U.S. Ambassador W.

Averell Harriman said Thurs
day the possibility of failure
cannot be ruled out.
But the outlook was discour
aging for Americans. The meet
ing with the North Vietnamese
seemed settling into the famil
iar and frustrating pattern of
past negotiations of the West
with the Communists.
Meanwhile in Moscow, the So
viet Union was reported to have
indicated it would rather have
North Vietnam meet U.S. de
mands for military restraint
thin '-eo the Paris peace talk-;
collapse.
The impression of the Soviet
attitude was understood to have
been giinei b" P»rit'~h Fo*"->i~n
Secretary Michael Stewart in
talks with Soviet Foreign Minis
ter Andrei A. Gromyko.
• Fighting Continues
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
d nt Johnson said Thursday
that while America still hopes
for peace through the Paris ne
gotiations, "We shall not be
defeated on the battlefield while
the talks go on."

people to brace for a protracted
period of hard fighting-while
talking was delivered by Secre
tary of Defense Clark M. Clif
ford in asking a Senate appro
nations subcommittee for near

ly $80 billion for the U.S. armed
services next year.
In news from Saigon, a near
record number of American
troops were reported killed last
week, and plane losses over
North Vietnam also are mount
ing.

OAKLAND (AP) — Black
Panther chairman Bobby Seale,
31, was placed on three years'
probation Thursday for carrying
a loaded shotgun at the Oak
land Hall of Justice.
Superior Court Judge Red
mond Staats told the leader of
the militant Negro organization

associate with anyone who car
ried a weapon.
Seale, who was among the
armed Black Panthers who dis
rupted the state Assembly at
Sacramento a year ago, was in
structed not to associate with
known criminals.
Although he assured the judge
he accepted and understood the
probation terms, Seale said out

for assemblyman from the 17th
District he had to "associate
with all types of people, as is
my constitutional right."
