# Tuition Raise To $2145 Announced For '69-'70

### MARGIE WOLF 
Tuition will climb to $2145 in
1969-70, according to Kenneth
Cuthbertson, vice president for
finance.
Tuition for 1968-69 is set at
$1920, a $150 raise over this year.
Cuthbertson cites rising cost
per student and study of com
parable schools' rates as im
portant factors in the decision.
Financial aids must "keep
pace" with Stanford's increased
cost, Cuthbertson noted. "We are
particularly sensitive that a cer
tain group gets caught, and we
will handle resulting financial aid
problems," he said.
"We try desperately to aid
as much as necessary all who
are admitted," Cuthbertson ex
plained, adding the goal was
"within a handful of fresh
men" of being reached.

He stated special concern for
those already in school. "We'll
only raise tuition to the extent
we can keep those already en
rolled here," he said.
Ten years ago scholarships,
fellowships and loans comprised
21 per cent of total tuition and
fees collected. Last year finan
cial aids paid for 48 per cent.
The switch from bi-annual
to yearly consideration of tui
tion raises was made a year
ago by the trustees. "It came
to the point where we felt
there was no point of being
$150 to $250 behind competing
institutions" in tuition scales,
he said.
Cuthbertson drew the compar
ison with "a group of schools we
feel compartable in" including
Cal Tech, Cornell, University of
Chicago. Harvard, MIT, Pen
nsylvania, Princeton, and Yale.
"We estimate by '70-'7l their
tuitions will average $2400," he
predicted.
Expenditures at Stanford are
predicted for ten years in ad
vance on two levels — minimum,
"To prevent erosion of quality of
the University," and desirable,
"to make improvements at well
managed significant rates."
The cost per student is rising,
Cuthbertson said, to an "un
reachable ideal" amount. There
can always be an "added re
sult" from spending more money

on educating some of the "best
minds in the country," he said.
The eventual $1.2 million
university commitment In re
sponse to the Black Student
Union demands for more con
centration on minority groups
represents a "speeding up" of
planned objectives, Cuthbert
son explained.
Alot of the money that will
be spent in '69-'7O would have
been spread through the next
few years," Cuthbertson said.
He could foresee a resulting de
ficit which could range between
$1 and $2 million dollars in the
next few years. Federal or civil
rights group funds could con
ceivably reduce the deficit, but
these resources have not become
avai'able yet.
Costs of the Vietnam war
make federal aid unpredictable,
he said, and the effect of new
draft laws on the universities is
still unknown.
The deficit in ten years is now
snt at $4.5 million on the "mini
mum" level and $20 million on
the "desirable" plane.
Predictions have "always look
ed something like this," Cuth
bertson said, "and usually in
come has been greater than we
cou'd forsee."
"When you do this forecast
ing job you can't see where the
income is coming from," Cuth
bertson explained. "We don't
think rates will go up indefi

netly as fast as they do in the
next few years," he predicted,
but he explained that this de
pends on the amount of gifts.
Gifts this year from Stan
ford's throe major sources, foun
dations, bequests, and businesses
and associations are running a
head of estimates. Last year
foundations donated $7.1 million,
businesses and associations $3.3
million, and bequests furnished
$6.5 million.
Income has begun an upward
trend, said Cuthbertson, after
hovering around $22 million for
three years after the PACE gift
campaign.
Since the average level of
personal income in the country
has been rising faster than an

ticipated and a big portion of
the gift money received was des
ignated for scholarships and
loans, tuition is being set higher
than anticipated in long range
plans, Cuthbertson said.
Tuition now foots 15 per cent
of total university expenditures,
including research and teaching
and maintenance functions. This
level will not change in the next
few years, and will only increase
to 16 or 17 per cent in ten years.
In 1958 tuition carried 25 per
ccnt of the burden.
"More universities are wor

ried now" about their sources
of income, Cuthbertson said.
"We have quadrupled expen
ditures in the last ten years,
and they continue to increase
on a percentage basis. For ex
ample, the library costs about
7 per cent more every year.
We can't afford to be as con
fident — there are some real
unknowns," he said.
Cuthbertson speculates that
the solution to universities' fin
ancial problems might eventual
ly be found in spreading out
costs to the student over a period
after graduation.
