## McCarthy Affirms Freedom Of Speech 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
In this year of 1968 each of
us must take a critical look at
our country and reaffirm our
commitment to the basic values
and rights upon which America
was built.
Students have rights and lib
erties, the most important of
which are freedom of inquiry
and expression. I am opposed to
proposed amendments to legis
lation before Congress regard
ing Federal Loan Programs.
These programs must not be
used as a means of stifling dis
sent or as an instrument of
punishment for unpopular opin
ions or activities.
Moreover, no person or group
—including any university ad
ministration—can be the judge
of a controversy in which that
person or group is one of the
contending parties. The right to
an independent judge is an in
herent part of our entire struc
ture of law and justice.
We cannot and must not
waver in our dedication and de
termination to protect the rights
of all people at all times. As I
entered the presidential cam
paign to give voice to people
whose views were not being
heard, so I will continue to cam
paign for the rights of all
people to express their views
without fear of intimidation or
reprisal.

Carthy by the Stanford Commit
tee for McCarthy.)
Switch To McCarthy
Would Be Pragmatic
Editor, The Daily:
"Peace is war, love is hate, a
vote for Gene is a vote for Hu
bert."
We have, since Mr. Novak's
famous letter, heard it much re
peated that a vote for McCarthy
may be a vote for Humphrey. It
seems to me that one can by the
very same kind of pragmatic
reasoning come to conclude that
a vote for Kennedy is a vote
for Humphrey.
Which of the three candidates
is most likely to be acceptable
to delegates of the other two?
Obviously, McCarthy. Kennedy
supporters have stressed the
Congressional Quarterly report
on McCarthy which shows him
to be less controversial than
Bobby while, of course, Kennedy
himself has urged McCarthy to
join him because they hold es
sentially the same views. The
problem is beating Humphrey,
not each other; and to beat
Humphrey one of the two is go
ing to have to win delegates
from the Humphrey camp with
out causing the other's delegates
to move to Humphrey.
McCarthy, with the support of

Kennedy delegates, might have
the power as well as the personal
appeal to induce flexible Humph
rey supporters like Governor
Brown into his camp. Kennedy,
with those who might support
him if McCarthy should release
his delegates, would still prob
ably find himself short and with
no bargaining position to rem
edy this deficiency. Very simply,
it stands to reason (as Kennedy
supporters reason), that if Mc-
Carthy delegates could go either
way, Humphrey and Kennedy
delegates could by the same path
come to him.
Of course, (ignoring Mr. Res
ton's preposterous suggestion),
Kennedy would never swing his
support to Humphrey; so Mc-
Carthy stands as the only can
didate who can unify the party
and still enact essentially the
same policies that Kennedy sup
ports.
Finally, Kennedy strategists,
consider what the effect would
be now before the primary if the
active McCarthy supporters were
to shift to Kennedy. Who would
be left to win over those who
like McCarthy but would sup
port Humphrey before Kennedy?
Kennedy needs these people in
the McCarthy fold now if he is
going to have a chance against
Humphrey at the convention. In
fact, the pragmatic thing for
any good Kennedy supporter to
do would be to switch to Mc-
Carthy, now.

Vote For Kennedy Is
A Vote For Humphrey
Editor, The Daily:
I would very much like to let
supporters of Kennedy know
that a vote for Kennedy is a
vote for Humphrey. If all those
who support Kennedy and who
are telling those who support
McCarthy that they must vote
for Kennedy if Humphrey is to
be stopped — if all those people
were to vote for McCarthy, then
McCarthy would win the pri
mary and Humphrey would be
stopped. And if they don't vote
for McCarthy, then Humphrey
will win — so a vote for Ken
nedy is a vote for Humphrey.
Or rather, I want to tell Mc-
Carthy supporters not to be
taken in by the self-fulfilling
prophecy of Kennedy supporters.
And best, I want to tell support
ers of both these candidates to
leave each other alone and work
for a goal they both should
share: to make the Lynch dele
gation — which is a stan '-in
for Humphrey — come in third.
Nothing will improve the
cause of peace or promise some
alleviation of the racial situa
tion more than that outcome.

not each other; and to beat
Humphrey one of the two is go
ing to have to win delegates
from the Humphrey camp with
out causing the other's delegates
to move to Humphrey.
McCarthy, with the support of

Kennedy delegates, might have
the power as well as the personal
appeal to induce flexible Humph
rey supporters like Governor
Brown into his camp. Kennedy,
with those who might support
him if McCarthy should release
his delegates, would still prob
ably find himself short and with
no bargaining position to rem
edy this deficiency. Very simply,
it stands to reason (as Kennedy
supporters reason), that if Mc-
Carthy delegates could go either
way, Humphrey and Kennedy
delegates could by the same path
come to him.
Of course, (ignoring Mr. Res
ton's preposterous suggestion),
Kennedy would never swing his
support to Humphrey; so Mc-
Carthy stands as the only can
didate who can unify the party
and still enact essentially the
same policies that Kennedy sup
ports.
Finally, Kennedy strategists,
consider what the effect would
be now before the primary if the
active McCarthy supporters were
to shift to Kennedy. Who would
be left to win over those who
like McCarthy but would sup
port Humphrey before Kennedy?
Kennedy needs these people in
the McCarthy fold now if he is
going to have a chance against
Humphrey at the convention. In
fact, the pragmatic thing for
any good Kennedy supporter to
do would be to switch to Mc-
Carthy, now.

Vote For Kennedy Is
A Vote For Humphrey
Editor, The Daily:
I would very much like to let
supporters of Kennedy know
that a vote for Kennedy is a
vote for Humphrey. If all those
who support Kennedy and who
are telling those who support
McCarthy that they must vote
for Kennedy if Humphrey is to
be stopped — if all those people
were to vote for McCarthy, then
McCarthy would win the pri
mary and Humphrey would be
stopped. And if they don't vote
for McCarthy, then Humphrey
will win — so a vote for Ken
nedy is a vote for Humphrey.
Or rather, I want to tell Mc-
Carthy supporters not to be
taken in by the self-fulfilling
prophecy of Kennedy supporters.
And best, I want to tell support
ers of both these candidates to
leave each other alone and work
for a goal they both should
share: to make the Lynch dele
gation — which is a stan '-in
for Humphrey — come in third.
Nothing will improve the
cause of peace or promise some
alleviation of the racial situa
tion more than that outcome.

In this year of 1968 each of
us must take a critical look at
our country and reaffirm our
commitment to the basic values

was built.
Students have rights and lib

These programs must not be

Moreover, no person or group

We cannot and must not

In this year of 1968 each of
us must take a critical look at
our country and reaffirm our
commitment to the basic values
and rights upon which America
was built.
Students have rights and lib
erties, the most important of
which are freedom of inquiry
and expression. I am opposed to
proposed amendments to legis
lation before Congress regard
ing Federal Loan Programs.
These programs must not be
used as a means of stifling dis
sent or as an instrument of
punishment for unpopular opin
ions or activities.
Moreover, no person or group
—including any university ad
ministration—can be the judge
of a controversy in which that
person or group is one of the
contending parties. The right to
an independent judge is an in
herent part of our entire struc
ture of law and justice.
We cannot and must not
waver in our dedication and de
termination to protect the rights
of all people at all times. As I
entered the presidential cam
paign to give voice to people
whose views were not being
heard, so I will continue to cam
paign for the rights of all
people to express their views
without fear of intimidation or
reprisal.

Switch To McCarthy
Would Be Pragmatic
Editor, The Daily:
"Peace is war, love is hate, a
vote for Gene is a vote for Hu
bert."
We have, since Mr. Novak's
famous letter, heard it much re
peated that a vote for McCarthy
may be a vote for Humphrey. It
seems to me that one can by the
very same kind of pragmatic
reasoning come to conclude that
a vote for Kennedy is a vote
for Humphrey.
Which of the three candidates
is most likely to be acceptable
to delegates of the other two?
Obviously, McCarthy. Kennedy
supporters have stressed the
Congressional Quarterly report
on McCarthy which shows him
to be less controversial than
Bobby while, of course, Kennedy
himself has urged McCarthy to
join him because they hold es
sentially the same views. The
problem is beating Humphrey,
not each other; and to beat
Humphrey one of the two is go
ing to have to win delegates
from the Humphrey camp with
out causing the other's delegates
to move to Humphrey.
McCarthy, with the support of

Kennedy delegates, might have
the power as well as the personal
appeal to induce flexible Humph
rey supporters like Governor
Brown into his camp. Kennedy,
with those who might support
him if McCarthy should release
his delegates, would still prob
ably find himself short and with
no bargaining position to rem
edy this deficiency. Very simply,
it stands to reason (as Kennedy
supporters reason), that if Mc-
Carthy delegates could go either
way, Humphrey and Kennedy
delegates could by the same path
come to him.
Of course, (ignoring Mr. Res
ton's preposterous suggestion),
Kennedy would never swing his
support to Humphrey; so Mc-
Carthy stands as the only can
didate who can unify the party
and still enact essentially the
same policies that Kennedy sup
ports.
Finally, Kennedy strategists,
consider what the effect would
be now before the primary if the
active McCarthy supporters were
to shift to Kennedy. Who would
be left to win over those who
like McCarthy but would sup
port Humphrey before Kennedy?
Kennedy needs these people in
the McCarthy fold now if he is
going to have a chance against
Humphrey at the convention. In
fact, the pragmatic thing for
any good Kennedy supporter to
do would be to switch to Mc-
Carthy, now.

Vote For Kennedy Is
A Vote For Humphrey
Editor, The Daily:
I would very much like to let
supporters of Kennedy know
that a vote for Kennedy is a
vote for Humphrey. If all those
who support Kennedy and who
are telling those who support
McCarthy that they must vote
for Kennedy if Humphrey is to
be stopped — if all those people
were to vote for McCarthy, then
McCarthy would win the pri
mary and Humphrey would be
stopped. And if they don't vote
for McCarthy, then Humphrey
will win — so a vote for Ken
nedy is a vote for Humphrey.
Or rather, I want to tell Mc-
Carthy supporters not to be
taken in by the self-fulfilling
prophecy of Kennedy supporters.
And best, I want to tell support
ers of both these candidates to
leave each other alone and work
for a goal they both should
share: to make the Lynch dele
gation — which is a stan '-in
for Humphrey — come in third.
Nothing will improve the
cause of peace or promise some
alleviation of the racial situa
tion more than that outcome.
