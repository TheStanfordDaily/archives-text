# Peter, Paul And Mary
## Moral Issues Concern Folk Group 
### BARBARA RITZ 
(Editor's Note: Peter, Paul,
and Mary came to Stanford Sat
urday to donate their time for
the McCarthy campaign. Before
and after Saturday's concert in
Frost Amphitheater, the DAILY
interviewed the group.)
DAILY: Why did you support
McCarthy as opposed to other
candidates with a peace plat
form?
Paul: There are so many ways
to answer that question and yet
the most obvious way is there

was only one peace candidate
when I decided that McCarthy
was the man.
He was the first and the
only. Then suddenly everyone
became a peace candidate. So,
my commitment was not only
to the moral issue, but to the
man who supported the moral
issues.
Peter: McCarthy has put him
self on the line in such a way
that has appeared to be political
suicide. He refuses to be a dema
gogue, although he may lose the
election because of this.

McCarthy has made us care.
We've learned that the election
is not the important issue. We
all have to be really concerned
with the other issues that are
at stake.
There have been a lot of things
said against Kennedy. I don't
believe in this name-calling mere
ly for the sak > of being against
candidate.
Kennedy knows how to give
political speeches. He's an effec
tive politician and some people
have been against him because

of this. I don't think that you
have to divide the world into
good guys and bad guys.
DAILY: How much tim 1 has
your group contributed to the
McCarthy campaign?
Mary: We've done different
kinds of things. We've composed
and recorded a song for him.
plus the individ. al things that
w? have done. Today's concert
is our third rally.
DAILY: How do you face the
political realities of the situation,
i.e., McCarthy may have to at
some point drop out or throw
his support to another candi
date?
Mary: I prefer to work under
the premise initially that he has
a chance. When it is proven to
me that he doesn't have a chance,
then I have to say what have I
gained.
The concept that I think is
really valid is by maximum sup
port of an ethical human being,
I will have somebody involved
in politics who has more power.
The worst we can come out
with is someone who must be
listened to within the Demo
cratic party because lie has
shown great power.
That McCarthy will not have
gotten the ultimate power, that
is a shame, but I will not have
lost anything. I will only have
gained.
DAILY: If as a group you
would throw your support to an
other candidate, who would you
consider?
Paul: There is only one can
didate conceivably that the group
would in-toto endorse, and you'll
never guess what that is be
cause he isn't even in the run
ning.
Mary: John Lindsay.
DAILY: Not Rockefeller?
Mary: That Rockefeller could
even say the name Reagan with
his name just shot him out of
the picture for me. I don't see
any young people voting for Rea
gan, especially not in California.
DAILY: Do you feel that per
formers should wield as much
influence as they do or can do?
How do you feel about perfor
mers, especially people in show
business, being in such great de
mand by candidates for political
office?

Mary: It's a many lev 1 kind
of feeling. On one hand, the role
of the artist in politics is a long,
documented thin?. Some coun
tries hnve accepted it with mor 1
grace, such as France. Andrew
Moreau, Sartiv. those men have
great effect politically, and were
primari'y artists.
In this country the rol? of
the artist has not so de
fined in the 'ast twenty years,
a'though Mark Twain certainly
was a great social commentary.
Upton Sinclair, as a writ t. had
great effect on the social as
pects and so did London.
The age of the proletariat
writer had great effect on the
112 cling, but it's not a new
role. It's only a new role in the
sense that you see us on tele
vision.
You now see artists who nor
mally were not able to be ar
ticulate about po'itics in the old
sense, because in the old sense,
only the writers got a chance
to articu'ate.
Mass media now has allowed
artists, other kinds of artists,
to be articulate. In the gener
ation before us the artist was
systematically controlled, sup
ressed, jailed, blacklisted, and
rendered as inarticulate as pos
sible.
Whereas, today's artist refuses
to let this happen. The concept
of awareness bocause of mass
media has allowed this. People
are not so fast to make mar
tyrs.
DAILY: Do you see a tie be
tween artists, particularly show
business people, tending toward
the liberal?
Mary: I think that most art
ists are very sensitive to suffer
ing. They are very sensitive to
the need to express one's inner
desires, because after all, that's
their bag.
Conservatism in this coun
try has always in the past rep
resented maintaining the sta
tus quo, not admitting to prob
lems, and any artist, as well
as any scientist will tell you
that one of the objects of liv
ing is to change, to grow, to
develop, to create. It's this
change that is progressive and
always hand-in-hand with the
liberal aspects of any society.

How do you feel about perfor
mers, especially people in show
business, being in such great de
mand by candidates for political
office?

Mary: It's a many lev 1 kind
of feeling. On one hand, the role
of the artist in politics is a long,
documented thin?. Some coun
tries hnve accepted it with mor 1
grace, such as France. Andrew
Moreau, Sartiv. those men have
great effect politically, and were
primari'y artists.
In this country the rol? of
the artist has not so de
fined in the 'ast twenty years,
a'though Mark Twain certainly
was a great social commentary.
Upton Sinclair, as a writ t. had
great effect on the social as
pects and so did London.
The age of the proletariat
writer had great effect on the
112 cling, but it's not a new
role. It's only a new role in the
sense that you see us on tele
vision.
You now see artists who nor
mally were not able to be ar
ticulate about po'itics in the old
sense, because in the old sense,
only the writers got a chance
to articu'ate.
Mass media now has allowed
artists, other kinds of artists,
to be articulate. In the gener
ation before us the artist was
systematically controlled, sup
ressed, jailed, blacklisted, and
rendered as inarticulate as pos
sible.
Whereas, today's artist refuses
to let this happen. The concept
of awareness bocause of mass
media has allowed this. People
are not so fast to make mar
tyrs.
DAILY: Do you see a tie be
tween artists, particularly show
business people, tending toward
the liberal?
Mary: I think that most art
ists are very sensitive to suffer
ing. They are very sensitive to
the need to express one's inner
desires, because after all, that's
their bag.
Conservatism in this coun
try has always in the past rep
resented maintaining the sta
tus quo, not admitting to prob
lems, and any artist, as well
as any scientist will tell you
that one of the objects of liv
ing is to change, to grow, to
develop, to create. It's this
change that is progressive and
always hand-in-hand with the
liberal aspects of any society.
(Editor's Note: Peter, Paul,
and Mary came to Stanford Sat
urday to donate their time for
the McCarthy campaign. Before
and after Saturday's concert in
Frost Amphitheater, the DAILY
interviewed the group.)
DAILY: Why did you support
McCarthy as opposed to other
candidates with a peace plat
form?
Paul: There are so many ways
to answer that question and yet
the most obvious way is there

was only one peace candidate
when I decided that McCarthy
was the man.
He was the first and the
only. Then suddenly everyone
became a peace candidate. So,
my commitment was not only
to the moral issue, but to the
man who supported the moral
issues.
Peter: McCarthy has put him
self on the line in such a way
that has appeared to be political
suicide. He refuses to be a dema
gogue, although he may lose the
election because of this.

McCarthy has made us care.
We've learned that the election
is not the important issue. We
all have to be really concerned
with the other issues that are
at stake.
There have been a lot of things
said against Kennedy. I don't
believe in this name-calling mere
ly for the sak > of being against
candidate.
Kennedy knows how to give
political speeches. He's an effec
tive politician and some people
have been against him because

of this. I don't think that you
have to divide the world into
good guys and bad guys.
DAILY: How much tim 1 has
your group contributed to the
McCarthy campaign?
Mary: We've done different
kinds of things. We've composed
and recorded a song for him.
plus the individ. al things that
w? have done. Today's concert
is our third rally.
DAILY: How do you face the
political realities of the situation,
i.e., McCarthy may have to at
some point drop out or throw
his support to another candi
date?
Mary: I prefer to work under
the premise initially that he has
a chance. When it is proven to
me that he doesn't have a chance,
then I have to say what have I
gained.
The concept that I think is
really valid is by maximum sup
port of an ethical human being,
I will have somebody involved
in politics who has more power.
The worst we can come out
with is someone who must be
listened to within the Demo
cratic party because lie has
shown great power.
That McCarthy will not have
gotten the ultimate power, that
is a shame, but I will not have
lost anything. I will only have
gained.
DAILY: If as a group you
would throw your support to an
other candidate, who would you
consider?
Paul: There is only one can
didate conceivably that the group
would in-toto endorse, and you'll
never guess what that is be
cause he isn't even in the run
ning.
Mary: John Lindsay.
DAILY: Not Rockefeller?
Mary: That Rockefeller could
even say the name Reagan with
his name just shot him out of
the picture for me. I don't see
any young people voting for Rea
gan, especially not in California.

is not the important issue. We
all have to be really concerned
with the other issues that are
at stake.
There have been a lot of things
said against Kennedy. I don't
believe in this name-calling mere
ly for the sak > of being against
candidate.
Kennedy knows how to give
political speeches. He's an effec
tive politician and some people
have been against him because

of this. I don't think that you
have to divide the world into
good guys and bad guys.
DAILY: How much tim 1 has
your group contributed to the
McCarthy campaign?
Mary: We've done different
kinds of things. We've composed
and recorded a song for him.
plus the individ. al things that
w? have done. Today's concert
is our third rally.
DAILY: How do you face the
political realities of the situation,
i.e., McCarthy may have to at
some point drop out or throw
his support to another candi
date?
Mary: I prefer to work under
the premise initially that he has
a chance. When it is proven to
me that he doesn't have a chance,
then I have to say what have I
gained.
The concept that I think is
really valid is by maximum sup
port of an ethical human being,
I will have somebody involved
in politics who has more power.
The worst we can come out
with is someone who must be
listened to within the Demo
cratic party because lie has
shown great power.
That McCarthy will not have
gotten the ultimate power, that
is a shame, but I will not have
lost anything. I will only have
gained.
DAILY: If as a group you
would throw your support to an
other candidate, who would you
consider?
Paul: There is only one can
didate conceivably that the group
would in-toto endorse, and you'll
never guess what that is be
cause he isn't even in the run
ning.
Mary: John Lindsay.
DAILY: Not Rockefeller?
Mary: That Rockefeller could
even say the name Reagan with
his name just shot him out of
the picture for me. I don't see
any young people voting for Rea
gan, especially not in California.
DAILY: Do you feel that per
formers should wield as much
influence as they do or can do?
How do you feel about perfor
mers, especially people in show
business, being in such great de
mand by candidates for political
office?

Mary: It's a many lev 1 kind
of feeling. On one hand, the role
of the artist in politics is a long,
documented thin?. Some coun
tries hnve accepted it with mor 1
grace, such as France. Andrew
Moreau, Sartiv. those men have
great effect politically, and were
primari'y artists.
In this country the rol? of
the artist has not so de
fined in the 'ast twenty years,
a'though Mark Twain certainly
was a great social commentary.
Upton Sinclair, as a writ t. had
great effect on the social as
pects and so did London.
The age of the proletariat
writer had great effect on the
112 cling, but it's not a new
role. It's only a new role in the
sense that you see us on tele
vision.
You now see artists who nor
mally were not able to be ar
ticulate about po'itics in the old
sense, because in the old sense,
only the writers got a chance
to articu'ate.
Mass media now has allowed
artists, other kinds of artists,
to be articulate. In the gener
ation before us the artist was
systematically controlled, sup
ressed, jailed, blacklisted, and
rendered as inarticulate as pos
sible.
Whereas, today's artist refuses
to let this happen. The concept
of awareness bocause of mass
media has allowed this. People
are not so fast to make mar
tyrs.
DAILY: Do you see a tie be
tween artists, particularly show
business people, tending toward
the liberal?
Mary: I think that most art
ists are very sensitive to suffer
ing. They are very sensitive to
the need to express one's inner
desires, because after all, that's
their bag.
Conservatism in this coun
try has always in the past rep
resented maintaining the sta
tus quo, not admitting to prob
lems, and any artist, as well
as any scientist will tell you
that one of the objects of liv
ing is to change, to grow, to
develop, to create. It's this
change that is progressive and
always hand-in-hand with the
liberal aspects of any society.
(Editor's Note: Peter, Paul,
and Mary came to Stanford Sat
urday to donate their time for
the McCarthy campaign. Before
and after Saturday's concert in
Frost Amphitheater, the DAILY
interviewed the group.)
DAILY: Why did you support
McCarthy as opposed to other
candidates with a peace plat
form?
Paul: There are so many ways
to answer that question and yet
the most obvious way is there

was only one peace candidate
when I decided that McCarthy
was the man.
He was the first and the
only. Then suddenly everyone
became a peace candidate. So,
my commitment was not only
to the moral issue, but to the
man who supported the moral
issues.
Peter: McCarthy has put him
self on the line in such a way
that has appeared to be political
suicide. He refuses to be a dema
gogue, although he may lose the
election because of this.
