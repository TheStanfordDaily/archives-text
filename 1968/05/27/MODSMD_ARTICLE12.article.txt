## Tribe Pitching Muzzles Bears 
### GABY CAVALLI 
Rod Poteete and Harvey
Shank painted pitching master
pieces Friday and Saturday, as
Stanford swept the two-game
season finales from California
10-2 and 2-0 to wind up second
in the Pacific-8.
The two wins gave the Tribe
a 13-5 record for the year in
conference play and a 36-12-1
overall mark. League champion
USC pasted UCLA 11-2 Saturday
to close out the season three
lengths ahead of Stanford with
a 16-2 ledger.
Shank, who had a little
trouble with his control, walk
ed four, fanned four, and gave
up four hits Saturday. The
win was his tenth of the year
against three losses.
The Tribe could manage only
three hits off 6-3, 200 pound Cal
senior Hal Bond, but one of
them was a tremendous home
run over the left-center field

fence by Bob Boone in the bot
tom of the sixth.
The Bears contributed to the
Stanford cause by committing
five errors ,one more than they
made during: Friday's 10-2
nightmare. Two of these mis
cues led to the Tribe's other
run In the third inning.
Mike Schomaker drilled a
grounder to Cal third baseman
John Jackson, who threw the
ball past first-sacker John Rebo
schatis. Schomaker kept run
ning as the ball ricocheted off
the fence to the right of first
base, and he made it all the way
to third.
Bond walked the next batter
to face him, Bob Gallagher, and
when Gallagher attempted to
steal second, Bear catcher Bill
Shinen threw the ball into cen
ter field, allowing Schomaker
to score from third.
Schomaker also got a triple
off Bond, but was left stranded.
Sophomore Shinen tried to atone
for his throwing error with a
double, but his teammates could
n't bring him across.
The Indians backed Poteete's
five-hit pitching with a 15-hit
attack Friday afternoon in
Berkeley. Mark Marquess and
Chuck Williams each collected
three hits, while Ron Shotts
blasted a two-run ninth-inning
home run.
Third • baseman Boone, the
team leader in .RBl's, knocked in
three runs with a pair of singles.
Jack Hodges, making his first
start of the year in left field,
ripped two triples.
Poteete had the Bears eating
out of his hand after some diffi

culty in the opening fame, strik
ing out 12 batters and walking
but one.
The win was the fifth straight
for Poteete, and brought his sea
son record to 10-2. The lanky
junior is one of three ace Stan-

league scouts can be persuaded
to wait another year, the Tribe
mound staff will be in pretty
good shape next spring.
