## 
### 
The Stanford lacrosse team
wrapped up an unbeaten, untied
season Saturday with a leisurely
7-4 victory over the University
of California Golden Bears.
In winning the Aberchrombie
and Fitch Broken Stick trophy
for the third straight year, the
Indians finished the spring cam
paign with a 13-0 record.
Additional honors were be
stowed on the Indians over the
weekend with the announcement
of the All-West Region Lacrosse
Team, which includes all collegi

ate teams west of the Rockies.
In an unprecedented move, the
selection committee chose the
entire Stanford first defense to
the All-West first team. The
Stanford first defense includes
Bill Eakland, Wade Killefer, Den
nis McNeely, and goalie Mel El
lis.
Attackman George Muser and
midfielders Dirk Speas and Bob

on the first team, while Peter
Hovey and Stu Chi Ids were nam
ed to the second team.

Stanford was shaky in the
first few minutes against the
Bears and spotted California to
the first two goals by Gregg
Wheeler and Dale Migdal. Ben
Smith rifled in a shot from mid
field to make the score 2-1, but
Cal's Carl Massero scored in the
waning minutes of the first pe
riod to preserve the two-point
spread.
The next time the Bears scor
ed was with one minute left in
the game, as the Indians took

complete control. The Stanford
scoring was equitably parcelled
out as no one scored twice. Mark
Teeter scored the second Red
goal and Muser tied it up, to set
the stage for goals by John Han
ley, Speas, Hovey, and Hawkins.
