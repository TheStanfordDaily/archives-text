### 
"The Visit," presented by The
Company, an undergraduate
dramatic society at Stanford,
will be showing at Toyon Lounge
today and tomorrow at 8 p.m.
The play, written by Friedrich
Durrenmatt, is the macabre trag
edy of an elderly millionairess
who generourly gives her money
to turn a small economically de
presed town into a boom town.
It turns out to be vengeful plot
in which the town citizens are
constrained to commit a murder
for her.

The play has been described
as a "parable" and a "scathing
indictment of the power of
greed."
The Company's previous pro
ductions have attempted "to
bring the theatre to the people"
by including the audience in the
theatre.
Their productions have been
presented in dining rooms, court
yards, lounges, and churches.
Admission is free to the Stan
ford community.
