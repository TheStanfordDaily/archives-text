# Professors Act
## Ombudsman Board Formed 
### 
An ombudsman board to "hear
any grievance or suggestion" re
lating to academic freedom or
university government has been
established by the Stanford chap
ter of the Association of Univer
sity Professors (AAUP).
The Board will have close re
lations to a long-range study of
university governance, faculty
morale, and communication ini
tiated by the Stanford chapter
at a meeting last Monday, said
Prof. William Clebsch, executive
head of humanities and special
programs and outgoing chapter
president.
"We are concerned that re
cent events seem to Indicate
that systematic and reason
able means of registering dis
agreement at Stanford are not
adequate," Clebsch said in an
nouncing the Board's forma'
tion Friday.
Members of the AAUP do not
regard the Board as a pressure
group, but rather as an attempt
to deal with "a flaw in the
total life of higher education at
Stanford," Clebsch added.

The executive committee state
ment calls on the newly-formed
Board to "employ the good of
fices and moral force of the
AAUP to the settlement" of
grievances according to AAUP
or other higher standards.
Two recent statements by the
national organization, one on
"Government of Colleges and
Universities" and the other on
"Rights and Freedoms of Stu
dents," which was drafted in
conjunction with the National
Students Association and eight
other national education orga
nizations, provide most of AAUP
position in regards to academic
freedom and University govern
ment.
For students and faculty mem
bers who feel there is no existing
university body who will hear
their suggestions, the ombuds
man board will also serve as
a "hearing body and advocate,"
Clebsch said.
The Board is further in
structed to take not of "any
action taken by the Academic
Senate or other integral agen

cies of the University that may
relieve it of its work or its rea
son for being-."
The AAUP statement on
"Government of Colleges and
Universities" notes that "im
portant areas of action involve
at one time or another the ini
tiating capacity and decision
making participation of all the
institutional components."
The statement further says
that the expressed desire of stu
dents to participate in Univer
sity government "should be rec
ognized as a claim . . . for both
educational experience and for
involvement in (university) af
fairs."
The statement on "Rights
and Freedoms of Students"
urges that students be guar
anteed the rights of both citi
zenship and membership in the
academic community.
The statement suggests a
number of requirements of pro
cedural due process that should
be met by University judicial
committees.
The primary concern is that

the committee "include faculty
members or students, or if
regularly included or request
ed by the accused, both fac
ulty and student members."
It is further suggested that
the student "have the right to be
assisted in his defense by an ad
viser of his choice."

The Board is further in
structed to take not of "any
action taken by the Academic
Senate or other integral agen

cies of the University that may
relieve it of its work or its rea
son for being-."
The AAUP statement on
"Government of Colleges and
Universities" notes that "im
portant areas of action involve
at one time or another the ini
tiating capacity and decision
making participation of all the
institutional components."
The statement further says
that the expressed desire of stu
dents to participate in Univer
sity government "should be rec
ognized as a claim . . . for both
educational experience and for
involvement in (university) af
fairs."
The statement on "Rights
and Freedoms of Students"
urges that students be guar
anteed the rights of both citi
zenship and membership in the
academic community.
The statement suggests a
number of requirements of pro
cedural due process that should
be met by University judicial
committees.
The primary concern is that

the committee "include faculty
members or students, or if
regularly included or request
ed by the accused, both fac
ulty and student members."
It is further suggested that
the student "have the right to be
assisted in his defense by an ad
viser of his choice."
An ombudsman board to "hear
any grievance or suggestion" re
lating to academic freedom or
university government has been
established by the Stanford chap
ter of the Association of Univer
sity Professors (AAUP).
The Board will have close re
lations to a long-range study of
university governance, faculty
morale, and communication ini
tiated by the Stanford chapter
at a meeting last Monday, said
Prof. William Clebsch, executive
head of humanities and special
programs and outgoing chapter
president.
"We are concerned that re
cent events seem to Indicate
that systematic and reason
able means of registering dis
agreement at Stanford are not
adequate," Clebsch said in an
nouncing the Board's forma'
tion Friday.
Members of the AAUP do not
regard the Board as a pressure
group, but rather as an attempt
to deal with "a flaw in the
total life of higher education at
Stanford," Clebsch added.

The executive committee state
ment calls on the newly-formed
Board to "employ the good of
fices and moral force of the
AAUP to the settlement" of
grievances according to AAUP
or other higher standards.
Two recent statements by the
national organization, one on
"Government of Colleges and
Universities" and the other on
"Rights and Freedoms of Stu
dents," which was drafted in
conjunction with the National
Students Association and eight
other national education orga
nizations, provide most of AAUP
position in regards to academic
freedom and University govern
ment.
For students and faculty mem
bers who feel there is no existing
university body who will hear
their suggestions, the ombuds
man board will also serve as
a "hearing body and advocate,"
Clebsch said.
