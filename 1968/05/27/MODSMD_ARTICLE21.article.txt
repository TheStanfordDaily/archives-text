# Editor's Report
## 
### 
Four years ago I had the good
fortune of attending Shimer Col
lege, a small, private liberal arts
institution in Mt. Carroll, Illinois.
At Shimer, we had no need for a
Course Review. When a professor
wasted our time with banal 8.5.,
we walked out; when we wasted
the professor's time, e.g., by not
actively participating, he walked
out. Students took the initiative
of becoming critical agents of
their environment. This was true
"dialogue"—a word we do little
more than talk about at Stanford.

I applaud the initiative of the
few students who are working on
a comprehensive evaluation of the
Biology Department. This type of
self-analysis ought to be initiated
within each department. The re
sults could then be combined into
a complete review for the whole
community.

In passing, as students demand
from the Administration that
courses become more relevant to
"living," perhaps they would do
well to demand relevance from
their own organizations. This
would seem particularly pertinent
in the case of the A.S.S.U.
This is an organization which
spends thousands of dollars an
nually to subsidize projects (Axe
Commission, High School Day,
Pre-Reg Committee, & Cardinals
Board) which, given its limited
budget, should be financed direct
ly by the Administration.
Students should ask themselves
if they should continue to spend
$6,500 on some 100 students who
fly all over the U.S. speaking in
tournaments, or would they ra
ther spend that $6,500 for a coffee
house?
Will we continue to spend over
$4,000 to bring three foreign ex
change students (which most of
us never see) here for a year, or
would we rather see an additional
student service, such as free
birth-control pills, an ASSU Law
yer, or a Boat-House Restaurant?
To go one step further, why
do we have an ASSU Professor
ship? Why do we need an ASSU
Professor? Didn't we come here
to find (hopefully) five or six
hundred good instructors? Is it
our responsibility to provide
enough good instructors?
The University should fulfill the
responsibility which it has shirked
—just as we must fulfill the re
sponsibility we have shirked: par
ticipation. We are not prepared,
nor are we to be expected to do
what the Administration is sup
posed to be doing.
This is not a request for a
more effective, specialized in loco
parentis. It is an appeal for a
working relationship to replace
the present paternalistic hierar
chy.

I reserve judgment on the
Study of Education at Stanford

until their final report. But I
would not expect a fundamental
change in the basic structure of
the University to come from their
work. Committees gather infor
m a t i on — the Administration
makes decisions.
The Committee on General
Studies says,"The General Stud
ies Program is designed to pro
vide the liberal-education portion
of your Stanford experience."
They have yet to define "liberal
education."

The word education is derived
from the Latin educere meaning
"to bring or draw forth." This
meaning of the word makes it
plain that edi.cation is not to be
confused with a garment to be put
on whenever it is expedient or
profitable. Always the {joint of
critical concern must be the ef
fectiveness with which the indivi
dual draws forth his utmost po
tential.
Education today is commonly
defined in terms of professional
preparation and program comp'e
tion. The undergraduates too of
ten measure their educational ad
vancement in terms of fulfilled
General Studies requirements, de
gree programs, or preprofessional
training. It is only with great ef
fort that many students overcome
the smuggle between training ari<»
edu' -.ion, and overcome the re
strictive concept of education en
forced by institutional prescrip
tions. Education begins with an
awareness that neither the acqui
sition of a professional skill nor
the mere possession of a vast
knowledge by itself guarantees a
liberal education.
There is today a frightening de
gree of homogeniety and unifor
mity among students in their out
look, attitudes, and values. Stu
dents bear the imprint of the mold
of standardization which is a con
sequence of their succumbing to
institutiona' and pre
fabricated p t ugrams. Only a small
deviant group mars the homo
genization of student society (and
they are censured by the do
nothing intellectual-peasants in
a fit of anger or fear).
Students themselves bear much
of the responsibility for their con
dition for they are all too ready
to succumb to peer norms. Matu
ration and self-confidence are the

natural enemies of this group con
formity. The real peril of the
present system of "Liberal Educa
tion" is its standardization as a
component of higher education.
Programs such the the present
General Studies simply confirm
oven more the standardization ol
values and outlook that is occur
ing among students as a result of
the social pressures which operate
upon them.
The original meaning of liberal
as used in the phrase liberal ed
ucation meant "to be fitting or
worthy of free birth," free not ser
vile. In short, a liberal education
is one in which the individual stu
dent is not pressed into a mold,
but enjoys the freedom of growth
in all possible ways to the realiza
tion of his maximum potential.
For truly liberal education, there
is a need to individualize and
diversify pro, rams to meet indivi
dual student needs and desires.
Liberal education cannot be con
ceived in terms of administration
with the case of punch cards; it
must be considered in terms of
the individual's development. The
student has not become educated
say in science and its method by
the completion of seventeen or
even thirteen units of specified
sciences or the filling of four
punch card boxes, but rather when
he and a competent and interested
adviser have surveyed his appre
ciation of the scientific method
and the areas of scientific devel
opment.
The whole problem of liberal
education rests upon a conception
of education itself. An educated
person is not one who has
amassed a large number of facts
which he has at his recall, nor
is he one who has completed a
number of course units. An edu
cated person is an interested per
son. He is concerned with his so
ciety, he wonders at the phenom
ena which surround him, he is a
person consumed in giving mean
ing to his life. A liberally educa
ted person is one who has devel
oped a perspective or system, a
way of viewing life.
This system of education must
be chosen and defined by the in
dividual. The importance of deci
sion making in curriculum selec
tion cannot be over estimated.
The responsibility of the school
lies in the fostering of a free but
informed choice of courses and
programs. Not by professional re
quirements, not by institutional
programs, but by a delineation of
course choices and areas of de
sired competence can the institu
tion foster this responsibility and
decision on the part of the stu
dent.
All educated person is one who
is not satisfied with the passive
acquisition of knowledge. He
must constantly want to know
more. We truly learn only when
we want to know. This quality of
continually wanting to know is
essential to the broadening of the
base of knowledge on which the
liberal educated person tests the
values he has established by his
study and upon which he bases
the judgments at which he ar
rives by disciplined reasoning. If
liberal education has any mean
ing beyond the acquisition of
skills or the attainment of cul
tural accomplishments, it is that
the liberally educated person has
been taught to think, to relate, to
rationalize, and to evaluate on the
basis of personal and cultural
standards of conduct, discipline,
and values. Education today re
quires a delicate balance between
learning in order to live and liv
ing in order to learn. A true equi
librium is dependent upon the in
dividual's honest assessment of
his educational objectives and the
perseverance to achieve them de
spite institutional obstacles and
personal indolence.

is not satisfied with the passive
acquisition of knowledge. He
must constantly want to know
more. We truly learn only when
we want to know. This quality of
continually wanting to know is
essential to the broadening of the
base of knowledge on which the
liberal educated person tests the
values he has established by his
study and upon which he bases
the judgments at which he ar
rives by disciplined reasoning. If
liberal education has any mean
ing beyond the acquisition of
skills or the attainment of cul
tural accomplishments, it is that
the liberally educated person has
been taught to think, to relate, to
rationalize, and to evaluate on the
basis of personal and cultural
standards of conduct, discipline,
and values. Education today re
quires a delicate balance between
learning in order to live and liv

his educational objectives and the

Four years ago I had the good
fortune of attending Shimer Col

institution in Mt. Carroll, Illinois.
At Shimer, we had no need for a
Course Review. When a professor
wasted our time with banal 8.5.,
we walked out; when we wasted
the professor's time, e.g., by not
actively participating, he walked
out. Students took the initiative
of becoming critical agents of
their environment. This was true
"dialogue"—a word we do little
more than talk about at Stanford.

I applaud the initiative of the
few students who are working on
a comprehensive evaluation of the
Biology Department. This type of
self-analysis ought to be initiated
within each department. The re
sults could then be combined into
a complete review for the whole

In passing, as students demand
from the Administration that
courses become more relevant to
"living," perhaps they would do
well to demand relevance from
their own organizations. This
would seem particularly pertinent
in the case of the A.S.S.U.
This is an organization which
spends thousands of dollars an
nually to subsidize projects (Axe
Commission, High School Day,
Pre-Reg Committee, & Cardinals
Board) which, given its limited
budget, should be financed direct
ly by the Administration.
Students should ask themselves
if they should continue to spend
$6,500 on some 100 students who
fly all over the U.S. speaking in
tournaments, or would they ra
ther spend that $6,500 for a coffee
house?
Will we continue to spend over
$4,000 to bring three foreign ex
change students (which most of
us never see) here for a year, or
would we rather see an additional
student service, such as free
birth-control pills, an ASSU Law
yer, or a Boat-House Restaurant?
To go one step further, why
do we have an ASSU Professor
ship? Why do we need an ASSU
Professor? Didn't we come here
to find (hopefully) five or six
hundred good instructors? Is it
our responsibility to provide
enough good instructors?
The University should fulfill the
responsibility which it has shirked
—just as we must fulfill the re
sponsibility we have shirked: par
ticipation. We are not prepared,
nor are we to be expected to do
what the Administration is sup

The word education is derived
from the Latin educere meaning
"to bring or draw forth." This
meaning of the word makes it
plain that edi.cation is not to be
confused with a garment to be put
on whenever it is expedient or
profitable. Always the {joint of
critical concern must be the ef
fectiveness with which the indivi
dual draws forth his utmost po
tential.
Education today is commonly
defined in terms of professional
preparation and program comp'e
tion. The undergraduates too of
ten measure their educational ad
vancement in terms of fulfilled
General Studies requirements, de
gree programs, or preprofessional
training. It is only with great ef
fort that many students overcome
the smuggle between training ari<»
edu' -.ion, and overcome the re
strictive concept of education en
forced by institutional prescrip
tions. Education begins with an
awareness that neither the acqui
sition of a professional skill nor
the mere possession of a vast
knowledge by itself guarantees a
liberal education.
There is today a frightening de
gree of homogeniety and unifor
mity among students in their out
look, attitudes, and values. Stu
dents bear the imprint of the mold
of standardization which is a con
sequence of their succumbing to
institutiona' and pre
fabricated p t ugrams. Only a small
deviant group mars the homo
genization of student society (and
they are censured by the do
nothing intellectual-peasants in
a fit of anger or fear).
Students themselves bear much
of the responsibility for their con
dition for they are all too ready
to succumb to peer norms. Matu
ration and self-confidence are the

natural enemies of this group con
formity. The real peril of the
present system of "Liberal Educa
tion" is its standardization as a
component of higher education.
Programs such the the present
General Studies simply confirm
oven more the standardization ol
values and outlook that is occur
ing among students as a result of
the social pressures which operate
upon them.
The original meaning of liberal
as used in the phrase liberal ed

is one in which the individual stu
dent is not pressed into a mold,
but enjoys the freedom of growth
in all possible ways to the realiza
tion of his maximum potential.
For truly liberal education, there
is a need to individualize and
diversify pro, rams to meet indivi
dual student needs and desires.
Liberal education cannot be con
ceived in terms of administration
with the case of punch cards; it
must be considered in terms of
the individual's development. The
student has not become educated
say in science and its method by
the completion of seventeen or
even thirteen units of specified
sciences or the filling of four
punch card boxes, but rather when
he and a competent and interested
adviser have surveyed his appre
ciation of the scientific method
and the areas of scientific devel
opment.
The whole problem of liberal
education rests upon a conception
of education itself. An educated
person is not one who has
amassed a large number of facts
which he has at his recall, nor
is he one who has completed a
number of course units. An edu
cated person is an interested per
son. He is concerned with his so
ciety, he wonders at the phenom
ena which surround him, he is a
person consumed in giving mean
ing to his life. A liberally educa
ted person is one who has devel
oped a perspective or system, a
way of viewing life.
This system of education must
be chosen and defined by the in
dividual. The importance of deci
sion making in curriculum selec
tion cannot be over estimated.
The responsibility of the school
lies in the fostering of a free but
informed choice of courses and
programs. Not by professional re
quirements, not by institutional
programs, but by a delineation of
course choices and areas of de
sired competence can the institu

decision on the part of the stu

person is not one who has
amassed a large number of facts
which he has at his recall, nor
is he one who has completed a
number of course units. An edu
cated person is an interested per
son. He is concerned with his so
ciety, he wonders at the phenom
ena which surround him, he is a
person consumed in giving mean
ing to his life. A liberally educa
ted person is one who has devel
oped a perspective or system, a
way of viewing life.
This system of education must
be chosen and defined by the in
dividual. The importance of deci
sion making in curriculum selec
tion cannot be over estimated.
The responsibility of the school
lies in the fostering of a free but
informed choice of courses and
programs. Not by professional re
quirements, not by institutional
programs, but by a delineation of
course choices and areas of de
sired competence can the institu
tion foster this responsibility and
decision on the part of the stu
dent.
All educated person is one who
is not satisfied with the passive
acquisition of knowledge. He
must constantly want to know
more. We truly learn only when
we want to know. This quality of
continually wanting to know is
essential to the broadening of the
base of knowledge on which the
liberal educated person tests the
values he has established by his
study and upon which he bases
the judgments at which he ar
rives by disciplined reasoning. If
liberal education has any mean
ing beyond the acquisition of
skills or the attainment of cul
tural accomplishments, it is that
the liberally educated person has
been taught to think, to relate, to
rationalize, and to evaluate on the
basis of personal and cultural
standards of conduct, discipline,
and values. Education today re
quires a delicate balance between
learning in order to live and liv
ing in order to learn. A true equi
librium is dependent upon the in
dividual's honest assessment of
his educational objectives and the
perseverance to achieve them de
spite institutional obstacles and
personal indolence.
Four years ago I had the good
fortune of attending Shimer Col
lege, a small, private liberal arts
institution in Mt. Carroll, Illinois.
At Shimer, we had no need for a
Course Review. When a professor
wasted our time with banal 8.5.,
we walked out; when we wasted
the professor's time, e.g., by not
actively participating, he walked
out. Students took the initiative
of becoming critical agents of
their environment. This was true
"dialogue"—a word we do little
more than talk about at Stanford.

I applaud the initiative of the
few students who are working on
a comprehensive evaluation of the
Biology Department. This type of
self-analysis ought to be initiated
within each department. The re
sults could then be combined into
a complete review for the whole
community.

In passing, as students demand
from the Administration that
courses become more relevant to
"living," perhaps they would do
well to demand relevance from
their own organizations. This
would seem particularly pertinent
in the case of the A.S.S.U.
This is an organization which
spends thousands of dollars an
nually to subsidize projects (Axe
Commission, High School Day,
Pre-Reg Committee, & Cardinals
Board) which, given its limited
budget, should be financed direct
ly by the Administration.
Students should ask themselves
if they should continue to spend
$6,500 on some 100 students who
fly all over the U.S. speaking in
tournaments, or would they ra
ther spend that $6,500 for a coffee
house?
Will we continue to spend over
$4,000 to bring three foreign ex
change students (which most of
us never see) here for a year, or
would we rather see an additional
student service, such as free
birth-control pills, an ASSU Law
yer, or a Boat-House Restaurant?
To go one step further, why
do we have an ASSU Professor
ship? Why do we need an ASSU
Professor? Didn't we come here
to find (hopefully) five or six
hundred good instructors? Is it
our responsibility to provide
enough good instructors?
The University should fulfill the
responsibility which it has shirked
—just as we must fulfill the re
sponsibility we have shirked: par
ticipation. We are not prepared,
nor are we to be expected to do
what the Administration is sup
posed to be doing.

The word education is derived
from the Latin educere meaning
"to bring or draw forth." This
meaning of the word makes it
plain that edi.cation is not to be
confused with a garment to be put
on whenever it is expedient or
profitable. Always the {joint of
critical concern must be the ef
fectiveness with which the indivi
dual draws forth his utmost po
tential.
Education today is commonly
defined in terms of professional
preparation and program comp'e
tion. The undergraduates too of
ten measure their educational ad
vancement in terms of fulfilled
General Studies requirements, de
gree programs, or preprofessional
training. It is only with great ef
fort that many students overcome
the smuggle between training ari<»
edu' -.ion, and overcome the re
strictive concept of education en
forced by institutional prescrip
tions. Education begins with an
awareness that neither the acqui
sition of a professional skill nor
the mere possession of a vast
knowledge by itself guarantees a
liberal education.
There is today a frightening de
gree of homogeniety and unifor
mity among students in their out
look, attitudes, and values. Stu
dents bear the imprint of the mold
of standardization which is a con
sequence of their succumbing to
institutiona' and pre
fabricated p t ugrams. Only a small
deviant group mars the homo
genization of student society (and
they are censured by the do
nothing intellectual-peasants in
a fit of anger or fear).
Students themselves bear much
of the responsibility for their con
dition for they are all too ready
to succumb to peer norms. Matu
ration and self-confidence are the

natural enemies of this group con
formity. The real peril of the
present system of "Liberal Educa
tion" is its standardization as a
component of higher education.
Programs such the the present
General Studies simply confirm
oven more the standardization ol
values and outlook that is occur
ing among students as a result of
the social pressures which operate
upon them.
The original meaning of liberal
as used in the phrase liberal ed
ucation meant "to be fitting or
worthy of free birth," free not ser
vile. In short, a liberal education
is one in which the individual stu
dent is not pressed into a mold,
but enjoys the freedom of growth
in all possible ways to the realiza
tion of his maximum potential.
For truly liberal education, there
is a need to individualize and
diversify pro, rams to meet indivi
dual student needs and desires.
Liberal education cannot be con
ceived in terms of administration
with the case of punch cards; it
must be considered in terms of
the individual's development. The
student has not become educated
say in science and its method by
the completion of seventeen or
even thirteen units of specified
sciences or the filling of four
punch card boxes, but rather when
he and a competent and interested
adviser have surveyed his appre
ciation of the scientific method
and the areas of scientific devel

as used in the phrase liberal ed
ucation meant "to be fitting or
worthy of free birth," free not ser
vile. In short, a liberal education
is one in which the individual stu
dent is not pressed into a mold,
but enjoys the freedom of growth
in all possible ways to the realiza
tion of his maximum potential.
For truly liberal education, there
is a need to individualize and
diversify pro, rams to meet indivi
dual student needs and desires.
Liberal education cannot be con
ceived in terms of administration
with the case of punch cards; it
must be considered in terms of
the individual's development. The
student has not become educated
say in science and its method by
the completion of seventeen or
even thirteen units of specified
sciences or the filling of four
punch card boxes, but rather when
he and a competent and interested
adviser have surveyed his appre
ciation of the scientific method
and the areas of scientific devel
opment.
The whole problem of liberal
education rests upon a conception
of education itself. An educated
person is not one who has
amassed a large number of facts
which he has at his recall, nor
is he one who has completed a
number of course units. An edu
cated person is an interested per
son. He is concerned with his so
ciety, he wonders at the phenom
ena which surround him, he is a
person consumed in giving mean
ing to his life. A liberally educa
ted person is one who has devel
oped a perspective or system, a
way of viewing life.
This system of education must
be chosen and defined by the in
dividual. The importance of deci
sion making in curriculum selec
tion cannot be over estimated.
The responsibility of the school
lies in the fostering of a free but
informed choice of courses and
programs. Not by professional re
quirements, not by institutional
programs, but by a delineation of
course choices and areas of de
sired competence can the institu
tion foster this responsibility and
decision on the part of the stu
dent.
All educated person is one who
is not satisfied with the passive
acquisition of knowledge. He
must constantly want to know
more. We truly learn only when
we want to know. This quality of
continually wanting to know is
essential to the broadening of the
base of knowledge on which the
liberal educated person tests the
values he has established by his
study and upon which he bases
the judgments at which he ar
rives by disciplined reasoning. If
liberal education has any mean
ing beyond the acquisition of
skills or the attainment of cul
tural accomplishments, it is that
the liberally educated person has
been taught to think, to relate, to
rationalize, and to evaluate on the
basis of personal and cultural
standards of conduct, discipline,
and values. Education today re
quires a delicate balance between
learning in order to live and liv
ing in order to learn. A true equi
librium is dependent upon the in
dividual's honest assessment of
his educational objectives and the
perseverance to achieve them de
spite institutional obstacles and
personal indolence.
Four years ago I had the good
fortune of attending Shimer Col
lege, a small, private liberal arts
institution in Mt. Carroll, Illinois.
At Shimer, we had no need for a
Course Review. When a professor
wasted our time with banal 8.5.,
we walked out; when we wasted
the professor's time, e.g., by not
actively participating, he walked
out. Students took the initiative
of becoming critical agents of
their environment. This was true
"dialogue"—a word we do little
more than talk about at Stanford.

I applaud the initiative of the
few students who are working on
a comprehensive evaluation of the
Biology Department. This type of
self-analysis ought to be initiated
within each department. The re
sults could then be combined into
a complete review for the whole
community.

In passing, as students demand
from the Administration that
courses become more relevant to
"living," perhaps they would do
well to demand relevance from
their own organizations. This
would seem particularly pertinent
in the case of the A.S.S.U.
This is an organization which
spends thousands of dollars an
nually to subsidize projects (Axe
Commission, High School Day,
Pre-Reg Committee, & Cardinals
Board) which, given its limited
budget, should be financed direct
ly by the Administration.
Students should ask themselves
if they should continue to spend
$6,500 on some 100 students who
fly all over the U.S. speaking in
tournaments, or would they ra
ther spend that $6,500 for a coffee
house?
Will we continue to spend over
$4,000 to bring three foreign ex
change students (which most of
us never see) here for a year, or
would we rather see an additional
student service, such as free
birth-control pills, an ASSU Law
yer, or a Boat-House Restaurant?
To go one step further, why
do we have an ASSU Professor
ship? Why do we need an ASSU
Professor? Didn't we come here
to find (hopefully) five or six
hundred good instructors? Is it
our responsibility to provide
enough good instructors?
The University should fulfill the
responsibility which it has shirked
—just as we must fulfill the re
sponsibility we have shirked: par
ticipation. We are not prepared,
nor are we to be expected to do
what the Administration is sup
posed to be doing.
This is not a request for a
more effective, specialized in loco
parentis. It is an appeal for a
working relationship to replace
the present paternalistic hierar
chy.

I reserve judgment on the
Study of Education at Stanford

until their final report. But I
would not expect a fundamental
change in the basic structure of
the University to come from their
work. Committees gather infor

The Committee on General

They have yet to define "liberal

The word education is derived
from the Latin educere meaning
"to bring or draw forth." This
meaning of the word makes it
plain that edi.cation is not to be
confused with a garment to be put
on whenever it is expedient or
profitable. Always the {joint of
critical concern must be the ef
fectiveness with which the indivi
dual draws forth his utmost po
tential.
Education today is commonly
defined in terms of professional
preparation and program comp'e
tion. The undergraduates too of
ten measure their educational ad
vancement in terms of fulfilled
General Studies requirements, de
gree programs, or preprofessional
training. It is only with great ef
fort that many students overcome
the smuggle between training ari<»
edu' -.ion, and overcome the re
strictive concept of education en
forced by institutional prescrip
tions. Education begins with an
awareness that neither the acqui
sition of a professional skill nor
the mere possession of a vast
knowledge by itself guarantees a
liberal education.
There is today a frightening de
gree of homogeniety and unifor
mity among students in their out
look, attitudes, and values. Stu
dents bear the imprint of the mold
of standardization which is a con
sequence of their succumbing to
institutiona' and pre
fabricated p t ugrams. Only a small
deviant group mars the homo
genization of student society (and
they are censured by the do
nothing intellectual-peasants in
a fit of anger or fear).
Students themselves bear much
of the responsibility for their con
dition for they are all too ready
to succumb to peer norms. Matu
ration and self-confidence are the

natural enemies of this group con
formity. The real peril of the
present system of "Liberal Educa
tion" is its standardization as a
component of higher education.
Programs such the the present
General Studies simply confirm
oven more the standardization ol
values and outlook that is occur
ing among students as a result of
the social pressures which operate
upon them.
