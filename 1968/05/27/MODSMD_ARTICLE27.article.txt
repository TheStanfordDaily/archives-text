Holm: Seems condescending and
depricating toward students in
personally, he seems to
have little interest in students
(although he is quite amiable).
Despite his dynamic lectures, he
tends to repeat himself. He is
more interested in his own re
search than in teaching. His ar
rogant manner toward students
must be tempered; he is capa
ble and intelligent but his lec
tures simply have to improve.
Raven: His lectures are hard to
follow and have little to say.
Woodward: An unintelligible,
monotone, disorganized lectur
er. Reading material is not cor
related with lectures. He has
little interest in his students;
perhaps this is manifest in one
student's comment that he ap
pears at labs only to hear oral
reports. He would not be here
if he did not possess some in
tellectual qualities; he will not
remain here if he does not ac
quire some teaching and per
sonal qualities.

Oliphant: It seems that Oliphant's
main problem lies in the diffi
culty of hearing him during his
lectures. He tends to mumble,
ramble, pedantically. Test ma
terial is accented rather than
course substance. Better at
teaching small groups.
Stocker: Lectures are disconcert
ing and unintelligible.
