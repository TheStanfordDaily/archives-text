# 'Years Of Tortured Effort' Seen Ahead For Universities
## 
### 
Universities face "years of tor
tured effort to steer a construc
tive course amidst conflicting
and sometimes warring inter
ests," Stanford vice president for
finance Kenneth M. Cuthbertson
told the Alumni Assembly Sat
urday.
"Life in academe is not what
it used to be, and it isn't going
to be the same again," he said.
His mood of deep concern for
the future of higher education
in America, blended with rela
tive optimism about Stanford,
was reflected in comments by
three other panelists.
"Stanford doesn't have it
made," Cuthbertson said. 'In
spite of incredible progress in
our young life — as universi
ties go — we are a recent and
insecure arrival in the first
rank of the world's great uni
versities.
Expressing "mingled feelings
of despair and hope," Vice Pro
vost Herbert Packer said it is
"very clear" that this spring's
disturbances are "only the first
in a series of very rough times
we and other universities have to
go through."
Noting that the Stanford fac
ulty has more than tripled in

size over the past 20 years, he
said: "The sense of community
that existed in a simpler, quieter
university has somehow been at
tenuated. 112
"The concern of the faculty
for governance of the univer
sity has been sporadic, in re
sponse to crises, rather than
steady and on-going."
Stanford's new Academic Sen
ate, an elective body of 53 fac
-ulty representatives being
chosen this week .offers "con
siderable hope that a consensus
of informed faculty opinion will
develop" on major issues facing
the university.
Dean of Students Joel Smith
said he found it "obsolutely
incredible" that those who
committed civil disobedience
were willing to "defile" this
doctrine by asking — and re
ceiving — amnesty.
But this distress, "deep as
it may be," cannot be remedied
by "simplistic," authoritarian
prescriptions, Smith emphasized.
"It is not possible for us to
be rigidly authoritarian in de
fending ourselves against those
in our community who press
change upon us,' 'he commented.
It is vitally important for

the faculty to become more
personally Involved In the life
of the university, he said. Stu
dents need to recognize that
it is "unfair, and ultimately
dishonest" to pretend that the
university alone Is responsible
for their problems," Smith
said.
"The roots of discontent go
way beyond the university," he
commented. But this position, in
turn, should not be used to ra
tionalize opposition to all change
within the university.
In a somewhat similar vein,
Packer noted that universities
are not going to solve their prob
loms through the use of force.
Quoting Prof. George Stigler of
the University of Chicago, he
said the university's authority is
intellectual and moral — that
the modern university possesses
scarcely enough physical force
to restrain its emeritus (retired)
professors.
After many years of steady
growth, Cuthbertson noted, to
tal gifts of 50 leading colleges

and universities turned down in
1966 — and the trend continued
last year. Stanford dropped from
a PACE campaign peak of $38
million in 1963 to $21 million in
1966, turned up slightly in 1967
and has topped the $23 million
mark to date this year, "a good
sign admist our turmoil."
"In a time when the gen
eral public, the mass media,
and our own alumni are turn
ing against higher education —

and in the U.S. it seems like
the better the university, the
more bitter the turn off —
Stanford was never so greatly
in need of support rather than
animosity. ...
"If Harvard, Yale and Cal Tech
are worried — and they are, out
loud and publicly — then just
double it in spades for Stanford.
The really rich schools are just
now recognizing the cost crisis
with which we have been wrest
ling for the past 10 years.
University Relations Director
Lyle M. Nelson said this spring's
disturbances are "likely to be a
natural pattern in the near fu
ture" of American higher educa
tion.
Unlike most colleges, Stan
ford was "essentially on top
of key issues before they were
brought forcefully to our at
tention," he added, editing the
work done on minority admis
sions and judicial procedures
prior to demonstrations on
these topics as examples.

Universities face "years of tor
tured effort to steer a construc
tive course amidst conflicting
and sometimes warring inter
ests," Stanford vice president for
finance Kenneth M. Cuthbertson
told the Alumni Assembly Sat
urday.
"Life in academe is not what
it used to be, and it isn't going
to be the same again," he said.
His mood of deep concern for
the future of higher education
in America, blended with rela
tive optimism about Stanford,
was reflected in comments by
three other panelists.
"Stanford doesn't have it
made," Cuthbertson said. 'In
spite of incredible progress in
our young life — as universi
ties go — we are a recent and
insecure arrival in the first
rank of the world's great uni
versities.
Expressing "mingled feelings
of despair and hope," Vice Pro
vost Herbert Packer said it is
"very clear" that this spring's
disturbances are "only the first
in a series of very rough times
we and other universities have to
go through."
Noting that the Stanford fac
ulty has more than tripled in

size over the past 20 years, he
said: "The sense of community
that existed in a simpler, quieter
university has somehow been at
tenuated. 112
"The concern of the faculty
for governance of the univer
sity has been sporadic, in re
sponse to crises, rather than
steady and on-going."
Stanford's new Academic Sen
ate, an elective body of 53 fac
-ulty representatives being
chosen this week .offers "con
siderable hope that a consensus
of informed faculty opinion will
develop" on major issues facing
the university.
Dean of Students Joel Smith
said he found it "obsolutely
incredible" that those who
committed civil disobedience
were willing to "defile" this
doctrine by asking — and re
ceiving — amnesty.
But this distress, "deep as
it may be," cannot be remedied
by "simplistic," authoritarian
prescriptions, Smith emphasized.
"It is not possible for us to
be rigidly authoritarian in de
fending ourselves against those
in our community who press
change upon us,' 'he commented.
It is vitally important for

the faculty to become more
personally Involved In the life
of the university, he said. Stu
dents need to recognize that
it is "unfair, and ultimately
dishonest" to pretend that the
university alone Is responsible
for their problems," Smith
said.
"The roots of discontent go
way beyond the university," he
commented. But this position, in
turn, should not be used to ra
tionalize opposition to all change
within the university.
In a somewhat similar vein,
Packer noted that universities
are not going to solve their prob
loms through the use of force.
Quoting Prof. George Stigler of
the University of Chicago, he
said the university's authority is
intellectual and moral — that
the modern university possesses
scarcely enough physical force
to restrain its emeritus (retired)
professors.
After many years of steady
growth, Cuthbertson noted, to
tal gifts of 50 leading colleges

and universities turned down in
1966 — and the trend continued
last year. Stanford dropped from
a PACE campaign peak of $38
million in 1963 to $21 million in
1966, turned up slightly in 1967
and has topped the $23 million
mark to date this year, "a good
sign admist our turmoil."
"In a time when the gen
eral public, the mass media,
and our own alumni are turn
ing against higher education —

and in the U.S. it seems like
the better the university, the
more bitter the turn off —
Stanford was never so greatly
in need of support rather than
animosity. ...
"If Harvard, Yale and Cal Tech
are worried — and they are, out
loud and publicly — then just
double it in spades for Stanford.
The really rich schools are just
now recognizing the cost crisis
with which we have been wrest
ling for the past 10 years.
