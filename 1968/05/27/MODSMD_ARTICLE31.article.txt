# Communications

### 
In discussing the Communica
tions Department we must make
it entirely clear that communica
tion is not the subject matter
h?re. Journalism, film, broadcast
ing and little research are open
to undergraduates. The Depart
ment is in some ways a trade
school.
Fortunately, worthless practice
sessions and repititious triviali
ties characteristic of journalistic
education are non-existent, but
many of the conceptual and ethi
cal issues of journalism present
and future are equally non-exist
ent. The Department is negligent
in preparing its students for fu
ture development in communica
tion. There is absolutely nothing
taught concerning new forms of
writing, much less communicat
ing. Brilliant predictions about
the computer and its use in the
future are mouthed periodically,
but letting students explore the
implications and excitements
therein is unheard of.
While the two film and broad
cast instructors, Breitrose and
Voeker, tend largely to ignore
students and lecture poorly; the
division has potential. A program
with the Canadian division of
films promises relief.
The professors in communica

tions research (mainly followers
of Prof. W. Schramm) are really
frustrated psychologists in dis
guise. Their bias is overwhelm
ingly reflected in their under
graduate preserve â€” Communica
tions 1. Comm. 1, like these pro
fessors, is dull, uninspiring, irrel
evant and shallow.
