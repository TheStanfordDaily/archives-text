John K. Fairbank, Prof, of
Chinese History and Director of
the East Asian Research Insti
tute at Harvard will speak on
"US and China in the 1970'5"
today at 4:15 in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
Fairbank is the "most pre
eminent American Specialist on
China" according to Prof. Man
call of the History Department.
"I think I can fairly say that
Fairbank is the founder of mod
ern Chinese history studies. The
textbook which he coauthored
with Edwin Reischamp on East
Asian History is used by all the
major universities in the coun
try.
"He has probably trained
more American experts on
China and East Asia than any

one else. Many American diplo
mats and officials connected
with the problems in Asia were
trained by him," Mancall went
on to sa>.
Fairbank testified last year
before Sen. J. William Full
bright's Foreign relations com
mittee on what our foreign pol
icy toward China and Vietnam
ought to be. Fairbank feels very
strongly that we should try to
improve our relations with
China.
He has also bee a member of
an advisory board to the State
Department and written the
widely read book, United States
und China.
His speech is being sponsored
by the Committee on East Asian
Studies.
