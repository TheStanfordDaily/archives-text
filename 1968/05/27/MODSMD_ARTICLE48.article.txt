Instructors NOT Recommended:
Watkins: "In love with himself
and his good deads; he should
spend more time challenging
minds."
"Not academically oriented,
he has an A-B curve for Jocks,
Frat-men and general Brown
noses."
"A reactionary, whose con
cepts were out of date by 1930."
"He emphasizes the personal
over the intellectual and takes
a genuine interest in under
graduates."
"His grading policies are ob
scure; he doesn't return papers
or tests; there is some discus
sion as to whether he really
reads them."
Packenham: "A miserable Usur
er, and is unwilling to make an
effort to structure his courses."
"Knows Latin America, but
does a poor job of teaching com
parative government."
Eulau: "A sure cure for insomnia,
he appears not to really care
about undergraduates."
Almond: "A fine scholar but has
difficulty communicating with
undergraduates."
Abernathy: Organized, but not dy
namic.
Brody: "Perhaps his behavioristic
approach is what makes his
classes so extremely simplistic."
"Witty but disorganized."
Walker: "Not open minded; his
ideas are antiquated and out of
date. He proves that an adminis
trator shouldn't teach."
