The graffiti painters advertis
ing the Campus Conference on
the fence surrounding the new
space sciences building last
week left an unintentional mes
sage.
Near the top of the fence is
a Dylan phrase that's been there
for months: "I try my best to
be jest like I am, but everybody
wants ya to be jest like them."
Underneath: "Details at Bow
man Alumni House."
