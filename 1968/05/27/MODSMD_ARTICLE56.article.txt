Instructors NOT Recommended:
London: Lectures are dis joined;
work loads too heavy. Tries to
cram learning down students'

throats, emphasizing algebra in
stead of engineering.
Both: Rather dry lecturer, but is
interested in students. Needs to
prepare more for class and be
more dynamic.
Kruger: Repititious, un-stimulat
ing lectures with little practi
cality.
Skilling: Follows book too closely;
"A word a minute."
Thommasion: Inspires little con
fidence by reading from book
in stilted manner.
Heimwell: Competent but dull;
reads from book with little en
thusiasm for subject or stu
dents.
Widrow: Courses lack structure;
instiUs no confidence. Doesn't
use demonstrations.
Richards: Unable to clarify con
cepts in lectures. Basically un
interested in teaching.
Douglas: Lacks ability to commu
nicate concepts.
Also to avoided: Gray, Ireson,
and Lieberman.

FUTURE OBJECTIVES OF THE
COURSE BEVTEW
1. Plans are being made for a
special Course Beview Supple
ment for all incoming freshmen,
which will probably be mailed
out over the summer.
2. A review of all General Stu
dies courses is planned for next
year. The questionnaire has been
tested and revised and is in use in
other schools already.
3. We are also working on hav
ing Departments publish a de
tailed report concerning the cour
ses offered in that Department.
Information about the professor,
the course, and its objectives, the
number and types of tests, quiz
zes, and papers, the books recom
menced and required, the grading
system, etc., would be included
in this report — one for each
quarter.
4. Course Review staff are ar
ranging with the Registrar's of
fice in the re-writing and up
dating of Courses and Degrees.
5. With the Academic Affairs
Committee, the Course Beview
is attempting to get space in
UGLY for papers by students, in
structors, administrators, and ed
ucators, and a file on tests (like
some Fraternities keep).
6. The Course Beview plans to
become a unique academic jour
nal. In addition to comprehensive
evaluation of all departments and
courses at Stanford, it will pro
vide a forum for articles and es
says on all issues relevant to edu
cation.
