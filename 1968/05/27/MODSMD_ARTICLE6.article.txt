# New Steps Taken To Improve Quality Of Grad Student Life
## 
### 
Prospects for an improvement
in the quality of graduate stu
dent life developed on two
fronts at Stanford last week.
The first is the revitalization
of the near-defunct Graduate
Student Association (GSA). Sec
ond, the Dean of Students Office
will assign to one of its deans
as his main concern, graduate
student affairs.
A spokesman for the Dean
of Students Office says that
the graduate half of the stu
dent body has many unique
problems.
Previously their office had
been primarily concerned with
the lives of undergraduates.
Furthermore, the deans of the
graduate and professional
schools in the past have dealt
mostly with faculty and admin
istration business and have not
had the staff to deal with many
problems of graduate student
life.
Mike Menke, president of
the GSA, and Barry Askinas,
chairman of its executive
committee, are submitting to
LASSU Tuesday night, a bud
get of nearly ten thousand
dollars for next year.
Two controversial items in
this budget request are: 1, a
contingency fund of five thous
and dollars to be reserved for
programs initiated by graduate

and professional student orga
nizations; and 2, funds for an
ASSU Director of Graduate Stu
dent Affairs, who will be paid
two hundred dollars a month.
The Director will work closely
with the dean of students and
with the deans of the graduate
and professional schools in all
areas concerning the welfare of
graduate and professional stu
dents.
As executive director of the
GSA, he will help to co-ordin
ate graduate student activi
ties, and will serve as a re
source person to whom grad
uate and professional students
and organizations can turn
for help.
GSA members say that al
though the GSA is asking for
more money than in the past,
these funds are small in com
parison with the approximately
sixty thousand dollars that grad
uate students contribute to
ASSU.
Nick Falk, business gradu
ate and a member of the GSA
executive committee, asserts
that "while graduate students
contribute half of the funds
for the operating budget of
ASSU, we receive little bene
fit in return."
Barry Askinas, graduate in
sociology, notes that "many
graduate students and organiza
tions are thinking about drop

ping out of ASSU and taking
their funds with them."
"The GSA request repre
sents a last chance to keep
graduate students in ASSU.
If they leave, litis will lessen
what little contact there is be
tween graduates and under
graduates, and divide students
in their attempt to increase

their role in decision-making
in the university," Askins con
tinued.
Yale Braunstein, Speaker
elect of LASSU has expressed
the hope that "the proposed
budget request of the GSA will
be an adequate first step toward
keeping graduate students in

The first is the revitalization
of the near-defunct Graduate
Student Association (GSA). Sec
ond, the Dean of Students Office
will assign to one of its deans
as his main concern, graduate
student affairs.
A spokesman for the Dean
of Students Office says that
the graduate half of the stu
dent body has many unique
problems.
Previously their office had
been primarily concerned with
the lives of undergraduates.
Furthermore, the deans of the
graduate and professional
schools in the past have dealt
mostly with faculty and admin
istration business and have not
had the staff to deal with many
problems of graduate student
life.
Mike Menke, president of
the GSA, and Barry Askinas,
chairman of its executive
committee, are submitting to
LASSU Tuesday night, a bud
get of nearly ten thousand
dollars for next year.
Two controversial items in
this budget request are: 1, a
contingency fund of five thous
and dollars to be reserved for
programs initiated by graduate

and professional student orga
nizations; and 2, funds for an
ASSU Director of Graduate Stu
dent Affairs, who will be paid
two hundred dollars a month.
The Director will work closely
with the dean of students and
with the deans of the graduate
and professional schools in all
areas concerning the welfare of
graduate and professional stu
dents.
As executive director of the
GSA, he will help to co-ordin
ate graduate student activi
ties, and will serve as a re
source person to whom grad
uate and professional students
and organizations can turn
for help.
GSA members say that al
though the GSA is asking for
more money than in the past,
these funds are small in com
parison with the approximately
sixty thousand dollars that grad
uate students contribute to
ASSU.
Nick Falk, business gradu
ate and a member of the GSA
executive committee, asserts
that "while graduate students
contribute half of the funds
for the operating budget of
ASSU, we receive little bene
fit in return."
Barry Askinas, graduate in
sociology, notes that "many
graduate students and organiza
tions are thinking about drop

ping out of ASSU and taking
their funds with them."
"The GSA request repre
sents a last chance to keep
graduate students in ASSU.
If they leave, litis will lessen
what little contact there is be
tween graduates and under
graduates, and divide students
in their attempt to increase

their role in decision-making
in the university," Askins con
tinued.
Yale Braunstein, Speaker
elect of LASSU has expressed
the hope that "the proposed
budget request of the GSA will
be an adequate first step toward
keeping graduate students in
ASSU."
Prospects for an improvement
in the quality of graduate stu
dent life developed on two
fronts at Stanford last week.
