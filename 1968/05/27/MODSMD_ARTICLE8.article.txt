## French Deadlock Break 'Doubtful' 
### 
PARIS (AP) — Premier
Georges Pompidou, union lead
ers and employers a new
round of talks Sunday night to
break the hold of a 10-day-old
national strike, but key union of
ficials said a quick break in the
deadlock was doubtful. One la
bor leader, a Communist, called
on workers to "reinforce the
strike."
Andre Alterre, president of
the General Confederation of
Supervisory Employes, said, "It
appears to be out of the question
that an agreement can be
reached tonight."
Although there were indica
tions of accord on at least one
money issue, Pompidou was
forced to work against the
clock. French students have
called for a 24-hour national
demonstration Monday in defi
ance of a government edict sus
pending the right of assembly.
The appeal for the "reinforced"
strike came from Georges Se
guy leader of the General Con
federation of Labor.
Pompidou's tactic, obviously,
was to isolate the workers from
the students, leaving settlement
of the student agitation for uni
versity reforms until later.
How much later was not
clear. A union leader said:
"This conversation is like a

chest of drawers. They open a
drawer and don't close it. They
open another and it's not closed
either. They want to open a
third and it's stuck. Things are
not moving ahead."
The priority given to labor ap
peared to bear fruit later in the
day when the Community party
urged followers not to take part
in student demonstrations. It
said "new provocations" could
hurt chances of achieving Com
munist economic and political
goals.
• \ once To Fly Home
PARIS (AP) — U.S. envoys
expect to present some new
ideas to the North Vietnamese
when the Vietnam talks resume
Monday, but few foresee any
break in the deadlock. After the
session. Ambassador Cyrus R.
Vance will fly to Washington to
report to President Johnson, a
U.S. spokesman reported.
The fifth meeting is scheduled
to get under way Monday morn
ing with U.S. Ambassador W.
Averell Harriman and North
Vietnamese Ambassador Xuan
Thuy leading their delegations
into the International Confer
ence Center in the heart of
Paris.
Vance is deputy to Harriman.

U.S. officials said his return to
Washington was not timed be
cause of expectation of any un
usual development. On the con
trary, they said, the talks are
expected to move slowly for
more sessions ahead.
Despite any "new ideas" the
scenario at the meeting seems
likely to be much the same as in
the previous four sessions.
• Red Regulars Battle
SAIGON (API — U.S. and
South Vietnamese ground troops
fought out of one ambush and
through six other engagements
northern provinces over the
weekend, killing what the allied
command said were 500 North
Vietnamese regulars — troops
that Hanoi denies are in battle.
The fighting swelled Sunday
night with relentless mortar and
rocket attacks on American out
posts in the central highlands.
The North Vietnamese smashed
through the perimeters of two
fire support bases before being
driven back, sources at 4th Divi
sion headquarters in Pleiku
said.
There was concern for a U.S.
base called Brillo Pad, about 18
miles west of Kontum. In 18
hours of steady shelling, it had

taken more than 200 rocket and
mortar rounds.
The increasing enemy pres
sure was believed part a ma "
jor offensive aimed at capturing
a large chunk of area of South
Vietnam along the Laotian-
Camborlian border, where U.S.
intelligence sources estimate
20,000 North Vietnamese are en
camped.
• Bomb Halt Opposed
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
newly designated chief of the
Air Forcc in Vietnam said Sun
day a total halt in the bombing
of Communist supply routes
th'ough North Vietnam "would
be pr tty costly to us."
Lt. Gen. George S. Brown in
dicated he would be against
such total cessation of bombing,
even while upholding any U.S.
government decision to put such
a halt into effect.
"I wouldn't oppose it as com
mander of the 7th Air Force,"
Brown said. "But I'd have some
personal thoughts on the mat
ter."
He called tho bombing limita
tions invoked by President
Johnson on March 31 "neces
sary and wise," since they we-e
bound up in moves to get peace
talks going.

But Brown suggested that the
United States might find it nec
essary to rescind the bombing
restrictions, which free most of
North Vietnam from air attack,
if the Communists persist in re
fusing to de-escalate the war to
some extent in return for the
limitations.
• Poor Step Up Action
WASHINGTON (AP) — A
weekend of baking hot sun
fried mud-swamped Ressurec
tion City almost back to normal
Sunday, as the Poor People's
Campaign leader announced
stepped-up demonstrations for
the coming week.
"... We hope to move full
swing into nonviolent activi
ties," the Ralph David
Abernathy said.
"Now civil disobedience, of
course, would come as a last re
sult. It may be that we will have
to resort to civil disobedience.
We certain'y hope that this will
not become necessary, at all."
Abernathy said he hopes Con
gress, before it adjourns, will
"come forth with massive ap
propriations to deal with the
whole question of poverty in this
country ..."
If it doesn't, he said, the
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference may find it neces
sary to break its traditional non
partisan position and endorse a
presidential candidate "if we
can find one that will come
forth with a real program to
deal with poverty in this richest
nation in the history of all man
kind."
• Arabs Block Road
BEERSHEBA, Israel (AP)
Arab children, chanting "Israel,
get out," blocked a highway and
hurled rocks at cars Sunday in
the occupied Gaza Strip. Reli
able sources said five school
girls were wounded when a pan
icked Israeli civilian fired a pis
tol into a crowd.
Disorders were reported in
the strip from Khan Unis in the
southwest to Gaza City in the
northeast, where Arab women
staged anti-Israel demonstra
tions Thursday and men did the
same Saturday.
There was no official com
ment from Israel, which cap
tured the coastal strip south
west of here from Egypt in the
Mideast war last June.
The shooting came after more
than 200 girls built a stone bar
ricade that halted traffic on the
southwest highway out of Gaza
City, the informants said. The

five girls were reported taken to
a hospital with minor wounds.
The others scattered when Is
raeli troops fired machine guns
in the air, the sources said.
• GOP Attacks Demos
WASHINGTON (AP) — A
top-level Republican group said
Sunday that "wishful thinking"
by Democratic defense planners
has seriously weakened U.S.
military superiority. The GOP
report called for "an aggressive
research and development ef
fort" to keep the nation ahead
in the world arms race.
"Fearful lest new develop
ments might provoke undesir
able Soviet reactions," the Re
publican Coordinating Commit
tee said, "the administration
has failed to exploit boldly new
concepts in science and technol
ogy.
"There has been a euphoric
hope that the world's pace of
military science and technology
can somehow be slowed — that
man's inquistiveness and inge
nuity can be diverted or
curbed," it said.
The 37-page report was pre
pared by the group's Task
Force on National Security.
Former Defense Secretaries
Neil H. McElroy and Thomas S.
Gates are co-chairmen of the 20-
member task force which in

cludes six former Pentagon offi
cials, seven retired generals
and admirals, and five mem
bers of congressional commit
tees handling defense matters.
• Transplant In Brazil
SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) —
A team of 41 specialists simulta
neously transplanted the heart
and a kidney of a young auto
mobile accident victim into two
different patients Sunday. Both
patients were reported in good
condition after their operations.
The heart transplant at Sao
Paulo's Hospital das Clinicas,
was the first performed in Latin
America and the 17th performed
in the world. Six other men in
the United States, France, En
gland and South Africa are living
with grafted hearts.
Performing the heart opera
tion was Dr. Euryclides de Je
sus Zerbini. Surgery began at
6:30 a.m. and ended at 9:30 a.m.
Chief Nurse Clarice Ferrarini
said there were no complica
tions.
The operations were an
nounced by Dr. Geraldo Fer
reira, the hopsital director.
"We are very proud and hap
py," he said. "Everything indi
cates that both operations were
successful."
