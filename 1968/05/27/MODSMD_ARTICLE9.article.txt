## Parisian Prices Speed Peace 
### Art Buchwald 
It has been predicted that the
peace talks in Paris will go on
for a very, very long time. Both
the North Vietnamese and the
United States claim to have won
the war, and it's very hard to
get either side to give in on any
points when the other believes
he is talking to a loser.
The only thing that could
speed up the talks and bring
about some sort of a solution is
the fact the discussions are be
ing held in Paris. At the going
rate for hotels and food, the
real question is, which side can
hold out the longest without go
ing broke?
The State Department is opti
mistic that the United States,
despite its gold crisis and bal
ance-of-payments deficits, can
still meet its financial obliga
tions at the Hotel Crillon where
the U.S. delegation is being
housed.
A spokesman told me, "We
had a setback the first week
when Ambassador Cyrus Vance
ordered breakfast In his room,
and It almost wiped out the en
tire U.S. peace talk budget. But
Vance is now taking his break
fast in the American Embassy

mess and we should be on our
feet in a couple of weeks."
"Isn't Ambassador Averell
Harriman still eating breakfast
at the Crillon?"
"Ambassador Harriman has a
personal fortune of $50 million.
If he eats breakfast at the Cril
lon, that's his own business. Of
course, if the conference con
tinues through the summer,
there may not be much of the
$50 million left, and then he'll
have to eat breakfast at the
embassy like everyone else."
"There have been rumors," I
said, "that the United States
may halt the bombing of North
Vietnam unconditionally when
the American delegation's first
laundry bill comes in. Is there
any truth to it?"
"None whatsoever. Wo have a
special contingency fund for
laundry as well as pressing, and
we can always get a supple
mental appropriation from Con
gress in case we run out. I
would like to say there has been
far too much emphasis on what
this conference is costing the
Americans.
"The North Vietnamese are
hurting, too. They thought they
could come to Paris and stay at

the Hotel Lutetia 011 the Left
Bank, but after only a week
they had to move out. If this
doesn't indicate a w<*akening of
their position, I don't know what
does."
"But isn't the French govern
ment picking up the Hanoi dele
gation's tab?"
"They were until De Gaulle
discovered the North Vietna
mese were eating in the hotel
restaurant, a la carte. If the
Communists hadn't moved out
of the city to a house in the
country, we might have had an
agreement this week on the
question of halting North Viet
namese troop infiltration to the
south."
"Well, when do you see a
break in the conference?"
"When Ho Chi Minh receives
the first taxi bill from his dele
gation in Paris. It's one thing
for them to save on the hotel,
but they're still going to have
to spend money getting to and
from the conference hall."
"One of the news commenta
tors said he thought that a gTeat
deal more progress could be
made if talks were adjourned
to the Crazy Horse Saloon in
Paris where they have an ex
cellent strip tease show."
"This was discussed," my in
formant said, "but it was re
jected the first day when both
parties agreed they couldn't af
ford the cover charge."
