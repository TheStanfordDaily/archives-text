# Dave Harris Trial Begins
## 
### PENNY HILL 
Court proceedings started yes
terday against former student
body president David Harris for
refusing to be inducted into the
Armed Forces last January 17.
Although yesterday's agenda
was routine and not of particu
lar "spectator interest," as was
mumbled in the halls, today's
schedule appears to be more
"spectator gratifying," with
testimony slated to begin. The
second day of "The United
States vs. David Victor Harris,
case 41844," will begin at 10:00
a.m. in the San Francisco Fed
eral Building. The courtroom is
on the 19th floor.
Court opened yesterday morn
ing at 10 as the prosecuting
Attorney Steele Langford (rep
resenting U.S. Attorney Cecil
Poole) and the defense, Attor
ney Francis Heisler of Carmel,
engaged in a pre-trial informal
conference with Judge Oliver J.
Carter. The purpose of this ses
sion was to prepare the case for
the trial and to outline the is
sues to be discussed.
The prosecution stated that
the only issues that should
be presented were whether or
not Harris submitted to induc
tion and whether or not It was
his willful intention to refuse
induction.
But the defense noted that
it was also relevant to present
the issue of the morality and
fairness of the selective service
law, that is, the possibility of
presenting more issues than
those cited by the presecution.
' "W hat the government is
charging," Heisler said, "is total
ly irrelevant to this young man."
At the end of the pre-trial
conference the issues of the case
were not yet clearly outlined, as
Judge Carter admitted later
when addressing the prospective
jurors. The question of intent
was apparently strictly inter
preted by the prosecution while
the defense seemed to be bring
ing in motive with the question
of intent.
To clarify the intent, the pro
secution will present three wit

nesses. One is Federal Bureau of
Intelligence officer James Lyles,
who is assisting Langford in the
trial, and another is the officer
who was in charge at the Oak
land induction center the day
Harris refused induction. The
third witness was not identified.
The prosecution's witnesses'
testimony, as outlined yester
day, will be that Harris did
not present himself at the
Oakland induction center for
the purpose of being inducted,
that he did not enter the build
ing, and that he tore up his
induction notice in front of
the building.
Heisler plans to present six
witnesses: Dr. Nevitt Sanford of
Stanford's Institute for the
Study of Human Problems, Ben
Cievers, Roy Kepler, Dr. John
Seeley, the defendant's mother
Mrs. David Harris, and Harris
himself.
The case will be heard by a 12-
member jury which was sel
ected after 2 % hours of ques
tioning. The final panel consists
of seven women and five men,
who are participating in, as
Judge Carter told them, "one of
the highest duties of citizen
ship."
During recess and after the
day's proceedings, Harris spent
much time talking to friends
and many representatives of
local press. He told them that
"maybe the only frightening
thing about jail" is facing life
in "honest terms." He further
remarked that people are con
tinually trying to face the fact
of life with their own lives and
that takes many forms.
This "form" will be the sub
ject of much talk and delibera
tion during the next few days.
Harris anticipate a decision by
Wednesday.
Nearly 100 spectators attended
the morning session, but their
numbers dwindled during the 3-
hour recess before the after
noon session. Among those pres
ent were Harris' parents and
wife, Joan Baez, Ira Sandpearl,
director of the Institute for the
Study of Non-violence,
