## RFK Listens To Minorities 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
One aspect of the McCarthy
campaign bothers me a great
deal and deserves some reflec
tion among his supporters. No
doubt well-intentioned, as is Mc-
Carthy, they nonetheless suffer
from a disturbing intellectual
smugness and white paternal
ism.
In a speech on May 23, Mc-
Carthy said, 'the polls have
shown that my opponent's (Sen.
Kennedy's) support comes
largely from those of lower in
telligence and less education.
Keep that in mind when you go
to the polls.' Even as a joke,
this is an outrageous thing to
say and shows a good deal of
conceit—but it is evidently a
fact of which many McCarthy
ites are proud.
On the contrary, I would con
tend that it is precisely Ken
nedy's appeal to and concern
with those other than white,
middle-class intellectuals that is
crucial in his ability to make
government and"the system"
relevant to the outcasts. The
Blacks and Mexican-Americans
are aware of this and consist
ently give 80-90 per cent of their
support to Kennedy.
McCarthyites admit this, but
pooh-pooh it, saying that it is
simply a result of Kennedy's
name, and that McCarthy is
really more devoted to the mi
norities. Perhaps, but who the
hell are we whites to say? For
200 years we've been telling the
Blacks what they should think
and what's good for them; but
just look where it has gotten
them.
I should think that it is about
time we got off our paternalistic
and intellectual high-horses and
LISTEN to what the minorities
are saying. They overwhelm
ingly choose Robert Kennedy
over anyone else. I believe them.

Capsule Descriptions
Misleading, Unkind
Editor, The Daily:
The Course Review Supple
ment is certainly a good idea,
including its lists of instructors
not recommended in each de
partment. However, I object to
the strings of slanderous adjec
tives affixed to the names of sev

eral professors not recommend
ed. It was especially embar
rassing to read that one of my
professors this quarter is "an
unexciting, dis-interested, cyn
ical, ambitious administrator."
I do not wish to argue in print
about the man's personality; I
merely wish to indicate that (1)
this is not my impression of this
professor at all, (2) in general,
no brief description like this
could possibly represent all stu
dent's reactions to every facet
of an instructor's presonality or
qualifications, and consequently,
a few specific adjectives must
inevitably be somewhat mislead
ing because distorting, and (3)
even if a lengthy and precise
description of a not-recom
mended professor were possible,
it would probably be inhumane.
I hope the next Stanford
Course Review will exercise
more kindness and discretion.

This i Grand Ole Guy 9
Cares About Students
Editor, The Daily:
Whoever wrote that vitrolic
critique on Professor Watkins
and his courses obviously is not
an "athlete, frat-man or a gen
eral brown-nose" — just a porf
(sic). Either he has not taken
Watkins' courses or has pulled
through with something worse
than the SU average. Do not fret
over your ignorance though,
some Chronicle critic panned
Mame too.
Though I know Professor Wat
kins needs no defense, I feel it
is about time someone stood up
and wrote something favorable
towards this 'Grand Ole Guy.'
Granted, he does not teach in
the same dull, pedantic, behavior
alistic fashion that so many of
our Poli Sci profs do, but isn't
that refreshing. And anybody
with an gray matter at all would
not criticize a professor who
takes a sincere interest in under
grads.
Stanford professors, on the
whole, seem to be totally unin
terested in getting to know the
students, so it is encouraging to
know that someone cares what
kind of problems the students
have. Stanford — take a stroll
past 228 in the Political Science
department some MWF at 11:00

and see the type ana the number
of students lined up to see him.
You will be surprised, for sprink
led in between the typical Stan
ford turks are a few jock jackets.
So dear writer of the anti-
Watkins critique, hope he gives
you a C plus next time.

ses (P.S. 135 and 140 a).
ASSU Professorship
Is Dictatorial Decree
Editor, The Daily:
Thursday's announcement of
of the proposed selection for the
ASSU professorship next year is
another exasperating example
of Cesare Masserenti playing
dictator. Massarenti has been
repudiated by the students of
this university. How does he
dare now pretend that he speaks
for the student body?. . .
When were the students,
whose money Massarenti wants
to squander, consulted in these
matters?
The results of the last elec
tion showed that the students
were sick of Massarenti and
tired of ASSU monkeyshines.
No ASSU decisions made before
the election can now be consid
ered binding. A new referendum
must be held to ascertain
whether students really want
their money spent to hear some
one whistle through false teeth
what he has said better in print.
There are far more important
projects today on which the
money could be spent aid to
minority students for one. If a
clear majority of students should
vote in favor of an ASSU pro
fessorship, then the nominations
for the job should be open to all
university students, and the
choice should be made through
the democratic vote of the stu
dents—not by the high-handed
and dictatorial fiat of a discred
ited leader. . . .

Science, Reason Not
Mothers Of Racism
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Spearman's clever polemic
(May 23) on reason and its
shortcomings pivots on the ra
cism ,real or assumed, of Dr.
Shockley. The professor is thus
made to play the role of scien
tist as anti-human for Mr. Spear
man's human thrusts. The bal
ance of passion and reason in
human affairs, the place of sci
ence in human endeavors, the
causes of racial prejudices in hu
man communities are all import
ant issues to raise, but Mr.
Spearman's example is unfor
tunate on several counts.
First. Dr. Shockley's racial
views have met with little favor
among scientists. As I under
stand matters, the National Aca
demy of Science has flatly re
fused to take his suggestions as
a basis for recommended action.
Only when he took his case to

the popular press did he strike
sparks of sympathy.
Second, science was not the
precursor of racism in time or
in thought.
Third, an interest in the things
of the world and the habit of
thinking systematically about
them do not preclude an interest
in people or the capacity for
love and compassion. If they did,
then farmers, fishermen, chefs,
architects, and all manner of folk
simple and grand would be as
vulnerable to attack as scien
tists.
Fourth, racism feeds on pas
sion and rage, feelings that Mr.
Spearman extols. In whose pas
sion shall we place our trust,
and whose rane shall prevail?

Grad Students Need
Common Association
Editor, The Daily:
Graduate students at Stanford
are frequently in the position of
an underprivileged majority.
Cut off from other students
through heavy workloads and
living off campus, there are
almost no activities planned to
bring students in different
schools together.
Graduate students, however,
contribute half the funds that
go to LASSU. It is therefere
high time that a revitalized
Graduate Association mounted
worthwhile programs financed
by LASSU. Working through
LASSU is preferable to the var
ious graduate schools leaving
LASSU, thereby widening the
existing gap between graduates
and undergraduates, and leaving
LASSU with insufficient funds
to mount worthwhile programs.
A Graduate Association should
involve representatives from the
various graduate schools orga
nizing programs that link to
gether students with common
social and intellectual interests.
It should aim to do for graduate
students as a whole what the
International Center does so
well for foreign students. . . .
