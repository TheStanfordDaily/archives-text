# Spain Begins New University Reform
## 
### 
The Spanish Goverment, press
ed by continuing student disor
ders and apparently worried that
the examples of rebellion in
France may exacerbate them,
proclaimed recently what it
termed a practical university re
form devoid of empty gestures.
The first step of this reform,
announced after a meeting of
the Cabinet under Generalissimo
Francisco Franco, would be the
opening of three new universi
ties —in Madrid, Barcelona and
Bilbao —and of additional fac
ulties elsewhere.
The rather grudging language
used to describe the reform re
flects the strains between mod
erates in the regime and those
who argue that the remedy for
student turbulence is a sound
thrashing administered by the
riot police.
Those strains led the resigna
tion last month of Education
Minister Manlal Lora Tamayo,
a moderate, after repeated
clashes with the aging, hard
line Interior Minister, Camlio
Alonso Vega.
After on particularly heated
argument, the exasperated Ed
ucation Minister is said to have
told Mr. Vega, who commands
the Spanish Police: "The differ
ence between us, Sir, is that
you have to deal with illiter
ates and I have to deal with uni
versity students."
After Mr. Lora resigned in
mid-April, Luis Villar Palasi, a
low professor who had occa
sionally shown himself sym
pathetic to student causes, was
named to the post. The vic
tory of Mr. Vega gave the new
Education Minister a modest
opportunity for experiment

Mr. Villar gained additional
leeway when, after his insis
tence that the riot police be
removed from the university,
the students remained relatively
quiet during the first days after
it reopened this month.
Mr. Villar also insisted that
no restrictions be put on stu
dent assemblies within the uni
versity campus. At a meeting
with the rector of the univer
sity he even defined guidelines
for the limits to be placed on
student posters.
According to informed sources
at the university, Mr. Villar said
that posters condemning the war
in Vietnam would be allowed, as
would posters saying that the
government was a dictatorship.
"The only thing that he bar
red," one professor related "was
posters calling Franco person
ally an assassin or other equal
ly injurious things."
The university lull did not
last. Since the beginning of last
week, there have been clashes
most days between students and
the policemen, who have been
brought back to the campus al
though they are not supposed to
enter buildings without special
permission.
None of the demonstrations
remotely approach the magni
tude of student disorders in
Paris, Berlin or New York. But
in the special political atmos
phere of Spain, at once more re
strictive and more sensitive than
that of the other countries, they
are taken seriously.
The university reforms are de
signed to remove the specific
causes of student complaint. The
opening of new universities is
aimed at reducing the congestion
in the major centers that makes
proper teaching difficult.
Aside from the three new
universities, individual faculties
will be opened in the cities of
Santander, San Sebastian and
Badajoz.
