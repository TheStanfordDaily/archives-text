## Unlively 'Hamlet’ 
### Bq ROBERT EGAN 
The American Conservatory
Theatre (ACT) has opened its
production of Hamlet, directed
by William Ball — the com
pany's founder and General Di
rector — at the Geary Theatre.
This is the first phase of a
four-production project, also to
include Elsinore, The Bare Bod
kin, and Rosencrantz and Guild
enstern Are Dead, each a varia
tion on Shakespeare's play.
The p'an is admirable, and one
hopes for hotter quality in the
future productions. The present
one, however, is quite disappoint
ing.
Ball's Hamlet is superbly cos
tumed, interestingly staged, mi
nutely blocked and consistently
dull. Such a pattern of failure
has become a bit too familiar
with ACT this year. An over
emphasis on surface technique
and visual effect at the expense
of emotional or intellectual sub
stance made similarly flawed
works of Ball's Twelfth Night
and Crucible.
What I object to is not
an unscholarly (though Ball has
not, I think, cut the play wisely)
but an unlively rendition of
Shakespeare. There is more of
the stuff of drama — more, per
haps, that is inherently "Shake
spearean"—in The Gunfighter,
one of the more successful Gre
gory Peck horse-operas, than in
this production.
The actors have been so pre
cisely blocked into a series of
choreographic movements, op
eratic gestures and frequent tab

leaux that they rarely give the
impression of executing any
thing more than a cultural drill.
The moments of genuine tension,
excitement or conflict can be
counted on one hand.
Paul Shenar is clearly not up
to the title role. He conveys no
real depth of passion or mental
agony, his emotional range con
sisting largely of either bewild
erment or adolescent petulence.
While he manages to bring off
his scenes with Polonius, Rosen
crantz and Guildenstern rather
well, he is in obvious trouble
whenever left by himself, and he
races through the soliloquies as
uncomfortable but necessary rec
itation pieces, the sooner dis
paiched the better.
Angela Paton struggles heri
cally with her role, but she is
wildly miscast. Her Gertrude
emerges as a silly, middle-aged
lady without the slightest ves
tige of sexuality or dignity.
Scott Hylands as Laertes and
Harry Frazier as Polonius are
never more than adequate.
Considering ACT's resources
in talent, a few good perfor
mances are inevitable. Jay Doyle
is as usual, excellent. He is
double-cast as the Ghost nnd
Player-King, and he accomplish
es both with grandour and au
thority. Ray Reinhardt is a
solid, masculine Claudius, and
Izetta Smith is quite moving as
Ophelia, though she is hamper
ed by the elaborate, drawn-out
staging of her mad scene.
The most frustrating aspect of
this production is the obvious
fact that Ball and his company
are capable of far better work.
Along with the prestige and au
thority which ACT has justly
earned there should come an
equivalent responsibility for
quality.
Here, as in the case of Twelfth
Night, I am most disturbed by
the number of audience members
coming away from the Geary
with impressions of Shakespeare
exactly conforming to those
they received in high-school En
glish; quaintness, artifice and ir
relevance.

one of the more successful Gre
gory Peck horse-operas, than in
this production.
The actors have been so pre
cisely blocked into a series of
choreographic movements, op
eratic gestures and frequent tab

leaux that they rarely give the
impression of executing any
thing more than a cultural drill.
The moments of genuine tension,
excitement or conflict can be
counted on one hand.
Paul Shenar is clearly not up
to the title role. He conveys no
real depth of passion or mental
agony, his emotional range con
sisting largely of either bewild
erment or adolescent petulence.
While he manages to bring off
his scenes with Polonius, Rosen
crantz and Guildenstern rather
well, he is in obvious trouble
whenever left by himself, and he
races through the soliloquies as
uncomfortable but necessary rec
itation pieces, the sooner dis
paiched the better.
Angela Paton struggles heri
cally with her role, but she is
wildly miscast. Her Gertrude
emerges as a silly, middle-aged
lady without the slightest ves
tige of sexuality or dignity.
Scott Hylands as Laertes and
Harry Frazier as Polonius are
never more than adequate.
Considering ACT's resources
in talent, a few good perfor
mances are inevitable. Jay Doyle
is as usual, excellent. He is
double-cast as the Ghost nnd
Player-King, and he accomplish
es both with grandour and au
thority. Ray Reinhardt is a
solid, masculine Claudius, and
Izetta Smith is quite moving as
Ophelia, though she is hamper
ed by the elaborate, drawn-out
staging of her mad scene.
The most frustrating aspect of
this production is the obvious
fact that Ball and his company
are capable of far better work.
Along with the prestige and au
thority which ACT has justly
earned there should come an
equivalent responsibility for
quality.
Here, as in the case of Twelfth
Night, I am most disturbed by
the number of audience members
coming away from the Geary
with impressions of Shakespeare
exactly conforming to those
they received in high-school En
glish; quaintness, artifice and ir
relevance.
The American Conservatory
Theatre (ACT) has opened its
production of Hamlet, directed
by William Ball — the com
pany's founder and General Di
rector — at the Geary Theatre.
This is the first phase of a
four-production project, also to
include Elsinore, The Bare Bod
kin, and Rosencrantz and Guild
enstern Are Dead, each a varia
tion on Shakespeare's play.
The p'an is admirable, and one
hopes for hotter quality in the
future productions. The present
one, however, is quite disappoint
ing.
Ball's Hamlet is superbly cos
tumed, interestingly staged, mi
nutely blocked and consistently
dull. Such a pattern of failure
has become a bit too familiar
with ACT this year. An over
emphasis on surface technique
and visual effect at the expense
of emotional or intellectual sub
stance made similarly flawed
works of Ball's Twelfth Night
and Crucible.
What I object to is not
an unscholarly (though Ball has
not, I think, cut the play wisely)
but an unlively rendition of
Shakespeare. There is more of
the stuff of drama — more, per
haps, that is inherently "Shake
spearean"—in The Gunfighter,
one of the more successful Gre
gory Peck horse-operas, than in
this production.
