## 
### 
With actors and actresses
dressing this year's political
scene with unusi al vigor and
color, the story of an intellect
ual and his actress-wife who be
come involved in dissident poli
tics provides bigger-than-life
drama as The Sign in Sidney
Brustein's Window opens tomor
row in The Little Theater.
The work of Lorraine Hans
berry, author of "A Raisin in the
Sun," the play had successful
runs in New York and Los An
geles. It will be produced here
under the direction of of Ste
phan Jay Book, a master of fine
arts directing student with nu
merous professional credits.
A native New Yorker, Book
has adapted with ease the story
of a Greenwich Village interect
ual rebel and his wife who find
themse'ves waging a battle of
frustration against the powers
that-be when they decide to sup
port a reform candidate. Book
finds the play, first performed
only five years ago, a pertinent
commentary on the conflicts
common to today's mood of dis
sension and alienation.
Director Book is familiar to
local theater-goers as director of
the Ram's Head production, The
Roar of the Greasepaint — Th«
Smell of the Crowd earlier this
year. Before coming to Stanford
he accumulated both acting and
directing credits in New York.

Broadway production of The
Girl in the Freudian Slip, star
ring Alan Young and Marjorie
Lord, and directed the U.S. pre
miere of The Killing of Sister
George as a special student at
