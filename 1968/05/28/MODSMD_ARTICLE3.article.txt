### MARK LITTLE 
John K. Fairbank, professor
of Chinese history at Harvard,
addressed an audience at Dinkel
spiel yesterday and attacked
American tactics in dealing with
Communist China. He also ridi
culed the great American fear
of the "Maoist war of liberation
that won't stop until it conquers
the world."
Fairbank, who is also director
of the East Asian Research In
stitute at Harvard, told the au
dience that "I am convinced that
we are stuck with power politics.
We must have power to wield in
Asia."
He went on to say, however,
that, "This power must be
power in reserve to defend Jar
pan and Taiwan. But we have
found that we cannot defend
South Vietnam against a do

mestical civil war and external
intervention from the north
as well."
The United States, according
to Fairbank, believes that Viet
nam is a sort of test case by
which the Communist threat will
be stopped once and for all. He
calls this "stupid."
"We can take the posture in
Asia without anybody saying
that we are selling outâ€”giving
in to the Chinese. We could have
made our posture bellicose or as
a lover of peace. What did we
do? We kept on making pious
statements about 'reconciliation,"
Fairbank went on to say.
Fairbank, who used to be on
the advisory board to the Stat~
Department which dealt with
problems in Asia, also attacked
the American myth that China
is more expansionistie than the

United States. "This idea is non
sense. On the contrary, China is
the most isolationist country in
the world today. Chinese for
eign trade is a good index of
this isolationism."
Fairbank noted the myth that
China is a particularly violent
country. He pointed out that
there are more guns in private
hands (50 million) in this coun
try than in all of China including
their armed forces. He suggest
ed that Americans thrive on vio
lence:
"The Americans are the
dangerous part of the Asian-
American power equation. It is
the Americans who are violent.
It is the Americans who are
expansionistic."
Fairbank also xplainei thnt
Americans do not understand
the "new kind of defensive pop
ular warfare" in Asia.
