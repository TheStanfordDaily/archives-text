# Durand Men Protest
## Inane Porpoise Pun Cages Caen 
### DOUG TABER 
(Editor's Note: Twelve Stanford
sophomores from Durand House
visited the San Francisco resi
dence of Chronicle Columnist
Herb Caen Saturday night to
protest an alleged abuse of free
dom of the press. The following
account was written by one of
the more militant student lead
ers.)

Saturday night we threw Herb
Caen in the shower. Yes, that's
right, Herb Caen, man about
town and sometime columnist
for the San Francisco Chronicle.
Well, not actually. He turned
out to be a lot heftier than
reports would have one believe,
and he resisted being thrown
in the shower owing to a desire
to go to a party he was already
late for, so we had to settle
for splashing him with a pitcher
of icewater, but it amounted to
practically the same thing.
Now why, you might ask,
would anyone want to throw a
peace-loving newspaper column
ist in the shower?

It all started when he had the
temerity to print in his column
a certain story relating how
this guy was arrested for step
ping over a sleeping lion. It was
a staid lion, see, and he was
carrying these gulls, seagulls
they were, becauseâ€”well, any
way, you've probably heard the
story, and if not you can look
it up in Mr. Caen's column of
about a week or so ago. I cer
tainly don't want to get thrown
in the shower myself for telling
it again here.
It's not really that bad a story,
even if the punchline is some
what contrived, and normally
nothing would have come of his
printing it.
The thing is, a guy in the
house had just told it a few
days before, and it was felt
by ail present that we should
thiow him in the shower, so
we did. Not only that, but he
told it again, and we threw
him in the shower again. We
felt that this had established a
precedent.
So we wrote Mr. Caen a letter,
explaining the situation, that we

had to throw him in the shower.
We didn't really want to, he be
ing such an important man and
all, but we had to.
We sent It to the Chronicle
since he wasn't listed in the tele
phone book. Since he is im
portant and rich and busy and
everything we didn't really fi
gure that he'd answer it, and
since people who are rich and
important and everything tend
to be pretty stuffy about being
thrown in the shower with their
$150 suits and $50 shoes that the
water doesn't do too much good
to, we didn't really want to just
walk into his office, pick him up,
and throw him in the shower.
He'd probably sue.
Then we got this note Satur
day saying "How long do I have

to stand here with this bar of
Ivory soap in my hand? Yours
for shower power, Herb."
There was nothing that could
have stopped us after provoca
tion like that. We set out to find
him in a city of three quarters
of a million people, and the
events described above ensued.
We won't say how we tracked
him down, but he sure looked
surprised Saturday night about
9:15 when he opened the door
and saw about a dozen guys
standing there with bars of
Ivory soap in their hanls just
itching to dampen his enthus
iasm.
Editor's Note: Below is the
joke for which Herb Caen got
wet.
"They were having some

trouble at the zoo. It seems
there were these two porpoises
in the aquarium who were car
rying on more than public
decency would allow. The Zoo
Director tried everything he
could think of before he finally
found if the porpoises were fed
seagulls they didn't show any
interest in each other at all.
One day the attendant was
bringing the porpoises their
daily gulls when he came around
the corner and saw that an
escaped lion was asleep in the
doorway. He stepped over the
lion and was immediately ar
rested. Do you know what he
was arrested for?
Answer: Carrying gulls across
a staid lion for immoral por
poises."

AAAUUGH! Herb Caen, the punster's Everyman, Anally got his
animal crackers soggy when one of his stories raised the hair of
some Durand boys (see story). After caging him at home with them
for a while (see above), they sent him to the zoo to fight rogue
elephants with a wet noodle. "Immoral poiposes ..." Oink!
