# Police Clear SFS After New Sit-In
## 
### TIM HAIGHT 
San Francisco Police Depart
ment tactical squad members
cleared the San Francisco State
College administration building
yesterday evening after students
refused to let several admini
strators leave a meeting there.
The police action, apparently
without violence or arrests,
ended a student occupation of
the building that had started
as a "mill-in" at 1 p.m. yester
day. The demonstrators, who
promised to resume use of milit
ant tactics today, demanded an
end to the college's contract
with the Air Force ROTC (AF
ROTC) unit, which expires May
31.
They also demanded the re
instatement of Dr. Richard

Fitzgerald of the history de
partment, whose contract was
not renewed, after he offered
to teach an ancient African
history course in the experi
mental college.
They further asked amnesty
for the more than 50 students
arrested in two police actions
in the administration building
last Tuesday and Friday
nights.
Before the students blocked
the meeting, attended by Vice
Presidents Donald Garrity,
Glenn Smith, and Dean of Stu
dents Ferd Reddell, "negotiations
had resulted in two proposals
on AFROTC.
Both would have put the
ROTC question to an all-campus,
student-faculty referendum, but
the demonstrators felt condi
tions attached to the proposals
would make any action on
ROTC this term impossible.
In other meetings this after
noon, the School of Humanities
faculty voted to "sever any con
nections with the AFROTC pro
gram by refusing after Septem
ber 1968 to allow 15 units of
AFROTC program to count as
elective units for graduation for
students majoring in programs
in the School of Humanities."
The School also resolved
that "without commenting on
the right or wrong of the cur
rent, specific grievances of the
protesting students, we recog
nize and admit the truth of

their underlying grievance, the
Inok of meaningful voice and
power for the students in the
arrangement and conduct of
their total academic lives... "
The faculty further demanded
the participation of student rep
resentatives in the actual gov
ernance of this college, including
such matters as curriculum, hir
ing, retention, tenure, and pro
motion. Student responsibilities
and voting privileges (should be)
equal to those of the faculty in
the department."
The mill-in began when about
600 students surged into the of
fices of the administration to
"talk about their demands."
About ha'f of the offices were
open. Although several assis
tants and secretaries were on
hand, no one who would admit
any power to respond to the de
mands was available.
Eventually the students found
the top administrators behind
locked doors in the Dean of Stu
dents office. At a mass meeting
of about 800 demonstrators
around 2:30, the group decided
to send people to hammer on
the office until administrators
agreed to negotiations.
After about 20 minutes of
hammering six members of
the SDS-Third World Libera
tion Front steering committee
were admitted for talks. They
walked out half an hour later
saying, "They just told us
the same old thing, that they
had to honor the faculty vote."
