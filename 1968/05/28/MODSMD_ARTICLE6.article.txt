## A 						Different Quad 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
The Quad has a new idea this
year — telling why things hap
pened at Stanford this past year,
instead of just what went on.
This emphasis is new and to the
best of my knowledge unique
in yearbooks.
It's a new idea, a good idea,
and well done. The essays, es
pecially editor Bruce Howard's
opening 40-page commentary on
just about every aspect of the
University, are excellent, al
though some tend to be defen
sive.
For example, the introduc
tion to the athletics section
seems to go overboard in its
defense of athletic department
policies and attacks on critics
of these programs, blithely
ignoring such things as Health
Ed 400, the infamous encount
er between Payton Jordan and
Pat Morrison, and the well
known but oft - ignored fact
that the fraternities which
are heavily populated by
"jocks" consistently have the
lowest GPAs on campus.
Again, in the essay on resi
dences — which on the whole is
a good picture of the progress
which has been made — the fact
that it was written by a frater
nity man (a KA) comes through
in his comments on frats.
But the meat of any yearbook
in its photographs. The Quad has

done a magnificent job. The color
photos are superb, and the re
production is perfect. The only
problem is you want more of it.
The quality of the color is so
good because the paper was
chosen to reproduce color as
well as possible. But, because
of this, the black-and-white pic
tures have suffered, and their
quality leaves much to be de
sired.
As Is usual, some of the
photos are superb, others only
normal. But some are spectac
ular, and should have been
given better treatment than
they received. To do this, they
should have been larger. This
would have meant fewer pic
tures. Naturally, any editor
hates to cut a picture he thinks
is worth running, but often
such action is necessary to
make for better overall qual
ity.
One section where the photos
are not too small or too crowded
is the residence portion. Instead
of the usual dull group shots or
series of mugs, Quad has taken
pictures in varied and unusual
settings, from intriguing angles,
and occasionally with the people
in costume.
But despite its faults, the 1968
Quad is better than at least 90
per cent of the yearbooks pro
duced. And sinc° this year's was
the first from the new approach,
one can expect mistakes. Its
successes far outnumber its fail
ures, and is well worth the $8
it costs. Hopefully, the errors
will disappear in the future,
and eventually Stanford may
have a perfect yearbook.
