## Draft Card Burning Ruled Illegal 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Supreme Court approved Mon
day the jailing of Vietnam war
protesters who burn their draft
cards.
The 7-1 ruling, given by Chief
Justice Earl Warren, rejected a
free-speech attack on the 1965
federal law that made destruc
tion of draft cards a crime.
"We cannot accept the view,"
said Warren, "that an apparent
ly limitless variety of conduct
can be labeled 'speech' whenever
the person engaging in the con
duct intends thereby to express
an idea."
The Constitution, he contin
ued, gives Congress broad and
sweeping power to raise and
support armies and to make
sure the draft system functions
with maximum efficiency.
Justice William O. Douglas,
dissenting, said it is undoubted
ly true that Congress has these
powers when war has been de
clared.
"The underlying and basic
problem in this case, however,
is whether conscription is per
missible in the absence of a dec
laration of war," he added.
• Nuclear Sub Lost
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Navy reported the nuclear sub
marine USS Scornion overdue in
the Atlantic Monday night with
99 men aboard. The weather

was described as "very, very
bad."
The submarine was returning
from what was described as ex
tended training operations in
the Mediterranean.
The $40 million vessel should
have reported in about midday
as it approached Norfolk, Va.,
the Pentagon said. No message
was received.
The Pentagon said the Scor
pion was last heard from May
21. But it noted that "it is nor
mal for a submarine making a
submerged passage to observe
radio silence for extended per
iods."
Six destroyers, two subma
rines and patrol aircraft have
been thrown into a broad search
for the vessel.
The primary search zone at
this point is the Atlantic area
adjacent to Norfolk and extend
ing along a 2,100-mile stretch
covering the track the Scorpion
would have followed from its
last transmission.
• Fr. Strike Continues
PARIS (AP) — Factory work
ers by the thousands shouted
down a compromise settlement
of their 11-day general strike
Monday and, with France still
wallowing in crisis, protestors
massed for new demonstrations.
The government said it would

crush any unauthorized march
es.
Its warning came after a
stock of "murderous weapons"
was reported confiscated by po
lice at Lyon. The Interior Minis
try said extremists were pre
paring to use the fire bombs,
pistols, knives and homemade
mines "to make impossible any
return to civil peace."
This came after workers an
swered Premier Georges Pom
pidou's proposed wage settle
ment plan with catcalls and
shouts of "non." There was
more money and a shorter work
week, but the most difficult
point for the workers to swallow
was the failure of the union ne
gotiators to obtain immediate
cancellation of a social security
decree-law last fall which re
sulted in fewer benefits and
higher worker contributions.
On the salary rises, the work
ers had demanded an immedi
ate 12 per cent blanket raise
and the negotiators settled for
10 per cent by Oct. 1.
Finally they obtained only
promises and nothing firmer, on
the lowering of the retirement
age and the reduction of the
work week to 40 hours from 47
at no loss of pay.
• Rockets Hit Saigon
SAIGON (AP) — E]nemy gun
crews fired nine rockets into

metropolitan Saigon before
dawn Tuesday, killing three
Vietnamese civilians and wound
ing 28, a government spokesman
reported.
The 100-pound, Soviet-made
rockets exploded in scattered
parts of the capital, one in the
central Ist Precinct, another
around the U.S. Army field hos
pital and a third a block from
South Vietnamese Joint General
Staff headquarters on the edge
of Tan Son Nhut air base. Nine
houses were reported burned.
Bitter battles raged around
Saigon and in the central high
lands Monday. The U.S. Com
mand reported heavy enemy
casualties but further attacks
were expected in both sectors.
There was speculation that
North Vietnamese forces in the
highlands would try to cut
through Vietnam at the waist.
• Paris Peace Taks
PARIS (AP) — A U.S. spokes
man hinted at slight movement
in the snagged preliminary Viet
nam peace talks Monday by re
porting that North Vietnam
"came as close as it has to date
to admitting" it had regular
troops in the South.
While the Americans showed
particular interest in a shade of
difference in North Vietnamese
wording on the point, they also
launched a strong offensive

against the whole Hanoi position
at the talks.
To Hanoi, the primary aim of
this conference is to "deter
mine" when and how the Ameri
cans will stop bombing and acts
of war against North Vietnam.
Only when this is done, without
any reciprocity from Hanoi, can
the talks move on to other mat
ters of "common interest," the
North Vietnamese insist.
Harriman sharply rebuffed
this contention.
"We reject the suggestion . . .
that the only reason for our
meeting is to give the hour and
date of the cessation of bomb
ing," Harriman said, adding
that if such were the case, "no
meeting would have been neces
sary."
• Rioting In Louisville
LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP)
Gov. Louie B. Nunn ordered the
National Guard into Louisville
Monday night after an outbreak
of violence in the city's West
End, which is predominantly
Negro.
Nunn took action at the re
quest of Mayor Kenneth
Schmied, who informed him.
among other things, that one po
lice officer had been injured
while attempting to quell the
outburst.
There were reports of scat
tered sniping, looting and fire
throughout the area.
The crowd swelled from about
200 to an estimated 800 or more
at the height of the disturbance.
The injured officer reportedly
was struck by a missile thrown
by someone in the crowd.
What prompted the outburst
wasn't known. However, the Na
tional Association for the Ad
vancement of Colored People
had met with the mayor earlier
in the day to protest the rein

statement of Patrolmen Michael
Clifford.
Clifford had been dismissed
from the force for allegedly
abusing a Negro he was arrest
ing. The Civil Service Board can
celed the dismissal.
• Thalidomide Trial
ALSDORF, Germany (AP) —
A criminal court took up Mon
day the enormously complex
question of whether human neg
ligence, rather than a quirk of
nature, caused what some medi
cal authorities have termed the
"thalidomide catastrophe."
Seven officials and scientists
of Chemie Gruenenthal, a West
German pharmaceutical firm,
went on trial before the Aachen
state court charged in a 972-
page indictment with negligent
manslaughter and inflicting

bodily injury in the maiming
and death of thousands of chil
dren whose mothers took the
thalidomide drug in the early
stages of pregnancy. The drug
also is blamed for causing nerv
ous disorders in adult users.
Estimates of the alleged thali
domide victims range up to
6,500 children in 20 countries,
from Austria to the Philippines,
where thalidomide was manu
factured under license, market
ed or obtained by individuals
from abroad.
