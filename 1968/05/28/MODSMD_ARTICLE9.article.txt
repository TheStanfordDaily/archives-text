## Summer Anti-War Work 
### DAVID LISCHINSKY 
Many students are wondering
what they can do this summer
to help end the war. There is a
widespread feeling that Mc-
Carthy or Kennedy would end
the war if elected, and conse
quently .some students have be
gun to work in their campaigns.
However, I think that the tre
mendous energy being devoted
to both campaigns is due to the
psychological need to "go with
a winner," rather than to a care
ful examination of the posi
tions of the two candidates.
Consider the reasons given for
preference of one "peace candi
date" over the other: "Mc-
Carthy's style is low-keyed,"
"Kennedy's an opportunist,"
"Only Kennedy can win," even
"McCarthy supporters are bio
philes" (Erich Fromm, as quoted
in the Dally, May 24).
The explanation is simple —
neither McCarthy nor Kennedy
has taken an anti-imperialist, or
even a firm anti-war stand. Mc-
Carthy's voting record is abom
inable (Kennedy's is just as
bad).
During his time in the House,
McCarthy voted for every con
tempt of Congress citation of
HUAC witnesses: later, he voted
against withholding federal aid

from segragted schools, voted
to make membership in the Com
munist Party a felony, voted to
kill a proposed amendment that
would have prohibited the use
of draftees in Vietnam unless
they volunteered —the list is
long (see New Left Notes, May
13, 1968).
Many readers will say, "That
may be so, but at least he wants
to get us out of Vietnam." This
is mere wishful thinking. Mc-
Carthy made his position clear in
an interview in the magazine
Amoriea (Dec. 16, 1967): "I
think you would have to insist
on a significant presence of some
kind there (Vietnam) ... I do
not say halt the bombing. Maybe
you would continue the bombing,
especially the supply routes."
The wishful thinker: "That's
just political hocus-pocus — if
he gets elected he'll end the war."
Johnson made fools of us in '64
— we ought to be wiser now. It's
a sad fact, but we'll be better
off if we face it squarely — there
is no peace candidate.
No, brothers and sisters, no
great white father who will lead
us to the promised land. The
war will be ended only by mili
tary defeats and by mass oppo
sition at home and among sol
diers, not by the election of

"peace candidates."
Our task this summer should
be to build a mass opposition to
the war. It is extremely import
ant that we view our jobs not
merely as ways to make money,
but primarily as a means of
reaching thousands of people.
We should talk about the war,
listen to the opinions of our co
workers, and try to help them
see how they are hurt by war,
racism and imperialism. Many
workers are predisposed to con
sider our ideas seriously.
It is very important that we,
ourselves, keep in touch—
through personal contact and
through radical newspapers. The
lessons learned from the suc
cesses and failures of any one of
us should be shared with all.
This will enable us to develop
an effective theory for our work.
We should work actively in
the Peace and Freedom Party,
tell our co-workers about it and
encourage them to work in it,
too.
Right now, today, if we are
serious about wanting to end the
war, it is essential that we com
mit ourselves to viewing our
summer work from a radical
perspective—as a means of or
ganizing against the war, and
not just a summer job.

they volunteered —the list is
long (see New Left Notes, May
13, 1968).
Many readers will say, "That
may be so, but at least he wants
to get us out of Vietnam." This
is mere wishful thinking. Mc-
Carthy made his position clear in
an interview in the magazine
Amoriea (Dec. 16, 1967): "I
think you would have to insist
on a significant presence of some
kind there (Vietnam) ... I do
not say halt the bombing. Maybe
you would continue the bombing,
especially the supply routes."
The wishful thinker: "That's
just political hocus-pocus — if
he gets elected he'll end the war."
Johnson made fools of us in '64
— we ought to be wiser now. It's
a sad fact, but we'll be better
off if we face it squarely — there
is no peace candidate.
No, brothers and sisters, no
great white father who will lead
us to the promised land. The
war will be ended only by mili
tary defeats and by mass oppo
sition at home and among sol
diers, not by the election of

"peace candidates."
Our task this summer should
be to build a mass opposition to
the war. It is extremely import
ant that we view our jobs not
merely as ways to make money,
but primarily as a means of
reaching thousands of people.
We should talk about the war,
listen to the opinions of our co
workers, and try to help them
see how they are hurt by war,
racism and imperialism. Many
workers are predisposed to con
sider our ideas seriously.
It is very important that we,
ourselves, keep in touch—
through personal contact and
through radical newspapers. The
lessons learned from the suc
cesses and failures of any one of
us should be shared with all.
This will enable us to develop
an effective theory for our work.
We should work actively in
the Peace and Freedom Party,
tell our co-workers about it and
encourage them to work in it,
too.
Right now, today, if we are
serious about wanting to end the
war, it is essential that we com
mit ourselves to viewing our
summer work from a radical
perspective—as a means of or
ganizing against the war, and
not just a summer job.
Many students are wondering
what they can do this summer
to help end the war. There is a
widespread feeling that Mc-
Carthy or Kennedy would end
the war if elected, and conse
quently .some students have be
gun to work in their campaigns.
However, I think that the tre
mendous energy being devoted
to both campaigns is due to the
psychological need to "go with
a winner," rather than to a care
ful examination of the posi
tions of the two candidates.
Consider the reasons given for
preference of one "peace candi
date" over the other: "Mc-
Carthy's style is low-keyed,"
"Kennedy's an opportunist,"
"Only Kennedy can win," even
"McCarthy supporters are bio
philes" (Erich Fromm, as quoted
in the Dally, May 24).
The explanation is simple —
neither McCarthy nor Kennedy
has taken an anti-imperialist, or
even a firm anti-war stand. Mc-
Carthy's voting record is abom
inable (Kennedy's is just as
bad).
During his time in the House,
McCarthy voted for every con
tempt of Congress citation of
HUAC witnesses: later, he voted
against withholding federal aid

from segragted schools, voted
to make membership in the Com
munist Party a felony, voted to
kill a proposed amendment that
would have prohibited the use
of draftees in Vietnam unless
they volunteered —the list is
long (see New Left Notes, May
13, 1968).
