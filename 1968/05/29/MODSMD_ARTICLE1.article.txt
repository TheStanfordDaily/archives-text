# McCarthy, Nixon Take Oregon

### 
PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) —
Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy forged
a surprisingly substantial but
dwindling lead over Sen. Rob
ert F. Kennedy as returns
mounted from Tuesday's Ore
gon Democratic primary.
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy vir
tually conceded tonight that Sen.
Eugene J. McCarthy had defeat
ed him in Oregon's presidential
primary.
"It would appear that McCar
thy has won the primary," Ken
nedy said.
Kennedy himself said in a
CBS-TV Interview Monday '1
can't afford to lose If I'm go
ing to remain a very active
and viable candidate. It would
adversely affect me In a very
serious way."
Former Vice President Rich
ard M. Nixon administered a
sound threshing to California
Gov. Ronald Reagan, on the

ballot, and New York Gov. Nel
son A. Rockefeller, a write-in
contender.
Nixon stopped just short of
claiming that the results in this
final major primary involving
Republican contenders had
wrapped up the GOP nomina
tion for him.
Organized labor failed in its
effort to roll up a significant
portion of the Democratic vote
for President Johnson as a
stand-in for Vice President Hu
bert H. Humphrey. Johnson quit
contention too late to get his
name off the ballot.
Humphrey, regarded as a
top bidder for the presidential
nomination, got only a rela
tively small write-in vote.
The partial count from 1,020
of the state's 2,599 precincts
gave: McCarthy 39,019, or 43 per
cent; Kennedy 33,285, 37 per
cent; Johnson 11,694, 13 per

cent; Humphrey write in 6,000,
10 per cent.
In 955 precincts, the Republi
can total was: Nixon 50,892 or
72 per cent; Reagan 15,428, or
22 per cent; Rockefeller 4,331, or
6 per cent.
Sen. Wayne Morse, seeking
the Democratic nomination for
his fifth Senate term, ran into
critical trouble and was barely
ahead of former Congressman
Robert Duncan in early returns.
In Los Angeies, Eugene Wy
man, California's Democratic na
tional committeeman, called on
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy to with
draw Tuesday as a candidate for
president.
"Sen. Kennedy correctly stat
ed that he had to win Oregon to
remain in the race," Wyman
said. "His defeat by his own ad
mission eliminates him.
"I hope Sen. Kennedy will now
support Hubert H. Humphrey

in the vice president's march to
the presidency."
McCarthy's standing in that
final primary seemed likely to
be greatly enhanced if he could
manufacture a solid victory
over Kennedy in Oregon.
As the tabulations mounted,
the trend indicated that Vice
President Hubert H. Humphrey,
a top contender for the nomina
tion, was failing to roll up a sig
nificant percentage of the vote
by proxy and by write-ins.
It was generally agreed that
votes for President Johnson,
who quit contention too late to
get his name off the ballot,
could be listed as backing Hum
phrey.
In San Diego, Gov. Reagan
said Tuesday night he was
"pleased and gratified" at re
ceiving about one-fifth of the
Republican vote in the Oregon
presidential primary.

But he said he would have
done b tter if he had cam
paigned actively in that state.
His percentage of the GOP
vote was about what he won in
the Nebraska primary—22 per
cent.
"Yes, of course, it would be
different," Reagan said, if ho
had campaigned in Oregon.
He said the 20 per cent that
first returns gave him was
"quite a bit better than the polls
gave him" and stronger than
the 15 per cent which he said
his campaigners reported he
would get
His supporters waged exten
sive radio and television cam
paigns even though Reagan did
not personally seek votes.
When a newsman asked him
if he would announce now as an
active candidate for president,
Reagan replied, "No, nor would
I had the results been reversed."
