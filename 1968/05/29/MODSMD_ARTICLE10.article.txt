A thorough review of the quality of instruction at Stanford is a
valuable asset for both faculty and students. The latest attempt
— the Stanford Course Review — is not.
I
Course evaluations can provide:
• a guide to the various courses with fuller and more accurate
descriptions of the content for students contemplating taking
them.
• suggestions to faculty members on how the content or style
of their classes might be improved.
• a reference for academic departments to judge the teaching
ability of their faculties and even provide another voice in the
tenure proceedings.
• a forum for discussion and student participation in academic
reform.
The course review this year however falls short. The discussion
of professors and courses was at best shoddy.
The recommendations on specific courses do not give any con
sideration to the professors involved. Courses in which professors
alternate teaching each quarter were ranked without regard vft
the specific instructor. Evaluations were completed by depart
mental majors rather than all the students in the course.
The consideration of the faculty centered on the "not recom
mended" instructors and simply listed those appreciated by stu
dents. The professor's teaching ability was not appraised, but
praised or condemned.
Those condemned by the Review were attacked in a very per
sonal way. The descriptions (although many were absolutely
correct) will do nothing to alleviate the problems to which the
Review should be addressing itself.
We are encouraged by the existence of a course evaluation, the
feedback it has both provided and received, and we hope that fu
ture editions will be more comprehensive.
