## 'Course Review' Under Attack 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
The Stanford Course Review
Supplement is both tasteless
and unnecessary. Course evalu
ation is most easily made verb
ally among interested students;
residence libraries might profit
ably contain printed evaluations
as well. But a public report
which includes specific critic
isms of our professors is likely
to embarrass or even humiliate
the unfortunate, and often un
deserving, victims.
And if the aim of the review
is objectivity and not an at
tempt to decry the personalities
of the professors, why include
such comments as "in love with
himself and his dees," "a reac
tionary," "arrogant manner,"
and "cynical, ambitious adminis
trator?"
And is it not presumptuous
to declare that a professor "will
not remain here if he does not
acquire some teaching and per
sonal qualities?" Is that a
threat?
The publication of a course
review is of questionable value,
and its use as an aid to unde
cided students in choosing a
major is absurd. A student can
not make that choice respon
sibly on the basis of personali
ties or course popularity.
If students have constructive
criticisms, let them express their
sentiments privately to their
teachers. It has been done in the
past; and it works. Professors
should not be placed publicly on
trial; even in politics the re
sponsible candidates refuse to
deal in personalities.
Unfortunately, the damage is
done. It is possible that the ad
justment of some of the pro
fessors to this public criticism
will be self-conscious or even
vindictive.
In the future, if students are
dissatisfied with them and
afraid to approach them person
ally, a Stanford Course Review
might conduct a new study. But
its results should not be made
public; they should be handed
directly to the professors in
volved. Even better, professors
should be to con

duct their own surveys, as some
now do.

Listing Of Faults Is
Useless, Malicious
Editor, The Daily:
Whether the Course Review is
valid or valuable for students
wanting a guide to "good"
courses is doubtful. But there is
no doubt as to the value of the
precise descriptive attacks on
the "not recommended" profes
sors.
The enumeration of faults
serves no practical purpose in
directing students to courses
which are considered worth
while. Most important, however,
is the way in which the nega
tivity is expressed. That this
published malice is unjustifiable
should be felt rather than ar
gued. Professors are people too.

Between The Lines:
A Self-Condemnation
Editor, The Daily:
Wasn't the Course Review
much more of an indictment of
us as students than a healthy
critique of our teachers? A
rather vicious self-portrait we'd
rather not recognize?

Critical Responsibility
Belongs To Everyone
Editor, The Dally:
Education is a two-way street.
While the quality of instruction
is one ingredient, the final re
sponsibility lies with the student
himself. Most students have
failed to accept this responsibil
ity. Perhaps they can best be
described as "complacent." They
care, but they do not care
enough. Their action is re-action
Too often, they must be pro
voked. Too often, they must be
shocked out of their complanc
ency. This is unfortunate.
We have received a good deal

of criticism concerning the rec
ent Stanford Course Review
Supplement This is good; we
welcome criticism. Some mem
bers of the community have at
tacked our work (which was
largely in an editorial capacity).
Others have complimented us.
But this is not enough. (If this
was our goal, our next step
would be to sponsor a campus
referendum to accept or reject
the Review.) We aim to make
students critical agents of their
environment. It is not enough
that the large majority of stu
dents do nothing all year to
improve their community, then
offer their criticism when some
one else makes an effort.
We recognize our own short
comings—we recognize the in
adequacies in our first attempt
to review education at Stanford.
But we also realize that it can
serve a useful purpose. We ask
that those critical of our work
do more than send inflammatory
letters to the Daily or make a
few angry phone calls. We ask
those critical of our work—
those truly concerned with their
education—to join us in our
goals to:
—Improve course evaluation;
—Expand COURSES AND
DEGREES;
—Make available complete
course descriptions on a de
partmental level;
—Improve advising;
—Centralize files with papers
on education, old exams,
etc.;
—Establish a unique academic
journal to provide a forum
for articles and essays on
all Issues relevant to educa
tion.

Thanks Extended
To Blood Donors
Editor, The Daily:
Four weeks ago I was hospit
alized with a severly bleeding
ulcer. In the subsequent emerg
ency operations, many Stanford

students and administrators do
nated blood which I urgently
needed. Since I do not know any
of these individuals personally,
I would like to take this oppor
tunity to extend my deepest
thanks and gratitude to both
those who donated blood and
those who kindly spent time
with my family during the em
ergency.

Secretary Violates
Professional Trust
Editor, The Daily:
I do not know Mario Tavares
(Letters, May 24) but whether
a "he," a "she" or "it" I strong
ly object to the title of ASSU
"Socretai;'" under its name.
From the Latin secretum, the
essential quality expected of a
secretary seems obvious and I
must say I regard with some
disgust a "secretary" who dis
closes the content of letters
(and apparently personal let
ters) dictated to him (her/it).
I suggest Mario Tavares give
up both the title and the func
tions.

Radicals' Accusations
Ring Hollotv In LASSU
Editor, The Daily:
"Radicals" often complain
about the establishment and
how it impairs progress and
stifles rational investigation into
problems. One can see much
justification for such despera
tion. Yet what does one find
when responsibility is given to
these same frustrated crusad
ers? If the "radical" members of
LASSU are any indication, one
may quickly conclude that their
accusations are hollow. In the
meeting last Thursday night,
these members did everything
within their power to make re
sponsible student participation
in a democratic institution a
myth. LASSU as a creative and
dynamic institution is dead.
