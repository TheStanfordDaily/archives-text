# Two Minutes of Haight
## A
						View Of Generation Gap 
### Tim Haight 
Our generation is old for its
age. Our birth was heralded by
the blast over Hiroshima, and
our youth was entertained with
TV ranging from"I like Ike"
and the old McCarthy to "I Love
Lucy" and Vietnam. Against this
background of man's struggle
against himself, for good and
evil, we have plunged into the
academic world, where people
dare ask, "What is man?"
The summing up is not really
very good. The message of
Christ became the dogma of the
Inquisition, the Scientific Revo
lution has led us to the Techno
logical Society, the French and
Russian revolutions have led to
Napoleon and Stalin, and the
"War to end all Wars" has led to
. . . wars.
In freshman bull sessions (I'm
so old, do they still call them
that?) people rehash the argu
ments. What would you have
done Lf you had been bom In
1915 in Germany? What would
you do If someone attacked your
wife (mother, girlfriend, sister)
if you believed in non-violence?
Do you think that everything
that a man does Is necessarily
selfish? These questions are the
residue of that basic contradic
tion between man's noble words
and his deeds of colonialism, sla
very, Nazism, war, corruption,
callousness. The list groes on.
As a sophomore or junior, you
may drink more, have more sex
—some sordid, some not — get
into encounter groups, activities,
fraternities, demons t r a t i on s.
Somehow, while the big ques
tions remain debating-society
topics, you acquire response-pat
terns that make you hot under
the collar when some views or
acts appear and apathetic about
others. Sometimes you will
throw up your hands, plead con
fusion, and ask God, the I Ching,
LSD, the Counseling Service, or
some friend for help or com
fort. You get by with a little
help from your friends.

But voices impinge on you.
Dylan sings his mordant lines,
like, "Advertising slogans which
con you into believing you're
the one who can do what's never
been done, who can win what's
never been won. Meanwhile out
side life goes on all around you."
Or perhaps, "While the mas
ters make the rules for the wise
men and the fools, I've got noth
ing, Ma, to live up to." And you
sec that Custer's last stand and
the Way West looks a little dif
ferent from the Indian side, and
that Rhett Butler and Scarlet
O'Hara, so quaint and charming:,
were doing the work of Jacob's
children. You have no heroes.
Your parents are very con
cerned about you. You are their
immortality — from Shake
speare's sonnets to Pepsi's com
mercials. And they see you—at
least the corporate you—on TV
at Lauderdale or Oakland. You
explain yourself to them, as D">-
Tocqueville said Americans al
ways speak—as if you were ad
dressing a public meeting.
But while they are concerned
about you, they are adjusted to
themselves. They have carved
out their bit of ground. They
have felt the rhythms of many
seasons. They look to you out of
the grave that ages people in
the prime of life, the grave of
acquiescence in a time of chaos,
the grave of the slave, the tomb
of the womb. They discuss you.
You discuss them. But it is a
history lesson, padded with the
cotton of the generational con
flict—insulated.
Baby, you're on your own.
I don't remember exactly how
it went, but in one of Gide's
books the main character had a
search for God that led him to
the altar In some church, where
he was about to pray. Then he
saw this person he really hated,
piously praying there. The hero
left in a hurry. It's like Huck
Finn said about if certain peo

pie went to heaven. He'd choose
hell, thank you.
Maybe that's what does it, I
don't know. But some of us re
ject the American package and
others accept. For some the im
portant activity is to achieve
success, money, status, and
enough of an air of good will to
insure friends and respect. This
is a private vision, of leaving
your small circle of friends a
little better off, your company
more prosperous, your wife sex
ually satisfied, your personal
balance sheet in the black. Be
yond that lies the murky void of
politics, ideology, angry people,
and anxiety. It can ensnare you
and is best viewed at a distance
through lenses designed for the
busy man.
But for others the beat goes
on. Somehow they have the urge
to resolve the big contradiction,
man's good and his evil. It's like
that thing in our heads that
makes us see patterns that
down-people don't see when
we're stoned on LSD. Somehow
the Vietnam thing and the Ra
cism thing and the Alienation
thing and the Economic th in g
take on reality so personal that
become our close friends.
Not friends, really. They're
like relations. We don't like
Aunt Vietnam. She looks like
Hitler, if you can imagine. But
she lives under our roof with
Colonel Racism our cousin and
Father Military-Industrial Com
plex. We want to leave home
and find new friends, but the
blacks on the streets and the
people overseas have heard our
family name. We can't go home
again yet we are who we are.
If we had a magic wand or a
fairy godmother or Aladdin's
lamp or a genie in a bottle. If
we could sacrifice a lamb or
even give a life. If we could
ev>n write a letter to a con
gressman and got something oth
er than a mimeographed re
sponse with our name typed in
and spelled wrong.
And we are told to learn pa
tience. "It's getting better all the
time, for one thing, and we don't
want to bring down the Temple
like Samson we simply
\v n nt to throw the money
changers out like Christ." But is
it? And don't we?
We see laws and Supreme
Court decisions like Pleasy v.
Ferguson making Jim Crow the
Law of the Land. We see that
the same Supreme Court, with
different actors, changed that,
and we are glad. But what is
The Law?
We see riots in the ghettos,
which we deplore. Yet we see a
new dignity rising from Watts
and Hunters' Point, and a white
America putting out a manifesto
on racism that would not have

occurred except for those riots.
We see our President, that Vi
car of the City of Man, squirm
ing to make the facts fit his poli
cies, with the whole pile of lies
and incompetence going up in
the flames of Tet. We see le
gions of officers in the Pentagon
talking of "nuking" people,
while we stare at a friend or
relative's waxen corpse in some
plastic funeral parlor and re
member that people die one by
one, not in numbers by little
flags on Walter Cronkite.
And the liberals say wait.
"When some Southern senators
die, and when some lobbies come
to realize that equality means
more profits, and when the
Board of Trustees makes a mis
take and appoints a non-con
servative, things will be better."
Humphrey calls this the politics
of joy.
But behind the liberals are the
men with the money. And the
overseas investors. And the gov
ernment bureaucracy and corpo
rate bureaucracy whose tenta
cles reach into even the sanctu
ary of academe and determine
what research the wealth-hun
gry and status-hungry and cos
mopolitan professors can get
money for.
And these people say to us,
"Be cool. Our interests are your
interests. What's good for Gen
eral Bullmoose is good for the
U.S.A." And they advertise their
cigarettes, and their 400 horse
power internal combustion en
gines, and their pills for which
they make up diseases like the
"Blahs." BullSHIT their inter
ests are our interests.
AI1 we have to do is produce
and keep quiet, like a cow, or
calculate and scheme, like a
computer. Then they love us
and grant us leisure. But don't
give up the nine-to-five, don't re
fuse the draft, don't speak of
revolution, or the soft, soft kitty
will use her claws.
They will say you hate them,
because you want to make them
moral. They will say you want
to destroy them, because you act
to stop the killing now. They
• ill call von fascist because you
dare call anything right or true.
Rejoico in that. It means you
are alive.
