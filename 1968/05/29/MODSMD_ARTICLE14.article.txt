## Facts In France 
### Drew Pearson 
One of the first reports Sar
gent Shriver cabled back from
Paris after assuming his new job
as ambassador to France was a
warning that French labor was
restless and that De Gaulle was
headed for trouble. French labor
resented the fact that De Gaul
le had spent so much money on
nuclear bombs and had kept his
head in the clouds regarding the
plight of the common man. La
bor, Ambassador Shriver report
ed, was griping over low wages,
the high cost of living, inflation,
poor housing and costly hospi
talization.
Shortly thereafter Shriver,
who had been head of the anti
poverty program in the United
States, found himself in the mid
dle of an antipoverty revolt in
France.
The basic facts in France are
that De Gaulle has had it. He is
too old ; has been in too long, has
drifted too far from the cour
ageous policies which featured
his earlier years in office. He has
got into a rut. For the past four
or five years France has almost
been asleep.
Most interesting phase of the
current anti-Gaullist revolt is
the manner in which communist
leaders of the CGT, the big
French labor confederation, have
secretly come to De Gaulle's de

fense. They have used their in
fluence to prevent violence and
to keep the leftist students of
the Sorbonne from coming to
gether with striking workers.
It's probably that, before the
summer is over, De Gaulle's gov
vernment will give way to a left
of-center socialist regime under
either ex-Premier Guy Mollet, a
socialist, or Francois Mitterand,
secretary general of the So
cialist Party.
French TV Revolt
One significant development
during the French strikes has
been the complete takeover of
French radio and television by
ORTV, the union of French radio
television artists.
Since French radio and tele
vision are controlled by the gov
ernment, news policy was dic
tated every day at 11 a.m. by a
committee of ministers which
met to decide what news the
French people should hear. For
eleven days the news of the stu
dent strikes at the Sorbonne was
withheld from the French listen
ing and viewing public.
Then ORTF, led by Pierre Laz
areff, editor of France-Soir,
moved in and took over. They
have evicted the French govern
ment censors and given the
French people a complete picture
on radio and television of what
is happening.
