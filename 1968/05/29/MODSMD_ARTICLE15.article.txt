## Campus And Stanford Crisis 
### ROBERT G. COHN 
For a man like Camus who
lacked a father — hence a mast
er to follow intimately along con
ventional paths — life was over
and over again an inner fight to
achieve mastery of himself
(there were other reasons for
his "outsider" status, such as
poverty). The aim of normal
manhood in this condition is, at
least intermittently, inevitably
overshot — with proportional
repercussions.
This is the properly rebellious,
or creative, mood: the fatherless
constitute an enormous propor
tion of the great names of liter
ature, art and social change.
Something like this mood is now
widespread among the sensitive
youth of the "abandoned gen
eration."
It is furthered by complex
kinds of fatherlessness in "dis
inherited" minority groups—Ne
groes, Indians, Jews — who
have been deprived of their deep
est identity (the core of their
religious and social tradition)
in a polycultural modern con
fusion where the dominant val
ues, in the United States, are
still apt to be WASP ones; "there
is no more father, no more rule"
(The Fall).
Some of the restless souls,
despite the difficulties, retain,
or may eventually return to,
the faith of their ancestors.
Some — as happened during
the successful years of the
Roman Empire — may swal
low the bitter pill and accept
the dominant Identity, convert
or "pass."
Others, recalling Nietzsche,
finding God dead in our time,
may seek a cosmic identity in a
total acceptance of what is, in
the name of creativity — a sort
of God beyond God, perhaps pan
theistic, for all mankind event
ually. In social terms, this vi
sion may branch into a quest
for a world order. Although
there remain hidden strands of
individual traditions in such psy
ches, these are interesting stabs
in the direction of the "world
citizenship" dreamed of by Mon
tesquieu.
But here we come to a deci
sive parting of ways: to the ex
tent that a man of this stripe —
he is fairly characteristic of the
liberal intellectual generally, as
found in our leading universities
—is committed to the inner life,
to his own mental work or cre
ativity, he is not apt to funda
mentally question a reasonably
just and effective order which
allows him to survive and carry
on his task.
Though the pull of the social
dream, which is always in him
to some extent, may make it
very difficult and threaten to
tear him apart with inner con
tradiction, in a crisis he will
eventually settle for a moderate
reform of the status quo (though
he may mask this with ambig
uous formulas. In time, of
course, the contradiction will re
cut. In this uneasily evolving
posture, he finds himself in al
liance with sophisticated ad
herents of the leading tradition
al faiths.
Such was the later path of
Camus. At first he accepted
his youthful revolt in Its pure
form (THE MYTH OF SISY
PHUS, THE STRANGER)
and seemed bound to subscribe
to political revolution. But
World War II and fascism
taught him a bitter wisdom.
The faith which he had pre
viously rejected in cocky to
tal defiance, he now consid
ered (THE REBEL) as Indis
pensable to keep man from
destroying himself In an "all
Is permitted" climate of hu
man, or "historical," struggle
for justice.

Though he continued to shy
away from any individual body
of dogma, the faith he retained,
for practical purposes, was an
old one, largely inherited from
the Greeks (Helen's Exile: "the
sacred," "value," "nature," "sen
se of limit"), with Christian nu
ances.
Though Camus continued to
believe that he could straddle the
divergent realms of individual
creativity and social justice, the
immense pulls — in The Rebel,
his unconditional admiration
goes to Proust, even as he calls
for passionate immersion in the
struggles of his era — made this
impossible at a certain point.
A close examination of his
various utterances reveals that
he moved further from the pub
lic arena in his later years, thus
exposing himself to the cogent
attacks of Sartre and his di
sciples, fundamentally unans
werable in their own terms. It
is high time that Camus' young
admirers knew what he really
stood for: faith in his cultural
mission, first, and secondly, in
a limited struggle for social jus
tice, under self-imposed rules of
scrupulousness which would in
hibit true revolution (i.e. when
the other side sheds its scrup
les).
Thus, even as he called for
"limits" among revolutionaries—
action checked by contemplation
("memory," "value," "honor"
etc.) — he affirmed that the best
art is based on the most uncom
promising rebellion (The Rebel,
p. 271). The artist, In his concep
tion, is supposed to commit his
rebellion to life-values, as in the
novel, but this is not a movement
toward moderation, but toward
a higher synthesis, as in his for
mula of "proud compassion" (p.
297).
This Is less dangerous than
the political equivalent of
compassionate excess In revo
lution which he condemned —
the artistically creative revolt
involves only one person. In
the long run, the uncompro
mising new vision of the art
ist abets revolution; but this
position Is easier to accept on
the spot and was so for Camus.
Let us be clear as to what is
at stake here and now. None of
the rationalistic formulations
about "trial by peers," "student
representation," etc., should be
allowed to mask the fundamental
issue, which is a double clash
of faiths (a tetrapolar drama),
rebellion tending to revolution in
two divergent (or crossed) direc
tions, the individually (artistic
ally or culturally) creative and
the socially creative.
If we go the way of the lat
ter, we must be willing to sac
rifice much of the former and
indeed accept something like the
cultural eclipse which has al
ways been attendant upon such
upheavals. Between such pure,
"infinite" pulls, the tendency is
— even in exceptional spirits
like Camus — to go decisively
one way or the other.
For, although a man may

move for a while diaJecticaily be
tween the two realms and
achieve at times an interesting
synthesis, there always comes
the crucial instant of "anti-syn
thesis," of conflict, confrontation,
and choice. A compromise is
hardly possible, given such ex
treme commitments, in the eith
er-or moment of crisis, when, as
between male and female, or any
two such ways of life, one way
appears as decisive for each.
Either the devoted artist (or
scholar) must give in (provi
sionally) or the devoted activist:
true mediation here would be
possible only in naturally more
relaxed men, of the sort who
teach and learn at easier-going
institutions.
So the question is: do we
want predominantly to carry
on our distinguished cultural
task or Join the politically
revolutionary forces or, as a
third possibility, become a
rather mediocre compromise
between the two?
Personally, I stand for the
first of these options. I would
maintain this stand in any cir
cumstance short of a clear in
dication that my work was con
tributing to the support of a
corrupt order, e.g. fascist. And,
if I contribute to a partially
corrupt order, I suppose I have
to accept a partial social guilt
in the name of the other kind
of long-range contribution (pace
Mr. Weissman, this way isn't all
pleasure —).
Perhaps Camus can assist us
on this point, where one has a
certain difficulty breathing. It
may not help here to know that
everyone is guilty to some ex
tent and that the purest social
idealists have denied justice, and
sometimes life, to some, seeking
justice for many. Indeed, Cam
us, after recommending a "rea
sonable culpability" in The Rebel
has warned us about the easy
abandonment of the search for
innocence in The Fall.
But the very obscurity and
anguished tone of his text
tells us we are approaching
the point where utterance It
self may be futile, where a
scandalous "either-or" takes
over in silence. Is the attempt
to clarify, to be honest, wrong?
Perhaps. Still, life goes on
and one must choose, clearly
or not.
The choice I speak of, in the
context of Stanford, among hu
mane people, is at the level of
contending visions, not of lives.
I assume that we will continue
to coexist, to contend another
day.
Each situation is concrete, and
contextual: in France today my
attitude would not be precisely
the same as it is here. Stanford,
in a social system which has yet
to be proven bankrupt, is a Uni
versity on the rise, bound for
probable greatness. It should be
given its chance to achieve this,
as Oxford and Sorbonne did
in their day.
