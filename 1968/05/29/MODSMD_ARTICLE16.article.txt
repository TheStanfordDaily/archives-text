SACRAMENTO (AP) — Liv
in in a creaky 1949 model sta
tion wagon, Cheri Gordon, a 21-
year-old college coed, says she
keeps expenses down.
"Every night I look for a new
parking place," says Miss Gor
don, who calls her mobile home
"Old Green Moose."
"Try to find a place where
there are no bright lights, in
some residential area under lots
of shady trees. Sometimes you
have to drive an hour to find
one."
Although her father worries,
Miss Gordon insists she is "per
fectly safe." She is a junior ma

joring in physical education at
Sacramento State College.
She explained Wednesday: "I
usually study on the campus un
til after midnight, and there's
never anyone on the streets
when I park this Old Green
Moose. I sleep in my gym
ing I just hop right into the
front seat and I drive off."

Besides, Miss Gordon said,
"the window panels are high and
no one would ever suspect a girl
is sleeping inside."
She showers even,- morning at
the college gymnasium, and can
even set her hair before an 8
a.m. class. She keeps her clothes
in her gym looker, and "really
it's all very convenient."
For cooking, Miss Gordon
stows a Japanese grill amid her
mattress, books and tennis rack
et in the cluttered rear portion
of the car. A lounge chair is
propped against the interior side
of the vehicle.
"I can get along very nicely
without much money," Miss
Gordon said. "I spend about $35
a month—and most of that is
for gas."
Miss Gordon's father, a retired
Air Force sergeant, lives 45
miles away in Fairfield.
"My father is constantly say
ing I'm off my rocker. He says,
'You're nuts but you've got guts.'
But he wants me to finish my
education, and we just don't
have enough money to do it an
other way," she said.
