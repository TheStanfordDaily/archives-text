# Stanford To Unveil Plan For Concord
## 
### 
A unifying growth plan for
Concord, tying together existing
centers of activity with propos
ed balancing aspects, will be pre
sented at the annual Concord
Chamber of Commerce meeting
Tuesday evening.
The plan, the result of a year
long study by students of Stan
ford's Community Development
Laboratory (CDL), will be un
veiled at a banquet at Concord
Inn. A scale model, an illus
trated brochure, and a compre
hensive written report will amp
lify the proposal.
CDL students from the var
ious University disciplines of
architecture, law engineering,
and business will make the
presentation.
Speakers will include Henley
Worthington of Concord, who
heads the special "Concord '70"
Committee of the Chamber,
which contracted with the CDL
for the plan; John T. Law, fac
ulty head of the CDL; and Bart
Lytton, California financier and
visiting lecturer in urban design
at Stanford, who will give the
main address on "The Tomorrow
City."
Worthington commented this
week, "We are eagerly awaiting
the final plan from the Stanford
students. The 'Concord '70' Com
mittee and the CDL members
have held two public meetings
in Concord during this year. All
of us have made numerous trips
back and forth to assist and
guide each other in this project.
Our committee has been im
pressed with the caliber and tal
ent of these people and we feel
fortunate in having the benefit

of their expert advice and in
genuity."
Law describes the unifying
growth plan as "creating a con
tinuous flow pattern between the
existing Sun Valley Center, Park
and Shop, and the proposals we
are making for the downtown
and Plaza areas and their re
lationship with the Civic Cen
ter, the new BART terminals,
and the new state college."
He continues, "The challenge
of planning for a growing sub
urban area such as Concord
lies in hope of merging the de
mands of numbers with a qual
ity of living that will create
an exciting community."
"In the unique concepts being
presented," Law concludes, "we
believe we are providing a plan
that will unify Concord's devel
opment and make the City an
enviable one, both in financial
soundness and community pride
and solidarity."
