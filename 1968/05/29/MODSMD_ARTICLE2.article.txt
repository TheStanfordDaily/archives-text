# LASSU Creates Publishing Board
## 
### 
The student legislature met
last night to consider next year's
budget for the Associated Stu
dents but failed to act on it.
Measures that were passed by
the legislature included the cre
ation of a publishing board to
supervise the day-to-day opera
tions of the Daily.
The new Stanford Daily Pub
lishing Board would consist of
the editor, business manager,
ASSU student financial mana
ger, two students appointed by
the legislature, and two employ
ees of the university who are
not registered students.
The board will have the power
to dismiss the editor if five mem
bers of the board favor it. The
board will also set salaries and
supervise the election of the
editor.
In other action, the legislature
chose Denis Hayes as the stu
dent body president for Summer
Quarter. Hayes is ASSU presi
dent-elect for the academic year
1968-69. Charles Countee was
elected vice-president. Countee
is co-chairman of the Black Stu
dents Union.
They also took action on the
appointment of five non-voting
student members for the Aca
demic Council. The ASSU presi
dent will serve as one of the
members. The other members
will be two graduate students
and two undergraduates chosen
by the legislature. Applications
for the four positions should be
made to the legislature.
The legislature further pass
ed a resolution expressing its
"Sincere thanks" to President
Wallace Sterling who is retiring
before next Fall.
A final topic of discussion at

the legislature was the proposed
coffeehouse. In the student elec
tions earlier this month the stu
dent body overwhelmingly ap
proved the initiation of a stu
dent-run coffee house. The ref
erendum stated that the old fire
house would be an ideal place for
the new enterprise.
However, vice-president-elect
Vic von Schlegal stated that
there was some doubt whether
the firehouse would be a feasible
location. There is a serious ques
tion whether the old building is
a fire trap.
