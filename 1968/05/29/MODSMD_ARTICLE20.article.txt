# Student Team Plans Satellite

### 
An "Earth Resources Satel
lite System" to map the entire
world's land and sea wealth is
being proposed by a Stanford
University team of 75 students
representing a wide variety of
engineering, scientific, and so
cial study fields.
Plans for the system, called
"DEMETER" after the Greek
goddess of agriculture, will be
presented to government and
aerospace industry representa
tives by the students at a three
hour campus meeting Tuesday
afternoon, June 4.
"The system Is designed to
observe, from an earth satel
lite, all of the earth's agricul
tural, geological, hydrological,
oceanographic and atmospher
ic resources," said the student
planners.
"Regular and continuing ob
servation of these riches will
lead to their more effective man
agement and efficient utilization.
"For example, the proposed
system could spot crop diseases
before entire districts became in
fested. Appropriate control mea
sures could be applied in time
to aid a world faced with grow
ing food crises and could save
billions of dollars worth of ag
ricultural products each year."
The earth resources satellite
plan is the product of a six
month course in Space Systems
Engineering designed to give
students the "feel" of planning
a major engineering project.
In previous years the stu
dent teams have designed
world sateUlte weather sys
tems, global educational TV
systems, and Mars probes.
Their work has received na
tional and International recog
nition. Some of their ideas
have later appeared In ac
tual space programs.
The course is under the direc
tion of Prof. Bruce Lusignan of
the Electrical Engineering De
partment. Assisting him as fac
ulty advisers were: Prof. James
L. Adams, Mechanical Engineer
ing; Prof. John V. Breakwell,
Aeronautical Engineering; Aldo
V. Da√üosa and Daniel B. De-
Bra, Electrical Engineering;
Thomas Ehrlich, Law; Prof. Rob
ert A. Hammes, Industrial En
gineering; and Roger S. Vick
ers, Mineral Engineering.
