# University Teaching: Are Profs Trapped?
## 
### JACK KAPLAN 
Arguments abound at Stanford
and elsewhere on the quality of
instruction at a university. Opin
ions vary from one extreme to
- the other and, due to the sub
jectivity and complexity of such
an evaluation, agreement will
never be reached.
The outlook for achieving
agreement is brighter, however,
on the related but narrower
question: Are professors inter
ested in teaching?
One dubious way of tack
ling this issue Is to ask 100
or 1000 professors, "Are you
Interested in research only,
teaching only, or both teach
ing and research?" The results
would certainly be reassuring
to any student who took them
seriously.
A better way is to inquire into
job opportunities for intellect
uals in the United States, and
find out if there are powerful

reasons for a hypothetical scho
lar, respected in his field hut
uninterested in teaching, to wind
up on a college faculty.
Interviews conducted with
Stanford professors of econo
mics, English, and mathematics
show that, indeed, universities
are sufficiently more appealing
than the other opportunities
open to scholars that they are
likely to attract people who
would prefer not to teach. In
fact, of the three departments
investigated, there seems to be
a real alternative to a univer
sity position only in the field
of economics.
I told matheamttcs profes
sor David Gilbarg that I
wanted to speak with mathe
maticians prominent enough
to have a wide variety of op
portunities, so that I could
ask them why they chose a
university over government
and industry. He shook his

head sadly and said, "You
don't understand what goes
on."
I asked English professor
Thomas Moser why he chose to
work at a university. After he
finished laughing, he answered
that the only reason to get a
Ph.D. in English is to work at a
university.
The following summaries are
the results of interviews with
Professors Paul Berg, Executive
Head David Gilbarg, and Sam
uel Karlin from mathematics;
Robert Ackerman, Executive
Head Thomas Moser, and Wal
lace Stegner from English; G.
L. Bach, Melvin Reder, Edward
Shaw and Executive Head Lorie
Tarshis from economics.
MATH DEPARTMENT
The need for mathematicians
in government and industry is
very great in a wide variety of
fields requiring quantitative ana
lysis. However, virtually no pure
research is done outside the uni
versity, according to all three
math professors. Furthermore,
according to Professor Berg,
even the applied, mission-orient-

Ed research is of a lower qual
ity in government and industry
than at universities, especially
in the area of error analysis.
A few organizations have
established positions for math
ematicians with wide freodom
to work on the research they
wish. However, both Karlin
and Gilbarg claimed that even
In such positions the freedom
is limited in effect, partly be
cause of "conscience," a sense
of duty to help with the proj
ect.
Salaries at universities have
been growing and are now ap
proximately at the level of other
organizations.
All three agreed that the best,
most creative mathematicians
are at universities. Karlin add
ed that some of the best work
being done in government and
industry has been stimulated by
consultations with professors.
Gilbarg feels that industrial and
government work does not re
quire the top talent.
Thus, whether or not a tal
ented mathematician wants to
teach, he is liable to end up on

a university faculty.
All three professors expressed
positive attitudes towards teach
ing. Gilbarg said that research,
with its ups and downs, can be
depressing, and that teaching
gives a second justification for
existence. Karlin differentiated
between graduate and under
graduate teaching. He said he
enjoyed training new creative
talent (graduate teaching), and
that he has a "positive reaction'
to teach undergraduates, whom
he finds "bright and eager." Berg
and Karlin both staged that much
less class preparation is required
for teaching an undergraduate
course- than for teaching gradu
ates.
ENGLISH DEPARTMENT
The State Department, Of
fice of Education, Library of
Congress, and other govern
ment and non - government
agencies need people who can
write well, and offer positions
to English Ph.D.'s, according
to Dr. Ackerman. Also, philol
ogists are needed for writing
dictionaries. Publishing firms
generally do not need people
with more than a master's de
gree, according to Moser. For
anyone interested in doing re
search, though, aside from
some linguistic research there
is virtually no opportunity out
side the university.
Moser stated that profits from
books and articles of literary
criticism are not enough to live
on. Stegner said the same about
all but th 1 most successful cre
ative writers. Sterner added that
journalism used to be a major
source of income for creative
writers, but that university work
is more common now.
Thus, an English scholar who
is not interested in teaching
would also be very likoly to end
up as a college facultv member.
ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT
Only in this department (of
the three) is there commonly a
difficult choice between universi
ties and other organizations.
There are a substantial num
ber of government and private
organizations which need eco
nomists. Rand Corporation In
Santa Monica, California, and
Brookings Institute in Wash
ington D.C. were the most fre
quently mentioned govern
ment and private organiza
tions, respectively, which en
gage in economic research.
Tarshis estimated that Rand
has 150 economists, Brookings
40-50, and the Stanford Re
search Institute 150. There
are three members of the
Council of Economic Advisers

and a staff of about 20. In ad
dition, economists are hired by
some business firms (IBM,
Ford, Bank of America) and
International agencies (World
Bank, International Monetary
Fund).
The consensus of the four pro
fessors is that the principal econ
omists are mainly at universities,
but that there are many excel
lent economists elsewhere. The
four also agreed that there is
much freedom in some positions
for economists outside the uni
versity, but that in other posi
tions they are compelled to work
on certain projects, and that no
where is there quite as much
freedom for research as in the
university.
Yearly salaries are often high
er outside the university, but the
money is usually for almost
12 months of work instead of
nine.
All but one of the four agreed
that research for the sake of
knowledge has priority over in
fluencing policy for most econ
omists.
Thus, a top economist not
Interested in teaching would
have a genuine alternative to
a university position. He might
accept a faculty position In
order to enjoy the greater free
dom, or he might go to a re
search organization where he
can devote full time to re
search at a somewhat higher
salary, free from the burdens
of teaching. (Other factors
may also influence the deci
sion, of course).
It should be mentioned also
that an economist at Stanford
can "buy back teaching time,"
according to Shaw. If he is sup
ported partly by research grants,
he may relinquish some of his
salary to hire a substitute teach
er.
Stanford's Kenneth Arrow,
whom Shaw calls the number
one economist in the country,
teaches three courses instead
of the usual five, according to
Shaw. Shaw added, though, that
Arrow has the largest load of
doctoral candidates.
I asked Professors Bach,
Shaw and Reder why they per
sonally chose a university over
the other options.
Bach answered that in a uni
versity he can have all the in
volvement he desires in business
and industry (he estimates that
he spends perhaps eight hours
a week on outside government
work and consulting) as well as
be part of a university, whereas
being in government pretty ef
fectively cuts a person off from

universities.
He explained, though, that
the alternatives are mainly
open to those who have al
ready acquired a reputation,
and that university econo
mists would not have m much
opportunity for outside con
tacts. Bach mentioned several
aspects of a university which
Influenced his decision.
There is, according to Bach,
more status in a university than
in a research organization.
He enjoys the freedom to
switch interests. He does not
want to spend all his time on
research, but enjoys teaching
and sitting on committees. He
also enjoys the access to grad
uate students and the interac
tion with people in other fields,
both largely absent outside the
university .
Shaw, who has worked in
business and who nearly ac
cepted offers from Hand and
Brookings, said he chose a
university mainly because he
enjoyed teaching, and also be
cause of the variety and lack
of restrictions at a university.
Rcder listed two primary rea
sons for his choice. First, the
attraction of graduate students.
Top quality graduate students
stimulate a professor's research,
make better research assistants
than are found in corporations,
and extend the influence of the
professor's ideas when they take
up research similar to the pro
fessor under whom they studied.
Secondly, he mentioned the free
dom a professor has to pursue
his own interests.
Independent evidence that the
top people in these three rep
resentative fields have few ap
pealing alternatives to the uni
versity is provided by the kinds
of positions held by recent Stan
ford Ph.D. winners.
The Math department keeps
no formal record of the where
abouts of its graduates, but
Berg, who says he knew almost
all of last year's 22 math Ph.D.'s,
could think of no one who was
not either in a university or
planning on accepting an aca
demic position after post-doc
toral study. Ackerman estimates
that 95 per cent of Stanford's
English Ph.D.'s join faculties.
Tarshls estimates the figure for
the Economics department is
90 per cent.
The evidence, then, is clear. If
there exists in this country tal
ented mathematicians, English
scholars or economists interest
ed in research but not teaching,
then they will probably be found
on the faculty of a university.
Arguments abound at Stanford
and elsewhere on the quality of
instruction at a university. Opin
ions vary from one extreme to

I told matheamttcs profes
sor David Gilbarg that I
wanted to speak with mathe
maticians prominent enough
to have a wide variety of op
portunities, so that I could
ask them why they chose a
university over government
and industry. He shook his

head sadly and said, "You
don't understand what goes
on."
I asked English professor
Thomas Moser why he chose to
work at a university. After he
finished laughing, he answered
that the only reason to get a
Ph.D. in English is to work at a
university.
The following summaries are
the results of interviews with
Professors Paul Berg, Executive
Head David Gilbarg, and Sam
uel Karlin from mathematics;
Robert Ackerman, Executive
Head Thomas Moser, and Wal

L. Bach, Melvin Reder, Edward
Shaw and Executive Head Lorie
Tarshis from economics.
MATH DEPARTMENT
The need for mathematicians
in government and industry is
very great in a wide variety of
fields requiring quantitative ana
lysis. However, virtually no pure
research is done outside the uni
versity, according to all three
math professors. Furthermore,
according to Professor Berg,
even the applied, mission-orient-

Ed research is of a lower qual
ity in government and industry
than at universities, especially
in the area of error analysis.
A few organizations have
established positions for math
ematicians with wide freodom
to work on the research they
wish. However, both Karlin
and Gilbarg claimed that even
In such positions the freedom
is limited in effect, partly be
cause of "conscience," a sense
of duty to help with the proj
ect.
Salaries at universities have
been growing and are now ap
proximately at the level of other
organizations.
All three agreed that the best,
most creative mathematicians
are at universities. Karlin add
ed that some of the best work
being done in government and
industry has been stimulated by
consultations with professors.
Gilbarg feels that industrial and
government work does not re
quire the top talent.
Thus, whether or not a tal
ented mathematician wants to
teach, he is liable to end up on

a university faculty.
All three professors expressed
positive attitudes towards teach
ing. Gilbarg said that research,
with its ups and downs, can be
depressing, and that teaching
gives a second justification for
existence. Karlin differentiated
between graduate and under
graduate teaching. He said he
enjoyed training new creative
talent (graduate teaching), and
that he has a "positive reaction'
to teach undergraduates, whom
he finds "bright and eager." Berg
and Karlin both staged that much
less class preparation is required
for teaching an undergraduate
course- than for teaching gradu
ates.
ENGLISH DEPARTMENT
The State Department, Of
fice of Education, Library of
Congress, and other govern
ment and non - government
agencies need people who can
write well, and offer positions
to English Ph.D.'s, according
to Dr. Ackerman. Also, philol
ogists are needed for writing
dictionaries. Publishing firms
generally do not need people
with more than a master's de
gree, according to Moser. For
anyone interested in doing re
search, though, aside from
some linguistic research there
is virtually no opportunity out
side the university.
Moser stated that profits from
books and articles of literary
criticism are not enough to live
on. Stegner said the same about
all but th 1 most successful cre
ative writers. Sterner added that
journalism used to be a major
source of income for creative
writers, but that university work
is more common now.
Thus, an English scholar who
is not interested in teaching
would also be very likoly to end
up as a college facultv member.
ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT
Only in this department (of
the three) is there commonly a
difficult choice between universi
ties and other organizations.
There are a substantial num
ber of government and private
organizations which need eco
nomists. Rand Corporation In
Santa Monica, California, and
Brookings Institute in Wash
ington D.C. were the most fre
quently mentioned govern
ment and private organiza
tions, respectively, which en
gage in economic research.
Tarshis estimated that Rand
has 150 economists, Brookings
40-50, and the Stanford Re
search Institute 150. There
are three members of the
Council of Economic Advisers

and a staff of about 20. In ad
dition, economists are hired by
some business firms (IBM,
Ford, Bank of America) and
International agencies (World
Bank, International Monetary
Fund).
The consensus of the four pro
fessors is that the principal econ
omists are mainly at universities,
but that there are many excel
lent economists elsewhere. The
four also agreed that there is
much freedom in some positions
for economists outside the uni
versity, but that in other posi
tions they are compelled to work
on certain projects, and that no
where is there quite as much
freedom for research as in the
university.
Yearly salaries are often high
er outside the university, but the
money is usually for almost
12 months of work instead of
nine.
All but one of the four agreed
that research for the sake of
knowledge has priority over in
fluencing policy for most econ
omists.
Thus, a top economist not
Interested in teaching would
have a genuine alternative to
a university position. He might
accept a faculty position In
order to enjoy the greater free
dom, or he might go to a re
search organization where he
can devote full time to re
search at a somewhat higher
salary, free from the burdens
of teaching. (Other factors
may also influence the deci
sion, of course).
It should be mentioned also
that an economist at Stanford
can "buy back teaching time,"
according to Shaw. If he is sup
ported partly by research grants,
he may relinquish some of his
salary to hire a substitute teach
er.
Stanford's Kenneth Arrow,
whom Shaw calls the number
one economist in the country,
teaches three courses instead
of the usual five, according to
Shaw. Shaw added, though, that
Arrow has the largest load of
doctoral candidates.
I asked Professors Bach,
Shaw and Reder why they per
sonally chose a university over
the other options.
Bach answered that in a uni
versity he can have all the in
volvement he desires in business
and industry (he estimates that
he spends perhaps eight hours
a week on outside government
work and consulting) as well as
be part of a university, whereas
being in government pretty ef
fectively cuts a person off from

universities.
He explained, though, that
the alternatives are mainly
open to those who have al
ready acquired a reputation,
and that university econo
mists would not have m much
opportunity for outside con
tacts. Bach mentioned several
aspects of a university which
Influenced his decision.
There is, according to Bach,
more status in a university than
in a research organization.
He enjoys the freedom to
switch interests. He does not
want to spend all his time on
research, but enjoys teaching
and sitting on committees. He
also enjoys the access to grad
uate students and the interac
tion with people in other fields,
both largely absent outside the
university .
Shaw, who has worked in
business and who nearly ac
cepted offers from Hand and
Brookings, said he chose a
university mainly because he
enjoyed teaching, and also be
cause of the variety and lack
of restrictions at a university.
Rcder listed two primary rea
sons for his choice. First, the
attraction of graduate students.
Top quality graduate students
stimulate a professor's research,
make better research assistants
than are found in corporations,
and extend the influence of the
professor's ideas when they take
up research similar to the pro
fessor under whom they studied.
Secondly, he mentioned the free
dom a professor has to pursue
his own interests.
Independent evidence that the
top people in these three rep
resentative fields have few ap
pealing alternatives to the uni
versity is provided by the kinds
of positions held by recent Stan
ford Ph.D. winners.
The Math department keeps
no formal record of the where
abouts of its graduates, but
Berg, who says he knew almost
all of last year's 22 math Ph.D.'s,
could think of no one who was
not either in a university or
planning on accepting an aca
demic position after post-doc
toral study. Ackerman estimates
that 95 per cent of Stanford's
English Ph.D.'s join faculties.
Tarshls estimates the figure for
the Economics department is
90 per cent.
The evidence, then, is clear. If
there exists in this country tal
ented mathematicians, English
scholars or economists interest
ed in research but not teaching,
then they will probably be found
on the faculty of a university.
Arguments abound at Stanford
and elsewhere on the quality of
instruction at a university. Opin
ions vary from one extreme to
- the other and, due to the sub
jectivity and complexity of such
an evaluation, agreement will
never be reached.
The outlook for achieving
agreement is brighter, however,
on the related but narrower
question: Are professors inter
ested in teaching?
One dubious way of tack
ling this issue Is to ask 100
or 1000 professors, "Are you
Interested in research only,
teaching only, or both teach
ing and research?" The results
would certainly be reassuring
to any student who took them
seriously.
A better way is to inquire into
job opportunities for intellect
uals in the United States, and
find out if there are powerful

reasons for a hypothetical scho
lar, respected in his field hut
uninterested in teaching, to wind

I told matheamttcs profes
sor David Gilbarg that I
wanted to speak with mathe
maticians prominent enough
to have a wide variety of op
portunities, so that I could
ask them why they chose a
university over government
and industry. He shook his

head sadly and said, "You
don't understand what goes
on."
I asked English professor
Thomas Moser why he chose to
work at a university. After he
finished laughing, he answered
that the only reason to get a
Ph.D. in English is to work at a
university.
The following summaries are
the results of interviews with
Professors Paul Berg, Executive
Head David Gilbarg, and Sam

Robert Ackerman, Executive
Head Thomas Moser, and Wal

Shaw and Executive Head Lorie
Tarshis from economics.
MATH DEPARTMENT
The need for mathematicians
in government and industry is
very great in a wide variety of
fields requiring quantitative ana
lysis. However, virtually no pure
research is done outside the uni
versity, according to all three
math professors. Furthermore,
according to Professor Berg,
even the applied, mission-orient-

Ed research is of a lower qual
ity in government and industry
than at universities, especially
in the area of error analysis.
A few organizations have
established positions for math
ematicians with wide freodom
to work on the research they
wish. However, both Karlin
and Gilbarg claimed that even
In such positions the freedom
is limited in effect, partly be
cause of "conscience," a sense
of duty to help with the proj
ect.
Salaries at universities have
been growing and are now ap
proximately at the level of other
organizations.
All three agreed that the best,
most creative mathematicians
are at universities. Karlin add
ed that some of the best work
being done in government and
industry has been stimulated by
consultations with professors.
Gilbarg feels that industrial and
government work does not re
quire the top talent.
Thus, whether or not a tal
ented mathematician wants to
teach, he is liable to end up on

a university faculty.
All three professors expressed
positive attitudes towards teach
ing. Gilbarg said that research,
with its ups and downs, can be
depressing, and that teaching
gives a second justification for
existence. Karlin differentiated
between graduate and under
graduate teaching. He said he
enjoyed training new creative
talent (graduate teaching), and
that he has a "positive reaction'
to teach undergraduates, whom
he finds "bright and eager." Berg
and Karlin both staged that much
less class preparation is required
for teaching an undergraduate
course- than for teaching gradu
ates.
ENGLISH DEPARTMENT
The State Department, Of
fice of Education, Library of
Congress, and other govern
ment and non - government
agencies need people who can
write well, and offer positions
to English Ph.D.'s, according
to Dr. Ackerman. Also, philol
ogists are needed for writing
dictionaries. Publishing firms
generally do not need people
with more than a master's de
gree, according to Moser. For
anyone interested in doing re
search, though, aside from
some linguistic research there
is virtually no opportunity out
side the university.
Moser stated that profits from
books and articles of literary
criticism are not enough to live
on. Stegner said the same about
all but th 1 most successful cre
ative writers. Sterner added that
journalism used to be a major
source of income for creative
writers, but that university work
is more common now.
Thus, an English scholar who
is not interested in teaching
would also be very likoly to end
up as a college facultv member.
ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT
Only in this department (of
the three) is there commonly a
difficult choice between universi
ties and other organizations.
There are a substantial num
ber of government and private
organizations which need eco
nomists. Rand Corporation In
Santa Monica, California, and
Brookings Institute in Wash
ington D.C. were the most fre
quently mentioned govern
ment and private organiza
tions, respectively, which en
gage in economic research.
Tarshis estimated that Rand
has 150 economists, Brookings
40-50, and the Stanford Re
search Institute 150. There
are three members of the
Council of Economic Advisers

and a staff of about 20. In ad
dition, economists are hired by
some business firms (IBM,
Ford, Bank of America) and
International agencies (World
Bank, International Monetary
Fund).
The consensus of the four pro
fessors is that the principal econ
omists are mainly at universities,
but that there are many excel
lent economists elsewhere. The
four also agreed that there is
much freedom in some positions
for economists outside the uni
versity, but that in other posi
tions they are compelled to work
on certain projects, and that no
where is there quite as much
freedom for research as in the
university.
Yearly salaries are often high
er outside the university, but the
money is usually for almost
12 months of work instead of
nine.
All but one of the four agreed
that research for the sake of
knowledge has priority over in
fluencing policy for most econ
omists.
Thus, a top economist not
Interested in teaching would
have a genuine alternative to
a university position. He might
accept a faculty position In
order to enjoy the greater free
dom, or he might go to a re
search organization where he
can devote full time to re
search at a somewhat higher
salary, free from the burdens
of teaching. (Other factors
may also influence the deci
sion, of course).
It should be mentioned also
that an economist at Stanford
can "buy back teaching time,"
according to Shaw. If he is sup
ported partly by research grants,
he may relinquish some of his
salary to hire a substitute teach
er.
Stanford's Kenneth Arrow,
whom Shaw calls the number
one economist in the country,
teaches three courses instead
of the usual five, according to
Shaw. Shaw added, though, that
Arrow has the largest load of
doctoral candidates.
I asked Professors Bach,
Shaw and Reder why they per
sonally chose a university over
the other options.
Bach answered that in a uni
versity he can have all the in
volvement he desires in business
and industry (he estimates that
he spends perhaps eight hours
a week on outside government
work and consulting) as well as
be part of a university, whereas
being in government pretty ef
fectively cuts a person off from

universities.
He explained, though, that
the alternatives are mainly
open to those who have al
ready acquired a reputation,
and that university econo
mists would not have m much
opportunity for outside con
tacts. Bach mentioned several
aspects of a university which
Influenced his decision.
There is, according to Bach,
more status in a university than
in a research organization.
He enjoys the freedom to
switch interests. He does not
want to spend all his time on
research, but enjoys teaching
and sitting on committees. He
also enjoys the access to grad
uate students and the interac
tion with people in other fields,
both largely absent outside the
university .
Shaw, who has worked in
business and who nearly ac
cepted offers from Hand and
Brookings, said he chose a
university mainly because he
enjoyed teaching, and also be
cause of the variety and lack
of restrictions at a university.
Rcder listed two primary rea
sons for his choice. First, the
attraction of graduate students.
Top quality graduate students
stimulate a professor's research,
make better research assistants
than are found in corporations,
and extend the influence of the
professor's ideas when they take
up research similar to the pro
fessor under whom they studied.
Secondly, he mentioned the free
dom a professor has to pursue
his own interests.
Independent evidence that the
top people in these three rep
resentative fields have few ap
pealing alternatives to the uni
versity is provided by the kinds
of positions held by recent Stan
ford Ph.D. winners.
The Math department keeps
no formal record of the where
abouts of its graduates, but
Berg, who says he knew almost
all of last year's 22 math Ph.D.'s,
could think of no one who was
not either in a university or
planning on accepting an aca
demic position after post-doc
toral study. Ackerman estimates
that 95 per cent of Stanford's
English Ph.D.'s join faculties.
Tarshls estimates the figure for
the Economics department is
90 per cent.
The evidence, then, is clear. If
there exists in this country tal
ented mathematicians, English
scholars or economists interest
ed in research but not teaching,
then they will probably be found
on the faculty of a university.
Arguments abound at Stanford
and elsewhere on the quality of
instruction at a university. Opin
ions vary from one extreme to
- the other and, due to the sub
jectivity and complexity of such
an evaluation, agreement will
never be reached.
The outlook for achieving
agreement is brighter, however,
on the related but narrower
question: Are professors inter
ested in teaching?
One dubious way of tack
ling this issue Is to ask 100
or 1000 professors, "Are you
Interested in research only,
teaching only, or both teach
ing and research?" The results
would certainly be reassuring
to any student who took them
seriously.
A better way is to inquire into
job opportunities for intellect
uals in the United States, and
find out if there are powerful

reasons for a hypothetical scho
lar, respected in his field hut
uninterested in teaching, to wind
up on a college faculty.
Interviews conducted with
Stanford professors of econo
mics, English, and mathematics
show that, indeed, universities
are sufficiently more appealing
than the other opportunities
open to scholars that they are
likely to attract people who
would prefer not to teach. In
fact, of the three departments
investigated, there seems to be
a real alternative to a univer
sity position only in the field
of economics.

MATH DEPARTMENT
The need for mathematicians
in government and industry is
very great in a wide variety of
fields requiring quantitative ana
lysis. However, virtually no pure
research is done outside the uni
versity, according to all three
math professors. Furthermore,
according to Professor Berg,
even the applied, mission-orient-

Ed research is of a lower qual
ity in government and industry
than at universities, especially
in the area of error analysis.
A few organizations have
established positions for math
ematicians with wide freodom
to work on the research they
wish. However, both Karlin
and Gilbarg claimed that even
In such positions the freedom
is limited in effect, partly be
cause of "conscience," a sense
of duty to help with the proj
ect.
Salaries at universities have
been growing and are now ap
proximately at the level of other
organizations.
All three agreed that the best,
most creative mathematicians
are at universities. Karlin add
ed that some of the best work
being done in government and
industry has been stimulated by
consultations with professors.
Gilbarg feels that industrial and
government work does not re
quire the top talent.
Thus, whether or not a tal
ented mathematician wants to
teach, he is liable to end up on

a university faculty.
All three professors expressed
positive attitudes towards teach
ing. Gilbarg said that research,
with its ups and downs, can be
depressing, and that teaching
gives a second justification for
existence. Karlin differentiated
between graduate and under
graduate teaching. He said he
enjoyed training new creative
talent (graduate teaching), and
that he has a "positive reaction'
to teach undergraduates, whom
he finds "bright and eager." Berg
and Karlin both staged that much
less class preparation is required
for teaching an undergraduate
course- than for teaching gradu
ates.
ENGLISH DEPARTMENT
The State Department, Of
fice of Education, Library of
Congress, and other govern
ment and non - government
agencies need people who can
write well, and offer positions
to English Ph.D.'s, according
to Dr. Ackerman. Also, philol
ogists are needed for writing
dictionaries. Publishing firms
generally do not need people
with more than a master's de
gree, according to Moser. For
anyone interested in doing re
search, though, aside from
some linguistic research there
is virtually no opportunity out
side the university.
Moser stated that profits from
books and articles of literary
criticism are not enough to live
on. Stegner said the same about
all but th 1 most successful cre
ative writers. Sterner added that
journalism used to be a major
source of income for creative
writers, but that university work
is more common now.
Thus, an English scholar who
is not interested in teaching
would also be very likoly to end
up as a college facultv member.
ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT
Only in this department (of
the three) is there commonly a
difficult choice between universi
ties and other organizations.
There are a substantial num
ber of government and private
organizations which need eco
nomists. Rand Corporation In
Santa Monica, California, and
Brookings Institute in Wash
ington D.C. were the most fre
quently mentioned govern
ment and private organiza
tions, respectively, which en
gage in economic research.
Tarshis estimated that Rand
has 150 economists, Brookings
40-50, and the Stanford Re
search Institute 150. There
are three members of the
Council of Economic Advisers

and a staff of about 20. In ad
dition, economists are hired by
some business firms (IBM,
Ford, Bank of America) and
International agencies (World
Bank, International Monetary
Fund).
The consensus of the four pro
fessors is that the principal econ
omists are mainly at universities,
but that there are many excel
lent economists elsewhere. The
four also agreed that there is
much freedom in some positions
for economists outside the uni
versity, but that in other posi
tions they are compelled to work
on certain projects, and that no
where is there quite as much
freedom for research as in the
university.
Yearly salaries are often high
er outside the university, but the
money is usually for almost
12 months of work instead of
nine.
All but one of the four agreed
that research for the sake of
knowledge has priority over in
fluencing policy for most econ
omists.
Thus, a top economist not
Interested in teaching would
have a genuine alternative to
a university position. He might
accept a faculty position In
order to enjoy the greater free
dom, or he might go to a re
search organization where he
can devote full time to re
search at a somewhat higher
salary, free from the burdens
of teaching. (Other factors
may also influence the deci
sion, of course).
It should be mentioned also
that an economist at Stanford
can "buy back teaching time,"
according to Shaw. If he is sup
ported partly by research grants,
he may relinquish some of his
salary to hire a substitute teach
er.
Stanford's Kenneth Arrow,
whom Shaw calls the number
one economist in the country,
teaches three courses instead
of the usual five, according to
Shaw. Shaw added, though, that
Arrow has the largest load of
doctoral candidates.
I asked Professors Bach,
Shaw and Reder why they per
sonally chose a university over
the other options.
Bach answered that in a uni
versity he can have all the in
volvement he desires in business
and industry (he estimates that
he spends perhaps eight hours
a week on outside government
work and consulting) as well as
be part of a university, whereas
being in government pretty ef
fectively cuts a person off from

universities.
He explained, though, that
the alternatives are mainly
open to those who have al
ready acquired a reputation,
and that university econo
mists would not have m much
opportunity for outside con
tacts. Bach mentioned several
aspects of a university which
Influenced his decision.
There is, according to Bach,
more status in a university than
in a research organization.
He enjoys the freedom to
switch interests. He does not
want to spend all his time on
research, but enjoys teaching
and sitting on committees. He
also enjoys the access to grad
uate students and the interac
tion with people in other fields,
both largely absent outside the
university .
Shaw, who has worked in
business and who nearly ac
cepted offers from Hand and
Brookings, said he chose a
university mainly because he
enjoyed teaching, and also be
cause of the variety and lack
of restrictions at a university.
Rcder listed two primary rea
sons for his choice. First, the
attraction of graduate students.
Top quality graduate students
stimulate a professor's research,
make better research assistants
than are found in corporations,
and extend the influence of the
professor's ideas when they take
up research similar to the pro
fessor under whom they studied.
Secondly, he mentioned the free
dom a professor has to pursue
his own interests.
Independent evidence that the
top people in these three rep
resentative fields have few ap
pealing alternatives to the uni
versity is provided by the kinds
of positions held by recent Stan
ford Ph.D. winners.
The Math department keeps
no formal record of the where
abouts of its graduates, but
Berg, who says he knew almost
all of last year's 22 math Ph.D.'s,
could think of no one who was
not either in a university or
planning on accepting an aca
demic position after post-doc
toral study. Ackerman estimates
that 95 per cent of Stanford's
English Ph.D.'s join faculties.
Tarshls estimates the figure for
the Economics department is
90 per cent.
The evidence, then, is clear. If
there exists in this country tal
ented mathematicians, English
scholars or economists interest
ed in research but not teaching,
then they will probably be found
on the faculty of a university.
Arguments abound at Stanford
and elsewhere on the quality of
instruction at a university. Opin
ions vary from one extreme to
- the other and, due to the sub
jectivity and complexity of such
an evaluation, agreement will
never be reached.
The outlook for achieving
agreement is brighter, however,
on the related but narrower
question: Are professors inter
ested in teaching?
One dubious way of tack
ling this issue Is to ask 100
or 1000 professors, "Are you
Interested in research only,
teaching only, or both teach
ing and research?" The results
would certainly be reassuring
to any student who took them
seriously.
A better way is to inquire into
job opportunities for intellect
uals in the United States, and
find out if there are powerful

reasons for a hypothetical scho
lar, respected in his field hut
uninterested in teaching, to wind
up on a college faculty.
Interviews conducted with
Stanford professors of econo
mics, English, and mathematics
show that, indeed, universities
are sufficiently more appealing
than the other opportunities
open to scholars that they are
likely to attract people who
would prefer not to teach. In
fact, of the three departments
investigated, there seems to be
a real alternative to a univer
sity position only in the field
of economics.
I told matheamttcs profes
sor David Gilbarg that I
wanted to speak with mathe
maticians prominent enough
to have a wide variety of op
portunities, so that I could
ask them why they chose a
university over government
and industry. He shook his

head sadly and said, "You
don't understand what goes
on."
I asked English professor
Thomas Moser why he chose to
work at a university. After he
finished laughing, he answered
that the only reason to get a
Ph.D. in English is to work at a
university.

than at universities, especially
in the area of error analysis.
A few organizations have
established positions for math
ematicians with wide freodom
to work on the research they
wish. However, both Karlin
and Gilbarg claimed that even
In such positions the freedom
is limited in effect, partly be
cause of "conscience," a sense
of duty to help with the proj
ect.
Salaries at universities have
been growing and are now ap
proximately at the level of other
organizations.
All three agreed that the best,
most creative mathematicians
are at universities. Karlin add
ed that some of the best work
being done in government and
industry has been stimulated by
consultations with professors.
Gilbarg feels that industrial and
government work does not re
quire the top talent.
Thus, whether or not a tal
ented mathematician wants to
teach, he is liable to end up on

a university faculty.
All three professors expressed
positive attitudes towards teach
ing. Gilbarg said that research,
with its ups and downs, can be
depressing, and that teaching
gives a second justification for
existence. Karlin differentiated
between graduate and under
graduate teaching. He said he
enjoyed training new creative
talent (graduate teaching), and
that he has a "positive reaction'
to teach undergraduates, whom
he finds "bright and eager." Berg
and Karlin both staged that much
less class preparation is required
for teaching an undergraduate
course- than for teaching gradu
ates.
ENGLISH DEPARTMENT
The State Department, Of
fice of Education, Library of
Congress, and other govern
ment and non - government
agencies need people who can
write well, and offer positions
to English Ph.D.'s, according
to Dr. Ackerman. Also, philol
ogists are needed for writing
dictionaries. Publishing firms
generally do not need people
with more than a master's de
gree, according to Moser. For
anyone interested in doing re
search, though, aside from
some linguistic research there
is virtually no opportunity out
side the university.
Moser stated that profits from
books and articles of literary
criticism are not enough to live
on. Stegner said the same about
all but th 1 most successful cre
ative writers. Sterner added that
journalism used to be a major
source of income for creative
writers, but that university work
is more common now.
Thus, an English scholar who
is not interested in teaching
would also be very likoly to end
up as a college facultv member.
ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT
Only in this department (of
the three) is there commonly a
difficult choice between universi
ties and other organizations.
There are a substantial num
ber of government and private
organizations which need eco
nomists. Rand Corporation In
Santa Monica, California, and
Brookings Institute in Wash
ington D.C. were the most fre
quently mentioned govern
ment and private organiza
tions, respectively, which en
gage in economic research.
Tarshis estimated that Rand
has 150 economists, Brookings
40-50, and the Stanford Re
search Institute 150. There
are three members of the
Council of Economic Advisers

and a staff of about 20. In ad
dition, economists are hired by
some business firms (IBM,
Ford, Bank of America) and
International agencies (World
Bank, International Monetary
Fund).
The consensus of the four pro
fessors is that the principal econ
omists are mainly at universities,
but that there are many excel
lent economists elsewhere. The
four also agreed that there is
much freedom in some positions
for economists outside the uni
versity, but that in other posi
tions they are compelled to work
on certain projects, and that no
where is there quite as much
freedom for research as in the
university.
Yearly salaries are often high
er outside the university, but the
money is usually for almost
12 months of work instead of
nine.
All but one of the four agreed
that research for the sake of
knowledge has priority over in
fluencing policy for most econ
omists.
Thus, a top economist not
Interested in teaching would
have a genuine alternative to
a university position. He might
accept a faculty position In
order to enjoy the greater free
dom, or he might go to a re
search organization where he
can devote full time to re
search at a somewhat higher
salary, free from the burdens
of teaching. (Other factors
may also influence the deci
sion, of course).
It should be mentioned also
that an economist at Stanford
can "buy back teaching time,"
according to Shaw. If he is sup
ported partly by research grants,
he may relinquish some of his
salary to hire a substitute teach
er.
Stanford's Kenneth Arrow,
whom Shaw calls the number
one economist in the country,
teaches three courses instead
of the usual five, according to
Shaw. Shaw added, though, that
Arrow has the largest load of
doctoral candidates.
I asked Professors Bach,
Shaw and Reder why they per
sonally chose a university over
the other options.
Bach answered that in a uni
versity he can have all the in
volvement he desires in business
and industry (he estimates that
he spends perhaps eight hours
a week on outside government
work and consulting) as well as
be part of a university, whereas
being in government pretty ef
fectively cuts a person off from

universities.
He explained, though, that
the alternatives are mainly
open to those who have al
ready acquired a reputation,
and that university econo
mists would not have m much
opportunity for outside con
tacts. Bach mentioned several
aspects of a university which
Influenced his decision.
There is, according to Bach,
more status in a university than
in a research organization.
He enjoys the freedom to
switch interests. He does not
want to spend all his time on
research, but enjoys teaching
and sitting on committees. He
also enjoys the access to grad
uate students and the interac
tion with people in other fields,
both largely absent outside the
university .
Shaw, who has worked in
business and who nearly ac
cepted offers from Hand and
Brookings, said he chose a
university mainly because he
enjoyed teaching, and also be
cause of the variety and lack
of restrictions at a university.
Rcder listed two primary rea
sons for his choice. First, the
attraction of graduate students.
Top quality graduate students
stimulate a professor's research,
make better research assistants
than are found in corporations,
and extend the influence of the
professor's ideas when they take
up research similar to the pro
fessor under whom they studied.
Secondly, he mentioned the free
dom a professor has to pursue
his own interests.
Independent evidence that the
top people in these three rep
resentative fields have few ap
pealing alternatives to the uni
versity is provided by the kinds
of positions held by recent Stan
ford Ph.D. winners.
The Math department keeps
no formal record of the where
abouts of its graduates, but
Berg, who says he knew almost
all of last year's 22 math Ph.D.'s,
could think of no one who was
not either in a university or
planning on accepting an aca
demic position after post-doc
toral study. Ackerman estimates
that 95 per cent of Stanford's
English Ph.D.'s join faculties.
Tarshls estimates the figure for
the Economics department is
90 per cent.
The evidence, then, is clear. If
there exists in this country tal
ented mathematicians, English
scholars or economists interest
ed in research but not teaching,
then they will probably be found
on the faculty of a university.
Arguments abound at Stanford
and elsewhere on the quality of
instruction at a university. Opin
ions vary from one extreme to
- the other and, due to the sub
jectivity and complexity of such
an evaluation, agreement will
never be reached.
The outlook for achieving
agreement is brighter, however,
on the related but narrower
question: Are professors inter
ested in teaching?
One dubious way of tack
ling this issue Is to ask 100
or 1000 professors, "Are you
Interested in research only,
teaching only, or both teach
ing and research?" The results
would certainly be reassuring
to any student who took them
seriously.
A better way is to inquire into
job opportunities for intellect
uals in the United States, and
find out if there are powerful

reasons for a hypothetical scho
lar, respected in his field hut
uninterested in teaching, to wind
up on a college faculty.
Interviews conducted with
Stanford professors of econo
mics, English, and mathematics
show that, indeed, universities
are sufficiently more appealing
than the other opportunities
open to scholars that they are
likely to attract people who
would prefer not to teach. In
fact, of the three departments
investigated, there seems to be
a real alternative to a univer
sity position only in the field
of economics.
I told matheamttcs profes
sor David Gilbarg that I
wanted to speak with mathe
maticians prominent enough
to have a wide variety of op
portunities, so that I could
ask them why they chose a
university over government
and industry. He shook his

head sadly and said, "You
don't understand what goes
on."
I asked English professor
Thomas Moser why he chose to
work at a university. After he
finished laughing, he answered
that the only reason to get a
Ph.D. in English is to work at a
university.
The following summaries are
the results of interviews with
Professors Paul Berg, Executive
Head David Gilbarg, and Sam
uel Karlin from mathematics;
Robert Ackerman, Executive
Head Thomas Moser, and Wal
lace Stegner from English; G.
L. Bach, Melvin Reder, Edward
Shaw and Executive Head Lorie
Tarshis from economics.
MATH DEPARTMENT
The need for mathematicians
in government and industry is
very great in a wide variety of
fields requiring quantitative ana
lysis. However, virtually no pure
research is done outside the uni
versity, according to all three
math professors. Furthermore,
according to Professor Berg,
even the applied, mission-orient-

in the area of error analysis.
A few organizations have
