# Four Jazz Groups At Concert Tonight
## 
### 
ASSU and the International
Club will sponsor an end-of-the
year jazz concert at the Interna
tional Center tonight featuring
current music from three Amer
ican cities.
Four groups, The Roscoe Mit
chell Trio from Chicago, the
Cecil Taylor Unit from New
York, the Oliver Johnson Quar
tet, and Cesare Massarenti's
Trio will play. The Stanford
community, says Oliver John
son, is invited to "participate
actively in the music, as the
artists hope to see a public that
doesn't simply sit and listen."
The four groups will provide
a wide variety of instruments
and music. According to John
son, "The music is everywhere
suspended, ready to be picked
up and moulded into your own
experience and feelings. We
take what was left in the air
and bring to your ears as we
hear it."
Johnson's group includes Joe
Halpin, bass, Donald Garrett,
reeds and flutes, Gerry Oshida,
tenor and flutes, and Johnson
on the drums.
Mitchell's music is also un
usual. "To explain our music?"
he asks. "You have to come and
listen, bring yourself into it.
Music communicates in musical
terms that you have to under
stand by relating to and with
the music itself."
His group includes Mitchell
playing reeds and bells, Lester

Bowie or harmonica, trumpet,
and bells, and Malachi Favors,
bass, marimba, and gongs.
Massarenti's trio was orga
nized only this year. The con
cert itself was planned by the
ASSU president, in order to
show to Stanford students "the
deep differences that exist be
tween the music produced in
New York, Chicago, and San
Francisco today, which have not
yet been clarified to the public."
Massarenti describes his
group's sound in terms similar
to the music itself:
"The death of European mu
ical contradiction, refuse Moz
art's note and opera-house-ballet
minky publicâ€”as perpetrated
portrayed expounded by a Euro
pean instructed by his conserva
tory in not knowing the exist
ence of other notes sounds
rhythms."
Cecil Taylor has already been
on campus for two weeks this
year. His group includes Frank
Wright, tenor, Jimmy Lyons,
alto, Alan Silva, bass, Andrew
Cyrille, drums, and Taylor on
the piano.
Taylor describes his music
this way: "The first level or
statement of three: an opening
field of question, how large it
ought or ought not to be. Pat
terns and possibility converge,
mountain ride to dry rock beds;
content, quality and change,
growth in addition to direction
found."
