# Gov't Denies Financial Aid, Hinders Academic Freedom
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (CPS) â€” U.S.
Commissioner of Education
Hirold Howe II says the at
tempts by Congress to deny fed
eral financial assistance to stu
dents who participate in unlaw
ful demonstrations could pose a
serious threat to academic free
dom.
"If the federal government
starts involving itself in the in

ternal affairs of colleges and
universities" by deciding who
will receive federal support, the
net effect will be "to create a
kind of entrance into the inter
nal affairs of the institution
which could be followed by the
federal government getting in
terested in who teaches there or
what is to be taught. Therefore,
I see a potential threat to aca

demic freedom," Howe said.
His remarks were made in a
special statement issued on re
quest by the Office of Education.
The statement refers to the
three amendments which the
House of Representatives at
tached to a bill extending the
four major student financial aid
programs for two years. The bill
has not reached the Senate.
One of the House-passed
amendments is designed to deny
federal funds to students who
refuse "to obey a lawful regu
lation or order of the university
or college . . . when such willful
refusal is certified ... to have
been of a serious nature and
contributed to the disruption of
the university or college admin
istration."
A second amendment applies
only to students convicted in
court of crimes related to the
seizure or trespass of school
property which prevents stu
dents or administrators "from
engaging in their duty or pur
suing their study." The final
amendment bars payments to
students convicted of participat
ing in riots.
Howe said he is strongly op
posed to the House action "be
cause it's unfair, because it's un
necessary, because it's tamper
ing in the internal affairs of col
leges in ways that the federal
government shouldn't do, and
because it can't work anyway."
