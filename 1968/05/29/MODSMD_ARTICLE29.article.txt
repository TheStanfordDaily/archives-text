ALL-STAR — Tribe defenseman Dennis McNeely (30) is shown
In action during a recent Stanford victory. McNeely and the rest of
the Indian defense — Mel Ellis, Wade Kiliefer and Bill Eakland —
was transferred intact to the NCLA All-Star squad, along with
attackman George Muser, and midfielders Dirk Speas and Bob
Hawkins.



-JUNIOR STANDOUTS — Fart of the optimism generated by Stanford's baseball future stems from
the three men pictured above — Don Rose (left), Mike Ammirato (center) and Sandy Vance (right).
Hard-throwing righthanders Rose and Vance (2.17 and 2.05 ERA's) will join staff ace Rod Poteete
to comprise the Tribe's "Big Three" next year. Ammirato, the brilliant second-baseman, had a .304
batting average and .953 fielding percentage before suffering a broken hand. Ammirato will team
with shortstop Russ Tweet to give the Indians a polished double-play combo next season.
