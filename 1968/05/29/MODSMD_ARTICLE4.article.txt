# Moynihan, Chavez
## Kennedy Supporters Speak 
### 
Daniel P. Moynihan, speaking
at Tresidder yesterday, and
Cesar Chavez, speaking at Me
morial Auditorium on Monday,
urged their audiences to vote
for Sen. Robert Kennedy in next
Tuesday's California Presiden
tial primary.
Moynihan, former Assistant
Secretary of Labor and author
of the controversial Moynihan
Report, said that Sen. Kennedy
is the man most capable of gov
erning the United States and
the man best able to effect the
changes needed.
Chavez boosted Kennedy as
the man most popular with the
minorities and the poor, and the
man who can do the most to
restore racial peace to America.
Chavez is the leader of the
striking grape-pickers in the
Central Valley.
"Either the Democrats will
nominate Robert Kennedy who
is committed to fundamental
changes in foreign and domestic
policy, and whose selection will
constitute a mandate for change,
or we'll elect Richard Nixon,"
Moynihan said. He also listed
Hubert Humphrey's receiving
the nomination as a third possi
bility.
"It seems to me that in the
present situation, the conflict in
the Democratic party today is
between Robert Kennedy and
Hubert Humphrey," said Moyni
han.

He continued that Humphrey
"is a representative of the pres
ent administration and its for
eign and domestic policies, in
extirpably committed to the
justification if not perpetuation
of those policies."
His election "can not stand in
the way of the mandate for
fundamental reversal (of those
policies) which this country
needs."
He dismissed McCarthy
as a good potential President. "In
a certain sense, Gene McCarthy
is an intellectual. However, I
certainly wouldn't want to live
in any country of which he was
President."
Referring to the efforts to
force President Johnson to re
sign, Moynihan said, "the ener
gies of the American political
system have to get back not to
the business of unseating gov
ernments, but to governing."
Chavez said that he was
speaking at Stanford both as an
individual and as a representa
tive of his union. "I was told by
the farm workers to support
Kennedy," he said.
He said, however, that the big
gest reason he was here "is
that the poor, for whatever
reasons there may be, are sup
porting Kennedy. They feel a
relationship with him.
"Some of it has to do with
his (Sen. Kennedy's) being
there and giving us help when
we needed help. Some of it is

the whole Kennedy, John Ken
nedy and Bobby, involvement
with the poor," he continued.
Chavez said that the support
Kennedy gave them was his
holding hearings in Delano, the
center of the strike area, to in
vestigate charges of police bru
tality and the red-baiting which
Chavez said members of the
right-wing had been doing.
Moynihan listed two prob'ems
which he fee's the next Admin
istration will have to face. First
is "the crisis of authority: the
legitimacy of social ord and
the viability of social arrange
ment."
According to Moynihan, the
second problem is that of the
racial harmony of the United
States.
"The next President of the
United States, the next Admin
istration is going to have to deal
with those problems. It seems
to me that it can do it only in
the context of a national man
date. To elect any of the men,
except Robert Kennedy, whose
election is possible at this time
would not constitute such a
mandate," he concluded.

MOYNIHAN â€” Daniel P. Moynlhan, former Assistant Secretary of
Labor, spoke yesterday at Tresidder advocating' Sen. Robert Ken
nedy aft the Democratic party's best choice for its Presidential nomi
nation.
