# McCarthy Committee Pleased With Victory
## 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
Members of the Stanford Com
mittee for McCarthy held a vic
tory celebration last night after
the news of the Minnesota Sen
ator's Oregon primary victory.
Instead of shouting with glee,
they were issued calm instruc
tions about the canvassing sche
dules for the next week and cam
paign rallies.
The spirit at the meeting was
one of happiness: happiness over
the fact that all their efforts
over the past months had not
been wasted and that their can
didate was on~e again firmly in
race, at least in their opinion.
They were especially happy
since 60 Stanford students
went up to Oregon last week
end, canvassed, and contribut
ed substantially to McCarthy's
strong showing.
The students went up Friday
and Saturday by car and bus.
Some of them returned Sunday
if f er only one day of canvassing
after an 8 hour ride just to get
to their precincts. Others stayed
until last night waiting for the
election results.
They worked hard: one group

of canvassers managed to talk
to about a thousand voters in
the course of one day's work.
"Most of the voters were un
committed but responsive,"
said John Kiely, one of seven
Stanford students who canvas
sed a small southern Oregon
lumbering town. He said that
by a small majority the voters
in that town seemed to be lean
ing to McCarthy.
He said that he found some
antipathy towards Sen. Ken
nedy's Oregon campaign effort.
"Some people were put off by the
money they thought Sen. Ken
nedy was spending," Kiely com
mented.
"The canvassing I did was
very encouraging," said Phil Ol
sen who worked in the town of
Roseburg, Oregon. He said that
many of the citizens were quite
receptive, because S~n. McCa thy
had taken a stand favorable to
the town's industries on a lum
bering bill.
He al n o said thit McCarthy
was popular because of the stand
he took on th 1 gun control bill
in the Senate. S n. Kennedy had
taken stands on both issues

which were quite unpopular in
the town, he said.
Olsen also commented on the
fact that he and the other can
vassers had been specifically ad
vised about the stand Sen. Mc-
Carthy had taken on the two
bills, since McCarthy's positions
would be unpopular in that town.
Virginia Sullivan who can
vassed in the town's of Mod
ford and Corvallls found the
local Democrats conservative
but Interested In a candidate
who would be able to beat
Richard Nixon, if he Is the Re
publican nominee for the No
vember election.
Miss Sullivan said that she
and the other canvassers in the
towns showed those voters the
recent California Poll which
said that Sen. McCarthy would
have the best chance of beating
Nixon in November.
The town's people were also
quite receptive to Sen. McCar
thy's unemotional campaign
style and good looks, she said.
Not many of the voters had
hoard of McCarthy, but they
to be interested in find
ing an alternative to Kennedy,
according to Miss Sullivan.
Lucio Ruotozo, a faculty mem
ber of the McCarthy committee
on campus, commented that the
canvassers he had spoken to had
told him that "in their door-to
door visits some people did not
want McCarthy literature, they
wanted McCarthy pins, McCar
thy buttons."
Former Postmaster General
Lawrence F. O'Brien, a Kennedy
campaign strategist, said if
an NBC projection of a McCar
thy victory proves correct, the
York senator will have
suffered a setback but not a
disaster.
He said California's race one
week away still looms as a cru
cial one.

very encouraging," said Phil Ol
sen who worked in the town of
Roseburg, Oregon. He said that
many of the citizens were quite
receptive, because S~n. McCa thy
had taken a stand favorable to
the town's industries on a lum
bering bill.
He al n o said thit McCarthy
was popular because of the stand
he took on th 1 gun control bill
in the Senate. S n. Kennedy had
taken stands on both issues

which were quite unpopular in
the town, he said.
Olsen also commented on the
fact that he and the other can
vassers had been specifically ad
vised about the stand Sen. Mc-
Carthy had taken on the two
bills, since McCarthy's positions
would be unpopular in that town.
Virginia Sullivan who can
vassed in the town's of Mod
ford and Corvallls found the
local Democrats conservative
but Interested In a candidate
who would be able to beat
Richard Nixon, if he Is the Re
publican nominee for the No
vember election.
Miss Sullivan said that she
and the other canvassers in the
towns showed those voters the
recent California Poll which
said that Sen. McCarthy would
have the best chance of beating
Nixon in November.
The town's people were also
quite receptive to Sen. McCar
thy's unemotional campaign
style and good looks, she said.
Not many of the voters had
hoard of McCarthy, but they
to be interested in find
ing an alternative to Kennedy,
according to Miss Sullivan.
Lucio Ruotozo, a faculty mem
ber of the McCarthy committee
on campus, commented that the
canvassers he had spoken to had
told him that "in their door-to
door visits some people did not
want McCarthy literature, they
wanted McCarthy pins, McCar
thy buttons."
Former Postmaster General
Lawrence F. O'Brien, a Kennedy
campaign strategist, said if
an NBC projection of a McCar
thy victory proves correct, the
York senator will have
suffered a setback but not a
disaster.
He said California's race one
week away still looms as a cru
cial one.
Members of the Stanford Com
mittee for McCarthy held a vic
tory celebration last night after
the news of the Minnesota Sen
ator's Oregon primary victory.
Instead of shouting with glee,
they were issued calm instruc
tions about the canvassing sche
dules for the next week and cam
paign rallies.
The spirit at the meeting was
one of happiness: happiness over
the fact that all their efforts
over the past months had not
been wasted and that their can
didate was on~e again firmly in
race, at least in their opinion.
They were especially happy
since 60 Stanford students
went up to Oregon last week
end, canvassed, and contribut
ed substantially to McCarthy's
strong showing.
The students went up Friday
and Saturday by car and bus.
Some of them returned Sunday
if f er only one day of canvassing
after an 8 hour ride just to get
to their precincts. Others stayed
until last night waiting for the
election results.
They worked hard: one group

of canvassers managed to talk
to about a thousand voters in
the course of one day's work.
"Most of the voters were un
committed but responsive,"
said John Kiely, one of seven
Stanford students who canvas
sed a small southern Oregon
lumbering town. He said that
by a small majority the voters
in that town seemed to be lean
ing to McCarthy.
He said that he found some
antipathy towards Sen. Ken
nedy's Oregon campaign effort.
"Some people were put off by the
money they thought Sen. Ken
nedy was spending," Kiely com
mented.
