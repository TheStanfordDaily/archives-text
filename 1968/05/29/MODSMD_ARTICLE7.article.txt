# Students Design Exam For Physiology Course
## 
### 
Stanford's first-year meilcal
students are taking a unique
test this week. The Physiology 1
examination, upon which the
grade for the two-quarter
course depends, was written and
will be graded by the students
themselves.

According to student William
Korns, who is partially responsi
ble for the inception of the ex
periment, the new approach was
prompted by "dissatisfaction
over the lectures. The students
were interested in participating
in the course to get something

more out of it," Korns explained.
"We're hoping it will be a broad
learning experience in many as
pects," he said.
The system works this way:
questions from aH participating
students are submittei to a fac
ulty-student committee which
selects the final questions.
The open-book exam has a one
week time limit and is taken
anonymously.
Upon completion, small groups
of students grade individual
questions. The faculty determ-
ine a pass-fail point, and serve
as references.
The innovation received spe
cial permission from the Dean's
office. "They thought it was an
intriguing idea," Korns related,
"and the faculty was very re
sponsive to the request."
Asked whether the system
would continue next year and
spread to other courses, Korns
replied that the entire curricu
lum and grading practices are
now under consideration. "A
proposal has already been
passed in principle by the fac
ulty to make the entire curricu
lum elective with the exception
of certain minimum courses," he
said.
Korns added that he has had
a lot of feedback from students
about the exam, but that it
seemed to be fairly well accepted
by most of them.
