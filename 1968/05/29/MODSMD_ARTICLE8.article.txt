## Louisville Remains Tense 
### 
LOUISVTLLE, Ky. (AP) —
Sporadic looting and brick-toss
ing broke out Tuesday in the
Negro section of Louisville and
spread to the downtown area for
the second consecutive day.
Louisville's main business ar
tery, Fourth Street, was closed
to vehicle traffic and riot-trained
National Guardsmen were
rushed from the troubled West
End to prevent brazen rock-toss
ing and shoplifting.
Mayor Kenneth Schmied also
ordered another curfew between
11 p.m. and 5 a.m.
Officials were hopeful that the
calm morning would forecast an
end to the violence, but the re
newed missile-tossing and loot
ing raised fears that nightfall
would cause increased turmoil.
Monday's rioting resulted in
some 20 injuries and more than
100 persons arrested. Four per
sons were wounded by gunfire.
The outburst Monday night
followed a rally called by Ne
groes to urge the dismissal of
policemen accused of brutality.
A bottle was tossed into the dis
persing throng and when a po
lice car turned into the intersec
tion a barrage of stones, bottles
and missiles were hurled at the
officers.
• Sit-In Abandoned
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)
Three hundred student demon

strators hastily abandoned a
new sit-in Tuesday at the 17,500-
student San Francisco State Col
lege campus after the new get
tough administration called in
100 police.
"We're fed up," a college
spokesman said.
The demonstrators gave way
not only to threat of arrest but
also to the possibility of imme
diate suspension under a "state
of emergency" proclaimed earli
er in the day.
Yesterday the leaders of the
student dissidents offered to
drop demands for removal of the
ROTC if amnesty was granted
26 students arrested during last
week's sit-in.
The administration rejected
the offer and posted signs pro
claiming "the state of emergen
cy" with its threat of immediate
suspension for those disrupting
college operations.
The dissidents held a rally on
campus. Then, four and five
abreast, they surged into the Ad
ministration Building.
But when police cars rolled
up outside, the sit-in demonstra
tors took a fast vote. It was to
get out of there. They got out.
Earlier Mayor Alioto, whose
mediation has helped solve
newspaper and school teachers
strikes, offered to mediate the
college crisis.
When told that acting presi

dent Donald Garrity and other
administrators had decided on
fast suspensions to curb disor
ders, the mayor said "It's about
time."
• French Resignation
PARIS (AP) —The first open
crack developed in Premier
Georges Pompidou's govern
ment Tuesday over the 12-day
strike wave touched off by stu
dent riots. Education Minister
Alain Peyrefitte, 42, long a tar
get of university students and
teachers, resigned.
Pompidou announced he is
taking over the Education Min
istry and, in maneuvering in
other fields to carry France
through the crisis, will dip into
the nation's $6-billion gold and
foreign currency reserves.
Expenditures from the re
serves will mean a reversal of
President Charles de Gaulle's
policy over the last 10 years of
steadily building up the hoard,
in part with gold from Ft. Knox,
Ky.
The government made public
the text of a law on the reform
of France's educational and eco
nomic institutions for a refer
endum June 16. De Gaulle has
announced he will resign if the
law is rejected.
Left wing opposition parties,
including the Communists, have
already called on the people to

reject the law on the ground
that it amounts to a plebiscite
for De Gaulle.
• End To Bombing?
PARIS (AP) — The United
States is pushing hard in the
Paris peace talks to restore a
nonmilitary buffer zone between
North and South Vietnam.
There was a hint Tuesday that
Hanoi's agreement to this might
lead to an end to all U.S. bomb
ing of the North.
The prospects for North Viet
namese agreement at the mo
ment seem dim, with the prelim
inary talks still in their first
stage of oratorical battle.
Ambassador W. Averell Harri
man has been insistently ham
mering on the theme of the de
militarized zone. H° has repre
sented a re-establishment of the
six-mile-wide arms free buffer
as a prospective "major step
forward" which could produce
significant results.
The Paris talks, bogged down
in a battle of words, recessed
Monday until Friday.
• Rocky Gets VP Feeler
DENVER, Colo. (AP) — Gov.
Nelson A. Rockefeller reported
Tuesday he received a vice
presidential feeler from Richard
Nixon's camp. But Rockefeller
pointed out to reporters that it
would be unconstitutional for
two New York residents to
serve in the nation's two highest
offices.
He told a news conference
that a Nixon representative had
raised the possibility "some
time ago" of Rockefeller be
coming Nixon's running mate.
The New York governor made
the disclosure after addressing
a crowd of 1,000 students on the
University of Denver campus.
• LB J Wants Action
WASHINGTON (AP) — Pres
ident Johnson said yesterday he
has no evidence Hanoi is ready
for "quiet, serious discussions"
in Paris. He called for moving
the Vietnam talks out of the
area of what he termed "fan
tasy and propaganda."
Following lengthy conversa
tions with Cyrus R. Vance,
American negotiator back from
the Paris talks to report, John
son called a sudden news con
fenence to say now is the time
to move the Washington-Hanoi
conversations toward construc
tive discussion of concrete ways
to achieve peace.
The chief executive pledged
that while the United States is
not over pleased with the pro

gress in Paris to date, "We
shall continue patiently to see
if the Paris talks can yield con
structive results."
Johnson made no threat to re
voke his March 31 order that
ruled all save North Vietnam's
southern panhandle should be
beyond the range of American
bombing.
• Saigon Covered
SAIGON (AP) — Seventeen
Viet Cong and North Vietna
mese battalions have a mission
which is tied to the Vietnam
talks in Paris. The mission:
harass Saigon and its suburbs.
This information became
available to The Associated
Press Tuesday from allied intel
ligence reports.
The enemy's order of battl
for Saigon splits the capital mil
itary zone into six districts with
certain battalions assigned to
each of them. The capital zone
extends in a radius of about
eight miles from the center of
Saigon itself. But none of the 17
battalions are actually operat
ing inside the city.
• Sub Still Missing
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Navy said Tuesday an oil slick
was spotted five days ago along
the homeward course of the
missing nuclear submarine Scor
pion.
This would have been two days
after the 252-foot vessel sent a
routine message to its home port
of Norfolk, Va., where it was
headed with its crew of 99.
The significance of the 011
sighting, noted and logged by a
Nacy attack transport returning
from the Mediterranean, was
downgraded, but Capt. John F.
Davis told reporters:
"With the passage of time we
are more apprehensive of what
the possibilities are."
Davis said the Navy is con
centrating its search effort main
ly over the storm-tossed surface
of the Atlantic at this point
since this is the quickest way of
covering broad areas of ocean.

• Sit-In Abandoned
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)
Three hundred student demon

strators hastily abandoned a
new sit-in Tuesday at the 17,500-
student San Francisco State Col
lege campus after the new get
tough administration called in
100 police.
"We're fed up," a college
spokesman said.
The demonstrators gave way
not only to threat of arrest but
also to the possibility of imme
diate suspension under a "state
of emergency" proclaimed earli
er in the day.
Yesterday the leaders of the
student dissidents offered to
drop demands for removal of the
ROTC if amnesty was granted
26 students arrested during last
week's sit-in.
The administration rejected
the offer and posted signs pro
claiming "the state of emergen
cy" with its threat of immediate
suspension for those disrupting
college operations.
The dissidents held a rally on
campus. Then, four and five
abreast, they surged into the Ad
ministration Building.
But when police cars rolled
up outside, the sit-in demonstra
tors took a fast vote. It was to
get out of there. They got out.
Earlier Mayor Alioto, whose
mediation has helped solve
newspaper and school teachers
strikes, offered to mediate the
college crisis.
When told that acting presi

dent Donald Garrity and other
administrators had decided on
fast suspensions to curb disor
ders, the mayor said "It's about
time."
• French Resignation
PARIS (AP) —The first open
crack developed in Premier
Georges Pompidou's govern

Alain Peyrefitte, 42, long a tar
get of university students and

Pompidou announced he is
taking over the Education Min

other fields to carry France
through the crisis, will dip into
the nation's $6-billion gold and
foreign currency reserves.
Expenditures from the re

President Charles de Gaulle's
policy over the last 10 years of
steadily building up the hoard,
in part with gold from Ft. Knox,

The government made public
the text of a law on the reform
of France's educational and eco

announced he will resign if the
law is rejected.
Left wing opposition parties,

• End To Bombing?
PARIS (AP) — The United

North and South Vietnam.
There was a hint Tuesday that
Hanoi's agreement to this might

The prospects for North Viet

Ambassador W. Averell Harri

DENVER, Colo. (AP) — Gov.

• Saigon Covered
SAIGON (AP) — Seventeen
Viet Cong and North Vietna

which is tied to the Vietnam

The enemy's order of battl

WASHINGTON (AP) — The

not only to threat of arrest but
also to the possibility of imme
diate suspension under a "state
of emergency" proclaimed earli
er in the day.
Yesterday the leaders of the
student dissidents offered to
drop demands for removal of the
ROTC if amnesty was granted
26 students arrested during last
week's sit-in.
The administration rejected
the offer and posted signs pro
claiming "the state of emergen
cy" with its threat of immediate
suspension for those disrupting
college operations.
The dissidents held a rally on
campus. Then, four and five
abreast, they surged into the Ad
ministration Building.
But when police cars rolled
up outside, the sit-in demonstra
tors took a fast vote. It was to
get out of there. They got out.
Earlier Mayor Alioto, whose
mediation has helped solve
newspaper and school teachers
strikes, offered to mediate the
college crisis.
When told that acting presi

administrators had decided on
fast suspensions to curb disor
ders, the mayor said "It's about

• French Resignation
PARIS (AP) —The first open
crack developed in Premier
Georges Pompidou's govern
ment Tuesday over the 12-day
strike wave touched off by stu
dent riots. Education Minister
Alain Peyrefitte, 42, long a tar
get of university students and
teachers, resigned.
Pompidou announced he is
taking over the Education Min
istry and, in maneuvering in
other fields to carry France
through the crisis, will dip into
the nation's $6-billion gold and
foreign currency reserves.
Expenditures from the re
serves will mean a reversal of
President Charles de Gaulle's
policy over the last 10 years of
steadily building up the hoard,
in part with gold from Ft. Knox,
Ky.
The government made public
the text of a law on the reform
of France's educational and eco

endum June 16. De Gaulle has
announced he will resign if the
law is rejected.
Left wing opposition parties,
including the Communists, have
already called on the people to

reject the law on the ground
that it amounts to a plebiscite

• End To Bombing?
PARIS (AP) — The United

Paris peace talks to restore a

North and South Vietnam.
There was a hint Tuesday that
Hanoi's agreement to this might
lead to an end to all U.S. bomb

The prospects for North Viet

Ambassador W. Averell Harri

as a prospective "major step

The Paris talks, bogged down

DENVER, Colo. (AP) — Gov.

Tuesday he received a vice

pointed out to reporters that it

two New York residents to

He told a news conference

The New York governor made

WASHINGTON (AP) — Pres

• Saigon Covered
SAIGON (AP) — Seventeen
Viet Cong and North Vietna

which is tied to the Vietnam

harass Saigon and its suburbs.
This information became

The enemy's order of battl

certain battalions assigned to

eight miles from the center of
Saigon itself. But none of the 17

• Sub Still Missing
WASHINGTON (AP) — The

This would have been two days
after the 252-foot vessel sent a
routine message to its home port
of Norfolk, Va., where it was
headed with its crew of 99.
The significance of the 011
sighting, noted and logged by a

"With the passage of time we
are more apprehensive of what

Davis said the Navy is con

LOUISVTLLE, Ky. (AP) —
Sporadic looting and brick-toss

the second consecutive day.
Louisville's main business ar

to vehicle traffic and riot-trained
National Guardsmen were

Mayor Kenneth Schmied also
ordered another curfew between
11 p.m. and 5 a.m.
Officials were hopeful that the

Monday's rioting resulted in
some 20 injuries and more than

The outburst Monday night
followed a rally called by Ne

• French Resignation
PARIS (AP) —The first open
crack developed in Premier
Georges Pompidou's govern
ment Tuesday over the 12-day
strike wave touched off by stu
dent riots. Education Minister
Alain Peyrefitte, 42, long a tar
get of university students and
teachers, resigned.
Pompidou announced he is
taking over the Education Min
istry and, in maneuvering in
other fields to carry France
through the crisis, will dip into
the nation's $6-billion gold and
foreign currency reserves.
Expenditures from the re
serves will mean a reversal of
President Charles de Gaulle's
policy over the last 10 years of
steadily building up the hoard,
in part with gold from Ft. Knox,
Ky.
The government made public
the text of a law on the reform
of France's educational and eco
nomic institutions for a refer
endum June 16. De Gaulle has
announced he will resign if the
law is rejected.
Left wing opposition parties,
including the Communists, have
already called on the people to

reject the law on the ground
that it amounts to a plebiscite
for De Gaulle.
• End To Bombing?
PARIS (AP) — The United
States is pushing hard in the
Paris peace talks to restore a
nonmilitary buffer zone between
North and South Vietnam.
There was a hint Tuesday that
Hanoi's agreement to this might
lead to an end to all U.S. bomb
ing of the North.
The prospects for North Viet
namese agreement at the mo
ment seem dim, with the prelim
inary talks still in their first
stage of oratorical battle.
Ambassador W. Averell Harri
man has been insistently ham
mering on the theme of the de
militarized zone. H° has repre
sented a re-establishment of the
six-mile-wide arms free buffer
as a prospective "major step
forward" which could produce
significant results.
The Paris talks, bogged down
in a battle of words, recessed
Monday until Friday.
• Rocky Gets VP Feeler
DENVER, Colo. (AP) — Gov.
Nelson A. Rockefeller reported
Tuesday he received a vice
presidential feeler from Richard
Nixon's camp. But Rockefeller
pointed out to reporters that it
would be unconstitutional for
two New York residents to
serve in the nation's two highest
offices.
He told a news conference
that a Nixon representative had
raised the possibility "some
time ago" of Rockefeller be
coming Nixon's running mate.
The New York governor made
the disclosure after addressing
a crowd of 1,000 students on the
University of Denver campus.
• LB J Wants Action
WASHINGTON (AP) — Pres
ident Johnson said yesterday he
has no evidence Hanoi is ready
for "quiet, serious discussions"
in Paris. He called for moving
the Vietnam talks out of the
area of what he termed "fan
tasy and propaganda."
Following lengthy conversa
tions with Cyrus R. Vance,
American negotiator back from
the Paris talks to report, John
son called a sudden news con
fenence to say now is the time
to move the Washington-Hanoi
conversations toward construc
tive discussion of concrete ways
to achieve peace.
The chief executive pledged
that while the United States is
not over pleased with the pro

gress in Paris to date, "We
shall continue patiently to see
if the Paris talks can yield con
structive results."
Johnson made no threat to re
voke his March 31 order that
ruled all save North Vietnam's
southern panhandle should be
beyond the range of American
bombing.
• Saigon Covered
SAIGON (AP) — Seventeen
Viet Cong and North Vietna
mese battalions have a mission
which is tied to the Vietnam
talks in Paris. The mission:
harass Saigon and its suburbs.
This information became
available to The Associated
Press Tuesday from allied intel
ligence reports.
The enemy's order of battl
for Saigon splits the capital mil
itary zone into six districts with
certain battalions assigned to
each of them. The capital zone
extends in a radius of about
eight miles from the center of
Saigon itself. But none of the 17
battalions are actually operat
ing inside the city.
• Sub Still Missing
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Navy said Tuesday an oil slick
was spotted five days ago along
the homeward course of the
missing nuclear submarine Scor
pion.
This would have been two days
after the 252-foot vessel sent a
routine message to its home port
of Norfolk, Va., where it was
headed with its crew of 99.
The significance of the 011
sighting, noted and logged by a
Nacy attack transport returning
from the Mediterranean, was
downgraded, but Capt. John F.
Davis told reporters:
"With the passage of time we
are more apprehensive of what
the possibilities are."
Davis said the Navy is con
centrating its search effort main
ly over the storm-tossed surface
of the Atlantic at this point
since this is the quickest way of
covering broad areas of ocean.
LOUISVTLLE, Ky. (AP) —
Sporadic looting and brick-toss
ing broke out Tuesday in the
Negro section of Louisville and
spread to the downtown area for
the second consecutive day.
Louisville's main business ar
tery, Fourth Street, was closed
to vehicle traffic and riot-trained
National Guardsmen were
rushed from the troubled West
End to prevent brazen rock-toss
ing and shoplifting.
Mayor Kenneth Schmied also
ordered another curfew between
11 p.m. and 5 a.m.
Officials were hopeful that the
calm morning would forecast an
end to the violence, but the re
newed missile-tossing and loot
ing raised fears that nightfall
would cause increased turmoil.
Monday's rioting resulted in
some 20 injuries and more than
100 persons arrested. Four per
sons were wounded by gunfire.
The outburst Monday night
followed a rally called by Ne
groes to urge the dismissal of
policemen accused of brutality.
A bottle was tossed into the dis
persing throng and when a po
lice car turned into the intersec
tion a barrage of stones, bottles
and missiles were hurled at the
officers.
• Sit-In Abandoned
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)
Three hundred student demon

strators hastily abandoned a
new sit-in Tuesday at the 17,500-
student San Francisco State Col
lege campus after the new get
tough administration called in
100 police.
"We're fed up," a college
spokesman said.
The demonstrators gave way
not only to threat of arrest but
also to the possibility of imme
diate suspension under a "state
of emergency" proclaimed earli
er in the day.
Yesterday the leaders of the
student dissidents offered to
drop demands for removal of the
ROTC if amnesty was granted
26 students arrested during last
week's sit-in.
The administration rejected
the offer and posted signs pro
claiming "the state of emergen
cy" with its threat of immediate
suspension for those disrupting
college operations.
The dissidents held a rally on
campus. Then, four and five
abreast, they surged into the Ad
ministration Building.
But when police cars rolled
up outside, the sit-in demonstra
tors took a fast vote. It was to
get out of there. They got out.
Earlier Mayor Alioto, whose
mediation has helped solve
newspaper and school teachers
strikes, offered to mediate the
college crisis.

dent Donald Garrity and other
