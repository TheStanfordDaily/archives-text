# Deadline Monday For Housing Draw
## 
### BARBARA RITZ 
The computerized housing
draw this spring has managed
to place all women applicants in
university residences, but some
men will be excluded because of
lack of space.
The Dean of Students' office
says the number of men ex
cluded is not yet known precise
ly-
Yesterday Assistant Dean Sal
ly Mahoney set Monday, June 3
as a deadline for signing resi
dence agreements. She issued
this statement:
"All students who plan to re
side in university residences
next fall and who have been as
signed to a specific house must
sign residence agreements by
June 3.
"Students who received as
signments as the result of the
draw should come to the Old
Union, third floor, to sign these
agreements. Present residents of
university residences who did
not participate in the draw and
who plan to remain in their
present residence should turn
their agreement in to their di
rector or R.A."
Miss Mahoney stated that the
residence agreement commits a
student to live on campus for
three full quarters. Any student
who wishes to withdraw from
a residence between June 1 and
June 30 will be charged a service
fee of $20, she said.
"A student withdrawing from

a residence between July 1 and
the beginning of fall quarter for
feits his $50 room deposit."
Once a student is committed to
a residence, he will remain there
unless he terminates his regi
stration or finds an acceptable re
placement.
Miss Mahoney discussed some
of the problems that the univer
sity must face in housing those
students still unassigned resi
dences.
"Anyone who is at present un
assigned will become part of a
waiting list," she said.
Since there is attrition during
the summer, places will be
found for some of these stu
dents.
Finding housing for students
is not the only issue of the
residence problem, Miss Ma
honey said. "The issue is not
forcing any student to live off
campus if he doesn't want to."
Douglas Walker, director of
freshman admissions, said that
approximately the same num
ber of women and men apply
for admission to Stanford as
freshmen each year.
"This year the highest propor
tion of students applied to Stan
ford, as compared to other
years," he said. "When there is
an increase in tuition there isn't
normally an increase in the ac
ceptances. We've had more stu
dents give us acceptances than
wo expected. In that case you
have to guarantee housing for
them all."

Miss Mahoney discussed some
of the problems that the univer
sity must face in housing those
students still unassigned resi
dences.
"Anyone who is at present un
assigned will become part of a
waiting list," she said.
Since there is attrition during
the summer, places will be
found for some of these stu
dents.
Finding housing for students
is not the only issue of the
residence problem, Miss Ma
honey said. "The issue is not
forcing any student to live off
campus if he doesn't want to."
Douglas Walker, director of
freshman admissions, said that
approximately the same num
ber of women and men apply
for admission to Stanford as
freshmen each year.
"This year the highest propor
tion of students applied to Stan
ford, as compared to other
years," he said. "When there is
an increase in tuition there isn't
normally an increase in the ac
ceptances. We've had more stu
dents give us acceptances than
wo expected. In that case you
have to guarantee housing for
them all."
The computerized housing
draw this spring has managed
to place all women applicants in
university residences, but some
men will be excluded because of
lack of space.
The Dean of Students' office
says the number of men ex
cluded is not yet known precise

Yesterday Assistant Dean Sal
ly Mahoney set Monday, June 3
as a deadline for signing resi
dence agreements. She issued
this statement:
"All students who plan to re
side in university residences
next fall and who have been as
signed to a specific house must
sign residence agreements by
June 3.
"Students who received as
signments as the result of the
draw should come to the Old
Union, third floor, to sign these
agreements. Present residents of
university residences who did
not participate in the draw and
who plan to remain in their
present residence should turn
their agreement in to their di
rector or R.A."
Miss Mahoney stated that the
residence agreement commits a
student to live on campus for
three full quarters. Any student
who wishes to withdraw from
a residence between June 1 and
June 30 will be charged a service
fee of $20, she said.
"A student withdrawing from

a residence between July 1 and
the beginning of fall quarter for
feits his $50 room deposit."
Once a student is committed to
a residence, he will remain there
unless he terminates his regi
stration or finds an acceptable re
placement.
