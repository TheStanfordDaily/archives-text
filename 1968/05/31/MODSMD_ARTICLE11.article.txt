# Frustration

### 
This was the year that Martin King died, the Study of Education
tried, Negroes became Blacks, Johnson lame ducked, McCarthy
threw his hat into the ring, and Kennedy tried to stomp on it.
And this was the year that Cesare, Steve and others set them
selves equal to the gods, and the gods turned out to be frustrated
men who sometimes make hasty decisions.
A few of us like to have our consciousness expanded, our world
view blown to bits and replaced by a burning Citroen. But a few
of us have developed a thick skin to turn toward the news, to
watch the world with.
But it's still frustrating.
It's very frustrating when Provost Richard Lyman flipped into
the Daily office with his aides the first night of the sit-in, seeking
student comment but not interested in the possibility of compro
mise.
And it's very frustrating when ASSU President Cesare Massar
enti and some friends arrived later in the evening to look at the
Daily front page and were equally unready to talk of compromise.
It has been an education for us all—an education about how to
live in the world and how to be affected by crises that matter
and to remain unaffected by crises that don't.
