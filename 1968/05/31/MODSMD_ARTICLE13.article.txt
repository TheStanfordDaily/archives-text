## Mix-Up Creates Cloud Of Inaccuracy 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
As the only T.A. in the entire
Department of English to ap
pear along with the regular
faculty on the recent rating
sheet, I am both honored and
amused, and, if I may be per
mitted a bit of "Personal Voice":
pissed-off.
First, I have never taught
creative writing in my life—an
omission which probably is just
as well, since I am "NOT rec
ommended" to teach such a
course. But then, I am not sure
that Professors Simpson, Moser
or Merritt (sic) have been
teaching creative writing either,
and they are "recommended":
a recognition which may have
given a warm glow to each.
Secondly, English courses
141, 143, 270, 231, 196, 178, 182,
183, 184, and 100, along with a
few others listed under the same
heading, are not and never have
been creative writing courses.
A glance at the university cata

logue and/or time-schedule
might have been useful in com
piling the survey.
In the third place, the intro
ductory explanation of this par
ticular opinion poll cited this
year's Juniors and Seniors as
its source of information. Now,
either some of the former stu
dents in one of my Freshman
English classes have been nurs
ing a very unhealthy grudge for
a period of three or four years—
a condition which is bad for the
digestion and could have been
remedied long ago by blowing
up in my office—, or there were
some very unhappy people, who
also remained silent and to
whom I could have recom
mended the same remedy, in one
of the two seminars I led this
fall quarter as one of the Teach
ing Assistants for English 182.
English 182 is a survey course
in Renaissance literature taught
by Professor J. Martin Evans,
who, it turns out, is recom

mended under the English col
umn, while 182 is not recom
mended under the Creative
Creative Writing column. Thank
God: reading a paper written
after the style of Sir Thomas
Hooker or John Bunyan would
be absurd, and I couldn't agree
more that English 182, 183, and
184 should not be recommended
as creative writing courses.
Everyone is entitled to his
own opinion of particular classes
and teachers—and students—
but these opinions must have a
foundation of fact somewhere
in the background. Whatever
the cause of the present con
fusion, the opinion poll is highly
inaccurate—at least in its de
partmentalization—and should
be corrected before distribution
to in-coming Freshmen, if only
stuck for one whole quarter
to eliminate the fear of getting
with an "Instructor" named
Krebs for "Creative Writing."

Some Review Errors
Deemed Inexcusable
Editor, The Daily:
Most of the Instructors listed
as "Not Recommended under
Creative Writing in the Course
Review have to my knowledge
never (repeat, NEVER) taught
Creative Writing — and one
taught a single course about
eight years ago and none since.
This kind of error is not only
inexcusable, it may be action
able, for professional reputa
tions are under attack.
I thought I had Skip Tam
many's personal assurance on
Tuesday that a letter of apology
was forthcoming from his pen.
Instead in Wednesday's Daily he
writes only a defense of his
work and not a word of apology.
I am not opposed to his enter
prise, but unless it is done re
sponsibly, it had better not be
done at all.

Editor, The DaiJy:
To those who took the course
review seriously: relax A stu
dent review of courses and pro
fessors is a good idea—if only to
increase community communica
tion. But a personality review
based on few responses—as this
one was—is no responsible guide
"to inform students" or "to in
form instructors about them
selves".
The review listed me on its
staff; I was NOT. I only saw
part of the preparation. Most
students failed to return the
questionnaires, many responded
with spite, and the review
lumped disparate information
under the label "comprehen
sive". The cheap criticism of
many professors was merely de
humanizing. There are also the
good jolts, but they come from a
paper that seemed more authen
tic than it was.
And unfortunately omitted as
"ambiguous" was that wonder
ful realm drawing strong posi
tive and negative response. The
review's suggestions for the fu
ture are encouraging, but the
review must be taken with a
grain of salt.

Take Course Review
With A Grain Of Salt
Editor, The DaiJy:
To those who took the course
review seriously: relax A stu
dent review of courses and pro
fessors is a good idea—if only to
increase community communica
tion. But a personality review
based on few responses—as this
one was—is no responsible guide
"to inform students" or "to in
form instructors about them
selves".
The review listed me on its
staff; I was NOT. I only saw
part of the preparation. Most
students failed to return the
questionnaires, many responded
with spite, and the review
lumped disparate information
under the label "comprehen
sive". The cheap criticism of
many professors was merely de
humanizing. There are also the
good jolts, but they come from a
paper that seemed more authen
tic than it was.
And unfortunately omitted as
"ambiguous" was that wonder
ful realm drawing strong posi
tive and negative response. The
review's suggestions for the fu
ture are encouraging, but the
review must be taken with a
grain of salt.

As the only T.A. in the entire
Department of English to ap
pear along with the regular
faculty on the recent rating
sheet, I am both honored and
amused, and, if I may be per
mitted a bit of "Personal Voice":
pissed-off.
First, I have never taught
creative writing in my life—an
omission which probably is just
as well, since I am "NOT rec
ommended" to teach such a
course. But then, I am not sure
that Professors Simpson, Moser
or Merritt (sic) have been
teaching creative writing either,
and they are "recommended":
a recognition which may have
given a warm glow to each.
Secondly, English courses
141, 143, 270, 231, 196, 178, 182,
183, 184, and 100, along with a
few others listed under the same
heading, are not and never have
been creative writing courses.
A glance at the university cata

logue and/or time-schedule
might have been useful in com
piling the survey.
In the third place, the intro
ductory explanation of this par
ticular opinion poll cited this
year's Juniors and Seniors as
its source of information. Now,
either some of the former stu
dents in one of my Freshman
English classes have been nurs
ing a very unhealthy grudge for
a period of three or four years—
a condition which is bad for the
digestion and could have been
remedied long ago by blowing
up in my office—, or there were
some very unhappy people, who
also remained silent and to
whom I could have recom
mended the same remedy, in one
of the two seminars I led this
fall quarter as one of the Teach
ing Assistants for English 182.
English 182 is a survey course
in Renaissance literature taught
by Professor J. Martin Evans,
who, it turns out, is recom

mended under the English col
umn, while 182 is not recom
mended under the Creative
Creative Writing column. Thank
God: reading a paper written
after the style of Sir Thomas
Hooker or John Bunyan would
be absurd, and I couldn't agree
more that English 182, 183, and
184 should not be recommended
as creative writing courses.
Everyone is entitled to his
own opinion of particular classes
and teachers—and students—
but these opinions must have a
foundation of fact somewhere
in the background. Whatever
the cause of the present con
fusion, the opinion poll is highly
inaccurate—at least in its de
partmentalization—and should
be corrected before distribution
to in-coming Freshmen, if only
stuck for one whole quarter
to eliminate the fear of getting
with an "Instructor" named
Krebs for "Creative Writing."

Some Review Errors

This kind of error is not only
inexcusable, it may be action
able, for professional reputa

I thought I had Skip Tam

writes only a defense of his

Some Review Errors
Deemed Inexcusable
Editor, The Daily:
Most of the Instructors listed
as "Not Recommended under
Creative Writing in the Course
Review have to my knowledge
never (repeat, NEVER) taught
Creative Writing — and one
taught a single course about
eight years ago and none since.
This kind of error is not only
inexcusable, it may be action
able, for professional reputa
tions are under attack.
I thought I had Skip Tam
many's personal assurance on
Tuesday that a letter of apology
was forthcoming from his pen.
Instead in Wednesday's Daily he
writes only a defense of his
work and not a word of apology.
I am not opposed to his enter
prise, but unless it is done re
sponsibly, it had better not be
done at all.

The Stanford Course Review
Supplement published in the
Daily contains an error. Under
the courses recommended in the
School of Engineering, CE 10,
CE 115 C and CE 120 should read
ChE 10, ChE 115 C and ChE 120.
These are chemical engineering
courses; courses with correspon
ding numbers do not exist in

To those who took the course
review seriously: relax A stu
dent review of courses and pro
fessors is a good idea—if only to
increase community communica
tion. But a personality review
based on few responses—as this
one was—is no responsible guide
"to inform students" or "to in
form instructors about them
selves".
The review listed me on its
staff; I was NOT. I only saw
part of the preparation. Most
students failed to return the
questionnaires, many responded
with spite, and the review
lumped disparate information
under the label "comprehen
sive". The cheap criticism of
many professors was merely de
humanizing. There are also the
good jolts, but they come from a
paper that seemed more authen
tic than it was.
And unfortunately omitted as
"ambiguous" was that wonder
ful realm drawing strong posi
tive and negative response. The
review's suggestions for the fu
ture are encouraging, but the
review must be taken with a
grain of salt.

As the only T.A. in the entire
Department of English to ap
pear along with the regular
faculty on the recent rating
sheet, I am both honored and
amused, and, if I may be per
mitted a bit of "Personal Voice":
pissed-off.
First, I have never taught
creative writing in my life—an
omission which probably is just
as well, since I am "NOT rec
ommended" to teach such a
course. But then, I am not sure
that Professors Simpson, Moser
or Merritt (sic) have been
teaching creative writing either,
and they are "recommended":
a recognition which may have
given a warm glow to each.
Secondly, English courses
141, 143, 270, 231, 196, 178, 182,
183, 184, and 100, along with a
few others listed under the same
heading, are not and never have
been creative writing courses.
A glance at the university cata

logue and/or time-schedule
might have been useful in com
piling the survey.
In the third place, the intro
ductory explanation of this par
ticular opinion poll cited this
year's Juniors and Seniors as
its source of information. Now,
either some of the former stu
dents in one of my Freshman
English classes have been nurs
ing a very unhealthy grudge for
a period of three or four years—
a condition which is bad for the
digestion and could have been
remedied long ago by blowing
up in my office—, or there were
some very unhappy people, who
also remained silent and to
whom I could have recom
mended the same remedy, in one
of the two seminars I led this
fall quarter as one of the Teach
ing Assistants for English 182.
English 182 is a survey course
in Renaissance literature taught
by Professor J. Martin Evans,
who, it turns out, is recom

mended under the English col
umn, while 182 is not recom
mended under the Creative
Creative Writing column. Thank
God: reading a paper written
after the style of Sir Thomas
Hooker or John Bunyan would
be absurd, and I couldn't agree
more that English 182, 183, and
184 should not be recommended
as creative writing courses.
Everyone is entitled to his
own opinion of particular classes
and teachers—and students—
but these opinions must have a
foundation of fact somewhere
in the background. Whatever
the cause of the present con
fusion, the opinion poll is highly
inaccurate—at least in its de
partmentalization—and should
be corrected before distribution
to in-coming Freshmen, if only
