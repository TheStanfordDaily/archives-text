# The 						Capitol Scenes
## Ronnie Stuns All With Simple Solution 
### Art Buchwald 
Gov. Ronald Reagan, the only
leading noncandidate in the race
for the Republican presidential
nomination, is getting as much
press coverage as Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller and more than for
mer Vice President Richard Nix
on. The reason for this is that
Gov. Reagan is almost as quot
able as Barry Goldwater. Just
the other day he attacked the
Administration for making for
eign affairs too complex. He was
quoted in a speech in Florida as
saying:
"I ran for public office on the
basis that common sense, not
complexity, is needed at the top
of the Administration ... I am
equally unimpressed with all
this talk about our problems be
ing too complex, to intricate to
allow for timely decision and ac
tion." Then, to give an example
of what he meant, he said the
United States should tell the en
emy in North Vietnam to co-op
erate at the peace table or
threaten to "kick the devil out
of him."
I showed this statement to an
Administration official who was
flabbergasted. "My heavens, why
didn't we think of that?"
"Because it takes a simple
man to oome up with a simple
solution," I said.
The official immediately got
on the phone and called the.
State Department.

"Harry, listen. I want to ask
you something on the Vietnam
problem. Has anyone over there
ever thought of telling the North
Vietnamese that if they didn't
co-operate we would kick the
devil out of them? . . . They
haven't? Well, why don't we try
it? ... Of course it's a brilliant
suggestion. I wouldn't have
made it if it hadn't been . . .
What's that? You think I ought
to call the Pentagon and clear
it with them? . . . Right."
My friend called the Pentagon.
"General, the White House here.
Listen, we thought we might at
tack this Vietnam problem from
a much more simple approach.
What would you think if we told
Hanoi that if they didn't
straighten up and fly right, we'd
kick the devil out of them? . . .
You like that, huh? What's that?
There are a few complications?
"What are they, General? . . .
You have to get the Viet Cong
out of Saigon first? . . . Right.

The North Vietnamese have to
stop shelling the cities? ... I
understand. You've got to clear
out the DMZ? . . . Right . . .
And then you have to find the
North Vietnamese to kick the
devil out of them? But you do
like the idea in principle?
"Well, why don't you rework
your strategy? . . . Because first
you have to get the South Viet
namese army in better shape? I
understand . . . You can't do it
unless the Saigon government
makes many needed reforms?
. . . the pacification program has
to be started again? . . . See
here, General, it seems to me
that you're making a complex
problem out of a simple one.
All we want you to do is kick
the devil out of the North Viet
namese. Is that too much to
ask? ... No, I'm not going to
tell you who suggested it. All
I can say is it's someone with
one of the greatest simple minds
in the country."

He hung up. "I guess I'd bet
ter call Harriman," he said.
"Ave, the White House here.
Listen, how are the negotiations
going? . . . Very complicated,
huh? Well, we were thinking of
simplifying them. Why don't you
tell the North Vietnamese if
they don't agree to what we
have in mind, we'll kick the dev
il out of them? What do you
mean that's what THEY told
you this morning? They can't do
that. It was our idea first. Well,
if they threaten to kick the dev

il out of lis and we threaten to
kick the devil out of them, it's
going to really complicate the
negotiations.
"I know, Ave. I realize nego
tiating with the North Vietna
mese is not easy, but it we don't
come up with a simple solution,
we're going to be in trouble in
November. We've got to answer
Reagan's attacks on our foreign
policy . . . What's that? . . .
Why don't we tell Reagan to . . .
now you know, Averell, that's
too simple."

Gov. Ronald Reagan, the only
leading noncandidate in the race
for the Republican presidential
nomination, is getting as much
press coverage as Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller and more than for
mer Vice President Richard Nix
on. The reason for this is that
Gov. Reagan is almost as quot
able as Barry Goldwater. Just
the other day he attacked the
Administration for making for
eign affairs too complex. He was
quoted in a speech in Florida as
saying:
"I ran for public office on the
basis that common sense, not
complexity, is needed at the top
of the Administration ... I am
equally unimpressed with all
this talk about our problems be
ing too complex, to intricate to
allow for timely decision and ac
tion." Then, to give an example
of what he meant, he said the
United States should tell the en
emy in North Vietnam to co-op
erate at the peace table or
threaten to "kick the devil out
of him."
I showed this statement to an
Administration official who was
flabbergasted. "My heavens, why
didn't we think of that?"
"Because it takes a simple
man to oome up with a simple
solution," I said.
The official immediately got
on the phone and called the.
State Department.

"Harry, listen. I want to ask
you something on the Vietnam
problem. Has anyone over there
ever thought of telling the North
Vietnamese that if they didn't
co-operate we would kick the
devil out of them? . . . They
haven't? Well, why don't we try
it? ... Of course it's a brilliant
suggestion. I wouldn't have
made it if it hadn't been . . .
What's that? You think I ought
to call the Pentagon and clear
it with them? . . . Right."
My friend called the Pentagon.
"General, the White House here.
Listen, we thought we might at
tack this Vietnam problem from
a much more simple approach.
What would you think if we told
Hanoi that if they didn't
straighten up and fly right, we'd
kick the devil out of them? . . .
You like that, huh? What's that?
There are a few complications?
"What are they, General? . . .
You have to get the Viet Cong
out of Saigon first? . . . Right.

The North Vietnamese have to
stop shelling the cities? ... I
understand. You've got to clear
out the DMZ? . . . Right . . .
And then you have to find the
North Vietnamese to kick the
devil out of them? But you do
like the idea in principle?
"Well, why don't you rework
your strategy? . . . Because first
you have to get the South Viet
namese army in better shape? I
understand . . . You can't do it
unless the Saigon government
makes many needed reforms?
. . . the pacification program has
to be started again? . . . See
here, General, it seems to me
that you're making a complex
problem out of a simple one.
All we want you to do is kick
the devil out of the North Viet
namese. Is that too much to
ask? ... No, I'm not going to
tell you who suggested it. All
I can say is it's someone with
one of the greatest simple minds
in the country."

He hung up. "I guess I'd bet
ter call Harriman," he said.
"Ave, the White House here.
Listen, how are the negotiations
going? . . . Very complicated,
huh? Well, we were thinking of
simplifying them. Why don't you
tell the North Vietnamese if
they don't agree to what we
have in mind, we'll kick the dev
il out of them? What do you
mean that's what THEY told
you this morning? They can't do
that. It was our idea first. Well,
if they threaten to kick the dev

il out of lis and we threaten to
kick the devil out of them, it's
going to really complicate the
negotiations.

huh? Well, we were thinking of
simplifying them. Why don't you
tell the North Vietnamese if
they don't agree to what we
have in mind, we'll kick the dev
il out of them? What do you
mean that's what THEY told

that. It was our idea first. Well,

kick the devil out of them, it's
going to really complicate the
negotiations.
"I know, Ave. I realize nego
tiating with the North Vietna
mese is not easy, but it we don't
come up with a simple solution,

policy . . . What's that? . . .
Why don't we tell Reagan to . . .
now you know, Averell, that's
too simple."
