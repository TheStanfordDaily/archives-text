## Kennedy Looks To Urgent Problems 
### ANDREW B. WILSON 
A few months ago the saying
went that Eugene McCarthy was
a stalking horse for Robert Ken
nedy. After so many reversals,
then, the election year has
sprung another in the Califor
nia primary which has McCar
thy pitted in the spoiler's role
against Kennedy. Unless Ken
nedy wins big heres Hubert Hum
phrey will be the betting favor
ite at the convention. For those
who want a quick end to the
Vietnam war, the prospect of a
Humphrey-Nixon run-off seems
bleak indeed.
But it was McCarthy, after
all, not Kennedy, who dug the
first knife into the seemingly
impenetrable war policy. Does
n't that entitle him to loyal sup
port, even if he has only a re
mote chance of winning?
A letter-to-the-editor Friday
wrestled briefly with this prob
lem, and closed by asserting, "to
the McCarthy defector, I say,
you have betrayed the politics
of conscience. And conscience
i£ what this campaign is all
about."
But nothing Is simple: not

politics, not conscience, and
certainly not the two together.
The McCarthy-Kennedy dilem
ma, as the non-defector called
It, does not solve itself when
perceived "on a higher plane
than pragmatism or political
expediency," especially if this
higher plane only consists of
a gilt feeling that one candi
date "IN OUR CONSCIENCE
Ls superior."
But virtuous conscience alone
doesn't solve anything. The cru
cial question which faces the
voter is not which candidate is
most deserving, noble or un
blemished, but which, if pres
ident, could lead the strongest,
most effective attack on the
pressing ills that have forced the
incumbent out of the running.
Unfortunately, too much of the
debate over McCarthy and Ken
nedy has made it seem they
were competing for white
knight, not the presidency. This
has been evident in the farcical
battle of the box-scores, thrash
ing out which has supported
more liberal legislation in the
Senate. The two men are differ
ent, beyond the obvious facts

that one was in the race from
the start and the other has a
better shot at winning.
But nothing like the heat of
the box-score battle has been
generated over the issue of
whether new antl ■ poverty
funds should go into a "neg
ative income tax," as McCar
thy proposes, or into making
the government "the employ
er of the last resort," as Ken
nedy proposes. Yet here is a
substantive issue for those
who more than a rhetorical in
terest in liberal policy.
Johnson's non-candidacy and
the resignations of key cabinet
members have signaled the col
lapse of his administration. It
won't remain intact even if Hum
phrey is elected. The road out
of Vietnam still seems long and
hard, but at last policy reflects
a desire to get out, rather than
to force the enemy to its knees.
But if McCarthy pulled the
right string, it remains a ques
tion apart who should be elect
ed to the difficult task of re
building new foreign and do
mestic policies where the old
have failed. Of the five can
didates, only McCarthy and
Kennedy have insisted that the
war must be ended — and
soon.
Only they have recognized and
insisted that the necessary con
cessions and admissions of er
ror must be made to stop the
senseless slaughter. Here I see
no reason to doubt the sincerity
of either man; or to doubt the
readiness of either, if elected, to
translate this sincerity into pol
icy.

But while Vietnam is our most
pressing immediate problem, our
greatest long-range problems,
which are also much more im
mediate than we would like to
admit, are the problems of race
and poverty. We must ask our
selves whether Kennedy or Mc-
Carthy is better equipped to
deal with these problems. And
we wouldn't find an answer by
quibbling over their respective
ADA ratings and the like. We
cannot assume they are both
liberals, and thus much the same.
It is not enough to have a
president who calls for better
programs, and who feel and
think sensitively about the prob
lems. Johnson was this kind of
president in 1964 and early '65.
He succeeded then in passing
one Great Society measure af
ter another.
These successes seem meagre
enough now, but it would be a
mistake to blamr> that all on the
Vietnam war. Even before th' 1
war spending had gutted the
budget, Johnson, for all his lofty
aims, failed to breathe a sense
of compelling national urgency
into his Great Society message.
From the start, the war on
poverty failed to take hold at
the local level. It simply ex
tended government welfare,
with the compliance of the sol
id democratic majority in the
89tli Congress. Whoever be
comes the next president, will
not have a similar Congres
sional majority to command.
McCarthy has been a low-key
speaker; he might also make a
low-key president. The Presidi

dent's Commission on Civil Dis
orders did not exaggerate its
conclusion: "Our nation is mov
ing toward two societies, one
black, one white — separate and
unequal." We need a president
who can bridge the widening
rifts in our nation.
No other political leader can
match Kennedy's appeal to the
Negro; no other member of Con
gress has devoted himself so
persistently to the needs of this
country's depressed minorities.
But still more important, Ken
nedy has a rare gift which this
country needs desperately.
He has what Charles Silber
man ("Crisis in Black and
White") called "the capacity to,
define problems in the stark,
simple, all-or-nothing terms nec
essary to arouse people from
their apathy." He has the ca
pacity to inspire broad masses
of people with a sense of pur
pose which transcends ordinary
antagonisms between class
groupings. He proved this capa
city n Indiana and Nebraska
when he pulled the majority of
both the white blue-collar and
the Negro votes.
Like no other political leader
since Roosevelt, he might con
vince people thai urgent social
problems are indeed urgent —
and that would be half-way to
getting something done about
them before it is too late. Natu
rally this ability to make the
need for drastic change sound
convincing scares and angers
many, but it presents the only
way the genuine national unity
can be achieved.
