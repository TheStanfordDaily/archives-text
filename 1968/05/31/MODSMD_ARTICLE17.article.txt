# My Wits Faint
## Under The Doctor's Hammer 
### Mercutio 
It was my pre-employment
physical. The cost of a summer
job.
The elevator disgorged me at
the fourth floor and I opened the
glass door of Applegarth, Smith
& Wolfe, General Practitioners.
A black-haired nurse with all
the lines of her face set in a
frown appeared. "Yes?"
"My name is Mercutio Mon
tague." Silence. "I'm from Ster
ling Industries," I explained.
"Do you have your papers?"
I gave her the examination
forms. "Wait in that seat
please."
Six minutes passed. An air
conditioner hummed.
"Would you come here please
sir" announced the frowning
nurse. She placed an empty
flask on the counter in front of
me.
"Please take this to the men's
room. It is located outside the
door, past the elevators on the
left."
I stood still, expecting further
instructions. She gave none.
Holding- the flask in my stiffly
up-raised hand, I walked out the
door. In the lobby four women
in flowery hats were waiting for
the elevator. I stumbled past
into "Men."
Forcing nature a bit, I fol
lowed the frowning nurse's un
spoken instructions. Then I car
ried urine back out past the
women, who were still waiting
for the elevator. Four pairs of
eyes glanced quickly at the flask.
Inside Applegarth, Smith &
Wolfe, the frowning nurse ac
cepted my meager offering with
indifferent eyes. "Please follow
me."
We entered a tiny treatment
room.
"Undress to your shorts. The
doctor will administer your ex
amination."
"Thank you," I answered in
awe as she left. I stripped. A
hurried, bespectacled man in a
white coat entered. Shunning
ceremony, he started right in
probing and tapping.
Apparently I began to tense,
so he started a light banter to
relax me. "What work are you
going to do for Sterling Indus
tries?"
"I am going to shuffle papers
for three months," I replied
limply. The doctor said nothing.

As he scrutinized the interior of
my left nostril, I pressed the
point:
"Doctor, I really don't under
stand why I need this pre-em
ployment physical. Aren't I
healthy enough to shuffle papers
for three months?"
He turned his attention to my
right ear. "That's not why you
need a physical. It's so Sterling
Industries will know they're not
hiring some sick person who
will cost 11 them a lot of money
in medical insurance benefits."
He started taping my Jfcnee
With a rubber fpanuner.
"But doctor, Tve only got a
job for the summer with Ster
ling. I'm not eligible for their
medical benefits."
He stopped hammering my
knee and looked up. His passive
demeanour momentarily dark
ened with puzzlement.
"Oh." Then he smiled. "I guess
you got caught up by the bur
eaucracy," he chuckled as he re
sumed hammering my knee.
When the man in the white
coat was finished with me, I
pulled my cloths back on just in
time for the frowning nurse to
march in. "You didn't fill out
page two of the examination
form, Mr. Montague. Please do
so and return it to the reception
ist's desk."
I managed to blurt out "Thank
you" as she vanished. The form
commanded my attention.
"CHECK IN THE SPACE PRO
VIDED IF YOU HAVE SUF
FERED FROM ANY OF THESE
CONDITIONS":
A long list followed: typhoid,
cancer, nervous breakdown, etc.
But I could check none of them.
A fear crept up my spine that
the frowning nurse would reject
my form if I could write noth
ing on it. But the last entry gave
hope:
"Difficulty in seeing or hear
ing."
Sighing with relief, I chock
this ailment and signed the dot
ted line, thereby certifying that
failure to reply candidly to the
above questions was sufficient
cause for dismissal.
The nurse with the perpetual
frown took the proffered form
and examined my confession.
Her frown deepened.
"Mr. Montague, what diflicul-

ties have you had seeing or hear
ing?"
With a bashful grin I told her,
"I was speaking metaphorically.
I meant difficulty in perceiving
reality. You know, 'Eyes have
they, but they see not; They
have ears, but they hear not.' "
She paled. Glancing up at the
lines on the form marked "occu
pation" and "place of residence,"
she grimaced and curtly de
manded, "Is that what they
taught you at Standard Univer
sity?"
Shattered, I started to apolo
gize. She cut me off.
"Go down the hall to the lab
oratory for a blood sample and
toll the technician you're from
Sterling Industries."
"What if I don't tell her I'm
from Sterling?"
"Then she will take twice as
much blood," the frowning nurse
warned with narrowed eyes.
Chilled with fear, I rushed
down the hall.
"Is this the laboratory? I'm
from Sterling In—"
"Yes. Please wait in the room
across the hall."
"Which room?"
"There is only one. Across the
hall."
"But it's occupied."
"No, it's empty."
"But I see a woman in there
dressing."
Furiously the technician
grabbed a syringe and led me by
the sleeve into the room across
the hall past a partly unclad
matron. A needle plunged into
my naked vein. I knew the worst
was coming.
After filling the syringe she
pressed a wad of cotton down
with savage hardness on the
needle, still plunged into my
vein. A spasm of pain froze my
senses. She removed the needle.
"Why did you have to push
the cotton down so hard?" I
gasped.
"To stop the bleeding," she
said, turning to leave.
"Why couldn't you pull out
the needle first?"
She stopped and looked at me
with genuine surprise. Compas
sion softened her porcelain
brows. "That's the way it's al
ways done."
And she walked on down the
hall.
It was my pre-employment
physical. The cost of a summer
job.
The elevator disgorged me at
the fourth floor and I opened the
glass door of Applegarth, Smith

the needle first?"
She stopped and looked at me
with genuine surprise. Compas
sion softened her porcelain
brows. "That's the way it's al
ways done."
And she walked on down the
hall.
It was my pre-employment
physical. The cost of a summer
job.
The elevator disgorged me at
the fourth floor and I opened the
glass door of Applegarth, Smith
& Wolfe, General Practitioners.
A black-haired nurse with all
the lines of her face set in a
frown appeared. "Yes?"
"My name is Mercutio Mon
tague." Silence. "I'm from Ster
ling Industries," I explained.
"Do you have your papers?"
I gave her the examination
forms. "Wait in that seat
please."
Six minutes passed. An air
conditioner hummed.
"Would you come here please
sir" announced the frowning
nurse. She placed an empty
flask on the counter in front of
me.
"Please take this to the men's
room. It is located outside the
door, past the elevators on the
left."
I stood still, expecting further
instructions. She gave none.
Holding- the flask in my stiffly
up-raised hand, I walked out the
door. In the lobby four women
in flowery hats were waiting for
the elevator. I stumbled past
into "Men."
Forcing nature a bit, I fol
lowed the frowning nurse's un
spoken instructions. Then I car
ried urine back out past the
women, who were still waiting
for the elevator. Four pairs of
eyes glanced quickly at the flask.
Inside Applegarth, Smith &
Wolfe, the frowning nurse ac
cepted my meager offering with
indifferent eyes. "Please follow
me."
We entered a tiny treatment
room.
"Undress to your shorts. The
doctor will administer your ex
amination."
"Thank you," I answered in
awe as she left. I stripped. A
hurried, bespectacled man in a
white coat entered. Shunning
ceremony, he started right in
probing and tapping.
Apparently I began to tense,
so he started a light banter to
relax me. "What work are you
going to do for Sterling Indus
tries?"
"I am going to shuffle papers
for three months," I replied
limply. The doctor said nothing.

As he scrutinized the interior of
my left nostril, I pressed the
point:
"Doctor, I really don't under
stand why I need this pre-em
ployment physical. Aren't I
healthy enough to shuffle papers
for three months?"
He turned his attention to my
right ear. "That's not why you
need a physical. It's so Sterling
Industries will know they're not
hiring some sick person who
will cost 11 them a lot of money
in medical insurance benefits."
He started taping my Jfcnee
With a rubber fpanuner.
"But doctor, Tve only got a
job for the summer with Ster
ling. I'm not eligible for their
medical benefits."
He stopped hammering my
knee and looked up. His passive
demeanour momentarily dark
ened with puzzlement.
"Oh." Then he smiled. "I guess
you got caught up by the bur
eaucracy," he chuckled as he re
sumed hammering my knee.
When the man in the white
coat was finished with me, I
pulled my cloths back on just in
time for the frowning nurse to
march in. "You didn't fill out
page two of the examination
form, Mr. Montague. Please do
so and return it to the reception
ist's desk."
I managed to blurt out "Thank
you" as she vanished. The form
commanded my attention.
"CHECK IN THE SPACE PRO
VIDED IF YOU HAVE SUF
FERED FROM ANY OF THESE
CONDITIONS":
A long list followed: typhoid,
cancer, nervous breakdown, etc.
But I could check none of them.
A fear crept up my spine that
the frowning nurse would reject
my form if I could write noth
ing on it. But the last entry gave
hope:
"Difficulty in seeing or hear
ing."
Sighing with relief, I chock
this ailment and signed the dot
ted line, thereby certifying that
failure to reply candidly to the
above questions was sufficient
cause for dismissal.
The nurse with the perpetual
frown took the proffered form
and examined my confession.
Her frown deepened.
"Mr. Montague, what diflicul-

ties have you had seeing or hear
ing?"
With a bashful grin I told her,
"I was speaking metaphorically.
I meant difficulty in perceiving
reality. You know, 'Eyes have
they, but they see not; They
have ears, but they hear not.' "
She paled. Glancing up at the
lines on the form marked "occu
pation" and "place of residence,"
she grimaced and curtly de
manded, "Is that what they
taught you at Standard Univer
sity?"
Shattered, I started to apolo
gize. She cut me off.
"Go down the hall to the lab
oratory for a blood sample and
toll the technician you're from
Sterling Industries."
"What if I don't tell her I'm
from Sterling?"
"Then she will take twice as
much blood," the frowning nurse
warned with narrowed eyes.
Chilled with fear, I rushed
down the hall.
"Is this the laboratory? I'm
from Sterling In—"
"Yes. Please wait in the room
across the hall."
"Which room?"
"There is only one. Across the
hall."
"But it's occupied."
"No, it's empty."
"But I see a woman in there
dressing."
Furiously the technician
grabbed a syringe and led me by
the sleeve into the room across
the hall past a partly unclad
matron. A needle plunged into
my naked vein. I knew the worst
was coming.
After filling the syringe she
pressed a wad of cotton down
with savage hardness on the
needle, still plunged into my
vein. A spasm of pain froze my
senses. She removed the needle.
"Why did you have to push
the cotton down so hard?" I
gasped.
"To stop the bleeding," she
said, turning to leave.
"Why couldn't you pull out
the needle first?"
She stopped and looked at me
with genuine surprise. Compas
sion softened her porcelain
brows. "That's the way it's al
ways done."
And she walked on down the
hall.

"Why did you have to push
the cotton down so hard?" I
gasped.
"To stop the bleeding," she
said, turning to leave.
"Why couldn't you pull out
the needle first?"
She stopped and looked at me
with genuine surprise. Compas
sion softened her porcelain
brows. "That's the way it's al
ways done."
And she walked on down the
hall.
It was my pre-employment
physical. The cost of a summer
job.
The elevator disgorged me at
the fourth floor and I opened the
glass door of Applegarth, Smith
& Wolfe, General Practitioners.
A black-haired nurse with all
the lines of her face set in a
frown appeared. "Yes?"
"My name is Mercutio Mon
tague." Silence. "I'm from Ster
ling Industries," I explained.
"Do you have your papers?"
I gave her the examination
forms. "Wait in that seat
please."
Six minutes passed. An air
conditioner hummed.
"Would you come here please
sir" announced the frowning
nurse. She placed an empty
flask on the counter in front of
me.
"Please take this to the men's
room. It is located outside the
door, past the elevators on the
left."
I stood still, expecting further
instructions. She gave none.
Holding- the flask in my stiffly
up-raised hand, I walked out the
door. In the lobby four women
in flowery hats were waiting for
the elevator. I stumbled past
into "Men."
Forcing nature a bit, I fol
lowed the frowning nurse's un
spoken instructions. Then I car
ried urine back out past the
women, who were still waiting
for the elevator. Four pairs of
eyes glanced quickly at the flask.
Inside Applegarth, Smith &
Wolfe, the frowning nurse ac
cepted my meager offering with
indifferent eyes. "Please follow
me."
We entered a tiny treatment
room.
"Undress to your shorts. The
doctor will administer your ex
amination."
"Thank you," I answered in
awe as she left. I stripped. A
hurried, bespectacled man in a
white coat entered. Shunning
ceremony, he started right in
probing and tapping.
Apparently I began to tense,
so he started a light banter to
relax me. "What work are you
going to do for Sterling Indus
tries?"
"I am going to shuffle papers
for three months," I replied
limply. The doctor said nothing.

As he scrutinized the interior of
my left nostril, I pressed the
point:
"Doctor, I really don't under
stand why I need this pre-em
ployment physical. Aren't I
healthy enough to shuffle papers
for three months?"
He turned his attention to my
right ear. "That's not why you
need a physical. It's so Sterling
Industries will know they're not
hiring some sick person who
will cost 11 them a lot of money
in medical insurance benefits."
He started taping my Jfcnee
With a rubber fpanuner.
"But doctor, Tve only got a
job for the summer with Ster
ling. I'm not eligible for their
medical benefits."
He stopped hammering my
knee and looked up. His passive
demeanour momentarily dark
ened with puzzlement.
"Oh." Then he smiled. "I guess
you got caught up by the bur
eaucracy," he chuckled as he re
sumed hammering my knee.
When the man in the white
coat was finished with me, I
pulled my cloths back on just in
time for the frowning nurse to
march in. "You didn't fill out
page two of the examination
form, Mr. Montague. Please do
so and return it to the reception
ist's desk."
I managed to blurt out "Thank
you" as she vanished. The form
commanded my attention.
"CHECK IN THE SPACE PRO
VIDED IF YOU HAVE SUF
FERED FROM ANY OF THESE
CONDITIONS":
A long list followed: typhoid,
cancer, nervous breakdown, etc.
But I could check none of them.
A fear crept up my spine that
the frowning nurse would reject
my form if I could write noth
ing on it. But the last entry gave
hope:
"Difficulty in seeing or hear
ing."
Sighing with relief, I chock
this ailment and signed the dot
ted line, thereby certifying that
failure to reply candidly to the
above questions was sufficient
cause for dismissal.
The nurse with the perpetual
frown took the proffered form
and examined my confession.
Her frown deepened.
"Mr. Montague, what diflicul-

ties have you had seeing or hear
ing?"
With a bashful grin I told her,
"I was speaking metaphorically.
I meant difficulty in perceiving
reality. You know, 'Eyes have
they, but they see not; They
have ears, but they hear not.' "
She paled. Glancing up at the
lines on the form marked "occu
pation" and "place of residence,"
she grimaced and curtly de
manded, "Is that what they
taught you at Standard Univer
sity?"
Shattered, I started to apolo
gize. She cut me off.
"Go down the hall to the lab
oratory for a blood sample and
toll the technician you're from
Sterling Industries."
"What if I don't tell her I'm
from Sterling?"
"Then she will take twice as
much blood," the frowning nurse
warned with narrowed eyes.
Chilled with fear, I rushed
down the hall.
"Is this the laboratory? I'm
from Sterling In—"
"Yes. Please wait in the room
across the hall."
"Which room?"
"There is only one. Across the
hall."
"But it's occupied."
"No, it's empty."
"But I see a woman in there
dressing."
Furiously the technician
grabbed a syringe and led me by
the sleeve into the room across
the hall past a partly unclad
matron. A needle plunged into
my naked vein. I knew the worst
was coming.
After filling the syringe she
pressed a wad of cotton down
with savage hardness on the
needle, still plunged into my
vein. A spasm of pain froze my
senses. She removed the needle.
"Why did you have to push
the cotton down so hard?" I
gasped.
