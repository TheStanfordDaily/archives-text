# Death For The French Republic?
##

Wednesday, May 29
PARIS (AP)—A foreigner in
Paris gets the feeling he is
watching the Fifth Republic die.
If it is dying, it is doing so in
an outlandish way, but almost
everything in France these days
seems a bit outlandish, includ
ing the way this disaster began
from the angry protests of a
handful of students in a Paris
suburb.
The odds seem to be increas
ing against the political survival
of 77-year-old President Charles
de Gaulle, who ruled in lofty
majesty for the 10 years of the
Fifth Republic.
If he does not survive this cri
sis, it could remain to the Com
munist party to pick up the
pieces, though it is considered
highly unlikely that the Commu
nists can achieve full power in
France. Ironically, if De Gaulle

does survive, it could be because
of the help of the Communist
party.
With its command of the most
powerful labor organization, the
General Confederation of Labor
—CGT—the party had been in
the position in the past of being
able to seriously cripple this
country by calling out the key
unions.
Now, if any group can unpara
lyze the country, it may be the
Communist party, if it has the
will—and still has the authority
—to order those same key un
ions back to work. There are
1.25 million CGT members, and
about 8 million to 10 million per
sons are on strike, but the im
portant unions could get the
country moving again.
France seems close to coming
to a complete halt, now that gas
oline supplies are running low.
In the midst of all the turmoil
in Paris, the Americans and

North Vietnamese carry on
what are loosely called peace
talks, operating in their own
vacuum sealed off from the
French storm.
Oddly there is a link between
France's troubles — which may
yet become a contagion in Eu
rope—and the Americans' trou
bles with the war in Vietnam.
It was a rally against the
Vietnam war last March in Par
is which provided a spark—on a
long fuse — that helped bring
about the explosion.
The demonstration brought
some arrests of students, a pro
test rally at the Nanterre
branch of Paris University, oc
cupation of the dean's office, re
volt among the students, chain
reaction among Paris students
and finally rebellion by a large
number of them.
The fover of revolt spread to
the workers, who watched with
interest the student use of vio
lence to bring government min-

isters to heel. The infection
spread with astonishing rapidi
ty. Workers began occupying
premises. In many eases, the
workers seemed beyond the con
trol of their union leaders.
While the CGT and its Com
munist leaders moved swiftly to
regain control, they did so at
the cost of making even wider
the gap between the orthodox
party and the evolutionary stu
dents who now were challenging
them for the allegiance of work
ers. Young workers in many in- j
stances were far ahead of the
CGT and the Communist party
in their demands for reforms.
The rebellious element among
the students and young workers
now seems to regard the Com
munist party, the Roman Catho
lic Church, the Gaullists and
probably most of the older gen
eration as political enemies all
manning the bastions of middle
class conservatism.
Whatever happens now, the

Fifth Republic has been shaken
to its core. Angry young revolu
tionists caused many of their
fellow Frenchmen to think
thoughts which had been un
thinkable.
Like the people in the nursery
tale of the emperor's clothing,
the youthful upheaval exposed
the nakedness of the country's
leadership, from the Gaullists all
across the political spectrum to
the Communists.
