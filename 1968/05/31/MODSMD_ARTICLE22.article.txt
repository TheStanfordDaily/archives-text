# AAUP Plans Study Of Stanford Government
## 
### 
A faculty association has
formed a 15-member Committee
on Governing the University to
deliver a report in autumn on
Stanford's organizational struc
ture.
Prof. William A. Clcbsch,
president of the Stanford chap
ter of the American Association
of University Professors (AA
UP), appointed Religion Prof.
Edwin M. Good as acting chair
man of the new committee.
Clebsch says"the committee's
task ... is to apply highest
standards of academic freedom,
students' rights and university
government to the concrete sit
uation at Stanford. It will study

pertinent statements by the na
tional AAUP, especially the
1966 Statement on Government
of Colleges and Universities."
Clehsch and chapter presi
dent-elect Sanford M. Dorn
busch also named members to
the "Ombudsman Board" an
nounced last week to hear stu
dent and faculty complaints
al>out academic freedom and
student rights.
The university government
committee was formed at a
chapter meeting May 20 and a
chapter executive committee
meeting May 24. "The executive
committee . . . noted that the
recent sit-in at Stanford indi

cated the need for improved
channels of communication be
tween students, faculty admin
istrators and trustees," Clebsch
said. The sit-in and other dis
ruptions at universities will be
discussed at the AAUP chapter's
meeting Monday. Both commit
tees will discuss their plans
with chapter members.
In announcing the Ombuds
man Board's formation last Fri
day, Clebsch said, "VVe are con
cerned that recent events seem
to indicate that systematic and
reasonable means of registering
disagreement at Stanford are
not adequate."
Members of the AAUP do not
regard the Board as a pressure

group, but rather as an attempt
to deal with "a flaw in the
total life of higher education at
Stanford," Clebsch added.
The executive committer
statement calls on t.hÂ«* newly
formed Board to "employ the
good offices and moral force
of the AAUP to tho settle
ment" of grievances accord
ing to AAUP or other higher
standards.
Two recent statements by the
national organization, one on
"Government of Colleges and
Universities" and the other on
"Rights and Freedoms of Stu
dents," which was drafted in

conjunction with the National
Students Association and eight
other national education orga
nizations, provide most of AAUP
position in regards to academic
freedom and University govern
ment.
For students and faculty mem
bers who feel there is no exist
ing university body who will
hear their suggestions, the om
budsman board will also serve
as a "hearing body and advo
cate," Clcbsch said.

government committee are: J.
Merrill Carlsmith (Psychology),
Elizabeth G. Cohen (Education),
Gordon A. Craig (History),
Thomas Ehrlich (Law), Henry
