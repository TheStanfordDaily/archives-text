# 'No Time For Youth'
## Book Blasts College 
### 
Stanford's foremost experts on student psy
chology deliver a sweeping indictment of higher
education in a new book, No Time For Youth
(463 pp., Jossey-Bass, $10), now available at the
Stanford bookstore.
Joseph Katz and Harold A. Kom of the Insti
tute for the Study of Human Problems point out
that college students, even as they approach
graduation, are usually uncertain about their
identity, their career plans, marriage, and"the
world and their place in it."
Many students "haven't learned to use reason
well enough in facing their own decisions and
often make major life decisions, including choice
of careers and marriage partners, by default,"
Katz and Korn comment.
"Most college students work hard to meet their
academic demands. But they often do not know
why they are doing wiat is asked of them in the
classroom, so they become frustrated. Even stu
dents who seem quite compliant, continuing in
school year after year, show underneath the sur
face a good deal of p»<nt-up bewilderment about
what exactly is expected of them. The root of the
dissatisfaction is a basic shortcoming of the col
lege itself: the demands that institutions make
of their students are not sufficiently adapted to
the great diversity of the students and the differ
ences in their prospective life and career plans.
"Tensions between students and colleges, we
found, are in part due to the fact that many
young people come to the campus with high ex
pectations for expansion of their personalities.
They seek better knowledge of themselves and
other people, greater emotional self-sufficiency,
and enhanced intellectual and esthetic powers.
But they are given an academic curriculum that
barely begins to develop these capacities.
Psych Out Profs
"It is generally recognized that independence
is desirable, but there is often little scope for the
students to exert such independence. Textbooks,
assignments, and lectures structure the material
so it can be echoed back on examination ques
tions. We found that students, therefore, soon
develop the art of 'psyching out' the professor,
learning what kinds of responses are going to be
rewarded by a high grade.
"On the other hand, we also found that in situ
ations where the student is in charge, as in a
project where he tutors children, or works on
committees for educational reform, he is often
highly inventive. His concepts in these cases are
relevant and sophisticated instead of merely
memorized. There is a sense of personal achieve
ment because inner incentive and work are in
harmony. By contrast, when the work is imposed
from the outside, even a high grade provides
only temporary comfort.
"College may not be the optimal educational

institution for many young people between the
ages of 17 and 22. Are we, perhaps, forcing many
of them into a mold applicable only to those with
a strong intellectual or academic orientation of
the sort for which colleges were originally de
signed generations ago?
"College curriculums have not changed corres
pondingly with the change in college population.
So it may be that attention now should be turned
to alternatives, such as Peace Corps-type pro
grams or continued education while on a job In
industry, business, or government.
Cut and Dried
"Late adolescence with its promise and radi
ance is a time for the dramatic surfacing of po
tentialities, alternatives, and conflicts. By con
centrating on classroom performance in such a
relatively cut-and-dried fashion, we have deprived
ourselves not only of the opportunity to further
the growth of students in nonacademic areas, but
paradoxically we have also deprived ourselves of
establishing some of the conditions necessary for
their intellectual development.
"What we are proposing is a shift of emphasis
from teaching courses to teaching students—
from memorizing facts to learning the skills and
competencies that will foster the student's capac
ity for continuous self-learning.
"We recommend that an intellectual profile be
drawn up for each entering student as a means
of charting his areas of weakness and strength.
The profile should go considerably beyond sim
ply listing courses, so that it can become the
foundation of a comprehensive plan for his col
lege years. This plan, in turn, ought to be exam
ined periodically to make sure that the student is
achieving mastery in the areas designated, is tak
ing studies that connect with his motivations and
aptitudes, and is selecting the best avenues for
reaching his goals.
"Part of such a plan would be to look for the
specific teachers, as well as the courses, that
promote the student's development. Another part
would be to determine the kinds of exposure—
field work, independent research, service projects,
teaching under professional supervision — that
would be most helpful to the individual student
as he develops educationally. There should be
provision for flexibility in the time required to
reach objectives, including, where advisable, time
for dropping out. The traditional four-year plan
might be replaced by something like a three- or
five-year plan depending on the individual stu
dent.
"A particularly important aspect of the pro
posed profile is that it would encourage the stu
dent to grow in an area in which he is weak. This
is a challenge that the present system, in part
because of grade anxiety, often encourages the
student to avoid."
