## 'Window' Stimulating 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ BARBARA RITZ 
"The Sign in Sidney Brustein's
Window," Stanford Repertory
Theater's last production of the
season, opened Wednesday night
in the Little Theater in Memor
ial Auditorium for four perfor
mances, concluding conight and
tomorrow evening.
Lorraine play, set
in a Greenwich Village apart
ment, Is a sensitive portrayal of
people trying to face reality, and
each in turn failing, retui'ning to
hiS or her own distorted and
protective view of the world.
Stephen Jay Book's presenta
tion is, on the whole, stimulating
and excellent, but it has some
faults. The first act was marred
by some overacting, overreacting
by the cast, and the fault must
be laid with Book.
This excess resulted in the cre
ation of stereotypes at points
in the first act, although the
characters do not give this im
pression later in the play.
Admirable Success
But despite these flaws, the
production admira y carries
through the aims of the author,
and the show 5s one well worth
seeing.
Gerald Hiken turns in a tour
de force as Sidney Brustein,
handling both the comic and
tragic moments with equal ease
and finesse.
His portrayal of a 37-year
old liberal Jewish Village in
tellectual (of which there are
a surprising number around)
is accurate (except where It is
somewhat overdone, as men
tioned before), animated, and
keeps things moving.
Reba Waoers, as Brustein's 29-
year-old O^eek-Gaelic-American

Indian-Hillbilly wife, was too
tight and too stereotyped at the
beginning, but loosened up and
expanded to a good, solid perfor
mance at the end, added to by
her own liveliness and zest.
Ruth Hunt's portrayal of a
frustrated middle-aged house
wife becomes so real that she
convincingly changes from a
comic figure to essentially a very
tragic character in the play.
Richard Rekow almost seems
to have been typecast as the
young alienated, misunderstood
black in the play. His acting abi
lity far surpasses the restrain
ing aspects of the role.
Stephen D. Newman was

given very little to work with as
Wally O'Hara, the reform can
didate turned party machine
member, but could have turned
in a less shallow performance
than he did.
Douglas Johnson as the homo
sexual, and Nancy Black as the
socialite prostitute, gave com
plementary performances as so
cial outcasts. Some of the pathos
of these characters was substi
tuted for humor, thus toning
down what might have been an
extremely dramatic death scene.
The ending of the play be
comes essentially a dramatic dia
logue between Hiken and Reba
Waters.
