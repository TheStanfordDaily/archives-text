# Chaparral's 'Time' Parody Features Vicki Drake Story
## 
### BARBARA RITZ 
The Spring Quarter issue on
sale Tuesday of the Chaparral
promises to be the most unusual
of the year.
On the cover is a picture of
Vicky Drake, illustrated in a
parody format on Time, and fol
lowed inside by an interview
with Miss Drake. The interview
does not seek any profound com
ments on student body govern
ment, elections at Stanford, the
hypocrisy of The System. Nor
does it get any. Vicky's com
ments, however, are very inter
esting and provoke several
thoughtful questions about at
titudes at Stanford.
The best parts of the issue
are devoted to poetry and fiction,
with accompanying photographs.
The poem, "16th and Clay,"
by Tony Sanchez, Is a sensitive
dramatization of the Oakland
riots, of the absurdity of clutch
ed billy clubs, of arm bands for
peace, and the massacre that fol
lows. More important, the poem
merely asks "why."
Dick Warwick's poem, "Gen
esis," portrays images of the
creation of man as well as man's
ever-present emotions. The is
sue is worth reading for the
poetry alone.
Included as well in the issue
are several non-fiction articles.
"WESPAC" by Linda Moulton,
describes the poster-selling busi
ness in San Francisco.
The second is an interview
about earthquakes with Dr. Rob
ert Kovach of the geophysics

department at Stanford. The in
terview, although well-written,
is out of place in the issue. For
those with less than a rudi
mentary interest in geology, the
lengthy interview becomes bor
ing.
The Spring Quarter Chaparrel
is very much like an issue of
Time. It tells, describes, photo
graphs, interviews, everything
that is current in our society.
But in all the pictures and words
in the Chappie are questions
about men's actions in the world.
The word "why" reoccurs often
in the issue. The issue, as a
parody on Time and ourselves
succeeds.
