working full time seven years
ago, yet it is not sufficient to
handle all the needs of the com
munity.
According to Miss Suzanne
Gordon, the Psychiatric services
secretary, there are an average
of 26 appointments made for
each day. This includes return
ing patients and new ones. The
amount of time necessary to get
an appointment varies from a
few days to two weeks.
The Service handles problems
which are more serious than
those dealt with by the Coun
seling center. Both centers will
make referrals to each other.
Aooordlng to Paulson the
Cowell Center cannot meet all
the demands required of it.
There Is a great deal of de
pendence upon the Med
School's Adult Psychiatric
Clinic especially for long-term
treatment. Long-term treat
ment usualls extends through
more than one quarter.
Emergency cases when they
can not be handled at the Health
Center are referred to the Med
ical school. Paulson also stated
that the Health Center must
refer out one third to one fourth
of the students who come in.
In such cases patients can be
sent to the Med School facility,
private hospitals, or private psy
chiatrists.
The Health Center maintains
18 different programs. The doc
* tors participate in seminars and
senior colloquia. The Center runs
' six psychotherapy groups as
part of the service.
The Adult Psychiatric Clinic
r at the Med School acts as a
• back-up to the Health Clinic.
" They maintain a twenty-four
. hour emergency service. The
Clinic has three full-time psy
chiatrists and twelve residents
in training who are under close
I supervision.
As in the other services, the

Clinic offers group therapy and
utilizes psychodramas.
According to Donald Staight,
a clinical social worker at the
Med Center, "In general the
students use the services welL
They have a great potential
for rapid growth. Students on
the whole come looking for
a change."
The psychiatric services at
this University are presently un
der study by the Committee on
University Health. The Commit
tee, set up two years ago by
President J. E. Wallace Sterling,
is studying the mental health of
the school on a broad scale and
the demands made on each of
the services.
Dr. Herant Katchadourian, as
istant professor of psychiatry,
a member of the committee stat
ed "Student health services tend
to act as clearing houses. To pro
vide full service to a commu
nity this size would require an
enormous amount of psychia
trists."
He went on to say that he did
not feel that there is a major
gap between service and de
mand. The University has the
facilities and so a reshuffling of
services may prove effective.
Counseling of a less psychia
tric nature goes on in the of
fices of the Chapel. Napier, Dean
of Chapel, sees about 25 stu
dents a week while his assistant
and others see about ten.
The counseling is not always
of a religious nature, Tim Bux
ton, assistant to the dean of
Chapel, stated that students
come to talk with Napier not be
cause he is a Christian but be
cause he is a warm human be
ing.
The problems brought to the
chapel are moral problems.
Students are concerned with
the implications of what they
have done or plan to do. The
question of draft resistance is
a good example.

The chapel is also in contact
with the other services on cam
pus and when a situation arises
that needs professional psycho
logical attention, the student is
referred.
People come because they have
something on their minds and
know that they are welcome to

talk. Buxton strives for close
ness: "I make it a point to use
the person's first name."
As Dr. Paulson stated, "This
is the year of the group." There
is a continued need for such ed
ucation on this campus.
People do have problems and
there is a large demand for

service despite the SES Report's
statement that "The fact that a
relatively small proportion of
Stanford students use the coun
seling services in these two in
stitutions (Cowell and Counsel
ing and Testing) may be an
