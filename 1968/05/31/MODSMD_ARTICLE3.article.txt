# Present Counseling Facilities Fail To Meet Student Needs
## 
### MIKE ZADIG 
The Study of Education ad
vising committee has said in its
recent report that a relatively
small proportion of students
make use of the counseling ser
vices. In spite of this fact, The
Daily has found that in some
areas of the counseling system
there are too few counselors,
to meet student needs.
Stanford has three centers
from which psychological coun
seling can be obtained. Services
are offered at the Counseling and
Testing Center in the Old Union,
at Cowell Health Center, and the
Medical School's Adult Psychia
tric Clinic. Students also can seek
religious counseling at the chap
el or the Clubhouse.
Couseling and Testing is one
center which nearly every stu
dent makes use of. Nearly all
students utilize the testing ser
vice at some time and approxi
mately a half take advantage
of the other services provided.
The Center offers individual
counseling or group counseling
if the situation calls for it. The
student coming in for the first
time is given a preliminary ap
pointment which gives him a
chance to determine what kind
of services he needs.
According to Guy Browning,
assistant director, "The first in
terview is an interview for es
tablishing what kind of service
can be provided. Sometimes all
that is needed is simple instruc
tion in study skills."
The counseling is designed
to help the student work
through any problems he
might have. Many students, es
pecially at this time of the
year, seek advice concerning
their choice of a major. Voca
tional counseling is done as
well as counseling of person
al problems.
The Counseling Center is in
a state of flux and seems ready
to make use of anything bene
ficial to the student. The stated
goal of the service is "hopeful
ly, to improve the whole cli
mate of living and learning at
Stanford," according to a pam
phlet prepared by Counseling
and Testing. In so doing the Cen
ter has been instrumental in
setting up encounter or ther
apy groups within the commu
nity.
Therapy groups were origi
nally reserved for the upset stu
dent. It was found however that
everyone can benefit from this
form of group experience, so
Project Encounter was set up.
Project Encounter began last

Autumn with one section in
Roble and Madera, freshman res
idences. The groups included 8-10
students and an adviser.
According to Browning the
groups were free to do as they
pleased. Second quarter the pro
gram was opened to more fresh
men and non-freshmen.
The Center does have a com
mitment to the School of Ed
ucation and the phased-out
Clinical Psychology program
to train graduates. Trainees
learn techniques in the coun

seling or reading and study
skills. Oidy doctoral candidates
do student counseling on refer
ral and under close supervi
sion.
Cowell Student Health Center
offers psychiatric service. There
are three psychiatrists, Dr.
James Paulsen, Dr. John Maur
er, and Dr. Francis Mozenbeck
er as well as two clinical psychol
ogists and a psychiatric social
worker. This is an improvement
upon the single psychiatrist
