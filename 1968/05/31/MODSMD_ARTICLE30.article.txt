# Stanford Sophomore:
## New Recording Star? 
### BARBARA HYLAND 
Stanford may pride itself on
its renowned writers, scientists,
and professors, but there is one
area in which it is lacking—rock
n'roll music. Stanford has no
famous singer. But the problem
may soon be alleviated when
Dave Antrell's new record is re
leased.
Dave Antrell, a sophomore
from Pittsburg, California, is an
Alpha Delt and pre-med student.
Music has always interested him
and now he says, "I'm getting
paid for doing things I really
enjoy."

He has perfect pitch and be
gan studying classical piano 10
years ago. He has also worked
with the harmonica and the gui
tar. Although he was never
forced into taking lessons, his
parents "strongly asked me to."
He does not regret it now. Af
ter teaching himself popular pi
ano, he belonged to five different
groups in high school. Last year
when he was a freshman, he
briefly held a contract with Dec
ca.
This year he joined with "The
Rhythm Method," a Stanford
rock n' roll group which in
cludes Bill Ghormley, John Bar
ry, and Rick Bliss. Besides sing

ing for them, he has been writ
ing songs.
His manager in Los Angeles
took some of his work this year
to a recording studio in Bur
bank. Jimmy Haskell, a well
known arranger, saw the songs
and became so enthusiastic that
he decided to try producing for
the first time.
Dave Antrell discussed the
background music arrangements
with Haskell and last Saturday
they taped the background
tracks for six songs. Two songs
will be used for a single and
more will be recorded for a pro
posed album. Dave will do the
voice tracks soon.
For four of the songs, Dave
played the piano and for the oth
er two he played the harpsicoid.
It took 14 hours in a hot studio
to get the proper balance be
tween the instruments which
will all be on one track of the
stereo record. Two of these 14
hours were spent tuning the
harpsicord.
Dave wrote all the songs
which is - unusual since "very
few solo acts write their own
stuff." The record will show his
versatility both as a singer and
a writer. The songs range from
folk-rock to rhythm and blues
to Motown.
ATCO, Columbia, and A and
M are all vying for the right to
produce his record. He expects
the record will be released by
the middle of July although
hopefully earlier.

background music arrangements
with Haskell and last Saturday
they taped the background
tracks for six songs. Two songs
will be used for a single and
more will be recorded for a pro
posed album. Dave will do the
voice tracks soon.
For four of the songs, Dave
played the piano and for the oth
er two he played the harpsicoid.
It took 14 hours in a hot studio
to get the proper balance be
tween the instruments which
will all be on one track of the
stereo record. Two of these 14
hours were spent tuning the
harpsicord.
Dave wrote all the songs
which is - unusual since "very
few solo acts write their own
stuff." The record will show his
versatility both as a singer and
a writer. The songs range from
folk-rock to rhythm and blues
to Motown.
ATCO, Columbia, and A and
M are all vying for the right to
produce his record. He expects
the record will be released by
the middle of July although
hopefully earlier.


DAVE ANTRELL
Stanford may pride itself on
its renowned writers, scientists,
and professors, but there is one
area in which it is lacking—rock
n'roll music. Stanford has no
famous singer. But the problem
may soon be alleviated when
Dave Antrell's new record is re
leased.
Dave Antrell, a sophomore
from Pittsburg, California, is an
Alpha Delt and pre-med student.
Music has always interested him
and now he says, "I'm getting
paid for doing things I really
enjoy."

He has perfect pitch and be
gan studying classical piano 10
years ago. He has also worked
with the harmonica and the gui
tar. Although he was never
forced into taking lessons, his
parents "strongly asked me to."
He does not regret it now. Af
ter teaching himself popular pi
ano, he belonged to five different
groups in high school. Last year
when he was a freshman, he
briefly held a contract with Dec
ca.
This year he joined with "The
Rhythm Method," a Stanford
rock n' roll group which in
cludes Bill Ghormley, John Bar
ry, and Rick Bliss. Besides sing

ing for them, he has been writ
ing songs.
His manager in Los Angeles
took some of his work this year
to a recording studio in Bur
bank. Jimmy Haskell, a well
known arranger, saw the songs
and became so enthusiastic that
he decided to try producing for
the first time.
Dave Antrell discussed the
background music arrangements
with Haskell and last Saturday
they taped the background

will be used for a single and
more will be recorded for a pro
