The Stanford - based Volun
teers in Asia organization has
become the first American vol
unteer group to be asked to In
donesia since the Peace Corps
was forced to leave that country
four years ago.
VIA will send two volunteers,
one for six months and another
for a year, beginning this sum
mer. The two, Doug Aden and
Ken Schweers, will teach Eng
lish at the teacher training in
stitute in Djakarta.
The invitation coincides with
VlA's recent expansion to long
er-term programs. While 43 vol
unteers will leave next month
for summer assignments in
Hong Kong, Macao, Korea, Ja
pan, and the Philippines, an ad
ditional ten will go on six-month
to two-year projects in Japan,
Hong Kong, Philippines, and
Nepal in addition to Indonesia.
The six-month assignments will
be carried out by undergradu
ates, the one- and two-year posts
by students who have just grad
uated.
