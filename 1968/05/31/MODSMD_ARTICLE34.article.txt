# Jim Kauffman: Top Frosh Athlete
## 
### GARY CAVALLI 
It isn't often that one athlete
wins the Most Valuable Player
award for two different fresh
man teams. In fact, until this
year it had never happened be
fore at Stanford.
But versatile Jim Kauffman,
one of the most outstanding ath
letes to come along in several
years, copped both the frosh
football and track MVP trophies
in an unprecedented perfor
mance this year.
Kauffman sparked Terry De-
Sylvia's Papoose eleven to an
impressive 3-1 record last fall,
usually going both ways as a
defensive safety and either
flanker or split end offensive
ly.
The highlight of the frosh
football season was an 18-17
comeback win over USC. Kauff
man played a key role in the vic
tory, taking a 12-yard TD pass
from Don Bunce to put Stan
ford within striking distance at
17-12, then setting up the win
ning score with a 35-yard recep
tion of a Bunce aerial.
Defensively, KaufTman was
spectacular throughout the sea
son, leading varsity coach John
Ralston to predict that the frosh
sensation would soon become an
outstanding safetyman on the
Tribe varsity.
Kauffman led Coach Jerry
Barland's frosh track contin
gent to an undefeated dual
meet season. He won or placed
consistently in four Individual
events — 440, long jump,
triple jump and high jump —
besides running a leg on the
440 and mile relay quartets.
In Stanford's 91%-53y2 rout of
Santa Ana JC, Kauffman broke
Ben Eastman's 38 year-old school

440 record with a 48.0 clocking.
Weeks later, he teamed with
Kevin McNair, Chuck Francis
and Randy White to set a new
440-relay mark of 41.8 against
the Cal frosh.
Other talented freshman ath
letes who deserve note are bas
ketball MVP Dennis O'Neill, rec
ord-shattering swimmer John
Ferris, phenomenal frosh golf
er Tom Watson, future tennis
great Stan Pasarell, frosh base
ball star Steve Dunning, and ace
gymnast Steve Rochelle.
