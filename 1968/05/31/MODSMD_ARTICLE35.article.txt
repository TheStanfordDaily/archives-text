# Athlete Of The Year—Art Harris
## 
### GABY CAVALLI 
The date was March 9, and
Stanford was due to meet Cal in
the final encounter of the 1968
basketball season. The game
was to be the last varsity con
test played in the hallowed Stall
ford Pavilion.
But the 3200 fans who crowd
ed into the Pavilion that March
afternoon had come for only one
reason—to see Art Harris play
his last game in a Stanford uni
form. During the pre-game in
troductions they rose as one to
warmly express their gratitude
for three years of exciting, cour
ageous basketball, giving Harris
a sensational tribute, a three
minute standing ovation.
Harris didn't let them down.
He responded with one of the
finest all-around performances
of his career, a nearly flaw
less exhibition of speed, skill,
and finesse.
Offensively, Harris did it all—
score, pass, dribble. He buried
18 points, contributed his ball
handling wizardry to the Tribe's

penetration of the Cal press, and
passed brilliantly.
Defensively, Harris was all
over the court —pulling down re
bounds, ball-hawking, harassing
opponents under the boards and
around the perimeter. He was
David putting down Goliath as
he blocked three shots by Cal's
6-10 center Bob Presley.
The result of Harris' scintilla
ting effort was a 64-51 Stanford
upset.
This type of performance
was not unusual for the 6-4,
186 pound Los Angeles prod
uct.
As a sophomore Harris ranked
third in Pac-8 point production
with an 18.1 average, and landed
a berth on the conference All-
Star quintet. The highlight of
Art's first varsity season was a
24-point effort in Stanford's 73-
69 miracle upset of UCLA, the
nation's number two team.
Switched to forward in his
junior year to strengthen an in
experienced front line, Harris'
scoring fell off a bit (14.9), but
he led the team in rebounding
and received honorable mention
on the Pac-8 All-Star squad.
Harris found he could out
maneuver taller and heavier
opponents early in the 1967-68
season, and used his speed to
good advantage. A great leap
er with excellent timing, he
began to score consistently
from the inside, complement
ing his deadly foul-line or cor
ner jumper.
He wound up the third leading
scorer in the circuit with a 21.2

average, and in the process
broke Stanford's single season
scoring record with 540 points.
Harris also became the third
leading career scorer in Indian
basketball history, his 1327
points putting him behind Tom
Dose and Ron Tomsic on the
all-time Tribe list.
Stanford coach Howie Dall
mar, often referring to his ver
satile star as "a coach's
dream," considered Harris an
excellent prospect as a guard
in the pro ranks.
Evidently the pro scouts agreed
with him. Harris was drafted by
both the Oakland Oaks of the
ABA and the Seattle Superson
ics of the NBA. The Sonics, who
tabbed Harris on the second
round of the NBA draft, signed
him immediately to a lucrative
contract. So, next year Art will
trade in the red-and-white of
Stanford for the green-and-gold
of the Seattle Supersonics.
Several other athletes per
formed in outstanding fishion
for the Tribe during the 1967-68
athletic year. Those who were
considered for "Athlete of the
Year" include three-time water
polo Ail-American Gary Sheerer,
football-rugby star Blaine Nye,
wrestler Len Borchers, base
ball stars Mike Schomaker, Har
vey Shank, and Rod Poteete,
football ace-trackman Gene
Washington, lacrosse AU-Amer
ican candidate Mel Ellis, harrier
trackman Greg Brock, swim
ming team captain Bob Momsen,
and football-baseball ace Mark
Marquess.

STANFORD BASKETBALL GREAT ART HARRIS

HARRIS IN ACTION
The date was March 9, and
Stanford was due to meet Cal in
the final encounter of the 1968
basketball season. The game
was to be the last varsity con
test played in the hallowed Stall
ford Pavilion.
But the 3200 fans who crowd
ed into the Pavilion that March
afternoon had come for only one
reason—to see Art Harris play
his last game in a Stanford uni
form. During the pre-game in
troductions they rose as one to
warmly express their gratitude
for three years of exciting, cour
ageous basketball, giving Harris
a sensational tribute, a three
minute standing ovation.
Harris didn't let them down.
He responded with one of the
finest all-around performances
of his career, a nearly flaw
less exhibition of speed, skill,
and finesse.
Offensively, Harris did it all—
score, pass, dribble. He buried
18 points, contributed his ball
handling wizardry to the Tribe's

penetration of the Cal press, and
passed brilliantly.
Defensively, Harris was all
over the court —pulling down re
bounds, ball-hawking, harassing
opponents under the boards and
around the perimeter. He was
David putting down Goliath as
he blocked three shots by Cal's
6-10 center Bob Presley.
The result of Harris' scintilla
ting effort was a 64-51 Stanford
upset.
This type of performance
was not unusual for the 6-4,
186 pound Los Angeles prod
uct.
As a sophomore Harris ranked
third in Pac-8 point production
with an 18.1 average, and landed
a berth on the conference All-
Star quintet. The highlight of
Art's first varsity season was a
24-point effort in Stanford's 73-
69 miracle upset of UCLA, the
nation's number two team.
Switched to forward in his
junior year to strengthen an in
experienced front line, Harris'
scoring fell off a bit (14.9), but
he led the team in rebounding
and received honorable mention
on the Pac-8 All-Star squad.
Harris found he could out
maneuver taller and heavier
opponents early in the 1967-68
season, and used his speed to
good advantage. A great leap
er with excellent timing, he
began to score consistently
from the inside, complement
ing his deadly foul-line or cor
ner jumper.
He wound up the third leading
scorer in the circuit with a 21.2

average, and in the process
broke Stanford's single season
scoring record with 540 points.
Harris also became the third
leading career scorer in Indian
basketball history, his 1327
points putting him behind Tom
Dose and Ron Tomsic on the
all-time Tribe list.
