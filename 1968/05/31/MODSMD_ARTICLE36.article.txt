# Ronayne Selected Coach Of The Year
## 
### 
First-year lacrosse coach Don
Ronayne led the Stanford la
crosse team to a perfect 13-0
mark this season, en route to the
Northern California Lacrosse
Association championship.
For his efforts, Ronayne was
named "Coach of the Year" by
the NCLA, and the Daily whole
heartedly goes along with this
selection.
A third-year law student at
Stanford, Ronayne began his la
crosse career at Garden City
High School in Long Island,
New York, where he starred as
a midfielder.
Ronayne studied philosophy
and history at Yale, also contin
uing with lacrosse. He gradu
ated in June, 1965, then entered
the Stanford Law School in Sep
tember of that year.
In this his first year as the
Indian mentor, Ronayne made
a great impression on the
Stanford laxmen. In particular
"he recognizes the problems of
a student athlete, having been
one himself," noted Stanford
goalie Hugh West.
The rookie coach had great
confidence in his team, and in
spired the same type of confi
dence in himself with his expert
coaching tactics.
"We were always able to come
back and win with Ronayne as

coach. We always felt he never
lost confidence in us," West con
fided. "His game plans always
worked."
Ronayne should have a strong
squad again next year, with
only 10 men graduating. Of the
eight men who made the All-
NCLA team, six will be return
ing next season.
Several other Stanford
coaches were also deserving of
"Coach of the Year" honors,
including rugby mentor Pete
Kmetovic, swimming coach
Jim Gaughran, and first-year
baseball coach Ray Young.
Kmetovic coached the Indians
to the Pacific-B's Southern Divi
sion title with an 8-2 mark. The
Tribe beat Church College of
Hawaii, rated the best U.S. Rug
by team in 1967, by a 6-3 score.
Gaughran, in his eighth year
at Stanford, has made the In
dians into contenders for the
NCAA championship in both
water polo and swimming for
the past five years. This season
the Tribe tpok fourth in the
country behind Indiana, Yale,
and USC.
Rookie coach Ray Young was
plagued by injuries to key play
ers (Russ Tweet and Mike Am
mirato) in his quest to direct
the Indians to their second
straight Pac-8 crown.
