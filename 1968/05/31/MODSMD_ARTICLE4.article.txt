## Lyman: ROTC Credit Valid? 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
In an unprecedented "fireside
chat" with 60 students on Wed
nesday afternoon, Provost Rich
ard Lyman stated he is "skepti
cal of the viability and validity
of the present system of ROTC
on campus."
While carefully noting he is
"convinced ROTC has a right
to be on campus," Lyman im
plied he has strong misgivings
about its inclusion in the curric
ulum and said that if the facul
ty voted to revise the system, he
could not foresee serious opposi
tion within the administration
or Board of Trustees.
Lyman made his remarks dur
ing a 90-minute "exchange of

views" with students in the
Tresidder large lounge. He came
at the request of the Tresidder
Union Board. The program was
billed as "Direct Line" to the
provost, and was open to the
public.
Discussion was dominated by
exchanges, sometimes aggres
sive, between Lyman ani sever
al students centrally involved in
the Old Union $it-in.
Asked whether ROTC should
be allowed on campus, Lyman
answered by breaking the
question into two parts, "the
general presence of ROTC,
and the presently constituted
presence." He feels its pres
ence in general is not unrea
sonable since it is a "legiti
mate response to Selective
Service, a problem most male
students face, and many stu
dents want to join ROTC." He
also noted it is not compul
sory.
Several students immediately
questioned Lyman's argument
that ROTC is here because many
students want it. One student
asked why The Experiment, an
experimental educational college
on campus last year which was
supported by 400 students, had
been forced off campus.
Remarking on the role of
trustees in universities today,
Lyman said they face three
problems, "responsiveness, op
enness, and variety in member
ship." He said they should im
prove in each area.
There was lengthy discussion
about government-funded re

search, government scholarships
to students, and recent legisla
tion imposing federal controls
over eligibility.
Lyman called the Wym a n
Amendment, which asserts fed
oral funds will not be given to
students who take part in miH
tant demonstrations, "thorough
ly wrongheaded." He said he
hopes the Senate will not pass
the amendment (it was passed
by the House two woks ago) or
will, at least, modify the lan
guage.
On University Involvement
with IDA. an issue that
sparked the Columbia demon
strations. Lyman explained
that IDA was going through
self-examination and might
suggest ending university

sponsorship. He said Stan
ford's involvement is present
ly under review.
One irate fre~hman, who was
been forced off campus by the
residence draw, questioned Ly
man about the consistency and
correctness of advertising the
residence system at Stanford to
prospective students when the
system has major faults.
Lyman replied that present
problems were only temporary,
and more University living fa
cilities would be constructed as
soon as funds are gathered and
plans have been rethought.
During the discussion, several
students pursued Lyman on
questions of increased student
power and demanded to know
where Lyman stood on the ques
tion of the University's role in
society.
Lyman said he feels student
power must be expanded, but
that the university "can never
be a complete democracy—as
you see it." Lyman stressed
the need for more student in
put above the quality of teach
ing:, commenting: that past
Course Reviews have been in
complete.
Many of the exchanges be
tween Lyman and some of the
aggressive students, stumbled
over semantical debates. Both
Lyman and the students dis
cussed the problems of dialogue,
but the students insisted "mean
ingful dialogue is impossible
when the administration and
Board of Trustees have all the
power. In the sit-in we had
power, and dialogue me ant
something."
One student said, "All we ask
is that our opinions not only be
heard, but that they be acted
upon."

man about the consistency and

In an unprecedented "fireside
chat" with 60 students on Wed
nesday afternoon, Provost Rich
ard Lyman stated he is "skepti
cal of the viability and validity
of the present system of ROTC
on campus."
While carefully noting he is
"convinced ROTC has a right
to be on campus," Lyman im
plied he has strong misgivings
about its inclusion in the curric
ulum and said that if the facul
ty voted to revise the system, he
could not foresee serious opposi
tion within the administration
or Board of Trustees.
Lyman made his remarks dur
ing a 90-minute "exchange of

views" with students in the
Tresidder large lounge. He came
at the request of the Tresidder
Union Board. The program was
billed as "Direct Line" to the
provost, and was open to the
public.
Discussion was dominated by
exchanges, sometimes aggres
sive, between Lyman ani sever
al students centrally involved in
the Old Union $it-in.
Asked whether ROTC should
be allowed on campus, Lyman
answered by breaking the
question into two parts, "the
general presence of ROTC,
and the presently constituted
presence." He feels its pres
ence in general is not unrea
sonable since it is a "legiti
mate response to Selective
Service, a problem most male
students face, and many stu
dents want to join ROTC." He
also noted it is not compul
sory.
Several students immediately
questioned Lyman's argument
that ROTC is here because many
students want it. One student
asked why The Experiment, an
experimental educational college
on campus last year which was
supported by 400 students, had
been forced off campus.
Remarking on the role of
trustees in universities today,
Lyman said they face three
problems, "responsiveness, op
enness, and variety in member
ship." He said they should im
prove in each area.
There was lengthy discussion
about government-funded re

search, government scholarships
to students, and recent legisla
tion imposing federal controls
over eligibility.
Lyman called the Wym a n
Amendment, which asserts fed
oral funds will not be given to
students who take part in miH
tant demonstrations, "thorough
ly wrongheaded." He said he
hopes the Senate will not pass
the amendment (it was passed
by the House two woks ago) or
will, at least, modify the lan
guage.
