# David Harris Found Guilty
## 
### PENNY HILL 
David Harris, ex-ASSU presi
dent, was declared guilty of will
fully refusing induction into the
Armed Forces by a 12-member
jury Wednesday evening.
Following the decision, Judge
Oliver J. Carter pronounced the
sentenceâ€”three years in prison.
Immediate sentencing is not the
usual court procedure; however,
the sentence was stayed. There
is the possibility of parole at
any time.
Harris will remain free pend
ing his appeal for a new trial.,
Harris' attorney, Francis Heisler.
of Carmel, stated he felt there!
was cause for a new trial be
cause, shortly before the
he heard that one of the jurors,'
in a previous case, had told
trial judge that she could not be'
impartial in a draft case.
Judge Carter instructed Hei
sler to verify the information
and include it in the motion for
a new trial. That motion will be
made soon, according to Harris.
Harris was not allowed to
raise a constitutional defense
in the three-day trial. His at
torney was denied the right to
show that Harris' intent in re
fusing induction was to test
the constitutionality of the
draft act and therefore was a
valid reason.
Judge Carter, in barring evi
dence bearing on the constitu
tionality of the act, stripped the
case to two issues: refusal to ac
cept induction, and willful intent
to violate the law.
Before sentencing Harris,
Judge Carter told the defendant
that he was "one of the most
willful violators I have ever
seen." He said that the sentence
would be strictly a punitive mea
sure because "you don't need to
bo rehabilitated, you don't want
to be rehabilitated, and I see no
reason for you to he rehabili
tated."
