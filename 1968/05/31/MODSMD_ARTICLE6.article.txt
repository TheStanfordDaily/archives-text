## California Primary Crucial 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
The battle for the Democratic
nomination for President will
keep hundreds of Stanford stu
dents and faculty occupied for
the next four days in hopes of
giving their candidate victory in
the crucial California primary,
With Sen. Eugene McCarthy's
Oregon primary victory, the im
portance of the California pri
mary has reached a new peak as
both the supporters of McCar
thy and Sen. Robert Kennedy
know that their candidate needs
a decisive victory here to have
any chance of winning the nom
ination in August.
"I thought before the Oregon
primary that for Kennedy to
win he has to win big in Cali
fornia: and unless he wins by a
big margin he too is dead," said
Law Professor Marc Franklin
of the Stanford Kennedy orga
nization.
Robert McAfee Brown, pro
fessor of religion and member
of the McCarthy slate of dele
gates for the Democratic con
vention made the same point
for his candidate: "I hope very
much that the people who have
been supporting Kennedy will
follow the logic of their own
arguments of the past couple of
weeks and switch their support
to McCarthy, so that in the
coming primary we can give a
rousing victory to McCarthy and
thus provide a way to offer a
winning candidate to the Ameri
can people and to keep the
Democrats from the catastrophe
of nominating Vice-President
Humphrey."
The McCarthyites here have
been using the recent Callfor

nia Poll which showed that
McCarthy could beat any of
the Republican candidates in
November to reinforce their
plea for a strong victory for
McCarthy.
However, Franklin claims
"the polls are mercurial." He
pointed out that only last week
Kennedy was leading in the
polls in Oregon yet he lost the
election.
The issues in the battle be
tween the two sides have
changed rapidly. The contest
started out as a contest between
two opposing personalities: the
pragmatist Kennedy and the citi
zen politician McCarthy.
But after Vice-President Hum
phrey's entrance into the race
in April, the two committees
on campus accused each other
of siphoning support away from
their candidate, whom each
group feels has the only chance
to win the nomination, for the
cause they both share.
McCarthy's showing Tuesday
made the disagreement fade in
to the background. The cam
paign polemics have been re
p'aced by a rededication to work
for their candidate.
California has 172 delegates
to the Democratic convention
in August at Chicago. The
voters here will have three
slates of delegates from which
to choose.
One slate, headed by State At
torney General Thoma? Lynch,
is uncommitted, but is seen by
most observers as leaning to
ward Vice-President Humphrey.
Speaker of the State Assembly
Jesse Unruh heads a second

slate of delegates pledge to Sen.
Kennedy.
The third group of delegates
is pledged to Sen McCarthy.
Prof. Brown is on this slate.
The reasons why students
support either of the two major
candidates in the California pri
mary vary. Reese Shepard of
the Kennedy group says,"I
knew what Kennedy has done
and I thought he would be a
strong President. I think that
the overriding issue in the e'ec
tion is the race crisis and the
problems of the cities.
"Kennedy has a stronger rec
ord in those areas than McCar
thy," he said. Shepard cited the
aid the junior Senator from
New York has given to com
munity action programs in Bed
ford-Stuyvesant and elsewhere,
and Kennedy's work as Attor
ney General.
Cesar Chavez, speaking here
for Kennedy on Monday,
agreed with Shepard's an
alysis of Kennedy as the man
who if elected President,
could do the most to help mi
norities. He discussed the aid
Kennedy had given Chavez's
striking grape-pickers union.
He said "the poor feel a close
ness to the senator."
Tom Burke of the Stanford
Committe > for McCarthy said
that he likes McCarthy because
"I believe that he has a thor
ough revision of foreign policy
in mind." He added that he was
n't supporting Kennedy because
he personally wasn't sur - ' that
Kennedy opposed some of the
basic principles of American
foreign policy, such as contain
ment of communism, and coun
ter-insurgency.

OthÂ°r McCarthy supporters
like the Minnesota Senator be
cause of his cool unemotional
style of politics, and because
he risked, in their opinion, his
political future by challenging
President Johnson for the Dem
ocratic nomination last Novem
ber when no one thought it
could be done.
Some Kennedy advocates like
their candidate for the risks he
has taken, both as Attorney
General, in expanding his of
fice's ro'e in securing civil rights
for minorities, and a senator,
speaking out since 1965 against
the war in Vietnam.
McCarthy's Oregon primary
victory came as a surprise to
many, especially Kennedy's sup
porters. Kennedy had said ear
lier in the campaign he had to
win in both Oregon and Califor
nia to have any chance of stop
ping Humphrey at the national
convention.
Kennedy said on Wednesday
that if he lost in California he
would pull out of the race.
However, he has no intention
of pulling 1 out before then.
Ills staff has prepared polls
showing that lie is leading
in California 41 per cent to
25 per cent for McCarthy.
"We have nothing to disprove
those polLs at this point so we're
proceeding on the basis of the
polls," said on~> Kennedy press
aide at the San Francisco office.
The problem the Kennedy or
ganization has is maintaining
that firm lead in the face of a
massive McCarthy door-to-door
canvassing drive.
The McCarthy campaign has
been based since the beginning
on a grassroots personal con
tact with the voters campaign.
Using students as the ,main
force of canvassers the McCar
thy organization has been suc
cessful in the New Hampshire,
Wisconsin, and Oregon primar
ies.
In contract, the Kennedy peo
?iV) have u' ing a public ap
j ' \rnnce and television cam
paign hoping to reach the maxi
mum number of voters. This tac
tic has given Kennedy the Ne
braska and Indiana primaries.

In Oregon, Kennedy's televi
sion tactic seems to have back
fired. Stanford students who can
vassed in Oregon say that many
voters found the frequency and
content of Kennedy's television
spots distasteful.
The Stanford McCarthy
group is preparing to flood the
area around Stanford with
large numbers of students can
vassing door-to-door In the
hopes that they can lo
cate prospective McCarthy vot
ers. On Tuesday, primary day,
they plan to telephone all those
voters who have indicated an
interest in McCarthy and get
them out to vote.

The problom the face is fome
thing thev have found out in
previous canvassing: California
voters are not quite as recep
tive to canvassers as are Ore
gon voters.
The students returning f''om
Oregon canvassing almost all
said that the voters were quite
interred in what thev had to
say. But thi" has not been as
true in California. Thus Ken
nedy's tactic may prove more
useful in California.
McCarthy will be at the Palo
Alto train station at 7:20 p.m.
on Saturday and at the San
Mateo Fair grounds at 8 o'clock
that same night for a forty-min
ute talk.
