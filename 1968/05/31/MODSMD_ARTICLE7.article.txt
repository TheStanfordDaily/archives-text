# C15 Issues Final Plan For Stanford Judiciary
## 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON 
The Committee of Fifteen yes
terday agreed on a "Legislative
and Judicial Charter of 1968" to
replace the current judicial sys
tem which has been under increas
ing attack.
Earlier this month the commit
tee agreed on the framework of a
new judicial system, and the docu
ment appearing on page five of
today's DAILY elaborates on the
earlier statement.
The charter was adopted by the
Committee with twelve affirma
tive votes and three abstentions. All
three absentions were by student
members of the committee.
Faculty representatives would
have a majority on both the rule
making and rule enforcing bodies
established by the charter, but
the students would have an effec
tive veto over the establishment
of new regulations.

The Stanford Judicial Gouncil
(SJC) will have five faculty and
four student members while the
Student Conduct Legislative Coun
cil (SCLC) will have six faculty
and five students with a vote of
seven required for any new rules.
In general, the charter follows
the line of the statement released
by the committee May 8. It does,
however, describe the method for
establishing new regulations, spe
cifying that a minimum of 45 days
must elapse between the initial
proposal and the effective date
of a regulation.
Student members of the SCLC and
SJC will be elected by the student
body, with the exception of the
ASSU president and LASSU speak
er who will serve as ex-officio
members of the SCLC. A system
of proportional representation will
be established for the election of
student members.

Faculty members of both bodies
will be selected by the University
President from a slate of nominees
prepared by a committee of the
Academic Council.
The terms of both student and
faculty members of the two bodies
are the same: one year with one re
election (or selection) possible.
The new system does not change
the ' 'residual authority of the Pres
ident", but the committee states
in the charter that the SCLC and
SJC will have "primary responsi
bility" for rule-making and en
forcing "except in extraordinary
circumstances."
Interim regulations would be
adopted by the SCLC with the writ
ten consent of the President of
the University.
Such regulations may also be
promulgated by the President of
the SCLC as practicable." All in
terim regulations would be effec
tive for a maximum of ninety
days.
The charter provides that "pres
ent University policy" will re
main In effect until the SCLC
makes new regulations. It is ex
pected that the SCLC will begin
its operations early next fall.
Dean of Students Joel Smith
yesterday released a statement
(see page five) outlining a judicial
structure that will take over stu
dent judicial affairs until the
charter goes into effect. This in
terim council will have four facul
ty and three student members.
As with the bodies under the
proposed charter, the student
members will be appointed by a
student-faculty committee on which
students form a majority. Smith
urged all students interested in
serving on the interim body to
apply at the ASSU Office by noon
Monday.
The names of the students ab
staining from the statement were
not released. The student mem
bers of the committee are Dell
H. Martin, John Raskin, Eric
Treisman, John Trim bur and
David Mannheimer.

prepared by a committee of the
Academic Council.
The terms of both student and
faculty members of the two bodies
are the same: one year with one re
election (or selection) possible.
The new system does not change
the ' 'residual authority of the Pres
ident", but the committee states
in the charter that the SCLC and
SJC will have "primary responsi
bility" for rule-making and en
forcing "except in extraordinary
circumstances."
Interim regulations would be
adopted by the SCLC with the writ
ten consent of the President of
the University.
Such regulations may also be
promulgated by the President of
the SCLC as practicable." All in
terim regulations would be effec
tive for a maximum of ninety
days.
The charter provides that "pres
ent University policy" will re
main In effect until the SCLC
makes new regulations. It is ex
pected that the SCLC will begin
its operations early next fall.
Dean of Students Joel Smith
yesterday released a statement
(see page five) outlining a judicial
structure that will take over stu
dent judicial affairs until the
charter goes into effect. This in
terim council will have four facul
ty and three student members.
As with the bodies under the
proposed charter, the student
members will be appointed by a
student-faculty committee on which
students form a majority. Smith
urged all students interested in
serving on the interim body to
apply at the ASSU Office by noon
Monday.
The names of the students ab
staining from the statement were
not released. The student mem
bers of the committee are Dell
H. Martin, John Raskin, Eric
Treisman, John Trim bur and
David Mannheimer.
The Committee of Fifteen yes
terday agreed on a "Legislative
and Judicial Charter of 1968" to
replace the current judicial sys
tem which has been under increas
ing attack.
Earlier this month the commit
tee agreed on the framework of a
new judicial system, and the docu
ment appearing on page five of
today's DAILY elaborates on the
earlier statement.
The charter was adopted by the
Committee with twelve affirma
tive votes and three abstentions. All
three absentions were by student
members of the committee.
Faculty representatives would
have a majority on both the rule
making and rule enforcing bodies
established by the charter, but
the students would have an effec
tive veto over the establishment
of new regulations.

The Stanford Judicial Gouncil
(SJC) will have five faculty and
four student members while the
Student Conduct Legislative Coun
cil (SCLC) will have six faculty
and five students with a vote of
seven required for any new rules.
In general, the charter follows
the line of the statement released
by the committee May 8. It does,
however, describe the method for
establishing new regulations, spe
cifying that a minimum of 45 days
must elapse between the initial
proposal and the effective date
of a regulation.
Student members of the SCLC and
SJC will be elected by the student
body, with the exception of the
ASSU president and LASSU speak
er who will serve as ex-officio
members of the SCLC. A system
of proportional representation will
be established for the election of
student members.

Faculty members of both bodies
will be selected by the University
President from a slate of nominees
prepared by a committee of the
Academic Council.
