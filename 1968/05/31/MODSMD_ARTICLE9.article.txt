## Wallace Sterling 
### 
Someday there will be a sandstone red-tiled Wallace Ster
ling hall or quad or residence or library, and people will ask,
"Who was Wallace Sterling?"
A plaque will say: J. E. Wallace Sterling, Fifth President
of Stanford University, 1949-1968.
But that won't say it.
President Sterling brought Stanford effective leadership
for academic and institutional innovation. No one touted
or joked about the "edge of greatness" before Wallace Ster
ling was president. And nineteen years later he leaves the
Stanford presidency because "every person and every insti
tution needs a change periodically."
Change was Wally's thing: PACE and its $100 million, the
Study of Education, the Medical Center, SLAC, the overseas
campus program, the Committee of 15.
And there were less tangible changes. The "country club"
atmosphere has vanished and in its place are many of the
brightest students and best faculty in the country. The Uni
versity has firmly committed itself to public service, al
though too heavily in defense work.
A university president wears many hats. John Gardner
said last year of Sterling: "The press demand access to him,
donors expect courtesies from him, the general public counts
on him for pontifical statements. If he's not firm enough, the
trustees will scold him; if he's too firm the faculty will go
up in smoke, and that's bad for air pollution. If he's a father
figure, all the students will love him, except those who hate
him."
Wallace Sterling has been many things to us, from an en
lightened administrator to a stalwart reactionary, but we will
remember him as the man who made Stanford worth worry
ing about.
We only hope that his successor can do for the seventies
what he did for tlx; fifties and sixties.
