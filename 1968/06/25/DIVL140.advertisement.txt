Lafayette
Is Here!
And w# thought
you ought to know jV
about it
Stanford regulars know about us, but so many of you
come just for the summer, and perhaps you don't.
Lafayette stores in the Bay Area are associated with
over 225 others throughout the nation to bring you home
electronic needs, many at wholesale prices.
Try us for tubes, TV and FM antennas, blank tape and
tape recorder supplies, diamond phono needles, elec
tronic books, tools, and like that.
Visit us, too, for portable phonos, small radios, stereo
components, tape recorders—not wholesale, but at lowest
possible prices.
You'll like Lafayette—come see.
