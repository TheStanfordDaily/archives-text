# Trustee Unit To Pick Acting President Soon
## 
### 
Trustees will soon appoint an
acting president for Stanford,
Prof. Leonard Schiff of physics
told a meeting of the Faculty's
Academic Council.
Board of Trustees President
W. Palmer Fuller told The Daily
he thought it is very likely the
Trustees would pick the new
man within one or two weeks.
Speculation has it that the in
terim presidency will be filled by
now-Provost Richard Lyman, but
other sources indicate the pro
vost would not want the post.
Schiff, a member of the fac
ulty committee elected to work
with Trustees in search for a
successor to President J. E. Wal
lace Sterling, told the Academic*
Council, "Despite our apparent
lack of success (at finding a per
manent president for the Univer
sity), our committee has been
very active . . . during the past
year."
As a "helpful illustration" of
his committee's work, Schiff

mentioned the University's con
tact witli John Gardner, former
Secretary of Health, Education,
and Welfare, who was named a
Stanford trustee recently, along
with retiring Business School
Dean Ernest Arbuckle.
After an initial "exploratory
contact" last year, Gardner said
he had no intention of leaving
the Cabinet. Several months
later, after "holding exploratory
discussions with at least one
other prospect," the committee
learned of Gardner's resignation
with "considerable shock."
After another approach and
refusal, "we went back to the
drawing board," Schiff said.
This single episode carried us
well into the spring of this year.
'We have not lessened our efforts
since March, but obviously our
search has not reached culmina
tion."
The Academic Council meeting
voted to authorize the establish
ment of an undergraduate major
in African and Afro-American
Studies. The resolution called for
the Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences to appoint a committee to
be responsible for the program.
In other action the Council
overwhelmingly approved th 2
recommendations of the Com
mittee of 15, a faculty-admini
stration-student group that has
been working for two years on
a new student judicial plan for
Stanford.
Under the plan, according to
Committee chairman Prof. Hu
bert Marshall of political science,

"For the first time, students will
have a very important formal
role in creating the rules under
which they live."
The action of the judicial sys
tem, formerly in effect, suspend
ing seven students this spring
triggered the 56-hour sit-in in
the old Union in early May.
This dispersed when the Aca
demic Council substantially ap
proved the student demands.

proved in principle by President
Sterling and the student Legi

slature, will have separate com
mittees for rulo-making and en
forcement. Each would have a
faculty majority, but no rules
could be adopted or deleted uni
laterally by students or faculty.
The new judicial charter will
have to get final presidential
and student approval in the fall.
Meanwhile, an interim body will
be appointed by the dean of stu
dents to handle rule-breaking
problems. Dean Joel Smith said
yesterday that he was still ac
cepting applications for the body.
In another action the results
were announced of the election
for the new Academic Senate,
a smaller body than the 940-
member Academic Council, to
make many faculty decisions.
Fifty-seven per cent of those
eligible cast ballots, electing 34
full professors, 9 associate pro
fessors, and 10 assistant profes

president.
Trustees will soon appoint an
acting president for Stanford,
Prof. Leonard Schiff of physics
told a meeting of the Faculty's
Academic Council.
Board of Trustees President
W. Palmer Fuller told The Daily
he thought it is very likely the
Trustees would pick the new
man within one or two weeks.
Speculation has it that the in
terim presidency will be filled by
now-Provost Richard Lyman, but
other sources indicate the pro
vost would not want the post.
Schiff, a member of the fac
ulty committee elected to work
with Trustees in search for a
successor to President J. E. Wal
lace Sterling, told the Academic*
Council, "Despite our apparent
lack of success (at finding a per
manent president for the Univer
sity), our committee has been
very active . . . during the past
year."
As a "helpful illustration" of
his committee's work, Schiff

mentioned the University's con
tact witli John Gardner, former
Secretary of Health, Education,
and Welfare, who was named a
Stanford trustee recently, along
with retiring Business School
Dean Ernest Arbuckle.
After an initial "exploratory
contact" last year, Gardner said
he had no intention of leaving
the Cabinet. Several months
later, after "holding exploratory
discussions with at least one
other prospect," the committee
learned of Gardner's resignation
with "considerable shock."
After another approach and
refusal, "we went back to the
drawing board," Schiff said.
This single episode carried us
well into the spring of this year.
'We have not lessened our efforts
since March, but obviously our
search has not reached culmina
tion."
The Academic Council meeting
voted to authorize the establish
ment of an undergraduate major
in African and Afro-American
Studies. The resolution called for
the Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences to appoint a committee to
be responsible for the program.
In other action the Council
overwhelmingly approved th 2
recommendations of the Com
mittee of 15, a faculty-admini
stration-student group that has
been working for two years on
a new student judicial plan for
Stanford.
Under the plan, according to
Committee chairman Prof. Hu
bert Marshall of political science,

"For the first time, students will
have a very important formal
role in creating the rules under
which they live."
The action of the judicial sys
tem, formerly in effect, suspend
ing seven students this spring
triggered the 56-hour sit-in in
the old Union in early May.
This dispersed when the Aca
demic Council substantially ap
proved the student demands.

faculty majority, but no rules

The new judicial charter will

and student approval in the fall.
Meanwhile, an interim body will
be appointed by the dean of stu

yesterday that he was still ac
