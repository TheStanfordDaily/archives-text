# Thinclads 10th In NCAA, Nab Thirds In Two Events

### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Two predictably good perfor
mances by Stanford thinclads
and an unexpected success by
distance man Greg Brock gave
the Indians a tie for tenth place
in the NCAA Track and Field
Championships at Berkeley
earlier this month.
Both coming off injuries, high
jumper Peter Boyce and jave
lin thrower Tom Colby took
third places, and Brock, running

the 10,000 meter event for the
first time in his life, finished
fifth.
Since the top six finishers in
each event qualified for th~Â»
Olympic Trials in Los Angeles
this weekend, both Brock and
Colby are eligible. Boyce is an
Australian.
Brock will participate, but
Colby will not, since he will be
at Stanford-in-Germany while
the meet is going on.

Boyce, who has been named
to the Australian Olympic Team,
cleared 7' to finish behind Ore
gon State's Dick Fosbury, the
man who goes over the bar back
wards, 7' 214", and Karl Krem
ser of Tennessee, T 1".
Knee Injury
Boyce jumped 7' 3" back in
March in a dual meet against
Fresno State, but a knee injury
has hurt his record since then.
He has been constantly improv
ing, clearing 6' 10" in the
AAWU conference champion
ships, and 6' 8" at the Fresno
Relays the week before that.
If he regains his early sea
son form, Boyce will offer
Coach Payton Jordan's U.S. high
jumpers some stiff competition
in Mexico City.
Brock, again running in the
dust of Washington State's fab
ulous Gerry Lindgren, ran 10,000
meters (slightly more than six
miles) in 30:05.6, as Lindgren
took the event for the third
straight year with a time of
29:41.0.
Longest Race
This was the longest race
Brock has even run, and he ad
mitted to being a bit bored by
the half-hour stint. But the
longer the distance he runs, the
better he seems to get, as Coach
Jordan noted.
Brock was excited by his qual
ifying for the Trials, and was not
as sharp as usual for the 5,000
meter run two days later. He
finshed well back in the pack
of more than 40 runners, as
Lindgren took this event too,
also for the third consecutive
year.
"He lost the edge" that is need
ed to run a really good race,
Coach Jordan said, and so finish
d 20th.
