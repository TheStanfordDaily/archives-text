# Quad Road To Be Shut
## 
### 
The Stanford campus will bo
torn up in several places this
summer, and the
projects involved will no doubt
heighten the confusion of suri
mer transfer students.
Serra Street, running in front
of the Quad, and Tr ia Crespi will
be closed to traffic for some of
the summer due to the laving
of a chilled water distribution
system, according to the Plan
ning Office. This distribution
system will centralize water
fooling for air conditioning in
University building o .: at pre<ont
air conditioning cooling appara
tus has to be installed separate
ly in each builidng.
A project of interest to long
term Stanford residents v- the
construction of an extension to
Campus Drive from Junipero
Serra Boulevard, which runs be
hind Lake Lagunita, to Serra
Street. The ground breaking for
this road will take place this
summer, and it may be com
pleted near the end of 1%8, ac
cording to the Planning Office.
The third fraternity cluster,
on Campus Drive south of Wil
bur Hall, will probably be com
pleted this August, according
to a Planning Office estimation.
The High Energy Physics ',:ib
oratory is building a tunnel on
the west side of the campus that
is supposed to be finished in
August.
Work continues on the Rosco
Maples Basketball Pavilion on
the north 'ast corner of the cam
pus, and that building should be
done by December. Looming r, n
the west side of the Quad, the
Space Engineering Build''i*
should be done in January 1969,
but by then ground will :>•;

ences Building that will stand
next to th? space building at
