# 'Learn Patience,' Sterling Counsels
## 
### 
University President J. E. Wal
lace Sterling counseled graduat
ing seniors to be patirnt with
the sometimes slow pace of so
cial change in common 1 men!:
exercises June 16 at Frost Am
phitheater.
W. Palmer Fuller, boani of
trustees chairman, announced
after the speech that the trus
tees and other friends of Ster
ling were establishing an en
dowed professorial chair in the
humanities to be named in honor
of Sterling.
"Your chances of further im
proving the human condition are
greater because of the freedoms
and opportunities which you
have inherited," Sterling told the
members of the Class of 1968.
He made his farewell appear
ance as chief executive after 19
years of service before an over

flow c owd of parent •, friends
■md spectators in the amphi
theater.
"I have read and heard," Pres
ident Sterling said, "that in some
minds 'patience' is a dirtv word.
"As a counter to that, let me
suggest that in th > tugging and
hauling of a free society, the
road to social improvement is
not likely to be a race track."
Sterling was invited to be the
77th annual commencement
speaker by the officers of the
senior class.
"Size and complexity tend to
depersonalize; they diminish for
the individual a sense of iden
tity, a sense of belonging. The
individual without this sense of
identity is hazardous to both
himself and society, because
loneliness and despair may
drive him to lash out vengefully,
and because life without mean
ing and purpose makes him a
readier recruit for intemperate
thought and action ..."
Yet, President Sterling point
ed out, "no generation of stu
dents . . . has had more to say
about making their lives mean
ingful and purposeful. None has
is the memory of my gratitude
talked so much about self-iden
tification.
Sometimes these student
voices, he said, "have spoken

without the knowledge and re
sponsibility which they claimed
to possess. They have included
some which admittedly advo
cate tearing down and at the
same time confess that they
have no program for replace
ment.
"But most of these voices ex
pressed an instinct and resolve
to improve the human condi
tion," he said, "and for that I
commend them, thank them and
wish them well.
"I pray that their instinct and
resolve will not be perverted
into nihilism, and that their ar
dor will withstand both the labor
of making a living and the buf
feting of delays and disappoint
ments which flow from human
imperfections."
Sterling recalled with pleasure
his period of service as the Uni
versity's head, adding: "Over
arching all (the other memories)
to my predecessors and their col
leagues for having laid well and
strong the foundations of a uni
versity of high degree, and of
gratit-idc to all who hav 1 fo • the
past 19 years so generously

shared the task of building on
these foundations.
He included in his memories
all the efforts which have been
part of the building process at
Stanford during the past dec
ade and more — ranging from
the moving of the Medical School

from San Francisco to the de
velopment of Stanford lands, the
changes in the curriculum, and
the development of campuses
overseas.
Early in the ceremonies David
Potter, professor of history, was
given the Dinkelspiel Award for

outstanding contributions to un
dergraduate education. He will
receive a stipend of $3500 with
the award. Seniors Rodney Le
vine and Evelyn Hu were given
the Dinkelspiel Student Awards,
with accompanying stipends of
5350 each.
