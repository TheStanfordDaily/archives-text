# University's 'Faculty Farm' Draws 460 Teachers, Staff
## 
### FRIEDRICH ABEL (First of Two Parts) 
Does Stanford's fac ilty prefer
to be separate in its private life
from the ordinar" folk of so
cietv? Superficially considered,
the University's faculty housing
situation might easily create this
impression.
Out of 934 Academic Council
members here, presently '.1* ;t
40 per c nt live in residential
subdivisions on th -? Stanford
campus, 29 per cent in Palo Alto,
and the rest are .scattered main
ly in Los Altos and Los Altos
Hills (9.2 per cent), Menlo Park
(3.8 per cent), and Portola Val
ley (4.2 per cent).
In addition to Academic Coun
cil m mbers a number of staff
ofTicers, considered to be p T
manent employees, are eligible
to lease land in the campus resi
dential area. They bring the
number of Stanford home own
ers to 460 at present.
On completion of the latest
residential subdivision, French
mans Hill — adjacent to al
ready existing homes in the Pine
Hill area the total number
of houses will jump to 650 with
in the next few years. Only 200
faculty homes were on the cam
pus in 1950, then satisfying the
ne»eds of about one third of the
eligible faculty and staff.
Investigating the main motives

of this apparent trend towards
on-campus housing, The Daily
questioned 40 faculty members,
several faculty wives, and some
administrators about their
thoughts on Stanford's faculty
and staff housing poli~v.
Praise ProgTam
All campus residents asked
praised the private r.?sidr n iil
program, some of them with a
few reservations. Out of the 20
who live off campu", 13 would
like to move on campus, while
seven would not like to do so for
different reasons.
The strongest incentive to on
campus housing is financial. The
University offers land on an 80-
year ground lease basr. as a
fringe benefit to its employees
without cost. The lessee must
only pay a lot development cost,
his share of the total develop
ment cost of the subdivision.
Charging lot development costs
back to the lessees enables the
University to recover endowment
funds advanced for the con
struction of streets and utilities.
In Pine Hill Development No.
1 the average development cost
was $3,200. This increased to
$4,800 in Pine Hill No. 2, and
amounts to $7,000 on the aver
age in the Frenchman's Hill sub
division. The costs are assigned
on the basis of size of lot, de
sirability, frontage and so on.

Prices for comparable lots in
the surrounding communities,
about-one third of an acre in
size, tfcgin at around $18,000.
The University subsidizes the
project by picking up the tab for
taxes and interest charges on
unleased lots and by assuming
certain costs not fully charge
able to the subdivision, such as
utilities for future developments.
However, operating costs of
the residential area have to be
covered by the lessees through
annual rentals. In this way Pine
Hill No. 1 and Pine Hill No. 2
a e financially self-sustaining,
according to Edward Scoles, as
sistant business manager for
University housing.
In addition to the land, the
University offers loans to pros
pective on-campus home owners.
i.laximum loans are $45,000 on
newly constructed properties and
purchase of existing homes un
der 10 years of age .These loans
cannot exceed 90% of costs to
mortgage or appraised value,
whichever is less.
Interest rate is five per cent;
terms run up to 40 years on new
construction and 30 years on
existing properties but not be
yond retirement age. Banks usu
ally give loans only on a 20 years
term with at least 7Mi per cent
interest, and their maximum
loan is about three times annual
salary.
Without the financial advant
ages of Stanford's program

many of the younger faculty
could not afford to own houses
on campus, Ecoles said.
He added that more than 40
per cent of the residents in the

Pine Hill subdivisions are new
comers to the faculty and staff.
Unquestionably Stanford's hous
ing situation has been the de
ciding factor in a number of re

cruiting situations, Scoles said.
Nothing; Cheaper
However, a number of profes
sors believe that the standards
already set by existing homes

are too high. They find it diffi
cult to build a $15,000 cabin near
a $75,000 house.
Most houses on the campus
arc valued between $40,000 and
$60,000. Several would sell be
tween $75,000 and $100,000.
Scoles estimates "a low priced
house is in the $35,000 to $42,000
range." He added that people
usually have to be restrained
from stretching their finances to
fit their dreams.
Nevertheless, those who would
like to live on campus, but do not
want to commit themselves on a
$45,000 loan, are offered no
cheaper housing alternatives
such as apartments in larger
residence complexes or rentals.
The convenience of living with
in a few minutes' walk of class
rooms and office, and the pleas
ant environment, are two other
attractions of on-campus hous
ing.
If a professor wants to do
some work in the evening, he
just walks "round the corner"
to his ofTico, as one faculty
member said. The short distance
makes it easy for faculty and
taff wive", to audit lectures, film,
drama, music, or, as one wife re
marked, "watch a sit-in." The
whole relationship with Stan
ford becomes more intimate this
way, a professor said.
Athletic Benefits
Athletic and recreation facili
ties are manifold. The faculty
have formed their own corpora
tion, a recreation association,
which leased a site from the
University, and they built a pri
vate faculty club with swim
ming pool and tennis courts.
Two elementary schools — "of
higher quality than usual," sev
eral professors snid — serve the
community. A third one, Lucille
Nixon School, will be construct
ed soon on Stanford Avenue.
Since most streets end in cul
de-sacs, through traffic is in
hibited, and the housing sub
divisions are quiet and safe
places for children.

praised the private r.?sidr n iil
program, some of them with a
few reservations. Out of the 20
who live off campu", 13 would
like to move on campus, while
seven would not like to do so for
different reasons.
The strongest incentive to on
campus housing is financial. The
University offers land on an 80-
year ground lease basr. as a
fringe benefit to its employees
without cost. The lessee must
only pay a lot development cost,
his share of the total develop
ment cost of the subdivision.
Charging lot development costs
back to the lessees enables the
University to recover endowment
funds advanced for the con
struction of streets and utilities.
In Pine Hill Development No.
1 the average development cost
was $3,200. This increased to
$4,800 in Pine Hill No. 2, and
amounts to $7,000 on the aver
age in the Frenchman's Hill sub
division. The costs are assigned
on the basis of size of lot, de
sirability, frontage and so on.

Prices for comparable lots in
the surrounding communities,
about-one third of an acre in
size, tfcgin at around $18,000.
The University subsidizes the
project by picking up the tab for
taxes and interest charges on
unleased lots and by assuming
certain costs not fully charge
able to the subdivision, such as
utilities for future developments.
However, operating costs of
the residential area have to be
covered by the lessees through
annual rentals. In this way Pine
Hill No. 1 and Pine Hill No. 2
a e financially self-sustaining,
according to Edward Scoles, as
sistant business manager for
University housing.
In addition to the land, the
University offers loans to pros
pective on-campus home owners.
i.laximum loans are $45,000 on
newly constructed properties and
purchase of existing homes un
der 10 years of age .These loans
cannot exceed 90% of costs to
mortgage or appraised value,
whichever is less.
Interest rate is five per cent;
terms run up to 40 years on new
construction and 30 years on
existing properties but not be
yond retirement age. Banks usu
ally give loans only on a 20 years
term with at least 7Mi per cent
interest, and their maximum
loan is about three times annual
salary.
Without the financial advant
ages of Stanford's program

many of the younger faculty
could not afford to own houses
on campus, Ecoles said.
He added that more than 40
per cent of the residents in the

Pine Hill subdivisions are new
comers to the faculty and staff.
Unquestionably Stanford's hous
ing situation has been the de
ciding factor in a number of re

cruiting situations, Scoles said.
Nothing; Cheaper
However, a number of profes
sors believe that the standards
already set by existing homes

are too high. They find it diffi
cult to build a $15,000 cabin near
a $75,000 house.
Most houses on the campus
arc valued between $40,000 and
$60,000. Several would sell be
tween $75,000 and $100,000.
Scoles estimates "a low priced
house is in the $35,000 to $42,000
range." He added that people
usually have to be restrained
from stretching their finances to
fit their dreams.
Nevertheless, those who would
like to live on campus, but do not
want to commit themselves on a
$45,000 loan, are offered no
cheaper housing alternatives
such as apartments in larger
residence complexes or rentals.
The convenience of living with
in a few minutes' walk of class
rooms and office, and the pleas
ant environment, are two other
attractions of on-campus hous
ing.
If a professor wants to do
some work in the evening, he
just walks "round the corner"
to his ofTico, as one faculty
member said. The short distance
makes it easy for faculty and
taff wive", to audit lectures, film,
drama, music, or, as one wife re
marked, "watch a sit-in." The
whole relationship with Stan
ford becomes more intimate this
way, a professor said.
Athletic Benefits
Athletic and recreation facili
ties are manifold. The faculty
have formed their own corpora
tion, a recreation association,
which leased a site from the
University, and they built a pri

sistant business manager for
University housing.
In addition to the land, the
University offers loans to pros
pective on-campus home owners.
i.laximum loans are $45,000 on
newly constructed properties and
purchase of existing homes un
der 10 years of age .These loans
cannot exceed 90% of costs to
mortgage or appraised value,
whichever is less.
Interest rate is five per cent;
terms run up to 40 years on new
construction and 30 years on
existing properties but not be
yond retirement age. Banks usu
ally give loans only on a 20 years
term with at least 7Mi per cent
interest, and their maximum
loan is about three times annual
salary.
Without the financial advant
ages of Stanford's program

many of the younger faculty
could not afford to own houses
on campus, Ecoles said.
He added that more than 40
per cent of the residents in the

Pine Hill subdivisions are new
comers to the faculty and staff.
Unquestionably Stanford's hous
ing situation has been the de
ciding factor in a number of re

cruiting situations, Scoles said.
Nothing; Cheaper
However, a number of profes
sors believe that the standards
already set by existing homes

are too high. They find it diffi
cult to build a $15,000 cabin near
a $75,000 house.
Most houses on the campus
arc valued between $40,000 and
$60,000. Several would sell be
tween $75,000 and $100,000.
Scoles estimates "a low priced
house is in the $35,000 to $42,000
range." He added that people
usually have to be restrained
from stretching their finances to
fit their dreams.
Nevertheless, those who would
like to live on campus, but do not
want to commit themselves on a
$45,000 loan, are offered no
cheaper housing alternatives
such as apartments in larger
residence complexes or rentals.
The convenience of living with
in a few minutes' walk of class
rooms and office, and the pleas
ant environment, are two other
attractions of on-campus hous
ing.
If a professor wants to do
some work in the evening, he
just walks "round the corner"
to his ofTico, as one faculty
member said. The short distance
makes it easy for faculty and

drama, music, or, as one wife re
marked, "watch a sit-in." The

ford becomes more intimate this
way, a professor said.

Does Stanford's fac ilty prefer
to be separate in its private life
from the ordinar" folk of so
cietv? Superficially considered,
the University's faculty housing
situation might easily create this
impression.
Out of 934 Academic Council
members here, presently '.1* ;t
40 per c nt live in residential
subdivisions on th -? Stanford
campus, 29 per cent in Palo Alto,
and the rest are .scattered main
ly in Los Altos and Los Altos
Hills (9.2 per cent), Menlo Park
(3.8 per cent), and Portola Val
ley (4.2 per cent).
In addition to Academic Coun
cil m mbers a number of staff
ofTicers, considered to be p T
manent employees, are eligible
to lease land in the campus resi
dential area. They bring the
number of Stanford home own
ers to 460 at present.
On completion of the latest
residential subdivision, French
mans Hill — adjacent to al
ready existing homes in the Pine
Hill area the total number
of houses will jump to 650 with
in the next few years. Only 200
faculty homes were on the cam
pus in 1950, then satisfying the
ne»eds of about one third of the
eligible faculty and staff.
Investigating the main motives

of this apparent trend towards
on-campus housing, The Daily
questioned 40 faculty members,
several faculty wives, and some
administrators about their
thoughts on Stanford's faculty
and staff housing poli~v.
Praise ProgTam
All campus residents asked
praised the private r.?sidr n iil
program, some of them with a
few reservations. Out of the 20
who live off campu", 13 would
like to move on campus, while
seven would not like to do so for
different reasons.
The strongest incentive to on
campus housing is financial. The
University offers land on an 80-
year ground lease basr. as a
fringe benefit to its employees
without cost. The lessee must
only pay a lot development cost,
his share of the total develop
ment cost of the subdivision.
Charging lot development costs
back to the lessees enables the
University to recover endowment
funds advanced for the con
struction of streets and utilities.
In Pine Hill Development No.
1 the average development cost
was $3,200. This increased to
$4,800 in Pine Hill No. 2, and
amounts to $7,000 on the aver
age in the Frenchman's Hill sub
division. The costs are assigned
on the basis of size of lot, de
sirability, frontage and so on.

Prices for comparable lots in
the surrounding communities,
about-one third of an acre in
size, tfcgin at around $18,000.
The University subsidizes the
project by picking up the tab for
taxes and interest charges on
unleased lots and by assuming
certain costs not fully charge
able to the subdivision, such as
utilities for future developments.
However, operating costs of
the residential area have to be
covered by the lessees through
annual rentals. In this way Pine

cial Segregation?)
Does Stanford's fac ilty prefer
to be separate in its private life
from the ordinar" folk of so
cietv? Superficially considered,
the University's faculty housing
situation might easily create this
impression.
Out of 934 Academic Council
members here, presently '.1* ;t
40 per c nt live in residential
subdivisions on th -? Stanford
campus, 29 per cent in Palo Alto,
and the rest are .scattered main
ly in Los Altos and Los Altos
Hills (9.2 per cent), Menlo Park
(3.8 per cent), and Portola Val
ley (4.2 per cent).
In addition to Academic Coun
cil m mbers a number of staff
ofTicers, considered to be p T
manent employees, are eligible
to lease land in the campus resi
dential area. They bring the
number of Stanford home own
ers to 460 at present.
On completion of the latest
residential subdivision, French
mans Hill — adjacent to al
ready existing homes in the Pine
Hill area the total number
of houses will jump to 650 with
in the next few years. Only 200
faculty homes were on the cam
pus in 1950, then satisfying the
ne»eds of about one third of the
eligible faculty and staff.
Investigating the main motives

of this apparent trend towards
on-campus housing, The Daily
questioned 40 faculty members,
several faculty wives, and some
administrators about their
thoughts on Stanford's faculty
and staff housing poli~v.
Praise ProgTam
All campus residents asked
praised the private r.?sidr n iil
program, some of them with a
few reservations. Out of the 20
who live off campu", 13 would
like to move on campus, while
seven would not like to do so for
different reasons.
The strongest incentive to on
campus housing is financial. The
University offers land on an 80-
year ground lease basr. as a
fringe benefit to its employees
without cost. The lessee must
only pay a lot development cost,
his share of the total develop
ment cost of the subdivision.
Charging lot development costs
back to the lessees enables the
University to recover endowment
funds advanced for the con
struction of streets and utilities.
In Pine Hill Development No.
1 the average development cost
was $3,200. This increased to
$4,800 in Pine Hill No. 2, and
amounts to $7,000 on the aver
age in the Frenchman's Hill sub
division. The costs are assigned
on the basis of size of lot, de
sirability, frontage and so on.

Prices for comparable lots in
the surrounding communities,
about-one third of an acre in
size, tfcgin at around $18,000.
The University subsidizes the
project by picking up the tab for
taxes and interest charges on
unleased lots and by assuming
certain costs not fully charge
able to the subdivision, such as
utilities for future developments.
However, operating costs of
the residential area have to be
covered by the lessees through
annual rentals. In this way Pine
Hill No. 1 and Pine Hill No. 2
a e financially self-sustaining,
according to Edward Scoles, as
sistant business manager for
University housing.
In addition to the land, the
University offers loans to pros
pective on-campus home owners.
i.laximum loans are $45,000 on
newly constructed properties and
purchase of existing homes un
der 10 years of age .These loans
cannot exceed 90% of costs to
mortgage or appraised value,
whichever is less.
Interest rate is five per cent;
terms run up to 40 years on new
construction and 30 years on
existing properties but not be
yond retirement age. Banks usu
ally give loans only on a 20 years
term with at least 7Mi per cent
interest, and their maximum
loan is about three times annual
salary.
Without the financial advant
ages of Stanford's program

many of the younger faculty
could not afford to own houses
on campus, Ecoles said.
He added that more than 40
per cent of the residents in the

Pine Hill subdivisions are new
comers to the faculty and staff.
Unquestionably Stanford's hous
ing situation has been the de
ciding factor in a number of re

cruiting situations, Scoles said.
Nothing; Cheaper
However, a number of profes
sors believe that the standards
already set by existing homes

are too high. They find it diffi
cult to build a $15,000 cabin near
a $75,000 house.
Most houses on the campus
arc valued between $40,000 and
$60,000. Several would sell be
tween $75,000 and $100,000.
Scoles estimates "a low priced
house is in the $35,000 to $42,000
range." He added that people
usually have to be restrained
from stretching their finances to
fit their dreams.
Nevertheless, those who would
like to live on campus, but do not
want to commit themselves on a
$45,000 loan, are offered no
cheaper housing alternatives
such as apartments in larger
residence complexes or rentals.
