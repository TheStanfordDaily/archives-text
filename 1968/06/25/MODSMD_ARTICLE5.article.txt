# University's 'Faculty Farm' Draws 460 Teachers, Staff
## 
### FRIEDRICH ABEL (First of Two Parts) 
Does Stanford's fac ilty prefer
to be separate in its private life
from the ordinar" folk of so
cietv? Superficially considered,
the University's faculty housing
situation might easily create this
impression.
Out of 934 Academic Council
members here, presently '.1* ;t
40 per c nt live in residential
subdivisions on th -? Stanford
campus, 29 per cent in Palo Alto,
and the rest are .scattered main
ly in Los Altos and Los Altos
Hills (9.2 per cent), Menlo Park
(3.8 per cent), and Portola Val
ley (4.2 per cent).
In addition to Academic Coun
cil m mbers a number of staff
ofTicers, considered to be p T
manent employees, are eligible
to lease land in the campus resi
dential area. They bring the
number of Stanford home own
ers to 460 at present.
On completion of the latest
residential subdivision, French
mans Hill — adjacent to al
ready existing homes in the Pine
Hill area the total number
of houses will jump to 650 with
in the next few years. Only 200
faculty homes were on the cam
pus in 1950, then satisfying the
ne»eds of about one third of the
eligible faculty and staff.
Investigating the main motives

of this apparent trend towards
on-campus housing, The Daily
questioned 40 faculty members,
several faculty wives, and some
administrators about their
thoughts on Stanford's faculty
and staff housing poli~v.
Praise ProgTam
All campus residents asked
praised the private r.?sidr n iil
program, some of them with a
few reservations. Out of the 20
who live off campu", 13 would
like to move on campus, while
seven would not like to do so for
different reasons.
The strongest incentive to on
campus housing is financial. The
University offers land on an 80-
year ground lease basr. as a
fringe benefit to its employees
without cost. The lessee must
only pay a lot development cost,
his share of the total develop
ment cost of the subdivision.
Charging lot development costs
back to the lessees enables the
University to recover endowment
funds advanced for the con
struction of streets and utilities.
In Pine Hill Development No.
1 the average development cost
was $3,200. This increased to
$4,800 in Pine Hill No. 2, and
amounts to $7,000 on the aver
age in the Frenchman's Hill sub
division. The costs are assigned
on the basis of size of lot, de
sirability, frontage and so on.

Prices for comparable lots in
the surrounding communities,
about-one third of an acre in
size, tfcgin at around $18,000.
The University subsidizes the
project by picking up the tab for
taxes and interest charges on
unleased lots and by assuming
certain costs not fully charge
able to the subdivision, such as
utilities for future developments.
However, operating costs of
the residential area have to be
covered by the lessees through
annual rentals. In this way Pine
Hill No. 1 and Pine Hill No. 2
a e financially self-sustaining,
according to Edward Scoles, as
sistant business manager for
University housing.
In addition to the land, the
University offers loans to pros
pective on-campus home owners.
i.laximum loans are $45,000 on
newly constructed properties and
purchase of existing homes un
der 10 years of age .These loans
cannot exceed 90% of costs to
mortgage or appraised value,
whichever is less.
Interest rate is five per cent;
terms run up to 40 years on new
construction and 30 years on
existing properties but not be
yond retirement age. Banks usu
ally give loans only on a 20 years
term with at least 7Mi per cent
interest, and their maximum
