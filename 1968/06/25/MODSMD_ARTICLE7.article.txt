The tragedy of (he death of Robert Kennedy has caused a great
deal of speculation that the senator's brother, Edward Kennedy,
would be chosen as the vice-presidential candidate by the Demo
crats in their late August convention.
But much as we respect what the Kennedy family has given
this country, we cannot but view with horror the Humphrey-
Kennedy slate being proposed. To be sure, this horror is due to
a large extent to Humphrey's continued stupid approach to the
youth ef America, his good-natured but foolish "politics of joy.
We find it very hard to believe that Humphrey would not feel
himself committed to the bankrupt priorities espoused by the
man he would succeed. And we would find ourselves stili in
Vietnam and still unable to deal with poverty and the problems
of minorities in any but the most cursory way.
Moreover Kennedy's candidacy seems a clear ploy to appeal
to the masses of Americans to whom his surname is revered
magic. It is riot a move that will inspire idealistic reevaluation of
the forces in American life; it would rather tend to confirm yet
more sainthood on Kennedy's sainted family. And presumably
it would confirm the election of the joyful — as opposed to the
thoughtful — man from Minnesota.
This sort of obvious intrigue, this playing with the hearts of
Americans, is utterly to be deplored. We had hoped the youngest
Kennedy brother could have seen it for what it is and rejected
any possibility of a vice-presidential offer, unless from a man
who can give the youth of America and downtrodden peoples
within our lw)rder the new programs and the new vision we
now desperately need.
