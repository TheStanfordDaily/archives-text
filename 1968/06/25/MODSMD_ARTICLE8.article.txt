Id mid-June the Supreme Court denied a hearing to the appeal
of a former managing editor of the University of Oregon I >.iil\
Emerald who had refused to give a grand jury the names of sev
en youths she interviewed for a story on mariquana use. The
young journalist was fined $300 for contempt of court.
We realize that the Supreme Court has many other things to
do, hut we find it distressing indeed to hear of this Court's con
doning the supression of freedom of the press to question who
ever it can and to guarantee that those interviewed can keep their
anonymity.
To force journalists to expose their sources keeps them from
considering in detail many of the major issues facing the country
issues which the political system is barely recognizing and
which the courts themselves view with an archaic eye.
The sentence is not stiff, hut the principle is essential. To keep
sources anonymous is not to condone illegal activity. But il
serves the essential function of intimately analyzing the nature
of the ills of our society and of the movements, perhaps officially
condemned, which quietly are altering our land.
