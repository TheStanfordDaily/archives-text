# 'Faculty Farm' A Company Town?
## 
### FRIEDRICH ABEL (Second of Two Parts) 
Although on-campus housing
seems to offer overwhelming in
centives, many professors choose
not to live in a "company town,
a segregated community," or In
a situation of "social inbreed
ing," as some remarked.
Also campus residents used
the term "segregation," com
menting that economic or social
isolation was "an t inevitable
thing living on the Peninsula."
(See examples of dwellings in
the Pine Hill 2 development.)

Professor of both groups, on
and off campus, feel that a com
munity composed of people rep
resenting a relatively narrow
professional and economic range
creates an extremely one-sided
environment.
Such "withdrawal from the
problems of the surrounding
communities," and from con
tacts with minority groups and
"a cross section of society,"
would make them feel as if they
were living in a self-manufac
tured ghetto, said some profes
sors who live off campus.

Realistic contacts with the
world in a naturally grown com
munity are necesary to learn
the problems of such groups,
said Joseph Katz, director of the
Institute for the Study of Hu
man Problems here. He illus
trated the point by alluding to
the possibly positive effects on
student housing having all pro
fessors living in dormitories at
some time in their careers.
Town Realities
However, several professors
who had lived in Palo Alto be

fore moving on campus, called
Palo Alto the "most segregated
town imaginable." There they
had lived in an isolated faculty
colony within an upper middle
class group under the same as
pects of "segregation as may be
present on campus," one profes
sor said.
It would be necessary to live
in parts of Menlo Park or in
East Palo Alto if a professor
does not want to escape from
the realities of average Ameri
can communities, another fac
ulty member said. Nevertheless,

many of the younger faculty
first settling in less plush neigh
borhoods or surrounding com
munities to live with a cross
section of society soon move to
Palo Alto or on campus, accord
ing to Robert Walker, chairman
of the subcommittee on faculty
housing.
Community involvement is a
very individual question, said
Joseph Scroggs, director of the
personnal office. Those who want
to do something additional to
academic work "do it regardless

of living on or off campus," he
mid.
Social segregation is only ap
parent at Stanford, Walker said.
"As a group, the faculty tends
to be segregated by reason of
intellectual commitment," he
said. Men heavily occupied with
their jobs tend to seek the com
pany of professional colleagues,
with similar interests and life
goals, he said.
Good Neighbors
Other faculty members living
on campus mentioned the "more
liberal and progressive world,"
the "stimulating neighbors who
add several dimensions to one's
life"; some noted the ease with
which closer relationships with
students can be established
when living on campus.
"The degree of isolation for
children living on campus is
relatively low," said child psy
chologist Eleanor Maccoby who
lives on rampus herself. The
children usually start very early
traveling with their parents and
interacting with people from all
fields of knowledge. Perhaps
more contacts with others out
side the academic way of life
might be desirable, Mrs. Mac
coby said.
Relating to this, the situation
in the two campus elementary
schools in encouraging. Escondi
do School is composed «ti 41 per
cent off-campus dtildraat 44 per
cent pupils from Eseondido Vil
lage (with many foreign chil
dren), and 15 per cent from Pine
Hill
Stanford Elementary has about
20 per cent off-campus children.
33 per cent foreign children, and
the rest from Stanford. (Stan
ford Elementary is planned to
be closed down in some future
time "because of inefficiency
and lack of space," Scoles said.)
A certain percentage of children
from outside will also be main
tained at the new Lucille Nixon
School, Scoles said.

Almost non-existent in the two
schools are children from mi
nority groups. Several profes
sors emphasized their displeas
ure with this situation, adding
that only a change in the com
position of Stanford's faculty
would bring improvements in
this direction.
Segregation?
Two main problems make the
Stanford faculty housing pro
gram somewhat controversial:
economic and social segregation.
Economic segregation — high
standards of on-campus housing,
and no University loans for off
campus projects. Social segre
gation—46o families huddled to
gether on Stanford land and
somewhat cut off from the rest
of the world.
In regard to economic segre
gation Scoles said that "the ad
ministration is very anxious to
get less expensive housing avail
able for junior faculty and staff
members."
In some future time multiple
unit houses might be built on
campus for younger faculty and
emeriti—"perhaps on a rental
basis," said Worth Blaney, fac
ulty-staff housing coordinator.
In tnc Frenchman's Hill Sub
division an area of 20 acres on
Page Mill Road is hot included
in the development. This area
has been reserved for additional
osidential use, such as town
houses or garden apartments,
according U> Scoles.
A town house might cost $40,-
000, Scoles said. However, much
depends on faculty and staff in
terest how the reserved area
will be used, he said.
Off Campus Loans?
Could University loans be
given (o Stanford employees
who would like to build their
houses off campus?

There are no plans in this di
rection, Walker said. A fair bal
ance exists between the more
expensive bank loans and the
financial disadvantages of on
campus building, he said.
The campus property values
have kept pace with those in
nearby cities. But the market on
campus is limited by University
regulations that permit homes
to be sold only to professors and
permanent staff employees.
Other limitations like the rule
that heirs may keep a campus
home only if they themselves
are connected with Stanford
makes off-campus building a
much better investment, Walk
er said.
Offering loans also to people
who want to buy or build a
house outside Stanford would
not only make the University
compete with banks, but also
overdraw Stanford's investment
pool and overly expand the Uni
versity's administrative opera
tions, Blaney said.
