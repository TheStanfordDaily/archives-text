# 'Faculty Farm' A Company Town?
## 
### FRIEDRICH ABEL (Second of Two Parts) 
Although on-campus housing
seems to offer overwhelming in
centives, many professors choose
not to live in a "company town,
a segregated community," or In
a situation of "social inbreed
ing," as some remarked.
Also campus residents used
the term "segregation," com
menting that economic or social
isolation was "an t inevitable
thing living on the Peninsula."
(See examples of dwellings in
the Pine Hill 2 development.)

Professor of both groups, on
and off campus, feel that a com
munity composed of people rep
resenting a relatively narrow
professional and economic range
creates an extremely one-sided
environment.
Such "withdrawal from the
problems of the surrounding
communities," and from con
tacts with minority groups and
"a cross section of society,"
would make them feel as if they
were living in a self-manufac
tured ghetto, said some profes
sors who live off campus.

Realistic contacts with the
world in a naturally grown com
munity are necesary to learn
the problems of such groups,
said Joseph Katz, director of the
Institute for the Study of Hu
man Problems here. He illus
trated the point by alluding to
the possibly positive effects on
student housing having all pro
fessors living in dormitories at
some time in their careers.
Town Realities
However, several professors
who had lived in Palo Alto be

fore moving on campus, called
Palo Alto the "most segregated
town imaginable." There they
had lived in an isolated faculty
colony within an upper middle
class group under the same as
pects of "segregation as may be
present on campus," one profes
sor said.
It would be necessary to live
in parts of Menlo Park or in
East Palo Alto if a professor
does not want to escape from
the realities of average Ameri
can communities, another fac
ulty member said. Nevertheless,

many of the younger faculty
first settling in less plush neigh
borhoods or surrounding com
munities to live with a cross
section of society soon move to
Palo Alto or on campus, accord
ing to Robert Walker, chairman
of the subcommittee on faculty
housing.
Community involvement is a
very individual question, said
Joseph Scroggs, director of the
personnal office. Those who want
to do something additional to
academic work "do it regardless
