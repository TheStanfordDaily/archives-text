Stanford apparently offers
good sleeping in many unoffi
cially-recognized areas. A 19-
year old Foothill College student
was found sleeping in the Cro

day morning and since he had
no reason to be there, was fold
by Stanford police to stay off
campus. He had been found

Main Library a year ago, and
warned at that time as well.
