## Joffrey Triumphs 
### THOMAS STOCKFISCH 
For the second straight year,
Npw York's City Center Joffrey
Ballet has provided a trium
phant opening for the Stanford
Summer Festival.
The company, which will be
here through Sunday, is pre
senting eleven ballets from its
varied repertory. Six of these
were displayed in the first two
performances Tuesday and
Wednesday nights.
Two works which were seen
here last year, "Sea Shadow"
and "Vivi Vivaldi!," both chor
eographed by the company's as
sistant director Gerald Arpino,
again rated bravos from the Me
morial Hall audiences.
Most anticipated of the
troupe's new offerings, due to
a "Time" cover feature in
March, was "Astarte," choreo
graphed by the company's tal
ented director Robert Joffrey,
with a score composed and per
formed by the Crome Syrcus.
"Astarte" (the name is that of
a Phoenician fertility goddess)
is a relentless blending of dance,
colored lights, a painted body,
ear-splitting rock sounds (which
curiously drift off into bluesy
jazz), and film clips of the dance
itself projected on a distorted
backdrop.
While interesting for its feats
of technical coordination and
use of "theatrical" conventions
"Astarte" labors unduly hard to
be "with it." It is in this re
spect reminiscent of the portly
middle-aged types who, dressed
with studied carelessness, make
a night of it at the Avalon.
They think that by doing "the"
thing/ they are doing their thing.
Unquestionably the most im
pressive of the new ballets
which I saw is Arpino's
"Clowns", a stunning visual
spectacle. This work also makes
gratuitous obeisance to the con
temporary (it begins with the
sound of bombs falling and ex
ploding), but it derives its vi
tality from an unusual sensi
tivity to the universal and en
during human experience of the
cycle of destruction and regene
ration.
In the lead role, Robert Blank

shine sustains a superlative
characterization, transporting us
from joy at the coming of life
to lamentation at Its loss.
Also presented by the troupe
were Jerome Robbins "Moves,"
a notable instance of coordina
tion because it is dance without
musical accompaniment, and
Arpino's "Secret Places," which
I thought fraught with ballet

cliches, but in which Lisa Brad
ley again danced with perfec
tion.
At this writing, tickets are
available only for the Sunday
matinee, which includes
"Clowns," "Secret Places," and
"Cakewalk," a light and happy
treat which the company pre
sented here last year, and which
should not be missed.
