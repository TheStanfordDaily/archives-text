# Military Research Project Draws 25 College Editors

### THOMAS C. DAWSON 
Twenty-five college editors on
a research project funded by the
Air Force?
That's right.
Ton days ago I reported to
System Development Corpora
tion in Santa Monica along with
more than twenty other college
editors to take part in a non
classified basic research project.
The project involved a "Simula
'jon of Middle Eastern Relations
in 1973."
A simulation is a computer
assisted "game" in which par
ticipants assume a role (as lead
ers of a country, for example)
and attempt to act as the real
person would.
System Development Corpora
tion (SDC) is a government-fi
nanced "think tank" which does
research for both public and pri
vate agencies in fields ranging
from top secret Vietnam-con

nctod projects to studies of
methods of improving library
cataloguing.
While our work was non-class
ified, we saw evidence of securi
ty precautions ranging from
signs on walls warning of the
"security dangers" of foreign
travel to doors labeled "Classi
fied Waste" with combination
locks and narrow slits (to in
sert the "classical waste" In).
Added to that, when we
signed our names to the guest
list at the door of SDC, we saw
two guards watching panels of
closed circuit televisions, each
trained on a door. Whenever
someone walked through one of
the doors a guard would make a
notation in his log book.
Finally, as we signed our
names on the list (indicating
what country we were from) we
could not avoid seeing a plaque
on the table warning that viola-

V
tions of the Espionage Act
were punishable by fines of up
to $10,000 and imprisonment of
up to thirty years (in time of
peace).
After penetrating the formid
able security barrier, we were
led to a conference room where
we were to be told more about
our work. At the front of the
room was a curtain behind
which was a black board.
One of the more enterprising
of our group immediately drew
a peace symbol on the board
which really didn't blend in too
well with the surroundings.
When the symbol was discov
ered, it was promptly erased
Out of sight, out of mind.
After having to read sheafs
of material on the Middle East,
we were divided into six teams
of four each. The teams includ
ed Israel, Egypt, the United
States, Russia, Other Middle
Eastern Countries and the Rest
of the World.
The simulation involved a cri
sis between Israel and the Arab
countries that arose when Is
rael was discovered to have de
veloped and stockpiled an atom
ic bomb.
.Tust what the psychologists
running the simulation hoped to
get out of the project is un
clear. It was originally sched
uled to run for four days, but
they call, d the whole affair off
after two and a half days be
cause they wore not getting any
"useful" data.
One explanation might be that
thev had twenty-five pacifists
"running" the governments of
Russia, the U.S., Egypt and Is
rael. That's not far from the
truth.
