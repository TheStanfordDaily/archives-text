# IDA Ends Relation With Universities
## 
### 
Stanford is one of 12 educa
tional institutions whose corpo
rate memberships in the Insti
tute for Defense Analyses (IDA)
officially have been terminated
by the institute.
The action, reported by the
University Tuesday, was taken
earlier this month in a meeting
of IDA trustees in Washington.
IDA has come under attack
from some students, notably at
Columbia University during the
complex" that they charge is
corrupting universities.
The present move is seen by

recent disturbances there, as an
arm of the "military-industrial
some observers as an effort to
free the universities from the
potential embarassment of anti-
IDA demonstrations.
Membership in the organiza
tion, which previously consisted
of the 12 universities, will now
be drawn from individuals in
academic and public life. Pro
vost Emeritus Frederick Ter
man of Stanford will continue
to serve in an individual capac
ity as a trustee of the institute.
which is a non-profit, govern
ment-sponsored research organi
zation.
Terman and other university
representatives agreed to serve
initially as individual members
of IDA to assure its strength
and continuity during this tran
sition.
President J. E. Wallace Ster
ling told The Daily that this
ch inge had been planned for 18
months because the institute,
originally founded by universi
ties to give new perspectives on
government problems, has
grown sufficiently to warrant
structural independence from
the founding institutions.
Sterling said he believes IDA
has done an "invaluable ser
vice" to the country by utilizing
the knowledge of academicians
in dealing with government de
fense problems.
In an interview reported by
The New York Times, IDA Vice
president and General Manager
Norman Christeller said the
main reason for the institute's
ties with the academic commu
nity "is to be certain we don't
become a handmaiden of the
government."
At their June meeting, IDA
trustees unanimously affirmed
"the need for IDA to be able to
continue to serve as a strong,
independent, highly skilled re
search organization, actively en
gaged in studies directed at crit
ical problems of the national se
curity and public welfare of the
U.S."
Individuals from th(> following
former corporate members of
the IDA have agreed to contin
ue in individual capacities on its
board: California, Caltech, Case
Western Reserve, Chicago, Co
lumbia, Illinois, MIT, Michigan,
Pennsylvania State, Princeton,
and Tulane.
