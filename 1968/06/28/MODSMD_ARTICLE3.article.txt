# IDA Ends Relation With Universities
## 
### 
Stanford is one of 12 educa
tional institutions whose corpo
rate memberships in the Insti
tute for Defense Analyses (IDA)
officially have been terminated
by the institute.
The action, reported by the
University Tuesday, was taken
earlier this month in a meeting
of IDA trustees in Washington.
IDA has come under attack
from some students, notably at
Columbia University during the
complex" that they charge is
corrupting universities.
The present move is seen by

recent disturbances there, as an
arm of the "military-industrial
some observers as an effort to
free the universities from the
potential embarassment of anti-
IDA demonstrations.
Membership in the organiza
tion, which previously consisted
of the 12 universities, will now
be drawn from individuals in
academic and public life. Pro
vost Emeritus Frederick Ter
man of Stanford will continue
to serve in an individual capac
ity as a trustee of the institute.
