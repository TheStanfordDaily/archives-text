# Schlesinger Shuns Present Candidates
## 
### 
Although the conference of
newspaper editors held this
week at Stanford was supposed
to be about the office itself and
not this year's candidates, key
note speaker Arthur Schlesinger
managed to get in his political
licks.
Schlesinger, author, historian,
former adviser to the late Pres.
John Kennedy and strong back
er of the late Sen. Robert Ken
nedy, said he would support
none of the present candidates
as he addressed 47 editors, edi
torial writers, and political edi
tors from across the country
Monday night in Roble Hall and
held a press conference Tues
day.
The other major speaker at
the conference, sponsored by the
Professional Journalism Fellow
ship Program, was Charles
"Chip" Bohlen, Deputy Under
secretary of State.
Other speakers included Time
White House correspondent
Il'iijh Seidy and New York
Times White House expert Max
lankel.
Bleak Selection
Schlesinger said the assassina
tion of Robert Kennedy left "a
rather bleak selection of candi
dates," with New York Gov.
Nelson Rockefeller the best of
those left.
Former Vice-President Rich
ard M. Nixon "would be a disas
ter no matter how you looked
at it,"he said. Schlesinger also
called him "a man totally empty
of principle."
"I've always believed one
thing the American people
would never do is elect Richard
Nixon president," he added.
The Democratic candidates
havu- their weak points too, he
said.
"For those who cared about

Kennedy's position on foreign
affairs, McCarthy is the logical
place to go, but for those who
cared about Kenndy's position
on domestic affairs, Humphrey
is the place to go."
In his address, Schlesinger
said he felt the United States
was entering an era of weak
presidents, as a reaction to the
methods of President Johnson.
He said this would be unfor
tunate, because although presi
dential power as now wielded is
too great over foreign affairs it
is not strong enough to deal
with the racial and urban crises
at home.
Schlesinger blamed Johnson
for the situation because he in
creased and enlarged America's
commitment in Vietnam on his
own.
He traced the development of
the presidency through the
years, noting that traditionally
weak presidents have followed
strong ones.
First Liberal
Sen. McCarthy, he said, is the
first liberal candidate in this
' ra. in oppose the concept of a
strong president. Rockefeller, he
claimed, would be the most like
ly to be a strong executive.
Bohlen, in his talk, also noted
the increase of presidential
power, citing that in 1967 there
were 267 presidential agree
ments made with other nations,
only ten of which were approved
by Congress.
He suggested that one method
of checking this strength would
be to have all federal officials---
the president as well as con
gressmen—stand for election
every four years.
This would end lame-d uc k
terms, Bohlen felt, and put for
eign policy on a party-line basis,
somewhat similar to the British
system.
The Vietnam war is constitu
tional, and we entered it under
one of five legal methods, Prof.
Robert Horn told waiters a n i
ifr >rs Tuesday in Roble Hall.
We entered the Vietnam war
by a joint Congressional resolu
tion empowering the President
to act, Prof. Horn, a noted au
thority on constitutional history,
told the writers.
"Massive indifference" rather
than "white racism" should have
been the conclusion of the Ker
ner Repot, Stanford historian
David Potter told the conference
Wednesday morning.
Prof. Potter, whose special
field is American history since
the Civil War, said the Presi
dent's Riot Commission report
was "irresponsible" in blaming
white racism so strongly as the
cause of civil strife. "Self-flag
ellation doesn't contribute any
thing," he said.

was "irresponsible" in blaming
white racism so strongly as the
cause of civil strife. "Self-flag
ellation doesn't contribute any
thing," he said.
Although the conference of
newspaper editors held this
week at Stanford was supposed
to be about the office itself and
not this year's candidates, key
note speaker Arthur Schlesinger
managed to get in his political
licks.
Schlesinger, author, historian,
former adviser to the late Pres.
John Kennedy and strong back
er of the late Sen. Robert Ken
nedy, said he would support
none of the present candidates
as he addressed 47 editors, edi
torial writers, and political edi
tors from across the country
Monday night in Roble Hall and
held a press conference Tues
day.
The other major speaker at
the conference, sponsored by the
Professional Journalism Fellow
ship Program, was Charles
"Chip" Bohlen, Deputy Under
secretary of State.
Other speakers included Time
White House correspondent
Il'iijh Seidy and New York
Times White House expert Max
lankel.
Bleak Selection
Schlesinger said the assassina
tion of Robert Kennedy left "a
rather bleak selection of candi
dates," with New York Gov.
Nelson Rockefeller the best of
those left.
Former Vice-President Rich
ard M. Nixon "would be a disas
ter no matter how you looked
at it,"he said. Schlesinger also
called him "a man totally empty
of principle."
"I've always believed one
thing the American people
would never do is elect Richard
Nixon president," he added.
The Democratic candidates
havu- their weak points too, he
said.
"For those who cared about

Kennedy's position on foreign
affairs, McCarthy is the logical
place to go, but for those who
cared about Kenndy's position
on domestic affairs, Humphrey
is the place to go."
In his address, Schlesinger
said he felt the United States
was entering an era of weak
presidents, as a reaction to the
methods of President Johnson.
He said this would be unfor
tunate, because although presi
dential power as now wielded is
too great over foreign affairs it
is not strong enough to deal
with the racial and urban crises
at home.
Schlesinger blamed Johnson
for the situation because he in
creased and enlarged America's
commitment in Vietnam on his
own.
He traced the development of
the presidency through the
years, noting that traditionally
weak presidents have followed
strong ones.
First Liberal
Sen. McCarthy, he said, is the
first liberal candidate in this
' ra. in oppose the concept of a
strong president. Rockefeller, he
claimed, would be the most like
ly to be a strong executive.
Bohlen, in his talk, also noted
the increase of presidential
power, citing that in 1967 there
were 267 presidential agree
ments made with other nations,
only ten of which were approved
by Congress.
He suggested that one method
of checking this strength would
be to have all federal officials---
the president as well as con
gressmen—stand for election
every four years.
This would end lame-d uc k
terms, Bohlen felt, and put for
eign policy on a party-line basis,
somewhat similar to the British
system.
The Vietnam war is constitu

one of five legal methods, Prof.

We entered the Vietnam war
by a joint Congressional resolu

told the writers.
"Massive indifference" rather
