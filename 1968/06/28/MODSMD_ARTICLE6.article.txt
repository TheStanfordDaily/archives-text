# 'Faculty Farm'
## 
### 
The University has an immense resource in its lands, and it
has used them well in attracting good new faculty to the cam
pus. Professors can get high loans with relatively low interest on
a long-term basis. The land itself is given free—except for a de
velopment fee—to prospective faculty home owners.
But in this time of social unrest in other communities, we be
lieve that the use of the lands should be modified.
Walking through the campus Pine Hill area, one grasps that
the standards already set by existing homes are so high that
somebody who is not willing or able to build at least a $40,000
home does not feel he can take advantage of one of Stanford's
most appealing fringe benefits for faculty.
Moreover, on this valuable land young professors get no chance
to live in relatively cheap apartments on a rental or ownership
basis.
More frightening in this time of radical unrest in our land, no
serious attempts seem to be made to reduce the economic, and
therefore racial, segregation of Stanford's faculty farm.
Although The Daily has found that the special segregation
that exists in the faculty housing developments may not reflect
the social sphere that faculty members move in, we believe the
Stanford lands should be utilized in the following ways:
• To make available land to underprivileged persons, the Uni
versity should let a number of non-University people from lower
income brackets rent in University-built apartment buildings in
the faculty housing area.
• Other persons—preferably minority group members —
should be allowed the free land to build in the faculty area,
though probably the University could not afford to extend the
financial help that is given to faculty and staff members.
• Also it seems reasonable that in the interests of fairness the
University should give professors who wish to build homes off
campus loans similar to those given on-campus home-builders.
University lands are an immense resource. On them could be
built model integrated communities that can take advantage of
the cultural resources of the University. We hope that Stanford
will move in that direction.
