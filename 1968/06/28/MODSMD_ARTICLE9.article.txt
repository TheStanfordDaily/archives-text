# A 						Conspiracy Of One
## Death In Chaos 
### Dan Snell 
Last week Ernie Milburn died.
A junior at Stanford, he was In
my high school graduating class,
and we strlved together in the
petty problems of high school
student government.
For me, his death is not eas
ily ignored, and the chaos he
leaves behind is not easily dis
counted as a manifestation of
the temper of the times. His
<leath was pure chaos, just as
those others were, those deaths
•of men more likely to be re
membered as magnificent.
Ernie died climbing a moun
tain ; he plunged 1000 feet some
where in Yosemite and was not
the same when he came to rest.
We sometimes had talked

about the absurd essence of the
world, the way it didn't make
sense and therefore could free
ly be climbed in and played with.
And in his quiet rationalism, in
his piecing together of words—
those human things he could
control—we tried to understand
the essence of education.
He said it was striving. And
striving was beauty. I coun
tered him and said that that
might temporarily be beautiful,
but what was of lasting beauty
was to pause, to pause and look
at the world and see how strange
it was and you were. And to ac
cept it all.
I haven't managed to carry
out my theory yet, of course; I

haven't managed to pause con*
pletely. I'm still sitting here' in
my little room striving to make
someone understand how beauti
ful was this lanky young man,
this scholar who ignored Gen
eral Studies requirements.
His dying so pointlessly, but
in the pursuit of beauty, has
made me understand that King
and Kennedy too are dead in
the pursuit of order, of beauty,
dead striving for something that
seemed better.
The Mesopotamians, those
morbid antique people, had a
myth they recited at their new
year's festival in which the god
Marduk fought and defeated a
goddess named Chaos. And then
Marduk formed the body of the
dead goddess into earth, sea, and
rivers so important to early civ
ilization.
Each year the epic was re
cited, and of course each year
Marduk won. In the uncertain
Babylonian world full of violent
barbarian invasions, it was
• -.ary to reassert the possibil
ity of order.
It's unfortunate, but American
-ociety has no such myth that
I er.n recite now. The election
of the next President is beset
with possibilities for chaos, and
the beautiful things my young
I'riend might have done are
n -rest oblivion.
1 am not sure Ernie reached
mountain-top he was aiming
fo \ King said he had, and Ken
nedy probably hadn't. But I have
come to accept that the striving
s a thing of beauty.
In our world Marduk does not
iy- conquer. But Ernie's
passing has convinced me, irra
tionally or not, that it is essen
tial to try to conquer chaos—
v hether it be a mountain or the
amazingly complex problems of
this chaotic age.

the same when he came to rest.
We sometimes had talked

about the absurd essence of the
world, the way it didn't make
sense and therefore could free
ly be climbed in and played with.
And in his quiet rationalism, in
his piecing together of words—
those human things he could
control—we tried to understand
the essence of education.
He said it was striving. And
striving was beauty. I coun
tered him and said that that
might temporarily be beautiful,
but what was of lasting beauty
was to pause, to pause and look
at the world and see how strange
it was and you were. And to ac
cept it all.
I haven't managed to carry
out my theory yet, of course; I

haven't managed to pause con*
pletely. I'm still sitting here' in
my little room striving to make
someone understand how beauti
ful was this lanky young man,
this scholar who ignored Gen
eral Studies requirements.
His dying so pointlessly, but
in the pursuit of beauty, has
made me understand that King
and Kennedy too are dead in
the pursuit of order, of beauty,
dead striving for something that
seemed better.
The Mesopotamians, those
morbid antique people, had a
myth they recited at their new
year's festival in which the god
Marduk fought and defeated a
goddess named Chaos. And then
Marduk formed the body of the
dead goddess into earth, sea, and
rivers so important to early civ
ilization.
Each year the epic was re
cited, and of course each year
Marduk won. In the uncertain
Babylonian world full of violent
barbarian invasions, it was
• -.ary to reassert the possibil
ity of order.
It's unfortunate, but American
-ociety has no such myth that
I er.n recite now. The election
of the next President is beset
with possibilities for chaos, and
the beautiful things my young
I'riend might have done are
n -rest oblivion.
1 am not sure Ernie reached
mountain-top he was aiming
fo \ King said he had, and Ken
nedy probably hadn't. But I have
come to accept that the striving
s a thing of beauty.
In our world Marduk does not
iy- conquer. But Ernie's
passing has convinced me, irra
tionally or not, that it is essen
tial to try to conquer chaos—
v hether it be a mountain or the
amazingly complex problems of
this chaotic age.
Last week Ernie Milburn died.
A junior at Stanford, he was In
my high school graduating class,
and we strlved together in the
petty problems of high school
student government.
For me, his death is not eas
ily ignored, and the chaos he
leaves behind is not easily dis
counted as a manifestation of
the temper of the times. His
<leath was pure chaos, just as
those others were, those deaths
•of men more likely to be re
membered as magnificent.
Ernie died climbing a moun
tain ; he plunged 1000 feet some
where in Yosemite and was not
the same when he came to rest.
