### 
The man who developed the
Mustang is coming to Stanford.
Arjay Miller, until last February
president of Ford Motor Company, has
been appointed dean of the Graduate
School of Business. Miller, 52, will
assume the position July 1, 1969. He
currently serves as vice-chairman of the
board of directors of Ford.

Miller has been credited by many
for the development of the Mustang
automobile. In reply, he states that the
' car's development was simply a re
> sponse to a clear desire expressed by
' the consumer public.
I His selection was announced by
' President Sterling alter a nine-month
' search by the Business School faculty
to find a successor to Dean Ernest

Ar buckle, who will become board
chairman of Wells Fargo Bank.
In announcing Miller's appointment
Sterling said, "I am delighted and grati
fied that Mr. Miller has accepted Stan
ford's invitation to become Dean of
the Graduate School of Business. His
personal attributes and his active inter
est in higher education combined with
his record of public service and busi

ness achievements make his appoint
ment one of distinction and very high
promise."
Miller, besides his duties at Ford,
serves as board chairman of the Urban
Institute, a government-financed re
search institute for the study of all as
pects of urban problems. He also serves
on the visiting committees of both the
UCLA and Harvard business schools.
A graduate of UCLA in business
administration, Miller was one of the
"whiz kids" who entered Ford after
World War II and applied systems anal
ysis techniques to managerial prob
lems. Former Secretary of Defense
McNamara was another of the "whiz
kids." McNamara resigned as president
of Ford in 1960 to become secretary
of defense.
Miller served as president of Ford
from 1963 until February of this year
when General Motors Executive Vice-
President Semon Knudsen went to
Ford in a surprise move.
His responsibilities at Ford were
primarily in the financial field. Miller
did graduate work in business and
economics at Berkeley, completing all
the work for his Ph.D. except the dis
sertation.

At hord Miller served as assistant
treasurer, vice-president, controller,
president and, most recently, vice
chairman of the board of directors. He
also serves on the boards of Philco Cor
poration and the American Road Insur
ance Company.

He was an economist for the
Federal Reserve Board in San
Francisco in 1941-43. He then served
three years with the U.S. Air Force,
rising from private to captain.
It was in the air force that Miller
met McNamara and in 1946 the two of
them, along with eight other air force

officers, moved en masse into Ford.
Only about thirty years old at the
time, the ten soon earned their "whiz
kid" nickname.
While best known for his emphasis
on systems analysis, Miller acknowl
edges it is only a tool, saying, "Tech
nical devices, whether they be ma-
I chines or mathematical models, are
only a link in the chain of individual
and social action."
Miller goes on to say that systems
analysis is needed to obtain answers to
complex questions in an increasingly
complex world.
While a graduate student at
Berkeley, Miller also served as a teach
ing assistant and co-authored "An
Economic and Industrial Survey of the
Los Angeles and San Diego Areas"
with Arthur Coons, now emeritus pres
ident of Occidental College.
Miller is married and has two child
ren. He plans to visit Stanford several |

times during the coming year before
his appointment becomes effective.

continue to serve as acting dean for the
academic year 1968-69, as previously
announced.

complex questions in an increasingly
complex world.
