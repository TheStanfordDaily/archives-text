# Bay Fill Project: Professors Assess Proposal's Problems
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
The proposal to fill part of San
Francisco Bay to accomodate more
people and more industry has aroused
a loud controversy throughout the Bay
area.
No doubt the plan would bring
more people and more money to the
area, but with those things would come
more problems. The difficulties fall in
three main areas: those affecting
ecology, geology, and the effects of
urban sprawl.
Filling the Bay would seriously hurt
the existing wildlife, according to
Donald Kennedy, head of the biologi
cal sciences department.
"When you fill an area like that you
create an entirely new shoreline," he
says. "Bays, especially enclosed bays
like San Francisco's, are rare on any
coast.
"To the extent they can be left un
disturbed, they present unique breed
ing habitats and breeding areas for a
large variety of water fowl and aquatic
organisms that depend on a fairly un
disturbed Bay habitat."
Two things are done by filling the
Bay. First, such action cuts down "on
the amount of shallow Bay land avail
able simply by encroaching and filling
it," Kennedy says. "Moreover the new
shore that is created is very likely to be
populated and less natural."

While wildlife may have their prob
lems, so will people who live on man
made land. "There is a question as to
how stable buildings are when con
structed on top of a bowl of jello,"
Ray Linsley, professor of hydraulic
and civil engineering, says.
Richard H. Jahns, dean of the
School of Earth Sciences, concurs.
"There is reason to expect that any
ordinary Bay fill will react strongly to
the normal ground motion in a strong
earthquake," he asserts.
"What this means in practical
terms," Jahns continues, "is that any
structure on it is going to experience
severe shaking. Much of the land on
the shoreline adjacent to Bay fill is also
going to experience shaking because
it's loose ground." This is also true of
the Stanford campus, he says, which
lies on gravel.
He gives what he calls "a classic ex
ample" of this phenomenon, lower
Market Street in San Francisco during
the 1906 quake. This area is built
partly on natural alluvium and other
soft natural deposits, and partly on
man-made fill.
This area suffered greatly during
the disturbance, "whereas in contrast
the buildings on higher ground- not be
cause they were higher but because
they were on harder rock-were rela
tively undamaged," Jahns notes.
"This is a very impressive selectivity

in earthquake shaking damage," he
feels.
The upper part of the fill land, on
which structures are built, can be
firmed up, but there is no way of doing
this to the several hundred feet of
earth beneath. "Much of the damage is
a function of the land built on," Jahns
adds.
Despite these problems, the dean
feels that modern construction is more
