# Bay Fill Project: Professors Assess Proposal's Problems
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
The proposal to fill part of San
Francisco Bay to accomodate more
people and more industry has aroused
a loud controversy throughout the Bay
area.
No doubt the plan would bring
more people and more money to the
area, but with those things would come
more problems. The difficulties fall in
three main areas: those affecting
ecology, geology, and the effects of
urban sprawl.
Filling the Bay would seriously hurt
the existing wildlife, according to
Donald Kennedy, head of the biologi
cal sciences department.
"When you fill an area like that you
create an entirely new shoreline," he
says. "Bays, especially enclosed bays
like San Francisco's, are rare on any
coast.
"To the extent they can be left un
disturbed, they present unique breed
ing habitats and breeding areas for a
large variety of water fowl and aquatic
organisms that depend on a fairly un
disturbed Bay habitat."
Two things are done by filling the
Bay. First, such action cuts down "on
the amount of shallow Bay land avail
able simply by encroaching and filling
it," Kennedy says. "Moreover the new
shore that is created is very likely to be
populated and less natural."

While wildlife may have their prob
lems, so will people who live on man
made land. "There is a question as to
how stable buildings are when con
structed on top of a bowl of jello,"
Ray Linsley, professor of hydraulic
and civil engineering, says.
Richard H. Jahns, dean of the
School of Earth Sciences, concurs.
"There is reason to expect that any
ordinary Bay fill will react strongly to
the normal ground motion in a strong
earthquake," he asserts.
"What this means in practical
terms," Jahns continues, "is that any
structure on it is going to experience
severe shaking. Much of the land on
the shoreline adjacent to Bay fill is also
going to experience shaking because
it's loose ground." This is also true of
the Stanford campus, he says, which
lies on gravel.
He gives what he calls "a classic ex
ample" of this phenomenon, lower
Market Street in San Francisco during
the 1906 quake. This area is built
partly on natural alluvium and other
soft natural deposits, and partly on
man-made fill.
This area suffered greatly during
the disturbance, "whereas in contrast
the buildings on higher ground- not be
cause they were higher but because
they were on harder rock-were rela
tively undamaged," Jahns notes.
"This is a very impressive selectivity

in earthquake shaking damage," he
feels.
The upper part of the fill land, on
which structures are built, can be
firmed up, but there is no way of doing
this to the several hundred feet of
earth beneath. "Much of the damage is
a function of the land built on," Jahns
adds.
Despite these problems, the dean
feels that modern construction is more
than adequate to withstand most
quakes.
"There just isn't any much safer
kind of construction than the typical
modern ranch-style frame house," he

says."The contemporary styles of resi
t dential construction are a lot safer in
trinsically than the adobe construction
of mission days, or the sandstone con
struction used in the building of the
original Inner Quad.

"Basically, the strongest element in
the context of a frame structure is that
everything is tied together and it can
undergo extreme distortion without
failing."
The~7inal major problem is in over
crowding of the Bay area. According to
Dudley Kirk, professor of demography
in the Food Research Institute, the
Bayshore Freeway is not equipped to
handle new large loads, and "complete
ly new types of transportation" would
be needed.
The Bayshore is overloaded now,"

he says, and with thousands upon
thousands of new residents the situa
tion would become "unimaginable."
Kirk also feels filling in the Bay
would have an adverse affect on the
local climate. "The Bay brings in fog
and cooler air, and probably keeps the
whole area cooler in summer." Slicing
out a part of it would lessen the Bay's
capability of producing this desirable
effect.
Esthetically, "the Bay is something

we like to look at. But it's much more
than that. The Bay as it's often put is
the greatest resource of the area. Some
of this would obviously be destroyed if
it were filled."
Kirk decries the booming un
planned growth of the area. "We are
experiencing all kinds of effects of a
not very well planned rapidly growing
metropolitan area-crowding of all
kinds, unattractive strips such as El
Camino," he says. "This will be accent
uated by having more people strung
along the Bay.
"You may say this might happen
anyhow-pcople are attracted to this
area because of our climate," he adds.
"But 1 don't think we should let it hap
pen as in the past, in a helter-skelter
fashion."
An overall regional plan is essential,
Kirk feels. "Here we are with a whok
lot of little communities and it seems a
shame to have a beautiful thing like the
Bay picked off piece by piece by pri
vate and community interests unless
there is a master plan for the entire
Bay region," he says.
"If we had a master plan we could
prevent overcrowding by zoning," the
demographer asserts. But zoning is now
in the hands of the local governments,
"which are interested only in their own
tax bases."
Julius Margolis, professor of
engineering-economic systems, dis
agrees with part of Kirk's thesis.
Margolis fells that the number of
people added to the Bay area by the
plan would not be much greater than
the normal yearly increase.
Tens of thousands would be only
normal, he says, and even hundreds of
thousands would not be that great an
increase "when you consider the time
range" over which they would move in
to the area.
Such a plan "won't increase the
population-it will just redistribute it."
But many people oppose filling the
Bay, and the plan will have rough going
ahead.

earthquake," he asserts.
"What this means in practical
terms," Jahns continues, "is that any
structure on it is going to experience
severe shaking. Much of the land on
the shoreline adjacent to Bay fill is also
going to experience shaking because
it's loose ground." This is also true of
the Stanford campus, he says, which
lies on gravel.
He gives what he calls "a classic ex
ample" of this phenomenon, lower
Market Street in San Francisco during
the 1906 quake. This area is built
partly on natural alluvium and other
soft natural deposits, and partly on
man-made fill.
This area suffered greatly during
the disturbance, "whereas in contrast
the buildings on higher ground- not be
cause they were higher but because
they were on harder rock-were rela
tively undamaged," Jahns notes.
"This is a very impressive selectivity

in earthquake shaking damage," he
feels.
The upper part of the fill land, on
which structures are built, can be
firmed up, but there is no way of doing
this to the several hundred feet of
earth beneath. "Much of the damage is
a function of the land built on," Jahns
adds.
Despite these problems, the dean
feels that modern construction is more
than adequate to withstand most
quakes.
"There just isn't any much safer
kind of construction than the typical
modern ranch-style frame house," he

says."The contemporary styles of resi
t dential construction are a lot safer in
trinsically than the adobe construction
of mission days, or the sandstone con
struction used in the building of the
original Inner Quad.

"Basically, the strongest element in
the context of a frame structure is that
everything is tied together and it can
undergo extreme distortion without
failing."
The~7inal major problem is in over
crowding of the Bay area. According to
Dudley Kirk, professor of demography
in the Food Research Institute, the
Bayshore Freeway is not equipped to
handle new large loads, and "complete
ly new types of transportation" would
be needed.
The Bayshore is overloaded now,"

he says, and with thousands upon
thousands of new residents the situa
tion would become "unimaginable."
Kirk also feels filling in the Bay
would have an adverse affect on the
local climate. "The Bay brings in fog
and cooler air, and probably keeps the
whole area cooler in summer." Slicing
out a part of it would lessen the Bay's
capability of producing this desirable
effect.
Esthetically, "the Bay is something

we like to look at. But it's much more
than that. The Bay as it's often put is
the greatest resource of the area. Some
of this would obviously be destroyed if
it were filled."
Kirk decries the booming un
planned growth of the area. "We are
experiencing all kinds of effects of a
not very well planned rapidly growing
metropolitan area-crowding of all
kinds, unattractive strips such as El
Camino," he says. "This will be accent
uated by having more people strung
along the Bay.
"You may say this might happen
anyhow-pcople are attracted to this
area because of our climate," he adds.
"But 1 don't think we should let it hap
pen as in the past, in a helter-skelter
fashion."
An overall regional plan is essential,
Kirk feels. "Here we are with a whok
lot of little communities and it seems a
shame to have a beautiful thing like the
Bay picked off piece by piece by pri
vate and community interests unless
there is a master plan for the entire
Bay region," he says.
"If we had a master plan we could
prevent overcrowding by zoning," the
demographer asserts. But zoning is now
in the hands of the local governments,
"which are interested only in their own
tax bases."
Julius Margolis, professor of
engineering-economic systems, dis
agrees with part of Kirk's thesis.
Margolis fells that the number of
people added to the Bay area by the
plan would not be much greater than
the normal yearly increase.
Tens of thousands would be only
normal, he says, and even hundreds of
thousands would not be that great an
increase "when you consider the time
range" over which they would move in
to the area.
Such a plan "won't increase the
population-it will just redistribute it."
But many people oppose filling the
Bay, and the plan will have rough going
ahead.
The proposal to fill part of San
Francisco Bay to accomodate more
people and more industry has aroused
a loud controversy throughout the Bay
area.
No doubt the plan would bring
more people and more money to the
area, but with those things would come
more problems. The difficulties fall in
three main areas: those affecting
ecology, geology, and the effects of
urban sprawl.
Filling the Bay would seriously hurt
the existing wildlife, according to
Donald Kennedy, head of the biologi
cal sciences department.
"When you fill an area like that you
create an entirely new shoreline," he
says. "Bays, especially enclosed bays
like San Francisco's, are rare on any
coast.
"To the extent they can be left un
disturbed, they present unique breed
ing habitats and breeding areas for a
large variety of water fowl and aquatic
organisms that depend on a fairly un
disturbed Bay habitat."
Two things are done by filling the
Bay. First, such action cuts down "on
the amount of shallow Bay land avail
able simply by encroaching and filling
it," Kennedy says. "Moreover the new
shore that is created is very likely to be
populated and less natural."

While wildlife may have their prob
lems, so will people who live on man
made land. "There is a question as to
how stable buildings are when con
structed on top of a bowl of jello,"
Ray Linsley, professor of hydraulic
and civil engineering, says.
Richard H. Jahns, dean of the
School of Earth Sciences, concurs.

the context of a frame structure is that
everything is tied together and it can
undergo extreme distortion without
failing."
The~7inal major problem is in over
crowding of the Bay area. According to
Dudley Kirk, professor of demography
in the Food Research Institute, the
Bayshore Freeway is not equipped to
handle new large loads, and "complete
ly new types of transportation" would
be needed.
The Bayshore is overloaded now,"

he says, and with thousands upon
thousands of new residents the situa
tion would become "unimaginable."
Kirk also feels filling in the Bay
would have an adverse affect on the
local climate. "The Bay brings in fog
and cooler air, and probably keeps the
whole area cooler in summer." Slicing
out a part of it would lessen the Bay's
capability of producing this desirable
effect.
Esthetically, "the Bay is something

we like to look at. But it's much more
than that. The Bay as it's often put is
the greatest resource of the area. Some
of this would obviously be destroyed if
it were filled."
Kirk decries the booming un
planned growth of the area. "We are
experiencing all kinds of effects of a
not very well planned rapidly growing
metropolitan area-crowding of all
kinds, unattractive strips such as El
Camino," he says. "This will be accent
uated by having more people strung
along the Bay.
"You may say this might happen
anyhow-pcople are attracted to this
area because of our climate," he adds.
"But 1 don't think we should let it hap
pen as in the past, in a helter-skelter
fashion."
An overall regional plan is essential,
Kirk feels. "Here we are with a whok
lot of little communities and it seems a
shame to have a beautiful thing like the
Bay picked off piece by piece by pri
vate and community interests unless
there is a master plan for the entire
Bay region," he says.
"If we had a master plan we could
prevent overcrowding by zoning," the
demographer asserts. But zoning is now
in the hands of the local governments,
"which are interested only in their own
tax bases."
Julius Margolis, professor of
engineering-economic systems, dis
agrees with part of Kirk's thesis.
Margolis fells that the number of
people added to the Bay area by the
plan would not be much greater than
the normal yearly increase.
Tens of thousands would be only
normal, he says, and even hundreds of
thousands would not be that great an
increase "when you consider the time
range" over which they would move in
to the area.
Such a plan "won't increase the
population-it will just redistribute it."
But many people oppose filling the
Bay, and the plan will have rough going
ahead.
The proposal to fill part of San
Francisco Bay to accomodate more
people and more industry has aroused
a loud controversy throughout the Bay
area.
No doubt the plan would bring
more people and more money to the
area, but with those things would come
more problems. The difficulties fall in
three main areas: those affecting
ecology, geology, and the effects of
urban sprawl.
Filling the Bay would seriously hurt
the existing wildlife, according to
Donald Kennedy, head of the biologi
cal sciences department.
"When you fill an area like that you
create an entirely new shoreline," he
says. "Bays, especially enclosed bays
like San Francisco's, are rare on any
coast.
"To the extent they can be left un
disturbed, they present unique breed
ing habitats and breeding areas for a
large variety of water fowl and aquatic
organisms that depend on a fairly un
disturbed Bay habitat."
Two things are done by filling the
Bay. First, such action cuts down "on
the amount of shallow Bay land avail
able simply by encroaching and filling
it," Kennedy says. "Moreover the new
shore that is created is very likely to be
populated and less natural."

While wildlife may have their prob
lems, so will people who live on man
made land. "There is a question as to
how stable buildings are when con
structed on top of a bowl of jello,"
Ray Linsley, professor of hydraulic
and civil engineering, says.
Richard H. Jahns, dean of the
School of Earth Sciences, concurs.
"There is reason to expect that any
ordinary Bay fill will react strongly to
the normal ground motion in a strong
earthquake," he asserts.
"What this means in practical
terms," Jahns continues, "is that any
structure on it is going to experience
severe shaking. Much of the land on
the shoreline adjacent to Bay fill is also
going to experience shaking because
it's loose ground." This is also true of
the Stanford campus, he says, which
lies on gravel.
He gives what he calls "a classic ex
ample" of this phenomenon, lower
Market Street in San Francisco during
the 1906 quake. This area is built
partly on natural alluvium and other
soft natural deposits, and partly on
man-made fill.
This area suffered greatly during
the disturbance, "whereas in contrast
the buildings on higher ground- not be
cause they were higher but because
they were on harder rock-were rela
tively undamaged," Jahns notes.
"This is a very impressive selectivity

in earthquake shaking damage," he
feels.
The upper part of the fill land, on
which structures are built, can be
firmed up, but there is no way of doing
this to the several hundred feet of
earth beneath. "Much of the damage is
a function of the land built on," Jahns
adds.
Despite these problems, the dean
feels that modern construction is more
than adequate to withstand most
quakes.
"There just isn't any much safer
kind of construction than the typical
modern ranch-style frame house," he

says."The contemporary styles of resi
t dential construction are a lot safer in
trinsically than the adobe construction
of mission days, or the sandstone con
struction used in the building of the
original Inner Quad.

"Basically, the strongest element in
the context of a frame structure is that
everything is tied together and it can
