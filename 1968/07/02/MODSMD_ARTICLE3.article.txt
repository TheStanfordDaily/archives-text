## Profs To Lecture Via TV 
### FRIEDRICH ABEL 
As the good-looking professor inter
rupts his lceture to show an illustration
from a book, the television operator in
the eontrol room zooms the overhead
TV camera to focus on the picture of
an earth dam in cross-section. Now the
instructor smiles and makes some
comments- immediately a second cam-'
era in the back of the room shoots a|
close-up of his face.
Forty miles away in a conference
room of a big industrial firm seven
part-time students follow on a TV

screen as the professor moves away
from his desk to work at the black
- boards behind him.
i Unfortunately, he makes a mistake
i in deriving a differential equation, and
1 one of the company students picks up
112 a talkback microphone to call the in
: structor's attention to the erTor over a
: loudspeaker in the class.
-I This dream of many educators, per
ij haps nightmare of some others, will
come true at Stanford beginning next
â–  Winter Quarter, says Donald Grace,
i associate dean of Stanford's School of
' Engineering and in charge of the in
structional television program here.
Next January at least 11, perhaps
40, engineering firms in the Bay Area
extending from San Francisco to San
Jose will be linked with the campus on
a new university-industry instructional
network, Grace said.
Employees of these firms working
part-time for a graduate degree in en
gineering will be able to attend classes
by walking from their offices or labora
| tories to a TV classroom on the same
floor, he said.
The four-channel system, in the
2500 megahertz microwave band, has
already been approved by the Federal
Communications Commission. Stan
ford had been the first university to
apply for a graduate educational broad
casting system with wide area coverage,
Grace said.
TV signals will be relayed to a
transmitter on Black Mountain above
the campus, and from then* to all par
ticipants. Power is limited to 10 watts
per channel.
Stanford telecasts cannot be rc
ccive4 on conventional TV sets.
Education-hungry TV pirates would
have to spend thousands of dollars in
special antennas and converters in

order to bring a lecture on the screen,
Grace said.
It was pressure from the business
community which motivated this
Utopian-appearing undertaking, he em
phasized.
There is an increasing interest of en
gineering firms in getting their employ
ees involved in some continuous updat
ing and upgrading educational
program, Grace said. The exceeding
complexity of technical operations can
only be met by an improvement in the
average level of engineering perfor
mance, he added.
Presently, out of 1,500 Stanford
engineering graduate students about
600 represent this philosophy of con
tinuing education: they are employed
by off-campus firms.
Commuting to campus and attend
ing regular classes these so-called Hon
ors Coop students face numerous dif
ficulties, Grace said. He cited "travel
time and expenses, parking time, and
the trauma of getting to and from a
company to a classroom at precise
hours."
But above all work responsibilities
usually extend the time necessary for a
master's degree over two or three
years, he said.
Television as an ideal solution to
these problems suggests itself, he
stated.
"We will continue to offer regular
day-time classes, with most of the stu
dents sitting in regular classrooms at
Stanford. Remote TV classrooms at
the company sites will give the in
dustry student a comparable exposure
and direct participation in the educa
tional process," Grace said.
Only for certain examinations, la
boratory classes and consulting their

advisers, TV students will still have to
come to the campus. Graded home
work, examinations, and hand-outs will
be handled by a regularly scheduled
pick-up and delivery service, Grace
said.
Four classrooms and one auditor
ium in the school of engineering will be
outfitted for televising classes soon, he
said.
Students will be seated at two-man
desks with built-in individual TV moni
tors. The two TV cameras in the class
will be controlled by a graduate stu
dent operator. "In this way the pro
fessor is free from any need to serve as
his own TV producer," Grace ex
plained.
Telecasts of regular Stanford
courses will begin at 8 a.m. and last till
noon, then continuing from 1 to 4
p.m. Between 4 and 5 p.m., channels
may be reserved for telecasting semi
nars, guest lectures, or special events.
Video taping will make repetitions
possible.
A two-way link to the University of
California at Berkeley will be utilized
for special lectures.

Installation cost for Stanford
studios and transmitters will be about
$625,000, Grace said. TV operating
costs are estimated at $100,000 a year.
All these expenses will be borne by the
companies, he added.
Compared to sending their students
to Stanford, industry breaks even
financially or saves money by partici
pating in the TV network, Grace
emphasized.
The far future could bring a tele
vision network with high data rate
computer and library access, he said.
All fields of knowledge could be tied
into the system.
"Public schools are moving quickly
into television teaching, and it would
be easy to give them access to special
programs," Grace said.
"It is even technically possible to
reach students directly at their
homes."

Finally, the advent of educational
TV satellites will make possible the in
terconnection of university TV net
works, Grace concluded.
