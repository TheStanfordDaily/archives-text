# Caught In The Middle
## To Quad And Back 
### Thomas C Dawson II 
Have you ever ridden in a white
Volkswagen across the Quad at 3:30 in
the morning? The Stanford DAILY
does. Every Tuesday and Friday morn
ing.
The sole motor vehicle in the Stan
ford DAILY circulation department
departs from the printers in Menlo
Park sometime after 2:30 the day of
publication. Staffing the noble chariot
are the editor and managing editor of

Volume 153 A.
first stop is the home of Mary
Madison in Menlo Park. Miss Madison
is a reporter for the San Francisco
Examiner and likes to get the first
copy of the DAILY. In as much as she
pays $1 per issue, the circulation de
partment is happy to oblige.
from Mary Madison's, Stanford's
Minutcmen proceed to the Medical
Center where two hundred copies are

deposited with the night recetionist
who always has a pleasant smile.
The Computation Center and Com
munications Department are next, with
a moment for a chat with the program
mers fighting the almighty 360. The
circulation department then embarks
on the hazardous transit down Serra
St., currently being ravaged by the Uni
versity master planner. Appropriate
numbers of" copies are left at the Biz
School, Law School, Math and History
Corners as well as I ncina Hall (to keep
News and Publications happy).
The dormitories are next on the list
lor Stanford's Minutemcn. Wilbur,
Stern, l-'lo Mo and Roble all get their
due. Finally, after getting up enough
nerve, the dynamic duo heads into the
Quad-White Plaza area, cleverly bypass
ing the roadblocks thrown up (possibly
to prevent delivery of the DAILY).
President Sterling's office is visited as
are the Post Office, Tresidder, and Ln
gineering Corner.
As we head back across the Quad,
we are intercepted by a Stanford po
liceman who smiles when he sees the
Volkswagen loaded with papers.
Physics tank and Geology Corner are
the last stops for the exhausted duo as
they stagger back to the DAILY office
only to find that the next deadline is at
hand and a columnist has failed to turn
in a column (which prompted this
column).
