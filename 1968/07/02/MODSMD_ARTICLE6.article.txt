The Poor Peoples' Campaign lias ended, its few remaining mem
bers thrown in jail and the poor no better off than when they
started. Look at the events of the last few weeks.
Perhaps the only national politician who commanded the re
spect (and votes) of the poor has been murdered. People who are in
need of representation far more than any others have lost their
strongest advocate.
The war in Vietnam continues unabated with the peace talks at
a standstill. Meanwhile Congress has passed the tax surcharge which
will, we hope, do something to control the fires of inflation that
hurt all, rich and poor. BUT, coupled with the surcharge is a spend
ing cut of $6 billion.
This cut will fall heaviest where the money is most needed. The
Department of Health, Education and Welfare and the Office of
Economic Opportunity which have responsibility for the ill-fated
war on poverty will be most affected. The Department of Defense
which spends more than $70 billion a year, mostly on Vietnam,
will escape virtually untouched.
To say that a realignment of priorities is needed is an under
statement. What is needed is a new approach to government, one
which de-emphasizes the international Pax Americana and stresses
an internal Pax Americana. Any nation that spends more than half
its budget on defense and less than fifteen per cent on welfare
while more than thirty million are officially classified as poor is
sick.
It is dangerous for Congress to ignore the cries of the poor. The
days are numbered in which the poor will continue to ask, soon
they will try to take what they feel is their due.
Why won't anyone listen?
