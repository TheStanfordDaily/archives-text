# Summer Festival
## 
### 
The Stanford Summer Festival is now in its fifth year on this
campus, and the stars from various fields who are gracing our stages
make it well worth watching.
It is unfortunate, from a student's point of view, that the costs
for these performances must frequently be rather high. But the
Festival is not here to make money. It is in fact a rare year in
which the Festival breaks even on its performances.
And even when it does manage to do that, the Festival remains
about $30,000 in debt because of administrative costs, according
to one source.
This week's scheduled concert with famed sitarist Ravi Shankar
as MC and performer, is an especially good example of the excel
lent things the Summer Festival is capable of.
But the free lectures and concerts scattered throughout summer
quarter also offer a broad-and one might say educationalâ€”series of
topics.
The variety and excellence of the Festival performers, drawn
from many parts of the world, from many parts of what is fast
becoming our international cultural heritage, warrants taking in the
events during this short, hot summer.
