be accepted for training. To be eligible,

the men must hold an MBA degree or a
graduate degree in industrial engineer
ing. The wives will be assigned work in
family development projects in the
barrios (poor sections) where the vol
unteers will live.
Training, which starts July 6, will
run for six weeks at Stanford, then
shift location to the Universidad del
Valle in Cali, Colombia's most
populous city, for the remaining six
weeks.
Training will include intensive
Spanish language study (full-time for
the first two weeks, and half-time
thereafter); adaptation of management
skills to Colombian small business;
business consulting, including practice
with Mexican-American small business
