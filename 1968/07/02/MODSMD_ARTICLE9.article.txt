# 'Bomb' Lab Studies Formation Of Rocks
## 
### FRIEDRICH ABEL 
Across the street from the student
publication building, next to the bike
shop, there is a building called the
"bomb lab" by some timid individuals.
It is the Earth Science Laboratory
that operates with "bombs" capable of
simulating the earth's interior.
Pressure vessels containing liquid
magma at 10,000 atmospheres and
1200 C allow researchers to study con-!
ditions in a magma chamber deep be- j
neath a volcanic chain, said John
Carman. He is a doctorate candidate in
charge of the lab this year for Prof.
I rank Tuttle, who is on leave.
Tuttle had moved the entire equip
ment of one of Pennsylvania State Uni
versity's high pressure labs to Stanford
in late 1965. Here it found housing in
the old Illumination Laboratory.
The central focus of the research
program is the systematic study of the
ways in which granite, basalt, and re
lated rocks form within the earth's

crust, Carman said. Magma moving out
wards from the inner parts of the earth
changes its phase equilibrium at every
depth increment depending on rock en
vironment, pressure and temperature,
he said.
Connected with these processes are
changes in the constitutions of the
magma and its adjacent rocks. Mineral
oxides and water play a superior role in
liquid rock metamorphism; adjacent
I rocks are primarily affected by changes
i in chemical composition and texture,
Carman explained.
How can the conditions 40 kilome
ters below the earth's surface be simu
lated?
The magma bomb contains a small
platinum capsule of about five milli
meters in diameter, tilled with a few
grams of spectrometric analysed rock,
perhaps also some natural or synthetic
oxides, the capsule is welded at both
ends and put into an externally-heated
pressure vessel.
Here it remains from minutes up to

months, depending, for example, 11
only the melting characteristics of car
bonates are tested, or the crystalliza
tion of artificial melts is investigated,
Carman said.
Studies of phase equilibria are also
long term projects, he said. Silicate liq
uids are stiff like cobbler's wax and it
takes a very long time until they estab
lish equilibrium with other rock com
ponents.
Which conditions crystallize basalt
to granite? Which are the melting rela-,
tions of the Cornwall granite from i
England? Which are the forming con-1
ditions for ore deposits?-these are -
some of the investigations now in I
progress at a lab where students handle
magma capsules as others play with
Cola bottles.

Across the street from the student
publication building, next to the bike
shop, there is a building called the
"bomb lab" by some timid individuals.
It is the Earth Science Laboratory
that operates with "bombs" capable of
simulating the earth's interior.
Pressure vessels containing liquid
magma at 10,000 atmospheres and
1200 C allow researchers to study con-!
ditions in a magma chamber deep be- j
neath a volcanic chain, said John
Carman. He is a doctorate candidate in
charge of the lab this year for Prof.
I rank Tuttle, who is on leave.
Tuttle had moved the entire equip
ment of one of Pennsylvania State Uni
versity's high pressure labs to Stanford
in late 1965. Here it found housing in
the old Illumination Laboratory.
The central focus of the research
program is the systematic study of the
ways in which granite, basalt, and re
lated rocks form within the earth's

crust, Carman said. Magma moving out
wards from the inner parts of the earth
changes its phase equilibrium at every
depth increment depending on rock en
vironment, pressure and temperature,
he said.
Connected with these processes are
changes in the constitutions of the
magma and its adjacent rocks. Mineral
oxides and water play a superior role in
liquid rock metamorphism; adjacent
I rocks are primarily affected by changes
i in chemical composition and texture,
Carman explained.
