OBITUARY:
The United States of America, lvz years old, one-time democracy, so-called land of the free, died August
' 28, 1968, of cynicism.
Death came on the first ballot in Chicago. Services will be held January 20, 1969, the Hon. Hubert H.
Humphrey presiding.
No. The nation won't "die" if Hubert Humphrey—or Richard Nixon—is elected president. But, it will lose something.
Eugene McCarthy calls that something conscience, a new politics that respects the new hopes of the people as they were
expressed in primaries across the nation.
It will lose something more—the participation and support of millions—black and white—who hoped for a moment
that politics was not a cynical game played by opportunists in the interest of self-aggrandizement.
We, the Stanford Committee for McCarthy, do not accept that verdict. We don't believe—at least not yet—that the
Democratic Convention will refuse the mandate of the people. That mandate has clearly expressed itself for change—
for a moral criterion for political decision-making, for a re-appraisal of America's motives and policies in Vietnam, for a re
ordering of human values and priorities to include the equal participation of Blacks and Mexican-Americans in our com
munities.
I We do not believe that the Democratic Convention will choose for an unprecedented loss of faith and disillusionment
in the name of a shibboleth called "party unity."
We do not believe that the convention is locked as long as the Johnson-Humphrey administration is rebuked with riots
in the streets and as long as it continues to support an unjust war in Vietnam.
We will not accept the verdict that politics are tatolly cynical until we have given our last effort for Eugene McCarthy
circulating petitions, writing our congressmen, meeting with delegates, if necessary marching on the streets of Chicago.
But we need your help. That is what grass roots politics is all about: all of us working, however we can. Here's how:

ALL-CAMPUS OPEN MEETING
