# Caught In The Middle
## Berkeley 
### Thomas C. Dawson II 
Last weekend's revolt in Berkeley
(which is still sputtering at press time)
brings to mind several observations
about demonstrations, Berkeley, Stan
ford and Oakland-style.
Saturday night's rally in Berkeley
attracted several thousand people.
October's Oakland Induction Center
demonstrations attracted a similar
number while Stanford's illustrious sit
in rarely had more than five hundred in
attendance. Even during the BSU-
Administration confrontation the top
crowd was around 1700.
There is something about the Stan
ford Way of Protest that is very pecu
liar. During the May sit-in campus po
lice were in the Old Union throughout.
At Berkeley the police (including the
campus police) were stoned (with
rocks). Nothing need be said about the
Oakland police. Here the sit-inner;
/oted to clear the building. They kept
the Old Union tidy all 57 hours. They
offered the campus police peanut but
ter and jelly sandwiches. Associate

Dean of Students Bill Wyman debated
with the students in the Old Union.
Millionaire-trustee David Packard
came to the Old Union, spoke and was
well-received by all. Everyone had a
generally delightful time.
Not so in Berkeley. The Mayor was
spat upon. Police had Molotov Cock
tails thrown at them. They threw tear
gas and clubbed students. Banks and
ather businesses (including an antique
.hop) had their windows broken in. A
strict curfew was imposed.
The Oakland police in their
moment of glory clubbed and gassed
students and press indiscriminately.
Members of the establishment press
3ven went so far as to file suit against
he Oakland police.
What is the difference between the
incidents?
At first glance the issues in Berke
ley seem trivial. They want one block
3f Telegraph Ave. blocked off for ral
lies and demonstrations. At Stanford

the issue was over the student judicial
system and the idea of paternalism and
in loco parentis. Oakland was over an
iniquitous draft system.
At one point during last weekend's
conflict two demonstrators stood atop
a wooden barricade arguing over
whether to tear the barrier down, pre
sumably to aid retreat. In the midst of
a crowd of several hundred they argued
for ten minutes over the barricade's
"symbolic value," etc. Finally one
shouted to the other, "We're not com
municating."
The issues in Oakland were clear,
even though nearly impossible to re
solve. The police were defending a
system committed to universal military
conscription. The students opposed the
very conccpt of conscription.
Possibly communication in such an
instance is impossible, but 1 hope not.
Communication was, and hopefully
still is, possible in Berkeley. Unfortu
nately neither side approached the situ
ation with any flexibility. On the one
hand the city government decided to
make an issue over whether one block
would remain open to traffic on Friday
The students, for their part, made
an issue over "the right of assembly."
They seemed to say that if they were
not given that corner that night, they
would take it and keep it. The later
vandalism and rock throwing is hardly
excusable.

The city fathers had offered the
demonstrators a parking lot for their
use (presumably not the one where the
300 police were waiting). It seems to
me that would have been a good idea,
but if not, surely something else could
have been done. There was just no
need for the tear uas and clubbing.
Contrast all this with the "Stanford
Way."
; The Committee of Fifteen kept
I meeting in spite of unrest, hammering
out a new judicial system. The demon
strators themselves voted to leave the
Old Union after receiving faculty sup
port. The Administration accepted
though not exactly enthusiastically
the faculty resolution.
This is not to say there will not be
further student-administration con
flicts at Stanford. Most certainly there
will be, but at least the lines of com
munication are still open.
