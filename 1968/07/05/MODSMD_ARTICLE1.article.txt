# Caught In The Middle
## Berkeley 
### Thomas C. Dawson II 
Last weekend's revolt in Berkeley
(which is still sputtering at press time)
brings to mind several observations
about demonstrations, Berkeley, Stan
ford and Oakland-style.
Saturday night's rally in Berkeley
attracted several thousand people.
October's Oakland Induction Center
demonstrations attracted a similar
number while Stanford's illustrious sit
in rarely had more than five hundred in
attendance. Even during the BSU-
Administration confrontation the top
crowd was around 1700.
There is something about the Stan
ford Way of Protest that is very pecu

At Berkeley the police (including the
campus police) were stoned (with
rocks). Nothing need be said about the
Oakland police. Here the sit-inner;

the Old Union tidy all 57 hours. They
offered the campus police peanut but

Dean of Students Bill Wyman debated
with the students in the Old Union.
Millionaire-trustee David Packard
came to the Old Union, spoke and was
well-received by all. Everyone had a
generally delightful time.
Not so in Berkeley. The Mayor was
spat upon. Police had Molotov Cock
tails thrown at them. They threw tear
gas and clubbed students. Banks and
ather businesses (including an antique
.hop) had their windows broken in. A
strict curfew was imposed.
The Oakland police in their
moment of glory clubbed and gassed
students and press indiscriminately.
Members of the establishment press
3ven went so far as to file suit against
he Oakland police.
What is the difference between the
incidents?
At first glance the issues in Berke
ley seem trivial. They want one block
3f Telegraph Ave. blocked off for ral
lies and demonstrations. At Stanford
