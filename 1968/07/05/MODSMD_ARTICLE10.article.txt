# Rights Loss Causes Student Riots
## 
### 
Virtually every student uprising
during the last four years has been
caused because an administrator denied
students' procedural rights, President
Lewis B. Mayhew of the American As-
z:

sociation for Higher Education told the
opening meeting of the association in
Dallas Monday.
Mayhew, professor of education at
Stanford University, said:
"At some point, some college offi
cial made the institution vulnerable
through denying generally recognized
procedural rights. Behind every suc
cessful student outbreak stands some

administrator who exercised discretior
without legitimacy."
Properly structured grievance pro
cedures and procedural rights could
have kept grievances within legitimate
bounds, he told the 500 professors and
administrators attending the general
session.
"The technique of direct adminis
trative handling of disciplinary matters

has lost its legitimacy in the eyes of
students and of many faculty."
"As a general rule, no administrator
should have the right to assess guilt or
to assign punishment, nor should he
have the right to make administrative
rulings without the option of a review
both of policy and specific substance.
"The campus judicial body should
be elected from faculty, students and
administration, but officers charged

with (regulating) conduct should be
barred from membership and even
presence during deliberations."
