# Shankar, Indians To Play In Festival
## 
### 
New, though ancient, music and an
array of exotic string and percussion
instruments will be introduced to the
Stanford Summer Festival today and
tomorrow in concerts by Ravi
Shankar's "Festival from India."
Shankar, whose mystical, impro
visational sitar playing has inspired new
trends in rock music and jazz, is begin
ning a nationwide tour with 22 mu
sicians who will present solo and duet
performances of the music of both
North and South India.
The Stanford Festival concerts will
begin at 8 p.m. in Frost Amphitheater.
They are the only Northern California

appearances of "Festival from India."
Ducts by Shankar on the sitar and
Ali Akbar Khan on the sarod will pro
vide a climactic highlight of each even
ing's program. The ragas played by the
two will be different each night and be
marked by the improvisation which
distinguishes Indian music. The sitar is
a 19-stringed instrument, the sarod, an
Indian lute. Rhythm for the duets will
be provided on the tabla. North Indian
drums, by Alia Rakha. Rakha also will
accompany Shankar in a sitar solo each
night.
Music for the concerts will be en
tirely different. Three musicians will
play the shehnai, a haunting wind in
strument, outside the amphitheater be
fore the concerts.
The programs will include singing
of Vedic hymns by Jitendra Abhisheki,
a flute solo by N. Ramani, songs oy
Lakshmi Shankar, solos by Ravi
Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan, a santoor
(mallet-struck string instrument) solo
by Shivkumar Sharma, a percussion en
semble, a veena (ancient string instru
ment) solo by V. Doraiswamy Iyengar,
and the Shankar-Khan duet.
The vocalists and musicians usually
are accompanied by drums, either the
tabla or the South Indian inridangam
and kanjira.
Shankar has collected some of the
finest musicians of India for his tour.
This is essential, because the high im
provisational content of Indian music
depends on mastery of the instrument
so it can project the spiritual-creative
I intent of the artist.
