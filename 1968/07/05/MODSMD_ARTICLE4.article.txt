# Research On Lasers Leads To Inventions

### FRIEDRICH ABEL 
The picture on a Stanford Univer
sity office door shows several light
beams blasting missiles from a gloomy
sky. THE INCREDIBLE LASER, the
drawing is titled. And a subhead reads:
"For credible lasers see inside."
Inside a number of Stanford's lab
oratories in the departments of physics
and electrical engineering research is
going on for the further development
of one of modern physics' most ex
iting discoveries.
Lasers, light sources of enormous
intensity, celebrate their tenth birth
day this year. In 1958 Professor Arthur
Schawlow, now executive head of
Stanford's physics department, and C.
H. Townes invented the laser in its
principle form.
The history of the laser's develop
ment sounds like another story of man
taming one of nature's phenomenons.
Ordinary light radiates from the sun
or an electric light bulb in wild dis
order, "wasting" its energy by flying
off in widely diverging directions.
It can hardly be expected that
homo sapiens would tolerate such
chaos. First he makes more light waves
being emitted from a light source.
Then he forces the waves to move in
only one direction and amplifies them
to such an energy level that an intense.

sharply directed beam of light is pro
duced.
It is as if the Niagara Falls were
squirted through a water pistol in one
brief moment. The laser beam is a
bunch of waves all exactly alike and in
step with each other, moving in one
direction-a wave stream that remains
compact long enough to reach the
moon and be reflected back to the
earth.
It is a light beam that could carry a
hundred million television programs
simultaneously-it could carry as much
information as all the radio communi
cation channels now in existence.
It can detect art frauds, remove
tattoos, cure eye damages, and serve as
a "light knife" for surgery.
\ picture of a man smoking a pipe
eight miles away was made during
night-time. Three-dimensional photo
graphs and films can be produced
perhaps laser will bring three
dimensional television in future
decades.
Other possible applications are: de
tection of damages on satellites, faster
transmission of pictures from outer
space, a new tool for intelligence agen
cies handling secret photographs, and
cheaper data processing.
Some lasers can deliver a short
