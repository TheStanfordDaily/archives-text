# Research On Lasers Leads To Inventions

### FRIEDRICH ABEL 
The picture on a Stanford Univer
sity office door shows several light
beams blasting missiles from a gloomy
sky. THE INCREDIBLE LASER, the
drawing is titled. And a subhead reads:
"For credible lasers see inside."
Inside a number of Stanford's lab
oratories in the departments of physics
and electrical engineering research is
going on for the further development
of one of modern physics' most ex
iting discoveries.
Lasers, light sources of enormous
intensity, celebrate their tenth birth
day this year. In 1958 Professor Arthur
Schawlow, now executive head of
Stanford's physics department, and C.
H. Townes invented the laser in its
principle form.
The history of the laser's develop
ment sounds like another story of man
taming one of nature's phenomenons.
Ordinary light radiates from the sun
or an electric light bulb in wild dis
order, "wasting" its energy by flying
off in widely diverging directions.
It can hardly be expected that
homo sapiens would tolerate such
chaos. First he makes more light waves
being emitted from a light source.
Then he forces the waves to move in
only one direction and amplifies them
to such an energy level that an intense.

sharply directed beam of light is pro
duced.
It is as if the Niagara Falls were
squirted through a water pistol in one
brief moment. The laser beam is a
bunch of waves all exactly alike and in
step with each other, moving in one
direction-a wave stream that remains
compact long enough to reach the
moon and be reflected back to the
earth.
It is a light beam that could carry a
hundred million television programs
simultaneously-it could carry as much
information as all the radio communi
cation channels now in existence.
It can detect art frauds, remove
tattoos, cure eye damages, and serve as
a "light knife" for surgery.
\ picture of a man smoking a pipe
eight miles away was made during
night-time. Three-dimensional photo
graphs and films can be produced
perhaps laser will bring three
dimensional television in future
decades.
Other possible applications are: de
tection of damages on satellites, faster
transmission of pictures from outer
space, a new tool for intelligence agen
cies handling secret photographs, and
cheaper data processing.
Some lasers can deliver a short
burst of light more than a billion times
brighter than the sun; local heat devel
opment can be fantastic. When focused
to a sharp point at very close range, it
can vaporize any substance on earth in
thousandths of a second, Schawlow '
said.
This effect could make small laser
pistols every secretary's favorite some
day, he said. I
Schawlow demonstrated this by
pointing a laser "ray gun" against a
typewritten character on a piece of
white paper. He pressed the firing trig
ger, and-ZAP-the letter disappeared
without affecting the underlying paper.
The carbon ink pigment vaporized so
rapidly that no harm was done to the
paper, Schawlow explained.
"Why not a laser eraser key on elec
tric typewriters?" Schawlow asked.
Small lasers arc available at prices ol
several hundred dollars now-if mass
produced they could become available
quite cheaply, he said.
A different kind of selective heating
is important in controlling chemical re
actions, Schawlow pointed out. This
control mechanism is based on the
principle that chemical reactions usual
ly go faster if the constituents are
heated.
"We are able to heat substances or
mixtures in a selective way, causing
some molecules to combine while leav
ing adjacent molecules unchanged. This
could have industrial applications," he
said.
Hundreds of companies in elec
tronics, optics, or space research are al
ready investigating the laser; most uni
versities have laser research projects on
their program.
The laser boom of the last 10 years I
is linked inseparably to military inter
ests. Much of university laser research
all over the country, including Stan
ford, is directly or indirectly sponsored
by the Defense Department.
For example, $30.6 million was
, spent on laser projects during 1965.
I Research included problems such as
battlefield range-finders or night-time
photographic reconnaissance.
The missiles-blasting "death ray"
laser (see picture of an Incredible
Laser) is unlikely to be built within the
foreseeable future. High power-long
distance lasers would require more
energy that could possibly be pro
duced. New laser types, however,
might change this prediction.
Nevertheless, no straight line can be
drawn between military and civil inter
ests. Because of its versatility new uses
jfor the laser are almost constantly
found.
Only recently a new discovery cli

maxed several years of laser research at
Stanford's microwave lab. Last May
11, a visible, continuously operating
laser-like light beam that was tunable
over a wide range, was generated for
tlie first time in history by electrical

engineering's Professor Stephen Harris
Tunable lasers could be designed to
analyze materials, especially in chem
istry, "as fast as getting copies out of a
Xerox machine," he said.

step with each other, moving in one
direction-a wave stream that remains
compact long enough to reach the
moon and be reflected back to the
earth.
It is a light beam that could carry a
hundred million television programs
simultaneously-it could carry as much
information as all the radio communi
cation channels now in existence.
It can detect art frauds, remove
tattoos, cure eye damages, and serve as
a "light knife" for surgery.

Some lasers can deliver a short
burst of light more than a billion times
brighter than the sun; local heat devel
opment can be fantastic. When focused
to a sharp point at very close range, it
can vaporize any substance on earth in
thousandths of a second, Schawlow '
said.
This effect could make small laser
pistols every secretary's favorite some

Schawlow demonstrated this by
pointing a laser "ray gun" against a
typewritten character on a piece of
white paper. He pressed the firing trig
ger, and-ZAP-the letter disappeared
without affecting the underlying paper.
The carbon ink pigment vaporized so
rapidly that no harm was done to the
paper, Schawlow explained.
"Why not a laser eraser key on elec
tric typewriters?" Schawlow asked.
Small lasers arc available at prices ol
several hundred dollars now-if mass
produced they could become available
quite cheaply, he said.
A different kind of selective heating
is important in controlling chemical re
actions, Schawlow pointed out. This
control mechanism is based on the
principle that chemical reactions usual
ly go faster if the constituents are
heated.
"We are able to heat substances or
mixtures in a selective way, causing
some molecules to combine while leav
ing adjacent molecules unchanged. This
could have industrial applications," he
said.
Hundreds of companies in elec
tronics, optics, or space research are al
ready investigating the laser; most uni
versities have laser research projects on
their program.
The laser boom of the last 10 years I
is linked inseparably to military inter
ests. Much of university laser research
all over the country, including Stan
ford, is directly or indirectly sponsored
by the Defense Department.
For example, $30.6 million was

I Research included problems such as
battlefield range-finders or night-time
photographic reconnaissance.
The missiles-blasting "death ray"
laser (see picture of an Incredible
Laser) is unlikely to be built within the
foreseeable future. High power-long
distance lasers would require more
energy that could possibly be pro
duced. New laser types, however,
might change this prediction.
Nevertheless, no straight line can be
drawn between military and civil inter

without affecting the underlying paper.
The carbon ink pigment vaporized so
rapidly that no harm was done to the
paper, Schawlow explained.
"Why not a laser eraser key on elec
tric typewriters?" Schawlow asked.
Small lasers arc available at prices ol
several hundred dollars now-if mass
produced they could become available
quite cheaply, he said.
A different kind of selective heating
is important in controlling chemical re
actions, Schawlow pointed out. This
control mechanism is based on the
principle that chemical reactions usual
ly go faster if the constituents are
heated.
"We are able to heat substances or
mixtures in a selective way, causing
some molecules to combine while leav
ing adjacent molecules unchanged. This
could have industrial applications," he
said.
Hundreds of companies in elec
tronics, optics, or space research are al
ready investigating the laser; most uni

their program.

The missiles-blasting "death ray"
laser (see picture of an Incredible
Laser) is unlikely to be built within the
foreseeable future. High power-long
distance lasers would require more
energy that could possibly be pro

might change this prediction.
Nevertheless, no straight line can be
drawn between military and civil inter
ests. Because of its versatility new uses
jfor the laser are almost constantly
found.
Only recently a new discovery cli

maxed several years of laser research at
Stanford's microwave lab. Last May
11, a visible, continuously operating
laser-like light beam that was tunable
over a wide range, was generated for
tlie first time in history by electrical

engineering's Professor Stephen Harris
Tunable lasers could be designed to
analyze materials, especially in chem
istry, "as fast as getting copies out of a
Xerox machine," he said.
The picture on a Stanford Univer
sity office door shows several light
beams blasting missiles from a gloomy
sky. THE INCREDIBLE LASER, the
drawing is titled. And a subhead reads:
"For credible lasers see inside."
Inside a number of Stanford's lab
oratories in the departments of physics
and electrical engineering research is
going on for the further development
of one of modern physics' most ex
iting discoveries.
Lasers, light sources of enormous
intensity, celebrate their tenth birth
day this year. In 1958 Professor Arthur
Schawlow, now executive head of
Stanford's physics department, and C.
H. Townes invented the laser in its
principle form.
The history of the laser's develop
ment sounds like another story of man
taming one of nature's phenomenons.
Ordinary light radiates from the sun
or an electric light bulb in wild dis
order, "wasting" its energy by flying
off in widely diverging directions.
It can hardly be expected that
homo sapiens would tolerate such
chaos. First he makes more light waves
being emitted from a light source.
Then he forces the waves to move in
only one direction and amplifies them
to such an energy level that an intense.

sharply directed beam of light is pro
duced.
It is as if the Niagara Falls were
squirted through a water pistol in one
brief moment. The laser beam is a
bunch of waves all exactly alike and in
step with each other, moving in one
direction-a wave stream that remains
compact long enough to reach the
moon and be reflected back to the
earth.
It is a light beam that could carry a
hundred million television programs
simultaneously-it could carry as much
information as all the radio communi
cation channels now in existence.
It can detect art frauds, remove
tattoos, cure eye damages, and serve as
a "light knife" for surgery.
\ picture of a man smoking a pipe
eight miles away was made during
night-time. Three-dimensional photo
graphs and films can be produced
perhaps laser will bring three
dimensional television in future
decades.
Other possible applications are: de
tection of damages on satellites, faster
transmission of pictures from outer
space, a new tool for intelligence agen
cies handling secret photographs, and
cheaper data processing.
Some lasers can deliver a short
burst of light more than a billion times
brighter than the sun; local heat devel
opment can be fantastic. When focused
to a sharp point at very close range, it
can vaporize any substance on earth in
thousandths of a second, Schawlow '
said.
This effect could make small laser
pistols every secretary's favorite some
day, he said. I
Schawlow demonstrated this by
pointing a laser "ray gun" against a
typewritten character on a piece of
white paper. He pressed the firing trig
ger, and-ZAP-the letter disappeared
without affecting the underlying paper.
The carbon ink pigment vaporized so
rapidly that no harm was done to the
paper, Schawlow explained.
