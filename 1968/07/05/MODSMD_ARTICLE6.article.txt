## Forget Your Guns 
### 
Since the assassination of Senator Ken
nedy, support for firearms control has come
from all comers of the country. San Francis
co has instituted a gun turn-in program, a
gun control bill for the entire state may be
near, the constabulary in a few cities have
stopped carrying weapons, and even our old,
stodgy Congress has reacted.
But not Stanford.
Stanford's pleasant patrolmen still con
tinue to wear their sideanns when they need
them less than almost any other police
force-public or private-in this country.
Why?
Stanford's police have no real use for

pistols in their day-to-day patrols. They keep
them only because of the tradition in this
country-the tradition that has led to the
deaths of John Kennedy, Medgar Evers,
Martin Luther King, and Robert Kennedy.
We believe it would be fitting for Chief
Gordon Davis to order his officers to stop
wearing sidearms.
And action at Stanford should not stop
here. Every member of the University com
munity should do all he can to see that the
strongest possible gun control laws are
passed as soon as possible.
Write your senator while you still have
one.
