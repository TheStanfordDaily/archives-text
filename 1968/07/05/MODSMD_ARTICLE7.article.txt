# America

### 
America this fourth of July was a place
of pitifully little hope.
The elections, fast swooping down upon
us, were bringing with them nothing but
whai the oitl order desired. The Republic,
the American, not only the French, seemed
committed to a course of ignoring its youth
and its downtrodden peoples.
Those downtrodden, having given their
struggle the clean old American try, seemed
ready now at last to give it some other kind
of try.
Some few could hold in their hearts a
new non-proliferation treaty on nuclear arms
as evidence that civilization was ever striding
forward.
And the dawns came, and they went.
The universe did not seem troubled that
America is troubled, that students were man

ning barricades just across the bay, or that a
pointless war was sapping the strength of
America and indoctrinating her young men
into a code of reactionary military dis
cipline.
The funny old men who signed what
Thomas Jefferson wrote 192 years ago
would not be strangers to the feeling of des
peration growing in their land. But the
vague, insane hope they had for the future,
and their acccptance of social or at least
political upheaval is most needed now.
