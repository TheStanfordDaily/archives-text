# A 						Conspiracy Of One
## Early Requirements 
### Dan Snell 
A university is an organic thing. A
thing that grows and develops, to be
sure. But sometimes a thing that re
gresses.
Nowadays Stanford students labor
under what is called a General Studies
requirement that makes them take sci
ence courses amounting to 17 units
and various selections of social science
and humanities courses.
Last year's approval of 20 inter
departmental majors and the long
overdue abolishment of the absurd ac
tivity requirement are signs that this
institution may be moving toward re
quirements that are a little more

liberal.
And word has it aJong the under
graduate grapevine that some of the re
quirements til at still stand will be eased
within the next few years.
But it is unlikely that the require
ments will jive with the philosophy put
forward by one campus revolutionary:
"Any pre-arranged course of study
is an affront to the mind of the real
student."
David Starr Jordan, Stanford's first
president, said that in 1885, soon after
he was appointed president of the Uni
versity of Indiana.
When the fiery young man of forty

was approached by practical-minded
Leland Stanford, Sr. to become presi
dent of the "college" Stanford was
thinking of founding out West, Jordan
said yes.
And the requirements in the new
institution? Pursuant to his beliefs, Jor
dan got the faculty to agree in
December of 1891, after the University
had been going three months, that
two-thirds of all undergraduate work
would be elective.
The other third would be an indi
vidually tailored program in a major
field worked out between the student
and a professor of .his own choosing.
The student took courses in the pro
fessor's field and in some minor field if
the professor thought that was a good
idea.
Today, though there is flexibility in
choosing what to take, the candidate
for a bachelor's is usually faced with
more than 60 units of General Studies
requirements as well as a major load
varying from about 25 to 80 units.
And the clincher was that to begin
with, all courses at Stanford were pass
fail, to use a modern term. Although at
first grades had been Excellent, Pass,
Fail and something vaguely like Incom
plete, Excellent was soon dropped.
But the forces of bureaucracy
hovered near and translated the word
grades into letter-grades and reinstated
the grade of A. By 1903 things were
whizzing along much as they do now,
except that everyone's deficiencies
were printed up in a little booklet dis
tributed to everyone at the end of the
year.
And that great former revolution
ary president Dr. Jordan was busy wri
ting a friend that the students did not
mind distribution of information on
academic standing. Indeed, he cooed, it
encouraged friendly student competi
tion.
Stanford is moving back where it
came from, and that is a healthy thing.
Almost as healthy as having stayed
there to begin with.

Fail and something vaguely like Incom
plete, Excellent was soon dropped.
But the forces of bureaucracy
hovered near and translated the word
grades into letter-grades and reinstated
the grade of A. By 1903 things were
whizzing along much as they do now,
except that everyone's deficiencies
were printed up in a little booklet dis
tributed to everyone at the end of the
year.
And that great former revolution

mind distribution of information on
academic standing. Indeed, he cooed, it

Stanford is moving back where it
came from, and that is a healthy thing.
Almost as healthy as having stayed
there to begin with.

A university is an organic thing. A
thing that grows and develops, to be
sure. But sometimes a thing that re
gresses.
Nowadays Stanford students labor
under what is called a General Studies
requirement that makes them take sci
ence courses amounting to 17 units
and various selections of social science
and humanities courses.
Last year's approval of 20 inter
departmental majors and the long
overdue abolishment of the absurd ac
tivity requirement are signs that this
institution may be moving toward re
quirements that are a little more

liberal.
And word has it aJong the under
graduate grapevine that some of the re
quirements til at still stand will be eased
within the next few years.
But it is unlikely that the require
ments will jive with the philosophy put
forward by one campus revolutionary:
"Any pre-arranged course of study
is an affront to the mind of the real
student."
David Starr Jordan, Stanford's first
president, said that in 1885, soon after
he was appointed president of the Uni
versity of Indiana.
When the fiery young man of forty

was approached by practical-minded
Leland Stanford, Sr. to become presi
dent of the "college" Stanford was
thinking of founding out West, Jordan
said yes.
And the requirements in the new
institution? Pursuant to his beliefs, Jor
dan got the faculty to agree in
December of 1891, after the University
had been going three months, that
two-thirds of all undergraduate work
would be elective.
The other third would be an indi
vidually tailored program in a major
field worked out between the student
and a professor of .his own choosing.
The student took courses in the pro
fessor's field and in some minor field if
the professor thought that was a good
idea.
Today, though there is flexibility in
choosing what to take, the candidate
for a bachelor's is usually faced with
more than 60 units of General Studies
requirements as well as a major load
varying from about 25 to 80 units.
And the clincher was that to begin
with, all courses at Stanford were pass
fail, to use a modern term. Although at
first grades had been Excellent, Pass,
Fail and something vaguely like Incom
plete, Excellent was soon dropped.
