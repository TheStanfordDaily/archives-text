PALOS ALTOS-The Palo Alto of Spanish Colonial days is seen above (left). Some authorities figure the ancient
landmark has but a few short decades of life remaining. On tile right are the six new Palos Altos planted some fifty
years ago in hopes of nurturing another stately tree to keep alive the grandeur of the old tree. (See story Friday)
