# Physicians, Engineers Cooperate

### FRIEDRICH ABEL 
Stanford's School of Medicine and
a number of technical science depart
ments here are running joint research
programs. Scientists in electrical, nu
clear and civil engineering, physics and

chemistry, and other groups, are offer
ing their know-how to solve the in
creasingly technical problems of mod
ern medicine.
One example of this cooperation is
a current project on the working

mechanisms of our brain and central
nervous system. The research is carried
out by neurology's Professor Arnold
Starr and electrical engineering's Ken
Wise, a graduate student.
We do not know much about the
way information is given from the ear
to the brain when we hear a sound,
Wise said. "There are so many unsolved
problems, such as: How do we feel?
How do we sense things?" he said. 11
we knew exactly how the central
nervous system works, medicine could
perhaps think of more effective ways
of treating epilepsy and some other
nervous diseases, he added.
To locate and measure electrical im
pulses travelling through nerve cells,
extremely small probes have to be de
signed for insertion into an animal's or
human's brain. Wise said. Probes are

thin "feelers" that penetrate the brain
without affecting the cell tissue.
l or example, probes inserted into a
cat's brain could measure the nerve
cells' reactions to the noise of a ticker,
he said. However, the nervous system's
impulses are so weak that conventional
probes cannot distinguish accurately
enough between a message from the
brain and unwanted signals originating
in the wiring system, he said. Usually
gold wires run from die probe to an
amplifier outside the brain creating this
noise, he added.
If the amplification system can be
placed in the probe's "spearhead" it
could be inserted directly into the
brain and eliminate disturbing noise,
because no gold wires from a micro
electrode to an amplifier would be
necessary, Wise explained.
Several problems still remain to be
solved to this end, he said.
First, it is extremely difficult to use
a micro- "spearhead" as a basis block
for transistors, resistors, and other cir
s cuit elements: the "head" is only
" about one eighth of an inch long. This
' space problem in working with micro
devices will probably be solved by
1 using a silicon basis into which electric
' circuit elements can be integrated, Wise
explained.

Second, it is necessary to design a
/ probe which can measure electric im
t pulses without changing or injuring the
nerve cells and their environment, he
said. Because in some cases the elec
' trode might remain in the brain as long
, as several days or weeks, nothing in
serted into the brain should cause toxi
cations by reacting with chemical com

pounds in the brain. This creates the
particular problem of selection of
proper materials for probe elements,
Wise emphasized.
ThiiU, for given types of nerve cells
different types of probes should be
come available. To measure impulses at
three or four different points at the
same time three or four electrodes
could be placed in an array on only
one basic "spearhead," Wise Â»aid.
