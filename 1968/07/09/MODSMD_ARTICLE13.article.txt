# $470,000 Biology Grant
## 
### 
A $470,000 grant from the l ord
Foundation will finance a new five
year training and research program in
the "biology of human populations" to
be directed by two Stanford profes
sors.
The Stanford grant was among
eight awards totaling nearly $4 million
for research on human environment
problems, the Foundation announced
here Sunday (JUNE 30). A $174,000
grant went to UC-Davis for examina

lion of the social costs of Calif ornia's
population growth.
Prof. Paul R. Ehrlich, population
biologist, and Prof. Jonathan L. Freed
nian, a social psychologist, will direct
the Stanford program. They will use
surveys, laboratory and field experi
ments to investigate the effects of
crowding upon humans.
The Stanford program also will in
clude research into the public's aware
ness and attitude toward problems of
environment and overcrowding which
arise from the population explosion.
The five-year plan calls for training
doctoral students in biology and
psychology to carry on this type of en
vironmental research, and provides
funds for seven graduate fellowships.
The objective is to train specialists to
deal more effectively with man as a
biological species.
