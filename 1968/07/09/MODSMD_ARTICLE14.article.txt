# Volcano May Change Research Ship's Plans
## 
### 
Research plans may have to be
changed somewhat for Stanford Uni
versity's research vessel, the 135-foot
schooner, Te Vega, because of recent
volcanic eruptions in the Galapagos
Islands.
Just back from the Galapagos, the
Te Vega has been in home port in Mon
terey tor two weeks undergoing minor
repairs and refitting for her nineteenth
expedition under National Science
Foundation sponsorship. She is sched
uled to sail for the islands again on Fri
day, June 28.
Since the ship's return, news has
come that Isla Isabels, one of the five
larger islands of the Galapagos group,
has been spouting hot lava.
Prof. Malvern Gilmartin of Stan
ford's Hopkins Marine Station, director
of the Te Vega program, said he does

not expect the eruptions will cause any
drastic change in plans, however. While
the eruptions may prevent inves
tigations in Isla Isabela, the other ma
jor islands should not be seriously af
fected. There are also more than a
dozen smaller islands in the group.
Three coeds are among the 11 grad
uate students in biology who have won
berths on Expedition 19. Dr. W. Jan
Newhouse of the University of Hawaii
will head a laculty of five planning to
study marine life in the vicinity of the
islands.
The ship will stop at Acapulco en
route to the Galapagos, and the expe
dition is scheduled to end Sept. 11 at
Guayaquil, Ecuador. A professional
captain and crew of 15 sail the steel
hulkd schooner, permitting research
and teaching to proceed full time.
