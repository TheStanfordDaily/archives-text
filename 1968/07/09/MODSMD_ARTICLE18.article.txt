# Ehrlich Book Asks Population Curbs
## 
### 
A paperback as hard-hitting as its
title, "The Population Bomb," has
been written by Stanford University
Prof. Paul R. Ehrlich and was pub
lished yesterday by the Sierra Club and
Ballantine Books of New York (224
pp., 5.95).
Population biologist Ehrlich takes
the ball from anti-pollution, conserva
tionist, and pro-birth control cohorts
for a power drive toward the goal he
says will win for all of them
population control.
"Too many cars, too many facto
ries, too much detergent, too much
pesticide, multiplying (jet) contrails,
inadequate sewage treatment plants,
too little water, too much carbon di
oxide-all can be traced easily to too
many people," he says.
Everyone agrees," he adds, "that
at least half of the people of the world

are undernourished (have too little Â«
lood) or malnourished (have serious
imbalances in their diet).
"There is not enough food today.
How much there will be tomorrow is
open to debate. It the optimists arc
correct, today's level of misery will be
perpetuated for perhaps two decades
into the future.
II the pessimists are correct, mas
sive (amines will occur soon, possibly
in the early 1970\, certainly by the
early 19X0\ So far most of the evi
dence seem> to be on the side of the
pessimists, and we should plan on the
assumption that they are correct."
Prot. I-hrlich documents his claims
that symptom treatments family plan
ning, increased food production, pres
ent birth control programs and other
measures have failed or are failing.
