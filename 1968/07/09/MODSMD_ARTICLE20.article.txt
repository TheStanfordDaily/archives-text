I'very I rid ay «nul S;ilnrd:iy night
lour teaihers stroll onto a liny stage
upstairs .it the I angenl (in New I an
ii I, or whatever) on t'niveisily
Avenue. I hey are the members ol the
Illegitimate I heater, a happy and re
laxetl group ol improvisalioiial ,n tors.
And they are truly an improvui

tional group two-thirds ol the mate
rial lliey perform is impromptu, sug
gested hy Ule audienee. I lie speelalors,
therefore, are an important part ol tin
show. Not only do they give the aetors
ideas, hnl lliey even go up and net
themselves.
I his is the idea ol Philip Sclinlt/,
direeloi ol the group, lie honors and
respeels his audienee in a way not
often I« >ui id in theater today. Instead
ol heing Incited as animals and hut Is
for jokes, S* hull/\ audienee is part ol
the show.
I lie material they perform is, like
the aetors, informal and gentle a soil
ol soil self I here are no diatribes and
no eaustie eommentaiA . |nst limin
portrayals ol wliatevei then mdierue
wants. I lii'y make then point without
assaulting oi shot king the speelalors.
Naturally, some ol then skits are
prepared. Skits are eitliei theii own
ideas or material that was suggested
some lime ago and built on sinee then
Hut most ol these repeats are asked loi
by the audienee (many ol whom aie
repeats, too). Having seen tliein onee,
lliey want more and more.

I hese regular items usually are
most entertaining, as is to he expected.
One might ask lor more ol these, hut
then the (healer is no longer improvisa
lional An idea is suggested, the actors
go to work, and when the scene has
gone ahoul as Car as il can go.anothei
member ol the company kills I lie
lights and then they're oil to another
idea.
All ol the lour Scluilt/, Kay bar
ren, |)e Marcus, and Shirley ( oates
are excellent at making something
Ironi nothing. In one scene, you may
have lie and Shirley as the past ami
incoming presidents ol a P I A, and in
the next Schult/ and Marrelt as flabby
client and inslructoi in a health spa.
I lie last scene every night is the
same, and it typifies the group's atti
tude Srliult/ goes around turning oil
the stage lights b\ swirls ol the hand
.iiul Ic.its o| prestidigitation. Hut he is
unable to gel the last one, no matter
what he does I hen Marred steps up
and <111ie11\ , softly, slowly blows out
the light.
Ills way is best.
