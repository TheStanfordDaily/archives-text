## Recall Reagan 
### 
Ronald Reagan has been
Governor of California for
some eighteen months, an
adequate time for him to
prove his worth.
In that time he has done
more to wreck the educa
tional system of the state
than anyone had thought
possible. The University of
California at Berkeley was
rated the most distinguished
university in the country by
an American Council for
Education survey published
in 1966. UCLA and San
Francisco State were also
highly rated centers of higher

education. The recent ap
pointment of the director of
Stanford's Hoover Institution
to the Board of Regents of
the University of California is
an example of our governor's
regressive educational phil
osophy.
But Reagan's short
comings are not confined to
the sphere of education. He
is an all-around failure. His
misunderstanding of the
problems of the poor-black,
brown, and white, has, in no
small way, led to heightening
of racial tensions in areas like
Richmond and Oakland.

His castration of the
Medi-Cal and state Mental
Health programs serves as a
further example of his de
plorable approach to the
problems of modern society.
Reagan's appeal seems to
be directed toward the white
middle-class suburbanite,
comfortable with his tele
vision sets and two-car gar
age. But Reagan cannot even
satisfy this maleable middle
class. His campaign pledge
not to raise taxes was re
markably short-lived.
The Stanford DAILY sup
ports the petition, currently
circulating, that calls for the
recall of Ronald Reagan. We
have seen his political ideol
ogy in action and like it even
less than we did in 1 966.
