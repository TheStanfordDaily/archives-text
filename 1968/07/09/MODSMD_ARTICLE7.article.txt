## Tales Of The Tube 
### Doug Taber 
Shocked by the tragic death of Sen
ator Kennedy, and under substantial
pressure from public and sponsors, the
television networks of America have
started a widely publicized effort to
cut all violence from their fare. We ap
plaud this effort to shelter our children
from the harsher realities of life, but
wonder what it might lead to in the
future.
The scene: a ramshackle Western
town, false fronts line a dusty main
street with hitching rails and lots of lo
cal color (most of it brown). Through
the swinging doors of the Last Chance
Saloon (last bar for half a mile, in that
direction) strides an awesome figure,
all in black, from the top of his dusty
black hat to the soles of his dusty
black boots.
The Marshall walks slowly to the

door.
"Is til is the way it's going to have
to be, Wylie?" he asks, but he knows it
is, knew it had to happen, soon, as
soon as he heard Wylie was in town.
The two glare at each other for a mo
ment.
A close-up of the Marshall's hand
stroking the old leather, of his face,
where one can read the fame that has
been his. Then slowly, carefully, with
the toe of his boot he starts drawing
the regulation six foot circle in the
dust of the street as Wylie kneels and
sets out his marbles, one by one.
Or perhaps:
The sccnc: A hostile alien planet.
Jim Quirk, commander of the starship
Outerprod. Science Officer Sprocket,
and Ship's Surgeon Hatfield have
beamed down to check out an obvious

ly hazardous situation.
Quirk: "This is where Allen's crew
was last heard from. All his ship heard
was a garbled rgll or rugll. They man
aged to relay that before whatever got
Allen got them."
Sprocket: "Yes, Sir, we know it
was Rigellians. They claim they were in
this sector of space three thousand
years before us, which they think gives
them some kind of priority. The Feder
ation says to go ahead with the col
onization, and to ignore the Rigellians,
but above all not to resort to violence.
You know the resolution the Council
passed against the Phaser last year."
"Right, Sprocket, but what do
these Rigellians look like? We hadn't
contacted them yet when 1 was in the
Academy, and all this starship com
manding doesn't give a fellow much
chance to catch up on his reading."
"That won't be necessary. Sir. It
will be sufficient to turn around and
observe one. Note the height, well over
the ten or twelve feet thought to be
maximum for an earth gravity planet.
Note also the dental formation, charac
teristic of course of the carnivore, and
whose structure strikingly parallels that
of the Terran sabertooth, though much
more highly developed. The tenta
cles ..."
"What'll we do?" squeaks Hatfield.
"Don't worry, men," snaps Quirk
as lie whips out his portable field mod
el White I lag, live by eight, with exten
sible aluminum staff. I RG-lOlOa,
"112 ederation policy is explicitly spelled
out in situations like this. All we have
to do is negotiate a truce with the
enemy and talk the poor devils to
death."

Or, finally:
"And now Wide Wide World takes
you to the heart of the Dark Conti
nent, where we will follow a little na
tive lad through a typical day in his
life. His name is Little Black Sambo,
but everybody caiJs him B.S. for short.
"Smile at the camera, B.S. He lives
in the cute little thatched hut over
there, with his adorable native mother,
who everybody hereabouts knows as
Aunt Jemima. No one seems to know
where his fun-loving native father is.
"And now we see little B.S. walking
along this jungly native trail. Isn't it
cozy? Oh, look, a tiger is chasing B.S.
That little fellow sure can run, can't
he? More tigers are chasing him, and
they're gaining on him too."
"Gee whiz, folks, the tigers ran so
fast they melted themselves into but
ter, right before our very eyes. Now
tonight when B.S. goes home, Aunt
Jemima will make him a big stack of
pancakes, and he'll pour the butter
over them and eat them, and after that
he'll live happily ever after.

the swinging doors of the Last Chance

black hat to the soles of his dusty

The Marshall walks slowly to the

"Is til is the way it's going to have
to be, Wylie?" he asks, but he knows it
is, knew it had to happen, soon, as
soon as he heard Wylie was in town.
The two glare at each other for a mo

A close-up of the Marshall's hand
stroking the old leather, of his face,

sets out his marbles, one by one.

The sccnc: A hostile alien planet.
Jim Quirk, commander of the starship
Outerprod. Science Officer Sprocket,
and Ship's Surgeon Hatfield have
beamed down to check out an obvious

ly hazardous situation.
Quirk: "This is where Allen's crew
was last heard from. All his ship heard
was a garbled rgll or rugll. They man
aged to relay that before whatever got
Allen got them."
Sprocket: "Yes, Sir, we know it
was Rigellians. They claim they were in
this sector of space three thousand
years before us, which they think gives
them some kind of priority. The Feder
ation says to go ahead with the col
onization, and to ignore the Rigellians,
but above all not to resort to violence.
You know the resolution the Council
passed against the Phaser last year."
"Right, Sprocket, but what do
these Rigellians look like? We hadn't
contacted them yet when 1 was in the
Academy, and all this starship com
manding doesn't give a fellow much
chance to catch up on his reading."
"That won't be necessary. Sir. It
will be sufficient to turn around and
observe one. Note the height, well over
the ten or twelve feet thought to be
maximum for an earth gravity planet.
Note also the dental formation, charac
teristic of course of the carnivore, and
whose structure strikingly parallels that
of the Terran sabertooth, though much
more highly developed. The tenta
cles ..."
"What'll we do?" squeaks Hatfield.
"Don't worry, men," snaps Quirk
as lie whips out his portable field mod
el White I lag, live by eight, with exten
sible aluminum staff. I RG-lOlOa,
"112 ederation policy is explicitly spelled
out in situations like this. All we have
to do is negotiate a truce with the
enemy and talk the poor devils to
death."

"And now Wide Wide World takes
