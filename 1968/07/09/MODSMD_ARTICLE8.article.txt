# My Foot's In The Door And It Hurts
## An Esalen Trip

"Assemble yourselves in groups of
six each. Introduce yourselves and get
to know each other. After you have
talked for five or ten minutes, decide
which individual in your group you dis
like the most and tell him you dislike
him and why you do if possible.
"After all the people in your group
have voted on the most odious indi
vidual there, determine the consensus
of opinion and whoever gets the most
votes, tell him to get lost," a bearded
wonder named David told a body of a
hundred or so ESALEN volunteers one
Tuesday afternoon.
For some of the students and facul
ty members who thronged to the
"sense-in" last week it was an oppor
tunity to vent those immediate feelings
of dislike one feels for people who you
don't even know. For myself and per
haps for most it was an arbitrary or
seemingly arbitrary decision.
Looking for something useful out
of this experiment. 1 allied my reasons
for disliking our 'rejectee with the
things 1 dislike about myself. I have
disallied them since. 1 am not going to
praise the social utility of this experi
ment any more than I would any other
kind of turn-on.
Exclusion Game
This experiment called the inclu
sion-exclusion game was only a small
part of the two afternoon and evening
programs put on by ESALEN.
Other expenments vaned trom
group sensual stimulation to arm
wrestling to completely honest conver
sation.
It is a beautiful experience when
someone tells you you are a ruthless
aggressive individual when you always
thought you were an easy-going hang
loose guy like anyone else.

If you haven't turned on to the ex
perience, you will probably try to
prove how easy going and how hang
loose you really are or think you are.
Urge To Accentuate
But if you have turned on to tne
experience, then there is a titillating
urge to accentuate the criticisms made
of you. If someone said you're probab
ly gluttonous, likely as not you'll go
downstairs and buy some candy bars.
Then it's a put-on.
Perhaps such an experiment aims at
making people experience reality more
fully by eliminating social role-playing
from the beginning. It doesn't work
nor could it. The experiments used in
this program are almost identical to the
warm-up sessions practiced by acting
companies before rehearsals. But the
acting companies are not trying to
bring your inner self out into open
view-if they did they wouldn't
be ACTING companies.
Both destroy social inhibitions and
turn you on to the beauty of simple
everyday experiences. But under stress
of such social scrutiny one heads for a
more defensible consistent personal
ity-more consistent than he or anyone
else really is.
Cross Sample
This was clear in my group which
was a perfect cross sample of the Stan
ford society. Out of six people we had
one foreign student, Raphael, from
Colombia; half of the group was gradu
ate and half undergraduate. Two of the
graduates were considerably older than
the rest of us. Half to two-thirds of the
group was "straight," the rest, "hip" or
semi-hip.
Most noticeable of all, the ratio ot
men to women was two to one. It was
a miniature matriarchal society just
like Stanford is and always has been.
Of the two women one was a some
what inhibited but mildly attractive
middle-aged woman from Seattle here

doing summer research. Her inhibitions
were soon jettisoned as she began to
recognize the glory of being a woman
on the Stanford campus. A love rela
tionship was on tiie blossom in
minutes-probably the first she'd had
in years.
Amid Courtiers
The other female, Katy, was more
captivating-both literally and unliter
ally-beautiful, young, pleasant, semi
hip, with # that woman-of-the-world
forcefulness of most Stanford dollies;
in short, lovely amid her courtiers. The
result of this set of relationships was
on the surface groupishly beautiful but
just as unauthentic as most other Stan
ford social functions.
It was fun, with an alluring charm
you could get nostalgic about in times
of phonier relationships.
A group of people who don't know
each other can't walk into a room and
suddenly be honest with each other.
Groove
In such a group you can groove to
the experience of carefully observing a
set of social relationships develop. That
alone is captivating.
The attempt of members of such a
group to be completely honest leads to
perhaps the greatest dishonesty. You
want to prove your honesty. Your own
inconsistencies, unless they arc the in
describable inconsistencies accepted in
the hippie society, seem too weak to
display. Honesty does not seem honest
unless it is simple. You drop the con
ditional clauses and compound sen
tences and compose yourself into a
simple sentence. Then other members
of your group can put on their contact
lenses and read you. And everybody
lounges happily in a bath of honesty
perceived through their contacts,

Urge To Accentuate
But if you have turned on to tne
experience, then there is a titillating
urge to accentuate the criticisms made
of you. If someone said you're probab
ly gluttonous, likely as not you'll go
downstairs and buy some candy bars.
Then it's a put-on.
Perhaps such an experiment aims at
making people experience reality more
fully by eliminating social role-playing
from the beginning. It doesn't work
nor could it. The experiments used in
this program are almost identical to the
warm-up sessions practiced by acting
companies before rehearsals. But the
acting companies are not trying to
bring your inner self out into open
view-if they did they wouldn't
be ACTING companies.
Both destroy social inhibitions and
turn you on to the beauty of simple
everyday experiences. But under stress
of such social scrutiny one heads for a
more defensible consistent personal
ity-more consistent than he or anyone
else really is.
Cross Sample
This was clear in my group which
was a perfect cross sample of the Stan
ford society. Out of six people we had
one foreign student, Raphael, from
Colombia; half of the group was gradu
ate and half undergraduate. Two of the
graduates were considerably older than
the rest of us. Half to two-thirds of the
group was "straight," the rest, "hip" or
semi-hip.
Most noticeable of all, the ratio ot
men to women was two to one. It was
a miniature matriarchal society just
like Stanford is and always has been.
Of the two women one was a some
what inhibited but mildly attractive
middle-aged woman from Seattle here

doing summer research. Her inhibitions
were soon jettisoned as she began to
recognize the glory of being a woman
on the Stanford campus. A love rela
tionship was on tiie blossom in
minutes-probably the first she'd had
in years.
Amid Courtiers
The other female, Katy, was more
captivating-both literally and unliter
ally-beautiful, young, pleasant, semi
hip, with # that woman-of-the-world
forcefulness of most Stanford dollies;
in short, lovely amid her courtiers. The
result of this set of relationships was
on the surface groupishly beautiful but
just as unauthentic as most other Stan
ford social functions.
It was fun, with an alluring charm
you could get nostalgic about in times
of phonier relationships.
A group of people who don't know
each other can't walk into a room and
suddenly be honest with each other.
Groove
In such a group you can groove to
the experience of carefully observing a
set of social relationships develop. That
alone is captivating.
The attempt of members of such a
group to be completely honest leads to
perhaps the greatest dishonesty. You
want to prove your honesty. Your own
inconsistencies, unless they arc the in
describable inconsistencies accepted in
the hippie society, seem too weak to
display. Honesty does not seem honest
unless it is simple. You drop the con
ditional clauses and compound sen
tences and compose yourself into a
simple sentence. Then other members
of your group can put on their contact
lenses and read you. And everybody
lounges happily in a bath of honesty
perceived through their contacts,
i — —
"Assemble yourselves in groups of
six each. Introduce yourselves and get
to know each other. After you have
talked for five or ten minutes, decide
which individual in your group you dis
like the most and tell him you dislike
him and why you do if possible.
"After all the people in your group
have voted on the most odious indi
vidual there, determine the consensus
of opinion and whoever gets the most
votes, tell him to get lost," a bearded
wonder named David told a body of a
hundred or so ESALEN volunteers one
Tuesday afternoon.
For some of the students and facul
ty members who thronged to the
"sense-in" last week it was an oppor
tunity to vent those immediate feelings
of dislike one feels for people who you
don't even know. For myself and per
haps for most it was an arbitrary or
seemingly arbitrary decision.
Looking for something useful out
of this experiment. 1 allied my reasons
for disliking our 'rejectee with the
things 1 dislike about myself. I have
disallied them since. 1 am not going to
praise the social utility of this experi
ment any more than I would any other
kind of turn-on.

programs put on by ESALEN.

It is a beautiful experience when
someone tells you you are a ruthless
aggressive individual when you always

minutes-probably the first she'd had

Amid Courtiers
The other female, Katy, was more
captivating-both literally and unliter
ally-beautiful, young, pleasant, semi
hip, with # that woman-of-the-world
forcefulness of most Stanford dollies;
in short, lovely amid her courtiers. The
result of this set of relationships was
on the surface groupishly beautiful but
just as unauthentic as most other Stan
ford social functions.
It was fun, with an alluring charm
you could get nostalgic about in times
of phonier relationships.
A group of people who don't know
each other can't walk into a room and
suddenly be honest with each other.
Groove
In such a group you can groove to
the experience of carefully observing a
set of social relationships develop. That
alone is captivating.
The attempt of members of such a
group to be completely honest leads to
perhaps the greatest dishonesty. You
want to prove your honesty. Your own
inconsistencies, unless they arc the in
describable inconsistencies accepted in
the hippie society, seem too weak to
display. Honesty does not seem honest
unless it is simple. You drop the con
ditional clauses and compound sen
tences and compose yourself into a
simple sentence. Then other members
of your group can put on their contact
lenses and read you. And everybody
lounges happily in a bath of honesty
perceived through their contacts,

"Assemble yourselves in groups of
six each. Introduce yourselves and get
to know each other. After you have
talked for five or ten minutes, decide
which individual in your group you dis
like the most and tell him you dislike
him and why you do if possible.
"After all the people in your group
have voted on the most odious indi
vidual there, determine the consensus
of opinion and whoever gets the most
votes, tell him to get lost," a bearded
wonder named David told a body of a
hundred or so ESALEN volunteers one
Tuesday afternoon.
For some of the students and facul
ty members who thronged to the
"sense-in" last week it was an oppor
tunity to vent those immediate feelings
of dislike one feels for people who you
don't even know. For myself and per
haps for most it was an arbitrary or
seemingly arbitrary decision.
Looking for something useful out
of this experiment. 1 allied my reasons
for disliking our 'rejectee with the
things 1 dislike about myself. I have
disallied them since. 1 am not going to
praise the social utility of this experi
ment any more than I would any other
kind of turn-on.
Exclusion Game
This experiment called the inclu
sion-exclusion game was only a small
part of the two afternoon and evening
programs put on by ESALEN.
Other expenments vaned trom
group sensual stimulation to arm
wrestling to completely honest conver
sation.
It is a beautiful experience when
someone tells you you are a ruthless
aggressive individual when you always
thought you were an easy-going hang
loose guy like anyone else.

If you haven't turned on to the ex
perience, you will probably try to
prove how easy going and how hang
loose you really are or think you are.
Urge To Accentuate
But if you have turned on to tne
experience, then there is a titillating
urge to accentuate the criticisms made
of you. If someone said you're probab
ly gluttonous, likely as not you'll go
downstairs and buy some candy bars.
Then it's a put-on.
Perhaps such an experiment aims at
making people experience reality more
fully by eliminating social role-playing
from the beginning. It doesn't work
nor could it. The experiments used in
this program are almost identical to the
warm-up sessions practiced by acting
companies before rehearsals. But the
acting companies are not trying to
bring your inner self out into open
view-if they did they wouldn't
be ACTING companies.
Both destroy social inhibitions and
turn you on to the beauty of simple
everyday experiences. But under stress
of such social scrutiny one heads for a
more defensible consistent personal
ity-more consistent than he or anyone
else really is.
Cross Sample
This was clear in my group which
was a perfect cross sample of the Stan
ford society. Out of six people we had
one foreign student, Raphael, from
Colombia; half of the group was gradu
ate and half undergraduate. Two of the
graduates were considerably older than
the rest of us. Half to two-thirds of the
group was "straight," the rest, "hip" or
semi-hip.
Most noticeable of all, the ratio ot
men to women was two to one. It was
a miniature matriarchal society just
like Stanford is and always has been.
Of the two women one was a some
what inhibited but mildly attractive
middle-aged woman from Seattle here

doing summer research. Her inhibitions
were soon jettisoned as she began to
recognize the glory of being a woman
on the Stanford campus. A love rela
tionship was on tiie blossom in
minutes-probably the first she'd had
in years.
