# Ancient Tree Has Heirs
## 
### FRIEDRICH ABEL 
Last week I was searching in the
University Archives for interesting de
tails about El Palo Alto, the "tall tree"
that gave its name to a city, its image
to a university seal, and is known to
historians as the oldest living landmark
in California.
Among booklets, newspaper clip
pings, and photographs I found a note
whose content seems to have complete
ly escaped the University memory.
About 1915, the note says, Stan
ford botany professor George Peirce
recognized the morbid nature of the El

Palo Alto at San Francisquito Creek.
He realized that the redwood that had
already been a sapling when America
was discovered would be dying within
a century or so.
Living Symbol
To save a living symbol for the Uni
versity and to bring it closer to Stan
ford he planted six redwoods in the
corner across Jordan Hall, between Ser
ra Street, the Oval, and the Biology
building. The late professor's idea was
that the tallest and healthiest of the
trees should take over the title of the
Palo Alto when the old tree passes.
Interested by this detail of Stan
ford's history, I walked over to the de
picted site of the six redwoods 1 had
never heard of.
The trees are still there.
Growing in a circular arrangement,
the trunks only several feet apart and
the branches interlacing, a gloomy
porch is formed with only a small slit
open to the sky.
Junk Yard
The ground inside the cluster of
trees can only be described as a
junk-yard. Rusty pipes, an old raincoat
and shoes, paper, rotten lumber and
several large tool-boxes produce a de
pressing backyard atmosphere. I could
not help thinking of an Indian myth
which regarded the ground under a red
wood as sacred and its shadow safe for
all. Undoubtedly we have moved away
from this belief.
The six redwoods, one twin and
four singles between 40 and 60 feet
tall, look pretty much uncared for;
dead wood has not been removed for
ages.
A master plan has already been de
signed for developing the outer sec
tions of the Oval, including the site of
the six redwoods,, said Don Rolfs,
senior planner at the University Plan
ning Office. Shrubbery will be taken
out of the area, new trees planted and
a series of pathways built, he said. The

redwoods will be preserved in their
present arrangement, Rolfs added.
Only a few years before his death in
1954, her father had written to the
University to remind it of the trees'
original purpose, said Rosamond
Peirce, associate statistician at Stan
ford's Food Research Institute. How
ever, Stanford never picked up the idea
of officially recognizing a new, or a
substitutional symbol tree, she said.
The University simply ignored the
whole subject.

There are no principal reasons
against placing a memorial plSte in the
vicinity of the trees, naming Professor
Peirce as the planter of the redwoods
and linking the history of El Palo Alto
with that of the younger Stanford
symbol trees, Don Carlson, associate
director of University Relations, said.
The Daily is sending a proposal to the
University Relations Office, explaining
the purpose of a memorial plate and
stating its possible text.


SEIS PALOS ALTOS-These six trees were planted more than fifty years ago
by the late Prof. George Peirce in hopes of nurturing a successor to El Palo
Alto when the old tree dies. In the foreground is Rosamond Peirce, the late
professor's daughter, a statistician at Stanford.
