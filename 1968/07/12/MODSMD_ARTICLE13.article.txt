## Med School Gets Grant 
### PETER DO LINGER 
The Stanford University School of
Medicine has been awarded a grant of
$1.2 million for a new Medical
Scientist Training Program (MSTP)..
Dr. Leonard A. Herzenberg, associ
ate professor of genetics and director
of the program, explained that the
National Institutes of Health grant was
to cover the coming five-year period.
The purpose of the MSTP, Herzenberg,
said, is "to provide fellowship support
for medical students interested in
gaining competence in research meth
ods at the same time as their medical
training."
The program is especially important
because it represents one of the first
instances of public support for stu
dents seeking the M.D. degree.
A medical student who is interested
in research may be nominated during
his first year of medical school by any
faculty member of the university.
Eight applications per year will be se
lected by a committee headed by Dr.
Herzenberg.

Criteria for selection are the stu
dent's academic qualifications, motiva
tion toward a career in medical re
search, and proposed research while in
the MSTP. Dr. Herzenberg expressed
hope that students would be able to
serve on the selection committee.
If accepted to the program, the stu
dent will receive a full tuition grant
plus a stipend to cover living expenses
and dependents. The support will begin
after the first year and continue for the
following four years, or as long as the
student remains in the MSTP.
Students in the MSTP will be re
quired to devote at least two years to
full time research and submit a thesis.
Research will be under the supervision
of a sponsor, much the same as current
programs for Ph.D. candidates.
Programs such as the MSTP, which
have also been awarded to the medical
schools of Duke and New York Uni
versity, are an important advance for
medical research. Medical students who
are not independently wealthy often
incur debts of up to $20,000 while in

"At that point," Dr. Herzenberg
noted, "the tendency to make some
money as fast as possible is very strong,
thus forcing some M.D.'s whose inter
est is research into private practive for
several years."
The American Medical Association
(AMA) has lobbied against scholarship
aid to medical students for many years.
