## Shankar's Concert 'Superb' 
### 
The smell of incense filled Frost
Ampitheater last Friday and Saturday
I nights as Ravi Shankar's Festival From
[ India came to Stanford.
The sound of a shenai, an oboe-like
instrument played by Sharad Kumar,
greeted the audience as it filed in
1 riday. The shenai is traditionally re
served for auspicious occasions, and
this event definitely qualified.
For as the sun set and a slight chill
settied, a bright moon rose high above
Hoover Tower as Ravi Shankar and Ali
Akbar Khan, two of India's greatest
musicians, came on stage.
Shankar, master of the sitar, and
Khan, acknowledged as India's most
accomplished sarod player, then per
formed three string duets which were
the highlight of the evening.
The duets were an amazing union of
the two instruments. One man would
play a phrase, and the other would
answer. The responses seemed so per
fect it soon seemed that each musician
could anticipate the others questions.
The two complemented each other
beautifully.
Despite constant tuning of the deli
cate instruments due to the changes in
temperature, their performance was
superb. Shankar's sitar was sometimes
sad and plaintive, at other times gay
and joyful, the moods created with
equal ease. Khan followed every
rhythm, every nuance of Shankar, ex
pertly, and created some of his own.
It was an unforgettable tour de
force, and the audience gave the pair a
standing ovation.
