The arsonist who struck
President Sterling's office last
week may think himself in
the vanguard of The Revolu

a guerrilla warrior against the
Military-Industrial Complex.
But if so he has misunder

that must come in this
country if there is to be any
real change.

is to mean anything in the
long run, it must be carried
out with the absence of
violence. Not because some
people don't deserve to be
punished for what they have
done.
But rather because love is
simply the only thing that
really changes people for any
length of time. And love does
not happen easily when there
is first violence.
We do not oppose the re

welcome it because non
violence is a middle-class
tactic.
We welcome it because
non-violence, in short, is the
only thing that will work,
and is thus extremely utilitar
