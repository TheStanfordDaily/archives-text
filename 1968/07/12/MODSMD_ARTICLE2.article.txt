## Arson 
### 
The arsonist who struck
President Sterling's office last
week may think himself in
the vanguard of The Revolu
tion. He may view himself as
a guerrilla warrior against the
Military-Industrial Complex.
But if so he has misunder
stood the kind of revolution
that must come in this
country if there is to be any
real change.
If the revolution to come
is to mean anything in the
long run, it must be carried
out with the absence of
violence. Not because some
people don't deserve to be
punished for what they have
done.
But rather because love is
simply the only thing that
really changes people for any
length of time. And love does
not happen easily when there
is first violence.
We do not oppose the re
volution to come. We wel
come it. And we do not
welcome it because non
violence is a middle-class
tactic.
We welcome it because
non-violence, in short, is the
only thing that will work,
and is thus extremely utilitar
ian.
Hate isn't.
Destruction isn't.
To ravage the momentos
of a man who lias done a
good deal in his own way to
further the revolution in edu
cation, enlightenment, and
love that will be a parge part
of the revolution we await
that isn't useful either.
The action of the arsonist

is on a plane of culture that
most America has not trans
cended yet.
Not in New York's Cen
tral Park or on a Pasadena
freeway or in the rice paddies
of Vietnam. But on a plane
that a university community
must try to understand and

then to transcend.
We deplore irrational
reactions to the arson in the
vein of the strange poein on
page one of today's DAILY
almost as much as we do the
arson. For that also bespeaks
a misunderstanding of what
is needed now—not more
violence, but more love.
