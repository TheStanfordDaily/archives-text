# 'Integration Primary Goal Of Urban Education'â€”Stokes
## Mayor Stokes 
### 
Wholly integrated metropolitan
school systems may be the answer to
the ghetto youngster's education prob
lems, the Negro mayor of Cleveland
suggested to 150 school administrators
here Monday.

Addressing the opening session of
the School Planning Laboratory's
summer institute, Mayor Carl B. Stokes
said that cities and suburbs could ex
change pupils, teachers, and adminis
trators in order to show Negro young

stcrs how it is with his white middle
class American peers.
"Integration," he declared, "must
remain a primary goal of urban edu
cation, as some who favor decentrali
zation agree. Wherever possible, poor
children should have the opportunity
to attend schools outside slum areas.
City-suburb lines must not stand as
barriers. . . Suburban school systems
must open up to them, and the city
systems must seek out and promote
opportunities for exchanges of pupils
and construction of schools where they
can be jointly used by city and subur
ban children."
"Educational parks" ranging from
kindergarten through high school and
junior college could be constructed to
serve both classes of youngsters, Mayor
Stokes suggested. Joint meetings be
tween urban and suburban school
boards could be held to plan solutions
to joint problems.
Though this might come to pass in
the big cities. Mayor Stokes told the
opening session of the wceklong semi
nar, large concentrations of children
still will have to attend segregated
schools.
"Far from resting immobilized by
the division between integration and
community control, urban school
systems should move vigorously on
both objectives," the youthful mayor
emphasized. "We are in a period which
calls for change, and school adminis
trators must be inventors, experi
menters and impatient men of action."
Head Start, which he praised lavish

portance of early childhood education,
but few school systems have moved to
provide universal early childhood edu
cation for children who need it." He
questioned "how long we can continue
such malpractice and still survive as a
nation.
"City and suburban schools set up
barriers when they have much of
mutual benefit, and upquestioned
interdependent needs. Integrationists
and community control advocates
battle each other when their
approaches are actually compatible and
complementary. Professional educators
reject community opinion when it is
actually a fertile source of ideas and
support. America is an affluent
country, but even we can no longer
afford such extravagance."
