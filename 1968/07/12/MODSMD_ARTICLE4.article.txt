"The Winds of Freedom Blow"
Motto of Stanford University
(The following is a poem sent to the editor of the Daily
concerning the last week's fire in President Sterling's office
from Maury Travis, '27, a member of the Rocky Mountain
Stanford Club.)
"The winds of freedom blow"
To roars of anarchy from far below:
The winds of arson do destroy
Respect for law and order—woe!
How long must Stanford ever yield
To subversion from criminals afield?
What price sweet permissiveness now?
Too late the ashes sadness blows.
Take off the blinders of Academe!
Strike at those whose anarchy is beamed
At Stanford's proud name dragged into the dust
By those whose acts define their unholy lust!
L 'envoi
To Jordan and Branner we pledge anew
Our vows to Wilbur and Tressider {sic) too:
Resolve must we for Stanford's name
No haven give to those who ill defame!
Maury M. Travis
