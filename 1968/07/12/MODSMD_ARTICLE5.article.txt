# The 						Conservative Case
## Respect For The Law 
### Raymond R. White 
The United States of America has
come farther along the upward path to
wards social justice and material well
being for all of its citizens than has any
nation with comparable size or minori
ties.
Injustices and inequalities exist arid
will persist as long as men are human.
The only effective way to mitigate this
fact is to promote education of people
to get them to understand and to be
have as if one given person is as good as
another until individual experience
proves otherwise.
It seems clear to me that interper
sonal relations cannot be effectively
legislated. They must grow. Education
can make them grow. Riots cannot.
There are far too many people
supposedly possessive of functional
minds who now look only at how far
we have to go to reach perfect equality
of men (if this is indeed ultimately
cither possible or wise) and fail to sec
how far we have already come and how
many opportunities actually do exist.
A group called Citizens Against
Racism in Redwood City has Viuncov
ered'/s thirty full time jobs, but has
been unable to find any members of
minority groups to apply for the avail
able positions. Likewise, they have
found houses for rent to minority
group members, but have found no one
who requires their help in procuring
housing.
"Maybe" free enterprise works even
here and now.

Yet increasingly some people are
taking to the streets by day and by
night to throw rocks and to set fires.
This last I find to be the most
reprehensible of all acts of unreasoned
protest.
The burning of the NROTC annex
(twice), the burning of President Ster
ling's office, and similar acts perpct
rated against, citizens, colleges, and
draft boards across the country are the
acts of extremists who believe that vio
lence in the enforcement of the (their)
minority will on the whole society is
no vice.
These fire-bombing anarchists are
not "those downtrodden." They are
not dispossessed, disenfranchised, or
starving to death. While 1 can't imagine
a reason that could lift the burden of
the guilt of wanton destruction from
their shoulders, they have no reasons
of any rational description.
The rule of law which grew up with
the greatness of the British people is
not a heritage which I would ever care
to cast aside, whatever the promised
benefits to follow therefrom. The
people "manning the barricades just
across the bay" in Berkeley were doing
so in explicit defiance of the rule of
law.
Their leaders were asked to follow
previously, legally established proce
dures, and were promised that if they
did so they would Qnd their proposed
demonstration promptly approved.
Peter Conejo, leading the Young

Socialist Alliance, reported back to Ins
followers that they would have to take
to the streets to protect, indeed to
gain, their rights of free speech and
assembly. Fools believed him and
scoundrels contributed their part to
the ensuing riots.
If Conejo really thought that his
rights were being abridged, I am sure
tli at the American Civil Liberties
Union would have been willing to enter
a test case for him in the courts. If the'
courts were to find for him, then he
would have peacefully changed the
structure of his society, accomplishing
more than just one permit for one
rally.
However, he chose the use of vio
lence and its threat, and worse, the
City Council gave in. This can only
leave one to doubt that one's faith in
the rule of law is based on a solid
foundation.
In the atmosphere which engulfs the
nation today we need words and, more
important, deeds to reaffirm the dedi
cation of the leaders and the people to
the concept and the practice of the
rule of law.
The acceptance of social and politi
cal upheaval can only destroy what we
have today, it cannot build anything
better. That can only be done by a
mutual commitment to the rule of law
and a commitment to work within the
system (to change it, if need t?e) to
maintain and to promote the justice
upon which free men thrive.

The rule of law which grew up with
