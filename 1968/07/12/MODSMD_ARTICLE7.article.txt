# Huey Newton

### Anne Johnson Mike Vawter 
Huey P. Newton, leader of the
Black Panther Party, goes on trial for
murder at 10 a.m. on Monday, July 15.
The Black Panther Party and the Peace
and Freedoqi Movement are sponsoring
a support demonstration outside the'
Alameda County Courthouse in Oak
land.
The charges against Huey stem from
an early morning incident on October
28, 1967. Officer John Frey of the
Oakland Police Dept. was shot and
killed after he and another officer
stopped a car containing Huey Newton
and an unidentified second person.
Both Huey and the second officer were
wounded. When Huey came to Kaiser
Hospital seeking medical aid for gun
shot wounds in the abdomen, he was
arrested and handcuffed to the bed be
fore receiving treatment.
On November 13, 1967, the
Alameda County Grand Jury, after
hearing the evidence, went to lunch, re

convened at 1:43 p.m. and twenty
seven minutes later (at 2:10 p.m.), re
turned a three-count indictment
accusing Huey Newton of murder,
assault with a deadly weapon on a
police officer, and kidnapping.
The Grand Jury was composed of
14 people, all over 50 years of age, 13
of them white, and each handpicked
by three judges-close friends of presid
ing Judge Raymond Staats. These jud
ges have stated that Grand Jury mem
bers axe purposely chosen from high
income groups because such people
have more free time for their duties.
The Grand Jury proceedings
brought out no evidence that lluey
possessed a gun at the time of the in
cident: no testimony, no murder wea
pon. (Officer Frey was killed by .38
caliber bullets-the same as police ser
vice revolvers.) Surviving Officer
Heanes' testimony on the shooting is
confused: he is not clear as to who lie
shot, if anyone, or even what he was
doing during part of the incident.
Another twist: the original police claim

that the other alleged person involved
was a woman has been changed. She is
now a man- unique and complex bio
logical process beyond the competence
of police departments.
Huey's caseis but one of many in
volvements which members of the
Black Panther Party have had with
Oakland authorities. The program of
their political party covers many areas,
from jobs and housina to fair trials for

black prisoners.
The Black Panther Party while
building mass support in the ghetto,
has also established a functional politi
cal alliance with white radicals through
the Peace and Freedom Party. This de
velopment has been extremely disturb
ing to Oakland authorities. Its political
uniqueness sheds some light on motives
behind the campaign to smash the
Panther organization. The Panthers
seek white support, and the demonstra
tion Monday is designed to display the
black-white solidarity which has devel
oped in the past nine months.

The Black Panther Party and the Peace
and Freedoqi Movement are sponsoring
a support demonstration outside the'
Alameda County Courthouse in Oak
land.
The charges against Huey stem from
an early morning incident on October
28, 1967. Officer John Frey of the
Oakland Police Dept. was shot and
killed after he and another officer
stopped a car containing Huey Newton
and an unidentified second person.
Both Huey and the second officer were
wounded. When Huey came to Kaiser
Hospital seeking medical aid for gun
shot wounds in the abdomen, he was
arrested and handcuffed to the bed be
fore receiving treatment.
On November 13, 1967, the
Alameda County Grand Jury, after
hearing the evidence, went to lunch, re

convened at 1:43 p.m. and twenty
seven minutes later (at 2:10 p.m.), re
turned a three-count indictment
accusing Huey Newton of murder,
assault with a deadly weapon on a
police officer, and kidnapping.
The Grand Jury was composed of
14 people, all over 50 years of age, 13
of them white, and each handpicked
by three judges-close friends of presid
ing Judge Raymond Staats. These jud
ges have stated that Grand Jury mem
bers axe purposely chosen from high
income groups because such people
have more free time for their duties.
The Grand Jury proceedings
brought out no evidence that lluey
possessed a gun at the time of the in
cident: no testimony, no murder wea
pon. (Officer Frey was killed by .38
caliber bullets-the same as police ser
vice revolvers.) Surviving Officer
Heanes' testimony on the shooting is
confused: he is not clear as to who lie
shot, if anyone, or even what he was
doing during part of the incident.
Another twist: the original police claim

that the other alleged person involved
was a woman has been changed. She is
now a man- unique and complex bio
logical process beyond the competence
of police departments.
Huey's caseis but one of many in
volvements which members of the
Black Panther Party have had with
Oakland authorities. The program of
their political party covers many areas,
from jobs and housina to fair trials for

black prisoners.
The Black Panther Party while
building mass support in the ghetto,
has also established a functional politi
cal alliance with white radicals through
the Peace and Freedom Party. This de
velopment has been extremely disturb
ing to Oakland authorities. Its political
uniqueness sheds some light on motives
behind the campaign to smash the
Panther organization. The Panthers
seek white support, and the demonstra
tion Monday is designed to display the
black-white solidarity which has devel
oped in the past nine months.
