# Glaser Talks On The University
## 
### PATRICK McMAHON DANIEL SNELL 
Stanford's newly-named acting Pres
ident Robert Glaser wants to talk to
students. And he wants students,
faculty, administrators, and trustees to
do a lot mote talking.
"The one thing 1 do hope to do is
try- to see if we can't get a more mean
ingful exchange between students,
(acuity, administrators, and trustees,"
Glaser told the DAILY.
"1 think the Trustees want to meet
with students as much as students arc
interested in meeting with Trustees,"
he said.
The brown-haired, 49-year old Med
ical School dean who takes over the
University's helm Sept. 1, talked about
students and how they can participate
in University reform.

Mass Meetings
"I don't believe that great mass
meetings are where you can get things
done," Glaser said. But he wants to
talk to as many students as possible,
scheduling informal lunch meetings
with small groups of students and
direct line discussions similar to the
one Provost Richard Lyman held at the
end of May which 60 students at
tended.
He said he would also try to set up
informal meetings between groups of
students and groups of Trustees.
"But communication between all
constituencies of the University-the
students, Trustees, alumni, faculty, and
administration-cannot solve all prob
lems quickly.
No Flutes
"We won't all be playing flutes in
the l lysian Fields. But if we cannot

begin to resolve some of our problems
in a university community where we
have excellent people with excellent
minds, we can't do it anywhere in our
country," Glaser said.
He said he felt most Stanford peo
ple do want to make the University
better. "If they really don't want to oe
constructive," Glaser said, "then all
bets are off."
Glaser said he hoped stepped-up
communication among University con
sututencies will sidestep the need for
confrontation politics like the sit-in in
the Old Union at the beginning of May.
fortunate
Referring to tne Old Union sit-in,
Glaser said it was fortunate that the
University escaped the "tremendous
upheaval" that shook Columbia Uni
versity.
"1 think there's no one who doesn't

think that we're in a time of great
change-at home and overseas too-and
the University and other institutions
have to change too.
"The important question is how do
we make the changes creatively? We
have got to keep this institution living
with the times." Glaser said.
Committees
One way would be to increase active
and meaningful student participation
in committee activity, according to
Glaser. But there are other things that
must be done too, he said, and other
programs that would give students a
more meaningful role in the University.
"A fellow doesn't want to do mean
ingless work if he's bright; he knows
it's a waste of his time," Glaser said.
Glaser said his position as acting
president was going to be a tricky one.
He doesn't know how long he'll have
to serve or how soon the trustee will
name a permanent successor to retiring
President J. E. Wallace Sterling.
Med School
"But I hope it won't be too long,"
he said, "I'm anxious to get back to
this full-time job." He said that he
wants to spend some time at the Medi

cal School while President ("maybe
two half-days a week or something").
Glaser said he'd "prohbly appoint
an acting dean" of the Medical School
until he returns, "but I'd like to keep
my hand in here a little too." He was
unsure whether he would remain on
the faculty committee on the selection
of a new President.
Long-range decision-making for the
University might be awkward for an
acting President, Glaser intimiated. He
said that he would "try to avoid mak
ing major decisions that are really per
manent," leaving those for the new
President.
In Consultation
But he said he would make those
decisions that cannot wait in consulta
tion with fellow administrators "and
all members of the University com
munity."
The Study of Education (SES),
which Glaser called "a terribly im
portant thing," may be one of those
things that cannot wait, he said.
"A person is obliged to keep the
action going in an effective way," he
said. "I am anxious to see SES move
