## Biz Leaders Like Reagan 
### 
Three out of four California busi
ness leaders feel the Reagan Adminis-
Jration has done a "good" or

"excellent" job, but only one in 10
(9.8 per cent) favors the governor's
presidential nomination.

A clear majority (55.1 per cent)
back Richard Nixon, while nearly one
in four (22.9 per cent) endorse Gov
ernor Rockefeller's bid.
These arc highlights from a copy
righted survey of nearly 200 top exe
cutives conducted in late June by
David M. Rubin of the Stanford Uni
versity Communications Department.
The survey was sponsored by the pub
lishers of California Business, a weekly
newspaper which will give a full report
on the findings in its issue dated
Wednesday July 17.
The survey covered 366 of the
state's top business leaders, 181 of
whom replied to a mail questionnaire.
Those covered included the presidents
and board chairman of 100 of the
largest California industrial corpora
tions and selected leaders from finance,
communication, public utilities, higher
education, and legal firms.
More than a quarter of those reply
ing volunteered comments expressing
concern at the governor's bid for the
presidency. A majority of this group
felt cither that 1968 is too early for
Reagan to seek the nomination or that
he could never adequately handle the
job. Some opposed Reagan's candidacy
because they preferred that he con
tinue to serve the state.
Nearly three quarters (71 percent)
of the respondents said they voted for
C.oldwatcr in the 1964 election and
more than four out of five (83 per
cent) voted for Reagan in 1966. Over
all, they rated the Reagan administra
tion as follows:
Excellent 30.2%
Good 43.6%
Fair 17.3%
Poor 8.9%
