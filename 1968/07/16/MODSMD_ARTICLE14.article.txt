# 'Portrait Of Jason' Set For Tomorrow
## 
### 
Two showings of the brillian char
acter study, "Portrait of Jason," and a
talk by the movie's director, Shirley
Clarke, will be presented by the Stan
ford Summer Festival tomorrow.
The film will be shown at 4:30 and

8 n m. in Cubberley Auditorium as
part oT the festival's "New Films from
the Americas" series. Miss Clarke's
lecture-discussion will be presented
after the evening showing and will be
open to the public without charge.
"Portrait of Jason" is an autobio
graphical monologue-an emotional
strip-tease-by a Negro nightclub enter
tainer who describes his life as errand
boy, houseboy, call boy, and inmate in
jail and a psychopathic ward in addi
tion to his life in the lower echelon of
the cabaret universe.
Jason Holliday was filmed for 12
consecutive hours, the sole subject of
the camera. Miss Clarke distilled this
into a 105-minute motion picture des
cribed by Elia Kazan as "a piece of
new ground: hilarious, tragic, disturb
ing and intriguing."
Storm De Hirsch describes it as "a
bold, incisive choreography, a dance of
the human ego in all its ugly, beautiful
nakedness."
