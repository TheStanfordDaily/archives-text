At the Northern California Senior
Track Championships held last Sunday
in Berkeley, Alphonse Juilland, 45,
Professor of French and Linguistics at
Stanford University, took second place
in the hundred-yard dash.
His time of 11.2 bettered by one
tenth of a second the previous best by
an athlete over forty. Juilland was
edged by former Olympic great and
world record holder George Rhoden,
40, who won the event in 11.1.
