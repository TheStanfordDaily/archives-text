## Executives Back To School 
### 
Executives an; taking to summer
school in a big way, Stanford's Gradu
ate School of Business is finding.
Ten years ago, summertime was a
quiet time at the Business School.
Then, there were two programs and a
total of 80 students. This summer,
more than 1,000 executives, from pre
sidents to middle managers, arc signed
up for one of the 16 programs held
here or under the Business School's
sponsorship in one of five foreign
countries.
Courses vary from general manage
ment programs to groom executives for
top management to specialized pro
grams on the latest developments in
areas such as marketing, investment or
transportation management. Hie
summer courses run anywhere from
two days to two months.
Widespread use of computers, great
er reliance on quantitative methods,

and more extensive applications of the
behavioral sciences in business are
some of the reasons executives are
finding it not only worthwhile but
necessary to go back to school if they
want to stay at the forefront.
In some fields, such as marketing,

new knowledge threatens to make
some methods obsolete after only a
few years. A brochurc publicizing Stan
ford's "New Developments in Market
ing Management" program in fact says
it is a semiar "designed for executives
who have been out of business school
for five years or more."
