### PAUL DE LIBAN 
A Stanford student was arrested
Wednesday on burglary charges when
police officers found $8000 worth of
photographic equipment in his Wilbur
Hall room. Unconfirmed reports state
that the "equipment" was actually a
closed circuit television camera.
The student, Stephen Browne, 25,
of New York City, was not registered
this quarter but was living in the Wil
bur room.
Besides the camera, some tools re
ported stolen from Memorial Auditor
ium also were found in his room,
according tc the Santa Clara County
Sheriffs department.
He was booked at Santa Clara
County Jail on charges in connection
with the theft of the tools. He is also
being held for Palo Alto officers who
are expected to charge him with the
theft of the camera.
Another unconfirmed report states
that an IBM Selectric typewriter was
also found in his room. Several such
typewriters have been stolen at Stan
ford in recent weeks.

house of Stern Hall where a golf ball

week, a love seat, three chairs, a round
table, and sofa cushions, with a total
value of $696, were stolen from
Cardenal wing of Florence Moore Hall.
