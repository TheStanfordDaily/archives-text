## Choice Of A President 
### Patrick McMahon Patrick McMahon 
It didn't come as a great shock to
anyone that the Trustees named an act
ing president recently. Many observers
(professional I'residential-guessers)
were mildly shaken and all Lyman-
C'uthbertson bets were called off.
But what's interesting to consider is
why Stanford is having a difficult time
finding a permanent man for the slot.
Let's consider a possible discussion be
tween a trustee and a potential candi
date:
I RUS H I Would you be consid
ered on a short list for the Presidency
of Stanford University?
CANDIDATE: It certainly would be
an honor. Why Stanford certainly
would be attractive. There are a few
things I'd like to know about the Presi
dency.

T: Shoot.
C: As a scholar, I'm somewhat con
cerned about your Hoover Institution.
I am simply unimpressed with the ob
jectivity in its research and its active
political participation.
T: As President, you have control
over Hoover's activities but of course
Glen Campbell is doing a fine job of
fund-raising over there and I can't im
agine we'd want to replace him. He was
Herbert Hoover's choice you know.
C: It seems to be in the best
interests of Stanford to de-emphasize
inter-collegiate sports.
T: I'm a former athlete myself and I
think I can tell you that it did wonders
for me- the team spirit and all. And
the alumni depend on Big Game.
C: Big Game?

T: A California classic.
C: And what about fraternities and
sororities? Do you have any?
T: Why I'm a Beta myself. We're
quite proud of our residential system.
Why we've even got a coed fraternity
this fall. No sororities though. I never
have understood why President
Trcsiddcr did away with them. I guess
there were too many suicides or some
thing.
C: Does the University have any in
vestments in South Africa and what
exactly is its relationship to the Viet
nam War?
T: Trustees have complete control
of the endowment and investments,
and our object is to make money for
our educational enterprise at highest
