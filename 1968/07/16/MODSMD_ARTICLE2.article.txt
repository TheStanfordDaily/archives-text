## Choice Of A President 
### Patrick McMahon Patrick McMahon 
It didn't come as a great shock to
anyone that the Trustees named an act
ing president recently. Many observers
(professional I'residential-guessers)
were mildly shaken and all Lyman-
C'uthbertson bets were called off.
But what's interesting to consider is
why Stanford is having a difficult time
finding a permanent man for the slot.
Let's consider a possible discussion be
tween a trustee and a potential candi
date:
I RUS H I Would you be consid
ered on a short list for the Presidency
of Stanford University?
CANDIDATE: It certainly would be
an honor. Why Stanford certainly
would be attractive. There are a few
things I'd like to know about the Presi
dency.

T: Shoot.
C: As a scholar, I'm somewhat con
cerned about your Hoover Institution.
I am simply unimpressed with the ob
jectivity in its research and its active
political participation.
T: As President, you have control
over Hoover's activities but of course
Glen Campbell is doing a fine job of
fund-raising over there and I can't im
agine we'd want to replace him. He was
Herbert Hoover's choice you know.
C: It seems to be in the best
interests of Stanford to de-emphasize
inter-collegiate sports.
T: I'm a former athlete myself and I
think I can tell you that it did wonders
for me- the team spirit and all. And
the alumni depend on Big Game.
C: Big Game?

T: A California classic.
C: And what about fraternities and
sororities? Do you have any?
T: Why I'm a Beta myself. We're
quite proud of our residential system.
Why we've even got a coed fraternity
this fall. No sororities though. I never
have understood why President
Trcsiddcr did away with them. I guess
there were too many suicides or some
thing.
C: Does the University have any in
vestments in South Africa and what
exactly is its relationship to the Viet
nam War?
T: Trustees have complete control
of the endowment and investments,
and our object is to make money for
our educational enterprise at highest

interest. You know we're all quite
accomplished businessmen ourselves.
C: Oh, really, what companies do
you represent?
T: You name it—and we all have
plants close by in our Industrial Park.

C: What is Stanford's relationship to
the Stanford Research Institute?
T: We love it. We name its board, it
does a lot of work for our companies,
and it gives Stanford a good name. Ex
cept maybe with the hippie-commie
peace creeps.
C: Well, Stanford certainly is dedi
cated to public service!
T: Why yes, and 22 of our 23 Trust
ees are Republicans.
C: Well
T: Before you make up your mind,
there are a few fringe benefits I forgot.

You get to be on the board of SRI and
membership in the Bohemian club
all belong you know. Also, the new
Cadillac every year. And .. . after may
be two years or so we'll get you on
some lucrative foundations run by the
CIA. Don't you feel like a Stanford
man already?
C: Do students have any voice in
the selection procedure of your new
President?
T: Well, our youngsters are usually
too busy studying.

inter-collegiate sports.
T: I'm a former athlete myself and I
think I can tell you that it did wonders
for me- the team spirit and all. And
the alumni depend on Big Game.
C: Big Game?

T: A California classic.
C: And what about fraternities and
sororities? Do you have any?
T: Why I'm a Beta myself. We're
quite proud of our residential system.
Why we've even got a coed fraternity
this fall. No sororities though. I never
have understood why President
Trcsiddcr did away with them. I guess
there were too many suicides or some
thing.
C: Does the University have any in
vestments in South Africa and what
exactly is its relationship to the Viet
nam War?
T: Trustees have complete control
of the endowment and investments,
and our object is to make money for
our educational enterprise at highest

interest. You know we're all quite
accomplished businessmen ourselves.
C: Oh, really, what companies do
you represent?
T: You name it—and we all have
plants close by in our Industrial Park.

C: What is Stanford's relationship to
the Stanford Research Institute?
T: We love it. We name its board, it
does a lot of work for our companies,
and it gives Stanford a good name. Ex
cept maybe with the hippie-commie
peace creeps.
C: Well, Stanford certainly is dedi
cated to public service!
T: Why yes, and 22 of our 23 Trust
ees are Republicans.
C: Well
T: Before you make up your mind,
there are a few fringe benefits I forgot.

You get to be on the board of SRI and
membership in the Bohemian club
all belong you know. Also, the new
Cadillac every year. And .. . after may
be two years or so we'll get you on
some lucrative foundations run by the
CIA. Don't you feel like a Stanford
man already?
C: Do students have any voice in
the selection procedure of your new
President?
T: Well, our youngsters are usually
too busy studying.

It didn't come as a great shock to
anyone that the Trustees named an act
ing president recently. Many observers
(professional I'residential-guessers)
were mildly shaken and all Lyman-
C'uthbertson bets were called off.
But what's interesting to consider is
why Stanford is having a difficult time
finding a permanent man for the slot.
Let's consider a possible discussion be
tween a trustee and a potential candi
date:
I RUS H I Would you be consid
ered on a short list for the Presidency
of Stanford University?
CANDIDATE: It certainly would be
an honor. Why Stanford certainly
would be attractive. There are a few
things I'd like to know about the Presi
dency.

T: Shoot.
C: As a scholar, I'm somewhat con
cerned about your Hoover Institution.
I am simply unimpressed with the ob
jectivity in its research and its active
political participation.
T: As President, you have control
over Hoover's activities but of course
Glen Campbell is doing a fine job of
fund-raising over there and I can't im
agine we'd want to replace him. He was
Herbert Hoover's choice you know.
C: It seems to be in the best
interests of Stanford to de-emphasize
inter-collegiate sports.
T: I'm a former athlete myself and I
