# Racism Course: Response To BSU
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
I our days after the assassination of
Martin Luther King, members of Stan
lord's Black Student Union (BSU)
took over the microphone from Pro
vost Richard Lyman during an all-day
colloquium on racism and presented
ten demands to the University.
The demands dealt mainly with ad
mitting more minority group students
and hiring more black faculty and
staff. But, as an outgrowth of the con
troversy, curftcular changes have also
been instituted.
The major innovation for this coni
ing academic year is a three-quarter
undergraduate special on Racism and
prejudice, which goes by the full title
of "Racism and Prejudice: An Inter
disciplinary Approach to the Problems
of Minority Groups and the Under
priviledged in Contemporary Society."
About 15 professors will participate
in the course, according to Oliver
Wendell Holmes, history instructor and
one of the two black faculty members
here, who is organizing the program.
Departments represented include
anthropology, political science, his
tory. lav . sociology, education, and
economics.
The course will consist of two lec
tures by the participating faculty and
one seminar led by a graduate TA each
week for the first two quarters, and in
dividual research by selected students
during the last quarter
In the fall, there will also be four or
five field trips to ghetto areas-l ast
Palo Alto, l ast San Jose, and possibly
Oakland so the students "can relate
theory with practice, see what s really
happening." Holmes said.
Holmes expects about 250 students

in the course. More than 150 have al
ready pre registered.
How did the course come about?
After the BSU presented its demands,
Holmes explains, "everyone began to
entertain the notion of giving courses
on black culture and history." The
problem was in finding qualified pro
fessors.
Holmes got the idea on drawing on
the specific knowledge of the pro
fessors already here, establishing a
course to explore a wide range of ques
tions, such as: What docs it mean to
live in a prejudiced society? What is the
psychology and sociology of prejudice?
The course will also consider topics
such as cultural marginality the dif
ficulty that some groups, such as
Cubans and Puerto Ricans, have in ad
justing to American society-and "how
the system perpetuates incquitous
conditions-poverty and how some
groups are subjected to it more than
others due to their cultural and educa
tional background," Holmes said.
He feels such a course is especially
important here because "most of the
kids come from suburban America
especially suburban California," and
have no exposure to the problems of
minority groups.
Future courses may be instituted if
this attempt is successful. The History
Department is presently considering
the establishment of an African Studies
Program, and the creation of an inter
departmental major in African and
Afro-American Studies.
Courses in this major would consist
of some aireatly in existence, such as
Modern Africa Sicne 1850 and Govern
ment and Politics in Africa South of
the Sahara, and new ones, such as
African Civilizations and courses in
Swahili and Hausa.
