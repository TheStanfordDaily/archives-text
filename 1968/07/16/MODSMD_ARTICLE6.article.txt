# The
						Spock Conviction
## 
### 
The eighty-five-year-old judge has spoken.
Last week in Boston U.S. District Judge
Francis J. W. Ford, 85, sentenced Dr. Ben
jamin Spock, 65, and four others to two
year prison terms and fines varying from
nothing for Spock to $5,000 for Yale
Chaplain William Sloane Coffin, Jr., 43, and
author Mitchell Goodman, 44. Harvard grad
student Michael Ferber has to pay a $1,000
fine.
"Where law and order stops, obviously
anarchy begins," the judge intoned.
"Almost every week in this court,"he
said, "young men are sentenced to three
years in prison for evading the draft. It is
reasonable to conclude that these defendants
were instrumental in inciting some of these
men to flout the law."
His reasoning is without flaw. Because
Spock and the others lived and spoke in
America, they must be to blame for some
people following the implications of their
thoughts.
They are at fault. And so is Gandhi.
This whole case is, as a Stanford law pro
fessor told the DAILY when suit was
brought, "damned foolish."
He said he believed that the Justice De
partment would not have brought the case
to the Grand Jury if the President had not
prompted it to do so. And the President
acted, one can speculate, so as to be seen
doing something about protesters.
Conspiracy, the vague and ill-defined
crime of which the four have been con
victed, is called the "prosecutor's darling"
among some of the law because the
crime is merely agreeing to commit a crime.
The conspirators do not have to know

each other, do not, in fact, have to be in
direct communication. All they have to do is
to agree to do something illegal.
The illegal act alleged to have been com
mitted was encouraging young men to fol
low their consciences, to abide by the spirit
of the decisions of the Nuremburg Tribunal
that tried German war criminals after World
War Two. The illegal act was encouraging
men not to go to war.
War-the most inhuman of institutions
was above reproach in the Boston court; law
yers for the four were not allowed to ques
tion the morality of our government's action
in Vietnam.
We find the conduct of this trial and the
subsequent convictions and sentencing to be
the most abominable and open act of fascis
tic chauvinism yet to be committed by the
government. The condemnation of these
men would make it seem that there is no law
higher than the law of the United States of
America.
If there is indeed no such higher law, it
seems to us clear that we are to be forever
doomed to Hubert Humphreys, to Richard I
Nixons, to Vietnams, to dire poverty, to
racism, and to hatred.
The decision in the Spock case is quite
enough to send one packing to Canada or !
Sweden.
We ardently implore the courts of appeal
to be mindful of the viciously arbitrary de-;
cision and of the possibility of the rule of
conscience in the life of a man. Paying atten
tion to higher laws is not something America
has done much of recently.
But if it does not soon, the American
dominion will be as dead as growing num
bers of persons in Vietnam.
