# A 						Conspiracy Of One
## To Register To Vote 
### Dan Snell 
In a fit of patriotic passion last
week I registered to vote for the first
time.
My father and I drove out to a little
laundromat on the edge of town and
entered the sleazy place. Two women
with young children were trying to
fold their laundry, but an older woman
was chatting with them about baseball.
The older woman asked what we
wanted, and my father forthrightly in
dicated my electoral desires. She said
she was Mrs. Davis, and wouldn't we

please come into the back room.
Piles of nuts and bolts and laundry
lay on the tables and chairs there, and
Mrs. Davis had to clear off a couple
chairs for us.
Name?
That was easy enough.
Address.
That was fairly easy too, though
there was some discussion about
whether we were living between Hil
burn and McCulloch or Hilburn and
Fitzwald. But Mrs. Davis allowed as
how she'd sent in a form for my par
ents' re-registration saying it was Fitz
wald, and we'd better say it was

Fitzwald on my registration too.
It was all very easy except when we
got to the question of what party I was
to be registered in. My mind raced on
about how the Democratic party is
about to betray the American dream,
whatever that is.
And I found myself thinking about
the soft-spoken young medical man
who edits the newspaper for the Peace
and Freedom Party. It's his belief that
it would be good for McCarthy to get
elected if at all possible because the im
potence of the Presidency against the
vast bureaucracy would be clearly
shown up.

But there was Mrs. Davis, with what
I was faintly perceiving to be brandy
on her breath, waiting for me to say
something. And I realized she simply
would be unable to cope with the ideal
of registering in the Peace and Free
dom Party.
And so I am a Democrat, for the
moment.
1 walked out into the misty air with
my father, and I was rather sad that
there was no big ceremony surrounding
what I had just done.
The Jews, those people who under
stand ceremony, make the Bar Mitzvah
get up and say to the congregation.

"Now I am a man," when he has com
pleted his training in Jewish culture.
It sounds sort of phony when
those words conic from the mouth of a
thiricen-yciii-old with a high piping
voice.
In my case it cannot really be said
at all. l or being a man means being
involved fully in decision-making pro
cesses of the community. And the de
cisions seem more and more to be
made by faceless bureaucrats and
nameless convention delegates.
But the thing is done. Though I may
wind up voting for Fldridge Cleaver.
Or Pierre Eliot Trudeau.
