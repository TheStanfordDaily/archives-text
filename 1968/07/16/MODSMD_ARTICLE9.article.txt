# New Uses In Geology

l rosion is linked with weathering,
sediment transport, deposition, and
mountain building, to name only a
few, Harbaugh said. None of these can
operate without affecting all others, lie
added.
After completing the isolated
studies they are combined again in a
larger model. Thus a model tor mathe
matical simulation of marine sediment
ation imitates deposition of sediment,
growth of organism communities and
tectonic warping in symbolic three
dimensional space, Harbaugh said.
This computer program prints a ser
ies of maps and cross-sections showing
geologic structures, and geographic dis
tribution of organism communities, for
any number of geologic time incre
ments, he said. In this way it is possible
to observe progressive geologic changes
as they occur.
The effect is analogous to a succes
sion of frames in a movie film; each
frame represents a frozen instant in
time. "Yet the effect, when the film is
projected, simulates continuous move
ment."
The general validity of these models
can be tested by using them to make
predictions and then "checking to sec
how closely the predicted geologic fea
tures accord with those that actually
exist," Harbaugh explained.
A comprehensive geologic "world
model" might be developed in the
coming decades.
Such an overall model could res

pond to any set of assumptions regard
ing the geologic environment and
produce new data of eight hundred
million years of earth history, Har
baugh said.
The computer revolution is sweep
ing fast across Stanford.
Several departments in the School
of Humanities here never used to
dream of using mathematical models
and "computing machines" as
problem-solving tools.
Now they are sending their students
to the Computation Center almost as
often as the School of Engineering.
Geology too has discovered the
power of a machine that is capable of
carrying out more than a million logi
cal and arithmetic operations per
second, said I'rof. John Harbaugh of
Stanford's geology department.
Harbaugh is a pioneer in developing
mathematical models of geologic pro
cesses as complex as marine sedimenta
tion or crustal subsidence and uplift.
Imagine an ancient marine basin,
some hundred million of years ago, for
example, Harbaugh suggests.
A coral reef on the sea floor can
exist only in a certain depth below the
water level. If this is the only compon
ent that influences its existence, depth
of water becomes the determining
factor of life or death, he said.
Create a mathematical model of
marine sedimentation and organism
growth, feed it into a computer, and
run it forward through geologic time,
Harbaugh said.
In 15 minutes' computing time the
effects of several million years on such
a basin can be studied, he stated.
Harbaugh and his co-workers have

started their work only two years ago.
"Mathematical sin.jlation in a com
puter allows us to mimic reality in de
tail, with all of nature's complexity
rathcr than stripping down a
phenomenon to the bare essentials," he
said.
"The new thing is that we do not
try to analyse existing geologic data
but we create new ones."
These new data could serve lor pre
dicting the locations of mineral re
sources which accumulated during sedi
mentary processes such as oil or salt,
he said.
By changing the conditions under
which a symbolic model operates and
looking for pre-deterrnined results, an
cient environments could also be re
constructed, llarbaugh said.
The overwhelmingly complex geo
logic processes can only be simulated
by breaking the large problem into
smaller components.
For example, the settling of sand at
river mouths was studied separately, he
said. Another study examined move
ments of the earth crust.
"In reality no single component can
be isolated from geologic processes as
they occur in nature," he said. A net
work of interaction exists that links all
components together.

dream of using mathematical models
and "computing machines" as
problem-solving tools.
Now they are sending their students
to the Computation Center almost as
often as the School of Engineering.
Geology too has discovered the
power of a machine that is capable of
carrying out more than a million logi
cal and arithmetic operations per
second, said I'rof. John Harbaugh of
Stanford's geology department.
Harbaugh is a pioneer in developing
mathematical models of geologic pro
cesses as complex as marine sedimenta
tion or crustal subsidence and uplift.
Imagine an ancient marine basin,
some hundred million of years ago, for
example, Harbaugh suggests.
A coral reef on the sea floor can
exist only in a certain depth below the
water level. If this is the only compon
ent that influences its existence, depth
of water becomes the determining
factor of life or death, he said.
Create a mathematical model of
marine sedimentation and organism
growth, feed it into a computer, and
run it forward through geologic time,
Harbaugh said.
In 15 minutes' computing time the
effects of several million years on such
a basin can be studied, he stated.
Harbaugh and his co-workers have

started their work only two years ago.
"Mathematical sin.jlation in a com
puter allows us to mimic reality in de
tail, with all of nature's complexity
rathcr than stripping down a
phenomenon to the bare essentials," he
said.
"The new thing is that we do not
try to analyse existing geologic data
but we create new ones."
These new data could serve lor pre
dicting the locations of mineral re
sources which accumulated during sedi
mentary processes such as oil or salt,
he said.
By changing the conditions under
which a symbolic model operates and
looking for pre-deterrnined results, an
cient environments could also be re
constructed, llarbaugh said.
The overwhelmingly complex geo
logic processes can only be simulated
by breaking the large problem into
smaller components.
For example, the settling of sand at
river mouths was studied separately, he
said. Another study examined move
ments of the earth crust.
"In reality no single component can
be isolated from geologic processes as
they occur in nature," he said. A net
work of interaction exists that links all
components together.
l rosion is linked with weathering,
sediment transport, deposition, and
mountain building, to name only a
few, Harbaugh said. None of these can
operate without affecting all others, lie
added.
After completing the isolated
studies they are combined again in a
larger model. Thus a model tor mathe
matical simulation of marine sediment
ation imitates deposition of sediment,
growth of organism communities and
tectonic warping in symbolic three
dimensional space, Harbaugh said.
This computer program prints a ser
ies of maps and cross-sections showing
geologic structures, and geographic dis
tribution of organism communities, for
any number of geologic time incre
ments, he said. In this way it is possible
to observe progressive geologic changes
as they occur.
The effect is analogous to a succes
sion of frames in a movie film; each
frame represents a frozen instant in
time. "Yet the effect, when the film is
projected, simulates continuous move
ment."
The general validity of these models
can be tested by using them to make
predictions and then "checking to sec
how closely the predicted geologic fea
tures accord with those that actually
exist," Harbaugh explained.
A comprehensive geologic "world
model" might be developed in the
coming decades.
Such an overall model could res

pond to any set of assumptions regard
ing the geologic environment and
produce new data of eight hundred
million years of earth history, Har
baugh said.
The computer revolution is sweep
ing fast across Stanford.

of Humanities here never used to
