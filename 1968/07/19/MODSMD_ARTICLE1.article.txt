## Students' Russian Visit Chronicled 
### Williamson Evers 
(Editor's Note: The following article is
by a DAILY reporter in Stanford-in-
Austria who was with James Kratzer and
Larry Watson in Russia before their
arrest earlier this month.)

When Rosemarie Starlinger, the
secretary of Stanford-in-Austria,
knocked on my door at ten o'clock
Wednesday morning, July 10, and told
me I had an interview in ten minutes, 1

knew that Jim Kratzer and Larry
Watson weren't late in coming back
after three-week break because of car
trouble, they were under arrest.
Newspapers had stories of two
American students detained by the
Russians for smuggling anti-Soviet
propaganda supplied by the Chinese
and four valuable icons.
VVe three had driven from Vienna to
Moscow in a ten-year-old, fire-engine
red 2-CV Citroen, whose original

owner had been the Communist Party
of Austria. In Moscow I had split off
and joined my family.
Before separating, the three of us,
together with Mr. Bruce Hazencamp,
Assistant Dean of Stanford's Law
School, visited the Soviet committee
for solidarity with Vietnam, which has
its office on Kropotkin Street in the
same building with the Soviet Peace
Committee.
Political Thought
Kratzer and 1 visited the permanent
representatives of the National Libera
tion Front of South Vietnam and the
embassy of People's China because my
interest is political thought.
When Kratzer and 1 visited the
embassy we drove up in front in the
Citroen, parked, got out, asked the two
Soviet militiamen outside in sign lan
guage if it was all right to go in, and
went in. After we passed through the
left side entrance of the embassy, a
man asked what we wanted. He could
only speak broken French and so he
asked us to wait while he got someone
who could speak English.
He gave us five issues of "Peking Re
view,'" two issues of "China Recon
structs," one issue of "China Pictor
ial." and a phamplct containing the
August 1966 "Decision of the Central
Committee Concerning the Great Pro
letarian Cultural Revolution."
All of these items are readily avail
able in the West; the magazines are for
sale in the drugstore in I residder Union
at Stanford,
Second Visit
Watson, when he heard about the
visit to the embassy, wanted to visit it
himself. He had become slightly
interested in events in China after
meeting some Maoist Austrian stu
dents. who had encouraged him to visit
China's trade mission in Vienna.
Kratzer drove Watson near the em
bassy, then waited in the bright red car
while Watson walked to the embassy.
A police motorcyclist cruised back and
forth five times past the car.
At the gate of the embassy com
pound the Soviet militiaman would not
let Watson enter at first, but did after
he showed him his U.S. passport. In
side, Watson had the same experience
Kratzer and 1 had had on our visit.
Black- M ar ke teers
That night in Gorki Park of Rest and
Culture, Kratzer and Watson were

approached by two black-marketeers.
In the course of the journey we had
met many black-marketeers. In the
pages of "Pravda" such persons are
called "hooligans." A couple we had
talked to and became friends with, but
we had not engaged in any black mar
ket activity. According to Kratzer and
Watson, these two black-marketeers in
Gorki Park had two icons with them in
a briefcase. Kratzer and Watson think
these two might have been police
agents, but they are not sure.
The afternoon of the next day at
the Moscow park of Exhibition of Eco
nomic Achievement of the USSR,
Watson met three students who told
him they wanted to practice English.
He became friends with them. That
evening Watson together with Kratzer
went with them to an informal dinner
party at an apartment.
Book By Ehrlich and Holm
They gave Kratzer and Watson four
icons "as presents," as well as five bio
logy books including a Russian tra: sla
tion of a book by Stanford professors
Erlich and Holm. In their turn, Kratzer
and Watson gave the Russians clothes
and some other items "as presents."
Panel Taken Off
When the red Citroen arrived at the
border at Brest, a customs official had
Kratzer drive to a special investigation
station where Kratzer an,d Watson were
to take all the luggage out of the car
and place it on a table. At the same
time a workman with| a screwdriver
came up to the car ar|d took a door
panel off and took an icon out. Then
more border personnel came and went
through the car more thoroughly.
Although Kratzer and Watson were
questioned about the icons, it soon de
veloped that the main concern of the
Soviet officials was the possibility that
espionage had been committed.
In an apparent violation of the new
Soviet-American consular treaty, the
American embassy was not notified of
the arrest.
Questioned Five Days
In the course of five days of
rogation, tlicy were questioned about
Soviet citizens whom they had visited;
reasons for trips to the Ni l represent
ation, the American embassy, and the
Chinese embassy; items descriptive of
the Soviet Union in Watson's diary; re

tourists and students, players of guitars, and listeners to players ot guitars.

cruiting policies of the CIA and the
Peace Corps; the pro-communist and
anti-communist orientations of Amer
ican students; and the possibility of
some American intelligence activities
being coordinated through the Stan
ford overseas campuses program. They
tried for several days to connect the
two in some way with the American
government.
Kratzer and Watson made several
written confessions and a news confer
ence was videotaped for Soviet tele
vision before they were released on the
afternoon of the tenth.

meeting some Maoist Austrian stu
dents. who had encouraged him to visit
China's trade mission in Vienna.
Kratzer drove Watson near the em
bassy, then waited in the bright red car
while Watson walked to the embassy.
A police motorcyclist cruised back and
forth five times past the car.
At the gate of the embassy com
pound the Soviet militiaman would not
let Watson enter at first, but did after
he showed him his U.S. passport. In
side, Watson had the same experience
Kratzer and 1 had had on our visit.
Black- M ar ke teers
That night in Gorki Park of Rest and
Culture, Kratzer and Watson were

approached by two black-marketeers.
In the course of the journey we had
met many black-marketeers. In the
pages of "Pravda" such persons are
called "hooligans." A couple we had
talked to and became friends with, but
we had not engaged in any black mar
ket activity. According to Kratzer and
Watson, these two black-marketeers in
Gorki Park had two icons with them in
a briefcase. Kratzer and Watson think
these two might have been police
agents, but they are not sure.
The afternoon of the next day at
the Moscow park of Exhibition of Eco
nomic Achievement of the USSR,
Watson met three students who told
him they wanted to practice English.
He became friends with them. That
evening Watson together with Kratzer
went with them to an informal dinner
party at an apartment.
Book By Ehrlich and Holm
They gave Kratzer and Watson four
icons "as presents," as well as five bio
logy books including a Russian tra: sla
tion of a book by Stanford professors
Erlich and Holm. In their turn, Kratzer
and Watson gave the Russians clothes
and some other items "as presents."
Panel Taken Off
When the red Citroen arrived at the
border at Brest, a customs official had
Kratzer drive to a special investigation
station where Kratzer an,d Watson were
to take all the luggage out of the car
and place it on a table. At the same
time a workman with| a screwdriver
came up to the car ar|d took a door
panel off and took an icon out. Then
more border personnel came and went
through the car more thoroughly.
Although Kratzer and Watson were
questioned about the icons, it soon de
veloped that the main concern of the
Soviet officials was the possibility that
espionage had been committed.
In an apparent violation of the new
Soviet-American consular treaty, the
American embassy was not notified of
the arrest.
Questioned Five Days
In the course of five days of
rogation, tlicy were questioned about
Soviet citizens whom they had visited;
reasons for trips to the Ni l represent
ation, the American embassy, and the
Chinese embassy; items descriptive of
the Soviet Union in Watson's diary; re

cruiting policies of the CIA and the
Peace Corps; the pro-communist and
anti-communist orientations of Amer
ican students; and the possibility of
some American intelligence activities
being coordinated through the Stan
ford overseas campuses program. They
tried for several days to connect the
two in some way with the American
government.
Kratzer and Watson made several
written confessions and a news confer
ence was videotaped for Soviet tele
vision before they were released on the
afternoon of the tenth.
(Editor's Note: The following article is

arrest earlier this month.)

When Rosemarie Starlinger, the
secretary of Stanford-in-Austria,
knocked on my door at ten o'clock
Wednesday morning, July 10, and told
me I had an interview in ten minutes, 1

knew that Jim Kratzer and Larry
Watson weren't late in coming back
after three-week break because of car
trouble, they were under arrest.
Newspapers had stories of two
American students detained by the
Russians for smuggling anti-Soviet
propaganda supplied by the Chinese
and four valuable icons.
VVe three had driven from Vienna to
Moscow in a ten-year-old, fire-engine
red 2-CV Citroen, whose original

owner had been the Communist Party
of Austria. In Moscow I had split off
and joined my family.
Before separating, the three of us,
together with Mr. Bruce Hazencamp,
Assistant Dean of Stanford's Law
School, visited the Soviet committee
for solidarity with Vietnam, which has
its office on Kropotkin Street in the
same building with the Soviet Peace
Committee.
Political Thought
Kratzer and 1 visited the permanent
representatives of the National Libera

embassy of People's China because my
interest is political thought.
When Kratzer and 1 visited the
embassy we drove up in front in the
Citroen, parked, got out, asked the two
Soviet militiamen outside in sign lan
guage if it was all right to go in, and
went in. After we passed through the
left side entrance of the embassy, a
man asked what we wanted. He could
only speak broken French and so he
asked us to wait while he got someone
who could speak English.
He gave us five issues of "Peking Re
view,'" two issues of "China Recon
structs," one issue of "China Pictor
ial." and a phamplct containing the
August 1966 "Decision of the Central
Committee Concerning the Great Pro

Soviet-American consular treaty, the
American embassy was not notified of
the arrest.
Questioned Five Days
In the course of five days of
rogation, tlicy were questioned about
Soviet citizens whom they had visited;
reasons for trips to the Ni l represent
ation, the American embassy, and the
Chinese embassy; items descriptive of
the Soviet Union in Watson's diary; re

cruiting policies of the CIA and the
Peace Corps; the pro-communist and
anti-communist orientations of Amer
ican students; and the possibility of
some American intelligence activities
being coordinated through the Stan
ford overseas campuses program. They
tried for several days to connect the
two in some way with the American
government.
Kratzer and Watson made several
written confessions and a news confer
ence was videotaped for Soviet tele
vision before they were released on the
afternoon of the tenth.
(Editor's Note: The following article is
by a DAILY reporter in Stanford-in-
Austria who was with James Kratzer and
Larry Watson in Russia before their
arrest earlier this month.)

When Rosemarie Starlinger, the
secretary of Stanford-in-Austria,
knocked on my door at ten o'clock
Wednesday morning, July 10, and told
me I had an interview in ten minutes, 1

knew that Jim Kratzer and Larry
Watson weren't late in coming back
after three-week break because of car
trouble, they were under arrest.
Newspapers had stories of two
American students detained by the
Russians for smuggling anti-Soviet
propaganda supplied by the Chinese
and four valuable icons.
VVe three had driven from Vienna to
Moscow in a ten-year-old, fire-engine
red 2-CV Citroen, whose original

owner had been the Communist Party
of Austria. In Moscow I had split off
and joined my family.
Before separating, the three of us,
together with Mr. Bruce Hazencamp,
Assistant Dean of Stanford's Law
School, visited the Soviet committee
for solidarity with Vietnam, which has
its office on Kropotkin Street in the
same building with the Soviet Peace
Committee.
Political Thought
Kratzer and 1 visited the permanent
representatives of the National Libera
tion Front of South Vietnam and the
embassy of People's China because my
interest is political thought.
When Kratzer and 1 visited the
embassy we drove up in front in the
Citroen, parked, got out, asked the two
Soviet militiamen outside in sign lan
guage if it was all right to go in, and
went in. After we passed through the
left side entrance of the embassy, a
man asked what we wanted. He could
only speak broken French and so he
asked us to wait while he got someone
who could speak English.
He gave us five issues of "Peking Re
view,'" two issues of "China Recon
structs," one issue of "China Pictor
ial." and a phamplct containing the
August 1966 "Decision of the Central
Committee Concerning the Great Pro
letarian Cultural Revolution."
All of these items are readily avail
able in the West; the magazines are for
sale in the drugstore in I residder Union
at Stanford,
Second Visit
Watson, when he heard about the
visit to the embassy, wanted to visit it
himself. He had become slightly
interested in events in China after
meeting some Maoist Austrian stu
dents. who had encouraged him to visit
China's trade mission in Vienna.
Kratzer drove Watson near the em
bassy, then waited in the bright red car
while Watson walked to the embassy.
A police motorcyclist cruised back and
forth five times past the car.
At the gate of the embassy com
pound the Soviet militiaman would not
let Watson enter at first, but did after
he showed him his U.S. passport. In
side, Watson had the same experience
Kratzer and 1 had had on our visit.
Black- M ar ke teers
That night in Gorki Park of Rest and
Culture, Kratzer and Watson were

approached by two black-marketeers.
In the course of the journey we had
met many black-marketeers. In the
pages of "Pravda" such persons are
called "hooligans." A couple we had
talked to and became friends with, but
we had not engaged in any black mar
ket activity. According to Kratzer and
Watson, these two black-marketeers in
Gorki Park had two icons with them in
a briefcase. Kratzer and Watson think
these two might have been police
agents, but they are not sure.
The afternoon of the next day at
the Moscow park of Exhibition of Eco
nomic Achievement of the USSR,
Watson met three students who told
him they wanted to practice English.
He became friends with them. That
evening Watson together with Kratzer
went with them to an informal dinner
party at an apartment.
Book By Ehrlich and Holm
They gave Kratzer and Watson four
icons "as presents," as well as five bio
logy books including a Russian tra: sla
tion of a book by Stanford professors
Erlich and Holm. In their turn, Kratzer
and Watson gave the Russians clothes
and some other items "as presents."
Panel Taken Off
When the red Citroen arrived at the
border at Brest, a customs official had
Kratzer drive to a special investigation
station where Kratzer an,d Watson were
to take all the luggage out of the car
and place it on a table. At the same
time a workman with| a screwdriver
came up to the car ar|d took a door
panel off and took an icon out. Then
more border personnel came and went
through the car more thoroughly.
Although Kratzer and Watson were
questioned about the icons, it soon de
veloped that the main concern of the
Soviet officials was the possibility that
espionage had been committed.
In an apparent violation of the new
Soviet-American consular treaty, the
American embassy was not notified of
the arrest.
