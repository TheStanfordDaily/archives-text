# Submarine 'Deep Quest' Explores Ocean Floor
## 
### FRIEDRICH ABEL 
This summer, a Stanford doctoral
candidate in marine geology is diving
to the sea floor to do his research work
on the stability of the sea floor for
building purposes.
From the surface support ship
Transquest off the San u'iego coast the
student, Anton Lncterbitzen, is going on
exploration trips down to 8,000 feet
below sea level. He is doing liis cool
research work for Lockheed in the
company's deep ocean submersible
Deep Quest.
The Submersible, 40 feet long and
capable of carrying four persons, is
equipped with search features such as
view-port, lights, television and sonar,
Inderbitzen said. Mechanical manipu
lator arms can pick up rocks from the
ocean bottom, or handle equipment at
subsca marine stations. Small samples
can be taken with push-corers, for later
laboratory analysis, he said.
The great advantages in using sub
ir.arines for sea floor studies are the

ability to see the area one wants to i
study and choose interesting locations 1
for detailed sampling, he said.
The immediate project involves the
survey of an area of the sea door which
appears to be unstable and slumping,-
Inderbitzen saiiL After detailed
mapping of a selected area, cores will
be taken, and the share strength of the I
ocean ground will be measured with !
special devices, he said.
A combination' of these data should
reveal information about the stability
of the sea floor as a matter of
scientific-geologic interest, and of pos
sible present and future applications,
Inderbitzen pointed out.
The most important building criter
ion for offshore diilling rigs, for ex
ample, is the stability of the ocean
ground, he said. Stability is also the
deciding factor for possible future
"cities on the ocean floor," Inder
bitzen said.
