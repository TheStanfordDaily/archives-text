## 'The Odd Couple' 
### JOHN CHATTERTON 
"The Odd Couple" playing in
theatres throughout the Bay Area is
very much a Neil Simon-style film.
Neil Simon wrote a string of suc
cessful Broadway comedies (including
"Two for the Seesaw"), as well as the
stage version of this film, and the
screen play. His forte is New York
bourgeois comedy, only about, if not
of, an income bracket lower than the
one Jean Kerr celebrates. -
This film is about a guy (Jack
Lemmon) who threatens to kill himself
The film really doesn't have its
heart in its "psychology," and can't
make up its mind whether it wants to
be about what makes Jack run or
about his crazy foibles.
In the story Jack Lemmon's wife
divorced him becausc he was a cleanli
ness fiend, and inflicted grave mental
cruelty on her with his compulsively
spotless habits.
He spends most of the film playing
housewife opposite Walter Matthau's
slob bachelor (Matthau puts him up
after the near-suicide), or making furi
ous honking noises in a restaurant

(clearing his sinuses), or spoiling a
chance for a double seduction when he
starts crying on the shoulders of the
two girls.
lhey love it, incidentally, but he is
reminded of his deep emotional in
volvement with his ex-wife-to-be, and
so he goes back to scrubbing the pots
and pans and being compulsively spot
less.
Anyway Walter Matthau soon has
enough of living with Jack Lemmon,
and throws him out. Suddenly
Lemmon hints he may do himself in,
and we realize-surprise! all along there
really was some unity to the film after
all, it was just turned about-face.
We even have the luxury of an am
biguous ending which says either that
(as Jack Lemmon puts it profoundly)
"I am what 1 am," and hence life never
changes and Lemmon-Sisyphus is
doomed to repeat himself, endlessly
threatening suicide and endlessly find
ing new lodgings; or else that, yes,
Lemmon has seen the light, he is in
deed a changed man.
Neither ending makes any differ

ence; the film exists only to provide
space for endless variations on how
you can spoil a good, scruffy, smokey,
smelly, hot, male poker game; or what
happens to six guys playing cards in a
dirty bachelor pad when one of them
puts on an aproO, installs an air
conditioner, provides coasters for the
drinks, ashtrays everywhere, and all the
other conveniences a good poker game
is meant to be an escape from. Not to
mention some innocent double
entendres about the relationship of the
two guys.
Most of the humour gets little high
er than the level of a fraternity putting
on a fashion show in drag, except the
first view of the poker game, when
(what with the misleading advertising
for the film) I began to get the incredu
lous impression that this is a bunch of
faggots.
It isn't, however, and suddenly
they're the same stale crowd of sales
men and sports writers who stick
.around for the laughs in any Neil
Simon comedy. Too bad.
