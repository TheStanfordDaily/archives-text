# Flood Problem

### 
Palo Alto's haunting flood control
problem can be solved permanently for
$1,360,000 worth of downstream
channel improvements to San Francis
quito Creek, a young Stanford civil en
gineer has concluded.
Ever since the crcek overflowed at
Christmas 1955, Palo Altans have been
fretting over it. Previous plans to allay
the flood threat have ranged as high as
$23 million.
But James R. Vincent, now with the
Water Pollution Control Agency in
Washington, D.C., says new informa
tion about the channel and new meth
ods of analysis show that an improved
creek channel would have the capacity
to contain the highest flood crest one
could expect in 100 years.
Vincent made his statements after
an intensive study of the problem and
the solutions proposed for it. They are
all examined in the dissertation written
for his engineer's degree, which was
awarded to him in June.
A key factor in Vincent's research
conclusion is that his study revealed
less channel capacity is required than
was thought previously. Earlier plans
assumed a peak flow of 9,400 cfs
(cubic feet per second); his assumes
7,000 cfs.
