# Federal Aid Supports 'Materials Research'
## 
### Friedrich Abel 
Federal support of research pro
grams within universities, especially if
the money comes from the Defense
Department, has been repeatedly dis
cussed and criticized during the last
months: half the U.S. on-campus
academic research in physical sciences
and engineering is supported by the
Department of Defense (DOD).
However, although "defense" al
ways sounds like "war," much of this
money is spent in basic research and
serves the advancement of science in
general without necessarily having mili
tary applications.
For example, every year the DOD
spends about $75 million in the area
broadly defined as "materials re
search."
At Stanford's Center for Materials
Research almost 50 projects on mater
ials are carried out within twelve differ
ent departments or divisions at
Stanford. "Interdisciplinary" research
includes problems such as the investi
gation of physical properties of crystals
or liquid helium; involved are 54
faculty members and 304 graduate stu
dents from almost all fields of science.
Of these researchers, 31 professors
and 242 graduate students were newly
attracted by the Center's offerings
â– iince its beginning in 1961.
All but three of the 54 faculty

members and most of the students
working on materials related research
are receiving some significant support
from DOD funds or services. A large
portion of the budget goes to new fac
ulty to assist them getting into research
activities.
The DOD spent about $6.2 million
for materials research at Stanford dur
ing the last seven years. Most inter
esting, the DOD's present annual
investment of $1 1/4 million into the
Stanford projects proved to be a very
productive "seed money" attracting
other agencies to invest into materials
research: today only 32 per cent of the
total annual budget, about $4 million,
comes from the DOD.
Among the agencies contributing to
Stanford's program are the Atomic
Energy Commission, the National
Science Foundation and the National
Institutes of Health.
The whole thing started in the late
50's when individuals at high Govern
ment level, at the DOD and the Atomic
Energy Commission, got fed up with
hearing that they could not do what
they wanted because of limitations of
materials. These problems concerned
weapons, space (the after-effects of the
Sputnik in 1956!), and long-range ato
mic energy developments.
Studies showed that there were hot
enough good people being trained in
materials, that scientists were needed
who knew as much about metallurgy as
quantum machanics and chemistry,
and finally that university facilities and
equipment had to be modernized con
siderably to improve the situation.
It was realized that academic de
partments usually were very strong
units, and interdepartmental barriers
massive. In this way physicists, chem
ists, and metallurgists often failed to
cross the traditional boundaries be
tween the sciences to use each others
knowledge.
Therefore, in 1959 the DOD set up
a program for sponsoring additional
university research and graduate train
ing in materials from which progress in
the field as well as a 75 per cent in
crease in the yearly output of Ph.D.'s
in materials should ensue.
Central facilities for such activities
as crystal growth, metallography, elec
tron microscopy, and mass spcctro
graphy should be built to attract
faculty and students from all technical
science departments and create the de
sired interdisciplinary atmosphere.
The competition among universities
to take part in the program was in
tense; as many as 45 academic institu
tions submitted proposals during 1960
and 1961. But only 12 universities
were finally selected.
Stanford was among them.
The University received an equip
ment grant of $85,000. With the con
struction of 35,000 square feet new
research space was begun at the
McCullough building, the costs of which
Stanford was asked to share. Then, by
1965 the laboratories could be occu
pied.
