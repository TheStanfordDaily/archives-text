# Federal Aid Supports 'Materials Research'
## 
### Friedrich Abel 
Federal support of research pro
grams within universities, especially if
the money comes from the Defense
Department, has been repeatedly dis
cussed and criticized during the last
months: half the U.S. on-campus
academic research in physical sciences
and engineering is supported by the
Department of Defense (DOD).
However, although "defense" al
ways sounds like "war," much of this
money is spent in basic research and
serves the advancement of science in
general without necessarily having mili
tary applications.
For example, every year the DOD
spends about $75 million in the area
broadly defined as "materials re
search."
At Stanford's Center for Materials
Research almost 50 projects on mater
ials are carried out within twelve differ
ent departments or divisions at
Stanford. "Interdisciplinary" research
includes problems such as the investi
gation of physical properties of crystals
or liquid helium; involved are 54
faculty members and 304 graduate stu
dents from almost all fields of science.
Of these researchers, 31 professors
and 242 graduate students were newly
attracted by the Center's offerings
■iince its beginning in 1961.
All but three of the 54 faculty

members and most of the students
working on materials related research
are receiving some significant support
from DOD funds or services. A large
portion of the budget goes to new fac
ulty to assist them getting into research
activities.
The DOD spent about $6.2 million
for materials research at Stanford dur
ing the last seven years. Most inter
esting, the DOD's present annual
investment of $1 1/4 million into the
Stanford projects proved to be a very
productive "seed money" attracting
other agencies to invest into materials
research: today only 32 per cent of the
total annual budget, about $4 million,
comes from the DOD.
Among the agencies contributing to
Stanford's program are the Atomic
Energy Commission, the National
Science Foundation and the National
Institutes of Health.
The whole thing started in the late
50's when individuals at high Govern
ment level, at the DOD and the Atomic
Energy Commission, got fed up with
hearing that they could not do what
they wanted because of limitations of
materials. These problems concerned
weapons, space (the after-effects of the
Sputnik in 1956!), and long-range ato
mic energy developments.
Studies showed that there were hot
