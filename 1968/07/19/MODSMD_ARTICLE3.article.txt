# Caught In The Middle.
## The 						Hoover Institution 
### Thomas C Dawson II 
Stanford's Hoover Institution is one
of the favorite targets of many campus
liberals and radicals, who feel its con
tinued existence on the Stanford cam
pus is detrimental to the purpose of a
university.
Attacks on the Institution usually
fall into two categories. It is claimed
that the Hoover Institution is an "act
ive political" organization. The other
attack usually is that the research done
there is "second-rate" and "unobjec
tive."
If one approaches these two charges
with dispassion, and open-mindedness,
much of the controversy surrounding
the Hoover Institution can be settled.
I he Institution was tounaea oy the
late President Hoover with the express
purpose of "proving" the errors of
Communism and Marxism-Leninism.
Such a founding purpose does not lend
itself well to creating an objective,
non-political research body. However,
the ideological idiosyncracies of its
founder should not condemn it for all
time.
The charges that the Institution is
"political" arose in 1964 when its di
rector was an adviser to Sen. Gold
water in the latter's Presidential
campaign. More recently, Richard
Allen of the Hoover staff was ap
pointed to former Vice-President
Nixon's campaign staff.
c ritics ot the Institution usually cite
these appointments as proof of its
"active political participation." Such is
not the case. Dr. Campbell and now
Dr. Allen took leaves of absence from
the University when they assumed
their advisory posts. Dr. Campbell was

on leave for some two months.
Many Stanford professors have be
come very active in political campaigns
this year, but similar c' irges of "active
political participation' are notably ab
sent. While many may view the can
didacy of Sen. McCarthy as a moral
crusade, essentially it is still a political
one. Many noted academicians arc ser
ving as advisers to McCarthy. John
Kenneth Galbraith, for one, is on his
advisory board.
Paul Samuelson, the noted MIT pro
fessor, was an early backer of Sen.
Robert Kennedy. He visited Stanford
last Spring ostensibly to deliver a
speech at the Business School. Well
over half his time on campus and in the
area was spent campaigning for the late
Senator, but no cries were raised about
his "active political participation."
Admittedly, Galbraith and the
others do not work full-time for their
candidate, but the point is that no cries
have been raised as to the impropriety
of such "active political participation."
The second charge leveled at the In
stitution is more difficult for the lay
man to judge. Whether its research is
"objective" is itself something of a
loaded question. Our society definitely
views representative democracy along
the lines of the United States as the
norm. It is easy to expect a similar bias
in a country's institutions.
Anyone who has studied the
Russian educational system will see
there a definite bias towards Marxism-
Leninism, and why not?
The current issue of "NyWsweek"
magazine (not a notably conservative
publication) announces Mr. Allen's

appointment to Nixon's staff in its Per
iscope section and ranks him along
with Zbigniew Brzczinski as an "aca
demic expert on the Kremlin."
The fiftieth anniversary of the
Russian Revolution was marked at
Stanford last Fall with a five-day con
ference on Soviet Russia. Many tele
grams were received acclaiming the
conference and the new Lou Henry
Hoover Building. One of them was
from the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.
The archives of the Institution con
tain one of the most impressive collec
tions of documents on Communism
anywhere. Several Hoover staffers arc
nationally known. Dr. Allen's creden
tials are impressive; he is the author of
several highly acclaimed books on
Russia.
I he Institution also nas on its stall
what many have called its "token liber
al." Theodore Draper, author of
"Abuse of Power," is an impressive
token. "Abuse of Power" is one of the
most sweeping indictments of the
American presence in Vietnam ever
published.
it seems to me that many Stantord
department have biases at least as
strong as the Hoover Institution's. I
find them more appealing than
Hoover's, but they arc still definite
biases. Few "conservatives" can be
found in Stanford's political science,
economics or history departments.
I personally find the predominating
views of the latter three departments
infinitely more agreeable than the
majority view at Hoover, but when we
attack the institution why don't we
retain some perspective?

If one approaches these two charges
with dispassion, and open-mindedness,
much of the controversy surrounding
the Hoover Institution can be settled.
I he Institution was tounaea oy the
late President Hoover with the express
purpose of "proving" the errors of
Communism and Marxism-Leninism.
Such a founding purpose does not lend
itself well to creating an objective,
non-political research body. However,
the ideological idiosyncracies of its
founder should not condemn it for all
time.
The charges that the Institution is
"political" arose in 1964 when its di
rector was an adviser to Sen. Gold
water in the latter's Presidential
campaign. More recently, Richard
Allen of the Hoover staff was ap
pointed to former Vice-President
Nixon's campaign staff.
c ritics ot the Institution usually cite
these appointments as proof of its
"active political participation." Such is
not the case. Dr. Campbell and now
Dr. Allen took leaves of absence from
the University when they assumed
their advisory posts. Dr. Campbell was

on leave for some two months.
Many Stanford professors have be
come very active in political campaigns
this year, but similar c' irges of "active
political participation' are notably ab
sent. While many may view the can
didacy of Sen. McCarthy as a moral
crusade, essentially it is still a political
one. Many noted academicians arc ser
ving as advisers to McCarthy. John
Kenneth Galbraith, for one, is on his
advisory board.
Paul Samuelson, the noted MIT pro
fessor, was an early backer of Sen.
Robert Kennedy. He visited Stanford
last Spring ostensibly to deliver a
speech at the Business School. Well
over half his time on campus and in the
area was spent campaigning for the late
Senator, but no cries were raised about
his "active political participation."
Admittedly, Galbraith and the
others do not work full-time for their
candidate, but the point is that no cries
have been raised as to the impropriety
of such "active political participation."
The second charge leveled at the In
stitution is more difficult for the lay
man to judge. Whether its research is
"objective" is itself something of a
loaded question. Our society definitely
views representative democracy along
the lines of the United States as the
norm. It is easy to expect a similar bias
in a country's institutions.
Anyone who has studied the
Russian educational system will see
there a definite bias towards Marxism-
Leninism, and why not?
The current issue of "NyWsweek"
magazine (not a notably conservative
publication) announces Mr. Allen's

appointment to Nixon's staff in its Per
iscope section and ranks him along
with Zbigniew Brzczinski as an "aca
demic expert on the Kremlin."
The fiftieth anniversary of the
Russian Revolution was marked at
Stanford last Fall with a five-day con
ference on Soviet Russia. Many tele
grams were received acclaiming the
conference and the new Lou Henry
Hoover Building. One of them was
from the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.
The archives of the Institution con
tain one of the most impressive collec
tions of documents on Communism
anywhere. Several Hoover staffers arc
nationally known. Dr. Allen's creden
tials are impressive; he is the author of
several highly acclaimed books on
Russia.
I he Institution also nas on its stall
what many have called its "token liber
al." Theodore Draper, author of
"Abuse of Power," is an impressive
token. "Abuse of Power" is one of the
most sweeping indictments of the
American presence in Vietnam ever
published.
it seems to me that many Stantord
department have biases at least as
strong as the Hoover Institution's. I
find them more appealing than
Hoover's, but they arc still definite
biases. Few "conservatives" can be
found in Stanford's political science,
economics or history departments.
I personally find the predominating
views of the latter three departments
infinitely more agreeable than the
majority view at Hoover, but when we
attack the institution why don't we
retain some perspective?

Stanford's Hoover Institution is one
of the favorite targets of many campus
liberals and radicals, who feel its con
tinued existence on the Stanford cam
pus is detrimental to the purpose of a
university.
Attacks on the Institution usually
fall into two categories. It is claimed
that the Hoover Institution is an "act
ive political" organization. The other
attack usually is that the research done
there is "second-rate" and "unobjec
tive."
