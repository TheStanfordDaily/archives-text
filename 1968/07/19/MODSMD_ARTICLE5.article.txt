# Paul's Church
## 
### 
The Church at Rome could be an immense force for
change in the world. With its far-reaching influence in
Latin America and Europe, its vicar Paul VI and his fellows
could be spelling the end of ignorance and oppression.
But that sort of thing isn't happening. To be sure the
Catholic Church is working as usual in the field of educa
tion.
But the Holy Father persists in getting turned on over
the "proof" that the bones of Saint Peter found in Rome
are indeed the bones of the saint.
But he has allowed the Vatican hierarchy to continue to
be mired down in trivia, to ignore important questions iike
birth control. And he has failed to mobilize his vast organi
zation to turn back the tides of poverty.
