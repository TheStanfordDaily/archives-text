# The

## Hang Huey: Boredom Causes Protest 
### Raymond R. White 
In this day and age there are too
many people who find life so dull and
depressing that they must resort to
loudmouthed protest and sometimes
violence at the slightest "provocation"
to make it interesting. The militancy of
the Black Panther Party and its
irrational supporters is an unfortunate
example of this tendency. Energy
might better be spent in trying to over
come the disparities which these
people decry.
It is my firm belief that if the disad
vantaged of today will seek the educa
tional opportunities which are open to
them at this time they can make very
great strides towards joining the main
stream of American economic life
within a short period of time.
Barring only the person who has
parents or a family which he must sup
port, there is no qualified person
(white or black) who cannot attend
college if he so desires. It takes only a
modicum of ambition and the simple
foresight to see that a college educa
tion inevitably puts one ahead. Loans
for college and part time jobs arc read
ily available.
In California being qualified means
having graduated from high school

The opportunities for education open
to youth today are tremendous. A lit
tle less protesting and a little more
studying are in order if the disadvant
aged are to advance in any sense.
As far as equal opportunity of em
ployment is concerned, the Negro
college graduate is likely to find him
self in demand. For the person willing
and able to stick it out, a higher de
gree, especially in science, is practically
assurance of job security.
The opportunities have not been ex
hausted, but many seemingly frustra
ted people have quite vocally ceased to
try. It seems more exciting and easier
to play games with the Oakland police,
march on Washington, or declaim the

"irrelevancy" of "white" education.
I can see no positive point in unrea
sonably attacking part of our estab
lished society as a matter of habit. Yet
this is the policy and practice of the
Black Panther Party and at least the
new organs of the Peace and Freedom
Party. Any time a Negro is arrested
people devote time, energy, and
money to printed and verbal attacks
which ignore all legal procedures estab
lished to protect the citizen's rights,
not to mention all facts involved.

Svch is the case of the protests over
the arrest and trial of Huey Newton.
John Frey was a policeman, age 23. He
is dead, shot by a man who wounded
another officer at the same time. The
pursuit of justice and the preservation
of law and order upon which human
rights and economic well being depend
necessitate the apprehension and incar
ceration of the killer.
Huey Newton is linked to the killing
more closely than anyone except
officer Frey. His trial for murder so
clearly, so undeniably, demanded by
the facts that only a cretin or a would

be demagogue could remain in opposi
tion.
That it was a Grand Jury composed
of 14 people over the age of 50, 13 of
whom were white, I find to be of little
relevance to this case. The experience
which accrues with age is in my view
not deleterious to the ability to weigh
factual evidence.
Nor is skin color inherently correla
ted to this ability. After 11 postpone
ments it is encouraging to me to see
that Newton has finally come to triaL
The fact that even long term inter
vals of behaving like a moron does not
permanently impair the organic pro

cesses of the brain is the only hopeful
thought that occurs to me in connec
tion with the protests which have so
far occured and which will mar the
trial.
