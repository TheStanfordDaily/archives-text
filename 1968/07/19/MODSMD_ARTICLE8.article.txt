## 'Arson' Editorial Attacked 
### 
Conclusion—Jumping

Editor, The Daily:
Jumping to conclusions is one of
America's favorite pastimes, perhpas the
only one with more participants than
spectators. I was sorry to sec the Stan
ford DAILY editorial "Arson," (July
12, 1968) engaging in it.
The editorial is based on the assump
tion that it was a radical, someone who
conceives of himself as a "guerilla
warrior against the Military-Industrial
Complex," who destroyed President
Sterling s office. But, according to the
DAILY's news columns, there is no evi
dence concerning the identity of the
arsonist. He could have been a dis

gruntled old grad, ticked off by the sit-in
last Spring; it could have been a patriot
who thought there should have been
more fireworks to celebrate the nation's
birthday; it could even have been an
editorial writer who needed a good topic
for a bad editorial, or a tnistce looking
for some insurance returns.
But beyond this, 1 was bothered by
the puerility of the rest of the editorial.
"Love," it states, "is simply the only
tiling that really changes people for any
length of time. And love docs not
happen easily when there is first vio
lence."
I wonder which history books the
writer has been reading. Every great re
volution, political, economic and social,
has been accompanied by large quan
tities of violence and small quantities of
love. So far as I can tell, Robespierre did
not love Louis, Washington did not love
George, Lenin did not love Nic holas,
and Reuther did not love Pord.
Yet each led a revolution of greater
or lesser magnitude. And each produced
lasting change. You may argue abut the
benefits deriving from the actions of
each, but I think it is beyond argument
that the movements these men led did
"really change people." If not their
"human nature," then at least their
social environment. On the other hand, 1
can think of no movement based on love
that has changed people in the mass for
any length of time.

Editor, The Daily:
Now there is apparently little doubt
that the instigators of the recent fire in
President Sterling's office were "guerilla
warriors", by implication, the Stanford
Left, arraigned, judged and sentenced in
I the July 12 issue of the Stanford
i DAILY.
Would it be presumptuous to request
, thai such propagators of ycllowjournal
ism exercise a reasonable degree of re
straint by awaiting the conclusions of
the Stanford and Santa Clara County
fire inspectors on the perpetrators of the
fire before resorting to unilateral politi
cal assasination?
We should be reminded that the
Reichstag fire in Berlin of the 30's was a
result not of the "vanguard of the Revol
ution" but rather of National Socialists
seeking a handy scapegoat to arouse the
German populace to confront the "men

ace". Wc are indeed grateful that the
DAILY has exercised the journalistic
option of labeling this as an "Editorial."

Complex," who destroyed President
Sterling s office. But, according to the
DAILY's news columns, there is no evi
dence concerning the identity of the
arsonist. He could have been a dis

gruntled old grad, ticked off by the sit-in
last Spring; it could have been a patriot
who thought there should have been
more fireworks to celebrate the nation's
birthday; it could even have been an
editorial writer who needed a good topic
for a bad editorial, or a tnistce looking
for some insurance returns.
But beyond this, 1 was bothered by
the puerility of the rest of the editorial.
"Love," it states, "is simply the only
tiling that really changes people for any
length of time. And love docs not
happen easily when there is first vio
lence."
I wonder which history books the
writer has been reading. Every great re
volution, political, economic and social,
has been accompanied by large quan
tities of violence and small quantities of
love. So far as I can tell, Robespierre did
not love Louis, Washington did not love
George, Lenin did not love Nic holas,
and Reuther did not love Pord.
Yet each led a revolution of greater
or lesser magnitude. And each produced
lasting change. You may argue abut the
benefits deriving from the actions of
each, but I think it is beyond argument
that the movements these men led did
"really change people." If not their
"human nature," then at least their
social environment. On the other hand, 1
can think of no movement based on love
that has changed people in the mass for
any length of time.

Editor, The Daily:
Now there is apparently little doubt
that the instigators of the recent fire in
President Sterling's office were "guerilla
warriors", by implication, the Stanford
Left, arraigned, judged and sentenced in
I the July 12 issue of the Stanford
i DAILY.
Would it be presumptuous to request
, thai such propagators of ycllowjournal
ism exercise a reasonable degree of re
straint by awaiting the conclusions of
the Stanford and Santa Clara County
fire inspectors on the perpetrators of the
fire before resorting to unilateral politi
cal assasination?
We should be reminded that the
Reichstag fire in Berlin of the 30's was a
result not of the "vanguard of the Revol
ution" but rather of National Socialists
seeking a handy scapegoat to arouse the
German populace to confront the "men

ace". Wc are indeed grateful that the
DAILY has exercised the journalistic
option of labeling this as an "Editorial."

Editor, The Daily:
Jumping to conclusions is one of
America's favorite pastimes, perhpas the
only one with more participants than
spectators. I was sorry to sec the Stan
ford DAILY editorial "Arson," (July
12, 1968) engaging in it.
The editorial is based on the assump
tion that it was a radical, someone who
conceives of himself as a "guerilla
warrior against the Military-Industrial
Complex," who destroyed President
Sterling s office. But, according to the
DAILY's news columns, there is no evi
dence concerning the identity of the
arsonist. He could have been a dis

gruntled old grad, ticked off by the sit-in
