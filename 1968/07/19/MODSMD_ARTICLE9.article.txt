(I Have A Headache)
Or: I've had it up to here with alumni who persist in
writing poetry when they can't distinguish a line that scans
from a hole in the wall.
It's not ihe message I deplore
Alumni have a penchant for
Longing for days of long ago
and worshipping the status quo.
But sad it is when a Stanford Man
Though highly educated, can
Do such violence to the Stanford Name
As "ashes sadness " and "ill defame."
Heroic couplets do very well
When one can make one's rhythms swell
But he who cannot even rhyme
Should stick to simple prose next time.
