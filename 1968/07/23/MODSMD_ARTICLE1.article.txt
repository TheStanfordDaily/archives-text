# Physics Dept. Stands Out
## 
### Friedrich Abel 
There are several unusual features
that make Stanford's physics depart
ment stand out among comparable
American institutions.
Recently, the American Council of
Education ranked Stanford's physics
faculty among the five top "dist
inguished" university departments in
physics. The physics graduate pro
gram's effectiveness here was called
"extremely attractive," ranking third
in the nation. In 1925 Stanford had
only been thirteenth in this classifica
tion, in 1956 it had been sixth.
Students stand in row to be ac
cepted by the department. Last year
about 400 would-be physisists applied
for graduate study, while only 25 to 35
can be admitted per year; 150 graduate
students are presently enrolled.
Also non-physics majors rate the de
partment high. Several years ago, grad
uating seniors were asked to classify
their lower division courses in terms of
their contribution to the students' gen
eral education: the predominantly lib
eral arts majors ranked physics course
ahead of ail but History of Western
Civilization and World Literature.
Strong Faculty
The answer to the high standing of
the Stanford physics department lies in
a strong faculty and able students, said
Professor Arthur Schawlow, executive
head of the physics department here.
To insure a faculty performing
superior in research and teaching, "we
would rather wait several years for a
good new man if there isn't one avail
able at the time," he said. "It is dif
ficult to build a very good faculty."
These high standards in selecting
new faculty and the lack of more
laboratory space keeps the number of
faculty members at 23 at present. One
professor more would automatically
require six to ten more rooms for
office and labs-"which wouldn't be
available," Schawlow said.
Money Shortage
Because of money shortage, and
therefore space problems, also the
number of graduate students admitted
is strictly limited. In addition, the de
partment could not go beyond a ratio
of about six graduate students for
every professor; one instructor could
not supervise so many students. Many
professors arc already overloaded with
work for governmental advisory panels,
Schawlow said.
In comparison, at MIT the depart
ment of physics has an active faculty
of 50 members, and 250 graduate stu
dents, a ratio of only five students to
one professor.
The Stanford physics group has no

separate center or division working on
the improvement of the teaching of
physics as many universities have,
Schawlow said. In a small department
like this everything is done on a pretty
much informal basis, he added.
Advanced Courses
Intermediate and advanced courses
for undergraduate science majors, some
engineering students, and for graduate
physics majors are much easier to teach
than the basic courses for general edu
cation, Schawlow emphasized.
On one hand, there are technically
oriented students anxious to learn. On
the other hand, there are many stu
dents who frequently take physics be
cause they are required to do so, or
who have yet to be convinced of the
interest or the worth of the subject.
Therefore, top faculty members are
assigned to teach the basic courses to
make elementary physics a living sub
ject, Schawlow said. The basic "21"
course, for example, will be taught by
Schawlow next year.
First-Hand
It also makes a lot of difference if a
professor talks about some aspects of
nuclear physics he has discovered him
self, or he is teaching it second-hand,
Schawlow said. When Professor Robert
Hofstadter, Nobel Laureate 1961 and
faculty member, talks about the
atomic nucleus, students know that
direct experience is communicated to
them, he said.
The infamous Course Review of
May 27 this year reflects the students'
appreciation of this policy by recom
mending most of the senior faculty,
while not recommending many of the
junior faculty.
Not in this context, Schawlow re


QUARTET - A colorful sampler of early 20th century string works will be
emphasized by the renowned Parrcnin String Quartet in its two Stanford
Summer Festival concerts.
The Paris-based string quartet, which has performed internationally as an
ensemble sincc the end of World War II, will present concerts in Dinkclspiel
Auditorium at 8 p.m. July 24 and 26.
The first program will include Alban Berg's Quartet No. 3., Elliott Carter's
Quartet No. 2 and Maurice Ravel's Quartet in F Major.
July 26 the group will play Franz Schulbert's Quartet No. 1, Op. 25, in
E-flat Major, Gabriel Faurc's Quartet, Op. 121, in E minor and Bela Bartok's
Quartet No. 5.
marked that younger faculty often
tend to teach too much. Therefore, the
department head usually discusses
teaching matters and makes suggestions
to newly arriving professors, Schawlow
said.
Relating to this, Schawlow mention
ed there programs that have been
carricd out by divisions working on the
improvement of the teaching of
physics at other universities.
The MIT-group, Schawlow said, de
veloped a physics course for high
school level. "They scared off many
teachers and students, because the
books and experiments were too
tough."
At Harvard, an attempt was made to
develop an easier physics course.
finally, Berkeley tried to upgrade
introductory physics "by throwing out
stuff that is not important, l or ex
ample, their new book leaves out fluids
completely," Schawlow said. "Person
ally, 1 wouldn't like to have hundreds
of medical students leaving my courses
without having heard about fluids," he
added.
Innovating is easy, but you have to
think about it very deeply, Schawlow
said. "1 just don't think that extensive
changes in the teaching methods of
physics are necessary at the moment."
Many physics departments in the
country have their teachers paid from
money provided by agencies, govern
mental or private, sponsoring particular
research projects. Stanford, however,
has its physics teachers being paid by
the University, Schawlow said.
"A research contract requires the
professor to do something for the pro
ject all the time. But we want him to
be able to do nothing if he wantr
to. . .'nothing' in the sense of just sit
ting down and thinking in a quiet
room" he said.
However, the department has no
money ;it all for supporting its own re
search. "We receive money from gov
ernment agencies who usually don't
push us to do special things for them,"
Schawlow said.
"Our purpose here is to advance the
science of physics, and to train the
people who will make big advance
ments in tomorrow's physics to use
this knowledge what physics is really
about," Schawlow concluded.
