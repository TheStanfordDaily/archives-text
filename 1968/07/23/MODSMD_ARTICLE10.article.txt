### Jan Louis 
Is Stanford the placc to be during
the summer? This reporter questioned
10 summer students from different
parts of the country, 8 different
schools, graduates and undergraduates,
male and female, to find out what they
thought of Stanford.
Students interviewed come from all
over the country: Washington, Illinois,
Louisiana, South Dakota, Connecticut,
and California.

Almost everyone interviewed liked
the "ideal weather" and the campus.
"This is a sleepy campus," said one
attractive coed, putting down her an
thropology book, and taking off her
sunglasses, her yellow two-piece bath
ing suit emphasizing her tan. "It's easy
to study, vacation, or meditate," she
said. Stanford's small population is a

dents, she said.
A tall, thin, long-haired student
from an liastern college of 1,200,
offered the other side: "A large college
has many opportunities not available at
my small college," she said.
Students gave ditierent reasons for
coming to Stanford: "I'm here to take
a psych course," said one quiet, in
tense-looking undergrad. "Well," said
another student, this time a female
from Washington in a shocking-pink
miniskirt, "if 1 stayed home for 3
months I'd be going out of my mind."
She came to be hear San Francisco, but
has only been there once.

There was no consensus on the qual
ity of instruction at Stanford. Some
students said courses were stimulating.
But one Stanford undergrad said: "The
professors are boring, but classes are a
heck of a lot easier in the summer."
"The Stanford student is quieter
and more mature," said a South Dak
ota graduate student.
Stanford social life is "slow" ac
