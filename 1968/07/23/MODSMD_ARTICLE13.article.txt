# Warning System To Be Tested
## 
### 
A steady siren blast for one minute, a minute of silence, then a warbling
tone or series of short blasts for another minute. This is the test of emergency
warning equipment at 11:00 a.m. on Friday, July 26. The equipment to be
tested is a part of the nationwide system for warning people of an enemy
attack or other disaster.
