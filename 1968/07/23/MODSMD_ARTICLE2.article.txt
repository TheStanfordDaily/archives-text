# Summer Quarter
## Profile Of Students & Profs 
### HOLLY HOFFMEISTER 
Four thousand four hundred thirty
five students are taking workshops and
courses, varying in length from four
days to ten weeks at Stanford this
quarter.
The 541 undergraduate visitors
come from 186 different campuses all
over the country, though schools most
heavily represented tend to be western
universities and colleges like Berkeley,
San Jose, Santa Barbara, Colorado,
Mills College, and I'oothill College.
Men outnumber women this sum
mer in a ratio of nearly two to one:

2,934 men to 1,501 women.
About 70 per cent of the faculty
this year consist of full-time Stanford
professors. Stanford departments nor
mally extend invitations to noted
scholars at institutions around the
country, some of whom may come
back in later years to teach perman
ently at Stanford.
One such professor is Carl Degler,
former chairman of the history depart
ment at Vassal College who taught
here during a recent summer and will
join the Stanford faculty this fall. Most
professors arc flattered by an invitation
to teach at Stanford during the sum
mer and are further lured by the prom
ise of a 20 per cent increment on their
salaries which all 4th quarter professors
receive here.
Only about 38 per cent of the
courses usually taught at Stanford are
offered during the summer, but E.
Berkeley Tompkins, Director of the
Summer Session, says he hopes to see
more diversified subject matter offered
during summer sessions in the future to
further capitalize on the "experimental
option" which summer work offers.
Tompkins, a lecturer in history, is
also working to get more funds for
summer scholarships in the future. At
the present time, with the exception of
a few heavily endowed programs such
as Latin American Studies and Asian
Languages, most scholarship opportun
ities during the summer arc extremely
limited.
Course loads are generally lighter
during the summer to allow for vaca
tions and recreation. Eighty-five per
cent of the students arc studying for
crcdit on the eight-week quarter. The
other fifteen percent of the student
body includes those on special ten
week programs here that generally have
limited enrollment. Four hundred stu
dents involved in non-campus programs
abroad.
During the regular Stanford year.

course loads normally vary from 13-18
units with 15 being the average for
Stanford students. Summer students
take from 8-16 units, a normal full
time program for undergraduates being
from 12 to 14 units.
Though students unquestionably
take fewer credit units during the sum
mer, acadcmic achievement is usually
high according to Tompkins.

former chairman of the history depart
ment at Vassal College who taught
here during a recent summer and will
join the Stanford faculty this fall. Most
professors arc flattered by an invitation
to teach at Stanford during the sum
mer and are further lured by the prom
ise of a 20 per cent increment on their
salaries which all 4th quarter professors
receive here.
Only about 38 per cent of the
courses usually taught at Stanford are
offered during the summer, but E.
Berkeley Tompkins, Director of the
Summer Session, says he hopes to see
more diversified subject matter offered
during summer sessions in the future to
further capitalize on the "experimental
option" which summer work offers.
Tompkins, a lecturer in history, is
also working to get more funds for
summer scholarships in the future. At
the present time, with the exception of
a few heavily endowed programs such
as Latin American Studies and Asian
Languages, most scholarship opportun
ities during the summer arc extremely
limited.
Course loads are generally lighter
during the summer to allow for vaca
tions and recreation. Eighty-five per
cent of the students arc studying for
crcdit on the eight-week quarter. The
other fifteen percent of the student
body includes those on special ten
week programs here that generally have
limited enrollment. Four hundred stu
dents involved in non-campus programs
abroad.
During the regular Stanford year.

course loads normally vary from 13-18
units with 15 being the average for
Stanford students. Summer students
take from 8-16 units, a normal full
time program for undergraduates being
from 12 to 14 units.
Though students unquestionably
take fewer credit units during the sum
mer, acadcmic achievement is usually
high according to Tompkins.
Four thousand four hundred thirty
five students are taking workshops and
courses, varying in length from four
days to ten weeks at Stanford this
quarter.
The 541 undergraduate visitors
come from 186 different campuses all
over the country, though schools most
heavily represented tend to be western
universities and colleges like Berkeley,
San Jose, Santa Barbara, Colorado,
Mills College, and I'oothill College.
Men outnumber women this sum
mer in a ratio of nearly two to one:

2,934 men to 1,501 women.
About 70 per cent of the faculty
this year consist of full-time Stanford
professors. Stanford departments nor
mally extend invitations to noted
scholars at institutions around the
country, some of whom may come
back in later years to teach perman
ently at Stanford.
One such professor is Carl Degler,
former chairman of the history depart
ment at Vassal College who taught
here during a recent summer and will
join the Stanford faculty this fall. Most
