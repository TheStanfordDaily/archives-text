# Farm Draft Advisers Nix Romantic Notions
## 
### DANIEL SNELL 
Wending their v ways through the
Kafka-esque maze of the Selective Ser
vice System, the two counselors who
make up Stanford's National Service
Office are not happy with the draft.
"It's a generally undesirable sys
tem," William Leland, former head of
Stern Hall said. "I'm not even really
convinced that a draft is necessary; I
really don't have the facts to say."
But Leland and Alan Strain, who
works part of the time with the Central
Committee for Conscientious Object
ors, have facts about specific draft
problems and alternatives.
Strain says he spends much of his
time dispelling romantic ideas about
going to Canada or to prison as alterna
tives to accepting military service.

"Some men think that in prison
they will have lots of time to read,
write, and think," Strain said. "But in
our experience thisjust isn't the way it
turns out."
He said many men who opt for Can
ada find that after some time, their
exile "begins to eat at them." Strain
tries to get men thoroughly to consider
heir decisions, no matter what they
choose to do.
Leland and Strain say they have two
purposes as counselors: 1) to supply
young men with accurate information
about the Selective Service System,
and 2) to raise "the toughest ques
tions" in order to get men to consider
their position and futures.
"We're not pushing any particular
alternative." Strain said. "All we want

is that the young man comcs to a decis
ion that is completely his own, that's
really been considered, that isn't ro
mantic."
Now the most prevalent case
brought to the counselors is that of
graduate students who have recently
been reclassified 1-A because of the
Selective Service Act of 1967 that
denies deferment for graduate study.
"Three-fourths of the men we see now
fall into that category," Strain said.
The counselors explain to such men
their appeal rights and give information
about other deferments that it might
be possible to obtain.
Among the intricacies of the new
law are the ambiguities resulting from
the abolition of the list of deferrable
occupations. Some draft boards are
still using the government list of occu
pations and granting deferments. Others
are granting no deferments for occupa
tions.
. Capricious
"It's up to each board to decide this
question," Leland said. 'There is broad
variation of interpretation of the law
among the boards. The situation is very
capricious and confused."
But the counselors say there are
ways in which they can help men faced
with the possibility of reclassification.
Strain said it is sometimes possible to
check into what the individual draft
board has done in the past as a guide to
helping a man decide what to do.
"but of course you can't always
trust those precedents." Strain said.
Some graduate students may be eli
gible for a I-SC classification which de
fers them through the end of the quar
ter or semester for which they arc reg
istered. ...
Change In Lives
Leland said he believed men tend to
come to see the counselors when there
is a change in their lives, draft status,
or when they get letters from their
draft boards.
Leland sees about 10 men a day for
varying lengths of time, depending on
their problems. Strain, who is on cam
pus Wednesdays and Thrusdays only,
sees from six to eight men daily at
present.
There was a big influx of counselees
at the beginning of this quarter as there
was in January, when the new law be
gan to take effect. Strain saw as many
as 25 men in two days in March and
April.
Strain says the number of men
coming to the Committee on Conscien
tious Objectors has tripled or quad
rupled since January.


THE STANFORD RATIO? Summer Dollies do not enjoy the fringe benefits
of regular Dollies. The ratio of boy to girl undergraduates during the regular
schoolyear is 2.3 to 1-during Summer Quarter it is approximately 3.7 to 2.9.
He points out that the work of the
counselors will probably be heavier in
the future.
failure of present Cl's to reinlist
may boost draft calls to as high as
340,000 this year. This means 75,000
men could be called each monthâ€”twicc
the number called in the month with
the highest draft call this year.
And of these men called last year
only about 5 per cent were college
graduates. Next year this could be as
high as 60 per cent.
Some Objection
Strain, who was himself a con
scientious objector during World War
11, sees men who have "some real ob
jection or opposition to going into the
armed services." Leland, who was de
ferred until he was past the draftable
age, also counsels such men but also
works with others with Selective Ser
vice System problems.
1 he counselors advise that no mat
ter what a man's draft status or plans,
he should keep copies of all corres
pondence with his local board.
"If he is going to cooperate with
Selective Service," Strain said, "he
must meet all deadlines that the local
board sets down. Selective Service is a
huge bureaucracy, and it can easily
loose important correspondence and
sometimes even whole files."
It's also a good idea to go to the
local board and look through one's file
to make sure everything is in order. If a
man cannot go to his local board, he
can delegate to a friend or relative the
power of attorney to inspect his draft
board file.
"One fellow inspected his file and
found someone had mailed a poison
pen letter about him to his board,
telling the board that he should be
drafted," Strain said.
Though nothing can be removed
from a man's file, he is tree to add any

thing he thinks would be useful. "In
the poison-pen case, the fellow got
affidavits testifying to the fact that the
letter's allegations were untrue and that
it was written from an address that
didn't exist." Strain said.
Bogged Down
Leland and Strain think the draft
boards will be bogged down in the vol
ume of work they will have to do to
fill the new higher draft quotas. This
means that registrants have to be espec
ially careful to keep their files in order.
Any Stanford student can make an
appointment with Leland or Strain by
calling 321-2300, extension 2733,
Leland said.

thing he thinks would be useful. "In
the poison-pen case, the fellow got
affidavits testifying to the fact that the
letter's allegations were untrue and that
it was written from an address that
didn't exist." Strain said.
Bogged Down
Leland and Strain think the draft
boards will be bogged down in the vol
ume of work they will have to do to
fill the new higher draft quotas. This
means that registrants have to be espec
ially careful to keep their files in order.
Any Stanford student can make an
appointment with Leland or Strain by
calling 321-2300, extension 2733,
Leland said.
Wending their v ways through the
Kafka-esque maze of the Selective Ser
vice System, the two counselors who
make up Stanford's National Service
Office are not happy with the draft.
"It's a generally undesirable sys
tem," William Leland, former head of
Stern Hall said. "I'm not even really
convinced that a draft is necessary; I
really don't have the facts to say."
But Leland and Alan Strain, who
works part of the time with the Central
Committee for Conscientious Object
ors, have facts about specific draft
problems and alternatives.
Strain says he spends much of his
time dispelling romantic ideas about
going to Canada or to prison as alterna
tives to accepting military service.

"Some men think that in prison
they will have lots of time to read,
write, and think," Strain said. "But in
our experience thisjust isn't the way it
turns out."
He said many men who opt for Can
ada find that after some time, their
exile "begins to eat at them." Strain
tries to get men thoroughly to consider
heir decisions, no matter what they
choose to do.
Leland and Strain say they have two
purposes as counselors: 1) to supply
young men with accurate information
about the Selective Service System,
and 2) to raise "the toughest ques
tions" in order to get men to consider
their position and futures.
"We're not pushing any particular
alternative." Strain said. "All we want

is that the young man comcs to a decis
ion that is completely his own, that's
really been considered, that isn't ro
mantic."
Now the most prevalent case
brought to the counselors is that of
graduate students who have recently
been reclassified 1-A because of the
Selective Service Act of 1967 that
denies deferment for graduate study.
"Three-fourths of the men we see now
fall into that category," Strain said.
The counselors explain to such men
their appeal rights and give information
about other deferments that it might
be possible to obtain.
Among the intricacies of the new
law are the ambiguities resulting from
the abolition of the list of deferrable
occupations. Some draft boards are
still using the government list of occu
pations and granting deferments. Others
are granting no deferments for occupa
tions.
. Capricious
"It's up to each board to decide this
question," Leland said. 'There is broad
variation of interpretation of the law
among the boards. The situation is very
capricious and confused."
But the counselors say there are
ways in which they can help men faced
with the possibility of reclassification.
Strain said it is sometimes possible to
check into what the individual draft
board has done in the past as a guide to
helping a man decide what to do.
"but of course you can't always
trust those precedents." Strain said.
Some graduate students may be eli
gible for a I-SC classification which de
fers them through the end of the quar
ter or semester for which they arc reg
istered. ...
Change In Lives
Leland said he believed men tend to
come to see the counselors when there
is a change in their lives, draft status,
or when they get letters from their
draft boards.
Leland sees about 10 men a day for
varying lengths of time, depending on
their problems. Strain, who is on cam
pus Wednesdays and Thrusdays only,
sees from six to eight men daily at
present.
There was a big influx of counselees
at the beginning of this quarter as there
was in January, when the new law be
gan to take effect. Strain saw as many
as 25 men in two days in March and
April.
Strain says the number of men
coming to the Committee on Conscien
tious Objectors has tripled or quad
rupled since January.


THE STANFORD RATIO? Summer Dollies do not enjoy the fringe benefits
of regular Dollies. The ratio of boy to girl undergraduates during the regular
schoolyear is 2.3 to 1-during Summer Quarter it is approximately 3.7 to 2.9.

counselors will probably be heavier in
the future.
failure of present Cl's to reinlist
may boost draft calls to as high as
340,000 this year. This means 75,000
men could be called each monthâ€”twicc
the number called in the month with

And of these men called last year
only about 5 per cent were college
graduates. Next year this could be as
high as 60 per cent.
Some Objection
Strain, who was himself a con
scientious objector during World War
11, sees men who have "some real ob
jection or opposition to going into the
armed services." Leland, who was de
ferred until he was past the draftable
age, also counsels such men but also
works with others with Selective Ser
vice System problems.
1 he counselors advise that no mat
ter what a man's draft status or plans,
he should keep copies of all corres
pondence with his local board.
"If he is going to cooperate with
Selective Service," Strain said, "he
must meet all deadlines that the local
board sets down. Selective Service is a
huge bureaucracy, and it can easily
loose important correspondence and
sometimes even whole files."
It's also a good idea to go to the
local board and look through one's file
to make sure everything is in order. If a
man cannot go to his local board, he
can delegate to a friend or relative the
power of attorney to inspect his draft
board file.
"One fellow inspected his file and
found someone had mailed a poison
pen letter about him to his board,
telling the board that he should be
drafted," Strain said.
Though nothing can be removed
from a man's file, he is tree to add any

thing he thinks would be useful. "In

board sets down. Selective Service is a
huge bureaucracy, and it can easily
loose important correspondence and
sometimes even whole files."
It's also a good idea to go to the
local board and look through one's file
to make sure everything is in order. If a
man cannot go to his local board, he
can delegate to a friend or relative the
power of attorney to inspect his draft
board file.
"One fellow inspected his file and
found someone had mailed a poison
pen letter about him to his board,
telling the board that he should be
drafted," Strain said.
Though nothing can be removed
from a man's file, he is tree to add any

thing he thinks would be useful. "In
the poison-pen case, the fellow got
affidavits testifying to the fact that the
letter's allegations were untrue and that
it was written from an address that
didn't exist." Strain said.
Bogged Down
Leland and Strain think the draft
boards will be bogged down in the vol
ume of work they will have to do to
fill the new higher draft quotas. This
means that registrants have to be espec
ially careful to keep their files in order.
Any Stanford student can make an
appointment with Leland or Strain by
calling 321-2300, extension 2733,
Leland said.
Wending their v ways through the
Kafka-esque maze of the Selective Ser
vice System, the two counselors who
make up Stanford's National Service
Office are not happy with the draft.
"It's a generally undesirable sys
tem," William Leland, former head of
Stern Hall said. "I'm not even really
convinced that a draft is necessary; I
really don't have the facts to say."
But Leland and Alan Strain, who
works part of the time with the Central
Committee for Conscientious Object
ors, have facts about specific draft
problems and alternatives.
Strain says he spends much of his
time dispelling romantic ideas about
going to Canada or to prison as alterna
tives to accepting military service.

"Some men think that in prison
they will have lots of time to read,
write, and think," Strain said. "But in
our experience thisjust isn't the way it
turns out."
He said many men who opt for Can
ada find that after some time, their
exile "begins to eat at them." Strain
tries to get men thoroughly to consider
heir decisions, no matter what they
choose to do.
Leland and Strain say they have two
purposes as counselors: 1) to supply
young men with accurate information
about the Selective Service System,
and 2) to raise "the toughest ques
tions" in order to get men to consider
their position and futures.
"We're not pushing any particular
alternative." Strain said. "All we want

is that the young man comcs to a decis
ion that is completely his own, that's
really been considered, that isn't ro
mantic."
Now the most prevalent case
brought to the counselors is that of
graduate students who have recently
been reclassified 1-A because of the
Selective Service Act of 1967 that
denies deferment for graduate study.
"Three-fourths of the men we see now
fall into that category," Strain said.
The counselors explain to such men
their appeal rights and give information
about other deferments that it might
be possible to obtain.
Among the intricacies of the new
law are the ambiguities resulting from
the abolition of the list of deferrable
occupations. Some draft boards are
still using the government list of occu
pations and granting deferments. Others
are granting no deferments for occupa
tions.
. Capricious
"It's up to each board to decide this
question," Leland said. 'There is broad
variation of interpretation of the law
among the boards. The situation is very
capricious and confused."
But the counselors say there are
ways in which they can help men faced
with the possibility of reclassification.
Strain said it is sometimes possible to
check into what the individual draft
board has done in the past as a guide to
helping a man decide what to do.
"but of course you can't always
trust those precedents." Strain said.
Some graduate students may be eli
gible for a I-SC classification which de
fers them through the end of the quar
ter or semester for which they arc reg
istered. ...
Change In Lives
Leland said he believed men tend to
come to see the counselors when there
is a change in their lives, draft status,
or when they get letters from their
draft boards.
Leland sees about 10 men a day for
varying lengths of time, depending on
their problems. Strain, who is on cam
pus Wednesdays and Thrusdays only,
sees from six to eight men daily at
present.
There was a big influx of counselees
at the beginning of this quarter as there
was in January, when the new law be
gan to take effect. Strain saw as many
as 25 men in two days in March and
April.
Strain says the number of men
coming to the Committee on Conscien
tious Objectors has tripled or quad
rupled since January.


THE STANFORD RATIO? Summer Dollies do not enjoy the fringe benefits
of regular Dollies. The ratio of boy to girl undergraduates during the regular
schoolyear is 2.3 to 1-during Summer Quarter it is approximately 3.7 to 2.9.
He points out that the work of the
counselors will probably be heavier in
the future.
failure of present Cl's to reinlist
may boost draft calls to as high as
340,000 this year. This means 75,000
men could be called each monthâ€”twicc
the number called in the month with
the highest draft call this year.
And of these men called last year
only about 5 per cent were college
graduates. Next year this could be as
high as 60 per cent.
Some Objection
Strain, who was himself a con
scientious objector during World War
11, sees men who have "some real ob
jection or opposition to going into the
armed services." Leland, who was de
ferred until he was past the draftable
age, also counsels such men but also
works with others with Selective Ser
vice System problems.

ter what a man's draft status or plans,
he should keep copies of all corres
pondence with his local board.
"If he is going to cooperate with
Selective Service," Strain said, "he
must meet all deadlines that the local
board sets down. Selective Service is a
huge bureaucracy, and it can easily
loose important correspondence and
