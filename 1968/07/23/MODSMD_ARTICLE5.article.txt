# The 						Party Unity Myth
## 
### 
Governor Roland Reagan, R-Hometown
America, said recently that Congressman
Paul McCloskey Jr., R-Portola Valley, was
deviating from the Republican party line by
not endorsing heartily the candidacy of Max,
Rafferty for the United States Senate seat.
Rafferty has almost nothing in common
with McCloskey. They disagree on the Viet
nam war, McCloskey being dovish and
Rafferty hawkish. They disagree on the
courts, McCloskey supporting liberal Su
preme Court decisions, Rafferty despising
them.
Yet the men are the same political party.
Party leaders recently showed how dif
ficult it was for them to cope with the real
ity of disagreement within the party when
Republican state chairman James Halley
tried to cover up McCloskey's honesty in ex
pressing his inability to support Rafferty. He
read a letter to members of the San Mateo
Republican Central Committee in which
McCloskey said he hoped for "an across-the
board victory in November."
And Halley tried to show that by this
statement McCloskey was really endorsing
Rafferty too.
But that sort of trite speculation ignores
what is becoming increasingly clear in this
strangest of political years-the parties and

their politics have very little indeed to do
with the problems that concern Americans
and the issues that divide them.
We laud McCloskey's courage in saying
what he bleieves and for having the courage
to ignore the foolish taboos of party unity
that are proving irrelevent to the needs of
the nation.
