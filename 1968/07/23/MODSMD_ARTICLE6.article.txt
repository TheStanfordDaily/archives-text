### 
The trial of Huey Newton how in process
in Oakland has already raised issues that will
be of great import to the courts in the
future. The Oakland judge refused to admit
the relevance of the issues, but Newton's
lawyer, Charles Garry, managed to raise the
question of inequities in jury selection and
of whether white people with "authoritarian
personalities" could justly sit on juries to de
cide the fates of black people.
The outcome of the trial is still in the
balance, and the facts of the case seem as
murkey as the conscience of America. But
the issues Garry raised will recur until the
courts answer them.
