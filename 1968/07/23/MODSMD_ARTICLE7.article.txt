# Caught In The Middle
## Let Students Choose 
### Thomas C Dawson II 
The aftermath of last May's Old
Union sit-in has, 1 fear, put the Stan
ford administration into a complacent
mood. They seem to have written stu
dent power off as a dead concept. This
could not be further from the truth.
In the campus elections held shortly
after the end of the sit-in "moderate"
elements were the clear victors. The
ASSU president was censured for his
actions in the sit-in. The student body
opposed in an overwhelming vote the
use of forcible occupation of university
buildings as a tactic.
Further, the students supported the
free use of university facilities for all
recruiters, thus slapping the CIA-
Encina Hall protestors right in the face.
Finally, Denis Hayes, a "moderate his
tory major," as one newspaper called
him, was elected student body pres
ident.
These developments led administra
tion officials mistakenly to conclude
that they could ignore further demands
of student leaders, confident that the
student body would not rise in revolt.
However, an issue is at hand around
which all students can rally, the meth
od of selection of a new university
president. The ultimate power of selec
tion lies in the hands of the Board ot
Trustees, but apparently recognizing

their weaknesses in this area, the Board
encouraged the formation of a faculty
presidential selection committee.
The acting president. Dr. Glaser, ser
ved on this committee. So far neither
the Board nor the faculty committee
have evidenced any willingness to per
mit students to participate actively in
the selection process.
Denis Hayes, the "moderate history
major." has been trying all summer to
get the faculty committee to admit stu
dents into their deliberations. So far,
there are few signs that his efforts will
be successful.
If, when Stanford reconvenes in the
fall, no progress has been made on this
vital issue, there could well be further
demonstrations on the scale of last
May's.
The faculty and trustees argument
against student participation in the se
lection process is that students arc
"around only four years" and "aren't
acquainted with the qualities necessary
to make a Stanford president."
I cannot imagine a more paternal
istic, tenuous argument. In the first
place, a study of the backgrounds of
the Trustees will not leave you im
pressed with their credentials for selec
ting a university president. A signifi
cant exception is John Gardner, lie is
probably one ot the best qualified men

in the country to make such a selec
tion.
The "only around four years" argu
ment is also fallacious. Students have a
more direct interest in the university
than the Trustees or administration.
After all, for what does a university ex
ist but to educate? The trustees' and
administration's role should be to
handle the business and administrative
affairs of the University in such a way
as to minimize the intrusion on the stu
dents and faculty.
Their role is not to manipulate the
university so as to further their or the
government's interests. Students are
only around four years, but in those
four years they have a much greater
knowledge of the problems, strengths
and weaknesses of the University than
Trustees who meet on campus twie a
year.
The Trustees and others should
stand warned that students arc expect
ing to be consulted over the selection
of the new president. Such consulta
tion docs not consist of being allowed
to submit a list of possible candidates.
It consists of examining the records of
prospective candidates in consultation
with the faculty (and unfortunately,
the Trustees) and voting on the final
choice.
