## A 						Hitchcock Failure 'THE BIRDS' 
### JOHN CHATTERTON 
Last Friday Tresiddcr showed
Hitchcock's "The Birds," complete
with the usual chopped-up print and
famous Tresiddcr "hand-held projec
tion". On the face of it the film was
dull, a Hitchcock failure.
The characters arc subjects of a
rather trite romantic plot, invaded by a
plague of birds who overwhelm a small
town, eating small children. After
much suspense, the hero and heroine
escape for the big city, leaving the
future of the world in doubt.
The film works the wrong way. It
attempts to capture interest by creat
ing supposedly interesting characters -
who do interesting things - so tiiat we
will be worried in a fanciful way when
those characters get in trouble.
That sounds logical, but it isn't. The
characters interested me somewhat;
but it's like getting worried about
Hamlet, and then all of a sudden he
finds a dragon in the liast wing.
When the hero throws a rock at the
bird murderers of his former girlfriend,
the heroine stays his hand, and says,
"It's 110 use." And it isn't. Those birds
are irrelevant to the characters' experi
ence.

So what are they doing there? If the
characters can say, in effect, only
"What are all these goddamn birds
for?" our reaction is unlikely to be
more complex.
So "The Birds'" problem is the
animals. But what kind of idea about
film must Hitchcock have had to create
such a problem? What are his aesthetic
preconceptions?
To make monsters human beings
puts suspense and fear back in the mix,
but creates a mystery film instead - a
genre at which Hitchcock is a master.
Certainly he is hung up on natural
istic drama-on-film, which is all right,
except that the setting turns natural
istic drama into Theatre of the Absurd,
and bad Theatre of the Absurd. As if
the characters in an lonesco play were
to get uptight because they couldn't
understand what was going on, and so
license the audience's doing the same
thing.
Then how to make what used to be
called a "horror film"? To make the
characters participate, as in real Thea
tre of the Absurd, could make a beauti
ful film - and destroy horror in favour
of delight.
Birdhorror doesn't look ridiculous
because of its fakeness; those are real

birds with wings and red eyes. But it
does look ridiculous because Hitchcock
has refrained from examining the act
ion on screen from the audience's (my)
point of view, as with false-looking
process-shots. The birds stay comfort
ably outside the audience's head.
The birds can get inside the head via
the eyes, as they do at only one mom
ent in the film, when the cutting is.
such that we are thrown into a percept
ual quandary - losing our visual bear
ings - Uke the physical quandary of the
woman being madly attacked at that
moment.
It is necessary to make the audience "
create its own horror. The viewer's
mind can be reached by challenging his
perceptual system with visual enigmas
- one neither puts one interpretation
into the film (fake rain) and expects
the viewer to discard it in favour of
another, by logic alone, nor docs one
ignore the logic of the viewer and fill
the screen with Birdhorror, horror the
audience need not believe, it being,
there in abundance, pre-packaged.
The audience must make its own!
decisions about what a film means;
those decisions are what it means; and
enforce themselves not only on the'
film-maker but on the audience too.|
The audience wills itself into the film,
and then cannot escape.
To be explicit. Picture a deserted
house. It is late afternoon. Autumn in
nearby woods.
As we approach, we see birds, like
leaves, covering the ground. We ap
proach more. The windows are broken.
The door is smashed. Bird cries echo in
the sky. A trail of red leads from the
doorway inside the house. We follow.
A bedroom door. We look inside. Feet;
bloody legs. A face with no eyes; thou
sands of birds fly screaming at the cam
era.
Almost a script for one sequence
from"The Birds." But the sequence |
occurs near the end; the suspense is i
useless because we know the riddle'sl
answer. '
As an opening sequence it would be
brilliant. The audience discovers the
bird-murderers but does not make
them murderers until the end of thei
sequence, when it is the audiencc's|
shock at the corpse, together with the
perceptual shock of the animals rush-|
ing - screaming - at the camera, the |
audience's eyes, which provides the'
malice in the birds.
The perceptual rhythm of the audi
ence, its sequence of judgments follow
ing the film sequence, provides the
basis for any liberties the director takes
in shaping his material.
Hitchcock creates Birdhate before
Birdhorror - a bird striking a woman in
a boat. Given malice, the rest is logic,
but the audience laughed because of
the artificiality of adding a million
Birdhates together and expecting audi
ence horror to increase automatically.
All we see is lots of birds.

Perhaps the essence of Horror is im
possible evil; the destruction of the
good and the weak by a blind, enigma
tic and marvellous creature. Mary
Shelley's "Frankenstein" works this
way.
Fvil itself is not created out of mere
malice. To some extent the audience
must hate the evil creature, not for
what it docs to the characters, but for
what it does to the audience by way of
shocking them.
To get this reaction one does not
pile up malice on malice, and expect
the audience to place itself as receivers
of the malice. Hitchcock does this,
through the mediating device of char
acters with some intrinsic interest.
Hitchcock's misuse of Birdhorroj
fits in mind with the other things I
don't like about bad Hitchcock. Fake
"proccss shots" - rear projection to
make a stationary car look as if it is
passing through a city, for instance.
Fake rain. Dummy hills. Extremes of
music.
Every film is a document; if one
sees an obviously faked picture of rain,
one"~does not see "a picture of rain";
one sees a picture of fake rain. And

when the hero and heroine arc plung
ing around madly to escape the rain,
and shouting "It's raining, it's raining"
(and getting wet) and when the rain
sequence occurs in flashback, along
with more real-looking memories --
well, enough said. One does not hang a
plot on such a sequence, as Hitchcock
does in "I Confess" (a beautiful Hitch
cock success, on the whole).
