# Tumors And Tattoo:
## Lasers In Medicine 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Have a tattoo you want removed?
No need for painful, prolonged sur
gery. Use a laser.
What about acute glaucoma or a
retinal detachment? Forget the knife
use a laser.
Need surgery for a tumor of in
skin or in a blood vessel? Don't slice i T
out, destroy it with a laser.
Research into all these medit.J ap
plications of lasers is being don
at Stanford.
Dr. Donald R. Laub, assistant pro
fessor of surgery is studying the use of
lasers in tattoo removal. His work is
"still in the experimental stage," Laub
says, although research in the same
area has progressed somewhat further
at the University of Cincinnati.
The reason the laser works here is
the same reason it is useful in the other
medical areas. Dark areas absorb the
powerful coherent light and are burned
away, while light-colored areas either
reflect the beams or allow them to pass
through, so the laser does not affect
them.
Here, the carbon in the tattoos ab
sorbs the beam from a ruby laser, but

the skin does not. No anesthetic is
needed when this method is used.
Presently, Laub is removing only
small areas of tattoos, and then per
forming a biopsy of the area to check
the results. So far, they have been
Very encouraging."
The problem is with what happens
o the pigment in the tattoo when the
aser hits it. "Does it vaporize? Is there
a change in particle size? Does it go
into the blood?" Laub asks.
Until these questions are answered,
and the safety of the method assured,
Laub will not use the method clini
cally.
He notes that lasers will also remove
freckles-as he found out from a few
accidents.
Dr. H. Christian Zweng, clinical as
sistant professor of surgery and
ophthalmology, has been using lasers in
eye surgery. He uses an argon laser,
which emits green light-absorbed by
the red blood cells.
For example, in diabetics, retinal
blood vessels readily break and bleed,
causing "mammoth hemorrhages into
the eye. Even when the condition is
cleared up, scar tissue is left so the
retina is effectively destroyed."
Zweng uses the laser to destroy
diseased blood vessels, "and hopefully
keep the diabetic retinopathy under
control."
