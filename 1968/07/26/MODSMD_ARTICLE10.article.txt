# Letters To The Editor
## Invitation To Visit SLAC 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford's summer constituency is
to quite some degree transient. This
letter is written to expose summer
Stanfordites to the largest single
research installation in the University
family, the Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center.
For those unable to take the time to
come out and get to know us, let me
describe a little of the history and
nature of the two-mile long machine.
The whole thing started during the
1930's with Stanford Professor William
Hansen's interest in x-ray research.
To obtain high energy x-rays, Pro
fessor Hansen conceived of the tech
nique of accelerating electrons in a
short length of small copper tube and
of using the resultant energy to gener
ate a profuse beam of x-rays. By the
mid-'4o's Stanford realized just such a
device.
From this success, further develop
ment at Stanford followed two paths.
One was to improve and refine the
machines for direct medical research
and therapy. This path led to the medi
cal linear electron accelerators now in
stalled in many large hospitals and
medical research centers.
The other path was toward the de
velopment of larger machines for
physics research; here the high energy
electron beams are probes of the
atom's nucleus. High energy electron
beams lend themselves very well to
such activities.
By directing an electron beam prop
erly at various materials, precise obser
vations and measurements can be made
of nuclear size and structure and
copious amounts of some of the new,
often still mysterious, elementary par
ticles are produced.
A landmark in this basic research
activity was the realization in 1952 of
the Mark 111, a 300-foot-long accelera
tor located in the High Energy Physics
Laboratory on Via Palou, two blocks
west of the Quad and one block north

of the Women's Gym.
For the past sixteen years, Stanford
physicists have been using this long
electron beam in the continuing effort
to dispel the puzzling mysteries of the
make-up of the nucleus. This activity
resulted in Stanford Professor Robert
Hofstadter's sharing of the Nobel Prize
in Physics in 1961. Students partici
pated extensively in the work and sev
eral dozen Ph.D. theses have resulted.
By the mid-'so's, Stanford faculty
members, driven on by the desire for
an even more precise nuclear probe,
conceived of the plan for a two-mile
long electron accelerator as a successor
to the Mark 111. While site selection
was going on and while engineering de
sign was progressing, Stanford turned
to various Federal agencies for finan
cial support.
After a great deal of discussion and
negotiation, the Congress in 1961,
agreed to support this Stanford pro
ject. So much time had lapsed between
Stanford's proposal (1957) and the
1961 Congressional authorization, that
design was far enough along so that
construction could begin almost
immediately.
For two years now, the two-mile
long electron beam has been in use by
University research teams from all over
the country. Many exciting experimen
tal results have been published and
were announced and reported in the
fall of 1967 at international conferen
ces held at Stanford, at Heidelberg,
Germany, and at Herccg Novi, Yugo
slavia.
Many foreign visitors participate in
the work of SLAC, ranging from guests
from Canada to visitors from
Novosibirsk in the Soviet Union.
Currently about fifteen faculty mem
bers and thirty graduate students from
several University departments are dir
ectly involved in the research.
This two-mile instrument for aca
demic research is open to the public.
Visits arc encouraged and guided tours
are offered daily. To arrange a tour, a
phone call to SLAC Information
(854-3300, extension 204, or 8204
from campus phones) is all that is
needed.
I would like to invite all to come
visit this exciting center where man
kind's bewilderment about the basic
nature of his environment is being
gradually diminished.

Fxlitor, The Daily:
Raymond White's column in The
Daily of July 19 ("Hang Huey: Bore
dom Causes Protest") shows incredibly
bad taste, not to mention blindness.
Mr. White seems unaware of every
thing that has ahppened in relation to
civil rights since Little Rock.
He recommends "a little more

studying and a little less protesting" if
Blacks are to get ahead and join "the
mainstream of U. S. economic life."
Mr. Wtyite would seem to be un
aware that such a thing as racial
prejudice exists in this country, that it
takes more than a "modicum of am
bition" and "willingness to stick it
out" to overcome both the handicaps
of a ghetto education and of the
White-encouraged "nigger psychol
ogy."
Mr. White would also seem to be
unaware that sometimes there is a valid
need for protest, that the Black Pan
thers and their "irrational supporters"
are tuned in to a kind of experience
Mr. White has never heard of, and lacks
the concern to find out about.
Has it ever crossed Mr. White's mind
that maybe the Oakland police aren't
quite so noble as lessons in civics
would have us believe? That maybe
middle-aged white jurors in Oakland
will not guarantee a fair trial to a black
from the Oakland ghetto? Who created
the Oakland ghetto, in Mr. White's
opinion?
Mr. Whitc-you are a racist. You
think the Negro should accept racism,
and merely trying to shrug off the
tons of garbage poured on him by
Whites, with nothing at the end of the
line except equality and no regrets.
That the Black must expend ten times
the White effort to maintain equality is
no equality at all, and we all have the
right and duty to protest that fact.

to quite some degree transient. This
letter is written to expose summer
Stanfordites to the largest single
research installation in the University
family, the Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center.
For those unable to take the time to
come out and get to know us, let me
describe a little of the history and
nature of the two-mile long machine.
The whole thing started during the
1930's with Stanford Professor William
Hansen's interest in x-ray research.
To obtain high energy x-rays, Pro
fessor Hansen conceived of the tech
nique of accelerating electrons in a
short length of small copper tube and
of using the resultant energy to gener
ate a profuse beam of x-rays. By the
mid-'4o's Stanford realized just such a
device.
From this success, further develop
ment at Stanford followed two paths.
One was to improve and refine the
machines for direct medical research
and therapy. This path led to the medi
cal linear electron accelerators now in
stalled in many large hospitals and
medical research centers.
The other path was toward the de
velopment of larger machines for
physics research; here the high energy
electron beams are probes of the
atom's nucleus. High energy electron
beams lend themselves very well to
such activities.
By directing an electron beam prop
erly at various materials, precise obser
vations and measurements can be made
of nuclear size and structure and
copious amounts of some of the new,
often still mysterious, elementary par
ticles are produced.
A landmark in this basic research
activity was the realization in 1952 of
the Mark 111, a 300-foot-long accelera
tor located in the High Energy Physics
Laboratory on Via Palou, two blocks
west of the Quad and one block north

of the Women's Gym.
For the past sixteen years, Stanford
physicists have been using this long
electron beam in the continuing effort
to dispel the puzzling mysteries of the
make-up of the nucleus. This activity
resulted in Stanford Professor Robert
Hofstadter's sharing of the Nobel Prize
in Physics in 1961. Students partici
pated extensively in the work and sev
eral dozen Ph.D. theses have resulted.
By the mid-'so's, Stanford faculty
members, driven on by the desire for
an even more precise nuclear probe,
conceived of the plan for a two-mile
long electron accelerator as a successor
to the Mark 111. While site selection
was going on and while engineering de
sign was progressing, Stanford turned
to various Federal agencies for finan
cial support.
After a great deal of discussion and
negotiation, the Congress in 1961,
agreed to support this Stanford pro
ject. So much time had lapsed between
Stanford's proposal (1957) and the
1961 Congressional authorization, that
design was far enough along so that
construction could begin almost
immediately.
For two years now, the two-mile
long electron beam has been in use by
University research teams from all over
the country. Many exciting experimen
tal results have been published and
were announced and reported in the
fall of 1967 at international conferen
ces held at Stanford, at Heidelberg,
Germany, and at Herccg Novi, Yugo
slavia.
Many foreign visitors participate in
the work of SLAC, ranging from guests
from Canada to visitors from
Novosibirsk in the Soviet Union.
Currently about fifteen faculty mem
bers and thirty graduate students from
several University departments are dir
ectly involved in the research.
This two-mile instrument for aca
demic research is open to the public.
Visits arc encouraged and guided tours
are offered daily. To arrange a tour, a
phone call to SLAC Information
(854-3300, extension 204, or 8204
from campus phones) is all that is
needed.
I would like to invite all to come
visit this exciting center where man
kind's bewilderment about the basic
nature of his environment is being
gradually diminished.

Fxlitor, The Daily:
Raymond White's column in The
Daily of July 19 ("Hang Huey: Bore
dom Causes Protest") shows incredibly
bad taste, not to mention blindness.
Mr. White seems unaware of every
thing that has ahppened in relation to
civil rights since Little Rock.
He recommends "a little more

studying and a little less protesting" if
Blacks are to get ahead and join "the
mainstream of U. S. economic life."
Mr. Wtyite would seem to be un
aware that such a thing as racial
prejudice exists in this country, that it
takes more than a "modicum of am
bition" and "willingness to stick it
out" to overcome both the handicaps
of a ghetto education and of the
White-encouraged "nigger psychol
ogy."
Mr. White would also seem to be
unaware that sometimes there is a valid
need for protest, that the Black Pan
thers and their "irrational supporters"
are tuned in to a kind of experience
Mr. White has never heard of, and lacks
the concern to find out about.
Has it ever crossed Mr. White's mind
that maybe the Oakland police aren't
quite so noble as lessons in civics
would have us believe? That maybe
middle-aged white jurors in Oakland
will not guarantee a fair trial to a black
from the Oakland ghetto? Who created
the Oakland ghetto, in Mr. White's
opinion?
Mr. Whitc-you are a racist. You
think the Negro should accept racism,
and merely trying to shrug off the
tons of garbage poured on him by
Whites, with nothing at the end of the
line except equality and no regrets.
That the Black must expend ten times
the White effort to maintain equality is
no equality at all, and we all have the
right and duty to protest that fact.

Stanfordites to the largest single
research installation in the University
family, the Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center.
For those unable to take the time to
come out and get to know us, let me
describe a little of the history and
nature of the two-mile long machine.
The whole thing started during the
1930's with Stanford Professor William
Hansen's interest in x-ray research.
To obtain high energy x-rays, Pro
fessor Hansen conceived of the tech
nique of accelerating electrons in a
short length of small copper tube and
of using the resultant energy to gener
ate a profuse beam of x-rays. By the
mid-'4o's Stanford realized just such a
device.
From this success, further develop
ment at Stanford followed two paths.
One was to improve and refine the
machines for direct medical research
and therapy. This path led to the medi
cal linear electron accelerators now in
stalled in many large hospitals and
medical research centers.
The other path was toward the de
velopment of larger machines for
physics research; here the high energy
electron beams are probes of the
atom's nucleus. High energy electron
beams lend themselves very well to
such activities.
By directing an electron beam prop
erly at various materials, precise obser
vations and measurements can be made
of nuclear size and structure and
copious amounts of some of the new,
often still mysterious, elementary par
ticles are produced.
A landmark in this basic research
activity was the realization in 1952 of
the Mark 111, a 300-foot-long accelera
tor located in the High Energy Physics
Laboratory on Via Palou, two blocks
west of the Quad and one block north

of the Women's Gym.
For the past sixteen years, Stanford
physicists have been using this long
electron beam in the continuing effort
to dispel the puzzling mysteries of the
make-up of the nucleus. This activity
resulted in Stanford Professor Robert
Hofstadter's sharing of the Nobel Prize
in Physics in 1961. Students partici
pated extensively in the work and sev
eral dozen Ph.D. theses have resulted.
By the mid-'so's, Stanford faculty
members, driven on by the desire for
an even more precise nuclear probe,
conceived of the plan for a two-mile
long electron accelerator as a successor
to the Mark 111. While site selection
was going on and while engineering de
sign was progressing, Stanford turned
to various Federal agencies for finan
cial support.
After a great deal of discussion and
negotiation, the Congress in 1961,
agreed to support this Stanford pro
ject. So much time had lapsed between
Stanford's proposal (1957) and the
1961 Congressional authorization, that
design was far enough along so that
construction could begin almost
immediately.
For two years now, the two-mile
long electron beam has been in use by
University research teams from all over
the country. Many exciting experimen
tal results have been published and
were announced and reported in the
fall of 1967 at international conferen
ces held at Stanford, at Heidelberg,
Germany, and at Herccg Novi, Yugo
slavia.
Many foreign visitors participate in
the work of SLAC, ranging from guests
from Canada to visitors from
Novosibirsk in the Soviet Union.
Currently about fifteen faculty mem
bers and thirty graduate students from
several University departments are dir
ectly involved in the research.
This two-mile instrument for aca
demic research is open to the public.
Visits arc encouraged and guided tours
are offered daily. To arrange a tour, a
phone call to SLAC Information
(854-3300, extension 204, or 8204
from campus phones) is all that is
needed.
I would like to invite all to come
visit this exciting center where man
kind's bewilderment about the basic
nature of his environment is being
gradually diminished.

Raymond White's column in The
Daily of July 19 ("Hang Huey: Bore
dom Causes Protest") shows incredibly
bad taste, not to mention blindness.
Mr. White seems unaware of every
thing that has ahppened in relation to
civil rights since Little Rock.
He recommends "a little more

studying and a little less protesting" if
Blacks are to get ahead and join "the
mainstream of U. S. economic life."
Mr. Wtyite would seem to be un
aware that such a thing as racial
prejudice exists in this country, that it
takes more than a "modicum of am
bition" and "willingness to stick it
out" to overcome both the handicaps
of a ghetto education and of the
White-encouraged "nigger psychol
ogy."
Mr. White would also seem to be
unaware that sometimes there is a valid
need for protest, that the Black Pan
thers and their "irrational supporters"
are tuned in to a kind of experience
Mr. White has never heard of, and lacks
the concern to find out about.
Has it ever crossed Mr. White's mind
that maybe the Oakland police aren't
quite so noble as lessons in civics
would have us believe? That maybe
middle-aged white jurors in Oakland
will not guarantee a fair trial to a black
from the Oakland ghetto? Who created
the Oakland ghetto, in Mr. White's
opinion?
Mr. Whitc-you are a racist. You
think the Negro should accept racism,
and merely trying to shrug off the
tons of garbage poured on him by
Whites, with nothing at the end of the
line except equality and no regrets.
That the Black must expend ten times
the White effort to maintain equality is
no equality at all, and we all have the
right and duty to protest that fact.
