# The
						Conservative Case
## The
						Merits Of Literacy Tests 
### Raymond R. White 
Since government by its nature pries
into and controls to some extent the
lives of all the citizens of the country it
is best to invest all intelligent and well
informed citizens with the franchise.
Exclusion of a man from voting is a
serious affair, but so is his inclusion.
Participation in the governmental
processes in this country involves in
direct control over one fourth of the
gross national product of the wealth
iest nation in the world. Whoever has
the right to vote effectively has the
right to determine now one fourth of
your or my income is spent. The
collection and disbursement of over
170 billion dollars is an important mat
ter.
The rhetoric that dominates a cam
paign may seem to ignore budget con
siderations, but the economic aspect is
what really counts to those who pay
the taxes and to those who receive the
government dollar. The taxpayers are
almost everyone (income tax, sales tax,
gas tax, ad nauseum).
The recipients include defense
workers, farmers, land owners, con
struction workers, government employ
ees, students, welfare recipients, and
foreign governments. The voter decides
who is best qualified to decide who

gets how much of whose rightful earn
ings.
So who picks the voter and what are
his qualifications? The average state
residency requirement is 10.2 months,
local requirements being uniformly
less. Other than this there are no re
quirements now in force besides being
of the age of 21 or slightly less.
Some persons are disenfranchised
subsequent to official judgment con
cerning their past actions (felons) or
present condition (the insane). Consid
ering the responsibilities involved, this
is only right.
It is my contention that the respon
sibilities involved warrant at least one
further restriction of the right to vote.
1 feel that literacy in the English langu
age should be a requirement.
Up until the Supreme Court de
cision in 1965 making such laws sup
posedly unconstitutional, there was
literacy tests required by 17 states ot
the Union. These include 5 Southern, 6
Northeastern, and 6 Western states;
New York, California, the first state
admitted to the Union, and the last
(Hawaii); and 36 per cent (72 million)
of the nation's people.
It was 95 years after the passage of
the amcndment(s) used to justify the
decision that the Court discovered that

literacy tests out of existence in order
to aid in the more perfect assimilation
of all citizens into the democratic pro
cess.
If you can find anything in the con
stitution to justify the decision that
literacy tests are unconstitutional then
your imagination or your bias exceeds
mine.
It seems unreasonable to me that
when so many people are educated
enough to make intelligent decisions
illiterates have the same amount of po
litical power as any one else. The fact
that illiterates vote would seem to me
to be the product of an irresponsibly
arranged system.
No person who is unable to read
could possibly understand the com
plexities of the parameters involved in
our vast government. He could not
understand fiscal policy, foreign policy
matters, or the workings of a (still)
capitalistic economy. Without such
understanding one cannot possibly ex
ercise one's right to vote intelligently
or responsibly.
Great concern over education is
warranted by this fact, while it still re
mains that enfranchisement of persons
who can by no stretch of the imagina
tion be expected to understand what
"Ihey are voting for or against is irre

sponsible. Placing one fourth of the '
national product under the influx
of persons who must be objec.i '
judged to be incompetent is not rea
sonable or wise.
These people are the most sus
ceptible to bias, sectional interest, the
influence of demagogues, and just plain
stupidity. A man with no under
standing of the economy is always
more susceptible to the candidate who
promises him the most, no matter how
impossible delivery is or how destruc
tive to the economy the candidate's
plans may be.
Newspaper information is poor at
best, outside reading being a necessity
to allow comprehension of the issues
of any election. T.V. news is admitted
ly (by the networks) not even a substi
tute for the newspaper item. Literacy
is a prerequisite for intelligent exercise
of the franchise and likewise for re
sponsible exercise.
It should be maintained, by consti
tutional amendment if necessary, as a
requirement for voting.
