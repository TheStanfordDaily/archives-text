# Illegitimate Theater
## 
### 
Lvcry I rid ay and Saturday night,
four teachers stroll- onto a tiny stage
upstairs at the Tangent (or New lan
gent, or whatever) |on University
(Avenue. They are the members of the
Illegitimate Theater, a happy and re
laxed group of improvisations actors.
And they are truly an improvKa
tional group two-thirds of the mate
'rial they perform is impromptu, sug
gested by the audience. The spectators,
therefore, arc an important pari of the
show. Not only do they give the actors
ideas, but they even go up and act
I themselves.
All of the four Schultz, Ray Bar
rett, l)e Marcus, and Shirley C'oatcs

arc excellent at making something
from nothing. In one scetic, you may
have Dc and Shirley as the past and
incoming presidents of a PTA, and in
the next Schultz and Barrett as flabby
client and instructor in a health spa.
fhe last scene every night is the
same, and it typifies the group's atti
tude Schultz goes around turning off
the stage lights by swirls of the hand
and feats of prestidigitation. Hut he is
unable to get the last one, no matter
what he does. Then Barrett steps up
and quietly, softly, slowly blows out
the light.
His way is best.
