# Fund Drive Falls Short
## ACT May Close 
### 
The American Conservatory Theatre
(ACT) will be forced to close its doors
unless $104,000 cash in local contri
butions can be raised by Wednesday.
If this amount is not raised by July
31, "ACT will cease to exist...
anywhere . . . ." Mortimer Fleish
hacker, chairman of the sponsoring
California Theatre Foundation,
announced.
The requisite funds are the balance
of a $400,000 annual obligation from
the Bay Area necessary to support
theatre and training programs of ACT.
"The money we must have now is the
remaining portion of our original
fund-raising goal, not an additional
amount," Fleishhacker emphasized.
The California Theatre Foundation
(CTF) began its drive last fall to raise
the $400,000 from local sources to

support ACT, but secured only
$296,000. All present ACT operational
funds have been expended.
ACT is presently negotiating with
the Ford Foundation and other na
tional funding sources for financial
assistance for next season, but these
have been tabled, pending the outcome
of the local fund drive. "The loss of
ACT would not only be a civic disaster,
but a national one," Fleishhacker
noted. 'There is absolutely no other
group providing training and per
formance on this scale. ACT offers so
much more than 'entertainment'. It has
involved itself with the community and
with current affairs of the day, and it
gives us innumerable benefits and
opportunities which will simply stop
existing unless the company survives
here."
The current season, which opened
October 31, 1967 and is scheduled to

run through August 18, offered an un
precedented repertory of 29 different
productions presented in two San
Francisco theatres and in other cities
of California. Managing Director of
ACT William Bushnell estimates that
464,000 people will view ACT pro
ductions this season and that more
than 70,000 northern California stu
dents have attended ACT productions
at discount prices.
ACT attendance figures have re
mained unmatched by other resident
repertory companies in the history of
American theatre.
Fleishhackcr revealed that "commit
ments are very close to being com
pleted for what certainly would be the
most dynamic and stimulating theatre
session ever offered anywhere in this
country."

ACT is presently negotiating with
leading theatrical figures such as
Michael Langham, Artistic Director of
the Stratford, Ontario, Festival
Theatre, and director of last year's
Broadway success, "The Prime of Miss
Jean Brodie"; and Edwin Sherin, co
producing director of Washington's
Arena Stage, who is scheduled to direct
Howard Sackler's drama "The Great
White Mope," on Broadway next sea
son.

ACT is a non-profit foundation with
a dual purpose: to maintain a contin
uing program of advanced professional
training concurrcnt with its rotating
professional repertory program. Amer
ican Conservatory Theatre is the only
U.S. theatre founded on the conserva
tory concept and devoted to research
and development of new actor-training
methods.
