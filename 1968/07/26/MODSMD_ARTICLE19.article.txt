## APA Repertory Company 
### 
Attendance at the Summer Festival
performances of New York's APA
Repertory Company has thus far been
slack. This is unfortunate not only for
the company an«j the festival, the fate
of which is always uncertain, but also
for potential audience members who
are evidently passing up a chance to sec
competent and enjoyable productions
of some infrequently produced plays.
Enjoyable, that is, with the excep
tion of "Exit the King". This wooden
1962 effort by Eugene lonesco fea
tures an everymanish sort of king who
is informed that he is to die at the
play's end. Naturally the king wants
more time. As the "where is the life we
have lost in living' ' motif developed, 1
wished that he had less. In content, the
play is a collection of cliches about fac
ing death. Its situation and gimmicks
are equally wom-a rehash of what we
were given 10-15 years ago in Beckett's
works and those of the early lonesco.
At the close of "Exit the King,"
Queen Marguerite says,"It was a lot of
fuss about nothing." She's right.
If you like the geology corner films,
you ought to take in APA's "Show-
Off," since it is drawn from the same
keg of vintage American kitsch. The
title characters in this 1924 comedy by
George Kelly is vividly depicted with a
horselaugh that would repel a Mongol
horde, by Clayton Corzatte.

Nancy Walker's rendition of the
lengthy role of Mother Fisher, whose
family is invaded by the show-off, is
out of character in its Yiddishruess, but
engaging. The superficial style of acting
in the production aids in minimizing
the tragedies which intervened in the
second act, but prevents our getting a
credible sense of interrelationships in
the family before the final act.
"Pantagleizc" is topically exploit
able because it deals with a revolution
inadvertently instigated by the
imbecile-innocent title character. But
the playwright's armchair-bound toy
ing with the idea of revolution is po-1
tentially insulting-at least to those j
who have come to sec revolution as a
necessity at this point in time. But
"Pantagleizc" is visually exciting, and
should be seen despite its oversimplifi
cations and "poetic" self-indulgence.

Directors Ellis Rabb and John
Houseman have managed to compen
sate for Michel the Ghelderode's short
comings by producing his 1929
"Pantagleize" in a Brechtian, epic
style. The rapid flow of scenes, ex
posed lighting, and stage wall and
achromatic appearance of the pro
duction are so intriguing that they pre
vent the audience's doing the modicum
of thinking which would puncture
Ghelderode's balloon.

were given 10-15 years ago in Beckett's
works and those of the early lonesco.
At the close of "Exit the King,"
Queen Marguerite says,"It was a lot of
fuss about nothing." She's right.
If you like the geology corner films,
you ought to take in APA's "Show-
Off," since it is drawn from the same
keg of vintage American kitsch. The
title characters in this 1924 comedy by
George Kelly is vividly depicted with a
horselaugh that would repel a Mongol
horde, by Clayton Corzatte.

Nancy Walker's rendition of the
lengthy role of Mother Fisher, whose
family is invaded by the show-off, is
out of character in its Yiddishruess, but
engaging. The superficial style of acting
in the production aids in minimizing
the tragedies which intervened in the
second act, but prevents our getting a
credible sense of interrelationships in
the family before the final act.
"Pantagleizc" is topically exploit
able because it deals with a revolution
inadvertently instigated by the
imbecile-innocent title character. But
the playwright's armchair-bound toy
ing with the idea of revolution is po-1
tentially insulting-at least to those j
who have come to sec revolution as a
necessity at this point in time. But
"Pantagleizc" is visually exciting, and
should be seen despite its oversimplifi
cations and "poetic" self-indulgence.

Directors Ellis Rabb and John
Houseman have managed to compen
sate for Michel the Ghelderode's short
comings by producing his 1929
"Pantagleize" in a Brechtian, epic
style. The rapid flow of scenes, ex
posed lighting, and stage wall and
achromatic appearance of the pro
duction are so intriguing that they pre
vent the audience's doing the modicum
of thinking which would puncture
Ghelderode's balloon.
Attendance at the Summer Festival
performances of New York's APA
Repertory Company has thus far been
slack. This is unfortunate not only for
the company an«j the festival, the fate
of which is always uncertain, but also
for potential audience members who
are evidently passing up a chance to sec
competent and enjoyable productions
of some infrequently produced plays.
Enjoyable, that is, with the excep
tion of "Exit the King". This wooden
1962 effort by Eugene lonesco fea
tures an everymanish sort of king who
is informed that he is to die at the
play's end. Naturally the king wants
more time. As the "where is the life we
have lost in living' ' motif developed, 1
wished that he had less. In content, the
play is a collection of cliches about fac
ing death. Its situation and gimmicks
are equally wom-a rehash of what we
were given 10-15 years ago in Beckett's
works and those of the early lonesco.
