CHEATING PROBLEMS-Computation Center manage
ment has installed a plywood wall in front of the bins
where users used to be able to leave their computer pro
grams to be run. The reason for the measure is that people
not authorized to use computer time would copy the
authorizations of programs legitimately left in the bins.

Systems programmer analyst Mark Lieberman says he
envisions that the bins win again be open for use, "but the
unclaimed jobs we now have should indicate the extent of
this sort of 'cheating'." Meanwhile computer users must cue
up to give their problems to center personnel, to make sure
they have authorization to use the magnificent machinery.
