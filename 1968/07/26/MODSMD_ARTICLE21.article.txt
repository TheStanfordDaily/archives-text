# Preservation Hall Jazz Band
## Original Soul 
### Dan Snell 
"These people are very un-Palo Alto," one fellow was heard whispering to
his friend as Billie and DeDe Pierce's Preservation Hall Jazz Band struck up in
the Summer Festival's jazz tent next to Memorial Auditorium.
And indeed they are. The eight New Orleans jazz musicians strolled through
an evening of off-handed excellence before packed crowds last weekend.
And though the little children who skittered around the aisles of the tent
looking for the bathroom were white and not black for the most part, the
scene was pure New Orleans.
Preservation Hall was founded in that city in 1961 — first as a rehearsal hall
and later as a concert place to preserve the traditional jazz style of Louis
Armstrong, King Oliver, and Roll Morton. And the subsequent popu
larity of the effort has led jazz bands from Preservation Hall to make national
tours.
The base of Billie and DeDe Pierce's jazz is Josiah Frazier's inexorable
drums. But from that the band ranges from the ciry strumming of Chester
Zardis' bass violin to the raucus gaiety of the whole ensemble.
The meticulous observer notes that forehead-mopping Jim Robinson's
trombone doesn't always hit the notes it seems to be aiming for, and DeDe
Pierce's Creole dialect is unintelligible.
But the meticulous observer has missed the point of these people. And the
point seems to be that it's damned good fun just being alive and casual.
It would help the audience appreciate the band more, I think, if the Sum
mer Festival people could devise a platform for them that is a yard or two
higher than the one they used last week, since some of those white people
from Palo Alto couldn't see too well.
But they could hear.
And 1 think it helped them appreciate more the easy genius of the black
people in America.
"The Palo Alto Times" said the band had "a rough-hewn elegance." I'd
rather say that these people had soul before anybody else knew that was a
good thing to have.
The Preservation people will be playing tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday
nights at 8:30 and 10:30 in the jazz tent, and it'll do you good to hear them.
