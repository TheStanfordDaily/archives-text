## On Commercialism 
### 
Pauline Kael, the film critic for
"The New Yorker Magazine," was her
self quite a production when she gave
an audience briefing in Cubberley
Auditorium Tuesday.
• Miss Kael hit commercialism in the
movies and deplored movie— who
dote on extravagance in production.

"Some people go to see statues,"
she said, "to be awed by how much the
marble cost."
But the marble is not the point; art
ful films are, she said, "technique
doesn't make art. .. . Art is the ex
pressive use of technique," she said,
and she went on to explain that art was
not something easily defined but only
something felt after long experience.
miss Kael was quick to explain to
the near-capacity audience for the
Summer Festival event that she did not
dislike movies that were good enter
tainment but not good art.
"All art is entertainment," she said
in one of the maxims that studded the
evening, "but not all entertainment is
art."
Since Miss Kael rejects any extrinsic
criteria by which to judge film, she
says she is forced to go back to a
child-like perception of the cinema.
This means, according to the vigorous
little lady who has written for "Life,"
"The New Republic," and "McCall's,"

that "we learn in time not to expect
nore than we normally get but to ex
pect less."
Answering questions after her talk,
Miss Kacl said she always reviews films
after she has seen them just once.
"Films are really quite simple," she
said, commenting that after one view
ing she usually could remember each of
the camera shots in a film.
She told the audience that she dis
liked "The Graduate," because the
filmmaker was trying to get his
audience "to empathize with a simple
ton." "In The Heat Of The Night" she
cited as a valuable film, while "Elvira
Madigan" was "unobjectionable."
In response to a question Miss Kacl
deplored the fact that there are no
creative roles being written in films for
women.
Speaking of the motivation of the
hero of the Czech film "Closely
Watched Trains," she said, "1 don't
think he had enough sex drive to slash
his wrists."
