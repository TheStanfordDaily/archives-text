## Free Huey: Humanity Causes Protest 
### JANE FRANKLIN 
If Raymond White, who wrote
"Hang Huey: Boredom Causes Pro
test," really believes that people's out
rage comes out of boredom, then I can
only hope that from his obvious state
of extreme apathy-that is, not suffer
ing-he is capable of awakening to
normal feelings for his fellow human
beings, his brothers, himself.
Can White summon enough
empathy-that is, in suffering -to
understand that Huey Newton was not
born from his mother's womb a full
grown Black Panther, that Hucy's

coming to manhood in the Oakland
ghetto gives Huey an understanding of
the police presence there that White is
not privileged to have? Can White use
the human power to imaginatively
project his own consciousness into
another human being?
I do not like to sound as if I'm
trying to teach the ABC's to one who's
already claiming to be "qualified" for
that "college education (that) inevi
tably puts one ahead," but I would like
to pose some questions that might
arouse our dormant White.
In Richmond just a few weeks ago

Black people rioted after a White
policeman shot and critically wounded
a 15-year-old Black who the White
policeman says he thought had stolen a
car. It turned out later that the car had
not been stolen. But let us suppose, for
the sake of our inquiry, that it had.
Suppose a J 5-year-old White had stolen
a car for a joy ride (it docs happen,
right, White?) and a Black policeman
had shot him in a White community.
Now, White, imagine that the
Whites in that White community would
think (and do) about that Black cop.
Now, getting ever closcr to reality,
imagine that the White boy had not
even stolen that car but that the Black
pig had shot that boy on the streets of
the White community. What do you
think would happen. White?
Now imagine, White, creatively
imagine that this "incident" were not
an isolated incident, that many Whites
arc shot, sometimes shot to death.

every year in White communities by
Blacks armed with the guns of a Black
government and ordered to keep the
White community under control.
Imagine how those Whites would feel
and what they might do after years and
years and years and years and years
and years (are you bored, White?) of
those Black pigs coming into their
White neighborhoods and shooting and
killing their White brothers.
Now, White, with a supreme effort
of your imagination, imagine that you
are an intelligent, thoughtful White
who loves his people as himself. Seeing
everyday the brutalization of your
White brothers, you become more and
more determined to do something
about it. You study hard, you talk,
you argue, you refine your arguments
and beliefs through experience and
reason, through practice and theory,
and finally you draw up a legal pro
gram in order to teach your White

brothers what "they ean do to proteet
their rights against the Black occupying
force.
You and some of your brothers
create a White Whale Party for Self-
Defense, stressing the importance of
Whites' learning what their rights are
and defending those rights. But do you
expect. White, that those people with
the money and the guns are going to
like that idea?
If every White man decided that he
should be sharing equally the Big
Businessmen's world, then where
would the Big Businesshogs get their
super profits? White, they can't afford
to let you go around spreading subver
sive ideas about equality, brotherhood,
justice. What do you think they are
going to do about you? What have they
always done when you get unpity?
One night two Black pigs stop your
car and order you out of it. It is dark,
White. You recognize those two Black
pigs as two with the worst reputations
among the Whites. Do you think those
Black pigs arc going to pat you on the
back and give you a citation for
bravery, White?
Now imagine, White, that you are
not a coward, that you are a great man
who believes with all his soul that
people have a precious right to life,

liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
That whenever any form of govern
ment becomes destructive of these
ends, it is the right of the people to
alter or to abolish it and to institute
new government, laying its foundation
on such principles, and organizing its
powers in such form, as to them shall
seem most likely to effect their safety
and happiness. What do you do, White?
What do you do, Man? FREE HUEY!
