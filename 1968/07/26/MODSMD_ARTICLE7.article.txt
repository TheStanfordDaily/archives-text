# The 						Nebbish Speaks
## National Racism Test 
### Marshall Schwartz 
You all should remember the short
lived television craze of about a year
ago, the National Whatever Test, the
most famous of which was the
National Driving Test (you know-the
one which the teenagers passed and the
parents failed).
CBS started the whole thing, and
NBC wasted no time jumping in. For a
while, people were haunted by the
sight of Harry Reasoner and Frank
McGee uncovering the profound ig
norance of the American public.
Of course, these things dealt with
subjects that were not exactly vital.
Things like driving, health, safety, and
Vietnam. They never got down to a
really substantive topic-like racism.
This lacking has been long over
looked. But no longer. Now members
of the Stanford community can dis
cover if they are the liberals they say
they are, or whether, underneath all
the profound platitudes, they really are
bigots.

This test, naturally, is for whites
only. There is a companion exam for
blacks to determine if they are actually
Uncle Toms.
