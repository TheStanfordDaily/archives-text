poration which some Con
gressmen and many business
men are taking to heart in

President Johnson's Com
mission on Postal Organiza
tion will not necessarily solve
the problems that plague the
postal system.
In that the proposed
system would get the mails
away from the fiddling of the
Congress, it is to be desired.
But it is -our belief that a
revision of the mailing
charges for third and fourth
class mail could long ago
have put the post office on a
pay— as — you —mail basis.
Now the big mailers of trash
mail get the discounts, and
the first and second class
mailers take it in the pocket
book.
