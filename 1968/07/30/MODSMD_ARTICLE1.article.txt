# Student Quest For Power: Want Say In Pres. Selection

Hayes' quest for more student voice in
the selection of the new permanent
president for Stanford is making only
minimal progress.
Hayes, in a letter to Law Professor
William Baxter, who chairs the faculty
presidential search committee, admit
ted June 26, 'The faculty, with its
wider range of knowledgeable contacts,
is obviously in a stronger position to
suggest potential candidates, and to
carry out many of the facets of such an
investigation."
But he said students would be able
to judge if the possible candidates has
an authoritarian personality or has
shown "grace under pressure."
Hayes asked for a student review of
all candidates under serious consider
ation. In the same letter he recom
mended four nationally prominent
men for the Presidency of Stanford.
Baxter wrote back to Hayes July 5
and asked students to do research and
prepare a dossier on each of those that
Hayes had recommended for the presi
dency.
"I propose this alternative because
it seems to go at least part way toward
meeting the more general request
which you make for greater student

participation in the process of selec
tion," Baxter wrote.
And he balked at general student
review because that would involve dis
closure of confidences from people
who have been interviewed by Baxter's
committee. He also said he thought
that to tell students what candidates
were being given serious consideration
by the Trustees was a violation of their
confidence.

Baxter wrote Hayes, "You greatly
overestimate, in my view, the extent to
which the criteria of the several con
situencies diverge."
Hayes replied that students were
not "keenly enthusiastic" about the re
searching role of the faculty com
mittee. But he said students would
soon have dossiers ready on several
men as their choices for president and
would be wanting to meet with the
faculty committee soon.
