## Conversation With A LOL 
### Doug Taber 
She's 85 years old-going to be 86
next month-and still very much alive
and part of the world. She was born in
Boston and has traveled all over the
world, buried three husbands, and not
changed an inch since her early years in
Philadelphia in the 1890's.
She's neither deaf nor senile, though
she can't get around as well as she
could before she fell down three years
ago. She is quite old, though, and alone
most of the time, and she'll talk your
arm off if you give her half a chance.
A strange world it is she lives in ...
They've passed a law-aren't going
to let any more young men into
Canada-not enough money for the
ones that're already there. They're
going to bring the other ones back.
Nixon-Nixon's the one. He's going
to end this war right away, and bring

the boys back here where they belong.
Niggers up in Oakland making all
the trouble. They should never have
been allowed to come North. Down
South's where they belong. They're
not white people-the government
could have told them to stay where
they were, and they'd have had to.
It's the ones just come over from
Africa that arc making all the trouble
-you can tell them because they've all
got bushy hair, not like Americans.
The best thing they could do up in
Oakland is put all the Niggers up
against a wall and shoot them.

We don't have any of them Niggers
over here. Over on the other side of El
Camino is where the Niggertown is.
Nobody over here will sell to them,
and a good thing too. They'd just make
trouble if they ever got over here.
Don't know what the world's com
ing to, what with all these killings.
Doesn't look like anyone's dying a
natural death anymore. It's the Hippies
who're causing all the trouble-the
Hippies and the Niggers, they're the
same. No respect for the law anymore.
They'll fix them, though. They're
bringing in police from all over the

state-sending their toughest police up
to Oakland. I'd like to see the Hippies
try and start some trouble now. They'll
be cleaned up in a hurry.

There you are-that's what your girls
are like up at Stanford. You better
watch out for them. Those girls—l
know what their kind are after.
And so it goes. She watches tele
vision, reads the paper, and votes. And
there are millions like her all over the
country.

Oakland is put all the Niggers up
against a wall and shoot them.

We don't have any of them Niggers
over here. Over on the other side of El
Camino is where the Niggertown is.
Nobody over here will sell to them,
and a good thing too. They'd just make
trouble if they ever got over here.
Don't know what the world's com
ing to, what with all these killings.
Doesn't look like anyone's dying a
natural death anymore. It's the Hippies
who're causing all the trouble-the
Hippies and the Niggers, they're the
same. No respect for the law anymore.
They'll fix them, though. They're
bringing in police from all over the

state-sending their toughest police up
to Oakland. I'd like to see the Hippies
try and start some trouble now. They'll
be cleaned up in a hurry.

There you are-that's what your girls
are like up at Stanford. You better
watch out for them. Those girls—l
know what their kind are after.
And so it goes. She watches tele
vision, reads the paper, and votes. And
there are millions like her all over the
country.
She's 85 years old-going to be 86
next month-and still very much alive
and part of the world. She was born in
Boston and has traveled all over the
world, buried three husbands, and not
changed an inch since her early years in
Philadelphia in the 1890's.
She's neither deaf nor senile, though
she can't get around as well as she
could before she fell down three years
ago. She is quite old, though, and alone
most of the time, and she'll talk your
arm off if you give her half a chance.
A strange world it is she lives in ...
They've passed a law-aren't going
to let any more young men into
Canada-not enough money for the
ones that're already there. They're
going to bring the other ones back.
Nixon-Nixon's the one. He's going
to end this war right away, and bring

the boys back here where they belong.
Niggers up in Oakland making all
the trouble. They should never have
been allowed to come North. Down
South's where they belong. They're
not white people-the government
could have told them to stay where
they were, and they'd have had to.
It's the ones just come over from
Africa that arc making all the trouble
-you can tell them because they've all
got bushy hair, not like Americans.
The best thing they could do up in
Oakland is put all the Niggers up
against a wall and shoot them.
