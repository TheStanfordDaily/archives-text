## 'Perspective' On Hoover 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In his refreshingly fair-minded col
umn of July 19, Thomas Dawson
writes that the Hoover Institution "was
founded by the late President Hoover
with the express purpc eot "proving'
the errors of Communism and
Marxism-Leninism."
The Institution will be 50 years old
in 1969. No one in 1919 was quite so
prescient as to found an academic
enterprise upon the exposure of a doc
trine which had yet to consolidate its
hold upon a single state.
Instead, the burning questions had
to do with the causes and effects of the
"Great War" ceremonially concluded
at Versailles. These, too, were the prin
cipal concerns of Herbert Hoover as he
advised Woodrow Wilson and guided
U.S. war relief efforts. They are recor
ded in his correspondence with Prof.
E.D. Adams of the Stanford History
Department, which led to the establish
ment of what was first called simply
the War Collection.

At the dedication of the Hoover
Tower in June of 1941, the former
President framed the hopes of World
War I's aftermath and the fears of
World War 11's prelude when he declar
ed:
"The purpose of this institution is
to promote peace. Its records stand as
a challenge' to those who promote war.
They should attract those who search
for peace."
Mr. Dawson is 40 years off in alleg
ing a connection between President
Hoover's attitude toward totalitarian
ism of all hues and the work of the
Institution. It was in 1960, not 1919,
that much of this controversy bubbled
to the surface. Its fumes linger on.
Mr. Hoover's statement about the
"doctrines of Karl Marx" was in a reso
lution adopted by the Board of
Trustees in May of 1959, upon the
recommendation of President Sterling
and certain Trustees. In retrospect, it is
interesting to note the similarity bet
ween the Hoover statement and the
terms of the bequest to Stanford by
William Robertson Coc. Presently there
arc Coe Professorships in the History
and English Departments.
Income from the Coe endowment,
stated the donor's will, was to be used
to "establish and maintain a Program
of American Studies designed as a posi
tive and affirmative method of meeting
the threat of Communism, Socialism,

Collectivism, Totalitarianism and other
Ideologies opposed to the preservation
of our System of Free Enterprise ... "
In an effort to clear the air, Director
Glenn Campbell included in his princi
pal talk at the dedication of the Lou
Henry Hoover Building last October
these remarks:
"With the military defeat (in World
War II) of this cluster of expansionist
and ideological powers, and with the
emergence of Communism as a major
threat to the free world, it was only
logical that the Institution should
come to devote a substantial share of
its resources to the study of this
powerful doctrine, both in theory and
action.
"Tliis facet of study, it was always
agreed, must be objective and balan
ced. But it cannot mean that the his
torical record, however unpfeasant it
may seem, can be altered or ignored to
suit the needs or the whims of the
time. Objectivity is not damaged by
faithful dedication to the facts; it is,
however, severely damaged by any
form of intellectual or literary revision
ism."
Mr. Dawson is to be commended for
the closing suggestion to his readers:
"(W)hy don't we retain some perspect
ive?"
