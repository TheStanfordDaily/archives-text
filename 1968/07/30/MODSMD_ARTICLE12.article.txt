# Stanford Prof
## Track Star Wins Medals 
### 
Accompanied by an impressively
enthusiastic entourage of family, fans,
and coaches, Stanford University
Professor of French and Linguistics,
Alphonse Juilland, 45, traveled to San
Diego to win three medals in the first
annual U. S. Masters Track and Field
Championships, held on July 19 and
20.
After a grueling first day, in which
the professor astounded the highly
confident southern California favorites
by coining through heats and semi
-finals to take a third place bronze
medal in the final of the 100-yard dash
with a time of 11.2, he moved into the
second day of strenuous competition,
and surprised even himself by making
the finals in thy 220, where he carried
off another medal for a sixth place in
26.1.

Although exhausted, Professor
Juilland's greatest surprise triumph was
yet to come, in the dramatic 440-yard
relay, which closed the two day com
petition.
The Stanford rooting section was
pessimistic since the team had lost two
of its star sprinters, including former
Olympic great George Rhoden, inacti
vated by a pulled muscle. Composed of
two sprinters-the professor and
Commander Louis Fields of Alameda,
and two middle distance men, William
Mackey of West Valley Track Club,

and Freeman Marr from Tennessee, the
professor's team faced the seemingly
unbeatable competition of southern
California's best and heavily favored
sprinters.
However, thanks to the expert
coaching of John Duncan and Cana
dian hurdles champ Bill Gairdner,
superior baton passing technique gave
an edge to the northerners, and after a
hair-raising final sprint, Professor
Juilland carried the baton victoriously
over the finish line in an astoundinp
upset.
