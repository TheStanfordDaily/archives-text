# Suspension 'Inappropriate'
## 
### 
The recommendation by the resi
dent assistant at Beta Chi last week
that the Delta Tau Delta fraternity be
suspended from the campus was
termed "inappropriate" by John
Hansor, assistant dean of students.
The recommendation stemmed
from a Vachelor party given at the Delt
house. Delt alumni reportedly became

intoxicated and went to the neighbor
ing Beta Chi house, where they threat
encd and hit one person and destroyed
a lamp and light fixture.
, Dean Hanson pointed out to The
DAILY that none of those Delts
reportedly involved in the incidents
were at present registered in the Uni
versity.
