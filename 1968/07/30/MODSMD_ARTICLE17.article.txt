# Experimental Film, 'Faces' To Make N. Cal Debut
## 
### 
"Faces," the long-awaited writing
directing encore of John Cassavetes,
will receive its Northern California pre
miere showing Aug. 7 at the Stanford
Summer Festival.
The film will be shown at 3:30 and
8 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium.
"Faces" is similar in technique to
Cassavetes' controversial "Shadows"
(1960), which set a high quality stan
dard for American experimental films
and wrought changes in Hollywood
commercial cinema as well. Cassavetes'
actors arc given a situation and then
permitted to play out their reactions to
each other and to it, techniques which
set the film apart from mere cinema

translation of stage drama.
â€¢ " 'Faces' is at once a social docu
mentary and a love story. It concerns
an upper-middle-class American couple
married 14 years who decide suddenly
to separate. The film views compassio
nately their new concepts of friend
ship, business and religion as well as
the pathos of their respective flings of
extra-marital sex.
"Faces" is an official entry in this
years' Venice Film Festival Cassavetes
had given it only limited showings to
date. In late June, it was shown at the
National Film Theatre in London,
where "Shadows" eight years earlier
had sparked a flood of excited argu

merit about the role of improvisation
in film drama.
John Russell Taylor, in the London
Times of June 29, said "Faces" proves
Cassavetes "an absolute genius as a
director of actors. Not one role in
'Faces' is less than superlatively played.
'"Faces' is unlikely to become an
issue, like 'Shadows'; it offers little
room for argument. After all, why
argue about the major work of a major
talent? If it makes up some of its own
rules, it simultaneously compels us to
accept them; the form and the content
are for once, as they should always be,
indivisible."
Cassavetes has worked three years
on "Faces," about six months of the
time in filming.
The 11 actors range from John
Marley, veteran of 30 years of acting
encompassing every medium, who por
trays the husband, to Lynn Carlin, a
non-actress secretary who was spotted
by Cassavetes in his search for an
attractive middle-class type*
Cassavetes, 37, has worked as an
actor, producer, director, cameraman,
writer and outspoken member of the
theatrical society in a career ranging
from the early years of television to his
current lead role in the hit film "Ro
semary's Baby."
