# Engineering Conference To Be Held On Campus
## 
### 
Up to 1500 scientists and engineers
representing nations around the world
-including large contingents from
Russia, England, France, Germany,
Italy, and Japan-will attend the 12th
International Congress of Applied
Mechanics at Stanford University Aug.
26-31.
Nearly 300 papers on sophisticated
aspects of aerodynamics, high tempera
ture shock waves, continuum
mechanics, thin shell theory, and simi
lar subjects will be presented during
the five days of meetings hosted by
Stanford's School of Engineering.
Sir Geoffrey Taylor of Oxford, at

82 the "grand old man" and an
acknowledged genius in applied
mechanics, will be among those pre
senting papers. He has given four
general lectures at previous congresses,
beginning with the first congress in
1924.
President of the congress will be
Prof. Nicholas J. Hoff of Stanford,
head of the Department of Aeronautics
and Astronautics. Special activities will
include tours of the NASA Ames Re
search Laboratory at Moffett Field and
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter.


VISUAL TEACHING MACHINE -displayed by Stanford graduate Larry
Fahbro, who designed and built it to teach "visual thinking." Instructions are
projected on the frosted glass screen at top and the student carrics them out
on tracing paper rolled across glass drawing table beneath. An ordinary 35mm
slide projector behind the glass plates produces both images from a single film
slide by means of a split-mirror system.
