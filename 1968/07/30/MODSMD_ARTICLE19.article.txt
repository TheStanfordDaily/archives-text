The Stanford University Employees
Association (SUEA) held iiS second
meeting last Tuesday night and elected
officers to see it through the first year
of organization.
But the status ot one of the officers,
President Ken Croft, was obscure.
There were reports Croft had been
"terminated" by Stanford prior to the
election, but the university personnel
department refused to comment on the
reports. And Croft himself said he still
considers himself a Stanford employee.
Croft, a purchasing agent at the
Stanford Medical Center, said nearly
300 persons attended the meeting last
Tuesday night and that most of those
who were not SUEA members at that
time, signed up. He said the exact
membership had not been calculated
but added, "1 imagine we're pushing
close to 500 now."
There are an estimated 4,000 non
teaching employees at Stanford that
the union hopes to organize.
Other officers elected Tuesday night
were Michael Fineo, a maintenance

mechanic in the physical plant, vice
president; Mrs. Elisabeth McKenzie, a
secretary in the medical center, secre
tary; and Charles Meyer, an electrician
in tlie physical plant, treasurer.
Committee chairmen selected were:
grievance, Hank van den Haak, a cabi
net maker in the physical plant; wages,
working conditions and benefits,
Robert Mills, a staff assistant at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator; member
ship, Geoffrey Jones, a technician at
the Hansen Laboratories; and public
relations, Daniel West, a property con
trol assistant at Hansen Laboratories.
Croft said the principal goal of the
union is "to improve communication
between employees and the adminis
tration, which has been minimal for a
number of years."
He said, "we're not a group of
agitators. However, we're not afraid of
standing up for what is right."
The officers will serve through the
1968-69 academic year.
