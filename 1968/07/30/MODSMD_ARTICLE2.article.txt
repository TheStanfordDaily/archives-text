## No More Down The Way Of St. Dusty 
### ART WILSON 
(Art Wilson served this past year as a
co-chairman of the Stanford Black Stu
dent Union-Ed.)
As I viewed Raymond R. White's
comments in the July 19 issue of THE
STANFORD DAILY, there arose with
in me a hate for this white man, al
though I do not know him. A hate so
strong that I was compelled to write
this article-an article which some
might term over-emotional and purely
irrational.
I will make no attempts to disclaim
this fact; black people have always
been emotional, this is cultural, we arc

a very "leelmg" people. As for being ir
rational, yes, perhaps I am this too, be
cause when "rational" becomes a term
justified and nurtured in a racist sys
tem, then irrational has to be the "for
real" way to be. Moreover, the white
man will always win, if he uses his in
terpretation.
Mr. White, there is nothing "dull"
about the ghetto, about the black com
munity. There is nothing dull about
hunger. The things black people hunger
for arc many; among these are educa
tion. Being without luxuries in a re
markably affluent society is one thing,
but being without basic necessities is

inhumane. It is in this cesspool of in
humanity that the black people have
been forced, virtually shoved by your
established society. A society that sup
posedly believes in life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness for all.
There is no happiness in poverty.
The welfare mother with ten kids has
no happiness, the ghetto youngster
with no food in the refrigerator has no
happiness, the young black father
which can't find work to support his
family has no happiness.
That is, except the happiness which
comes when a black face looks to the
sun and senses a new greatness, a new
pride, a new cause. A cause like that of
the Black Panthers.
Mr. White speaks of energies better
spent trying to over-come. . . What
have blacks been doing for four hund
red years? For four hundred years
black people have been trying to over
come the detribalization, the brutaliza
tion, the discnfranchiscment, the
accused white forces that tore him
from his homeland, raped his mother,
lynched his father, and prostituted him
throughout the world. A very real
world where "the power of the white
man is heavy" and the "white man
makes heap big magic."

Ellis, a trumpeter and master of the
electronic console, formed the band in
Hollywood in 1964. Within two years,
its pulsating new sound was
mesmerizing crowds at the Monterey
and Newport jazz festivals. The
orchestra's "Electric Bath" record for
Columbia is a national bestseller in
jazz. Hits from this and previous re
cordings will be a feature of the Stan
ford concert.
Rhythm is Ellis' fascination. The
orchestra includes four percussionists
and three basses. It plays unusual

That's what black organizations like
the Panthers are all about. They are
doing their "thing," which basically is
to preserve black people.- This society
is starving us to death in Mississippi, it
is sending us to our deaths in Viet
Nam, and it is "blowing" us away in
the streets of Oakland, Watts, Newark,
Detroit and so many other cities that a
brother got to stop for a minute and
catch his breath.
This education Mr. White raves
about; 1 wonder, Mr. White, did that
education ever inform you that you
didn't have to go to India to find pov
erty and starvation, but that you could
find them indeed, across the street, or
around the corner.
Moreover, Mr. White, did that edu
cation ever inform you what to do
when there's no food at the house; you
don't know who your father was; and a
white teacher at your school thinks
black people are inherently ignorant
and can't be educated.
These things, Mr. White, are ex
amples of what my people are faced
with everyday of their lived-out lives, a
life time spent going from one unem
ployment office to another and going
to interviews for jobs where the other
guy always gets the job.
I wonder, Mr. White, was this part
of your education?
We have a saying in the ghetto
about people who think they know it
all, we say, "he may know his marvel
comics, but he ain't got a bit of
mother-wit," and mother-wit, Mr.
White, is simply that which comes
from confrontation with those experi
ences within one's life. As yet, Mr.
White, vou ain't lived.

tempos which have their roots in folk
music, including the Indian music per
