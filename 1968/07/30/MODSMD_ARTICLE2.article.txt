## No More Down The Way Of St. Dusty 
### ART WILSON 
(Art Wilson served this past year as a
co-chairman of the Stanford Black Stu
dent Union-Ed.)
As I viewed Raymond R. White's
comments in the July 19 issue of THE
STANFORD DAILY, there arose with
in me a hate for this white man, al
though I do not know him. A hate so
strong that I was compelled to write
this article-an article which some
might term over-emotional and purely
irrational.
I will make no attempts to disclaim
this fact; black people have always
been emotional, this is cultural, we arc

a very "leelmg" people. As for being ir
rational, yes, perhaps I am this too, be
cause when "rational" becomes a term
justified and nurtured in a racist sys
tem, then irrational has to be the "for
real" way to be. Moreover, the white
man will always win, if he uses his in
terpretation.
Mr. White, there is nothing "dull"
about the ghetto, about the black com
munity. There is nothing dull about
hunger. The things black people hunger
for arc many; among these are educa
tion. Being without luxuries in a re
markably affluent society is one thing,
but being without basic necessities is

inhumane. It is in this cesspool of in
humanity that the black people have
been forced, virtually shoved by your
established society. A society that sup
posedly believes in life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness for all.
There is no happiness in poverty.
The welfare mother with ten kids has
no happiness, the ghetto youngster
with no food in the refrigerator has no
happiness, the young black father
which can't find work to support his
family has no happiness.
That is, except the happiness which
comes when a black face looks to the
sun and senses a new greatness, a new
pride, a new cause. A cause like that of
the Black Panthers.
Mr. White speaks of energies better
spent trying to over-come. . . What
have blacks been doing for four hund
red years? For four hundred years
black people have been trying to over
come the detribalization, the brutaliza
tion, the discnfranchiscment, the
accused white forces that tore him
from his homeland, raped his mother,
lynched his father, and prostituted him
throughout the world. A very real
world where "the power of the white
man is heavy" and the "white man
makes heap big magic."

Ellis, a trumpeter and master of the
electronic console, formed the band in
Hollywood in 1964. Within two years,
its pulsating new sound was
mesmerizing crowds at the Monterey
and Newport jazz festivals. The
orchestra's "Electric Bath" record for
Columbia is a national bestseller in
jazz. Hits from this and previous re
cordings will be a feature of the Stan
ford concert.
Rhythm is Ellis' fascination. The
orchestra includes four percussionists
and three basses. It plays unusual

That's what black organizations like
the Panthers are all about. They are
doing their "thing," which basically is
to preserve black people.- This society
is starving us to death in Mississippi, it
is sending us to our deaths in Viet
Nam, and it is "blowing" us away in
the streets of Oakland, Watts, Newark,
Detroit and so many other cities that a
brother got to stop for a minute and
catch his breath.
This education Mr. White raves
about; 1 wonder, Mr. White, did that
education ever inform you that you
didn't have to go to India to find pov
erty and starvation, but that you could
find them indeed, across the street, or
around the corner.
Moreover, Mr. White, did that edu
cation ever inform you what to do
when there's no food at the house; you
don't know who your father was; and a
white teacher at your school thinks
black people are inherently ignorant
and can't be educated.
These things, Mr. White, are ex
amples of what my people are faced
with everyday of their lived-out lives, a
life time spent going from one unem
ployment office to another and going
to interviews for jobs where the other
guy always gets the job.
I wonder, Mr. White, was this part
of your education?
We have a saying in the ghetto
about people who think they know it
all, we say, "he may know his marvel
comics, but he ain't got a bit of
mother-wit," and mother-wit, Mr.
White, is simply that which comes
from confrontation with those experi
ences within one's life. As yet, Mr.
White, vou ain't lived.

music, including the Indian music per

What the heck do you know about
equal opportunity employment? 1
leave this question for you to answer,
assuming that you arc not the moron
you speak of in your article, "The
Bigot's Case ..."
Now, let's get down to cases. Frank
ly, Mr. White, your ignorance is only
surpassed by your lack of facts and in
sight with reference to the Huey New
ton case.
Of course, a policeman was killed
and another wounded, but this is not
one of the points being argued. How
this policeman was killed is the ques
tion. You know, in the south when a
black man killed a white man no mat
ter what the circumstances, it was al
ways termed first degree murder and
that black man was lucky if he got the
chance to be put to death by trial.
Well, this in itself is the same situa
tion that the black man is faced with in
connection with the killing of a police
man. When a cop is killed, no one ever
questions who the guilty party is; of
course, it's "that dirty cop-killer."
But when a black man, like Dead
wylder, is killed by a cop in L.A. while
trying to get his wife to the hospital
when Deadwylder's car supposedly
lunged forward, everybody, except
black people, assumes that that cop
was performing his duties to the best
of his ability and that he rightfully
i took a life. |
Another example, being the murder
of seventeen year old Bobby Hutton!
who was executed by a hail of bullets

while trying to surrender, at least,
three of those bullets piercing his head.
All this accomplished quite legally,
with not one protest, except that of
the vengeful voices of his black broth
ers and the pitiful wail of ghetto
mothers.
Now Mr. White, let us ask ourselves
these questions. Why was the vehicle in
which Huey Newton was a passenger
stopped that night? Where is the gun
that Huey Newton supposedly had?
Who shot first? Why had Huey Newton
been harassed for at least three weeks
prior?
Has the policeman been given a
license to kill without cause? Was Huey
Newton's life threatened? Does a seg
ment of the population have the right
to protect itself, when societal law en
forcement agencies fajl to do so?
When something or someone desires
to take your life do you just die or do
that which is necessary to preserve
yourself?
These questions Mr. White, arc what
make Huey Newton more than just
another "Nigger" going on trial. What
is on trial, Mr. White, is America and
its ability to be just with all its citizens.
Even those who have been relegated to
the position of a "second class."
What has transpired thus far shows
black people "no style." What has
happened before is happening again. A
group of brave people once said, "no
| taxation without representation;"
that's what the ghetto is demanding
now.. .. You ain't gonna 'kill us like
that! Moreover, it ain't going to be that
easy, baby!
