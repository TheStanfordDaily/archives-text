Orchestra, the Cleveland Orchestra, the
San Francisco Symphony, and with
Glenn Gould at the Stratford Music
Festival. She also has appeared at the
Carmel Bach Festival. In 1966 she was
acclaimed during a 15-city concert tour
of the Soviet Union.

Berlioz, Claude Debussy, Francois
Poulenc, Gustav Mahler, Vincent
