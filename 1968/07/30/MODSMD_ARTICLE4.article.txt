# Police Present Crime Picture

### PAUL DE LIBAN 
Many consider the purpose of the
Stanford Police Department (SI'D) to
be locking doors, closing windows,
issuing parking citations, and little else.
But Stanford has its share of crime and
it is keeping pace with the rest of the
nation.
Stanford had no crimes of violence
until this year's rape and attempted
rape. It really "shook us up," Stanford

police Captain William L. Wullshleger
said. The rape case could be simply an
isolated case or it could be the start of
a new trend in Stanford crime, he
added.
The first narcotics charge in at least
eight years also occurred this year,
when a Stanford officer arrested two
students for smoking marijuana in
Breakers Eating Club in March.
But the common campus crimes sel
dom make the headlines. "Thefts are
our number one concern," Wullschle
ger noted. Bicycle thefts and parking
violations also rank high.
As a result of the thefts, an investi
gator of misdemeanors will be added to
the SPD. This investigator will be the
liaison between the courts and Stan
ford. Donald G. Lillie, a Stanford
police officer for the past nine years,
will assume this post in September.
He previously served as an investi
gator and lieutenant in the Sunnyvale
Department of Public Safety. This new
position should help reduce the crime
rate on campus, Wullschleger pre
dicted.
Petty thefts have increased from
123 in 1963-only five years ago—to
202 for the first five months of this
year. In 1964, 180 petty thefts were
reported, and 241 in 1965 (the last
year for which complete figures are
available), which typifies the increase
of crime at Stanford.
Petty theft figures for June 1968
reported goods are taken from vehicles,
University residences and dorms, aca
demic buildings, commercial establish
ments on campus, and construction
sites. Private residences and govern
ment projects are also listed as likely to
be hit by thieves.
Vehicle accidents are also fairly
common. The most frequent cause is a
question of right-of-way, especially
making left turns. The 21-25 age group
is most commonly involved because of
the large number of people of that age
on campus.
Of 11 vehicle accidents in June,
four resulted in injuries, while seven
caused property damage but no human
injury.
Emergency medical reports covering
all injuries not caused by vehicles arc
another common event for which po
lice are called. These range from a per-,
son stepping on a nail to a man losing a
finger in construction projects.
Student violations are another cate
gory of crimes handled by the Stanford
Police Department. These include vio
lations of Stanford student regulations.
Serious student violations are reported
to the Dean of Students office..
