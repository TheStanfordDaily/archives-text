# President-Choosing
## 
### 
ASSU President Denis Hayes lias
been trying all summer to show the
faculty that students are interested
enough and responsible enough to be
allowed into the inner councils of the
faculty committee chosen to
investigate possible permanent
presidents for the University with the
Trustees.
He has not gotten very far, but that
is no reflection on Hayes. Rather it is a
reflection on the surprisingly closed
mind of the faculty in this matter.
We take offense at the statement of
Prof. William Baxter of law, who chairs
the search committee, that to let
students know who was being
considered for the post would be a
betrayal of confidence.
Students have long been proving

that they can keep secrets, when
secrets need to be kept, by their
service on various of the committees of
the University.
And we disagree with Baxter that
the judgments of the constituencies of
the University are not too divergent
and that therefore it does not matter
that there are no students on the
committee.
Although we find the Trustees'
choice for acting president, Robert
Glaser of the School of Medicine, may
have been a judicious one, we cannot
agree that the decisions of the distant
and unapproachable Trustees would
not be immensely improved if they had
students to help them as well as faculty
members.
