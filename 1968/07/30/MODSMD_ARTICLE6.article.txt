# Czech Power
## 
### 
The German magazine
"Der Spiegel" reports that
last week a Czech liberal and
a conservative confronted
each other on television.
The conservative accused
the liberal of having loose
sexual morals, but the liberal
held up his hands and said.
"These hands have held the
buttocks of many women,
but there is no blood on
them."
This response seems indic
ative of the new feeling of
freedom of expression in
Czechoslovakia, due in part

to student and worker unrest
and in part to the magnifi
cantly quiet leadership of the
newly elevated Communist
party chief Alexander
Dubcek.
It is a sad commentary
that freedom and individual
ism can come about in many
places not because of ideal
ism but because of the fear
of what the enemy can do.
But freedom and individ
ualism found anywhere are
to be cherished. And we
hope the Czechs can avoid
Soviet domination and Amer
ican domination.
