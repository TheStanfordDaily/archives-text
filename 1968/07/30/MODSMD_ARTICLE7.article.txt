Like many of us, the

American Conservatory
Theatre (ACT) is having
money trouble.
But the theatre's problem
is much more acute, and its
contribution to the culture
Of the Bay Area is probably
greater than we are making at
this time.
It is almost too late to
save the theatre, which
needed $104,000 to pay
debts. A small part of this
has been collected from gifts.
But we encourage members
of the Stanford community
to send their checks today
for The American Conserva
tory Theatre to the Calif
ornia Theatre Foundation,
Suite 200, 127 Montgomery
St., San Francisco, Cal.
94104.
