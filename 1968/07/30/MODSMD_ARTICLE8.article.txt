## 1-S A Possibility? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to share a layman's per
sonal opinion with the rest of Stan
ford's draftable graduate students. As
is well known, the new draft regu
lations are expected next year to deny
' many grad students not only the 2-S
deferment, but also the statutory 1-S
deferment.
The 1-S deferment used to allow
virtually any student to postpone his
induction until the end of his academic
year. This can obviously be very help
ful to a student, and a group of univer
sity administrators attempted earlier
this year to get General Hershey to
reinstate this provision for grad stu
dents, without success. My own
feeling, based on a careful reading of
the draft law, is that grad students are
still clgally entitled to 1-S deferments.
If 1 am correct, the regulation deny
ing 1-S's to grads would thus contra
dict the law, and therefore be invalid.
Unfortunately, I am not a lawyer,

nor have many lawyers or law students
that I've talked to been willing to say
that I am definitely right or probably
wrong. So don't take my word for
anything. Instead, if you arc now a
grad student (not in the class of '68!),
are ordered to report for induction
during a future school year and would
like to finish the year, I suggest you
read carefully the relevant sections of
the draft law [U.S. Code, Title 50,
Appendix, Section 456, (h) and
(i)-note expecially the phrase "under
the provisions of this paragraph" in
(h)(1)]. Or get a lawyer and see what
he thinks.
