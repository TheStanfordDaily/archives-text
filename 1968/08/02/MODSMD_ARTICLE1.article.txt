# Stanford EMPLOYEES HOLD Rally
## 
### 
On a windy White Plaza Tuesday the Stanford
Employees' Association (SEA) held a rally to introduce
its new executive committee and talk about improve
ments in working conditions for the almost 4,000 peo
ple Stanford employs.
J. Kenneth Croft, of the University's Purchasing De
partment, told the rally, "We arc not in any sense of the
word a trouble-making organization."
He pointed out that SEA is not aligned with any
other labor organization.
Croft said the organization was interested in reduc
ing the discrepancies among wages paid in different
parts of the University for the same work. He also said
SEA was concerned at the lack of "any kind of unem
ployment insurance" for Stanford employees.
He said job descriptions were frequently "devalu
ated" in the University in order to avoid paying higher
wages.
Croft wants the organization to seek greater trans

ferring privileges within the University from one depart
ment to another.
SKA's viee-president, Mike Fineo, a maintenance
man, rejected all notions that the organization is radi
cally oriented. "We don't strike," he said, "we don't
want to destroy this University. We're here to help the
University and here to help its employees."
SEA treasurer Charles "Bud" Meyer, an electrician,
said he believed the organization should ask why em
ployees' hospitalization could not be paid for by the
University.
SEA's secretary Elizabeth McKenzie, a Medical
School secretary, also rejected the idea that the organi
zation was heading toward a strike.
"Strikes only follow if all negotiations fail," she said.
"And we have no intention of our negotiations failing."
President Croft said SEA hoped to have 2,000 mem
bers by the time school starts, and he claimed SEA has
already got about 500 members.
Steven Smith of the Graduate Students' Union
lauded the employees' group and told the 75 persons at
the rally that SEA could lead the way toward increased
communication between those who administer and
those who work for the University.
H. Bruce Franklin, assoc. prof, of English, charged
that the University is making a profit of a half million
dollars a year but is not sharing its wealth with its em
ployees.
Franklin suggested that the University make it pos
sible for employees to attend classes on a regular basis
during the working day.
Croft, who had charged in June that he was being
relieved of his job as a buyer in the Purchasing Depart
ment partly because of his involvement with SEA, told
the rally that his dismissal was not final.
"1 am now conducting discussions with Personnel
about changing my position," Croft said. He claimed his
SEA involvement has had "sonic bearing" on the diffi
culties he has encountered in changing jobs.
According to a Personnel Office communique, Croft
has been "terminated" from his job as of today, and
implied that this had no relations to his SEA activities.
