# The 						Conservative Case
## Race Answer Is Education, Not Guns 
### Raymond R. White 
It was my hope and expectation to promotion of a meaningful dialogue let
draw replies to my columns. My inter- us try to hang somewhere near the
ruption of the DAILY's monologue facts.
was meant to initiate a dialogue. In the 1Â° the first place, Mr. Chatterton, I

would like to make clear the fact that 1
am not a racist. Period. I do not nor
will I ever advocate unequal treatment
of persons of different races before the
law. On a personal level, I only hope 1
never do.
To extrapolate my statement about
the college education opportunities of
California to all phases of national Life
is dishonest. 1 made specific reference
to an open situation which is not being
fully exploited at this time. The state
ment stands.
Sometimes there is a valid need for
protest. Granted. That the case of
Huey Newton is such is beyond the
credibility of rational beings.
1 see the symbolic hangup, lluey is
every innocent Black man ever to have
been gunned down by a mistaken
and/or racist policeman. 1 can see how

he is thought of by some members of
the Black community.
But I won't spare Hucy the force of
the law for that. The evidence says he
must stand trial; and our civilization
demands that he abide by the decision.
Now, Miss Franklin, your turn. The
first few times that a Black policeman
shot an innocent White boy (though
you speak of a guilty one who should
be subject to police action) 1 cannot
imagine that the result would be a dead
policeman or a riot. After it became
common practice as you describe (1
won't concede that it has for White
policemen to shoot Black people), then
perhaps the results would be violent.
The results of such violence would not
be positive.
Legislation which is passed as a re
sult of riots is of two kinds: repressive
and social. The social legislation passed
is seldom well considered and almost
always works to the long run economic
detriment of the people it is supposed
to help.
Federal legislation can benefit the
disadvantaged in the area of education.
1 don't think any other area merits fed
eral attention in a large way, and cer
tainly not in terms of billions of
dollars.
Riots bring an awareness of the
problem, can't deny that. I'm not sure
that they have the effect of educating
racism out of the White populace. I am
sure I can't condone the loss of life and
the economic destruction which they
cause.

The obvious connections of the
Black leaders with Marxist philosophy
disaffect me entirely. Legislation de
signed to equalize people economically
is wrong, and, further, will not pro
mote universal affluence. The "Big
Businesshogs" are very rare, as 97.5 per
cent of all taxpayers earn under
$20,000 a year.
Confiscating and sharing out their
property and income would be rather
disappointing. It would also cause a
drop in GNP which it would take years
to make up. The loss in terms of
capital accumulation and investment
would hurt economic growth for a very
long time.
The contribution to afflucnce of all
citizens (especially the poor) of the eli
mination of the rich as an economic
class would be negative. The basis for
national affluence is capital accumula
tion. Federal legislation to help the
poor directly almost always works
against capital accumulation.
The results of the Job Corps and
the War on Poverty programs are clear
indication that federal programs are
not effective and that they are waste
ful, and therefore undesirable.
The two key areas where more fed
eral, state, or local legislation and
money can be effectively used are
those of job opportunities and educa
tion. Government is so inefficient at
setting up agencies to locate jobs and
workers that it is practically a prerequi
site to eet business involved on the ad
ministrative level.

This is hard to do. Since business
isn't going to get motivated by itself
there will have to be a federal agency
designed to haul business into the act.
This should be done.
The problem of how to pump fed
eral money into local education is al
most prohibitive of this method of up
grading education in specific localities.
It is also wrong. Local schools should
be supported by local funds. The game
of getting federal money for local
schools merely destroys the tax bases
of local governments. Without local
financial support you lose local
control-and it's almost impossible to
reverse the process of centralization
and control from the top.
1 can't offer you any false liberal
promises. All 1 can offer is the hope
that the hand-up and the bootstrap
methods bring success to you and
yours, with pride and as few regrets as
possible at the end.
