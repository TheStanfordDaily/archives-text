# The 						Through- View
## Literacy Enough? 
### Doug Taber 
In today's complcx socicty the
average voter is called upon to make
many decisions for which he has had
little or no preparation.
What, for instance, should be our
position with respect to Biafra? Pro
bably the easiest response, and certain
ly the most emotionally appealing,
would be to move in and protect the
Biafrans with force of arms. After all,
we are committed to the defense of
freedom everywhere in the world, and
the Biafran secession certainly seems
justified.
Certainly a high school education is
not enough. Look back if you will on
how much you actually knew when
you graduated from high school.
What of the complexities of the
gold trade, or the international Balance
j of payments'? Even now, alter Political
Science I and perhaps Introduction to
Economics, you probably still have
only a vague conception of the enor

mity of the problems that every day
face the decision-makers of our govern
ment.
It would seem obvious, then, the
protestations of Mr. White notwith
standing, that mere literacy by no
means qualifies one to vote in this
country.
Indeed, considering the quality of
instruction at many schools, even a de
cree from an accredited institution of
higher education would probably not
be good enough. It would be best to
require a graduate degree in Govern
ment, with courses in sociology and
international relations, as the minimum
standard of education.
Then, and only then, could one say
that the American electorate was truly
prepared to wisely face the decisions
that must be made in selecting the
leaders of our nation.
