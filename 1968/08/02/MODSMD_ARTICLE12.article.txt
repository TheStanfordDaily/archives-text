## A 						New Way To Ammonia 
### 
A simple, new method for making
ammonia from nitrogen gas by means
of electricity is reported by Stanford
University chemists in the current issue
of "The Journal of the American
Chemical Society."
The laboratory process, an out
growth of research in several countries
on the utilization of atmospheric nitro
gen by plants and micro-organisms,
i turns out ammonia in good yield at rm
temperature and pressure, says Dr.
Eugene E. van Tamelen, professor of
chemistry at Stanford University.
Present manufacturing processes
rely on high temperatures and extreme
pressures.
"With cheap electrical power avail
able in many countries, the idea that
nitrogen can be electrically converted
to ammonia under mild conditions
would seem to be attractive," Dr. van
Tamelen said in an interview.
"But the method, as it now stands,
is certainly not ready to go into pro
duction.' Ammonia (NH3) is a com
bination of one part nitrogen to three
parts of hydrogen.
In the Stanford experiment, nitro
gen gas was bubbled through an electri
cal cell containing a catalyst, titanium
tetraisopropoxide, and an electrical
conductor, aluminum chloride. With
the titanium catalyst, the nitrogen
could take on electrons from the elect
ric current. With the addition of hydro
gen from water or alcohol, ammonia
was produced.
Although pure nitrogen was used,

previous experiments reported earlier
this y' '.honsh economically im
practical, indicaieu .•tmospheric
nitrogen (air is about 7b '-ent nitro
gen) could be converted to ammonia.
The fact that atmospheric nitrogen re
acted surprised chemists because, in
comparison with oxygen, «t <s usually
considered inei t.
Plants and micro-organisms can
"fix" and incorporate atmospheric
nitrogen into various forms such as
ammonia, amino acids, and other
materials essential to life. Chemists in
several countries have tried to decipher
what happens at the molecular level
and duplicate this process.
"There are really two parts to the
problem," Dr. van Tamelen explained.
' One is to fix the nitrogen, that is, get
it bound in some form.
"Having done that, the other part is
to convert it to something interesting,
and ammonia is certainly the thing that
caught people's eye. Our goal has been
>— " —

to get nitrogen to react at room temp
erature and convert it to ammonia.
Ammonia is now made industrially
by forcing pure nitrogen and hydrogen
gases together with a catalyst and high
temperatures and pressures (about 900
degrees Fahrenheit and 200 atmos
pheres of pressure). About 12 million
tons of ammonia were made last year
in the U.S. using the process whose
essential details were worked out
roughly 60 years ago by the German
chemist, Fritz Haber.
Most of the ammonia goes to the
manufacture of fertilizers. It's also
used by industry to make pharmaceu
ticals, explosives, paper, etc.
"I don't think the Habrr process is
ready to disappear," Dr. v.- ~
said. "But I have no < ■> . ue

to get nitrogen to react at room temp

Ammonia is now made industrially
by forcing pure nitrogen and hydrogen
gases together with a catalyst and high
temperatures and pressures (about 900
degrees Fahrenheit and 200 atmos
pheres of pressure). About 12 million
tons of ammonia were made last year
in the U.S. using the process whose
essential details were worked out
roughly 60 years ago by the German
chemist, Fritz Haber.
Most of the ammonia goes to the
manufacture of fertilizers. It's also
used by industry to make pharmaceu
ticals, explosives, paper, etc.

"With cheap electrical power avail

nitrogen can be electrically converted

In the Stanford experiment, nitro

tetraisopropoxide, and an electrical
conductor, aluminum chloride. With
the titanium catalyst, the nitrogen
could take on electrons from the elect

was produced.

"There are really two parts to the
problem," Dr. van Tamelen explained.
