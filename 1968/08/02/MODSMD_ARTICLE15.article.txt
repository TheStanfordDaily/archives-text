# Peace-Freedom Party, Black Panthers Petition For Police Control Board
## 
### 
Jointly sponsored by the Peace and
Freedom Party and the Black Panther
Party, a petition drive to place a Police
Control Board Initiative on the Novem
ber ballot was announced .
The Initiative will propose charter
amendments for the cities of Berkeley
and Oakland in order to establish sepa
rate and independent police depart
ments for the indigenous communities
located within these cities: in Oakland,
one for the black community (includ
ing the Chicanos) and one for the
white community; in Berkeley, one for
the black community, one for the cam
pus community, and one for the re
mainder of the city.
The proposal provides that the
separate police departments be con
trolled by the people living in the
respective communities, limiting the
role of the police to protecting the

rights of the members of the
community. The sponsors of the Initia
tive consider police forces presently to
be "organized and controlled by the

white power structure" functioning in
a role limited to protecting property
and persons in the white community,
and enfQrcing traffic regulations.
