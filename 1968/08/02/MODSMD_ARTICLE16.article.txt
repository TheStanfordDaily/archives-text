# Weather Satellites

### FRIEDRICH ABEL 
Possibly by 1971, monster com
puters will digest information of the
atmosphere's pressure variations all
over the globe and make weather pre
dictions ten days in advance. One
"master" satellite, together with six
"slave" satellites, orbiting around the
earth, will transmit radio signals to a
ground station and give the basic infor
mation to a "world atmospheric
model," a giant computer program.
Present weather stations cover ade
quately only about 25 per cent of the
globe, said Steve Ungar, a graduate stu
dent in electrical engineering,
participating in a large NASA
sponsored program at Stanford to
develop a worldwide weather fore
casting system by the means of
satellites. Principal project investigator
is Professor Bruce Lusignan of elect
rical engineering. !
Ungar said that the additions of
land stations in remote land areas and

on the oceans to cover the 75 per cent
of the earth not supplied with weather
stations would be prohibitively expen
sive. Free floating balloons and ocean
buoys interrogated by satellites are
presently under development. How
ever, because of the vast number of
balloons required and their short life
time, the cost of such a system is still
very high.
To acquire the information more
economically, various methods have
been proposed to sense the atmosphere
remotely from satellites, Ungar said.
Studies of the potential use of such
forecasts estimate possible annual
savings of many billions of dollars, he
said. Forecasts of 80 per cent probabi
lity, ten days in advance, would revolu
tionize meteorology and bring
improvements to almost all aspects of
human life.
Ungar sketched the basic principles
involved in a satellite weather fore
casting system on a blackboard. The

most important factors influencing
weather are pressure and temperature
which vary from place to place in the
atmosphere, he said. Imagine two satel
lites in the same orbit, but spaced so
that radio waves from one to the other
pass through the atmosphere, he sug
gested.
In vacuum radio waves would pro
pagate with the speed of light, while in
the atmosphere they propagate with a
reduced velocity and are bent. This
reduction of speed and bending process
depends on the atmosphere's pressure,
water vapor content, and temperature
between the two satellites, Ungar ex
plained.
The path length between satellites
computed from these velocity data is
longer than the free path length. Meas
uring the satellites' actual position in
space, the differences between com
puted and measured values of path
lengths give the basic data for deter
mining the atmosphere's pressure and
temperature, Ungar said.
Ungar then pointed out that a
system of one ' master'-transmitter
satellite and six ' slave "-receiver satel
lites, orbiting around the earth, and
arranged at different latitudes and in
different distances from each other,
could sense pressures at different lo
cations and depths in the atmosphere.
These seven satellites could quite well
cover most of the earth's atmosphere,
Ungar said. An additional satellite
would measure the geopotential field
of the earth to enable the computer to
make the necessary corrections of the
satellites' measurements.
The same principle was used with
Mariner IV in 1965 and Mariner V in
1967 to determine the atmospheric
characteristics of Mars and Venus.
Several experiments have to be
carried out, before a satellite weather
forecasting system can be put into
practice. In preparing for the first
space experiments it is planned to run
a propagation experiment between two
mountains or two airplanes with a pro
totype of the equipment later to be
used in space, Ungar said.
In the proposed first space experi
ments a slave satellite will be ejected
from a master Nimbus spacecraft to
allow first test measurements. To
develop the final weather forecasting
system, further work is needed to pre
pare for space experiments and to de
fine the meteorological aspects, Ungar
emphasized.
For example, the statistics of cloud
types will have to be included in the
computer program to evaluate the vari
ous methods of extracting water vapor
from air density information.
