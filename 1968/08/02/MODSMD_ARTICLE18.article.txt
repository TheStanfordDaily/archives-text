### HOLLY HOFFMEISTER 
'These are not the kinds of plays
that I would want to present to people
who make $50,000 a year and drive
Cadillacs because, frankly, they aren't
interested in what a black man thinks,"
said Leonard Simon, riepistrar of
paintings at the Stanford Art Museum.
Simon is currently acting in and
directing a series of one-act plays deal
ing with American racial problems, to
be given tonight and tomorrow at the
Stanford Art Museum.
Simon admitted that the two Leßoi
Jones plays being presented, 'The
Dutchman' and"The Slave," are
shocking, but at the same time provide
powerful insight into our racial conflict
in sharp, witty dialogue.
In "The Dutchman," two major
protagonists, a white woman and a

black man, symbolically act out the
two separate societies they represent.
"The Slave" deals with the personal
conflict of a revolutionary leader with
in the context of larger societal con
flict.
"Fam and Yam" (Famous America
and Young America) by Fdward Albee
is a serious, at times comical, interview
of Famous America by Young America
in which the elder's decadent bourgeois
character is thoroughly exposed. The
final play being given, "Happy Ending"
by Douglas T. Ward, is a hilarious com
edy about two women domestics and
their up-and-coming black nephew.
Simon invited all interested in the
opinions of Leßoi Jones, Fdward
Albce, and Douglas Ward as to who we
are and where we stand as a people en
gaged in racial and generation conflict,
to come today and tomorrow to the
Miedel Room, Stanford Museum at
8 p.m. Admission is $1 at the door;
no reserved scats.
