# Hayes Presents New Constitution
## 
### 
ASSU President Denis Hayes pre
sented to the Legislature Tuesday the
draft of a new constitution for the
Associated Students.
The Legislature will probably
mit the document to a general vote of
the student body in the fall.
In the May election that put Hayes
in the presidency, students rejected
another constitution although they
also voted against retaining the-present
constitution. The new document is an
attempt to eliminate some of the as

pccts of the present system that many
lind objectionable.
