# Hayes Presents New Constitution
## 
### 
ASSU President Denis Hayes pre
sented to the Legislature Tuesday the
draft of a new constitution for the
Associated Students.
The Legislature will probably
mit the document to a general vote of
the student body in the fall.
In the May election that put Hayes
in the presidency, students rejected
another constitution although they
also voted against retaining the-present
constitution. The new document is an
attempt to eliminate some of the as

pccts of the present system that many
lind objectionable.
The heart of the document is a
23-man senate with ten persons elected
it large among undergraduates and ten
electcd or appointed from the graduate
schools.
The constitution allows for the
plugging in of a conduct-legislating
council and a judicial council along the
lines of the Committee of 15 rc-|
commendation, although that docu-|
ment is not mentioned.
l ees will be collected with tuition
fees, but graduate school student
a:-sociations would get a rebate from
the ASSU on a per capita basis for
their programs. At present the schools
of law, business, medicine, and educa
tion have graduate student associa
tions.
Total fees would be set by a major
ity vote of the whole student body.
