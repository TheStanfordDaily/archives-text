"I think the Czechs will
eventually succecd in
their ai m s . . . th e

liberalization will continue. However, there will
be pressure, economic or otherwise, from the
Russians for the Czechs to stay within the War
saw Pact. I don't think the Russians could afford
a military intervention. Their image in Asia and
Africa is pretty shaky, also the Cold War has re
laxed since 1956 when the Soviets intervened in
Hungary. The Russians are afraid they might lose
the leadership of world communism completely
it they used force in Czechoslovakia."

Roth Meyer, bank exec
utive. West Covina; par
ticipating in Stanford's
mortgage summer
school.
"I hope that the Czechs
will find their own way

of communism, although I don't believe the
Russians will allow it. looking at their past per
formance. . . Hungary, and so on. II they al
lowed the liberalization to continue, other
countries would follow . . . you would get a chain
reaction. We are very close to a military intcrvcn-

tion."
Marsa Stamcll, grad
uate. Broadcasting and
I ilm.
"We should help the
Czechs. If not mili
tarily, we should give

them moral assur
ance ... perhaps we should do now what we
haven't done in Hungary, give them military aid."

George Hansen, sopho
more, Naval ROTC.
"The Russians won't in
terfere militarily. They
are very much con
cerned about their
image which has im

proved over the last years and which they don t
want to lose again. The Soviets realize that this ia

a natural reformist phase and that they can't hold
it back completely. I expect a series of compro
mises between I.astern I urope and Russia for the

next 20 to 30 years."
Carol Ellison, under
grade Portuguese.
"I think It will come to
a 'staged clash' between
the Czechs and Russia
to allow the Russians to
withdraw in honour. I

don't think it will conic to military interference.
The economic losses for the Soviet Union will be
the most significant, 1 believe. Perhaps the Czechs
could make the Russians look bad enough in the
world opinion . .. the Russians would back out
then without much trouble."

Joe Sneed, assistant
professor, Philosophy.
"I don't think the Rus
sians will use force di
rectly. They arc also re
luctant to put econom
ic pressure on the

Czechs not to lose the Czech market to the West.

Some compromise will be worked out ... the
Czechs will give in somewhat. Hungary wasn't the
same: the personalities that reign Russia today
arc different. Two other important factors are
the image question and the moral support of
Czechoslovakia by Western communist parties.

Bill Hcssc, graduate, 11
Physics, SLAC.
"Wc arc always backing '
the side ... the
same thing happened in
1956. Taking sides in
this case would be bet-

ter for the U.S. There is a 50 per cent chance that
Russia will interfere militarily; the United States
should at least give moral support to the Czechs.
The United Nations should get involved in the
situation. If nobody helps, we should consider
helping the Czechs with our armed forces."

Wendy Rubin, under
graduate, Art History.
"The present war cli
mate doesn't allow the
Russians to use force.
They will have to bal-








anec it in another way : â€”
the Russians will make so much fuss of the situa
tion to get a peaceful compromise."

Mike Moore, graduate,
Education.
"It will work out rather
well. The Russians are
much more sophisti
cated now than in
1956. 112 urthermore, in

Hungary there was a nationalistic upheaval, while
in Czechoslovakia a reform movement is under

way. Other communist countries don't feel so de
prived that they immediately will demand the
same freedoms the Czechs now have. The press is
much freer in the Soviet Union than we generally

assume."
Diane Bodach, under
graduate, Sociology.
'The Russians won't in
terfere. They realize
that the feelings toward
freedom are much
stronger in Czechoslo-

vakia than in Hungary. The liberalization move
ment will go from one communist country to
another, even Rusia We should realize that
the real danger is China, and not Russia."

Raphael Munavu, grad
uate, Science; from
Kenya.
"Dubcek isn't really re
jecting communism it
self, he is only trying to
reform communism.

This is the essential difference to the 1956 situa
tion. Therefore, Russia won't intervene militarily

The Soviets are also concerned about world opin
ion. I think, a compromise will be worked out:
both sides will have to give in."

Jody Bowan, Biology
lab assistant.
"I think the Russians
will use mi 1 i tary
force ... look at the
war games along the
Czech border. The So-

viets arc afraid other communist countries could
follow the Czech example."
