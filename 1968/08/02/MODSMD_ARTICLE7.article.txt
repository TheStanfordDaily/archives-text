Stanford student David
Truong's father went to pri
son last week.
In other circumstances
that might be cause of the
dean of students' office to
call David in to see how he
was adjusting, to see if they
might not do something to
make him feel better about
whatever his father had done.
But the office of the dean
of students probably can say
nothing to make David fee!
better. His father is Truong
Dinh Dzu, Saigon lawyer
who ran second to now
president Thieu in the South
Vietnamese presidential
elections that returned Gen
eral Thieu to the presidency
and Air Marshall Ky to the
vice-presidency of that small
nation.
And the lawyer's crime
was suggesting that Saigon be
ready to negotiate with the
Viet Cong—a suggestion now

being made by all of the
most responsible American
observers of the Vietnam
war.
But the government of
the United States cannot es
cape blame so easily. We do
not suggest that Washington
should have intervened more
in the internal affairs of
South Vietnam and arranged
for Truong Dzu to be acquit
ted, although that course
could have maintained the
semblance of the illusion that
the South Vietnamese gov
ernment's cause is just.
We rather suggest that the
American government, if it
truly wishes to protect the
helpless, propagate demo
cratic ideals, and secure jus
tice, is fighting on the wrong
side in the Vietnamese con
flict. Although it is hard to

excuse the crimes against hu
manity committed by both .
sides, the vile and heinous 1
conviction of Mr. Truong in
the courts of South Vietnam
shows again that American
blood is being spilled in Asia
to protect a government that
is fascistic and repressive in
most of its policies.
President Johnson in
Honolulu pledged solidarity ,
with Mr. Thieu and with his
illegitimate regime. In light
of the conviction of Benja
min Spock and his fellows in
Boston this is almost under
standable.
But not in light of the
ideals of justice and freedom
of thought and expression to
ward which the United States
has been trying since its in
ception to strive.
