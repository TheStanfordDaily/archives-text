# A 						Conspiracy Of One
## Department Of Magic 
### Dan Snell 
A few members of the Stanford
community are making a bid for the
formation of a new department in the
university to keep pace with the
changing fields of science.
I interviewed two of these people,
one a tall dark woman with a beard
who said her name was Lenya, and one
a small and rather plump grandmother
figure who gave her name as Masha.
Both work for the food scrvicc part
time and also for the Polack Brothers'
Circus.
"Listen, when were you born?"
Lenya asked me when she first saw me.
"I was born in October. October 1.
1947."

'That is good. Yes. I hat is pro
pitious," Maslia nodded sagely.
There was a silence. Then this
reporter asked about the proposed
department.
"In the morning or in the after
noon?" Lenya asked.
"Early in the morning. But about
the department ..." I went on.
"That is not so good. No. That is
not good at all," Masha said. "Let me ,
sec your hand."
Extending my hand, I asked, "I'vei
heard you want to set up a Department
of Supersensory Sciences and Magic
Arts. Why do you think such a depart
ment could have anything concrete to
offer students?"
"Have you ever been in love?'
Masha said, examining my hand.
' Well, yes. Hut what about the
department? 1 mean what sort of
courscs would you offer?"
Lenya glanced at the palm
knowingly and said abscntmindedly,
' We do not quite understand what is
required for a department. But we have
several courses outlined roughly. First
a student should take Astrology 1 and
2. Then there would be Alchemy 50,
51, 52,and 53."
"But will the administrators
approve?' 1 queried.
"They will approve," Masha said
calmly. "You would be surprised at

who was visiting us in the dead of night
during the May sit-in."
The new department, what with the
liberalizing movement afoot in the Uni
versity, might be established in the fall
but for the fact that admissions would
have to be restrictive.
"vVe could not teach our secrets to
anyone who-was not a Gypsy," Lenya
said, stroking her beard. "It's not that
other students couldn't learn it, but
just that Gypsies get along better in a
Gypsy environment than others."

The bins at the Computer Center
were opened 18 hours after they were
shut off to try to discourage people
from charging computer jobs to
account numbers they were not
authorized to use. Mark Liberman
from the center staff said, "We don't
like having to inconvenience our users,
but anyone at all reasonable could see
it had to be done.... Things are now
back to normal."

Since there are only two
more DAILIES before the
staff stops publishing for the
quarter, no more classified
ads will be accepted because
the rates for one or two
appearances of an ad make it
more trouble than it is worth
to the advertiser.â€”The
