Pity our poor ad man, trying to tell you about the H
sound of Lafayette's Criterion Series speaker systems. I
1 Only listening can do that.
But one of the audio magazines took a survey and If
found Lafayette third in speaker brand preference I
among new equipment purchasers, even though it's R
sold only in one chain of stores!
We invite you to listen in particular to our 100 A If
2-way system at a modestly priced $49.95, and our I
200 A 12" 3-way system at $76.95.
Both these systems offer the largest woofers in their H
price range, with clean mid-range and highs. And their ll;
price is one step lower than for equivalents in other 1)
brands.
Maybe that's why we're so popular, even though 1|
you have to look for us to find us. And find us you can 1|
at three convenient Bay Area locations. %
