# RAGGED ROCK?
## 
### PETER THOMPSON 
Since transforming the relaxed,
free, and honest, atmosphere of the
Carousel Ballroom into a vehicle for his
summer rock concert series, Bill Gra
ham, winner of Rolling Stone's 1967
Chutzpah Award, has presented three
principal types of performers during
the last month: established "stars,"
lesser-known blues bands, and the
"third wave" of English groups.
Surprisingly, the true "name"
groups have been conspicuously absent
this summer, but Graham lias neverthe
less presented some of the biggest
draws in contemporary rock: the
Butterfield Blues Band. Electric Mag,
Sly and the Family Stone, Ike and Tina
Turner, and, much as I hate to admit
it, Blue Cheer.
Butterfield has retained no one
from his original band, and his perfor
mance is now embarrassingly dis
appointing and dull. Butter's harp is

still just fine, but not powerful enough
to cany his inept, out-of-tune guitarist
and a listless rhythm section: they have
become, sadly, just another band.
The Electric Flag's dismal show is
attributable solely to the fact that lead
guitarist and founder Michael Bloom
field has left. His replacement is com
petent, but certainly no Bloomfield;
the Flag's sound is now thin and flat.
Sty's numbers are grossly
overarranged-he almost managed to
ruin "1 Never Loved a Man" and"l
Can't Turn You Loose"-but has a tal
ented crew and occasionally generates
scyne enthusiasm. He has not really
achieved an effective balance between
stock rhythm and blues material.
Ike and Tina Turner were predict
able, erratic, and lovable. The band
played too long, the male vocalist-MC
sang too long, and the Ikettes soloed
too long-all of which meant that there
wasn't enough of Tina. She is perhaps
the most compelling female performer
in the business, with an animalism
which grabs you and makes you forget.
But Tina never got around to doing
much of her own stuff.
Blue Cheer has always been just aw
ful; don't worry, they still can't do
anything, and their popular acceptance
merely demonstrates that America's
taste isn't that good.
The bluesmen appearing this
summer have been the groups of
Buddy Guy, Freddie King, and Siegel-
Schwall. Buddie Guy plays with the

best of them and has a beautiful, mov
ing voice, but his band is nothing.
Freddie King's band is even worse,
but this King doesn't offer much more
himself. While it is impossible to ignore
his influence on blues, if you've heard
"Hideaway" and "San-Ho-Zay,"
you've heard it all.
Corky Siegel is the only one left
from the original Siegel-Schwall group,
but the replacements are quite satisfac
tory. Siegel's continued strong harp
work leads the band into a very clean,
together sound that is among the most
interesting of the desegregated blues
bands.
Preceded by invasions of first the
Beatles, Stones, etc., and then Hendrix,
Cream, etc., Ten Years After, the Jeff
Beck Group, and Peter Green's Fleet
wood,'Mac, constitute the principals of
the third wave of English groups to
tour America with some success. (Of
course, none of these are in the class of
Traffic, who perhaps completes this
group, but who didn't come this sum
mer; too, too bad.)
Ten Years After features Arthur
Lee, who is trying to become rock's
fastest guitarist, and almost makes it.
The group's distinctiveness comes from
the strong organ backing, which, unfor
tunately, is pretty much the same on
every song.
On the other hand, Jeff Beck's
group is impossible to ignore; they
come on like several other well-known
trios, hard, heavy, and noisy. Yet their

dexterity is unique. Beck is among the
most versatile of rock guitarists, able to
go from his bottleneck interpretation
of "Bolero" to the good-timey "Hi Ho
Silver Lining" to a fifteen minute total
ly improvised display of just how well
a young white boy can play his own
blues.
Peter Green, one of the innumer
able people who have found John
Mayall impossible to work with, has a
nice little group in the Fleetwood Mac.
The band's overall sound is damned
pleasant, if nothing earthshaking.
I'm glad Graham is able to give

vate and federal sources. The architect is Louis Kump ot San I rancisco.
these British bands a place to work;
I'm glad he has opened the way for
many of the recently "discovered"
bluesmen. He is doubtlessly aware that
most of his money is made from his
star attractions, that people would
come to hear the Grateful Dead with
the Preservation Hall Jazz Band (which
they will on Aug. 30-31) or Englebert
Humperdink or the Stanford Band.
And while I'm aware of the fact
that he has brought in jazz groups on a
limited basis, it seems absurd that he is
not doing more with his shows. It's
nice that Graham is letting Ornette
Coleman play Fillmore next Monday
so Shirley Clarke can film her movie,
but countless jazzmen are still being
forced into expensive clubs to play
background to the juice freaks-if
they've got any work at all. Graham
has always been generous to aspiring
focal bands and organizations needing a
benefit; he could help jazzmen in the
same way.
Furthermore, country blues artists,
folk musicians, and r 'n' b bands, are
rarely given a spot at Fillmore, yet are
a vital part of contemporary music.
Enough-Graham has established
himself as the best concert producer
around. The sound is superb, the light
shows are fine, the performers are the
essence of the important contemporary
music.
These shows are a far cry from the
do-your - two-hits-and-get-off-the-stage
Caravan of Stars Extravaganza, charac
terizing "live" rock not so long ago.
