## Self-Portraits On Display 
### 
By {JOLLY HOFFMESIJER
The Stanford Art Gallery is currently
featuring sixty artists' self-portraits
spanning four centuries, in an exhibit
entitled, 'The Artist Looks at Him
self."
The pictures were chosen by
Leonard Simon, registrar of paintings,
from a collection of 300 portraits
owned by the Achenbach foundation
in San Francisco.
How individual men have seen
themselves through the centuries is the
subject of the exhibit.

Eighteenth century ornateness, in
which the subject's face is often nearly
overpowered by surrounding embellish
ments, is contrasted with twentieth
century emphasis on an introspective
view of the subject.
The exhibit brings together a whole
spectrum of human attitudes. The ser
ious Protestant purposefulness of
Lucas Van Leyden's 16th century en
graving stands in juxtaposition to
Chagall's comic self-portrait. The self
satisfaction of Watteau in his flowing

robe and powdered wig contrasts with
the intense neuroticism of Schiele's
black and white image in Self-Portrait
in the Nude.
