# Stanford's Sea Outpost: Hopkins Marine Station
## 
### HOLLY HOFFMEISTER 
The Biological Laboratory at Pacific
Grove is an arm of Stanford Univer
sity's Biological Sciences Department
located on Monterey Bay in Pacific
Grove. This station, founded in 1892
was the first to be established on the
American Pacific Coast.
The station itself is located on
Monterey Bay, an area of unusually
'nindant marine life. The shore line
ajound the station is one of rugged
granite outcroppings, interspersed with
areas of white gravel beach. The water
is shallow and the bottom can be seen
clearly from the shore for several yards
out into the bay.
Pelicans, cormorants, and gulls live
on large off-shore granite boulders, be
yond which lie large beds of kelp, the
habitat of many of the organisms
which scientists at the station study. In
. yclical patterns, large breakers hit the
outer rocks and great sprays of white
foam rise up. Occasionally a band of
sea otters swim just beyond the rocks.
This summer 80-100 undergraduate
students, 15 graduate students. 6 full
time faculty members and 3 emeritus
professors are doing research at the sta
tion. Visiting investigators from all
over the world also study there.
Some of the students at the station
are actually planning to enter the field
of medicine, but are learning valuable
research techniques through the study
of marine biology. Others will go on to
get master's and doctorate degrees in
marine biology, for which they must
do original research under the direction
of an adviser.
Most of the work done at Hopkins
Marine Station is basic research in the

field of marine biology and is not di
rectly pursued with the intent of ap
plying it to medical science or sea agri
culture; however, the possibilities are
good that a discovery made while re
searching basic problems may shed
light on related questions.
Current research at the station deals
with such topics as anti-body forma
tion in invertebrates, physiology and
biochemistry of pigmentation in mar
ine organisms, biochemical events
taking place after fertilization, behav
ioural studies of marine invertebrates,
and ecology of the intertidal-to name
only a few.
In some cases, complex life pro
cesses are more easily studied in rela
tively simple organisms such as marine
invertebrates than in more advanced
forms of life.
The Te Vega, a 135-foot teaching
research schooner adds to the facilities
of the station. She carries about 15 sci
entists on her voyages to nearly all
parts of the world. Currently the Te
Vega is moored off the coast of South
America where the scientists are study
ing the flora and fauna of the region.
A new 5.5 million dollar building is
currently being planned for Hopkins
Marine. One old laboratory and class
room building. Agassiz, built in 1918,
will be torn down to make room for
the new building.
The architect, Ernest Kump was
given free artistic license in designing
the building. Because most of the
buildings currently standing at Hopkins
Marine Station are rather old buildings
that will be replaced by the new one or
else structures erected for temporary
use, the architect was unhindered by
preestablished architectural styles of
other buildings on the site.
The new laboratory and classroom
building will be both beautiful and
functional. Built of steel and pre-cast
cement, the structure will have exten
sive windows, oriented to the area of

the intertidal providing constant visual
contact with the shore from the lab
and classroom.
Although the project is currently in
a state of temporary abeyance due to
lack of federal and private funds, it is
hoped that the building will be ready
for use by 1971.

that will be replaced by the new one or
else structures erected for temporary
use, the architect was unhindered by
preestablished architectural styles of
other buildings on the site.
The new laboratory and classroom
building will be both beautiful and
functional. Built of steel and pre-cast
cement, the structure will have exten
sive windows, oriented to the area of

the intertidal providing constant visual
contact with the shore from the lab
and classroom.
Although the project is currently in
a state of temporary abeyance due to
lack of federal and private funds, it is
hoped that the building will be ready
for use by 1971.
The Biological Laboratory at Pacific
Grove is an arm of Stanford Univer
sity's Biological Sciences Department
located on Monterey Bay in Pacific
Grove. This station, founded in 1892
was the first to be established on the
American Pacific Coast.
The station itself is located on
Monterey Bay, an area of unusually
'nindant marine life. The shore line
ajound the station is one of rugged
granite outcroppings, interspersed with
areas of white gravel beach. The water
is shallow and the bottom can be seen
clearly from the shore for several yards
out into the bay.
Pelicans, cormorants, and gulls live
on large off-shore granite boulders, be
yond which lie large beds of kelp, the
habitat of many of the organisms
which scientists at the station study. In
. yclical patterns, large breakers hit the
outer rocks and great sprays of white
foam rise up. Occasionally a band of
sea otters swim just beyond the rocks.
This summer 80-100 undergraduate
students, 15 graduate students. 6 full
time faculty members and 3 emeritus
professors are doing research at the sta
tion. Visiting investigators from all
over the world also study there.
Some of the students at the station
are actually planning to enter the field
of medicine, but are learning valuable
research techniques through the study
of marine biology. Others will go on to
get master's and doctorate degrees in
marine biology, for which they must
do original research under the direction
of an adviser.
Most of the work done at Hopkins
Marine Station is basic research in the

field of marine biology and is not di
rectly pursued with the intent of ap
plying it to medical science or sea agri
culture; however, the possibilities are
good that a discovery made while re
searching basic problems may shed
light on related questions.
Current research at the station deals
with such topics as anti-body forma
tion in invertebrates, physiology and
biochemistry of pigmentation in mar
ine organisms, biochemical events
taking place after fertilization, behav
ioural studies of marine invertebrates,
and ecology of the intertidal-to name
only a few.
In some cases, complex life pro
cesses are more easily studied in rela
tively simple organisms such as marine
invertebrates than in more advanced
forms of life.
The Te Vega, a 135-foot teaching
research schooner adds to the facilities
of the station. She carries about 15 sci
entists on her voyages to nearly all
parts of the world. Currently the Te
Vega is moored off the coast of South
America where the scientists are study
ing the flora and fauna of the region.
A new 5.5 million dollar building is
currently being planned for Hopkins
Marine. One old laboratory and class
room building. Agassiz, built in 1918,
will be torn down to make room for
the new building.
The architect, Ernest Kump was
given free artistic license in designing
the building. Because most of the
buildings currently standing at Hopkins
Marine Station are rather old buildings
that will be replaced by the new one or
else structures erected for temporary
use, the architect was unhindered by
preestablished architectural styles of
