# What Lyman Sees Ahead
## 
### DANIEL SNELL 
Does the Trustees' tough pronoun-!
cement after the May sit-in mean that
the administration would send in
police as soon as sit-inners took posses
sion of a building in the future?
University Provost Richard Lyman,
second in command of the academic
programs at Stanford says it would de
pend entirely on the situation.
"It would be very easy to say that
given a specific situation, we would re
spond with X or Y," he said wryly.
"But it usually works out that X is
really X-l or X+3, and Y just isn't
practical at the moment."
Though he cited the presence of Re
serve Officer Training Corps (ROTC)
courses on campus, a student role on
the presidential selection committee,
and student participation in the
newly-formed Academic Senate as
issues which might boil up into protest,
Lyman says, "You can't forsee all of
the issues that might lead to unrest."
He pointed out that in the history
of the labor movement, which is his
teaching specialty, demonstrations
have grown out of concrete episodes

that seemed to involve injustice. Lead
ers then develop a list of demands or
goals during the demonstration that
keeps the movement going.
"You really can't tell where one of
those episodes might crop up," Lyman
said. And the administration cannot
really be expected to go about plugging
all the possible loopholes that might
someday cause a demonstration, he
said.
But administrators and faculty arc
going ahead in trying to straighten out
some of the problems of the Univer
sity. Lyman said the student-faculty
Committee on Undergraduate Educa
tion was now considering the role of
ROTC on campus. He said he could
not be sure when the committee would
report, but he hoped their recommend
ation would be made soon.
Lyman doubted that increased com
munication would be able completely
to avert student unrest, though it might
help. He said there would always be a
group of students-a very small group
of students-who will be interested in
disrupting the University.
He said to believe that communica
tion was the final answer to the Univer
sity's problems is to ignore the very
real conflicts of interest that arc bound
to exist in this or any other large social
organism.
He complained that many students
do not understand why demonstrations
like the sit-in arc really incompatible
with a University community. He said
a university should be a place of ration
al discussion in which confrontation
tactics have no place.
The provost admitted that the Uni

versity's demonstration policy is un
clear.
The Interim Judicial Body (IJB) in
trying to enforce that policy recom
mended suspension of seven students
who were involved in a demonstration
against a Central Intelligence Agency
recruiter in November, 1967. The re
commendation sparked the May dem
onstration, in which the Old Union was
occupied for 56 hours by demonstra
tors ranging in number from 100 to
400 until the faculty Academic Coun
cil voted against the suspensions and
asked for the abolition of the IJB.
Lyman said a more concise policy
would be made public early fall quar
ter. And a permanent demonstrations
policy would be one of the first orders
on the agenda of the student-faculty
Legislative Council when and i- the


Council is approved by the students,
Lyman said.
lie did not feel that having an acting
president next fall would delay decis
ions on important issues affecting the
future of the University. Me admitted
that because of the interim nature of
the acting president's appointment, he
will be less powerful than a permanent
president.
"But nobody's going to stand still
because of that," Lyman said. "Both
(Acting President) Glaser and 1 arc
rather impatient men, and we are not
going to stand still."
The provost said he believed Glaser
and he would work well together, and
Glaser has said that he will consult
closely with Lyman and the rest of the
president's advisers during his tenure as
acting president.
Lyman attacked the "facile" notion
that some students and professors have
that the University could get on very
well without administrators. He said
the time of the provost and his staff
was always busy with consideration of
problems like the negotiations with the
National Science Foundation about
payment for overhead costs of spec
ially funded projects.
If there were not good minds work
ing on adminstrativc problems, Lyman
said, it would be very difficult indeed
to keep the University's academic pro
grams running at their present level.

Lyman says, "You can't forsee all of
the issues that might lead to unrest."
He pointed out that in the history
of the labor movement, which is his
teaching specialty, demonstrations
have grown out of concrete episodes

that seemed to involve injustice. Lead
ers then develop a list of demands or
goals during the demonstration that
keeps the movement going.
"You really can't tell where one of
those episodes might crop up," Lyman
said. And the administration cannot
really be expected to go about plugging
all the possible loopholes that might
someday cause a demonstration, he
said.
But administrators and faculty arc
going ahead in trying to straighten out
some of the problems of the Univer
sity. Lyman said the student-faculty
Committee on Undergraduate Educa
tion was now considering the role of
ROTC on campus. He said he could
not be sure when the committee would
report, but he hoped their recommend
ation would be made soon.
Lyman doubted that increased com
munication would be able completely
to avert student unrest, though it might
help. He said there would always be a
group of students-a very small group
of students-who will be interested in
disrupting the University.
He said to believe that communica
tion was the final answer to the Univer
sity's problems is to ignore the very
real conflicts of interest that arc bound
to exist in this or any other large social
organism.
He complained that many students
do not understand why demonstrations
like the sit-in arc really incompatible
with a University community. He said
a university should be a place of ration
al discussion in which confrontation
tactics have no place.
The provost admitted that the Uni

versity's demonstration policy is un
clear.
The Interim Judicial Body (IJB) in
trying to enforce that policy recom
mended suspension of seven students
who were involved in a demonstration
against a Central Intelligence Agency
recruiter in November, 1967. The re
commendation sparked the May dem
onstration, in which the Old Union was
occupied for 56 hours by demonstra
tors ranging in number from 100 to
400 until the faculty Academic Coun
cil voted against the suspensions and
asked for the abolition of the IJB.
Lyman said a more concise policy
would be made public early fall quar
ter. And a permanent demonstrations
policy would be one of the first orders
on the agenda of the student-faculty
Legislative Council when and i- the


Council is approved by the students,
Lyman said.

president next fall would delay decis

future of the University. Me admitted
that because of the interim nature of
the acting president's appointment, he
will be less powerful than a permanent
president.
"But nobody's going to stand still
because of that," Lyman said. "Both
(Acting President) Glaser and 1 arc
rather impatient men, and we are not
going to stand still."
The provost said he believed Glaser
and he would work well together, and
Glaser has said that he will consult
closely with Lyman and the rest of the
president's advisers during his tenure as
acting president.
Lyman attacked the "facile" notion
that some students and professors have
that the University could get on very
well without administrators. He said
the time of the provost and his staff
was always busy with consideration of
problems like the negotiations with the
National Science Foundation about
payment for overhead costs of spec
ially funded projects.
If there were not good minds work
ing on adminstrativc problems, Lyman
said, it would be very difficult indeed
to keep the University's academic pro
grams running at their present level.
Does the Trustees' tough pronoun-!
cement after the May sit-in mean that
the administration would send in
police as soon as sit-inners took posses
sion of a building in the future?
University Provost Richard Lyman,
second in command of the academic
programs at Stanford says it would de
pend entirely on the situation.
"It would be very easy to say that
given a specific situation, we would re
spond with X or Y," he said wryly.
"But it usually works out that X is
really X-l or X+3, and Y just isn't
practical at the moment."
