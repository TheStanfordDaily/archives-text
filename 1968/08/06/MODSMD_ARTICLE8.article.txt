## Ed Council Asks Student Voice 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The Executive Committee of the
Education Council, which is the stu
dent association in the School of Edu
cation, has voted unanimously in
support of the proposition that stu
dents should have both voice and vote
on the committee that is preparing to
recommend to the Trustees the next
president of Stanford University.
We applaud the efforts of our stu
dent body president in behalf of this
proposition. We appeal to those with
authority in this matter to recognize
the legitimate role that students have
in the presidential selection process
and to work with responsible student
leaders like Denis Hayes in developing
a plan whereby students may have vot
ing representation.
I believe that the fears of some
faculty that students will not prove
trustworthy for such a task arc un
grounded. Indeed, some graduate stu
dents are older than some faculty
members, and equally mature. I find it
distressing to sec a lack of trust in stu
dents just because they are students.
Many professors are receiving some of
their best ideas from students and are
benefiting almost daily from decisions
that students have made. The univer
sity stands to gain, not lose, by student
participation on the presidential search
committee.
None of us wishes to sec this issue
ignite more of what happened last
spring. I would suggest to students who
do not want power confrontations that
they give their support now in their
local groups and through these col
umns to responsible student leaders as
they seek to bring about change.

• Pope's Decision
Editor, The Daily:
Pope Paul Vl's long-awaited encycli
cal on birth control ("Of Human Life,"
Times, July 30) is notable for inter
alia, its utterly unconvincing attempt
to provide a ground for making a sharp
moral distinction between "(natural)
recourse to the infccund periods" and
"the use of (artificial) means directly
contrary to fecundation" (16).
To see this, one need only note,
first of all, the Pontiff's earlier state
ment (14): "Similarly excluded is
every action which, either in anticipa
tion of the conjugal act or in its ac
complishment . . . proposes, whether as
an end or as a means, to render pro
creation impossible".
For it is clear that "recourse to the
infccund periods" invariable involves
actions (e.g. keeping charts, calendars,
graphs, etc.) which "in anticipation of
the conjugal act . . . propose ... as a
means, to render procreation impossi
ble." This points up the essential ident
ity of the intentions involved in exer
cising both methods of birth control;
both involve a couple in actions which
fall within the scope of the Pope's uni
versal proscription. .
In addition, His Holiness attempts
to ground the alleged moral distinction
between the two methods on the
'natural/artificial' dichotomy: in the
former the married couple make legiti
mate use of a natural disposition; in
the latter, they impede the develop
ment of natural processes" (16).
This, however, will not do. For is
not the desire to achieve sexual com
munion apart from the production of
progeny also a "natural disposition"?
It is on any ordinary reading of this
expression. But, then, one has come to
learn that the meaning of the term
"natural" is notoriously ambiguous in
the teleological framework of Aristo
telian-Thomistic metaphysics.
Finally, if the mere fact that an act
"impedes the development of natural
processes" warrants the conclusion
that it is morally evil, then, by parity
of reasoning, it follows that the Pontiff
is logically committed to viewing as
morally evil acts such as heart trans
plants or any other actions by doctors
which "impede" (stop, frustrate, fore
stall, etc.) the "development of the
natural processes" of aging, which cul
minates, interestingly enough, in
'natural death'.
The palpable absurdity of this con
clusion should elicit renunciation of
the general principle from which it is
(logically) derived.

! • Draft Counselor
' Editor, The Daily:
| While much of a recent convcrsa
-1 tion with DAILY Editor Dan Sncll was
j correctly reported (DAILY, July 23), I
would like to correct several factual
errors and clarify what may have been
< some misleading impressions.
j First, I am employed by the Dean
I of Students Office as a counselor for
conscientious objectors and for those
„ who cannot conscientiously participate

in the armed forces nor cooperate with
the Selective Service; I am not employ
ed as a counselor in Stanford's Nation
al Service Office.
Secondly, figures about estimated
future draft quotas were incorrectly re
ported. I citeJ the estimate recently
published in the New York Times
Review of Books (June 20, 1968) that
because of the sharp fall-off in recnlist
ments, particularly among minority
group members, draft calls may ap
proach 800,000 men during the next
twelve months. If this proves true,
monthly quotas will run 75,000 men
more than double the average monthly
quotas during the past twelve months.
(In the light of a probably long range
increase in draft call-ups, it is interest
ing to note the sharply reduced num
ber of inductions scheduled for this
summer and the apparent national
moratorium until October on pre
induction physicals-a prerequisite in
all but special cases to an order for in
duction.)
And finally, the headline and sever
al paragraphs in the article may have
given the impression that most Stan
ford men we have talked with think
unrealistically and romantically about
the draft and about the alternatives
they see if they find their draft obli
gations unconscionable and unaccept
able, and that it is the job of the coun
selor to straighten them out. This has
definitely not been my experience
during the past year at Stanford, nor
docs this correctly convey the purpose
of draft counseling.
Most men I have talked with this
year clearly have thought long and
hard about their relationship to the
draft, and in fact many of their prob
lems arise because of the honesty and
candor with which they examine their
own beliefs and their own situation.
The whole process of responding to
the draft is often intimately related to
defining who one is and what one's
own beliefs and values really mean in
terms of action and behavior. As
Tolstoy noted years ago, the call to
military service confronts a person
with one of those moments in his life
"in which he can know himself, tell
himself who he is . . . (and) behave as a
morally free individual."
There are, of course, many roman
tic and unrealistic ideas concerning al
ternatives floating about-usually based
on misinformation or lack of informa
tion. When encountered, these ideas
should as far as possible be illuminated
by current factual information and by
questions relevant to each alternative
being considered.
That, I take it, is the purpose of
counseling: so that each man is in a
better position to make his own deci
sion based on full and accurate infor
mation. having examined the issues in
volved in the alternatives he may
choose to weigh.

progeny also a "natural disposition"?
It is on any ordinary reading of this
expression. But, then, one has come to
learn that the meaning of the term
"natural" is notoriously ambiguous in
the teleological framework of Aristo
telian-Thomistic metaphysics.
Finally, if the mere fact that an act
"impedes the development of natural
processes" warrants the conclusion
that it is morally evil, then, by parity
of reasoning, it follows that the Pontiff
is logically committed to viewing as
morally evil acts such as heart trans
plants or any other actions by doctors
which "impede" (stop, frustrate, fore
stall, etc.) the "development of the
natural processes" of aging, which cul
minates, interestingly enough, in
'natural death'.
The palpable absurdity of this con
clusion should elicit renunciation of
the general principle from which it is
(logically) derived.

' Editor, The Daily:
| While much of a recent convcrsa
-1 tion with DAILY Editor Dan Sncll was
j correctly reported (DAILY, July 23), I
would like to correct several factual
errors and clarify what may have been
< some misleading impressions.
j First, I am employed by the Dean
I of Students Office as a counselor for
conscientious objectors and for those
„ who cannot conscientiously participate

in the armed forces nor cooperate with
the Selective Service; I am not employ
ed as a counselor in Stanford's Nation
al Service Office.
Secondly, figures about estimated
future draft quotas were incorrectly re
ported. I citeJ the estimate recently
published in the New York Times
Review of Books (June 20, 1968) that
because of the sharp fall-off in recnlist
ments, particularly among minority
group members, draft calls may ap
proach 800,000 men during the next
twelve months. If this proves true,
monthly quotas will run 75,000 men
more than double the average monthly
quotas during the past twelve months.
(In the light of a probably long range
increase in draft call-ups, it is interest
ing to note the sharply reduced num
ber of inductions scheduled for this
summer and the apparent national
moratorium until October on pre
induction physicals-a prerequisite in
all but special cases to an order for in
duction.)
And finally, the headline and sever
al paragraphs in the article may have
given the impression that most Stan
ford men we have talked with think
unrealistically and romantically about
the draft and about the alternatives
they see if they find their draft obli
gations unconscionable and unaccept
able, and that it is the job of the coun
selor to straighten them out. This has
definitely not been my experience
during the past year at Stanford, nor
docs this correctly convey the purpose
of draft counseling.
Most men I have talked with this
year clearly have thought long and
hard about their relationship to the
draft, and in fact many of their prob
lems arise because of the honesty and
candor with which they examine their
own beliefs and their own situation.
The whole process of responding to
the draft is often intimately related to
defining who one is and what one's
own beliefs and values really mean in
terms of action and behavior. As
Tolstoy noted years ago, the call to
military service confronts a person
with one of those moments in his life
"in which he can know himself, tell
himself who he is . . . (and) behave as a
morally free individual."
There are, of course, many roman
tic and unrealistic ideas concerning al
ternatives floating about-usually based
on misinformation or lack of informa
tion. When encountered, these ideas
should as far as possible be illuminated
by current factual information and by
questions relevant to each alternative
being considered.
That, I take it, is the purpose of
counseling: so that each man is in a
better position to make his own deci
sion based on full and accurate infor
mation. having examined the issues in
volved in the alternatives he may
choose to weigh.

proposition. We appeal to those with
authority in this matter to recognize
the legitimate role that students have
in the presidential selection process
and to work with responsible student
leaders like Denis Hayes in developing
a plan whereby students may have vot

I believe that the fears of some
faculty that students will not prove
trustworthy for such a task arc un
grounded. Indeed, some graduate stu

distressing to sec a lack of trust in stu

Many professors are receiving some of
their best ideas from students and are
benefiting almost daily from decisions
that students have made. The univer

participation on the presidential search

• Pope's Decision
Editor, The Daily:
Pope Paul Vl's long-awaited encycli
cal on birth control ("Of Human Life,"
Times, July 30) is notable for inter
alia, its utterly unconvincing attempt
to provide a ground for making a sharp
moral distinction between "(natural)
recourse to the infccund periods" and
"the use of (artificial) means directly
contrary to fecundation" (16).
To see this, one need only note,
first of all, the Pontiff's earlier state
ment (14): "Similarly excluded is
every action which, either in anticipa
tion of the conjugal act or in its ac
complishment . . . proposes, whether as
an end or as a means, to render pro
creation impossible".
For it is clear that "recourse to the
infccund periods" invariable involves
actions (e.g. keeping charts, calendars,
graphs, etc.) which "in anticipation of
the conjugal act . . . propose ... as a
means, to render procreation impossi
ble." This points up the essential ident
ity of the intentions involved in exer
cising both methods of birth control;
both involve a couple in actions which
fall within the scope of the Pope's uni
versal proscription. .
In addition, His Holiness attempts
to ground the alleged moral distinction
between the two methods on the
'natural/artificial' dichotomy: in the
former the married couple make legiti
mate use of a natural disposition; in
the latter, they impede the develop
ment of natural processes" (16).
This, however, will not do. For is
not the desire to achieve sexual com
munion apart from the production of
progeny also a "natural disposition"?
It is on any ordinary reading of this
expression. But, then, one has come to

the draft is often intimately related to
defining who one is and what one's
own beliefs and values really mean in
terms of action and behavior. As
Tolstoy noted years ago, the call to
military service confronts a person
with one of those moments in his life
"in which he can know himself, tell
himself who he is . . . (and) behave as a
morally free individual."
There are, of course, many roman
tic and unrealistic ideas concerning al
ternatives floating about-usually based
on misinformation or lack of informa
tion. When encountered, these ideas
should as far as possible be illuminated
by current factual information and by
questions relevant to each alternative
being considered.
That, I take it, is the purpose of
counseling: so that each man is in a
better position to make his own deci
sion based on full and accurate infor
mation. having examined the issues in
volved in the alternatives he may
choose to weigh.

support of the proposition that stu

on the committee that is preparing to

proposition. We appeal to those with
authority in this matter to recognize
the legitimate role that students have
in the presidential selection process
and to work with responsible student
leaders like Denis Hayes in developing
a plan whereby students may have vot

I believe that the fears of some
faculty that students will not prove
trustworthy for such a task arc un
grounded. Indeed, some graduate stu

members, and equally mature. I find it
distressing to sec a lack of trust in stu

Many professors are receiving some of
their best ideas from students and are
benefiting almost daily from decisions
that students have made. The univer

participation on the presidential search
committee.
None of us wishes to sec this issue

local groups and through these col

• Pope's Decision
Editor, The Daily:
Pope Paul Vl's long-awaited encycli
cal on birth control ("Of Human Life,"
Times, July 30) is notable for inter
alia, its utterly unconvincing attempt
to provide a ground for making a sharp
moral distinction between "(natural)
recourse to the infccund periods" and
"the use of (artificial) means directly
contrary to fecundation" (16).
To see this, one need only note,
first of all, the Pontiff's earlier state
ment (14): "Similarly excluded is
every action which, either in anticipa
tion of the conjugal act or in its ac
complishment . . . proposes, whether as
an end or as a means, to render pro
creation impossible".
For it is clear that "recourse to the
infccund periods" invariable involves
actions (e.g. keeping charts, calendars,
graphs, etc.) which "in anticipation of
the conjugal act . . . propose ... as a
means, to render procreation impossi
ble." This points up the essential ident
ity of the intentions involved in exer
cising both methods of birth control;
both involve a couple in actions which
fall within the scope of the Pope's uni
versal proscription. .
In addition, His Holiness attempts
to ground the alleged moral distinction
between the two methods on the
'natural/artificial' dichotomy: in the
former the married couple make legiti
mate use of a natural disposition; in
the latter, they impede the develop
ment of natural processes" (16).
This, however, will not do. For is
not the desire to achieve sexual com
munion apart from the production of
progeny also a "natural disposition"?
It is on any ordinary reading of this
expression. But, then, one has come to
learn that the meaning of the term
"natural" is notoriously ambiguous in
the teleological framework of Aristo
telian-Thomistic metaphysics.
Finally, if the mere fact that an act
"impedes the development of natural
processes" warrants the conclusion
that it is morally evil, then, by parity
of reasoning, it follows that the Pontiff
is logically committed to viewing as
morally evil acts such as heart trans
plants or any other actions by doctors
which "impede" (stop, frustrate, fore
stall, etc.) the "development of the
natural processes" of aging, which cul
minates, interestingly enough, in
'natural death'.
The palpable absurdity of this con
clusion should elicit renunciation of
the general principle from which it is
(logically) derived.

| While much of a recent convcrsa
-1 tion with DAILY Editor Dan Sncll was
j correctly reported (DAILY, July 23), I
would like to correct several factual
errors and clarify what may have been
< some misleading impressions.
j First, I am employed by the Dean
I of Students Office as a counselor for
conscientious objectors and for those
„ who cannot conscientiously participate

in the armed forces nor cooperate with
the Selective Service; I am not employ
ed as a counselor in Stanford's Nation
al Service Office.
Secondly, figures about estimated
future draft quotas were incorrectly re
ported. I citeJ the estimate recently
published in the New York Times
Review of Books (June 20, 1968) that
because of the sharp fall-off in recnlist
ments, particularly among minority
group members, draft calls may ap
proach 800,000 men during the next
twelve months. If this proves true,
monthly quotas will run 75,000 men
more than double the average monthly
quotas during the past twelve months.
(In the light of a probably long range
increase in draft call-ups, it is interest
ing to note the sharply reduced num
ber of inductions scheduled for this
summer and the apparent national
moratorium until October on pre
induction physicals-a prerequisite in
all but special cases to an order for in
duction.)
And finally, the headline and sever
al paragraphs in the article may have
given the impression that most Stan
ford men we have talked with think
unrealistically and romantically about
the draft and about the alternatives
they see if they find their draft obli
gations unconscionable and unaccept
able, and that it is the job of the coun
selor to straighten them out. This has
definitely not been my experience
during the past year at Stanford, nor
docs this correctly convey the purpose
of draft counseling.
Most men I have talked with this
year clearly have thought long and
hard about their relationship to the
draft, and in fact many of their prob
lems arise because of the honesty and
candor with which they examine their
own beliefs and their own situation.

an end or as a means, to render pro
creation impossible".
For it is clear that "recourse to the
infccund periods" invariable involves
actions (e.g. keeping charts, calendars,
graphs, etc.) which "in anticipation of
the conjugal act . . . propose ... as a
means, to render procreation impossi
ble." This points up the essential ident
ity of the intentions involved in exer
cising both methods of birth control;
both involve a couple in actions which
fall within the scope of the Pope's uni
versal proscription. .
In addition, His Holiness attempts
to ground the alleged moral distinction
between the two methods on the
'natural/artificial' dichotomy: in the
former the married couple make legiti
mate use of a natural disposition; in
the latter, they impede the develop
ment of natural processes" (16).
This, however, will not do. For is
not the desire to achieve sexual com
munion apart from the production of
progeny also a "natural disposition"?
It is on any ordinary reading of this
expression. But, then, one has come to
learn that the meaning of the term
"natural" is notoriously ambiguous in
the teleological framework of Aristo
telian-Thomistic metaphysics.
Finally, if the mere fact that an act
"impedes the development of natural
processes" warrants the conclusion
that it is morally evil, then, by parity
of reasoning, it follows that the Pontiff
is logically committed to viewing as
morally evil acts such as heart trans
plants or any other actions by doctors
which "impede" (stop, frustrate, fore
stall, etc.) the "development of the
natural processes" of aging, which cul
minates, interestingly enough, in
'natural death'.
The palpable absurdity of this con
clusion should elicit renunciation of
the general principle from which it is
(logically) derived.

! • Draft Counselor
' Editor, The Daily:
| While much of a recent convcrsa
-1 tion with DAILY Editor Dan Sncll was
j correctly reported (DAILY, July 23), I
would like to correct several factual
errors and clarify what may have been
< some misleading impressions.
j First, I am employed by the Dean
I of Students Office as a counselor for
conscientious objectors and for those
„ who cannot conscientiously participate

in the armed forces nor cooperate with
the Selective Service; I am not employ
ed as a counselor in Stanford's Nation
al Service Office.
Secondly, figures about estimated
future draft quotas were incorrectly re
ported. I citeJ the estimate recently
published in the New York Times
Review of Books (June 20, 1968) that
because of the sharp fall-off in recnlist
ments, particularly among minority
group members, draft calls may ap
proach 800,000 men during the next
twelve months. If this proves true,
monthly quotas will run 75,000 men
more than double the average monthly
quotas during the past twelve months.
(In the light of a probably long range
increase in draft call-ups, it is interest
ing to note the sharply reduced num
ber of inductions scheduled for this
summer and the apparent national
moratorium until October on pre
induction physicals-a prerequisite in
all but special cases to an order for in
duction.)
And finally, the headline and sever
al paragraphs in the article may have
given the impression that most Stan
ford men we have talked with think
unrealistically and romantically about
the draft and about the alternatives
they see if they find their draft obli
gations unconscionable and unaccept
able, and that it is the job of the coun
selor to straighten them out. This has
definitely not been my experience
during the past year at Stanford, nor
docs this correctly convey the purpose
of draft counseling.
Most men I have talked with this
year clearly have thought long and
hard about their relationship to the
draft, and in fact many of their prob
lems arise because of the honesty and
candor with which they examine their
own beliefs and their own situation.
The whole process of responding to
the draft is often intimately related to
defining who one is and what one's
own beliefs and values really mean in
terms of action and behavior. As
Tolstoy noted years ago, the call to
military service confronts a person
with one of those moments in his life
"in which he can know himself, tell
himself who he is . . . (and) behave as a
morally free individual."
There are, of course, many roman
tic and unrealistic ideas concerning al
ternatives floating about-usually based
on misinformation or lack of informa
tion. When encountered, these ideas
should as far as possible be illuminated
by current factual information and by
questions relevant to each alternative
being considered.
That, I take it, is the purpose of
counseling: so that each man is in a
better position to make his own deci
sion based on full and accurate infor
mation. having examined the issues in
volved in the alternatives he may
choose to weigh.
