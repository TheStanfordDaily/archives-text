# The 						Nebbish Speaks
## A 						Little-Known Candidate 
### Marshall Schwartz 
The DAILY, has managed to obtain
an interview with one of the lesser
known aspirants to our nation's highest
office, Ralph Peabody, candidate of
the Know-everything Party. The text
follows.
* * *
DAILY: Mr. Peabody, what is your
party's platform?
Peabody: It's very simple. It's em
bodied in the name of the party. We

know everything. We have the solution
to all the nation's ills. Therefore, we
should be elected.
D: Well, if you have all the answers,
why don't you reveal them to the rest
of the country so we can benefit by
your great knowledge?
P: What? The other candidates
would grab up the solutions and we'd
lose our advantage.
D: I see. How did you people find
these answers, solutions which have
been evading the rest of us for years?
P: It is a rather complex method.
We examine the entrails of various ani
hnals. Sometimes donkeys, sometimes
elephants, and occasionally eagles.
D: Quite true. To get to another
topic, how do you expect to win if so
few people have heard of you?
P: Being well-known by the voters
doesn't help. Johnson certainly is
known and 1 dare say Dick Gregory
would beat him. Being well liked by
the electorate does no good. Look at
McCarthy and Rockefeller. The solu
tion is very simple. Work on the Elec
toral College. They're the only ones
who count.
D: A very unique approach.
P: But only a slight extension of
present methods.
D: True. Even though you say the
voters don't have to know you, what
happens when you have to deal with
heads of foreign countries:
P:Bribe them-er, give them foreign
aid. It always seems to do the trick.
Oh, but now I'm giving you part of our
plans. I'll have to watch it.
D: Then you really do have ans
wers? What about Vietnam? You have
a solution acceptable to all parties?
P: Of course.
D: But that seems impossible.
P: Of course not. When we exam
ined the entrails of the elephant-a
white one, of course-the intestines
were bloated with hot air. That was
done, by the way, when the Paris Peace

Talks began. This discovery, coupled
with the fact that Venus was in the
ascension, it was high tide at Hyannis
port, and the temperature in Moscow,
Idaho was the same as in Moscow,
U.S.S.R., proved conclusively there
was a solution. But, naturally, 1 can't
tell you how we arrived at that.
D: Naturally. In examining the en
trails, did you also discover whom your
opposition would be in NOvember?
P: Not that way. We used a crystal
ball for that.
D: Why a crystal ball?
P: Isn't that what everyone else is
using?

were bloated with hot air. That was
done, by the way, when the Paris Peace

Talks began. This discovery, coupled
with the fact that Venus was in the
ascension, it was high tide at Hyannis
port, and the temperature in Moscow,
Idaho was the same as in Moscow,
U.S.S.R., proved conclusively there
was a solution. But, naturally, 1 can't
tell you how we arrived at that.
D: Naturally. In examining the en
trails, did you also discover whom your
opposition would be in NOvember?
P: Not that way. We used a crystal
ball for that.
D: Why a crystal ball?
P: Isn't that what everyone else is
using?
The DAILY, has managed to obtain
an interview with one of the lesser
known aspirants to our nation's highest
office, Ralph Peabody, candidate of
the Know-everything Party. The text
follows.
* * *
DAILY: Mr. Peabody, what is your
party's platform?
Peabody: It's very simple. It's em
bodied in the name of the party. We

know everything. We have the solution
to all the nation's ills. Therefore, we
should be elected.
D: Well, if you have all the answers,
why don't you reveal them to the rest
of the country so we can benefit by
your great knowledge?
P: What? The other candidates
would grab up the solutions and we'd
lose our advantage.
D: I see. How did you people find
these answers, solutions which have
been evading the rest of us for years?
P: It is a rather complex method.
We examine the entrails of various ani
hnals. Sometimes donkeys, sometimes
elephants, and occasionally eagles.
D: Quite true. To get to another
topic, how do you expect to win if so
few people have heard of you?
P: Being well-known by the voters
doesn't help. Johnson certainly is
known and 1 dare say Dick Gregory
would beat him. Being well liked by
the electorate does no good. Look at
McCarthy and Rockefeller. The solu
tion is very simple. Work on the Elec
toral College. They're the only ones
who count.
D: A very unique approach.
P: But only a slight extension of
present methods.
D: True. Even though you say the
voters don't have to know you, what
happens when you have to deal with
heads of foreign countries:
P:Bribe them-er, give them foreign
aid. It always seems to do the trick.
Oh, but now I'm giving you part of our
plans. I'll have to watch it.
D: Then you really do have ans
wers? What about Vietnam? You have
a solution acceptable to all parties?
P: Of course.
D: But that seems impossible.
P: Of course not. When we exam
ined the entrails of the elephant-a
white one, of course-the intestines
were bloated with hot air. That was
done, by the way, when the Paris Peace
