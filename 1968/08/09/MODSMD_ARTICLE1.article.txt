# Summer Faces
## Festival Future Unsure: Art Not Always Profitable

"> 4 book performers for artistic reasons and
not for good business," Stephen Baffrey, produ
cer of the Stanford Summer Festivals of the Arts,
told the DAILY.
What we consider a good attraction may be
artistic success, but a budgetary failure."
Sensational hits at Stanford so far this season
have been the Joffrey Ballet, Preservation Hall
Jazz Band, and the New York Pro Musica.
Groups that did not do as well financially as ex
pected were the APA Repertory Theater Com
pany and Ravi Shankar's "Festival from India."
Baffrey cited as one of the purposes of the
Summer Festival the development of a more
appreciative audience for the arts. In order to
enliven the audience's cultural tastes, most of the
artists are expected to hold audience briefings
during which they give interpretation of their
work, and answer questions about it.
The Summer Festival Committee, which is
composed of all the department heads in the
humanities, occasionally gambles on bringing rel
atively unknown talent to the campus.
One such artist is Isabel Rivas, a young Span
ish opera star who made her American debut last
Saturday night at Dinkelspiel Auditorium, and
who received rave reviews in the "San Francisco
Chronicle."
The University does not make money from
the Summer Festivals; it subsidizes it.
The first Summer Festivals, five years ago, be
gan as a gift from an anonymous patron to put a
shine on the summer cultural program. Up to
that time, it had been "in the doldrums," accord
ing to Baffrey.
Since that time it has continued through the
original patron's support of other sponsors, cor
porate donors, and the University.
The idea of the Summer Festival comes from
Europe. The Stanford Festival is partially patter
ned after the Berlin Festival which is held for

three weeks in late September and early October
every year. The Lincoln Center in New York, in
turn, took its idea from Stanford's Festival.
Whether or not there will be another Summer
Festival next year will depend on the list of prior
ities set by the University's Board of Trustees.
Right now, the Stanford Summer Festivals is try
ing to find funds to overcome a budgetary deficit
incurred because of the unexpected financial fail
ure of some events.
A singing grand finale to the 1968 festival,
will be presented in Memorial Auditorium to
night at 8 p.m. by three international concert
vocalists-Simon Estes, Isabel Rivas, and Carolyn
Stanford.
The "Gala" program, according to Festival
Producer Stephen Baffrey, is "really a straw
berries and whipped cream dessert for our 1968
season. The vocalists and we arc very happy with
the idea of bringing them all together for this
event."
The singers will be accompanied by a 36-f>i?ee
professional orchestra in solo and duet renditions
from grand and light opera and Gershwin's
"Porgy and Bess."
Miss Rivas, a soprano, is from Spain and is

making her American debut at Stanford after a
triumphant career in both concert and operatic
singing in Europe and Latin America.
Miss Stanford, also a soprano, is from Phila
delphia, but was trained in Vienna and has sung
throughout Europe, in the Soviet Union, and the
U.S.
Estes, a baritone-bass, has sung with most
major American and German orchestras and
opera companies and is closely identified with
Gunther Shuller's opera "The Visitation."
The Don Ellis Orchestra concert given last
Sunday in Frost Amphitheater, one of the events
not plagued by financial problems, continued the
musical portion of the Festival on a bright note.
Ellis' twenty-two piece orchestra relied heav
ily on a novelty of instruments, using a sitar and
electric guitars, echo devices and a unit connect
ed to Ellis' trumpet which could transform its
sould to that of a saxophone or almost any other
instrument.
One problem, possibly a consequence of the
size of the band, was simply that they were too
loud, overpowering the Stanford Chorus during
most of the four songs which they did together.

during which they give interpretation of their
work, and answer questions about it.
The Summer Festival Committee, which is
composed of all the department heads in the
humanities, occasionally gambles on bringing rel
atively unknown talent to the campus.
One such artist is Isabel Rivas, a young Span
ish opera star who made her American debut last
Saturday night at Dinkelspiel Auditorium, and
who received rave reviews in the "San Francisco
Chronicle."
The University does not make money from
the Summer Festivals; it subsidizes it.
The first Summer Festivals, five years ago, be
gan as a gift from an anonymous patron to put a
shine on the summer cultural program. Up to
that time, it had been "in the doldrums," accord
ing to Baffrey.
Since that time it has continued through the
original patron's support of other sponsors, cor
porate donors, and the University.
The idea of the Summer Festival comes from
Europe. The Stanford Festival is partially patter
ned after the Berlin Festival which is held for

three weeks in late September and early October
every year. The Lincoln Center in New York, in
turn, took its idea from Stanford's Festival.
Whether or not there will be another Summer
Festival next year will depend on the list of prior
ities set by the University's Board of Trustees.
Right now, the Stanford Summer Festivals is try
ing to find funds to overcome a budgetary deficit
incurred because of the unexpected financial fail
ure of some events.
A singing grand finale to the 1968 festival,
will be presented in Memorial Auditorium to
night at 8 p.m. by three international concert
vocalists-Simon Estes, Isabel Rivas, and Carolyn
Stanford.
The "Gala" program, according to Festival
Producer Stephen Baffrey, is "really a straw
berries and whipped cream dessert for our 1968
season. The vocalists and we arc very happy with
the idea of bringing them all together for this
event."
The singers will be accompanied by a 36-f>i?ee
professional orchestra in solo and duet renditions
from grand and light opera and Gershwin's
"Porgy and Bess."
Miss Rivas, a soprano, is from Spain and is

making her American debut at Stanford after a
triumphant career in both concert and operatic
singing in Europe and Latin America.
Miss Stanford, also a soprano, is from Phila
delphia, but was trained in Vienna and has sung
throughout Europe, in the Soviet Union, and the
U.S.
Estes, a baritone-bass, has sung with most
major American and German orchestras and
opera companies and is closely identified with
Gunther Shuller's opera "The Visitation."
The Don Ellis Orchestra concert given last
Sunday in Frost Amphitheater, one of the events
not plagued by financial problems, continued the
musical portion of the Festival on a bright note.
Ellis' twenty-two piece orchestra relied heav
ily on a novelty of instruments, using a sitar and
electric guitars, echo devices and a unit connect
ed to Ellis' trumpet which could transform its
sould to that of a saxophone or almost any other
instrument.
One problem, possibly a consequence of the
size of the band, was simply that they were too
loud, overpowering the Stanford Chorus during
most of the four songs which they did together.




"> 4 book performers for artistic reasons and
not for good business," Stephen Baffrey, produ
cer of the Stanford Summer Festivals of the Arts,
told the DAILY.
What we consider a good attraction may be
artistic success, but a budgetary failure."
Sensational hits at Stanford so far this season
have been the Joffrey Ballet, Preservation Hall
Jazz Band, and the New York Pro Musica.
Groups that did not do as well financially as ex
pected were the APA Repertory Theater Com
pany and Ravi Shankar's "Festival from India."
Baffrey cited as one of the purposes of the
Summer Festival the development of a more
appreciative audience for the arts. In order to
enliven the audience's cultural tastes, most of the
artists are expected to hold audience briefings
during which they give interpretation of their
work, and answer questions about it.
