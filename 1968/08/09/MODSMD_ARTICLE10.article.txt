# A 						Conspiracy Of One
## Conventions: A P.R. Risk? 
### Dan Snell 
My morning's mail Tuesday
brought me an intriguing release from
the B.F. Goodrich Company, cheerful
ly announcing in red, white, and blue
'he fact that Goodrich is sponsoring
'approximately half' of ABC's televis
on coverage of the Republican and
Democratic national conventions this
month.
Not only that, but Goodrich is pre
paring to distribute half a million
copies of a free Presidential election
map through its distributors.
The map, the Goodrich release
crows on, is "of the United States
showing the date each state was ad
mitted to the Union, its capital and
population; photographs and vital sta
tistics of each of the presidents; histor
ies of the two major political parties; a
complete discussion of the procedure
for electing a president (primaries, con
ventions, campaigning, the Electoral
College); and maps and charts illustrat
ing 'How the Country Voted' in 1960
and 1964."
Clearly someone back in New York
has scooped in on a good thing and'
wants to get his company's name close
ly associated with it public relations
wise. How could it go wrong? There
are flags, speeches, parades, under-the
table deals, smoke-filled rooms
evcrything near and dear to the heart
of America.
But what it if didn't work out?

What if the American public suddenly
and finally became so disgusted with
the American political system and es
pecially the childish convention postur
ing that they gave an election and
nobody came?
An inquiring reporter snooping
around Madison Avenue the morning
after the election finds only one execu
tive in. That executive, in shirt-sleeves
and loosened tie, sweating profusely
while drinking what he says is his
twentieth gin and tonic, tries to answer
the reporter's questions:
"Yes, it's true that B.F. Goodrich
sales have plummeted since the end of
the Democratic Convention, reaching a
new low this morning when half our
distributors closed down for good," lie
says.
"When did you first notice that the
sponsoring of the conventions was
hurting your business?" the reporter
asks.
"It all began when we noticed in
the polls that the candidate the Repub

licans nominated was preferred by only
3 perccnt of the people. And our worst
suspicions were confirmed when the
Democratic nominee, Mr. Wallace,
could garner only 2 percent," he
moans.
"Naturally, we sent salesmen out to
the towns and villages of the land, with
loads of our Presidential Election Maps
to try to stir up a little interest in the
campaign," he says.
"Surely that got some response!
from the electorate," the reporter says.
"No, not really. Asa matter of fact,
many of our salesmen became hippies
and haven't been heard from again.
"You know,"the executive waxes
pensive, "it's enough to shake youi
faith in the American system ..."
â€¢ "You mean when nobody shows up
to vote in an election?" the reporter
asks.
"No, 1 mean when a broadly-basec
advertising campaign can't sell some
thing," lie replies.
