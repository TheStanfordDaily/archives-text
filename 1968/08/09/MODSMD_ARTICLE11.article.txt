# The 						Conservative Case
## Population And Freedom 
### Raymond R. White 
As a conservative 1 take as my first
premise the concept that the less pow
er one man has over another the better
it is. Government being a contractural
entity exercising power over all citizens
on behalf of all, directly represents the
power of one man over another.
In effect, then, the less powerful
the government is, the better off every
one is. Certainly a smaller government
means more individual freedom. The
vast growth of governmental powers
and the ensuing growth of agencies,
laws, and taxes has been removing indi
vidual rights at an alarming rate for
many years.
This is especially true in the area of
economic rights. Government control
of our economy has grown and is grow
ing far beyond any reasonable propor
tions, if you take as your starting point
las 1 do) the idea that a man should be
able to be economically free and inde
pendent if he desires to be so.
It is well to point out here that an
economically independent man has
much more freedom (and responsibi-

lity) than a dependent person. It is
much easier for him to enforce his
rights than it is for the dependent man.
The greatest single factor acting to
day to cause the increase in the power
and scope of government is our
tremendous population and its contin
uing growth. The inevitable forces gen
erated by a growing population are in
turn causing more and more regulation
of our private lives by government.
As the absolute size of a problem
grows (whether its relative size does) it
is more and more likely that some
legislation will be pushed to cure the
ill. Whether the problem is actually too
large to be dealt with by the private
sector or not it is likely to wind up
with its own little bureaucracy and a
set of rules (essentially laws) laid down
by that bureaucracy.
The simple growth of highway and
other public projects just to keep up
with the population growth (not to
mention to accommodate increased
use) causes more and more land to dis
appear under pavement at court order

over the protest of the citizens who
would really rather have kept their
land.
The post office is another suffering
example. Garbage collection problems,
urban housing lacks, park and wilder
ness area inadequacies, water shortages,
and all forms of pollution could be al
leviated by a decrease in population
size.
Dozens of other problems, most
either already being inefficiently dealt
with by the government or likely to be
so in a few years, would be mitigated
by any decrease in the population size.
Of course, the best we can hope for
this century is a decrease in the rate of
growth. We can only try to keep the
problems from getting worse very
much faster. The politics of conserva
tism are neither the politics of joy nor
the politics of promises.
Just as the benefits of the public
school system accrue to all citizens and
enhance the efficiency of government
and thereby justify the public support
of schools, so is birth control justifi
able as a public responsibility. Sex edu
cation is gaining wide acceptance as a
part of high school and junior high
school education. This should be so.
Part of the education programs
should involve a meaningful amount of
information about birth control; how
and where to get the necessary items.
It should go without saying that all
welfare programs should include exten
sive and effective birth control clinics
for all recipients.
Only the most irresponsible of per
sons could possibly fail to practice
birth control while not being totally
self supporting. Another area for gov
ernment action is that of research into
better and less expensive methods of
birth control.
Abortion laws should virtually be
abolished.
The results of such steps would
hopefully be to slow down the popula
tion growth to such a rate that govern
ment would not have to expand any
more to accommodate its excesses.
\ny person interested in the preserva
tion of personal liberties in any area
should be foursquare behind govern
ment birth control programs and the
abolition of laws which prevent effect
ive birth control.
No more effective program than
birth control can be imagined to stem
'he loss of our personal freedoms.
