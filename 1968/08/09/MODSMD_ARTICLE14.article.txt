# Has Your Bike Disappeared?
## 
### 
Did you find your bike missing
' from the rack in which you parked it?
Recently, the Physical Plant wasorder
' ed by the University housing manager
to remove tagged bicycles from certain
bicycle racks, but apparently the work
order was incorrectly filled out and
physical plant personnel completely
cleared the racks.
Many students complained to Stan
ford police and the mistake was revea
led as a result.
But often the missing bike problem
is not as easily solved. Relatively few
bikes stolen on campus are recovered.
Of the licensed bikes stolen, only
about ten percent arc recovered. Stolen
bicycles are difficult to trace because
they often leave campus, and only a
missing bicycle report left with Stan
ford police remains.
Bicycles recovered from bushes and
other abandoned bikes found by police
are stored in a quonset hut near the
physical plant. About 25 more reside
behind the police station.
When a bicycle is reported missing,
the most important information is the
frame number-the only positive distin
guishing feature of several otherwise
identical appearing bicycles. The frame
number has settled at least one dis
puted ownership to the satisfaction of
both the police and rightful owner; the
other claimant was obviously not satis
fied with the decision.
