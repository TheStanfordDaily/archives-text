# The Free Phones
## 
### 
Stanford students enjoy a fringe
benefit not generally recognized: fFiey
may use five free telephones on cam
pus for local calls.
Three of these arc the so-called
ASSU "Courtesy" phones, located at
the Old Union, Tresidder Union, and
the Henry Meyer library. The phones
were installed last April, because the
ASSU thought it was ridiculous that
students should spend 10 cents each
time they wanted to make local calls;
"local" means on campus, and off cam
pus numbers beginning with 32, 36,
493, 85, 94, and 96.
Although students almost contin
uously take advantage of this benefit,

costs for all three phones are only
about $45. Probably to symbolize the
free telephones' welfare character,
their color is white.
Financed by the Dean of the Stu
dents' Office, two other free phones
are installed at the Housing Office and
the International Center. According to
the Housing Office, its phone is not for
general use and "should be used only

by those students who seek new
housing."
