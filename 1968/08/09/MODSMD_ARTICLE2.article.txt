# Education Media Clearinghouse Helps Government, Instructors

Too much knowlcdge-that's the problem
faced by the U.S. Government.
An avalanche of research projects since WW ii
has caused a "communication gap," says Dr. Will
iam J. Paisley. He is associate director of the
ERIC Clearinghouse on Educational Media and

technology at Stanford, which is trying to closc
this gap.
"The government began to support research
projects in a big way after the war," says Paisley.
Now there are hundreds and thousands of diso-
rganizcd reports of no use to anyone, he says.
The Clearinghouse at Stanford is one of 17 in
the Educational Resources Informational
■ Clearinghouse (ERIC) network. Each clearing
house focuses on one area of education. The U.S.
Office of Education sponsors and coordinates
this network.
Each clearinghouse collects reports in its own
subject area. These are then abstracted, coded for
easy reference, and sent to the Office of Educa
tion. Here they are stored on computer tape and
prepared for further reference use.
The Stanford Clearinghouse is organizing re
search projects on instructional films, television,
radio, programmed instruction, computer-assisted
instruction, and other audio-visual means of
teaching.
Abstracts of these articles appear monthly in
"Research in Education." Each article can be
ordered from ERIC for 25 cents or 8.4 cents if all
arc ordered. An example: "Inventory Report on
the Future Uses of Educational Television."
Articles are delivered on microfiche. Each
slide may contain 50 to 60 pages. A microfiche
reader is needed. Microfiche is less time
consuming and expensive than microfilm.
The Clearinghouse is trying to "transfer re

search findings into little tidbits of knowledge,"
says Paisley. This will help decision-makers such
as school administrators and teachers, he says.
The project is "unique in the depth of the
audience it can reach," says Paisley. The poten
tial audience is in the millions, he says.
The Clearinghouse will also publish papers
summing up the state of knowledge in different
areas of the field.
