# Final Daily This Summer
## 
### 
This is the last DAILY to be published during
the 1968 Summer Session.
Although there is no official Dead Week dur
ing the summer quarter, the philosophy behind
stopping publication early has always been that
an end to the idle diversion the paper may bring
students will cause them to attack, with renewed
vigor and resilience, the mysteries of scholarship.
In spite of this hogwash, the summer DAIL"
staff wants itself to get down to studying.
The Stanford DAILY will resume daily pubi
cation September 20, the Friday before fall quai
tcr registration.
