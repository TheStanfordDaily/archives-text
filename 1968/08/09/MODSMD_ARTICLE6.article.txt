The one who lias consistently ignored the clear will of the
American people. The one who has shunned the votes of the
young- the Mack, the poor—in short, of anyone who is not of the
middle class.
The one who has no new approach to the problems of the na
tion. w ho speaks only of the repression of crime in the streets and
not of the causes of that crime.
The one who has no revulsion of conscience against the con
tinuation of the vicious war in Vietnam. The one who supports
its escalation.
The one who has made use of innumerable political favors to
get the nomination of his party.
The one whose mere nomination suggests the vast gulf between
the dreams of many Americans and the ability of the political
system to fulfil them.
