## The 						Pope's Puritanism 
### 
The Editor, The Daily:
The Pope's latest encyclical was
only to be expected. The Catholic
Church has suffered from a form of
anti-sexual Puritanism. Sex among the
happily married is a positive pleasure;
yet all things pleasurable-especially if
they are denied to the administrators
of the Catholic empire-are somehow
sinful.
Should the Church open the way
for its married believers to enjoy freely
a pleasure that has since Augustine
been so alloyed with notions of fear, of
guilt, of fleshly filth as to be almost no
pleasure at all, it would open the flood
gates to degeneracy and rampant
immorality; and, of course, would
make the married state too attractive
to bear comparison with the self
imposed celebacy of its clergy.
The pious effusion about the "dig
nity of human life" etc. is a smoke
screen: in fact, human life and love are
offered at the altar of a sterile and
highly questionable logic. Proof for
this deduction is not difficult to find.
For henceforth married men and wo
men, who in the privacy of their own
lives have decided upon some form of
contraceptive method but who are
nonetheless conscientious believers,
will each Saturday be subjected to a
veritable hell-fire sermon for their
transgression, whispered intensely at
them through the lattice-window by
their orthodox confessors, and will be
forced to promise never to do again
what next week love will invariably de
mand .
But only this sin of sexual trans
gression receives so much attention
from the confessors. Lies, thievery,
hatreds of every sort, positive injuries
to others, lack of charity, even blas
phemy and doubts, are usually dis
missed with twenty Our 1 athers and
Hail Marys.
Mow long the believers can endure
to hear their love degraded once a
week depends upon their own common

sense and self-confidence; for many the
encyclical will be the renewed painful
conflict of conscience and emotion, for
the Church has seen to it that these
many have been brought up as spiritual
dependents.
Sex has become for the Church the
most odious evil: Christ did not con
demn sex in the letter or spirit as His
Church has seen fit to do. But sincc St.
Paul and especially since Augustine, ec
clesiastical writers have displayed a
neurotL hatred for and fear of the legi
timate pleasures of the flesh. How else
but as sinful can a celibate priest un
derstand the sexual act between a
married couple, if his own urges have
been always condemned and perhaps
never once transformed by the exper
ience of true love?
One should never forget this anti
sexual tradition when reading the
Thomistic theology of the encyclical,
nor the peculiar psychology of its aut
hor. The Catholic point of view of
marriage, as set forth in the Church's
teachings, is exclusively the point of
view of the celibate who can only theo

rizc, and consequently is a deficient
point of view.

clesiastical writers have displayed a
neurotL hatred for and fear of the legi
timate pleasures of the flesh. How else
but as sinful can a celibate priest un
derstand the sexual act between a
married couple, if his own urges have
been always condemned and perhaps
never once transformed by the exper
ience of true love?
One should never forget this anti
sexual tradition when reading the
Thomistic theology of the encyclical,
nor the peculiar psychology of its aut
hor. The Catholic point of view of
marriage, as set forth in the Church's

view of the celibate who can only theo

rizc, and consequently is a deficient
point of view.

The Pope's latest encyclical was
only to be expected. The Catholic
Church has suffered from a form of
anti-sexual Puritanism. Sex among the
happily married is a positive pleasure;
yet all things pleasurable-especially if
they are denied to the administrators
of the Catholic empire-are somehow
sinful.
Should the Church open the way
for its married believers to enjoy freely
a pleasure that has since Augustine
been so alloyed with notions of fear, of
guilt, of fleshly filth as to be almost no
pleasure at all, it would open the flood
gates to degeneracy and rampant
immorality; and, of course, would
make the married state too attractive
to bear comparison with the self
imposed celebacy of its clergy.
The pious effusion about the "dig
nity of human life" etc. is a smoke
screen: in fact, human life and love are
offered at the altar of a sterile and
highly questionable logic. Proof for
this deduction is not difficult to find.
For henceforth married men and wo
men, who in the privacy of their own
lives have decided upon some form of
contraceptive method but who are
nonetheless conscientious believers,
will each Saturday be subjected to a
veritable hell-fire sermon for their
transgression, whispered intensely at
them through the lattice-window by
their orthodox confessors, and will be
forced to promise never to do again
what next week love will invariably de
mand .
But only this sin of sexual trans
gression receives so much attention
from the confessors. Lies, thievery,
hatreds of every sort, positive injuries
to others, lack of charity, even blas
phemy and doubts, are usually dis
missed with twenty Our 1 athers and
Hail Marys.
Mow long the believers can endure
to hear their love degraded once a
week depends upon their own common

sense and self-confidence; for many the
encyclical will be the renewed painful
conflict of conscience and emotion, for
the Church has seen to it that these
many have been brought up as spiritual
dependents.
Sex has become for the Church the
most odious evil: Christ did not con
demn sex in the letter or spirit as His
Church has seen fit to do. But sincc St.
Paul and especially since Augustine, ec
clesiastical writers have displayed a
neurotL hatred for and fear of the legi
timate pleasures of the flesh. How else
but as sinful can a celibate priest un
derstand the sexual act between a
