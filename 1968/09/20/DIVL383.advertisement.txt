Only Bic would dare to torment a beauty like this. Not the girl...
the pen she's holding. It's the new luxury model Bic Clic...designed
for scholarship athletes, lucky card players and other rich campus
socialites who can afford the expensive 49-cent price.
But don't let those delicate good looks fool you. Despite hor
rible punishment by mad scientists, the elegant Bic Clic still wrote
first time, every time.
Everything you want in a fine pen, you'll find in the new Bic
Clic. It's retractable. Refillable. Comes in 8 barrel colors. And like
all Bic pens, writes first time, every time...no matter what devilish
abuse sadistic students devise for it.
