It's symbolic of your school, becausc we've embossed your
symbol on a special checkbook cover that comes in the school
colors as well. And you can't find a better way to carry your
money than in a Bank of America checkbook. It gives you more
than safety. It helps you keep a more accurate record of how much
you spend, where and when. And our Tenplan" Checking Accounts
have special features for students. You pay just for each
check you write. ( if you use a BankAmericard®.) I here's no
additional charge, no matter how low your balance gets. When
you go on vacation, your Tenplan Account does too. We keep it
open all summer long at no charge, even if your balance is zero.
Why not stop by our branch and open a Tenplan Account soon.
You'll get one of the most useful books a student can have.
