| Old Bomb. I
I New Honda. I
I Same Price. I
It's true this sleek new Honda Scrambler 125 would cost
you the same money as the old used "bomb , but the
low price isn't the whole Honda story. Far from it.
When you ride any of Honda's 23 models, you can
forget high insurance, high upkeep and high maintenance
costs. Forget your parking problems too, while your at it.
And look at the Scrambler 125 styling: new candy
colors chrome fenders, trim new forks, upswept pipes.
And performance: the I 25's dependable 4-stroke parallel
twin OHC engine delivers an impressive 13 hp at 10,000
rpm; up to 153 mpg.
The hot new Scrambler 125. Can you think of a
better reason to ban the bomb?
