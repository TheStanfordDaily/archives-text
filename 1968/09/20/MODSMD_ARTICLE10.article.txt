# Rough Draft
## 
### BILL LELAND ALAN STRAIN 
EDITOR'S NOTE: Bill Lelaml
and Alan Strain art' both coun
selors in the Office of Special
Services, Room 324 Old Union,
of the Dean of Students, special
izing 1 in Selective Service prob
lems. They plan to provide The
Daily with a weekly column
dealing with the draft, and wel
come correspondence on this
subject.
Between one forrth and one
third of all entering first year
Stanford men will not yet have
registered with Selective Ser
vice. As many as one half of all
entering freshmen will not yet
have received and filled a Classi
fication Questionnaire.
Those who are not yet eigh
teen are no doubt already aware
that every male citizen and all
male aliens who are permanent
residents are required by law to
register in person within five
days after their eighteenth
birthdays.
The man who registers after
coming to Stanford has a choice
about the draft board which will
have jurisdiction over him for
the rest of his career with Se
lective Service. Depending upon
the address he gives when reg
istering he may establish as his
board either the local board hav
ing jurisdiction over his address
at Stanford or the board having
jurisdiction over a home address
elsewhere. With rare exceptions
he cannot for any reason change
his local board after registra
tion, though he may transfer the
location of a physical examina
tion, an appeal or an order for
induction or civilian work.
Questionnaire
Several weeks or months after
he registers, depending upon his
local board, each registrant is 1
sent a Classification Question- 1
naire (SSS Form 100.) This i
questionnaire affords him an op
portunity to present information !
about himself, his family, and j
srch things as occupation, edu- j
cational status, physical condi
tion, and conscientious objection
to war, which may entitle him to |
some classification other than I-
A. Lacking such information, j
Selective Service regulations re- j
quire that he be placed in Class
I-A.
It should be noted that there
are three classifications which
mean "avai'able for active
duty": I-A, I-A-O, and I-O. I-A,
of course means "available for
military duty."

I-A-O is the classification for
conscientious objectors who are
available for non-combatant mil
itary duty only. And I-O is the
classification given conscientious
objectors who are available for
civilian work in lieu of military
duty. All other classifications are
exemptions or temporary defer
ments from one of these basic
classifications.
'Available-for duty'
If a man believes that his
basic "available-for-duty" classi
fication should be I-A-O or I-O,

he is expected by Selective Ser
vice to sign the statement on
conscientioi s objection in the
Classification Questionnaire. In
our experience it is important
that a man who is considering
filing as a conscientious objector
consult a skilled counselor.
The Classification Question
naire is quite extensive and the
purpose and intent of some ques
tions may not always be clear.
Sample copies are available
from the Office of Special Ser
vices, Dean of Students.

Between one forrth and one
third of all entering first year
Stanford men will not yet have
registered with Selective Ser
vice. As many as one half of all
entering freshmen will not yet
have received and filled a Classi
fication Questionnaire.
Those who are not yet eigh
teen are no doubt already aware
that every male citizen and all
male aliens who are permanent
residents are required by law to
register in person within five
days after their eighteenth
birthdays.
The man who registers after
coming to Stanford has a choice
about the draft board which will
have jurisdiction over him for
the rest of his career with Se
lective Service. Depending upon
the address he gives when reg
istering he may establish as his
board either the local board hav
ing jurisdiction over his address
at Stanford or the board having
jurisdiction over a home address
elsewhere. With rare exceptions
he cannot for any reason change
his local board after registra
tion, though he may transfer the
location of a physical examina
tion, an appeal or an order for
induction or civilian work.
Questionnaire
Several weeks or months after
he registers, depending upon his
local board, each registrant is 1
sent a Classification Question- 1
naire (SSS Form 100.) This i
questionnaire affords him an op
portunity to present information !
about himself, his family, and j
srch things as occupation, edu- j
cational status, physical condi
tion, and conscientious objection
to war, which may entitle him to |
some classification other than I-
A. Lacking such information, j
Selective Service regulations re- j
quire that he be placed in Class
I-A.
It should be noted that there
are three classifications which
mean "avai'able for active
duty": I-A, I-A-O, and I-O. I-A,
of course means "available for
military duty."

I-A-O is the classification for
conscientious objectors who are
available for non-combatant mil
itary duty only. And I-O is the
classification given conscientious
objectors who are available for
civilian work in lieu of military
duty. All other classifications are
exemptions or temporary defer
ments from one of these basic
classifications.
'Available-for duty'
If a man believes that his
basic "available-for-duty" classi
fication should be I-A-O or I-O,

he is expected by Selective Ser
vice to sign the statement on
conscientioi s objection in the
Classification Questionnaire. In
our experience it is important
that a man who is considering
filing as a conscientious objector
consult a skilled counselor.
