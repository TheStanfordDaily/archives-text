### TIM HAIGHT 
EDITOR'S NOTE: Tim Haight,
a 1966 Stanford graduate, re
signs! last year from the De
partment of Communication
where he held a graduate fel
lowship. He recently refused in
duction into the armed services
and is awaiting trial.

"Where am I?"
"On the Campus."
"Who are you?"
"I am Number Two."
"Who is Number One?"
"You will find your number in
the upper left hand corner of
your registration card. Ask your
advisor."
"What do you want?"
"To exchange information."
"What side are you on?"
"That would be taking a po
litical position as an institu
tion."
"I am not a number! I am a
free man!"
"Of course you are. You even
chose to come here, didn't you?
But no matter. We'd like to
know a little bit about you for
our files. We'd like to help you
learn to help yourself. Look
around you. All you see are
sympathetic eyes. Stroll around
the grounds until you feel at
home."
Crazy?
"Are you people all crazy?
What is going on here?"
"Look. Nobody is forcing you
to stay here. This is no island
off the coast of Africa. You
came here of your own freewill,
right? Now tell me. Why do you
want to resign?"
"I . . . uh, I don't feel like
telling you."
"Perfectly all right. We've
plenty of time."
"What is going on here?!"
Community
"Between the foothills and the
Bay, we've tried to build a Uni
versity community, where you
can follow the pursuit of truth
and a better income when you
graduate. You will perform cer
tain tasks, give us information,
and engage in the social, politi
cal, and athletic games of the
campus. In return for your la
bor, you will be given units—
which can later be exchanged

for other forms of currency."
"It all seems so strange. It's
like I fell asleep in a different
world and now I'm here, in this
cross between a European vil
lage and Disneyland."
"Take it easy. You're just new
here. And don't worry. We like
you to dissent. That's what a
university is made of. In fact,
we've given you—newly this
year—voting membership on our
committees."
Committees
"Committees? Are they Num
ber One?"
"It's very difficult to say. I
can't tell you, really. You see,
nobody can really claim to be
number one. Some say The
Board is close to Number One,
at least they feel His pressure
but then the faculty says that

Number One is near them. The
committees can't be Number
One, although they have influ
ence. That's the important thing
for you to remember—exactly
who is Number One is not real
ly important. We've given you a
voice."
"A voice?"
"Yes. For example, a study
headed by Number Four has
just decided that we are going
to build villages for the stu
dents. Each will have its own
store, and living quarters, and
classes, and everything. Perhaps
we'll even ride around in little
jeeps with striped awnings like
the Hilton hotels have. Students
had a voice in that decision. It's
a new kind of educational sys
tem to keep you from getting
alienated."

"But it's so unreal! It's lik
some surrealistic parody of a so
ciety. The world is full of Vbt
nams, and Chicagos, and mil
lions of faceless, starving, bored,
love-starved- human beings. It's
not like this."
"Look, you're verging on the
unmutual, but since wo welcome
diss on t and criticism I'll answer
you directly. Do you think you
cou'd learn what the world is
really like if you were distracted
from the studies we have
planned for you so you can take
that effective place in the
world? We operate this village
for you, so that you can make
the world the place your studies
will show you it should be.
Don't do yourself a disservice.

"Of course, you're free to drop
out. You're not a number but a
free man. Help us 'tell it like it
is', as you say. We welcome dis
sent. But remember that to earn
a here you have respon
sibilities along with your free
dom. Many others were denied
access here, and you are privi
leged. Consider the alternatives
in our society. You need an edu
cation at an accredited univer
sity to get ahead. Don't be a
fool."
"I am a fool, I guess. I don't

'•now. I fool kind of liko a fool
an-.l kind of liko a rat.'
"Don't worry. That's just b">-
causo you haven't adjusted.
Onco you find your pattern hor\
yru won't fo -1 like a rat. And
1 riioyo mo, Stanford graduates
are not fools."

"Where am I?"
"On the Campus."
"Who are you?"
"I am Number Two."
"Who is Number One?"
"You will find your number in
the upper left hand corner of
your registration card. Ask your
advisor."
"What do you want?"
"To exchange information."
"What side are you on?"
"That would be taking a po
litical position as an institu
tion."
"I am not a number! I am a
free man!"
"Of course you are. You even
chose to come here, didn't you?
But no matter. We'd like to
know a little bit about you for
our files. We'd like to help you
learn to help yourself. Look
around you. All you see are
sympathetic eyes. Stroll around
the grounds until you feel at
home."
Crazy?
"Are you people all crazy?
What is going on here?"
"Look. Nobody is forcing you
to stay here. This is no island
off the coast of Africa. You
came here of your own freewill,
right? Now tell me. Why do you
want to resign?"
"I . . . uh, I don't feel like
telling you."
"Perfectly all right. We've
plenty of time."
"What is going on here?!"
Community
"Between the foothills and the
Bay, we've tried to build a Uni
versity community, where you
can follow the pursuit of truth
and a better income when you
graduate. You will perform cer
tain tasks, give us information,
and engage in the social, politi
cal, and athletic games of the
campus. In return for your la
bor, you will be given units—
which can later be exchanged

for other forms of currency."
"It all seems so strange. It's
like I fell asleep in a different
world and now I'm here, in this
cross between a European vil
lage and Disneyland."
"Take it easy. You're just new
here. And don't worry. We like
you to dissent. That's what a
university is made of. In fact,
we've given you—newly this
year—voting membership on our
committees."
Committees
"Committees? Are they Num
ber One?"
"It's very difficult to say. I
can't tell you, really. You see,
nobody can really claim to be
number one. Some say The
Board is close to Number One,
at least they feel His pressure
but then the faculty says that

Number One is near them. The
committees can't be Number
One, although they have influ
ence. That's the important thing
for you to remember—exactly
who is Number One is not real
ly important. We've given you a
voice."
"A voice?"
"Yes. For example, a study
headed by Number Four has
just decided that we are going
to build villages for the stu
dents. Each will have its own
store, and living quarters, and
classes, and everything. Perhaps
we'll even ride around in little
jeeps with striped awnings like
the Hilton hotels have. Students
had a voice in that decision. It's
a new kind of educational sys
tem to keep you from getting
alienated."

"But it's so unreal! It's lik
some surrealistic parody of a so
ciety. The world is full of Vbt
nams, and Chicagos, and mil
lions of faceless, starving, bored,
love-starved- human beings. It's
not like this."
"Look, you're verging on the
unmutual, but since wo welcome
diss on t and criticism I'll answer
you directly. Do you think you
cou'd learn what the world is
really like if you were distracted
from the studies we have
planned for you so you can take
that effective place in the
world? We operate this village
for you, so that you can make
the world the place your studies
will show you it should be.
Don't do yourself a disservice.

"Of course, you're free to drop
out. You're not a number but a
free man. Help us 'tell it like it
is', as you say. We welcome dis
sent. But remember that to earn
a here you have respon
sibilities along with your free
dom. Many others were denied
access here, and you are privi
leged. Consider the alternatives
in our society. You need an edu
cation at an accredited univer
sity to get ahead. Don't be a
fool."
"I am a fool, I guess. I don't

"Who is Number One?"
"You will find your number in
the upper left hand corner of
your registration card. Ask your
advisor."
"What do you want?"
"To exchange information."
"What side are you on?"
"That would be taking a po
litical position as an institu
tion."
"I am not a number! I am a
free man!"
"Of course you are. You even
chose to come here, didn't you?
But no matter. We'd like to
know a little bit about you for
our files. We'd like to help you
learn to help yourself. Look
around you. All you see are
sympathetic eyes. Stroll around
the grounds until you feel at
home."
Crazy?
"Are you people all crazy?
What is going on here?"
"Look. Nobody is forcing you
to stay here. This is no island
off the coast of Africa. You
came here of your own freewill,
right? Now tell me. Why do you
want to resign?"
"I . . . uh, I don't feel like
telling you."
"Perfectly all right. We've
plenty of time."
"What is going on here?!"
Community
"Between the foothills and the
Bay, we've tried to build a Uni
versity community, where you
can follow the pursuit of truth
and a better income when you
graduate. You will perform cer
tain tasks, give us information,
and engage in the social, politi
cal, and athletic games of the
campus. In return for your la
bor, you will be given units—
which can later be exchanged

for other forms of currency."
"It all seems so strange. It's
like I fell asleep in a different
world and now I'm here, in this
cross between a European vil
lage and Disneyland."
"Take it easy. You're just new
here. And don't worry. We like
you to dissent. That's what a
university is made of. In fact,
we've given you—newly this
year—voting membership on our
committees."
Committees
"Committees? Are they Num
ber One?"
"It's very difficult to say. I
can't tell you, really. You see,
nobody can really claim to be
number one. Some say The
Board is close to Number One,
at least they feel His pressure
but then the faculty says that

Number One is near them. The
committees can't be Number
One, although they have influ
ence. That's the important thing
for you to remember—exactly
who is Number One is not real
ly important. We've given you a
voice."
"A voice?"
"Yes. For example, a study
headed by Number Four has
just decided that we are going
to build villages for the stu
dents. Each will have its own
store, and living quarters, and
classes, and everything. Perhaps
we'll even ride around in little
jeeps with striped awnings like
the Hilton hotels have. Students
had a voice in that decision. It's
a new kind of educational sys
tem to keep you from getting
alienated."

"But it's so unreal! It's lik
some surrealistic parody of a so
ciety. The world is full of Vbt
nams, and Chicagos, and mil
lions of faceless, starving, bored,
love-starved- human beings. It's
not like this."
"Look, you're verging on the
unmutual, but since wo welcome
diss on t and criticism I'll answer
you directly. Do you think you
cou'd learn what the world is
really like if you were distracted
from the studies we have
planned for you so you can take
that effective place in the
world? We operate this village
for you, so that you can make
the world the place your studies
will show you it should be.
Don't do yourself a disservice.

"Of course, you're free to drop
out. You're not a number but a
free man. Help us 'tell it like it
is', as you say. We welcome dis
sent. But remember that to earn
a here you have respon
sibilities along with your free
dom. Many others were denied
access here, and you are privi
leged. Consider the alternatives
in our society. You need an edu
cation at an accredited univer
sity to get ahead. Don't be a
fool."
"I am a fool, I guess. I don't

'•now. I fool kind of liko a fool
an-.l kind of liko a rat.'
"Don't worry. That's just b">-
causo you haven't adjusted.
Onco you find your pattern hor\
yru won't fo -1 like a rat. And
1 riioyo mo, Stanford graduates
are not fools."
