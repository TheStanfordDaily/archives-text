# The 						Child Syndrome Of Academe
## 
### MAURY M. TRAVIS 
EDITOR'S NOTE: Maury Tra
vis has retained an intense in
terest in Stanford since he grad
uated in Earth Sciences in 1927.
His recent contributions to the
Daily include a proposal for
the formation of a Stanford Stu
dent Security group (SSS)
which would guard the campus
against "the anarchists . . .
fwhol have advertised their in
structions to spread their venom
on colleges and universities this
fall."
Infants - in - residence (some
times called "students") demand
instant gratification for immedi
ate demands, throwbacks to in
fantile days of mother love and
smother love, the rewards of
permissiveness, producing the
spoiled children of adolescence.
These are the children who

never grew up and are thereby,
groping for the handle to shake
the world to its foundation to
bring down the house.
These student-infants are oft
en bottle-nursed mentally by
well - meaning, half child-half
adrlt instructors and sometimes,
indeed, by assistant and associ
ate professors who should know
better, whose sympathies are in
their own frustrated childhood.
Anarchy
The results are quite dramat
ic: instant anarchy, the insanity
of incineration ("let's burn the
place down," "burn, baby burn")
and the inability to implement
reason for implacable opposi
tion to constituted authority.
Infants in residence are com
pelled to violate all laws of God
and Man, and then, childishly,
demand a verdict of "not guil

ty," therby revealing their
naked moral bankruptcy and
their inability to be regarded as
grown-up adult persons.
Deprived of their infantile de
mands, the pubescent pueri'e
adolescents of academo take in
stant "revenge" in marijuana,
pot, LSD and the like, for "trips"
to the delights of Never-Never
Land, wherein they do not have
to face up with the realities of
everyday existence.
'Spanking'
One prime remedy is a "sp-nk
ing," the time-honored therapy
for childish behavior that is out
of line, the burning reminder to
"grow up, baby" and stop tell
ing your papas and mamas how
to run this perplexed world!
I have a dream (remember,
this is a dream and will never,
never happen):
1. All beatniks, hippies, yio

pies, and whoopies, all anar
chists, SDS et a', will be round
el up and placed in r habita
tion camps, like CCC of FDR's
time.
2. All will b? bathed, washed
r.nd hair cut to proper length,
and shaved also (sometimes you
can't tell the boys from the
girls).
3. Al 1 will be made to work
physica'ly in out-of-door camps,
ur.'ler authority, given voeation
a 1 training and then r leased on
probation to local authorities.
Remember, this is a it
will never, never happen. So re
lax, chillun!
FEVER ACADEME
In future years we shall see of
yore
The anarchy academe as
before:
Nude deg n°rate at Mausoleum,
Insanity dementia — not lau
damus Te Deum.
These are times when people
despair
Of infants -in - resid nee and
their flair:
Who choose riots over reason—
basic flaw,
Not knowing the need for or
der and law.
Like a fever that sweeps the
land,
The psyche — the mind —
diseased demand:
Perfection is a dream of jewel
so rare.
But children must scream—
they do not care.
L'envoi
As ancient sages in legend said,
"This, too, will pass," then
calm instead:
Who knows what grim ghastly
futrre holds
For those whose gods lie in
gutters bold.

Anarchy
The results are quite dramat

of incineration ("let's burn the
place down," "burn, baby burn")
and the inability to implement
reason for implacable opposi
tion to constituted authority.
Infants in residence are com
pelled to violate all laws of God
and Man, and then, childishly,

naked moral bankruptcy and
their inability to be regarded as

adolescents of academo take in

everyday existence.
'Spanking'
One prime remedy is a "sp-nk

for childish behavior that is out
of line, the burning reminder to
"grow up, baby" and stop tell

I have a dream (remember,
this is a dream and will never,
never happen):
1. All beatniks, hippies, yio

pies, and whoopies, all anar
chists, SDS et a', will be round
el up and placed in r habita
tion camps, like CCC of FDR's
time.
2. All will b? bathed, washed
r.nd hair cut to proper length,
and shaved also (sometimes you
can't tell the boys from the

3. Al 1 will be made to work
physica'ly in out-of-door camps,
ur.'ler authority, given voeation
a 1 training and then r leased on
probation to local authorities.
Remember, this is a it
