President Johnson deserves
every accolade of a tormented
humanity for his recent initia
tives toward containment of the
nuclear terror that hangs over
the world. If the U.S.-Soviet
talks on nuclear disarmament
succeed, his Administration will
surely be remembered above all
as the turning point toward
world survival, a climax to over
shadow all the other magnifi
cent blunders and accomplish
ments of the most paradoxical
President of U.S. history.

The arms race has, for a gen
eration, robbed an impatient spe
cies of the main fruits of tech
nological progress. It has blown
the minds of our adolescents
who see only "blah" for a fu
ture. It has stolen the bricks
and mortar and know-how from
the rebuilding of the cities.
These costs of terror and de
pletion are known to all and
appreciated by few; they have
certainly received only an inci
dental priority of national ac
tion. Indeed, we must ask an
awkward question: "Are the
American people, or the Rus
sian, really ready to talk peace?"
The President and the states
men he can recruit for this no
blest and most difficult mission
may have a clear vision of an
unshackled world, and in striv
ing for it they may lead the
people—but not too far, and par
ticularly not in an election year

so full of calculated confusion
and evasion.
Enthrallment
Thirty years of enthrallment
to military security, major and
minor wars, JRed-hunts, our own
use of nuclear weapons (yes:
Hiroshima and Nagasaki) and
unremitting anxiety about Ar
mageddon have left an indelible
mark on the American psyche.
The scars on the other side run
far deeper: besides their history
of Stalinist and Hitlerian geno
cide, a nuclear No. 2 has to try
harder.
Soviet leaders have been quick
to point out the many serious
conflicts that still rend the world
scene—not that we can have for
gotten. These issues of political
substance resonate with ever
hardening psychic attitudes in a
self-perpetuating cycle of mu
tual insult and injury.
The turning point for the Rus
sians may have been Sputnik,

which symbolized their achieve
ment of technical parity with
the West in a major area of na
tional security. Since then, they
could afford to relax and have
begun to do so while the major
powers approached a more sta
ble equilibrium of mutual nu
clear deterrence.
Hard to Remedy
Many psychiatrists have
pointed out that hostility, once
established, is a disease hard to
remedy. Certainly, to berate the
anxiety and prejudice of the
radical right and Red-hating
movements does nothing to al
leviate their deep-rooted appeal
to fear. Rational argument is not
necessarily better at alleviating
political paranoia.
The only reliable approach to
alleviating group hostility, ac
cording to the studies of social
psychologists, is cooperation in
reaching superordinate goals.
Most of us already perceive such
a goal; sheer survival, for no
one wins a thermonuclear game.
In Chinese
This may be too abstract for
universal acceptance; the threat
had to start speaking in Chi

nese to be sufficiently widely un
derstood.
Arms-control negotiations are i
a hazardous undertaking in the
present climate. They may be
far worse than futile if, as may
happen, the talks themselves
generate new confrontations and
misunderstandings. They will go
on for a long time, and it is ;
doubtful that major fundamen-'
tal settlements can be reached
before the nations become more
accustomed to mutual confi
dence.
The issue ot what to talk
about is already being exploited
as a bargaining point: for our
part we should try to focus ir
ritating and dangerous issues,
like "the threat for mankind
from the use of chemical and J
biological weapons" — Kosygin
—which are still peripheral to
the vital strategic interests of
the major powers.
This issue, above all, can also
be related to another superordi
nate goal, the dedication of bio
logical research to global free
dom from disease.
