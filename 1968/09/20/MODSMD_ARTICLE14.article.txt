## How Daley Blew It 
### DIARMUID McGUIRE 
Richard Daley recently show
ed the public a jar of black wi
dow spiders and said was
proof that he needed to do wl!**
he did to save Chicago. But even
Daley must realize by now that
the situation was completely in
his control. If the Left gained
anything in his city, it was be
cause Daley gave it to them.
Jerry Rubin and the mobiliza
tion committee had been talking
about 100,000 demonstrators. If
more than 5,000 mace-snorting
radicals showed in the Windy
City, their presence was un
known to both Jerry and the J.
Edgar clique. (For the exact fig
ure, ask the Army. They kept a
green Huey in the air all week
to count heads.)
Of course the crowd was aug
mented by hundreds of fearless
photographers, intrepid corres
pondents, undercover agents and
stenographers yearning to
breath free. But still it was a
small, poorly organized and vast
ly outnumbered group.
Stone Age Politics
In the end it was his own
power, coupled with his paleo
lithic mentality, that got the best
of Richard. The mass media,
which can be counted on for
ouija board accuracy in such
matters, reported that the mayor
had 28,000 men at his disposal,
not counting paratroopers and
other servants of peace who
could have been summoned from
the East.
The mayor had dispatched his
best sleuths in advance, and they
had returned with armloads of
underground newspapers, eye

witness accounts of press con
ferences and lots of documented,
verified, incontrovertable New
Left rhetoric. This rhetoric was
composed largely of terms like
"disrupt" and "bring to a stand
still" and "belong to the people"
and "capture the Loop."
Peace March Blocked
So on Wednesday, August 28,
when David Dillinger wanted to
lead his march out of Grant Park
and off toward the Ampitheater,
five miles to the south, Daley did
not see a motley conglomeration
of gentle zealots, wooley zealots,
freaky kids, steeley-eyed teen
age girls and F. 8.1, agents. He
saw the armies of anti-Christ,
which had doubtless marched
straight from SIBERIA to defile
his fair city.
And Daley thundered, "Youse
shall not pass." and his legion
naires gritted their teeth and
clutched their staves and stood
their ground.
What Daley did not realize was
that people are like water. They
seep in and out of tiny cracks in
the stoutest walls. And they
seeped out of Grant Park and
flowed onto Michigan Avenue
and began to chant and cheer
and demonstrate that they were
right there on Michigan Avenue
in the fading afternoon.
The cops and soldiers saw this
and remembered that the boss
had said that there was not go
ing to be any demonstration in
the streets of Chicago. So they
tried to erase their unsightly
failure with the tools at hand,
which were clubs and tear gas
and bayonets. Since the demon
strators had previously used bi

zarre weapons like sarcasm
against them (one popular chant
was "More pay for cops"), they
felt justified in giving their cap
tives a few extra licks as they
packed them into paddy wagons.
Cops Mark City
The result was a blemish on
the cheek of Chicago, and the
cops picked it and squeezed it
and tortured it until it became
an obscene wound. Since it was
graduation day, pictures were
taken and there is our portrait
of Chicago up there on the
mantlepiece with a bloody
pimple exploded across its face.
It was a case of simplicity vs.
complexity with a resounding
victory for complexity. Dick
Daley saw a simple threat to his
kingdom and his power and his
glory, and he attempted to ap
ply a simple remedy. But it was
a complicated situation and all
Daley accomplished was to give
extra impetus to a multi-faceted
tide of social change that is
wider than Chicago, bigger than
the Democratic Party, older than
the war in Vietnam and more
powerful than Dick Daley.

and bayonets. Since the demon
strators had previously used bi

zarre weapons like sarcasm
against them (one popular chant
was "More pay for cops"), they
felt justified in giving their cap
tives a few extra licks as they
packed them into paddy wagons.
Cops Mark City
The result was a blemish on
the cheek of Chicago, and the
cops picked it and squeezed it
and tortured it until it became
an obscene wound. Since it was
graduation day, pictures were
taken and there is our portrait
of Chicago up there on the
mantlepiece with a bloody
pimple exploded across its face.
It was a case of simplicity vs.
complexity with a resounding
victory for complexity. Dick
Daley saw a simple threat to his
kingdom and his power and his
glory, and he attempted to ap
ply a simple remedy. But it was
a complicated situation and all
Daley accomplished was to give
extra impetus to a multi-faceted
tide of social change that is
wider than Chicago, bigger than
the Democratic Party, older than
the war in Vietnam and more
powerful than Dick Daley.
Richard Daley recently show
ed the public a jar of black wi
dow spiders and said was
proof that he needed to do wl!**
he did to save Chicago. But even
Daley must realize by now that
the situation was completely in
his control. If the Left gained
anything in his city, it was be
cause Daley gave it to them.
Jerry Rubin and the mobiliza
tion committee had been talking
about 100,000 demonstrators. If
more than 5,000 mace-snorting
radicals showed in the Windy
City, their presence was un
known to both Jerry and the J.
Edgar clique. (For the exact fig
ure, ask the Army. They kept a
green Huey in the air all week
to count heads.)
Of course the crowd was aug
mented by hundreds of fearless
photographers, intrepid corres
pondents, undercover agents and
stenographers yearning to
breath free. But still it was a
small, poorly organized and vast
ly outnumbered group.
Stone Age Politics
In the end it was his own
power, coupled with his paleo
lithic mentality, that got the best
of Richard. The mass media,
which can be counted on for
ouija board accuracy in such
matters, reported that the mayor
had 28,000 men at his disposal,
not counting paratroopers and
other servants of peace who
could have been summoned from
the East.
The mayor had dispatched his
best sleuths in advance, and they
had returned with armloads of
underground newspapers, eye

witness accounts of press con
ferences and lots of documented,
verified, incontrovertable New
Left rhetoric. This rhetoric was
composed largely of terms like
"disrupt" and "bring to a stand
still" and "belong to the people"
and "capture the Loop."
Peace March Blocked
So on Wednesday, August 28,
when David Dillinger wanted to
lead his march out of Grant Park
and off toward the Ampitheater,
five miles to the south, Daley did
not see a motley conglomeration
of gentle zealots, wooley zealots,
freaky kids, steeley-eyed teen
age girls and F. 8.1, agents. He
saw the armies of anti-Christ,
which had doubtless marched
straight from SIBERIA to defile
his fair city.
And Daley thundered, "Youse
shall not pass." and his legion
naires gritted their teeth and
clutched their staves and stood
their ground.
What Daley did not realize was
that people are like water. They
seep in and out of tiny cracks in
the stoutest walls. And they
seeped out of Grant Park and
flowed onto Michigan Avenue
and began to chant and cheer
and demonstrate that they were
right there on Michigan Avenue
in the fading afternoon.
The cops and soldiers saw this
and remembered that the boss
had said that there was not go
ing to be any demonstration in
the streets of Chicago. So they
tried to erase their unsightly
failure with the tools at hand,
which were clubs and tear gas
and bayonets. Since the demon
strators had previously used bi

zarre weapons like sarcasm
against them (one popular chant
was "More pay for cops"), they
felt justified in giving their cap
