# Little Progress Made In Arson Investigation
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
No substantial progress has
been made in the investigation
of the fire which gutted the of
fice of then-president Wallace
Sterling early in the morning of
July 5.
The blaze was the third in
stance of arson at Stanford since
February, both of the others in
volving the Naval ROTC build
ing.
All of the fires were set with
"flammable liquids" according to
Santa Clara County Fire Mar
shal Bruce Wiggins. He estimat
ed the damage in the Building
10 fire at $300,000.
Discovered By Patrolman
The fire was discovered short
ly before 5 a.m. by a Stanford
patrolman. When five units of
the Fire Department arrived
minutes later, the president's of
fice and most of the building
were already enveloped in smoke
and flames.
A $5,000 reward has been of
fered for information leading to
the arrest and conviction of the
person or persons responsible
for setting the blaze.
Lost in the fire were rare
books, paintings from the Stan
ford collection, and many of
Sterling's personal mementos ac
quired during his 40 years in edu
cation.
At the scene, a green book bag
containing the president's files
on the Stanford Research Insti
tute was found, dumped by a
rear door. Other files were also
opened and damaged.
Originally, all personnel in
Building 10 were moved into
Building 1. Recently, however,
four trailers have been moved
into Inner Quad to house the
University Relations office and
other former tenants of Building
10. The President's office re
mains in Building 1.
Reconstruction of Building 10
has not yet begun, although a
plan has been approved, accord
ing to Donald T. Carlson, Asso
ciate Director of University Re
lations.

The new building will to ba c ic
ally the same as the old one, ex
cept the ceiling level in the Pres
ident's office and conferenr
room has been lowered. This wil'
allow two new offices to be built
on the second floor. This space
was previously used for stor
age.
Work Begins Soon
Work will begin "right away,'
Carlson said.
The architect is William Bu~
se, who designed the new Math
Corner.
As with this Arc, there is alsr
no progress towards finding thr
arsonist in the two Naval ROTC
blazes, nor the person respon
sible for a small fire in the Old
Union in early August.
Early in the morning of Au
gust 6, a fire in the basement of
the Student Services building
was put out automatically by the
sprinkler system.
The fire, which Fire Marsha'
Wiggins called arson, was in a
room used by the registrar's of
fice for catalog mailing. Contents
of files and several cardboard
cartons were piled together ani
burned.
There was no sign of forced
entry into the building. Damage
was minimal.
Lights Turned On
Recently, the university insti
tuted the policy of leaving all
office and classroom lights on at
night. Officials stated the pur
pose was "to decrease the inci
dence of petty theft on campus."
The officials also conceded that
the new policy hopefully would
cut the number of arsons on
campus.
Besides the two fires at Stan
ford's NROTC Annex, the NRO
TC building at Berkeley was also
the victim of two fires. The first,
in early February, did little dam
age.
The second occured a week
ago. In this instance, dynamite
was used, unlike Stanford's fires.
Wiggins sees no connection be
tween the fires here and those
at the University of California.

was previously used for stor
age.
Work Begins Soon
Work will begin "right away,'
Carlson said.
The architect is William Bu~
se, who designed the new Math
Corner.
As with this Arc, there is alsr
no progress towards finding thr
arsonist in the two Naval ROTC
blazes, nor the person respon
sible for a small fire in the Old
Union in early August.
Early in the morning of Au
gust 6, a fire in the basement of
the Student Services building
was put out automatically by the
sprinkler system.
The fire, which Fire Marsha'
Wiggins called arson, was in a
room used by the registrar's of
fice for catalog mailing. Contents
of files and several cardboard
cartons were piled together ani
burned.
There was no sign of forced
entry into the building. Damage
was minimal.
Lights Turned On
Recently, the university insti
tuted the policy of leaving all
office and classroom lights on at
night. Officials stated the pur
pose was "to decrease the inci
dence of petty theft on campus."
The officials also conceded that
the new policy hopefully would
cut the number of arsons on
campus.
Besides the two fires at Stan
ford's NROTC Annex, the NRO
TC building at Berkeley was also
the victim of two fires. The first,
in early February, did little dam
age.
The second occured a week
ago. In this instance, dynamite
was used, unlike Stanford's fires.
Wiggins sees no connection be
tween the fires here and those
at the University of California.
No substantial progress has
been made in the investigation
of the fire which gutted the of
fice of then-president Wallace
Sterling early in the morning of
July 5.
The blaze was the third in
stance of arson at Stanford since
February, both of the others in
volving the Naval ROTC build
ing.
All of the fires were set with
"flammable liquids" according to
Santa Clara County Fire Mar
shal Bruce Wiggins. He estimat
ed the damage in the Building
10 fire at $300,000.
Discovered By Patrolman
The fire was discovered short
ly before 5 a.m. by a Stanford
patrolman. When five units of
the Fire Department arrived
minutes later, the president's of
fice and most of the building
were already enveloped in smoke
and flames.
A $5,000 reward has been of
fered for information leading to
the arrest and conviction of the
person or persons responsible
for setting the blaze.
Lost in the fire were rare
books, paintings from the Stan
ford collection, and many of
Sterling's personal mementos ac
quired during his 40 years in edu
cation.
At the scene, a green book bag
containing the president's files
on the Stanford Research Insti
tute was found, dumped by a
rear door. Other files were also
opened and damaged.
Originally, all personnel in
Building 10 were moved into
Building 1. Recently, however,
four trailers have been moved
into Inner Quad to house the
University Relations office and
other former tenants of Building
10. The President's office re
mains in Building 1.
Reconstruction of Building 10
has not yet begun, although a
plan has been approved, accord
ing to Donald T. Carlson, Asso
ciate Director of University Re
lations.

The new building will to ba c ic
ally the same as the old one, ex
cept the ceiling level in the Pres
ident's office and conferenr
room has been lowered. This wil'
allow two new offices to be built
on the second floor. This space
was previously used for stor
age.
