# Craig Warns Schools Of Political Dangers
## 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON 
The university as an institu
tion is confronted with a serious

threat to its existence, both here
and abroad. This was the mes
sage of history professor Gor

don Craig addressing freshmen
at Wednesday's convocation.
Citing examples in Germany,
Czechoslovakia and "closer to
home" Craig painted a picture
of universities being subjected
to political pressures, threats to
academic freedom as well as in
ternal problems.
Craig said that universities
often "succomb to a kind of Nar
cissus complex," losing all per
spective and becoming "unre
sponsive to the need for change
and adjustment ..."
The widely acclaimed scholar
said Stanford could protect it
self from such internal dangers,
but only with "mutual patience,
tolerance and willingness to com
promise" by all parties, students
and faculty alike.
He cautioned the university
against action that is "selfmoti
vated" rather than directed to
ward the creation and dissemina
tion of knowledge which Craig
called the "primary function" of
the university. In this area,
Craig said, Stanford has always
moved ahead of the times, filling
British prime Minister Disraeli's
ideal of a university, "a place of
light, of liberty and of learn
ing."
Pressures In Prague
He cited Charles University in
Prague as a victim of "reigning
political authority" that won't
tolerate "the very existence of
free centers of learning."
"The students and faculty of
Charles University in Prague
are watching helplessly as the
academic freedoms which they
thought they had secured a
month ago are systemically de
stroyed at the demand of a for
eign power," Craig said.
Craig said that pressures
brought to bear on universities
"closer to home . . . are less open
and brutal than ... in Czecho
slovakia, but they are no less in
sistent."
In talking of the internal
dangers facing the university,
Craig cited the German phil
osopher Nietzsche who gave a
lecture series on "The Future of
our Educational Institutions."
Narcissus Complex
Nietzsche warned, Craig said,
"universities often succomb to
a kind of Narcissus complex,
falling so deeply in love with

what they fancy to be their own
excellences. ..."
Craig pointed out another in
ternal peril facing universities,
"breakdown of effective commu
nication between the constituent
parts of the university body and
from the spread of the kind of
suspicion and distrust between
them that destroys the collabor
ative spirit upon which univer
sities depend."
He mentioned the Free Univer
sity of Berlin as a victim of such
suspicion and mistrust. The Free
University was founded in 1948
after a university in the Soviet
zone was taken over by occupa
tion forces.
Some students and faculty
members started the Free Uni
versity "to teach and to study
without ideological restriction.
Recently, however, it has fallen
prey to "internecine struggles"
caused by both a breakdown in
communication and "resistance
in some university quarters to
long overdue academic reform."
Stanford Responsive
Craig said Stanford "has been
less Narcissistic than some of
her sister institutions ..." He
said Stanford is already respond
ing to demands by students for
more of a role in university gov
erment and in "the decisions that
will guide this university's fu
ture," decisions concerning the

academic program, quality of
instruction, the allocation of the
university's resources and the
university's relation to "the |
wider community."
Craig said this year's fresh- '
man class will have a larger
share in these decisions than
any other in the past. "And I am
glad to think that this will be
true," he said.
He pointed out, however, that
participation in government,
particularly university govern
ment "is an onerous and diffi- I
cult business." He said the issues
"are rarely easy to resolve and
progress toward solution always
depends upon mutual patience,
tolerance and willingness to I
compromise."
He said passion is "natural and
desirable in debate over impor- 1
tant issues, but he pointed out
that students, faculty and ad
ministrators are "partners and
colleagues who must work to
gether. ..."
He also urged the freshmen
not to "assume too easily that
our ideas are better and our mo
tives nobler than those of peo
ple who disagree with us."
He concluded by welcoming
the freshman to Stanford as "col
leagues."
Craig is a nationally praised
professor of German history, ,
author of several books andJ
texts.

more of a role in university gov
erment and in "the decisions that
will guide this university's fu
ture," decisions concerning the

academic program, quality of
instruction, the allocation of the
university's resources and the
university's relation to "the |
wider community."
Craig said this year's fresh- '
man class will have a larger
share in these decisions than
any other in the past. "And I am
glad to think that this will be
true," he said.
He pointed out, however, that
participation in government,
particularly university govern
ment "is an onerous and diffi- I
cult business." He said the issues
"are rarely easy to resolve and
progress toward solution always
depends upon mutual patience,
tolerance and willingness to I
compromise."
He said passion is "natural and
desirable in debate over impor- 1
tant issues, but he pointed out
that students, faculty and ad
ministrators are "partners and
colleagues who must work to
gether. ..."
He also urged the freshmen
not to "assume too easily that
our ideas are better and our mo
tives nobler than those of peo
ple who disagree with us."
He concluded by welcoming
the freshman to Stanford as "col
leagues."
Craig is a nationally praised
professor of German history, ,
author of several books andJ
texts.


NARCISSUS COMPLEX? — Professor Gordan Craig-, speaking at
the freshman convocation, warned against universities booming
complacent. Ho also strongly criticized political and "interncinc
struggles" within colleges, which have plagued sonic universities in
Europe.
The university as an institu
tion is confronted with a serious

threat to its existence, both here
and abroad. This was the mes
sage of history professor Gor

don Craig addressing freshmen
at Wednesday's convocation.
Citing examples in Germany,
Czechoslovakia and "closer to
home" Craig painted a picture
of universities being subjected
to political pressures, threats to
academic freedom as well as in
ternal problems.
Craig said that universities
often "succomb to a kind of Nar
cissus complex," losing all per
spective and becoming "unre
sponsive to the need for change
and adjustment ..."
The widely acclaimed scholar
said Stanford could protect it
self from such internal dangers,
but only with "mutual patience,
tolerance and willingness to com
promise" by all parties, students
and faculty alike.
He cautioned the university
against action that is "selfmoti
vated" rather than directed to
ward the creation and dissemina
tion of knowledge which Craig
called the "primary function" of
the university. In this area,
Craig said, Stanford has always
moved ahead of the times, filling
British prime Minister Disraeli's
ideal of a university, "a place of
light, of liberty and of learn
ing."
Pressures In Prague
He cited Charles University in
Prague as a victim of "reigning
political authority" that won't
tolerate "the very existence of
free centers of learning."
"The students and faculty of
Charles University in Prague
are watching helplessly as the
academic freedoms which they
thought they had secured a
month ago are systemically de
stroyed at the demand of a for
eign power," Craig said.
Craig said that pressures
brought to bear on universities
"closer to home . . . are less open
and brutal than ... in Czecho
slovakia, but they are no less in
sistent."
In talking of the internal
dangers facing the university,
Craig cited the German phil
osopher Nietzsche who gave a
lecture series on "The Future of
our Educational Institutions."
Narcissus Complex
Nietzsche warned, Craig said,
"universities often succomb to
a kind of Narcissus complex,
falling so deeply in love with

what they fancy to be their own
excellences. ..."
Craig pointed out another in
ternal peril facing universities,
"breakdown of effective commu
nication between the constituent
parts of the university body and
from the spread of the kind of
suspicion and distrust between
them that destroys the collabor
ative spirit upon which univer
sities depend."
He mentioned the Free Univer
sity of Berlin as a victim of such
suspicion and mistrust. The Free
University was founded in 1948
after a university in the Soviet
zone was taken over by occupa
tion forces.
Some students and faculty
members started the Free Uni
versity "to teach and to study
without ideological restriction.
Recently, however, it has fallen
prey to "internecine struggles"
caused by both a breakdown in
communication and "resistance
in some university quarters to
long overdue academic reform."
Stanford Responsive
Craig said Stanford "has been
less Narcissistic than some of
her sister institutions ..." He
said Stanford is already respond
ing to demands by students for
more of a role in university gov

brought to bear on universities
"closer to home . . . are less open
and brutal than ... in Czecho
slovakia, but they are no less in
sistent."
In talking of the internal
dangers facing the university,
Craig cited the German phil
osopher Nietzsche who gave a
lecture series on "The Future of
our Educational Institutions."
Narcissus Complex
Nietzsche warned, Craig said,
"universities often succomb to
a kind of Narcissus complex,
falling so deeply in love with

what they fancy to be their own
excellences. ..."
Craig pointed out another in
ternal peril facing universities,
"breakdown of effective commu
nication between the constituent
parts of the university body and
from the spread of the kind of
suspicion and distrust between
them that destroys the collabor
ative spirit upon which univer
sities depend."
He mentioned the Free Univer
sity of Berlin as a victim of such
suspicion and mistrust. The Free
University was founded in 1948
after a university in the Soviet
zone was taken over by occupa
tion forces.
Some students and faculty
members started the Free Uni
versity "to teach and to study
without ideological restriction.
Recently, however, it has fallen
prey to "internecine struggles"
caused by both a breakdown in
communication and "resistance
in some university quarters to
long overdue academic reform."
Stanford Responsive
Craig said Stanford "has been
less Narcissistic than some of
her sister institutions ..." He
said Stanford is already respond
ing to demands by students for
more of a role in university gov
erment and in "the decisions that
will guide this university's fu
ture," decisions concerning the

academic program, quality of
instruction, the allocation of the
university's resources and the
university's relation to "the |
wider community."
Craig said this year's fresh- '
man class will have a larger
share in these decisions than
any other in the past. "And I am
glad to think that this will be
true," he said.
He pointed out, however, that
participation in government,
particularly university govern
ment "is an onerous and diffi- I
cult business." He said the issues
"are rarely easy to resolve and
progress toward solution always
depends upon mutual patience,
tolerance and willingness to I
compromise."
He said passion is "natural and
desirable in debate over impor- 1
tant issues, but he pointed out
that students, faculty and ad
ministrators are "partners and
colleagues who must work to
gether. ..."
He also urged the freshmen
not to "assume too easily that
our ideas are better and our mo
tives nobler than those of peo
ple who disagree with us."
He concluded by welcoming
the freshman to Stanford as "col
leagues."
Craig is a nationally praised
professor of German history, ,
author of several books andJ
texts.
