# Hayes Backs Pitzer
## 
### 
Student body president Denis
Hayes yesterday announced his
personal support for Stanford
president-designate Kenneth Pit
zer.
Speaking to new students in
Memorial Auditorium, Hayes re
vealed the change from his ear
lier position. In August, after
the announcement of the new
president, Hayes said he ob
jected to the selection of the
new president because no stu
dents at Rice or Stanford were
consulted.
At that time Hayes announced
he would hold a referendum in
which students would vote
whether ti nccept Pitzer. TTe did
not announce his position on the
referendum. His speech yester
day leaves some doubt as to
whether the referendum will
even take place.
Hayes, who was elected by a
two-to-one margin last spring,
said he reached his decision in
the middle of a debate on Viet
nam. At that time he recalled
the words of an American gen
eral who had razed a Vietna
mese village—"we had to de
stroy the place to save it" — a
statement which Hayes regarded
as "totally irresponsible."
"If we were to prevent the
new president from coming to
Stanford," Hayes said, "we
would in effect destroy this uni
versity."
He said, "I have been advised
by some radicals to come in and
educate the freshman class, to
initiate you with an hour's de
nunciation of the new president,
to present you with every sordid
fact," about Pitzer.
Hayes said that conversations
with students at Rice in the last
few weeks have brought to light
new information about Pitzer's
policies at Rice. These conver
sations revealed what Hayes
called "unfortunate aspects" of
Pitzer.
Hayes said his decision would
probably classify him as a "sell
out, bourgeois" among some
segments of the student body—
"a fellow who does the trustees'

work for them without any ap
preciation from them because,
not having any contact with
Stanford, they don't realize how
close this university is to blow
ing wide open."
Hayes expressed a fear that
Stanford "has a potential for a
serious occurrence which would
dwarf . . . Columbia." He said
he was "firmly convinced" that
"a president can be educated by
students" and expressed hope
that many of the things Dr. Pit
zer said as president of .Rice in
Houston might be affected by
the "totally different" environ
ment of San Francisco.
"I think that many of the
things which he said in the pre
vious context are going to be
altered when he finds himself in
a totally different milieu . .
he said.
Hayes strongly reiterated his
belief that the trustees "grossly
misused" their legal power in
excluding strdents from the se
lection process which led to Pit
zer's appointment, effective Dec.
Ist.
"These are the people who have
comp'ete control over this uni
versity—and they seek to exer
cise it—and who have tradition
ally met on the Stanford campus
for one time each year for one
day. These are the people who
control our fates, our educa
tion."
Pre-Reg Chairman
Pre-registration is intended to
introduce the "real" Stanford to
freshmen, according to Pre-Reg
chairman Phil Taubman.
Speaking to freshmen yester
day morning in Memorial Audi
torium, Taubman said pre-regis
tration should not be "an ideo
logical wasteland in which the
virgin minds of freshman should
experience thoughts unscarred
by the rhetoric of the new left
or the theories of the far right."
Appearing with student body
president Denis Hayes and Asso
ciate Dean of Students Bill Wy
man, Taubman spoke on the
kir>ri of education offered at
Stanford, formal and informal.
laubman said that the aim of
this year's program for fresh
men and transfers is to "present
a true and realistic picture of
Stanford." He pointed out, how
ever, that much of the pre-reg
program is "on a silver platter."
"A university is a step beyond
rote examinations and dull lec
tures," he continued. Taubman
urged freshman to seek "a more
relevant education . . . that
reaches . . . into the life of the
ghetto and other very real prob
lems that plague this country,
society and world.
He also urged the freshman to
work for a "restructured uni
versity, one in which students
have a greater say and power.
I also hope you will embrace
those calls because universities
in this country are in deep trou
ble. They are directed by many
unenlightened forces and people
who are fearful of change."
The Pre-Reg co-chairman sin
gled out several issues "worthy
of demanding change." Accredi
tation of ROTC courses and the

educational interests of the
Board of Trustees were two
such issues. He also attacked
the socio-economic breakdown of
the board noting that no blacks
are on it. Almost all the mem
bers are corporation executives.
Taubman answered criticism
of the "bias" of the Pre-Reg
program saying, "we'd like you
to meet Stanford University, no
holds barred. The combat should
he neither permanently injuri
ous nor mortal, but it could be
stimulating and provacative."
Pre-Reg has scheduled a "col
loquy" for this morning with
Dean of the Chapel B. Davie Na
pier and biology professor Don
ald Kennedy. This weekend
there will be a program with
Joan Baez and her husband
Dave Harris, former student
body president, as well as a for
um on racism in America.
Taubman said that he had had
trouble convincing the Dean of
Students' office to permit the
Baez-Harris program. Taubman
predicted members of the Board
would react unfavorably to the
show and that many letters of
indignation would flow in to the
Trustees and administration.

In reference to the Vietnam,
Taubman said he was "not
about to join the genocide cam
paign in Vietnam. I'm not a paci
fist or a conscientious objector.
I'm just a guy who doesn't care
to fight a war in Asia that ex
ists because of a man's mis
judgements and an administra
tion's refusal to admit mistakes.
You'll meet a lot like me this
year. It's part of going to Stan
ford."
The freshmen applauded this
remark.
Taubman was also critical of
the Stanford administration's re
fusal to allow him to speak at
the Freshman Convocation. He
said he asked last spring to be
allowed to speak and was told
that the Convocation was a "Uni
versity function and no student
would speak."

to meet Stanford University, no
holds barred. The combat should
he neither permanently injuri
ous nor mortal, but it could be
stimulating and provacative."
Pre-Reg has scheduled a "col
loquy" for this morning with
Dean of the Chapel B. Davie Na
pier and biology professor Don
ald Kennedy. This weekend
there will be a program with
Joan Baez and her husband
Dave Harris, former student
body president, as well as a for
um on racism in America.
Taubman said that he had had
trouble convincing the Dean of
Students' office to permit the
Baez-Harris program. Taubman
predicted members of the Board
would react unfavorably to the
show and that many letters of
indignation would flow in to the
Trustees and administration.

In reference to the Vietnam,
Taubman said he was "not
about to join the genocide cam
paign in Vietnam. I'm not a paci
fist or a conscientious objector.
I'm just a guy who doesn't care
to fight a war in Asia that ex
ists because of a man's mis
judgements and an administra
tion's refusal to admit mistakes.
You'll meet a lot like me this
year. It's part of going to Stan
ford."
The freshmen applauded this
remark.
Taubman was also critical of
the Stanford administration's re
fusal to allow him to speak at
the Freshman Convocation. He
said he asked last spring to be
allowed to speak and was told
that the Convocation was a "Uni
versity function and no student
would speak."
Student body president Denis
Hayes yesterday announced his
personal support for Stanford
president-designate Kenneth Pit
zer.
Speaking to new students in
Memorial Auditorium, Hayes re
vealed the change from his ear
lier position. In August, after
the announcement of the new
president, Hayes said he ob
jected to the selection of the
new president because no stu
dents at Rice or Stanford were
consulted.
At that time Hayes announced
he would hold a referendum in
which students would vote
whether ti nccept Pitzer. TTe did
not announce his position on the
referendum. His speech yester
day leaves some doubt as to
whether the referendum will
even take place.
Hayes, who was elected by a
two-to-one margin last spring,
said he reached his decision in
the middle of a debate on Viet
nam. At that time he recalled
the words of an American gen
eral who had razed a Vietna
mese village—"we had to de
stroy the place to save it" — a
statement which Hayes regarded
as "totally irresponsible."
"If we were to prevent the
new president from coming to
Stanford," Hayes said, "we
would in effect destroy this uni
versity."
He said, "I have been advised
by some radicals to come in and
educate the freshman class, to
initiate you with an hour's de
nunciation of the new president,
to present you with every sordid
fact," about Pitzer.
Hayes said that conversations
with students at Rice in the last
few weeks have brought to light
new information about Pitzer's
policies at Rice. These conver
sations revealed what Hayes
called "unfortunate aspects" of
Pitzer.
Hayes said his decision would
probably classify him as a "sell
out, bourgeois" among some
segments of the student body—
"a fellow who does the trustees'

work for them without any ap
preciation from them because,
not having any contact with
Stanford, they don't realize how
close this university is to blow
ing wide open."
Hayes expressed a fear that
Stanford "has a potential for a
serious occurrence which would
dwarf . . . Columbia." He said
he was "firmly convinced" that
"a president can be educated by
students" and expressed hope
that many of the things Dr. Pit
zer said as president of .Rice in
Houston might be affected by
the "totally different" environ
ment of San Francisco.
"I think that many of the
things which he said in the pre
vious context are going to be
altered when he finds himself in
a totally different milieu . .
he said.
Hayes strongly reiterated his
belief that the trustees "grossly
misused" their legal power in
excluding strdents from the se
lection process which led to Pit
zer's appointment, effective Dec.
Ist.
"These are the people who have
comp'ete control over this uni
versity—and they seek to exer
cise it—and who have tradition
ally met on the Stanford campus
for one time each year for one
day. These are the people who
control our fates, our educa
tion."
Pre-Reg Chairman
Pre-registration is intended to
introduce the "real" Stanford to
freshmen, according to Pre-Reg
chairman Phil Taubman.
Speaking to freshmen yester
day morning in Memorial Audi
torium, Taubman said pre-regis
tration should not be "an ideo
logical wasteland in which the
virgin minds of freshman should
experience thoughts unscarred
by the rhetoric of the new left
or the theories of the far right."
Appearing with student body
president Denis Hayes and Asso
ciate Dean of Students Bill Wy
man, Taubman spoke on the
kir>ri of education offered at
Stanford, formal and informal.
laubman said that the aim of
this year's program for fresh
men and transfers is to "present
a true and realistic picture of
Stanford." He pointed out, how
ever, that much of the pre-reg
program is "on a silver platter."
"A university is a step beyond
rote examinations and dull lec
tures," he continued. Taubman
urged freshman to seek "a more
relevant education . . . that
reaches . . . into the life of the
ghetto and other very real prob
lems that plague this country,
society and world.
He also urged the freshman to
work for a "restructured uni
versity, one in which students
have a greater say and power.
I also hope you will embrace
those calls because universities
in this country are in deep trou
ble. They are directed by many
unenlightened forces and people
who are fearful of change."
The Pre-Reg co-chairman sin
gled out several issues "worthy
of demanding change." Accredi
tation of ROTC courses and the

educational interests of the
Board of Trustees were two
such issues. He also attacked
the socio-economic breakdown of
the board noting that no blacks
are on it. Almost all the mem
bers are corporation executives.
Taubman answered criticism
of the "bias" of the Pre-Reg
program saying, "we'd like you
to meet Stanford University, no
holds barred. The combat should
he neither permanently injuri
ous nor mortal, but it could be

by the rhetoric of the new left
or the theories of the far right."
Appearing with student body
president Denis Hayes and Asso
ciate Dean of Students Bill Wy
man, Taubman spoke on the
kir>ri of education offered at
Stanford, formal and informal.
laubman said that the aim of
this year's program for fresh
men and transfers is to "present
a true and realistic picture of
Stanford." He pointed out, how
ever, that much of the pre-reg
program is "on a silver platter."
"A university is a step beyond
rote examinations and dull lec
tures," he continued. Taubman
urged freshman to seek "a more
relevant education . . . that
reaches . . . into the life of the
ghetto and other very real prob
lems that plague this country,
society and world.
He also urged the freshman to
work for a "restructured uni
versity, one in which students
have a greater say and power.
I also hope you will embrace
those calls because universities
in this country are in deep trou
ble. They are directed by many
unenlightened forces and people
who are fearful of change."
The Pre-Reg co-chairman sin
gled out several issues "worthy
of demanding change." Accredi
tation of ROTC courses and the

educational interests of the
Board of Trustees were two
such issues. He also attacked
the socio-economic breakdown of
the board noting that no blacks
are on it. Almost all the mem
bers are corporation executives.
Taubman answered criticism
of the "bias" of the Pre-Reg
program saying, "we'd like you
to meet Stanford University, no
holds barred. The combat should
he neither permanently injuri
ous nor mortal, but it could be
stimulating and provacative."
Pre-Reg has scheduled a "col
loquy" for this morning with
Dean of the Chapel B. Davie Na
pier and biology professor Don
ald Kennedy. This weekend
there will be a program with
Joan Baez and her husband
Dave Harris, former student
body president, as well as a for
um on racism in America.
Taubman said that he had had
trouble convincing the Dean of
Students' office to permit the
Baez-Harris program. Taubman
predicted members of the Board
would react unfavorably to the
show and that many letters of
indignation would flow in to the
Trustees and administration.

In reference to the Vietnam,
Taubman said he was "not
about to join the genocide cam
paign in Vietnam. I'm not a paci
fist or a conscientious objector.
I'm just a guy who doesn't care
to fight a war in Asia that ex
ists because of a man's mis
judgements and an administra
tion's refusal to admit mistakes.
You'll meet a lot like me this
year. It's part of going to Stan
ford."
The freshmen applauded this
remark.
Taubman was also critical of
the Stanford administration's re
fusal to allow him to speak at
the Freshman Convocation. He
said he asked last spring to be
allowed to speak and was told
that the Convocation was a "Uni
versity function and no student
would speak."
Student body president Denis
Hayes yesterday announced his
personal support for Stanford
president-designate Kenneth Pit
zer.
Speaking to new students in
Memorial Auditorium, Hayes re
vealed the change from his ear
lier position. In August, after
the announcement of the new
president, Hayes said he ob
jected to the selection of the
new president because no stu
dents at Rice or Stanford were
consulted.
At that time Hayes announced
he would hold a referendum in
which students would vote
whether ti nccept Pitzer. TTe did
not announce his position on the
referendum. His speech yester
day leaves some doubt as to
whether the referendum will
even take place.
Hayes, who was elected by a
two-to-one margin last spring,
said he reached his decision in
the middle of a debate on Viet
nam. At that time he recalled
the words of an American gen
eral who had razed a Vietna
mese village—"we had to de
stroy the place to save it" — a
statement which Hayes regarded
as "totally irresponsible."
"If we were to prevent the
new president from coming to
Stanford," Hayes said, "we
would in effect destroy this uni
versity."
He said, "I have been advised
by some radicals to come in and
educate the freshman class, to
initiate you with an hour's de
nunciation of the new president,
to present you with every sordid
fact," about Pitzer.
Hayes said that conversations
with students at Rice in the last
few weeks have brought to light
new information about Pitzer's
policies at Rice. These conver
sations revealed what Hayes
called "unfortunate aspects" of
Pitzer.
Hayes said his decision would
probably classify him as a "sell
out, bourgeois" among some
segments of the student body—
"a fellow who does the trustees'

work for them without any ap
preciation from them because,
not having any contact with
Stanford, they don't realize how
close this university is to blow
ing wide open."
Hayes expressed a fear that
Stanford "has a potential for a
serious occurrence which would
dwarf . . . Columbia." He said
he was "firmly convinced" that
"a president can be educated by
students" and expressed hope
that many of the things Dr. Pit
zer said as president of .Rice in
Houston might be affected by
the "totally different" environ
ment of San Francisco.
"I think that many of the
things which he said in the pre
vious context are going to be
altered when he finds himself in
a totally different milieu . .
he said.
Hayes strongly reiterated his
belief that the trustees "grossly
misused" their legal power in
excluding strdents from the se
lection process which led to Pit
zer's appointment, effective Dec.
Ist.
"These are the people who have
comp'ete control over this uni
versity—and they seek to exer
cise it—and who have tradition
ally met on the Stanford campus
for one time each year for one
day. These are the people who
control our fates, our educa
tion."
