# Hayes Backs Pitzer

Student body president Denis
Hayes yesterday announced his
personal support for Stanford
president-designate Kenneth Pit
zer.
Speaking to new students in
Memorial Auditorium, Hayes re
vealed the change from his ear
lier position. In August, after
the announcement of the new
president, Hayes said he ob
jected to the selection of the
new president because no stu
dents at Rice or Stanford were
consulted.
At that time Hayes announced
he would hold a referendum in
which students would vote
whether ti nccept Pitzer. TTe did
not announce his position on the
referendum. His speech yester
day leaves some doubt as to
whether the referendum will
even take place.
Hayes, who was elected by a
two-to-one margin last spring,
said he reached his decision in
the middle of a debate on Viet
nam. At that time he recalled
the words of an American gen
eral who had razed a Vietna
mese village—"we had to de
stroy the place to save it" — a
statement which Hayes regarded
as "totally irresponsible."
"If we were to prevent the
new president from coming to
Stanford," Hayes said, "we
would in effect destroy this uni
versity."
He said, "I have been advised
by some radicals to come in and
educate the freshman class, to
initiate you with an hour's de
nunciation of the new president,
to present you with every sordid
fact," about Pitzer.
Hayes said that conversations
with students at Rice in the last
few weeks have brought to light
new information about Pitzer's
policies at Rice. These conver
sations revealed what Hayes
called "unfortunate aspects" of
Pitzer.
Hayes said his decision would
probably classify him as a "sell
out, bourgeois" among some
segments of the student body—
"a fellow who does the trustees'

work for them without any ap
preciation from them because,
not having any contact with
Stanford, they don't realize how
close this university is to blow
ing wide open."
Hayes expressed a fear that
Stanford "has a potential for a
serious occurrence which would
dwarf . . . Columbia." He said
he was "firmly convinced" that
"a president can be educated by
students" and expressed hope
that many of the things Dr. Pit
zer said as president of .Rice in
Houston might be affected by
the "totally different" environ
ment of San Francisco.
"I think that many of the
things which he said in the pre
vious context are going to be
altered when he finds himself in
a totally different milieu . .
he said.
Hayes strongly reiterated his
belief that the trustees "grossly
misused" their legal power in
excluding strdents from the se
lection process which led to Pit
zer's appointment, effective Dec.
Ist.
"These are the people who have
comp'ete control over this uni
versity—and they seek to exer
cise it—and who have tradition
ally met on the Stanford campus
for one time each year for one
day. These are the people who
control our fates, our educa
tion."
Pre-Reg Chairman
Pre-registration is intended to
introduce the "real" Stanford to
freshmen, according to Pre-Reg
chairman Phil Taubman.
Speaking to freshmen yester
day morning in Memorial Audi
torium, Taubman said pre-regis
tration should not be "an ideo
logical wasteland in which the
virgin minds of freshman should
experience thoughts unscarred
by the rhetoric of the new left
or the theories of the far right."
