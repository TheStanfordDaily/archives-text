## 
### 
Acting president Robert Gla
ser Wednesday night welcomed
freshmen to Stanford. Speaking
at the annual, Freshman Convo
cation he said, "There is no
place here for the status quo."
He called on freshmen and
other students to continue their
contribution to "constructive
change" in university curricula
and governance.
"Change is often not easy,
even when it is in order or, in
deed, overdue. All of us who
have supported change . . . rec
ognize the frustration that re
sults when progress is slow. Yet
the need to achieve change amid
order and order amid change

commends itself to us all," he
said.
Dr. Glaser, who also serves as
dean of the medical school, was
named acting president on July
9. He will hold office until Presi
dent-designate Pitzer takes over
December 1.
He has been at Stanford since
1965. He is vice-president for
medical affairs of the university
and also served on the faculty
presidential selection committee.
Wants Meaningful Exchange
In an interview with The
Daily over the summer, Glaser
revealed that he wanted "a more
meaningful exchange between
students, faculty, administra
tors and trustees."
"We all won't be playing
flutes in the Elysian Fields. But
if we cannot begin to resolve
some of our problems in a uni
versity community where we
have excellent people with excel
lent minds, we can't do it any
where in the country," he said
in the interview.
In his remarks Wednesday
night he said the dissatisfaction
of the youth of the world is un
derstandable because of "an un
popular war," "urban blight,"
and "racial problems that are
the inevitable result of decades
of injustice."
In his temporary position Gla
ser will still serve as dean of
the medical school. His offices
are in Building 1 since the Pres
ident's office has not yet been
rebuilt following July's arson.
