# Helpful Hints
## How To Avoid The Draft 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
The freshman years is a fine
time for men to start worrying
about the draft. In fact, no one
can afford not to start worrying
if he wants to finish his college
education without interruption.
Under the new draft regula
tions effective July 1, 1967, as
under the old law, the college
student must actively seek and
defend his student deferment.
Local draft boards, struggling
to fill their mandatory monthly
quotas for the Army, are
always ready to draft a student

who somehow runs afoul of
regulations.
As a first step, freshmen men
should:
• If not yet 18, be sure to
immediately register for the
draft after your 18th birthday.
(Neglecting to register is a
lousy way to draft-dodge. The
FBI tracks you down and you
are immediately inducted.) If
your home is in the Stanford
area, register at your local draft
board office. Otherwise, go to
the Stanford National Service
office in the Old Union for in

formation on how to register.
• If you're already registered,
you must apply in writing to
your local board for a 11-S
classification. Many draft boards
have mailed out Selective Ser
vice form 104 for this purpose.
If you haven't received it, a for
mal letter to your draft board is
permissible.
To get the 11-S deferment, the
student must also obtain certi
fication from Stanford Univers
ity that he is "satisfactorily pur
suing a full-time course of in
struction." The University gives
this certification automatically
to anyone who registers, says
Stanford's National Service Ad
viser. In the packet of registra
tion materials given to each stu
dent during registered Septem
der 24 and 25 will be a card for
this purpose.
I,egal Right to 11-S
Once you have requested the
11-S, you have a legal right to
keep it "until such registrant
completes the requirement for
his baccalaureate degree, fails to
pursue satisfactorily a full-time
course of instruction, or attains
the 24th anniversary of ... his
girth, which ever occurs first,"
according to the Executive Or
der implementing the new law
June 30, 1967.
Each year you must send
some kind of evidence to your
local draft board that you are
still "satisfactorily pursuing a
full-time course of instruction."
What constitutes satisfactory
pursuit is not entirely clear. To
be safe, a Stanford student must
have completed 45 units by the
end of his freshman year, since
that equals the"25 per cent of
the credits required for his
baccalaureate degree," which is
the criterion for "satisfactory"
progress given by the Executive
Order.
There is one catch to the 11-S.
Anyone who receives this de
ferment is automatically inelig
ible to receive a fatherhood de
ferment later in life. Freshmen
who are planning to have chil
dren soon should instead seek
the I-S(C) deferment, good until
the end of the academic year.
Freshmen who are planning to
father children are also ad
vised to get married, since draft

board members are notorious
for their low thresholds of moral
indignation.
Another solution to the draft
threat is to join ROTC. Stanford
has Army, Air Force and Navy
outfits. ROTC cadets are given
an air-tight I-D classification un
til they receive their baccalaur
eate. There are some disadvant
ages to ROTC, of course. You
obligate yourself to four years'
service as an officer. You must
take ROTC courses and partici
pate in drills.
If ROTC doesn't appeal to a
freshman, he can consider be
coming a conscientious objector
(CO). This is easier said than
done.
The CO classifications, I-A-O
and I-O, are akin to wisdom:
many seek but few find. Draft
boards are usually hostile. The
freshman interested in CO
should apply for this status im
mediately after registering for
the draft. He should investigate
carefully the religious and neo
religious grounds for CO. He
should be ready to make per
sonal appearances before his
local draft board and, if neces
sary, his state draft appeals
board.
Changes In Law
The 1967 draft law deleted the
traditional definition of CO: a
person whose "belief in relation
to a Supreme Being involving
duties superior to those arising
from any human relationship."
The law retained the provision
that grounds for CO status
does not include essentially
political, sociological, or philoso
phical views or merely personal
moral code."

eate. There are some disadvant
ages to ROTC, of course. You
obligate yourself to four years'
service as an officer. You must
take ROTC courses and partici
pate in drills.
If ROTC doesn't appeal to a
freshman, he can consider be
coming a conscientious objector
(CO). This is easier said than
done.
The CO classifications, I-A-O
and I-O, are akin to wisdom:
many seek but few find. Draft
boards are usually hostile. The
freshman interested in CO
should apply for this status im
mediately after registering for
the draft. He should investigate
carefully the religious and neo
religious grounds for CO. He
should be ready to make per
sonal appearances before his
local draft board and, if neces
sary, his state draft appeals
board.
Changes In Law
The 1967 draft law deleted the
traditional definition of CO: a
person whose "belief in relation
to a Supreme Being involving
duties superior to those arising
from any human relationship."
The law retained the provision
that grounds for CO status
does not include essentially
political, sociological, or philoso
phical views or merely personal
moral code."
The freshman years is a fine
time for men to start worrying
about the draft. In fact, no one
can afford not to start worrying
if he wants to finish his college
education without interruption.
Under the new draft regula
tions effective July 1, 1967, as
under the old law, the college
student must actively seek and
defend his student deferment.
Local draft boards, struggling
to fill their mandatory monthly
quotas for the Army, are
always ready to draft a student

who somehow runs afoul of
regulations.
As a first step, freshmen men
should:
• If not yet 18, be sure to
immediately register for the
draft after your 18th birthday.
(Neglecting to register is a
lousy way to draft-dodge. The
FBI tracks you down and you
are immediately inducted.) If
your home is in the Stanford
area, register at your local draft
board office. Otherwise, go to
the Stanford National Service
office in the Old Union for in

formation on how to register.
• If you're already registered,
you must apply in writing to
your local board for a 11-S
classification. Many draft boards
have mailed out Selective Ser
vice form 104 for this purpose.
If you haven't received it, a for
mal letter to your draft board is
permissible.
To get the 11-S deferment, the
student must also obtain certi
fication from Stanford Univers
ity that he is "satisfactorily pur
suing a full-time course of in
struction." The University gives
this certification automatically
to anyone who registers, says
Stanford's National Service Ad
viser. In the packet of registra
tion materials given to each stu
dent during registered Septem
der 24 and 25 will be a card for
this purpose.
I,egal Right to 11-S
Once you have requested the
11-S, you have a legal right to
keep it "until such registrant
completes the requirement for
his baccalaureate degree, fails to
pursue satisfactorily a full-time
course of instruction, or attains
the 24th anniversary of ... his
girth, which ever occurs first,"
according to the Executive Or
der implementing the new law
June 30, 1967.
Each year you must send
some kind of evidence to your
local draft board that you are
still "satisfactorily pursuing a
full-time course of instruction."
What constitutes satisfactory
pursuit is not entirely clear. To
be safe, a Stanford student must
have completed 45 units by the
end of his freshman year, since
that equals the"25 per cent of
the credits required for his
baccalaureate degree," which is
the criterion for "satisfactory"
progress given by the Executive
Order.
There is one catch to the 11-S.
Anyone who receives this de
ferment is automatically inelig
ible to receive a fatherhood de
ferment later in life. Freshmen
who are planning to have chil
dren soon should instead seek
the I-S(C) deferment, good until
the end of the academic year.
Freshmen who are planning to
father children are also ad
vised to get married, since draft

board members are notorious
for their low thresholds of moral
indignation.
Another solution to the draft
threat is to join ROTC. Stanford
has Army, Air Force and Navy
outfits. ROTC cadets are given
an air-tight I-D classification un
til they receive their baccalaur
eate. There are some disadvant
ages to ROTC, of course. You
obligate yourself to four years'

Each year you must send
some kind of evidence to your
local draft board that you are
still "satisfactorily pursuing a
full-time course of instruction."
What constitutes satisfactory
pursuit is not entirely clear. To
be safe, a Stanford student must
have completed 45 units by the
end of his freshman year, since
that equals the"25 per cent of
the credits required for his
baccalaureate degree," which is
the criterion for "satisfactory"
progress given by the Executive
Order.
There is one catch to the 11-S.
Anyone who receives this de
ferment is automatically inelig
ible to receive a fatherhood de
ferment later in life. Freshmen
who are planning to have chil
dren soon should instead seek
the I-S(C) deferment, good until
the end of the academic year.
Freshmen who are planning to
father children are also ad
vised to get married, since draft

board members are notorious
for their low thresholds of moral
indignation.
Another solution to the draft
threat is to join ROTC. Stanford
has Army, Air Force and Navy
outfits. ROTC cadets are given
an air-tight I-D classification un
til they receive their baccalaur
eate. There are some disadvant
ages to ROTC, of course. You
obligate yourself to four years'
service as an officer. You must
take ROTC courses and partici
pate in drills.
If ROTC doesn't appeal to a
freshman, he can consider be
coming a conscientious objector
(CO). This is easier said than
done.
The CO classifications, I-A-O
and I-O, are akin to wisdom:
many seek but few find. Draft
boards are usually hostile. The
freshman interested in CO
should apply for this status im
mediately after registering for
the draft. He should investigate
carefully the religious and neo
religious grounds for CO. He
should be ready to make per
sonal appearances before his
local draft board and, if neces
sary, his state draft appeals
board.
Changes In Law
The 1967 draft law deleted the
traditional definition of CO: a
person whose "belief in relation
to a Supreme Being involving
duties superior to those arising
from any human relationship."
The law retained the provision
that grounds for CO status
does not include essentially
political, sociological, or philoso
phical views or merely personal
moral code."
