Several changes have been
made in the General Studies pro
gram which will affect many un
dergraduates. Also, liberalization
of the science requirement has
been proposed to the academic
senate.
Potentially the most signifi
cant change Is the recommenda
tion to the academic senate that
the requirement that students
take biology or physical science
if they have not had it in high
school be abolished.
Currently, for example, a stu
dent who has not had biology in
high school is required to take
the introductory biology series
at Stanford.
The General Studies commit

tee recommended to the aca
lemic senate that this require
ment be abolished, but the aca
demic senate has not yet acted
on the recommendation, so the
present requirement is still in
force.
Five courses in sociology be
yond the introductory level have
been approved for the social sci
ence area requirement. All stu
dents are now required to take
ten units of social science under
the General Studies program.
The requirement had been two
courses but some of the newly
approved sociology courses are
given for three to five units, in
stead of the usual five only.
The units must be from at least

two departments. The newly ap
proved courses are Sociology 50,
55, 103, 105, and 123.
The only exceptions to the ten
unit requirement are the four
unit social science courses given
at the overseas campuses and In
th % summer session. Each such
course will be counted as if it
were five units for the General
Studies program only.
The final change, already ap
proved, is that students who only
take one quarter of the experi
mental English series (English
IA, B, 1C) will have to take th en
quarters of English. The experi
mental series is a twr> r
nin >-unit series that satisfies the
freshman English requirement.
