# Too Many Freshmen Jam Residences
## 
### My MARSHALL KILDUFF 
This year's freshmen class
has placed the university in a
painful administrative bind. Not
only is the entering class 13%
larger than ever before, but this
sharp increase comes at a time
when the Dean of Student's of
fice is attempting to modify the
complicated campus residence
system.
The Dean's office has man
aged to successfully place in
dorms all the freshmen and also
students who were on campus
last spring and stayed through
the two housing draws and the

summer waiting lists. But in
order to accommodate everyone,
there have been some unfor
tunate but npoascarv changes in
rooming assignments.
Many singles in Roble and
Lagunita have been converted
into crowded doubles, and resi
dents in Roble will eat dinner
in two shifts.
Three Reasons
Assistant Dean Bob Rosch
points out three reasons which
have led to the tight rooming
situation. First too many fresh
men accepted. This year 1449
students decided to attend, an

increase of 17 over last year.
Normally allowances are made
for 15 to 20 more students than
expected, but this freshman
class put a severe strain on the
housing situation.
Secondly women transfer stu
dents are usually not accepted
unless there is housing on cam
pus for them. This year admis
sions officials felt there were
too many qualified students that
were being turned away, and
they chose to ignore this rule.
However, many of the women
applied for the residence sys
tem, and at best they will have
to rely on the long waiting lists
for openings.
Thirdly, the graduate schools
overaccepted in anticipation that
the draft would claim some stu
dents. But the monthly draft
call-ups have not been as large
as expected, and the surplus stu
dents are keeping up the de
mand for rooms, both on and off
campus.
"Return to Normalcy"
Why did so many freshmen
accept? Director of Admissions
Rixford K. Snyder explained
that "this is not a permanent in
crease. Stanford seemed to be
more popular this year and thus
had the highest acceptance rate
in history." He promised a "re
turn to normalcy next year."
/he Admissions Office will ac
tvpr niOi-e 5 '.dents than it has
room for since it assumes that
many students will choose to go
to other schools. But Snyder said
that enthusiastic recruiting by
different campus groups be
tween the April acceptance noti
fications and the May deposit
deadline was a main reason for
the large class.
BSU Phoned
The Black Student Union tele
phoned all black students who
were accepted, resulting in 67
deciding to come. Last year
there were 37 blacks. Also some
70 undergraduates wrote letters
encouraging students to attend,
and in some cases academic de
partments wrote to students
who showed exceptional ability
or an interest in majoring in a
special field.
In the face of this admissions
problem, efforts have been made
to create more space on campus.
Roble has 33 more students in it
than last year, bringing its total
to 297. In Lagunita the large
houses have 11 singles that are
now doubles, and the smaller
houses have eight that are
changed. Last year Lagunita had

278 students, and now it has
330.
Two house trailers formerly
used by the Alpha Sigma fra
ternity are filled by extra stu
dents from Toyon. The old ATO
house has been ref"rbished and
' *Btr~ ' House,

and it now holds about 35 men.
Draw Problems
Problems have also arisen
with the draw system. In gen
eral it was satisfactory, but the
mechanics of shifting and rear
ranging rooming preferences
proved bulky. Hopefu'ly a com
puter will be us'»d to facilitate
the next draw. In some cases,
'ho Dean's OfTiee had to chanj™
•noming assignments during the
;"mmer that had been previous
ly confirmed in June.
Yet in snite of th° difficulties,
the university h -1 s succeeded in
rearranging the resi-
system alon rr coeducation
•i' and mu'ticlass lines. As an ex
cmrle, freshmen this year are
in a'l residences exc >nt Row
ho 'ses Lathrop, Story, Roth, and
Guthrie and two Lagunita
houses Granada and Eucalypto.
Assistant D°an Rosch said
that part of his job will he to
keep in touch with students so
that the residence svstem will
continue to refl n ct their needs,
lie stressed that the housing
set-up now is by no per
manent, and it is intended to
remain flexible.

now doubles, and the smaller
houses have eight that are
changed. Last year Lagunita had

278 students, and now it has
330.
Two house trailers formerly
used by the Alpha Sigma fra
ternity are filled by extra stu
dents from Toyon. The old ATO
house has been ref"rbished and
' *Btr~ ' House,

and it now holds about 35 men.
Draw Problems
Problems have also arisen
with the draw system. In gen
eral it was satisfactory, but the
mechanics of shifting and rear
ranging rooming preferences
proved bulky. Hopefu'ly a com
puter will be us'»d to facilitate
the next draw. In some cases,
'ho Dean's OfTiee had to chanj™
•noming assignments during the
;"mmer that had been previous
ly confirmed in June.
Yet in snite of th° difficulties,
the university h -1 s succeeded in
rearranging the resi-
system alon rr coeducation
•i' and mu'ticlass lines. As an ex
cmrle, freshmen this year are
in a'l residences exc >nt Row
ho 'ses Lathrop, Story, Roth, and
Guthrie and two Lagunita
houses Granada and Eucalypto.
Assistant D°an Rosch said
that part of his job will he to
keep in touch with students so
that the residence svstem will
continue to refl n ct their needs,
lie stressed that the housing
set-up now is by no per
manent, and it is intended to
remain flexible.
This year's freshmen class
has placed the university in a
painful administrative bind. Not
only is the entering class 13%
larger than ever before, but this
sharp increase comes at a time
when the Dean of Student's of
fice is attempting to modify the
complicated campus residence
system.
The Dean's office has man
aged to successfully place in
dorms all the freshmen and also
students who were on campus
last spring and stayed through
the two housing draws and the

summer waiting lists. But in
order to accommodate everyone,
there have been some unfor
tunate but npoascarv changes in
rooming assignments.
Many singles in Roble and
Lagunita have been converted
into crowded doubles, and resi
dents in Roble will eat dinner
in two shifts.
Three Reasons
Assistant Dean Bob Rosch
points out three reasons which
have led to the tight rooming
situation. First too many fresh
men accepted. This year 1449
students decided to attend, an

increase of 17 over last year.
Normally allowances are made
for 15 to 20 more students than
expected, but this freshman
class put a severe strain on the
housing situation.
Secondly women transfer stu
dents are usually not accepted
unless there is housing on cam
pus for them. This year admis
sions officials felt there were
too many qualified students that
were being turned away, and
they chose to ignore this rule.
However, many of the women
applied for the residence sys
tem, and at best they will have
to rely on the long waiting lists
for openings.
Thirdly, the graduate schools
overaccepted in anticipation that
the draft would claim some stu
dents. But the monthly draft
call-ups have not been as large
as expected, and the surplus stu
dents are keeping up the de
mand for rooms, both on and off
campus.
"Return to Normalcy"
Why did so many freshmen
accept? Director of Admissions
Rixford K. Snyder explained
that "this is not a permanent in
crease. Stanford seemed to be
more popular this year and thus
had the highest acceptance rate
in history." He promised a "re
turn to normalcy next year."
/he Admissions Office will ac
tvpr niOi-e 5 '.dents than it has
room for since it assumes that
many students will choose to go
to other schools. But Snyder said
that enthusiastic recruiting by
different campus groups be
tween the April acceptance noti
fications and the May deposit
deadline was a main reason for
the large class.
BSU Phoned
The Black Student Union tele
phoned all black students who
were accepted, resulting in 67
deciding to come. Last year
there were 37 blacks. Also some
70 undergraduates wrote letters
encouraging students to attend,
and in some cases academic de
partments wrote to students
who showed exceptional ability
or an interest in majoring in a
special field.
In the face of this admissions
problem, efforts have been made
to create more space on campus.
Roble has 33 more students in it
than last year, bringing its total
to 297. In Lagunita the large
houses have 11 singles that are

overaccepted in anticipation that
the draft would claim some stu
dents. But the monthly draft
call-ups have not been as large
as expected, and the surplus stu
dents are keeping up the de
mand for rooms, both on and off
campus.
"Return to Normalcy"
Why did so many freshmen
accept? Director of Admissions
Rixford K. Snyder explained
that "this is not a permanent in
crease. Stanford seemed to be
more popular this year and thus
had the highest acceptance rate
in history." He promised a "re
turn to normalcy next year."
/he Admissions Office will ac
tvpr niOi-e 5 '.dents than it has
room for since it assumes that
many students will choose to go
to other schools. But Snyder said
that enthusiastic recruiting by
different campus groups be
tween the April acceptance noti
fications and the May deposit
deadline was a main reason for
the large class.
BSU Phoned
The Black Student Union tele
phoned all black students who
were accepted, resulting in 67
deciding to come. Last year
there were 37 blacks. Also some
70 undergraduates wrote letters
encouraging students to attend,
and in some cases academic de
partments wrote to students
who showed exceptional ability
or an interest in majoring in a
special field.
In the face of this admissions
problem, efforts have been made
to create more space on campus.
Roble has 33 more students in it
than last year, bringing its total
to 297. In Lagunita the large
houses have 11 singles that are
now doubles, and the smaller
houses have eight that are
changed. Last year Lagunita had

278 students, and now it has
330.
Two house trailers formerly
used by the Alpha Sigma fra
ternity are filled by extra stu
dents from Toyon. The old ATO
house has been ref"rbished and
' *Btr~ ' House,

and it now holds about 35 men.
Draw Problems
Problems have also arisen
with the draw system. In gen
eral it was satisfactory, but the
mechanics of shifting and rear
ranging rooming preferences
proved bulky. Hopefu'ly a com
puter will be us'»d to facilitate
the next draw. In some cases,
'ho Dean's OfTiee had to chanj™
•noming assignments during the
;"mmer that had been previous
ly confirmed in June.
Yet in snite of th° difficulties,
the university h -1 s succeeded in
rearranging the resi-
system alon rr coeducation
•i' and mu'ticlass lines. As an ex
cmrle, freshmen this year are
in a'l residences exc >nt Row
ho 'ses Lathrop, Story, Roth, and
Guthrie and two Lagunita
houses Granada and Eucalypto.
Assistant D°an Rosch said
that part of his job will he to
keep in touch with students so
that the residence svstem will
continue to refl n ct their needs,
lie stressed that the housing
set-up now is by no per
manent, and it is intended to
remain flexible.
