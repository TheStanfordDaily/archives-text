# "Racism And Prejudice"
## Course On Contemporary Society 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Four days after the assassina
tion of Martin Luther King last
April, members of Stanford's
Black Student Union (BSU)
took over the microphone from
Provost Richard Lyman during
an all-day colloquium on racism
and presented ten demands to
the University.
The demands dealt mainly
with admitting more minority
group students and hiring more
black faculty and staff. But as
an outgrowth of the controver
sy, curricular changes have also
been instituted.
The major innovation for this
year is a three-quarter course,
Undergraduate Special 170 A, B,
and C. Its title is "Racism and
Prejudice: An Interdisciplinary
Approach to the Problems of
Minority Groups and the Under
privileged in Contemporary So
ciety."
Twelve Professors
Twelve professors will partici
pate in the course, which was
originated and organized by two
History instructors, Oliver Wen
dell Holmes and Frank Foster.
More than 100 students pre
registered for the course last
spring, and there is room for
about 150 more. Lectures will be
held Tuesday and Thursday at
1:15 in Cubberley Auditorium.
There will also be 15 discus
sion sections led by 11 TAs. Fos

ter noted that all students must
register for one of the sections.
Sign-up lists will be available.
A list of TAs and topics will ap
pear in Monday's Daily.
St udonts who preregistered
for the course should sign up
for sections in room 2008, His
tory Corner, from 1 to 5 p.m.
Wednesday, September 25.
Many Departments Represented
Professors who will give lec
tures include Gavin I. Lang
muir, History; Frederick P.
Bowser, History; G. Wesley
Johnson, History; Charles Drek
meier, Political Science; James
Gibbs, Anthropology; Sanford
Dornbush, Sociology; J. Hyams,
History from San Francisco
State; Richard Fagen, Political
Science; Barton Bernstein, His
tory; Carl N. Degler, History;
Robert Coen, Economics; and
Michael Wald, Law.
The course can be taken for
three, four, or five units.
The second quarter of UG 170
will be similar to the first part.
In the spring, however, the
course will be a research-orient
ed seminar open only to a select
number of students and faculty
who will have taken either of
the first two courses.
Fie'd trips are also planned to
ghetto areas- East Palo Alto,
East San Jose, and possibly Oak
land—so the students "can re
late theory with practice, see

what's really happening,"
Holmes said.
The various sections will be
led by people from many differ
ent departments, but there will
bo no attempt to urge students
to register for the group headed
by someone in their own field,
Foster said.
"The whole point of the
course is to kind of open things
up a bit," he added.
How did the course come
about? After the BSU presented
its demands, Holmes explained,
"everyone began to entertain the
notion of giving courses on
black culture and history." The
problem was in finding qualified
professors.
Holmes and Foster got the
of drawing on the specific
knowledge of the professors al
ready here, establishing a course
to explore a wide range of ques
tions, such as: What does it
mean to live in a prejudiced so
ciety? What is the psychology
and sociology of prejudice?
The course will also consider
topics such as cultural margin
ality—the difficulty that some
groups, such as Cubans and
Puerto Ricans, have in adjust
ing to American society—and
"how the system perpetuates in
equitous conditions, poverty, and
how some groups are subjected
to it more than others due to
their cultural and educational
backgrounds," Holmes said.
Different Departments
He feels such a course Is es
pecially important here because
"most of the kids come from
suburban America — especially
suburban California," and have
had no exposure to the problems
of minority groups.
Future courses may be insti
tuted if this attempt is success
ful. The History Department is
presently considering the estab
lishment of an African Studies
program, and the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council recommended an inter
departmental major in African
and Afro-American studies.
The Committee's recommenda
tion reads as follows: "The Exec
utive Committee of the Academ
ic Council recommends the fol
lowing motion:
"That the Council authorize
the establishment of an under
graduate major in African and
A fro-American studies with the
understanding that (1) the Dean
of Humanities and Sciences be
invited to appoint a committee
to be responsible for the pro
gram and (2) details of the pro
gram be subject to the approval
of the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education."
No action has been taken yet
on this proposal.
Courses in such a major, ac
cording to Holmes, would con
sist of some classes already in

existence, such as Modern Afri
ca since 1850, and Government
and Politics in Africa South of
the Sahara, as well as new ones,
such as African Civilizations and
cours< s in Swahili and Hausa.
The committee directing UG
170 is headed by Julius Mar

golis, professor of Engineering-
Economic Systems.
The course is also open to
middle- and upper-management
employees of the university. In
terested persons should contact
Boynton Kaiser in the person
nel office as soon as possible.

He feels such a course Is es
pecially important here because
"most of the kids come from
suburban America — especially
suburban California," and have
had no exposure to the problems
of minority groups.
Future courses may be insti
tuted if this attempt is success
ful. The History Department is
presently considering the estab
lishment of an African Studies
program, and the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council recommended an inter
departmental major in African
and Afro-American studies.
The Committee's recommenda
tion reads as follows: "The Exec
utive Committee of the Academ
ic Council recommends the fol
lowing motion:
"That the Council authorize
the establishment of an under
graduate major in African and
A fro-American studies with the
understanding that (1) the Dean
of Humanities and Sciences be
invited to appoint a committee
to be responsible for the pro
gram and (2) details of the pro
gram be subject to the approval
of the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education."
No action has been taken yet
on this proposal.
Courses in such a major, ac
cording to Holmes, would con
sist of some classes already in

existence, such as Modern Afri
ca since 1850, and Government
and Politics in Africa South of
the Sahara, as well as new ones,
such as African Civilizations and
cours< s in Swahili and Hausa.
The committee directing UG
170 is headed by Julius Mar

golis, professor of Engineering-
Economic Systems.
The course is also open to
middle- and upper-management
employees of the university. In
terested persons should contact
Boynton Kaiser in the person
nel office as soon as possible.
Four days after the assassina
tion of Martin Luther King last
April, members of Stanford's
Black Student Union (BSU)
took over the microphone from
Provost Richard Lyman during
an all-day colloquium on racism
and presented ten demands to
the University.
The demands dealt mainly
with admitting more minority
group students and hiring more
black faculty and staff. But as
an outgrowth of the controver
sy, curricular changes have also
been instituted.
The major innovation for this
year is a three-quarter course,
Undergraduate Special 170 A, B,
and C. Its title is "Racism and
Prejudice: An Interdisciplinary
Approach to the Problems of
Minority Groups and the Under
privileged in Contemporary So
ciety."
Twelve Professors
Twelve professors will partici
pate in the course, which was
originated and organized by two
History instructors, Oliver Wen
dell Holmes and Frank Foster.
More than 100 students pre
registered for the course last
spring, and there is room for
about 150 more. Lectures will be
held Tuesday and Thursday at
1:15 in Cubberley Auditorium.
There will also be 15 discus
sion sections led by 11 TAs. Fos

ter noted that all students must
register for one of the sections.
Sign-up lists will be available.
A list of TAs and topics will ap
pear in Monday's Daily.
St udonts who preregistered
for the course should sign up
for sections in room 2008, His
tory Corner, from 1 to 5 p.m.
Wednesday, September 25.
Many Departments Represented
Professors who will give lec
tures include Gavin I. Lang
muir, History; Frederick P.
Bowser, History; G. Wesley
Johnson, History; Charles Drek
meier, Political Science; James
Gibbs, Anthropology; Sanford
Dornbush, Sociology; J. Hyams,
History from San Francisco
State; Richard Fagen, Political
Science; Barton Bernstein, His
tory; Carl N. Degler, History;
Robert Coen, Economics; and
Michael Wald, Law.
The course can be taken for
three, four, or five units.
The second quarter of UG 170
will be similar to the first part.
In the spring, however, the
course will be a research-orient
ed seminar open only to a select
number of students and faculty
who will have taken either of
the first two courses.
Fie'd trips are also planned to
ghetto areas- East Palo Alto,
East San Jose, and possibly Oak
land—so the students "can re
late theory with practice, see

what's really happening,"
Holmes said.
The various sections will be
led by people from many differ
ent departments, but there will
bo no attempt to urge students
to register for the group headed
by someone in their own field,
Foster said.
"The whole point of the
course is to kind of open things
up a bit," he added.
How did the course come
about? After the BSU presented
its demands, Holmes explained,
"everyone began to entertain the
notion of giving courses on
black culture and history." The
problem was in finding qualified
professors.
Holmes and Foster got the
of drawing on the specific
knowledge of the professors al
ready here, establishing a course
to explore a wide range of ques
tions, such as: What does it
mean to live in a prejudiced so
ciety? What is the psychology
and sociology of prejudice?
The course will also consider
topics such as cultural margin
ality—the difficulty that some
groups, such as Cubans and
Puerto Ricans, have in adjust
ing to American society—and
"how the system perpetuates in
equitous conditions, poverty, and
how some groups are subjected
to it more than others due to
their cultural and educational
backgrounds," Holmes said.

will be similar to the first part.
In the spring, however, the
course will be a research-orient
ed seminar open only to a select
number of students and faculty
who will have taken either of
the first two courses.
Fie'd trips are also planned to
ghetto areas- East Palo Alto,
East San Jose, and possibly Oak
land—so the students "can re
late theory with practice, see

what's really happening,"
Holmes said.
The various sections will be
led by people from many differ
ent departments, but there will
bo no attempt to urge students
to register for the group headed
by someone in their own field,
Foster said.
"The whole point of the
course is to kind of open things
up a bit," he added.
How did the course come
about? After the BSU presented
its demands, Holmes explained,
"everyone began to entertain the
notion of giving courses on
black culture and history." The
problem was in finding qualified
professors.
Holmes and Foster got the
of drawing on the specific
knowledge of the professors al
ready here, establishing a course
to explore a wide range of ques
tions, such as: What does it
mean to live in a prejudiced so
ciety? What is the psychology
and sociology of prejudice?
The course will also consider
topics such as cultural margin
ality—the difficulty that some
groups, such as Cubans and
Puerto Ricans, have in adjust
ing to American society—and
"how the system perpetuates in
equitous conditions, poverty, and
how some groups are subjected
to it more than others due to
their cultural and educational
backgrounds," Holmes said.
Different Departments
He feels such a course Is es
pecially important here because
"most of the kids come from
suburban America — especially
suburban California," and have
had no exposure to the problems
of minority groups.
Future courses may be insti
tuted if this attempt is success
ful. The History Department is
presently considering the estab
lishment of an African Studies
program, and the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council recommended an inter
departmental major in African
and Afro-American studies.
The Committee's recommenda
tion reads as follows: "The Exec
utive Committee of the Academ
ic Council recommends the fol
lowing motion:
"That the Council authorize
the establishment of an under
graduate major in African and
A fro-American studies with the
understanding that (1) the Dean
of Humanities and Sciences be
invited to appoint a committee
to be responsible for the pro
gram and (2) details of the pro
gram be subject to the approval
of the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education."
No action has been taken yet
on this proposal.
Courses in such a major, ac
cording to Holmes, would con
sist of some classes already in

existence, such as Modern Afri
ca since 1850, and Government
and Politics in Africa South of
the Sahara, as well as new ones,
such as African Civilizations and
cours< s in Swahili and Hausa.
The committee directing UG
170 is headed by Julius Mar

golis, professor of Engineering-
Economic Systems.
The course is also open to
middle- and upper-management
employees of the university. In
terested persons should contact
Boynton Kaiser in the person
nel office as soon as possible.
Four days after the assassina
tion of Martin Luther King last
April, members of Stanford's
Black Student Union (BSU)
took over the microphone from
Provost Richard Lyman during
an all-day colloquium on racism
and presented ten demands to
the University.
The demands dealt mainly
with admitting more minority
group students and hiring more
black faculty and staff. But as
an outgrowth of the controver
sy, curricular changes have also
been instituted.
The major innovation for this
year is a three-quarter course,
Undergraduate Special 170 A, B,
and C. Its title is "Racism and
Prejudice: An Interdisciplinary
Approach to the Problems of
Minority Groups and the Under
privileged in Contemporary So
ciety."
Twelve Professors
Twelve professors will partici
pate in the course, which was
originated and organized by two
History instructors, Oliver Wen
dell Holmes and Frank Foster.
More than 100 students pre
registered for the course last
spring, and there is room for
about 150 more. Lectures will be
held Tuesday and Thursday at
1:15 in Cubberley Auditorium.
There will also be 15 discus
sion sections led by 11 TAs. Fos

ter noted that all students must
register for one of the sections.
Sign-up lists will be available.
A list of TAs and topics will ap
pear in Monday's Daily.
St udonts who preregistered
for the course should sign up
for sections in room 2008, His
tory Corner, from 1 to 5 p.m.
Wednesday, September 25.
