# Federal Aid Cutbacks Hit University Budget
## 
### 
Federal budgetary cutbacks
are beginning to affect Stan
ford.
"Moderately serious" cutbacks
in federal research funding will
hit Stanford projects funded by
the National Science Founda
tion, Office of Education, Atomic
Energy Commission, armed ser
vices, and other government
agencies.
According to Elwood Pierce in
the research administration of
fice "some of the agencies are
not making new awards and
some are cutting down grants."
No Trend Developed
No trend had developed yet
regarding what type of projects
were being abandoned, Pierce
said. Most agencies are review
ing each project's budget to cut
expenditures. Generally, con
struction in progress and fellow
ships for graduate students now
in school will be fully funded,
Pierce added.
Budget cuts may run from
five to 15 per cent, Pierce said.
In some cases the actual amount
of money may remain constant,
but its buying power will de
crease five to seven per cent.
Nt for finance Ken
neth Cuthbertson said he "had
not anticipated the kinds of cuts
occurring this year" although
long range university planning
a'lows for a levelling off of fed
eral aid hikes.
Deficit Projected
Consequently the cuts may
"aggravate the prob'em" of fi
nancing in the near future, but
will not alter the projected ten
year deficit Ci'thbertson said.
Expenditures at Stanford are
nrcdicted for ten years in ad
vanc° on two levels—minimum,
"To prevent erosion of quality of

the University," and desirable,
"to make improvements at well
managed significant rates."
The deficit in ten years is now
set at $4.5 million on the "mini
mum" level and $20 million on
the "desirable" plane.
Predictions have "a 1 w a y s
looked something like this,"
Cnthbertson said, "and usually
income has been greater than
we could foresee."
Although final statistics have
not been tallied, the '67-'6B
drives attracted "more donors
and apparently more donations
than any year in history," Cuth
bertson revealed.
Reaction to Protest
Most gifts were received prior
to late spring, so the affect of
reaction to student activism has
not vet boon felt. Cnthbertson
theorized that most donations
come "not because of but in
snite of student activism."
Cuthbertson cited concen
trated effort of more volunteers
as instrumental in increasing do
nations.
Cuthbertson said President
Pitzer will participate in mrtid
ing the character of funding
drives now b i ing p'nnn-'d for
th 1 next few years. They may
he "monolithic campaigns like
the PACE drive" or pirn at di
verse sources of income, he said.
Specific Needs
Volunteer groups aim d at
specific capital needs are "un

dor way and expanding," Cuth
bertson noted. Those center on
targets like the law school, med
ical school, chemistry and music
departments and renovation rnd
addition to the main library.
Special efforts are also being
focused on minority group pro
grams.
Cuthbertson said tuition will
not be raised beyond the already
projected levels '$2145 in '69-
701. "We have set tuition at
what we can afford to charge,"
he said, "and that hasn't
changed."
Must Keep Pace
Financial aids must "keep
pace" with Stanford's increased
cost, Cuthbertson noted. "We are
particularly sensitive that a cer
tain ,r roun gets caught, and we
will hand'e resulting financial
a'd problems," he said.
"We try desperat'dv to aid as
much as necessary all who are
admitted," Cuthbertson ex
plained, adding the goal was
"within a handf"l of freshmen"
of being reached.
Percentage Up
Ton years ago scholarships,
fellowships and loans comprised
per r nt of total tuition and
fees collected. Last fin in
cia' aids paid for 18 per cent.
The American Association of
University Professors at Stan
ford has suggested deficit spend
ing as a possible solution to the
finance problem.
