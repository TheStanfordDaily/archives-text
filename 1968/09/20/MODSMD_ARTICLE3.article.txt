# Hit Trustees
## Profs Score Governance 
### 
"We are dissatisfied with the
style or manner of administra
te n at Stanford." Thus begins
a report by a special committee
oj the Stanford chapter*of the
American Association of Univer
sity Professors (AAUP).
The 13-man committee has
prepared more than 50 recom
riendations in its "Proposed Al
terations in the Governance of
tjie University." The report pro
poses that faculty, students and
stall have "direct, formal mech
anisms" for communication with
the Board of Trustees.
The report does not recom
mend student or faculty mem
bership on the board, but it
does urge that board members
"be more representative ... of
the composition of contempo
rary American society."
The committee report, headed
by economics professor Melvin
Reder, is ihe product of a sum
mer's work. It was prompted
by both last spring's sit-in and
by numerous criticisms that
have been leveled at both the

board of trustees and other uni
versity officers.
In reference to any future sit
ins, the committee urged "a po
litical, not a 'military', solution
to student protest." The 13-man
group also proposed that police
not be called in just "to sup
press the protest itself."
They also urged that a graded
system of penalties for students
bo clearly established and pub
lished.
The 24-page report is quite
critical of certain aspects of the
Stanford administration, partic
ularly the board of trustees. It
decries a "tendency" for the
board to be isolated from the
University communty and nar
row in its representational base.
The AAUP report also says
that students, faculty and alum
ni should have representatives
on an advisory committee for
the selection of any future pres
idents. Some student leaders
have been critical of the lack
of student participation in the
selection of Prof. Pitzer to sue

ceed President Sterling.
The report also suggests that
students and faculty he consult
ed in the selection and reap
pointment of all Vice-Presidents,
Provosts, Vice-Provosts, Associ
ate Provosts and Deans of
Schools.
Opening some Academic Sen
ate meetings to all memhers of
the University community is
also proposed by the committee.
Currently, the meetings are
closed to students, some junior
faculty and much of the staff.
The ASSU president has been
working to obtain student mem
bership in the senate hut has
had little success.
In the financial realm of the
University, the committee pro
posed that the president or pro
vost yearly give a report ex
plaining the distribution of
funds in the budget. They also
recommended that the trustees
abandon their ba'anced budget
policy, at least on a short-term
basis. In making this recom
mendation, they said balancing

the budget every year acts as a
"shackle" on the University.
A procedure for initiatives by
s f udents or faculty is also fa
vored. This would force admin
istration officials to take action
on requests made by significant
numbers of students or faculty
(or staff).
At present time, membership
on the Academic Council (the
parent body of the senate) is re
stricted to full-time instructors
at or above the rank of assistant
professor. This excludes full
time lecturers, those who hold
"acting" posts as well as in
structors.
Concerning student participa
tion in tenure and promotion
the AAUP body does not
propose strdents voting on such
matters. They do, however, rec
ommend student opinions be so
licited.
They also urged that member
ship in the Committee of Fif
teen changed from the equal
representation of faculty, stu
