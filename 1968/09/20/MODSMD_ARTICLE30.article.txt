Studies of students, by stu
dents, and for students can be a
significant force for educational
reform on campus, a Stanford
psychologist suggests.
Prof. Ncvitt Sanford, editor
of "The American College" and
director of the Institute for the
Study of Human Problems, bases
this conclusion on studies con
ducted by students at the Gradu
ate Theological Union in Berke
ley.
"Colleges know far more about
students than students know
about colleges," he observes.
"We get information from stu
dents without their knowing the
implication of what they give us
and we feed it into a decision
making apparatus that usually
does not include students and
may or may not have their in
terest at heart. It would not be
surprising it before long we have
organized student protestsi
against attitude surveys in col- j
lege and — when this spreads to .
the high schools — protests
against ability tests of all kinds. !
"There are, of course, 'know- ;
nothing' complaints about tests
now, and it is well to remember
there are counter-revolutionary
elements in student activism."
"Research can release the ac
tivism latent in students. Just
as the individual student who is
interviewed in depth is almost
bound to begin shaping his ca
reer in accord with the insights
he gains, so a group of students
will begin thinking about chang- j
ing their educational environ-:
ment in the light of their shared
awareness of discrepancies be
tween the way things are and the j
way things might be; and in the j
climate of today the thought
easily becomes father to the ;
deed."
Students in San ford's class,
hope to develop an intensive in- '
terview program for their fac
ulty and for other graduate stu- j
dent groups. San lord's views
were reported earlier this month
at the American Psychological
Association meeting in San
Francisco.
