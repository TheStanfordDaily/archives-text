# Star-Crossed Indians?
## Injuries, Bonuses Haunt Tribe 
### GARY CAVALLI 
As far as Stanford sports buffs
are concerned, the summer of
1968 will not go down in history
as an Indian summer.
Tribe athletic hopes were
plagued by a rash of football
injuries, signing raids by pro
fessional baseball teams on
Coach Ray Young's pitching
staff, and grid star Nate Kirt
man's withdrawal from athlet
ics.
Kirtman was the fifth leading
rusher in the Pacific-8 last year
with 589 yards and a 4.6 yards
per-carry average. He sat out
the Indians' spring drills four
months ago, but at the time no
tified Coach John Ralston he
would play this fall. Then, on
August 29, Ralston announced
that Kirtman had dropped out.

No reason was given, but Kirt
man's past involvement in vol
untary teaching programs in
Palo Alto and other outside ac
tivities may have prompted his
decision to quit football.
Fortunately for Ralston, the
steadily improving Howie Wil
liams and Bubba Brown, an
All-American junior collpge
halfback from Ventura Col
lege, have both shown enough
potential to fill the gap left
by Kirtman.
Ralston has been plagued by
injuries since the first day of
practice, as evidenced by the fact
that he held 16 injured men out
of last Saturday's scrimmage.
Starting center Tom Oiallon
ardo may be lost for the year
due to a neck injury, while
starting safety Jim Kauffman is
out of tomorrow's San Jose
State game due to a pinched
nerve.
Defensive halfback Dick Oli
ver was knocked unconscious in
last week's drills, but will be
ready to go tomorrow. Halfback
Brown and fullbacks Greg
Broughton and John Huss have
been hampered by leg injuries
but will also see plenty of action
tomorrow.
Unfortunately the injuries
were not confined to the foot
ball field.
Starting split end Jim Cross
was seriously injured in an auto
mobile accident in July, break
ing his hip and injuring his
neck and back. Cross, who had
been in a wheelchair since the
incident, hobbed onto the prac
tice field Monday afternoon and
announced hio intention to play.
Right now no one can estimate
when he'll be ready for combat.
The New York Mets and the
Los Angeles Dodgers lured
away two of Stanford's top
pitchers —Don Rose and San
dy Vance — with attractive
bonuses.
Rose was selected by the Mots
and Vance by the Dodgers in the
major leagues' free agent draft.
Both men signed within a few
days of the draft. While Rose
was hampered by a sore arm,
Vance reported to the Dodgers'
farm team at Spokane and won
a job in the starting rotation.
The departure of Vance and
Rose leaves coach Ray Young
with only one returning starter
from 'ast year's mound staff —
Rod Pote?te.


SOPH SURPRISE—Speedy Jack
Lasater (43) arrived on the scene
just in time to take over the
starting split end spot vacated
by Cross.


SIDELINED SENIOR — Spilt end Jim Cross (80), shown here snar
ing a Jim Plunkett aerial during spring practice, was injured seri
ously in an automobile accident in mid-July. Despite spending near
ly two months in a wheelchair with a broken hip, Cross appeared
at practice Monday afternoon to begin working out. He intends to
get back into the lineup by mid-season.

No reason was given, but Kirt
man's past involvement in vol
untary teaching programs in
Palo Alto and other outside ac
tivities may have prompted his
decision to quit football.
Fortunately for Ralston, the
steadily improving Howie Wil
liams and Bubba Brown, an
All-American junior collpge
halfback from Ventura Col
lege, have both shown enough
potential to fill the gap left
by Kirtman.
Ralston has been plagued by
injuries since the first day of
practice, as evidenced by the fact
that he held 16 injured men out
of last Saturday's scrimmage.
Starting center Tom Oiallon
ardo may be lost for the year
due to a neck injury, while
starting safety Jim Kauffman is
out of tomorrow's San Jose
State game due to a pinched
nerve.
Defensive halfback Dick Oli
ver was knocked unconscious in
last week's drills, but will be
ready to go tomorrow. Halfback
Brown and fullbacks Greg
Broughton and John Huss have
been hampered by leg injuries
but will also see plenty of action
tomorrow.
Unfortunately the injuries
were not confined to the foot
ball field.
Starting split end Jim Cross
was seriously injured in an auto
mobile accident in July, break
ing his hip and injuring his
neck and back. Cross, who had
been in a wheelchair since the
incident, hobbed onto the prac
tice field Monday afternoon and
announced hio intention to play.
Right now no one can estimate
when he'll be ready for combat.
The New York Mets and the
Los Angeles Dodgers lured
away two of Stanford's top
pitchers —Don Rose and San
dy Vance — with attractive
bonuses.
Rose was selected by the Mots
and Vance by the Dodgers in the
major leagues' free agent draft.
Both men signed within a few
days of the draft. While Rose
was hampered by a sore arm,
Vance reported to the Dodgers'
farm team at Spokane and won
a job in the starting rotation.
The departure of Vance and
Rose leaves coach Ray Young
with only one returning starter
from 'ast year's mound staff —
Rod Pote?te.


SOPH SURPRISE—Speedy Jack
Lasater (43) arrived on the scene
just in time to take over the
starting split end spot vacated
by Cross.


SIDELINED SENIOR — Spilt end Jim Cross (80), shown here snar
ing a Jim Plunkett aerial during spring practice, was injured seri
ously in an automobile accident in mid-July. Despite spending near
ly two months in a wheelchair with a broken hip, Cross appeared
at practice Monday afternoon to begin working out. He intends to
get back into the lineup by mid-season.
As far as Stanford sports buffs
are concerned, the summer of
1968 will not go down in history
as an Indian summer.
Tribe athletic hopes were
plagued by a rash of football
injuries, signing raids by pro
fessional baseball teams on
Coach Ray Young's pitching
staff, and grid star Nate Kirt
man's withdrawal from athlet
ics.
Kirtman was the fifth leading
rusher in the Pacific-8 last year
with 589 yards and a 4.6 yards
per-carry average. He sat out
the Indians' spring drills four
months ago, but at the time no
tified Coach John Ralston he
would play this fall. Then, on
August 29, Ralston announced
that Kirtman had dropped out.
