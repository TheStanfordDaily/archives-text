# Indians Host SJS
## Plunkett Faces First Test 
### GARY CAVALLI 
At 1:35 tomorrow afternoon
the curtain may rise on the Jim
Plunkett era in Stanford football
history.
Plunkett, as anyone who
hasn't been cave-exploring for
the past six months knows, will
be the Tribe's starting quarter
back for the 1968 grid campaign.
A sophomore (eligibility-wise)
who red-shirted last year, Plun
kett will get his first taste of
varsity competition tomorrow
when the Indians host San Jose
State in the season opener.
A 6-3, 203 pounder, Plunkett
brings with him a style of
quarterbacking which Stan
ford football fans haven't
seen in years —the pro-style,
drop-back passing attack. Ral
ston calls him "the best throw

er we've had since I've been
here."
Up until now Ralston, in his
sixth year at Stanford, never
had what he terms "a pure pass
er," a quarterback with both
size and passing ability. This
will be the first time the Tribe
mentor will be able to abandon
the roll-out offense in favor of
a pro-style attack.
Plunkott will have an excel
lent battery of receivers to
throw to, including the leading
Pacific-8 roceiver in 1967, flank
er Gene Washington. Sophmore
Bob Moore has won the starting
nod at tight end, backed by Ron
Kadziel, while surprising Jack
Lasator will open at split end.
Nate Kirtman's gone, hav
ing quit football in late Aug
ust, but Stanford should have
a solid running game to com
plement Plunkett's passing.

Bubba Brown, a transfer from
Ventura Junior College, and
junior veteran Howie Williams
are currently battling for the
starting running back berth.
Ralston indicated he may not
make his decision until just be
fore game time.
Brown, who earned Ail-Amer
ican honors at Ventura, may be
the breakaway threat Stanford
has been looking for. Despite
being hampered by a pulled
thigh muscle, he has looked best
to Ralston in "game situations
and intra-squad scrimmages."
The fullback crew may be de
scribed as the walking wounded.
Greg Broughton won the start
ing job and should be ready to
go tomorrow, although an in
jured ankle may keep him on
the sidelines part of the time.
Backup man Jon Huss has an
injured knee, while third-string
fullback Tim Abena will be
nursing a shoulder injury.
With the exception of soph
more John Sande at center,
starting in place of injured
Tom Giallonardo, the Indians
have an experienced offensive
line. Ail-American candidate
Mai Snider and junior Pete
Seymour are the tackles, while
senior George Crooks and
junior Bob Reinhard will open
at the guards.
Defensively Ralston has size
and experience on the line, plus
speed and agility in the line
backing and secondary spots.
Five seniors man the defensive
line—ends Tom Weingartner and
co-captain Stu Kellner, tackles
Bill Nicholson and Bob Bittner,
and middle guard standout
George Buehler.
Ralston has been very im
pressed with his trio of line
backers — junior Don Parish,
senior Bill Shoemaker, and jun
ior Pat Preston. Parish and
Shoemaker have both been out
standing in pre-season practice,
while Preston proved a pleasant
surprise in beating out senior
Andy Carrigan.
Ex-quarterback Mark Mar
quess has been switched to safe
ty, where he will start in place
of sophmore Jim Kauffman, who
will see only limited action due
to a pinched nerve.
Fleet senior Tom Massey will
start at left defensive halfback,
while junior standout Dick Oli
ver return on the right side.
Veteran Bob Rinker will be
available for service at all three
secondary spots.
The Tribe defenders will
have to contain a wide-open
San Jose State offense, fea
turing the"I" formation
which propelled USC's O. J.
Simpson to stardom last year.
Spartan tailback Walt Shock

ley, who at a press luncheon
Wednesday unabashedly de
clared himself the best back on
the coast, will be the major
problem for the Tribe defense
tomorrow. A 6-0, 195 pound
speedster from Los Angeles,
Shockley broke loose for long
touchdown jaunts in every Spar
tan scrimmage this fall.
The rest of the Spartan back
field—quarterback Russ Mun
son, flanker Willie Riley, and
fullback Neil Powers — gives
coach Harry Anderson a strong
running game, but passing will
be another matter.
An inexperienced offensive
line and injuries to two regu
lar receivers may cripple the
Spartan aerial attack. Munson
himself is known more for his
scrambling and bailhandling
abilities than for his passing
prowess.
Defensively the visitors will be
plagued by inexperience on the
line, but the secondary could be
outstanding. A 1 Saunders, one of
the top defensive backs on the
coast, teams with Shockley, Dan
ny Anderson, and Terry Hostek
to give the Spartans a very
strong unit. Mike Scrivner, who
normally would start in Hos
tek's place (and also in place of
Riley at flanker on offense) will
probably not see action due to
a knee injury.
With the Spartans boasting a
tight secondary and the Indians
putting new emphasis on the
passing game, tomorrow's en
counter should be a case of
strength against strength. Tribe
quarterback Plunkett will get
his first real test and with it his
change to usher in the Jim
Plunkett era in Stanford football
history.


KEY MAN — All eyes will be on quarterback Jim Plunkett (16) tomorrow when Stanford's Indians
launch the '68 gTid campaign against San Jose State. An estimated 30,000 fans will be on hand as

ust, but Stanford should have
a solid running game to com
plement Plunkett's passing.

Bubba Brown, a transfer from
Ventura Junior College, and
junior veteran Howie Williams
are currently battling for the
starting running back berth.
Ralston indicated he may not
make his decision until just be
fore game time.
Brown, who earned Ail-Amer
ican honors at Ventura, may be
the breakaway threat Stanford
has been looking for. Despite
being hampered by a pulled
thigh muscle, he has looked best
to Ralston in "game situations
and intra-squad scrimmages."
The fullback crew may be de
scribed as the walking wounded.
Greg Broughton won the start
ing job and should be ready to
go tomorrow, although an in
jured ankle may keep him on
the sidelines part of the time.
Backup man Jon Huss has an
injured knee, while third-string
fullback Tim Abena will be
nursing a shoulder injury.
With the exception of soph
more John Sande at center,
starting in place of injured
Tom Giallonardo, the Indians
have an experienced offensive
line. Ail-American candidate
Mai Snider and junior Pete
Seymour are the tackles, while
senior George Crooks and
junior Bob Reinhard will open
at the guards.
Defensively Ralston has size
and experience on the line, plus
speed and agility in the line
backing and secondary spots.
Five seniors man the defensive
line—ends Tom Weingartner and
co-captain Stu Kellner, tackles
Bill Nicholson and Bob Bittner,
and middle guard standout
George Buehler.
Ralston has been very im
pressed with his trio of line
backers — junior Don Parish,
senior Bill Shoemaker, and jun
ior Pat Preston. Parish and
Shoemaker have both been out
standing in pre-season practice,
while Preston proved a pleasant
surprise in beating out senior
Andy Carrigan.
Ex-quarterback Mark Mar
quess has been switched to safe
ty, where he will start in place
of sophmore Jim Kauffman, who
will see only limited action due
to a pinched nerve.
Fleet senior Tom Massey will
start at left defensive halfback,
while junior standout Dick Oli
ver return on the right side.
Veteran Bob Rinker will be
available for service at all three
secondary spots.
The Tribe defenders will
have to contain a wide-open
San Jose State offense, fea
turing the"I" formation
which propelled USC's O. J.
Simpson to stardom last year.
Spartan tailback Walt Shock

ley, who at a press luncheon
Wednesday unabashedly de
clared himself the best back on
the coast, will be the major
problem for the Tribe defense
tomorrow. A 6-0, 195 pound
speedster from Los Angeles,
Shockley broke loose for long
touchdown jaunts in every Spar
tan scrimmage this fall.
The rest of the Spartan back
field—quarterback Russ Mun
son, flanker Willie Riley, and
fullback Neil Powers — gives
coach Harry Anderson a strong
running game, but passing will
be another matter.
An inexperienced offensive
line and injuries to two regu
lar receivers may cripple the
Spartan aerial attack. Munson
himself is known more for his
scrambling and bailhandling
abilities than for his passing
prowess.
Defensively the visitors will be
plagued by inexperience on the
line, but the secondary could be
outstanding. A 1 Saunders, one of
the top defensive backs on the
coast, teams with Shockley, Dan
ny Anderson, and Terry Hostek
to give the Spartans a very
strong unit. Mike Scrivner, who
normally would start in Hos
tek's place (and also in place of
Riley at flanker on offense) will
probably not see action due to
a knee injury.
With the Spartans boasting a
tight secondary and the Indians
putting new emphasis on the
passing game, tomorrow's en
counter should be a case of
strength against strength. Tribe
quarterback Plunkett will get
his first real test and with it his
change to usher in the Jim
Plunkett era in Stanford football
history.


KEY MAN — All eyes will be on quarterback Jim Plunkett (16) tomorrow when Stanford's Indians
launch the '68 gTid campaign against San Jose State. An estimated 30,000 fans will be on hand as
Plunkett initiates his varsity career at Stanford Stadium. Plunkett, a tall, strong-armed passer, will
be the Tribe's first drop-back quarterback in several years.
At 1:35 tomorrow afternoon
the curtain may rise on the Jim
Plunkett era in Stanford football
history.
Plunkett, as anyone who
hasn't been cave-exploring for
the past six months knows, will
be the Tribe's starting quarter
back for the 1968 grid campaign.
A sophomore (eligibility-wise)
who red-shirted last year, Plun
kett will get his first taste of
varsity competition tomorrow
when the Indians host San Jose
State in the season opener.
A 6-3, 203 pounder, Plunkett
brings with him a style of
quarterbacking which Stan
ford football fans haven't
seen in years —the pro-style,
drop-back passing attack. Ral
ston calls him "the best throw

er we've had since I've been
here."
Up until now Ralston, in his
sixth year at Stanford, never
had what he terms "a pure pass
er," a quarterback with both
size and passing ability. This
will be the first time the Tribe
mentor will be able to abandon
the roll-out offense in favor of
a pro-style attack.
Plunkott will have an excel
lent battery of receivers to
throw to, including the leading
Pacific-8 roceiver in 1967, flank
er Gene Washington. Sophmore
Bob Moore has won the starting
nod at tight end, backed by Ron
Kadziel, while surprising Jack
Lasator will open at split end.

Ralston has been very im
pressed with his trio of line
backers — junior Don Parish,
senior Bill Shoemaker, and jun
ior Pat Preston. Parish and
Shoemaker have both been out
standing in pre-season practice,
while Preston proved a pleasant
surprise in beating out senior
Andy Carrigan.
Ex-quarterback Mark Mar
quess has been switched to safe
ty, where he will start in place
of sophmore Jim Kauffman, who
will see only limited action due
to a pinched nerve.
Fleet senior Tom Massey will
start at left defensive halfback,
while junior standout Dick Oli
ver return on the right side.
Veteran Bob Rinker will be
available for service at all three
secondary spots.
The Tribe defenders will
have to contain a wide-open
San Jose State offense, fea
turing the"I" formation
which propelled USC's O. J.
Simpson to stardom last year.
Spartan tailback Walt Shock

ley, who at a press luncheon
Wednesday unabashedly de
clared himself the best back on
the coast, will be the major
problem for the Tribe defense
tomorrow. A 6-0, 195 pound
speedster from Los Angeles,
Shockley broke loose for long
touchdown jaunts in every Spar
tan scrimmage this fall.
The rest of the Spartan back
field—quarterback Russ Mun
son, flanker Willie Riley, and
fullback Neil Powers — gives
coach Harry Anderson a strong
running game, but passing will
be another matter.
An inexperienced offensive
line and injuries to two regu
lar receivers may cripple the
Spartan aerial attack. Munson
himself is known more for his
scrambling and bailhandling
abilities than for his passing
prowess.
Defensively the visitors will be
plagued by inexperience on the
line, but the secondary could be
outstanding. A 1 Saunders, one of
the top defensive backs on the
coast, teams with Shockley, Dan
ny Anderson, and Terry Hostek
to give the Spartans a very
strong unit. Mike Scrivner, who
normally would start in Hos
tek's place (and also in place of
Riley at flanker on offense) will
probably not see action due to
a knee injury.
With the Spartans boasting a
tight secondary and the Indians
putting new emphasis on the
passing game, tomorrow's en
counter should be a case of
strength against strength. Tribe
quarterback Plunkett will get
his first real test and with it his
change to usher in the Jim
Plunkett era in Stanford football
history.


KEY MAN — All eyes will be on quarterback Jim Plunkett (16) tomorrow when Stanford's Indians
launch the '68 gTid campaign against San Jose State. An estimated 30,000 fans will be on hand as
Plunkett initiates his varsity career at Stanford Stadium. Plunkett, a tall, strong-armed passer, will
be the Tribe's first drop-back quarterback in several years.
At 1:35 tomorrow afternoon
the curtain may rise on the Jim
Plunkett era in Stanford football
history.
Plunkett, as anyone who
hasn't been cave-exploring for
the past six months knows, will
be the Tribe's starting quarter
back for the 1968 grid campaign.
A sophomore (eligibility-wise)
who red-shirted last year, Plun
kett will get his first taste of
varsity competition tomorrow
when the Indians host San Jose
State in the season opener.
A 6-3, 203 pounder, Plunkett
brings with him a style of
quarterbacking which Stan
ford football fans haven't
seen in years —the pro-style,
drop-back passing attack. Ral
ston calls him "the best throw

er we've had since I've been
here."
Up until now Ralston, in his
sixth year at Stanford, never
had what he terms "a pure pass
er," a quarterback with both
size and passing ability. This
will be the first time the Tribe
mentor will be able to abandon
the roll-out offense in favor of
a pro-style attack.
Plunkott will have an excel
lent battery of receivers to
throw to, including the leading
Pacific-8 roceiver in 1967, flank
er Gene Washington. Sophmore
Bob Moore has won the starting
nod at tight end, backed by Ron
Kadziel, while surprising Jack
Lasator will open at split end.
Nate Kirtman's gone, hav
ing quit football in late Aug
ust, but Stanford should have
a solid running game to com
plement Plunkett's passing.

Bubba Brown, a transfer from
Ventura Junior College, and
junior veteran Howie Williams
are currently battling for the
starting running back berth.
Ralston indicated he may not
make his decision until just be
fore game time.
Brown, who earned Ail-Amer
ican honors at Ventura, may be
the breakaway threat Stanford
has been looking for. Despite
being hampered by a pulled
thigh muscle, he has looked best
to Ralston in "game situations
and intra-squad scrimmages."
The fullback crew may be de
scribed as the walking wounded.
Greg Broughton won the start
ing job and should be ready to
go tomorrow, although an in
jured ankle may keep him on
the sidelines part of the time.
Backup man Jon Huss has an
injured knee, while third-string
fullback Tim Abena will be
nursing a shoulder injury.
With the exception of soph
more John Sande at center,
starting in place of injured
Tom Giallonardo, the Indians
have an experienced offensive
line. Ail-American candidate
Mai Snider and junior Pete
Seymour are the tackles, while
senior George Crooks and
junior Bob Reinhard will open
at the guards.
Defensively Ralston has size
and experience on the line, plus
speed and agility in the line
backing and secondary spots.
Five seniors man the defensive
line—ends Tom Weingartner and
co-captain Stu Kellner, tackles
Bill Nicholson and Bob Bittner,
and middle guard standout
George Buehler.

pressed with his trio of line
