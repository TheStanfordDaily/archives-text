## 1968: A Grid Odyssey 
### Gary Cavalli 
1968 may well be remembered as the year the Athletic Associa
tion of Western Universities finally decided to go along with th' 1
mass media and change its name to the Pacific-8 Conference.
Then again, 1968 may be remembered as the "year of the
in Pac-8 football. With no less than six very strong teams fighting
for the coast crown, upsets should be as plentiful as armed pohco
men on a Chicago street corner. While it must be conceded that
USC and Oregon State have the post positions in the run for the
roses, UCLA, Stanford, Cal and Washington all have an outside
shot at the winner's circle.
On this the eve of the T>B Pac-8 grid campaign it's time once
again to unveil our own prognostications as t« how things will
turn out. It's not entirely without hope that we engage in such a
hazardous pasttime. Faithful readers of this column (if there are
any) will no doubt recall that back on April 11 we tabbed the
Detroit Tigers for the American League pennant.
1. USC The Trojans, of course, have O. J. Simpson, and that
puts the USC backfield in a class by itself. Despite losing several
men to graduation, including five first round professional draft
picks, Coach John McKay still figures to field the best team on the
coast— and perhaps the nation. McKay has two good quarterbacks
(Steve Sogge and Mike Holmgren*, plenty of speed, and a tough
defense.
2. Oregon State—Dee Andros ("the Great Pumpkin") welcomes
back 36 lettermen, several of whom form the nucleus of a tena
cious defense. If Steve Preece can provide enough of a passing at
tack to complement an outstanding running game, the Beavers
could win it all.
3. Stanford —John Ralston has a fast, exciting team that com
bines experience (31 returning lettermen) with youth (four
sophomore starters). The defense is very strong, and if the Jim
Plunkett-led offense jells, Ralston may have a winner.
4. UCLA —Gary Beban's gone, and young Bill Bolden may find
his shoes too big to fill. The Bruins have a solid kicking and run
ning game, but their inexperienced forward wall may crumble.
5. California—The Bears deserve a better fate than a fifth-place
finish. If quarterback Randy Humphreys can match his late-season
form of 1967 and Bob Darby provides the needed speed, Ray Will
sey's bunch could surprise a lot of people.
6. Washington—The Huskies will have a new Astroturf grid
iron this year, and it may prove an asset against teams unfa
miliar with the synthetic grass. Coach Jim Owens has the de
fense and the ground game, but passing remains a question
mark.
7. Oregon—The experience provided by 33 returnees should
enable Oregon to escape the Pac-8 cellar. Coach Gerry Frei has
an establish running game and a strong offensive line, but that is
where the optimism ends.
8. Washington State—New head coach Jim Sweeney inherits a
less-than-promising situation at WSU. Among his many problems
will be to find a quarterback.

could win it all.
3. Stanford —John Ralston has a fast, exciting team that com
bines experience (31 returning lettermen) with youth (four
sophomore starters). The defense is very strong, and if the Jim
Plunkett-led offense jells, Ralston may have a winner.
4. UCLA —Gary Beban's gone, and young Bill Bolden may find
his shoes too big to fill. The Bruins have a solid kicking and run
ning game, but their inexperienced forward wall may crumble.
5. California—The Bears deserve a better fate than a fifth-place
finish. If quarterback Randy Humphreys can match his late-season
form of 1967 and Bob Darby provides the needed speed, Ray Will
sey's bunch could surprise a lot of people.
6. Washington—The Huskies will have a new Astroturf grid
iron this year, and it may prove an asset against teams unfa
miliar with the synthetic grass. Coach Jim Owens has the de
fense and the ground game, but passing remains a question
mark.
7. Oregon—The experience provided by 33 returnees should
enable Oregon to escape the Pac-8 cellar. Coach Gerry Frei has
an establish running game and a strong offensive line, but that is
where the optimism ends.
8. Washington State—New head coach Jim Sweeney inherits a
less-than-promising situation at WSU. Among his many problems
will be to find a quarterback.
1968 may well be remembered as the year the Athletic Associa
tion of Western Universities finally decided to go along with th' 1
mass media and change its name to the Pacific-8 Conference.
Then again, 1968 may be remembered as the "year of the
in Pac-8 football. With no less than six very strong teams fighting
for the coast crown, upsets should be as plentiful as armed pohco
men on a Chicago street corner. While it must be conceded that
USC and Oregon State have the post positions in the run for the
roses, UCLA, Stanford, Cal and Washington all have an outside
shot at the winner's circle.
On this the eve of the T>B Pac-8 grid campaign it's time once
again to unveil our own prognostications as t« how things will
turn out. It's not entirely without hope that we engage in such a
hazardous pasttime. Faithful readers of this column (if there are
any) will no doubt recall that back on April 11 we tabbed the
Detroit Tigers for the American League pennant.
1. USC The Trojans, of course, have O. J. Simpson, and that
puts the USC backfield in a class by itself. Despite losing several
men to graduation, including five first round professional draft
picks, Coach John McKay still figures to field the best team on the
coast— and perhaps the nation. McKay has two good quarterbacks
(Steve Sogge and Mike Holmgren*, plenty of speed, and a tough
defense.
2. Oregon State—Dee Andros ("the Great Pumpkin") welcomes
back 36 lettermen, several of whom form the nucleus of a tena
cious defense. If Steve Preece can provide enough of a passing at
tack to complement an outstanding running game, the Beavers
could win it all.
