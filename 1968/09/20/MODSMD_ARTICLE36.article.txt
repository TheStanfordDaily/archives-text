# Almost Complete
## New Judicial Council 
### 
Six of the seven members of
the Temporary Judicial Council
have been named. The judicial
body will handle disciplinary
cases until a new student judi
cial system is ratified by all fac
tions of the Stanford community.
Both the administration and
faculty have given their approval
to a plan put forth by the Com
mittee of Fifteen last May. A
student referendum will prob
ably be held on the proposed
system this fall.
In related developments, act
ing President Robert Glaser and
other University officials last
week consulted with students
and faculty on development of
new policy guidelines to help
maintain the rights of free
speech, peaceable assembly, and
freedom of movement on cam
pus.
In general, the guidelines
would make it a violation of uni
versity policy for a member of
the faculty, staff or student body
to prevent normal university
functions or obstruct the legiti
mate movement of individuals
on campus.

If such disruption occurs, the
proposed policy would require
individuals to identify them
selves and to leave university
buildings when asked to do so
by a member of the university
community, acting in his official
role and identifying himself as
such.
A proposed draft was distri
buted to members of the Aca
demic Senate at their first offi
cial meeting Sept. 12, after Dr.
Glaser requested their "advice
and counsel." After informally
suggesting a number of changes
in wording, the Senate approved
the guidelines in principle as
"appropriate for all members of
the university community." The
action was taken by voice vote,
carrying by a substantial ma
jority.
Still subject to revision in
wording, the policy has not been
promulgated by the president. It
was discussed for two hours last
week at an informal session at
tended by Dr. Glaser, President-
Designate Kenneth S. Pitzer, and
student, faculty and administra
tors.

"This is a matter of urgency
in which all members of the
Stanford community have a
great stake," Dr. Glaser declared.
The university needs "thought
ful, considered ways to seek
progress together . . . and avoid
the kind of confrontation that
could destroy higher education."
The Senate's voice vote was
the first expression of opinion on
campus disruption by a repre
sentative body of the faculty
since May 8, when the Academic
Council voted 284-245 to recom
mend that the proposed suspen
sion of seven student demon
strators against the CIA last
November be set aside and that
no students be penalized as a
consequence of the sit-in at the
Old Student Union May 6-8.
Following the sit-in, a student
referendum condemned sit-ins as
"unacceptable behavior at Stan
ford," 3.924 to 1,695. On May 16
the Board of Trustees requested
students, faculty, and admini
strators to continue "with the
greatest sense of urgency" their
efforts to eliminate sit-ins and
other disruptive activities "which
strike at the very heart of the
University."
The proposed statement em
bodies the same preamble as the
1964 university policy statement
on campus demonstrations, eli
minating some of its more de
tailed provisions and adding sec
tions on personal identification
and building clearance.
The members of the Tempor
ary Judicial Council nominated
by the Academic Senate Commit
tee on Committees and appointed
by the president include Profs.
P. Herbert Leiderman, psychia
try; Walter E. Meyerhof, phy
sics; and Robert T. Sprouse,
physics.
Three students were appointed
by a selection committee com
posed of four students and two
faculty members, following in
terviews with 16 applicants.
Those chosen were: Timothy B.
Coburn, graduate student in gen
etics ; Dennis Hawley, a Business
School student; and Peter F.
Schilla, of the School of Law.
The chairman -will -be -ap
pointed by Dr. Glaser after con
sultation with these six students
and faculty members.
