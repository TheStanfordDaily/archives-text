University health officer Hal
W. Wilson recently discouraged
widespread influenza vaccina
tion.
Selective immunization for
"clinically ill persons and older
age groups" was valuable, Wil
son said. Patients with rheumat
ic heart disease, cardiovascular
disorders, and chronic broncho
pulmonary diseases (asthma,
bronchitis, etc.) were also rec
ommended for vaccination.
"The best available preven
tives of influenza are the inacti
vated vaccines. . . . They have
often been marginally effective,
offering rather brief periods of
protection. They produce local
and systemic reactions with rela
tively high frequency," Wilson
said.
Since the shots must be given
two months apart, Wilson rec
ommends starting the series as
soon after Sept. 15 as possible.
