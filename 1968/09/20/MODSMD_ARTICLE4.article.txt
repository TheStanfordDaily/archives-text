Amid half-unpacked suitcases and stacks of
pre-reg information, somewhat bewildered fresh
men surrendered to inquisitive Daily staffers.
Here they tell why they came to Stanford, wheth
er they thought it too conservative or liberal last
year, why they chose their residence.
PAT WONG, Roble: "I applied to Berkeley and
here. I like activities and as far as I know there
are more here. I chose a coed dorm because I felt
it would widen everyone's experiences."
MARGARET KAPLAN, Roble: "I liked Stan
ford the best because I knew it was an excellent
school. It's a good size and the overseas campus
es appeal to me. The ratio was nice, too. I can
understand some of the student activism, but I
don't know if I want to take part — it can be
overdone."
STEVE SCOTT, Roble: "I wanted to come to
California to school, and since Stanford is a tough
school to get in, I figured it must be good academ
ically. Right now it seems large and real pretty.
The sit-in last May had no bearing on my choice."
CAROL TOMLINSON, Roble: "I've always
wanted to go here. I like the wide selection of
viewpoints here. I'm not wary of the liberalism —
I'm really looking forward to the year, but right
now I'm a little bit scared."
SCOTT FEICHTINGER, Branner: "I chose
Stanford over Cornell because Cornell was too
large and I like this location and atmosphere -•
it's more casual here. The sit-in had no affect on
me."
ALLEN SIBLEY, Branner: "I chose Stanford
over UCLA because I wanted to get away from
home."

JIM GRAY, Branner: "My father wanted no
to go here, and the school has a lot of presiig \
I ured to think it was a pretty conservative school
because so many rich people go here, but if
they're burning down buildings, they're not too
conservative."
DAMON GRAY, Branner: "I chose Stanford
because I got the best financial deal here. I want
it more liberally."
SUSAN TAYLOR, Florence Moore: "I like
Stanford's location and I think it offered me
more of an opportunity. You can't close your
mind to liberalism you have to look all around
at life. I chose an all girl dorm because I think
'here will be enough distractions without living
with guys."
ALLYN PRICE, Flo Mo: "In eighth gride I took
some sort of an interest tr>st, and my mother said
'why don't you go to Stanford?' " Her parents said
th y liked Stanford's reputation and location, and
added, "you find activism on any campus."
BARB THOMPSON, Flo Mo: "I wanted to come
to California. I think Stanford's image is a good
academic school. About the sit-in —is that the
one no one was for?"
DICK BUTLER, Soto House, Wilbur: "It's a
cool place. I'm from the east and I wanted to
come here for the weather, the language pro
grams and overseas campuses, and to get out of
that Northeastern bag which I was very much
in. As far as student activism, I'm closer to radi
cal myself, so it's cool with me."
JENNIE MATTHEWS, Soto: "I had never been
to California, but I thought I would get a more
liberal education and meet more liberal people
here "
