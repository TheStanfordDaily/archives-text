The Stanford Daily begins its
76th consecutive year of publica
tion today as an editorially inde
pendent newspaper, owned and
operated by students.
Founded in 1892 as The Daily
Palo Alto, the Daily has grown
to be one of the largest univer
sity newspapers in the nation,
with a circulation of 12,000.
Copies are distributed free to
members of the Stanford com
munity, Monday through Friday.
Last May a new Daily Publish
ing Board was organized under
the Associated Students to guide
the newspaper's continuing
growth. The Board has five stu
dent and two faculty members.
The Daily's editorial and busi
ness staff is open to all Stanford
students. New students interest
ed in writing, reporting, photog
raphy or secretarial work are
invited to a meeting tomorrow
at 11 a.m. in the Daily office on
Lomita Drive. No experience is
necessary for new staff. A train
ing program is planned.
Students interested in selling
advertising for the Daily, on a
commission basis, should see Len
Costello at the Daily Monday
through Friday at 2 p.m.
