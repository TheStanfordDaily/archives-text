# All-faculty Body
## Senate Starts Work 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Despite original indications, it
now appears that the newly in
stituted Academic Senate will
have no student members, al
though students are now eligible
to serve on all Academic Council
committees as voting members.
The Senate approved student
committee membership at its
first official meeting, September
12.

The Academic Council, con
sisting of all faculty members of
assistant professor rank or high
er, established the Senate last
year because the Council had be
come too large to operate effi
ciently.
Growth In Faculty
In a report explaining the
change, the Academic Council
Executive Committee said, "Dur
ing the past two decades, the

Academic Council has increased
more than threefold, from 306
to 940 members.
"As a decision making body
and a forum for debate on com
plicated academic matters, the
present Academic Council is
handicapped both by size and by
the fragmented interested of its
membership," the report said.
It originally appeared that
students would be allowed on the
Senate, and the only reason they
were not included in the set-up
was a misunderstanding be
tween the Academic Council and
the Associated Students.
"Misunderstanding"
A plan to have five students
as ex-officio members of the Sen
ate "came up really late in
game," according to H. Donald
Winbigler, academic secretary to
the University.
"At the time the Executive
Committee (of the Academic
Council) last considered the
idea" before approving the Sen
ate Plan, "thev had the impres
sion the ASSU leadership had
rejected the idea," Winbigler
said.
A resolution was passed ask
ing the Executive Committee to
study the matter, but it now ap
pears the idea has b?en rejected.
The Senate action approving
student membership on Coun
cil committees came alter a rec
ommendation by the Senate's
Committee on Committees,
which specifies the duties and
selects members for committees.
Committees To Be Active
"This reflects our belief that
much of the ongoing work of the
Academic Council will be done
in committees and that this is
the level at which student par
ticipation, contribution, and ac
ceptance of responsibility is es
pecially important," the commit

tee recommendation noted.
Also approved was a recom
mendation that students serving
on Council committees should be
invited to attend Senate meet
ings when the committee's re
ports are discusscd.
At present, the method of se
lecting the students has not been
decided. The question has been
referred back to the Committee
on Committees for further con
sideration, according to Prof.
William Clebsch, acting Senate
chairman during the absence of
Leonard Schiff, permanent chair
man.
Dissent By Students
In a related move, the Senate
recommended that student com
mitter members who disagree
with with committee recom
mendations should have the
right to circulate written state
ments outlining the reasons for
their dissent and to discuss these
statements on the floor of the
Senate.
Senate meetings normally are
open only to members of the
Academic Council. According to
Clebsch, this is a liberalization of
previous policy, since "The Sen
ate is a substitute for the old
Executive Committee."
Meetings of the Council's Ex
ecutive Committee were open
only to committee members.
The question of student rep
resentation will remain under
consideration of the full Senate.
A motion from the steering com
mittee that a committee to deal
with this be established was de
feated 25-10.
Several Reasons Given
Several reasons have been
given for not allowing student
members in the Senate. One is
that other University constitu
encies, such as instructors and
research associates, are also
without representation.
However, a majority of the
Committee on Government of
the Study of Education at Stan
ford felt that five students
should be included in the Sen
ate without vote.
They thought a small number
of students "would enhance the
effectiveness of the Senate as
a faculty deliberative and deci
sion making body." Some felt
this would be desirable as a step
towards community government,
while others rejected this idea.
Opposing this view was Walter
Sokel, professor of German and
European languages. He said
that "the inclusion of five non
voting student members in the
Senate would seriously weaken
our sense of identity as repre
sentatives of the Academic
Council, without any conferment
of true power to the student
body.
"If we want effective collabor
ation with the students within
Itfie present set-up," he con
tinued, we should aim at a strong

identity of ourselves as the legi
slative arm of the Academic
Council and encourage, by all
means, a strong counterpart
among the students, which
should have real and effective
power."
