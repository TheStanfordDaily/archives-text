## 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON 
Kenneth Sanborn Pitzer, pres
ident of Rice University in Hous
ton, Texas, has been chosen as
Stanford's sixth president, suc
ce ding J. E. Wallace Sterling,
president for the last 19 years.
Prof. Pitzer, a nationally
':nown chemist, has been presi
dent of Rice since 1961. Prior to
that he was professor of chem
i try at the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley, serving as
vice-chairman of the academic
senate there.
Student Reaction
Student reaction to Pitzer's ap
pointment was mixed. Student
body president Denis Hayes and
Stanford Daily editor Dan Snell
were both critical of the manner
of selection of Stanford's sixth
president. (See related story.)
Hayes protested the lack of
student participation in the se
lection process while Snell was
critical of Pitzer's apparent lack
of experience with the problems
of a major university such as
Stanford.
Snell singled out last Spring's
sit-in and black student demands
as examples of problems which
Pitzer has had little acquaint
ance.
Robert J. Glaser, dean of the
medical school, will serve as act

ing president until Pitzer takes
office December 1.
Second To None
In a recent press conference at
Stanford, Pitzer said Stanford's
"aim and ambition should be to
be a university second to none
in the world," and equal of MIT
and Harvard put together.
In reference to student partici
pation in the selection of univer
sity presidents Pitzer said stu
dents "certainly should have an
opportunity to put information
into the process. How it goes
will vary at each institution."
In announcing the selection of
the new president, effective De
cember 1, Stanford board chair
man W. Parmer Fuller paid, "Di\
Pitzer's academic credentials are
of the highest order, and his rec
ord as president of Rice Univer
sity is an enviable one. I have
found him to be a man of ability,
integrity, .understanding, and
fairness "
Personal Warmth
Law Professor William Bax
ter, head of the faculty presiden
tial selection committee, said,
"Dr. Pitzer's personal warmth,
intellectual breadth and sensi
tivity, his outstanding record of
scholarship, and his long aca
demic experience all give us as
surance he will lead Stanford ef
fectively and with imagination."
The selection of Pitzer was
also a surprise to many of his
colleagues at Rice. Pitzer had
just completed a $33 million fund
raising drive when his new posi
tion was announced.
$33 Million Fund Drive
In an interview with the Daily,
Pitzer said he had first been ap
proached by Stanford represen
tatives in March. At that time he
told the selection committee he
was involved in a $33 million
fund raising drive for Rice and
could not consider leaving.
The drive was successfully
completed early this summer
and Pitzer was again approached
by Stanford. This time, however,
Pitzer was more favorably dis
posed and indicated his accept
ance early in August. The public
announcement was made August
19.
Rice's dean of students Paul
Pfeiffcr said Pitzer has a "sym
pathetic concern fo/ students"
and was leaving "a successful
job." Referring to the unfavor
able reaction of some Stanford
students to the appointment,
Pfeiffer said he was "concerned
over whether people will give
him a chance."
Chemist
Pitzer is a nationally known


KENNETH S. PITZER
chemist and was recently named
to receive the 1968 Priestly
medal of the American Chemical
Society. The Priestly medal is
given annually "for distinguish
ed service to chemistry."
Pitzer is a native Californian
and was graduated from Cal
Tech and Berkeley. He was on
the Berkeley faculty from 1937
until 1961 when he took over at
Rice. Throughout his academic
career Pitzer has been quite ac
tive in government-sponsored
research.
From 1949 to 1951 he served
as director of research for the
Atomic Energy Commission
(AEC), a full-time position.
Since then he has also served on
the general advisory committee
of the AEC and is currently a
member of the President's sci
ence advisory committee.
RAND Tnistee
Pitzer also serves as a trustee
of the RAND Corporation, a gov
ernment financed "think-tank"
that is primarily concerned with
military research, though it is
branching into studios of urban
(problems as well.
RAND has come under heavy

attack from anti-war groups for
its deep involvement in projects
concerning the Vietnam war.
Pitzer defends his association
with the corporation saying, his
position serves to insulate re
searchers from governmental
pressure. He said he views his
association with RAND as a
"personal civic activity."
IDA "Quite Wrong"
In reference to the Institute
for Defense Analysis (IDA)
which was an item of contro
versy in last spring's Columbia
University disorders, Pitzer says
that the arrangement whereby
universities sat on the board of
trustees of IDA was "quite
wrong." He states, "universities
should join interuniversity as
sociations only."
Pitzer defends Stanford's role
in creating and helping govern
the Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) which has also been at
tacked for war-oriented re
search. The new president says
SRI "serves a useful purpose in
relieving the university from
pressure to do work for the gov
ernment."

(For other details of Pitzer's
tenure at Rice, see story on Mon

time California family. Pitzer
College in the Claremont com
plex is named after his father
who provided much of the en

were both critical of the manner
of selection of Stanford's sixth
president. (See related story.)
Hayes protested the lack of

critical of Pitzer's apparent lack

Snell singled out last Spring's
sit-in and black student demands
as examples of problems which
Pitzer has had little acquaint

Robert J. Glaser, dean of the
medical school, will serve as act

office December 1.
Second To None
In a recent press conference at
Stanford, Pitzer said Stanford's
"aim and ambition should be to
be a university second to none
in the world," and equal of MIT
and Harvard put together.
In reference to student partici
pation in the selection of univer
sity presidents Pitzer said stu
dents "certainly should have an
opportunity to put information
into the process. How it goes
will vary at each institution."
In announcing the selection of
the new president, effective De
cember 1, Stanford board chair
man W. Parmer Fuller paid, "Di\
Pitzer's academic credentials are
of the highest order, and his rec
ord as president of Rice Univer
sity is an enviable one. I have
found him to be a man of ability,
integrity, .understanding, and
fairness "
Personal Warmth
Law Professor William Bax
ter, head of the faculty presiden
tial selection committee, said,
"Dr. Pitzer's personal warmth,
intellectual breadth and sensi
tivity, his outstanding record of
scholarship, and his long aca
demic experience all give us as
surance he will lead Stanford ef
fectively and with imagination."
The selection of Pitzer was
also a surprise to many of his
colleagues at Rice. Pitzer had
just completed a $33 million fund
raising drive when his new posi
tion was announced.
$33 Million Fund Drive
In an interview with the Daily,
Pitzer said he had first been ap
proached by Stanford represen
tatives in March. At that time he
told the selection committee he
was involved in a $33 million
fund raising drive for Rice and
could not consider leaving.
The drive was successfully
completed early this summer
and Pitzer was again approached
by Stanford. This time, however,
Pitzer was more favorably dis
posed and indicated his accept
ance early in August. The public
announcement was made August
19.
Rice's dean of students Paul
Pfeiffcr said Pitzer has a "sym
pathetic concern fo/ students"
and was leaving "a successful
job." Referring to the unfavor
able reaction of some Stanford
students to the appointment,
Pfeiffer said he was "concerned
over whether people will give
him a chance."

Pitzer is a nationally known


KENNETH S. PITZER
chemist and was recently named
to receive the 1968 Priestly

Pitzer is a native Californian
and was graduated from Cal
Tech and Berkeley. He was on
the Berkeley faculty from 1937
until 1961 when he took over at
Rice. Throughout his academic
career Pitzer has been quite ac

research.
From 1949 to 1951 he served
as director of research for the
Atomic Energy Commission
(AEC), a full-time position.
Since then he has also served on
the general advisory committee
of the AEC and is currently a

RAND Tnistee
Pitzer also serves as a trustee
of the RAND Corporation, a gov

that is primarily concerned with
military research, though it is
branching into studios of urban
(problems as well.
RAND has come under heavy

attack from anti-war groups for
its deep involvement in projects
concerning the Vietnam war.
Pitzer defends his association
with the corporation saying, his
position serves to insulate re

pressure. He said he views his
association with RAND as a
"personal civic activity."

to receive the 1968 Priestly
medal of the American Chemical
Society. The Priestly medal is
given annually "for distinguish

Pitzer is a native Californian
and was graduated from Cal
Tech and Berkeley. He was on
the Berkeley faculty from 1937
until 1961 when he took over at
Rice. Throughout his academic
career Pitzer has been quite ac
tive in government-sponsored
research.
From 1949 to 1951 he served
as director of research for the
Atomic Energy Commission
(AEC), a full-time position.
Since then he has also served on
the general advisory committee
of the AEC and is currently a
member of the President's sci
ence advisory committee.
RAND Tnistee
Pitzer also serves as a trustee
of the RAND Corporation, a gov
ernment financed "think-tank"
that is primarily concerned with
military research, though it is
branching into studios of urban
(problems as well.
RAND has come under heavy

attack from anti-war groups for
its deep involvement in projects
concerning the Vietnam war.
Pitzer defends his association
with the corporation saying, his
position serves to insulate re
searchers from governmental
pressure. He said he views his
association with RAND as a
"personal civic activity."
IDA "Quite Wrong"
In reference to the Institute
for Defense Analysis (IDA)
which was an item of contro
versy in last spring's Columbia
University disorders, Pitzer says
that the arrangement whereby
universities sat on the board of
trustees of IDA was "quite
wrong." He states, "universities
should join interuniversity as
sociations only."
Pitzer defends Stanford's role
in creating and helping govern
the Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) which has also been at
tacked for war-oriented re
search. The new president says
SRI "serves a useful purpose in
relieving the university from
pressure to do work for the gov
ernment."

Stanford's sixth president, suc
ce ding J. E. Wallace Sterling,
president for the last 19 years.
Prof. Pitzer, a nationally
':nown chemist, has been presi
dent of Rice since 1961. Prior to
that he was professor of chem
i try at the University of Cali

Student Reaction
Student reaction to Pitzer's ap
pointment was mixed. Student
body president Denis Hayes and
Stanford Daily editor Dan Snell
were both critical of the manner
of selection of Stanford's sixth
president. (See related story.)
Hayes protested the lack of
student participation in the se
lection process while Snell was
critical of Pitzer's apparent lack
of experience with the problems
of a major university such as
Stanford.
Snell singled out last Spring's
sit-in and black student demands
as examples of problems which
Pitzer has had little acquaint
ance.
Robert J. Glaser, dean of the
medical school, will serve as act

ing president until Pitzer takes
office December 1.
Second To None
In a recent press conference at
Stanford, Pitzer said Stanford's
"aim and ambition should be to
be a university second to none
in the world," and equal of MIT
and Harvard put together.
In reference to student partici
pation in the selection of univer
sity presidents Pitzer said stu
dents "certainly should have an
opportunity to put information
into the process. How it goes
will vary at each institution."
In announcing the selection of
the new president, effective De
cember 1, Stanford board chair
man W. Parmer Fuller paid, "Di\
Pitzer's academic credentials are
of the highest order, and his rec
ord as president of Rice Univer
sity is an enviable one. I have
found him to be a man of ability,
integrity, .understanding, and
fairness "
Personal Warmth
Law Professor William Bax
ter, head of the faculty presiden
tial selection committee, said,
"Dr. Pitzer's personal warmth,
intellectual breadth and sensi
tivity, his outstanding record of
scholarship, and his long aca
demic experience all give us as
surance he will lead Stanford ef
fectively and with imagination."
The selection of Pitzer was
also a surprise to many of his
colleagues at Rice. Pitzer had
just completed a $33 million fund
raising drive when his new posi
tion was announced.
$33 Million Fund Drive
In an interview with the Daily,
Pitzer said he had first been ap
proached by Stanford represen
tatives in March. At that time he
told the selection committee he
was involved in a $33 million
fund raising drive for Rice and
could not consider leaving.
The drive was successfully
completed early this summer
and Pitzer was again approached
by Stanford. This time, however,
Pitzer was more favorably dis
posed and indicated his accept
ance early in August. The public
announcement was made August
19.
Rice's dean of students Paul
Pfeiffcr said Pitzer has a "sym
pathetic concern fo/ students"
and was leaving "a successful
job." Referring to the unfavor
able reaction of some Stanford
students to the appointment,
Pfeiffer said he was "concerned
over whether people will give
him a chance."
