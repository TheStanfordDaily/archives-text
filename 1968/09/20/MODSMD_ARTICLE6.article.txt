# Rice's Pitzer New Chief
## 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON 
Kenneth Sanborn Pitzer, pres
ident of Rice University in Hous
ton, Texas, has been chosen as
Stanford's sixth president, suc
ce ding J. E. Wallace Sterling,
president for the last 19 years.
Prof. Pitzer, a nationally
':nown chemist, has been presi
dent of Rice since 1961. Prior to
that he was professor of chem
i try at the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley, serving as
vice-chairman of the academic
senate there.
Student Reaction
Student reaction to Pitzer's ap
pointment was mixed. Student
body president Denis Hayes and
Stanford Daily editor Dan Snell
were both critical of the manner
of selection of Stanford's sixth
president. (See related story.)
Hayes protested the lack of
student participation in the se
lection process while Snell was
critical of Pitzer's apparent lack
of experience with the problems
of a major university such as
Stanford.
Snell singled out last Spring's
sit-in and black student demands
as examples of problems which
Pitzer has had little acquaint
ance.
Robert J. Glaser, dean of the
medical school, will serve as act

ing president until Pitzer takes
office December 1.
Second To None
In a recent press conference at
Stanford, Pitzer said Stanford's
"aim and ambition should be to
be a university second to none
in the world," and equal of MIT
and Harvard put together.
In reference to student partici
pation in the selection of univer
sity presidents Pitzer said stu
dents "certainly should have an
opportunity to put information
into the process. How it goes
will vary at each institution."
In announcing the selection of
the new president, effective De
cember 1, Stanford board chair
man W. Parmer Fuller paid, "Di\
Pitzer's academic credentials are
of the highest order, and his rec
ord as president of Rice Univer
sity is an enviable one. I have
found him to be a man of ability,
integrity, .understanding, and
fairness "
Personal Warmth
Law Professor William Bax
ter, head of the faculty presiden
tial selection committee, said,
"Dr. Pitzer's personal warmth,
intellectual breadth and sensi
tivity, his outstanding record of
scholarship, and his long aca
demic experience all give us as
surance he will lead Stanford ef
fectively and with imagination."
The selection of Pitzer was
also a surprise to many of his
colleagues at Rice. Pitzer had
just completed a $33 million fund
raising drive when his new posi
tion was announced.
$33 Million Fund Drive
In an interview with the Daily,
Pitzer said he had first been ap
proached by Stanford represen
tatives in March. At that time he
told the selection committee he
was involved in a $33 million
fund raising drive for Rice and
could not consider leaving.
The drive was successfully
completed early this summer
and Pitzer was again approached
by Stanford. This time, however,
Pitzer was more favorably dis
posed and indicated his accept
ance early in August. The public
announcement was made August
19.
Rice's dean of students Paul
Pfeiffcr said Pitzer has a "sym
pathetic concern fo/ students"
and was leaving "a successful
job." Referring to the unfavor
able reaction of some Stanford
students to the appointment,
Pfeiffer said he was "concerned
over whether people will give
him a chance."
