A volcano of advice, warnings, opinions and his
torical interpretations is already erupting in the ears
of the Class of 1972 as they make their way through
their first few days at Stanford.
Numerous years of parental warmth and wisdom
are gone now, with only fragments of advice and gui
dance lingering on in the subconscious. In addition,
countless new forces are now beginning to clamor for
attention. University administrators representing th ?
older generation, upperclassmen with their point of
view to drive home, and fellow freshmen bringing to
campus their own particular background, add up to
a fury of conflicting stresses and strains upon the
mind of the newly arrived freshman.
Only time and experience will clarify the jumble of
viewpoints and remarks being hurled back and forth.
For now, it is important that each freshman sift
through the verbage of this helter-skelter debate, and
refuse to withdraw in fear from the dizzy rush of
speeches, articles, and new ideas.

Student voices that called this summer for a new
typo of national politics, a new way of thinking, and
ind ed a new spirit of life were clearly stifled. This
national trend of running away from change and
cloaking fear in pious preachments for "law and
order" must clearly not be allowed to sift its way
down to the Class of 1972.
Indeed, we would reject the timeworn advice of
f red to freshmen as they embark on their collegiate
educational excursion: "Don't jump off the deep end."
Jump ofT the deep end: be involved in campus life,
community life, or national political life. We reject
old adages of "taking the long view" or "using mod
eration" when confronting today's issues.
Jump oft the deep end: mold individual education,
don't be molded by the educational process.
Jump oft' the deep end: take a faculty member to
lunch next week. It's free.
Jump oft the deep end: reject the cliche of the
"mixer." Get to know someone. Get to know yourself.

Jump off the thtep end: stay up all night to watch
the sun rise.
The educational machinery will grind on, Nixon or
Humphrey or Wallace will take over from Johnson,
and established institutions will continue to evolve
one way or another, regardless of what each individual
freshman does with his four years at Stanford.
But the important point is that each freshman re
examine' his past values as he confronts a myriad of
new ideas these first few days and that he strengthen
his old beliefs or discard them as he meets new prob
lems.
The "don't jump off the d ep end" approach is dead:
it can only produce Richard Nixons, institutional ra
cism, "law and order" justice, and students without a
real education.
The only way to discover what intellectual pursuit,
sex, pot, political activism, and faculty members real
ly are all about is to face th 'm honestly, and to make
i personal judgment in each case. Take the plunge.
