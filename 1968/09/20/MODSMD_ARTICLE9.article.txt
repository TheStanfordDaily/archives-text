• Down The Drain
Editor, The Daily:
On June 2nd I quit Stanford.
It wasn't official until I in
formed the various heads of de
partments and went through all
that. But for all practical pur
poses it occurred during the per
formance of a composition I had
written. It was intended for my
Bathtub and I hardly suspected
Dinkelspiel, the Music Depart
ment, the Stanford Daily, the
Graduate School, the Student
Body, the President, and myself
ad nauseam would be included
in the burial ritual when I con
ceived the piece. But I felt we
were all implicated. We had all
filled the tub with the stink of
our illusions.
And I ask as I journey to new
Bathtubs, for the world has be
come one to me in a symbolic
way, doesn't the stench bother
you? Or can you carry forth in
your self-surviving ways with
out ever noticing that you are
a creative being and that as you
pass through the treadmills of
this university, you are relin
quishing your ties to humanity?
Can a creative environment as
sterile as Stanford satisfy our
needs as we are growing as stu
dents, let alone fulfill them? And
if we are pacified, as I was by
the lure of fat fellowships, Mid-
Peninsula sunshine and scholar
ly seclusion, what happens to
our compassion? Does the world
cease its suffering because we
have it made? What the hell
happens to the water after it
goes down the drain?
So, fulfilling some distant
creative needs, the Stanford
Chamber Orchestra performed
my composition on a sunny
June afternoon. Many people sat

through the concert basking in
the convivial atmosphere of
Tresidder or bathing in the fresh
breezes of final papers. It was
not a great loss. You probably
didn't even know my Bathtub
was ailing. But it had an appro
priate burial. And you know, it
wasn't until then that I realized
I too was ailing.
I write this with a touch of
hurt, a touch of anger and a
touch of madness. I have left
Stanford to fol'ovv the dirty wa
ter!

• Nixon's The One?
Editor, The Daily:
More than at any other time
in our nation's history, the role
of students in politics has as
sumed tremendous importance.
... 1 firmly believe that our na
tion is suffering a crisis of the
spirit, and such a crisis cannot
be met by those who refuse to
listen to the American people.
And it cannot be met by those
who have led our nation into
that crisis. It can be met only
by a man who has developed
concrete solutions to our na
tion's ills; a man who can lead
us out of the war in Viet Nam
quickly and honorably; and a
man who understands the frus
trations of the inner city and
has found a way to heal them.
We at Youth for Nixon be
lieve that the man for our time
is Richard Nixon. We ask you to
join with us to help elect him,
and to assure that the voice of
our generation is heard. . . .

didn't even know my Bathtub
was ailing. But it had an appro
priate burial. And you know, it
wasn't until then that I realized
I too was ailing.
I write this with a touch of
hurt, a touch of anger and a
touch of madness. I have left
Stanford to fol'ovv the dirty wa
ter!

• Nixon's The One?
Editor, The Daily:
More than at any other time
in our nation's history, the role
of students in politics has as
sumed tremendous importance.
... 1 firmly believe that our na
tion is suffering a crisis of the
spirit, and such a crisis cannot
be met by those who refuse to
listen to the American people.
And it cannot be met by those
who have led our nation into
that crisis. It can be met only
by a man who has developed
concrete solutions to our na
tion's ills; a man who can lead
us out of the war in Viet Nam
quickly and honorably; and a
man who understands the frus
trations of the inner city and
has found a way to heal them.
We at Youth for Nixon be
lieve that the man for our time
is Richard Nixon. We ask you to
join with us to help elect him,
and to assure that the voice of
our generation is heard. . . .

• Down The Drain
Editor, The Daily:
On June 2nd I quit Stanford.
It wasn't official until I in
formed the various heads of de
partments and went through all
that. But for all practical pur
poses it occurred during the per
formance of a composition I had
written. It was intended for my
Bathtub and I hardly suspected
Dinkelspiel, the Music Depart
ment, the Stanford Daily, the
Graduate School, the Student
Body, the President, and myself
ad nauseam would be included
in the burial ritual when I con
ceived the piece. But I felt we
were all implicated. We had all
filled the tub with the stink of
our illusions.
And I ask as I journey to new
Bathtubs, for the world has be
come one to me in a symbolic
way, doesn't the stench bother
you? Or can you carry forth in
your self-surviving ways with
out ever noticing that you are
a creative being and that as you
pass through the treadmills of
this university, you are relin
quishing your ties to humanity?
Can a creative environment as
sterile as Stanford satisfy our
needs as we are growing as stu
dents, let alone fulfill them? And
if we are pacified, as I was by
the lure of fat fellowships, Mid-
Peninsula sunshine and scholar
ly seclusion, what happens to
our compassion? Does the world
cease its suffering because we
have it made? What the hell
happens to the water after it
goes down the drain?
So, fulfilling some distant
creative needs, the Stanford
Chamber Orchestra performed
my composition on a sunny
June afternoon. Many people sat

through the concert basking in
the convivial atmosphere of
Tresidder or bathing in the fresh
breezes of final papers. It was
not a great loss. You probably
didn't even know my Bathtub
was ailing. But it had an appro
priate burial. And you know, it
wasn't until then that I realized
I too was ailing.

hurt, a touch of anger and a
