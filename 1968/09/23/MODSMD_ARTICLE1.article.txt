# Cleaver Accepts Lecture Invitation
## 
### 
Presidential candidate Eldridge
Cleaver has accepted an invita
tion to deliver three lectures at
Stanford this fall in a series ar
ranged by the Committee for a
New Democratic Politics.
David W. Jones, chairman of
the Committee, announced yes
terday that both Cleaver and
San Francisco supervisor Terry
Francois have agreed to partici
pate in the lecture program.
Francois is considered by many
a more moderate representative
of the black community than
Cleaver.
Cleaver, nominee of the Peace
and Freedom Party, author of
Soul On Ice and minister of in
formation for the Black Pan
thers, is the center of a contro
versy that was set off when he
was appointed to teach an ex
perimental course on racism at
Berkeley.
Governor Ronald Reagan, Sen
atorial candidate Max Rafferty
and Assembly Speaker Jesse
Unruh all objected to Cleaver's
appearances at the University of
California. The state legislature
voted to censure both the UC
administration and the univer
sity's Board of Regents.
The Regents subsequently de
cided to allow Cleaver one ap
pearance instead of the ten that
had been scheduled. Student and
faculty sponsors of the experi
mental course that Cleaver
would have headed have called
on the Berkeley academic com
munity to fight the ruling.
Stanford Support
At Stanford, Prof. Robert Pol
hemus, head of the freshman

English program, released a
statement supporting the Berke
ley faculty and deploring "any
kind of political coercion of the
faculty and the university which
tends to stiflle the ideas of un
popular men." He will submit a
resolution to this effect to the
academic senate on Thursday.
Soul On Ice is included in the
list from which freshman En
glish instructors at Stanford se
lect reading material for their
lasses. Polhemus refers to It as
"a provocative and fine book."
Jones, a graduate in the Com
munication Department, said
that his group invited Cleaver
and Francois to speak here "be
cause of the overwhelming im
portance of achieving racial jus
tice in this nation."
"We believe that education is
most relevant when it is taught
by a proponent of a view," he
said.
Jones also said that his group
wanted to "demonstrate the
reality of academic freedom at
Stanford."
Berkeley Sponsors
Cleaver's course at Berkeley
was the idea of Lawrence Ma
gid, a senior in sociology. Magid
belongs to a student group
called the Center for Participant
Education which recommended
the course to the Board of Edu
cational Development, a faculty
body.
BED was set up in the wake
of the Free Speech demonstra
tions of 1965. It is empowered to
consider and enact student pro
posals for educational innova-
tion. Cleavers course was ap
proved by the Board.
Cleaver recently pleaded not
guilty to charges growing out
of a gunfight with Oakland po

lice on April 6. He has served
time in prison for narcotics and
assault convictions, and is pres- j
ently on parole.
Reagan recently called Cleav
er an "advocate of racism and
violence" and said that his ap
pointment at Berkeley was "an
affront and an insult to the peo
ple of California."
One portion of the course that
Cleaver had planned would have
dealt with the influence of rac
ism in grade B movies, with
films starring the governor as
text.
