Kditor, The Daily:
Concerning the full page de
voted to Chicago in the Friday
Daily: Recently the whole nation
saw on television, and the news
papers, the disgraceful actions
fo the Hippies, Yippies, draft re
sisters, and all kinds of demon
strators in Chicago. The police
and the National Guard had to
do what was done there to these
people that thought they could
just take over a national conven
tion.
If the police and the National
Guard were not there to give
the protection to the delegates
from all over the country, I
wonder what would have hap
pened. These people that think
they can just take the law into
their hands and do what they
want have another thing com
ing.
All the public has seen is one
side of the whole demonstration.
Why don't the press and TV
show what was done to the po
lice and National Guardsmen? I
want to compliment Mayor Rich
ard Daley for his actions in pre
venting a riot.
There is just too much of
this business of protesting and
demonstrating all over this great
country of ours and the general
public is sick and tired of it all.
It is a privilege to be an Amer
ican citizen and be able to have
all the wonder things this coun
try has to offer.
Right at the present, people
are trying to suit their own
gains and are demanding all
kinds of hand-outs at the ex
pense of the taxpayer. Imagine

this welfare racket â€” it is half
the state's budget and the tax
payer has to bear the brunt of
the bill. Why don't these people
go out and go to work like every
other person has to?
I can say now that the pub
lic is fed up with it and will soon
stand up to all these people who
want to destroy the American
way of life.
The work of Communism is
to infiltrate our churches and
schools and that is exactly what
is about to happen in this great
country of ours. Clergymen are
getting into things they should
mind their own business on. And
the sooner they stay in the
churches where they belong in
stead of leading demonstrations
all over the country, the better
off they will be.
We should have more men in
public life like Mayor Daley and
the country would be a lot better
off.

Editor, The Daily:
No new president could be
perfect in the eyes of all stu
dents. On the other hand, the
students at Rice seemed well
pleased with Dr. Pitzer, and were
sad to lose him.
I have just returned from a
week's visit at Rice. I found
there a very different atmo
sphere than exists here, an al
most active apathy concerning
social and institutional issues.
Nevertheless, the students who
knew Pitzer spoke of him favor
ably, and alway mentioned his

continued approval of student re
quests.
It seems to me that, every
Stanford student must at least
give Dr. Pitzer a fair chance at
being president here before con
demning him. It is in the nature
of this community to accept
every other member as a person,
and not to judge him from sec
ond hand information concerning
his past.
