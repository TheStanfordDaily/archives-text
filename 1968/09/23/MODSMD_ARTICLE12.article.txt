# Is "----" Obsolete?

### ART BUCHWALD 
The four-letter word, which in
the past could only be seen on
the walls of men's washrooms
and heard only in GI barracks,
is now popping up all over the
place. This is causing a great
deal of concern amongst philolo
gists who feel that the word is
becoming so common that it
will soon lose its impact.
Prof. Weymouth Langue, who
has made a lifetime study of
four-letter words at the Univer
sity of Kussin, told me that un
less the trend is reversed, the
four-letter word would soon be
come obsolete as the five-letter
word Edsel.
"There are only two-four let
ter words that I am concerned
with," said Prof. Langue. "While
you still can't print them in your
newspaper, I'm sure you know
which ones I mean. In the past
these words had the most power
ful effect on the English lang
uage. The reason for it is that
they were used sparingly and
only under very great provoca
tion.
"But, alas, in the last 10 years,
the words are written into every
stage play, and they are includ
ed in every best-seller. Under
ground newspapers feature them
in headlines, national magazines
vie to print them in feature
stories on Norman Mailer, and
the latest place they've appeared
at the antiwar demonstrations
in Chicago. There doesn't seem
to be any place where one can't

hear or read a four-letter word
these days."
"And this bothers you?" I
asked.
"Only because the words are
losing their value. I have always
believed that once you had pro
liferation in the use of these two
four-letter words, they would
have very little retaliatory effect.
For years they have given tre
mendous release to people under
pressure. I doubt if our Gl's
could have gotten through any
of their wars without them. But
now, through overuse, there is a
great deal of apathy when you
hear a four-letter word, and it
has as much effect on you as the
word 'rain' or 'book.' "
"But according to Mayor Da
ley, one of the reasons the police
might have overreacted in Chi
cago was because of the four
letter words used against them
by the mobs. They must have
some emotional impact if they
made the police do what they
did."
"Yes, this is possibly true, but
most riot training these days
specifically instructs trainees to
ignore obscenity from the
crowds. The Chicago police
broke their discipline, but we
still don't know whether it was
the four-letter words or what
preceded or came after them
that caused the police to get as
rough as they did. My opinion is
that the words themselves were
not responsible, particularly
since the police used them also.

One four letter word will always
cancel out another unless it is
used in a sentence."
"If these two words go out of
fashion because of overusp, what
other words will replace them?"
"They've already been replac
ed. You can get a much more
emotional response out of some
one by saying 'cops' or 'Viet
nam' or 'honkey' or 'nigger'
than you can get out of 'blank'
and 'blank.' "
"People even get mad when
you say 'students,'" I said.
"Right. Obscenity can no long
er be counted on as a trigger
word, and I think this is blank
ing up the whole English langu
age."
"What can you do about it?"
"Those of us who are inter
ested in the problem are starting
a campaign to preserve our four
letter words. We think they
should be declared a national
heritage, and be used as a last
resort only in anger, and when
people can no longer reason to
gether."

ter words that I am concerned
with," said Prof. Langue. "While
you still can't print them in your
newspaper, I'm sure you know
which ones I mean. In the past
these words had the most power
ful effect on the English lang
uage. The reason for it is that
they were used sparingly and
only under very great provoca
tion.
"But, alas, in the last 10 years,
the words are written into every
stage play, and they are includ
ed in every best-seller. Under
ground newspapers feature them
in headlines, national magazines
vie to print them in feature
stories on Norman Mailer, and
the latest place they've appeared
at the antiwar demonstrations
in Chicago. There doesn't seem
to be any place where one can't

hear or read a four-letter word
these days."
"And this bothers you?" I
asked.
"Only because the words are
losing their value. I have always
believed that once you had pro
liferation in the use of these two
four-letter words, they would
have very little retaliatory effect.
For years they have given tre
mendous release to people under
pressure. I doubt if our Gl's
could have gotten through any
of their wars without them. But
now, through overuse, there is a
great deal of apathy when you
hear a four-letter word, and it
has as much effect on you as the
word 'rain' or 'book.' "
"But according to Mayor Da
ley, one of the reasons the police
might have overreacted in Chi
cago was because of the four
letter words used against them
by the mobs. They must have
some emotional impact if they
made the police do what they
did."
"Yes, this is possibly true, but
most riot training these days
specifically instructs trainees to
ignore obscenity from the
crowds. The Chicago police
broke their discipline, but we
still don't know whether it was
the four-letter words or what
preceded or came after them
that caused the police to get as
rough as they did. My opinion is
that the words themselves were
not responsible, particularly
since the police used them also.

One four letter word will always
cancel out another unless it is
used in a sentence."
"If these two words go out of
fashion because of overusp, what
other words will replace them?"
"They've already been replac
ed. You can get a much more
emotional response out of some
one by saying 'cops' or 'Viet
nam' or 'honkey' or 'nigger'
than you can get out of 'blank'
and 'blank.' "
"People even get mad when
you say 'students,'" I said.
"Right. Obscenity can no long
er be counted on as a trigger
word, and I think this is blank
ing up the whole English langu
age."
"What can you do about it?"
"Those of us who are inter
ested in the problem are starting
a campaign to preserve our four
letter words. We think they
should be declared a national
heritage, and be used as a last
resort only in anger, and when
people can no longer reason to
gether."

The four-letter word, which in
the past could only be seen on
the walls of men's washrooms
and heard only in GI barracks,
is now popping up all over the
place. This is causing a great
deal of concern amongst philolo
gists who feel that the word is
becoming so common that it
will soon lose its impact.
Prof. Weymouth Langue, who
has made a lifetime study of
four-letter words at the Univer
sity of Kussin, told me that un
less the trend is reversed, the
four-letter word would soon be
come obsolete as the five-letter
word Edsel.
"There are only two-four let
ter words that I am concerned
with," said Prof. Langue. "While
you still can't print them in your
