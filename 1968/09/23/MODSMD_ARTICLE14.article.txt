## Course Increases Reading Speed Students Can Comprehend At 2500 Words Per Minute 
### ED SEJUD Daily Illini Staff Writer 
Speed reading does have its little
problems.
As my hand hurried across the
pages, making an audible "swish
ing" sound, I became aware of a cer
tain stillness in the library. Looking
up from my book, I confronted an
assortment of stunned, bemused, dis
gusted and genuinely sympathetic
countenances on the faces of my
tablemates, all silently asking, "Hey
fella, what're you doing with your
hand?"
"Speed reading!" I cried, jump
ing at my chance to show-off, "I can
read 2,000 words per minute (wpm),
comprehend more, get less tired,
complete the assignment and STILL
log more drinking time than ever
before, FURTHERMORE .. ."-and
so the lecture continued, ending with
"... That's no brag—just plain fact."
Wednesday night the Reading Dy
namics Institute graduated its first
University class, boasting that its
students had increased their aver
age reading speed hy five times and
had made substantial increases in
comprehension as well.
First of Kind
The Evelyn Wood Reading Dy
namics course is the first of its kind

to be offered on the University cam
pus. It works on a new principal
which uses the reader's own hand
as a "pacer", contending that you
don't have to mentally repeat ("sub
vocalize") all that you read, but
rather that you can, when properly
instructed, open a direct channel be
tween your mind and the printed
page.
Students at the Reading Dynam
ics Institute learn to read DOWN
the page rather than across it.
Their eyes flow across the pages in
soft-focus rather than in the jerky
and old-fashioned "single fixation"
method.
Greater Command
Reading dynamically, you obtain
a greater overall command of the
material, as especially evident in
long novels where one often forgets
the beginning of the story by the
time he reaches the end.
Instead of bypassing "War and
Peace", dynamic readers can only
complain, "Oh hell, I'll have to waste
two hours reading it!"
Ideally, such a concept offers
printed material as if it were a
painting, a sculpture, or other work
of art. The reader considers it as a
whole, as a complete, single entity

rather than an agglomeration of
pages, paragraphs or chapters.
Because such readers make fewer
eye-fixations and mental repetitions
than ordinary readers, they are less
susceptible to eye fatigue and the
usual headaches and drowsiness.
Since it is a manual skill rather
than a function of intelligence, it
doesn't matter what the reader's IQ
is. While P.E. majors still won't un
derstand texts on nuclear physics,
they'll be able to read non-technical
material at speeds equal to their
technically-oriented classmates.
Paul Wilcher, super-reader who
conducts the course, is an instructor
equal or better than any you'll find
on the University payroll. His
classes are cheerful and competent
with an informality that offers wel
come relief from the dreary Univer
sity classes which students are so
steeled against.
The price is a factor which dis
courages prospective students, but
it's cheap by any standards.
If a student avails himself of all
the facilities offered by the Institute
and attends all the class sessions,
the price boils down to only about $2
an hour, cheaper than any private
tutoring you'll ever find. Spread over
four years, the course can save thou
sands of study hours and can prob
ably affect a boost in a student's
grade-point average. Assignments
which once took days can be accom
plished in a matter of hours, leaving
more time for other pursuits (fun,

■
drinking, pills, etc.). The Institute
estimates that it can save average
students 3~>0 hours of study time
each semester —probably an under
statement.
Class Session
Class sessions are two and a half
hours long: and are held once a week
(for eight weeks). Optional drill
sessions are free, with private coun
seling available. After the initial
payment (which can be made in in
stallments ) everything is provided
by the Institute. The student brings
only the essential apparatus — his
hand
I attended the cou rse in my custom
ary manner, coming late to classes,
often without the assigned home
work and without attending even a
single optional drill session. None
theless, I managed to increase my
reading rate by five times and can
now read average material at about
2,000 wpm with good comprehen
sion. More diligent students raised
their reading rates by more than 10
times, with accompanying increases
in comprehension.
You still feel a little silly in the
library, but finishing half a semes
ter's reserve-file readings at a crack
is more than worth it. The course
(which carries a money-back guar
antee) seems a valuable investment
for any student, or anyone with
great reading demands, and will un
doubtedly gain popularity as its rep
utation spreads.
