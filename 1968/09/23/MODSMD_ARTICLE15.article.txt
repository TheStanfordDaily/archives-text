# Harris, Baez Hit 'Schizophrenia'
## 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
Stanford students have been
brought up as schizophrenics,
former student body president
Dave Harris and his wife Joan
Baez told an overflow audience
at Memorial Church Saturday
night.
According to Miss Baez, an
internationally known folksing
er, children are brought up be
lieving to love their neighbors.
She said that when young men
turn 18, "everything is sacrificed
to the nation: duty comes first."
Harris said, "If you begin to
live that brotherhood, and are
between the ages of 18 and 35,
you run smack into a social in
stitution," the draft.
"If one chooses to live out
brotherhood ... it means taking
on a new social role — the so
cial role of the prison," he said
referring to refusing to par
ticipate in the draft.
Induction Refused
Harris refused induction into
are army last winter, and was
subsequently convicted of refus
ing to cooperate with the induc
tion authorities.
Miss Baez said that America
needs a revolution. She contend
ed that the revolution would be
everyone realizing that no one
has a right to take another's
life.
There is "one family on earth,
not tribes or nations," she said.
She and her husband said that
what stands between the ideal of
brotherhood and it realization is
nations and their constant rival
ries.
A Question Of Allegiance
Harris echocd the same
thought saying that the question
facing all humans is "to what or
to whom they owe their allegi
ance." He said that men should
not owe their allegiance "to a
colored piece of cloth, but to the
fact of people's lives in the world
today."
He asked that the audience
join with the draft resistance,
and said, "I'm standing up for
my brothers," rather than go
out and kill them in the armies
of the world.
"Time is so short: people are
hungry, people are dying," Miss
Baez said.
The money spent on war is
wasted, Harris said. The food
people need "is raining down on
their heads" as bombs.
Vietnamese Child
Citing a picture of a severely
burned Vietnamese child, Miss
Baez said, "Something is stand
ing between decency and that
child, and we are part of that
something," by failing to take
action.

Harris emphasized that action
by saying "I can find in my
humble search no more honor
able role than that of a crim
inal," a draft resistor.
The clean shaven Harris wore
a three-piece suit, a contrast to
his blue work shirt, jeans, and
long sideburns, his mode of dress
long familiar to Stanford stu
dents.
Basic Assumptions
Harris claimed that the draft
makes three basic assumptions.
"The first and most obvious is
that those lives (of draft-age
men) exist ... as tools of the
state."
The second in his opinion is
the draftee should be taught
fear. He urged the audience "to
refuse to make that fear the hub
of your existence."
The third assumption is that
"misery exists not because the
earth is barren, but because you
and I see these people (ekeing
out a living in poverty), as our
enemies."


COOLING IT — Serra Street is being torn up for the sake of cool comfort. A series of underground
pipes will provide "dust-free, germ-free, even-t ?mperatured air" for portions of five buildings now
under construction. It's all the comfort of the great outdoors.
