# Air Of Pessimism
## Napier Sets New Youth Goals 
### 
A tone of pessimism permeat
ed the words of Davie Napier,
Dean of the Chapel, Friday as
he called on man to outgrow his
stunted adolescence.
The speech was somewhat of a
turnabout for the man who last
year addressed a similar group
of incoming students as part of
the Pre-Reg program in Me
morial Auditorium and referred
to his optimism and faith in the
possibility of a meaningful exis
tence in the United States.
Napier's words put a cap on
the general mood of the speeches
of administrators and faculty
members during the week.
After briefly paying tribute to
the generally high level of in
telligence of Stanford's students,
Napier warned them not to be
proud of this gift. Instead, he
said, "We must sharpen our
minds to help humanity," â€” not
for the purpose of being able to
slide easily into the role of func
tionaries in a society.
He then decried the "impo
tence of the young to turn away
from . . . the past and to recog
nize greater human potential."
The most important task we

must set, he continued, is the
cultivation of sympathy and
compassion.
Napier cited four tragic ex
amples of a lack of sympathy in
our society: the war in Vietnam,
our system of economics, racism,
and the competitive structure of
the universities in this coun
try.
Kennedy Speaks
Napier was preceded on the
program by Dr. Donald Kennedy,
who spoke of the rapid changes
in the university and the result
ant "generation gap" lit has
caused.
Concerning this gap Kennedy,
a professor of neurophysiology,
cited the recognition of relevance
in education as being the most
distinguishing factor between
the old trends of educational
thought and today's.
Kennedy admitted that there
was a great deal of confusion
resulting form the internal ques
tioning of the function of the
university. He stated that "the
university is more of the world,
although it is not sure it ought
to be."

Of paramount importance is
the duty of the university to
recognize the various images
that society holds of it, and to
grapple with these images hon
estly. The university community
must then choose its direction
and course of action.
As an example, Kennedy noted
that the university must not
fall prey to the notion that it
should be a "service station" of
knowl >dge, catering to every pet
interest of the outside commu

nity. Those within the university
community have a definite obli
gation to preserve and contribute
to the existing fund of knowl
edge.
In conclusion, Kennedy pre
dicted resistance to the pressure
placed by the community on the
university, assumption of a
larger role in self-government by
the students, and shifting im
portance to the new production
of knowledge, not mere con
sumption.
