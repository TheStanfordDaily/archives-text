# Health Service Drops Free Hospitalization
## 
### PETER DOLINGER 
Hospitalization costs will not
be provided as part of the Stu
dent Health Service (SHS) at
Stanford this year.
Students must provide their
own hospitalization coverage,
either through their parents'
policy or through a policy offer
ed to Stanford students by the
Continental Casualty Company
of San Francisco.
The cost of this plan, which
provides year-round hospitali
zation coverage plus some acci
dent benefits, is $48 for single
students and $128 for students
with dependents.
•August Letter
In a letter mailed to all stu
dents in August, Dean of Stu
dents Joel Smith announced the
change.
No explanation was offered in
the letter, but in an interview
last week, Smith said that the
decision to cut hospitalization
from the University budget was
made by the vice-presidents of
the University, acting under
"tremendous pressure" to save
money in the 19G8-69 budget.
The reason for not adding hos
pitalization costs to tuition,
Smith added, was that many
Stanford students are covered
for hospitalization expenses by
their parents' policies. A tui
tion increase for hospitalization
costs would force these parents
to pay twice.

Eliminating hospitalization
from the SHS budget will save
about $150,000 a year on the Uni
versity's total operating expen
ses of $107 million (excluding
SLAC).
According to Smith, the deci
sion to cut back on some aspect
of the Student Health Service
was made last fall, when the
1968-69 budget was due. But the
final decision to drop hospitaliza
tion was not made until July 21,
when the issue was "vigorously
debated" in high levels of Uni
versity administration.
But the switch away from
hospitalization coverage may
not be a permanent one. Dr.
James B. McClenahan, Director
of SHS, said that the University
is not sure of how many stu
dents will need to buy the policy
offered by Continental Casualty.
General Plan?
"If many students have to buy
outside insurance, then it would
be more economical for each
student to be insured through
a general plan, i.e., tuition, since
that would save paying the in
surance company's administra
tive costs. If only a few students
buy the $48 plan, then we have
a philosophical argument of
whether the student body at
large should pay to cover those
who do not have or cannot afford
outside coverage," McClenahan
stated.
The decision to cut hospita'iza
tion rather than some other part

of SHS was partly based on an
estimate that 607< of Stanford
students are covered for hospi
talization elsewhere.
This estimate was baed on two
factors: a 19G6 study by Dr.
Maurice Osborne, former Di
rector of SHS, on married stu
dents, and the insurance com
pany's estimate, based on last
year's returns for the "supple
mental policy," which covered
between quarter and away from
the Stanford campus, Four
thousand students out of a pos
sible 11,000 bought the supple
mental policy.
Budget The Same
McClenahan said that even
though hospitalization was cut
from the SHS budget, rising
costs, salaries, and volume of
student health cases kept the
SHS budget at about what it was
last year.
Last spring there were 20,000
student visits to the Cowell
Health Center, of which 11,000
were "doctor visits" and 9,000
were immunizations or other
problems which could be hand
led by nurses. The two biggest
problems seen at Cowell have
been dermatology and orthope
dics, according to McClenahan.
In addition to the (30,000 cases
treated at Cowell per year, there
aiv about 1,500 referrals to the
Palo Alto Medical Clinic for
specialist treatment, special
tests, and X-rays. These refer
rals to the Clinic will still be
covered as part of SHS this year,
McClenahan added.
Frank Riddle, manager of re
ports and analysis in the Con
troller's Office, explained some
of the financial complexities the
University faces for student
health.
Budget Background
Last year's SHS budget totaled
$973,000. Of this, $93,000 was al
located for hospitalization ex
penses, but $150,000 was actually
paid. $145,000 was spent for sup
plies and salaries of the three
Stanford employees at Cowell:
the director, the director of psy
chiatry, and a physical therapist.
The remaining $735,000 was
the amount paid to the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic, a privately-own
ed, local medical corporation
which staffs and provides some
supplies to Cowell ($513,000) and
provides for specialist referrals
($233,000).
This year the cost of the Palo
Alto Medical Clinic contract rose
to $786,000, and other cost in
creases brought the SHS budget
to $969,000, without hospitaliza
tion coverage.
Dr. McClenahan explained that
this sort of arrangement with a
private organization for student
health services originated in the
days before the Stanford Medi
cal School was located in Palo
Alto, and remains "somewhat
unique" among the nation's uni
versities. Since the Medical
School relocated in Palo Alto, it
has not shown "any great inter
est in taking the burden of stu
dent health," but "this may be
changing," McClenahan added.

offered hospitalization facilities for short-term student invalids free.

James B. McClenahan, Director
of SHS, said that the University
is not sure of how many stu
dents will need to buy the policy
offered by Continental Casualty.
General Plan?
"If many students have to buy
outside insurance, then it would
be more economical for each
student to be insured through
a general plan, i.e., tuition, since
that would save paying the in
surance company's administra
tive costs. If only a few students
buy the $48 plan, then we have
a philosophical argument of
whether the student body at
large should pay to cover those
who do not have or cannot afford
outside coverage," McClenahan
stated.
The decision to cut hospita'iza
tion rather than some other part

of SHS was partly based on an
estimate that 607< of Stanford
students are covered for hospi
talization elsewhere.
This estimate was baed on two
factors: a 19G6 study by Dr.
Maurice Osborne, former Di
rector of SHS, on married stu
dents, and the insurance com
pany's estimate, based on last
year's returns for the "supple
mental policy," which covered
between quarter and away from
the Stanford campus, Four
thousand students out of a pos
sible 11,000 bought the supple
mental policy.
Budget The Same
McClenahan said that even
though hospitalization was cut
from the SHS budget, rising
costs, salaries, and volume of
student health cases kept the
SHS budget at about what it was
last year.
Last spring there were 20,000
student visits to the Cowell
Health Center, of which 11,000
were "doctor visits" and 9,000
were immunizations or other
problems which could be hand
led by nurses. The two biggest
problems seen at Cowell have
been dermatology and orthope
dics, according to McClenahan.
In addition to the (30,000 cases
treated at Cowell per year, there
aiv about 1,500 referrals to the
Palo Alto Medical Clinic for
specialist treatment, special
tests, and X-rays. These refer
rals to the Clinic will still be
covered as part of SHS this year,
McClenahan added.
Frank Riddle, manager of re
ports and analysis in the Con
troller's Office, explained some
of the financial complexities the
University faces for student
health.
Budget Background
Last year's SHS budget totaled
$973,000. Of this, $93,000 was al
located for hospitalization ex
penses, but $150,000 was actually
paid. $145,000 was spent for sup
plies and salaries of the three
Stanford employees at Cowell:
the director, the director of psy
chiatry, and a physical therapist.
The remaining $735,000 was
the amount paid to the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic, a privately-own
ed, local medical corporation
which staffs and provides some
supplies to Cowell ($513,000) and
provides for specialist referrals
($233,000).
This year the cost of the Palo
Alto Medical Clinic contract rose
to $786,000, and other cost in
creases brought the SHS budget
to $969,000, without hospitaliza
tion coverage.
Dr. McClenahan explained that
this sort of arrangement with a
private organization for student
health services originated in the
days before the Stanford Medi
cal School was located in Palo
Alto, and remains "somewhat
unique" among the nation's uni
versities. Since the Medical
School relocated in Palo Alto, it
has not shown "any great inter
est in taking the burden of stu
dent health," but "this may be
changing," McClenahan added.


HEALTH CENTER — The Cowell Student Health Center previously
offered hospitalization facilities for short-term student invalids free.
Now in an economy move, students will have to pay for this aspect
of the service, and the University is encouraging enrollment in a
hospital insurance plan.
Hospitalization costs will not
be provided as part of the Stu
dent Health Service (SHS) at
Stanford this year.
Students must provide their
own hospitalization coverage,
either through their parents'
policy or through a policy offer
ed to Stanford students by the
Continental Casualty Company
of San Francisco.
The cost of this plan, which
provides year-round hospitali

•August Letter
In a letter mailed to all stu

change.
No explanation was offered in
the letter, but in an interview
last week, Smith said that the

made by the vice-presidents of

The reason for not adding hos

Eliminating hospitalization
from the SHS budget will save
about $150,000 a year on the Uni

According to Smith, the deci

dics, according to McClenahan.
In addition to the (30,000 cases
treated at Cowell per year, there
aiv about 1,500 referrals to the
Palo Alto Medical Clinic for
specialist treatment, special
tests, and X-rays. These refer
rals to the Clinic will still be
covered as part of SHS this year,
McClenahan added.
Frank Riddle, manager of re
ports and analysis in the Con
troller's Office, explained some
of the financial complexities the
University faces for student
health.
Budget Background
Last year's SHS budget totaled
$973,000. Of this, $93,000 was al
located for hospitalization ex
penses, but $150,000 was actually
paid. $145,000 was spent for sup
plies and salaries of the three
Stanford employees at Cowell:
the director, the director of psy
chiatry, and a physical therapist.
The remaining $735,000 was
the amount paid to the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic, a privately-own
ed, local medical corporation
which staffs and provides some
supplies to Cowell ($513,000) and
provides for specialist referrals
($233,000).
This year the cost of the Palo
Alto Medical Clinic contract rose
to $786,000, and other cost in
creases brought the SHS budget
to $969,000, without hospitaliza
tion coverage.
Dr. McClenahan explained that
this sort of arrangement with a
private organization for student
health services originated in the
days before the Stanford Medi
cal School was located in Palo
Alto, and remains "somewhat
unique" among the nation's uni
versities. Since the Medical
School relocated in Palo Alto, it
has not shown "any great inter
est in taking the burden of stu
dent health," but "this may be
changing," McClenahan added.


HEALTH CENTER — The Cowell Student Health Center previously
offered hospitalization facilities for short-term student invalids free.
Now in an economy move, students will have to pay for this aspect
of the service, and the University is encouraging enrollment in a
hospital insurance plan.
Hospitalization costs will not
be provided as part of the Stu
dent Health Service (SHS) at
Stanford this year.
Students must provide their
own hospitalization coverage,
either through their parents'
policy or through a policy offer
ed to Stanford students by the
Continental Casualty Company
of San Francisco.
The cost of this plan, which
provides year-round hospitali
zation coverage plus some acci
dent benefits, is $48 for single
students and $128 for students
with dependents.
•August Letter
In a letter mailed to all stu
dents in August, Dean of Stu
dents Joel Smith announced the
change.
No explanation was offered in
the letter, but in an interview
last week, Smith said that the
decision to cut hospitalization
from the University budget was
made by the vice-presidents of
the University, acting under
"tremendous pressure" to save
money in the 19G8-69 budget.
The reason for not adding hos
pitalization costs to tuition,
Smith added, was that many
Stanford students are covered
for hospitalization expenses by
their parents' policies. A tui
tion increase for hospitalization
costs would force these parents
to pay twice.

Eliminating hospitalization
from the SHS budget will save
about $150,000 a year on the Uni
versity's total operating expen
ses of $107 million (excluding
SLAC).
According to Smith, the deci
sion to cut back on some aspect
of the Student Health Service
was made last fall, when the
1968-69 budget was due. But the
final decision to drop hospitaliza
tion was not made until July 21,
when the issue was "vigorously
debated" in high levels of Uni
versity administration.
But the switch away from
hospitalization coverage may
not be a permanent one. Dr.
James B. McClenahan, Director
of SHS, said that the University
is not sure of how many stu
dents will need to buy the policy
offered by Continental Casualty.
General Plan?
"If many students have to buy
outside insurance, then it would
be more economical for each
student to be insured through
a general plan, i.e., tuition, since
that would save paying the in
surance company's administra
tive costs. If only a few students
buy the $48 plan, then we have
a philosophical argument of
whether the student body at
large should pay to cover those
who do not have or cannot afford
outside coverage," McClenahan
stated.
The decision to cut hospita'iza
tion rather than some other part

of SHS was partly based on an
estimate that 607< of Stanford
students are covered for hospi
talization elsewhere.
This estimate was baed on two
factors: a 19G6 study by Dr.
Maurice Osborne, former Di
rector of SHS, on married stu
dents, and the insurance com
pany's estimate, based on last
year's returns for the "supple
mental policy," which covered
between quarter and away from
the Stanford campus, Four
thousand students out of a pos
sible 11,000 bought the supple
mental policy.
Budget The Same
McClenahan said that even
though hospitalization was cut
from the SHS budget, rising
costs, salaries, and volume of
student health cases kept the
SHS budget at about what it was
last year.
Last spring there were 20,000
student visits to the Cowell
Health Center, of which 11,000
were "doctor visits" and 9,000
were immunizations or other
problems which could be hand
led by nurses. The two biggest
problems seen at Cowell have
been dermatology and orthope
dics, according to McClenahan.
In addition to the (30,000 cases
treated at Cowell per year, there
aiv about 1,500 referrals to the
