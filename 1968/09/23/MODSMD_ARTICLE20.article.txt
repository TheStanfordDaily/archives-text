# Plunkett Fires 4 TD Passes
## Indians Slaughter San Jose, 68-20 
### GARY CAVALLI 
The well-oiled Stanford foot
ball machine, with poised Jim
Plunkett at the controls, ground
an outclassed San Jose State
eleven into the dust Saturday af
ternoon 68-20.
The Spartans resembled Cus
ter's forces at the Little Big
Horn, as they were unable to
cope with the Indians' massive
offensive.
Stanford's 68 points was the
.second highest total ever re
corded by a Cardinal football
team. In 1923 the Tribe annihi
lated Mare Island 82-0, and two
years later equaled that effort

with another 82-0 debacle, this
time making UCLA the victims.
Touchdown Tandem
The wizardry of Plunkett and
his lightning-fast battery mate
Gene Washington proved too
much for the hapless San Jose
eleven. Plunkett connected on 10
of 13 passes for 277 yards and
four touchdowns. Three of the
scoring aerials went to Washing
ton, who hauled in six-point
strikes of 10, 51 and 79 yards.
Plunkett's impressive debut
performance was no doubt the
highlight of the afternoon (he
was voted "Back of the Game"),
but no less than 10 Indians took

part in the scoring.
Jack Lasater was on the re
ceiving end of the fourth Plun
kett TD pass, while the Tribe
signal-caller himself plunged one
yard for a second quarter tally.
Reserves Romp
Third-string quarterback Ron
Fujikawa threw for a touch
down on his first passing at
tempt, hitting sophmore tight
end Ron Kadziel from 11 yards
out. With a little less than two
minutes left to play Fujikawa
teamed with fullback Jack Alus
tiza on a 63-yard screen pass
which set up the final Tribe tal
ly, a one-yard dive by Jon Huss.

Starting fullback Greg
Broughton, sophomore halfback
Jack Schultz, and third-string
fullback Tim Abena also romped
for Tribe touchdowns.
Broughton got the Indians on
the scoreboard after only three
and-a-half minutes had elapsed
with a 21-yard jaunt, while
Schultz (16 yards) and Abena
(34 yards) weaved their way to
third-quarter scores.
Stanford place-kicker Bill
Shoemaker converted 5 straight
extra points before a serious
knee injury forced him to the
sidelines. Steve Horowitz booted
three of five PAT tries after

taking over the kicking chores.
Outside of tailback Walt
Shockley, San Jose, didn't show
very much offensively. The
Spartans couldn't manage a first
down until 12:39 of the second
stanza, and scored two of their
three touchdowns against sec
ond and third-string Tribe de
fenders.
Shockley carried the ball 14
times for 82 yards, including a
brilliant 39-yard TD scamper,
and caught four passes good for
70 yards.
San Jose State 0 7 6 7—20
Stanford 21 14 19 14—68

SCORING BOMB — Stanford flanker Gene Washington (18) hauls in a perfectly-tlirown bomb from
Jim Plunkett and heads for paydirt, as San Jose defender Terry Hostek gives chase. The scoring
play, which covered 51 yards, was the first of two fine over-the-shoulder catches Washington made
after leaving the Spartan secondary clutching at his heels. The second was a 79-yard TD strike.
