# Grid Notes
## Shoemaker Faces Surgery 
### 
Most football coaches would
be ecstatic after a 68-20 opening
game victory, but Tribe mentor
John Ralston was pondering
problems rather than praise in
the wake of Stanford's awesome
win Saturday.
"There are problems, lots of
problems," Ralston commented
Sunday morning. "There were
several pluses, but we've got a
few things to work on-," he add
ed.
Ralston's primary concern will
be replacing linebacker-place
kicker Bill Shoemaker, who was
injured In Saturday's encounter
and may be lost for the season.
Shoemaker had to he helped
off the field early in the third
quarter after tearing ligaments
in his left knee. Ralston con
firmed that Shoemaker would
undergo surgery on the knee
sometime today.
Ralston also expressed dissat
isfaction over the performance
of his running backs. Despite
the fact that Bubba Brown,
Howie Williams and Jack

Schultz averaged seven yards
per carry, Ralston felt they
coul have* gotten much more,
since the offensive line was do
ing such a great job.
Whistle-Happy Fan
Part of the problem may have
been a San Jose State fan, seat
ed in the vicinity of the press
box, who blew a loud whistle at
the beginning of every Stanford
running play.
On three or four occasions the
Indians backs would seem to
stumble or hesitate when this
whistle blew, possibly mistaking
it for the official's whistle.
New Rule Slows Play
"That had to be the longest
game in history," assistant
coach Jack White commented
after Saturday's 3 hour and 15
minute contest. A new rule
which calls for stoppage of the
clock after every first down was
the prime factor in delaying
play.
The rule was designed to help
a team driving for a touchdown
in the closing minutes of play.

Instead of having to throw an
incomplete pass to stop the
clock, the team can now go for
a first down and not have to
waste a down on throwing the
incompletions.
The rule had no effect in Sat
urday's game, however, except
to make it abnormally long. To
the hapless San Jose eleven, it
seemed to last 3 years instead
of 3 hours and 15 minutes.
Top Linemen
Middle linebacker Don Parish,
who made 12 tackles and seemed
to be all over the field Saturday,
was voted the game's outstand
ing lineman. Linebackers Andy
Carrigan and Tim McClure, nei
ther of whom started the game,
topped Stanford defenders with
13 tackles.
The Tribe defense made it a
rough afternoon for Spartan
quarterback Russ Munson. Mun
son, brother of Detroit Lions'
signal-caller Bill Munson, was
under heavy pressure all day
and was dropped four times for
a loss of 13 yards.
Stanford gained an incredible
668 yards in Saturday's game.
Most of the credit should go to
the offensive line of tackles Mai
Snider and Pete Seymour, cen
ter John Sande, and guards
George Crooks, Pete Messer and
Bob Reinhard. They provided
great protection for quarterback
Jim Plunkett and opened gaping
holes for the Tribe running
backs.

Most of the credit should go to
the offensive line of tackles Mai
Snider and Pete Seymour, cen
ter John Sande, and guards
George Crooks, Pete Messer and
Bob Reinhard. They provided
great protection for quarterback
Jim Plunkett and opened gaping
holes for the Tribe running
backs.
Most football coaches would
be ecstatic after a 68-20 opening
game victory, but Tribe mentor
John Ralston was pondering
problems rather than praise in
the wake of Stanford's awesome
win Saturday.
"There are problems, lots of
problems," Ralston commented
Sunday morning. "There were
several pluses, but we've got a
few things to work on-," he add
ed.
Ralston's primary concern will
be replacing linebacker-place
kicker Bill Shoemaker, who was
injured In Saturday's encounter
and may be lost for the season.
Shoemaker had to he helped
off the field early in the third
quarter after tearing ligaments
in his left knee. Ralston con
firmed that Shoemaker would
undergo surgery on the knee
sometime today.
Ralston also expressed dissat
isfaction over the performance
of his running backs. Despite
the fact that Bubba Brown,
Howie Williams and Jack

Schultz averaged seven yards
per carry, Ralston felt they
coul have* gotten much more,
since the offensive line was do
ing such a great job.
Whistle-Happy Fan
Part of the problem may have
been a San Jose State fan, seat
ed in the vicinity of the press
box, who blew a loud whistle at
the beginning of every Stanford
running play.
On three or four occasions the
Indians backs would seem to
stumble or hesitate when this
whistle blew, possibly mistaking
it for the official's whistle.
New Rule Slows Play
"That had to be the longest
game in history," assistant
coach Jack White commented
after Saturday's 3 hour and 15
minute contest. A new rule
which calls for stoppage of the
clock after every first down was
the prime factor in delaying
play.
The rule was designed to help
a team driving for a touchdown
in the closing minutes of play.

Instead of having to throw an
incomplete pass to stop the
clock, the team can now go for
a first down and not have to
waste a down on throwing the
incompletions.
The rule had no effect in Sat
urday's game, however, except
to make it abnormally long. To
the hapless San Jose eleven, it
seemed to last 3 years instead
of 3 hours and 15 minutes.
Top Linemen
Middle linebacker Don Parish,
who made 12 tackles and seemed
to be all over the field Saturday,
was voted the game's outstand
ing lineman. Linebackers Andy
Carrigan and Tim McClure, nei
ther of whom started the game,
topped Stanford defenders with
13 tackles.
The Tribe defense made it a
rough afternoon for Spartan
quarterback Russ Munson. Mun
son, brother of Detroit Lions'
signal-caller Bill Munson, was
under heavy pressure all day
and was dropped four times for
a loss of 13 yards.
Stanford gained an incredible
668 yards in Saturday's game.
