# Glaser, TA Union Meet To End Housing Crisis
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
Acting President Robert Gla
ser met Saturday with leaders
of the graduate student union in
an effort to avoid a severe hous
ing shortage at Stanford. The
crisis, one that Stanford faces
every fall, is aggravated this
year by the combination of 3,000
incoming transfer and graduate
students and an unusually large
freshman class.
Glaser announced he was pre
pared to order immediately 15
house trailers with room for 90
to 120 students and re-open part
of Stanford Village, currently
scheduled to be razed if the situ
ation warranted such action.
However, since neither Glaser
nor secretary Ed Nelson of the
graduate union, American Fed
eration of Teachers (AFT), had
an accurate estimate of the
number students needing hous
ing, they agreed to distribute a
questionaire during registration
today and tomorrow to discover
precisely student housing needs.
The meeting resulted from
recommendations submitted to
Glaser last Tuesday by the grad
uate union:
• The University should des
ignate top priority for low in
come housing on Stanford land.
• The University should use
its influence on the city of Palo
Alto to build low cost housing
on the site of the old corpora
tion yards currently leased by
the city.
• The University should be
willing to obtain leaser on mo
tels to house students until
enough housing is available.
• The University should dis
cuss with the AFT plans for low
cost housing that would be
ready by January 1, 1969.
• The University should be
gin plans for a community on
campus that would integrate
teachers, students, and staff em
ployees.
Last Year
The discussion turned at once,
however, towards immediate

housing solutions in an attempt
to avoid repetition of last year's
problems. During registration
week last fall there long lines of
homeless students at the Palo
Alto Times office waiting for the
first edition containing classified
housing ads to roll off the press
es. Many students were forced
by the pressures of the shortage
to settle for rooms far from
campus and to pay inflated
prices. Others found themselves
forced to pitch tents on lawns
around campus or to live in
Frost Amphitheatre.
Glaser declared that the 15
trailers could be ready within
two weeks. They would be lo
cated in the fields between Cam
pus Drive, Escondid Road, and
Escondido Village. Rent in one
of the eight-man trailers would
be $26 per month when unfur
nished, but substantially more
with furniture provided. The
trailers, however, contain no
cooking facilities; moreover, the
living arrangements would be
suitable only for single stu
dents.
Stanford Village appears pres
ently to be the other alternative.
There are 80 units available
which could be used by married
students. However, the Village
is slated to be torn down, mak
ing way for the expanding Stan
ford Research Institute (SRI).
Glaser said that he had consult
ed with SRI oilicials, who felt
that any conflicts between the
building program and the emer
gency rooming program could
be worked out.
Commenting on the five AFT
recommendations, Glaser recog
nized a need for low income
housing in the Palo Alto area
for young faculty members,
University staff, and local indus
trial workers from outside the
Stanford community as well as
for off-campus students. Nelson
described these people as ones
"who do a lot but generally
aren't considered."
Housing Committee
Glaser said that next week he
will appoint a committee com
posed of AFT representatives
and other groups directly inter
ested in low income housing to
study the problem and suggest
solutions.
Nelson said he felt "the sense
of the meeting was that they
definitely committed themselves
as soon as they can." He stated
that the University will be able
to act on the trailers by Tues
day, and also that he and Gla
ser agreed "it would be better to
err and bring up too many than
too few ... It was a very good
start, but it obviously isn't
solved."
The subject of the Palo Alto

municipal corporation yards was
also discussed. Stanford leased
the land to the city; now the
city is in the process of sub
leasing these yards after mov
ing to new ones.
Nelson said that one of the
proposals before the city in
volved tearing down the old ga
rages and sheds on the land and
building low income housings.
He asked that the University use
its influence to assure that the
proposal be accepted. Glaser
said that the decision was up to
the city, but he felt that the
land ought to be used as the
AFT suggested.
SES Report
The problem of housing un
derwent extensive examination
last spring, and has thus far re
sulted in several long-range pro
posals. The Committees on Resi
dence Programs and Policies
under the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) submitted a re
port to its Steering Committee.
Among the recommendations of
the report, which was issued on
June 5, 1968, were:
• ". . . the University should
make increased efforts toward
providing enough residences that

all undergraduates who wish
can live on campus . .
• . . . to provide opportuni
ty .. . for undergraduate trans
fer students to live in University
residences."
Recognizing the need for in
creased on-campus housing, the
administration is now taking
steps to set aside $7 million for
the construction of University
residences. Edward Seoles, the



NO VACANCY — Many returning students and transfers were faced with signs apart
ment buildings throughout the area. Over the weekend some members of the University administration
met with TA union leaders to consider what might be done about the possible crisis. Meanwhile stu
dents continued to use the housing clearinghouse in Stern , now moved into the pavilion for
registration, to find housing.
Assistant Business Manager for
University Housing disclosed
that the Department of Hou"'""
and Urban Development had .p
-proved a preliminary application
for a $2 million dollar loan, and
was in the process of consider
ing a final one.
This money would be usnd for
an extension of Escondido Vil
lage, and would consist of one
high rise building and five two
story structures that would
house 310 single undergradu
ates. Scoles indicated that if the
loan were approved, construc
tion would begin in April of
1969.
There is also a $5 million gift
fund at the disposal of the new
housing projects, but Scoles em
phasized that there would be a
minimum of two vears before
construction could begin on
these residences. "We don't
know what kind of residence
halls the students want yet.
Therefore, we will be looking
for a concensus among groups
like the SES and the Stutdent
Senatn during the course of the
year."

SES Report
The problem of housing un
derwent extensive examination
last spring, and has thus far re
sulted in several long-range pro
posals. The Committees on Resi
dence Programs and Policies
under the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) submitted a re
port to its Steering Committee.
Among the recommendations of
the report, which was issued on
June 5, 1968, were:
• ". . . the University should
make increased efforts toward
providing enough residences that

all undergraduates who wish
can live on campus . .
• . . . to provide opportuni
ty .. . for undergraduate trans
fer students to live in University
residences."
Recognizing the need for in
creased on-campus housing, the
administration is now taking
steps to set aside $7 million for
the construction of University
residences. Edward Seoles, the



NO VACANCY — Many returning students and transfers were faced with signs apart
ment buildings throughout the area. Over the weekend some members of the University administration
met with TA union leaders to consider what might be done about the possible crisis. Meanwhile stu
dents continued to use the housing clearinghouse in Stern , now moved into the pavilion for
registration, to find housing.
Assistant Business Manager for
University Housing disclosed
that the Department of Hou"'""
and Urban Development had .p
-proved a preliminary application
for a $2 million dollar loan, and
was in the process of consider
ing a final one.
This money would be usnd for
an extension of Escondido Vil
lage, and would consist of one
high rise building and five two
story structures that would
house 310 single undergradu
ates. Scoles indicated that if the
loan were approved, construc
tion would begin in April of
1969.
There is also a $5 million gift
fund at the disposal of the new
housing projects, but Scoles em
phasized that there would be a
minimum of two vears before
construction could begin on
these residences. "We don't
know what kind of residence
halls the students want yet.
Therefore, we will be looking
for a concensus among groups
like the SES and the Stutdent
Senatn during the course of the
year."
Acting President Robert Gla
ser met Saturday with leaders
of the graduate student union in
an effort to avoid a severe hous
ing shortage at Stanford. The
crisis, one that Stanford faces
every fall, is aggravated this
year by the combination of 3,000
incoming transfer and graduate
students and an unusually large
freshman class.
Glaser announced he was pre
pared to order immediately 15
house trailers with room for 90
to 120 students and re-open part
of Stanford Village, currently
scheduled to be razed if the situ
ation warranted such action.
However, since neither Glaser
nor secretary Ed Nelson of the
graduate union, American Fed
eration of Teachers (AFT), had
an accurate estimate of the
number students needing hous
ing, they agreed to distribute a
questionaire during registration
today and tomorrow to discover
precisely student housing needs.
The meeting resulted from
recommendations submitted to
Glaser last Tuesday by the grad
uate union:
• The University should des
ignate top priority for low in
come housing on Stanford land.
• The University should use
its influence on the city of Palo
Alto to build low cost housing
on the site of the old corpora
tion yards currently leased by
the city.
• The University should be
willing to obtain leaser on mo
tels to house students until
enough housing is available.
• The University should dis
cuss with the AFT plans for low
cost housing that would be
ready by January 1, 1969.
• The University should be
gin plans for a community on
campus that would integrate
teachers, students, and staff em
ployees.
Last Year
The discussion turned at once,
however, towards immediate

housing solutions in an attempt
to avoid repetition of last year's
problems. During registration
week last fall there long lines of
homeless students at the Palo
Alto Times office waiting for the
first edition containing classified
housing ads to roll off the press
es. Many students were forced
by the pressures of the shortage
to settle for rooms far from
campus and to pay inflated
prices. Others found themselves
forced to pitch tents on lawns
around campus or to live in
Frost Amphitheatre.
Glaser declared that the 15
trailers could be ready within
two weeks. They would be lo
cated in the fields between Cam
pus Drive, Escondid Road, and
Escondido Village. Rent in one
of the eight-man trailers would
be $26 per month when unfur
nished, but substantially more
with furniture provided. The
trailers, however, contain no
cooking facilities; moreover, the
living arrangements would be
suitable only for single stu
dents.
Stanford Village appears pres
ently to be the other alternative.
There are 80 units available
which could be used by married
students. However, the Village
is slated to be torn down, mak
ing way for the expanding Stan
ford Research Institute (SRI).
Glaser said that he had consult
ed with SRI oilicials, who felt
that any conflicts between the
building program and the emer
gency rooming program could
be worked out.
Commenting on the five AFT
recommendations, Glaser recog
nized a need for low income
housing in the Palo Alto area
for young faculty members,
University staff, and local indus
trial workers from outside the
Stanford community as well as
for off-campus students. Nelson
described these people as ones
"who do a lot but generally
aren't considered."
Housing Committee
Glaser said that next week he
will appoint a committee com
posed of AFT representatives
and other groups directly inter
ested in low income housing to
study the problem and suggest
solutions.
Nelson said he felt "the sense
of the meeting was that they
definitely committed themselves
as soon as they can." He stated
that the University will be able
to act on the trailers by Tues
day, and also that he and Gla
ser agreed "it would be better to
err and bring up too many than
too few ... It was a very good
start, but it obviously isn't
solved."
The subject of the Palo Alto

municipal corporation yards was
also discussed. Stanford leased
the land to the city; now the
city is in the process of sub
leasing these yards after mov
ing to new ones.

Alto Times office waiting for the
first edition containing classified
housing ads to roll off the press
es. Many students were forced
by the pressures of the shortage
to settle for rooms far from
campus and to pay inflated
prices. Others found themselves
forced to pitch tents on lawns
around campus or to live in
Frost Amphitheatre.
Glaser declared that the 15
trailers could be ready within
two weeks. They would be lo
cated in the fields between Cam
pus Drive, Escondid Road, and
Escondido Village. Rent in one
of the eight-man trailers would
be $26 per month when unfur
nished, but substantially more
with furniture provided. The
trailers, however, contain no
cooking facilities; moreover, the
living arrangements would be
suitable only for single stu
dents.
Stanford Village appears pres
ently to be the other alternative.
There are 80 units available
which could be used by married
students. However, the Village
is slated to be torn down, mak
ing way for the expanding Stan
ford Research Institute (SRI).
Glaser said that he had consult
ed with SRI oilicials, who felt
that any conflicts between the
building program and the emer
gency rooming program could
be worked out.
Commenting on the five AFT
recommendations, Glaser recog
nized a need for low income
housing in the Palo Alto area
for young faculty members,
University staff, and local indus
trial workers from outside the
Stanford community as well as
for off-campus students. Nelson
described these people as ones
"who do a lot but generally
aren't considered."
Housing Committee
Glaser said that next week he
will appoint a committee com
posed of AFT representatives
and other groups directly inter
ested in low income housing to
study the problem and suggest
solutions.
Nelson said he felt "the sense
of the meeting was that they
definitely committed themselves
as soon as they can." He stated
that the University will be able
to act on the trailers by Tues
day, and also that he and Gla
ser agreed "it would be better to
err and bring up too many than
too few ... It was a very good
start, but it obviously isn't
solved."
The subject of the Palo Alto

municipal corporation yards was
also discussed. Stanford leased
the land to the city; now the
city is in the process of sub
leasing these yards after mov
ing to new ones.
Nelson said that one of the
proposals before the city in
volved tearing down the old ga
rages and sheds on the land and
building low income housings.
He asked that the University use
its influence to assure that the
proposal be accepted. Glaser
said that the decision was up to
the city, but he felt that the
land ought to be used as the
AFT suggested.
SES Report
The problem of housing un
derwent extensive examination
last spring, and has thus far re
sulted in several long-range pro
posals. The Committees on Resi
dence Programs and Policies
under the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) submitted a re
port to its Steering Committee.
Among the recommendations of
the report, which was issued on
June 5, 1968, were:
• ". . . the University should
make increased efforts toward
providing enough residences that

all undergraduates who wish
can live on campus . .
• . . . to provide opportuni
ty .. . for undergraduate trans
fer students to live in University
residences."
Recognizing the need for in
creased on-campus housing, the
administration is now taking
steps to set aside $7 million for
the construction of University
residences. Edward Seoles, the



NO VACANCY — Many returning students and transfers were faced with signs apart
ment buildings throughout the area. Over the weekend some members of the University administration
met with TA union leaders to consider what might be done about the possible crisis. Meanwhile stu
dents continued to use the housing clearinghouse in Stern , now moved into the pavilion for
registration, to find housing.
Assistant Business Manager for
University Housing disclosed
that the Department of Hou"'""
and Urban Development had .p
-proved a preliminary application
for a $2 million dollar loan, and
was in the process of consider
ing a final one.
This money would be usnd for
an extension of Escondido Vil
lage, and would consist of one
high rise building and five two
story structures that would
house 310 single undergradu
ates. Scoles indicated that if the
loan were approved, construc
tion would begin in April of
1969.
There is also a $5 million gift
fund at the disposal of the new
housing projects, but Scoles em
phasized that there would be a
minimum of two vears before
construction could begin on
these residences. "We don't
know what kind of residence
halls the students want yet.
Therefore, we will be looking
for a concensus among groups
like the SES and the Stutdent
Senatn during the course of the
year."
Acting President Robert Gla
ser met Saturday with leaders
of the graduate student union in
an effort to avoid a severe hous
ing shortage at Stanford. The
crisis, one that Stanford faces
every fall, is aggravated this
year by the combination of 3,000
incoming transfer and graduate
students and an unusually large
freshman class.
Glaser announced he was pre
pared to order immediately 15
house trailers with room for 90
to 120 students and re-open part
of Stanford Village, currently
scheduled to be razed if the situ
ation warranted such action.
However, since neither Glaser
nor secretary Ed Nelson of the
graduate union, American Fed
eration of Teachers (AFT), had
an accurate estimate of the
number students needing hous
ing, they agreed to distribute a
questionaire during registration
today and tomorrow to discover
precisely student housing needs.
The meeting resulted from
recommendations submitted to
Glaser last Tuesday by the grad
uate union:
• The University should des
ignate top priority for low in
come housing on Stanford land.
• The University should use
its influence on the city of Palo
Alto to build low cost housing
on the site of the old corpora
tion yards currently leased by
the city.
• The University should be
willing to obtain leaser on mo
tels to house students until
enough housing is available.
• The University should dis
cuss with the AFT plans for low
cost housing that would be
ready by January 1, 1969.
• The University should be
gin plans for a community on
campus that would integrate
teachers, students, and staff em

house 310 single undergradu
ates. Scoles indicated that if the
loan were approved, construc
tion would begin in April of
1969.
There is also a $5 million gift
fund at the disposal of the new
housing projects, but Scoles em
phasized that there would be a
minimum of two vears before
construction could begin on
these residences. "We don't
know what kind of residence
halls the students want yet.
Therefore, we will be looking
for a concensus among groups
like the SES and the Stutdent
Senatn during the course of the
year."
