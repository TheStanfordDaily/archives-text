# Ten Profs Blast ROTC
## 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
Ten members of the faculty
have placed before the Academic
Senate a proposal to eliminate
academic credit for Reserve Of
ficer Training Corps (ROTC)
courses. The proposal will be
voted on Thursday.
The proposal if accepted
would abolish credit for ROTC
courses entering freshmen. Any
student currently in the ROTC
program would continue to re
ceive regular academic credit
until he graduates.
ROTC courses are attacked on
three grounds:
• "certain features of the mili
tary science programs are unde
sirable because they compromise
the academic integrity of Stan
ford's degrees.
• "they compromise the aca
demic integrity of the faculty at
Stanford.
• "they are incompatable with
the university's commitment to
encourage the free intellectual
development of all students."
The proposal, written by Jo
seph Sneed, assistant professor
of philosophy, Anne Kostelanetz,
assistant professor of English,
John Goheen, professor of phi
losophy, and Bradley Efron, as
sociate professor of statistics,
states that certain of the courses
now taught by ROTC instruc
tors can be better taught by
various other academic depart
ments.
In History
Miss Kostelanetz cited as an
example courses in military his
tory, which are currently taught
by Army officers. She claims
that the current instructors are
not able "to teach history as an
academic discipline," which
should be a part of the instruc
tion in history courses, or any
other course.
The proposal states that new
ROTC courses "shall be open to
all students, subject only to pre
requisite and registration re
strictions the department con

cerned may elect to require. In
particular, participation in any
part of these courses shall not
be confined to those students
cleared to receive 'classified in
formation. . . . ' " Presently not
all ROTC courses are open to
all students.
Tuxts, Grading
The authors of the proposal
also object to the texts and the
manner of grading. "There is
some indication that this mate
rial (in the texts) does not pre
sent a significant intellectual
challenge to Stanford stutdents.
Administrators concerned with
these programs admit that stu
dents seldom receive less than a
'B' in military science courses."
Col. Robert C. Thomas, execu
tive head of naval science, stated
that he has taught and sat in on
ROTC courses, and has taken
courses in other departments of
the University, and that ROTC
courses "are on a comparable
level with any other courses
taught at the university."
However, one of the non-
ROTC students who took a mili
tary science course last fall,
claimed that the course was not
taught at a level comparable to
courses in the rest of the uni
versity.
Methodical
Daniel Berstein, who took
Military Science 11, the first
ROTC course, stated that it was
"methodically taught," and "im
possible to fail." He claimed that
one student in his class received
a grade on the objective-type fi
nal less than he would have re
ceived if he had guessed and
still received a "B".
Bernstein also said that there
was almost no homework and
the two exams covered only 40
pages of text apiece. He also
said that the only film they saw
"would not be acceptable in a
history class," because of its his
torical distortions.
He revealed that he had spent
much time the previous year

trying to obtain permission to
enter the course, "a year of
dealing with a reluctant admin
istration and a stubborn army."
The university finally received
permission from the army to
open the courses to a limited
number of "guests." Bernstein
received a "B" in the course.
The proposition before the
Academic Senate also objects to
the fashion in which the instruc
tors are chosen. It disapproves

of the way instructors are nomi
nated by the military, and then
approved by the administration.
"This violates the principle that
the primary responsibility in
making faculty appointments
lies with the faculty."
The proposal also objects to
what it considers to be the uni
versity's policy more actively to
encourage students to take part
in ROTC programs than in oth
er University programs.
It cites as its example the
booklet "ROTC at Stanford,"
distributed to all freshmen men.
The booklet includes a message
from President Sterling closing
with "This leaflet . . . invites
you to send for further detailed
information, if you are interest
ed, as I hope you will be."
Miss Kostelanetz says she
considers the prospects for pas
sage of the proposal fairly good.
If the proposal is accepted by
the 53-man Academic Senate, it
would be considered a extremely
strong recommendation for aca
demic policy to the administra
tion and the Board of Trustees.
Such faculty recommendations
are rarely rejected.

the University, and that ROTC
courses "are on a comparable
level with any other courses
taught at the university."
However, one of the non-
ROTC students who took a mili
tary science course last fall,
claimed that the course was not
taught at a level comparable to
courses in the rest of the uni
versity.
Methodical
Daniel Berstein, who took
Military Science 11, the first
ROTC course, stated that it was
"methodically taught," and "im
possible to fail." He claimed that
one student in his class received
a grade on the objective-type fi
nal less than he would have re
ceived if he had guessed and
still received a "B".
Bernstein also said that there
was almost no homework and
the two exams covered only 40
pages of text apiece. He also
said that the only film they saw
"would not be acceptable in a
history class," because of its his
torical distortions.
He revealed that he had spent
much time the previous year

trying to obtain permission to
enter the course, "a year of
dealing with a reluctant admin
istration and a stubborn army."
The university finally received
permission from the army to
open the courses to a limited
number of "guests." Bernstein
received a "B" in the course.
The proposition before the
Academic Senate also objects to
the fashion in which the instruc
tors are chosen. It disapproves

of the way instructors are nomi
nated by the military, and then
approved by the administration.
"This violates the principle that
the primary responsibility in
making faculty appointments
lies with the faculty."
The proposal also objects to
what it considers to be the uni
versity's policy more actively to
encourage students to take part
in ROTC programs than in oth
er University programs.
It cites as its example the
booklet "ROTC at Stanford,"
distributed to all freshmen men.
The booklet includes a message
from President Sterling closing
with "This leaflet . . . invites
you to send for further detailed
information, if you are interest
ed, as I hope you will be."
Miss Kostelanetz says she
considers the prospects for pas
sage of the proposal fairly good.
If the proposal is accepted by
the 53-man Academic Senate, it
would be considered a extremely
strong recommendation for aca
demic policy to the administra
tion and the Board of Trustees.
Such faculty recommendations
are rarely rejected.
Ten members of the faculty
have placed before the Academic
Senate a proposal to eliminate
academic credit for Reserve Of
ficer Training Corps (ROTC)
courses. The proposal will be
voted on Thursday.
The proposal if accepted
would abolish credit for ROTC
courses entering freshmen. Any
student currently in the ROTC
program would continue to re
ceive regular academic credit
until he graduates.
ROTC courses are attacked on
three grounds:
• "certain features of the mili
tary science programs are unde
sirable because they compromise
the academic integrity of Stan
ford's degrees.
• "they compromise the aca
demic integrity of the faculty at
Stanford.
• "they are incompatable with
the university's commitment to
encourage the free intellectual
development of all students."
The proposal, written by Jo
seph Sneed, assistant professor
of philosophy, Anne Kostelanetz,
assistant professor of English,
John Goheen, professor of phi
losophy, and Bradley Efron, as
sociate professor of statistics,
states that certain of the courses
now taught by ROTC instruc
tors can be better taught by
various other academic depart
ments.
In History
Miss Kostelanetz cited as an
example courses in military his
tory, which are currently taught
by Army officers. She claims
that the current instructors are
not able "to teach history as an
academic discipline," which
should be a part of the instruc
tion in history courses, or any
other course.
The proposal states that new
ROTC courses "shall be open to
all students, subject only to pre
requisite and registration re
strictions the department con

cerned may elect to require. In
particular, participation in any
part of these courses shall not
be confined to those students
cleared to receive 'classified in
formation. . . . ' " Presently not
all ROTC courses are open to
all students.
Tuxts, Grading
The authors of the proposal
also object to the texts and the
manner of grading. "There is
some indication that this mate
rial (in the texts) does not pre
sent a significant intellectual
challenge to Stanford stutdents.
Administrators concerned with
these programs admit that stu
dents seldom receive less than a
'B' in military science courses."

have placed before the Academic
Senate a proposal to eliminate
academic credit for Reserve Of
ficer Training Corps (ROTC)
courses. The proposal will be
voted on Thursday.
The proposal if accepted
would abolish credit for ROTC
courses entering freshmen. Any
student currently in the ROTC
program would continue to re
ceive regular academic credit
until he graduates.
ROTC courses are attacked on
three grounds:
• "certain features of the mili
tary science programs are unde
sirable because they compromise
the academic integrity of Stan
ford's degrees.
• "they compromise the aca
demic integrity of the faculty at
Stanford.
• "they are incompatable with
the university's commitment to
encourage the free intellectual
development of all students."
The proposal, written by Jo
seph Sneed, assistant professor
of philosophy, Anne Kostelanetz,
assistant professor of English,
John Goheen, professor of phi
losophy, and Bradley Efron, as
sociate professor of statistics,
states that certain of the courses
now taught by ROTC instruc
tors can be better taught by
various other academic depart
ments.
In History
Miss Kostelanetz cited as an
example courses in military his
tory, which are currently taught
by Army officers. She claims
that the current instructors are
not able "to teach history as an
academic discipline," which
should be a part of the instruc
tion in history courses, or any
other course.
The proposal states that new
ROTC courses "shall be open to
all students, subject only to pre
requisite and registration re
strictions the department con

cerned may elect to require. In
particular, participation in any
part of these courses shall not
be confined to those students
cleared to receive 'classified in
formation. . . . ' " Presently not
all ROTC courses are open to
all students.
Tuxts, Grading
The authors of the proposal
also object to the texts and the
manner of grading. "There is
some indication that this mate
rial (in the texts) does not pre
sent a significant intellectual
challenge to Stanford stutdents.
Administrators concerned with
these programs admit that stu
dents seldom receive less than a
'B' in military science courses."
Col. Robert C. Thomas, execu
tive head of naval science, stated
that he has taught and sat in on
ROTC courses, and has taken
courses in other departments of
the University, and that ROTC
courses "are on a comparable
level with any other courses
taught at the university."
However, one of the non-
ROTC students who took a mili
tary science course last fall,
claimed that the course was not
taught at a level comparable to
courses in the rest of the uni
versity.
Methodical
Daniel Berstein, who took
Military Science 11, the first
ROTC course, stated that it was
"methodically taught," and "im
possible to fail." He claimed that
one student in his class received
a grade on the objective-type fi
nal less than he would have re
ceived if he had guessed and
still received a "B".
Bernstein also said that there
was almost no homework and
the two exams covered only 40
pages of text apiece. He also
said that the only film they saw
"would not be acceptable in a
history class," because of its his
torical distortions.
He revealed that he had spent
much time the previous year

trying to obtain permission to
enter the course, "a year of
dealing with a reluctant admin
istration and a stubborn army."
The university finally received
permission from the army to
open the courses to a limited
number of "guests." Bernstein
received a "B" in the course.
The proposition before the
Academic Senate also objects to
the fashion in which the instruc
tors are chosen. It disapproves

of the way instructors are nomi
nated by the military, and then
approved by the administration.
"This violates the principle that
the primary responsibility in
making faculty appointments
lies with the faculty."
The proposal also objects to
what it considers to be the uni
versity's policy more actively to
encourage students to take part
in ROTC programs than in oth
er University programs.
It cites as its example the
booklet "ROTC at Stanford,"
distributed to all freshmen men.
The booklet includes a message
from President Sterling closing
with "This leaflet . . . invites
you to send for further detailed
information, if you are interest
ed, as I hope you will be."
Miss Kostelanetz says she
considers the prospects for pas
sage of the proposal fairly good.
If the proposal is accepted by
the 53-man Academic Senate, it
would be considered a extremely
strong recommendation for aca
demic policy to the administra
tion and the Board of Trustees.
Such faculty recommendations
are rarely rejected.
