# Gardner Refuses To Take Partisan Campaign Role
## 
### 
John W. Gardner, head of the
Urban Coalition and a Stanford
trustee, has indicated that he
won't accept the Columbia Uni
versity presidency, will not en
dorse a U.S. presidential candi
date this year, and will not ac
cept a Cabinet post in the next
Administration.
In an interview last Thursday
for The Stanford Daily maga
zine which will appear in the
first issue, Gardner said that his
Coalition post "is a non-partisan
position and it would be difficult
to work with city officials" if he
endorsed a Presidential candi
date.
Gardner cited the deep per
sonal commitment of his new
staff to the Coalition and the im
portance he placed on the pro
gram aims as the reasons he
won't accept a Cabinet position
next winter.
Student Pride
The former Secretary of
Health, Education, and Welfare
discussed students and politics
and felt that students should:
• "have pride in what happen
ed." He praised the abolition of

the unit rule and the "opening
up" of the process by which
delegates are chosen.
• "stay in it and work for
local candidates."
• "set to the task of further
electoral reform." He said stu
dents, professors, law schools,
political science associations
ought to work toward "model
state legislatures. Most state
legislatures are a festival of con
flicts of interest," he said.
"American universities can be
indicted for its failure to tackle
urban problems and Stanford is
not clear on this indictment,"
Gardner asserted.
The cause of this failure he
said "is not ill will. Universities
are very ponderous and are insti
tutions which resist change."
Students vs. Trustees
Concerning the disregard by
Stanford trustees for student
participation in the selection
process of President - designate
Pitzer, Gardner said, "There is
very little in established custom
to say that the Stanford trus
tees were wrong, but you can
be reasonably certain than a stu
dent advisory committee will be
invo'ved in the next selection
process."
Gardner said that increased
communication between the
trustees and stud <nts and fac
ulty is essential. He did question
the value of students and fac
ulty involvement on the Board
of Trustees.
"If you get beyond communi
cation, you're in considerable
danger of eroding the President
and getting the trustee involved
in day-to-day decision-making."
