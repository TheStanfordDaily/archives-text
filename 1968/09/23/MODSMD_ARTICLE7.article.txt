## STATEMENT IN WHICH THE DAILY LASHES OUT AT FOES OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM, SOME OF THEM IN HIGH PLACES.... 
### 
Richard Daley's response to dissent in Chicago and the Califor
nia legislature's reaction to the prospect of Eldridge Cleaver lec
turing at Berkeley are, it seems to us, reflections of the same men
tality. Daley, the California lawmakers, and the people who sup
port them are of a mind to ignore opinions that they do not like.
And they are prepared to enforce their ignorance with the politi
cal and military means at their disposal.
Incursion on academic freedom by California's politicians is re
grettable in itself. But the reaction to Cleaver's appointment be
comes more ominous when seen as part of a swelling wave of at
tacks on freedom of expression—a wave that has already swept Dr.
Benjamin Spock into court, carried police into the streets of Wash
ington, Oakland and Chicago, and left facist graffiti on the walls
of the Mid-Peninsula Free University store in Menlo Park.
Lawrence Magid, the Center for Participant Education, and the
Board of Educational Development at Berkeley are to be com
mended their efforts to establish real academic freedom on that
campus. Unfortunately the University of California, like any pub
licly supported institution, is particularly vulnerable to political

harassment. It appears that in the future political interference will
he more frequent and more damaging to state college and univer
sity systems.
As intellectual freedom is increasingly stifled at places like Ber
keley, other institutions must be prepared to preserve some ves
tiges of vitality in this society. An investigative, experimental, criti
cal spark must be protected—some small light must continue to
burn in the approaching darkness.
This apocalyptic talk seems a bit far-fetched to us as we step out
into the pure, clean sunshine of Northern California. We would
like to believe that it is absurd. But when one considers the likeli
hood that George Wallace will receive 20 per cent of the vote this
November, when one contemplates the mass beatings and arrests
that accompany each major public demonstration of anti-war feel
ing, when one remembers that Congress has voted to deprive stu
dent dissenters of federally funded scholarships, the need to pro
tect academic freedom seems less remote.
The Committee for a New Democratic Politics, an outgrowth of
the Stanford McCarthy committee, has invited Eldridge Cleaver
to participate in a series of lectures at Stanford this fall. For several
reasons it is vital that Cleaver appear here.
It is not necessary to approve of Cleaver's viewpoint in order to
realize the value of listening to him.
He is an articulate spokesman for the new consciousness of the
black community. He embodies the confidence and sense of power
that will enable black people to construct their own environment
and determine their own destiny. Most important, Cleaver has
lived in the changing society of the streets. Reality has not been
interpreted for him by pudgy social scientists.
It is also important that Stanford assert the independence that
can be so easily restricted at a public institution like the University
of California. If private universities do not protect their freedom to
investigate unpopular ideas, then the chances are that no one will.

he more frequent and more damaging to state college and univer
sity systems.
As intellectual freedom is increasingly stifled at places like Ber
keley, other institutions must be prepared to preserve some ves
tiges of vitality in this society. An investigative, experimental, criti
cal spark must be protected—some small light must continue to
burn in the approaching darkness.
This apocalyptic talk seems a bit far-fetched to us as we step out
into the pure, clean sunshine of Northern California. We would
like to believe that it is absurd. But when one considers the likeli
hood that George Wallace will receive 20 per cent of the vote this
November, when one contemplates the mass beatings and arrests
that accompany each major public demonstration of anti-war feel
ing, when one remembers that Congress has voted to deprive stu
dent dissenters of federally funded scholarships, the need to pro
tect academic freedom seems less remote.
The Committee for a New Democratic Politics, an outgrowth of
the Stanford McCarthy committee, has invited Eldridge Cleaver
to participate in a series of lectures at Stanford this fall. For several
reasons it is vital that Cleaver appear here.
It is not necessary to approve of Cleaver's viewpoint in order to
realize the value of listening to him.
He is an articulate spokesman for the new consciousness of the
black community. He embodies the confidence and sense of power
that will enable black people to construct their own environment
and determine their own destiny. Most important, Cleaver has
lived in the changing society of the streets. Reality has not been
interpreted for him by pudgy social scientists.
It is also important that Stanford assert the independence that
can be so easily restricted at a public institution like the University
of California. If private universities do not protect their freedom to
investigate unpopular ideas, then the chances are that no one will.

Richard Daley's response to dissent in Chicago and the Califor
nia legislature's reaction to the prospect of Eldridge Cleaver lec
turing at Berkeley are, it seems to us, reflections of the same men
tality. Daley, the California lawmakers, and the people who sup
port them are of a mind to ignore opinions that they do not like.
And they are prepared to enforce their ignorance with the politi
cal and military means at their disposal.
Incursion on academic freedom by California's politicians is re
grettable in itself. But the reaction to Cleaver's appointment be
comes more ominous when seen as part of a swelling wave of at
tacks on freedom of expression—a wave that has already swept Dr.
Benjamin Spock into court, carried police into the streets of Wash
ington, Oakland and Chicago, and left facist graffiti on the walls
of the Mid-Peninsula Free University store in Menlo Park.
Lawrence Magid, the Center for Participant Education, and the
Board of Educational Development at Berkeley are to be com
mended their efforts to establish real academic freedom on that
campus. Unfortunately the University of California, like any pub
licly supported institution, is particularly vulnerable to political

harassment. It appears that in the future political interference will
he more frequent and more damaging to state college and univer
sity systems.
