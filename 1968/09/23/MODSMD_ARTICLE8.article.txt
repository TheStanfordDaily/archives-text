## McCARTHY 
### JAMES A. SMITH 
EDITOR'S NOTE: James Smith
is a senior at M.I.T. who is ful
filling course requirements by
working as Washington corres
pondent of his school paner and
interning at the Washington
POST. The DAILY is considering
running his column on a regu
lar basis.

If elections were won by bump
er stickers, a quick survey shows
Humphrey, Nixon, Snoopy and
the Esso Tiger neck and neck,
but none of them near beating
Eugene McCarthy.
It's a part of that "McCarthy
phenomenon" that no one wants
to remove his stickers. McCarthy
daisies at e still seen everywhere:
on cars, windows, stop-signs
even on the book in Longfe'low's
hand atop his Connecticut Ave
nue pedestal here in Washing
ton.
Bumper stickers sornd trivial,
perhaps, but the resilience they
reflect is not — at least not to
the Humphrey forces. The nom
inee himself is now saying that
McCarthy support is essential to
victory, and h" pleads to them
for "rationality" to prevail in
what he calls the common desire
to "stop Nixon."
But will it prevail? In New
York, the state's Democratic
party chairman, John J. Burns,
is worried about winning his cri
tical state for Humphrey. He
said that Humphrey's strongest
issue was the negative one oi
who he was running against,
much like Johnson's anti-Gold
water appeal in 1964.
"When the McCarthy people
see what Wallace and Nixon and
Agnew have to say," he hopes
aloud, "they will come around."
In all camps there is doubt
that Humphrey can win now
without McCarthy votes, or that
even passive endorsement (all
Humphrey could expect) would
be sufficient to put him over in
November.
Here in the District of Colum
bia, Sam Sifth, a Democratic
Central Committee member
elected on a peace slate, said at
a recent meeting (which finally
endorsed Humphrey reluctantly)

that "what we are really disput
ing is whether we should share
with Humphrey the role of fu
neral director for the Democratic
ticl-et. I don't want to do that."
Many McCarthy -supporters
are simply not impressed with
arguments for stopping Nixon.
"I prefer milk of magnesia to
castor oil," explained Smith, "b ;, t
I try to keep away from them
both."
One rationale givon by Mc-
Carthy supporters for their un
characteristic political mononu
cleosis is that if indeed both can
didates (and Wallace) would
continue a war which would
paralyze domestic programs,
then "why not" have the candi
date who will at loast be frank
about it and not raise unfulfilled
xpetcations in the ghettos. As
one McCarthyite put it,"I wouV
rather deal with the 'used car
salesman' (Nixon) than with a
dealer who can only sell me thr*
body because the engines are
needed for helicopters."
Humphrey gambled, of
course, that after winning the
nomination he could restore the
unity needed for winning in No
vember. Yet a table published
last week in the Now York Times
shows that even Wallace has
more definite electoral votes at
this time than Humphrey — and
Nixon a clear majority.
What is becoming evident as
the campaign develops is that
the delegates did more than
make a policy decision in choos
ing Humphrey. In the process
they may very well have for
feited the energy and enthu
siasm of the one political ma
chine at Chicago which could
outdo both Nixon's and Wal
lace's.
One reason that Humphrey is
having difficulty making "good
losers" out of the McCarthyites
is that McCarthy's supporters
don't feel they were the losers.
The party and not McCarthy,
they insist, lost in Chicago.
Shirking the role of "funeral
director" and unmoved by the
Humphrey - Nixon match, they
are content to stand aside re
spectfully during the burial and

pick up the pieces in D cembe"
much as Nixon did from Gold
water.
It disturbs Humphrey that the
principle-conscious McCarthyites
should wi ling to sit through
the race, but it is Humphrey's
burden to convince them of a
difference between himself and
Nixon.
He might well recall that Rob
ert Kennedy had the same prob
lem in March of attracting Mc-
Carthy supporters. What Ken
nedy discovered then was a dif
ferent kind of political loyalty
than he had fought before. Sud
denly past record, good looks
and "stopping Johnson" were
no longer so important and the
McCarthyites were pretty proud
of their own tenacity.
