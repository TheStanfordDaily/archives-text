# Trustee Defends Pitzer
## 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I have your letter of August
21st asking the Board of Trus
tees to reconsider its decision in
selecting Kenneth S. Pitzer to
become President of Stanford
University. As you know, a com
mittee of Trustees, in close col
laboration with a faculty advi
sory committee (elected by the
Stanford faculty), spent many
hours over a period of seventeen
months trying to do the best pos
sible job in finding a man to suc
ceed Wally Sterling.
As you also know, early in
this search students were invited
to submit names and dossiers of
possib'e candidate for the job to
Professor Baxter and, in fact,
did submit a number of names.
I realize this procedure falls far
short of the participation for
which students are asking. I
merely point out that students
did have an opportunity to make
recommendations.
In the course of our search,
much thought was given to th
relationship in today's university
between a president on the one
hand and faculty and students
on the other. In fact, I and other
Trustees have met with Peter
Lyman and then Denis Hayes
an-1 some of their associates and
have exchanged vi ws on this
and oth~>r matters of concern to
the rniversity. I do not claim to
sreak for students, but I must
say that student hopes and in
terests were not ignored in the
delib of the search com
mittees.
In any event, th' 1 deed is done
and those of us who bear the re
sponsibility are delighted with
Dr. Pitzer. He is an outstanding
scholar and experienced admini
strator. He has expressed his in
t rest in student participation in
more areas of university life.
He has the full confidence of
those who know him and I think
it only fair that you reserv •
your own judgement until you
have had a chance to see for
yourself. I think at that tim ■
you wil share our enth siasm
for the man and that you, too,

wi'l conclude that Dr. Pit?er
will provide outstanding leader
ship to our University.

EDITOR'S NOTE: Tltis is a
response to a request from nicni
b>rs of the DAILY editorial
hoard to the Trustees askine
that they reconsider Dr. Pitrer's
selection. Tha DAILY editors
pointed out that students had no
effective voice in the selection
112 tlie mw president and that,
'•■-,»"i >fr from Riee, Dr. Pizer
1 u!d well be unprepared to deal
\ ifch file kind of stud "nt eon
viousn-'ss that exists at Stan
ford.
Editor, The Daily:
Parts of the editorial in the
r \ ptember 20 e 'ition entit
J mp Off The Deep End" are
about th most fatuous excerpts
of journalism that I have ever
road.

A failure to take the long view
and to use moderation produced
the interventions in both the
Dominican Republic and Czecho
slovakia as well as the war of
attrition in Southeast Asia.
Moderation is neither quaking
in fright thirty feet away from
the water nor going off the deep
end if one can't swim. Modera
tion does not mean racial re
pression or Dick Nixon. It means
equitable laws for all citizens
with equal justice. It means
change for the better while in
suring enough order to prevent
future two-bit demagogues from
becoming minor gods. . . .
Remember, our forebearers
did not take the long view. They
were plantation and factory
owners who literally or figura
tively enslaved millions. Today
our generation has their harvest
to reap. It alone we can over
come. . . .

sreak for students, but I must
say that student hopes and in

In any event, th' 1 deed is done
and those of us who bear the re
sponsibility are delighted with
Dr. Pitzer. He is an outstanding
scholar and experienced admini
strator. He has expressed his in
t rest in student participation in
more areas of university life.
He has the full confidence of
those who know him and I think
it only fair that you reserv •
your own judgement until you
have had a chance to see for
yourself. I think at that tim ■
you wil share our enth siasm

will provide outstanding leader

A failure to take the long view

the interventions in both the

Moderation is neither quaking
in fright thirty feet away from
the water nor going off the deep
end if one can't swim. Modera
tion does not mean racial re

equitable laws for all citizens

change for the better while in
suring enough order to prevent
future two-bit demagogues from
becoming minor gods. . . .
Remember, our forebearers
did not take the long view. They
were plantation and factory
owners who literally or figura

our generation has their harvest
to reap. It alone we can over

Editor, The Daily:
I have your letter of August
21st asking the Board of Trus
tees to reconsider its decision in
selecting Kenneth S. Pitzer to
become President of Stanford
University. As you know, a com
mittee of Trustees, in close col
laboration with a faculty advi
sory committee (elected by the
Stanford faculty), spent many
hours over a period of seventeen
months trying to do the best pos
sible job in finding a man to suc
ceed Wally Sterling.
As you also know, early in
this search students were invited
to submit names and dossiers of
possib'e candidate for the job to
Professor Baxter and, in fact,
did submit a number of names.
I realize this procedure falls far
short of the participation for
which students are asking. I
merely point out that students
did have an opportunity to make
recommendations.
In the course of our search,
much thought was given to th
relationship in today's university
between a president on the one
hand and faculty and students
on the other. In fact, I and other
Trustees have met with Peter
Lyman and then Denis Hayes
an-1 some of their associates and
have exchanged vi ws on this
and oth~>r matters of concern to
the rniversity. I do not claim to
sreak for students, but I must
say that student hopes and in
