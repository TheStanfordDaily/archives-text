PHICiS ARE "ABOUT."
Suede is the story here—combining with wool in John Meyer
clothes with a proper country air. Their thoroughbred tailoring
makes any rural scene. Pierced suede edges the brushed shetland
cardigan $23. And suede binds the pockets of the Port Ellen plaid
skirt with front pleats $20. Button-down oxford shirt #7.
All in brilliant colors. At discerning stores.
