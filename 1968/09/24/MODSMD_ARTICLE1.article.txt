# Housing Policy
## Faculty Closed Community? 
### FRIEDRICH ABEL News Analysis 
University and faculty reacted
quietly to series of articles on the
Stanford faculty housing situ
ation published in two June is
sues of the 1968 summer Daily.
A landlady, after reading the
story, said scornfully that "there
is no such thing as segregation
in this area" and her "best
friends are Negroes."
What had the story " 'Faculty
Farm' A Company Town?" and
a relating editorial said?
Because about 40 per cent of
934 faculty members of the Aca
demic Council live in a residential
subdivision on the Stanford
Campus, the Daily asked if Stan
ford's faculty members prefer
red to be separated in their pri
vate lives from the rest of so
ciety.
The question appeared rele
vant when considering that on
completion of the latest resi
dential subdivision, Frenchman's
Hill which is adjacent to already
existing 4609 homes in the Pine
Hill area, the total number of
houses will jump to 650 within
the next few years. (Only 55 of
the Frenchman's Hill housing
lots have not been reserved or
occupied yet, according to Worth
Blaney, faculty-staff housing co
ordinator.)
Granted, The Dally editorial
said, "the University has an im

mense resource in its lands, and
it has used them well In attract
ing good new faculty to the cam
pus. Professors can get high
loans with relatively low inter
est on a long-term basis. The
land itself is given free — ex
cept for a development fee — to
prospective home owners."
"But in this time of social un
rest in other communities, we
believe that the use of the lands
should be modified."
The Daily had arrived at this
conclusion after questioning 40
faculty members and some ad
ministrators about their
thoughts on Stanford's faculty
and staff housing policy.
A number of professors com
plained during these interviews
that the standards already set
by existing homes in the Pine
Hill area are too high. They find
it difficult to built a $15,000 cabin
near a $75,000 house. Most
houses on the campus are valued
between $40,000 and $60,000 while
several of them would sell be
tween $75,000 and $100,000. A
low priced house runs between
$35,000 and $42,000.
Economic Segregation Exists
An economic segregation
exists in that those who would
like to live on campus, but do not
want to commit themselves on a
$45,000 loan, are offered no
cheaper housing alternatives
such as apartments in larger

residence complexes or rentals.
Although in some future time
multiple unit houses might be
built on campus for younger
faculty and emeriti, perhaps on
a rental basis, this idea has not
even reached a planning stage.
"More frightening in this time
of radical unrest in our land,"
The Daily continued, "is that no
serious attempts seem to be
made to reduce the economic, so
cial, and therefore racial segre
gation of Stanford's faculty
farm."
Many professors choose not
to live in a "company town, a
segregated community," or in a
situation of "social inbreeding"
out of this reason. These pro
fessors feel that a community
composed of people representing
a relatively narrow professional
and economic range creates an
extremely one-sided environ
ment.
Some professors, who live off
campus, said that such "with
drawal from the problems of the
surrounding communities," and
from contacts with minority
groups and a "cross section of
society," would make them feel
as if they were living in a self
manufactured ghetto.
Realistic contacts with the
world in a naturally grown com
munity are nccessary to learn
the problems of such groups,
commented Joseph Katz, director
of the Institute for the Study of
Human Problems.
Live In EPA
It would be necessary to live
in parts of Menlo Park or in East
Palo Alto if a professor does
not want to escape from th?
realities of average American
communities, another faculty
member said.
Out of these considerations the
Daily had concluded its editorial:
Although The Daily has found
that the special segregation that
exists in the faculty housing de
velopments may not reflect the
social sphere that faculty mem
bers move in, we believe the
Stanford lands should be utilized
in the following ways:
• To make available land to
underprivileged persons, the Uni
versity should let a number of
non-University people from low
er income brackets rent in Uni
versity-built apartment buildings
in the faculty housing area.
• Other persons—preferrably
minority group members —
should be allowed the free land
to build in the faculty area,
though probably the University
could not afford to extend the
financial help that is given to
faculty and staff members.
• Also it seems reasonable
that in the interests of fairness
the University should give pro
fessors who wish to build homes

off-campus loans similar to those
given on-campus home-builders.
An Immense Resource
"University lands are an im
mense resource. On them could
be built model integrated com
munities that can take advant
age of the cultural resources of
the University. We hope that
Stanford will move in that di
rection."
Although this reporter, when
looking for new housing in Palo
Alto, was rejected by a landlord
for being a member of the "rad
ical Stanford Daily," and was
therefore somewhat intimidated,
he would nevertheless like to
ask where the University really
stands on the faculty housing
issue.


HARPER VALLEY? — What to do with Stanford's abundant land has never been a problem for Stan
ford administrators. In the past it has been leased as industrial park or given to faculty for the build
ing of luxurious homes. Is it now time for Stanford to promote economic and racial integration — at
least on its own territory?
