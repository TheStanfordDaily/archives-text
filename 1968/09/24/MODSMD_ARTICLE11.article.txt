## Nairobi Helps Itself 
### ROBERT SPANNER 
For decades, well-meaning lib
erals perpetuated the ghetto. To
the dismay and anger of conser
vatives, billions were poured into
paternalistic welfare programs.
But, as de Toqueville noted in
1840 with regard to total govern
ment, "For (the people's) hap
piness (total) government will
ingly labors, but it chooses to
be the sole agent and the only
arbiter of that happiness; it

provides for their security . . .
supplies their necessities . . .
manages their principle concerns
. . . what remains, but to spare
them all the care of thinking
and all the trouble of living?"
Black Power
Though it wasn't intended as
such, this is a description, I
think, of the prevalent attitude
toward the American ghetto.
That is why there had to be
Black Power.
Black Power initiated an awe
some mobilization of community
spirit and energy in East Palo
Alto this past summer. The sum
mer education project was part
of It.
Twenty-six black college stu
dents (12 from the Black Student
Union at Stanford) taught sev
eral hundred high school stu
dents during the morning at
Ravenswood High School. In
turn the teenagers taught over
1,000 pre-schoolers during the
afternoon.
The Director of the program,
Douglas Barket, described his
purpose succinctly.
"We don't care about integra
tion or any of that stuff. We
don't need it. What we're try
ing to do here is build a commu
nity — a black community."
And that's what happened. Be
sides teaching, the college stu
dents were involved in political
action programs, such as the
drive to incorporate the area and
the effort to change the com
munity's name to Nairobi.
But instruction still received
most of the attention.
"The only thing we need to be
a real community is skills,"
Barker asserted. "We have land,
people, everything else."
The list of classes was exten
sive: English, African history,
African dance, black politics,
public SDeakine. creative writing.

The college students were ut
terly inexperienced as teachers.
All of them were undergradu
ates, most were underclassmen.
All they brought to the class
room was a desire to teach and
an enthusiasm for their subject.
Barker said that was enough.
The classes were not just re
medial. According to Barker
"Remedial classes make kids
remedial. If a kid has an educa
tional deficit, we fill it. In the
public school system, if he's re
medial in one area, they make
him remedial in all. Public edu
cation assumes the black is born
illiterate, and will remain that
way."
Develop Pride
"The first thing we want to
do here is to develop pride in
one's self and one's history,"
Barker explained. "And we teach
the skills to get these kids
through the system."
It will prove difficult for some
men to furnish government
funds to such projects as this
one, without giving outsiders a
hand in its management. But
that is what must be done.

erals perpetuated the ghetto. To
the dismay and anger of conser
vatives, billions were poured into
paternalistic welfare programs.
But, as de Toqueville noted in
1840 with regard to total govern
ment, "For (the people's) hap
piness (total) government will
ingly labors, but it chooses to
be the sole agent and the only
arbiter of that happiness; it

provides for their security . . .
supplies their necessities . . .
manages their principle concerns
. . . what remains, but to spare
them all the care of thinking
and all the trouble of living?"
Black Power
Though it wasn't intended as
such, this is a description, I
think, of the prevalent attitude
toward the American ghetto.
That is why there had to be
Black Power.
Black Power initiated an awe
some mobilization of community
spirit and energy in East Palo
Alto this past summer. The sum
mer education project was part
of It.
Twenty-six black college stu
dents (12 from the Black Student
Union at Stanford) taught sev
eral hundred high school stu
dents during the morning at
Ravenswood High School. In
turn the teenagers taught over
1,000 pre-schoolers during the
afternoon.
The Director of the program,
Douglas Barket, described his
purpose succinctly.
"We don't care about integra
tion or any of that stuff. We
don't need it. What we're try
ing to do here is build a commu
nity — a black community."
And that's what happened. Be
sides teaching, the college stu
dents were involved in political
action programs, such as the
drive to incorporate the area and
the effort to change the com
munity's name to Nairobi.
But instruction still received
most of the attention.
"The only thing we need to be
a real community is skills,"
Barker asserted. "We have land,
people, everything else."
The list of classes was exten
sive: English, African history,
African dance, black politics,
public SDeakine. creative writing.

The college students were ut
terly inexperienced as teachers.
All of them were undergradu
ates, most were underclassmen.
All they brought to the class
room was a desire to teach and
an enthusiasm for their subject.
Barker said that was enough.
The classes were not just re
medial. According to Barker
"Remedial classes make kids
remedial. If a kid has an educa
tional deficit, we fill it. In the
public school system, if he's re
medial in one area, they make
him remedial in all. Public edu
cation assumes the black is born
illiterate, and will remain that
way."
Develop Pride
"The first thing we want to
do here is to develop pride in
one's self and one's history,"
Barker explained. "And we teach
the skills to get these kids
through the system."
It will prove difficult for some
men to furnish government
funds to such projects as this
one, without giving outsiders a
hand in its management. But
that is what must be done.
For decades, well-meaning lib
erals perpetuated the ghetto. To
the dismay and anger of conser
vatives, billions were poured into
paternalistic welfare programs.
