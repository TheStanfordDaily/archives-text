# POW! The DAILY takes a potshot at the City of Palo Alto on a matter of nogreat IMPORTANCE!!
## 
### 
A word to the many Stanford students who commute to campus
on their bicycles from Palo Alto every day: don't. It's now illegal,
unless you use a street other than University Avenue or Embar
cadero.
Early this month the Palo Alto City Council demonstrated for
ward-looking attitudes by passing a resolution banning bicycles
from sidewalks on underpasses and overpasses. They had pre
viously outlawed bikes from roadways on under- and overpasses.
The only problem with this is that, due to the Southern Pacific
tracks, the only ways to get from the section of Palo Alto east of
El Camino Real to campus are University and Embarcadero. Both
of these streets have underpasses.
But don't worry too much if you break the new law. It is un
likely the city will station patrolmen at the underpasses to arrest
pedalling lawbreakers. According to the city attorney, the main
purpose of the ordinance is to protect Palo Alto from lawsuits
caused by bicycle-pedestrian accidents.
The old politics strikes again.
