## 'Stop Integration' 
### CRAIG WILSON 
Black America, says Stanford
Black Student Union Co-chair
man, "should stop believing in
integration and now."
So said John Powell, in a bitter
analysis of Leßoi Jones award

winning play "Dutchman,"
shown before a turnaway crowd
in Cubberley Auditorium Sunday
night after a mechanical failure
caused the film to be moved
from Memorial Auditorium.
Powell spoke as part of a panel

including Religion Prof. Robert
McAfee Brovvn, Cynthia Hamil
ton of the BSU, Paul Rupert, a
Stanford graduate and Tom
Grissom, an English TA.
The play was named the best
American play of 1963-64. It
concerns a young Negio, Clay,
who is accosted in the subway
and subjected to a mocking se
duction by a cracy, though fas
cinating, blond, Lula, in a tight
fitting jersey dress. She at first
seems like a harmless bohemian.
But as the play develops she be
gins to needle him trying to
provoke him, using such trig
ger words as "Uncle Tom" and
"nigger".
Black Anger
Finally he tells her off in a
lengthy outburst of fury, encom
passing all the anger of the
black against white people.
Moderator Brown prefaced the
play by saying we must remem
ber that "in the world at large
the white race is in the minor
ity." This is an "uncomfortable"
film, "a film that is a microcosm
of the whole social racial issue
of today. It is an allegory of how
black relates to white."
The panel seemed to agree that
the white had exploited the
black and that this exploitation
was unchecked in contemporary
society.
Silent Aquiesence
In our society Brown stated
"even the people with good will,
by their own participation are
a part of this racism. It is a si

lent conspiratorial acquiesence
to its continuation. The situation
had better change or this will
not be a fit world in which to
live."
When a student asked Powell
\vhether Clay played in Lula's
hands by his violent outburst,
Powell responded "he should
have murdered her."
Upon suggestion that this idea
represented a racist value which
would defeat the possibility of
the races working together,
Powell challenged "it is impos
sible for a black man to be a
racist. You are acting out of
experience and self defense."
Cynthia Hamilton interjected
it was impossible for there to be
a truly integrated society.
Powell continued, "The whites
are in the minority and they
will not allow themselves to lose
hold of the reins. Black people
should stop believing in integra
tion and now."
Brown asked if integration
wouldn't be a good way for put
ting blacks in power. Powell
stated, "No. This breaks down
with Clay, (in the play). If they
play along, the Negro will be
destroyed as Clay was. We must
work toward goals and not com
promise."
Cynthia added later that the
Negro today "is part of the white
crowd that helped murder Clay.
It is their obliviousness — refu
sal to see any self."
Earlier, Brown told the audi
ence that it must make an ef-

Play
fort to see itself as the black
artist sees it. He cited three ex
amples.
First he pointed to the teasing,
tantalizing, attitude of Lula.
Isn't this the way we are. We
tease Blacks. We integrate at a
rate of one per cent a year in
our schools." We allow them "to
use our buses, but not to live
in our neighborhoods."
Second, "the Black has not
murdered white as the folk-lore
goes today. During the summer
riots it's not the white but the
blacks who are murdered. We
engage systematically in human
destruction not only physically
but in the human, heart, soul
and spirit."
Third, others follow Lula's
orders. "Three times during the
play she gives orders to those
on the subway. In just this way
we are the silent conspiratorial
partners. We are as guilty as
she. There are names for this
silent culpability: white racism,
institutional racism."
'Liberated Whores'
Grissom stated in his analysis
he felt we were a "society of
liberated whores." We identity
with Lula and not with Clay.
Mentioning some laughter he
heard during the play he stated
"the response of the audience
astounds me. It is testimony to
our own condition."
Rupert suggested basically the
film contains two themes. First
is the "assertion of Lula that 'I
am no one and don't forget
that.' " Second is her statement
"I lie a lot. It helps me control
the world."
"She has no idea who she is,"
stated Rupert, "but she lies
about it to help control the
world. America is a collection of
people with no concept of who
they are."
