# Computer Chessman
## 
### 
The computer chess player
who lost and drew two in a four
game match with the Russians
last year is taking a sabbitical
leave for study and research â€”
largely in Russia.
Stanford Prof. John McCarthy,
who heads the Artificial Intelli
gence Project which aims to
make computers think like hu
mans, plans to spend most of
his time in the Siberian "science
city" of Novosibirsk.
He also plans to visit Moscow,
where the Institute of Theoreti
cal Physics is located. It was the
Institute's computer chess pro

gram that beat his Stanford
program.
Prof. McCarthy, one of the
world's foremost artificial intelli
gence experts, will lecture
abroad and pursue further re
search on mathematical theory
of computation and on artificial
intelligence. He has visited the
U.S.S.R. frequently in the past,
and taught himself Russian
when the language barrier be
came troublesome.
His schedule also calls for
visits to Israel, Edinburgh in
Scotland, and Czechoslovakia en
route. He is expected to return
to the Stanford campus next
summer.
