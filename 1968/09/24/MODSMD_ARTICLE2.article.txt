# Residence Squeeze
## 
### SUSAN SWARD 
The blondes working at the
housing clearing desk at the pa
vilion tell students that rooms
are available, but are informed
that the majority of rooms
which are available are in pri
vate homes. Many students do
not appear to be content with
this alternative.
Williard G. Wyman, Associate
Dean of Students, observed that
the housing shortage does not as
yet seem to be as critical as the
situation last fall.
"Obviously," he admitted, "we
are caught in a squeeze at this
time." Wyman went on to say
that by 5 P.M. Tuesday the ex
act housing situation would be
more apparent. At that time all
students would have had the op
portunity to record their hous
ing needs with the clearing desk
in front of the Pavillion.
"Housing right now seems to

be available," Wyman noted. "Of
course, it may not be ideal."
Prof. Lewis Spitz, head of the
Housing Committee of Study of
Education at Stanford (SES),
stated that the Housing Com
mittee's report is completed and
has been referred to the Steer
ing Committee of SES. The fi
nal form of the proposals will
then be given to the University
for consideration by the admin
istration and Board of Trustees.
Spitz said, "Our committee
was thinking in terms of years
rather than in terms of an im
mediate crisis." It is difficult to
tell if an extreme student hous
ing shortage does exist at this
time, but there is some confu
sion.
Numerous students are comb
ing the area from Woodside to
Mountain View who have not re
corded their names at the clear
ing desk in front of the Pavil
ion.
