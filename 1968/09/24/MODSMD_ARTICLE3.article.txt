## SDS Views Stanford 
### DAN SNELL 
"America is undergoing: menopause."
— "Through the Looking Glass."

The Students for a Democratic Society's student anti-handbook
is not a program for "the revolution," but it presents a comprehen
sive view of the University through leftist eyes.
Called "Through the Looking Glass," the booklet is being sold
for 25 cents at the registration pavilion. Though you may not agree
with its basic assumptions, it is 48 pages that ought to be read by
every student.
The assumptions of the people who wrote the handbook are rather
clear — almost naively clear at points. They view American society
as completely corrupted by liaisons between big business, big gov
ernment, and big education, and they are quite honest about saying
so.
Naivete enters in largely in the section entitled "Where We're At,"
in which they describe the activities of the Stanford left. The Pen
insula Observer is presented as a clear expositor of the truth in
stead of an interesting but biased collection of essays.
And the other organizations of the left, in the past usually small
and inchoate, are described in undeservedly glowing terms.
Frightening Truth
But its faults do not greatly affect the frightening truth the booklet
puts forth — that America in her menopause is still trying to wear
the jewels of industrial expansion that once seemed to make her
beautiful. And that America, concentrating on her cold jewels,
has to a very large extent forgotten her people.
The seminal section of the handbook, which introduces itself as
a response to the "liberal" and therefore unworthy publication put
out for new students by the Pre-Reg Committee, is a study of "The
Octopus" — the relationships between the military, industry, gov
ernment, and Stanford.

The analysis is not always complete and does not recognize that
relations in big business do not necessarily imply collusion. But the
booklet is not really as short on facts as conservatives might wish.
And the amount of the uses of The Manned Aerospace Center
brought to Rice by President-designate Kenneth Pitzer and Stan
ford's Stanford Rsearch Institute is consciousness-expanding indeed.
"Through the Looking Glass" also gives good short histories of
crises and problems in the University's recent past—from liquor to
Lyman to David Harris.
Although rejecting the Study of Education at Stanford (SES)
for being unprepared to recommend really basic changes in the
Stanford curriculum, the authors drive on to conclusions that seem
rather similar to the noises SES people have been making.
Alternative to Axe Commission
"... grades accustom the student to regular evaluations by his
superiors," the booklet says. "By the time a young American has
a job, he actually believes that his supervisor can objectively value
his work and accepts this function unquestioningly."
The sketch of President-designate Pitzer in the booklet is rather
cursory. What was expended in bitterness could easily have been
spent on frightening excerpts from Pitzer's speeches.
The people who wrote the booklet obviously think that the proper
response to Stanford is a move into the ranks of the 1 ft. And the
picture they paint of the left is a pleasant one.Their painting is
sometimes distorted, but it does give the new student an alternative)
to the Axe Commission.
And it is an alternative that ought to be explored by a lot more
people in this time of what the booklet calls "shriveled hope." Ex
plored at least to the extent of buying a copy of "Through Th 1
Looking Glass."
