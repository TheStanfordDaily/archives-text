# Hayes Wants Students In Debate Over ROTC
## 
### COREY GOODMAN CHRIS PECK 
Denis Hayes, president of the
Associated Students of Stanford
University (ASSU), asked yes
terday that a panel of students
present their views before the
Academic Senate on the propo
sition to abolish credit for ROTC
courses.
Hayes in a letter to Academic
Senate Chairman Leonard Schiff
that he has appointed a stu
dent panel "representing a wide
divergence of student opinion on
this issue," which would be in
terested in speaking before the
Senate.
For the panel to appear before
the Senate, a unanimous consent
motion would have to be approv
ed by that body. It seems unlike
ly that one will pass since one
Academic Senate member has
already said that he is opposed
on principle to students par
ticipating in Senate debates.
'Unimaginable'
Professor of Religion William
a member of the Aca
demic Senate , c aid that it would
be "unimaginable" that the Sen
ate would not at least consult
-tudents before making a deci
â€¢ion on a matter so directly re
lated to the interests of students.
No matter what happens in re
gard to student participation, it
seems unlikely that the Senate

will reach a final decision at its
Thursday meeting.
Hayes requested that the
Steering Committee of the Aca
demic Senate place th > matter
of student participation in this
debate on the agenda before the
debate on the proposition.
Academic Senate member
James Gibbs, Jr. associate pro
fessor of anthropology said that
trying to get students into the
ROTC debate before the total
issue of student participation in
Academic Senate debates has
been resolved could cause a "con
fusion of the two issues which
might cause the proposal to be
lost."
A Place For ROTC
He said also that "there is gen
erally a place for ROTC on cam
pus. It is optional and does not
get that much academic credit."
He added however that he has
not made up his mind on the
ROTC question.
Prof. Holt Ashley of aeronau
tics and astronautics said that
students should be invited on
committees. He added that since
there was a question of whether
the ROTC issue would be sent
to a committee of the Senate be
fore final debate that the degree
of student participation in the
debate was unknown.
One student cadet officer
agreed that student participation
in the debate would he useful

if it were a "well-balanced
group."
"I don't think the non-ROTC
students can tell too much about
the quality of the courses, but
they would be of value in bring
ing in their different attitudes
on the question," he continued.
Military Science Experience
Major James Bayer, instructor
of the third year Army ROTC
program said about student par
ticipation in the debate that
"students who have taken the
classes would be of value to the
meeting, but if they have experi
ence in the military science pro
gram, I don't think they could
be of much help.
Bayer defended the ROTC
classes maintaining he demanded
high standards of his classes and
required a good deal of research.
"My military schooling and my
personal experience qualify me
to teach my courses," he added.
Naval science courses were
also In-Pyo Hong a
senior NROTC student said
that Naval Scicnce courses are
"taught by competent people".
He admitted however that the
courses "are not difficult for a
Stanford student."
Bob Mallek, a junior and an
NROTC student said "I think
they are just as difficult and take
up as much time," as other Stan
ford courses.
