# Cop Or Citizen?
## Campus Police Dilemma 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Stanford patrolmen almost be
came official police officers this
summer, but negotiations on the
subject between the University
and Santa Clara County have
been broken off.
Originally, the administration
wanted to change the status of
some of the officers so that they
could give out traffic citations
which could be handled by the
county.
Presently, the men who patrol
Stanford are merely security
guards, and have no more power
in enforcing the law than any
other citizen. Therefore moving
violations and illegal parking, if
cited by a Stanford officer, can
be handled only administratively
within the University.
The present difficulties arose
from two incidents that occurred
during the past year. One was a

ruling by the student Judicial
Council, and the other an ar
rest on campus for use of mari
juana.
The Judicial Council ruling
came after it had been revealed
that many faculty and staff
members had not been paving
fines levied for parking viola
tions, while students were forced
to do so.
Therefore the Council ruled
that students no longer had to
pay fines because of unequal en
forcement.
No decision has been reached
on this problem. The decision to
try to "give some of the patrol
men a commission" from the
county as officers so the fines
could be enforced was one at
tempt at a solution, according to
Cassius Kirk, University coun
sel.
But the plan has been dropped.
As Kirk said, "It's questionable
whether they should be peace
officers.
"There are advantages" in
maintaining the patrolmen's
present status, he continued,
in that if they are peace officers
they must report any violation
they see. If they are not, they
could notify, say, the Dean of
Students."
Since the officers cannot issue
citations for moving violations,

Stanford has contracted with
Santa Clara County for county
police to patrol the campus four
hours a day.
