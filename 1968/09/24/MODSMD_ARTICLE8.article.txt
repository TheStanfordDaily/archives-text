# Letters To The Editor
## Housing Accord 
### 
EDITOR'S NOTE: The following
letter was delivered yesterday to
Dr. Glazer and other members of
the Stanford administration by
Ave representatives of the Amer
ican Federation of Teachers, Lo
cal 1816. It deals with a meeting
between the AFT and the admin
istration.
Editor, The Daily:
The results of any meeting are
subject to later confusion, due
to different interpretations being
formed by the various partici
pants. In order to eliminate any
such misunderstandings, we are
summarizing the areas of agree
ment which occurred at the Sep
tember 21st meeting. The AFT
looks forward to additional meet
ings as productive as this one.
1. Immediate needs of stu
dents for housing will be met by
the University. A questionnaire
will be distributed to all students
during registration to identify
those with no housing or with in
adequate housing. The Univer
sity is prepared to house 90
single students in 15 trailers and
80 married couples in Stanford
Village within 15 days after reg
istration.
2. The University recognizes
both the need and its responsi
bility to act to solve the chronic
problem of lack of low-income
housing, which affects (a) the
Stanford junior faculty and
graduate students, (b) low-in
come empolyees of the Univer
sity, and (c) other low-income
workers in the area (not all of
whom would be considered low
income by federal standards).
3. To implement this decision,
a policy-making committee will
be formed this week, consisting
of representatives of AFT, the
trustees, junior faculty, low-in
come employees of Stanford, and
m. * m I.

other groups concerned with
low-income housing, such as the
Black Students Union.
4. The Business Office will
implement preparation of a
breakdown of Stanford em
ployees by various income-level
groupings, which, along with
other information, will be used
to determine the quantitative ba
sis of the need for low-income
housing.
5. It was agreed that addi
tional dorm housing, as opposed
to apartments or houses, does
not constitute a solution. The
consensus was that additional
aieas like Escondido Village,
which isolates graduate students
from other members of the com
munity and which doesn't allow
residents to control their own
living areas, would not consti
tute a solution.
6. Stanford will attempt to use
its influence to see that the Cor
poration Yard in Palo Alto is
used for low and middle-income
housing. This influence may
take the form of University staff
assistance to Raven Enterprises
in the preparation of their pro
posal for development of the
site.
7. The University said that it
could build economically inte
grated housing similar to the
Light Tree Apartments in 6 to
7 months. The committee will
discuss implementation of this or
similar plans proposed by AFT
architects.
8. If the above understandings
do not coincide with yours,
please inform us, as we would
like to present the results of Sat
urday's meeting to our member
ship on Wednesday night.
