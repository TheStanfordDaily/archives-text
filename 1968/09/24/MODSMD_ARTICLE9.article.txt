# DREW PEARSON AND HIS FAITHFUL SIDEKICK JACK ANDERSON

### 
You can write it down as cer
tain that LBJ will never get a
truce in Vietnam as long as he
keeps his two negotiators in
Paris so tightly on the leash.
Friendly Western diplomats,
who have been following in
great detail the attempts to get
a truce in Vietnam, are amazed
at the manner in which the Pres

ident of the United States tries
to dictate the Paris talks from
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
They note that he has two of
the most experienced diplomats
from the American stable of
diplomacy representing him in
Paris. Ambassador Averell Har
riman has served in the Cabinet,
as ambassador to Moscow, am
bassador to London, as Deputy
Under Secretary of State and as
ambassador for the Marshall
Plan in Europe. Cyrus Vance,
former Under Secretary of De
fense, is also one of Johnson's
most trusted negotiators.
Both these men know their
diplomatic onions far better than
the President. Yet they have
been required to clear every
thing with him.
Nixon & LBJ
Sometimes, furthermore, they
have almost received the im
pression that President Johnson
would rather see Nixon elected
in November than Vice President
Humphrey. "Spider" Vance got
something of a jolt regarding
this when he received a tele
phone call in August from the
President asking him to come to
the LBJ ranch. Vance was about
to take off for Paris, but went
to Texas instead.
There he found, somewhat to
his surprise, former Vice Presi
dent Nixon lunching with LBJ.
Vance was asked to give Nixon
a briefing on the truce talks. It
surprised him, as it did others
around the White House, that
Johnson would invite Nixon to
lunch only two days after his
nomination.
The public doesn't know it,
but twice during the last three
months the truce talks have
been on the verge of success.
Here is the inside story of what
happened:
1. Last June Philip Noel-
Baker, a British Quaker and
long-time member of Parliament
who had been to Hanoi, worked
out a plan with the North Viet
namese and the American nego
tiators in Paris to get an agree
ment the minute the United
States stopped bombing North
Vietnam. The formula was for
the United States to move first,
with an agreement that North
Vietnam would move immedi
ately thereafter.
But suddenly there was pub
licity in Washington. Someone
leaked.
At this point the North Viet
namese blew up. Part of the
agreement was that there were

to be no leaks. American diplo
mats in Paris explained that
they were under requirement to
report these moves to the Presi
dent and that they were not re
sponsible for the leak. There
was some suspicion that the leak
from the White House was delib
erate on the part of those around
LBJ who don't really want peace.
But there was no evidence.
At any rate, the damage was
done. This particular peace over
ture was exploded.
2. Toward the end of last July
negotiators also were on the
verge of agreement. The North
Vietnamese had curtailed their
ground operations. There was
relative quiet in South Vietnam.
It was proposed that this be
taken as evidence of "responsible
reciprocity" and that the United
States suspend all bombing.
But at this point President
Johnson flew to Hawaii, where
he met President Thieu of South
Vietnam. He issued a vigorous
statement against any conces
sions. Once again the precarious
ly negotiated peace proposals
went up in smoke.

Friendly Western diplomats,
who have been following in
great detail the attempts to get
a truce in Vietnam, are amazed
at the manner in which the Pres

ident of the United States tries
to dictate the Paris talks from
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
They note that he has two of
the most experienced diplomats
from the American stable of
diplomacy representing him in
Paris. Ambassador Averell Har
riman has served in the Cabinet,
as ambassador to Moscow, am
bassador to London, as Deputy
Under Secretary of State and as
ambassador for the Marshall
Plan in Europe. Cyrus Vance,
former Under Secretary of De
fense, is also one of Johnson's
most trusted negotiators.
Both these men know their
diplomatic onions far better than
the President. Yet they have
been required to clear every
thing with him.
Nixon & LBJ
Sometimes, furthermore, they
have almost received the im
pression that President Johnson
would rather see Nixon elected
in November than Vice President
Humphrey. "Spider" Vance got
something of a jolt regarding
this when he received a tele
phone call in August from the
President asking him to come to
the LBJ ranch. Vance was about
to take off for Paris, but went
to Texas instead.
There he found, somewhat to
his surprise, former Vice Presi
dent Nixon lunching with LBJ.
Vance was asked to give Nixon
a briefing on the truce talks. It
surprised him, as it did others
around the White House, that
Johnson would invite Nixon to
lunch only two days after his
nomination.
The public doesn't know it,
but twice during the last three
months the truce talks have
been on the verge of success.
Here is the inside story of what
happened:
1. Last June Philip Noel-
Baker, a British Quaker and
long-time member of Parliament
who had been to Hanoi, worked
out a plan with the North Viet
namese and the American nego
tiators in Paris to get an agree
ment the minute the United
States stopped bombing North
Vietnam. The formula was for
the United States to move first,
with an agreement that North
Vietnam would move immedi
ately thereafter.
But suddenly there was pub
licity in Washington. Someone
leaked.
At this point the North Viet
namese blew up. Part of the
agreement was that there were

to be no leaks. American diplo
mats in Paris explained that
they were under requirement to
report these moves to the Presi
dent and that they were not re
sponsible for the leak. There
was some suspicion that the leak
from the White House was delib
erate on the part of those around
LBJ who don't really want peace.
But there was no evidence.
At any rate, the damage was
done. This particular peace over
ture was exploded.
2. Toward the end of last July
negotiators also were on the
verge of agreement. The North
Vietnamese had curtailed their
ground operations. There was
relative quiet in South Vietnam.
It was proposed that this be
taken as evidence of "responsible
reciprocity" and that the United
States suspend all bombing.
But at this point President
Johnson flew to Hawaii, where
he met President Thieu of South
Vietnam. He issued a vigorous
statement against any conces
sions. Once again the precarious
ly negotiated peace proposals
went up in smoke.
You can write it down as cer
tain that LBJ will never get a
truce in Vietnam as long as he
keeps his two negotiators in
Paris so tightly on the leash.
