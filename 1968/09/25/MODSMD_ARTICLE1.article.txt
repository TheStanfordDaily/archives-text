# Pitzer At Rice
## 
### THOMAS DAWSON 
(EDITOR'S NOTE: The following account of President Pitzer's
tenure at Rice is based on two days of interviews on the Houston
campus by Daily News Editor Tom Dawson in the middle of
August.)
Kenneth Pitzer comes to Stanford amid controversy over his
qualifications for the Stanford presidency. It might be well for us
to examine the character of his former school, Rice University in
Houston, and the changes he instituted there.
Pitzer assumed the Rice presidency seven years ago. At that time
the school was a tuition-free, all white institution catering to young
Texans. The school was suppored by income from the founding
gift of William March Rice, a wealthy Texan who founded the uni
versity in 1911. One of the terms of the charter was that Rice was
to be all white.
In 1964 Pitzer and Rice's board of trustees obtained a court order
allowing the school to admit blacks. The court order also allowed
the university to charge tuition. Since then, however, few Negroes
have been enrolled. One estimate is that there are ten to fifteen
Negroes in the student body of more than 2400.
Summer Program
One step that has been taken by the university in the field of
minority education has been the establishment of a highly success
ful summer program for 200 high school students from culturally
deprived areas. An estimated 40 per cent of the students are black.
One explanation for the low proportion of black and other minor
ity students at Rice is that the university has never lowered its
admission standards in order to admit more minority students.
Blacks often score lower on standardized admission tests because
of their different backgrounds.
In an interview with the DAILY Pitzer suggested that another
reason that blacks accepted by Rice were often also accepted by the
better known Ivy League institutions. Confronted with the choice,
most blacks select the Ivy League schools, Pitzer said.
Pitzer's incumbency at Rice has also seen the inclusion of stu
dents on many university committees, including those on admis
sions and undergraduate affairs.
The undergraduate affairs committee is similar to the student
conduct legislative council (SCLC) currently being proposed at
Stanford. It also serves as an appeals board for cases handled by
the various college judicial boards. Few appeals have been made in
recent years.
Student life at Rice is centered around seven colleges, five for men
and two for women. Coed dorms have not been introduced at Rice,
nor are they planned.
Students also serve in a non-voting capacity on the University
Teaching Committee which passes on faculty promotions and pro
poses measures to increase the quality of the Rice faculty.
When Pitzer took office at Rice, the school had a reputation as
an excellent technical school that was extremely weak in the so

cial sciences and humanities. The selection of Pitze •, i wrll-knovm
chemist, was greeted apprehensively by some who feared he i
a "big-shot chemist" and unconcerned with the problems of the non
scientific fields.
One professor reported a widespread fear that he would "buil l
graduate studies at the expense of the undergraduates." Most at
Rice now agree that such fears were unfounded.
Quality Of Teaching
Pitzer has evidenced a great deal of concern with the quality
of teaching at Rice, particularly at the undergraduate level. He
instituted several undergraduate teaching awards and helped fi
nance a student-run course review that was widely hailed as being
one of the best ever.
Prior to Pitzer's arrival at Rice most humanities departments at
Rice were run along the German lines with one distinguished pro
fessor overshadowing the rest of the department.
Pitzer furthered Rice's traditional orientation toward science and
technology with the founding of the nation's first department of
space science. The Manned Space Flight Center is located near
Houston and some Rice professors assist with government space
programs. Rice engineers have also assisted in the designing of
artificial heart valves used in the many heart operations at Hous
ton's Methodist Hospital.


KENNETH PITZER — "Within the socio-political climate of Hous
ton and Texas, Kenneth Pitzer was clearly a liberal. The ouestion
yet to be answered is how he will measure up in the far different
climate of Stanford."
