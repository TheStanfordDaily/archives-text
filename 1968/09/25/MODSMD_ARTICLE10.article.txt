## Election Sabotage? 
### 
America's red guards, exultant
over their success in sabotaging
the Democratic convention in
Chicago, now hope to sabotage
the national election on Novem
ber 5.
They are making elaborate

preparations to zero in on key
big-city precincts, which nor
mally produce an overwhelming
Democratic vote. They intend to
disrupt the voting by staging
noisy protests, intimidating vot
ers and sabotaging the voting
machines.
Their purpose is to deprive
Hubert Humphrey of the votes
he would need to carry such
swing states as New York, Cali
fornia, New Jersey, Massa
chusetts, Michigan and Pennsyl
vania. By bringing Humphrey
down to humiliating defeat, they
hope to teach the Democrats
that they must reckon with the
new left in the future.
The young militants discover
ed in Chicago that they could
make an impact on national poli
tics all out of proportion to their
numbers. Now they intend to
disrupt the November election,
taking their tactics from the
revolutionary textbooks that
come out of Castro's Cuba and
Mao's China.
The election sabotage will be
masked, of course, as peaceful
demonstrations. Ostensibly, the
demonstrators will turn out to
protest the fact that young men
who are eligible to be drafted
and killed in Vietnam at age 19
aren't eligible to vote in most
states.
The real aim of the ringlead
ers, however, will be to upset
the election and wreck the Dem
ocratic party. Out of the wreck
age some leaders hope they
might even be able to build a
militant, new left-wing party.
Until Election Day, the young
militants will keep in practice by
disrupting campaign rallies,
heckling Presidential candidates
and stirring up trouble. They
are even looking ahead to the
Presidential Inauguration next
January 20 when they plan to
stage more Chicago-style dem
onstrations.
They also intend to contribute

to the pre-election chaos by
keeping university campuses in
turmoil. Again, they hope to
produce a voter reaction against
thÂ° Democrats who, being more
liberal, get most of the blame
for the eruptions on the cam
puses, in the streets and in the
ghetto.
An intelligence report has
warned that the biggest disturb
ances will come the last week in
October on campuses across the
country. This will be part of "a
new internationally coordinated
protest against the war in Viet
nam. . . . The British, Japanese
and Vietnamese sections of thr?
anti-war movement are planning
an international protest during
the last week of October."
The American red guards, ac
cording to the confidential re
port, plan to form "an American
section to participate in the
forthcoming international dem
onstrations against the war in
Vietnam."
Hanoi Influence
It seems more than a coinci
dence that many of the hard
core leaders who have master
minded the youth rebellions have
made unauthorized trips to Ha
noi. They have come back to
whip up demonstrations which,
invariably, have had an anti-
Vietnam war theme.
In Saigon, the Viet Cong have
smuggled leaflets to American
Gls urging them to get in touch
with the Students for a Demo
cratic Society, the same group
which is now fomenting violence
on the campuses. Earlier, the
SDS helped to precipitate the
violence in Chicago.
The grateful Viet Cong sent
a message to the demonstrators:
"We express to you our deep
sympathy and ask you to convey
to the American people our
heartfelt thanks for their par
ticipation in or support of the
rocent action in Chicago. . .
