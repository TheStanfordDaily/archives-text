# The
						Pepsi Generation

### DAN MELLINKOFF 
Born we were—Sputnik, the death
of death—musical immortality—For
est Lawn—eres—the certain contra
ceptive, Pepsi Cola.
We were that—the generation that
"thought young" in a saccharine
maze. We were Atlas, committed,
bearing the hopes of our forefathers
and fathers on our shoulders—Fore
specters: starving millions, sinking he
low the earth—diseased creatures, a
device of certified armayeta. But like
hlitul cat progeny, oblivious we crept.
And up we grew—immersed in ter
rors too immense to assimilate their
flagitious portents. Rather than he
galled by the enormities—the mind
turned down—to beautifid feet. The
affluent society that did not have to
reckon its exulted position. Pep.H—
the world cleansed of remaining in
certitudes we, tanned—Sea and Ski
blessed—in Euphoria grazed.
And up u>e—also the phantoms—
grew—but in a womb warm egg, who
would dare break the placental shell.
But something else was breeding,
stirring, gurgling it came, now only,
zephric breaths, yet it grew. Compla
cency fathered autonomy, spayed
oigilance and ambition.
Ami up we grew, and there were
still those who preferred to stickle—
while the earth and rocks, roots, trees
beyond the horizon were slipping into
the sea.
Some, at first only a few, guessed
ivhit might be beyond—never was

such enormity imagined—many op
ened their eyes, then crept back, si
lent, into the egg into the womb. But
a few —the vanguard—remained on
the brink. A clenched fist of Mario
Salvos, Robert Zimmermans, and
Stokley Carmichaels, rose from the
warmth into a new world of cold.
The Pepsi Generation donned san
dals—took a sabbatical—where it is
note —on a prolonged leave of ab
sence.
Napalm, Los Angeles, Memphis,
Chicago, Dallas, penetration, splint
ering, shattering, fragmentary bul
lets. The Frost Giants have names
and sounds. The Polarization, calam
ity wailing in the darkness of the cel
lar; and in the second fortress, the fa
thers walking in their crumbling
world.
Our fathers, their fathers attaining
economic affluence, their humanity
worked into a decline. And if their
increasing wealth coexisted with hun
ger, they forget. This was a code
molded to a desire rather than mold
ing that desire. And now, today, that
crusty code has molded, maintaining
a mediocre somniference of the survi
vors of the past, the plastic men and
women teeter, in an intoxicated stu
por. But their doddering path leads
down into the valley of the Frost
Giants—despair awaits.
Here we are. Up we have grown.
We have then the overriding ques
tion, where to go?
The earth's pageant beckons. "We
can do better—" Clubs, the contort
ed faces —"We Love Mayor Dayley,"
swirling blasting night-sticks, a moth
er's night cry ignored—blood swirl
ing, bodies falling—shattering, jar
ring airborne metallic death, "a new
er world." A hold gladiator slashing
the Gordian Knot will not suffice. A
few iron soldiers will climb the pon
derous road.
Others, also, open the inner lids,
the world reveals itself, like an old
whore, a wrinkled sagging chest,
hooded eyes, squat legs that held a
former grace—the flesh suggests a
forsenesuousness. The lids close after
a brief resjnte—
The sabbatical now only words,
the wall rebuilds and many slink back
into the primeval pools. Nixon, Wal
lace, Reagan, pied pipers of the re
treat, charm the human snakes—The
earth cracks and rumbles, the Giants
heave. Men polarize, hate-war. Hu
manity's death is in the offing.
