# A 						Plea

It has been rumored that, be
neath the sunny exterior and
rustling palm-fronds of Stan
ford, there lies a vast reservoir
of seething intellect. The Daity
wants to prove in its pages that
this is the case.
We need keen observers to
review books, films and other
cultural events. All that we re
quire is that they write things
people like to read.
Pining for lack of attention
on the editorial editor's desk are
such works as The Pornograph
ers by Akyuki Nozaka and Con
fessions of a Disloyal European
by Jan Myrdal. Come in. Take
one. Read it. Write about it.
