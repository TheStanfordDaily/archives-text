# Draft Counselors Consider Students' Many Alternatives
## 
### DANIEL SNELL 
Wending their ways through
the Kafka-esque maze of the Se
lective Service System, the two
counselors who make up Stan
ford's National Service Office are
not happy with the draft.
"It's a generally undesirable
system," William Leland, former
head of Stern Hall haid. "I'm not
even really convinced that a
draft is necessary; I really don't
have the facts to say."
But Leland and Alan Strain,
who works part of the time with
the Central Committee for Con
scientious Objectors, have facts
about specific draft problems
and alternatives.
Strain says he spends some
of his time dispelling romantic
ideas about going to Canada or
to prison as alternatives to ac
cepting military service.
"Some men think that in pris
on they will have lots of time
to read, write, and think," Strain
said. "But in our experience this
just isn't the way it turns out."
He said many men who opt for
Canada find that after some
time, their exile "begins to eat
at them." Strain tries to get men
thoroughly to consider their de
cisions, no matter what they
choose to do.
Leland and Strain say they
have two purposes as counselors:
1) to supply young men with ac
curate information about the Se

lective Service System, and 2)
to raise "the toughest questions"
in order to get men to consider
their position and futures.
"We're not pushing any par
ticular alternative," Strain said.
"All we want is that the young
man comes to a decision that is
completely his own, that's really
been considered, that isn't ro
mantic."
Now the most prevalent case
brought to the counselors is that
of graduate students who have
recently been reclassified 1-A be
cause of the Selective Service
Act of 1967 that denies defer
ment for graduate study.
Among the intricacies of the
new law are the ambiguities re
sulting from the abolition of the
list of deferrable occupations.
Some draft boards are still using
the government list of occupa
tions and granting deferments.
Others are granting no defer
ments for occupations.
Capricious
"It's up to each board to de
cide this question," Leland said.
"There is broad variation of in
terpretation of the law among
the boards. The situation is very
capricious and confused."
But the counselors say there
are ways in which they can help
men faced with the possibility of
reclassification. Strain said it is
sometimes possible to check into
what the individual draft board

has done in the past as a guide
to helping a man decide what to
do.
"But of course you can't al
ways trust those precedents,"
Strain said.
Some graduate students may
be eligible for a I-SC classifica
tion which defers them through
the end of the quarter or se
mester for which they are reg
istered.
Changes In Lives
Leland said he believed men
tend to come to see the coun
selors when there is a change
in their lives, draft status, or
when they get letters from their
draft boards.
Leland sees about 10 men a
day for varying lengths of time,
depending on their problems.
Strain, who is on campus Wed
nesdays and Thursdays only,
sees from six to eight men daily
at present.
He points out that the work of
the counselors will probably be
heavier in the future.
Failure of present Gl's to re
enlist may boost draft calls to
as high as 340,000 this year. This
means 75,000 men could be call
ed each month — twice the num
ber called in the month with the
highest draft call this year.
And of these men called last
year only about 5 per cent were
college graduates. Next year this
could be as high as 60 per cent.
Some Objection
Strain, who was himself a con
scientious objector during World
War 11, sees men who have
"some real objection or opposi
tion to going into the armed ser
vices." Leland, who was deferred
until he was past the draftable
age, also counsels such men but
also works with others with
Selective Service System prob
lems.
The counselors advise that no
matter what a man's draft sta
tus or plans, he should keep
copies of all correspondence
with his local board.
"If he is going to cooperate
with Selective Service," Strain
said, "he must meet all dead
lines that the local board sets
down. Selective Service is a huge
bureaucracy, and it can easily
loose important correspondence
and sometimes even whole files."
It's also a good idea to go to
the local board and look through
one's file to make sure every
thing is in order.
"One fellow inspected his file
and found someone had mailed
a poison-pen letter about him to
his board, telling the board that
he should be drafted," Strain
said.
Though nothing can be re
moved from a man's file, he is
free to add anything he thinks
would be useful. "In the poison
pen case, the fellow got affi
davits testifying to the fact that
the letter's atllegations were un
true and that it was written from
an address that didn't exist,"
Strain said.

moved from a man's file, he is
free to add anything he thinks
would be useful. "In the poison
pen case, the fellow got affi
davits testifying to the fact that
the letter's atllegations were un
true and that it was written from
an address that didn't exist,"
Strain said.
Wending their ways through
the Kafka-esque maze of the Se
lective Service System, the two
counselors who make up Stan
ford's National Service Office are
not happy with the draft.
"It's a generally undesirable
system," William Leland, former
head of Stern Hall haid. "I'm not
even really convinced that a
draft is necessary; I really don't
have the facts to say."
But Leland and Alan Strain,
who works part of the time with
the Central Committee for Con
scientious Objectors, have facts
about specific draft problems
and alternatives.
Strain says he spends some
of his time dispelling romantic
ideas about going to Canada or
to prison as alternatives to ac
cepting military service.
"Some men think that in pris
on they will have lots of time
to read, write, and think," Strain
said. "But in our experience this
just isn't the way it turns out."
He said many men who opt for
Canada find that after some
time, their exile "begins to eat
at them." Strain tries to get men
thoroughly to consider their de
cisions, no matter what they
choose to do.
Leland and Strain say they
have two purposes as counselors:
1) to supply young men with ac
curate information about the Se

lective Service System, and 2)
to raise "the toughest questions"
in order to get men to consider
their position and futures.
"We're not pushing any par
ticular alternative," Strain said.
"All we want is that the young
man comes to a decision that is
completely his own, that's really
been considered, that isn't ro
mantic."
Now the most prevalent case
brought to the counselors is that
of graduate students who have
recently been reclassified 1-A be
cause of the Selective Service
Act of 1967 that denies defer
ment for graduate study.
Among the intricacies of the
new law are the ambiguities re
sulting from the abolition of the
list of deferrable occupations.
Some draft boards are still using
the government list of occupa
tions and granting deferments.
Others are granting no defer
ments for occupations.
Capricious
"It's up to each board to de
cide this question," Leland said.
"There is broad variation of in
terpretation of the law among
the boards. The situation is very
capricious and confused."
But the counselors say there
are ways in which they can help
men faced with the possibility of
reclassification. Strain said it is
sometimes possible to check into
what the individual draft board

has done in the past as a guide
to helping a man decide what to
do.
"But of course you can't al
ways trust those precedents,"
Strain said.
Some graduate students may
be eligible for a I-SC classifica
tion which defers them through
the end of the quarter or se
mester for which they are reg
istered.
Changes In Lives
Leland said he believed men
tend to come to see the coun
selors when there is a change
in their lives, draft status, or
when they get letters from their
draft boards.
Leland sees about 10 men a
day for varying lengths of time,
depending on their problems.
Strain, who is on campus Wed
nesdays and Thursdays only,
sees from six to eight men daily
at present.
He points out that the work of
the counselors will probably be
heavier in the future.
Failure of present Gl's to re
enlist may boost draft calls to
as high as 340,000 this year. This
means 75,000 men could be call
ed each month — twice the num
ber called in the month with the
highest draft call this year.
And of these men called last
year only about 5 per cent were
college graduates. Next year this
could be as high as 60 per cent.
Some Objection
Strain, who was himself a con
scientious objector during World
War 11, sees men who have
"some real objection or opposi
tion to going into the armed ser
vices." Leland, who was deferred
until he was past the draftable
age, also counsels such men but
also works with others with
Selective Service System prob
lems.
The counselors advise that no
matter what a man's draft sta
tus or plans, he should keep
copies of all correspondence
with his local board.
"If he is going to cooperate
with Selective Service," Strain
said, "he must meet all dead
lines that the local board sets
down. Selective Service is a huge
bureaucracy, and it can easily
loose important correspondence
and sometimes even whole files."
It's also a good idea to go to
the local board and look through
one's file to make sure every
thing is in order.
"One fellow inspected his file
and found someone had mailed
a poison-pen letter about him to
his board, telling the board that
he should be drafted," Strain
said.
Though nothing can be re
moved from a man's file, he is
free to add anything he thinks
would be useful. "In the poison

the local board and look through
one's file to make sure every
thing is in order.
"One fellow inspected his file
and found someone had mailed
a poison-pen letter about him to
his board, telling the board that
he should be drafted," Strain
said.
Though nothing can be re
moved from a man's file, he is
free to add anything he thinks
would be useful. "In the poison
pen case, the fellow got affi
davits testifying to the fact that
the letter's atllegations were un
true and that it was written from
an address that didn't exist,"
Strain said.
Wending their ways through
the Kafka-esque maze of the Se
lective Service System, the two
counselors who make up Stan
ford's National Service Office are
not happy with the draft.
"It's a generally undesirable
system," William Leland, former
head of Stern Hall haid. "I'm not
even really convinced that a
draft is necessary; I really don't
have the facts to say."
But Leland and Alan Strain,
who works part of the time with
the Central Committee for Con
scientious Objectors, have facts
about specific draft problems
and alternatives.
Strain says he spends some
of his time dispelling romantic
ideas about going to Canada or
to prison as alternatives to ac
cepting military service.
"Some men think that in pris
on they will have lots of time
to read, write, and think," Strain
said. "But in our experience this
just isn't the way it turns out."
He said many men who opt for
Canada find that after some
time, their exile "begins to eat
at them." Strain tries to get men
thoroughly to consider their de
cisions, no matter what they
choose to do.
Leland and Strain say they
have two purposes as counselors:
1) to supply young men with ac
curate information about the Se

lective Service System, and 2)
to raise "the toughest questions"
in order to get men to consider
their position and futures.
"We're not pushing any par
ticular alternative," Strain said.
"All we want is that the young
man comes to a decision that is
completely his own, that's really
been considered, that isn't ro
mantic."
Now the most prevalent case
brought to the counselors is that
of graduate students who have
recently been reclassified 1-A be
cause of the Selective Service
Act of 1967 that denies defer
ment for graduate study.
Among the intricacies of the
new law are the ambiguities re
sulting from the abolition of the
list of deferrable occupations.
Some draft boards are still using
the government list of occupa
tions and granting deferments.
Others are granting no defer
ments for occupations.
Capricious
"It's up to each board to de
cide this question," Leland said.
"There is broad variation of in
terpretation of the law among
the boards. The situation is very
capricious and confused."
But the counselors say there
are ways in which they can help
men faced with the possibility of
reclassification. Strain said it is
sometimes possible to check into
what the individual draft board

has done in the past as a guide
to helping a man decide what to
do.
"But of course you can't al
ways trust those precedents,"
Strain said.
Some graduate students may
be eligible for a I-SC classifica
tion which defers them through
the end of the quarter or se
mester for which they are reg
istered.
Changes In Lives
Leland said he believed men
tend to come to see the coun
selors when there is a change
in their lives, draft status, or
when they get letters from their
draft boards.
Leland sees about 10 men a
day for varying lengths of time,
depending on their problems.
Strain, who is on campus Wed
nesdays and Thursdays only,
sees from six to eight men daily
at present.
He points out that the work of
the counselors will probably be
heavier in the future.
Failure of present Gl's to re
enlist may boost draft calls to
as high as 340,000 this year. This
means 75,000 men could be call
ed each month — twice the num
ber called in the month with the
highest draft call this year.
And of these men called last
year only about 5 per cent were
college graduates. Next year this
could be as high as 60 per cent.
Some Objection
Strain, who was himself a con
scientious objector during World
War 11, sees men who have
"some real objection or opposi
tion to going into the armed ser
vices." Leland, who was deferred
until he was past the draftable
age, also counsels such men but
also works with others with
Selective Service System prob
lems.
The counselors advise that no
matter what a man's draft sta
tus or plans, he should keep
copies of all correspondence
with his local board.
"If he is going to cooperate
with Selective Service," Strain
said, "he must meet all dead
lines that the local board sets
down. Selective Service is a huge
bureaucracy, and it can easily
loose important correspondence
and sometimes even whole files."
