# Ralston: 'Wait And See'
## Is Stanford Really That Good? 
### GARY CAVALLI 
Note: The following is an in
terview with Stanford football
coach John Ralston.
Q. Last Saturday's 68-20 win
has triggered a lot of publici
ty, and many fans are won
dering if Stanford is really
that good, if the Indians have
a chance to go to the Rose
Bowl. This may be too early
in the season to ask you,
Coach, but what are your per
sonal thoughts about the
team's potential?

Actually, it's too early in the
season to tell. It's a wait and
see type of thing. We saw things
we liked and things we didn't
like. Oregon will be a tough op
ponent, and after that ball game
we'll be able to evaluate the
team's true strength. Saturday's
game got out of hand so quickly
that we didn't get a chance to
evaluate everything.
Q. Who or what impressed
you the most in Saturday's
game?

Well, Jim Plunkett and Gene
Washington looked very good.
And there were certain things
defensively that we did well.
Don Parish played a good ball
game. As a matter of fact, the
whole first string defensive unit
played very well. They allowed
only two first downs.
Q. What did you notice that
you'll be working on this week
in practice?
The big things on the nega
tive side were our kickoff cov
erage and the protection for our
extra-point and field goal at
tempts. The overall tackling was
not as good as it should have
been. A couple of times Shock
ley made us look bad. Offensive
ly, our backs didn't pick their
holes or hit them as quickly as
they should have.
Q. Do you think the new
rule (which calls for stoppage
of the clock after each first
down) contributed to the high
scoring and long playing time
of Saturday's game?
Well, a lot of things contrib
uted to the time aspect. There
was lots of scoring, and lots of
timeouts. It was a TV game, and
that slowed things up. Thirteen
TD's were scored, and with all
the kickoffs that takes up a lot
of time. The game itself got out
of hand and things snowballed.
Q. One of the team's most

valuable players, Bill Shoe
maker will be lost for the sea
son because of a knee Injury.
What does an injury like this
do to the club's morale, and
what effect will it have in fu
ture b&llgames?
Shoemaker, of course, was a
great team leader, a team play
er. He had a lot of ability and
desire, and contributed a lot to
the team. We hope to replace
him as best we can.
Fortunately for Bill, it was a
real clean ligament break. It
should heal as good as new. He's
in Room 205 of the Stanford
Hospital. I hope some fans can
get up to see him there. He's
coming along fine.
Q. Saturday's opponents will
be the Oregon Ducks. What
have they shown offensively?
They have a great running
back in Claxton Welch, and they
have a pretty good passing
game. Right now their best re
ceiver, Bob Newland, is a doubt
ful starter in Saturday's game
because of a bad ankle sprain.

Q. How strong is Oregon de
fensively?
They're very tough defensive
ly. That's their strength. They
have a scrambling type defense
that is hard to adjust to and
keeps the offense off balance.
Q. So you don't expect to
score 68 points again?
No, I don't. If we get one
more point than they do I'll be
very happy.

Q. What did you notice that
you'll be working on this week
in practice?
The big things on the nega
tive side were our kickoff cov
erage and the protection for our
extra-point and field goal at
tempts. The overall tackling was
not as good as it should have
been. A couple of times Shock
ley made us look bad. Offensive
ly, our backs didn't pick their
holes or hit them as quickly as
they should have.
Q. Do you think the new
rule (which calls for stoppage
of the clock after each first
down) contributed to the high
scoring and long playing time
of Saturday's game?
Well, a lot of things contrib
uted to the time aspect. There
was lots of scoring, and lots of
timeouts. It was a TV game, and
that slowed things up. Thirteen
TD's were scored, and with all
the kickoffs that takes up a lot
of time. The game itself got out
of hand and things snowballed.
Q. One of the team's most

valuable players, Bill Shoe
maker will be lost for the sea
son because of a knee Injury.
What does an injury like this
do to the club's morale, and
what effect will it have in fu
ture b&llgames?
Shoemaker, of course, was a
great team leader, a team play
er. He had a lot of ability and
desire, and contributed a lot to
the team. We hope to replace
him as best we can.
Fortunately for Bill, it was a
real clean ligament break. It
should heal as good as new. He's
in Room 205 of the Stanford
Hospital. I hope some fans can
get up to see him there. He's
coming along fine.
Q. Saturday's opponents will
be the Oregon Ducks. What
have they shown offensively?
They have a great running
back in Claxton Welch, and they
have a pretty good passing
game. Right now their best re
ceiver, Bob Newland, is a doubt
ful starter in Saturday's game
because of a bad ankle sprain.

Q. How strong is Oregon de
fensively?
They're very tough defensive
ly. That's their strength. They
have a scrambling type defense
that is hard to adjust to and
keeps the offense off balance.
Q. So you don't expect to
score 68 points again?
No, I don't. If we get one
more point than they do I'll be
very happy.


COACH RALSTON
Note: The following is an in
terview with Stanford football
coach John Ralston.
Q. Last Saturday's 68-20 win
has triggered a lot of publici
ty, and many fans are won
dering if Stanford is really
that good, if the Indians have
a chance to go to the Rose
Bowl. This may be too early
in the season to ask you,
Coach, but what are your per
sonal thoughts about the
team's potential?

Actually, it's too early in the
season to tell. It's a wait and
see type of thing. We saw things
we liked and things we didn't
like. Oregon will be a tough op
ponent, and after that ball game
we'll be able to evaluate the
team's true strength. Saturday's
game got out of hand so quickly
that we didn't get a chance to
evaluate everything.
Q. Who or what impressed
you the most in Saturday's
game?

Well, Jim Plunkett and Gene
Washington looked very good.
And there were certain things
defensively that we did well.
Don Parish played a good ball
game. As a matter of fact, the
whole first string defensive unit
played very well. They allowed
only two first downs.
