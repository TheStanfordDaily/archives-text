# Stanford Village To Reopen
## 
### EILEEN HALEY 
Plans to reactivate Stanford
Village near Stanford Research
Institute in Menlo Park to pro
vide off-campus housing for stu
dents currently without ade
quate housing were announced
yesterday by University officials.
To discuss and comment on
both the housing situation and
the University's response, the
graduate student union will con
duct a meeting tonight at 7:30

in Engineering Corner, Room
300. All students needing tempo
rary rooms were urged to at
tend by Union President An
drew Moss.
Latest in a series of steps to
solve the lack of housing, the
decision still needs approval
from City of Menlo Park and
San Mateo county health au
thorities.
When approvals are obtained,
applications for the Village will

be accepted starting Thursday
afternoon and some students
may be housed there by the
weekend.
In the meantime, according to
Moss, the union will provide
short term housing in grad stu
dents' homes.
Students already on the wait
ing list for campus residences
are asked to contact the housing
office since some spaces are still
available in University resi
dences.
The crush on housing came as
11,300 students registered at
Stanford Monday and Tuesday.
A tightened market for rental
housing in the mid-peninsula
along with a higher than antici
pated student enroHment were
blamed for the scarcity of ade
quate accommodations.
Questionnaires to determine
student housing needs, distrib
uted to all those registering,
showed 80 were without hous
ing and 163 felt their current
housing was inadequate. Only
1,382 of the more than 11,000
students registering returned
the questionnaire. Of these,
1,139 said their housing was
adequate.
Noting that only 10 per cent
of the registrants returned the
questionnaire, Union spokesmen
Moss and Edward Nelson ques
tioned its accuracy and the way
it was conducted. They specu
lated that if late registrants
were taken into account, over
100 students might need hous
ing.
In all, 11 married students

said they vithout housing
and 45 said they were inade
quately housed. The most fre
quent complaints were the high
cost of housing and location too
far from Stanford.
Married students will have
preference for apartment space,
if reopening of Stanford Village
receives approvals needed from
public authorities.
Among single students, 69
said they had no housing at
registration and 118 said their
accomodations were inadequate.
The reasons most frequently
mentioned were high cost, poor
facilities, and distance from
Stanford.
A total of 80 single rooms off
campus were still listed as
available for rent with the Uni
versity late Tuesday. An addi
tional 20 spaces are available in
campus residences for those al
ready on the University's wait
ing list.
If city and county officials ap
prove, 56 apartments can be
made avai'able promptly at
Stanford Village. Rental rates
would range from $80 to $100
monthly, depending on size, in
cluding utilities stove, refrigera
tor and basic furnishings.
Applications for Stanford Vil
lage will be accepted on a first
come—first-served basis starting
at 1 p.m. Thursday in Room 309
of the Old Student Union. Stu
dents presently without housing
will receive priority over those
who are inadequately housed.
Occupancy would be for a full
academic year.

who are inadequately housed.
Occupancy would be for a full
academic year.
Plans to reactivate Stanford
Village near Stanford Research
Institute in Menlo Park to pro
vide off-campus housing for stu
dents currently without ade
quate housing were announced
yesterday by University officials.
To discuss and comment on
both the housing situation and
the University's response, the
graduate student union will con
duct a meeting tonight at 7:30

in Engineering Corner, Room
300. All students needing tempo
rary rooms were urged to at
tend by Union President An
drew Moss.
Latest in a series of steps to
solve the lack of housing, the
decision still needs approval
from City of Menlo Park and
San Mateo county health au
thorities.
When approvals are obtained,
applications for the Village will

be accepted starting Thursday
afternoon and some students
may be housed there by the
weekend.
In the meantime, according to
Moss, the union will provide
short term housing in grad stu
dents' homes.
Students already on the wait
ing list for campus residences
are asked to contact the housing
office since some spaces are still
available in University resi
dences.
The crush on housing came as
11,300 students registered at
Stanford Monday and Tuesday.
A tightened market for rental
housing in the mid-peninsula
along with a higher than antici
pated student enroHment were
blamed for the scarcity of ade
quate accommodations.
Questionnaires to determine
student housing needs, distrib
uted to all those registering,
showed 80 were without hous
ing and 163 felt their current
housing was inadequate. Only
1,382 of the more than 11,000
students registering returned
the questionnaire. Of these,
1,139 said their housing was
adequate.
Noting that only 10 per cent
of the registrants returned the
questionnaire, Union spokesmen
Moss and Edward Nelson ques
tioned its accuracy and the way
it was conducted. They specu
lated that if late registrants
were taken into account, over
100 students might need hous
ing.
In all, 11 married students

said they vithout housing
and 45 said they were inade
quately housed. The most fre
quent complaints were the high
cost of housing and location too
far from Stanford.
Married students will have
preference for apartment space,
if reopening of Stanford Village
receives approvals needed from
public authorities.
Among single students, 69
said they had no housing at
registration and 118 said their
accomodations were inadequate.
The reasons most frequently
mentioned were high cost, poor
facilities, and distance from
Stanford.
A total of 80 single rooms off
campus were still listed as
available for rent with the Uni
versity late Tuesday. An addi
tional 20 spaces are available in
campus residences for those al
ready on the University's wait
ing list.
If city and county officials ap
prove, 56 apartments can be
made avai'able promptly at
Stanford Village. Rental rates
would range from $80 to $100
monthly, depending on size, in
cluding utilities stove, refrigera
tor and basic furnishings.
Applications for Stanford Vil
lage will be accepted on a first
come—first-served basis starting
at 1 p.m. Thursday in Room 309
of the Old Student Union. Stu
dents presently without housing
will receive priority over those
who are inadequately housed.
