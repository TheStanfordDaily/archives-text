## 'Barber': A Happy Event 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
What is the greatest comic
opera? With the current produc
tion of "The Barber of Seville"
by Rossini, the San Francisco
Opera has come close to ending
the too-often mirthless debate
over this question. And this is
not surprising, for a specially
gifted cast has been convened to
celebrate this year of the Rossini
centennial.
"The Barber" is decidedly not
for the opera connoisseur who
likes his sentiments high-flown
and his humor — if have it he
must — nobly and eruditely ex
pressed. (For that, one must
turn to Mozart's "Marriage of
Figaro" — a sequel to the story
of the rollicking, ingenuous
"Barber.")
Instead, "The Barber of Se
ville" is what might be called a
situation comedy; it is one mad
little imbroglio after another,
each calling for galumphing
about, shameless mugging and
much pratfalling. Count Alma
viva falls in love with a pretty
ward, and the opera follows the
harrowing, hilarious romance be
hind the back of her guardian,
Dr. Bartolo. Figaro, the know
it-all barber of Seville, presides
over all the chicanery with re
sourcefulness and bravado.
The source of the great good
humor of "The Barber" is th
shameless self-esteem which vi
talizes each character. Appropri
ate come-uppances abound in
this opera; the puffed chest gets
an elbow, and the stately poseur
is jellified by a sudden twist of
the plot.
"The Barber" demands a con
certed effort, and a better en
semble than the one present Sat
urday night could not be wished
for. Teresa Berganza made a
pert and suitably vain Rosina,
but the real joy was her melli
fluous coloratura voice. Her
creamy, effortless roulades and
faultless phrasing explain why
Berganza is considered the finest
bel canto mezzo-soprano in th
world.
Swedish baritone Ingvar Wix
ell's Figaro was broadly sung
and acted. In his rush through
the famous "largo al factotum"
diction was thrown to the four
winds, but the audience didn't
mind. His voice remained swar

thy and well-managed through
out.
Wixell's mushy Italian mighi
have passed unnoticed but for
the presence of two masterly
Italian basses. Renato Capecchi,
a veteran of 258 roles, made a
bumptious, apoplectic Dr. Bar
tolo. His voice may finally be
declining, but his artistic intelli
gence and stage presence are
still quite imposing. His San
Francisco debut is perhaps only
twenty years overdue.
Nicola Rossi-Lemeni's Don
Basilio owes a great debt to the
classic Italian comic tradition of
Harlequin and Pantalone — a
fine buffo stock character. Basi
lio was just perfect as a menac
ing yet somehow quite harmless
old rascal. Rossi-Lemeni's dark,
thick bass lent itself perfectly
to his major aria.
Pietro Bottazzo's tenor in the
Count's role was marvelously
tender and supple; his voice is

a very "heady," airy one. The
difficult embellishments of the
Count's role caused Bottazzo no
difficulty.
The setting — a three-story
villa with walls that slide away
to give a doll-house effect — is
superbly conceived, and is very
conducive to the hustle and
bustle of Ghita Hager's stage
direction. One might quarrel
with much of the previous stag
business Hager invents, but per
haps it is necessary to make
this comic masterpiece laugh
able for those in the audience
who don't know Italian and who
thought to read the synopsis
only as the houselight dimmed.
(Why don't Americans insist on
opera in their native tongue —
like the sensible Germans?)
This season's "Barber" is a
very happy event which will be
repeated on tonight and on Sun
day afternoon, September 29.
