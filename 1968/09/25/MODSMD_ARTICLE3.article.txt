central campus area is nearing
completion at Stanford.
The $1 million project is ex
pected to provide dust-free,
germ-free, even-temperatured air
for portions of five campus build
ings now under construction —
Space Engineering, Earth Sci
ences, Jordan Hall, the Art
Building, and the Maples Pavi

money in the long run because
of the centralization of its power
source and its ability to provide
design diversification, according

planner and project coordinator.
The University's power plant
on the west end of the campus,
which generates steam for
winter heating, will also provide
the pumping, circulation and
cooling of the chilled water.
The system requires two pipe
lines, one to send out the chilled
water and the other to return it
to he plant for cooling.

The installation, which has
caused the upheaval of Serra
Street from the power plant to
the Maples Pavilion on the east,
is expected to be in operation by
Dec. 1.
