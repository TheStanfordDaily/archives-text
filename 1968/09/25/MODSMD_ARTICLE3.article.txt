# Water To Soothe Campus Buildings
## 
### 
Installation of a chilled water
circulating system which will air
condition certain buildings in the
central campus area is nearing
completion at Stanford.
The $1 million project is ex
pected to provide dust-free,
germ-free, even-temperatured air
for portions of five campus build
ings now under construction —
Space Engineering, Earth Sci
ences, Jordan Hall, the Art
Building, and the Maples Pavi
lion.
Cost of the enterprise will be
taken out of the cost of each
building. The project will save
money in the long run because
of the centralization of its power
source and its ability to provide
design diversification, according

to John Lerry, senior University
planner and project coordinator.
The University's power plant
on the west end of the campus,
which generates steam for
winter heating, will also provide
the pumping, circulation and
cooling of the chilled water.
The system requires two pipe
lines, one to send out the chilled
water and the other to return it
to he plant for cooling.
Serra St. Upheaved
The installation, which has
caused the upheaval of Serra
Street from the power plant to
the Maples Pavilion on the east,
is expected to be in operation by
Dec. 1.
The system will have the lar
gest cooling tower in California
made from ceramic materials.
The pipeline is fitted with a new
type of material made from a
glass, fibre - reinforced plastic
mortar called "Techite."
Pipe sections are so light they
can be handled by two men. The
pipe requires no cutting and
joints axe glued, not welded.
Both cooling tower and pipelines
are completely rust- and corro
sion-free.
The cooling tower is 25 feet
high, has a clay-tile core, and
carries two 16-foot exhaust fans
|o disperse vapor and speed
cooling.
As funds permit, the air-con
ditioning loop will be extended
around the perimeter of the cam
pus. Phase Two will include air
conditioned portions of the new
Law School, the Medical School,
Cowell Health Center, and the
High Energy Physics Labora
tory.

At the building to be served,
the chilled water circulates
through coils over which air is
forced, maintaining a pre-set "en
vironmental control." This pro
longs the lives of books in the
libraries, provides pure filtered
air for laboratories, and cools
large classrooms and interior
spaces.
Maples Pavilion was included
because, in addition to basket
ball, it will be used for many
other large-scale indoor campus
events — including summertime
use when the Peninsula climate
is not quite so benign, Lerry ex
plained.
Campus buildings which now
have their own independent air
conditioning system, such as the
Graduate School of Business, the
Hoover Institution, and the Un
dergraduate Library will be con
nected to the all-University sys
tem when their own equipment
wears out or becomes too costly
to maintain.

through coils over which air is
forced, maintaining a pre-set "en
vironmental control." This pro
longs the lives of books in the
libraries, provides pure filtered
air for laboratories, and cools
large classrooms and interior
spaces.
Maples Pavilion was included
because, in addition to basket
ball, it will be used for many
other large-scale indoor campus
events — including summertime
use when the Peninsula climate
is not quite so benign, Lerry ex
plained.
Campus buildings which now
have their own independent air
conditioning system, such as the
Graduate School of Business, the
Hoover Institution, and the Un
dergraduate Library will be con
nected to the all-University sys
tem when their own equipment
wears out or becomes too costly
to maintain.
Installation of a chilled water
circulating system which will air
condition certain buildings in the
central campus area is nearing
completion at Stanford.
The $1 million project is ex
pected to provide dust-free,
germ-free, even-temperatured air
for portions of five campus build
ings now under construction —
Space Engineering, Earth Sci
ences, Jordan Hall, the Art
Building, and the Maples Pavi
lion.
Cost of the enterprise will be
taken out of the cost of each
building. The project will save
money in the long run because
of the centralization of its power
source and its ability to provide
design diversification, according

to John Lerry, senior University
planner and project coordinator.
The University's power plant
on the west end of the campus,
which generates steam for
winter heating, will also provide
the pumping, circulation and
cooling of the chilled water.
The system requires two pipe
lines, one to send out the chilled
water and the other to return it
to he plant for cooling.
Serra St. Upheaved
The installation, which has
caused the upheaval of Serra
Street from the power plant to
the Maples Pavilion on the east,
is expected to be in operation by
Dec. 1.
The system will have the lar
gest cooling tower in California
made from ceramic materials.
The pipeline is fitted with a new
type of material made from a
glass, fibre - reinforced plastic
mortar called "Techite."
Pipe sections are so light they
can be handled by two men. The
pipe requires no cutting and
joints axe glued, not welded.
Both cooling tower and pipelines
are completely rust- and corro
sion-free.
The cooling tower is 25 feet
high, has a clay-tile core, and
carries two 16-foot exhaust fans
|o disperse vapor and speed
cooling.
As funds permit, the air-con
ditioning loop will be extended
around the perimeter of the cam
pus. Phase Two will include air
conditioned portions of the new
Law School, the Medical School,
Cowell Health Center, and the
High Energy Physics Labora
tory.

At the building to be served,
the chilled water circulates
through coils over which air is
forced, maintaining a pre-set "en
vironmental control." This pro
longs the lives of books in the
libraries, provides pure filtered
air for laboratories, and cools
large classrooms and interior
spaces.
