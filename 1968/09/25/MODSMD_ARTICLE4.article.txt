# Ford Funds Establish 'Academic Statesmen'
## 
### 
An "academic statesmen" pro
gram for talented young faculty
members will begin this fall un
der a new $1 million grant by
the Ford Foundation.
The program will give special
ly chosen faculty members the
chance to tackle University-wide
problems and to develop educa
tional innovations.
The University will seek an
additional $200,000 in private
matching funds for this Univer
sity Fellows program, a unique
effort to focus faculty attention
on means of strengthening their
institution and improving their
programs.
Two or three young faculty
members will be chosen annual
ly to serve three-year terms as
"Fellows of the University." Re
lieved of all normal departmen
tal assignments, each Fellow
will devote half-time to univer
sity service and half-time to his
own development as a teacher
and scholar.
Given Varied Responsibilities
All University Fellows would
serve on an advisory group con
cerned with the development
and evaluation of new educa
tional programs at Stanford. Su
pervised by Vice-Provost Her

bert L. Packer, this group will
draw on the services of an Aca
demic Planning Office, to be or
ganized during 1968-69.
In addition to this role, typi
cal assignments for service
might include directing a dem
onstration housing unit, where
students shsfre at least one
course in common; helping stu
dent-faculty committees on a va
riety of university problems; or
working on special projects with
senior officers of the university.
According to Packer, develop
er of the program, giving young
faculty members "a sense of ed
ucational power" through devel
oping and evaluating new pro
grams which cut across normal
departmental lines can be "the
key factor in cultivating loyalty
to the institution as a whole."
Packer stated that the pro
gram would help young faculty
members obtain tenure because
it "would leave them with more
time to pursue their own schol
arly interests."
Students Can Nominate
Deans and Department Heads
are being urged by Acting Pres
ident Glaser to send nomina
tions to Professor Packer of po
tential University Fellows whom
Glaser described as giving

"promise of becoming not only
distinguished scholars but also
'academic statesmen'." Individ
ual faculty members are able to
apply directly to Professor
Packer. Students are also urged
to submit nominations.
President-Designate Kenneth
S. Pitzer stated he was "most
enthusiastic" about the new pro
gram which closely parallels
many of the ideas expressed by
the Rice University president in
public talks.
During the first five years of
the new program, a total of thir
teen University fellows would
be chosen. Approximately half
the funds would be used to meet
their salary and related ex
penses, while the rest would pro
vide "venture capital" for ex
perimental academic programs.
"In recent grants," comment
ed Marshall Robinson, the Ford
Foundation officer for higher
education, . . the Foundation
has assisted student and faculty
efforts to break new ground in
the structure and concepts of
higher education. With these
grants . . . [like the one at Stan
ford] we are seeking to support
similar promising attempts by
university administrations them
selves."

be chosen. Approximately half
the funds would be used to meet
their salary and related ex
penses, while the rest would pro
vide "venture capital" for ex
perimental academic programs.
"In recent grants," comment
ed Marshall Robinson, the Ford
Foundation officer for higher
education, . . the Foundation
has assisted student and faculty
efforts to break new ground in

An "academic statesmen" pro
gram for talented young faculty
members will begin this fall un
der a new $1 million grant by
the Ford Foundation.
The program will give special
ly chosen faculty members the
chance to tackle University-wide
problems and to develop educa
tional innovations.
The University will seek an
additional $200,000 in private
matching funds for this Univer
sity Fellows program, a unique
effort to focus faculty attention
on means of strengthening their
institution and improving their
programs.
Two or three young faculty
members will be chosen annual
ly to serve three-year terms as
"Fellows of the University." Re
lieved of all normal departmen
tal assignments, each Fellow
will devote half-time to univer
sity service and half-time to his
own development as a teacher
and scholar.
Given Varied Responsibilities
All University Fellows would
serve on an advisory group con
cerned with the development
and evaluation of new educa
tional programs at Stanford. Su
pervised by Vice-Provost Her

bert L. Packer, this group will
draw on the services of an Aca
demic Planning Office, to be or
ganized during 1968-69.
In addition to this role, typi
cal assignments for service
might include directing a dem
onstration housing unit, where
students shsfre at least one
course in common; helping stu
dent-faculty committees on a va
riety of university problems; or
working on special projects with
senior officers of the university.
According to Packer, develop
er of the program, giving young
faculty members "a sense of ed
ucational power" through devel
oping and evaluating new pro
grams which cut across normal
departmental lines can be "the
key factor in cultivating loyalty
to the institution as a whole."
Packer stated that the pro
gram would help young faculty
members obtain tenure because
it "would leave them with more
time to pursue their own schol
arly interests."
Students Can Nominate
Deans and Department Heads
are being urged by Acting Pres
ident Glaser to send nomina
tions to Professor Packer of po
tential University Fellows whom
Glaser described as giving

"promise of becoming not only
distinguished scholars but also
'academic statesmen'." Individ
ual faculty members are able to
apply directly to Professor
Packer. Students are also urged
to submit nominations.
President-Designate Kenneth
S. Pitzer stated he was "most
enthusiastic" about the new pro
gram which closely parallels
many of the ideas expressed by
the Rice University president in
public talks.
During the first five years of
the new program, a total of thir
teen University fellows would
be chosen. Approximately half
the funds would be used to meet
their salary and related ex
penses, while the rest would pro
vide "venture capital" for ex
