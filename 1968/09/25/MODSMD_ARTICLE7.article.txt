# Replacement For Grantham
## Walker Negotiating For British Site 
### BILL EVERS 
Cliveden, the long-time lordly
manor the English branch
of the Astor family, lies along
the Thames river about midway
between London and Oxford.
No longer the home of the
Astors, the Cliveden estate may
become the new home of Stan
ford-in-Britain. Stanford-in-Brit
ain is now at Harlaxton Manor
near Grantham.
Dr. Robert Walker, the direc
tor of Stanford's overseas cam
puses program, is currently in
Europe on one of his tours, in
the course of which he reported
ly headquarters himself in such
luxury hotels as the Vier Jahre
sxeiten in Hamburg and the Im
perial in Vienna. He is at pres
ent in Britain and is negotiating
with the publically-owned Na
tional Trust which has charge of
the Cliveden estate.

Walker's assistant, George
Hamrdla, said yesterday in a
Daily interview that nothing def
inite will be known about the
move for "a month or two." He
added that the chances that any
decision on Cliveden would af
fect Britain VII, which leaves in
January, "are so small that we
are sort of discounting them at
the moment."
Applications for all overseas
campus groups leaving in June
and September will be available
October 7 in the overseas cam
puses office on Quad.
Hamrdla said that he had seen
Cliveden this summer from the
outside. It has a swimming pool
and tennis courts. He views a
move to Cliveden as advanta
geous from an educational
standpoint because of the easy
access to London and Oxford.

For example, it is 40 minutes
from the nearby Taplow rail
way station to London, as com
pared with an hour and 40 min
utes by the fastest train from
Grantham.
"Chateau Problem"
Some persons have criticized
a move to Cliveden on the
grounds that it increases what
might be termed the "chateau
problem." Last May in a satiric
column for The Daily, Tim
Haight described Stanford-in-
France as an island of rich
Americans amid the swirling
"evenments" of last spring.
A "chateau problem" was said
to have existed when Stanford
in-Austria was in the Semmer
ing. There the august trappings
and ritzy reputation of the Ho
tel Panhans discouraged some
of the local population from

casua'ly associating with Stan
ford students.
The last two generations of
Astors who inhabited Cliveden
helped make the family estate a
famous symbol of the failings of
England's Establishment.
It was the gathering place of
members of the "Cliveden set"
who are said to have influenced
the British foreign policy which
led to Munich. It was the site of
the Profumo affair of 1963.
At Cliveden in the time just
before World War 11, Lord and
Lady Astor were hosts to a so
cially prominent circle of friends
which became known as the
"Cliveden set." The Cliveden set
included men like Arnold Toyn
bee, Sir Thomas Inskip, and
Lord Lothian.
They were united in their anti-
French attitudes and their dis
like of the Foreign Office's Lord

Vansittart, who had said he
hated "the bloody-minded bu'k"
of al 1 Germans. The Cliveden set
was actually not significantly in
fluential in foreign policy deci
sion-making. But its dispositions
and prejudices are said to
have been indicative of the dis
positions and prejudices of En
gland's Establishment.
Profiimo Scandal
In 1963, John Profumo, Brit
ain's War Minister, was the fo
cus of a scandal which rocked
the British government. Since
1955, Dr. Stephen Ward, osteo
path and procurer, had had a
country cottage on the Clived?n
estate which he leased from his
friend and patient Lord Astor.
To this cottage came Profu
mo, the "models" — Christine
Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies,
and an assistant Soviet naval at
tache, Captain Eugene Ivanov.


GRANTHAM — Robert Walker, head of the Overseas Campus pro
pragm, is now in Britain negotiating with the British government
to move the British campus from bucolic Grantham, shown above,
to the aristocratic Astor estate outside London.
