## TOP SECRET 
### 
Stanford is a secretive place.
Contemplated changes in general studies re
quirements, fallout shelter policy, and admis
sions committee structure have not been dis
cussed in public. They remain backroom whis
pers until they are presented as policy.
Recently some Academic Senate committee
chairmen have agreed to send their committee
minutes to The Daily in an effort toward more
communication. We find this a hopeful trend.
However, the recent move by the Academic
Senate to close their meetings to the press is dis
appointing.
In the past, the press has not been allowed to
cover meetings of the Academic Council. Now
we are told, "arrangements have been made to
get you the news" through the Stanford News
Service.
The reasons for The Daily's exclusion from
these meetings was most recently expressed in an
October 19, 1966, letter from Ernest R. Hilgard,
psychology professor and member of executive
committee of the Academic Council, to a Daily
associate editor:
". . . . It was felt that it would be awkward to
open the meetings regularly to the public press
including the Stanford Daily partly because it
would be hard to favor the Stanford Daily over
other reporters who might be interested.
"... .it might protect the privacy of those who
stood on one side or another side of certain is
sues."
We take issue with both these positions.
First, faculty meetings generally do not deal
with burning issues. To accommodate the small
number of reporters who might conceivably be
present would not be a difficult task. The more
controversial and fiery meetings, such as the
Academic Council meeting following last
spring's sit-in would attract more press repre
sentatives.

But a controversy or discord is no reason to
exclude the press. To hide the turmoil, bitter
ness, or divisiveness of a meeting is to spread
500 individualized accounts across the campus.
Secondly, there is no privacy for a faculty
member who speaks or votes in a legislative
body. The people who request a roll call vote to
examine the votes of individuals, those who dis
cuss and report the personal actions of profes
sors, and those individuals who thrive on the
power politics of departments, schools, and com
mittees destroy an individual's privacy.
The wounds opened during last springs' sit-in
debate are only beginning to heal.
Recently, the vice chairman of the new Aca
demic Senate, Religion Prof. William Clebsch
has offered another rationale for exclusion. He
tells us that normal meetings of the Senate are
only open to members of the Academic Council
and this is a liberalization of an older policy.
He cites the fact that meetings of the Academ
ic Council's Executive Committee were closed
to everyone except the committee members and
says that "the Senate is a substitution for the old
Executive Committee."
We take exception with Prof. Clebsch, how
ever, and feel that Article I, Section A of the
Senate Charter is relevant here:
"There is established a Senate of the Academic
Council which . . . shall have the same functions
as the Academic Council."
The quarterly meetings of the Academic
Council and the new Senate should both be open
to the press.
We strongly urge the Academic Senate to re
consider its action and allow representatives of
the press to attend their meetings.
With the campus already torn with threats of
disorder, to expose the decision-making process
es to journalistic inquiry would surely be a move
toward a more healthy, open community.
