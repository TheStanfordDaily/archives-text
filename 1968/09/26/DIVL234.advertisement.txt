Like to meet a rich giri ?
What better place to meet a
rich girl than in a bank? It's
only natural.
Why don't you come over and
look around. We can't promise
anything, but you never know.
And while you're there, look
into some of the financial
services you'll be needing.
If you'll come down between
now and October 4th, we'll
have something extra for you:
FREE Personalized Checks for all Stanford
students who open a personal
checking account.
FREE Calendar Notebooks for every
Stanford student to keep track
of "dates."
EXTRA Banking Hours: daily from 9 'til 5,
and, as usual, we're open 'til 6
on Fridays.
Where it's at â€” UCB is in
