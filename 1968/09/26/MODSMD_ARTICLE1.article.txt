# Grads Strive To Defer Draft
## 
### DENNIS PERLUSS 
Despite dire predictions made
last spring of massive vacancies
in graduate schools as a result
of the new draft laws, the cur
rent regulations have had only
a minor effect on most graduate
schools and divisions.
According to William L. Le
land, Senior Counselor for Spe
cial Services, the fact that a
substantial change in enrollment
has not yet materialized may be
accounted for by three rea
sons:
• There have been low draft
calls through November.
• Local boards must process
huge amounts of paper, and vir
tually all boards are consider
ably behind schedule due to
bureaucratic inefficiency.
• Registrants who have been
reclassified are expressing their
appeal rights. These appeals can
take, on the average, between
2V2 to 4V& months to complete
during which time the registrant
cannot be inducted.
Of the 2,431 men admitted as
first year graduate students at
Stanford this year (excluding
the schools of law, medicine, and
business), only 89, slightly more
than 3V2 per cent, are currently
serving military terms. Most of
these men enlisted rather than
waiting to be called in the draft.
Another 28 men who planned

to start graduate school here
in the fall went into industry
to secure an occupational 2-A
deferment because of the fear
of the draft.
Leland emphasized, however,
that as draft calls become higher
toward the end of the year and
as appeal rights run out, the
effect of the new law will be
felt, quite possibly in as disas
trous proportions as were first
feared.
First and second year gradu
ate students in all areas except
medicine and the ministry find
themselves in this condition of
uncertain expectancy because of
the current draft law which de
clares that all men who began
their graduate work after June
30, 1967, are not eligible for a
2-S student deferment.
Students who began their
graduate work in autumn 1967,
however, were given one-year
deferments terminating in Sep
tember or early October 1968.
Some boards nevertheless began
reclassifying these students this
summer. Virtually all have been
or will be given their 1-As by
October joining this year's be
ginning graduate students in the
tortuous process of appeals and
nervous waiting.
Law School Suffered
The School of Law suffered
heavier losses than other grad

uate divisions at the University.
Of an entering first year class
of 187 between 25 and 30 men
who had definitely committed
themselves to coming to Stan
ford withdrew for draft-related
reasons. Many of these men,
though, like many other poten
tial draftees throughout the
country, decided to enlist rather
than wait to be called.
The admissions office estimat
ed that twelve law studenu. of
140 who completed their first
year of school last June did not
return this fall because of the
draft.
William Eads, a second year
law student from Lee's Summit,
Missouri, did return along with
120 fellow students. Eads, who
is married, has been reclassified
1-A following the expiration of
his one-year deferment. He did
not, however, appeal this classi
fication. He instead applied for
a commission in the Judge Ad
vocate General's staff and also
submitted an application for reg
ular Officer's Candidate School.
He was rejected by both pro
grams.
All that Eads, as well as many
young men across the nation,
can do now is wait. He has al
ready completed his pre-induc
tion physical. Although his local
board informed him that he
would be inducted in August,
September at the latest, it now
appears that he will be able to
finish this semester at the law
school.
Eads considered refusing to go
when called, but he decided that
he could not honestly say that
he had moral objections that
were that strong. Instead, his
last hope appears to be the only
slight possibility that an opening
in a reserve unit will develop
before he is served with his final
papers.
Confusion Reigns
The case of one graduate stu
dent in his second year of work
in statistics at Stanford is more
complex and more unusual. Af
ter finishing a special program
designed to allow completion of
the master's degree four years
after entrance as a freshman at
an eastern institution, a transfer
to Stanford was arranged. Such
a transfer was made necessary
by a switch in major from math
ematics to statistics.
Following a mix-up over
whether or not he was carrying
a full load at Stanford, his diait
board re-evaluated his 2-S and
decided not to consider his last

year of work in the four-yea*
program as graduate work. As a
result of this new evaluation,
the board decided to reclassify
him 1-A since he had begun his
graduate work (at Stanford) af
ter June 1967. An application for
appeal followed, but so did a
notification to appear for a pre
induction physical.
The physical examination re
sulted in a 1-Y deferment be
cause of a recently acquired
£>ver-weight problem and be
cause of a marijuana-induced
.high blood pressure. A 1-Y is
given to registrants found under
current physical, mental, and
moral standards to be unaccept
able. No other action on the re
quest for appeal followed.
After consulting with his
board, the student discovered
that they considered the 1-Y re
classification as adequately an
swering his appeal. The student
contends, however, that this re
classification was a result of a
physical examination and should
not affect his appeal for a con
tinuation of a 2-S deferment. He
has been forced to appeal his
1-Y, in effect appealing for the
right to appeal.
Local Board Anxious
Andrew D. Cohen, a Ph.D.
candidate in developmental ed
ucation, is another second year
graduate student who has re
ceived a 1-A reclassification from
his local board (located in Great
Neck, Long Island). Cohen grad
uated from college in 1965 and
spent two years in the Peace
Corps before coming to the Stan
ford International Development
Education Center (SIDEC).
At the time of his acceptance
to Stanford both his local board
and SIDEC told him his Peace
Corps work would be considered
as work on a master's degree.
He was granted a 2-S deferment
which he kept until Spring quar
ter 1968, when he took one quar
ter off from formal classes to
do field research.
His local board apparently did
not consider as relevant data let
ters written by SIDEC profes
sors saying the research was im
portant for his studies, bro
chures from SIDEC which ex
plained that such research is a
normal part of the studies of
its students, or the fact that the
research was done by the Stan
ford Research Institute under
government contract as part of
the Presidential Task Force on «
Communication Policy.


WILLIAM L. LELAND, Senior Counselor for Special Services, -feels
that the effect of the new draft law will not be felt until the begin
ning of next year.
Because of the agreement con
cerning his Peace Corps experi
ence, Cohen had not anticipated
facing the problems the more
usual second year students face.
Once reclassified 1-A, though, he
appealed and asked for a per
sonal appearance before his
board.
Cohen stated that his board
seemed uninterested in the im
portance of his studies or in
previous informal agreements
between himself and the board
which would grant him his 2-S
until June 1970. Instead the pre
dominant attitude of his local
board was, "When are you going
to do your military duty, son?"
Cohen's appeal was denied;
and he has appealed to the State
Board, concurrently requesting

that jurisdiction over his case
be transferred from New York
to California. That appeal is
pending.
What do these graduate stu
dents think about this law which
keeps them in a state of ner
vous anticipation while threaten
ing to change their entire life
pattern? William Eads expressed
his opinion: "Such a system al
lows no one to plan his life
rationally."
