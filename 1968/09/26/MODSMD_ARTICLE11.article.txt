## Debate On Presidential Selection 
### 
Student Power
Jruiltor, The Daily:
What in the name of God did
he faculty and administration
;>f Stanford University have in
mind when they passively ac
cepted the appointment of K. S.
Pitzer as the new President!
Any notion that the members
ol Stanford's educational estab
lishment wish to share decision
making power in the University
w h students must be discount
v in the face of the gross lack
, any student voice in select
ing this man.
i sut the issue of student power
when Pitzer's character is
anized. The man is not even
*1 educator or a humanist, let
a. ne the progressive, education
nted leader needed by Stan
i's administrative and fac
ulty communities. Pitzer has ap
parently been brought to Stan
ford by the Board of Trustees
to further our institution's al
ready infamous liaisons with the
voi-.pace industry and the mili
y, and to continue to build
lilth which is the Stanford
R , parch Institute's programs in
v unter - insurgency and chemi
iological warfare.
112 urther, in our times of ra
tension, we are presented
vi ill a man who ran a lily-white
c< ipus at Rice University un
t forced by the pressures of fed
• al research grants to begin
t <en integration. Scarcely the
v ionary leadership necessary
tc promote the far-ranging pro
fc. «m of minority enrollment and
a ci at Stanford domanded by the
black students.
K. S. Pitzer, if not a fact,
would pass as a grotesque joke
a.*? Stanford's president. By ap
pointing this paradigm of the
•; Mical status quo, Stanford's
ti istees have reacted directly
against the spirit shown by stu
dents and a few faculty last
swing — a spirit proclaiming
at the institution at which
v» seek our education must
sMve to cease to be racist and
must begin to concentrate on the
|rople of Stanford and end the
participation in the govern
rr ntal programs which hold half
the world in chains reading
"Made in America by Stanford's
Craftsmen."
During last year I participated
: n formulating, in the Committee
of Fifteen, plans for a shared
government of faculty and stu

dents over the rules governing
students' lives. My assumptions
during our long discussions were
two: 1) that faculty are men of
good will and admirable values;
and 2) that students, if govern
ing their own lives in the univer
sity, would be somehow more
"free." For a variety of reasons
I abstained from our commit
tee's final vote on the proposals;
I chose not to give my voice by
urging their acceptance or their
defeat. Now, since Pitzer's ap
pointment, I feel that both of
my fundamental assumptions
are false. That the faculty would
accept this man robs me of my
last grain of faith in the ability
or the desire of the vast ma
jority of them to express dis
gust with Stanford's political
status quo and the present role
of students in governing the uni
versity. It was a deep and abid
ing faith and hard to kill. And
I believe now that no man can
be free in an institution which
is so single-mindedly in pur
suit of world oppression as is
Stanford. Break the rules! Don't
make new ones that must be
sanctioned by a man like K. S.
Pitzer.
My lesson was a long one in
the learning. Let the behavior
of Stanford in accepting the
choice of Pitzer teach us all that
this is an institution that will
not heal itself, while it continues
vigorously to oppress people
around the world and at home
in America. It must be trans
formed by those of you still
vaguely free from the paralyz
ing status quo which has frozen
our "adult" community into si
lence.
DELL MARTIN '68
• Pro Pitzer
Editor, The Daily:
I have read with increasing
irritation your views, as ex
pressed in The Stanford Obser

ver, about the appointment of
Kenneth S. Pitzer as the new
president of Stanford. You have
evidently "condemned the lack
of student involvement in Pit
zer's selection" and have made
other comments which suggest
you should have been accorded
the opportunity to "research"
him, been "granted access to his
file", and that you feel such
lacks represent "a gross abuse
by the Stanford trustees of the
legal power vested in them."
What makes you think that
the students of any educational
institution have a legitimate role
to play in the selection of its
president? Or, for that matter,
of any of the faculty? Or in de
termining the policies under
which the institution is run?
The students are here today,
and for a relatively brief time;
why should you, who happen to
be here today, and possibly agi
tating somewhere else tomor
row, be allowed a voice in the
selection of people and policies
for a constantly changing flow
of young people?
Should next quarter's stu
dents be allowed to over-rule
you and throw out your choice;
and the following quarter's stu
dents return them or bring in
still others? The result would
be chaos, which is what, it is
becoming more apparant, you
and a small group of hard-core
troublemaking "students" seem
to want.
The undue attention which the
press and television (and, in this
case, unfortunately, the Obser
ver) has given to "student re
volt" of one sort or another has
served, of course, to encourage
more and more of such stuff and
must be very flattering, tempo
rarily, to your egos.
But what I am not sure you
really understand is that, along
with the momentary glamor and
attention and "importance"
there is an inescapable opening
of the eyes on the part of the

great mass of people, revealing
the "revolting students" and
their usually absurd notions for
what they really are—revolting
and absurd.
Do you really think your for
mer hippie student body presi
dent (I have forgotten his name)
or any of the obviously commu
nistically inclined "student" agi
tators at the University of Cali
fornia (some of whom, incredi
bly, were subsequently allowed
to enter Stanford) had anything
worthwhile to contribute to the
cause of education, or that their
motives were basically honest?
If you do, it may come as a
shock to you some day in the
future, when and if you attain
the education you are supposed

ly seeking and it has jelled
awhile, to learn that the vast
majority of that contemptible
mob, "the public", do not.
I suppose, simply because you
have made some asinine re
marks upon a limited aspect of
the educational process, that you
are not necessarily of the red
hot agitator stripe, but it tends
to suggest that you are or may
become so.
I suggest that if you do not
care for rules and regulations
and the process of law and or
der that you enroll in some oth
er school, and get the hell out
of Stanford; or else recognize
that you are a student there to
learn, not to teach.
