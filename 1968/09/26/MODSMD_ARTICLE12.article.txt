# Pavilion Completion Delayed Until January
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
Completion of the new Roscoe
Maples Sports Pavilion, original
ly scheduled for mid-October has
been moved back to early Jan
uary according to Athletic Direc
tor Chuck Taylor.
The pavilion, the first phase in
a multi-stage plan to move the
collegiate athletic program to
one central location bordered by
Galvez and Campus Drive, en
countered several difficulties
during construction since ground
was broken and will not be
ready for the varsity basketball
opener against Northwestern
November 8.
The Wheatley-Jacobsen con
struction firm encountered prob
lems with the water level on the
site which meant the area had
to be pumped at the expense of
time. Later, with the threat of
strikes hanging over the firm
various phases of the pavilion
were completed in a jumbled or
der than planned at first, which
since has delayed the comple
tion of the pavilion.
The $3.3 million sports com
plex is being built primarily to
help alleviate overcrowding
problems which has been the

constant headache to adminis
trators who have had to cope
with the rapid growth of the
campus. The old pavilion held
only 2,700 people—quite insuffi
cient for campus needs.
No Meeting Room
In addition, intramural and
club team activities have grown
to the point where the pavilion
and older gymnasium no longer
provide adequate space. Also,
the campus has not really had
a large facility for mass meet
ings.
The new pavilion is expected
to solve all of these problems;
holding a capacity of 8,000 peo
ple while assuming much of the
load of intramural programs.
With greater receipts from
basketball, Stanford can attract
the top teams in the country, in
cluding those which have heavy
travel costs from the East Coast
and Midwest, Taylor points out.
A New Look
When finished the pavilion
will offer a unique look in de
sign with four 85 foot rein
forced concrete columns sup
porting the entire roof. The col
umns are anchored 50 feet un
der the foundation with a 13
Mfifc , y Wk

foot reinforced concrete pad at
the grade. The tops of the col
umns will support the roof
"cap."
The walls on the outside have
nothing to do with support of
the roof and a band of glass be
tween the roof and walls will
make it appear as if the roof is
floating completely unsupported.
The pavilion was designed by
architect John Carl Warnecke
and is being financed primarily
through the donation of Roscoe
Maples, a Stanford alumnus of
the class of 1904.
Maples Leaves Funds
Maples, a California lumber
man and philanthropist, left the
residue of an estate appraised at
$1.7 million to the University
upon his death in San Francisco
January 17, 1963.
Besides the $1.2 million left
for the pavilion the bequest ul
timately will endow a professor
ship and a scholarship fund. All
three will be named for the don
or.
It is expected that the old pa
vilion will serve as the site for
early season basketball games
until the unveiling of the new
arena.


WORK CONTINUES — Stanford's new pavilion, when completed, will seat 8,000. The old one, built
in 1922, holds 2700.

A New Look
When finished the pavilion
will offer a unique look in de
sign with four 85 foot rein
forced concrete columns sup
porting the entire roof. The col
umns are anchored 50 feet un
der the foundation with a 13
Mfifc , y Wk

foot reinforced concrete pad at
the grade. The tops of the col
umns will support the roof
"cap."
The walls on the outside have
nothing to do with support of
the roof and a band of glass be
tween the roof and walls will
make it appear as if the roof is
floating completely unsupported.
The pavilion was designed by
architect John Carl Warnecke
and is being financed primarily
through the donation of Roscoe
Maples, a Stanford alumnus of
the class of 1904.
Maples Leaves Funds
Maples, a California lumber
man and philanthropist, left the
residue of an estate appraised at
$1.7 million to the University
upon his death in San Francisco
January 17, 1963.
Besides the $1.2 million left
for the pavilion the bequest ul
timately will endow a professor
ship and a scholarship fund. All
three will be named for the don
or.
It is expected that the old pa
vilion will serve as the site for
early season basketball games
until the unveiling of the new
arena.


WORK CONTINUES — Stanford's new pavilion, when completed, will seat 8,000. The old one, built
in 1922, holds 2700.
Completion of the new Roscoe
Maples Sports Pavilion, original
ly scheduled for mid-October has
been moved back to early Jan
uary according to Athletic Direc
tor Chuck Taylor.
The pavilion, the first phase in
a multi-stage plan to move the
collegiate athletic program to
one central location bordered by
Galvez and Campus Drive, en
countered several difficulties
during construction since ground
was broken and will not be
ready for the varsity basketball
opener against Northwestern
November 8.
The Wheatley-Jacobsen con
struction firm encountered prob
lems with the water level on the
site which meant the area had
to be pumped at the expense of
time. Later, with the threat of
strikes hanging over the firm
various phases of the pavilion
were completed in a jumbled or
der than planned at first, which
since has delayed the comple
tion of the pavilion.
The $3.3 million sports com
plex is being built primarily to
help alleviate overcrowding
problems which has been the

constant headache to adminis
trators who have had to cope
with the rapid growth of the
campus. The old pavilion held
only 2,700 people—quite insuffi
cient for campus needs.
No Meeting Room
In addition, intramural and
club team activities have grown
to the point where the pavilion
and older gymnasium no longer
provide adequate space. Also,
the campus has not really had
a large facility for mass meet
ings.
The new pavilion is expected
to solve all of these problems;
holding a capacity of 8,000 peo
ple while assuming much of the
load of intramural programs.
With greater receipts from
basketball, Stanford can attract
the top teams in the country, in
cluding those which have heavy
travel costs from the East Coast
and Midwest, Taylor points out.
