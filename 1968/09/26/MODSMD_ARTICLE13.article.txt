# Business Professor's Study Uncovers 'Responsibility' Gap
## 
### 
A study conducted by Stanford
business professor Gerald Lead
er gives evidence of a "social re
sponsibility" gap between busi
ness leaders and students seek
ing their Masters of Business
Administration degrees.
The study covered three
groups: (1) Young Presidents
Organization — presidents of
businesses with at least $1 mil
lion in sales, (2) Stanford Ex
ecutive Program — senior man
agement from primarly large
corporations, and (3) First and
second-year MBA's.
Leader asked a variety of
questions and compared respon
ses among the groups to estab
lish patterns.
Disagree On Profit
Most responses showed a defi

nite gulf between the thinking
of the two groups of business
leaders and the MBA's especial
ly on the molt salient issue of
"profit."
Of all the questions asked one
of the most indicative of the so
cial conscience gap was "should
the interest of stockholders come
before other considerations."
Less than one-fourth of the
MBA's agreed, but half of the
Executives and three-fourths of
the Presidents were in feree
ment.
The second highly illustrative
question asked if the best way
for our system to operate was
to let businessmen seek a rea
sonable profit and allow the in
stitutions to solve social prob
lems. Less than one-fourth of

the MBA's were in agreement,
compared to half the Presidents
and over three-fourths of tho
executives.
"This survey definitely indi
cates that there is a new genera
tion of business executives who
will be more responsive to so
ciety and the role of business in
society," Prof. Leader stated.
Leader says he plans to do
another study in the near fu
ture and expects to find signi
ficant movement of the attitudes
of business leaders toward a
more responsive posture in busi
ness' role in social problems.
