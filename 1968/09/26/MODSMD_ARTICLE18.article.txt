# Tired Tribe Crew Places In Regatti
## Daily SPORTS 
### 
For the crews who row in the
Intercollegiate Rowing Associa
tion Regatta, the high point of
the racing season is after school
is out for the summer.
The regatta, held yearly in
Syracuse, New York, on the
second weekend in June, would
constitute a national champion
ship were not the same day as
the Harvard-Yale race. Never
theless, winning the "IRA" car
ries more prestige than any oth
er single accomplishment in
rowing.
This year being an Olympic
year, the traditional three-mile
distance was abandoned in favor
of the 2000 meter (1% miles)
Olympic event. Stanford crews
have placed moderately well in
the past few three-milers: ninth
in 1965, seventh in 1966, and
ninth in 1967 in the varsity event,
while the JV's placed fifth in
1966 and ninth in 1967. The
switch to 2000 meters boded well
for Stanford because Tribe crews
are usually smaller and lighter
than their competition.
But high hopes for success
were somewhat deflated by the
timing of the IRA, which began
the day after Stanford's last
day of finals. The cumulative
strain of exams and the more
immediate strain of traveling
3000 miles through three time
zones the day (and night) before
the first heat added up to a
disappointing performance in the
varsity event. By comparison,
first-place University of Pen
nsylvania had been out of school
for a month and had been train
ing in Syracuse for ten days by
the time the regatta started.
JV's Keep Cool
The first day began auspicious
ly, as a tired but relaxed Stan
ford JV crew won its heat and
posted the sth fastest time of
the day.
Noticing that the first half
of the course was virtually un
protected from a billowing cross
wind, the JV's altered their race
plan. White the other five boats
fought the choppy water ovei
the first 1000 meters, Stanford
rowed an almost leisurely 33
strokes per minute — 2 to 5
strokes under the competition.
At 1000 meters to go, the In
dians were in last place but
much stronger than their com
petition. JV stroke man Jim
Haley upped the pace by two
beats per minute, and Stanford
began to move on the arch ene
my University of Washington
in the adjacent lane.
By five hundred meters to go,
Stanford was second and pulling
on first-place Northeastern Uni
versity. The stroke went up
again, and 200 meters from the
finish the two boats were even.
Spurred on by the accomplish
ment of having come from be
hind, Stanford pulled to a two
second (40 feet) victory margin
over an exhausted Northeastern
crew.
Penn Prevails
As it turned out, that race was
the high point of the regatta, as
far as Stanford was concerned.

The varsity drew 1967 IRA
champion (and the odds-on fa
vorite) Pennsylvania, 1966 IRA
champion Wisconsin, and 1968
small-college champion George
town in their first heat.
Penn blasted off the line at a
blistering pace. Stanford and the
other four boats in the race held
on for 1000 meters, but in the
second half of the race Penn
pulled away and left the other
competitors strung out over
Lake Onandaga. Stanford finish
ed fourth.
Varsity Continues
The next day the Stanford
'JV's rested, having advanced
directly to the finals along with
the other two heat winners. The
heat non-winners, the varsity in
cluded, were reshuffled into three
'repechage' heats, the three win
ners also to go to the six-boat
final. Second and third boats
from each repechage go to a
'petite finale.'
The Stanford varsity finished
third in the repechage and fifth
in the petit finale, or eleventh
over-all. Pennsylvania won the
varsity final easily.
In the JV final, Stanford came
to the starting line somewhat
overawed by Penn. After they
failed to hold Penn for the first
500 meters, the Indians faded to
6th.
"Although eleventh and sixth
is certainly a respectable show
ing," said Coach Will Condon,
"I think it is not indicative of
our true potential at the time.
We were only three seconds be
hind Washington at the West
ern Sprints, yet at the IRA they
were second and we were elev
enth. We simply have to make
some arrangement to travel
back East earlier."
Improvement Seen
"As for the coming season, we
expect to improve upon our pre
vious showing in the IRA. Our
regular season record of 10-1
speaks for itself. The one loss
was to UCLA. I guess you could
say that this year's goal is to
beat the Bruins."
This year's crew has six re
turning lettermen, plus a group
of big and talented sophomores.
The Stanford crew trains
throughout the year for its
spring racing season and will
engage in an active intersquad
racing program this fall.

theless, winning the "IRA" car
ries more prestige than any oth
er single accomplishment in
rowing.
This year being an Olympic
year, the traditional three-mile
distance was abandoned in favor
of the 2000 meter (1% miles)
Olympic event. Stanford crews
have placed moderately well in
the past few three-milers: ninth
in 1965, seventh in 1966, and
ninth in 1967 in the varsity event,
while the JV's placed fifth in
1966 and ninth in 1967. The
switch to 2000 meters boded well
for Stanford because Tribe crews
are usually smaller and lighter
than their competition.
But high hopes for success
were somewhat deflated by the
timing of the IRA, which began
the day after Stanford's last
day of finals. The cumulative
strain of exams and the more
immediate strain of traveling
3000 miles through three time
zones the day (and night) before
the first heat added up to a
disappointing performance in the
varsity event. By comparison,
first-place University of Pen
nsylvania had been out of school
for a month and had been train
ing in Syracuse for ten days by
the time the regatta started.
JV's Keep Cool
The first day began auspicious
ly, as a tired but relaxed Stan
ford JV crew won its heat and
posted the sth fastest time of
the day.
Noticing that the first half
of the course was virtually un
protected from a billowing cross
wind, the JV's altered their race
plan. White the other five boats
fought the choppy water ovei
the first 1000 meters, Stanford
rowed an almost leisurely 33
strokes per minute — 2 to 5
strokes under the competition.
At 1000 meters to go, the In
dians were in last place but
much stronger than their com
petition. JV stroke man Jim
Haley upped the pace by two
beats per minute, and Stanford
began to move on the arch ene
my University of Washington
in the adjacent lane.
By five hundred meters to go,
Stanford was second and pulling
on first-place Northeastern Uni
versity. The stroke went up
again, and 200 meters from the
finish the two boats were even.
Spurred on by the accomplish
ment of having come from be
hind, Stanford pulled to a two
second (40 feet) victory margin
over an exhausted Northeastern
crew.
Penn Prevails
As it turned out, that race was
the high point of the regatta, as
far as Stanford was concerned.

The varsity drew 1967 IRA
champion (and the odds-on fa
vorite) Pennsylvania, 1966 IRA
champion Wisconsin, and 1968
small-college champion George
town in their first heat.
Penn blasted off the line at a
blistering pace. Stanford and the
other four boats in the race held
on for 1000 meters, but in the
second half of the race Penn
pulled away and left the other
competitors strung out over
Lake Onandaga. Stanford finish
ed fourth.
Varsity Continues
The next day the Stanford
'JV's rested, having advanced
directly to the finals along with
the other two heat winners. The
heat non-winners, the varsity in
cluded, were reshuffled into three
'repechage' heats, the three win
ners also to go to the six-boat
final. Second and third boats
from each repechage go to a
'petite finale.'
The Stanford varsity finished
third in the repechage and fifth
in the petit finale, or eleventh
over-all. Pennsylvania won the
varsity final easily.
In the JV final, Stanford came
to the starting line somewhat
overawed by Penn. After they
failed to hold Penn for the first
500 meters, the Indians faded to
6th.
"Although eleventh and sixth
is certainly a respectable show
ing," said Coach Will Condon,
"I think it is not indicative of
our true potential at the time.
We were only three seconds be
hind Washington at the West
ern Sprints, yet at the IRA they
were second and we were elev
enth. We simply have to make
some arrangement to travel
back East earlier."
Improvement Seen
"As for the coming season, we
expect to improve upon our pre
vious showing in the IRA. Our
regular season record of 10-1
speaks for itself. The one loss
was to UCLA. I guess you could
say that this year's goal is to
beat the Bruins."
This year's crew has six re
turning lettermen, plus a group
of big and talented sophomores.
The Stanford crew trains
throughout the year for its
spring racing season and will
engage in an active intersquad
racing program this fall.
For the crews who row in the
Intercollegiate Rowing Associa
tion Regatta, the high point of
the racing season is after school
is out for the summer.

in 1965, seventh in 1966, and
ninth in 1967 in the varsity event,
while the JV's placed fifth in
1966 and ninth in 1967. The
switch to 2000 meters boded well
for Stanford because Tribe crews
are usually smaller and lighter
than their competition.
But high hopes for success
were somewhat deflated by the
timing of the IRA, which began
the day after Stanford's last
day of finals. The cumulative
strain of exams and the more
immediate strain of traveling
3000 miles through three time
zones the day (and night) before
the first heat added up to a
disappointing performance in the
varsity event. By comparison,
first-place University of Pen
nsylvania had been out of school
for a month and had been train
ing in Syracuse for ten days by
the time the regatta started.
JV's Keep Cool
The first day began auspicious
ly, as a tired but relaxed Stan
ford JV crew won its heat and
posted the sth fastest time of
the day.
Noticing that the first half
of the course was virtually un
protected from a billowing cross
wind, the JV's altered their race
plan. White the other five boats
fought the choppy water ovei
the first 1000 meters, Stanford
rowed an almost leisurely 33
strokes per minute — 2 to 5
strokes under the competition.
At 1000 meters to go, the In
dians were in last place but
much stronger than their com
petition. JV stroke man Jim
Haley upped the pace by two
beats per minute, and Stanford
began to move on the arch ene
my University of Washington
in the adjacent lane.
By five hundred meters to go,
Stanford was second and pulling
on first-place Northeastern Uni
versity. The stroke went up
again, and 200 meters from the
finish the two boats were even.
Spurred on by the accomplish
ment of having come from be
hind, Stanford pulled to a two
second (40 feet) victory margin
over an exhausted Northeastern
crew.
Penn Prevails
As it turned out, that race was
the high point of the regatta, as
far as Stanford was concerned.

The varsity drew 1967 IRA
champion (and the odds-on fa
vorite) Pennsylvania, 1966 IRA
champion Wisconsin, and 1968
small-college champion George
town in their first heat.
Penn blasted off the line at a
blistering pace. Stanford and the
other four boats in the race held
on for 1000 meters, but in the
second half of the race Penn
pulled away and left the other
competitors strung out over
Lake Onandaga. Stanford finish
ed fourth.
Varsity Continues
The next day the Stanford
'JV's rested, having advanced
directly to the finals along with
the other two heat winners. The
heat non-winners, the varsity in
cluded, were reshuffled into three
'repechage' heats, the three win
ners also to go to the six-boat
final. Second and third boats
from each repechage go to a
'petite finale.'
The Stanford varsity finished
third in the repechage and fifth
in the petit finale, or eleventh
over-all. Pennsylvania won the
varsity final easily.
In the JV final, Stanford came
to the starting line somewhat
overawed by Penn. After they
failed to hold Penn for the first
500 meters, the Indians faded to
6th.
"Although eleventh and sixth
is certainly a respectable show
ing," said Coach Will Condon,
"I think it is not indicative of
our true potential at the time.
We were only three seconds be
hind Washington at the West
ern Sprints, yet at the IRA they
were second and we were elev
enth. We simply have to make
some arrangement to travel
back East earlier."
Improvement Seen
"As for the coming season, we
expect to improve upon our pre
vious showing in the IRA. Our
regular season record of 10-1
speaks for itself. The one loss
was to UCLA. I guess you could
say that this year's goal is to
beat the Bruins."
This year's crew has six re
turning lettermen, plus a group
of big and talented sophomores.
The Stanford crew trains
throughout the year for its
spring racing season and will
engage in an active intersquad
racing program this fall.
For the crews who row in the
Intercollegiate Rowing Associa
tion Regatta, the high point of
the racing season is after school
is out for the summer.
The regatta, held yearly in
Syracuse, New York, on the
second weekend in June, would
constitute a national champion
ship were not the same day as
the Harvard-Yale race. Never
theless, winning the "IRA" car
ries more prestige than any oth
er single accomplishment in
rowing.
This year being an Olympic
year, the traditional three-mile
distance was abandoned in favor
of the 2000 meter (1% miles)
Olympic event. Stanford crews
have placed moderately well in
the past few three-milers: ninth
in 1965, seventh in 1966, and
ninth in 1967 in the varsity event,
while the JV's placed fifth in
1966 and ninth in 1967. The
