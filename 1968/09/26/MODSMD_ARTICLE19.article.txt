UCLA
LOS ANGELES (UPl)—Rook
ie signal-callers Jim Nader and
Greg Jones were scheduled to
continue their cram courses in
quarterbacking at UCLA today.
Nader, a sophomore, was
rushed into service Saturday
against Pittsburgh, but showed
none of the usual rookie jitters,
throwing four touchdown passes
in the 63-7 rout. Nader took
over when starter Bill Bolden
suffered a shoulder separation.
He will be lost for at least two
weeks.
Jones was moved from his
starting left halfback slot into
the No. 2 spot behind Nader in
case the soph is injured.
