# Parking Rules To Be Revised
## 
### CLAIRE DARLEY 
: Faced with widespread disre
jgard for University parking
regulations, Acting President
Robert J. Glaser has announced
plans to form a 12-man commit
tee of students, faculty, and
staff members to recommend in
ternal procedures for their en
forcement.
In a letter to the university
community, Glaser noted that
there were more than 3,000 un
paid parking tickets among fac
ulty and staff, and 1,200 more
among students during 1967-68.
Forty-two of these individuals,
including a presumed stanchion
of justice from the law faculty,
have ten or more unpaid cita
tions, and twenty have twenty or
more.
The rules of the Stanford Po
lice Department read that "the
registration of motor vehicles
and designation of particular
parking areas for specific per
mits are intended to achieve an
equitable system of parking
privileges for faculty, staff and
students . .
Students Say 'No'
The Student Judicial Council
has announced that it will not
assist in enforcing parking vio
lations against students unless
the University will change its
"inequitable" policy and start en
forcing violations against its em
ployees.
University counsel Cassius
Kirk says that the position ad
vanced by the council "is one I
cannot argue with."
In the hope that a temporary

plan could be instituted by the
time of registration, a commit
tee was formed earlier to devel
op an interim proposal. The
committee suggested the possi
bility of changing the status of
Stanford police to that of peace
officers. The authority of peace
officers is quite similar to that
of all citizens, who may make
ormqts. but peace offi
cers may issue tickets.
This suggestion could not be
i; uue to the red tape
encountered with police district
ing, approval of the state legis
lature, and the present penal
code.
Problem Persists
Without an acceptable plan,
the parking problem persists. At
least two "improper parking" ci
tations have already been issued
this fall by Santa Clara deputies.
The first violator was a stu
dent, Deane Shapiro, who was
cited for having parked on the
wrong side of the street, facing
in the wrong direction, in a No
Parking zone.
When questioned, Shapiro
stated that "I believe that it is
my loyal and patriotic duty to
support my local police, and I
would hope tha* in all such cru
cial issues as these, the police
department would use its man
power to arrest and incarcerate
all such villians and subversive
characters."
The second violator of the "im
proper parking" statute was
Stanford's Vice President for
Business Affairs, Mr. Alf Bran
din.
