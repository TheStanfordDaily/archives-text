LAST KICK — Senior placekicker Bill Shoemaker kicks off to open the second half of Saturday's
Stanford-San Jose game. Shoemaker will probably never kick again for Stanford.
A FEW MINUTES after this kickoff Shoemaker had to be helped off the field because of torn liga
ments in his left knee. He was operated on Monday and will probably be out for the season.
LAST YEAR Shoemaker booted 17 extra points and six field goals, in addition to catching two touch
down passes, to lead Stanford scorers with 47 points. This season Bill was switched to linebacker,
and adapted to the position remarkably well before he was put out of commission Saturday.
HIS PLACEKICKING, linebacking, unselfish team play and leadership will be sorely missed.
