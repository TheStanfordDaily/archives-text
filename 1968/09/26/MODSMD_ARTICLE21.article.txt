# The 						Inside Track
## Irish Key On Leroy 
### Gary Cavalli 
This may be the first time in collegiate football history that the
national championship is decided in the second week of the season.
Saturday afternoon Notre Dame hosts Purdue in what promises
to be the top game of the 1968 college grid season. At the present
time the Fighting Irish top one wire service poll, while the Boiler
makers are ranked first in the nation on the other.
Last year Leroy Keyes led his Purdue teammates to a stunning
28-21 upset over Ara Parseghian's eleven on the Purdue gridiron.
This time Notre Dame will be at home, and the Irish have been
installed as six-point favorites.
Mollenkopf Fears Irish
Purdue coach Jack Mollenkopf, whose Boilermakers are ranked
No. 1 by the Associated Press, feels that his opponents deserve the
favorite's role. In a press conference Monday, Mollenkopf said, "I
don't think there is a team in the Nation who could match them
(Notre Dame) on offense ... and their defense is bigger than ours."
Despite Mollenkopf's apparent awe of Notre Dame, he is not
planning to run and hide come Saturday. In Leroy Keyes he has
the most versatile and probably the most talented performer in the
country.
Mr. Versatility
Keyes led the nation in scoring last year, but he was also among
the leaders in rushing, receiving and kickoff returns. In addition,
Keyes plays defense on occasion, and he made a crucial intercep
tion of a Terry Hanratty pass late in the Notre Dame game last
year to insure a Purdue victory. As if this wasn't enough, he also
does the kicking for the Boilermakers.
But Keyes isn't the whole show (just most of it). Purdue has a
fine young quarterback in Mike Phipps, a powerful fullback in
Perry Williams, sure-handed receivers, and a very tough defense.
Potent Passing Game
The Fighting Irish will probably rely on the gifted arm of Terry
Hanratty to provide them with most of their points offensively. On
the receiving end of a good share of Hanratty's bullets will be Jim
Seymour, who is on his way to breaking every Notre Dame re
ceiving record.
The one thing the Irish will have over Purdue, as Mollenkopf
indicated, is size. Parseghian has a large contingent of big, raw
lineman, but some of them lack experience.
All things considered, it should be one of the greatest games col
lege football fans will see for a decade, Notre Dame will go into the
game as keyed as any team can possibly be, but a fellow named
Leroy Keyes will prove their undoing. Look for Purdue to repeat
last year's victory, this time by a 35-31 score.

The Fighting Irish will probably rely on the gifted arm of Terry
Hanratty to provide them with most of their points offensively. On
the receiving end of a good share of Hanratty's bullets will be Jim
Seymour, who is on his way to breaking every Notre Dame re
ceiving record.
The one thing the Irish will have over Purdue, as Mollenkopf
indicated, is size. Parseghian has a large contingent of big, raw
lineman, but some of them lack experience.
All things considered, it should be one of the greatest games col
lege football fans will see for a decade, Notre Dame will go into the
game as keyed as any team can possibly be, but a fellow named
Leroy Keyes will prove their undoing. Look for Purdue to repeat
last year's victory, this time by a 35-31 score.
This may be the first time in collegiate football history that the
national championship is decided in the second week of the season.
Saturday afternoon Notre Dame hosts Purdue in what promises
to be the top game of the 1968 college grid season. At the present
time the Fighting Irish top one wire service poll, while the Boiler
makers are ranked first in the nation on the other.
Last year Leroy Keyes led his Purdue teammates to a stunning
28-21 upset over Ara Parseghian's eleven on the Purdue gridiron.
This time Notre Dame will be at home, and the Irish have been
installed as six-point favorites.
Mollenkopf Fears Irish
Purdue coach Jack Mollenkopf, whose Boilermakers are ranked
No. 1 by the Associated Press, feels that his opponents deserve the
favorite's role. In a press conference Monday, Mollenkopf said, "I
don't think there is a team in the Nation who could match them
(Notre Dame) on offense ... and their defense is bigger than ours."
Despite Mollenkopf's apparent awe of Notre Dame, he is not
planning to run and hide come Saturday. In Leroy Keyes he has
the most versatile and probably the most talented performer in the
country.
Mr. Versatility
Keyes led the nation in scoring last year, but he was also among
the leaders in rushing, receiving and kickoff returns. In addition,
Keyes plays defense on occasion, and he made a crucial intercep
tion of a Terry Hanratty pass late in the Notre Dame game last
year to insure a Purdue victory. As if this wasn't enough, he also
does the kicking for the Boilermakers.
But Keyes isn't the whole show (just most of it). Purdue has a
fine young quarterback in Mike Phipps, a powerful fullback in
Perry Williams, sure-handed receivers, and a very tough defense.
