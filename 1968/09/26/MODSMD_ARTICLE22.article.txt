## Avalon Dance Concerts Continue 
### PETER THOMPSON 
Good old Avalon. It rolls on in
reliable fashion. The name
groups aren't often there, but
they still feature musicians who
care. Kids dance. There's room
to lie down. The food upstairs
was a "Blues Night Special":
black-eyed peas, cornbread, and
watermelon. Occasionally a fuse
blows or a musician doesn't
show, but no one minds. Things
remain honest, comfortable,
mellow.
Last Sunday night's show fea
tured the Steve Miller Band,
Muddy Waters, A. B. Skhy
Blues Band, with a guest set
from a Bloomington, Indiana—
really!—group.
Mother Bear was the guest
group, and it was pretty dull.
The group has a chick who can
really sing, but who didn't sing
much, and a songwriter who
must have listened to Dan Hicks
and Arlo Guthrie, but still sings

with an "Ahab the Arab" phras
ing.
The potential is there, but
their sloppiness is often offen
sive and their humoi is unusual
ly strained. Memorable only be
cause they did a song called,
"I've Got the World on a String
and I'm Sitting on My Finger
for You."
Lots Of B. B. King
The A. B. Skhy B. B. has
worked harder and is composed
of fairly competent musicians,
but seems almost totally unima
ginative and irrelevant. The
lead guitarist has obviously
been locked up with a lot of
B. B. King records, certainly an
honorable way of life.
Unfortunately, it does not pro
duce very interesting music un
less one can go on from this
stage. The lead could not: his
chops, arranging, and vocals,
were pale imitations of the real
thing. The rest of the band was

even worse, imitating the imita
tors. The harp player even had
stringy, greasy hair parted in
the middle. I swear.
Muddy made these bands
seem out of place when he got
into it. He was the first Chicago
bluesman to become known
throughout teenie-bop land, and
his band remains the finest.
Otis Spann now plays an or
gan, but the down-home runs
and incredibly sure hand are
still there; Little Walter, James
Cotton, and Georgie Smith, are
gone, but Muddy has found a
harp man who is working into
that league; Luther Johnson
just keeps getting cleaner on
second guitar; and S. P. Leary
is still smiling over his drums.
Muddy Watered
Muddy has added an unneces
sary third guitar and is attempt
ing some freaky electronic
things in his new album (which
manage to sound like watered

down Steve Miller—you figure
that out).
But on Sunday night, the
boys just kept laying down the
old, familiar blues that have be
come associated with them.
This is a band of still individ
ually brilliant bluesmen who
have really gotten it together.
The Steve Miller Band per
formed without guitarist Boz
Scaggs—who is soon leaving the
group with Tim Davis and Jim
Peterman—but were neverthe
less magnificent. They began by
diddling along with the filler
records, adding a bit of highly
controlled feedback, and paused,
momentarily, before unleashing
an overwhelming wall of sound.
Somehow this beautiful noise
was sustained throughout a bit
tersweet set
Something Underneath
They are as hard as anything
around, grating, disturbing, and
demanding. But, underneath it

all, Miller's riffs emerge into the
audience's consciousness, teas
ing you into thinking that may
be the band will let you inside
its music after all. Don't worry:
if you lie down to listen to them,
they won't even let you get up.
Sunday night at Avalon means
lots of guests and jamming. Da
vid Blue nee Cohen came on as
nothing but the plastic Holly
wood freak he claimed he
wasn't. But A 1 Kooper continued
his musical explorations behind
Miller, and was just a bitch.
Random people shuffled on and
off the stage until three or so,
doing their proverbial thing, i
The puppets upstairs fornicated
under ultra-violet light, and a \
natural spontaneity made every
one part of the Family Dog.
Someone announced that Jack ,
Elliot is due next week. Good |
old Avalon.

B. B. King records, certainly an
honorable way of life.
Unfortunately, it does not pro
duce very interesting music un
less one can go on from this
stage. The lead could not: his
chops, arranging, and vocals,
were pale imitations of the real
thing. The rest of the band was

even worse, imitating the imita
tors. The harp player even had
stringy, greasy hair parted in
the middle. I swear.
Muddy made these bands
seem out of place when he got
into it. He was the first Chicago
bluesman to become known
throughout teenie-bop land, and
his band remains the finest.
Otis Spann now plays an or
gan, but the down-home runs
and incredibly sure hand are
still there; Little Walter, James
Cotton, and Georgie Smith, are
gone, but Muddy has found a
harp man who is working into
that league; Luther Johnson
just keeps getting cleaner on
second guitar; and S. P. Leary
is still smiling over his drums.
Muddy Watered
Muddy has added an unneces
sary third guitar and is attempt
ing some freaky electronic
things in his new album (which
manage to sound like watered

down Steve Miller—you figure
that out).
But on Sunday night, the
boys just kept laying down the
old, familiar blues that have be
come associated with them.
This is a band of still individ
ually brilliant bluesmen who
have really gotten it together.
The Steve Miller Band per
formed without guitarist Boz
Scaggs—who is soon leaving the
group with Tim Davis and Jim
Peterman—but were neverthe
less magnificent. They began by
diddling along with the filler
records, adding a bit of highly
controlled feedback, and paused,
momentarily, before unleashing
an overwhelming wall of sound.
Somehow this beautiful noise
was sustained throughout a bit
tersweet set
Something Underneath
They are as hard as anything
around, grating, disturbing, and
demanding. But, underneath it

all, Miller's riffs emerge into the
audience's consciousness, teas
ing you into thinking that may
be the band will let you inside
its music after all. Don't worry:
if you lie down to listen to them,
they won't even let you get up.
Sunday night at Avalon means
lots of guests and jamming. Da
vid Blue nee Cohen came on as
nothing but the plastic Holly
wood freak he claimed he
wasn't. But A 1 Kooper continued
his musical explorations behind
Miller, and was just a bitch.
Random people shuffled on and
off the stage until three or so,
doing their proverbial thing, i
The puppets upstairs fornicated
under ultra-violet light, and a \
natural spontaneity made every
one part of the Family Dog.

Elliot is due next week. Good |
old Avalon.
Good old Avalon. It rolls on in
reliable fashion. The name
groups aren't often there, but
they still feature musicians who
care. Kids dance. There's room
to lie down. The food upstairs
was a "Blues Night Special":
black-eyed peas, cornbread, and
watermelon. Occasionally a fuse
blows or a musician doesn't
show, but no one minds. Things
remain honest, comfortable,
mellow.
Last Sunday night's show fea
tured the Steve Miller Band,
Muddy Waters, A. B. Skhy
Blues Band, with a guest set
from a Bloomington, Indiana—
really!—group.
Mother Bear was the guest
group, and it was pretty dull.
The group has a chick who can
really sing, but who didn't sing
much, and a songwriter who
must have listened to Dan Hicks
and Arlo Guthrie, but still sings

with an "Ahab the Arab" phras
ing.
The potential is there, but
their sloppiness is often offen
sive and their humoi is unusual
ly strained. Memorable only be
cause they did a song called,
"I've Got the World on a String
and I'm Sitting on My Finger
for You."
Lots Of B. B. King
The A. B. Skhy B. B. has
worked harder and is composed
of fairly competent musicians,
but seems almost totally unima
ginative and irrelevant. The
lead guitarist has obviously
been locked up with a lot of
B. B. King records, certainly an
