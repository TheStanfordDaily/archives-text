# Students To Apply To Stanford Village
## 
### 
Students without housing may
submit applications for places in
Stanford Village beginning at 1
p.m. today.
Applications should be brought
to the Dean of St'dents office,
Room 309 of the Old Union.
Sixty-nine unmarried and elev
en married students are in need
of housing, according to a sur
vey conducted during Registra
tion. Assistant Dean of Students
Dan Williams anticipates that
all can be accommodated in the
newly reoponed complex.
Married students will have
first priority, according to Wil
liams. Unmarried students will
be accommodated on a first
come, first serve, basis.
Space In Dorms
An additional eleven places are
available in Stanford dorms, ac
cording to Assistant Dean of
Students Robert Rosch. He add
ed that all students on waiting
lists for University housing
should go to the single students
housing desk in the Old Union

since the Housing Office has
been unable to contact all stu
dents for whom space has been
found.
Dean Williams said that the
applications for Stanford Vil
lage will be processed this after
noon. Once an application has
been accepted, the student will
have to make a $50 housing de
posit and sign a contract for the
school year.
He said that the first students
might be able to move in on Sat
urday, though the apartments
will remain unfurnished for
about one week.
The rent including utilities
will be determined by the cost
to the University to reactivate
and maintain the Village. The
estimated cost is now $80 for a
studio apartment for two stu
dents, $90 for a one bedroom
apartment for two students, and
$100 for a two bedroom apart
ment for three students.
The rent does not include tele
phone, linen or cleaning.
