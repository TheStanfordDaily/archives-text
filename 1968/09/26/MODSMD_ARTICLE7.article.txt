Over the summer the Board of Trustees came to
the end of the tortuous process of choosing a Uni
versity president to replace J. E. Wallace Sterling,
who retired to a lifetime chancellorship Sept. 1.
The search was conducted by a committee of
Trustees, chaired by Trustee Roger Lewis of New
York. A faculty committee under the leadership of
Law Prof. William Baxter helped in the process.
This is certainly as it should be; the faculty have a
vital concern over who is the president of the Uni
versity.
But the patient efforts of ASSU President Denis
Hayes to gain a voice for students in the selection
process led to nought.
Trustee Lewis did not think students should
know how the selection process was carried out.
He made this plain in a letter on Jan. 26 of this
year to Daily News Editor Michael Sweeney, who
had asked for an interview with him.
"The plain facts are that I do not think the se
lection of a President is a matter for discussion out
side the Faculty and the Special Committees at
this stage and have not talked to any reporters
about it," Lewis wrote.
In spite of moves later in the spring to get some
student voice in the selection process on the part
of ASSU and other student leaders, no progress
was made.
One of Denis Hayes' first actions after his elec
tion as Associated Students president was to write
to Prof. Baxter about the presidential selection. In

a series of meetings with him, Hayes explained why
he believed students should have some role in the
process. He admitted in a June 26 letter to Baxter
that students could not possibly have the range of
contacts in the academic world that the faculty has.
But Hayes asserted that students who were in a
position to "advise and consent" might "evidence a
far greater concern than would faculty for the past
relations of candidates to students: is he (she) au
thoritarian? . . . patronizing? . . . cognizant of the
values of contemporary' youth? Has he a strong
record of 'grace under pressure? Is his background
and character such as would evoke wide student
respect?"
Hayes asked for a student review of candidates
under serious consideration for the office. And he
also suggested four nationally prominent men
whom he felt should be considered by the faculty
committee.
Baxter was opposed to a student review because
it would "involve disclosure of confidences" —both
concerning candidates' backgrounds and also con
cerning the Trustee's desire to keep secret whom
they were considering. But he did encourage Hayes
to set up a student committee to prepare dossiers
on the candidates Hayes had suggested.
In his July 5 letter Baxter said, "Finally, I cannot
agree with your expressed reason for the impor
tance of student review. I do not believe that stu
dents would evidence a far greater concern than
faculty about a candidate's tendency toward au

thoritarianism or his cognition of the values of stu
dents. You greatly overestimate, in my view, the
extent to which the criteria of the several constitu
encies diverge."
Hayes, though not enthusiastic over the limited
role assigned to students, got his committee work
ing on the suggested dossiers. The faculty and sev
en-member student committees did meet together
to talk over an amended list of suggested candi
dates for the presidency.
But the committees met just a week before the
announcement of the appointment of the Trustee's
choice for president was made public, and the stu
dent committee was told that the selection process
had already progressed too far to let students get
involved.
The question of who should make decisions about
the University is a very old one and a very com
plex one. A point that ought to be remembered is
that there is no real traditional absolute truth that
can be looked to in this question.
In some of the earliest universities, the students
were almost entirely in charge of choosing teachers
and leaders of the universities. In others the pro
fessors themselves took a pre-eminent role in all
matters, and the students had little voice. In the
modem American university many major decisions
—and the legal responsibilities—lie with boards of
governors, regents, and trustees.
But there is in our world today a pertinent doc
trine that the trustees ought to have considered

when they refused to give students a meaningful
role in the selection process. And that is the belief
that people ought to have the right to participate
in decision-making that will have some effect on
their lives.
The principle enunciated in the American Revo
lution that taxation without representation is
tyranny is justly expanded. Any decision that ig
nores the affected constituencies in tyranny.
But the difficulties involved are compensated for
by the benefits of self-determination. And it is al
most medieval to argue that the Trustees should
have ignored this principle as they did in selecting
a new president for the University.
The decision of the Board of Trustees may or
may not meet with the approval of the majority of
students. But clearly the selection process almost
completely ignored the principle of representation
of all the constituencies affected by the subsequent
decision.
In light of the man the Trustees did select, we
cannot concur with Prof. Baxter when he expounds
the view that "the extent to which the criteria of
the several constituencies (of the University) di
verge" is not very great.
The Trustee—whose mind turns to fund raising
capabilities, business connections, and a "liberal"
record in evaluating possible presidential candi
dates—has only a limited degree of involvement in
campus realities and problems. And the long-time
faculty member is too often locked in the rut of
departmental responsibilities, professional disci
pline, and influential personal acquaintances.
Indeed, no Trustee or faculty member with 20
vears experience could bring an all-important qual
ification that students or even staff members could
add to the presidential selection process: ignorance.
The fresh perspective, the untried idea, the abil
ity to examine old assumptions critically—these are
essential qualities to be represented among those
who choose University presidents.
And we are offended by Baxter's imputation that
students would not be able to keep secret the pri
vate information that the Trustee and faculty se
lection committees must have been collecting about
the candidates for the presidency. Students have
been serving for years on University committees
whose deliberations are sometimes kept secret. To
our knowledge, none has betrayed these confi
dences.
It seems to us, therefore, that the Trustees have
most seriously abused their powers by continuing
to act as though the University were one of the
corporations over which they sit. The University is
a complex place, but in essence its purpose should
be serving people, giving them skills and perhaps
some wisdom that will be useful to them.
It is the sort of place where the principle of rep
resentation should be practiced most consistently.
So we again urge that the Trustees reconsider their
choice, made without adequate student involve
ment.
We realize that given the normal course of
events, they will ignore our plea. Yet we urge them
to remember another of Jefferson's inalienable
rights: "That whenever any form of government
becomes destructive of these ends (to allow citi
zens to secure their rights, with the government
having the consent of the governed) it is the right
of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to insti
tute new government, laying its foundation on such
principles and organizing its powers in such form,
as to them shall seem most likely to effect their
safety and happiness."
We have here a case of a patient attempt on the
part of Denis Hayes to work "through the system."
He was rebuffed by the Trustees not unlike Colo
nial leaders were rebuffed in their efforts to reach
an understanding with the government of Eigh
teenth-century England.
There are various ways of altering or abolishing
an unjust institution. We cannot help fear that if
Stanford University is not changed peacefully,
some other means will be found.
