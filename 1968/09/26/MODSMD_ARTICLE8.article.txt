# My Tin Drum
## The

### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
I was quietly prowling around
Inner Quad one moonless night
looking for a place to sleep. I
have to sleep under the bushes
every other night, because of the
housing shortage. Not that I'm
resentful — it's just that the
University had to assign two
people to my room, and there's
only room for one bed. So we
take turns. That night it was
my turn to sleep under the
bushes.
My sleeping bag was unrolled
under a big palm tree when I
heard voices from a lighted win
dow in one of the administra
tion trailers. I crept closer to
hear.
As a conscientious member of
the Stanford community, I feel
it is my duty to repeat here the
conversation I overheard that
dark night:
A gravelly, tired voice: "No,
Chuck. We can't buy a football
team. The students and profs
would raise hell."

An insistent, ironic voice re
plied: "They're already raising
h 11, Ken. And the heat is going
way up unless you can find some
money for this university. Mon
ey is what makes people raise
hell around here. Are you look
ing forward to the time you
hn.ve to announce a tuition hike?
What are you going to do when
county health officials get a look
at the way we've got the stu
dents packed in dormitories?"
"Our goal is to make Stanford
the national champion in foot
ball by 1970. Our market re
searchers say that this football
prominence would make each of
Stanford's 80,000 living alum
ni hear the name "Stanford" an
average of 94.5 more times a
year. Our behavioral analyst
says this would make them 2.1
times as willing to make a finan
cial donation to the university.
Based on $5 million in alumni
gifts in fiscal 1968, this means
we would make $10.5 million in
fiscal 1970. The net gain is $5.5
million a year.

"Furthermore, increased box
office income would be $400,000.
Our advertising staff points out
that TV income would increase
by $650,000. Licensing fees from
u°e of the Stanford name for
athletic equipment and corn
lakes would be $160,000. Corpor
ate gifts would increase by
roughly $540,000. ..."
"Wait a minute, Chuck. How
in God's name can you project
how much more money we'll get
from corporations? Since when
did they give to the best football
school?"
"Ken, take it easy. In 1964 a
marketing research study show
ed that the typical corporate
oxecutive spends 46 per cent of
his non-work time thinking
about football.
"The grand total is $7,250,000
extra income from Stanford by
fiscal 1970."
"That's fine, Chuck. Now how
much did you say it would cost
to make us national football
champs by 1970?"
Beef Budget
"Only $600,000 increase in our
budget. All we need is top play
ers. We just have to beat the go
ing price across country — put
on the hard sell — and we'll get
first line material.
"Look how far we've gone al
ready on a tiny budget. A few
radio commercials about an "In
dian Uprising," a 68-20 win over
San Jose, and already we've got
1,402 inches of copy in national
press mentions and 318 mentions
on TV and radio. Aggressive
player recruiting got us this far
— now all we need is cash."
"How much per player?"
"We anticipate a pay scale of
$4200 to $6000, with a cost of
living escalator. Fringe benefits
would be another $400. The bud
get would cover 60 players a
year. The rest of the money is
for public relations, travel and
entertainment."
"Chuck, do you realize you're
asking for a 40 per cent increase
in your budget?"
"Ken, the return on that mon
ey would be 1,000 per cent, at
least. How much do you make on
the endowment? Five per cent?
Ken, just think of it as a shrewd
investment decision. For the
good of Stanford University."
"OK, Chuck. For the good
of Stanford."
