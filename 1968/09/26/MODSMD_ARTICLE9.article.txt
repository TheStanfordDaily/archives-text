# Have I Ever Lied To You?
## George Promises Much 
### Art Buchwald 
Ex-Gov. George Wallace has
finally cleared the air as far as
the 1968 presidential campaign
is concerned. The main issue is,
"If you were President of the
United States, would you or
would you not drive over some
one who lies in front of your
car?"
Wallace has been getting his
biggest hand when he says,"The
first anarchist who lies down in
front of my automobile when
I become President, that's the
last automobile he'll ever want
to lie down in front of."
This remark had led many
Americans to believe that if Wal
lace is elected he will call his
Administration the "hit<uad-run
society."
It's interesting to note that
neither Vice President Humph
rey nor Richard Nixon have in
dicated where they stand on run
ning over people. This has come
as a big disappointment to those
of us who are concerned with
the issue of "law and order."
The Nixon people have hinted
that running over anarchists is
a local matter and should be de
cided by the people in each com
munity. The Humphrey people,
on the other hand, feel the fed
eral government should decide
who should and should not be

run over by the President of the
United States.
But neither the Republican
nor Democratic candidates will
take a public stand on this
pressing issue, and Wallace 1s
therefore attracting every bad
driver in the countyr to his
cause.
Constitutional Question
There has been some grum
bling among constitutional ex
perts that driving over anar
chists is not a presidential func
tion. They point out that it's
very difficult, with traffic the
way it is today, to know who is
an anarchist and who isn't; and
it's quite possible that an in
nocent person could be squished
to death before President Wal
lace realized his mistake.
Furthermore, these experts
say, even if Wallace only killed
anarchists, some President in
the future might not be so dis
criminating, and could use his
power to run over whomever he
pleased.
But Wallace supporters have
rejected these criticisms as
pseudointellectual, left - wing
press propaganda. They point
out that there is nothing in the
Constitution to prevent the Pres
ident of the United States from

hitting whomever gets in the
way of his car. Besides, they say,
there will never be any respect
for the office of the Presidency
until a few anarchists feel the
full weight of a White House
limousine.
Beyond Anarchists
Some observers are worried,
though, that Wallace will not be
content just to run over anar
chists. He has said in his speech
es that if he is elected he's going
to put the Supreme Court jus
tices in their place.
This could mean any number
of things. He could cut down the
power of the court, he could
drax't all the justices into the
Army, or he could drive up to
the Supreme Court building at
recess and see how many Su
preme Court justices he could
knock down with his bumper.
Whether it will come to that
or not, the feeling here in Wash
ington is that Humphrey and
Nixon cannot remain silent much
longer on the "right to run over"
issue that George Wallace has
so ably raised.
The public wants to know not
only whose finger will be on the
atomic button in the White
House, but also whose foot will
be on the accelerator of the pres
idential car.

first anarchist who lies down in
front of my automobile when
I become President, that's the
last automobile he'll ever want
to lie down in front of."
This remark had led many
Americans to believe that if Wal
lace is elected he will call his
Administration the "hit<uad-run
society."
It's interesting to note that
neither Vice President Humph
rey nor Richard Nixon have in
dicated where they stand on run
ning over people. This has come
as a big disappointment to those
of us who are concerned with
the issue of "law and order."
The Nixon people have hinted
that running over anarchists is
a local matter and should be de
cided by the people in each com
munity. The Humphrey people,
on the other hand, feel the fed
eral government should decide
who should and should not be

run over by the President of the
United States.
But neither the Republican
nor Democratic candidates will
take a public stand on this
pressing issue, and Wallace 1s
therefore attracting every bad
driver in the countyr to his
cause.
Constitutional Question
There has been some grum
bling among constitutional ex
perts that driving over anar
chists is not a presidential func
tion. They point out that it's
very difficult, with traffic the
way it is today, to know who is
an anarchist and who isn't; and
it's quite possible that an in
nocent person could be squished
to death before President Wal
lace realized his mistake.
Furthermore, these experts
say, even if Wallace only killed
anarchists, some President in
the future might not be so dis
criminating, and could use his
power to run over whomever he
pleased.
But Wallace supporters have
rejected these criticisms as
pseudointellectual, left - wing
press propaganda. They point
out that there is nothing in the
Constitution to prevent the Pres
ident of the United States from

hitting whomever gets in the
way of his car. Besides, they say,
there will never be any respect
for the office of the Presidency
until a few anarchists feel the
full weight of a White House
limousine.
Beyond Anarchists
Some observers are worried,
though, that Wallace will not be
content just to run over anar
chists. He has said in his speech
es that if he is elected he's going
to put the Supreme Court jus
tices in their place.
This could mean any number
of things. He could cut down the
power of the court, he could
drax't all the justices into the
Army, or he could drive up to
the Supreme Court building at
recess and see how many Su
preme Court justices he could
knock down with his bumper.
Whether it will come to that
or not, the feeling here in Wash
ington is that Humphrey and
Nixon cannot remain silent much
longer on the "right to run over"
issue that George Wallace has
so ably raised.
The public wants to know not
only whose finger will be on the
atomic button in the White
House, but also whose foot will
be on the accelerator of the pres
idential car.

Ex-Gov. George Wallace has
finally cleared the air as far as
the 1968 presidential campaign
is concerned. The main issue is,
"If you were President of the
United States, would you or
would you not drive over some
one who lies in front of your
car?"
Wallace has been getting his
biggest hand when he says,"The
first anarchist who lies down in
front of my automobile when
I become President, that's the
last automobile he'll ever want
to lie down in front of."
