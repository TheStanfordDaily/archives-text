# Humphrey In San Francisco
## Youth Versus Old Politics News Analysis 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Just how wide the enormous
gulf is between American youth
and the political establishment
was made crystal clear yester
day in San Francisco.
In what was termed a "major
foreign policy address," Presi
dential candidate Hubert Hum-

phrey enunciated new proposals
toward achieving world peace
before San Francisco's social
elite in the chandeliered Shera
ton-Palace Hotel.
Outside the hotel, a disorga
nized array of youthful protest
ors angrily rejected the Vice
President's most basic political
premises, making a dialogue im
possible. And of course, there
As Humphrey's Cadillac lim
ousine drew up for the noontime
sine drew up for the noontime
speech at the Sheraton-Palace
located in the heart of San Fran
cisco's steel-and-glass financial
district, he was met by a blast
of jeers, shouts, sign, and chants
of "Dump the Hump," by a
crowd of perhaps 150 demonstra
tors. The cheers of several dozen
Humphrey for President sup
porters, mainly carrying union
made signs, were drowned out.
With a grim expression, the

Vice President ignored the
crowd and hurried inside, pro
ceeded by a phalanx of secret
service, treasury, narcotics bu
reau, and Humphrey staff
guards.
The tone of the afternoon was
set even before Humphrey ar
rived at the hotel. Several blocks
away, Democratic workers had
prepared a traditional motorcade
parade down Montgomery Street,
the center of the west coast bus
iness world.

All details were assiduously
cared for: lining the streets were
children who had been excused
from school, union members,
carrying red, white, and blue let
tered signs, and financial district
young executives and secretaries
who had stopped on their way
to lunch to rubberneck.
The standard props were pres
ent: a Latin musical group com
plete with violins, guitars, and
trumpet played in the street,
button sellers hawked 50 cent
HHH buttons, balloons floated,

and shredded newspapers and
ticker-tape rained down.
But something was definitely
missing. The crowd was esti
mated to be less than ha'f the
size that greeted Richard Nixon
as he followed the same motor
cade route earlier in the Presi
dential campaign.
Enthusiasm Lacking
Beyond the size of the crowd,
another more important ingre
'lirmt was lacking: enthusiasm.
The joy, the outrush of feeling,
the unadulterated love formerly
afforded national political fig
ures was totally missing.
Though interlaced with boos and
catcalls, the cheers and hurrahs
along Montgomery were sadly
iifferent from the tumultuous
welcome given Robert Kennedy
along the same street only last
May.
It was to this lack of enthusi
asm and trust evident in both
demonstrators across the street
from the hotel and onlookers
along Montgomery Street that
Hubert Humphrey addressed his
speech.
After polite welcoming ap
plause from the 1,000 Common
wealth Club members gathered
in the Sheraton-Palace's Garden
Room, the presidential candidate
immediately tried to win back
that lost enthusiasm.
Fresh Proposals Made
Humphrey entitled his speech,
"A new strategy for peace." And
it did contain a number of fresh
ideas and proposals that firmly
place him in the most progres
sive section of his party, and the
establishment political system as
a whole. It was his basic politi
cal premises and philosophy that
lost his across-the-street critics
from the very outset.
Besides the strictly partisan
blasts at Republicans, Richard
Nixon, and an incalcitrant Con
gress that are an integral part
of his campaign rhetoric, Hum
phrey put forth five proposals
that he envisions as leading to
ward a new world peace under
reevaluated American priorities
and goals:
• New Southeast Asia guide
lines. While we should not "turn
our back on Southeast Asia," at
the same time American leader
ship should "carefully assess our
national interests . . . and formu
late policies which will fit new
American guidelines."
Humphrey suggested empha
sis on "self-help, regional and
multilateral responsibility, and
selective American assistance"
as possible new Vietnam guide
lines.
• Control of nuclear arms.
Humphrey advocated "an agree
ment with the Soviet Union on
offensive and defensive missiles
. . . an end to nuclear testing un
der adequate safeguards . . .
and a halt to regional arms races
in the Middle East and else
where." He labeled Nixon as a
man "who equivocates on these
matters of life and death."
• Strengthening of the United
Nations. Humphrey would
"make the UN the instrument
for controlling conflict it has so
far failed to be." He suggested
various financial assistance pro
grams to strengthen the power
of the UN in order to "place in
ternational peacekeeping sol
diers in troubled areas, rather
than American soldiers." He
drew warm applause for this
statement.
Audience Responds
In a nod to the hometown
crowd, Humphrey proposed "to
call a new San Francisco con
ference to rededicate the United
Nations on its twenty-fifth An
niversary, and to seek new ways
of making it work for peace."
The partisan audience greeted
this enthusiasticaly.
• Economic Development. Be
sides lambasting Congress for
"mutilating" the foreign aid
bill, Humphrey called for an end
to the notion that "our particu
lar version of virtue" be at
tached as a prerequisite to aid
appropriations.
• Communications. Stressing
particularly the possible uses of
communication satellites, the
Vice President asked for "new
efforts to promote international
understanding through the use
of exciting developments in com
munications technology."
As an example, Humphrey sug
gested the inauguration of reci
procal television and radio ex
changes between leaders of dif

ferent countries, including the
Soviet Union. "Let's dare; let's
be adventuresome," he declared.
Nothing New Heard
The question-and-answer pe
riod quickly dissolved into a
repetition of old campaign
promises and slogans. Inter
spersing his responses with
flashes of the notorious Hum
phrey humor, the speaker gave
thoroughly anticipated answers
to thoroughly anticipated ques
tions. By the end of the 45-min
ute grilling, Humphrey had
dealt with social security, inde
pendence from President John
son, the conventions at Chicago
and Miami, the draft, the Pue
blo, and law and order (which he
deftly redefined as "a safe so
ciety and a just society").
Vice President Humphrey's
proposals would make most lib
eral hearts rejoice. But the
Commonwealth Club was far
from rejoicing. The San Fran
cisco establishment met Hubert
Humphrey cordially, openly;
they listened, they applauded.
They cheered only after a short
Humphrey tirade against the
failures of the Republican party
over the past 40 years. They
cheered little over today's pros
pects.
Security was lax in this non
hostile atmosphere. Security
guards permitted the candidate
to remain in the hall for more
than 45 minutes shaking hands.
This reporter asked him if he
plans to return for another visit
to Stanford.
'It Depends'
He answered: "I would like to
be able to come to Stanford
again. ... A man should be
free to speak anywhere. It all
depends on you people." Hum
phrey's 1967 speech on the Stan
ford campus was marred by
demonstrations and a walkout.
A short walk through the
Sheraton-Palace lobby led to an
other world. On the street, sev
eral squads of San Francisco po
lice kept guard on the same
group of young demonstrators,
who had waited noisily through
the speech.
These protesters had no one
objective. Some men wore
shoulder-length hair and were
barefoot. Some wore Peace and
Freedom, Black Panther, and
Eldridge Cleaver buttons. Some
carried McCarthy signs, others
anti-HHH posters. And several
were protesting against Viet
nam in specific.
This group was not interested
in hearing about the Vice Presi
dent's peace strategy. They
knew Hubert Humphrey's politi
cal principles, and anything be
yond that was extraneous.
Reaffirms
Indeed, Humphrey in his
speech reaffirmed precisely what
the band on the street rejected
flatly. Communication or under
standing between the two ideol
ogies was totally lacking. Hum
phrey stated, for instance:

"I believe we should regard
our power not as something to
apologize for or cast aside, but
as an active instrument for hu
man betterment.
"Our first objective should be
to reassess, reevaluate, and re
study all our commitments
abroad. We should take inven
tory, not repudiate all our com
mitments. Let us abandon what
needs to be abandoned."
And speaking of what he
learned as a youth in the family
drugstore, "You can change
merchandise without changing
the name of the store."
The rhetoric of the youth out
side the Sheraton-Palace made
plain their discontent with his
vision of a political system.
"Will he reassess the dead
people?" one young man asked
when informed of the content of
Humphrey's speech. "Did you
see him put his arm around Les
ter Maddox on TV? And Chi
cago and Daley?" demanded an
other.
When told that Humphrey
declared that he "would not be
bound by statements of yester
day," a demonstrator of about
23 who was wearing a Black
Panther button exclaimed,
"What does he stand for today?
He equivocates; he will say any
thing."
Signs
The example of the signs and
posters exhibited by the oppos
ing forces makes this gulf quite
plain. The union-lettered signs
contained phrases like: "H. H.
Humphrey; Our Next President;
Marine Cooks and Stewards."
The 30 hand - lettered signs
sang a totally different tune:
''Remember Chicago, you
swine," "Genocide is the politics
of joy," "No continuation of the
great mistake," "Write in Mc-
Carthy."
The end of the afternoon
came as Humphrey left the
hotel at 3:30 p.m. after a private
luncheon. He was rushed into
the limousine, after meeting

with a storm of boos and "Dump
the Hump" chants. The Cadil
lac, followed by several security
and press cars, sped off.
One of the demonstrators ran
alongside the Vice President's
limousine, screaming repeatedly,
"Fuck the Hump." With a quirk

call on a walkie-talkie, a nearby
police officer summoned a paddy
wagon concealed around the
corner.
The paddy wagon screeched
to a halt, ten officers poured out,
shoved young man inside,
r-mrod off.

came as Humphrey left the
hotel at 3:30 p.m. after a private
luncheon. He was rushed into
the limousine, after meeting

with a storm of boos and "Dump
the Hump" chants. The Cadil
lac, followed by several security
and press cars, sped off.
One of the demonstrators ran
alongside the Vice President's
limousine, screaming repeatedly,
"Fuck the Hump." With a quirk

call on a walkie-talkie, a nearby
police officer summoned a paddy
wagon concealed around the
corner.
The paddy wagon screeched
to a halt, ten officers poured out,
shoved young man inside,
r-mrod off.
Just how wide the enormous
gulf is between American youth
and the political establishment
was made crystal clear yester
day in San Francisco.
In what was termed a "major
foreign policy address," Presi
dential candidate Hubert Hum-

phrey enunciated new proposals
toward achieving world peace
before San Francisco's social
elite in the chandeliered Shera
ton-Palace Hotel.
Outside the hotel, a disorga
nized array of youthful protest
ors angrily rejected the Vice
President's most basic political
premises, making a dialogue im
possible. And of course, there
As Humphrey's Cadillac lim
ousine drew up for the noontime
sine drew up for the noontime
speech at the Sheraton-Palace
located in the heart of San Fran
cisco's steel-and-glass financial
district, he was met by a blast
of jeers, shouts, sign, and chants
of "Dump the Hump," by a
crowd of perhaps 150 demonstra
tors. The cheers of several dozen
Humphrey for President sup
porters, mainly carrying union
made signs, were drowned out.
With a grim expression, the

Vice President ignored the
crowd and hurried inside, pro
ceeded by a phalanx of secret
service, treasury, narcotics bu
reau, and Humphrey staff
guards.
The tone of the afternoon was
set even before Humphrey ar
rived at the hotel. Several blocks
away, Democratic workers had
prepared a traditional motorcade
parade down Montgomery Street,
the center of the west coast bus
iness world.

All details were assiduously
cared for: lining the streets were
children who had been excused
from school, union members,
carrying red, white, and blue let
tered signs, and financial district
young executives and secretaries
who had stopped on their way
to lunch to rubberneck.
The standard props were pres
ent: a Latin musical group com
plete with violins, guitars, and
trumpet played in the street,
button sellers hawked 50 cent
HHH buttons, balloons floated,

and shredded newspapers and
ticker-tape rained down.
But something was definitely
missing. The crowd was esti
mated to be less than ha'f the
size that greeted Richard Nixon
as he followed the same motor
cade route earlier in the Presi
dential campaign.
Enthusiasm Lacking
Beyond the size of the crowd,
another more important ingre
'lirmt was lacking: enthusiasm.
The joy, the outrush of feeling,
the unadulterated love formerly
afforded national political fig
ures was totally missing.
Though interlaced with boos and
catcalls, the cheers and hurrahs
along Montgomery were sadly
iifferent from the tumultuous
welcome given Robert Kennedy
along the same street only last
May.
It was to this lack of enthusi
asm and trust evident in both
demonstrators across the street
from the hotel and onlookers
along Montgomery Street that
Hubert Humphrey addressed his
speech.
After polite welcoming ap
plause from the 1,000 Common
wealth Club members gathered
in the Sheraton-Palace's Garden
Room, the presidential candidate
immediately tried to win back
that lost enthusiasm.
Fresh Proposals Made
Humphrey entitled his speech,
"A new strategy for peace." And
it did contain a number of fresh
ideas and proposals that firmly
place him in the most progres
sive section of his party, and the
establishment political system as
a whole. It was his basic politi
cal premises and philosophy that
lost his across-the-street critics
from the very outset.
Besides the strictly partisan
blasts at Republicans, Richard
Nixon, and an incalcitrant Con
gress that are an integral part
of his campaign rhetoric, Hum
phrey put forth five proposals
that he envisions as leading to
ward a new world peace under
reevaluated American priorities
and goals:
• New Southeast Asia guide
lines. While we should not "turn
our back on Southeast Asia," at
the same time American leader
ship should "carefully assess our
national interests . . . and formu
late policies which will fit new
American guidelines."
Humphrey suggested empha
sis on "self-help, regional and
multilateral responsibility, and
selective American assistance"
as possible new Vietnam guide
lines.
• Control of nuclear arms.
Humphrey advocated "an agree
ment with the Soviet Union on
offensive and defensive missiles
. . . an end to nuclear testing un
der adequate safeguards . . .
and a halt to regional arms races
in the Middle East and else
where." He labeled Nixon as a
man "who equivocates on these
matters of life and death."
• Strengthening of the United
Nations. Humphrey would
"make the UN the instrument
for controlling conflict it has so
far failed to be." He suggested
various financial assistance pro
grams to strengthen the power
of the UN in order to "place in
ternational peacekeeping sol
diers in troubled areas, rather
than American soldiers." He
drew warm applause for this
statement.
Audience Responds
In a nod to the hometown
crowd, Humphrey proposed "to
call a new San Francisco con
ference to rededicate the United
Nations on its twenty-fifth An
niversary, and to seek new ways
of making it work for peace."
The partisan audience greeted
this enthusiasticaly.
• Economic Development. Be
sides lambasting Congress for
"mutilating" the foreign aid
bill, Humphrey called for an end
to the notion that "our particu
lar version of virtue" be at
tached as a prerequisite to aid
appropriations.
• Communications. Stressing
particularly the possible uses of
communication satellites, the
Vice President asked for "new
efforts to promote international
understanding through the use
of exciting developments in com
munications technology."
As an example, Humphrey sug
gested the inauguration of reci
procal television and radio ex
changes between leaders of dif

ferent countries, including the
Soviet Union. "Let's dare; let's
be adventuresome," he declared.
Nothing New Heard
The question-and-answer pe
riod quickly dissolved into a
repetition of old campaign
promises and slogans. Inter
spersing his responses with
flashes of the notorious Hum
phrey humor, the speaker gave
thoroughly anticipated answers
to thoroughly anticipated ques
tions. By the end of the 45-min
ute grilling, Humphrey had
dealt with social security, inde
pendence from President John
son, the conventions at Chicago
and Miami, the draft, the Pue
blo, and law and order (which he
deftly redefined as "a safe so
ciety and a just society").
Vice President Humphrey's
proposals would make most lib
eral hearts rejoice. But the
Commonwealth Club was far
from rejoicing. The San Fran
cisco establishment met Hubert
Humphrey cordially, openly;
they listened, they applauded.
They cheered only after a short
Humphrey tirade against the
failures of the Republican party
over the past 40 years. They
cheered little over today's pros
pects.
Security was lax in this non
hostile atmosphere. Security
guards permitted the candidate
to remain in the hall for more
than 45 minutes shaking hands.
This reporter asked him if he
plans to return for another visit
to Stanford.
'It Depends'
He answered: "I would like to
be able to come to Stanford
again. ... A man should be
free to speak anywhere. It all
depends on you people." Hum
phrey's 1967 speech on the Stan
ford campus was marred by
demonstrations and a walkout.
A short walk through the
Sheraton-Palace lobby led to an
other world. On the street, sev
eral squads of San Francisco po
lice kept guard on the same
group of young demonstrators,
who had waited noisily through
the speech.
These protesters had no one
objective. Some men wore
shoulder-length hair and were
barefoot. Some wore Peace and
Freedom, Black Panther, and
Eldridge Cleaver buttons. Some
carried McCarthy signs, others
anti-HHH posters. And several
were protesting against Viet
nam in specific.
This group was not interested
in hearing about the Vice Presi
dent's peace strategy. They
knew Hubert Humphrey's politi
cal principles, and anything be
yond that was extraneous.
Reaffirms
Indeed, Humphrey in his
speech reaffirmed precisely what
the band on the street rejected
flatly. Communication or under
standing between the two ideol
ogies was totally lacking. Hum
phrey stated, for instance:

"I believe we should regard
our power not as something to
apologize for or cast aside, but
as an active instrument for hu
man betterment.
"Our first objective should be
to reassess, reevaluate, and re
study all our commitments
abroad. We should take inven
tory, not repudiate all our com
mitments. Let us abandon what
needs to be abandoned."
And speaking of what he
learned as a youth in the family
drugstore, "You can change
merchandise without changing
the name of the store."
The rhetoric of the youth out
side the Sheraton-Palace made
plain their discontent with his
vision of a political system.
"Will he reassess the dead
people?" one young man asked
when informed of the content of
Humphrey's speech. "Did you
see him put his arm around Les
ter Maddox on TV? And Chi
cago and Daley?" demanded an
other.
When told that Humphrey
declared that he "would not be
bound by statements of yester
day," a demonstrator of about
23 who was wearing a Black
Panther button exclaimed,
"What does he stand for today?
He equivocates; he will say any
thing."
Signs
The example of the signs and
posters exhibited by the oppos
ing forces makes this gulf quite
plain. The union-lettered signs
contained phrases like: "H. H.
Humphrey; Our Next President;
Marine Cooks and Stewards."
The 30 hand - lettered signs
sang a totally different tune:
''Remember Chicago, you
swine," "Genocide is the politics
of joy," "No continuation of the
great mistake," "Write in Mc-
Carthy."
The end of the afternoon
came as Humphrey left the
hotel at 3:30 p.m. after a private
luncheon. He was rushed into
the limousine, after meeting

Panther button exclaimed,
"What does he stand for today?
He equivocates; he will say any
thing."
Signs
The example of the signs and
posters exhibited by the oppos
ing forces makes this gulf quite
plain. The union-lettered signs
contained phrases like: "H. H.
Humphrey; Our Next President;
Marine Cooks and Stewards."
The 30 hand - lettered signs
sang a totally different tune:
''Remember Chicago, you
swine," "Genocide is the politics
of joy," "No continuation of the
great mistake," "Write in Mc-
Carthy."
The end of the afternoon
came as Humphrey left the
hotel at 3:30 p.m. after a private
luncheon. He was rushed into
the limousine, after meeting

with a storm of boos and "Dump
the Hump" chants. The Cadil
lac, followed by several security
and press cars, sped off.
One of the demonstrators ran
alongside the Vice President's
limousine, screaming repeatedly,
"Fuck the Hump." With a quirk

call on a walkie-talkie, a nearby
police officer summoned a paddy
wagon concealed around the
corner.
The paddy wagon screeched
to a halt, ten officers poured out,
shoved young man inside,
r-mrod off.
Just how wide the enormous
gulf is between American youth
and the political establishment
was made crystal clear yester
day in San Francisco.
In what was termed a "major
foreign policy address," Presi
dential candidate Hubert Hum-

phrey enunciated new proposals
toward achieving world peace
before San Francisco's social
elite in the chandeliered Shera
ton-Palace Hotel.
Outside the hotel, a disorga
nized array of youthful protest
ors angrily rejected the Vice
President's most basic political
premises, making a dialogue im
possible. And of course, there
As Humphrey's Cadillac lim
ousine drew up for the noontime
sine drew up for the noontime
speech at the Sheraton-Palace
located in the heart of San Fran
cisco's steel-and-glass financial
district, he was met by a blast
of jeers, shouts, sign, and chants
of "Dump the Hump," by a
crowd of perhaps 150 demonstra
tors. The cheers of several dozen
Humphrey for President sup
porters, mainly carrying union
made signs, were drowned out.
With a grim expression, the

Vice President ignored the
crowd and hurried inside, pro
ceeded by a phalanx of secret
service, treasury, narcotics bu
reau, and Humphrey staff
guards.
The tone of the afternoon was
set even before Humphrey ar
rived at the hotel. Several blocks
away, Democratic workers had
prepared a traditional motorcade
parade down Montgomery Street,
the center of the west coast bus
iness world.

All details were assiduously
cared for: lining the streets were
children who had been excused
from school, union members,
carrying red, white, and blue let
tered signs, and financial district
young executives and secretaries
who had stopped on their way
to lunch to rubberneck.
The standard props were pres
ent: a Latin musical group com
plete with violins, guitars, and
trumpet played in the street,
button sellers hawked 50 cent
HHH buttons, balloons floated,

and shredded newspapers and
ticker-tape rained down.
But something was definitely
missing. The crowd was esti
mated to be less than ha'f the
size that greeted Richard Nixon
as he followed the same motor
cade route earlier in the Presi
dential campaign.
Enthusiasm Lacking
Beyond the size of the crowd,
another more important ingre
'lirmt was lacking: enthusiasm.
The joy, the outrush of feeling,
the unadulterated love formerly
afforded national political fig
ures was totally missing.
Though interlaced with boos and
catcalls, the cheers and hurrahs
along Montgomery were sadly
iifferent from the tumultuous
welcome given Robert Kennedy
along the same street only last
May.
It was to this lack of enthusi
asm and trust evident in both
demonstrators across the street
from the hotel and onlookers
along Montgomery Street that
Hubert Humphrey addressed his
speech.
After polite welcoming ap
plause from the 1,000 Common
wealth Club members gathered
in the Sheraton-Palace's Garden
Room, the presidential candidate
immediately tried to win back
that lost enthusiasm.
Fresh Proposals Made
Humphrey entitled his speech,
"A new strategy for peace." And
it did contain a number of fresh
ideas and proposals that firmly
place him in the most progres
sive section of his party, and the
establishment political system as
a whole. It was his basic politi
cal premises and philosophy that
lost his across-the-street critics
from the very outset.
Besides the strictly partisan
blasts at Republicans, Richard
Nixon, and an incalcitrant Con
gress that are an integral part
of his campaign rhetoric, Hum
phrey put forth five proposals
that he envisions as leading to
ward a new world peace under
reevaluated American priorities
and goals:
• New Southeast Asia guide
lines. While we should not "turn
our back on Southeast Asia," at
the same time American leader
ship should "carefully assess our
national interests . . . and formu
late policies which will fit new
American guidelines."
Humphrey suggested empha
sis on "self-help, regional and
multilateral responsibility, and
selective American assistance"
as possible new Vietnam guide
lines.
• Control of nuclear arms.
Humphrey advocated "an agree
ment with the Soviet Union on
offensive and defensive missiles
. . . an end to nuclear testing un
der adequate safeguards . . .
and a halt to regional arms races
in the Middle East and else
where." He labeled Nixon as a
man "who equivocates on these
matters of life and death."
• Strengthening of the United
Nations. Humphrey would
"make the UN the instrument
for controlling conflict it has so
far failed to be." He suggested
various financial assistance pro
grams to strengthen the power
of the UN in order to "place in
ternational peacekeeping sol
diers in troubled areas, rather
than American soldiers." He
drew warm applause for this
statement.
Audience Responds
In a nod to the hometown
crowd, Humphrey proposed "to
call a new San Francisco con
ference to rededicate the United
Nations on its twenty-fifth An
niversary, and to seek new ways
of making it work for peace."
The partisan audience greeted
this enthusiasticaly.
• Economic Development. Be
sides lambasting Congress for
"mutilating" the foreign aid
bill, Humphrey called for an end
to the notion that "our particu
lar version of virtue" be at
tached as a prerequisite to aid
appropriations.
• Communications. Stressing
particularly the possible uses of
communication satellites, the
Vice President asked for "new
efforts to promote international
understanding through the use
of exciting developments in com
munications technology."
As an example, Humphrey sug
gested the inauguration of reci
procal television and radio ex
changes between leaders of dif

ferent countries, including the
Soviet Union. "Let's dare; let's
be adventuresome," he declared.
Nothing New Heard
The question-and-answer pe
riod quickly dissolved into a
repetition of old campaign
promises and slogans. Inter
spersing his responses with
flashes of the notorious Hum
phrey humor, the speaker gave
thoroughly anticipated answers
to thoroughly anticipated ques
tions. By the end of the 45-min
ute grilling, Humphrey had
dealt with social security, inde
pendence from President John
son, the conventions at Chicago
and Miami, the draft, the Pue
blo, and law and order (which he
deftly redefined as "a safe so
ciety and a just society").
Vice President Humphrey's
proposals would make most lib
eral hearts rejoice. But the
Commonwealth Club was far
from rejoicing. The San Fran
cisco establishment met Hubert
Humphrey cordially, openly;
they listened, they applauded.
They cheered only after a short
Humphrey tirade against the
failures of the Republican party
over the past 40 years. They
cheered little over today's pros
pects.
Security was lax in this non
hostile atmosphere. Security
guards permitted the candidate
to remain in the hall for more
than 45 minutes shaking hands.
This reporter asked him if he
plans to return for another visit
to Stanford.
'It Depends'
He answered: "I would like to
be able to come to Stanford
again. ... A man should be
free to speak anywhere. It all
depends on you people." Hum
phrey's 1967 speech on the Stan
ford campus was marred by
demonstrations and a walkout.
A short walk through the
Sheraton-Palace lobby led to an
other world. On the street, sev
eral squads of San Francisco po
lice kept guard on the same
group of young demonstrators,
who had waited noisily through
the speech.
These protesters had no one
objective. Some men wore
shoulder-length hair and were
barefoot. Some wore Peace and
Freedom, Black Panther, and
Eldridge Cleaver buttons. Some
carried McCarthy signs, others
anti-HHH posters. And several
were protesting against Viet
nam in specific.
This group was not interested
in hearing about the Vice Presi
dent's peace strategy. They
knew Hubert Humphrey's politi
cal principles, and anything be
yond that was extraneous.
Reaffirms
Indeed, Humphrey in his
speech reaffirmed precisely what
the band on the street rejected
flatly. Communication or under
standing between the two ideol
ogies was totally lacking. Hum
phrey stated, for instance:

"I believe we should regard
our power not as something to
apologize for or cast aside, but
as an active instrument for hu
man betterment.
"Our first objective should be
to reassess, reevaluate, and re
study all our commitments
abroad. We should take inven
tory, not repudiate all our com
mitments. Let us abandon what
needs to be abandoned."
And speaking of what he
learned as a youth in the family
drugstore, "You can change
merchandise without changing
the name of the store."
The rhetoric of the youth out
side the Sheraton-Palace made
plain their discontent with his
vision of a political system.
"Will he reassess the dead
people?" one young man asked
when informed of the content of
Humphrey's speech. "Did you
see him put his arm around Les
ter Maddox on TV? And Chi
cago and Daley?" demanded an
other.
When told that Humphrey
declared that he "would not be
bound by statements of yester
day," a demonstrator of about
23 who was wearing a Black
Panther button exclaimed,
"What does he stand for today?
He equivocates; he will say any
thing."

learned as a youth in the family
drugstore, "You can change
merchandise without changing
the name of the store."
The rhetoric of the youth out
side the Sheraton-Palace made
plain their discontent with his
vision of a political system.
"Will he reassess the dead
people?" one young man asked
when informed of the content of
Humphrey's speech. "Did you
see him put his arm around Les
ter Maddox on TV? And Chi
cago and Daley?" demanded an
other.
When told that Humphrey
declared that he "would not be
bound by statements of yester
day," a demonstrator of about
23 who was wearing a Black
Panther button exclaimed,
"What does he stand for today?
He equivocates; he will say any
thing."
Signs
The example of the signs and
posters exhibited by the oppos
ing forces makes this gulf quite
plain. The union-lettered signs
contained phrases like: "H. H.
Humphrey; Our Next President;
Marine Cooks and Stewards."
The 30 hand - lettered signs
sang a totally different tune:
''Remember Chicago, you
swine," "Genocide is the politics
of joy," "No continuation of the
great mistake," "Write in Mc-
Carthy."
The end of the afternoon
came as Humphrey left the
hotel at 3:30 p.m. after a private
luncheon. He was rushed into
the limousine, after meeting

with a storm of boos and "Dump
the Hump" chants. The Cadil
lac, followed by several security
and press cars, sped off.
One of the demonstrators ran
alongside the Vice President's
limousine, screaming repeatedly,
"Fuck the Hump." With a quirk

call on a walkie-talkie, a nearby
police officer summoned a paddy
wagon concealed around the
corner.
The paddy wagon screeched
to a halt, ten officers poured out,
shoved young man inside,
r-mrod off.
Just how wide the enormous
gulf is between American youth
and the political establishment
was made crystal clear yester
day in San Francisco.
In what was termed a "major
foreign policy address," Presi
dential candidate Hubert Hum-

phrey enunciated new proposals
toward achieving world peace
before San Francisco's social
elite in the chandeliered Shera
ton-Palace Hotel.
Outside the hotel, a disorga
nized array of youthful protest
ors angrily rejected the Vice
President's most basic political
premises, making a dialogue im
possible. And of course, there
As Humphrey's Cadillac lim
ousine drew up for the noontime
sine drew up for the noontime
speech at the Sheraton-Palace
located in the heart of San Fran
cisco's steel-and-glass financial
district, he was met by a blast
of jeers, shouts, sign, and chants
of "Dump the Hump," by a
crowd of perhaps 150 demonstra
tors. The cheers of several dozen
Humphrey for President sup
porters, mainly carrying union
made signs, were drowned out.
With a grim expression, the

Vice President ignored the
crowd and hurried inside, pro
ceeded by a phalanx of secret
service, treasury, narcotics bu
reau, and Humphrey staff
guards.
The tone of the afternoon was
set even before Humphrey ar
rived at the hotel. Several blocks
away, Democratic workers had
prepared a traditional motorcade
parade down Montgomery Street,
the center of the west coast bus
iness world.

All details were assiduously
cared for: lining the streets were
children who had been excused
from school, union members,
carrying red, white, and blue let
tered signs, and financial district
young executives and secretaries
who had stopped on their way
to lunch to rubberneck.
The standard props were pres
ent: a Latin musical group com
plete with violins, guitars, and
trumpet played in the street,
button sellers hawked 50 cent
HHH buttons, balloons floated,

and shredded newspapers and
ticker-tape rained down.
But something was definitely
missing. The crowd was esti
mated to be less than ha'f the
size that greeted Richard Nixon
as he followed the same motor
cade route earlier in the Presi
dential campaign.
Enthusiasm Lacking
Beyond the size of the crowd,
another more important ingre
'lirmt was lacking: enthusiasm.
The joy, the outrush of feeling,
the unadulterated love formerly
afforded national political fig
ures was totally missing.
Though interlaced with boos and
catcalls, the cheers and hurrahs
along Montgomery were sadly
iifferent from the tumultuous
welcome given Robert Kennedy
along the same street only last
May.
It was to this lack of enthusi
asm and trust evident in both
demonstrators across the street
from the hotel and onlookers
along Montgomery Street that
Hubert Humphrey addressed his
speech.
After polite welcoming ap
plause from the 1,000 Common
wealth Club members gathered
in the Sheraton-Palace's Garden
Room, the presidential candidate
immediately tried to win back
that lost enthusiasm.
Fresh Proposals Made
Humphrey entitled his speech,
"A new strategy for peace." And
it did contain a number of fresh
ideas and proposals that firmly
place him in the most progres
sive section of his party, and the
establishment political system as
a whole. It was his basic politi
cal premises and philosophy that
lost his across-the-street critics
from the very outset.
Besides the strictly partisan
blasts at Republicans, Richard
Nixon, and an incalcitrant Con
gress that are an integral part
of his campaign rhetoric, Hum
phrey put forth five proposals
that he envisions as leading to
ward a new world peace under
reevaluated American priorities
and goals:
• New Southeast Asia guide
lines. While we should not "turn
our back on Southeast Asia," at
the same time American leader
ship should "carefully assess our
national interests . . . and formu
late policies which will fit new
American guidelines."
Humphrey suggested empha
sis on "self-help, regional and
multilateral responsibility, and
selective American assistance"
as possible new Vietnam guide
lines.
• Control of nuclear arms.
Humphrey advocated "an agree
ment with the Soviet Union on
offensive and defensive missiles
. . . an end to nuclear testing un
der adequate safeguards . . .
and a halt to regional arms races
in the Middle East and else
where." He labeled Nixon as a
man "who equivocates on these
matters of life and death."
• Strengthening of the United
Nations. Humphrey would
"make the UN the instrument
for controlling conflict it has so
far failed to be." He suggested
various financial assistance pro
grams to strengthen the power
of the UN in order to "place in
ternational peacekeeping sol
diers in troubled areas, rather
than American soldiers." He
drew warm applause for this
statement.
Audience Responds
In a nod to the hometown
crowd, Humphrey proposed "to
call a new San Francisco con
ference to rededicate the United
Nations on its twenty-fifth An
niversary, and to seek new ways
of making it work for peace."
The partisan audience greeted
this enthusiasticaly.
• Economic Development. Be
sides lambasting Congress for
"mutilating" the foreign aid
bill, Humphrey called for an end
to the notion that "our particu
lar version of virtue" be at
tached as a prerequisite to aid
appropriations.
• Communications. Stressing
particularly the possible uses of
communication satellites, the
Vice President asked for "new
efforts to promote international
understanding through the use
of exciting developments in com
munications technology."
As an example, Humphrey sug
gested the inauguration of reci
procal television and radio ex
changes between leaders of dif

ferent countries, including the
Soviet Union. "Let's dare; let's
be adventuresome," he declared.
Nothing New Heard
The question-and-answer pe
riod quickly dissolved into a
repetition of old campaign
promises and slogans. Inter
spersing his responses with
flashes of the notorious Hum
phrey humor, the speaker gave
thoroughly anticipated answers
to thoroughly anticipated ques
tions. By the end of the 45-min
ute grilling, Humphrey had
dealt with social security, inde
pendence from President John
son, the conventions at Chicago
and Miami, the draft, the Pue
blo, and law and order (which he
deftly redefined as "a safe so
ciety and a just society").
Vice President Humphrey's
proposals would make most lib
eral hearts rejoice. But the
Commonwealth Club was far
from rejoicing. The San Fran
cisco establishment met Hubert
Humphrey cordially, openly;
they listened, they applauded.
They cheered only after a short
Humphrey tirade against the
failures of the Republican party
over the past 40 years. They
cheered little over today's pros
pects.
Security was lax in this non
hostile atmosphere. Security
guards permitted the candidate
to remain in the hall for more
than 45 minutes shaking hands.
This reporter asked him if he
plans to return for another visit
to Stanford.
'It Depends'
He answered: "I would like to
be able to come to Stanford
again. ... A man should be
free to speak anywhere. It all
depends on you people." Hum
phrey's 1967 speech on the Stan
ford campus was marred by
demonstrations and a walkout.
A short walk through the
Sheraton-Palace lobby led to an
other world. On the street, sev
eral squads of San Francisco po
lice kept guard on the same
group of young demonstrators,
who had waited noisily through
the speech.
These protesters had no one
objective. Some men wore
shoulder-length hair and were
barefoot. Some wore Peace and
Freedom, Black Panther, and
Eldridge Cleaver buttons. Some
carried McCarthy signs, others
anti-HHH posters. And several
were protesting against Viet
nam in specific.
This group was not interested
in hearing about the Vice Presi
dent's peace strategy. They
knew Hubert Humphrey's politi
cal principles, and anything be
yond that was extraneous.
Reaffirms
Indeed, Humphrey in his
speech reaffirmed precisely what
the band on the street rejected
flatly. Communication or under
standing between the two ideol
ogies was totally lacking. Hum
phrey stated, for instance:

"I believe we should regard
our power not as something to
apologize for or cast aside, but
as an active instrument for hu
man betterment.
"Our first objective should be
to reassess, reevaluate, and re
study all our commitments
abroad. We should take inven
tory, not repudiate all our com
mitments. Let us abandon what
needs to be abandoned."
And speaking of what he
learned as a youth in the family
drugstore, "You can change
merchandise without changing
the name of the store."
The rhetoric of the youth out
side the Sheraton-Palace made
plain their discontent with his

Indeed, Humphrey in his
speech reaffirmed precisely what
the band on the street rejected
flatly. Communication or under
standing between the two ideol
ogies was totally lacking. Hum
phrey stated, for instance:

"I believe we should regard
our power not as something to
apologize for or cast aside, but
as an active instrument for hu
man betterment.
"Our first objective should be
to reassess, reevaluate, and re
study all our commitments
abroad. We should take inven
tory, not repudiate all our com
mitments. Let us abandon what
needs to be abandoned."
And speaking of what he
learned as a youth in the family
drugstore, "You can change
merchandise without changing
the name of the store."
The rhetoric of the youth out
side the Sheraton-Palace made
plain their discontent with his
vision of a political system.
"Will he reassess the dead
people?" one young man asked
when informed of the content of
Humphrey's speech. "Did you
see him put his arm around Les
ter Maddox on TV? And Chi
cago and Daley?" demanded an
other.
When told that Humphrey
declared that he "would not be
bound by statements of yester
day," a demonstrator of about
23 who was wearing a Black
Panther button exclaimed,
"What does he stand for today?
He equivocates; he will say any
thing."
Signs
The example of the signs and
posters exhibited by the oppos
ing forces makes this gulf quite
plain. The union-lettered signs
contained phrases like: "H. H.
Humphrey; Our Next President;
Marine Cooks and Stewards."
The 30 hand - lettered signs
sang a totally different tune:
''Remember Chicago, you
swine," "Genocide is the politics
of joy," "No continuation of the
great mistake," "Write in Mc-
Carthy."
The end of the afternoon
came as Humphrey left the
hotel at 3:30 p.m. after a private
luncheon. He was rushed into
the limousine, after meeting

with a storm of boos and "Dump
the Hump" chants. The Cadil
lac, followed by several security
and press cars, sped off.
One of the demonstrators ran
alongside the Vice President's
limousine, screaming repeatedly,
"Fuck the Hump." With a quirk

call on a walkie-talkie, a nearby
police officer summoned a paddy
wagon concealed around the
corner.
The paddy wagon screeched
to a halt, ten officers poured out,
shoved young man inside,
r-mrod off.
Just how wide the enormous
gulf is between American youth
and the political establishment
was made crystal clear yester
day in San Francisco.
In what was termed a "major
foreign policy address," Presi
dential candidate Hubert Hum-

phrey enunciated new proposals
toward achieving world peace
before San Francisco's social
elite in the chandeliered Shera
ton-Palace Hotel.
Outside the hotel, a disorga
nized array of youthful protest
ors angrily rejected the Vice
President's most basic political
premises, making a dialogue im
possible. And of course, there
As Humphrey's Cadillac lim
ousine drew up for the noontime
sine drew up for the noontime
speech at the Sheraton-Palace
located in the heart of San Fran
cisco's steel-and-glass financial
district, he was met by a blast
of jeers, shouts, sign, and chants
of "Dump the Hump," by a
crowd of perhaps 150 demonstra
tors. The cheers of several dozen
Humphrey for President sup
porters, mainly carrying union
made signs, were drowned out.
With a grim expression, the

Vice President ignored the
crowd and hurried inside, pro
ceeded by a phalanx of secret
service, treasury, narcotics bu
reau, and Humphrey staff
guards.
The tone of the afternoon was
set even before Humphrey ar
rived at the hotel. Several blocks
away, Democratic workers had
prepared a traditional motorcade
parade down Montgomery Street,
the center of the west coast bus
iness world.

All details were assiduously
cared for: lining the streets were
children who had been excused
from school, union members,
carrying red, white, and blue let
tered signs, and financial district
young executives and secretaries
who had stopped on their way
to lunch to rubberneck.
The standard props were pres
ent: a Latin musical group com
plete with violins, guitars, and
trumpet played in the street,
button sellers hawked 50 cent
HHH buttons, balloons floated,

and shredded newspapers and
ticker-tape rained down.
But something was definitely
missing. The crowd was esti
mated to be less than ha'f the
size that greeted Richard Nixon
as he followed the same motor
cade route earlier in the Presi
dential campaign.
Enthusiasm Lacking
Beyond the size of the crowd,
another more important ingre
'lirmt was lacking: enthusiasm.
The joy, the outrush of feeling,
the unadulterated love formerly
afforded national political fig
ures was totally missing.
Though interlaced with boos and
catcalls, the cheers and hurrahs
along Montgomery were sadly
iifferent from the tumultuous
welcome given Robert Kennedy
along the same street only last
May.
It was to this lack of enthusi
asm and trust evident in both
demonstrators across the street
from the hotel and onlookers
along Montgomery Street that
Hubert Humphrey addressed his
speech.
After polite welcoming ap
plause from the 1,000 Common
wealth Club members gathered
in the Sheraton-Palace's Garden
Room, the presidential candidate
immediately tried to win back
that lost enthusiasm.
Fresh Proposals Made
Humphrey entitled his speech,
"A new strategy for peace." And
it did contain a number of fresh
ideas and proposals that firmly
place him in the most progres
sive section of his party, and the
establishment political system as
a whole. It was his basic politi
cal premises and philosophy that
lost his across-the-street critics
from the very outset.
Besides the strictly partisan
blasts at Republicans, Richard
Nixon, and an incalcitrant Con
gress that are an integral part
of his campaign rhetoric, Hum
phrey put forth five proposals
that he envisions as leading to
ward a new world peace under
reevaluated American priorities
and goals:
• New Southeast Asia guide
lines. While we should not "turn
our back on Southeast Asia," at
the same time American leader
ship should "carefully assess our
national interests . . . and formu
late policies which will fit new
American guidelines."
Humphrey suggested empha
sis on "self-help, regional and
multilateral responsibility, and
selective American assistance"
as possible new Vietnam guide
lines.
• Control of nuclear arms.
Humphrey advocated "an agree
ment with the Soviet Union on
offensive and defensive missiles
. . . an end to nuclear testing un
der adequate safeguards . . .
and a halt to regional arms races
in the Middle East and else
where." He labeled Nixon as a
man "who equivocates on these
matters of life and death."
• Strengthening of the United
Nations. Humphrey would
"make the UN the instrument
for controlling conflict it has so
far failed to be." He suggested
various financial assistance pro
grams to strengthen the power
of the UN in order to "place in
ternational peacekeeping sol
diers in troubled areas, rather
than American soldiers." He
drew warm applause for this
statement.
Audience Responds
In a nod to the hometown
crowd, Humphrey proposed "to
call a new San Francisco con
ference to rededicate the United
Nations on its twenty-fifth An
niversary, and to seek new ways
of making it work for peace."
The partisan audience greeted
this enthusiasticaly.
• Economic Development. Be
sides lambasting Congress for
"mutilating" the foreign aid
bill, Humphrey called for an end
to the notion that "our particu
lar version of virtue" be at
tached as a prerequisite to aid
appropriations.
• Communications. Stressing
particularly the possible uses of
communication satellites, the
Vice President asked for "new
efforts to promote international
understanding through the use
of exciting developments in com
munications technology."
As an example, Humphrey sug
gested the inauguration of reci
procal television and radio ex
changes between leaders of dif

ferent countries, including the
Soviet Union. "Let's dare; let's
be adventuresome," he declared.
Nothing New Heard
The question-and-answer pe
riod quickly dissolved into a
repetition of old campaign
promises and slogans. Inter
spersing his responses with
flashes of the notorious Hum
phrey humor, the speaker gave
thoroughly anticipated answers
to thoroughly anticipated ques
tions. By the end of the 45-min
ute grilling, Humphrey had
dealt with social security, inde
pendence from President John
son, the conventions at Chicago
and Miami, the draft, the Pue
blo, and law and order (which he
deftly redefined as "a safe so
ciety and a just society").
Vice President Humphrey's
proposals would make most lib
eral hearts rejoice. But the
Commonwealth Club was far
from rejoicing. The San Fran
cisco establishment met Hubert
Humphrey cordially, openly;
they listened, they applauded.
They cheered only after a short
Humphrey tirade against the
failures of the Republican party
over the past 40 years. They
cheered little over today's pros
pects.
Security was lax in this non
hostile atmosphere. Security
guards permitted the candidate
to remain in the hall for more
than 45 minutes shaking hands.
This reporter asked him if he
plans to return for another visit
to Stanford.
'It Depends'
He answered: "I would like to
be able to come to Stanford
again. ... A man should be
free to speak anywhere. It all
depends on you people." Hum
phrey's 1967 speech on the Stan
ford campus was marred by
demonstrations and a walkout.
A short walk through the
Sheraton-Palace lobby led to an
other world. On the street, sev
eral squads of San Francisco po
lice kept guard on the same
group of young demonstrators,
who had waited noisily through
the speech.
These protesters had no one
objective. Some men wore
shoulder-length hair and were
barefoot. Some wore Peace and
Freedom, Black Panther, and
Eldridge Cleaver buttons. Some
carried McCarthy signs, others
anti-HHH posters. And several
were protesting against Viet
nam in specific.
This group was not interested
in hearing about the Vice Presi
dent's peace strategy. They
knew Hubert Humphrey's politi
cal principles, and anything be
yond that was extraneous.
