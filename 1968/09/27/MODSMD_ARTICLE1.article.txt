# Humphrey In San Francisco
## Youth Versus Old Politics News Analysis 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Just how wide the enormous
gulf is between American youth
and the political establishment
was made crystal clear yester
day in San Francisco.
In what was termed a "major
foreign policy address," Presi
dential candidate Hubert Hum-

phrey enunciated new proposals
toward achieving world peace
before San Francisco's social
elite in the chandeliered Shera
ton-Palace Hotel.
Outside the hotel, a disorga
nized array of youthful protest
ors angrily rejected the Vice
President's most basic political
premises, making a dialogue im
possible. And of course, there
As Humphrey's Cadillac lim
ousine drew up for the noontime
sine drew up for the noontime
speech at the Sheraton-Palace
located in the heart of San Fran
cisco's steel-and-glass financial
district, he was met by a blast
of jeers, shouts, sign, and chants
of "Dump the Hump," by a
crowd of perhaps 150 demonstra
tors. The cheers of several dozen
Humphrey for President sup
porters, mainly carrying union
made signs, were drowned out.
With a grim expression, the

Vice President ignored the
crowd and hurried inside, pro
ceeded by a phalanx of secret
service, treasury, narcotics bu
reau, and Humphrey staff
guards.
The tone of the afternoon was
set even before Humphrey ar
rived at the hotel. Several blocks
away, Democratic workers had
prepared a traditional motorcade
parade down Montgomery Street,
the center of the west coast bus
iness world.

All details were assiduously
cared for: lining the streets were
children who had been excused
from school, union members,
carrying red, white, and blue let
tered signs, and financial district
young executives and secretaries
who had stopped on their way
to lunch to rubberneck.
The standard props were pres
ent: a Latin musical group com
plete with violins, guitars, and
trumpet played in the street,
button sellers hawked 50 cent
HHH buttons, balloons floated,

and shredded newspapers and
ticker-tape rained down.
But something was definitely
missing. The crowd was esti
mated to be less than ha'f the
size that greeted Richard Nixon
as he followed the same motor
cade route earlier in the Presi
dential campaign.
Enthusiasm Lacking
Beyond the size of the crowd,
another more important ingre
'lirmt was lacking: enthusiasm.
The joy, the outrush of feeling,
the unadulterated love formerly
afforded national political fig
ures was totally missing.
Though interlaced with boos and
catcalls, the cheers and hurrahs
along Montgomery were sadly
iifferent from the tumultuous
welcome given Robert Kennedy
along the same street only last
May.
It was to this lack of enthusi
asm and trust evident in both
demonstrators across the street
from the hotel and onlookers
along Montgomery Street that
Hubert Humphrey addressed his
speech.
After polite welcoming ap
plause from the 1,000 Common
wealth Club members gathered
in the Sheraton-Palace's Garden
Room, the presidential candidate
immediately tried to win back
that lost enthusiasm.
Fresh Proposals Made
Humphrey entitled his speech,
"A new strategy for peace." And
it did contain a number of fresh
ideas and proposals that firmly
place him in the most progres
sive section of his party, and the
