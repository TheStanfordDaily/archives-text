# Curse That Ratio!

### MARK PERELLA 
So here you are at Stanford!
It's a beautiful place, isn't it?
Lots of trees, lots of flowers,
lots of red tiles . . . You've come
here to discover math, or phys
ics, or history; but most of all
just to discover people.
You're ready to grab a big,
juicy slice of life, aren't you?
You're preparing yourself for
the world by coming to great
and groovy Stanford and shar
ing a "learning experience" with
all these great and groovy Stan
ford people.
People, that's where it's at for
you. You want to meet people,
talk to people, even love people.
You want to find out what Life
is all about, so here you are.
THE STANFORD UNDER
GRADUATE MALE-FEMALE
RATIO IS 2.8 TO 1.
Now here, perhaps, is what
you can expect to be doing
while you're at Stanford:
Man's Fate
If you are a Stanford man
you may find yourself:
. . . calling up a girl in Janu
ary for a date in March.
. . . not calling up a girl be
cause "that chick's so groovy
she's bound to have a date."
. . . phoning up a face from
the Froshbook.
. . . living in a co-ed dorm
with 28 "sisters" and 64 "broth
ers".
. . . going to Palo Alto High
School dances.
Woman's Lot
If you are a Stanford woman,
you may find yourself:
. . . sitting in the lounge sur
rounded by five guys trying to
outshine each other.

. . . developing a "what can
you do for me" attitude toward
every guy you meet.
. . . dateless on the weekend
because all these guys you meet
think you're so groovy that
you're bound to be dated up.
(Fact: There were Friday nights
last year when 50 per cent of
the girls in Roble Hall stayed
home because they didn't get
asked out.)
. . . having an identity crisis
because the ratio is 3 to 1 and
you're still not getting any
cl cItCS.
So that's how it is at Stan
ford ; the campus may look sexy,
but you can't tell a book by its
cover. The social atmosphere is
depressingly unhealthy for both
men and women. Co-educational
living will help some, but men
from other houses are often re
luctant to ask girls in co-ed
houses for dates.
Why? Why?
Why is the ratio maintained?
Is it because men are going to
be the future businessmen? Or
perhaps because men are going
to be the future scientists?
Maybe it's because Stanford,
as an integral part of the "mon
ey structure" of America, is
just as interested in producing
graduates who will bring in the
money in the form of grants,
endowments, and awards as it
is in producing "well rounded
individuals."
Stanford has the possibility of
becoming a happy social com
munity, but until this ratio
changes, it will be a social aber
ration; a distorted image of the
world it is supposed to be pre
paring you for.
