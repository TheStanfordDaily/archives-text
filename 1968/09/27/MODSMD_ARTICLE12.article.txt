## Housing Protest 
### 
Editor, The DAILY:
The reopening of Stanford
Village for graduate students in
desperate need of housing is a
partial response of the Univer
sity administration and an in
adequate response.
It might be unfair to call
Stanford Village a dump. How
ever, it is old; the furnishings
have all been auctioned off; it is
in need of fumigation for rats
and roaches; the proposed rents
are outrageous for a building
about to be torn down and rents
are higher than in previous
years. In this context the Uni
versity's demand for a year's
lease is ridiculous.
We want a real commitment
from the University now, not
next year or 1971, for immediate
construction of attractive, low
rent housing for graduate stu
dents, junior faculty, and Stan
ford employees.

• Property Rights
Editor, The Daily:
Your campaign for integrated
on-campus housing seems con
trary to the desires of at least
some of the black community,
as reported in your columns re
cently.
What segment of the black
community are you aiming for?
Poor, and not necessarily
black, neighbors may not share
the desire for peace and quiet,
and the atmosphere of contem
plation, sought by many aca
demic-oriented persons. Poor,
and not necessarily black, neigh
bors often make your property
their property at your inconven
ience.

• In Bad Taste
Editor, The Daily:
Last Saturday I witnessed my
first Stanford football game. Al
though I was impressed by the
precision and drive of the In
dian squad and equally unim
pressed by the calibre of San
Jose State, my thoughts on leav
ing the stadium were not cen
tered on football. Rather, they
were concerned with curious be
havior of an individual who ap
parently is the "spokesman"
for the Stanford cheerleading
team.
His behavior, at best, was ob
noxious. Apparently enthralled
by the sound of his own voice,
he insisted on delivering a run
ning commentary of the game
to the Stanford student-body sec
tion. The "cheers" he led — or
tried to lead — were concerned
mostly with deprecating San
Jose State rather than praising
the Cardinal Indians.
He "amused" the fans with a
joke concerning a wheel-chair
victim wearing a T-shirt which
tead "I'm A Winner," while
somehow Ignoring the courage
of a San Jose guard who was
playing with one arm. His men
tal direction was revealed early
when he attempted to lead a
"cheer" consisting of "Bullshit,"
and the-quality of his thought

was reinforced later by his cute
little comment on "inches short."
Overall, he was the embodiment
of poor sportsmanship and bad
taste.
Perhaps your letter policy pro
hibits comments directed toward
an individual. I hope, however,
you can defer in this case,' sine
this particular person, whoever
h • may be, was representing not
only himself but also the cheer
loading team and the University.
It's unfortunate that the repu
tation of both could possibly be
tarnished by what seems to
have been a mistake in the Ad
missions Office.
I hope — as do many of the
fans who sat near me Saturday
that the cheerleaders will re
consider thdr program and
avoid similar exhibitions in the
future.

• Hospital Coverage
Editor, The DAILY:
The $48-a-year hospitalization
insurance premium is a flagrant
example of disregard for the
student. An admittedly sim
plified* calculation shows that
$150,000 paid by the university
last year for hospitalization is
equal to only $15 for each of
our 10,000 students.
If many students have out
side insurance, why not allow
them to use their insurance to
pay their bills and grant the
other students coverage upon
payment of $15 apiece to the
University.

• Objects to Cleaver
Editor, The DAILY:
The editorial regarding El
dridge Cieaver in Monday's
Daily may have missed the
point. It is not Cleaver's view
point that is objected to by his
critics (including Alan Cran
ston) but the man himself.
There are many Negro lead
ers who feel as passionately
about racial injustice as Cleaver
and who could present this
viewpoint equally, if not more
effectively and receptively.
