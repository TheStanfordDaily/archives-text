# The
						peace talk MYTH
## 
### DICK GREGORY 
The rhetoric of this year's presidential campaign
is both frivolous and dangerous, though admittedly
increasingly amusing. When Vice-Presidential hope
ful hopeful Agnew says that Vice-President Hum
phrey is "squishy soft" and the Vice-President in
turn calls former Vice-President Nixon a "wiggler or
wobbler" we must laugh to keep from crying. But we
cannot even smile at the outright misrepresentation
concerning the so-called Paris Peace Talks.
Recently I had occasion to be in Paris and spoke
with three members of the North Vietnamese Truce
Negotiating Team. On Monday, September 10, at
3:15 p.m. Paris time, my wife Lillian and I were cor
dially received at the residence of the representative
of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. I was recog
nized as a write-in Presidential candidate. The prin
cipal delegate, Mr. Nguyen-Minh-Vy, a Deputy of the
National Assembly, his secretary, Mr. Bai and his in
terpreter, Mr. Yoang, spoke with us for two and a
half hours.
Talks a Myth
I must confess my own shock at learning that
there are no peace talks being conducted in Paris.
Like other Americans I have heard the President and
the Republican and Democratic Presidential candi
dates ask us to pray for the success of the Paris
Peace Talks. I was naive enough to think that there
was indeed serious talk about peace.
The truce teams have met formally in some 20
sessions over a three-month period. At no time has a

single step been taken toward initiating negotiations.
The North Vietnamese have flatly stated that no
peace talks will begin until the bombing above the
demilitarized zone is stopped unconditionally.
Our government has been aware of this prerequi
site from the first communication with Hanoi. The
terms for establishing the negotiations in Paris were
a concession by the North Vietnamese predicated
upon that prerequisite. Yet the American govern
ment has refused to fulfill the initial requirement of
unilaterally ceasing the bombing of North Vietnam.
Recently our government has begun to ask for
some reciprocal act of de-escalation in exchange for
a cessation of the bombing. The North Vietnamese
consider this a travesty of the initial ground rules.
They are adamant on this point as their figures show
that the so-called limitation of the bombing has actu
ally meant an increase of air activity over their
nation.
If any American parent with a son in Vietnam has
been heartened over the past three months by the
feeling that our government is at least trying to
bring the war to a close, it is my sad obligation to
relay the information that nothing whatsoever is
being done.
The Vietnamese were occupied in World War II
by the Japanese. After the defeat of Japan, the
Vietnamese declared their independence from France.
Yet the Vietnamese do not hate the French as testi
fied by the fact that the truce teams are meeting in
Paris. To the Vietnamese, the American soldier is

simply a foreigner and an agent of a colonial power
which wishes to control the economy and the re
sources of their land.
Anger, Not Hate
The Vietnamese believe that American people are
opposed to the war. They place the blame for hos
tility on the American government and the military
industrial complex which profits from war itself. I
was told the difficulty of insuring the safety of Amer
ican pilots shot down over North Vietnam. The Ge
neva Convention insists upon insurance of safety for
prisoners of war.
"You must understand," Mr. Vy said to me, "that
when a pilot is captured, he does not fall into the
hands of disciplined soldiers but he is taken by ordi
nary people on whom he has only a moment before
been dropping bombs. The anger of these people is
very great and the only way we have been able to
persuade them not to harm the pilots is because they
know of the many young people in the United States
who risk imprisonment and brutality in order to pro
test against such atrocities."
Our personal conversation convinced me that the
North Vietnamese are genuinely eager to settle the
political problems of Vietnam at the conference table
immediately. They will not relent on the issue of
stopping the bombing. They feel the longer the war
continues the more evident it will be to the American
people that there can be no military solution and
public demand will requi.re our government to finally
negotiate a settlement.
