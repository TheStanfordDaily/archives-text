# Why The Daily's Gone Wild or Noncan Farmity in the life of a mildmannered newspaper
## 
### 
As you may have noticed. The Stanford Daily is not quite as it
used to he. Its name on the front page is set in a different type
than before, and from time to time there is white space and
sketches where there used to be gray space.
All right, you say, hunched quietly over your morning coffee,
but really why this change?
Because this sort of innovation is happening, mainly in maga
zines and underground newspapers and will soon spread to regu
lar papers; but has never really been tried on a full-size paper
like The Daily.
Because it may make people look and read at a time when
communication is crucially important in the University and the
world. That is, they will look and read if we are both clear and
honest.
And because it will be fun.
