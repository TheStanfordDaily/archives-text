# The 						Nebbish Speaks
## Wallace Speaks 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
In Friday's Dally there ap
pears an ad for George Wallace.
You might think that, since
Governor George is a plain,
folksy man, the language is
straightforward. It appears to
be so, but actually the copy is
written in code.
The Daily has managed to ob
tain the code book, and presents
bolow the original and its trans
lation.
Original: IN A CRISIS, it
takes courage to be a leader . . .
courage to speak out ... to
point the way ... to say, "Fol
low Me!" In a crisis, it takes ac
tion to survive . . . the kind of
decisive action that comes from
a man of sound instinct, as well
as intelligence.
Translation: WHEN THE
BLACKS ARE AFTER OUR
BALLS, it's time to stop listen
ing to all those lily-livered nig
ger lovers . . . pick up our guns
. . . point out the traitors . . .
to say, "Kill 'em All!" When the
coons step out of line, it takes
action to stay on top . . the
kind of decisive action that
comes from a man who knows
how to keep niggers in their
place.
Original: If America is to sur
vive this crisis ... if the youth
of America are to inherit a sane
and even promising world, we
must have courageous, con
structive leadership. The kind of
leadership that only George C.
Wallace — of all Presidential
candidates—has to offer. That's
why young Americans who
really think support Wallace.
Translation: If we are going
to stop the pinkos and commies
and anarchists from taking over

... if we are going to prevent
the kids in this country from
subverted and rioting like
those damn Commies in France,
Germany and Mexico, we need
somebody who has enough guts
to throw them all in jail, enough
guts to say he'd run over any
anarchist who lies down in front
of his car. And that means
George C. Wallace — not those
other two phonies—is our man.
That's why young Americans
who haven't been twisted by
those traitors and cowards sup
port Wallace.
it takes courage to stand up for
America against the pseudo-in
tellectual professors, the hip
pies, the press and the en
tire liberal Establishment. And
they've got that courage.
Translation: THEY KNOW it
takes guts not to listen to all
the dupes and fellow travelers
who keep telling them lies about
about the Commies not trying
to take us over. And they've got
those guts.
The rest of the ad merely asks
for the reader to join Youth for
Wallace (read: Junior Ku Klux
Klan).
