# African Specialist Duignan Appointed Hoover Curator
## 
### 
One of the nation's outstand
ing specialists on Africa, Peter
Duignan, has been named to the
first endowed curatorship at
Stanford's Hoover Institution on
War, Revolution, and Peace.
It is the country's first such
position devoted to Africa.
The Stella W. and Ira S. Lil
lick Curatorship was made pos
sible by a bequest to the Institu
tion from Mr. Lillick, an inter
nationally renowned admiralty
lawyer and long-time Stanford
trustee. Lillick, for many years
a close friend of the Institution's
founder, Herbert Hoover, died
in April 1967 at the age of 91.
He lived in Atherton.
Duignan, 42, has been curator
of the African Collection at the
Institution since 1959 and direc
tor of its African studies pro
gram since 1965. From the latter
research have come 15 books
and monographs. Some 20 proj
ects are in progress.
Starts Afro-Ameriean Files
In 1966 Duignan was named
Curator of Africana for the en
tire University, with responsi
bility for maintaining holdings
that now rank among the top
five collections in the country.
Last year, in cooperation with
the Black Students Union and
University staff, he helped begin
the building of a substantial
Afro - American collection at
Stanford.
Announcing Duignan's ap
pointment Tuesday, Dr. W.
Glenn Campbell, director of the
Institution, said:
"Peter Duignan's talent and
energy overflow his multiple re
sponsibilities on this campus.
He is not only a highly produc
tive scholar, bibliographer and
collector of Africana, but also
an acknowledged leader and ed
ucator within his particular dis
cipline and general profession.
"It is fitting that the Institu
tion, and Stanford, should be
among the few centers of higher

learning in this country to have
endowed curatorial positions. In
fact, as far as we know, this is
the first such post devoted to
Africa."
Co-author of "Burden of Em
pire" (1967) with Lewis H.
Gann, Duignan's book is the
first of five scheduled volumes
to result from the Institution's
project on "Colonialism in Af
rica," directed by Duignan and

A member of the American

(1960) from Stanford and was,
for three years during that
time, an instructor in history.
He graduated cum laude from

Gann.
Four Years of Research
Duignan was a Ford Fellow to
Africa, 1957-59, and a Rockefel
ler Foundation Fellow, 1963-64.
He has traveled widely in Africa
to collect materials and perform
research.
A member of the American
Historical Association, he took
his A.M. (1953) and his Ph.D.
(1960) from Stanford and was,
for three years during that
time, an instructor in history.
He graduated cum laude from
the University of San Francisco
in 1951.
One of the nation's outstand
ing specialists on Africa, Peter
Duignan, has been named to the
first endowed curatorship at
Stanford's Hoover Institution on
War, Revolution, and Peace.
It is the country's first such
position devoted to Africa.
The Stella W. and Ira S. Lil
lick Curatorship was made pos
sible by a bequest to the Institu
tion from Mr. Lillick, an inter
nationally renowned admiralty
lawyer and long-time Stanford
trustee. Lillick, for many years
a close friend of the Institution's
founder, Herbert Hoover, died
in April 1967 at the age of 91.
He lived in Atherton.
Duignan, 42, has been curator
of the African Collection at the
Institution since 1959 and direc
tor of its African studies pro
gram since 1965. From the latter
research have come 15 books
and monographs. Some 20 proj
ects are in progress.
Starts Afro-Ameriean Files
In 1966 Duignan was named
Curator of Africana for the en
tire University, with responsi
bility for maintaining holdings
that now rank among the top
five collections in the country.
Last year, in cooperation with
the Black Students Union and
University staff, he helped begin
the building of a substantial
Afro - American collection at
Stanford.
Announcing Duignan's ap
pointment Tuesday, Dr. W.
Glenn Campbell, director of the
Institution, said:
"Peter Duignan's talent and
energy overflow his multiple re
sponsibilities on this campus.
He is not only a highly produc
tive scholar, bibliographer and
collector of Africana, but also
an acknowledged leader and ed
ucator within his particular dis
cipline and general profession.
"It is fitting that the Institu
tion, and Stanford, should be
among the few centers of higher

learning in this country to have
endowed curatorial positions. In
fact, as far as we know, this is
the first such post devoted to
Africa."
Co-author of "Burden of Em
pire" (1967) with Lewis H.
Gann, Duignan's book is the
first of five scheduled volumes
to result from the Institution's
project on "Colonialism in Af
rica," directed by Duignan and
Gann.
