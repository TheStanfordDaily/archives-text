# Oregon Hosts Stanford
## Tribe Kicks Off Pac-8 Grid Season 
### GARY CAVALLI 
Stanford launches the 1968 Pa
-cific-8 football season tomorrow
.Jn Eugene, Oregon, when Coach
John Ralston's men tangle with
4he Oregon Ducks at 1:30.
" The Tribe, listed as seven
-point favorites over Oregon, will
jie out to prove that last week's
•€B-20 bombardment of neighbor
ing San Jose State was no fluke.
The Ducks, who dropped a 28-7
decision to powerful Colorado
Jast Saturday, will be playing
their first game in new Autzen
Stadium and should have no
trouble getting up for the con-
Jest.
"We anticipate a real tough
.game from Oregon," Ralston
commented earlier this week.
."They'll be playing in front of
Jhe home fans in their new sta
dium for the first time, and we
expect them to be on Cloud
Nine."
Sputtering Offense
The Ducks had trouble gen

erating an offense against the
Buffs in Boulder, gaining only
104 yards on the ground and 87
through the air. Tailback Clax
ton Welch and fullback Greg
Marshall combined for all 104
yards rushing, Welch netting 53
and Marshall 51.
Quarterback Alan Pitcaithley
had trouble finding his receivers
against Colorado, connecting on
only 2 of 10 passing attempts for
34 yards. Senior Eric Olsen, who
hit 2 of 5 passes for 53 yards,
may see a lot of action in tomor
row's game.
Defensively, the Ducks could
provide Stanford with some
headaches. Safetyman Steve Hil
bert, middle guard George
Dames, and monster Omri Hil
dreth spearhead a quick, scram
bling defense that Ralston re
gards as "very tough."
Injuries Mount
Oregon may be hampered by
the loss of highly-touted sopho
more end Bob Newland and slot

back Andy Maurer, both of
whom were hurt in the Colorado
encounter.
But Stanford has had its share
of ailments, too, as both place
kicker Bill Shoemaker and de
fensive back Tom Holliday will
be lost for the season with knee
injuries.
Sophomore Steve Horowitz
will handle the kicking chores
in Eugene. He booted three of
five PAT's after taking over for
Shoemaker in the second half of
the San Jose game, hitting three
straight after having his first
two tries blocked.
Brown Doubtful
The Indians may also be with
out tailback Bubba Brown, Stan
ford's leading rusher last Satur
day with 61 yards, who is suf
fering from a sprained ankle. At
this time Brown's status is in
doubt, but it appears he will see
limited or no action tomorrow.
Junior Howie Williams will
most likely open at tailback in

Brown's place. Williams alterna
ted with Brown last Saturday
and picked up 56 yards.
Tomorrow's encounter will be
the 37th meeting between the
two clubs. Stanford currently
holds a 22-13-1 edge over Oregon
in the series. A victory tomor
row would not only give the In
dians a conference win and a
10-game lead in the Oregon se
ries, but it would prove to a
lot of people that last week's
68-20 victory over San Jose
State wasn't a fluke.

LATEST CASUALTY —Halfback Bubba Brown (21) eludes a San
Jose tackier en route to a 20-yard scamper in last Saturday's 68-20
rout. Brown became the latest Indian to make the injury list by
spraining an ankle in practice Monday.
