# Fall Signups Next Week
## IM Sports Offer Variety Daily SPORTS 
### BRUCE HOWARD 
For more than 5000 sometime
athletes at Stanford who crave
touch football, basketball, bowl
ing, volleyball, or any of seven
teen other sports, the Stanford
intramural sports program is
ideally suited.
From the casual volleyball fan
to the red-hot ex-high school
star, the program has wide
spread appeal. For the individ
ual, it can be a pleasant form of
exercise, activity with friends, or
competition, with its thrills and
rewards, on a sub-varsity level.
For the team, it can be intra
mural points, league competi
tion, or maybe a championship.
Fans Stay Home
Yet without the glamor and
spectator interest of the varsity
teams, the intramural program
remains relatively unknown be
yond its participants. Its con
tests take place before subs and
referees and the scores are of
interest only to those involved.
Despite this, the program draws
teams from over ninety living
groups, eating clubs, graduate
student organizations, and off
campus groups.
This fall there will be fifteen
six-team leagues in touch foot
ball. In winter, basketball usual
ly draws twenty or more
leagues. All told, more than
1000 teams in all sports partici
pate in more than 6000 contests.
The Champion Neutrinoes
The competition between resi
dence units is the primary focus
of the IM program. The Neutri
noes, a group of science grad
students, won the overall cham
pionship last year with 442
points to runner-up Theta Delta
Chi's 416. It was the second
straight title for the Neutrinoes.
A second place in spring vol
leyball, worth 60 points, proved
to be the winning margin, al
though it was the Neutrinoes'
overall depth that won for them.
They scored in all but four of
the twenty-one sports. The The
ta Delts had won the softball
championship, worth 100 points,
to make the race close. (The
point values of the various
sports are determined by the
number of competitors in
volved.)
Others among the top finishers
were Kappa Alpha in third with
360 points, followed by El Toro

with 269, and Alpha Biz with
242.
Winners of the various sports
were the Theta Delts in football,
basketball free throws, and soft
ball (they went on to thrash the
Cal SAE's in a post-season
game" between the champions
of the two schools, 25-6, Sigma
Chi in basketball, El Toro in
track and cross-country, Alpha
Biz in golf, KA in water polo
and swimmin, the Neutrinoes in
table tennis, wrestling, and
bowling, and the Anti-Newts in
volleyball.
This Fall
Intramural sports this Fall
will be touch football, bowling,
billiards, golf, tennis doubles,
boxing, 2-man volleyball, cross
country, and basketball free
throws. Meetings of the man
agers of these sports from each
living group are being held this

week and next in room 350 of
the mens gym. Times and dates
for each sport are being an
nounced in OATQ.

This Fall
Intramural sports this Fall
will be touch football, bowling,
billiards, golf, tennis doubles,
boxing, 2-man volleyball, cross
country, and basketball free
throws. Meetings of the man
agers of these sports from each
living group are being held this

week and next in room 350 of
the mens gym. Times and dates
for each sport are being an
nounced in OATQ.

bomb in the opening minutes, to lead the Theta Delts to a smashing 25-6 win over their hapless Cal
opponents.

For more than 5000 sometime
athletes at Stanford who crave
touch football, basketball, bowl
ing, volleyball, or any of seven
teen other sports, the Stanford
intramural sports program is
ideally suited.
From the casual volleyball fan
to the red-hot ex-high school
star, the program has wide
spread appeal. For the individ
ual, it can be a pleasant form of
exercise, activity with friends, or
competition, with its thrills and
rewards, on a sub-varsity level.
For the team, it can be intra
mural points, league competi
tion, or maybe a championship.
Fans Stay Home
Yet without the glamor and
spectator interest of the varsity
teams, the intramural program
remains relatively unknown be
yond its participants. Its con
tests take place before subs and
referees and the scores are of
interest only to those involved.
Despite this, the program draws
teams from over ninety living
groups, eating clubs, graduate
student organizations, and off
campus groups.
This fall there will be fifteen
six-team leagues in touch foot
ball. In winter, basketball usual
ly draws twenty or more
leagues. All told, more than
1000 teams in all sports partici
pate in more than 6000 contests.
The Champion Neutrinoes
The competition between resi
dence units is the primary focus
of the IM program. The Neutri
noes, a group of science grad
students, won the overall cham
pionship last year with 442
points to runner-up Theta Delta
Chi's 416. It was the second
straight title for the Neutrinoes.
A second place in spring vol
leyball, worth 60 points, proved
to be the winning margin, al
though it was the Neutrinoes'
overall depth that won for them.
They scored in all but four of
the twenty-one sports. The The
ta Delts had won the softball
championship, worth 100 points,
to make the race close. (The
point values of the various
sports are determined by the
number of competitors in
volved.)
