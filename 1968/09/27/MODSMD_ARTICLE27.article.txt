### PATRICK McMAHON 
What ever happened to Wally?
He's "away;" all his files, cor
respondence, and records are in
the University archives; and a
spacious office in the Meyer Un
dergraduate Library fourth floor
is about ready for him.
Chancellor Sterling, as he's
called now, will be "away un
til October," according to his
secretary, and then off again "to
England until Christmas." Sterl
ing plans to study and write
about the English system of
higher education.
In the Main Library, under the
care of University archivist
Ralph Hansen, are the "Presi
dential Papers," the records of
all the past presidents of Stan
ford including Sterling.
Hansen said that the archives
division likes to clear out the
President's office of old files
every few years. Shipments of
Sterling's files have been made
several times during Sterling's
term, and"the last of it is now
coming in."
The Sterling papers include
files on departments, associa
tions and societies, prominent
alumni, foundations, and grants
—everything from the American
Council on Education to the
Mausoleum.
According to Hansen, the files
are "closed, except to people
authorized by Sterling's office to
use them." They are stored in
104 brown oblong boxes, and
"the last ten are on their way."
Hansen said that normal Uni
versity policy is that these files
be open "for scholarly research
twenty-five years after the death
of the subject."
Hansen said that the archives
also has motion pictures and
television tapes. He added that
the archives of recorded sound
in the music library has tapes
of Sterling's speeches.
Sterling's new office is located
in the area directly above the
loan desk on the fourth floor
and is still in preparation.
