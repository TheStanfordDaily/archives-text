# AFT Presents Plan For Stanford Village
## 
### 
The student housing crisis
took on new proportions yester
day when graduate student
members of the local American
Federation of Teachers delivered
a series of four demands to the
University.
The union issued a position
paper demanding that:
• No leases or rental agree
ments be required for space in
Stanford Village.
• A resident council have con
trol of operation of the village,
including jurisdiction over re
pairs.
• Rent for furnished apart
ments shall be no higher than
it was last year.
The position paper also ob
jected to the current plan to de
molish Stanford Village and re
place it with an extension of
SRI.
The Union, AFT local 1816 un
der Chairman Andrew Moss, is
an affiliate of the AFL-CIO. It
has been pressing for better
housing since its inception in
September 1967.
Stanford Village, which has
been listed as temporary housing
since the conclusion of World
War 11, is now being fumigated
for rats and is expected to be at
least partially ready this week
end.
Glaser Proposes Committee
The demands came following a
letter received from Acting Pres
ident Robert J. Glaser late Wed

nesday evening. The letter pro
posed the formation of a com
mittee which would look into and
examine such problems as hous
ing and other student grievan
ces which crop up.
The letter was written in re
sponse to a set of five AFT de
mands issued this week. The
points include:
• "Rapid development of
Stanford lands for middle and
upper income housing must
cease. The highest priority for
University land development in
the immediate future must be
low income housing for Stanford
students, employees, and other
local area workers."
• "The university must begin

to exercise its obvious financial
and political leverage with the
City of Palo Alto and Peninsula
developers to ease the housing
crisis in the area.
• The Stanford Master Plan
should be amended to include ra
cially mixed, economically varied
living area.
• The University should be
wPling, if necessary, to obtain
leases through the Fall Quarter
on a sufficient number of motels
in the adjacent area to house
students. It should also provide
students who must live in pri
vately operated motels after
September 23 with rent subsidies
that will make their cost of liv
ing expenditures compatible
with University on campus
rates.
• The university should begin
negotiations immediately with
the AFT and their architects
who have developed plans for
high quality environment, low
rental housing that could be
made operational by January 1.
This housing would not consti
tute another Escondido "ghet
to." Rather, it would be opened
to students, employees, and
workers, and under the control
of those persons who live there.
No Housing For 32%
At present the University pro
vides no housing for 32 percent
of its undergraduates, and 78
percent of its graduate students.
In addition it provides no hous
ing for 96 percent of its non-pro
fessional workers.
According to Palo Alto's senior
planner this past July, the city
provides 45,600 jobs, but has
housing for only about 21,000
workers. Consequently the com
petition for housing in Palo
Alto and neighboring communi
ties has become fierce.
The ultimate result of this has
been that rents have gone up in
price because of the shortage in
housing and graduate students
whose salaries range from $1400-
$6390 often cannot afford to pay
for housing even if they are able
to find an available room.

The AFT planned to hand out
information and seek support
yesterday as students filled out
applications for Stanford Vil
lage.
Various estimates of the num
ber of students without housing
have been made but Moss feels
the estimates may be highly in
accurate.
As Moss stated, one student
who filled out a poll stating he
had satisfactory housing was
living in a bathroom.

to find an available room.

The AFT planned to hand out
information and seek support
yesterday as students filled out
applications for Stanford Vil
lage.
Various estimates of the num
ber of students without housing
have been made but Moss feels
the estimates may be highly in
accurate.
As Moss stated, one student
who filled out a poll stating he
had satisfactory housing was
living in a bathroom.
The student housing crisis
took on new proportions yester
day when graduate student
members of the local American
Federation of Teachers delivered
a series of four demands to the
University.
The union issued a position
paper demanding that:
• No leases or rental agree
ments be required for space in
Stanford Village.
• A resident council have con
trol of operation of the village,
including jurisdiction over re
pairs.
• Rent for furnished apart
ments shall be no higher than
it was last year.
The position paper also ob
jected to the current plan to de
molish Stanford Village and re
place it with an extension of
SRI.
The Union, AFT local 1816 un
der Chairman Andrew Moss, is
an affiliate of the AFL-CIO. It
has been pressing for better
housing since its inception in
September 1967.
Stanford Village, which has
been listed as temporary housing
since the conclusion of World
War 11, is now being fumigated
for rats and is expected to be at
least partially ready this week
end.
Glaser Proposes Committee
The demands came following a
letter received from Acting Pres
ident Robert J. Glaser late Wed

nesday evening. The letter pro
posed the formation of a com
mittee which would look into and
examine such problems as hous
ing and other student grievan
ces which crop up.
The letter was written in re
sponse to a set of five AFT de
mands issued this week. The
points include:
• "Rapid development of
Stanford lands for middle and
upper income housing must
cease. The highest priority for
University land development in
the immediate future must be
low income housing for Stanford
students, employees, and other
local area workers."
• "The university must begin

to exercise its obvious financial
and political leverage with the
City of Palo Alto and Peninsula
developers to ease the housing
crisis in the area.
• The Stanford Master Plan
should be amended to include ra
cially mixed, economically varied
living area.
• The University should be
wPling, if necessary, to obtain
leases through the Fall Quarter
on a sufficient number of motels
in the adjacent area to house
students. It should also provide
students who must live in pri
vately operated motels after
September 23 with rent subsidies
that will make their cost of liv
ing expenditures compatible
with University on campus
rates.
• The university should begin
negotiations immediately with
the AFT and their architects
who have developed plans for
high quality environment, low
rental housing that could be
made operational by January 1.
This housing would not consti
tute another Escondido "ghet
to." Rather, it would be opened
to students, employees, and
workers, and under the control
of those persons who live there.
No Housing For 32%
At present the University pro
vides no housing for 32 percent
of its undergraduates, and 78
percent of its graduate students.
In addition it provides no hous
ing for 96 percent of its non-pro
fessional workers.
According to Palo Alto's senior
planner this past July, the city
provides 45,600 jobs, but has
housing for only about 21,000
workers. Consequently the com
petition for housing in Palo
Alto and neighboring communi
ties has become fierce.
The ultimate result of this has
been that rents have gone up in
price because of the shortage in
housing and graduate students
whose salaries range from $1400-
$6390 often cannot afford to pay
for housing even if they are able
to find an available room.
