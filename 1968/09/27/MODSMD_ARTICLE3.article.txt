# AFT Presents Plan For Stanford Village
## 
### 
The student housing crisis
took on new proportions yester
day when graduate student
members of the local American
Federation of Teachers delivered
a series of four demands to the
University.
The union issued a position
paper demanding that:
• No leases or rental agree
ments be required for space in
Stanford Village.
• A resident council have con
trol of operation of the village,
including jurisdiction over re
pairs.
• Rent for furnished apart
ments shall be no higher than
it was last year.
The position paper also ob
jected to the current plan to de
molish Stanford Village and re
place it with an extension of
SRI.
The Union, AFT local 1816 un
der Chairman Andrew Moss, is
an affiliate of the AFL-CIO. It
has been pressing for better
housing since its inception in
September 1967.
Stanford Village, which has
been listed as temporary housing
since the conclusion of World
War 11, is now being fumigated
for rats and is expected to be at
least partially ready this week
end.
Glaser Proposes Committee
The demands came following a
letter received from Acting Pres
ident Robert J. Glaser late Wed

nesday evening. The letter pro
posed the formation of a com
mittee which would look into and
examine such problems as hous
ing and other student grievan
ces which crop up.
The letter was written in re
sponse to a set of five AFT de
mands issued this week. The
points include:
• "Rapid development of
Stanford lands for middle and
upper income housing must
cease. The highest priority for
University land development in
the immediate future must be
low income housing for Stanford
students, employees, and other
local area workers."
• "The university must begin

to exercise its obvious financial
and political leverage with the
City of Palo Alto and Peninsula
developers to ease the housing
crisis in the area.
• The Stanford Master Plan
should be amended to include ra
cially mixed, economically varied
living area.
• The University should be
wPling, if necessary, to obtain
leases through the Fall Quarter
on a sufficient number of motels
in the adjacent area to house
students. It should also provide
students who must live in pri
vately operated motels after
September 23 with rent subsidies
that will make their cost of liv
ing expenditures compatible
