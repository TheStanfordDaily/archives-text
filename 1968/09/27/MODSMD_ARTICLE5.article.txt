# Pitzer Referendum Off
## Hayes Won't Ask For Vote 
### BARBARA RITZ 
Student body president Denis
Hayes says he has no immedi
ate plans for sponsoring a ref
erendum on the selection of
President Pitzer. In an inter
view Tuesday, Hayes touched on
the role of students in the selec

tion of university presidents.
Hayes's disclosure is a shift
from his earlier position. In Au
gust, after the announcement of
the Trustees' choice, he ex
pressed disappointment that
Stanford students were not con
sulted in the selection process.

At that time he mentioned a
referendum in which students
would vote on the appointment.
Students' Opinions Ignored
During a Daily interview
Hayes clarified his feelings.
"The duties of a college presi
dent are always largely depend
ent upon the age in which he
lives," Hayes said. "We would
be kidding ourselves if we tried
to deny that a primary consid
eration of any university presi
dent in the next several years
is going to be his relationship
to the student body.
"I should think that any can
didate who really knows what's
happening today would want to
have had students on the search
committee which nominated
him."
Hayes explained that during
the summer a committee of
seven students, including him
self, conducted research on pos
sible candidates. He said that
the committee's work, docu
menting student perspective and
contacting student newspaper
editors and student governmen
tal officials, was intended to pro
vide a source of aid for the
Stanford trustees if they re
quested it.
At that time Hayes expressed
a desire for students to be in
corporated into the faculty
search committee on the same
basis as the faculty. Hayes,
however, observed that students
were not included in the final
selection process.
"Across this nation and
throughout the world there has
risen a new important collegiate
group," Hayes said. "An articu
late generation of young men
and women is finding itself in

opposition to many aspects of
the status quo, and is trying,
where possible, to effect change
in a responsible, constructive
manner.
"Last spring's ASSU elections
were characterized in the popu
lar media as a joke. But it was
a serious affair to those who
knew what was going on.
"Miss Drake said quite forth
rightly that students don't count
for a tinker's damn at Stanford,
and that to try to work for their
institutional absorption into the
governing processes was to live
a pipe dream. She vowed to de
stroy the Associated Students
and to remedy student griev
ance through extralegal mani
f stations of student power."
Last Year's ASSU Election
According to Hayes there
were many reasons people voted
for Vicki last spring, and some
of the reasons contradict one
another.
"But the more than two thou
sand people who chose to vote
for a topless dancer for ASSU
president all shared at least
one bslief," he said. "Student
participation doesn't amount to
a tinker's damn at Stanford."
"The 3500 students who cast
their ballots for me, I believe,
were trying to demonstrate a
hope," Hayns said. "I made it
clear throughout my campaign
that I favored an enormous in
crease in student participation
in university governance. And I
made it a cornerstone of my
campaign a promise that I
would do everything in my pow
er to see students incorporated
as full and equal members of
the faculty committee on presi
dential selection."
