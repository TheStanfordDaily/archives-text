# Hayes, Students Join Faculty In ROTC Credit Reappraisal
## 
### 
Faculty representatives have
started a reappraisal of the RO
TC programs at Stanford after
a suggestion by ten faculty
members that academic credit
for those courses be abolished.
The Academic Senate opened
their meetings to Student Body
President Denis Hayes on an in
terim, ex-ofFieio basis. Both ac
tions were taken without dis
sent.
The Senate of the Academic
Council also approved recom
mendations from its Committee
on Committees for five faculty
members requested by Acting
President Robert Glaser. The
group will provide advice and
counsel in "handling situations
where disruption of University
activities is threatened."
In a resolution creating an ad
hoc committee on ROTC, the
faculty representatives said: "It
is the sense of the Senate that
ROTC programs should be al
tered, but that proper relations
between the ROTC departments
and Stanford may be established

by review and reform of pres
ent relations."
Still to be appointed, the com
mittee was instructed to report
its recommendations by Jan. 15,
1969. Its direction will be dis
cussed further by the Senate in
the near future.
The resolution was adopted
after Senate members heard re
ports and comments from sev
eral of their colleagues, includ
ing those in ROTC departments,
and listened to Hayes and a
panel of four students, chosen
by him and appearing at the
Senate's invitation.
The students were Tom Car
rato, Michael Kuhl, Mark Ed
wards, and Tom Grissom.
Earlier, in a resolution devel
oped last week while meeting as
a committee of the whole, the
Senate declared unanimously
"that knowledge of student atti
tudes and desires is of impor
tance to the deliberations of the
Senate and that mechanisms for
obtaining this knowledge should
be actively considered."
"It is also our sense that

there should be a mechanism of
petition by which members of
the University community can
bring problems to the attention
of the Senate."
It created an ad hoc commit
tee "to consider immediately
how additional student opinion
can be brought to the Senate,"
to recommend how the petition
process can be made most effec
tive, and to consider problems
of University governmnet, giv
ing top priority to relations be
tween faculty and student gov
ernments.
It proposed that Senate agen
da include discussion items "for
the good of the University" by
those petitioning the Steering
Committee for this purpose.
Those appointed in response
to President Glaser's request
were Profs. William Clebsch,
religion and humanities: Jona
than Freedman, psychology;
Gerald Gunther, law; Arthur
Romberg, biochemistry; and
William Rarnbo, electrical engi
neering.

can be brought to the Senate,"
to recommend how the petition
process can be made most effec
tive, and to consider problems
of University governmnet, giv
ing top priority to relations be
tween faculty and student gov
ernments.
It proposed that Senate agen
da include discussion items "for
the good of the University" by
those petitioning the Steering
Committee for this purpose.
Those appointed in response
to President Glaser's request
were Profs. William Clebsch,
religion and humanities: Jona
than Freedman, psychology;
Gerald Gunther, law; Arthur
Romberg, biochemistry; and
William Rarnbo, electrical engi
neering.
Faculty representatives have
started a reappraisal of the RO
TC programs at Stanford after
a suggestion by ten faculty
members that academic credit
for those courses be abolished.
The Academic Senate opened
their meetings to Student Body
President Denis Hayes on an in
terim, ex-ofFieio basis. Both ac
tions were taken without dis
sent.
The Senate of the Academic
Council also approved recom
mendations from its Committee
on Committees for five faculty
members requested by Acting
President Robert Glaser. The
group will provide advice and
counsel in "handling situations
where disruption of University
activities is threatened."
In a resolution creating an ad
hoc committee on ROTC, the
faculty representatives said: "It
is the sense of the Senate that
ROTC programs should be al
tered, but that proper relations
between the ROTC departments
and Stanford may be established

by review and reform of pres
ent relations."
Still to be appointed, the com
mittee was instructed to report
its recommendations by Jan. 15,
1969. Its direction will be dis
cussed further by the Senate in
the near future.
The resolution was adopted
after Senate members heard re
ports and comments from sev
eral of their colleagues, includ
ing those in ROTC departments,
and listened to Hayes and a
panel of four students, chosen
by him and appearing at the
Senate's invitation.
The students were Tom Car
rato, Michael Kuhl, Mark Ed
wards, and Tom Grissom.
Earlier, in a resolution devel
oped last week while meeting as
a committee of the whole, the
Senate declared unanimously
"that knowledge of student atti
tudes and desires is of impor
tance to the deliberations of the
Senate and that mechanisms for
obtaining this knowledge should
be actively considered."
"It is also our sense that

there should be a mechanism of
petition by which members of
the University community can
bring problems to the attention
of the Senate."
It created an ad hoc commit
tee "to consider immediately
how additional student opinion
can be brought to the Senate,"
to recommend how the petition
process can be made most effec
tive, and to consider problems
of University governmnet, giv
ing top priority to relations be
tween faculty and student gov
ernments.
