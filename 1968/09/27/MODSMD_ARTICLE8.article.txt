# SDS Rally Plans Humphrey Action
## 
### 
At yesterday's noon rally in
White Plaza, Stanford SDS
members encouraged students
to "greet" Vice-President Hu
bert H. Humphrey when he ar
rived in San Francisco that
night.
According to one SDS speak
er, Fred Cohen, the grup's sup
porters would protest any of the
major candidates for President
who came to the Bay Area.
"We're protesting more than
Hubert Humphrey," said Cohen.
"By opposing Humphrey, the
electoral system, and the Viet
nam War, we're casting a vote
for peace in Vietnam."
Addressing about 100 people
at the rally, the SDS committee
sketched Humphrey's record
within the Democratic party as
one filled with "manipulation
and deception."

Humphrey's reaction to the
police brutality in Chicago was
an example of the "power poli
tics" that exists in America, ac
cording to the SDS speakers.
"Humphrey praised the Chi
cago police for cracking down
on 'our' use of violence."
The speakers said that people
should not be intimidated by
these tactics, that the powers
belong in the hands of the peo
ple. They urged listeners to go
to San Francisco in order to
show Humphrey that "we're in
this for keeps."
"We're going to put our bod
ies on the line and not our
mouths."
After a short briefing session
at 5:00 p.m. nearly 50 persons
left for San Francisco with the
SDS committee at 5:45 p.m. yes
terday.
