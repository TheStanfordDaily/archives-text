# LOVE, Haight

### TIM HAIGHT 
Good God, the way some peo
ple talk, you'd think old Stan
ford was going to blow up to
morrow. People are positively
up tight. Everybody sees the
second coming, with Stanford as
Bethlehem and Bruce Franklin
or Steve Weissman as the rough
beast, his hour come round at
last, slouching across White
Plaza with a Molotov cocktail.
The hysteria is typically liberal,
academic, and utterly puerile.
First of all, what do people
mean when they say the Univer
sity could be "destroyed"? Cer
tainly, they do not envision a
smoking crater that once was
Stanford. They probably mean
something like "Columbia,"
whatever really happened there.
(Columbia has become "Colum
bia" and Chicago has become
"Chicago," like "Munich,"
"Watts," and "Waterloo").
Destruction probably means
student interference with "Uni
versity functions," leading to—
what? Withdrawal of gifts from
conservative donors? The gov
ernment's declaring the area
"unstable" as it does with un
derdeveloped countries — effec
tively cutting off American in
vestment? The interruption of
research and teaching?
Probably not the latter, unless
a very large number of students
struck or unless much property
damage or moral pressure kept
scholars from their laboratories.
Simply some noise from the ad
ministration buildings wouldn't
do it. We're conditioned to that
from all the construction.

What are we talking about,
then? Most likely, just a dis
turbance of the usual lines of
authority and a threat to the
legitimizing myths of academia.
But this is plenty to start every
good liberal's hands shaking and
cause the faculty club to resem
ble a large, undisciplined flea
circus.
What we are probably talking
about is psychological guerrilla
warfare. The ironic thing is that
the local radicals don't have to
do anything. Everybody is so
nervous already.
Rhubarb, Rhubarb
A story in Punch once de
scribed a similar situation in
wartime Britain. After rumors
of disaffection had spread, the
enlisted men just congregated in
the mess lines and on the drill
field and mumbled "Rhubarb,
rhubarb, rhubarb." Of course,
they stopped dead silent when
ever an officer passed near.
In less than a week, after be
ing totallv unable to locate the
"enemy," the officers started
changing everything about the
camp their wildest dreams said
the men could dislike. No de
mands were ever submitted.
In this country this would
never happen, of course, some
martinet would flip out, think
ing himself Matt Dillon, and
have everybody shot. Thus
George Wallace.
But however a culture reacts,
the stimulus is effective. At
Stanford, uptight administrators
and out-of-it student "leaders"
like Denis Hayes may well de
stroy the University in their

half-assed attempts to save it.
Denis made some dire prophe
cies. Where he got his informa
tion, God only knows. The sad
thing is that such prophecies
can become self-fulfilling. Che
khov once wrote, "If in the first
act you hang a pistol on the
wall, by the third act you must
use it." For "act," substitute
"quarter."
First of all, this apocalyptic
talk comes close to Red-baiting.
I have to spend all my time de
nying that I have had inter
course (political) with Mark
Rudd. Second, it is thrilling, so
that any real radical progress is
a come-down. Finally, it is bliss
fully free of any analysis of
what is going on.
Scholars Challenged
It is the most ironic of trage
dies that just when real intel
lectual analysis is needed pro
fessors are getting emotional.
Of course I would be upset, too,
if I was caught with my guard
down by events that made my
specialized knowledge seem ir
relevant. But professors are just
going to have to rise to the oc
casion.
They are going to have to
postpone rats and mazes and
debate serious intellectual ques
tions like: Is the United States
imperialistic? Does a power
elite run the country? Is it the
role of a university to do re
search on how to kill? Does
capitalism imply overseas ex
pansion and protracted "war
time" budgets? These are some
questions radicals are asking,
and while they cannot be an
swered easily and are controver
sial, they cannot be set aside.
People are dying over them
each minute.
If these questions are simply
dementia of a political minority,
show us why. If they are par
tially true, separate out the
falsehood. But do not dismiss
them as irrelevant when stu
dents take your course for a
grade and read those radical
books for free.
If liberalism can be defended
intellectually, defend it. But do
not be a Ptolemy and let the
inquisition do your arguing for
you. Get out of the formalities
of course and paper and into the
meetings of the activists.
Whether or not confrontations
come is not the issue. They will.
But rather than magnify them
or titillate yourself with imag
ined violence, analyze. Norman
Mailer may say, "There's a shit
storm coming." He's an artist.
We are realists. Let's get down
to issues.
