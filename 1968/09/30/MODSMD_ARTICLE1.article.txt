# Police, Too
## A 						Sunday Be-In 
### BARBARA RITZ 
It was real. That was the
judgment of the more than 5000
people who attended the BE-IN
at El Camino Park yesterday af
ternoon.
Parents held tightly onto their
children. Long-haired people gy
rated by themselves to guitar
sound, and most everyone else
spent the afternoon sitting or ly
ing on the grass.
Even the Palo Alto police came
to listen, but spent most of their
time solving traffic problems.
Sponsored by Free U
Sunday's program was the fifth
of a series sponsored by the Mid
peninsula Free University. The
Free U members distributed cat
alogues and held registration in
the park for the opening of
classes this week.
Before noon the BE-IN com
mittee set up loudspeakers and
erected a platform to accommo

date rock groups such as the
Freedom Highway, Phoenix,
Steve Miller Blues Band, Cold
Blood, and the Frumius Bander
snatch. Nobody seemed too
anxious for program to start.
People walked in streams from
their seats on the grass to the
refreshment areas and waited in
line for something, anything, to
eat. Most of it, including over
half a ton of freshly baked
bread, was free.
A speaker explained that the
bread was baked with a little
help from the Hell's Angels. The
MFU made a special trip to Ne
vada in order to bake the bread,
and the Hell's Angels came
along to help.
City Withholds Permission
The speaker added that the
BE-IN was taking place on a
grassy park area that the Free
University was not given per
mission to use. The City of Palo

Alto denied the MFU ancess to
th a nark. However, members of
the BE-IN committee attempted
to appeal the ruling in federal
court.
People arriving in the after
noon created a parking problem.
After most of the places in the
Stanford shopping plaza were
filled, latecomers had to find
their own spots.
The Palo Alto Police force ar
rived on the scene about ■ four
o'clock, but remained on the
perimeter of the area. One of
the program's speakers com
mented, that the police wouldn't
arrest anyone for blowing grass
because they're afraid of starl
ing something. The speaker de
scribed the resulting freedom
from police action as "communi
ty power."
Throughout the entire after
noon, people sat, stood, walked,
and generally entertained them
selves while the music blared.
