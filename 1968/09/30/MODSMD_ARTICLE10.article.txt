## Back To Apathy? 
### 
-dltor The Daily:
Reg week is over—booking,
rhing, dating, and bull ses
ions begin again.
Do you get depressed or nau
seous or angry when you look
around at the smiling faces and
inane chatter around campus?
And realize that not much has
changed? Once again thousands
will sink back in their plush
lounge chairs on cliche cush
ions, set to ward off reality for
another academic year.
Oh, intellectual debate of The
War is 0.k., but all the news and
stuff soon gets boring—why
bother? And an ideological war
continues to relentlessly pulp
Vietnam. Newsprint, or even
television, doesn't really convey
the sounds of bombs ripping
apart your home and family;
they don't give the smells of
burning flesh or rotting ba
bies. . . .
Don't settle in this rut again
in 1968; the world can't afford
it.
Don't take the route of apathy
and inaction; think about what
is happening day after day after
day to warm, breathing human
beings. You accept the comforts
and pleasures of Stanford and
America, so your conscience is
on the line; make a decision.
But for god's sake, DO SOME
THING!

• Cleaver Visit
Editor, The Daily:
I am pro id of Stanford for
allowing Eldridge Cleaver to
speak on campus. Perhaps if we
had had this typo of dialogue
when I was a student, we would
be closer to understanding and
coming to terms with the social
■•evolution of today.
I am sur' you will hear cries
of outre ge from the white, up
"er-mi''die-class alumni, who, as
students, dominated Stanford
wh n I was there. I know what
i'n talking about, as I am a
white, upper-middle-c'ass alum
nus myself.

• Pre-Reg Dissent
Editor, The Daily:
When I applied for admission
to Stanford I had hopes of be
coming part of a dynamic, com
petitive, and spirited family of
students, administrators and fac
rlty. The members of the Pre
fregistration Commission have
(reinforced my hopes for the
next two years by responsibly

"is; layinrr what Stanford -tr
.Vnts nn and should b> expect
••d to do for each other. T am
ure that the 1400 freshmen and
300 transfer students are par
ticularly grateful to Phillip
Tanbman and Alice Russe'l for
the professional manner in
which they directed the Com
mission's activities.
Unfortunately, the Pre-Reg
speakers did not orient us to
the University so that we might
gain from their experience in
dr t. rmining which of our talents
,- o should seek to employ to
either fortify the attributes of
the institution we applied to, or
modify it to fit our needs and
style. Instead, we were indoctri
nated and regimented.
We were told that in order to
be accepted ts full academic
>nrtners we must be, and re
.in u:s >ect of every conven
tion, but readily accept the real
status quo of ehanging for the
sa- e of change. We were told
that there was a potential for
th? likelihood of campus dis
orders that would xceed the
i.-r.rnit'irle of those at Colombia.
W re we told this, and by those
in positions of trust and respon
sibility, so that we would passiv
ely disorder n .s being the
order of the day, or perhaps it
was said to incite us to become
a part of such a 1 arning situa
tion?
Concluding the Pre-Reg pro
gram was the Matriculation Sun
rl y Service at th Chapel. Pos
;ib y a more beautiful and sensi
tive service has yet to be per
formed, than that service. D an
Napier delivered a most creativ
sermon, tastefully using folk
music to bring his points home.
But in an atmosphere so divine
as to make a healthy belch
sound sacred, the Dean endorsed
and cond- mned specific political
f:g res.
If the spea'ers of whom I
write were effective in their ef
forts, then we neophytes not
only have been shoved into a
mold of negativism and repulsion
for the "post card" Stanford
that we sought to become a part
of, but we also have a presi
dential candidate.
The entrenched establishment
has taught us what philosophical
posture will be most comfortable
to assume. Now the question is:
Will the incoming students dare
to consider the possibility that
they have been snowed, or will
they be blindly comfortable in
a new found conformity?
