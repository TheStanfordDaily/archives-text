## Belle de Jour 
### TODD McCARTHY 
An issue which has long plagued the film importer is whether to
sub-title or dub foreign language films for exhibition in the United
States. Dubbing is frowned upon because of the synchronization
problem and because of the disconcerting knowledge that the
voices heard are not those of the actual actors.
But in the case of Belle de Jour, the use of subtitles has prevent
ed anyone in the English-speaking world from being confronted
with the great mysteries inherent in the work.
Belle de Jour deals with the experiences of a young wife who
decides to work afternoons as a prostitute. Director Luis Bunuel
has intermingled surrealistic occurrences with normal events, a
structure designed to strand the viewer between reality and illu
sion.
The English subtitles, however, give it all away. In the "real"
sequences, the subtitles are in normal print; during the fantasy
sections, the letters are italicized. This destroys the effect Bunuel
was striving for: reality and fantasy are no longer indistinguish
able.
Bunuel shot his hallucinatory scenes in exactly the same style as
the rest of the film. No special effects, colored filters or eerie music
is used. Even with the English subtitles, it is impossible to know
until a good 20 minutes of the film has passed that some of the
action is imaginary.
Many directors who have undertaken similar assignments have
been outlandish, exotic or sensational in their approaches. Bunuel
is totally calm and controlled, never indulging in cinematic tricks
(except one double-exposed shot) and not treating his material as if
it were anything out of the ordinary.
He tells his story simply and directly, but adds extra meaning and
dimension to his film through subtle use of structure and camera.
