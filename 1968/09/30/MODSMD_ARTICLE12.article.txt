# Labor Pains
## TA's Are Workers Too 
### ANDREW MOSS 
If you are a graduate student
and have just arrived here, you
may have begun to notice little
cracks in the smooth fabric of
life at Stanford. You may not
have a place to live.
You may be paying a pheno
menal rent for a rathole in Palo
Alto. You do not have any hos
pitalization insurance and doc
tors are pretty expensive in this
geriatric paradise. You may be
trying to support a wife and kids
on $255 a month.
Meanwhile you are quite like
ly struggling with a department
that thinks students should be
seen and not heard. It may be ap
parent that you are required to
feed yourself in at one end of
the process, listen to the aca
demic gears grind for a while
and get excreted in four years
with a Ph.D.
But for quite a few of us work
ing graduate students it just
isn't so at all. We got sick of it
and we set up the A.F.T.,
Stanford graduate students'
union.
We are working at a university
that totally neglects the inter
ests of working graduates and
other students. The university re
gards students as people to be
acted on, elements in somebody
else's master plan.
This affects all students but
it annoys us particularly because
we do a lot of the teaching on

the campus and a lot of the re
search work. We want to decide
not only about our own lives
but also about how the place is
run, where the resources go,
what the working principles are.
Part of this comes down to
getting more pay and better
housing and adequate health in
surance for ourselves. Part of it
is having some control over aca
demic decisions. But it goes deep
er than that. We are fighting to
make the university a participa
tory social process. We don't
want to hear that we're sup
posed to be apprentices. We do

not choose to be apprentices.
We choose to participate. We
want to make rules as well as
break them.
We set ourselves up as a union
because our problem is the prob
lem that unions grew up to at
tack â€” the problem of gaining
control of your own life.
From that point of view
a student is not much different
from being a wor'-er in Hewlett-
Packard or Varian. Whatever
you are bing trained for, part
of your training is in infantili
sation. You must 1 arn to ac
cept your role as one who is act
ed on, one whose decisions are
made by those who own the pro
duction process or control the
bureaucracy.
If you not ike being in that
position, join us. Fight it.
