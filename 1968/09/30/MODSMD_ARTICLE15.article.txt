In last week's registration rush, students had
another check to write. Hospitalization is no
longer provided by the University. Instead, stu
dents can purchase a policy for $48 per year to
give coverage, most of which was formerly in
cluded in tuition. We think the move to cut out
tuition-covered hospitalization needs to be re
considered.
Dropping hospitalization hits hardest those
students who can least afford the added expense
—graduate students, foreign students, and mi
nority students. It would not be so bad if the ad
ministration had discussed the move openly be
fore its implementation. As it was, the elimina
tion of hospitalization was announced after
school ended last spring.
Furthermore, the policy offered by the Con
tinental Casualty Company through the Univer
sity is too costly, both in terms of students' earn
ing power and coverage provided. Last year hos
pitalization cost the University $150,000 for all

students. This year the University estimates
some 4000 students will buy the hospitalization
policy at a cost of about $120,000.
But, based on last year's figures, these students
can be expected to incur $60,000 in hospitaliza
tion expenses. This means that some $60,000 will
be lost to the administrative machinations of a
private insurance company.
The University has cited "pressure on the
budget" as the reason for cutbacks on "low prior
ity" items. The entire University community
should be informed, in advance, of what the
priorities for the year are, so that interested stu
dents and others can provide a fresh perspective,
We propose that the administration organize
j series of open hearings on the hospitalization
question so that the Stanford Community may
nnrticipate intelligently and constructively in
discussions on this question.
