### BILL LELAND ALAN STRAIN 
EDITOR'S NOTE: Bill Leland
and Alan Strain are both coun
selors in the Special Services sec
tion of the Office of the Dean of
Students, Room 324, Old Union.

Today's column is a preface
to the weekly series which will
follow. As a result of the dearth
of reliable information and the
wealth of rumors, many regi
strants are confused by the op
eration of the Selective Service
System. Information and coun
seling are available to individuals
with initiative. Although draft
problems may be frequent and
numerous, they shou'd not be
assumed to be unsolvable.
The Military Selective Service
Act of 1967 places upon the regi
strant the responsibility to be
informed and to take the initia
tive with respect to particular
classifications. "Each classified
registrant . . . shall within 10
days after it occurs, report to
the local board in writing any
fact that might result in the
registrant being placed in a dif
ferent classification...Rl62s.l
(b).
The registrant is assumed to
be 1-A unless he presents suffi
cient information to indicate that
he qualifies for another classifi
cation. In most cases, he must
also request a specific classifi
cation based upon that informa
tion.
The following procedures are
suggested to insure that the regi
strant does not forfeit his rights
or jeopardize his position.
More appeals and hearings are
forfeited because of delays in
forwarding or opening mail than
for any other reason. The regi
strant is advised to:
(1) meet all deadlines with re
spect to completion of forms and
providing of information,
(2) send all communications
to the SSS in writing,
(3) send all mail by Certified
Mail, Return Receipt Requested,
(4) inform the local board of
any change of address (it is the
registrant's responsibility to see
that he receives mail from the
SSS),
(5) k ep copies of all commu

nications sent to the local board,
and
(6) when in doubt about pro
cedures, check with a competent
counselor.
It should be noted that there
are three classifications which
mean "availab'e for active duty":
I-A, I-A-O, and I-O. I-A, of
course, means "available for
military duty." I-A-O is the clas
sification for conscientious ob
jectors who are available for
non-combat military duty only.
I-O is the classification given
conscientious objectors who are
available for civilian work in lieu
of military duty. All other clas
«Tifications are exemptions or
t mporary deferments from one
of these basic classifications.
In the next five or six weeks,
we will deal in some detail with
student deferment; Form 150,
the new Special Form for Con
scientious Objectors; and the
unique problems of first- and
second-year graduate students.

(6) when in doubt about pro
cedures, check with a competent
counselor.
It should be noted that there
are three classifications which
mean "availab'e for active duty":
I-A, I-A-O, and I-O. I-A, of
course, means "available for
military duty." I-A-O is the clas
sification for conscientious ob
jectors who are available for
non-combat military duty only.
I-O is the classification given
conscientious objectors who are
available for civilian work in lieu
of military duty. All other clas
«Tifications are exemptions or
t mporary deferments from one
of these basic classifications.
In the next five or six weeks,
we will deal in some detail with
student deferment; Form 150,
the new Special Form for Con
scientious Objectors; and the
unique problems of first- and
second-year graduate students.

Today's column is a preface
to the weekly series which will
follow. As a result of the dearth
of reliable information and the
wealth of rumors, many regi
strants are confused by the op
eration of the Selective Service
System. Information and coun
seling are available to individuals
with initiative. Although draft
problems may be frequent and
numerous, they shou'd not be
assumed to be unsolvable.
The Military Selective Service
Act of 1967 places upon the regi
strant the responsibility to be
informed and to take the initia
tive with respect to particular
classifications. "Each classified
registrant . . . shall within 10
days after it occurs, report to
the local board in writing any
fact that might result in the
registrant being placed in a dif
ferent classification...Rl62s.l
(b).
The registrant is assumed to
be 1-A unless he presents suffi
cient information to indicate that
he qualifies for another classifi
cation. In most cases, he must
also request a specific classifi
cation based upon that informa
tion.
The following procedures are
suggested to insure that the regi
strant does not forfeit his rights
or jeopardize his position.
More appeals and hearings are
forfeited because of delays in
forwarding or opening mail than
for any other reason. The regi
strant is advised to:
(1) meet all deadlines with re
spect to completion of forms and
providing of information,
(2) send all communications
to the SSS in writing,
(3) send all mail by Certified
Mail, Return Receipt Requested,
(4) inform the local board of
any change of address (it is the
registrant's responsibility to see
that he receives mail from the
SSS),
(5) k ep copies of all commu

nications sent to the local board,
and
(6) when in doubt about pro
cedures, check with a competent
counselor.
