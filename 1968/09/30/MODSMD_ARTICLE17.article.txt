# Plunkett The Difference In 28-12 Win
## Indians Pluck Bumbling Ducks 
### ART SNYDER 
Stanford didn't score 68 points
Saturday afternoon, but the In
dians stifled a determined Uni
versity of Oregon team 28-12
for their second straight victory
of the young 1968 football cam
paign.
Not since 1962 has the Tribe
opened with two wins in a row.
And it was a tough win, since
the Ducks badly wanted to win
their debut in new Autzen Sta
dium before an enthusiastic
home-town crowd of 25,000.
The victory was a satisfying
one for Stanford, since Coach
John Ralston's men were eager
to prove that last Saturday's 68-
20 annihilation of San Jose
State wasn't an accident.
The Duck's downfall came
mostly from costly mistakes —
in terms of penalties, intercep
tions, and fumbles—and through
the scrambling efforts of Stan
ford's sophomore quarterback
Jim Plunkett, who consistently
flustered the Ducks with his
passing and running.
Plunkett Unloads 3 TD's
Plunkett completed 14 passes
for 227 yards and 3 touchdowns.
For the second week in a row
Jim was voted the "Back of the
Game," and his total statistics
for two games are just short of
amazing — 24 completed passes
in 39 attempts (.610 percentage),
504 yards gained passing, 7
touchdowns passing and 2 rush
ing, and 519 yards in total of
fense.
But Plunkett wasn't the only
weapon in Stanford's artillery.
The offensive line, led by Phil
Messer, Pete Seymour, Co-cap
tain Malcolm Snider, Phil Roin
hard, George Crooks, and sopho
more center John Sande, provid
ed great protection for Plunkett
and some crisp blocking for run
ning backs Greg Broughton and
Howie Williams.
Bob Moore, Stanford's tough

tight end, had a field day in pass
receptions. Bob caught 5 passes
for 86 yards and one touchdown.
Gene Washington, the Indian's
All-Coast flanker and possible
Ail-American candidate, was
double-covered all afternoon, but
still caught 6 passes for 77
yards and one touchdown.
To demonstrate Gene's tre
mendous ability one should re
call a play that came late in the
fourth quarter. Quarterback Don
Bunce tossed a 35 yard pass that
Gene came back toward scrim
mage to catch, despite being sur
rounded by three Oregon de
fenders. Washington now has 11
pass receptions for 247 yards
and 4 TD's.
Rounding out the receiving
corps was Jack Lasater who im
proved as the game continued,
and caught a 23 yard TD pass on
the opening drive of the second
halt
Defense Stifles Duck Momentum
Balancing frustrated Stanford
drives, the defense was led by
linebacker Don Parish, who was
also voted "Lineman of the
Game" for the second week in a
row. Don also led the defensive
stats with 16 tackles, seven of
which were unassisted.
But, like Plunkett, Parish was
by no means the whole show.
Dennis Moore, who is taking
over the roving linebacker posi
tion for injured Bill Shoemaker,
intercepted a pass to stop one
Oregon drive and knocked down
a pass to stop another.
Dick Oliver tallied 10 tackles,
recovered two key fumbles, and
broke up an Oregon two-point
conversion that could have help
ed the Web foots regain imeptus
in the fourth quarter.
Overall, the defense stopped
Oregon eleven different times,
through the efforts of Tom
Weingartner, Pat Preston, Bill
Nicholson, Stu Kellner, and Tom
Massey.


CLUTCH GRAB — Tight end Bob Moore (86) gets away from his man and hards in a Jim Plunkett
aerial on the Stanford 30. The reception was one of five by Moore, who snared a 18-yard TD oass
to get the Indians on the scoreboard late in the first quarter. With flanker Gene Washington get
ting double-teamed throughout most of the game, Moore became the prime receiver for Plunkett,
netting 86 yards for his day's work.

double-covered all afternoon, but
still caught 6 passes for 77

To demonstrate Gene's tre
mendous ability one should re
call a play that came late in the
fourth quarter. Quarterback Don
Bunce tossed a 35 yard pass that
Gene came back toward scrim
mage to catch, despite being sur
rounded by three Oregon de
fenders. Washington now has 11
pass receptions for 247 yards
and 4 TD's.
Rounding out the receiving
corps was Jack Lasater who im
proved as the game continued,
and caught a 23 yard TD pass on
the opening drive of the second
halt
Defense Stifles Duck Momentum
Balancing frustrated Stanford
drives, the defense was led by
linebacker Don Parish, who was
also voted "Lineman of the
Game" for the second week in a
row. Don also led the defensive
stats with 16 tackles, seven of
which were unassisted.
But, like Plunkett, Parish was
by no means the whole show.
Dennis Moore, who is taking
over the roving linebacker posi
tion for injured Bill Shoemaker,
intercepted a pass to stop one
Oregon drive and knocked down
a pass to stop another.
Dick Oliver tallied 10 tackles,
recovered two key fumbles, and
broke up an Oregon two-point
conversion that could have help
ed the Web foots regain imeptus
in the fourth quarter.
Overall, the defense stopped
Oregon eleven different times,
through the efforts of Tom
Weingartner, Pat Preston, Bill
Nicholson, Stu Kellner, and Tom
Massey.


CLUTCH GRAB — Tight end Bob Moore (86) gets away from his man and hards in a Jim Plunkett
aerial on the Stanford 30. The reception was one of five by Moore, who snared a 18-yard TD oass
to get the Indians on the scoreboard late in the first quarter. With flanker Gene Washington get
ting double-teamed throughout most of the game, Moore became the prime receiver for Plunkett,
netting 86 yards for his day's work.
Stanford didn't score 68 points
Saturday afternoon, but the In
dians stifled a determined Uni
versity of Oregon team 28-12
for their second straight victory
of the young 1968 football cam
paign.
Not since 1962 has the Tribe
opened with two wins in a row.
And it was a tough win, since
the Ducks badly wanted to win
their debut in new Autzen Sta
dium before an enthusiastic
home-town crowd of 25,000.
The victory was a satisfying
one for Stanford, since Coach
John Ralston's men were eager
to prove that last Saturday's 68-
20 annihilation of San Jose
State wasn't an accident.
The Duck's downfall came
mostly from costly mistakes —
in terms of penalties, intercep
tions, and fumbles—and through
the scrambling efforts of Stan
ford's sophomore quarterback
Jim Plunkett, who consistently
flustered the Ducks with his
passing and running.
Plunkett Unloads 3 TD's
Plunkett completed 14 passes
for 227 yards and 3 touchdowns.
For the second week in a row
Jim was voted the "Back of the
Game," and his total statistics
for two games are just short of
amazing — 24 completed passes
in 39 attempts (.610 percentage),
504 yards gained passing, 7
touchdowns passing and 2 rush
ing, and 519 yards in total of
fense.
But Plunkett wasn't the only
weapon in Stanford's artillery.
The offensive line, led by Phil
Messer, Pete Seymour, Co-cap
tain Malcolm Snider, Phil Roin
hard, George Crooks, and sopho
more center John Sande, provid
ed great protection for Plunkett
and some crisp blocking for run
ning backs Greg Broughton and
Howie Williams.
Bob Moore, Stanford's tough

tight end, had a field day in pass
receptions. Bob caught 5 passes
for 86 yards and one touchdown.
Gene Washington, the Indian's
