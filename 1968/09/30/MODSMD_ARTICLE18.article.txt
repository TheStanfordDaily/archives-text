# Stanford Karate Club Enters 5th Year
## 
### 
The Stanford Karate Club be
gins its fifth year on October 1
at 7:00 P.M. in the Men's Gym
with an expanded program of in
struction in the art of kenpo
(Chinese) karate.
The club has four instructors
who direct the training of begin
ners, advanced students, and
members of the club's competi
tion team.
Open to both men and women,
the club has designed its pro
gram so that beginners learn
rapidly the fundamental tech
niques required for mastery of
more complex combinations
used in self-defense and free
style competition. The beginning
student is also familiarized with
some of the theoretical aspects
of the art so that he can begin
immediately to understand the
rationale behind the techniques
he is taught.
For the more advanced stu

dent, techniques and maneuvers
of greater complexity are taught
so that his knowledge of re
sponse patterns is broadened.
Techniques for defending
against gun, knife, club and
chain attacks are introduced as
well as methods for dealing with
several attackers. Simultaneous
ly, the advanced student is
drilled with exercises whirh are
designed to quicken his reflexes
so that he can respond to a situa
tion with blinding speed.
The freestyle competition
team comprises the third area of
the club's activity. The competi
tion team, which has entered nu
merous tournaments since the
club began, works on those
techniques which are suited to
freestyle sparring.
Frequent intra-club freestyle
matches are held so that mem
bers can perfect their timing,
speed and accuracy in the com

bat situation. The effectiveness
of this training program is evi
dent. d by the fact that several
club members have won major
tournaments on the West Coast.
Further, the club has the dis
tinction of being the first colle
giate karate club in the United
States to award varsity letters
for excellence in freestyle karate
competition. Two of the club's
members earned their varsity
letters last year, and all mem
bers of the competition team are
eligible for such awards.
Members of the Stanford Com
munity are invited to attend the
club's first meeting Tuesday
7:00 P.M. in the Men's Gym. A
demonstration of various tech
niques will be presented and the ;
entire program will be ex- 1
plained. The club meets every
Tuesday and Thursday evening |
from 7:00 to 8:30 P.M. in the !
Men's Gym.

The Stanford Karate Club be
gins its fifth year on October 1
at 7:00 P.M. in the Men's Gym
with an expanded program of in
struction in the art of kenpo
(Chinese) karate.
The club has four instructors
who direct the training of begin
ners, advanced students, and
members of the club's competi
tion team.
Open to both men and women,
the club has designed its pro
gram so that beginners learn
rapidly the fundamental tech
niques required for mastery of
more complex combinations
used in self-defense and free
style competition. The beginning
student is also familiarized with
some of the theoretical aspects
of the art so that he can begin
immediately to understand the
rationale behind the techniques
he is taught.
For the more advanced stu

dent, techniques and maneuvers
of greater complexity are taught
so that his knowledge of re
sponse patterns is broadened.
Techniques for defending
against gun, knife, club and
chain attacks are introduced as
well as methods for dealing with
several attackers. Simultaneous
ly, the advanced student is
drilled with exercises whirh are
designed to quicken his reflexes
so that he can respond to a situa
tion with blinding speed.
The freestyle competition
team comprises the third area of
the club's activity. The competi
tion team, which has entered nu
merous tournaments since the
club began, works on those
techniques which are suited to
freestyle sparring.
Frequent intra-club freestyle
matches are held so that mem
bers can perfect their timing,
speed and accuracy in the com

bat situation. The effectiveness
of this training program is evi
dent. d by the fact that several
club members have won major
tournaments on the West Coast.
Further, the club has the dis
tinction of being the first colle
giate karate club in the United
States to award varsity letters
for excellence in freestyle karate
competition. Two of the club's
members earned their varsity
letters last year, and all mem
bers of the competition team are
eligible for such awards.
Members of the Stanford Com
munity are invited to attend the
club's first meeting Tuesday
7:00 P.M. in the Men's Gym. A
demonstration of various tech
niques will be presented and the ;
entire program will be ex- 1
plained. The club meets every

from 7:00 to 8:30 P.M. in the !
