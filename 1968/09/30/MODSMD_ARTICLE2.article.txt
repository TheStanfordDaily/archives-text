# Coffee House—At Last
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
After half a decade of bicker
ing, false starts, and temporary
sites, the Stanford community
will have a permanent coffee
house in early October.
The coffee house, yet to be
named, will be in Tresidder Un
ion, the chief agent in supplying
initiative, space and finances.
The exact location is the old
billiards room which is present
ly being revamped with redwood
paneling, carpets, boat hatch
cover tabletops, stage and sound
equipment, and over 150 wooden
captains' chairs. The billiard ta
bles have been moved to the
ping pong room, and ping pong
is presently non-existent in Tres
idder.
Wide Variety
The coffee house will offer a
wide variety of food and drink,
running from a pick'e barrel and
sandwiches to exotic coffees
which Union Director Forest
Tregea promises "will be good
coffee."
Tregea's promise is backed by
an enthusiastic group in the
Tresidder kitchen. One cook says
he much prefers "making a hot
'strami plate than those damn
burgers."
The coffee house will be open
during lunch hours to releive the
crowded conditions in the Tres

idder food service, and will re
op n shortly after dinner to re
main open until past midnight.
The exact closing time will be
set according to the desires of
users.
Names Accepted
Names are being accepted at
the Tresiddor information desk
this week for students interested
in serving on a coffee house
committee to take charge of fi
nal construction, opening, and
long term operation, including
programming. These positions
will be remunerative.
The quest for a coffee house
at Stanford dates back several
years. Students have long sug
gested that the absence of a re
laxed gathering place, particular
ly after Tresidder closing time
at 11:30, called for the establish
ment of a coffee house.
The University was very skep
tical at first. One coffee house
was established in the summer
of 1966 in the International Cen
ter, but that September no alter
native space was provided by the
University as the dean of stu
dents office argued drugs were
being passed in the coffee house.
Napier Helped
Such fears lingered through
the fall quarter, but a number
of students and faculty, spear
headed by Davie Napier, Dean

of the Chapel, examined off cam
pus and on campus locations.
Tresiddor Union appeared as tho
only possibility, and in February
1967, a temporary coffee house
house was opened in the caf -
teria area of the Union.
Last year this operation con
tinued, known as "Dis-Joint."
""Dis-Joint", however, did not
satisfy the need of the commu
nity, handicapped from the start
by a small and unsuitable loca
tion.
This past summer began with
the impetus of a student refer
endum last spring in which more
than 90 per cent voted for the
creation of a permanent coffee
house. Denis Hayes, with coop
eration from the dean of stu
dents office, further promoted
the idea and actively searched
for a suitable location.
There was much talk of re
structuring the fire house when
the fire company moves to new
headquarters, but cost seemed
prohibitive. In early August,
when the search seemed futile,
Forest Tregea, newly named di
rector of the Union, offered
space at Tresidder, and followed
with finances and organizational
support.

ly being revamped with redwood
paneling, carpets, boat hatch
cover tabletops, stage and sound
equipment, and over 150 wooden
captains' chairs. The billiard ta
bles have been moved to the
ping pong room, and ping pong
is presently non-existent in Tres
idder.
Wide Variety
The coffee house will offer a
wide variety of food and drink,
running from a pick'e barrel and
sandwiches to exotic coffees
which Union Director Forest
Tregea promises "will be good
coffee."
Tregea's promise is backed by
an enthusiastic group in the
Tresidder kitchen. One cook says
he much prefers "making a hot
'strami plate than those damn
burgers."
The coffee house will be open
during lunch hours to releive the
crowded conditions in the Tres

idder food service, and will re
op n shortly after dinner to re
main open until past midnight.
The exact closing time will be
set according to the desires of
users.
Names Accepted
Names are being accepted at
the Tresiddor information desk
this week for students interested
in serving on a coffee house
committee to take charge of fi
nal construction, opening, and
long term operation, including
programming. These positions
will be remunerative.
The quest for a coffee house
at Stanford dates back several
years. Students have long sug
gested that the absence of a re
laxed gathering place, particular
ly after Tresidder closing time
at 11:30, called for the establish
ment of a coffee house.
The University was very skep
tical at first. One coffee house
was established in the summer
of 1966 in the International Cen
ter, but that September no alter
native space was provided by the
University as the dean of stu
dents office argued drugs were
being passed in the coffee house.
Napier Helped
Such fears lingered through
the fall quarter, but a number
of students and faculty, spear
headed by Davie Napier, Dean

of the Chapel, examined off cam
pus and on campus locations.
Tresiddor Union appeared as tho
only possibility, and in February
1967, a temporary coffee house
house was opened in the caf -
teria area of the Union.
Last year this operation con
tinued, known as "Dis-Joint."
""Dis-Joint", however, did not
satisfy the need of the commu
nity, handicapped from the start
by a small and unsuitable loca
tion.
This past summer began with
the impetus of a student refer
endum last spring in which more
than 90 per cent voted for the
creation of a permanent coffee
house. Denis Hayes, with coop
eration from the dean of stu
dents office, further promoted
the idea and actively searched
for a suitable location.
There was much talk of re
structuring the fire house when
the fire company moves to new
headquarters, but cost seemed
prohibitive. In early August,
when the search seemed futile,
Forest Tregea, newly named di
rector of the Union, offered
space at Tresidder, and followed
with finances and organizational
support.

After half a decade of bicker
ing, false starts, and temporary
sites, the Stanford community
will have a permanent coffee
house in early October.
The coffee house, yet to be
named, will be in Tresidder Un
ion, the chief agent in supplying
initiative, space and finances.
The exact location is the old
billiards room which is present
ly being revamped with redwood
paneling, carpets, boat hatch
cover tabletops, stage and sound
equipment, and over 150 wooden
captains' chairs. The billiard ta
bles have been moved to the
