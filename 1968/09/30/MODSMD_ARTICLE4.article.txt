# Lyman Contends Faculty, Students Need Responsibility

### CHRIS PECK 
"There is a widespread im
pression that Alma Mater has
lost her grip," Provost Richard
Lyman told alumni fund-raisers
here Saturday.
Provost Richard W. Lyman
presented a jarring and com
plex evaluation of modern Uni
versity governance Saturday in
a speech for the Special Gifts-
Annual Fund Conference.
The University's number two
administrator made a plea for
realistic responsibility to be
given to faculty and students
alike in dealing with University
government.
In his speech to the 500 alum
ni attending the conference, Ly
man said it was imperative that
college administrators "teach re
sponsibility in the only way it
has ever been successfully
taught, by putting people in po
sitions where they have some
thing to be responsible for."
In his opening remarks, Ly
man touched on the public rela
tion's problem between the ma
jor universities and"the news
paper-reading, television watch
ing public that has long since
come to the conclusion that on
the university scene, no one is
in charge."
In explaining why the govern
mental control is in question at
the university, Lyman stressed
the changes that have taken
place on the campuses of Amer

ica. No longer are the Board of
Trustees the controlling force on
the college scene, just as the ac
tual administration of the cam
pus is taking a backseat to the
faculty.
"A faculty's search for truth
cannot be managed," said Ly
man, just as the university can
not manage the "effort of each
individual student to find the
path to intellectual maturity.
"Education is a growing of the
mind and spirit ... it can be en
couraged, and to some extent
guided, but not managed."
With this picture of newly ar
ranged faculty and student di
rection, Lyman came to the crux
of his speech saying, "Granted
the 'good old days' are over, that
students will never again be obe
dient housemothers of both sex
es, this doesn't explain why or
ganized disruption of university
activity has taken place on one
campus after another, with no
end in sight."
Lyman posed the question of
discipline and governance to the
administrators saying "does this
mean there's nothing we can do
but take a beating first and a
backseat afterwards?"
The Provost concluded that
this wasn't the only answer and
that the administration can play
a much more important role in
campus government if "we can
make clear within the University

community the degree to which
we shall all—students, faculty
and staff alike—be losers if a
tolerable balance cannot be
struck between those age-old
Siamese twins, freedom and or
der."
Lyman then stressed the point
of realistic responsibility saying,
"we can try to teach responsi
bility in the only way it has ever
been successfully taught, by put
ting people into positions where
they have something to be re
sponsible for."
"The faculty are not going to
come seriously to grips with the
business of defining the frontier
between progress and disrup
tion," Lyman said. "Until they
are asked to do so and have rea
son to believe that what they
have to say on the matter will
count.
"The same is true of students.
If they have cause to believe that
when a member of the Establish
ment tells them to "be responsi
ble" all that really means is be
quiet — don't make waves, —if
that's what responsibility means,
students don't want any part of
it."
Lyman cited the newly created
faculty Senate, and the revised
student constitution at Stanford,
as two areas where students and
faculty alike "have an oppor
tunity ... to bring Into being
mechanisms through which they
can exercise genuine power re
sponsibility."

mind and spirit ... it can be en
couraged, and to some extent
guided, but not managed."
With this picture of newly ar
ranged faculty and student di
rection, Lyman came to the crux
of his speech saying, "Granted
the 'good old days' are over, that
students will never again be obe
dient housemothers of both sex
es, this doesn't explain why or
ganized disruption of university
activity has taken place on one
campus after another, with no
end in sight."
Lyman posed the question of
discipline and governance to the
administrators saying "does this
mean there's nothing we can do
but take a beating first and a
backseat afterwards?"
The Provost concluded that
this wasn't the only answer and
that the administration can play
a much more important role in
campus government if "we can
make clear within the University

community the degree to which
we shall all—students, faculty
and staff alike—be losers if a
tolerable balance cannot be
struck between those age-old
Siamese twins, freedom and or
der."
Lyman then stressed the point
of realistic responsibility saying,
"we can try to teach responsi
bility in the only way it has ever
been successfully taught, by put
ting people into positions where
they have something to be re
sponsible for."
"The faculty are not going to
come seriously to grips with the
business of defining the frontier
between progress and disrup
tion," Lyman said. "Until they
are asked to do so and have rea
son to believe that what they
have to say on the matter will
count.
"The same is true of students.
If they have cause to believe that
when a member of the Establish
ment tells them to "be responsi
ble" all that really means is be
quiet — don't make waves, —if
that's what responsibility means,
students don't want any part of
it."
Lyman cited the newly created
faculty Senate, and the revised
student constitution at Stanford,
as two areas where students and
faculty alike "have an oppor
tunity ... to bring Into being
mechanisms through which they
can exercise genuine power re
sponsibility."
"There is a widespread im

lost her grip," Provost Richard
Lyman told alumni fund-raisers
here Saturday.
Provost Richard W. Lyman
presented a jarring and com
plex evaluation of modern Uni
versity governance Saturday in
a speech for the Special Gifts-
Annual Fund Conference.
The University's number two
administrator made a plea for
realistic responsibility to be
given to faculty and students
alike in dealing with University
government.
In his speech to the 500 alum
ni attending the conference, Ly
man said it was imperative that
college administrators "teach re
sponsibility in the only way it
has ever been successfully
taught, by putting people in po
sitions where they have some
thing to be responsible for."
In his opening remarks, Ly
man touched on the public rela
tion's problem between the ma
jor universities and"the news
paper-reading, television watch
ing public that has long since
come to the conclusion that on
the university scene, no one is
in charge."
In explaining why the govern
mental control is in question at
the university, Lyman stressed
the changes that have taken
place on the campuses of Amer

ica. No longer are the Board of
Trustees the controlling force on
the college scene, just as the ac
tual administration of the cam
pus is taking a backseat to the
faculty.
"A faculty's search for truth
cannot be managed," said Ly
man, just as the university can
not manage the "effort of each
individual student to find the
path to intellectual maturity.
"Education is a growing of the
mind and spirit ... it can be en
couraged, and to some extent
guided, but not managed."
