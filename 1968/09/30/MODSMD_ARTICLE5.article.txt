# Revolutionist To Talk
## 
### 
Art Melville, a former Catho
lic priest who was expelled from
Guatemala in December 1967 for
his support of the Guatemalan
revolutionary movement, will
speak Monday at 4:15 in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium on the theme,
'Guatmala: The Next Vietnam?"
Melville claims that armed
revolution is the only way to
achieve a just society in Guate
mala. He also feels that the peo
ple of Guatemala are prepared

to make sacrifices comparable
to those of the Vietnamese in
the struggle against foreign in
tervention in their domestic rule.
Melville entered Guatemala in
December 1961, as a priest of
the Mary Knoll order. Since then,
he has become deeply involved
with a wide variety of social
reform programs, including cre
dit unions, literacy programs,
and medical clinics.
