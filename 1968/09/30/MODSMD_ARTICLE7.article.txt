# $ School Records Large Increase In'67 Gift Total $
## 
### 
Gifts totalling nearly $300 mil
lion were received by Stanford
in the year ending Aug. 31.
The figure — $29.7 million —
was announced Saturday by
Charles E. Ducommun of Los
Angeles, chairman of the Stan
ford Cabinet, at a campus con
ference attended by 500 volun
teer fund raisers. It represents
a 37.5 tper cent gain over the
previous year's total of $21.6
million.
The year just completed is the
third best year in Stanford's his
tory from the standpoint of gift
receipts and is exceeded only by
two years during the PACE cam
paign when $38 million was re
ceived in 1962-63 and $36 mil
lion in 1963-64. These higher fig
ures included approximately $8
million in each year in Ford
Foundation matching dollars.
Gifts of All Sizes
"The increase is not the result
of one or two tremendously large
gifts," Ducommun said, "but in
stead is the result of solid,
broad • based improvement in
nearly every size and category
of giving." New records were
set in many categories.
Gifts from living individuals
accounted for $8.2 million, 78
per cent higher than the $4.6
million received from that source
th' 1 year bcfor* and a new all
time high for Stanford.
New all-time highs were also

reached in gifts received for the
Stanford Annual Fund — $1.9
million — and from bequests —
$11 million.
There were more gifts to the
University and more donors
making them than in any other
year of Stanford's history. Liv
ing individual donors totaled 20,-
277 and estate, corporation and
foundation donors totaled 771
for a combined total of 21,048.
These donors made 30,169 gifts.
Kenneth M. Cuthbertson, vice
president for finance, told the
conference attendees that the
work they had done was "a mag
nificent record and a magnificent
beginning in meeting ever-ex
panding requirements of quality
higher education.
Cost Crisis
"Its' a beginning," Cuthbert
son said, "because we are enter
ing the sedfcmri decade of the cost
crisis facing Stanford — a crisis
now recognized also by other
major private universities.
"Federal support is an impond
erable, and tuition cannot be in
creased at a pace greater than
we have already scheduled.
Gifts are our only other source,
and what you have done in set
ting this record starts the up
ward trend for which we have
been hoping — a trend that must
reach $50 million a year in the
1970's if we are to meet Stan
ford's needs."
