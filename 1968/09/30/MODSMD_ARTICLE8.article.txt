EDITOR'S NOTE: Paul Ru
pert is a member of both the
campus ministry at Stanford anil
the Resistance. The subject of
his column today, Art Melville,
will speak in Dinkclspiel at 4:15
this afternoon.

In its time every empire
spawns its guerillas. In the bar
ren colony, a teacher breaks
away from his tasks, and begins
to spread the word. He sur
rounds himself with men; they
learn and teach together. Theirs
is a new vision, of the people
working together to form a sat
isfying world. It is a contagious
energy they release. The blind
soon see, the poor are fed, the
lame can walk. It is only a mat
ter of time, once the heresy
sets in.
Christ called himself teacher,
son of man. He organized a
small hand, split to the hills and
went into the cities. As a friend
of mine once said to a sour au
dience in Normal, Illinois, "His
only problem was that he got
eleven good cats and one CIA
man." Such a hazard is not un
common; it's the way of empire.
I am told that if you go into
the hills of Guatamala these
days, you will find men wander
ing from village to village, call
ing themselves teachers.
In those same hills, hills large

ly owned by wealthy oligarchs,
the American fruit companies,
you can find paratroopers. The
Roman soldier is American, the
teacher is armed against him.
We may quarrel that the ana
logy breaks down on the ques
tion of non-violence. But the lib
erator, the invincible, the son of
man — he who is strong enough
to stand and die that others
might live — is again with us.
The heresy has begun and the
Empire responds.
Art Melville, an American
priest, was expelled from Guat
emala. A follower of Christ, a
man painfully aware of the suf
ferings of the people and the in
ertia of the church, of the inter
ests of the many and the power
and holdings of the few, he took
to the hills. He tried being a
carpenter for awhile: he built
credit unions, farming co-oper
atives, small schools. But all was
hollow, for there is no land.
One per-cent of the people own
eighty per-cent of the land in
Guatemala. The daily wage is
under a dollar. The cost of liv
ing exceeds our own.
Once before, in 1954 when a
popularly elected president na
tionalized the land and gave it to
the people, he was quickly over
thrown by a "popular" invading
force whose officers were trained
in Kansas and whose planes
were flown by our fellow Amer

icans. The guerillas know only
one thing better than their his
tory: their futur-. It may be
death, or victory or betrayal—
but it will be theirs.
Art Melville, along with a
handful of brothers and sisters
from the church and the villages,
is building a new force in the
hills. It is a long, slow process,
and the dangers are building.
Their work is often betrayed.
The Church and the colonial gov
ernment and the U.S. Ambassa
dor — Pontius Pilate in troika
— cooperate in expel'ing the
clergy and executing others. But
the killing of a few is not the
end; the people and the rulers
brace for the beginning.
A few months ago, two mili
tary attaches were killed in Gua
temala, in broad daylight in the
middle of the city. Last month,
for the first time in diplomatic
recollection, the American Am
bassador was shot and kil' d in
broad daylight. The deaths a -
ready run into the thousands, nn
both sides. It is only the begin
ning.
We read the morning paper,
unaware of the Guatemalas —
they are all over Latin America
and Asia. Thousands of lives so
that we might have bananas on
our cereal.
Art Melville would like to talk
with us about our empire. Its
our decision.
