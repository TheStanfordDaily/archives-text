WHO RULES
STANFORD?
You'll have to read books to
find out.
How can you know the play"
ers as the fall sit-ins and con
frontations begin? For ex
ample, how can you tell Harris
from Rudd? Or Cleaver from
Stokely?
By reading books! â€” especi
ally paperbacks.
And who has all the paper
backs? KEPLER'S has them.
KEPLER'S where Stanford stu
dents have been out of bounds
for generations.
Fro mthe Silent Generation
to the Beat Generation to the
Now Generation, KEPLER'S has
maintained a minority position
on violence ( KEPLE R ' S is
against it) and has maintained
a majority position on paper
backs (KEPLER'S has just about
all of them).
Finally, how can you tell the
difference between Humphrey
and Nixon? Neither KEPLER
nor the books can help you on
that!
