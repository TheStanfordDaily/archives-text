# 'New Order'
## Cleaver Talks Tonight 
### 
Eldridge Cleaver, Black Pan
ther Minister of Information and
author of "Soul on Ice" will lec
ture tonight in Memorial Audi
torium at 8 p.m.
The black militant and presi
dential candidate of the Peace
and Freedom Party will lecture
on the problems of the black
community, the methods for
change and his vision of the new
order. The topics were originally
scheduled as individual lectures
but Cleaver desired to address
the question as a whole. Two fol
low-up lectures will be planned
barring scheduling difficulties
according to David Jones, chair
man of the sponsoring group,
The Committee for a New Demo
cratic Politics.
Cleaver's speaking schedule has
been disrupted due to a superior
court ruling that suspends the
ex-convict's parole and orders
his return to prison. The ruling,

which overturns an appellate diX
vision decision granting Cleav
er's parole, allows 60 days for
appeal. Scheduling of future
Cleaver appearances on campus
will be dependent upon the prog
ress and results of the appeal
according to Ramparts Magazine
where Cleaver is a staff editor.
Tonight's p.ppearance is definite
ly confirmed, only future ap
pearances are in question, Jones
said.
The Black Panther was the
center of a controversy last
month when he was invited to
lecture at the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley. The Board of
Regents of the State institution
gunned down a student-planned
course that featured Cleaver as
head lecturer. The Regents' rul
ing allows Cleaver to make one
appearance rather than the
scheduled ten.
The Berkeley controversy
continues as student and faculty

groups declare that Cleaver will
speak 10 times regardless of the
official ruling from the Board of
Regents. Cleaver himself has
vowed that he will give twenty
lectures at Berkeley in response
to the tactics of Governor Ron
ald Reagan whom he dismisses
as "Mickey Mouse Reagan."
Reagan and the Regents have
made it clear that they intend
their one-lecture ruling to stick.
The controversy is continuing
with little common meeting
ground between the proponents
of academic freedom and those
who have insisted that an ex
convict and self-described mili
tant is unfit for the role of
classroom lecturer.
Tonight's lecture by Cleaver
will be introduced by history pro
fessor Oliver W. Holmes, head
lecturer in Stanford's new "Rac
ism and Prejudice" course.
An admission charge of 75
cents will be charged to meet
the cost of Cleaver's honorarium.
Several Stanford professors
and instructors have assigned
their classes to attend the lec
ture. 'They apparently recog
nize," Jones said, "the value of
Cleaver's insight and experience
and realize, unlike the Regents,
that the exposure to ideas is not
the same thing as endorsement."
