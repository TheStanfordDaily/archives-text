# Maury Travis Is Alive and well in the Rockies
## 
### MAURY TRAVIS 
EDITOR'S NOTE: Maury
Travis is a real person who lives
in Denver, Colorado. He has
agreed to provide the DAILY
with his commentary on a reg
ular basis.

I respect and defend CIA,
IDA, DOW, ROTC and SRI. The
purpose of this guest editorial
is to acquaint Stanford papooses
in-residence with the brutal
facts of life.
1) CIA (Central Intelligence
Agency)
Man has been a warring ani
mal since the year one. Also a
suspicious one. In self-defense
and also on offense, he has
always spied on his neighbors.
The CIA must counter the
espionage of KGB, USSR's sec
ret intelligence organization, for
the national security—in self-de
fense. KGB is now purging
thousands of Czech intellectuals,
professors, artists, writers for
their audacity in opposing the
Stalinist Communist police state.
2) DOVV CHEMICAL COM
PANY (Napalm et al)
U.S. and allied armed forces
greatest weapon against sub
versive Communist, guerillas
who attack from jungle environ
ments, is not only air strikes
and artillery, but also napalm

fire bombing to detect and de
stroy North Vietnam troops who
use the jungle for concealment
before surprise attacks. This is
why Communist subversion
works assidously in the Free
World colleges and universities
to attack the use of napalm
and American defense contract
ors such as Dow Chemical Com
pany.
3) IDA (Institute For Defense
Analyses)
IDA is a key agency to pre
pare defense analyses for the
national security and is therefore,
a prime target for Communist
subversion and propaganda.
Research organizations patri
otically accept contracts from
IDA and serve the national in
terest and thereby counter in
tensive research by enemy coun
tries such as the Soviet Union
and Red China whose announced
intentions are to attack the Free
World and dominate the globe.
4) ROTC (Reserve Officers
Training Corps)
I personally served two years
in the ROTC Field Artillery at
the University of Oklahoma
(1922 to 1924) and also at Stan

ford (1925-26), gaining a 2nd
Lieutenants Commission later in
the Corps of Engineers in 1928.
The ROTC is a special target
for Communist subversion
groups in the Bay Region at
Stanford, Berkeley and Seattle,
because ROTC prepares officers
for the national defense.
5) SRI (Stanford Research Insti
tute)
SRI is doing a great deal of
classified research for national
defense, and is, therefore, a
prime target for attacks by
enemy agents.
I personally visited SRI in the
interest of civil defense, after
receiving a U.S. certificate in
civil defense at Alameda, Cali
fornia in February, 1961, and
taking a second CD course (top
course in nation) at Battle
Creek, Michigan, April, 1961. I
inspected SRI civil defense base
ment installations and received
their CD bulletin, "LIVE," which
is available to the public and is
of special interest to Stanford
people who may wish to survive
atomic attack in the Coast
Ranges.

people who may wish to survive
atomic attack in the Coast
Ranges.
EDITOR'S NOTE: Maury
Travis is a real person who lives
in Denver, Colorado. He has
agreed to provide the DAILY
with his commentary on a reg
ular basis.

I respect and defend CIA,
IDA, DOW, ROTC and SRI. The
purpose of this guest editorial
is to acquaint Stanford papooses
in-residence with the brutal
facts of life.
1) CIA (Central Intelligence
Agency)
Man has been a warring ani
mal since the year one. Also a
suspicious one. In self-defense
and also on offense, he has
always spied on his neighbors.
The CIA must counter the
espionage of KGB, USSR's sec
ret intelligence organization, for
the national security—in self-de
fense. KGB is now purging
thousands of Czech intellectuals,
professors, artists, writers for
their audacity in opposing the
Stalinist Communist police state.
2) DOVV CHEMICAL COM
PANY (Napalm et al)
U.S. and allied armed forces
greatest weapon against sub
versive Communist, guerillas
who attack from jungle environ
ments, is not only air strikes
and artillery, but also napalm

fire bombing to detect and de
stroy North Vietnam troops who
use the jungle for concealment
before surprise attacks. This is
why Communist subversion
works assidously in the Free
World colleges and universities
to attack the use of napalm
and American defense contract
ors such as Dow Chemical Com
pany.
3) IDA (Institute For Defense
Analyses)
IDA is a key agency to pre
pare defense analyses for the
national security and is therefore,
a prime target for Communist
subversion and propaganda.
Research organizations patri
otically accept contracts from
IDA and serve the national in
terest and thereby counter in
tensive research by enemy coun
tries such as the Soviet Union
and Red China whose announced
intentions are to attack the Free
World and dominate the globe.
4) ROTC (Reserve Officers
Training Corps)
I personally served two years
in the ROTC Field Artillery at
the University of Oklahoma
(1922 to 1924) and also at Stan

ford (1925-26), gaining a 2nd
Lieutenants Commission later in
the Corps of Engineers in 1928.
The ROTC is a special target
for Communist subversion
groups in the Bay Region at
Stanford, Berkeley and Seattle,
because ROTC prepares officers
for the national defense.
5) SRI (Stanford Research Insti
tute)
SRI is doing a great deal of
classified research for national
defense, and is, therefore, a
prime target for attacks by
enemy agents.
I personally visited SRI in the
interest of civil defense, after
receiving a U.S. certificate in
civil defense at Alameda, Cali
fornia in February, 1961, and
taking a second CD course (top
course in nation) at Battle
Creek, Michigan, April, 1961. I
inspected SRI civil defense base
ment installations and received
their CD bulletin, "LIVE," which
is available to the public and is
of special interest to Stanford
people who may wish to survive
atomic attack in the Coast
Ranges.
