### SKIP HARRIS 
Today Eldridge Cleaver will
lecture on the Stanford campus.
He will not, however, be appear
ing as part of any official course
at Stanford. There is also the
excellent possibility that he will
not appear at any California
university as part of any official
course.
The regents of the University
of California have raised the
question of qualifications for
course lecturers and Governor
Reagan has said: "... I don't
know why they never asked the
head of the American Nazi Party
to conduct a course on that.
It would be a very interesting
course. It could even get into the
area of engineering and science
— how to build an oven, how
high a fence around a concentra
tion camp."
This kind of talk makes one
wonder how extensive has been
the governor's exposure to the
process of higher education.
What he does not seem to grasp
is that it might be useful to have
the head of the American Nazi

Party lecture at Stanford or Cal.
If one of the university's roles
is to prepare its students to bet
ter cope with the complexities
of society, exposing its students
to the problems of that society
should be a legitimate way to
achieve that end.
The issue raised again at Ber
keley is the one of "academic
freedom." How much control is
the university going to have over
the programs of the Cal cam
puses? To what extent is the
state qualified to regulate the
curircula of its universities?
Shouldn't the universities be al
lowed freedom from the society
so that society itself can be a
subject of study?

If this last goal is achieved,
if we can hope to have a gen
eration that is not susceptible
to the errors of the past genera
tions, then there must be some
freedom from those restrictions.
Academic freedom does not
mean anarchy; it merely ac
knowledges that a political sci
entist may know more about
political science than society at
large.
Academic freedom does not
mean retreat to the ivory tower
but the contrary. It suggests an
involvement in and a commit
ment to society, with freedom
from the petty prejudices and
simplicities that it is trying to
overcome.

If this last goal is achieved,
if we can hope to have a gen
eration that is not susceptible
to the errors of the past genera

entist may know more about
political science than society at

Academic freedom does not
mean retreat to the ivory tower
but the contrary. It suggests an
involvement in and a commit
ment to society, with freedom
from the petty prejudices and
simplicities that it is trying to
overcome.
