## Stanford's Company Town? 
### 
As a prospective resident in
the new Frenchman's Hill tract,
may I clarify a point which
Friedrich Abel made in his ar
ticle on Faculty Housing (Sept.
24)?
As in his articles in the sum
mer issue, Mr. Abel refers re
peatedly to "the free land" which
the University "gives" to fac
ulty members who are willing to
build on Stanford property. Only
once does he add a qualifying
phrase: "The land itself is free
- except for a development fee
— to prospective home owners."
I would like to point out that
this "development fee" is not, as
one might easily assume, a triv
ial matter of a few hundred dol
lars. In my own case, for ex
ample, the development fee was
$7,500.00. . . .
This being the case, Mr. Abel's
well-intentioned suggestion that
"other persons — preferrablv
minority group members —
should be allowed the free land
to build in the faculty area"
proves unrealistic. For who
would be willing to pay a sub
stantial price for a lot only to
have the price re-defined as "de
velopment fee" so that the Uni
versity can legally retain pos
session of the land after the
owner has paid for it? (The land
is leased, not given to the faculty
member.)
These points being so, on? may
well ask why the Stanford fac
ulty member accepts the Uni
versity's terms. The answer, as
Mr. Abel has rightly suspected,
is the long term loan at interest
!ow«r than those general 1 y

available in this area and with
a low (10%) down payment.
On a Stanford professor's sal
ary, one is not financially able
to buy a lot near the University
on the loan terms available in
town. (I do not refer to the oc
casional staff member who is
sufficiently wealthy to build a
$100,000 house on Stanford prop
erty; his reasoning escapes me.)
It is because of the favorable
loan arrangements, then, that
faculty members are willing to
make payments all their lives on
land which will never be theirs
and accept a multitude of Uni
versity stipulations as to how
much money he will spend on his
house and how he will spend it.
The fact is, Mr. Abel's "com

pany town" analogy is far more
apt than he seems to realize, for
it goes a long way toward an
swering his question as to why
Stanford faculty members "pre
fer to be separated in their pri
vate lives from the rest of so
ciety."
May I, in closing, have space
to quote one of Mr. Abel's sen
tences which seems to me so
very much to the point as re
gards the question he has raised
that it deserves iteration:
"Also it seems that in the in
terests of fairness the Univer
sity should give professors
who wish to build homes off
campus loans similar to those
given on-campus builders."

ial matter of a few hundred dol
lars. In my own case, for ex
ample, the development fee was
$7,500.00. . . .
This being the case, Mr. Abel's
well-intentioned suggestion that
"other persons — preferrablv
minority group members —
should be allowed the free land
to build in the faculty area"
proves unrealistic. For who
would be willing to pay a sub
stantial price for a lot only to
have the price re-defined as "de
velopment fee" so that the Uni
versity can legally retain pos
session of the land after the
owner has paid for it? (The land
is leased, not given to the faculty
member.)
These points being so, on? may
well ask why the Stanford fac
ulty member accepts the Uni
versity's terms. The answer, as
Mr. Abel has rightly suspected,
is the long term loan at interest
!ow«r than those general 1 y

available in this area and with
a low (10%) down payment.
On a Stanford professor's sal
ary, one is not financially able
to buy a lot near the University
on the loan terms available in
town. (I do not refer to the oc
casional staff member who is
sufficiently wealthy to build a
$100,000 house on Stanford prop
erty; his reasoning escapes me.)
It is because of the favorable
loan arrangements, then, that
faculty members are willing to
make payments all their lives on
land which will never be theirs
and accept a multitude of Uni
versity stipulations as to how
much money he will spend on his
house and how he will spend it.
The fact is, Mr. Abel's "com

pany town" analogy is far more
apt than he seems to realize, for
it goes a long way toward an
swering his question as to why
Stanford faculty members "pre
fer to be separated in their pri
vate lives from the rest of so
ciety."
May I, in closing, have space
to quote one of Mr. Abel's sen
tences which seems to me so
very much to the point as re
gards the question he has raised
that it deserves iteration:
"Also it seems that in the in
terests of fairness the Univer
sity should give professors
who wish to build homes off
campus loans similar to those
given on-campus builders."

As a prospective resident in
the new Frenchman's Hill tract,
may I clarify a point which
Friedrich Abel made in his ar
ticle on Faculty Housing (Sept.
24)?
As in his articles in the sum
mer issue, Mr. Abel refers re
peatedly to "the free land" which
the University "gives" to fac
ulty members who are willing to
build on Stanford property. Only
once does he add a qualifying
phrase: "The land itself is free
- except for a development fee
— to prospective home owners."
I would like to point out that
this "development fee" is not, as
one might easily assume, a triv
ial matter of a few hundred dol
lars. In my own case, for ex
ample, the development fee was
$7,500.00. . . .
