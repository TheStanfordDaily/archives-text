### ART BUCHWALD 
In the movie "The Graduate,"
the hero, Dustin Hoffman, is
seduced by a Mrs. Robinson.
Thanks to a hit song written and
sung by Simon and Garfunkel,
"Mrs. Robinson" has now be
come part of American folklore.
I hadn't realized the impact of
the film or the song until I start
ed talking the other day with
a friend of mine who happened
to have the same name.
This Mrs. Robinson, a middle
aged lady, said that because of
"The Graduate" she's had a new
lease on life.
"I didn't realize what was go
ing on at first," she said. "But
then one day as I paid my bill
at the grocer's with a check, the

young man behind the counter
winked at me and started sing
ing. 'Jesus loves you more than
you will know — wo, wo, wo.'
"A few days later, as I was
getting gas for my car, I handed
over me credit card and when
the young man looked at it, he
whistled and said, 'Where are
you going tonight, Mrs. Robin
son?'
"At first I was going to com
plain to the manager, but then
I thought to myself 'If I got
two passes in one week, there
must be something more to this
than I'm aware of.'
"I discovered what was up
when my teen-age son said, 'All
the guys want to meet you,
Mom.'
"'What on earth for?';
"He just laughed and said,
'Heaven holds a place for those
who pray — hey, hey, hey. Hey,
hey, hey.'
"I got mad and said, 'Stop this
drivel. What's going on with you
kids these days?'
"He brought down the Simon
and Garfunkel record and said,
'coo coo co-choo, Mrs. Robin
son.' "
Mrs. Robinson continued:
"When I heard the record I
was flabbergasted, and when I
went to see the movie 'The
Graduate,' I was dumbfounded.
I wondered how many Mrs. Rob
insons were being defamed be
cause of one Mrs. Robinson who
had gone astray."
"What could you do about it
without changing your name?"
I said.
"I gave it some thought and
I decided the worst thing to do
was fight it. So now when the
grocery boy winks at me, I wink
back; and when the gas station
attendant starts getting fresh, I

just start singing, 'Where have
you gone Joe DiMaggio, a na
tion turns its lonoly eyes on you,
000, 000, ooo.' "
"What about your son's
friends?"
"They're around the house all
the time. Before the film came
out they never talked to me.
Now they invite me to join all
their conversations, and they are
interested in everything I have
to say."
"What does Mr. Robinson have
to say about all this?"
"That's the amazing thing.
With all this hubbub going on
with the kids, he's suddenly
taken a new interest in me, and
for the first time in 10 years he's
jealous. Every time someone
sings, 'Put it in your pantry
with your cupcake. It's a little
secret — the Robinsons' affair,'
he seethes with rage. It's nice
still to be wanted when your
kids are in high school."
"I guess in the long run then,
this has been a good year for
the Mrs. Robinsons of this
world."
"Let's say it was a bonus that
none of us expected. God bless
you please, Simon and Gar
funkel."
As I shook hands with her an
amazing thing happened. For the
first time I noticed that Mrs.
Robinson looked very attractive,
almost, I might say, beautiful.
