# Columbia Admits Spring Protesters
## 
### 
At Columbia, registration was
canceled for the day on Septem
ber 18 by Registrar William B.
Kahn, after an SDS protest in
volving reinstatement of 30 stu
dents suspended at last spring's
demonstrations. The Universi
ty's acting president, Andrew
W. Cordier, has agreed to allow
48 of the suspended students to
register, but refused the other
30 on the basis that they were
the "hard - core radicals who
caused last spring's demonstra
tions."
Columbia officials then re
fused to allow SDS to use uni
versity facilities to hold a meet
ing of the International Associ
ation of Revolutionary Students
at 2 p.m. the same day. About
200 students, many of whom
were involved in the demonstra
tion at registration, took over
Sehermerhorn Hall in defiance
of the University's orders.
The next day, registration
continued without incident and
President Cordier appeared un
expectedly at a teach-in con
cerning Columbia's future. "The

policy this year will be based on
long-term relations," Cordier
said. A demonstrator wearing a
camouflage suit asked about
"the issues" - Columbia's in
volvement in war research and
plans to expand university
buildings into Morningside
Heights. Cordier replied, "On
the issues, there's a curious
tendency for them to get larger
and larger. I'm wondering
when are they going to stop?"
Disciplinary action against
the demonstrators was avowed
by Irving de Koff, Director of
Student Interests. "Just as soon
as we can get the machinery
moving," de Koff said, ajs he
took down names of students he
recognized.
Meanwhile, Columbia officials
have announced their offer of
the position of Vice - President
for Public Affairs to Frank
Mankiewicz, press secretary to
the late Sen. Robert Kennedy.
Mankiewicz said he is still con
sidering the offer.
A faculty committee at Roo
sevelt University in Chicago

recommended that nine out of
13 students suspended after last
spring's sit-ins there be rein
stated on disciplinary probation.
The committee also demanded
5200 in damages to university
property from the nine students.
Last spring's demonstrations
centered about Staughton Lynd,
a history professor there who
was refused reappointment for
this year. This summer the His
tory Department at Roosevelt
recommended to President Rolf
Weil that Lynd be given the ap
pointment, but Weil has stood
firm. Two instructors have since
resigned from Roosevelt's His
tory Department, and an AAUP
investigation of the case is being
conducted. Lynd will be teach
ing part-time at Columbia Col
lege, a small communications
college in Chicago, this fall.

tendency for them to get larger
and larger. I'm wondering
when are they going to stop?"
Disciplinary action against
the demonstrators was avowed
by Irving de Koff, Director of
Student Interests. "Just as soon
as we can get the machinery
moving," de Koff said, ajs he
took down names of students he
recognized.
Meanwhile, Columbia officials
have announced their offer of
the position of Vice - President
for Public Affairs to Frank
Mankiewicz, press secretary to
the late Sen. Robert Kennedy.
Mankiewicz said he is still con
sidering the offer.
A faculty committee at Roo
sevelt University in Chicago

recommended that nine out of
13 students suspended after last
spring's sit-ins there be rein
stated on disciplinary probation.
The committee also demanded
5200 in damages to university
property from the nine students.
Last spring's demonstrations
centered about Staughton Lynd,
a history professor there who
was refused reappointment for
this year. This summer the His
tory Department at Roosevelt
recommended to President Rolf
Weil that Lynd be given the ap
pointment, but Weil has stood
firm. Two instructors have since
resigned from Roosevelt's His
tory Department, and an AAUP
investigation of the case is being
conducted. Lynd will be teach
ing part-time at Columbia Col
lege, a small communications
college in Chicago, this fall.
At Columbia, registration was
canceled for the day on Septem
ber 18 by Registrar William B.
Kahn, after an SDS protest in
volving reinstatement of 30 stu
dents suspended at last spring's
demonstrations. The Universi
ty's acting president, Andrew
W. Cordier, has agreed to allow
48 of the suspended students to
register, but refused the other
30 on the basis that they were
the "hard - core radicals who
caused last spring's demonstra
tions."
Columbia officials then re
fused to allow SDS to use uni
versity facilities to hold a meet
ing of the International Associ
ation of Revolutionary Students
at 2 p.m. the same day. About
200 students, many of whom
were involved in the demonstra
tion at registration, took over
Sehermerhorn Hall in defiance
of the University's orders.
The next day, registration
continued without incident and
President Cordier appeared un
expectedly at a teach-in con
cerning Columbia's future. "The

policy this year will be based on
long-term relations," Cordier
said. A demonstrator wearing a
camouflage suit asked about
"the issues" - Columbia's in
volvement in war research and
plans to expand university
buildings into Morningside
Heights. Cordier replied, "On
the issues, there's a curious
tendency for them to get larger
and larger. I'm wondering
when are they going to stop?"
