# BSU Demand
## Race Relations Investigated 
### 
The Stanford Human Rela
tions Commission, created last
April, is continuing its investi
gation of discriminatory acts on
campus.
The need for such a commis
sion was stated last spring as
one of the nine demands pre
sented by the Black Student Un
ion to the university adminis
tration.
The BSU charged that Stan
ford was guilty of denying equal
education opportunities to mi
nority group members of the
local community" and stated
further that "recent negotiations
for the purpose of instituting
change . . . resulted in token
symbolic acts which do not meet
the education needs of current
ly enrolled or systematically re
jected minority group members."
BSU's Original Demand
One of the demands the BSU
asked for was the creation of "a
permanent committee with re
sponsibility for investigating
charges relating to acts of dis
crimination . . . and that its de
cisions be consistent with stated
University policy and thereby
binding upon the university."
The committee was created,
but Provost Richard Lyman
stated that it was not directly
the result of the BSU demands.
Lyman said at that time, "The
need for a mechanism to deal
with grievances is one that has

already been recognized by the
creation of the new Human Re
lations Commission."
Union Employees Investigated
The Commission has been
investigating charges leveled
against two Stanford student
union employees last March in
volving discrimination.
The employees were a super
visor in the Tresidder Memorial
Union and a clerk in the Union
drug store. According to Mrs.
Gertrude Wilks, chairman of
the executive board of the East
Palo Alto Day School, during a
visit of 15-20 day school stu
dents to the campus some of
the students were accused of
stealing items from the store
ind one or two others had their

purses searched by one of the
employees.
Discrimination Found
The case was taken before the
Human Relations Commission
for hearings. President Wallace
Sterling announced the Commis
sion's feelings, saying that the
charges rais'd could not sub
stantiated by the Commission,
but that the hearing had shown
that "in certain more general
respects the action of the em
ployees constituted discriminat
ing conduct."
This included what the Com
mission found to be excessive
surveillance of the students and
the unwarranted closing of the
store.
Commission's Recommendations
Recommendations included hu
man-relations instructions for

union employees, establishment
of policies regarding visitors,
employment of additional per
sonnel, including non - Cauea- !
inns and the posting of rules
for visitors.

the education needs of current
ly enrolled or systematically re
jected minority group members."
BSU's Original Demand
One of the demands the BSU
asked for was the creation of "a
permanent committee with re
sponsibility for investigating
charges relating to acts of dis
crimination . . . and that its de
cisions be consistent with stated
University policy and thereby
binding upon the university."
The committee was created,
but Provost Richard Lyman
stated that it was not directly
the result of the BSU demands.
Lyman said at that time, "The
need for a mechanism to deal
with grievances is one that has

already been recognized by the
creation of the new Human Re
lations Commission."
Union Employees Investigated
The Commission has been
investigating charges leveled
against two Stanford student
union employees last March in
volving discrimination.
The employees were a super
visor in the Tresidder Memorial
Union and a clerk in the Union
drug store. According to Mrs.
Gertrude Wilks, chairman of
the executive board of the East
Palo Alto Day School, during a
visit of 15-20 day school stu
dents to the campus some of
the students were accused of
stealing items from the store
ind one or two others had their

purses searched by one of the
employees.
Discrimination Found
The case was taken before the
Human Relations Commission
for hearings. President Wallace
Sterling announced the Commis
sion's feelings, saying that the
charges rais'd could not sub
stantiated by the Commission,
but that the hearing had shown
that "in certain more general
respects the action of the em
ployees constituted discriminat
ing conduct."
This included what the Com
mission found to be excessive
surveillance of the students and
the unwarranted closing of the
store.
Commission's Recommendations
Recommendations included hu
man-relations instructions for

union employees, establishment
of policies regarding visitors,
employment of additional per
sonnel, including non - Cauea- !
inns and the posting of rules
for visitors.
The Stanford Human Rela
tions Commission, created last
April, is continuing its investi
gation of discriminatory acts on
campus.
The need for such a commis
sion was stated last spring as
one of the nine demands pre
sented by the Black Student Un
ion to the university adminis
tration.
The BSU charged that Stan
ford was guilty of denying equal
education opportunities to mi
nority group members of the
local community" and stated
further that "recent negotiations
for the purpose of instituting
change . . . resulted in token
symbolic acts which do not meet
the education needs of current
ly enrolled or systematically re
jected minority group members."
