# "Let them march in their rags"
## 
### 
And they did.
On the morning of Monday, Septem
ber 3, 1894, the first national Labor
Day Parade in American history started
up Fourth Avenue in New York City.
About "one-half of the city" turned out
to see the 12,000 march.
Just before the parade began, a dele
gation of women garment workers
appeared before the New York Central
Labor Union.
The women were embarrassed.
"They have very poor clothes," ex
plained a delegate, "many of them are
little better than rags."

"So much the better," another dele
gate responded. "Let them march in
their rags."
And they did, taking their place
alongside the cigarmakers, iron work
ers, wood carvers, typographical work
ers, beer drivers, electrical workers,
carpenters, and horse shoers.
Not until the coming of the Inter
national Ladies' Garment Workers'
Union were working people in the gar
ment trade able to enjoy Saturdays,
Sundays and holidays—such as Labor
Day —with family and friends.
Today, we 450,000 members of the

ILGWU (80% women) are proud of
our union and the benefits we have won:
fair wages, decent working conditions,
security on the job.
Our signature is the union label sewn
into women's and children's garments.
It is the symbol of progress made; and
more to come.
Look for it when you shop.

If you'd like some interesting (and
brief) reading plus many fascinating his

cation entitled "Signature of 450,000."
