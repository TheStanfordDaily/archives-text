# Black Power: 'Key To National Unity'
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
America is headed for "doom"
unless it heeds the call of the
Black Power movement, a black
Columbia University professor
warned yesterday.
Black Power is the force that
that can unite the currently di
vided American society, Frank
lin Williams asserted.
And America is certain to con
tinue as a racist, unequal society
without the Black Power move
ment, the urbanologist and soci
ologist added.
Williams is the director of the
Center for Urban Affairs at Col
umbia University and former
ambassador to Ghana. He ad
dressed a Tresidder audience
yesterday on "Urban Problems
and Black Power."
"Something is desperately
wrong with this country," Wil
liams claimed, and it is the
growing consciousness of
"strength, dignity, and pride"
among black Americans that is
making this clear to white Am
erica.
New Pride
Only by fostering this new
found pride in self can black
America emerge from its long
history of inequality and help
create a country that is unified.
"We have always been two
societies, separate and unequal,"
Williams explained. "But now
we can build a new society with
this growth of black awareness.
We are now able to build a new
society without masters and
without slaves."
Williams categorized respons
es thus far on the part of white
Americans to the black "desire
to be free" as "responses of fear,
ignorance, and repression, not
out of keeping with American
history. The United States has
always met Negro asperations
with violence."
Real Equality
Williams continued that "if
white America reacts with re
pression and violence to this call
for real equality, then, hell,
white America isn't worth sav
ing."
Black Power is an important
first step in incorporating the
Negro in American society as an
equal member, according to Wil
liams, who is a former regional

NAACP secretary. It instills a
sense of identity and pride in
self that has been lacking.
Williams sees this movement
as "a healthy thing . . . that will
grip all of black America. A
great wave of solidarity is
sweeping middle class Negroes,
urging them to join their ghetto
brothers.
Racial Togetherness
"Blacks must be joined to
gether. Call it whatever you
will, Black Power if you must;
but racial togetherness is essen
tial. They want to say more
about the way they live, their
communities, and the future of
America itself. To respond with
fear or repression spells doom
for this country; it is up to us
all to respond, especially white,
liberal, middle class America."
Williams attributed the sud
den birth of the Black Power
movement to an increasing gulf
between the haves and have
nots. Citizens of the ghetto were
left behind in the new age of
"computers, rockets, and instant
communications."
"The nation has grown stead
ily richer, while the conditions
of the slums have steadily de
teriorated," he said.
Malcolm X
Black Pwer, he claimed, is a
response to this "society of
waste." Pictures of Malcolm X.
proud and smiling girls, and
"natural" hair styles are all
ghetto phenomenon that Wil
liams considers "healthy."
White superiority, he added, is
now "scoffed at. Whites can no
longer define the type of society
that blacks will live in. They
now realize that there is no
place for them in the main
stream of America" as it is now
constituted.
Williams had kind words for
Eldridge Cleaver and the pro
posed name change from East
Pal Alto to Nairobi. He said
he was "quite impressed" with
Cleaver after holding a two
hour meeting with the Black
Panther leader Sunday.
He added that he found little
to disagree with in the Black
Panther platform, although he
noted that the platform docu
ment contains no references to
violence.

Only by fostering this new
found pride in self can black
America emerge from its long
history of inequality and help
create a country that is unified.
"We have always been two
societies, separate and unequal,"
Williams explained. "But now
we can build a new society with
this growth of black awareness.
We are now able to build a new
society without masters and
without slaves."
Williams categorized respons
es thus far on the part of white
Americans to the black "desire
to be free" as "responses of fear,
ignorance, and repression, not
out of keeping with American
history. The United States has
always met Negro asperations
with violence."
Real Equality
Williams continued that "if
white America reacts with re
pression and violence to this call
for real equality, then, hell,
white America isn't worth sav
ing."
Black Power is an important
first step in incorporating the
Negro in American society as an
equal member, according to Wil
liams, who is a former regional

NAACP secretary. It instills a
sense of identity and pride in
self that has been lacking.
Williams sees this movement
as "a healthy thing . . . that will
grip all of black America. A
great wave of solidarity is
sweeping middle class Negroes,
urging them to join their ghetto
brothers.
Racial Togetherness
"Blacks must be joined to
gether. Call it whatever you
will, Black Power if you must;
but racial togetherness is essen
tial. They want to say more
about the way they live, their
communities, and the future of
America itself. To respond with
fear or repression spells doom
for this country; it is up to us
all to respond, especially white,
liberal, middle class America."
Williams attributed the sud
den birth of the Black Power
movement to an increasing gulf
between the haves and have
nots. Citizens of the ghetto were
left behind in the new age of
"computers, rockets, and instant
communications."
"The nation has grown stead
ily richer, while the conditions
of the slums have steadily de
teriorated," he said.

White superiority, he added, is
now "scoffed at. Whites can no
longer define the type of society
that blacks will live in. They
now realize that there is no
place for them in the main
stream of America" as it is now
constituted.
Williams had kind words for
Eldridge Cleaver and the pro
posed name change from East
Pal Alto to Nairobi. He said
he was "quite impressed" with
Cleaver after holding a two
hour meeting with the Black
Panther leader Sunday.
He added that he found little
to disagree with in the Black
Panther platform, although he
noted that the platform docu
ment contains no references to
violence.
America is headed for "doom"
unless it heeds the call of the

Black Power is the force that
that can unite the currently di

And America is certain to con
tinue as a racist, unequal society
without the Black Power move

ologist added.
