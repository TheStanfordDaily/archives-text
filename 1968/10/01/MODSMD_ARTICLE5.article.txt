# Eating Club Formed
## Encina Commons Closes; Meals Shifted 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Encina Commons, after con
sistently losing money last year,
has been closed, and the gradu
ate students from Crothers and
Crothers Memorial Halls who
used it were left temporarily in
the lurch.
Solutions to the eating prob
lems for the law (Crothers) and
science and engineering (Cro
thers Memorial) students have
been found, but only after much
discussion and planning with the
Business and Dean of Students
offices.
As before, students in both
residences can become members
of most of the Eating Clubs,
with fu'l or partial board.
But because of the closing of
Encina, a new club has been
started specifically for law stu
dents living in Crothers. It is lo
cated in the Eating Club L,
where the recreation room was.
Questionnaire Sent
Crothers Memorial residents
were sent a questionnaire dur
ing last spring quarter offering

them various alternatives with
probable prices, to determine
what plans should be organized
this year.
The students were told there
would be a price increase over
last year no matter what course
of action was taken. The new
costs quoted, however, were lit
tle above those of 1967-1968.
But when the plan was re
leased, the alternatives open to
the Cro Mem residents had been
drastically decreased and the
prices upped still further.
Kat In Other Houses
The set-up submitted to the
students last week had them
eating in various other dormi
tories around the school — the
eight Wilbur houses, four houses
in Stern, and four in Florence
Moore.
The alternatives now offered
are three meals a day, for either
five or seven days a week; lunch
and dinner five days a week; or
breakfast and dinner five days a
week.
Previously, Encina allowed the

Cro Mom residents to buy meal
tickets for any one meal or any
combination for six days a
week, with no meals served on
Sunday.
The students, led by RA Jeff
Thomas and Joe Geek, didn't
mind the decrease in choices,
but were somewhat dismayed at
the increased prices.
Pr?ees Increased
For example, all three meals
cost $169 a quarter at Encina.
The questionnaire promised an
increase to around $180. But the
price originally quoted this year
was $195.
"They cut down the alterna
tives and cut out the most popu
lar plan, dinner only," Thomas
said. "A lot of engineering stu
dents in McFarland and Hulmo
houses used to take part in that
plan, too."
They were willing to accepl
the fewer choices, Thomas and
Geek said, because they wanted
"to see the integration of the
grad students with the under
grads."

But, after discussions with Ed
Scoles of the Business Office and
Sally Mahoney of the Dean of
Students Office, last year, they
didn't expect the prices promul
gated this fall.
Therefore Thomas and Geek
met with William Myers, direc
tor of the food service, last Fri
day to discuss the difficulty. My
ers noted the prices quoted were
based solely on cost. But the
students felt they should not
have to pay so much, being the
only residence without eating
facilities, and being inconveni
enced by the distance they must
go to meals.
Myers agreed, and increased
the alternatives to their present
level, and dropped the prices
into line with those quoted to
the students in last spring's
questionnaire.
Thomas said he "received
good cooperation" from the food
service, and feels that finally
evf>ryono is happy with the new
arrangements.

But, after discussions with Ed
Scoles of the Business Office and
Sally Mahoney of the Dean of
Students Office, last year, they
didn't expect the prices promul
gated this fall.
Therefore Thomas and Geek
met with William Myers, direc
tor of the food service, last Fri
day to discuss the difficulty. My
ers noted the prices quoted were
based solely on cost. But the
students felt they should not
have to pay so much, being the
only residence without eating
facilities, and being inconveni
enced by the distance they must
go to meals.
Myers agreed, and increased
the alternatives to their present
level, and dropped the prices
into line with those quoted to
the students in last spring's
questionnaire.
Thomas said he "received
good cooperation" from the food
service, and feels that finally
evf>ryono is happy with the new
arrangements.
Encina Commons, after con
sistently losing money last year,
has been closed, and the gradu
ate students from Crothers and
Crothers Memorial Halls who
used it were left temporarily in
the lurch.
Solutions to the eating prob
lems for the law (Crothers) and
science and engineering (Cro
thers Memorial) students have
been found, but only after much
discussion and planning with the
Business and Dean of Students
offices.
As before, students in both
residences can become members
of most of the Eating Clubs,
with fu'l or partial board.
But because of the closing of
Encina, a new club has been
started specifically for law stu
dents living in Crothers. It is lo
cated in the Eating Club L,
where the recreation room was.
Questionnaire Sent
Crothers Memorial residents
were sent a questionnaire dur
ing last spring quarter offering

them various alternatives with
probable prices, to determine
what plans should be organized
this year.
The students were told there
would be a price increase over
last year no matter what course
of action was taken. The new
costs quoted, however, were lit
tle above those of 1967-1968.
But when the plan was re
leased, the alternatives open to
the Cro Mem residents had been
drastically decreased and the
prices upped still further.
Kat In Other Houses
The set-up submitted to the
students last week had them
eating in various other dormi
tories around the school — the
eight Wilbur houses, four houses
in Stern, and four in Florence
Moore.
The alternatives now offered
are three meals a day, for either
five or seven days a week; lunch
and dinner five days a week; or
breakfast and dinner five days a
week.
Previously, Encina allowed the

Cro Mom residents to buy meal
tickets for any one meal or any
combination for six days a
week, with no meals served on
Sunday.
The students, led by RA Jeff
Thomas and Joe Geek, didn't
mind the decrease in choices,
but were somewhat dismayed at
the increased prices.
Pr?ees Increased
For example, all three meals
cost $169 a quarter at Encina.
The questionnaire promised an
increase to around $180. But the
price originally quoted this year
was $195.
"They cut down the alterna
tives and cut out the most popu
lar plan, dinner only," Thomas
said. "A lot of engineering stu
dents in McFarland and Hulmo
houses used to take part in that
plan, too."
They were willing to accepl
the fewer choices, Thomas and
Geek said, because they wanted
"to see the integration of the
grad students with the under
grads."

Scoles of the Business Office and
