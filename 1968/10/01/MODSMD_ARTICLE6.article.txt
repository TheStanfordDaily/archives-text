## Sophs Change Views 
### CRAIG GRANET BILL SMART 
"Nothing shocks me any
more." This statement by
Wendy Cole of Muir House typi
fies the revised attitude of many
sophomores. During the last
week, a number of these return
ing students were asked how
their values and goals had been
altered by the freshman year at
Stanford.
Miss Cole went on to say, "I
think that I'm more willing to
listen to other people now." This
liberalized viewpoint was evi
dent among a majority of the
students questioned. J. Lee
Johnson of Chi Psi thought that
he had become more open-mind
ed: "Before. I was intolerant of
all radicals; now, I'm willing to

listen to see what they have to
say."
Sit-In Affects Views
Last year's sit-in brought com
ments from the sophomore
class. Josh of Otero
House stated, "I'm slightly more
radical than I was before. For
example, I've changed my mind
about last year's sit-in."
A sophomore from Toyon Hall
added, "During the demonstra
tions last year, I listened to both
sides and I saw that both sides
had viable arguments."
Ken Eklund of Muir rein
forced the liberalizing trend: "I
question things more often than
I used to; I've had some of my
doubts converted into beliefs."
Jerry Hontas of Delta Kappa
Epsilon added, "This experience
really liberalized me. I think I
speak for many sophomores
when I say this."
Conservatism Voiced
Conservatism also had its
voice among the students inter
viewed. David Frank of Toyon
lashed out against radicalism.
He said that some uncertain
freshmen were easily swayed by
the radical element of campus
as well as by the so-called "ob
jective" required readings.
Frank added, "I've become more
intolerant since I've been here.
People don't give the system a
chance; they are too easily in
fluenced by radicals."
Norm Cross of Serra House,
who feels he was disenchanted
with mid lie-class morality and
ready to accept certain radical
ideas at Stanford, slid, "I really
can t accept much of the radical
ism 'icre because it is disruptive
and ultimately doesn't accom
plish anything."
No matter what their political
or id ologicl differences, most
agreed that they
had undergone a type of meta
morphosis in their attitude to
ward other students.
Jane Mulder of Serra thought
that she had "become more in-
in academic
side of life." Miss Mulder attrib
uted this to living away from
home with mmy different peo
ple. She mentioned that college
life "brings you into contact
with different kinds of people

and forces you to become less
closed to new ideas."
Rruce Evans of Muir thought
that the most outstanding part
of the whole year was "meeting
people and their ideas, and out
of those, trying to find some
thing that I could defend as my
own opinions."
Bill Cooper of Otero stated,
"For myself, it was human
change. I'm more open, more
personal now."
Another Serra resident said
that she was "impressed by the
variety and openness of many
people at Stanford. I appreci
ated my residence situation
where I got to know people of
all four classes. I realized how
restricted my point of view had
been."
Some Felt Unchanged
Some sophomores thought
that they were unaffected by the
freshman year at Stanford.
Richard Boren of Burbank
House stated, "My values have
n't changed; perhaps I have a
new awareness or feeling for
those values."
A sophomore from Grove
House said, "I brought an ade
quate system of values with me
from high school. Until now, my
experiences at Stanford have re
affirmed those values." Rich
Carp of Otero basically agreed:
"My values have not changed a
great deal. I might be slightly
more radical, but not significant
ly enough to matter."
Thus, the majority of sopho
mores interviewed felt that their
lives had been considerably
changed by the freshman year
at Stanford. Almost everyone
questioned thought that they
had learned more from their
associations with other people
than from the various course
curricula.
Some of the students thought,
however, that the ideas of their
would not have been
meaningful if they had not
taken certain courses. Judging
by the experiences of their
predecessors, this year's fresh
men may expect a considerable
change in both their personal
and political attitudes, so that
indeed, nothing will shock them
anymore.

Carp of Otero basically agreed:
"My values have not changed a
great deal. I might be slightly
more radical, but not significant
ly enough to matter."
Thus, the majority of sopho
mores interviewed felt that their
lives had been considerably
changed by the freshman year
at Stanford. Almost everyone
questioned thought that they
had learned more from their
associations with other people
than from the various course
curricula.
Some of the students thought,
however, that the ideas of their
would not have been
meaningful if they had not
taken certain courses. Judging
by the experiences of their
predecessors, this year's fresh
men may expect a considerable
change in both their personal
and political attitudes, so that
indeed, nothing will shock them
anymore.


WENDY COLE Ls shock-proof


JOSH COOPERMAN is more radical
"Nothing shocks me any
more." This statement by
Wendy Cole of Muir House typi
fies the revised attitude of many
sophomores. During the last
week, a number of these return
ing students were asked how
their values and goals had been
altered by the freshman year at
Stanford.
Miss Cole went on to say, "I
think that I'm more willing to
listen to other people now." This
liberalized viewpoint was evi
dent among a majority of the
students questioned. J. Lee
Johnson of Chi Psi thought that
he had become more open-mind
ed: "Before. I was intolerant of
all radicals; now, I'm willing to

listen to see what they have to
say."
Sit-In Affects Views
Last year's sit-in brought com
ments from the sophomore
class. Josh of Otero
House stated, "I'm slightly more
radical than I was before. For
example, I've changed my mind
about last year's sit-in."
A sophomore from Toyon Hall
added, "During the demonstra
tions last year, I listened to both
sides and I saw that both sides
had viable arguments."
Ken Eklund of Muir rein
forced the liberalizing trend: "I
question things more often than
I used to; I've had some of my
doubts converted into beliefs."
Jerry Hontas of Delta Kappa
Epsilon added, "This experience
really liberalized me. I think I
speak for many sophomores
when I say this."
Conservatism Voiced
Conservatism also had its
voice among the students inter
viewed. David Frank of Toyon
lashed out against radicalism.
He said that some uncertain
freshmen were easily swayed by
the radical element of campus
as well as by the so-called "ob
jective" required readings.
Frank added, "I've become more
intolerant since I've been here.
People don't give the system a
chance; they are too easily in
fluenced by radicals."
Norm Cross of Serra House,
who feels he was disenchanted
with mid lie-class morality and
ready to accept certain radical
ideas at Stanford, slid, "I really
can t accept much of the radical
ism 'icre because it is disruptive
and ultimately doesn't accom
plish anything."
No matter what their political
or id ologicl differences, most
agreed that they
had undergone a type of meta
morphosis in their attitude to
ward other students.
Jane Mulder of Serra thought
that she had "become more in-
in academic
side of life." Miss Mulder attrib
uted this to living away from
home with mmy different peo
ple. She mentioned that college
life "brings you into contact
with different kinds of people

and forces you to become less
closed to new ideas."
Rruce Evans of Muir thought
that the most outstanding part
of the whole year was "meeting
people and their ideas, and out
of those, trying to find some
thing that I could defend as my
own opinions."
Bill Cooper of Otero stated,
"For myself, it was human
change. I'm more open, more
personal now."
Another Serra resident said
that she was "impressed by the
variety and openness of many
people at Stanford. I appreci
ated my residence situation
where I got to know people of
all four classes. I realized how
restricted my point of view had
been."
Some Felt Unchanged
Some sophomores thought
that they were unaffected by the
freshman year at Stanford.
Richard Boren of Burbank
House stated, "My values have
n't changed; perhaps I have a
new awareness or feeling for
those values."
A sophomore from Grove
House said, "I brought an ade
quate system of values with me
from high school. Until now, my
experiences at Stanford have re
affirmed those values." Rich
Carp of Otero basically agreed:
"My values have not changed a
great deal. I might be slightly
more radical, but not significant
ly enough to matter."

"For myself, it was human
change. I'm more open, more
personal now."
Another Serra resident said
that she was "impressed by the
variety and openness of many
people at Stanford. I appreci
ated my residence situation
where I got to know people of
all four classes. I realized how
restricted my point of view had
been."
Some Felt Unchanged
Some sophomores thought
that they were unaffected by the
freshman year at Stanford.
Richard Boren of Burbank
House stated, "My values have
n't changed; perhaps I have a
new awareness or feeling for
those values."
A sophomore from Grove
House said, "I brought an ade
quate system of values with me
from high school. Until now, my
experiences at Stanford have re
affirmed those values." Rich
Carp of Otero basically agreed:
"My values have not changed a
great deal. I might be slightly
more radical, but not significant
ly enough to matter."
Thus, the majority of sopho
mores interviewed felt that their
lives had been considerably
changed by the freshman year
at Stanford. Almost everyone
questioned thought that they
had learned more from their
associations with other people
than from the various course
curricula.
Some of the students thought,
however, that the ideas of their
would not have been
meaningful if they had not
taken certain courses. Judging
by the experiences of their
predecessors, this year's fresh
men may expect a considerable
change in both their personal
and political attitudes, so that
indeed, nothing will shock them
anymore.


WENDY COLE Ls shock-proof


JOSH COOPERMAN is more radical
"Nothing shocks me any
more." This statement by
Wendy Cole of Muir House typi
fies the revised attitude of many
sophomores. During the last
week, a number of these return
ing students were asked how
their values and goals had been
altered by the freshman year at
Stanford.
Miss Cole went on to say, "I
think that I'm more willing to
listen to other people now." This
liberalized viewpoint was evi
dent among a majority of the
students questioned. J. Lee
Johnson of Chi Psi thought that
he had become more open-mind
ed: "Before. I was intolerant of
all radicals; now, I'm willing to

listen to see what they have to
say."
Sit-In Affects Views
Last year's sit-in brought com
ments from the sophomore
class. Josh of Otero
House stated, "I'm slightly more
radical than I was before. For
example, I've changed my mind
about last year's sit-in."
A sophomore from Toyon Hall
added, "During the demonstra
tions last year, I listened to both
sides and I saw that both sides
had viable arguments."
Ken Eklund of Muir rein
forced the liberalizing trend: "I
question things more often than
I used to; I've had some of my
doubts converted into beliefs."
Jerry Hontas of Delta Kappa
Epsilon added, "This experience
really liberalized me. I think I
speak for many sophomores
when I say this."
Conservatism Voiced
Conservatism also had its
voice among the students inter
viewed. David Frank of Toyon
lashed out against radicalism.
He said that some uncertain
freshmen were easily swayed by
the radical element of campus
as well as by the so-called "ob
jective" required readings.
Frank added, "I've become more
intolerant since I've been here.
People don't give the system a
chance; they are too easily in
fluenced by radicals."
Norm Cross of Serra House,
who feels he was disenchanted
with mid lie-class morality and
ready to accept certain radical
ideas at Stanford, slid, "I really
can t accept much of the radical
ism 'icre because it is disruptive
and ultimately doesn't accom
plish anything."
No matter what their political
or id ologicl differences, most
agreed that they
had undergone a type of meta
morphosis in their attitude to
ward other students.
Jane Mulder of Serra thought
that she had "become more in-
in academic
side of life." Miss Mulder attrib
uted this to living away from
home with mmy different peo
ple. She mentioned that college
life "brings you into contact
with different kinds of people

and forces you to become less
closed to new ideas."
Rruce Evans of Muir thought
that the most outstanding part
of the whole year was "meeting
people and their ideas, and out
of those, trying to find some
thing that I could defend as my
own opinions."
Bill Cooper of Otero stated,
"For myself, it was human
change. I'm more open, more
personal now."
Another Serra resident said
that she was "impressed by the
variety and openness of many
people at Stanford. I appreci
ated my residence situation
where I got to know people of
all four classes. I realized how
restricted my point of view had
