# Melville Defends Latin Revolution
## 
### 
An ex-Catholic priest claimed
yesterday that the only reason
the United States has placed on
army in Guatemala and through
out Latin America is so that the
people cannot rise to ask for
what is justly theirs.
Art Melville, sponsored by
The Resistance and speaking in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium before a
nearly full house, entered Guate
mala in December 1961 as a
priest of the Maryknoll order.
He was assigned to the state of
Huehuetenango, where he be
came deeply involved in a wide

variety of social reform pro
grams including credit unions,
agricultural cooperatives, local
ly-oriented labor organizations,
medical clinics, literary pro
grams and revolutionary work
for which he was eventually ex
pelled in April of this year.
Melville soon came to the con
clusion that in spite of some of
his programs' success signifi
cant changes could not be made
as long as the ruling oligarchy
maintained a strong grip on the
government.
Priests Join Guerillas
It was at this point that Art
along with his brother Thomas,
also a Maryknoll priest, and
Maryknoll Sister Marina Peter
began preparing to enter a guer
illa organization in the moun
tains of Guatemala. They were
joined by many of the peasants
and students with whom they
had been working.
"As we became more active
it became necessary to move in
small groups to protect our
selves," he said, adding that one
of the teachers in their group, a
boy of 17, was kidnapped and
clubbed to death because he was
not careful one night and went
out alone to gather firewood.
Land Reform Needed
It is in the area of land re
form that Guatemala is in most
need. To meet that need they
elected a democratic government
in 1950. But in 1954, as the im
plementation of such a program
came into boing, the United
Fruit Company, the largest land
owner in Guatemala, began to
feel the pressure and made an
appeal to the United States Gov
ernment.
"It wasn't much 'ater that a
new general was installed as
leader of a dictatorial regime, by
the United States," according to
Melville. "Within three days the
program was overthrown and a
new dictator installed. Several
hun-lred wer 1 killed and the land
was returned to the United Fruit
Company.
In December, 1967, the move
ment was betrayed by a fellow
Maryknoll priest and the Guate
ma'an government quickly ex
pelled the three Maryknollers, at
the request of the U.S. Ambassa
dor John Gordon Mein. Mein has
since been assassinated by ele
ments presumably related to
the Guatemalan Revolutionary
Movement.
"It is said that the United
States has a tradition of back
ing the wrong side. We are doing
it apain. As we are in all of Latin
America. We must change our
foreign policy."

"It is said that the United

An ex-Catholic priest claimed
yesterday that the only reason

Art Melville, sponsored by
The Resistance and speaking in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium before a
nearly full house, entered Guate
mala in December 1961 as a
priest of the Maryknoll order.
He was assigned to the state of
Huehuetenango, where he be
came deeply involved in a wide

variety of social reform pro
grams including credit unions,
agricultural cooperatives, local
ly-oriented labor organizations,
medical clinics, literary pro
grams and revolutionary work
for which he was eventually ex
pelled in April of this year.
Melville soon came to the con
clusion that in spite of some of
his programs' success signifi
cant changes could not be made
as long as the ruling oligarchy
maintained a strong grip on the
government.
Priests Join Guerillas
It was at this point that Art
along with his brother Thomas,
also a Maryknoll priest, and
Maryknoll Sister Marina Peter
began preparing to enter a guer
illa organization in the moun
tains of Guatemala. They were
joined by many of the peasants
and students with whom they
had been working.
"As we became more active
it became necessary to move in
small groups to protect our
selves," he said, adding that one
of the teachers in their group, a
boy of 17, was kidnapped and
clubbed to death because he was
not careful one night and went
out alone to gather firewood.
Land Reform Needed
It is in the area of land re
form that Guatemala is in most
need. To meet that need they
elected a democratic government
in 1950. But in 1954, as the im
plementation of such a program
came into boing, the United
Fruit Company, the largest land
owner in Guatemala, began to
feel the pressure and made an
appeal to the United States Gov
ernment.
"It wasn't much 'ater that a
new general was installed as
leader of a dictatorial regime, by
the United States," according to
Melville. "Within three days the
program was overthrown and a
new dictator installed. Several
