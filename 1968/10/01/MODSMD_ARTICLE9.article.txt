# FACULTY POWER
## 
### 
Recent decisions by the Academic Senate which allow student
participation in their deliberations represent a questionable blend
ing, of faculty prerogative and student power.
Student presentations during last weeks discussion of ROTC
raised important questions about the whole matter of academic
credit and demonstrated the diversity of opinion which exists to
ward military service. We hope that the students named to Senate
Committees will offer the faculty their unique perspectives in
upcoming discussions.
However, the plans to include five students as ex-officio mem
bers of the Senate do not hold such exciting possibilities for fac
ulty-student communication. The action is of questionable ad
vantage to students until the Senate makes clear what its role
will he.
As long as the Faculty Senate continues its policy of closed
meetings, students can only conclude that the faculty has or
ganized a special interest group, concerned with only those mat
ters affecting the faculty. Student members in this case would
prevent serious faculty abuse of students interests, but would be
able to do nothing positive for students.
But as the action of last week indicated, the faculty members
of the Academic Senate have every intention of grappling ivith
a number of issues that are of direct interest to students. And
when the Academic Senate involves itself with matters that af
fect the entire University, one or five students cannot adequately
present the student body's position, any more than the Academic
Senate can consistently speak for the whole faculty.
The Faculty Senate, as a forum that involves itself in issues
of vital importance to Stanford, is not going to win the support of
the student body through five ex-officio members. Nor can the
Senate, as an important deliberative body in the University, hope
to maintain the confidence of students when they are excluded
from the proceedings.
In the current organization of the Academic Senate, students
are beginning to be heard. But until students can hear for them
selves what is being said in the Senate, first-hand or through the
press, the tyranny of secrecy perpetuated by the factdty will con
tinue to reduce much communication to hearsay.
