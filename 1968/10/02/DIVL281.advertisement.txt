Playtex invents the first-day tampon
(We took the inside out
to show you how different it is.)
Outside: it's softer and silky (not cardboardy).
Inside: it's so extra absorbent.. .it even protects on
your first day. Your worst day!
In every lab test against the old cardboardy kind...
the Playtex tampon was always more absorbent.
Actually 45 To more absorbent on the average
than the leading regular tampon.
Because it's different. Actually adjusts to you.
It flowers out. Fluffs out. Designed to protect every
inside inch of you. So the chance of a mishap
is almost zero! _ _ r —.
