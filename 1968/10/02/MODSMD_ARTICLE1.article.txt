# Cleaver: 'We're Living In The Last Go-Round'
## 
### CICELY BATES 
"America the Ugly is the num
ber one obstacle to human prog
ress," Black Panther leader Eld
ridge Cleaver told more than
2000 people last night in and
outside of Memorial Auditorium.
"This country was founded at
the expense of humanity,"
Cleaver added. "But now we are
in the time of the last go-round.
"Now we want peace and free
dom or there will be chaos and
death," warned the 33-year-old
Peace and Freedom Presidential
candidate.
Reaction to Cleaver's moder
ately tempered speech was mild
ly enthusiastic. The audience
gave more support to his digs at
the political establishment than
his calls to support the Panther
program.
"Destruction is on the Hori
zon" he predicted. "Unless sane
white and black people come to
gether and recognize the situa
tion, there will be no alternative
but to take the white people
with us if we have to go," Cleav
er warned.

create room for people to unite
Today everyone is "part of the
solution or part of the problem."
There is no middle ground, he
said.
To get more people off the
middle ground, Cleaver asked
for special help from the fe
males present in the audience.
He suggested that they reserve
their "pussy power" for those
men committed to being part of
the solution and predicted that
their Lysistratan efforts could
be a powerful force.
Cleaver further expressed his
hostility toward people who take
a neutral position. "I don't want
the white man to say 'Good
Luck,' I need his help."
Help is needed to break down
the power structure which is
still trying to divide and con
quer. Through laws its struc
ture is trying to keep down the
Students For A Democratic So
ciety, the Panthers, the hippies
and all those who pose a threat
to the establishment, he de
clared.

Now is the time to break out,
declared Cleaver. "We must
together." Now is the time for
"disassembling the walls of the
ghetto."
Cleaver made special appeals
to white radicals in the audi
ence. "When it comes time for
me to be put back in jail I may
be hiding behind your door," he
said. "I don't want just my door
kicked down but the establish
ment should kick down all doors
if they are going to kick down
my door," declared Cleaver.
Basic Panther Principle
"The basic principle of the
Panthers is that every man,
woman, and child deserves the
best standard of living possible,"
he said. "Anything contradictory
must be removed."
Narrowing down his attack to
specific political leaders, Cleaver
said that the present President
ial candidates only allow "voting
for continuation of policies that
have brought the world to the
edge of disaster." Wallace has
no future even for racists; Nix
on is a "middle-of-the-road pig";
and "Meathead Me-too Humph
rey is a professional pig," con
cluded Cleaver.
A description of California
Governor Ronald Reagan was
fiilled with the "four-letter
words" that were liberally
sprinkled throughout Cleaver's
speech. "Reagan is a negative
domi-god out to corrupt any
process," Cleaver said.
Cleaver then thanked Stan
ford for inviting him to speak
because he stated that the invi
tation was also saying "Fuck
Reagan."
This statement was provoked
by Reagan and the Board of Re
gents' refusal to let Cleaver give
ten lectures for academic credit
at the University of California
at Berkley.
"Reagan freaked out when he
heard that I was to teach. How
ever, I now plan to give not ten,
not one, but I am going to de
liver 20 speeches," Cleaver said
to the cheering audience.
Decentralize Institutions
One of the main parts of the
current Panther program is to
"decentralize institutions of so
ciety," Cleaver said. Specifically,
Cleaver mentioned the police
and the educational systems.
Police are becoming "caste
conscious." "They are behaving
like a military service that is
guarding against barbaric hord
es. The real duty of a policeman
is to shoot the superior officer
when he is told to shoot people,"
emphasized Cleaver.
Cleaver noted that he saw no
police protests over last month's
shooting incident that involved
two policemen shooting at a
Huey Newton poster hung in
the Oakland Panther headquart
ers.

Attacking the.educational sys
tem, Cleaver asked for help to
create black institutions that
would parallel the already estab
lished white institutions. "We
also need institutions to help us
with our environment — an en
vironment of white supremacy
and racism," he said.
But Cleaver is "not content
merely to cope with the environ
ment. He wants to change it.
"We must put the pigs in place
. . . First we slaves, then
separate but equal, and now we
are treated as colonial subjects
in a white man's world," stated
Cleaver.
Now is the time to break
down the colonial walls, the
walls of the ghetto, continued
Cleaver. "Each people should
have the power to control their
own destiny."
Plebiscite For People
Because Cleaver felt that
neither the Panthers nor any or
ganization could really know the
wishes of the Black people,
Cleaver suggested a plebiscite
administered by the United Na
tions giving each black person
the choice of voting for separa
tion from or integration with
the white world. If the separa
tionists drew the biggest vote
then the black people should be
allowed to partition off a por
tion of the United States and
build their own nation, Cleaver
said.
Cleaver als suggested a sec
ond plebiscite. Whites should
also vote on whether they want
an all white nition or a black
and white nation. "Then we will
know which direction to take,"
concluded Cleaver.
Up until now we have had "a
government of, by, and for the
pigs," said Cleaver. But he rec
ommends, "All to the peo
ple, black power to the black
people, and white power to the
white people."
Loophole Left
Even though Cleaver saw sep
aration as a possible alternative
to present problems, he did not
condemn all whites as creators
of the present situation. He de
clared that he always felt open
a loophole for those who do
recognize the situation, for those
who do want to see a future
with freedom and justice to all.
He envisioned a future Utopia
that would be a world-wide state
— a classes and boundaryless
world.
However, present realities
concern Cleaver the most. Now
is the time for the mid to
come forth, he said in wry ref
erence to himself. We must have
freedom or chaos, announced
Cleaver in his final warning.
"All power to the people.
Black power to the black people.
White power to the white peo
ple. You white people have nev
er had any powor. It's always
been pig power," he concluded.

fiilled with the "four-letter
words" that were liberally
sprinkled throughout Cleaver's
speech. "Reagan is a negative
domi-god out to corrupt any
process," Cleaver said.
Cleaver then thanked Stan
ford for inviting him to speak
because he stated that the invi
tation was also saying "Fuck
Reagan."
This statement was provoked
by Reagan and the Board of Re
gents' refusal to let Cleaver give
ten lectures for academic credit
at the University of California
at Berkley.
"Reagan freaked out when he
heard that I was to teach. How
ever, I now plan to give not ten,
not one, but I am going to de
liver 20 speeches," Cleaver said
to the cheering audience.
Decentralize Institutions
One of the main parts of the
current Panther program is to
"decentralize institutions of so
ciety," Cleaver said. Specifically,
Cleaver mentioned the police
and the educational systems.
Police are becoming "caste
conscious." "They are behaving
like a military service that is
guarding against barbaric hord
es. The real duty of a policeman
is to shoot the superior officer
when he is told to shoot people,"
emphasized Cleaver.
Cleaver noted that he saw no
police protests over last month's
shooting incident that involved
two policemen shooting at a
Huey Newton poster hung in
the Oakland Panther headquart
ers.

Attacking the.educational sys
tem, Cleaver asked for help to
create black institutions that
would parallel the already estab
lished white institutions. "We
also need institutions to help us
with our environment — an en
vironment of white supremacy
and racism," he said.
But Cleaver is "not content
merely to cope with the environ
ment. He wants to change it.
"We must put the pigs in place
. . . First we slaves, then
separate but equal, and now we
are treated as colonial subjects
in a white man's world," stated
Cleaver.
Now is the time to break
down the colonial walls, the
walls of the ghetto, continued
Cleaver. "Each people should
have the power to control their
own destiny."
Plebiscite For People
Because Cleaver felt that
neither the Panthers nor any or
ganization could really know the
wishes of the Black people,
Cleaver suggested a plebiscite
administered by the United Na
tions giving each black person
the choice of voting for separa
tion from or integration with
the white world. If the separa
tionists drew the biggest vote
then the black people should be
allowed to partition off a por
tion of the United States and
build their own nation, Cleaver
said.
Cleaver als suggested a sec
ond plebiscite. Whites should
also vote on whether they want
an all white nition or a black
and white nation. "Then we will
know which direction to take,"
concluded Cleaver.
Up until now we have had "a
government of, by, and for the
pigs," said Cleaver. But he rec
ommends, "All to the peo
ple, black power to the black
people, and white power to the
white people."
Loophole Left
Even though Cleaver saw sep
aration as a possible alternative
to present problems, he did not
condemn all whites as creators
of the present situation. He de
clared that he always felt open
a loophole for those who do
recognize the situation, for those
who do want to see a future
with freedom and justice to all.
He envisioned a future Utopia
that would be a world-wide state
— a classes and boundaryless
world.
However, present realities
concern Cleaver the most. Now
is the time for the mid to
come forth, he said in wry ref
erence to himself. We must have
freedom or chaos, announced
Cleaver in his final warning.
"All power to the people.
Black power to the black people.
White power to the white peo
ple. You white people have nev
er had any powor. It's always
been pig power," he concluded.
"America the Ugly is the num
ber one obstacle to human prog
ress," Black Panther leader Eld
ridge Cleaver told more than
2000 people last night in and
outside of Memorial Auditorium.
"This country was founded at
the expense of humanity,"
Cleaver added. "But now we are
in the time of the last go-round.
"Now we want peace and free
dom or there will be chaos and
death," warned the 33-year-old
Peace and Freedom Presidential
candidate.
Reaction to Cleaver's moder
ately tempered speech was mild
ly enthusiastic. The audience
gave more support to his digs at
the political establishment than
his calls to support the Panther
program.
"Destruction is on the Hori
zon" he predicted. "Unless sane
white and black people come to
gether and recognize the situa
tion, there will be no alternative
but to take the white people
with us if we have to go," Cleav
er warned.

create room for people to unite
Today everyone is "part of the
solution or part of the problem."
There is no middle ground, he
said.
To get more people off the
middle ground, Cleaver asked
for special help from the fe
males present in the audience.
He suggested that they reserve
their "pussy power" for those
men committed to being part of
the solution and predicted that
their Lysistratan efforts could
be a powerful force.
Cleaver further expressed his
hostility toward people who take
a neutral position. "I don't want
the white man to say 'Good
Luck,' I need his help."
Help is needed to break down
the power structure which is
still trying to divide and con
quer. Through laws its struc
ture is trying to keep down the
Students For A Democratic So
ciety, the Panthers, the hippies
and all those who pose a threat
to the establishment, he de
clared.

Now is the time to break out,
declared Cleaver. "We must
together." Now is the time for
"disassembling the walls of the
ghetto."
Cleaver made special appeals
to white radicals in the audi
ence. "When it comes time for
me to be put back in jail I may
be hiding behind your door," he
said. "I don't want just my door
kicked down but the establish
ment should kick down all doors
if they are going to kick down
my door," declared Cleaver.
Basic Panther Principle
"The basic principle of the
Panthers is that every man,
woman, and child deserves the
best standard of living possible,"
he said. "Anything contradictory
must be removed."
Narrowing down his attack to
specific political leaders, Cleaver
said that the present President
ial candidates only allow "voting
for continuation of policies that
have brought the world to the
edge of disaster." Wallace has
no future even for racists; Nix
on is a "middle-of-the-road pig";
and "Meathead Me-too Humph
rey is a professional pig," con
cluded Cleaver.

Loophole Left
Even though Cleaver saw sep
aration as a possible alternative
to present problems, he did not
condemn all whites as creators
of the present situation. He de
clared that he always felt open
a loophole for those who do
recognize the situation, for those
who do want to see a future
with freedom and justice to all.
He envisioned a future Utopia
that would be a world-wide state
— a classes and boundaryless
world.
However, present realities
concern Cleaver the most. Now
is the time for the mid to
come forth, he said in wry ref
erence to himself. We must have
freedom or chaos, announced
Cleaver in his final warning.
"All power to the people.
Black power to the black people.
White power to the white peo
ple. You white people have nev
er had any powor. It's always
been pig power," he concluded.
"America the Ugly is the num
ber one obstacle to human prog
ress," Black Panther leader Eld
ridge Cleaver told more than
2000 people last night in and
outside of Memorial Auditorium.
"This country was founded at
the expense of humanity,"
Cleaver added. "But now we are
in the time of the last go-round.
"Now we want peace and free
dom or there will be chaos and
death," warned the 33-year-old
Peace and Freedom Presidential
candidate.
Reaction to Cleaver's moder
ately tempered speech was mild
ly enthusiastic. The audience
gave more support to his digs at
the political establishment than
his calls to support the Panther
program.
"Destruction is on the Hori
zon" he predicted. "Unless sane
white and black people come to
gether and recognize the situa
tion, there will be no alternative
but to take the white people
with us if we have to go," Cleav
er warned.

create room for people to unite
Today everyone is "part of the
solution or part of the problem."
There is no middle ground, he
said.
To get more people off the
middle ground, Cleaver asked
for special help from the fe
males present in the audience.
He suggested that they reserve
their "pussy power" for those
men committed to being part of
the solution and predicted that
their Lysistratan efforts could
be a powerful force.
Cleaver further expressed his
hostility toward people who take
a neutral position. "I don't want
the white man to say 'Good
Luck,' I need his help."
Help is needed to break down
the power structure which is
still trying to divide and con
quer. Through laws its struc
ture is trying to keep down the
Students For A Democratic So
ciety, the Panthers, the hippies
and all those who pose a threat
to the establishment, he de
clared.

Now is the time to break out,
declared Cleaver. "We must
together." Now is the time for
"disassembling the walls of the
ghetto."
Cleaver made special appeals
to white radicals in the audi
ence. "When it comes time for
me to be put back in jail I may
be hiding behind your door," he
said. "I don't want just my door
kicked down but the establish
ment should kick down all doors
if they are going to kick down
my door," declared Cleaver.
Basic Panther Principle
"The basic principle of the
Panthers is that every man,
woman, and child deserves the
best standard of living possible,"
he said. "Anything contradictory
must be removed."
Narrowing down his attack to
specific political leaders, Cleaver
said that the present President
ial candidates only allow "voting
for continuation of policies that
have brought the world to the
edge of disaster." Wallace has
no future even for racists; Nix
on is a "middle-of-the-road pig";
and "Meathead Me-too Humph
rey is a professional pig," con
cluded Cleaver.
A description of California
Governor Ronald Reagan was
fiilled with the "four-letter
words" that were liberally
sprinkled throughout Cleaver's
speech. "Reagan is a negative
domi-god out to corrupt any
process," Cleaver said.
Cleaver then thanked Stan
ford for inviting him to speak
because he stated that the invi
tation was also saying "Fuck
Reagan."
This statement was provoked
by Reagan and the Board of Re
gents' refusal to let Cleaver give
ten lectures for academic credit
at the University of California
at Berkley.
"Reagan freaked out when he
heard that I was to teach. How
ever, I now plan to give not ten,
not one, but I am going to de
liver 20 speeches," Cleaver said
to the cheering audience.
Decentralize Institutions
One of the main parts of the
current Panther program is to
"decentralize institutions of so
ciety," Cleaver said. Specifically,
Cleaver mentioned the police
and the educational systems.
Police are becoming "caste
conscious." "They are behaving
like a military service that is
guarding against barbaric hord
es. The real duty of a policeman
is to shoot the superior officer
when he is told to shoot people,"
emphasized Cleaver.
Cleaver noted that he saw no
police protests over last month's
shooting incident that involved
two policemen shooting at a
Huey Newton poster hung in
the Oakland Panther headquart
ers.

Attacking the.educational sys
tem, Cleaver asked for help to
create black institutions that
would parallel the already estab
lished white institutions. "We
also need institutions to help us
with our environment — an en
vironment of white supremacy
and racism," he said.
But Cleaver is "not content
merely to cope with the environ
ment. He wants to change it.
"We must put the pigs in place
. . . First we slaves, then
separate but equal, and now we
are treated as colonial subjects
in a white man's world," stated
Cleaver.
Now is the time to break
down the colonial walls, the
walls of the ghetto, continued
Cleaver. "Each people should
have the power to control their
own destiny."
Plebiscite For People
Because Cleaver felt that
neither the Panthers nor any or
ganization could really know the
wishes of the Black people,
Cleaver suggested a plebiscite
administered by the United Na
tions giving each black person
the choice of voting for separa
tion from or integration with
the white world. If the separa
tionists drew the biggest vote
then the black people should be
allowed to partition off a por
tion of the United States and
build their own nation, Cleaver
said.
Cleaver als suggested a sec
ond plebiscite. Whites should
also vote on whether they want
an all white nition or a black
and white nation. "Then we will
know which direction to take,"
concluded Cleaver.
Up until now we have had "a
government of, by, and for the
pigs," said Cleaver. But he rec
ommends, "All to the peo
ple, black power to the black
people, and white power to the
white people."

Even though Cleaver saw sep

be hiding behind your door," he
said. "I don't want just my door
kicked down but the establish
ment should kick down all doors
if they are going to kick down
my door," declared Cleaver.
Basic Panther Principle
"The basic principle of the
Panthers is that every man,
woman, and child deserves the
best standard of living possible,"
he said. "Anything contradictory
must be removed."
Narrowing down his attack to
specific political leaders, Cleaver
said that the present President
ial candidates only allow "voting
for continuation of policies that
have brought the world to the
edge of disaster." Wallace has
no future even for racists; Nix
on is a "middle-of-the-road pig";
and "Meathead Me-too Humph
rey is a professional pig," con
cluded Cleaver.
A description of California
Governor Ronald Reagan was
fiilled with the "four-letter
words" that were liberally
sprinkled throughout Cleaver's
speech. "Reagan is a negative
domi-god out to corrupt any
process," Cleaver said.
Cleaver then thanked Stan
ford for inviting him to speak
because he stated that the invi
tation was also saying "Fuck
Reagan."
This statement was provoked
by Reagan and the Board of Re
gents' refusal to let Cleaver give
ten lectures for academic credit
at the University of California
at Berkley.
"Reagan freaked out when he
heard that I was to teach. How
ever, I now plan to give not ten,
not one, but I am going to de
liver 20 speeches," Cleaver said
to the cheering audience.
Decentralize Institutions
One of the main parts of the
current Panther program is to
"decentralize institutions of so
ciety," Cleaver said. Specifically,
Cleaver mentioned the police
and the educational systems.
Police are becoming "caste
conscious." "They are behaving
like a military service that is
guarding against barbaric hord
es. The real duty of a policeman
is to shoot the superior officer
when he is told to shoot people,"
emphasized Cleaver.
Cleaver noted that he saw no
police protests over last month's
shooting incident that involved
two policemen shooting at a
Huey Newton poster hung in
the Oakland Panther headquart
ers.

Attacking the.educational sys
tem, Cleaver asked for help to
create black institutions that
would parallel the already estab
lished white institutions. "We
also need institutions to help us
with our environment — an en
vironment of white supremacy
and racism," he said.
But Cleaver is "not content
merely to cope with the environ
ment. He wants to change it.
"We must put the pigs in place
. . . First we slaves, then
separate but equal, and now we
are treated as colonial subjects
in a white man's world," stated
Cleaver.
Now is the time to break
down the colonial walls, the
walls of the ghetto, continued
Cleaver. "Each people should
have the power to control their
own destiny."
Plebiscite For People
Because Cleaver felt that
neither the Panthers nor any or
ganization could really know the
wishes of the Black people,
Cleaver suggested a plebiscite
administered by the United Na
tions giving each black person
the choice of voting for separa
tion from or integration with
the white world. If the separa
tionists drew the biggest vote
then the black people should be
allowed to partition off a por
tion of the United States and
build their own nation, Cleaver
said.
Cleaver als suggested a sec
ond plebiscite. Whites should
also vote on whether they want
an all white nition or a black
and white nation. "Then we will
know which direction to take,"
concluded Cleaver.
Up until now we have had "a
government of, by, and for the
pigs," said Cleaver. But he rec
ommends, "All to the peo
ple, black power to the black
people, and white power to the
white people."
Loophole Left
Even though Cleaver saw sep
aration as a possible alternative
to present problems, he did not
condemn all whites as creators
of the present situation. He de
clared that he always felt open
a loophole for those who do
recognize the situation, for those
who do want to see a future
with freedom and justice to all.
He envisioned a future Utopia
that would be a world-wide state
— a classes and boundaryless
world.
However, present realities
concern Cleaver the most. Now
is the time for the mid to
come forth, he said in wry ref
erence to himself. We must have
freedom or chaos, announced
Cleaver in his final warning.
"All power to the people.
Black power to the black people.
White power to the white peo
ple. You white people have nev
er had any powor. It's always
been pig power," he concluded.
"America the Ugly is the num
ber one obstacle to human prog
ress," Black Panther leader Eld
ridge Cleaver told more than
2000 people last night in and
outside of Memorial Auditorium.
"This country was founded at
the expense of humanity,"
Cleaver added. "But now we are
in the time of the last go-round.
"Now we want peace and free
dom or there will be chaos and
death," warned the 33-year-old
Peace and Freedom Presidential
candidate.
Reaction to Cleaver's moder
ately tempered speech was mild
ly enthusiastic. The audience
gave more support to his digs at
the political establishment than
his calls to support the Panther
program.
"Destruction is on the Hori
zon" he predicted. "Unless sane
white and black people come to
gether and recognize the situa
tion, there will be no alternative
but to take the white people
with us if we have to go," Cleav
er warned.

create room for people to unite
Today everyone is "part of the
solution or part of the problem."
There is no middle ground, he
said.
To get more people off the
middle ground, Cleaver asked
for special help from the fe
males present in the audience.
He suggested that they reserve
their "pussy power" for those
men committed to being part of
the solution and predicted that
their Lysistratan efforts could
be a powerful force.
Cleaver further expressed his
hostility toward people who take
a neutral position. "I don't want
the white man to say 'Good
Luck,' I need his help."
Help is needed to break down
the power structure which is
still trying to divide and con
quer. Through laws its struc
ture is trying to keep down the
Students For A Democratic So
ciety, the Panthers, the hippies
and all those who pose a threat
to the establishment, he de
clared.

Now is the time to break out,
declared Cleaver. "We must
together." Now is the time for
"disassembling the walls of the
ghetto."
Cleaver made special appeals
to white radicals in the audi
ence. "When it comes time for
me to be put back in jail I may
be hiding behind your door," he
said. "I don't want just my door
kicked down but the establish
ment should kick down all doors
if they are going to kick down
my door," declared Cleaver.
