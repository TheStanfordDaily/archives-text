Washington
Sept. 29, 1968
Dear Drew,
I was feeling rather blue yes
terday, but your wedding cheer
ed me up.
Your friends were wonderful.
They made me feel young again.
They also made me feel that the
world will be a lot better and
safer place to live in when they
and theirs take over. The only
question is whether the world
can wait long enough for them
to do so. Will the world survive
all the mistakes the older gen
eration is making today?
These mistakes were what
made me blue yesterday morn
ing.
I had been away, and came
back to learn how the Senate
and House conferees had ham
strung the Health, Education,
and Welfare department so the
federal government cannot en
force school integration by
withholding funds.
This, of course, is exactly
what George Wallace of Ala
bama is proposing and what
Nixon, without any fanfare, also
favors. Undoubtedly Republican
members of the House-Senate
conference were following his
lead.
But their vote — if it stands
— will set back integration 50
years. It will present more prob
lems for you to unravel when
your generation takes over the
leadership of the USA.
It has now been 12 years since
the Supreme Court's school de
segregation decree and still the
schools in many parts of the na
tion remain segregated. One girl
who was at your wedding was
telling me about an exception,
namely her school, Western Se
nior High in Georgetown, which
has been so long integrated that
the students don't pay any atten
tion to race at all. The student
body is about two-thirds Negro,
and over half the teachers are
Negro. They are good teachers,
she says, and don't let the stu

dents get away with any monkey
business.
This is because Western High
integrated 12 years ago, imme
diately after the Supreme Court
decree, and the students have
grown up together. Incidentally,
Western High has one of the
higher scholastic ratings of the
District of Columbia.
The other news that discour
aged me was the vote of the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Commit
tee to postpone consideration of
the treaty to stop the spread of
nuclear weapons. This had been
signed after months of negotia
tion between the United States
and Russia and more months
persuading other nations to sign
it too. None of this was easy.
Now it looks as if all this hard
won work toward peace will

gradually be frittered away.
It is true that everyone is
down on the Russians now. But
you have to give the peace clique
inside the Kremlin some encour
agement, an argument to use
against the military clique; not
cut the ground out from under
them by retreating from a treaty
that is a milestone in the march
toward peace.
Again Republicans on the For
eign Relations Committee took
their cue from Nixon, who had
urged no action on the non-pro
liferation pact. This may be a

portent of things to come. Nix
on's main policy may be to turn
back the clock.
However, I don't believe this
nation can turn back the clock
without a Negro guerrilla war in
big cities and with disastrous
student strikes in our big uni
versities. Despite George Wal
lace, you can't put several mil
lion Negroes in jail or behind
barbed wire stockades.
And you can't jail the thous
ands of youngsters who demon
strate for peace. 1 You have to

learn to work with them and edu
cate them and meet such de
mands as are reasonable. If we
don't do this, if once again we
let probloms accumulate, we're
going to leave a terribly messed
up wor d for you to handle. In
fact, might not be any
world left for you to handle.
Well, I didn't mean to preach
a sermon on the occasion of your
wedding. I just wanted to tell
you that your young guests at
the wedding set me thinking.
Love from
Your Grandfather
