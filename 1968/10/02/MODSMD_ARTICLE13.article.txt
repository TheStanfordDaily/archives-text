"This," said the sailor in his
grimy blue dungarees, "is the
most screwed-up ship in the
Coast Guard."
He rested his hand on the rail
as the 180-foot vessel swayed
gently under his feet, oblivious
to his mocking insults. The La
mar was much too humble a
ship to resent the abuse of even
a 19-year-old seaman.
"That's the only gun we've
got," the sailor told a giggling
cluster of tourists as he aimed
his finger at a stark muzzle
aimed toward the bow. "We even
fired it once last month just to
see if it still works. They don't
make three-inchers like this one
anymore. It's good they don't
too, because it's more dangerous
shooting this thing than it is
being shot at with it. The safest
place to be is the target—it
never comes close."
His audience laughed. The sun
glinted on the dulled brass levers
of the gun. The wind ruffled the
faded canvas gun cover.
The sailor lapsed into a mock
official tone as he continued his
monologue. "The Lamar was
built in 1944 as a patrol boat. In
1952 the Navy stripped her of
>all its guns except one and sold
her to the Coast Guard for $1 to
be used as a Naval Reserve
Training Vessel. The crew chips
paint all day. Sometimes we
take her down the coast to San
Diego and get seasick."
The cold clear water of the

harbor was ruffled by white
caps.
"I've been in for five months.
I get discharged in ten days and
I'm going home, maybe back to
the University of Oregon."
He clambered up a ladder to
the bridge of the tinker-toy gun
boat, with his visitors in tow.
They emerged on a spacious
platform with a fine, unobstruct
ed view of the harbor.
"The officers stand up here
and shout down this tube for
the helmsman to stear over here
or over there. These are their
chairs, and these are their hand
holds, and these are their hel
mets," the sailor said with a
smirk as he held up a stack of
metal hats covered with gray
paint.
"And over there," he said,
pointing astern, "is the officers'
TV antenna. They sit in the
wardroom all day &nd watch
television. Enlisted men don't
get to watch television."
The sailor started up the lad
dor to the crow's nest. "Half my
watch is up there just sitting,"
he told the enraptured group.
"It's the only place where I
don't get seasick."
He dropped gracefully down
the ladder and looked at his
visitors. "Any questions?"
"What is this ship for?"
"For guys like me to serve
their five months reserve duty
and keep out of the draft."
"Where do you sail to?"
The sailor pulled his cap down
over his face and said confiden
tially: "We got out to fish. The
captain—he's got a house on
shore here with a 21 year old
wife and two kids—tells us to
cruise out to Santa Cruz and we
anchor. The officers fish."
"But we know how to have a
good time. Two nights ago some
guy brought some peppermint
cured grass on board and we
got stoned."
A seagull arched over the can
vas awning of the bridge and
ejected a stream of white dung.

"But the Lamar docs more
than train reservists to chip
paint and be the officer's fishing
boat. It is a sea rescue craft,"
the seaman said portentiously.
"Have you rescued anybody?"
a visitor asked on cue.
"We went out last month in a
gale on patrol and took a wave
over the side and would have
sunk if we hadn't given the
pumps an overhaul the day be
fore. But besides rescue duty,
the good ship Lamar is assigned
to coastal defense duty in case
of national emergency."
"Would you put up a good
fight?" asked a visitor.
"Sir," answer the sailor with
a stiffened back, "if anybody
shot at the Lamar, we'd all jump
overboard."
"This," said the sailor in his
grimy blue dungarees, "is the
most screwed-up ship in the
Coast Guard."

"The officers stand up here
and shout down this tube for
the helmsman to stear over here
or over there. These are their
chairs, and these are their hand
holds, and these are their hel
mets," the sailor said with a
smirk as he held up a stack of
metal hats covered with gray
paint.
"And over there," he said,
pointing astern, "is the officers'
TV antenna. They sit in the
wardroom all day &nd watch
television. Enlisted men don't
get to watch television."
The sailor started up the lad
dor to the crow's nest. "Half my
watch is up there just sitting,"
he told the enraptured group.
"It's the only place where I
don't get seasick."
He dropped gracefully down
the ladder and looked at his
visitors. "Any questions?"
"What is this ship for?"
"For guys like me to serve
their five months reserve duty
and keep out of the draft."
"Where do you sail to?"
The sailor pulled his cap down
over his face and said confiden
tially: "We got out to fish. The
captain—he's got a house on
shore here with a 21 year old
wife and two kids—tells us to
cruise out to Santa Cruz and we
anchor. The officers fish."
"But we know how to have a
good time. Two nights ago some
guy brought some peppermint
cured grass on board and we
got stoned."
A seagull arched over the can
vas awning of the bridge and
ejected a stream of white dung.

"But the Lamar docs more
than train reservists to chip
paint and be the officer's fishing
boat. It is a sea rescue craft,"
the seaman said portentiously.
"Have you rescued anybody?"
a visitor asked on cue.
"We went out last month in a
gale on patrol and took a wave
over the side and would have
sunk if we hadn't given the
pumps an overhaul the day be
fore. But besides rescue duty,
the good ship Lamar is assigned
to coastal defense duty in case
of national emergency."
"Would you put up a good
fight?" asked a visitor.
"Sir," answer the sailor with
a stiffened back, "if anybody
shot at the Lamar, we'd all jump
overboard."
"This," said the sailor in his
grimy blue dungarees, "is the
most screwed-up ship in the
Coast Guard."
He rested his hand on the rail
as the 180-foot vessel swayed
gently under his feet, oblivious
to his mocking insults. The La
mar was much too humble a
ship to resent the abuse of even
a 19-year-old seaman.
"That's the only gun we've
got," the sailor told a giggling
cluster of tourists as he aimed
his finger at a stark muzzle
aimed toward the bow. "We even
fired it once last month just to
see if it still works. They don't
make three-inchers like this one
anymore. It's good they don't
too, because it's more dangerous
shooting this thing than it is
being shot at with it. The safest
place to be is the target—it
never comes close."
His audience laughed. The sun
glinted on the dulled brass levers
of the gun. The wind ruffled the
faded canvas gun cover.
The sailor lapsed into a mock
official tone as he continued his
monologue. "The Lamar was
built in 1944 as a patrol boat. In
1952 the Navy stripped her of
>all its guns except one and sold
her to the Coast Guard for $1 to
be used as a Naval Reserve
Training Vessel. The crew chips
paint all day. Sometimes we
take her down the coast to San
Diego and get seasick."
The cold clear water of the

harbor was ruffled by white
caps.
"I've been in for five months.
I get discharged in ten days and
I'm going home, maybe back to
the University of Oregon."
He clambered up a ladder to
the bridge of the tinker-toy gun
boat, with his visitors in tow.
They emerged on a spacious
platform with a fine, unobstruct
ed view of the harbor.
"The officers stand up here
