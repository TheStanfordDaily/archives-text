# Heated Debate
## SDS Divided Over Tactics 
### DAVID LISCHINSKY 
The first meeting of Stan
ford's chapter of Students for
a Democratic Society ended late
Monday night after three hours
of discussion —but without any
decisions having been made.
Almost 300 students came to
the Tresidder Large Lounge to
try and develop goals and strat
egy for the coming year. How
aver, they were unable to agree
on any course of action, other
than to postpone all policymak
ing until the next general meet
ing—to be held next week at the
same time and place.
The lack of a consensus, which
occasioned the postponement,
was less serious than the fre
quently heated debate might
have indicated. Everyone seemed
to agree that "war-related re
search" done at Stanford and
at the Stanford Research Insti
tute was the problem to which
SDS should devote most of its
energies.
Tactical Split
The group, however, was di
vided on two matters —first,
what specific demands should be
made of the Stanford adminis
tration, and second, how the
Stanford community could best
be informed of Stanford's "in
volvement in the war."
Several demands were pro
posed—that "Stanford stop all
material support of the Viet
nam war"—that "Stanford stop
all military research," and that
"Stanford get out of Southeast
Asia."

Two ways were suggested for
presenting SDS's Drogram to
the Stanford community—the
mass "teach-in", which, it was
felt, had the drawback of not
allowing for much participation
—or, alternatively, many small
discussion groups in the various
houses on campus.
The indecision on these two
isues left SDS members with
only one way to participate be
fore the next meeting—by join
ing the so-called "study-action
groups." These were described
as "ten or fifteen people who get
together to study a problem—
and then take action to help
solve it." Leaders offered groups
on "labor," "black liberation,"
"the media," "the power struc
ture," and "anti-draft work with
Gl's and students."
The meeting, chaired by Jim
Shoch, opened with four brief
talks, apparently meant to pro
vide a foundation for debate.
Lost Virginity
The first speaker, David Pugh,
asserted that the myth of the
political neutrality of the uni
versity had finally been shatter
ed—that "the university's maid
enhead has been burst." As evi
dence, he noted that Stanford
had accepted $18 million in de
fense contracts, and that SRI
had taken over $30 million
worth—including, he maintained,
research in chemical-biological
warfare. "We can no longer be
told," he said, "that caps and
gowns are kept separate from

cloaks and daggers."
Jeff Browning maintained that
"the university is being used as
an apologist for the system. Cer
tain questions are never asked,
and certain assumptions are
never cast in doubt." He as
serted that students "don't
really really participate in run
ning the university," and that,
"they are trained to leave re
sponsibility to someone else."
Browning suggested that stu
dents form radical caucuses in
classes in order to force discus
sion of basic assumptions. He
also proposed that Stanford pro
fessors should make public the
subject of their research, and
for whom it is being done.
Ex-graduate student, Steve
Weissman, complained faceti
ously that "there is no Johnson
to protect us from Goldwater"
—that the liberal coalition had
collapsed. "But," he said, "the
rise of the right wing is the pro
duct of the same social forces
that drive black people to re
bellion in the ghetto."
Destroy Moralr
He questioned the meaning of
a formal democracy in a coun
try in which wealth was un
evenly distributed, and in which
"money means political power."
He suggested that the entire
community — churches, labor,
women's groups, etc. —be gotten
involved with getting Stanford
out of Southeast Asia.

Weissman noted that "good
research depends on high
morale," and that Stanford stu
dents could destroy the morale
of war-researchers simply by
making them ask questions
about their own work. He cited
an article in Science which
claimed that the demonstrations
at Columbia University had
completely destroyed the elan
at Columbia's Institute for De
fense Analysis, while doing
nothing physically to interrupt
the research.
The final speaker, economics
graduate student, Anne John
son, examined Stanford's role in
"economic reconnaissance." Her
talk was entitled, "Stanford and
Imperialism—from Peru to the
Pacific Basin." She proposed
that Stanford should get out of
"the war, Thialand, and South
America."
