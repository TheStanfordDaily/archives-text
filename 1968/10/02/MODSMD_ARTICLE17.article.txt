## Ardrey, Apes, "2001" 
### MARK SENN 
Robert Ardrey's "African Gen
esis" (Dell, 1961) focuses on the
theory of anthropologist Ray
mond Dart that apes—not men
—first had weapons and devel
oped the large brain to co-ordin
ate their use; herbivorous apes
were destroyed by the weapon
bearing carnivores A. Africanus
whence the name of the book
—be 112 or e man's emergence
which, of course, subsumed the
capacity to make weapons in his
cultural evolution. Apes, not
men, are the originators of tools
and weapons, Ardrey says.
A minor playwright of the
1930'5, Ardrey expands on his
thesis to suggest later three
basic drives in animals and
man: territory, status, and or
ganization or hierarchy. The
hierarchical structure creates
dominance e.g., the pecking or
der in barnyard hens, which, by
virtue of the great physiological
and psychological effects on its
members, ensures leadership, re
duces friction and improves
breeding; to Ardrey, this is a
fundamental life force.
Still in the posture of a play
wright, the author tends to mor
alize: "were a brotherhood of
man to be formed today, its only
possible common bond would be
ignorance of what man is." In
fact, African Genesis has an un
mistakable message: man lacks
self-knowledge. Ardrey blames
Rousseau for creating the "Ro
mantic fallacy"— the belief that
human behavior derives from
human experiences—but offers
very interesting discussions of
its propagators Freud and Marx.
In essense, referring to the an
thropologist Sir Arthur Keith,
Ardrey wants to show that men
are not fallen angels, but risen
apes.
Five years after African Gen
esis, Ardrey wrote The Territor
ial Imperative (Delta, 5966)

which seems better known. Af
ter laboriously proving the in
nate drive for territory, Ardrey
discusses communities. He calls
one a "noyau"—a society of in
ward antagonism—in which
members define themselves in
contrast to one another; in the
realm of political science, Ar
drey classifies Italy as a noyau,
and presents a fascinating justi
fication for his contention that
Italy is "the loneliest place in
the world." In contrast to the
noyau is the "biological nation,"
which defines itself in contrast
to other nations; in this cate
gory Ardrey classes the emerg
ing African nations. Ardrey de
vised the amity-enmity complex
—Symbolized A=E+h, where h
is hazard; in application, as h in
creases A may increase also and
E may diminish, and Ardrey
offers instances.
Antidote For Boredom
Some of Ardrey's most topical
remarks concern war, which he
calls man's most effective anti
dote for boredom. Because of
man's or animal's innate terri
toriality, invasion has several
results in addition to immediate
defense; the attacked group has
a tremendous amount of energy
released (since Ardrey calls ter
ritorality an instinct, the par
allels with the Freudian id are
necessary), and it cooperates
easily with ready acceptance of
leadership (as A=E+h indi
cates). Incidentally, the attack
ers are at a psychological dis
advantage away from their own
land. On escalation: "If there
is a policy of aggression more
doomed to failure, than the
dreamy Americans, we must as
sume, will someday invent it."
Ardrey's final conclusions
about animals and men from
The Territorial Imperative pos
tulate three drives, in this order,
for stimulation (not simply sex
ual), identity, and security. The

first and last are never in bal
ance and so create dynamism.
Not simply for the engaging
conclusions, but also for the in
credible evidence, Ardrey's
books warrant reading.
New Anthropology
The beginning of 2001: Space
Odyssey depicts the apes' inno
vation of a leg bone as a wea
pon; rooted in the "new anthro
pology" it seems to be at first
a chonicle of the use of weapons.
But soon one realizes that the
odyssey is the modern search
for the slab—a crucial, unex
plained, multifarious symbol—
which originally motivated the
apes to use the club: at times
the inexplicable slab may be
divine intelligence, god, prog
ress, the cycle of birth and
death, and so on. Exploration,
an interesting theme of Morris'
The Nak«*d Ape, seems to re
place weaponry as the focal
point of the picture.
2001 feels terribly long, espe
cially some parts of the well
selected music are soporific, and,
furthermore, since there is so
little dialog that eons seem to
pass between words. Neither the
acting (which is indescribable)
nor the action (which is shred
ded and dropped) recommend it:
the theme of weaponry is for
gotten, and exploration remains
thematic only superficially. The
explicit suggestion that ma
chines, if they are developed to
duplicate man, will be as neur
otic as their creators, is amus
ing. 2001 can be said to be a bad
movie—dull and meaningless—
but something about it is haunt
ing. Perhaps the amazing sets of
space stations and space ships,
or the magnificant twenty-min
ute light show at the end make
it impressive; perhaps more
than that is the last scene which
is terrifying and beautiful. If
only because it is very different,
2001 is well worth seeing.
