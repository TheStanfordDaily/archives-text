# Studio Watts Here With "Black Girl"
## 
### 
Studio Watts drama group is
coming to Stanford for a second
appearance on Oct. 3, 4, and 5
with a dramatized version of
George Bernard Shaw's "Black
Girl in Search of God."
The play, adaptt?d by Wanda
Evans Coleman of the drama
group, will be given at 8 p.m. on
the three evenings in the Little
Theater of Memorial Hall. Tick
ets ($2 each, donation) are on
sale at Tresidder box office.
Studio Watts School for the
Arts in Los Angeles was found
ed in Dec-ember 1964 by James
M. Woods, 33, who continues to
direct the program. He and the
cast will be guests of Ser r a
House and Alpha Sigma Phi stu
dents while at Stanford. The
drama group gave a highly suc
cessful performance there in
Mav.
Using art as a ' 00l to estab
lish a sense of worth and per
sonal value in culturally de
prived young people of the
Watts area, Woods has brought
his human enrichment experi
ment to about 300 to date.
He is an ardent advocate of
the master-apprentice system in
operation at the Studio. Ho says,
"The master has to produce. The
apprentice has to produce. Some
of the apprentices are on schol
arships of $200 a month of
which one-fourth goes to the
master, one-fourth for supplies,
one-fourth to the apprentice, and
one-fourth into a reserve fund
which is given to the apprentice
when he leaves the Studio. A
sense of worth happens ... on
all sides."
Also an advocate of what he
terms "the communication situ
ation," Woods and Studio
Watts have gained national
prominence for the "Chalk-In,"
an annual event of chalk draw
ings on pavement.

Woods describes the commu
nication situation as "a some
thing to do together." He be
lieves that through it the aliena
ted and the estranged can break
through their fears, tensions,
and defenses and begin to enrich
themselves by learning of others
different from themselves.
He considers it a waste of
time to talk about the need for
"good communication." Rather,
he leaps over the intellectualiz
ing and creates that which will
be of sufficient interest to draw
people together so that commu
nication can begin.
Woods gave up his profession
and guaranteed above-average

income as an accountant to start
the Studio with his wife, a for
mer probation officer with the
County of Los Angeles. He grad
uated from the University of
Southern California in 1958.
Members of the Studio's dra
ma group who will appear in
"Black Girl in Search of God"
are Odessa Cleveland, Juanita
Gist, Johnny Ray McGhee, John
Hopkins, John Bobbitt, and Miss
Coleman. Larry Hagman is di
rector.
Bobbitt graduated from Stan
ford in June. He now is working
in Los Angeles and spends four
evenings a week in the Studio
Watts drama group.

of the apprentices are on schol
arships of $200 a month of
which one-fourth goes to the
master, one-fourth for supplies,
one-fourth to the apprentice, and
one-fourth into a reserve fund
which is given to the apprentice
when he leaves the Studio. A
sense of worth happens ... on
all sides."
Also an advocate of what he
terms "the communication situ
ation," Woods and Studio
Watts have gained national
prominence for the "Chalk-In,"
an annual event of chalk draw
ings on pavement.

Woods describes the commu
nication situation as "a some
thing to do together." He be
lieves that through it the aliena
ted and the estranged can break
through their fears, tensions,
and defenses and begin to enrich
themselves by learning of others
different from themselves.
He considers it a waste of
time to talk about the need for
"good communication." Rather,
he leaps over the intellectualiz
ing and creates that which will
be of sufficient interest to draw
people together so that commu
nication can begin.
Woods gave up his profession
and guaranteed above-average

income as an accountant to start
the Studio with his wife, a for
mer probation officer with the
County of Los Angeles. He grad
uated from the University of
Southern California in 1958.
Members of the Studio's dra
ma group who will appear in
"Black Girl in Search of God"
are Odessa Cleveland, Juanita
Gist, Johnny Ray McGhee, John
Hopkins, John Bobbitt, and Miss
Coleman. Larry Hagman is di
rector.
Bobbitt graduated from Stan
ford in June. He now is working
in Los Angeles and spends four
evenings a week in the Studio
Watts drama group.
Studio Watts drama group is

Evans Coleman of the drama
group, will be given at 8 p.m. on

Studio Watts School for the
Arts in Los Angeles was found
ed in Dec-ember 1964 by James
M. Woods, 33, who continues to
direct the program. He and the
cast will be guests of Ser r a
House and Alpha Sigma Phi stu
dents while at Stanford. The
drama group gave a highly suc
cessful performance there in
Mav.
Using art as a ' 00l to estab
lish a sense of worth and per
sonal value in culturally de
prived young people of the
Watts area, Woods has brought
his human enrichment experi
ment to about 300 to date.
He is an ardent advocate of
the master-apprentice system in
operation at the Studio. Ho says,
"The master has to produce. The
