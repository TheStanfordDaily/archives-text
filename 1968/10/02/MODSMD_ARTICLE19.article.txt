# Biz School Women Attractive Asset

### 
She doesn't wear a pin stripe
suit or carry a briefcase. In
stead, she sports a mini-skirt
with patterned hose and tucks
the "Wall Street," not the "La
dies Home" Journal under her
arm, breezing into a room filled
with men who say "hello" but
don't stand up.
During class she may be
asked to explain the housewife's
consumer behavior. After class
she may be asked for a date.
She flies to New York for an
interview, campaigns for class
secretary, and spends an eve
ning making a dress. Her door
is always open to the undergrad
uate girls in the dorm where
lives as a resident assistant.
Acting as mother-confessor and
social chairman, she is grateful
for female companionship, al
though she often hides under a
hairdryer to do an accounting
problem.
She is energetic, efficient, en
thusiastic — but she retains her
femininity. When everyone else
in class is shouting, she remem
bers to raise her hand.
This amalgam is Stanford
Business School's typical female
M.B.A. candidate, 1968 style.
Last year the Business School
had seven like her among its
560 M.B.A.'s. The entering class
has five. There is one woman
among the school's 80 Ph.D.
candidates. Eighty-three women

have studied at Stanford Busi
ness School during its 42 years,
the first graduating in 1930. Of
fhe 83, 62 have earned M.B.A.
degrees; one a Ph.D. The re
mainder, for one reason or
another, did not complete their
studies here.
Ask any male working down
the hall what he thinks of wom
en in business and he answers,
"Poor!" Ask him what he thinks
of women in the Business School
and he smiles, "We ought to
have more! It would pick things
up a little. Have you seen these
girls—they're really quite attrac
tive!"
Such widely held double-think
appears based on the view that
women are not comeptitors. "We
don't think about these women
in executive positions," said one.
"Only in a few instances will we
have to deal with women as
peers in the business world, so
having them in school has no
bearing on the future."
Former Dean Ernest C. Ar
buckle values having girls in the
School, "because they raise the
competitive spirit of the men.
The men work harder to prove
that it is a man's world after
all," he says.
Prof. Gerald C. Leader argues
that women, as women, have a
great contribution to make in
the classroom. "They can be

catalysts in orienting the dis
cussion to another point of
view," he says.
His innovative classes in sen
sitivity training focus on the de
velopment of interpersonal
skills. "I like to have at least
one girl in each group, ideally
two or three. They tend to be
more spontaneous and emotional
and draw similar responses from
men. As a whole the men need
to be 'unfrozen' and 'opened up'
a bit."
The feminine viewpoint also
makes its most significant con
tribution in organizational be
havior classes, said one student.
"When we were discussing how
to manipulate people in busi
ness, this girl really got irate at
such an underhanded technique.

Finally, she admitted to manip
ulating her boyfriends . . . We
all learned a lot that hour . .
Despite Dean Arbuckle's wish
to see a "dozen or so admitted,"
usually only three or four girls
are selected from an average of
10 applicants each year, while
276 men were chosen from 1700
applicants for 19P>9.
Is this a form of token inte
gration? As one student ob
served, "Women and foreign
students, they give us a good
cross-section."
William Hannemann, assistant
dean of stutdent affairs, who in
sists there is no sex discrimina
tion in admissions policy, says
he is concerned only with turn
ing out employable people to
