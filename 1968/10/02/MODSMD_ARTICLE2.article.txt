# Cleaver Raps

"That is why I started to write.
To save myself."
"SOUL ON ICE"
To save himself, Cleaver also
started to read. He read Voltaire
and Camus and Leßoi Jones and
Karl Marx and Bakunin and
Machiavelli and Hemingway and
Mailer and Baldwin and Terry
Southern and a lot of others.
And he started to talk.
Now Cleaver knows the dialect
of Stanford and Berkeley as
well as the language of Oakland
and Watts. His message is intel
ligible to the grey-haired lady
with the crossed nylons and the
sensible touch of middle class lip
stick. She listens intently. What
is happening in her mind?
Eldridge Cleaver is a man who
can see the end of sentence be
fore he lays down the first word.

rimmed glasses and tweed sports
jackets and plaid hunting shirts
and smooth blond haircuts and
occasional black heads that lies
before Cleaver want to hear
something else. They want to
know that the ugly images that
come home to them on glass
screens are not real. That the
cocked chin of the Vice President
and pompous pointing finger
that Dick Nixon borrowed from
a better man and the hate mask
of the man from the South do
not contain the power that they
claim.
It is power that Cleaver is
talking about. His message is
that marble palaces and shiny
cruisers with flashing lights and
even the lightly oiled machines
that can project death so quick
ly and accurately do not consti
tute real power.
Cleaver says that rhetoric is
power if it is true. His rhetoric
is true for the people who
packed Mem Aud to h°ar him.
He does not try to te'l them that
we nr'st have this bi't we a'so
have that. That we must oink
while we quack.
He says that what once seemed
all right is a'l wrong. That things
must change. That things have
reached a point where some
people will die purposefully rath
er than leave things like they
are. That the number of thiese
people is growing.
Cleaver's rhetoric has the en
ergy of illusion-free int l'ect and
the strength of art. "Now lies
have been built out of the splin
ters of lies that have been shat
tered by reality," he says.
Stanford Knows Lies
The Stanford audience knows
the lies that the black man is
is talking about. They are deeply
aware that a village cannot be
saved by napalm and shellfire,
that clubs and mace are not har
bingers of peace in the streets.
But when the logic of the rhe
toric leads them a step further,
they begin to tighten up. If he
has to go, Cleaver says, he wants
to take them with him. If
American troops land on Chi
nese soil, then Mao's H-bomb
should come down here. The
business suit slouches in his
chair, props his head in his hand.
Even the kids, the ones who
know what Cleaver means when
he talks about white niggers,
lose some enthusiasm.
Cleaver releases them. He lets
them laugh at talk of pigs in
high places. He lets them share
his delight in puncturing the
conventions that are so sacred
to those who have never thought
about them. (Yes, fuck Mickey
Mouse.)
Cleaver can do this because he
knows his people and he knows
himself. He writes that he was
saved by self-knowledge.
Now this man is saying that
the rest of us need the kind of
sanity that he has learned.
We do.
