### Gary Cavalli 
September, 1968 has to go down in the annals of sporting history
as one of the unparalleled 30-day periods of all time.
There was the classic mixture of the spectacular and the pathetic,
the brilliant performance contrasted with the ludicrous factors con
tributing to it.
On the professional scene, September brought with it the Ameri
can League's first 30-game winner in 34 years. But Denny McClain's
tremendous achievement was no doubt greatly aided by the AL's

the hearts of all devoted fans.
