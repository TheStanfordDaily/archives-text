# Tribe Faces Chico Today
## Soccer Team Eyes First Win 
### 
The Indian soccer team opened
its season on a sour note, losing
a 6-1 decision to the U.S. Naval
Postgraduate School Saturday at
Stanford.
Although the Indians had the
Navy on the defensive, most of
the time, a well placed clearance
down the center and a mistake
by the defense allowed forward
Jim Cowie to put the ball into
the goal for the Grads first score.
Near the end of the first quar
ter the referee called a foul for
a sliding tackle in the penalty
area and awarded a penalty kick
to the Postgraduate school.
Cooper, who was playing goalie
for the Navy, changed his shirt
long enough to make good on
the penalty.
The second quarter was pretty
much all Stanford's, but the
Tribe couldn't penetrate the de
fense and at half time the score
was 2 to 0 in favor of the Post
graduate School.
The second half saw the In
dians dominating the play but
not the scoring. In the third
quarter with the score 4-0, Walt
er Lammi broke through for the
lone Stanford score. Although
dominating the play, and out
shooting their opponents 34 to
32, the more experienced team
from Monterey was too much to
overcome. The final score was
USNPGS 6 Stanford 1.

Today Stanford travels to Chico
far a game. Last year the teams
played to a 2-2 tie in two over
times. Not much is known about
Chico except that it lost to a very
strong San Jose State team 9 to
2 last Wednesday.
Saturday, October 5, the team

travels to Stockton for a match
with the University of the Pa
cific.
Judging from the spirited play
that was exhibited on Saturday,
this year Stanford should be In
the game until the last whistle.
