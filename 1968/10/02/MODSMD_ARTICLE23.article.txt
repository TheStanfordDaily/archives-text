## Improved Netmen Begin Practice Frosh Gerken Dumps Ailing Ashe 
### FRED LEESON 
Gary Cavalli, Editor

Paul Gerken played the best
tennis of his life last week and
it just happened to be against
the best player in the nation,
U.S. Open champion Arthur
Ashe.
While his fellow freshmen
were encuntering their initial
skirmish with registration, Ger
ken was meeting Ashe in the
second round of the Pacific
Coast International tennis cham
pionships in Berkeley.
And Gerken, with an assist
from a pinched nerve in Ashe's
neck, eliminated the tennis
world's premier singles player
from the tourney.
Ashe Retires
The Stanford freshman took
the first set 6-2 and was leading
the second 3-0 when the suffer
ing Ashe was forced to discon
tinue.
"Playing Arthur Ashe can
psychologically get to you," the
soft-spoken Gerken says,"and I
was really playing well." He had
learned two hours before the
match of Ashe's ailment, which
hampered the ex-UCLA star's
mobility and cut down the speed
of his serve.
Letdown
The next day Gerken, who
travelled during the summer
with the U.S. Junior Davis Cup
team, lost to John Yeomans 9-7,
6-3. Understandably there was a
mental letdown: "I played terri
bly because 1 had so many
things to think about," including
a new environment and classes.
Other members of Stanford's
contingent were also eliminated
in the third round which nar
rowed the field from 32 to 16
players.
John Spiegel lost to Jim Os
born 6-2, 6-2, Chuck Alloo fell to

Roy Barth 6-4, 6-1 and freshman
Robin Fry was eliminated by
Tom Kiss 6-3, 8-6.
Practice Begins
Practice for the Tribe varsity
and frosh teams will begin Mon
day Oct. 7, when Coach Dick
Gould welcomes bark seven let
termen from his 1968 third place
team and a host of talented
freshmen which might comprise
the best frosh team in the na
tion.
Seniors Chuck Alloo, Brad
Cornell, Dale Wong and Dean
Schlobohm join last year's num
ber one Stanford player John
Spiegel for another year of var
sity competition.

Rob Rippner, who nursed a
bad knee last year and still
teamed up with Spiegel to make
a formidable doubles combina
tion, is currently overseas and
will not return until spring
quarter.
Stan Pasarell and Paul Mari
enthal, top prospects from last
year's freshman team, are
strong candidates for the var
sity, and Ron Kahn, John Shep
ard and Dave Bleeker will also
be seeking berths.
Best Frosh Squad
The freshmen, who Coach
Gould claims will be Stanford's
best team since the 1938 frosh,
are headed by Gerken from East

Norwalk, Conn., and Mac Clafiin,
Coral Gables, Florida, who were
both on the Junior Davis Cup
team.
Chris Chaplin, John Wright
and Rick Evans are all highly
ranked southern California play
ers and Robin Fry and Bob
Dougherty made national rank
ings in the midwest.
In the Paeific-8, Gould figures
defending champion USC to im
prove, with second-place UCLA
holding about the same. Stan
ford and California, both strong
er than last year, will probably
be battling for the third spot.
On the fall tennis slate, the

Indian mentor notes the Pajaro
Dunes Exhibition Nov. 16 and
the Stanford Invitational Sin
gles Championships, a univer
sity-wide singles tourney Oct. 30
and Nov. 1, 4 and 6 as events
which will interest area tennis
fans.
