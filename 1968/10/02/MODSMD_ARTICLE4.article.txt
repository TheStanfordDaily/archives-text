# Mayfield Resurrected For Housing
## 
### BARBARA RITZ 
The University's housing short
age has caused the reactivation
of some old residences includ
ing Stanford Village and May
field House. Until last week the
latter residence was missing
closet doors and book shelves.
It still has poor heating sys
tems, a condemned kitchen,
faulty wiring, and a wooden fire
escape.
Such conditions prompted a
number of its residents to dub
the former ATO residence an
other "Bleak House."
The university has provided
space for forty-one undergradu
ate men in Mayfield House to al
leviate this year's housing short
age.
According to Alan Cummings,
Manager of Residences, the uni
versity was planning to tear
down the old ATO house along
with several other fraternity
houses on Mayfield Avenue. To
compensate for the housing
shortage, however, he explained
that the university purchased
the house in June for $12,500
and began a series of improve
ments during the summer.
Cummings estimated that
about $20,000 has been spent to
remodel the building. Funds for
improvements came from the
"Summer Renovation Program,"
from which approximately $350,-
000 was spent to improve other
university residences like Toyon
and Wilbur Halls, he added.

"The reasons we proceeded
with Mayfield was to provide
short term housing for five
years. At one time Mayfield was
being considered as a type of co
operative residence," Cummings
explained. "The residents would
have shared the tasks needed in
running the house. However,
when Mayfield was placed on the
housing draw as a co-op, it re
ceived little response."
Cora Lee Mack, Director of
Row residences, estimated that
nearly all the requests for im
provements at Mayfield are
presently being met or will be
met within several weeks.
Some of the residents de
scribed Mayfield as a kind of
"last chance" housing for stu
dents who were unassigned resi
dences during the university
housing draw last May.
As freshmen held low priority,
a number of former Wilbur
freshmen were assigned to May
field as their last choice on the
second draw. One sophomore ex
plained that he intends to re
main all year in Mayfield, then
draw into a co-ed residence next
year.
"Because of the priority sys
tem, you have to live on campus
to even have a ehance at next
year's residences," he said.
Several other students were
overseas during the spring quar
ter. One of them described the
housing draw forms as "un
clear," and entered the draw,

not realizing that he forfeited
the top priority in his original
residence.
According to Doug Davis, As
sistant Dean of Students, hous
ing on campus was guaranteed
for all returning students.
Those who indicated they would
be returning to their original
residences were all placed, he
said. Other students who en
tered the draw were guaranteed
a place on campus, but possibly
not their first or second choices,
he explained.
One sophomore at Mayfield
said he was not placed in a resi
dence during either draw last
May and wasn't assigned to
Mayfield House until early in
September.
However, Assistant Dean of
Stud nts Robert Rosch estimated
that as few as two students still
are waiting to be housed on cam
pus. He stated that there were
eight spaces left in Crothers and
15 spaces left for undergraduate
women on campus. Rosch com
mented that most of the stu
dents who wanted housing both
on and off campus have already
b n en assisted in finding places
to live.
Rosch also explained tint May
field Hou c e has no long term
existence planned for it. While
Mayfield may not have the com
forts of some of the other resi
dences, Rosch indicated that a
potential exists for raising the
quality of the house if there is

"some initiative" on the part of
its residents.
Individual opinions about
Mayfield vary from discontent
to a degree of satisfaction with
the residence.
One undergraduate in Stern
elected to move into the house
this week. Other residents, espe
cially the students housed on the
newly remodeled third floor, said
that fewer conveniences were
lacking in their rooms.
Dick Anderman, Resident As
sociate at Mayfield, questioned
the objectives of students living
in any university residence.
"It's a little early to write a
death sentence for any residence
scarcely the first week after
moving in," he commented. An
derman explained that the house
has many possibilities for be
coming a unique kind of resi
dence.
Already in the planning are a
series of discussions based on
the "President's Commission on
Violence," and including guests
in-residence and lecture series,
he said.
Anderman also mentioned im
provements that individual
members are considering im
provements such as remodeling
the c un porch.
"The difference between what
a residence can do for you and
what you can do for a residence
is a Question of attitude," he
said. "It's up to thr> men thorn
sol vos to decide what they want
to do, then do it."

IT'S A LONG WAY UP—But
Mayfield residents are just glad
that they found housing. May
field House is one of several old
residences that have been reno
vated to provide adequate hous
ing: for students.
The University's housing short
age has caused the reactivation
of some old residences includ
ing Stanford Village and May
field House. Until last week the
latter residence was missing
closet doors and book shelves.
It still has poor heating sys
tems, a condemned kitchen,
faulty wiring, and a wooden fire
escape.
Such conditions prompted a
number of its residents to dub
the former ATO residence an
other "Bleak House."
The university has provided
space for forty-one undergradu
ate men in Mayfield House to al
leviate this year's housing short
age.
According to Alan Cummings,
Manager of Residences, the uni
versity was planning to tear
down the old ATO house along
with several other fraternity
houses on Mayfield Avenue. To
compensate for the housing
shortage, however, he explained
that the university purchased
the house in June for $12,500
and began a series of improve
ments during the summer.
Cummings estimated that
about $20,000 has been spent to
remodel the building. Funds for
improvements came from the
"Summer Renovation Program,"
from which approximately $350,-
000 was spent to improve other
university residences like Toyon
and Wilbur Halls, he added.

"The reasons we proceeded
with Mayfield was to provide
short term housing for five
years. At one time Mayfield was
being considered as a type of co
operative residence," Cummings
explained. "The residents would
have shared the tasks needed in
running the house. However,
when Mayfield was placed on the
housing draw as a co-op, it re
ceived little response."
Cora Lee Mack, Director of
Row residences, estimated that
nearly all the requests for im
provements at Mayfield are
presently being met or will be
met within several weeks.
Some of the residents de
scribed Mayfield as a kind of
"last chance" housing for stu
dents who were unassigned resi
dences during the university
housing draw last May.
As freshmen held low priority,
a number of former Wilbur
freshmen were assigned to May
field as their last choice on the
second draw. One sophomore ex
plained that he intends to re
main all year in Mayfield, then
draw into a co-ed residence next
year.
"Because of the priority sys
tem, you have to live on campus
to even have a ehance at next
year's residences," he said.
Several other students were
overseas during the spring quar
ter. One of them described the
housing draw forms as "un
clear," and entered the draw,

not realizing that he forfeited
the top priority in his original
residence.
According to Doug Davis, As
sistant Dean of Students, hous
ing on campus was guaranteed
for all returning students.
Those who indicated they would
be returning to their original
residences were all placed, he
said. Other students who en
tered the draw were guaranteed
a place on campus, but possibly
not their first or second choices,
he explained.
One sophomore at Mayfield
said he was not placed in a resi
dence during either draw last
May and wasn't assigned to
Mayfield House until early in
September.
However, Assistant Dean of
Stud nts Robert Rosch estimated
that as few as two students still
are waiting to be housed on cam
pus. He stated that there were
eight spaces left in Crothers and
15 spaces left for undergraduate
women on campus. Rosch com
mented that most of the stu
dents who wanted housing both
on and off campus have already
b n en assisted in finding places
to live.
Rosch also explained tint May
field Hou c e has no long term
existence planned for it. While
Mayfield may not have the com
forts of some of the other resi
dences, Rosch indicated that a
potential exists for raising the
quality of the house if there is

"some initiative" on the part of
its residents.
Individual opinions about
Mayfield vary from discontent
to a degree of satisfaction with
the residence.
One undergraduate in Stern
elected to move into the house
this week. Other residents, espe
cially the students housed on the
newly remodeled third floor, said
that fewer conveniences were
lacking in their rooms.
Dick Anderman, Resident As
sociate at Mayfield, questioned
the objectives of students living
in any university residence.
"It's a little early to write a
death sentence for any residence
scarcely the first week after
moving in," he commented. An
derman explained that the house
has many possibilities for be
coming a unique kind of resi
dence.
Already in the planning are a
series of discussions based on
the "President's Commission on
Violence," and including guests
in-residence and lecture series,
he said.
Anderman also mentioned im
provements that individual
members are considering im
provements such as remodeling
the c un porch.

a residence can do for you and
what you can do for a residence
is a Question of attitude," he

IT'S A LONG WAY UP—But
Mayfield residents are just glad
that they found housing. May
field House is one of several old
residences that have been reno
vated to provide adequate hous
ing: for students.
The University's housing short
age has caused the reactivation
of some old residences includ
ing Stanford Village and May
field House. Until last week the
latter residence was missing
closet doors and book shelves.
It still has poor heating sys
tems, a condemned kitchen,
faulty wiring, and a wooden fire
escape.
Such conditions prompted a
number of its residents to dub
the former ATO residence an
other "Bleak House."
The university has provided
space for forty-one undergradu
ate men in Mayfield House to al
leviate this year's housing short
age.
According to Alan Cummings,
Manager of Residences, the uni
versity was planning to tear
down the old ATO house along
with several other fraternity
houses on Mayfield Avenue. To
compensate for the housing
shortage, however, he explained
that the university purchased
the house in June for $12,500
and began a series of improve
ments during the summer.
Cummings estimated that
about $20,000 has been spent to
remodel the building. Funds for
improvements came from the
"Summer Renovation Program,"
from which approximately $350,-
000 was spent to improve other
university residences like Toyon
and Wilbur Halls, he added.

"The reasons we proceeded
with Mayfield was to provide
short term housing for five
years. At one time Mayfield was
being considered as a type of co
operative residence," Cummings
explained. "The residents would
have shared the tasks needed in
running the house. However,
when Mayfield was placed on the
housing draw as a co-op, it re
ceived little response."
Cora Lee Mack, Director of
Row residences, estimated that
nearly all the requests for im
provements at Mayfield are
presently being met or will be
met within several weeks.
Some of the residents de
scribed Mayfield as a kind of
"last chance" housing for stu
dents who were unassigned resi
dences during the university
housing draw last May.
As freshmen held low priority,
a number of former Wilbur
freshmen were assigned to May
field as their last choice on the
second draw. One sophomore ex
plained that he intends to re
main all year in Mayfield, then
draw into a co-ed residence next
year.
"Because of the priority sys
tem, you have to live on campus
to even have a ehance at next
year's residences," he said.
Several other students were
overseas during the spring quar
ter. One of them described the
housing draw forms as "un
clear," and entered the draw,

not realizing that he forfeited
the top priority in his original
residence.
According to Doug Davis, As
sistant Dean of Students, hous
ing on campus was guaranteed
for all returning students.
Those who indicated they would
be returning to their original
residences were all placed, he
said. Other students who en
tered the draw were guaranteed
a place on campus, but possibly
not their first or second choices,
he explained.
One sophomore at Mayfield
said he was not placed in a resi
dence during either draw last
May and wasn't assigned to
Mayfield House until early in
September.
However, Assistant Dean of
Stud nts Robert Rosch estimated
that as few as two students still
are waiting to be housed on cam
pus. He stated that there were
eight spaces left in Crothers and
15 spaces left for undergraduate
women on campus. Rosch com
mented that most of the stu
dents who wanted housing both
on and off campus have already
b n en assisted in finding places
to live.
Rosch also explained tint May
field Hou c e has no long term
existence planned for it. While
Mayfield may not have the com
forts of some of the other resi
dences, Rosch indicated that a
potential exists for raising the
quality of the house if there is

"some initiative" on the part of
its residents.
Individual opinions about
Mayfield vary from discontent
to a degree of satisfaction with
the residence.
One undergraduate in Stern
elected to move into the house
this week. Other residents, espe
cially the students housed on the
newly remodeled third floor, said
that fewer conveniences were
lacking in their rooms.
Dick Anderman, Resident As
sociate at Mayfield, questioned
the objectives of students living
in any university residence.
"It's a little early to write a
death sentence for any residence
scarcely the first week after
moving in," he commented. An
derman explained that the house
has many possibilities for be
coming a unique kind of resi
dence.
Already in the planning are a
