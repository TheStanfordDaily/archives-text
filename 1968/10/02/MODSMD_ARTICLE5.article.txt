# Federal Cutback Proposal Spurs Glaser Opposition
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Acting President Robert Gla
rr s nt a 'etter to twelve U.S.
senators opposing a
osa 1 bv Mike Mans
field (D-Mont.) which would
ret Stanford $750,000 this year.
Mansfield's p'an, an amend
ment to the Department of De
fens- Bill (HR 18707), would
a ceiling on payments of in
direct costs in research proj
ects at 25 per cent of direct costs.
Stanford now receives as
much as 57 per cent of
and vag'-s on these projects —
»*be direct costs --to meet the
University's indirect costs, sveh
as building maintenance.
Serious Impact
riaser said the amendment
'will have an extremely serious
impact upon the educat'onal in
stitution-; which conduct the
b' '11-- of the nation's research.
"These institutions have al
ready bo~n forced to a'locato
f'rnds from oth r programs to
meet indirect costs legitimate" y
incurred but
und-r present regulations," he
a^ded.
The Johnson Administration is
also vigorously opposing th~>
amendment, but ox ectations
a 1 * N that the proposal wi 1
if it is introduced on the floor
of the Senate. Officials are pres

ently trying to dissuade Sen.
Mansfield from introducing the
bill.
Reinstitute Flat Ceiling
The Mansfield amendment
wou'd reinstitute the flat ceiling
system that was dropped several
years ago. Glaser said "flat ceil
ings fai 1 entirely to take into
consideration the differing na
ture of institutions and their
costs.
With respect to Stanford, he
said "imposition of such a cut
would mean that we would be
forced to terminate a consider
able numb r of highly trained
and valuable employees. These
terminations would be in addi
tion to staff reductions already
taking place as a result of gov
ernmental economies in the ap
propriation process."
G'aser's thoughts wore echoed

by John F. Morse, director of the
Commission on Federal Rela
tions of the American Council
on Edreation, in an urgent let
ter sent to members late last
week.
"If the amendment is adopt
ed," he said, "the effect will, of
course, be to reinstitute, across
the board, a flat indirect cost
ceiling for all research agree
ments — a reversion to the pre
-1965 situation which so compli
cated all our lives.
"My impression is that the
amendment is based on a total
misunderstanding of why in
direct cost rates can vary from
18 per cent to as much as 80
per cent."
Both Glaser and Morse b'ame
these differences on different ac
counting procedures in different
institutions.

bill.
Reinstitute Flat Ceiling
The Mansfield amendment
wou'd reinstitute the flat ceiling
system that was dropped several
years ago. Glaser said "flat ceil
ings fai 1 entirely to take into
consideration the differing na
ture of institutions and their
costs.
With respect to Stanford, he
said "imposition of such a cut
would mean that we would be
forced to terminate a consider

and valuable employees. These
terminations would be in addi

taking place as a result of gov
ernmental economies in the ap
propriation process."
G'aser's thoughts wore echoed

by John F. Morse, director of the
Commission on Federal Rela

on Edreation, in an urgent let

week.
"If the amendment is adopt

the board, a flat indirect cost
ceiling for all research agree
