# Whitaker Examines 'Ph.D.' Production
## 
### 
On a nation-wide basis, about
two-thirds of tho students who
start studying for a Ph.D. never
obtain the degree, Graduate
Dean Virgil K. Whitaker esti
mates.
"The production of Ph.D.'s
may well be the most inefficient
operation in America today," he
savs.
Since he became dean in 1964,
Whitaker has made a major ef
fort to studv and improve Ph.D.
programs, especially in the hu
manities and social sciences.
The importance of this work
was rer-ogniz'-'d * w0 y ears a P°
'••hen the Ford Foundation made
a $4 million grant to Stanford to
provide financial support to doc
toral students in these fields.
Similar grants were made con
currently to nine other institu
tions.
Government cut-backs in sci
entific research and training pro
grams have created new prob
lems in helping advanced stu
dents in these fields, Whitaker
says. A noted Shakespearean
scholar, he believes the drop-out
problem for Ph.D.'s may stem
from relying on purely academ
ic criteria for graduate level ad
missions.
"Granted the level of candi
dates who apply to Stanford,
probably such factors as imagi
nation, originality, drive, and
plain, good study habits are
about as important as grades,"
he comments.
With assistance from compu
ters "we're now in a position to
determine who drops out when
-and then find out why," he
notes. "We've never been able to
do that before."
(Numerous studies of under
graduate drop-outs have shown
that the most important single
factor for leaving college was

lack of motivation, rather than
grades or financial difficulties.)
Whitaker notes that Stanford
has made substantial progress in
improving the proportion of stu
dents admitted to Ph.D. work
who achieve the degree. A re
cent study of Woodrow Wilson
fellows showed Stanford rated
among the top three universities
nationally in this respect.
In a recent talk with new
graduate students, he empha
sized the need for hard, self-di
rected study habits: "Professors
are busy and trustful. They ex
pect a graduate student to be
resourceful enough to seek help
when he needs it, and they sin
cerely believe that he needs and
deserves freedom to explore
what interests him. There is no
question whatever that a rea
sonably clever and plausible
Ph.D. candidate, by taking ad
vantage of his professor's trust
and idealism, can spend three or
four years of minimum effort,
supported these days by a fel
lowship which will at least keep
him and even his wife from star
vation.
"There is also no question that
sooner or later his way of life
will catch up with him as he ap
proaches his major examina
tions or, if he squeaks through
those, as he confronts the prob
lem of writing a dissertation.
But the danger that really wor
ries me as a graduate dean is
not that of the student whu
loiters away his time. It is the
more subtle danger facing the
well-intentioned and relatively
promising students who merely
lets himself get somewhat be
hind, perhaps by taking an in
complete as the easy way out
instead of spending some extra
hours finishing the work for a
course on time.

grades or financial difficulties.)
Whitaker notes that Stanford
has made substantial progress in
improving the proportion of stu
dents admitted to Ph.D. work
who achieve the degree. A re
cent study of Woodrow Wilson
fellows showed Stanford rated
among the top three universities
nationally in this respect.
In a recent talk with new
graduate students, he empha
sized the need for hard, self-di
rected study habits: "Professors
are busy and trustful. They ex
pect a graduate student to be
resourceful enough to seek help
when he needs it, and they sin
cerely believe that he needs and
deserves freedom to explore
what interests him. There is no
question whatever that a rea
sonably clever and plausible
Ph.D. candidate, by taking ad
vantage of his professor's trust
and idealism, can spend three or
four years of minimum effort,
supported these days by a fel
lowship which will at least keep
him and even his wife from star
vation.
"There is also no question that
sooner or later his way of life
will catch up with him as he ap
proaches his major examina
tions or, if he squeaks through
those, as he confronts the prob
lem of writing a dissertation.
But the danger that really wor
ries me as a graduate dean is
not that of the student whu
loiters away his time. It is the
more subtle danger facing the
well-intentioned and relatively
promising students who merely
lets himself get somewhat be
hind, perhaps by taking an in
complete as the easy way out
instead of spending some extra
hours finishing the work for a
course on time.
On a nation-wide basis, about
two-thirds of tho students who
start studying for a Ph.D. never
obtain the degree, Graduate
Dean Virgil K. Whitaker esti
mates.
"The production of Ph.D.'s
may well be the most inefficient
operation in America today," he
savs.
Since he became dean in 1964,
Whitaker has made a major ef
fort to studv and improve Ph.D.
programs, especially in the hu
manities and social sciences.
The importance of this work
was rer-ogniz'-'d * w0 y ears a P°
'••hen the Ford Foundation made
a $4 million grant to Stanford to
provide financial support to doc
toral students in these fields.
Similar grants were made con
currently to nine other institu
tions.
Government cut-backs in sci
entific research and training pro
grams have created new prob
lems in helping advanced stu
dents in these fields, Whitaker
says. A noted Shakespearean
scholar, he believes the drop-out
problem for Ph.D.'s may stem
from relying on purely academ
ic criteria for graduate level ad
missions.
"Granted the level of candi
dates who apply to Stanford,
probably such factors as imagi
nation, originality, drive, and
plain, good study habits are
about as important as grades,"
he comments.
With assistance from compu
ters "we're now in a position to
determine who drops out when
-and then find out why," he
notes. "We've never been able to
do that before."
(Numerous studies of under
graduate drop-outs have shown
that the most important single
factor for leaving college was

lack of motivation, rather than
grades or financial difficulties.)
