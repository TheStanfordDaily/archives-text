## Jane On Health Care 
### DAN MELLINKOFF 
Editor, The Daily:
The following extract from a
letter of July 6, 1903, to the
Board of Trustees from Jane L.
Stanford may be of interest rela
tive to the University's elimina
tion of tuition-covered hospitali
zation:
"(I) think no sanitarium or
hospital should ever be man
aged by anyone connected with
the University, except by the
students themselves. It is,
however, deemed wise and ex
pedient that the students
should tax themselves each
year ... to create a fund with
which to provide for them
selves the proper care and at
tention which may be requir
ed in case of sickness. Aside
from being a necessity, it is an
education and discipline which
will enable the students to
learn the great advantage of
having their own funds at their
command to supply a per
haps much needed want . . . "

I would like to protest the in
clusion of the Peninsula Obser
ver issue, "The Goods on Pit
zer," in our registration mater-

The now mind is diverse, its
psychology complex. And the fol
lowing, but a journey through
the Hells and highs of the class
of '72 — narrated by the partici
pants — the men the women who
so inadvertantly live in their un
seasoned lives.
"Look at all these people!"
"You remember how on the first
time they came in so formal."
"Really, well really! Most boys
don't just walk up and say 'May
I feel your hair?'"
A frost face cracks and a half
smile fills the space of feigned
hostility.
"My hair, gawd, I have to set
it every other day." "Harry, do
you want to be gross?" — gig
gles — "Don't belabor the girl."
"Tell her some dirty jokes —
are you in rilery?" "Huh?" 'I
said, 'Is that a pistol I see?' "
"Hey." "Hunt!" — lovingly —
"Hi Hunt." "Hi Hunt." — "Hunt,
Hunt!?" . . . "What are you tak
ing?" "Math, chemistry, English,
Civ." "Oh, REALLY" — empha
tic — "I'm going to be a doctor."
"Already? For a girl it's a long
hard course." — huffing — "I
KNOW what I want. My father,
he'll put me through all right,
he's loaded." The voices ebb into
banality, they sink.
"What are you taking?"
"Where do you live?" "I'm
Carol." A thousand people stand
ing in queues, the clamor rises.
"I'm in Branner." "Psyche., Civ.,
French, English." "Your name,
what is it?"
Talk, all is monologue — dia
logue. Voices competing for the
inheritance of friends rise and
fall. Laughter spreads, recedes,
gurgling. They gather into
groups, secure clusters. The flow
continues.

ials, or that its supporters were
allowed to pass out copies at
the doors of Mem Aud.
No neutral or favorable infor
mation about Dr. Pitzer (such
as the last edition of the Stan
ford Observer) was given out
during registration. This is either
biased or oversight and is com
pletely unfair to Kenneth Pitzer
and Stanford's freedom of
speech.

Editor, The Daily:
Thanks Misters Augustyn and
Marshall! It's about time some
thing was said about audience
participation and Stanford's yell
leaders.
On several occasions during
the San Jose game, comments
of "bad taste" were made. This
we cannot deny.
However, is an intellectual at
mosphere proper at Stanford
football games? Saturday after
noons should be a time to sup
port the team while also to enjoy
ourselves. Yet, it is often diffi
cult to get people to fill the card
section or to join in even the
simplest measures of support for
the team.
Has the academic atmosphere

"I've bad knees, they're knob
by." "No knotty!" "Can you
crack knuckles?" "Hi I'm a foot
ball player." "Hey and no clip
ping penalty." "... the locker
room, in the locker room you
should see his arms, he's huge."
"Where's Younger?" "Loves
Amy's." "Yeah man, I almost
HAD to rough up a couple of
guys this night." "Oh, shit."
"Amazing" — delighted —
"I've never written a check for
a hundred before, today one
thousand."
"Did you put in your dollar?"
"A beer party?" "Is it coming?"
"Hey did you put yours in?"
"Yes." — patronizing — "Good,
Good!" "Beer, beer, let's pro
pose a toast to beer!" "Yah,
Beer." — yelled — "Let's not
wake. up any of these people
with eight o'clock classes!"
"Come on, dirnk more ..."
"I was downstairs three min
utes ago, but Chris just puked
all over the floor. Chuck's up
stairs helping clean up." "Hey
your friend just let loose up
stairs." — hmmed — "He just
can't hold his liquor."
"Oh, wow, wow," —- sardon
ically — "Do you realize that
tomorrow we begin our college
education?"
The evening labors, freshman
humanity surfaces. "How a week
has changed everyone." "Now
they're so quiet." "I feel so great,
so great!" "Because when you're
at Branner, you SHOULD be a
Freshman." "You can have a
good time, you can plan a good
time, but you can't be a good
time." "You can't try to love."
"I love it here." "Love" " . . .
love ..." "Oh wonderous."
"Let's all bo happies."
"Just look at so many people!"

of Stanford University so limited
itself that we can no longer
smile, laugh, applaud, or simply
enjoy ourselves? Obviously, it
takes some effort, but let's drop
the passive role and react to the
urge to participate!
Although some mistakes in
judgment have been made, our
efforts have and will continue
to be directed toward encourag
ing participation and enthusiasm
at our games.

Editor, The Daily:
Phil Taubman, in his other
wise almost-accurate article on
the new coffee house to be con
structed in Tresidder Union, ne
glects to give credit to the one
person most responsible for the
coffee house. That is Mrs. Bar
bara Dray of the Dean of Stu
dents Office.
Moreover, Taubman gives
much credit to Denis Hayes, who
to my knowledge deserves little.
Much credit should go to the new
Union Director, Forest Tregea,
who as Taubman points out,
went to bat for a coffee house
in the Union.
