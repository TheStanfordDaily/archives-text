Dear Mom,
I am a young, enthusiastic,
newly-ordained Methodist min
ister appointed as Davie Na
pier's assistant. My bicycle was
stolen my first day on campus.
I am riding a white 24" girl's
bike now.
I attended an ecumenical Uni
versity Christian Movement at
the Newman Center to join in
loving prayer with the Catho
lics and had my vest and suit
coat stolen. (I have the trou
sers.) As this was my only suit,
do you feel my ministry is at
an end? Also, do you feel opti
mistic about the ecumenical
movement?
David Schilling
Assistant Dean of the Chapel
Dear David,
"We cannot always see clear
ly God's plan for us, but I feel
that your ministry has a better
chance with the trousers and
without the vest and coat than
with the coat and vest but . . . .
On ecumenism: I am entirely
optimistic as we Catholics agree
completely with you Methodists
except for a few minor points
on which you are wrong.
Don't worry about the bike
thievery as it is rampant on cam
pus. For example, my six-year
old daughter recently lost her
white 24" girl's bike.
Affectionately,
Mom
Dear Mom,
We represent the local S.D.S.
chapter at Stanford. We have a
nice card table and a lot of
magazines and colorful litera
ture. But we feci left out as
people keep asking us "when
the action will start" and "what
we will burn first."
We are very enthusiastic
about SDS and would like to be
in on the action early. We would
especially like to know when
"Stanford will become Colum
bia." How can we find out?
SDS Committee at Stanford
Dear S.D.S.,
The central clearing-house for
all information concerning Stan
ford is cleverly disguised under
the name: Faculty Women's

Club Bridge Section. The Facul
ty Women's Club Garden Club
handles administrative decisions
here and the Embroidery Group
deals with policy.
Conspiratorlally,
Mom
Dear Mom,
Both my girl friend and I are
sterile. Will this pass on to our
children?
Bob
Dear Bob,
No. That is a recessive char
acteristic.
Mom
Dear Mom,
Are you the fat funny lady
who was in my French class last
year and didn't fit into the
chairs?
Susie
Dear Susie,
No. That was another under
graduate mother of seven.
Offendedly,
Mom
Dear Mom,
I am a member of Phi Delta
Theta fraternity and feel that
there is a lot of prejudice
against Phi Delt's on the cam
pus. For example, people keep
saying we were firing guns ran
domly out of the windows in
the old Phi Delt house.
This is absolutely untrue. We
were not firing randomly. We
were firing at S.A.E.'s.
Walter
Dear Walter,
It's so nice for the young to
have a purpose in life and a
cause! Don't worry about the
anti-Phi Delt atmosphere on
campus. There are many other
educational institutions in the
Bay Area besides Stanford. Why
doesn't your group have a nice
party with some Mills girls, for
example?
Convivily,
Mom
