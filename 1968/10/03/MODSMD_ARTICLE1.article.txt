# Grad Student Heads For Olympic Sailing
## 
### BARBARA HYLAND 
This fall Stanford will have
a personal stake in the Mexican
Olympics. Carl Van Duyne, a
fiirst year graduate student in
Economics, will be representing
the United States in the sailing
competition.
Van Duyne specializes in the
Finn division, which is the small
est of the five Olympic classes.
A Finn is a 1-rnan boat with a
single sail and is fifteen feet
long. Its name comes from the
1952 Olympics which were held
in Helsinki, Finland.
To be selected for the U.S.
team, Van Duyne first had to
race in one of the four regional
semifinals. He is from Short
Hills, New Jersey and went to
the trials in Marblehead, Massa
chusetts. The Olympic system of
'he best six out of seven races
was used.
First in Trials
A couple hundred boats par
ticipated in the semifinals. This
August in the final trials in San
Diego's Mission Bay, the num
ber was reduced to 41. Van
Duyne came in first with a
1-1-2-3-5-2 record.
In both semifinals and finals,
Van Duyne used his own boat,
"Finnatic," although the sail was
supplied in an attempt to stand
ardize the boats. In the actual
races in Acapulco, the Mexican
Olympic Committee will supply
not only the sail and equipment,
but the boat and mast as well.
Van Duyne explained that this
makes the races "a test solely of
sailing skill."
The sailing competition, the
only sport in the Olympics held
outside of Mexico City, will take
place in Acapulco.
Heat Big Problem
"The biggest problem will be
getting used to the heat," Van
Duyne said. While the Ameri
cans in Mexico City will be con
tending with the high altitude,
those in Acapulco will try to con
dition themselves to 90° temp
erature, 90 per cent humidity,
and 85° water.
They will be on the water 5
to 6 hours a day since the course
equals eight miles. The seven
races are all based on a triangle
windward - leeward - windward
course.
Van Duyne left Monday for
Mexico. He will be issued his
boat next Monday. The Mexican
Navy is shipping all the boats
down for free. He will then have
until October 14 to prepare for
the races.
There will be a race a day for
the first four days, followed by
a few days off, and then the re
maining three races. The series
of races will take 9 to 10 days.
Strongest Contenders
Fortty-five to fifty countries

are expected to participate. The
Finn division will be the largest
of the five classes. According to
Van Duyne, the strongest con
tenders for the gold medal are
West Germany, with the 1964
gold medalist; Denmark with the
1968 World Champion; and Bra
zil, with the 1967 gold medalist
of the Pan American games.
"Then right behind them is
another half dozen." These in
clude Italy, Russia, and Scan
dinavia. Van Duyne said, "It
will be pretty much of a toss
up."
Sports Illustrated has fa
vored Denmark. Van Duyne is
"not so sure" since the competi
tion is "too deep" for certainty.
He does feel that both Denmark
and Brazil have excellent
chances.
As to his own chances, Van
Duyne remarked that, "Condi
tions will be different; the
equpiment will be different.
Both, I thing, will be to my ad
vantage."
The prevailing condition
should be light weather. It is im
portant to keep a Finn as even
keeled as possible. In heavy
wind the skipper is forced to
hike out over the side in order
to balance the boat and prevent
it from heeling.
Clothing Boosts Weight
Although strong and wiry,
Van Duyne weighs only 165
pounds. Weight is essential in
hiking out so he often augments
his weight with 65 pounds of
clothing.
He wears up to sixteen sleeve
less sweat shirts and half a doz
en sweat pants. These are made
heavier by drenching them with

water. With the light air in
Acapulco, heeling will not be
a problem and his light weight
may become an advantage.
The equipment will be new
to him, but Van Duyne expects
to plan the mast to simulate his
own, which will be shipped to
Acapulco. This may give him an
edge over other participants.
Veteran Competitor
Van Duyne is not new to com
petition. He started racing when
he was six. Since then he has
won a silver medal in the 1967
Pan Am games, placed first in
the North American regatta this
summer, and also won the 1966
Intercollegiate Singlehand
Championships. As an under
graduate at Princeton he was a
member of the sailing team.
Van Duyne has also partici
pated in the 1966 World Cham
pionships in La Baule, France;
the 1967 World Championships
in Hanko, Finland; and the 1967
European Championships in
Naples, Italy.
Portions of the Olympic sail
ing competition will be televised.
Van Duyne will also be featured
in the October issues of Yacht
ing, One Design and Off-Shore
Yachtsman, and Rudder.
This fall as bemused drivers
passed by a V.W. going across
the country and laden with "sail
boat and equipment, school
books, clothes, sleeping bag, and
10-speed bike," they probably
wondered about the driver. It
was Carl Van Duyne, a member
of the U.S. sailing team and a
potential gold medalist in the
1968 Olympic Games.


OLYMPIC SAILOR —Carl Van Duyne's practicing has paid off. He
left Monday for Acapnlco to sail in the 1968 Olympics. Van Dnyne
won his position early last month in trials held at Mission Bay. Here
Carl skippers a Finn on the East Coast in Mantoloking, New Jersey.
He has also raced in France, Italy and Finland. Carl will be fea
tured in three upcoming national yachting magazines.
