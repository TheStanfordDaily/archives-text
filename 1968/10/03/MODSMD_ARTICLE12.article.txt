# Spanner's Right
## The 						Curve Squeeze 
### ROBERT SPANNER 
A particularly effective way to
blow five minutes is to argue
the relative stringency of the
"Stanford curve" versus the
curves of other universities.
One frequently overhears such
comments as "They graduate
most of the class with honors at
Harvardâ€”" or "my cousin is a
low-class moron, and he's pull
ing a 3.5 at Princeton."
This summer, many of the
"prestige universities" were sur
veyed, in order to discover just
what the undergraduate grade
averages were at these other
colleges. Although the response
was less than marvelous, the re
sults of that survey are pro
voking, nonetheless.
For purposes of comparison,
the GPA of the Stanford grad
uating class of 1965-66 was used,
since there has been very little
change between classcs each
year, and since the Registrar is
no longer computing graduating
class GPA's.
At Bryn Mawr, a girls' school
in Pennsylvania, seniors gradu
ated with an average of just
over 3.0 in 1968, close to the
Stanford women's GPA of 3.07.

However, Bryn Mawr also
graduated 73 per cent of its class
with honors, a distinction which
could be a factor in later gradu
ate school or employment ac
ceptance. Stanford graduates
only 20 per cent of its class each
year with honors.
Classes at California Institute
of Technology, and the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology
usually graduate with a GPA of
3.0, three tenths of a point high
er than the Stanford engineer's
average. In addition, Cal Tech
graduates 40 per cent of its sen
iors with honors.
Princeton, whose student body
is entirely male, graduates its
seniors with a GPA of around
3.0, and 65 per cent graduate

with honors. The GPA of Stan
ford men is 2.8.
And at Pomona, a liberal arts
school, the graduating class of
1966-67 had a GPA of 3.23 (con
verted from the Pomona 12-
point grading scale). The Stan
ford humanities and sciences
grade average was 2.91.
One explanation for the lower
average at Stanford is that the
calibcr of student is not as high
as at the other institutions. But
that is difficult to believe, when
the incoming freshman class tra
ditionally has a high school
GPA of over 3.9.
It's got to be the curve, not the
student.
But even if the Stanford curve
is lower than that of other
schools, committees of graduate
schools could conceivably com
pensate for it and the Stanford
student would not be penalized.
Unfortunately, this is not the
case. A supplemental survey of
the best professional schools and
graduate departments in tin
country revealed that among the
prestige institutions, Stanford is
often rated among the least
stringently-graded schools.
The departments and schools
surveyed were asked to rate
Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Berke
ley, Stanford, the University of
Chicago, and MIT in terms of
stringency of grading.
The Berkeley History Depart
ment rated Stanford as easier
than Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
and MIT; the Berkeley English
Department rated the Stanford
curve easier than that of Har
vard, Yale, Princeton, and Berk -
ley.
The Cal Tech Chemistry De
partment rated Stanford as the
easiest school on the list. The
MIT Economics Department
rated Stanford as fifth-hardest,
and the Yale History Depart
ment picked Princeton as the
school with the most stringent
curve.

Only the University of Michi
gan Law School felt that the
Stanford curve was probably the
toughest.
If universities like MIT and
Princeton, with significantly
higher GPA's than Stanford's,
are rated more difficult than
Stanford, then Stanford seniors
applying to graduate school are
in a poor position to compete
with seniors from those schools.
More research must be done
in this area. The response to the
two surveys cited here was sim
ply too small to be conclusive.
But there seem to be indications
that the Stanford curve is too
low, to the disadvantage of the
90 p?r cent of Stanford students
who go on to graduate school.
