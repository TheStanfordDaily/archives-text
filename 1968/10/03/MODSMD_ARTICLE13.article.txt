Virtually all students have
some knowledge of the 11-S clas
sification. However, there are
still many areas of confusion
with respect to eligibility for
this classification and the con
sequences of being so classified.
Students should note that
there are important distinctions
between the 11-S classification
for undergraduates and the 11-S
for graduate students.
Selective Service Regulations
require that an undergraduate
be placed in Class 11-S if he:
(1) requests such classification,
and (2) is satisfactorily pursuing
a full-time course of instruc
tion. The 11-S is granted for one
academic year (a 12-month pe
riod) and is terminated if one
of the following occurs: the stu
dent (1) completes the require
ment of his baccalaureate de
gree, (2) fails to pursue satis
factorily a full-time course of
instruction, or (3) reaches the
age of 24.
Satisfactory progress is defined
roughly as carrying an amount
of work required to complete
one's degree within the normal
number of years for that pro
gram.
.. Graduate students. are in a
very different situation. There
are two groups of graduate stu
dents who are eligible for the
11-S classification: (1) graduate
students in medicine, dentistry,
veterinary medicine, osteopathy
and optometry: and, (2) gradu
ate students entering their sec
ond or subsequent year on Octo
ber 1, 1967, for a total of five
years if a doctoral candidate or
a combined masters-doctoral
candidate.
Graduate students (except in
medicine) enrolling for their
first year of graduate study on
or after October 1, 1967 are now
prohibited from receiving a 11-S

classification.
The consequences of request
ing and receiving the 11-S are
important. First, the importance
of the request must be empha
sized, because if the registrant
has not specifically requested the
11-S after June 30, 1967 (the
enactment date of the new law),
he does not incur the consequen
ces.
A request is effected by either
writing to the local board re
questing a student deferment
(the 11-S classification) or by
completing the SS Form 104
(Request for Undergraduate De

ferment). Completing SS Form
103 or 109 or "Card 2" does not
constitute a request.
The consequences, then, of re
questing and receiving the 11-S
after June 30, 1967 are the fol
lowing: (1) ineligibility for the
I-S classification if the regis
trant has received his baccalau
reate degree, (2) liability for in
duction as a registrant within
the "prime age group", though
as of this date, no "prime age
group" has been established, (3)
liability for induction until age
35, and (4) ineligibility for the
111-A "fatherhood" deferment.

and (2) is satisfactorily pursuing
a full-time course of instruc
tion. The 11-S is granted for one
academic year (a 12-month pe
riod) and is terminated if one
of the following occurs: the stu
dent (1) completes the require
ment of his baccalaureate de
gree, (2) fails to pursue satis
factorily a full-time course of
instruction, or (3) reaches the
age of 24.
Satisfactory progress is defined
roughly as carrying an amount
of work required to complete
one's degree within the normal
number of years for that pro
gram.
.. Graduate students. are in a
very different situation. There
are two groups of graduate stu
dents who are eligible for the
11-S classification: (1) graduate
students in medicine, dentistry,
veterinary medicine, osteopathy
and optometry: and, (2) gradu
ate students entering their sec
ond or subsequent year on Octo
ber 1, 1967, for a total of five
years if a doctoral candidate or
a combined masters-doctoral
candidate.
Graduate students (except in
medicine) enrolling for their
first year of graduate study on
or after October 1, 1967 are now
prohibited from receiving a 11-S

classification.
The consequences of request
ing and receiving the 11-S are
important. First, the importance
of the request must be empha
sized, because if the registrant
has not specifically requested the
11-S after June 30, 1967 (the
enactment date of the new law),
he does not incur the consequen
ces.
A request is effected by either
writing to the local board re
questing a student deferment
(the 11-S classification) or by
completing the SS Form 104
(Request for Undergraduate De

ferment). Completing SS Form
103 or 109 or "Card 2" does not
constitute a request.
The consequences, then, of re
questing and receiving the 11-S
after June 30, 1967 are the fol
lowing: (1) ineligibility for the
I-S classification if the regis
trant has received his baccalau
reate degree, (2) liability for in
duction as a registrant within
the "prime age group", though
as of this date, no "prime age
group" has been established, (3)
liability for induction until age
35, and (4) ineligibility for the
111-A "fatherhood" deferment.
Virtually all students have
some knowledge of the 11-S clas
sification. However, there are
still many areas of confusion
with respect to eligibility for
this classification and the con
sequences of being so classified.
Students should note that
there are important distinctions
between the 11-S classification
for undergraduates and the 11-S
for graduate students.
Selective Service Regulations
require that an undergraduate
be placed in Class 11-S if he:
(1) requests such classification,
