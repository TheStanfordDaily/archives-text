• Fortas Withdrmvs
WASHINGTON (AP) — In a
strongly worded letter to Presi
dent Johnson deploring attacks
on the Supreme Court, Justice
Abe Fortas bowed to Senate op
position Wed. and requested
withdrawal of his nomination to
be chief justice.
Shortly thereafter, Johnson is
sued a statement saying that
with "deep regret" he was
acceding to Fortas' request and
withdrawing the nomination.
"I believed when I made this
nomination, and 1 believe now,
that he is the best qualified man
for this high position," the Pres
ident said.
Johnson's nomination of his
long-time friend and adviser to

succeed Chief Justice Earl War
ren appeared to have been
doomed Tuesday when the Sen
ate refused to cut off a filibuster
by opponents.
45 to 43
A 45-43 vote to put the Sen
ate's antifilibuster rule into ef
fect was 14 short of the required
two-thirds majority of senators
voting. And taking into account
six additional senators who did
not vote but announced their po
sition, the count would have
been 48 to 47 against cloture.
Although there were scattered
demands in the Senate that For
tas resign from the bench, he
said in his letter to Johnson that
he will be on hand to participate
in the court's work when it
opens its new term Monday.

Senators began immediate
speculation whether Johnson
would submit another nomina
tion and try to win confirmation
before Congress adjourns, prob
nably next week.
Another alternative would be
for the President to make a re
cess appointment after Con
gress adjourns, but Sen. Philip
Hart, D-Mich., who led the fight
for Fortas's confirmation, said
this would be undesirable.
• Blacks Blast UC
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
A campaign by Negroes to strip
the University of California of
financial and community sup
port is under way, according to
a California Negro leader, Carl
ton Goodlett.
Goodlett is chairman of the
California Negro Leadership
Conference, a policy group of
leaders of the Negro commun
ity throughout the state.
At a news conference Wed.,
Goodlett, publisher of the San
Francisco Negro newspaper Sun-
Reporter, said UC was guilty of
practicing racism and was doing
nothing to correct the situation.
Therefore, he said, his group
has begun a program to have
federal funds withheld from UC
under the Civil Rights Act, is
urging black lawmakers to deny
UC any legislative support, and
is campaigning for "the black
middle class to dissociate them
selves from all UC programs."

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) —
Hubert H. Humphrey told one of
the biggest crowds of his cam
paign Wednesday night that he
was a better law and order can
didate than George Wallace.
An overflow crowd of 13,000
which Humphrey aides said
was the biggest inside gathering
so far — welcomed Humphrey in

ful great crowd Mr. Nixon —look
at it."
"Who says North Carolina
wouldn't go Democratic?" de
manded Huhmprey to the
cheers of the crowd in the hot
Charlotte Coliseum.
Humphrey slashed at his
third-party opponent's law and
order record as governor of Ala
bama and trumpted his own as
mayor of Minneapolis mom
than 20 years ago.
Humphrey said he had
cleaned up a police department,

fonrrfit oi"cjam7prl crime and

had before."
• Nixon On Navy
NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — Rich
ard Nixon, campaigning on a
colonial college campus and
then in a Navy city, accused the
Democratic administration Wed.
of compromising future Ameri
can naval strength and permit
ting the Soviet Union to mount
"a major challenge against West
ern seapower."
Winding up his day of cam
paigning near the headquarters
of the Atlantic Fleet here, the
Republican presidential candi
date said present defense lead
ers have failed to develop this
nation's nuclear carrier and
submarine strength.
Nixon began his day on an ac
ademic note, speaking on the
campus of William and Mary
College near the restored old
town of Williamsburg, Va.,
where he called for "a new Spirit
of 76" to restore personal free
dom in America.
As he left the hall, about 100
young people, part of a crowd of
•1,500, waved banners, most with
slogans critical of him.
• LeMay: Wallace VP
PITTSBURGH (AP) — Third
iparty presidentin! candidate
George Wallace will name re
tired Air Force Gen. Curtis Le-
May as his running mate Thurs
day morning, sources close to
Wallace said Wed. night.
The blunt-talking, cigar-chew
ing "Old Ironpants" of World
War II flew into Pittsburgh late
in the afternoon, but he refused

to talk to reporters.
Later Wallace aides con
firmed that LoMay, 61, an advo
cate of military victory in Viet
nam, was Wallace's choice.
LeMay, father of the Strategic
Air Command and a famous fly
ing general, is an ardent de
fender of the airplane. He once
said guided missiles would nev
er replace manned planes as
weapons because missiles "can't
think."
Wallace was given a scream
ing, foot-stomping reception by
8,000 supporters in Pittsburgh's
Civic Arena, which borders on
the city's biggest Negro ghetto.
A group of 200 hecklers in the
balcony chanted "Wallace Go
Home! Wallace Go Home!"
throughout the speech. Once
Wallace walked away from the
rostrum, apparently disgusted,
then turned around, smiled at
the balcony and waved.
"Why don't you go home?" he
asked. "I hired the hall."
• Tigers Strike Out
ST. LOUIS (AP) — Bob Gib
son gave the Detroit Tigers
more breaks than they'd bar
gained for . . . and turned Wed
nesday's World Series opener
into a wholesale strike-out spree.
"I think I surprised them by
throwing so many breaking
pitches," the brilliant St. Louis
right-hander said after blanking
Detroit 4-0 and shattering San
dy Koufax' Series record with
17 strikeouts.
The unflappable Cardinal ace
made a mismatch of his her
alded duel with Denny McLain,
the Tigers' 31-game winner. He
scattered five hits and sent the
crowd of 54,692 —largest ever
for a baseball game in St. Louis
—into a frenzied uproar by fan
ning A 1 Kaline, Norm Cash and
Willie Horton in the ninth to
break Koufax' 1963 Series rec
ord of 15 strikeouts.
