## 'Nairobi' To Incorporate? 
### 
Last spring, when news came
out that East Palo Alto might
someday be renamed "Nairobi
West," most Bay Area residents
thought it was a put-on.
Today the "put-on" is close
to a reality.
The new name, now just plain
"Nairobi" rather than "Nairobi
West," is symbolic of a new ur

Mateo County Economic Oppor
tunities Commission.
The program is under the
auspices of VISTA, the domestic
peace corps, and a small group
of Stanford undergraduates and
members of the Stanford Busi
ness School.
These groups maintain that
before the unincorporated com
munity of East Palo Alto can
make reasonable strides toward
economic advancement the
whole system of government
must be radically changed.

must be organized into a munic

would be necessary for East
Palo Alto to become independent
of San Mateo County.
East Palo Alto, now with a
population of 22,500, is San
Mateo County's largest unin
corporated community and it has
outgrown this form of local gov

program claim.
