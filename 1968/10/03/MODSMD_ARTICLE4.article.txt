# Nixon Strength Reflected In Campus Political Strife
## 
### ANN DENTON 
If the membership in political
groups among Stanford stu
dents is any indication of the
November results, Richard M.
Nixon should be the thirty-sev
enth President of the United
States.
The Stanford Young Republi
cans (YR), traditionally the lar
gest Republican club west of the
Mississippi, signed up nearly 100
new members during Registra
tion. Their club, now totaling
150, is more than double the
size of "Stanford Students for
Humphrey," which claims 65
members.
Membership Blitz
Hoping to boost the club to
300 members, the YR's are de
vising a "membership blitz"
They plan to take a political
survey of all the dormitories
and fraternites and enroll will
ing Republicans as members.
Michael Kuhl, president of
Young Republicans, stresses to
prospective members that YR
includes a "politically wide
spectrum."
"The Young Republicans as a
club endorse all of the Republi
can Party's nominees; however,
the amount of support that an
individual member gives to a
candidate depends upon his own
preferences," Kuhl said.
One member put it oven more
bluntly. At the registration ta

ble the bumper stickers support
ing Max Rafferty were turned
upside down. Questioned, the
member answered, "Not an aw
ful lot of us are enthusiastic
about Rafferty."
There seems to be a great
deal of enthusiasm for Nixon,
though. The consensus among
YR members is that Nixon is
gaining wide support on cam
pus.
Humphrey Potential
Humphrey fans unhappily
agree. John Endriz, president of
Stanford Students for Humph
rey, points out, however, that
"the potential for Humphrey on
campus seems greater than it
was for Kennedy."
Endriz has a two-fold purpose
for his club. The first is to make
the Stanford community recog
nize that "there is a very defi
nite choice to be made between
the two candidates." The mem
bers plan to accomplish this by
publicizing Humphrey's past
record and future programs.
Humphrey's "liberal legisla
tion" includes proposals for
Medicare, the Job Corps and the
Peace Corps, and acting as spon
sor for the Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty and Floor Manager of
the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
The second purpose of his
club is "to effectively canvass
the mid-peninsula area to locate
votes."

Hoping to boost the club to
300 members, the YR's are de
vising a "membership blitz"
They plan to take a political
survey of all the dormitories
and fraternites and enroll will
ing Republicans as members.
Michael Kuhl, president of
Young Republicans, stresses to
prospective members that YR
includes a "politically wide
spectrum."
"The Young Republicans as a
club endorse all of the Republi
can Party's nominees; however,
the amount of support that an
individual member gives to a
candidate depends upon his own
preferences," Kuhl said.
One member put it oven more
bluntly. At the registration ta

ble the bumper stickers support
ing Max Rafferty were turned
upside down. Questioned, the
member answered, "Not an aw
ful lot of us are enthusiastic
about Rafferty."
There seems to be a great
deal of enthusiasm for Nixon,
though. The consensus among
YR members is that Nixon is
gaining wide support on cam
pus.
Humphrey Potential
Humphrey fans unhappily
agree. John Endriz, president of
Stanford Students for Humph
rey, points out, however, that
"the potential for Humphrey on
campus seems greater than it
was for Kennedy."
Endriz has a two-fold purpose
for his club. The first is to make
the Stanford community recog
nize that "there is a very defi
nite choice to be made between
the two candidates." The mem
bers plan to accomplish this by
publicizing Humphrey's past
record and future programs.
Humphrey's "liberal legisla
tion" includes proposals for
Medicare, the Job Corps and the
Peace Corps, and acting as spon
sor for the Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty and Floor Manager of
the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
The second purpose of his
club is "to effectively canvass
the mid-peninsula area to locate
votes."
If the membership in political
groups among Stanford stu
dents is any indication of the
November results, Richard M.
Nixon should be the thirty-sev
enth President of the United
States.
The Stanford Young Republi
cans (YR), traditionally the lar
gest Republican club west of the
Mississippi, signed up nearly 100
new members during Registra
tion. Their club, now totaling
150, is more than double the
size of "Stanford Students for
Humphrey," which claims 65
members.
