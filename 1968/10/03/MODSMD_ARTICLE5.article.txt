### 
MEXICO CITY (AP)â€” Strik
ing students, some armed with
automatic weapons, battled
army troops and police close to
downtown Mexico City Wednes
day night in the bloodiest out
burst against the government of
President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz.
Dozens of buses, trolley cars
and automobiles burned in the
streets.
News correspondents and oth
er witnesses at the battle scene
reported at least a score of per
sons killed and hundreds wound
ed.
The battle was the latest and
probably the worst outbreak in
a series of demonstrations, oc
casionally marked by violence,
by students objecting to what
they say is government repres
sion.
Gen. Marcelino Garcia Barra
gan, the defense secretary, said
he had orders to crush the stu
dent uprising at any cost.
The battle, the result of nine
weeks of struggle against the
government, cast a shadow over
the 1968 Olympic Games due to
open here Oct. 12.
Soldiers Killed
Garcia said there were deaths
on both sides but he declined to
say how many. He reported,
however, one army corporal was
killed and 12 other army men
wounded.
The battle started with a stu
dent clash with police. The army
entered the fighting from build
ings, Garcia said.
Late in the evening the shoot
ing died down but sporadic gun
fire was heard in the battle area.
Students Armed
Trolleys, buses and automo

biles were reported set afire by
roving gangs of students armed
with 22-caliber automatic pis
tols made in Mexico.
An Associated Press photog
rapher reported seeing "many"
bodies in the Plaza of the Three
Cultures," just blocks away
from the downtown area, of per
sons shot down in an exchange
of automatic gunfire. Another
Associated Press man saw at
least two civilians killed and 10
wounded in front of the Foreign
Ministry.
All the victims had been hold
ing their hands aloft while army
troops held them at gunpoint.
Troops in armored cars op
ened up with machine guns on
student snipers, and gangs of
youths roamed streets, shooting
and throwing gasoline bombs.
Prisoner Held
An American cameraman said
a motorcycle policeman was shot
dead at his side. The photogra
pher, Carl Sorenson of Colum
bia Broadcasting System, said
troops smashed his camera and
held him prisoner for more than
an hour.
Thousands of persons were
said to have been arrested in
Wednesday's disorders.
The dead were reported to in
clude soldiers, students and by
standers who had been trapped
in the battle. Women and chil
dren were reported among the
wounded.
The fighting tapered off to
sporadic incidents after about
two hours. It broke out after
student leaders, faced with a
massive deployment of troops
and armor, called off a sched
uled protest march.
