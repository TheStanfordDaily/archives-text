# Residence Menus Still List Grapes
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
University residences contin
ue to serve California table
grapes, ignoring a nationwide
voluntary freeze on grape pur
chases.
The grape controversy arises
over the attempts of central val
ley grape pickers to organize
unions for the purpose of pro
tecting workers' interests.
Many farm owners have re
fused to recognize the United
Farm Workers' attempt to un
ionize, since these workers are
not covered under national labor
laws.
Presidential candidate Hubert
Humphrey has endorsed the ef
forts of the boycotters, led by
organizer Caesar Chavez. Candi
date Richard Nixon is opposed
to the boycott of the California
fruit.
Food Service Director William
Myers acknowledged yesterday
that University dormitory food
services are not adhering to the
boycott.
Continue To Buy
"We are still buying grapes,"
Myers stated. "And we will con
tinue to do so unless our resi
dents let us know they no long
er want them."
Myers explained that his fruit
distributor purchases grapes
from six different companies,
three of which are unionized
and three which are not. Pur
chases hover around 100 pounds
per week, Myers added.
Myers stated that he "would
be glad to hear from residents
if they no longer want them."
He said he would take grapes off
dormitory menus if he heard
from a "reasonable number" of
students through any form of
acceptable protest.
Petition Circulated
A resident in Roble Hall re
ported that over one third of
the coed dormitory's residents
have signed a petition asking
that table grapes be removed
from Roble's menu.
Residents in Wilbur Hall also
declared that the food service di
rector in the 800-man dormitory
complex had ceased to order
grapes following complaints
from several students.
Myers stated that he would
confront the grape issue no dif
ferently than any other part of
his services' menu. "If for any
reason residents don't want
some item served, let them say
so. We won't change our policy
over the complaints of only a
few students."
Taking No Stand
Myers made clear that he was
taking no moral stand. "I don't
understand why the boycott is
necessary. .. . It's so confusing."

He added that he was not aware
of the political problems in
volved in the boycott.
He indicated that at some
time he might take a stand on
the issue, but claimed that he
was not versed in all aspects of
the problem at present.
Associate Dean of Students
Willard Wyman admitted that
he had contacted Myers about
the serving of grapes earlier,
but that they were agreed that
the food seryices should comply
with residents' wishes.
Let Students Control
"This is a perfect opportunity
for education and student initia
tive," Wyman claimed. "To
make a unilateral decision
would be another form of in lo
co parentis.
"The idea is to let students
control the decision," Wyman
continued. "This would be a per
fect chance to discuss union and
labor problems."

A resident in Roble Hall re
ported that over one third of
the coed dormitory's residents
have signed a petition asking
that table grapes be removed
from Roble's menu.
Residents in Wilbur Hall also
declared that the food service di
rector in the 800-man dormitory
complex had ceased to order
grapes following complaints
from several students.
Myers stated that he would
confront the grape issue no dif
ferently than any other part of
his services' menu. "If for any
reason residents don't want
some item served, let them say
so. We won't change our policy
over the complaints of only a
few students."
Taking No Stand
Myers made clear that he was
taking no moral stand. "I don't
understand why the boycott is
necessary. .. . It's so confusing."

He added that he was not aware
of the political problems in
volved in the boycott.
He indicated that at some
time he might take a stand on
the issue, but claimed that he
was not versed in all aspects of
the problem at present.
Associate Dean of Students
Willard Wyman admitted that
he had contacted Myers about
the serving of grapes earlier,
but that they were agreed that
the food seryices should comply
with residents' wishes.
Let Students Control
"This is a perfect opportunity
for education and student initia
tive," Wyman claimed. "To
make a unilateral decision
would be another form of in lo
co parentis.
"The idea is to let students
control the decision," Wyman
continued. "This would be a per
fect chance to discuss union and
labor problems."

Continue To Buy
"We are still buying grapes,"

Myers explained that his fruit

three of which are unionized
and three which are not. Pur

per week, Myers added.
Myers stated that he "would
be glad to hear from residents
if they no longer want them."
He said he would take grapes off
dormitory menus if he heard
from a "reasonable number" of
students through any form of
acceptable protest.
