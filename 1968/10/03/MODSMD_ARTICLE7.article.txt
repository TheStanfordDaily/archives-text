# Group Questions ROTC Credits
## 
### 
The question of academic cre
dit for ROTC will receive its
first public airing this afternoon
at 3:30 in the Tresidder Large
Lounge.
ASSU Vice President Vic von
Schlegell has invited five faculty
members to participate in the
discussion: Asst. Prof. Anne T.
Kostelanetz, Marine Col. Robprt
L. Thomas, head of Navy ROTC,
Prof. Robert MacAfee Brown,
Vice Provost Howard Brooks,
and Asst. Prof. Barton Bern
stein.
Miss Kostelanetz is co-author
of a proposal introduced at last
week's Academic Senate meet
ing advocating that Academic
Credit not be given for incom
ing classes enrolled in ROTC.
Since then the matter has been
referred to an ad hoc committee
for its final recommendation
â€¢which will announced before
January 15.
Col. Thomas has recently re
leased a position paper in con
junction with the heads of the

two other military science de
partments. They stated their be
lief that "the vital question at
stake goes beyond course credit,
academic privilege, or teacher
qualifiications."
"They said the question is
whether or not civilian academic
institutions are willing to par
ticipate, in cooperation with the
military, in providing well-edu
cated officers to lead and man
age vital segments of our na
tion's defenses."
Prof. Brown has indicated that
he will not "come into this meet
ing as one with unequivocal con
clusions." He added that presen
tations of the panel members
might well aid him in reaching
more definite conclusions.
In addition to the question of
academic credit, Brown is con
cerned about Stanford's associ
ation with the military. He op
poses the Vietnam war and this
view contributes to his reserva
tions about having JtOTC on
campus.
