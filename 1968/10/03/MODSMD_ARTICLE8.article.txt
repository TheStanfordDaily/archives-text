# Funds Cut
## Marine Biology Suffers 
### DAVID LISCHINSKY 
Stanford's national teaching
and research program in bio
logical oceanography has be
come a casualty of Congression
al budget cuts affecting research
grants. The program, which be
gan in 1963 and was supported
by grants from the National
Science Foundation, consisted of
oceanographic research aboard
Stanford's 135-foot schooner, the
Te Vega.
The cut, amounting to almost
45 per cent of the previous
year's $800,000 grant, will neces
sitate a less costly program of
shipboard research. Students
and faculty will be recruited
primarily from Stanford, rather
than from institutions through
out the U.S. and abroad. The
ship's present expedition from
Guayaquil, Ecuador back to
Monterey will be her last under
the current plan.
Prrofessor Malvern Gilmartin
of Stanford's Hopkins Marine
Station announced the cutback.
However, he expressed great en
thusiasm for the revised pro
gram. The new program, al
though restricted in its scope,
will permit a close rapport with
shore-based research at the Ma
rine Station, according to Pro
fessor Donald Kennedy, head of

Biological Sciences at Stanford.
Under the old program, stu
dents earned 15 units of aca
demic credit during the 10-week
expeditions.
The Te Vega's current 20th
expedition sailed from Guaya
quil on September 16. Aboard

are ten students, three faculty
members, and two assistants, in
addition to a professional cap
tain and a crew of 15. The sci
entists are exploring marine life
and food chains in deep waters
of the eastern tropical Pacific,
from Peru to Mexico.
