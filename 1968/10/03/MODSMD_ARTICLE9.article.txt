Ik litor, The Daily:
The last thing I'd want to argue is that this is
an age of creative innovations in visual commu
nication. It's only natural, and even right, that
the Daily wants to get into the innovating field.
But, God! Has the Daily ever blown it again!
Times were when the editorial content of the
paper was nauseating enough. But now, the vis
ual content is equally disgusting. 111-thought-out
logos, headlines, etc., executed with complete lack
of care, finesse, and regard for the readers' intel
ligence, have reduced the over-all appearance of
the Daily to the same level of childish scrawlings
that has so long characterized its writing.
All the good intentions in the world cannot
produce a visually effective work when the exe
cutor apparently doesn't care enough to make his
final result pleasing to the eye. One can hardly
resist making the conclusion that the supposed
craftsman not only cannot tell a guide line from
a speedball pen, but also he produces his atroci
ties with eyes shut.
Grow up! The medium of visual communica
tion has already grown too far for the Daily to
,try bringing about a retrogression. i
