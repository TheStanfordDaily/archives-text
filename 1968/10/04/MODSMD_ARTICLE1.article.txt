# Vote On Cleaver
## UC Senate Takes Vague Stand 
### 
The Berkeley Academic Senate
voted Thursday night to go
ahead with plans to hold the con
troversial "Social Analysis"
counrse with Eldridge Cleaver as
a lecturer.
However, some disagreement
arose over the wording of the
faculty resolution. As passed by
the Senate, the resolution directs
"the committee on courses to
take all steps to encourage
course and credit status for that
program."
However, the resolution also
included a passage that the
course would be held in accord
ance with university regulations.
The conflict arises because the
Regents' decision not to allow
Cleaver to lecture ten times is
a University "regulation".
Whether the faculty meant to

defy the Regents' ruling was not
clear late last night. If enforced,
the Regents' ruling would only
allow Cleaver one lecture per
quarter.
Students at the Daily Californ
ian, the student paper, reported
last night that the Academic
Senate's decision had left many
students "in shock." A rally in
favor of Cleaver's lecturing is
expected on Monday.
In Berkeley yesterday Cleaver
wcund up a speech to a crowd
of 5,000 on the campus by lead
ing a yell, featuring an obscenity
aimed at Gov. Ronald Reagan.
Only a portion of the audience
joined the 33-year-old ex-convict
and advocate of black militancy
in repeatedly voicing the four
letter word with Reagan's name.

Standing on the Sproul Hall
steps, Cleaver told the outdoor
rally: "I'm going to have to
come here and deliver 30 to 40
lectures and tell them. There
are more people in this country
than there are pigs."

Cleaver applies the term
"pigs" to police, Reagan and
Max Rafferty, Republican can
didate for the U.S. Senate in
California.
In San Francisco, Rafferty
told a news conference that
Cleaver, who served a prison

term for attempted assault in
Los Angeles, was "a graduate
of San Quentin." Rafferty said
is would be "asinine and stupid"
to allow Cleaver to lecture at
UC, saying Cleaver resorted to
obscenities because of his lim
ited vocabulary.

Senate's decision had left many
students "in shock." A rally in
favor of Cleaver's lecturing is
expected on Monday.
In Berkeley yesterday Cleaver
wcund up a speech to a crowd
of 5,000 on the campus by lead
ing a yell, featuring an obscenity
aimed at Gov. Ronald Reagan.
Only a portion of the audience
joined the 33-year-old ex-convict
and advocate of black militancy
in repeatedly voicing the four
letter word with Reagan's name.

Standing on the Sproul Hall
steps, Cleaver told the outdoor
rally: "I'm going to have to
come here and deliver 30 to 40
lectures and tell them. There
are more people in this country
than there are pigs."

Cleaver applies the term
"pigs" to police, Reagan and
Max Rafferty, Republican can
didate for the U.S. Senate in
California.
In San Francisco, Rafferty
told a news conference that
Cleaver, who served a prison

term for attempted assault in
Los Angeles, was "a graduate
of San Quentin." Rafferty said
is would be "asinine and stupid"
to allow Cleaver to lecture at
UC, saying Cleaver resorted to
obscenities because of his lim
ited vocabulary.
