Red edl cation of "Battle Hymn
of Republic," presented to
The American Legion, Leyden-
Chiles-Wichersham Post No. 1,
Denver Colorado, by Maury
Travis.
The nation's fighting youth are
now marching for The Lord;
Who wakens up the heartbeats
where our patriots' hopes have
searched;
The Free World is in danger so
unsheath avenging sword:
MANKIND IS MARCHING
ON.
Humanity is fighting now in
fields of Vietnam;
There is no security for those
whose peace is balm.
The terror of the jungle for who
fights and then is gone:
OUR VOW IS MARCHING
ON.
Wake up young people from
your sanctuary towers;
The battle is never won in your
intellectual bowers;
You, too, must lift the banner
of our precious liberty:
OUR OATH IS MARCHING
ON.
The history of aggression leaves
no peace for you to lose;
The challenge of Life's suffering
—the ardor you must choose;
Each generation fights to win
Man's freedom holy words:
OUR SOUL IS MARCHING
ON.
