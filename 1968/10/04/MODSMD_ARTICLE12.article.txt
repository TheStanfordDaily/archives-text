Deeply intent upon maintain
ing his grasp on the middle of
the road in the 1968 Presidential
campaign, third party candidate,
George C. Wallace has finally
selected a running-mate.
The choice of General Curtis
E. LeMay for the second spot
on the ticket of the American
Independent Party climaxed an
extended period of desperation
and speculation.
Before the formal announce
ment was made, LeMay was seen
stepping off a plane in Pitts
burgh with a Wallace official at
his side, virtually killing the
chances of other prominently
mentioned individuals including
John Lindsay and Eldridge
Cleaver.
To say that Wallace's selection
of LeMay was an easy one is
to infinitely simplify the matter.
Wallace was in fact reluctant to
cast a militaristic note on a
campaign of peace and justice.
He and his closest aides feared
that he would be compromising
his dovish stance on the issue of
Vietnam.
LeMay, on the other hand, had
addressed himself to the war is
sue, saying that he would bomb
North Vietnam back to the Stone
Age. While Wallace clearly re
garded such thinking as com
mendable and consistent with
his approach to America's do
mestic situation, the former Ala
bama governor did not appear
ready to take the same measures
in foreign policy.
Wallace was still uneasy after
he announced LeMay's selection
for his running-mate. A highly
perceptive general, LeMay rec
ognized this uneasiness and, ap
pealing to his party's standard
bearer, quickly stated that the
nuclear warhead is "just an
other weapon in the American
arsenal."
Experts agreed that Wallace
was greatly relieved by this

statement, not so much in regard
to the war in Vietnam, but be
cause of the implied mandate
to use the bomb in the ghettos
should he decide to launch an
other war on poverty.
At a later press conference
LeMay was asked whether he
could overcome the handicap of
being a political unknown. He
replied that once his position on
nuclear weapons was generally
known, he expected his support
to mushroom considerably.
As it now stands, Wallace's
decision has been made, and he
can only wait and allow it to
be judged. Wallace will undoubt
edly emphasize that inspite of
LeMay's reactionary views, the
general is still only a member
of the team and a full heartbeat
away from the head of the plan
tation.

LeMay's reactionary views, the
general is still only a member
of the team and a full heartbeat
away from the head of the plan
tation.
Deeply intent upon maintain
ing his grasp on the middle of
the road in the 1968 Presidential
campaign, third party candidate,
George C. Wallace has finally
selected a running-mate.
The choice of General Curtis
E. LeMay for the second spot
on the ticket of the American
Independent Party climaxed an
extended period of desperation
and speculation.
Before the formal announce
ment was made, LeMay was seen
stepping off a plane in Pitts
burgh with a Wallace official at
his side, virtually killing the
chances of other prominently
mentioned individuals including
John Lindsay and Eldridge
Cleaver.
To say that Wallace's selection
of LeMay was an easy one is
to infinitely simplify the matter.
Wallace was in fact reluctant to
cast a militaristic note on a
campaign of peace and justice.
He and his closest aides feared
that he would be compromising
his dovish stance on the issue of
Vietnam.
LeMay, on the other hand, had
addressed himself to the war is
sue, saying that he would bomb
North Vietnam back to the Stone
Age. While Wallace clearly re
garded such thinking as com
mendable and consistent with
his approach to America's do
mestic situation, the former Ala
bama governor did not appear
ready to take the same measures
in foreign policy.
Wallace was still uneasy after
he announced LeMay's selection
for his running-mate. A highly
perceptive general, LeMay rec
ognized this uneasiness and, ap
pealing to his party's standard
bearer, quickly stated that the
nuclear warhead is "just an
other weapon in the American
arsenal."
Experts agreed that Wallace
was greatly relieved by this

statement, not so much in regard
to the war in Vietnam, but be
cause of the implied mandate
to use the bomb in the ghettos
should he decide to launch an
other war on poverty.
At a later press conference
LeMay was asked whether he
could overcome the handicap of
being a political unknown. He
replied that once his position on
nuclear weapons was generally
known, he expected his support
to mushroom considerably.
As it now stands, Wallace's
decision has been made, and he
can only wait and allow it to
be judged. Wallace will undoubt
edly emphasize that inspite of
LeMay's reactionary views, the
general is still only a member
of the team and a full heartbeat
away from the head of the plan
tation.
