# Have I Ever Lied To You?
## Hecklers Meet 
### ART BUCHWALD 
Heckling of speakers has be
come such a big thing on college
campuses these days that it has
been decided to hold an Inter
collegiate Hecklers Conference
in the near future.
The man behind it is Hiram
Bullhorn, who had come to
Washington to arrange for
speakers who could be heckled
at the conference.
"We were hoping to get Pres
ident Johnson," Hiram said, "but
we may have to settle for Hu
bert Humphrey and Gen. Her
shey."
"What do you intend to do at
the conference?"
"We want to exchange ideas
on heckling, discuss new meth
ods of jeering and hooting and
see if we can find ways of shed
ding more heat and less light
on the basic issues of the day."
"How do you intend to con
duct the conference?"
"We'll break it down into sem
inars. One group will discuss
'heckling from the balcony,' an
other 'heckling from the floor,'
and a third, for graduate stu
dents, will devote itself to 'what
to do if you can grab the mike.'
"We will also hold a session
on 'new jeers' and classes In
'dirty sign painting.' And we
shall probably devote an entire
afternoon to 'what to do about
antiheckling.' "
"What do you mean by 'anti
heckling'?"
"Well, for some time hecklers
were permitted to heckle with
out being interrupted. But late
ly the speakers have been heck
ling the hecklers. Muskie has
been embarrassing students by

giving them time to state their
cases. Humphrey has been hoot
ing at kids in the balcony. Wal
lace tells the TV men to turn
their cameras on the hecklers to
embarrass them, and even Nix
on has been using hecklers to
get sympathy for himself.
"This antiheckling behavior of
the speakers has caused a great
deal of resentment among acti
vist students and is a violation
of the First Amendment, which
guarantees to all citizens the
right to hoot and jeer without
fear of having to listen to what
someone has to say."
"But what can you do about
it?"
"We will probably call for leg
islation to make antiheckling il
legal, and we shall train student
leaders in anti-antiheckling tech
niques. This will include cutting
off microphones, the use of lar
ger hand megaphones and the
escalation of catcalling. If we
can't stop someone from speak
ing without their answering
back, then free speech in this
country has come to a sorry
pass."
"I couldn't agree with you
more. Where will you hold your
first hecklers' convention?"
"Everyone wants it. Berkeley
has asked for it; Columbia has
lobbied for it; Madison, Wis.
says they'll host it; but we think
the only place to have a conven
tion in this country is Chicago.
For one thing, they have the
best facilities for hecklers, and
for another, after all the unfor
tunate publicity Mayor Daley
got after the Democratic con
vention, he deserves the busi
ness."

"What do you intend to do at
the conference?"
"We want to exchange ideas
on heckling, discuss new meth
ods of jeering and hooting and
see if we can find ways of shed
ding more heat and less light
on the basic issues of the day."
"How do you intend to con
duct the conference?"
"We'll break it down into sem
inars. One group will discuss
'heckling from the balcony,' an
other 'heckling from the floor,'
and a third, for graduate stu
dents, will devote itself to 'what
to do if you can grab the mike.'
"We will also hold a session
on 'new jeers' and classes In
'dirty sign painting.' And we
shall probably devote an entire
afternoon to 'what to do about
antiheckling.' "
"What do you mean by 'anti
heckling'?"
"Well, for some time hecklers
were permitted to heckle with
out being interrupted. But late
ly the speakers have been heck
ling the hecklers. Muskie has
been embarrassing students by

giving them time to state their
cases. Humphrey has been hoot
ing at kids in the balcony. Wal
lace tells the TV men to turn
their cameras on the hecklers to
embarrass them, and even Nix
on has been using hecklers to
get sympathy for himself.
"This antiheckling behavior of
the speakers has caused a great
deal of resentment among acti
vist students and is a violation
of the First Amendment, which
guarantees to all citizens the
right to hoot and jeer without
fear of having to listen to what
someone has to say."
"But what can you do about
it?"
"We will probably call for leg
islation to make antiheckling il
legal, and we shall train student
leaders in anti-antiheckling tech
niques. This will include cutting
off microphones, the use of lar
ger hand megaphones and the
escalation of catcalling. If we
can't stop someone from speak
ing without their answering
back, then free speech in this
country has come to a sorry
pass."
"I couldn't agree with you
more. Where will you hold your
first hecklers' convention?"
"Everyone wants it. Berkeley
has asked for it; Columbia has
lobbied for it; Madison, Wis.
says they'll host it; but we think
the only place to have a conven
tion in this country is Chicago.
For one thing, they have the
best facilities for hecklers, and
for another, after all the unfor
tunate publicity Mayor Daley
got after the Democratic con
vention, he deserves the busi
ness."
Heckling of speakers has be
come such a big thing on college
campuses these days that it has
been decided to hold an Inter
collegiate Hecklers Conference
in the near future.
The man behind it is Hiram
Bullhorn, who had come to
Washington to arrange for
speakers who could be heckled
at the conference.
"We were hoping to get Pres
ident Johnson," Hiram said, "but
we may have to settle for Hu
bert Humphrey and Gen. Her
shey."
