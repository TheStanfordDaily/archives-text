Dale Harris. HOME FIRES BURNING. 147 op. Macmlllan. $4.95.
This is a short novel, and I have a prejudice for short novels. It
is also by a colleague and friend, and I'm not so sure that I have
a prejudice for that kind.
It's all very well for Mailer and Styron to write novels; they're
supposed to, and one doesn't know them anyway. Colleagues are
different, especially certified scholars who are therefore not (we
all know) ideally suited for these high creative enterprises.
But I suppose these mixed feelings cancel themselves out. So this
will be (count on it) an objective review.
Dale Harris' Home Fires Burning is a very, very good novel.
Some of the advertising copy on the jacket can be discounted.
This is not a "sexual inferno." The home fires of sexuality that burn
in London and mingle with the fires of war scarcely breach the
darkness and do not consume.
The most frightful things happen, but passion is mainly reserved
for the black market sweets and biscuits and anchovies that the
characters are so avid for. Another sexual inferno would be a bit
of a bore. This book is much more.
It is about Oxley, wounded early in the war, put back together
(so far as can be) by the surgeons, equipped with a new face, dis
charged from the army, and having to make a go of it — as the
colonel who releases him says in "civvy street." But civvy street
is rubble.
Oxley was at Cambridge before the war and the colonel asks if
he will go back. " 'I'll have to see what it's like before making up
my mind. Look around me, sir.' Oxley closed his eyes for a mo
ment. 'I'll have to see. But not Cambridge, sir: I think it's past
that now.' "
It is past that; there is nothing to do but look around.
Oxley goes to visit his mother in Salisbury — where even the
cathedral spire has somehow been altered by the war; it "looked
odd" above the wartime vegetable gardens — and finds the past
altogether beyond his reach. Like the picaresque hero that h" is.
Oxley heads for the big city: London. What he does, when he gets
there, is still to look around.
Oxley becomes an entrepreneur of sweets and sex, and when
it comes to sex, he keeps a close eye on the product. He is "con
demned to watch," to watch a girl raped because he has contrived it,
to watch London burn.
The point of view is Oxley's throughout, and Harris dramatizes
moral issues that are also artistic and philosophic. How far is the
observer "responsible" for what happens "before his eyes"? Does
he create it?
Oxley, with a face not his own, is almost a faceless hero; his
point of view mainly a point of view.
This is a Jamesian novel of terror, and the source of the terror
is not the impenetrability of experience so much as the imprevious
ness (to us) of its interpreter. Even in pain and despair, Oxley is
a kind of god, condemned to be what he is by other gods, still more
remote, beyond.
And he recedes from us as the novel goes on. If there is a doubt
ful note anywhere, it is near the end. Oxley finds the girls and tells
her, twice: "'I only watched!'" Perhaps the note is struck too
loudly. But after so much reserve, so much meticulous care, the
exclamation point incorporates all that has not been said.
iWth its reddish whorehouse glare, the novel is a chiaroscuro of
dark and light, blackouts and the burning of London, moral dark
ness lit up every so often, and ever so faintly, by a kind of per
verse decency, Oxley's and others'.
One of the women who takes part in the sexual encounter (I'd
say "orgy," (but the term really won't do) when the girl is raped
tells Oxley afterwards to get the girl some brandy. He pretends not
to have watched. " 'Oh, yes. I'll bring some up directly. Nothing
bad, is it?'" She says: " 'Passed out, poor thing.'"
It is monstrous, but we believe that "poor thing."
In the end a raid destroys the house where it has all taken placo,
and Oxley, once more, watches. As the light of the fires dies away,
he sees that there is nothing left — of the house, of the square,
of himself — "to reclaim." There is no purgation. Destruction is
destruction, and that's that.
But still, "poor thing," poor things. Pity and terror, both are there,
and we should not insist pedantically or pruriently, upon a catharsis.
