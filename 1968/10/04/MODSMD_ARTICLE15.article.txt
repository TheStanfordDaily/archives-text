# Playing Right Field
## The
						National Interest 
### RAYMOND R. WHITE 
A pamphlet entitled "Chan
neling" was widely distributed
during registration. Except for
the illustration, this was an un
edited replication of an official
Selective Service System (SSS)
document which has since been
withdrawn.
It "explained" that careful
planning on the part of the SSS
could put pressure on young men
and influence their choice of
profession in the best interests
of the national defense.
Two reasons for this docu
ment's discontinuation are clear.
First it quite rightly outraged
people, and second it misrepre
sented the purpose and the
power of the SSS. The idea that
the government can more effi
ciently plan for national defense
by superceding the free enter
prise system in channeling peo
ple into various professions is
nonsense.
The purpose of the SSS is to
decide which men should be
drafted. This is its only legiti
mate function. Since only ten to
twenty per cent of draft-age men
are needed in most years, deci
sions have to be made as to
who is and who is not to be
drafted.
It has been established that

the men who are least necessary
to the overall potential military
strength of the nation are the
ones who are drafted first. The
whole system is based upon
priorities rather than absolutes.
The employee of a defense
firm, the employee of a back-up
industry, and so on down to the
student are all deferred. The de
ferments reflect the awareness
of the SSS that the future as
well as the present military
strength of the nation must be
considered.
The better educated person is
almost certain to represent a
greater direct or indirect source
of military strength than the un
educated person. At the same
time the skills of the educated
are unlikely to be directly use
ful to the armed forces. The in
vestment which has been made
in the education of a man will
prove more worthwhile in the
civilian sector of the economy.
So it is the person whose edu
cation ceases early who is draft
ed. The exception to this rule is
now the first and second year
graduate student, and I feel
that the SSS is wrong in its
discontinuation of graduate de
ferments.
The less educated person is
more likely to benefit from the

skills which the mi'itary does
provide and from its discipline
The unskilled person (and the
economy) loses less than the
skilled person when drafted.
The fact that discrimination
has kept Negroes in the lower
economic - educational groups
which more frequently fall prey
to the draft does not change
the fact that the military actual
ly offers a comparative oppor
tunity for these people. There
is less discrimination in the arm
ed services than elsewhere in
America, and virtually none on
the front line.
The opportunity should be
taken advantage of. No under
privileged person should emerge
from the service without some
gain.
With the major exception of
the recent failure to defer some
graduate students the SSS op
erates to draft those persons
least productive militarily and
those best able to benefit from
military training.
