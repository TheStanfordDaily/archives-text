# Shuck You Not
## Wall Street Love-In 
### DICK GREGORY 
I have often insisted that
America is faced with a pollu
tion crisis. And I do not mean
air or wator pollution. The most
pressing problem in America to
day is moral pollution
National hypocrisy reached its
most pronounced proportions a
couple of weeks ago in the eco
nomic center of America, the
Wall Street area of New York
City. For days word had been
circulating through the lunch
hour crowd that at precisely 1:28
p.m., a shapely girl in a tight
sweater wou'd ascend the steps
of BMT srbway station near
the New York Stock Exchange
and walk to work at the Chem
ical Bank New York Trust Com
pany on Broadway.
Every day the crowd of on
lookers grew larger. They gath
ered to gawk at 5-feet 4-inch,

21-year-old Francine Gottfried,
an IBM machine operator. Miss
Gottfried's measurements of 43-
25-37 became much more im
portant to the Wall Street busi
ness community than the Dow
average.
On September 20 more than
5,000 brokers, bankers and beige
jacketed Stock Exchange clerks
mobbed four comers of
Broad and WaU streets in ad
vance of Miss Gottfield's appear
ance. She was a few minutes
late. At 1:34 p.m. wh-n she
nmerged from the Broad Street
'subway station, crowds were
so thick that hundreds of
passTs-by were shoved against
buildings. Traffic was stopped.
People stood on cars to get a
better view of her intoxicating
measurements and some of the
cars were damaged.
Plainclothes poHce wre wait
ing to protect Miss Gottfield
from the un'awful assembly.
They escorted her safely to work
as the eager mob followed.
The incident received thorough
newspaper and television cover

age. Next the crowds tripled.
More blocking of traffic. More
'• 1 am age to parked cars. But no
Miss Tottfield. Her civil rights
wre so obvio' sly threatened
that it was no longer safe for
her to go to work.
No arrests were made. Police
did not wade into the crowd with
nightsticks nor did they make
an effort to disperse the as
sembly.
The campaign cry for law and
ord'T was publicly mocked and
exposed as the hypocrisy it is.
The Wall Street crowd far out
numbered the peace demonstra
tors in Chicago or the student
protesters at Columbia Univer
sity. It wis a assembly
which displayed open contempt
for traffic regulations and dam
aged personal property.
When a nation shows more
tolerance and respect for crowds
gathered to look upon a women
with Inst than for citizens as
sembled to insist that the de
mands of love and justice be
come incorporated into national
policy, that nation is insane.

sweater wou'd ascend the steps
of BMT srbway station near
the New York Stock Exchange
and walk to work at the Chem

Every day the crowd of on
lookers grew larger. They gath
ered to gawk at 5-feet 4-inch,

21-year-old Francine Gottfried,
an IBM machine operator. Miss
Gottfried's measurements of 43-
25-37 became much more im
portant to the Wall Street busi
ness community than the Dow
average.
On September 20 more than
5,000 brokers, bankers and beige
jacketed Stock Exchange clerks
mobbed four comers of
Broad and WaU streets in ad
vance of Miss Gottfield's appear
ance. She was a few minutes
late. At 1:34 p.m. wh-n she
nmerged from the Broad Street
'subway station, crowds were
so thick that hundreds of
passTs-by were shoved against
buildings. Traffic was stopped.
People stood on cars to get a
better view of her intoxicating
measurements and some of the
cars were damaged.
Plainclothes poHce wre wait

from the un'awful assembly.
They escorted her safely to work
as the eager mob followed.

newspaper and television cover

Miss Tottfield. Her civil rights
wre so obvio' sly threatened
that it was no longer safe for
her to go to work.
No arrests were made. Police
did not wade into the crowd with
nightsticks nor did they make
an effort to disperse the as

The campaign cry for law and
ord'T was publicly mocked and
exposed as the hypocrisy it is.
The Wall Street crowd far out
numbered the peace demonstra
tors in Chicago or the student
protesters at Columbia Univer
sity. It wis a assembly
which displayed open contempt
for traffic regulations and dam
aged personal property.
When a nation shows more
tolerance and respect for crowds
gathered to look upon a women
with Inst than for citizens as
sembled to insist that the de
mands of love and justice be
come incorporated into national
policy, that nation is insane.
I have often insisted that
America is faced with a pollu

air or wator pollution. The most
pressing problem in America to
day is moral pollution
National hypocrisy reached its
most pronounced proportions a
couple of weeks ago in the eco
nomic center of America, the
Wall Street area of New York
City. For days word had been
circulating through the lunch
hour crowd that at precisely 1:28
p.m., a shapely girl in a tight
