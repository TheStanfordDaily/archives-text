# Peninsula Observer
## Presents New View 
### LANG ATWOOD 
"We had a coup today," said
Peninsula Observer Editor David
Ransom, "the Palo Alto Times
city desk called us for the first
time for information!"
This is the gulf that separates
the independent, radical, bi
weekly Peninsula Observer from
Palo Alto's only daily newspaper,
the Times.
The Observer exists because
people opposing the "power
structures" at Stanford and in
Palo Alto feel that the Times and
its sister paper the Redwood
City Tribune constitute a monop
oly in the area and do not have
fair or balanced news coverage.
Marlene Charyn, one of the
Observer's 14 non-salaried edit
ors, observed that the paper was
serving the progressive commu
nity — "everybody" — radical,
left and liberal who feels that
part of the failure of the demo
cratic process is due to monoply
press.
She feels that the P.A. Times
has slanted stories favoring the
controlling interests of Palo
Alto, the wealthy businessmen.
"We're more honest about the
news," stated Miss Charyn.
"They're supporting the status
quo, we're attacking it."
Lacks Objectivity
Many "news stories" that ap
pear in the Observer contain
their writers' opinion. When ask
ed about the objectivity of these
stories, Ransom answered, "We
deny the possibility of objec
tivity." He added. "Objectivity is
false. We're trying to get the
facts and analyze them."
Explaining this further, Ran
som said that the Observer's
analysis are as biasted as any
ones, the AP, Palo Alto Times,
etc.
The Peninsula 01»server is the
local spokesman for the Move
ment, a loose coalition of the
Free University, Palo Alto Re
sistance, Students for a Demo

cratic Society (SDS), Peace and
Freedom Party and others.
Ransom feels that the paper
has helped the organizing proc
ess of the Movement in the area.
Members of these organizations
come in and write for the Ob
server because they feel that the
Movement has to have a voice.
Solicits News
To get the rest of the news,
the Observer solicits stories and
letters from anyone who will
bring or send them in. The edit
ors hold weekly meetings to de
cide which stories to use and
discuss what should be covered
in the future.
The Observer is currently los
ing $100-$2OO monthly, but Ran
som said, "is putting out a bet
ter, bigger paper than previous
ly," when they were losing $700
a month.
Ransom feels that their finan
cial position is good and getting
better. He cited increasing adver
tising revenue, more subscribers
and underwriting by patrons as
reasons for his optimism.
The Observer is currently do
ing features on the Palo Alto
"power structure" and how it
relates to the current low-in
come housing shortage and the
lack of a community center for
the Free University.
In the past, the Observer com
piled data about the Stanford
Research Institute (SRI) which
it published to make the public
aware of its function and power.
National Coverage
In addition to local coverage,
the Observer subscribes to the
Liberation News Service (LNS)
which supplies news of the
Movement nationwide. The paper
also contains special features
such as James O'Connor's ar
ticle, "What is to be done" as
well as in depth coverage of the
Black Panthers.
The Observer strives to be con
temporary and relevant, stated
Miss Charyn. The name of the

entertainment section was
changed from Entertainment to
Arts and finally to Cultural Rev
olution.
Drugs, be-ins, happenings, etc.,
are all considered to be part of
the Cultural Revolution. "We're
vague because we don't know
yet. The purpose of the section
is to find out," explained Miss
Charyn.
Free Comics
A four-page tabloid size comic
section to be handed out free is
planned and the Observer needs
people to help put it out. The
section is to have original com
ics dealing with the Palo Alto
area and its figures.
Indirectly, the Observer is an
outgrowth of Stanford under
ground writing. In 1965, the
Stanford Graduate Coordinating
Committee (GCC) published a
newsletter as a forum for opin
ions relating to the Free Speech
Movement in Berkeley.
In 1966 and 1967, Vietnam
Newsletters and Experiment
Papers were the radical voice of
the area. As a project of Vietnam
Summer 1967, the Peninsula Ob
server was founded by Barry
Greenburg and Maureen Kul
baitis.
Ransom, editor of the Ob
server, is the candidate for Con
gress from San Mateo County
on the Peace and Freedom Party
ticket. He attended Harvard,
graduating with a B.A. in En
glish in 1962. He came to Stan
ford later that year and receiv
ed his M.A. in English in 1966.
The Observer is seriously con
sidering becoming a weekly in
the near future, as they have
more news than they can print.
Long-range plans call for the
paper to come out twice a week
in a year or two.
When asked how long they
plan to continue the paper, Miss
Charyn answered, "We will con
tinue forever." "For the dura
tion," added Ransom.

Free Comics
A four-page tabloid size comic
section to be handed out free is
planned and the Observer needs
people to help put it out. The
section is to have original com
ics dealing with the Palo Alto
area and its figures.
Indirectly, the Observer is an
outgrowth of Stanford under
ground writing. In 1965, the
Stanford Graduate Coordinating
Committee (GCC) published a
newsletter as a forum for opin
ions relating to the Free Speech
Movement in Berkeley.
In 1966 and 1967, Vietnam
Newsletters and Experiment
Papers were the radical voice of
the area. As a project of Vietnam
Summer 1967, the Peninsula Ob
server was founded by Barry
Greenburg and Maureen Kul
baitis.
Ransom, editor of the Ob
server, is the candidate for Con
gress from San Mateo County
on the Peace and Freedom Party
ticket. He attended Harvard,
graduating with a B.A. in En

ford later that year and receiv

The Observer is seriously con
sidering becoming a weekly in
the near future, as they have
more news than they can print.
Long-range plans call for the
paper to come out twice a week
in a year or two.
When asked how long they

DIFFERING OPINION — Some people accuse the "Observer" of
lack of objectivity, but editor David Ransom and Marlene Charyn,
shown here, say objectivity is impossible. |112

"We had a coup today," said
Peninsula Observer Editor David
Ransom, "the Palo Alto Times
city desk called us for the first
time for information!"
This is the gulf that separates
the independent, radical, bi
weekly Peninsula Observer from
Palo Alto's only daily newspaper,
the Times.
The Observer exists because
people opposing the "power
structures" at Stanford and in
Palo Alto feel that the Times and
its sister paper the Redwood
City Tribune constitute a monop
oly in the area and do not have
fair or balanced news coverage.
Marlene Charyn, one of the
Observer's 14 non-salaried edit
ors, observed that the paper was
serving the progressive commu
nity — "everybody" — radical,
left and liberal who feels that
part of the failure of the demo
cratic process is due to monoply
press.
She feels that the P.A. Times
has slanted stories favoring the
controlling interests of Palo
Alto, the wealthy businessmen.
"We're more honest about the
news," stated Miss Charyn.
"They're supporting the status
quo, we're attacking it."
Lacks Objectivity
Many "news stories" that ap
pear in the Observer contain
their writers' opinion. When ask
ed about the objectivity of these
stories, Ransom answered, "We
deny the possibility of objec
tivity." He added. "Objectivity is
false. We're trying to get the
facts and analyze them."
Explaining this further, Ran
som said that the Observer's
analysis are as biasted as any
ones, the AP, Palo Alto Times,
etc.
The Peninsula 01»server is the
local spokesman for the Move
ment, a loose coalition of the
Free University, Palo Alto Re
sistance, Students for a Demo

cratic Society (SDS), Peace and
Freedom Party and others.
Ransom feels that the paper
has helped the organizing proc
ess of the Movement in the area.
Members of these organizations
come in and write for the Ob
server because they feel that the
Movement has to have a voice.
Solicits News
To get the rest of the news,
the Observer solicits stories and
letters from anyone who will
bring or send them in. The edit
ors hold weekly meetings to de
cide which stories to use and
discuss what should be covered
in the future.
The Observer is currently los
ing $100-$2OO monthly, but Ran
som said, "is putting out a bet
ter, bigger paper than previous
ly," when they were losing $700
a month.
Ransom feels that their finan
cial position is good and getting
better. He cited increasing adver
tising revenue, more subscribers
and underwriting by patrons as
reasons for his optimism.
The Observer is currently do
ing features on the Palo Alto
"power structure" and how it
relates to the current low-in
come housing shortage and the
lack of a community center for
the Free University.
In the past, the Observer com
piled data about the Stanford
Research Institute (SRI) which
it published to make the public
aware of its function and power.
National Coverage
In addition to local coverage,
the Observer subscribes to the
Liberation News Service (LNS)
which supplies news of the
Movement nationwide. The paper
also contains special features
such as James O'Connor's ar
ticle, "What is to be done" as
well as in depth coverage of the
Black Panthers.
The Observer strives to be con
temporary and relevant, stated
Miss Charyn. The name of the

entertainment section was
changed from Entertainment to
Arts and finally to Cultural Rev
olution.
Drugs, be-ins, happenings, etc.,
are all considered to be part of
the Cultural Revolution. "We're

come in and write for the Ob
server because they feel that the
Movement has to have a voice.
Solicits News
To get the rest of the news,
the Observer solicits stories and
letters from anyone who will
bring or send them in. The edit
ors hold weekly meetings to de
cide which stories to use and
discuss what should be covered
in the future.
The Observer is currently los
ing $100-$2OO monthly, but Ran
som said, "is putting out a bet
ter, bigger paper than previous
ly," when they were losing $700
a month.
Ransom feels that their finan
cial position is good and getting
better. He cited increasing adver
tising revenue, more subscribers
and underwriting by patrons as
reasons for his optimism.
The Observer is currently do
ing features on the Palo Alto
"power structure" and how it
relates to the current low-in
come housing shortage and the
lack of a community center for
the Free University.
In the past, the Observer com
piled data about the Stanford
Research Institute (SRI) which
it published to make the public
aware of its function and power.
National Coverage
In addition to local coverage,
the Observer subscribes to the
Liberation News Service (LNS)
which supplies news of the
Movement nationwide. The paper
also contains special features
such as James O'Connor's ar
ticle, "What is to be done" as
well as in depth coverage of the
Black Panthers.
The Observer strives to be con
temporary and relevant, stated
Miss Charyn. The name of the

entertainment section was
changed from Entertainment to
Arts and finally to Cultural Rev

Drugs, be-ins, happenings, etc.,
are all considered to be part of
the Cultural Revolution. "We're
vague because we don't know
yet. The purpose of the section
is to find out," explained Miss
Charyn.
Free Comics
A four-page tabloid size comic
section to be handed out free is
planned and the Observer needs
people to help put it out. The
section is to have original com
ics dealing with the Palo Alto
area and its figures.
Indirectly, the Observer is an
outgrowth of Stanford under
ground writing. In 1965, the
Stanford Graduate Coordinating
Committee (GCC) published a
newsletter as a forum for opin
ions relating to the Free Speech
Movement in Berkeley.
In 1966 and 1967, Vietnam
Newsletters and Experiment
Papers were the radical voice of
the area. As a project of Vietnam
Summer 1967, the Peninsula Ob

Greenburg and Maureen Kul
baitis.
Ransom, editor of the Ob
server, is the candidate for Con
gress from San Mateo County
on the Peace and Freedom Party
ticket. He attended Harvard,
graduating with a B.A. in En
glish in 1962. He came to Stan
ford later that year and receiv
ed his M.A. in English in 1966.
The Observer is seriously con
sidering becoming a weekly in
the near future, as they have
more news than they can print.
Long-range plans call for the
paper to come out twice a week
in a year or two.
When asked how long they
plan to continue the paper, Miss
Charyn answered, "We will con
tinue forever." "For the dura

DIFFERING OPINION — Some people accuse the "Observer" of
lack of objectivity, but editor David Ransom and Marlene Charyn,
shown here, say objectivity is impossible. |112

"We had a coup today," said
Peninsula Observer Editor David
Ransom, "the Palo Alto Times
city desk called us for the first
time for information!"
This is the gulf that separates
the independent, radical, bi
weekly Peninsula Observer from
Palo Alto's only daily newspaper,
the Times.
The Observer exists because
people opposing the "power
structures" at Stanford and in
Palo Alto feel that the Times and
its sister paper the Redwood
City Tribune constitute a monop
oly in the area and do not have
fair or balanced news coverage.
Marlene Charyn, one of the
Observer's 14 non-salaried edit
ors, observed that the paper was
serving the progressive commu
nity — "everybody" — radical,
left and liberal who feels that
part of the failure of the demo
cratic process is due to monoply
press.
She feels that the P.A. Times
has slanted stories favoring the
controlling interests of Palo
Alto, the wealthy businessmen.
"We're more honest about the
news," stated Miss Charyn.
"They're supporting the status
quo, we're attacking it."
Lacks Objectivity
Many "news stories" that ap
pear in the Observer contain
their writers' opinion. When ask
ed about the objectivity of these
stories, Ransom answered, "We
deny the possibility of objec
tivity." He added. "Objectivity is
false. We're trying to get the
facts and analyze them."
Explaining this further, Ran
som said that the Observer's
analysis are as biasted as any
ones, the AP, Palo Alto Times,
etc.
The Peninsula 01»server is the
local spokesman for the Move
ment, a loose coalition of the
Free University, Palo Alto Re
sistance, Students for a Demo

cratic Society (SDS), Peace and
Freedom Party and others.

has helped the organizing proc
ess of the Movement in the area.
