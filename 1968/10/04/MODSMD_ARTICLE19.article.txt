Starting salaries of Business
School graduates (MBA's) rose
to a new high again this year,
but the percentage increase was
the lowest in several years.
William Lowe, director ol
placement at the Graduate
School of Business, said average
starting salaries of the MBA
class which graduated this June
rose to an all-time high of $12,-
156.
But this increase of 6.6 per
cent over last year's $11,500 was
significantly lower than previous
years which showed increases
of 10.1 per cent in 1967 and 8.8
per cent in 1966.
The survey also revealed that
MBA's having non - technical
backgrounds made greater sal
ary increases than those having
technical backgrounds. Techni
cally oriented students found
only a 6.6 per cent increase com
pared to a 9.4 per cent increase
for non-technical students. If
this trend continues, it may soon

close the gap of approximately
$750 per year salary differential
between the two types of stu
dents.
"The reason for these increas
es was the continual demand for
MBA talent. And although one
day the demand will fall off, I
can't see that happening very
soon," Lowe explained.
"Very simply, the MBA has
taken the place of the electrical
engineer as being the most
sought after, but also most awe
some to recruiters. The MBA is
in such demand that he is in a
real position to bargain for his
talent.
"But we shouldn't ta-e this
salary thing all out of propor
tion. Salary is probably only the
icing on the cake. Oh, it's import
ant, especially if a student has
taken out a loan or the lilre to
finance his education — th n $50
a month can mean something,
but most MBA's are looking at
the opportunities the job offers.
