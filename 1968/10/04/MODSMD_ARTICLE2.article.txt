# Med School To Consider BSU Admissions Plan
## 
### PETER DOLINGER 
A special meeting of the Medi
cal School Faculty Senate has
been called for tomorrow at 8:30
a.m. to discuss a plan for in
creasing black admissions form
ulated by the Black Student Un
ion (BSU) in consultation with
the Medical School's Committee
on Minority Affairs.
The Minority Affairs Commit
tee had proposed a minority ad
missions plan this summer, but
the committee had been sent
back to make the proposal more
specific.
The Black Student Union pre
sented its proposal in the form
of a series of demands, accord
ing to the prologue to the de
mands, "because of the inability
of the administration and facul
ty of the Stanford University
Medical School to formulate a
workable program for increas
ing minority group enrollment,
if
As one BSU member said, the
issue at question is when mi
nority admissions will be
stepped up. As the prologue
said, "in spite of (the faculty
and administration's) sincerity
and expressions of good faith on
one hand, their efforts lack a
sense of urgency."
Recruiting Since 1964
There are at present three
minority students in the Medi
cal School though the school has
had a policy of trying to recruit
minority students since 1964.
The BSU presented their de
mands Oct. 1 to the Trustees,
Dean of the Medical School and
Acting President Robert Glaser,
and Dr. Bernard Nelson, chair
man of the Medical School Com
mittee on Minority Students Ad
missions. The BSU stipulated
Oct. 8, 1968, as the date for re
ply by the Medical School ad
ministration.
The demands were made pub
lic last Thursday evening at a
meeting of a new course in the
Medical School, "Issues in Com
munity Health," a credit course
run entirely by students.
Besides the courses' regular

members, the Medical School
Committee on Minority Affairs
and Executive Committee were
invited to participate in a dis
cussion of "Medical Education
of Blacks and Browns at Stan
ford."
Issue Presented
About an hour after the dis
cussion began Bob Ilia, a third
year medical student and mem
ber of the BSU, who was moder
ating the discussion, presented
the demands to Dr. Bernard
Nelson, who was representing
the Dean's Office at the meet
ing. It was not immediately
clear whether the demands had
been presented to Dean Glaser
and the trustees by that time.
Besides the demand that ten
minority students be accepted to
the Medical Schol next fall, the
BSU has also demanded that to
tal financial assistance for these
students be provided. In suc
ceeding classes, the BSU wants
minorities to comprise 20 per
cent of the students.
The demands also specify a
committee for selecting minori
ty students which would work
independently of the regular
Medical School Admissions Com
mittee. The power in the pro
posed Minority Students Admis
sions Committee would rest out
side Medical School faculty or
administration, with member
ship consisting of two minority
professional people chosen by
the BSU from the community,
two black medical students, and
two Medical School administra
tors or faculty.
No demand was made for spe
cial treatment of the minority
students after they are admitted.
A BSU member who did not
wish to be identified as a spokes
man said that the proposed Mi
nority Students Admissions
Committee would not seek out
students who were not likely to
meet Medical School standards
and have to drop out.
Dr. Eric Shooter, chairman of
the Medical School Faculty Sen
ate, announced the special meet
ing yesterday. The agenda con

sists of an item: "Implementa
tion of a program for increased
admission of minority students
to the Medical School."
The Medical School Executive
Committee, which is composed
of the 16 chairmen of the Medi
cal School Departments, has
been considering proposals by
faculty committees on ways to
improve the Medical School's
lack of minority students. While
the Executive Committee is con
sidered to be in favor of some
system of admitting more mi
nority students by next year,
they have been unable to reach
any specific plan of action.

Issue Presented
About an hour after the dis
cussion began Bob Ilia, a third
year medical student and mem
ber of the BSU, who was moder
ating the discussion, presented
the demands to Dr. Bernard
Nelson, who was representing
the Dean's Office at the meet
ing. It was not immediately
clear whether the demands had
been presented to Dean Glaser
and the trustees by that time.
Besides the demand that ten
minority students be accepted to
the Medical Schol next fall, the
BSU has also demanded that to
tal financial assistance for these
students be provided. In suc
ceeding classes, the BSU wants
minorities to comprise 20 per
cent of the students.
The demands also specify a
committee for selecting minori
ty students which would work
independently of the regular
Medical School Admissions Com
mittee. The power in the pro
posed Minority Students Admis
sions Committee would rest out
side Medical School faculty or
administration, with member
ship consisting of two minority
professional people chosen by
the BSU from the community,
two black medical students, and
two Medical School administra
tors or faculty.
No demand was made for spe
cial treatment of the minority
students after they are admitted.
A BSU member who did not
wish to be identified as a spokes
man said that the proposed Mi
nority Students Admissions
Committee would not seek out
students who were not likely to
meet Medical School standards
and have to drop out.

the Medical School Faculty Sen

been considering proposals by
faculty committees on ways to
improve the Medical School's
lack of minority students. While
the Executive Committee is con
sidered to be in favor of some
system of admitting more mi
nority students by next year,
they have been unable to reach
any specific plan of action.
Tomorrow's meeting is closed
to non-Medical School faculty.
