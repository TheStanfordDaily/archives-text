# 'Mayan Culture’ At Art Gallery
## 
### 
The Mayan culture, with its
"amazing understanding of the
human figure and high artistry,"
speaks from its ancient past in
an exhibition of monument rub
bings being shown at Stanford
Art Gallery until Oct. 27.
The works acknowledging
Mayan art are by Merle Greene,
archaeological illustrator, who
did the 50 rubbings to be shown
on site in Mexico, Honduras, and
Guatemala during the past six
years.
Most represent a dynasty of
ruler-priests. Mrs. Greene thinks

the Mayan monuments were
erected "at first about every 20
years, then every 10 or five, as
a way of recording time ... a
way to give the flavor of the
period."
The rubbings, dating from 300
to 900 A.D., illustrate the Mayan
culture's classic period. Mrs.
Greene developed the rubbing
technique she uses and considers
it "better than drawings or
photographs for bringing out all
the details."
Using a special, tough rice
paper she places it on the monu
ment and moistens the paper
with a shoft brush. She then
pounds it into the bas-relief with
a soft, wet cloth. After it is dry,
she covers her thumb with China
silk and applies the coloring —
an oil pigment or sumi.
Mrs. Greene, in private life
Mrs. Lawrence W. Robertson,
currently teaches anthropology
at the Robert Louis Stevenson
School in Pebble Beach.
She has done archaeological
illustration, as a member of field
teams, for the University of Pen
nsylvania, and Southern Illinois
University.
