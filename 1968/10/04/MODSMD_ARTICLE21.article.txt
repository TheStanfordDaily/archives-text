## 'Cabaret' In S.F. 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
"Cabaret," the hit of last
year's Broadway season, is cur
rently playing at the Curran
Theater in San Francisco. While
this musical strikes a disconcert
ing balance between flaws and
virtues, it is still very much
worth seeing.
"Cabaret" is alleged to be a
musical with a message, but I
suspect the message's sugar
coating is the actual source of
"Cabaret's" success. The action
(based on some stories by Chris
topher Lsherwood) is set against
the sleazy backdrop of Berlin
during the late Twenties, spe
cifically, at the Kit Kat Club
(where telephones connect the
tables). The onerous burden of
the plot is to portray the sullen,
intrepid rise of the Third Reich,
as well as the rise and fall of
an affair between an English
torch-singer and an erstwhile
American writer.
The advances of Nazism are
managed with brusque economy,
but the romance is swamped
with cliches and banal gew-gaw
ing. Aside from the nervous en
ergy and sheer kinkiness Lelissa
Hart puts into her role as Sally
Bowles, this love-affair is facile
and unengaging. Gene Rupert
plays the part of the writer with
carefully concealed skill.
I assume the message of
"Cabaret" is that one must live
through decadent times with

slanty-eycd skepticism, but this
production practically eclipses
the message by making deca
dence so thoroughly delightful.
The debauchery and crassness of
the era are superbly and enthu
siastically evoked. Tho Kit Kat
Klub is where the action is; and
interestingly, the oily, bisexual
Master of Ceremonies (ingeni
ously played by Robert Salvio)
is the real hero of "Cabaret."
While "Cabaret" touches only
fleetingly upon the gritty moral
issues which the plot raises, it
does capture marvelously the
bawdy euphoria of German
nightlife of the Twenties. The
Kit Kat Klub scenes are stun
ningly effective—the result of
clever stage direction and styl
ized, insinuating choreography.
The production numbers are cal
culated crowd-pleasers — and
this they do. The humor of both
book and music is delectable.
"Cabaret's" score is perhaps the
best to appear in the last three
years.
As social criticism, "Cabaret"
does not compare with its ob
vious sources of inspiration,
namely, the collaborations of
Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht.
Those keen Brechtian incisors
are extracted and replaced in
"Cabaret" with shiny, even den
tures. As entertainment how
ever, "Cabaret's" lively theatri
cality insures its success. The
sugar coating is the best part!
