# Unbeaten Indians Eye High-Flying Falcons
## 
### GARY CAVALLI 
Having twice tomahawked op
ponents with a deadly passing
game, Stanford's Indians will
try to bring down the high-fly
ing Air Force Falcons tomorrow
afternoon at 1:30 in Stanford
Stadium.
Tomorrow's game provides
Coach Ralston's men with a
chance to become the first Stan
ford football team in 12 years
to win three straight games in
one season. Back in 1956, John
Brodie directed the Tribe to
three consecutive mid-season
victories.
The '68 edition of the Indian
grid machine, with sophomore
Jim Plunkett at the controls, has
steamrolled to two impressive
triumphs, a 68-20 spanking of
San Jose State and a hard
fought 28-12 verdict over Ore
gon.
The Indians have been in
stalled as eight-point favorites
in tomorrow's contest, but these
odds may be deceiving.
The cadets, currently 1-1 on
the year, have looked very
strong in their first two outings.
They dropped a 23-20 heart
breaker to Florida, sixth ranked
team in the nation, in the sea
son opener, then upset 20th
ranked Wyoming 10-3 last Sat
urday.
Defense Claws Cowboys
Falcon coach Ben Martin has
a young, talented team which
showed exceptional defensive
strength in holding Wyoming
without a touchdown for the
first time in 27 games. Defen
sive backs Rudy Hallenbeck and
A 1 Wurglitz, along with end
Harold Whaley, were the big
factors in shutting off the Cow
boys.
Offensively the Falcons have
been inconsistent, but they have
plenty of speed.
In quarterback Gary Baxter
the cadets have a poised and
polished performer. Baxter spe
cializes in the roll-out option,
which Alan Pitcaithley used ef
fectively against Stanford last
week in Oregon.
Tailbacks Curtis Martin and
Ernest Jennings, both sopho
mores who run the century in
9.6, give the Falcons plenty of
breakaway speed. Martin
stunned Florida on the opening
kickoff two weeks ago with a
98-yard kickoff return.
Prestigious Boot
Junior Dennis Leuthauser
Kives the Air Force one of the

top place-kickers in the country,
as evidenced by his 57-yard field
goal last Saturday against Wyo
ming. Leuthauser's boot, a mod
ern collegiate record, was the
longest field goal since 1898,
when James Haxall hit one from
65 yards out for Princeton.
Stanford coach Ralston ex
pects some surprises from the
Falcon offense tomorrow.
"We can't key on any one
thing," Ralston commented.
"Their coach is offensive minded
and tries to come up with some
thing different for each oppo
nent. I'm sure we'll see some
thing new."
Ralston feels the game will
hinge on Stanford's performance
in two areas.
Defense Pivotal
"We'll have to improve our
overall defense and our running
game to win Saturday," Ralston
claimed. "We need more con
sistent play than we've been
getting."
The Indian running game may
be boosted by the return of
speedster Bubba Brown, who
was held out of the Oregon
game because of a sprained an
kle. Ralston indicated that
Brown, who gained 61 yards
against San Jose in the opener,
will be ready to go tomorrow.
Senior guards Don Hefferman

and Mike Willard will also bo
mming off the injured list for
Stanford Saturday. Junior Phil
Reinhard, who has boon alterna
ting with Phil Messer at right
guard, injured his knee in prac
tice Monday and was feared lost
for tomorrow's game. Put Rein
hard was running well yester
day and may be ready to go by
gametime.
Tribe Gains Confidence
The Indians have been gaining
confidence in themselves with
each game, due mainly to some
come-through performances by
sophomore starters. Center John
Sande and linebacker Dennis
Moore, both of whom took over
for injured senior veterans, have
progressed very rapidly. Ralston
indicated that Moore and Sande
played a key role in Stanford'"?
victory at Oregon.
This confidence is best ex
pressed by quarterback Plunk
ett, who is optimistic about the
Tribe's chances tomorrow.
"I feel we can score on any
team," Plunkett says, giving
much of the credit to Stanford's
fine offensive line. "Our defense
is pretty tough, and the Air
Force hasn't shown that much
offensively," he continues. "We
should be able to beat them
fairly well."

Reinhard, who has boon alterna
ting with Phil Messer at right
guard, injured his knee in prac
tice Monday and was feared lost
for tomorrow's game. Put Rein
hard was running well yester
day and may be ready to go by
gametime.
Tribe Gains Confidence
The Indians have been gaining
confidence in themselves with
each game, due mainly to some
come-through performances by
sophomore starters. Center John
Sande and linebacker Dennis
Moore, both of whom took over
for injured senior veterans, have
progressed very rapidly. Ralston
indicated that Moore and Sande
played a key role in Stanford'"?
victory at Oregon.
This confidence is best ex
pressed by quarterback Plunk
ett, who is optimistic about the
Tribe's chances tomorrow.
"I feel we can score on any
team," Plunkett says, giving
much of the credit to Stanford's
fine offensive line. "Our defense
is pretty tough, and the Air
Force hasn't shown that much
offensively," he continues. "We
should be able to beat them
fairly well."
Having twice tomahawked op
ponents with a deadly passing
game, Stanford's Indians will
try to bring down the high-fly
ing Air Force Falcons tomorrow
afternoon at 1:30 in Stanford
Stadium.
Tomorrow's game provides
Coach Ralston's men with a
chance to become the first Stan
ford football team in 12 years
to win three straight games in
one season. Back in 1956, John
Brodie directed the Tribe to
three consecutive mid-season
victories.
The '68 edition of the Indian
grid machine, with sophomore
Jim Plunkett at the controls, has
steamrolled to two impressive
triumphs, a 68-20 spanking of
San Jose State and a hard
fought 28-12 verdict over Ore
gon.
The Indians have been in
stalled as eight-point favorites
in tomorrow's contest, but these
odds may be deceiving.
The cadets, currently 1-1 on
the year, have looked very
strong in their first two outings.
They dropped a 23-20 heart
breaker to Florida, sixth ranked
team in the nation, in the sea
son opener, then upset 20th
ranked Wyoming 10-3 last Sat
urday.
Defense Claws Cowboys
Falcon coach Ben Martin has
a young, talented team which
showed exceptional defensive
strength in holding Wyoming
without a touchdown for the
first time in 27 games. Defen
sive backs Rudy Hallenbeck and
A 1 Wurglitz, along with end
Harold Whaley, were the big
factors in shutting off the Cow
boys.
Offensively the Falcons have
been inconsistent, but they have
plenty of speed.
In quarterback Gary Baxter
the cadets have a poised and
polished performer. Baxter spe
cializes in the roll-out option,
which Alan Pitcaithley used ef
fectively against Stanford last
week in Oregon.
Tailbacks Curtis Martin and
Ernest Jennings, both sopho
mores who run the century in
9.6, give the Falcons plenty of
breakaway speed. Martin
stunned Florida on the opening
kickoff two weeks ago with a
98-yard kickoff return.
Prestigious Boot
Junior Dennis Leuthauser
Kives the Air Force one of the

top place-kickers in the country,
as evidenced by his 57-yard field
goal last Saturday against Wyo
ming. Leuthauser's boot, a mod
ern collegiate record, was the
longest field goal since 1898,
when James Haxall hit one from
65 yards out for Princeton.
Stanford coach Ralston ex
pects some surprises from the
Falcon offense tomorrow.
"We can't key on any one
thing," Ralston commented.
"Their coach is offensive minded
and tries to come up with some
thing different for each oppo
nent. I'm sure we'll see some
thing new."
Ralston feels the game will
hinge on Stanford's performance
in two areas.
Defense Pivotal
"We'll have to improve our
overall defense and our running
game to win Saturday," Ralston
claimed. "We need more con
sistent play than we've been
getting."
The Indian running game may
be boosted by the return of
speedster Bubba Brown, who
was held out of the Oregon
game because of a sprained an
kle. Ralston indicated that
Brown, who gained 61 yards
against San Jose in the opener,
will be ready to go tomorrow.
Senior guards Don Hefferman

Stanford coach Ralston ex
pects some surprises from the
Falcon offense tomorrow.
"We can't key on any one
thing," Ralston commented.
"Their coach is offensive minded
and tries to come up with some
thing different for each oppo
nent. I'm sure we'll see some
thing new."
Ralston feels the game will
hinge on Stanford's performance
in two areas.
Defense Pivotal
"We'll have to improve our
overall defense and our running
game to win Saturday," Ralston
claimed. "We need more con
sistent play than we've been
getting."
The Indian running game may
be boosted by the return of
speedster Bubba Brown, who
was held out of the Oregon
game because of a sprained an
kle. Ralston indicated that
Brown, who gained 61 yards
against San Jose in the opener,
will be ready to go tomorrow.
Senior guards Don Hefferman

and Mike Willard will also bo
mming off the injured list for
Stanford Saturday. Junior Phil
Reinhard, who has boon alterna
ting with Phil Messer at right
guard, injured his knee in prac
tice Monday and was feared lost
for tomorrow's game. Put Rein
hard was running well yester
day and may be ready to go by
gametime.
Tribe Gains Confidence
The Indians have been gaining
confidence in themselves with
each game, due mainly to some
come-through performances by
sophomore starters. Center John
Sande and linebacker Dennis
Moore, both of whom took over
for injured senior veterans, have
progressed very rapidly. Ralston
indicated that Moore and Sande
played a key role in Stanford'"?
victory at Oregon.
This confidence is best ex
pressed by quarterback Plunk
ett, who is optimistic about the
Tribe's chances tomorrow.
"I feel we can score on any
team," Plunkett says, giving
much of the credit to Stanford's
fine offensive line. "Our defense
is pretty tough, and the Air
Force hasn't shown that much
offensively," he continues. "We
should be able to beat them
fairly well."
Having twice tomahawked op
ponents with a deadly passing
game, Stanford's Indians will
try to bring down the high-fly
ing Air Force Falcons tomorrow
afternoon at 1:30 in Stanford
Stadium.
Tomorrow's game provides
Coach Ralston's men with a
chance to become the first Stan
ford football team in 12 years
to win three straight games in
one season. Back in 1956, John
Brodie directed the Tribe to
three consecutive mid-season
victories.
The '68 edition of the Indian
grid machine, with sophomore
Jim Plunkett at the controls, has
steamrolled to two impressive
triumphs, a 68-20 spanking of
San Jose State and a hard
fought 28-12 verdict over Ore
gon.
The Indians have been in
stalled as eight-point favorites
in tomorrow's contest, but these
odds may be deceiving.
The cadets, currently 1-1 on
the year, have looked very
strong in their first two outings.
They dropped a 23-20 heart
breaker to Florida, sixth ranked
team in the nation, in the sea
son opener, then upset 20th
ranked Wyoming 10-3 last Sat
urday.
Defense Claws Cowboys
Falcon coach Ben Martin has
a young, talented team which
showed exceptional defensive
strength in holding Wyoming
without a touchdown for the
first time in 27 games. Defen
sive backs Rudy Hallenbeck and
A 1 Wurglitz, along with end
Harold Whaley, were the big
factors in shutting off the Cow
boys.
Offensively the Falcons have
been inconsistent, but they have
plenty of speed.
In quarterback Gary Baxter
the cadets have a poised and
polished performer. Baxter spe
cializes in the roll-out option,
which Alan Pitcaithley used ef
fectively against Stanford last
week in Oregon.
Tailbacks Curtis Martin and
Ernest Jennings, both sopho
mores who run the century in
9.6, give the Falcons plenty of
breakaway speed. Martin
stunned Florida on the opening
kickoff two weeks ago with a
98-yard kickoff return.
Prestigious Boot
Junior Dennis Leuthauser
Kives the Air Force one of the

top place-kickers in the country,
as evidenced by his 57-yard field
goal last Saturday against Wyo
ming. Leuthauser's boot, a mod
ern collegiate record, was the
longest field goal since 1898,
when James Haxall hit one from
65 yards out for Princeton.
