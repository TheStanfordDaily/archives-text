# Intrasquad Meet Tomorrow
## Veterans Boost Cross-Country 
### ALLEN MEREDITH 
With five veteran trotters re
turning from the 1967 season
and a youthful coach taking
over the reigns, the Stanford
varsity cross-country team looks
to be one of the most talented
in school history.
The first year coach, Marshall
Clark, a graduate of USC in
1957, feels his team's condition
ing is ahead of last year's pace,
but he expects other teams to
have improved, also. Last sea
son's team won three of five
dual meets and placed second in
both the Sacramento State and
the South Tahoe Invitationals.
The five returning letterman
are Bob Anchando, Greg Brock,
Chuck Menz, Allen Sanford, and
captain Brook Thomas. Junior
Brock, school record holder in
both the two-mile and the three
mile, is one of the country's

finest young distance runners.
Brock is currently posted num
ber one, but he will face the de
termined challenge of seniors
Allen Sanford and Brook Thom
as.
Brock has the best time of
any varsity runner coming back
from the 1967 team. He covered
the Stanford course in 20:31.0
for Bth place on the "All-Time
Best" list by an Indian runner.
Allen Sanford ran 20:40.0 last
year to move into the top 10
with 10th place on the all-time
list, missing 9th place by only
fractions of a second.
The team will also be without
the services of letter winner
Dave Redwine, who is unable to
compete because he is attending
one of the European campuses
for the year.
There will also be help from
the frosh team who were unde

feated last year in three meets.
The best of the sophomores are
Don Kardong and Duncan Mac-
Donald with sub 21:00 minute
clockings on the 4.2 mile Stan
ford course.
Should anyone falter in the
top seven, there are a number
of capable runners that could
move up the ladder. Included
are Brian Cox, Pete Fairchild,
Mark Jones, Steve Jones, Steve
Karpinos, Jay Rice, and JC
transfer Kermit Sweetwyne.
This year's frosh team has
equally impressive credentials
for the season. Presently there
are fifteen candidates scheduled
to run in the October 5 intra
squad meet.
The top freshman distance
men, based on their times In the
2 miles are Arvid Kretz, Ber
nard Lahde, Jack Lawson,

George Watson, Tim Peterson,
Bruce McCormach, and Mike
Pinkerton. The top seven will
be challenged by a strong group
of 880-mile men that could once
again produce an undefeated
freshman team.

in school history.
The first year coach, Marshall
Clark, a graduate of USC in
1957, feels his team's condition
ing is ahead of last year's pace,
but he expects other teams to
have improved, also. Last sea
son's team won three of five
dual meets and placed second in
both the Sacramento State and
the South Tahoe Invitationals.
The five returning letterman
are Bob Anchando, Greg Brock,
Chuck Menz, Allen Sanford, and
captain Brook Thomas. Junior
Brock, school record holder in
both the two-mile and the three
mile, is one of the country's

finest young distance runners.
Brock is currently posted num
ber one, but he will face the de
termined challenge of seniors
Allen Sanford and Brook Thom
as.
Brock has the best time of
any varsity runner coming back
from the 1967 team. He covered
the Stanford course in 20:31.0
for Bth place on the "All-Time
Best" list by an Indian runner.
Allen Sanford ran 20:40.0 last
year to move into the top 10
with 10th place on the all-time
list, missing 9th place by only
fractions of a second.
The team will also be without
the services of letter winner
Dave Redwine, who is unable to
compete because he is attending
one of the European campuses
for the year.
There will also be help from
the frosh team who were unde

feated last year in three meets.
The best of the sophomores are
Don Kardong and Duncan Mac-
Donald with sub 21:00 minute
clockings on the 4.2 mile Stan
ford course.
Should anyone falter in the
top seven, there are a number
of capable runners that could
move up the ladder. Included
are Brian Cox, Pete Fairchild,
Mark Jones, Steve Jones, Steve
Karpinos, Jay Rice, and JC
transfer Kermit Sweetwyne.
This year's frosh team has
equally impressive credentials
for the season. Presently there
are fifteen candidates scheduled
to run in the October 5 intra
squad meet.
The top freshman distance
men, based on their times In the
2 miles are Arvid Kretz, Ber
nard Lahde, Jack Lawson,

George Watson, Tim Peterson,
Bruce McCormach, and Mike
Pinkerton. The top seven will
be challenged by a strong group
of 880-mile men that could once
again produce an undefeated
freshman team.
