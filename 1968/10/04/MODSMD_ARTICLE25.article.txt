# Bengals Bounce Back, 8-1

ST. LOUIS (AP) â€” Mickey
Lolich almost missed his World
Series starting chance due to a
groin infection Thursday, but he
came through with a six-hitter
and smashed his first pro home
run in Detroit's 8-1 victory over
St. Louis that squared the Series
after two games.
"I was a little groggy and was
afraid I would lose energy late
in the game," said Lolich, who
feared Manager Mayo Smith
would sub another starter.
"The doctor told me he was
all right," said Smith, "so I de
cided to go with him."
Lolich was so stunned to hit
his first homer after six years
in the majors that he forgot to
touch first base and had to go
back to tag it after he hit the
ball in the third inning.
The brash lefty, who rides a
motor bike to the park from his
suburban home in Detroit, was
asked to cpmpare the homer
with the thrill of riding 135
miles an hour.
"They're both exciting in
their own way," he said.
The Cards, stunned by the Ti
gers' 13-hit attack that included
homers by Willie Horton, Norm
Cash and Lolich, stuck with
plans to pitch Ray Washburn in
Saturday's third game at De
troit. His opponent will be an
other right-hander, 33-year-old
Earl Wilson.

Lolich lost his chance for a
shutout in the sixth when the
Cards scored on a walk to Lou
Brock, who stole second, a
scratch single by Curt lFood
and a bloop single to short left
center by Orlando Cepeda.
With men on first and third
and only one out, Lolich was
bailed out of his only deep hole
of the cool, sunny afternoon by

Mickey Stanley. Stanley, an out
fielder playing shortstop, took
Mike Shannon's hard grounder
and turned it into an inning-end
ing double play, to the dismay
of the crowd of 54,692 at Busch
Stadium.
Until JuHan Javier singled in
the eighth, the only real clean
hit off Lolich was a first-inning
single by Javier.
