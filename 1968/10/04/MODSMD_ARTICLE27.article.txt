# Jim Plunkett Era Unfolds
## The
						Making Of A Quarterback 
### GARY CAVALLI 
The name is Jim Plunkett.
Before the current collegiate
football season began, it wasn't
exactly a household word. But
after two sensational efforts re
sulting in Stanford victories, Jim
Plunkett is beginning to look like
the best quarterback on the West
Coast.
Plunkett's rapid development
into a top-flight quarterback is
no overnight thing. He's been
working on it since his early
childhood.
"I've been throwing the ball as
long as I can remember," the
San Jose native recalls. "I've ad
ways wanted to be a quarter
back."
Plunkett played his high
school football at Overfelt for
two years and then transferred
to nearby James Lick. Tnere he
etched his name into the school
record book in nearly every of
fensive category, despite playing
only two seasons.
After weighing offers from
numerous other big - name
schools, Jim decided to attend
Stanford. The tall, raw-boned
Plunkett confesses that "prox
imity" was a big factor in his
decision. Part of a very closely
knit family, Jim wanted to re
main near his parents. Today
Jim's folks "try to keep up with
the games," despite the fact that
his mother is blind and his fath
er nearly so.
The 6-3, 205 pounder had a fine
freshman season in 1966 and
looked forward to playing on the
Stanford varsity, but in the fall
of his sophomore year was in
formed he was to be red-shirted.
"I wasn't too pleased at first,"
Plunkett says of the coaching
staff's decision to hold him out
of action for a year. "Naturally
T wanted to play."
Spring Sensation
Last April Jim reported to
spring drills, confident that he
had a good chance for the first
string quarterbaeking job. As
the drills progressed, it became
apparent that Plunkett would be
Ralston's first - string signal
caller.
"Plunkett is the best passer
we've had since I've been here,"
Ralston commented at the con
clusion of spring practice. "We
feel he's a guy we can build on."
Plunkett was Jn the spotlight
when the Indians, a. sidered
dark-horse contenders for the
Pac-8 crown, began working out
in preparation for their first

game with San Jose State.
The pressure was tremendous.
While it was obvious Plunkett
possessed a fine throwing arm,
he was completely untested in
game situations.
Opening Game Jitters
Jim confesses to having a case
of butterflies before the San Jose
game.
"I had my doubts," he remem
bers. "I wanted to do well at the
start, especially with all the pub
licity we were getting. Before
the game I was very nervous,
but once the game started I felt
pretty composed."
If the rookie signal-caller felt
the pressure, he never showed
any signs of it out on the field.
In the little more than half the
game he played, Plunkett com
pleted 10 of 13 passes for 277
yards and four touchdowns, as
the Indians waltzed to a 68-20
win. A week later In Oregon he
tossed three more TD aerials and
ran for another, as Stanford pre
vailed 28-12.
NCAA statistics released Tues
day showed Plunkett seventh in
the country in total offense with
519 yards, and fifth among the

nation's quarterbacks with 504
yards gained passing.
Credits Team Effort
Plunkett modestly attributes
his phenomenal success to a
strong offensive line and a bril
liant group of receivers.
"The line sure makes it easy
for me," Jim asserts, "and we
have some fine receivers. Even
our reserve ends are all excellent
receivers. We have a hell of a
team effort here at Stanford."
"Gene (Washington) Is the
best receiver in the conference,"
Jim continues. "He's improved
tremendously since the begin
ning of last season. Bob Moore
is an excellent tight end. The
one-handed catch he made in
Oregon is the type of thing that
makes a passer look good. Jack
Lasater is nearly as fast as
Gene. Before the end of the sea
son you'll be hearing a lot about
him."
Listening to Plunkett, you'd
get the idea that any moron
could throw a complete pass to
such a great crew of receivers.
But it is Plunkett who makes
the Indian offense a potent one.

He is the typo of quarterback
that pro scouts dream obout.
Pro Prospect?
Most college quarterbacks
with Plunkett's size and throw
ing ability (those that have his
size and ability) have profes
sional aspirations. Jim is no ex
ception. He has already demon
strated several of the qualities
needed by a pro quarterback —
a very strong arm (he modestly
admits he can throw the ball
"further than 70 yards"), polish
ed ballhandling, poise under
pressure, and the ability to find
a secondary receiver when the
primary receiver is covered.
"I guess I've always wanted
to be a pro quarterback some
day," Jim says with the trace of
a smile. "After all, I am a big
fellow."
Right now, Plunkett is the "big
fellow" on the Tribe football
team. He has guided the Indians
to two successive victories. And
with two more years of eligi
bility remaining, he could make
the "Jim Plunkett era" one of
the most successful in Stanford
football history.
