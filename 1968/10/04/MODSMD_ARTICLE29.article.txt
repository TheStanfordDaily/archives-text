## Country Music Lives 
### PETER THOMPSON 
"Well, when Earl wrote this,
we thought 'twas kinda silly and
didn't know if we'd bother to
record it. But we did, and ya
know, now that it's sold a few
hundred thousand copies, we've
learned to jes love it."
That was Lester Flatt, com
menting on the theme from
"Bonnie and Cylde," a strange
vehicle for getting anyone from
Nashville to a S.F. rock concert.
But Flatt and Scruggs were in
town last weekend, appearing at
the Avalon with Ramblin' Jack
Elliot, Sons of Champlin, and
Country Weather.
The latter two were local
groups, presumably included to
provide balance to the show.
Sons of Champlin is another of
those rock bands who have add
ed horns, and seem most similar
to Blood, Sweai, and Tears: both
use the additional instruments
intelligently and do many jazz
based numbers. They might have
displayed a little more taste, tim
ing but they are nevertheless
good musicians, creative writers,
and a generally first-rate band.
Country Weather is newer
and, at this point, an insult to the
audience. They were introduced
as h-e-a-v-y, which should make
one immediately skeptical. Like
other groups who term them
selves "heavy" — Iron Butterfly,

Nice, Blue Cheer — they are
merely loud. And obnoxious.
But Ramblin' Jack Elliot is
still all real. He has managed,
to use an expression of Ken
Kesey, "to transcend the bull
shit." Perhaps the most out
front, honest performer I've en
countered recently, he is also an
exceptional guitarist and inter
preter. Interpreter, because the
bulk of his material has always
come from other people's writ
ings, yet he is able to embody it
with something which is his
alone. He did everything from
"Mule Skinner Blues" to the
Stones' "Connection," including
familiar songs of Woodie Guth
rie and Merle Travis along the
way.
But he got in several of his
own things, humorous, lyrical,
or merely fun. Not changing
anything for anyone through the
years, he is doing what he loves
and seems sincerely grateful as
he tips his Stetson and says,
"Thank yee kindly," to the
crowd. Remember, gang, Dylan
was once called the poor man's
Jack Elliot.
Flatt and Scruggs were the
headliners, though, and put on
a predictable exhibition. Colum
bia Records provided the only
downer of the night, wiping out
Jerry Abrams' exceptional light
show to do a film of F & S. The

group remained looser than ever
on stage, and their music is
characterized by a tightness that
only years of togetherness can
bring. They rarely' seemed to
notice that were it not for the
success of "Bonnie and Clyde"
and rock's renewed interest in
country music, they would never
have been there.
They made few concessions
to their new-found audience,
other than doing "Foggy Moun
tain Breakdown" three times and
playing up the country bit. They
do a few new things, most suc
cessfully with Dylan tunes, but
they do them their old way.
They've made room for Earl
Scruggs' two sons to be included,
but Randy can already out-pick
his father, and their duets were
beautiful. And the good ol' good
ones — "Footprints in the
Snow," "Salty Dog," etc. — are
still the high points of their
show, incorporating back-home
sentiment with fine solos on the
steel guitar, fiddle, and banjo.
You have to forgive them for
that B & C theme because they
wrote it twenty years ago, and
no one would begrudge the
further expansion of their ap
peal. They closed the night with
a tune called "I Wonder How
the Old Folks Are;" don't worry,
Lester, they're jes fine.
