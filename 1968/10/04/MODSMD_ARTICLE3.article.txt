# Profs Recommend Numerous Changes
## 
### 
More than 50 recommenda
tions for change in university
governance have been approved
by margins of 2-to-l or more by
members of the Stanford chap
ter of American Association of
University professors (AAUP).
Developed in a summer-long
study, the proposals were voted
on individually by 207 of the
chapter's 530 members this
week.
Recommendations approved in
cluded call for:
• "Direct, formal mecha
nisms" for students, faculty,
and staff to communicate with
the Board of Trustees;
• Student, faculty, and alumni
representation on advisory com
mittees for the selection of fu

ture university presidents;
• Formal student and faculty
representation in the selection
and reappointment of major ad
ministrative officers; and
• Regularized means for so
liciting student opinion, without
vote, on teaching when decisions
on faculty promotions, reap
pointments, and tenure are
made.
Copies of the recommenda
tions will be sent to the trustees,
the president, provost, Academic
Senate, and Associated Students
for their consideration.
AAUP has no formal status
within the decision making struc
ture of the University, although
its members include about half
the faculty.
AAUP Wants More Say
In the preface to their pre
liminary recommendations, now
approved by the membership,
AAUP Governance Committee
Chairman Melvin VV. Reder and
his colleagues said:
"We are dissatisfied with the
style or manner of administra
tion at Stanford. . . . Our goal is
for greater participation in set
ting university policy and not
just ratifying it. . . . "
Specific recommendations en
dorsed by the members also in
clude the suggestion that "mem
bership of the Board of Trustees
should be more representative
— professionally, politically, geo
graphically, and in age distri
bution — of the composition of
contemporary American society.
The chapter also suggested ap-
ointment of a committee of
-ustees, administrators, faculty,
nd students "to study the prob
•m of delegation of power by
le Board of Trustees and to
ake recommendations of speci
: areas in which delegation is
;sirable."
The members also approved a
recommendation for "much in
creased faculty participation in
the resource allocation (budget
ing) process."
Expansion of Academic Council
By a margin of less than 2-
to-1, the members recommended
expansion of the Academic Coun
cil, "to include other full-time
teachers, who hold instructor,
lecturer or acting professorial
ranks." At present, the Council
is limited to assistant, associate,
and full professors.
Voting practices within aca
demic departments should be re
viewed "to insure adequate rep
resentation of junior faculty
members," the AAUP stated
further. Some meetings of the
Academic Senate should be open
to the entire University commu
nity, but non-members should

not be given floor privileges.
In accord with the Governance
Committee recommendations the
AAUP group said "there is
need to improve student govern
ment (but) the problem of how
to achieve this must be left in
the hands of students them
selves."
The study suggested that "stu
dent appointments to university
committees should be controlled
by the Associated Students," and
recommends that this might be
achieved through a Committee
on Committees, elected by the
student body at large or by elect
ed student representatives."
Feedback Imporant
AAUP also recommends that
"departments should get regular
feed-back from undergraduates
and graduate students concern
ing curriculum and require
ments."
The members recommend that
procedures developed by the
Committee of 15 for joint stu
dent-faculty rule-making and en
forcement "be put into opera
tion immediately." (These
changes, developed last spring,
have not yet been approved by
the student legislature. They are
expected to go to a student ref
erendum this fall.)
In crisis situations, the AAUP
chapter recommended, "The
University should seek a politi
cal, not a military solution to
student protest."
