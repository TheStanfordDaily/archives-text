# Profs Recommend Numerous Changes
## 
### 
More than 50 recommenda
tions for change in university
governance have been approved
by margins of 2-to-l or more by
members of the Stanford chap
ter of American Association of
University professors (AAUP).
Developed in a summer-long
study, the proposals were voted
on individually by 207 of the
chapter's 530 members this
week.
Recommendations approved in
cluded call for:
• "Direct, formal mecha

and staff to communicate with
the Board of Trustees;
• Student, faculty, and alumni
representation on advisory com
mittees for the selection of fu

• Formal student and faculty
representation in the selection
and reappointment of major ad
ministrative officers; and
• Regularized means for so
liciting student opinion, without
vote, on teaching when decisions
on faculty promotions, reap
pointments, and tenure are
made.
Copies of the recommenda
tions will be sent to the trustees,
the president, provost, Academic
Senate, and Associated Students
for their consideration.
AAUP has no formal status
within the decision making struc
ture of the University, although
its members include about half
the faculty.

AAUP Governance Committee
Chairman Melvin VV. Reder and
his colleagues said:
"We are dissatisfied with the
style or manner of administra
tion at Stanford. . . . Our goal is
for greater participation in set

just ratifying it. . . . "
Specific recommendations en

clude the suggestion that "mem
bership of the Board of Trustees
should be more representative
— professionally, politically, geo
graphically, and in age distri

contemporary American society.
The chapter also suggested ap-
