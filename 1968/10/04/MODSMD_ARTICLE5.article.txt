# ROTC Discussion Reveals Complexity Of Credit Issue
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
The complexity surrounding
the current concern over aca
demic credit for ROTC was
brought home yesterday as four
faculty members and one admin
istrator participated in the first
ASSU Encounter.
The discussion in the large
lounge of Tresidder demon
strated that students, faculty,
and administrators are ap
proaching agreement on some
of the aspects involved. But
there will be considerably more
opinions exchanged before even
a partial resolution is reached.
Prof. Robert MacAfee Brown
cautioned the University from
dealing too hastily in resolving
the controversy. "I would hate
to see us approach a position of
what I like should stay and
what I don't like should go," he
said.
Last week's proposal before
the Academic Senate that aca
demic credit for ROTC be dis
continued next year "grew out of
the battle of Chicago . . . when
there was a great deal of ten
sion around Stanford," said
Asst. Prof. Anne Kostelanetz.
Co-Author
According to Miss Kostelanetz,
who co-authored the report
signed by ten faculty members,
the group felt that some action
needed to be taken before the
issues were taken up by stu
dents and the same sort of dis
ruptions occurred at Stanford.
Marine Col. Robert Thomas,
head of Navy ROTC, expressed
hope that some sort of agree
ment could be reached that
would be "supported wholeheart
edly by the entire University
community". The ROTC depart
ments welcome the review of
their courses by the Academic
Senate, Thomas said. But he
called on the faculty group to
issue a proposal "molded in rea
son and farsighted thought."
Credit
Asst. Prof. Barton Bernstein

expressed opposition to "ROTC
as a credit course . . . and as
an institution on a campus."
"I see no reason why I need
to acquice to instruct young
men who are being trained at
this institution to implement . . .
immoral and unwise policies,"
Bernstein said.
Vice Provost Howard Brooks
noted that his experiences sad
dling horses in ROTC before
World War II left him with a
different position towards the
program than Bernstein's two
year involvement of 15 years
ago.
His position of "retention, not
abolition" doesn't signify that
"I am in the least interested in
maintaining the status quo,"
Brooks said.
Universities, as institutions
benefiting from the fruits of the
American society, also "have an
obligation to contribute to the
benefits of this society," Brooks
noted.
Brown took exception with
this point and suggested that
the University might stress oth
er programs as well, such as the
Peace Corps.
'Pluralism'
A policy of allowing ROTC to
remain on campus comes from
belief in "pluralism of interest,"
Bernstein noted. He added that
he felt that certain "standards
of judgment" seemed to rule
against this belief.
Miss Kostelanetz concurred
with this opinion and insisted
that there afcf "standards of hu
manistic education which we as
faculty must uphold."
Referring to the report pre
sented to the Academic Senate,
Miss Kostelanetz pointed out
that there are a number of as
pects of ROTC that are "unique
and unusual."
Threaten Hank
These policies "threaten aca
demic rank," threaten the es
teem of a degree from Stanford,
and "may threaten the free in

tellectual development at Stan
ford," Kostelanetz said.
Thomas noted that his pro
pram "couldn't remain very
healthy" if academic credit was
discontinued. Enrollment in the
program might well drop if th°
environment became "more and
hostile to ROTC," he said.
The Navy ROTC department
is, over a two-year period, al
lowing students to complete pro
gram requirements in other de
partments, Thomas pointed out.
Brown questioned "the basis
of moral invulnerability from
which attacks on ROTC are
launched." He suggested that ac
ceptance of a 11-S deferment and
payment of taxes both repre
sent "individual sanctioning and
acceptance" of the current pol
icy in Vietnam.
Attacks on the academic con
tent of ROTC courses are mere
ly a "smoke screen," Brown
added.
Regular Departments
Brown did question the mode
of acceptance which allows
ROTC to remain on campus.
The University should provide
as many of these courses as
possible in regular departments,
he said.
It is also doubtful, Brown
said, whether the University
should be providing facilities to
ROTC to offer courses for cred
it.
ROTC courses are "trivial, an
ti-intellectual, wrongheaded, au
thoritarian," and worthless,"
Bernstein angrily charged in re
ferring to his own two-year
ROTC experience.
Bernstein also suggested that
ROTC professors are not "in
tellectually as free as other fac
ulty," but added that he does
not "have any evidence to sup
port" this contention.
The ASSU Encounter scries
will continue to "expose Stan
ford to given issues," ASSU Vice
President Vic Von Schlegell
said.

ASSU ENCOUNTER —Faculty and administrators rarticipated in a panel discussion of the ROTC
urogram on campus yesterday in the Tresidder large lounge, demonstrating a wide variety of opinion.
The complexity surrounding
the current concern over aca
demic credit for ROTC was
brought home yesterday as four
faculty members and one admin
istrator participated in the first
ASSU Encounter.
The discussion in the large
lounge of Tresidder demon
strated that students, faculty,
and administrators are ap
proaching agreement on some
of the aspects involved. But
there will be considerably more
opinions exchanged before even
a partial resolution is reached.
Prof. Robert MacAfee Brown
cautioned the University from
dealing too hastily in resolving
the controversy. "I would hate
to see us approach a position of
what I like should stay and
what I don't like should go," he
said.
Last week's proposal before
the Academic Senate that aca
demic credit for ROTC be dis
continued next year "grew out of
the battle of Chicago . . . when
there was a great deal of ten
sion around Stanford," said
Asst. Prof. Anne Kostelanetz.
Co-Author
According to Miss Kostelanetz,
who co-authored the report
signed by ten faculty members,
the group felt that some action
needed to be taken before the
issues were taken up by stu
dents and the same sort of dis
ruptions occurred at Stanford.
Marine Col. Robert Thomas,
head of Navy ROTC, expressed
hope that some sort of agree
ment could be reached that
would be "supported wholeheart
edly by the entire University
community". The ROTC depart
ments welcome the review of
their courses by the Academic
Senate, Thomas said. But he
called on the faculty group to
issue a proposal "molded in rea
son and farsighted thought."
Credit
Asst. Prof. Barton Bernstein

expressed opposition to "ROTC
as a credit course . . . and as
an institution on a campus."
"I see no reason why I need
to acquice to instruct young
men who are being trained at
this institution to implement . . .
immoral and unwise policies,"
Bernstein said.
Vice Provost Howard Brooks
noted that his experiences sad
dling horses in ROTC before
World War II left him with a
different position towards the
program than Bernstein's two
year involvement of 15 years
ago.
His position of "retention, not
abolition" doesn't signify that
"I am in the least interested in
maintaining the status quo,"
Brooks said.
Universities, as institutions
benefiting from the fruits of the
American society, also "have an
obligation to contribute to the
benefits of this society," Brooks
noted.
Brown took exception with
this point and suggested that
the University might stress oth
er programs as well, such as the
Peace Corps.
'Pluralism'
A policy of allowing ROTC to
remain on campus comes from
belief in "pluralism of interest,"
Bernstein noted. He added that
he felt that certain "standards
of judgment" seemed to rule
against this belief.
Miss Kostelanetz concurred
with this opinion and insisted
that there afcf "standards of hu
manistic education which we as
faculty must uphold."
Referring to the report pre
sented to the Academic Senate,
Miss Kostelanetz pointed out
that there are a number of as
pects of ROTC that are "unique
and unusual."
Threaten Hank
These policies "threaten aca
demic rank," threaten the es
teem of a degree from Stanford,
and "may threaten the free in

tellectual development at Stan
ford," Kostelanetz said.
Thomas noted that his pro
pram "couldn't remain very
healthy" if academic credit was
discontinued. Enrollment in the
program might well drop if th°
environment became "more and
hostile to ROTC," he said.
The Navy ROTC department
is, over a two-year period, al
lowing students to complete pro
gram requirements in other de
partments, Thomas pointed out.
Brown questioned "the basis
of moral invulnerability from
which attacks on ROTC are
launched." He suggested that ac
ceptance of a 11-S deferment and
payment of taxes both repre
sent "individual sanctioning and
acceptance" of the current pol
icy in Vietnam.
Attacks on the academic con
tent of ROTC courses are mere
ly a "smoke screen," Brown
added.
Regular Departments
Brown did question the mode
of acceptance which allows
ROTC to remain on campus.
The University should provide
as many of these courses as
possible in regular departments,
he said.
It is also doubtful, Brown
said, whether the University
should be providing facilities to
ROTC to offer courses for cred
it.
ROTC courses are "trivial, an
ti-intellectual, wrongheaded, au
thoritarian," and worthless,"
Bernstein angrily charged in re
ferring to his own two-year
ROTC experience.
Bernstein also suggested that
ROTC professors are not "in
tellectually as free as other fac
ulty," but added that he does
not "have any evidence to sup
port" this contention.

ASSU ENCOUNTER —Faculty and administrators rarticipated in a panel discussion of the ROTC
urogram on campus yesterday in the Tresidder large lounge, demonstrating a wide variety of opinion.
The complexity surrounding
the current concern over aca
demic credit for ROTC was
brought home yesterday as four
faculty members and one admin
istrator participated in the first
ASSU Encounter.
The discussion in the large
lounge of Tresidder demon
strated that students, faculty,
and administrators are ap
proaching agreement on some
of the aspects involved. But
there will be considerably more
opinions exchanged before even
a partial resolution is reached.
Prof. Robert MacAfee Brown
cautioned the University from
dealing too hastily in resolving
the controversy. "I would hate
to see us approach a position of
what I like should stay and
what I don't like should go," he
said.
Last week's proposal before
the Academic Senate that aca
demic credit for ROTC be dis
continued next year "grew out of
the battle of Chicago . . . when
there was a great deal of ten
sion around Stanford," said
Asst. Prof. Anne Kostelanetz.
Co-Author
According to Miss Kostelanetz,
who co-authored the report
signed by ten faculty members,
the group felt that some action
needed to be taken before the
issues were taken up by stu
dents and the same sort of dis
ruptions occurred at Stanford.
Marine Col. Robert Thomas,
head of Navy ROTC, expressed
hope that some sort of agree
ment could be reached that
would be "supported wholeheart
edly by the entire University
community". The ROTC depart
ments welcome the review of
their courses by the Academic
Senate, Thomas said. But he
called on the faculty group to
issue a proposal "molded in rea
son and farsighted thought."
Credit
Asst. Prof. Barton Bernstein

expressed opposition to "ROTC
as a credit course . . . and as
an institution on a campus."
"I see no reason why I need
to acquice to instruct young
men who are being trained at
this institution to implement . . .
immoral and unwise policies,"
Bernstein said.
Vice Provost Howard Brooks
noted that his experiences sad
dling horses in ROTC before
World War II left him with a
different position towards the
program than Bernstein's two
year involvement of 15 years
ago.
His position of "retention, not
abolition" doesn't signify that
"I am in the least interested in
maintaining the status quo,"
Brooks said.
Universities, as institutions
benefiting from the fruits of the
American society, also "have an
obligation to contribute to the
benefits of this society," Brooks
noted.
Brown took exception with
this point and suggested that
the University might stress oth
er programs as well, such as the
Peace Corps.
'Pluralism'
A policy of allowing ROTC to
remain on campus comes from
belief in "pluralism of interest,"
Bernstein noted. He added that
he felt that certain "standards
of judgment" seemed to rule
against this belief.
Miss Kostelanetz concurred
with this opinion and insisted
that there afcf "standards of hu
manistic education which we as
faculty must uphold."
Referring to the report pre
sented to the Academic Senate,
Miss Kostelanetz pointed out
that there are a number of as
pects of ROTC that are "unique
and unusual."
Threaten Hank
These policies "threaten aca
demic rank," threaten the es
teem of a degree from Stanford,
and "may threaten the free in

tellectual development at Stan
ford," Kostelanetz said.
Thomas noted that his pro
pram "couldn't remain very
healthy" if academic credit was
discontinued. Enrollment in the
program might well drop if th°
environment became "more and
hostile to ROTC," he said.
The Navy ROTC department
is, over a two-year period, al
lowing students to complete pro
gram requirements in other de
partments, Thomas pointed out.
Brown questioned "the basis
of moral invulnerability from
which attacks on ROTC are
launched." He suggested that ac
ceptance of a 11-S deferment and
payment of taxes both repre
sent "individual sanctioning and
acceptance" of the current pol
icy in Vietnam.
Attacks on the academic con
tent of ROTC courses are mere
ly a "smoke screen," Brown
added.
Regular Departments
Brown did question the mode
of acceptance which allows
ROTC to remain on campus.
The University should provide
as many of these courses as
possible in regular departments,
he said.
It is also doubtful, Brown
said, whether the University
should be providing facilities to
ROTC to offer courses for cred
it.
ROTC courses are "trivial, an
ti-intellectual, wrongheaded, au
thoritarian," and worthless,"
Bernstein angrily charged in re
ferring to his own two-year
