# Government Aid Slashes Create Financial Crisis
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Stanford has suddenly been
thrust into a desperate financial
crisis because of recent govern
ment budget cutbacks.
Meanwhile, University offi
cials are trying to confront the
situation and dig the school out
of its monetary hole.
Reductions in grants and con
tracts to educational institutions
by most government agencies
may leave the University with
$10 million less than had been
expected for fiscal 1969.
As a result, Stanford is fac
ing a million-dollar deficit in its
own budget this academic year.
Besides slashes in appropria

tions for research from such
agencies as th" National Science
Foundation (NSF), Department
of Defense (DOD), Public Health
Service (PHS), and National
Aeronautics and Space Admin
istration (NASA), the Senate
passed an amendment to the
DOD bill yesterday that will
cost the school half a million
dollars.
The proposal, introduced by
Sen. Mike Mansfield (D-Mont.),
places a ceiling on indirect costs
of 25 percent of direct costs in
DOD research contracts.
Indirect costs are those in
maintaining facilities so that the
contracted research can be

undertaken.
The measure must still be ap
proved by the joint Senate-House
Conference Committee.
The agency cutbacks were
necessitated by a Senate de
mand that the ten per cent sur
tax be accompanied by a $6
billion reduction in snending.
NSF Hit Hard
One of the agencies hardest
hit by the cuts in the NSF, which
operates under the Bu
rea>' of the Budget. NSF has
s ashed Stanford research funds
from an "xnected $9.5 milMon
down to $6.9 million.
Nearly $900,000 allotted for
traineeships and instruction has
been left alone, however.
Vice President for Finance
Kenneth Cuthbertson said the
cuts mean Stanford is "going to
be pushed into a deficit this
year.'"
Frank Riddle, reports and
analysis manager in the Control
' r's office, concurred, and
placed the d bt at "well over
a million dollars" if the Mans
field amendment receives final
Congressional approval.
Research Projects
Almost all of the other monies
lost are in research projects,
which can br> curtailed or de
layed, but the indirect costs,
which the Mansfield Amendment
would slash, help pay for the
day-to-day operation of the Uni
versity.
According to Riddle, income
from indirect costs — building
maintenance, salaries for sec
retaries and technicians, equip
ment, and the like — make up
25 per cent of the University's
general funds.
Cuthbertson said the half-mil
lion lost here, costs which must
be picked up by the school, is
enough in itself to cause a defi
cit.
The rest of the deficit comes
from the fact that research proj
ects presently in progress can
not be phased down quickly
enough to keep costs under the
new limits.. Stanford will have
to cover the difference.
Cruellest Cut
The cut in NSF funds is per
haps the cruellest of all, for the
Foundation has decidcd to let
each school slice their own proj
ects, merely setting a limit on
the total they can spend.
This differs from other agen
cies, which are cutting costs
project by project, dealing with
each principal investigator in
dividually.
But with the NSF's method,
the process for reducing ex
penditures becomes a "fantas
tic piece of bookkeeping," ac
cording to William F. Baxter,
professor of law and chairman
of the Research Policy Commit
tee of the Academic Council.
Projects, for the most part,
will not be eliminated. What will
happen is that existing research
will have to be extended past
the original time, since less than
the full grant can be spent this
year.
Numerous Headaches
How the NSF funds reduc
tions will be apportioned is a
matter that has been causing
numerous headaches among the
faculty and administration over
the past few days.
The Research Policy Commit
tee and deans of the affected
schools met Tuesday and Wed

nesday to discuss the problem
and make recommendations to
the Provost's Office.
The principal investigators in
volved will meet with the pro
vost or his representative Mon
day to work on details.
If the general recommenda
tions of the Committee are fol
lowed, the administration will
"try to preserve traineeships
and the cost of education for
students and make allocations"
of the funds "to schools based on
last year's expenditures," ac
cording to William F. Miller,
associate provost and profes
sor of computer science.
Student Support
The general expectation is
that sti:dent support will be
maintained. This view was
echoed by both William R. Ram
bo, associate dean for research
in tho School of Engineering,
and Donald R. Price, assistant
lean in Humanities and Scien
ces.
The level of cutbacks differ
from agency to agency. NSF and
NASA are the worst hit, while
the Atomic Energy Commission
had the smallest budget reduc
tion.
At Stanford, the research
money withheld is as follows:
NSF: $9.5 million expected,
$6.9 million received; net loss,
$2.6 million.
PHS: $12.2 million expected;
predicted cut of 17 per cent; net
loss, $2.1 million.
DOD: $17.8 million expected;
$.5 mil ion lost in indirect costs;
approximately 15 per cent of re
mainder wi'l be cut from new
and renewed contracts; net loss
of $3.1 million.
NASA: $3.9 million expected;
predicted cutback of one-third;
not loss of $1.3 million.
Office of Education: $3.3 mil
lion expected; predicted reduc
tion of 17 per cent; net loss of
$.5 million.
Other agencies: $1.2 million
pected; 30 per cent loss planned;
net loss of $.4 million.
$10 Million Total
This gives a total loss in re
search funds of $10 million, out
of a total University-wide re
s arch budget (excluding SLAC)
of $46.1 million, or more than
20 per cent.
The oi tlook for the future is
q"estionablo. Cuthbertson noted
that if the cuts are restoreed in
1969-70, "we'll be alright," but
added that the chances "don't
look good."
As Riddle commented, "We
expanded on soft money, oppor
tunity money, and forged ahead.
We took gambles, and now the
chickens are here. It's a hard
picture."
is hope this year for
DOD contracts. The Senate ap
proved the Defense appropria
tion without the expected 10-20
r- r cent cut which had been
made by the House. Its fate now
lies in the Conference Commit
ter.
The departments which will
feel the NSF squeeze the most
are those in the physical scien
ces division of the School of
Humanities and Sciences, and

haps the cruellest of all, for the
Foundation has decidcd to let
each school slice their own proj
ects, merely setting a limit on
the total they can spend.
This differs from other agen
cies, which are cutting costs
project by project, dealing with
each principal investigator in
dividually.
But with the NSF's method,
the process for reducing ex
penditures becomes a "fantas
tic piece of bookkeeping," ac
cording to William F. Baxter,
professor of law and chairman
of the Research Policy Commit
tee of the Academic Council.
Projects, for the most part,
will not be eliminated. What will
happen is that existing research
will have to be extended past
the original time, since less than
the full grant can be spent this
year.
Numerous Headaches
How the NSF funds reduc
tions will be apportioned is a
matter that has been causing
numerous headaches among the
faculty and administration over
the past few days.
The Research Policy Commit
tee and deans of the affected
schools met Tuesday and Wed

nesday to discuss the problem
and make recommendations to
the Provost's Office.
The principal investigators in
volved will meet with the pro
vost or his representative Mon
day to work on details.
If the general recommenda
tions of the Committee are fol
lowed, the administration will
"try to preserve traineeships
and the cost of education for
students and make allocations"
of the funds "to schools based on
last year's expenditures," ac
cording to William F. Miller,
associate provost and profes
sor of computer science.
Student Support
The general expectation is
that sti:dent support will be
maintained. This view was
echoed by both William R. Ram
bo, associate dean for research
in tho School of Engineering,
and Donald R. Price, assistant
lean in Humanities and Scien
ces.
The level of cutbacks differ
from agency to agency. NSF and
NASA are the worst hit, while
the Atomic Energy Commission
had the smallest budget reduc
tion.
At Stanford, the research
money withheld is as follows:
NSF: $9.5 million expected,
$6.9 million received; net loss,
$2.6 million.
PHS: $12.2 million expected;
predicted cut of 17 per cent; net
loss, $2.1 million.
DOD: $17.8 million expected;
$.5 mil ion lost in indirect costs;
approximately 15 per cent of re
mainder wi'l be cut from new
and renewed contracts; net loss
of $3.1 million.
NASA: $3.9 million expected;
predicted cutback of one-third;
not loss of $1.3 million.
Office of Education: $3.3 mil
lion expected; predicted reduc
tion of 17 per cent; net loss of
$.5 million.
Other agencies: $1.2 million
pected; 30 per cent loss planned;
net loss of $.4 million.
$10 Million Total
This gives a total loss in re
search funds of $10 million, out
of a total University-wide re
s arch budget (excluding SLAC)
of $46.1 million, or more than
20 per cent.
The oi tlook for the future is
q"estionablo. Cuthbertson noted
that if the cuts are restoreed in
1969-70, "we'll be alright," but
added that the chances "don't
look good."
As Riddle commented, "We
expanded on soft money, oppor
tunity money, and forged ahead.
We took gambles, and now the
chickens are here. It's a hard
picture."
is hope this year for
DOD contracts. The Senate ap
proved the Defense appropria
tion without the expected 10-20
r- r cent cut which had been
made by the House. Its fate now
lies in the Conference Commit
ter.
The departments which will
feel the NSF squeeze the most
are those in the physical scien
ces division of the School of
Humanities and Sciences, and
hcmical engineering and ma
terials science in the School of
Engineering.
Stanford has suddenly been
thrust into a desperate financial
crisis because of recent govern
ment budget cutbacks.
Meanwhile, University offi
cials are trying to confront the
situation and dig the school out
of its monetary hole.
Reductions in grants and con
tracts to educational institutions
by most government agencies
may leave the University with
$10 million less than had been
expected for fiscal 1969.
As a result, Stanford is fac
ing a million-dollar deficit in its
own budget this academic year.
Besides slashes in appropria

tions for research from such
agencies as th" National Science
Foundation (NSF), Department
of Defense (DOD), Public Health
Service (PHS), and National
Aeronautics and Space Admin
istration (NASA), the Senate
passed an amendment to the
DOD bill yesterday that will
cost the school half a million
dollars.
The proposal, introduced by
Sen. Mike Mansfield (D-Mont.),
places a ceiling on indirect costs
of 25 percent of direct costs in
DOD research contracts.
Indirect costs are those in
maintaining facilities so that the
contracted research can be

undertaken.
The measure must still be ap
proved by the joint Senate-House
Conference Committee.
The agency cutbacks were
necessitated by a Senate de
mand that the ten per cent sur
tax be accompanied by a $6
billion reduction in snending.
NSF Hit Hard
One of the agencies hardest
hit by the cuts in the NSF, which
operates under the Bu
rea>' of the Budget. NSF has
s ashed Stanford research funds
from an "xnected $9.5 milMon
down to $6.9 million.
Nearly $900,000 allotted for
traineeships and instruction has
been left alone, however.
Vice President for Finance
Kenneth Cuthbertson said the
cuts mean Stanford is "going to
be pushed into a deficit this
year.'"
Frank Riddle, reports and
analysis manager in the Control
' r's office, concurred, and
placed the d bt at "well over
a million dollars" if the Mans
field amendment receives final
Congressional approval.
Research Projects
Almost all of the other monies
lost are in research projects,
which can br> curtailed or de
layed, but the indirect costs,
which the Mansfield Amendment
would slash, help pay for the
day-to-day operation of the Uni
versity.
According to Riddle, income
from indirect costs — building
maintenance, salaries for sec
retaries and technicians, equip
ment, and the like — make up
25 per cent of the University's
general funds.
Cuthbertson said the half-mil
lion lost here, costs which must
be picked up by the school, is
enough in itself to cause a defi
cit.
The rest of the deficit comes
from the fact that research proj
ects presently in progress can
not be phased down quickly
enough to keep costs under the
new limits.. Stanford will have
to cover the difference.

DOD contracts. The Senate ap
proved the Defense appropria
tion without the expected 10-20
r- r cent cut which had been
made by the House. Its fate now
lies in the Conference Commit
ter.
The departments which will
feel the NSF squeeze the most
are those in the physical scien

Stanford has suddenly been
thrust into a desperate financial
crisis because of recent govern
ment budget cutbacks.
Meanwhile, University offi
cials are trying to confront the
situation and dig the school out
of its monetary hole.
Reductions in grants and con
tracts to educational institutions
by most government agencies
may leave the University with
$10 million less than had been
expected for fiscal 1969.
As a result, Stanford is fac
ing a million-dollar deficit in its
own budget this academic year.
Besides slashes in appropria

tions for research from such
agencies as th" National Science
Foundation (NSF), Department
of Defense (DOD), Public Health
Service (PHS), and National
Aeronautics and Space Admin
istration (NASA), the Senate
passed an amendment to the
DOD bill yesterday that will
cost the school half a million
dollars.
The proposal, introduced by
Sen. Mike Mansfield (D-Mont.),
places a ceiling on indirect costs
of 25 percent of direct costs in
DOD research contracts.
Indirect costs are those in
maintaining facilities so that the
contracted research can be

undertaken.
The measure must still be ap
proved by the joint Senate-House
Conference Committee.
The agency cutbacks were
necessitated by a Senate de
mand that the ten per cent sur
tax be accompanied by a $6
billion reduction in snending.
NSF Hit Hard
One of the agencies hardest
hit by the cuts in the NSF, which
operates under the Bu
rea>' of the Budget. NSF has
s ashed Stanford research funds
from an "xnected $9.5 milMon
down to $6.9 million.
Nearly $900,000 allotted for
traineeships and instruction has
been left alone, however.
Vice President for Finance
Kenneth Cuthbertson said the
cuts mean Stanford is "going to
be pushed into a deficit this
year.'"
Frank Riddle, reports and
analysis manager in the Control
' r's office, concurred, and
placed the d bt at "well over
a million dollars" if the Mans
field amendment receives final
Congressional approval.
Research Projects
Almost all of the other monies
lost are in research projects,
which can br> curtailed or de
layed, but the indirect costs,
which the Mansfield Amendment
would slash, help pay for the
day-to-day operation of the Uni
versity.
According to Riddle, income
from indirect costs — building
maintenance, salaries for sec
retaries and technicians, equip
ment, and the like — make up
25 per cent of the University's
general funds.
Cuthbertson said the half-mil
lion lost here, costs which must
be picked up by the school, is
enough in itself to cause a defi
cit.
The rest of the deficit comes
from the fact that research proj
ects presently in progress can
not be phased down quickly
enough to keep costs under the
new limits.. Stanford will have
to cover the difference.
Cruellest Cut
The cut in NSF funds is per
haps the cruellest of all, for the
Foundation has decidcd to let
each school slice their own proj
ects, merely setting a limit on
the total they can spend.
This differs from other agen
cies, which are cutting costs
project by project, dealing with
each principal investigator in
dividually.
But with the NSF's method,
the process for reducing ex
penditures becomes a "fantas
tic piece of bookkeeping," ac
cording to William F. Baxter,
professor of law and chairman
of the Research Policy Commit
tee of the Academic Council.
Projects, for the most part,
will not be eliminated. What will
happen is that existing research
will have to be extended past
the original time, since less than
the full grant can be spent this
year.
Numerous Headaches
How the NSF funds reduc
tions will be apportioned is a
matter that has been causing
numerous headaches among the
faculty and administration over
the past few days.
The Research Policy Commit
tee and deans of the affected
schools met Tuesday and Wed

nesday to discuss the problem
and make recommendations to
the Provost's Office.
The principal investigators in
volved will meet with the pro
vost or his representative Mon
day to work on details.
If the general recommenda
tions of the Committee are fol
lowed, the administration will
"try to preserve traineeships
and the cost of education for
students and make allocations"
of the funds "to schools based on
last year's expenditures," ac
cording to William F. Miller,
associate provost and profes
sor of computer science.
Student Support
The general expectation is
that sti:dent support will be
maintained. This view was
echoed by both William R. Ram
bo, associate dean for research
in tho School of Engineering,
and Donald R. Price, assistant
lean in Humanities and Scien
ces.
The level of cutbacks differ
from agency to agency. NSF and
NASA are the worst hit, while
the Atomic Energy Commission
had the smallest budget reduc
tion.
At Stanford, the research
money withheld is as follows:
NSF: $9.5 million expected,
$6.9 million received; net loss,
$2.6 million.
PHS: $12.2 million expected;
predicted cut of 17 per cent; net
loss, $2.1 million.
DOD: $17.8 million expected;
$.5 mil ion lost in indirect costs;
approximately 15 per cent of re
mainder wi'l be cut from new
and renewed contracts; net loss
of $3.1 million.
NASA: $3.9 million expected;
predicted cutback of one-third;
not loss of $1.3 million.
Office of Education: $3.3 mil
lion expected; predicted reduc
tion of 17 per cent; net loss of
$.5 million.
Other agencies: $1.2 million

net loss of $.4 million.

' r's office, concurred, and
placed the d bt at "well over
a million dollars" if the Mans
field amendment receives final
Congressional approval.
Research Projects
Almost all of the other monies
lost are in research projects,
which can br> curtailed or de
layed, but the indirect costs,
which the Mansfield Amendment
would slash, help pay for the
day-to-day operation of the Uni
versity.
According to Riddle, income
from indirect costs — building
maintenance, salaries for sec
retaries and technicians, equip
ment, and the like — make up
25 per cent of the University's
general funds.
Cuthbertson said the half-mil
lion lost here, costs which must
be picked up by the school, is
enough in itself to cause a defi
cit.
The rest of the deficit comes
from the fact that research proj
ects presently in progress can
not be phased down quickly
enough to keep costs under the
new limits.. Stanford will have
to cover the difference.
Cruellest Cut
The cut in NSF funds is per
haps the cruellest of all, for the
Foundation has decidcd to let
each school slice their own proj
ects, merely setting a limit on
the total they can spend.
This differs from other agen
cies, which are cutting costs
project by project, dealing with
each principal investigator in
dividually.
But with the NSF's method,
the process for reducing ex
penditures becomes a "fantas
tic piece of bookkeeping," ac
cording to William F. Baxter,
professor of law and chairman
of the Research Policy Commit
tee of the Academic Council.
Projects, for the most part,
will not be eliminated. What will
happen is that existing research
will have to be extended past
the original time, since less than
the full grant can be spent this
year.
Numerous Headaches
How the NSF funds reduc
tions will be apportioned is a
matter that has been causing
numerous headaches among the
faculty and administration over
the past few days.
The Research Policy Commit
tee and deans of the affected
schools met Tuesday and Wed

nesday to discuss the problem
and make recommendations to
the Provost's Office.
The principal investigators in
volved will meet with the pro
vost or his representative Mon
day to work on details.
If the general recommenda
tions of the Committee are fol
lowed, the administration will
"try to preserve traineeships
and the cost of education for
students and make allocations"
of the funds "to schools based on
last year's expenditures," ac
cording to William F. Miller,
associate provost and profes
sor of computer science.
Student Support
The general expectation is
that sti:dent support will be
maintained. This view was
echoed by both William R. Ram
bo, associate dean for research
in tho School of Engineering,
and Donald R. Price, assistant
lean in Humanities and Scien
ces.
The level of cutbacks differ
from agency to agency. NSF and
NASA are the worst hit, while
the Atomic Energy Commission
had the smallest budget reduc
tion.
At Stanford, the research
money withheld is as follows:
NSF: $9.5 million expected,
$6.9 million received; net loss,
$2.6 million.
PHS: $12.2 million expected;
predicted cut of 17 per cent; net
loss, $2.1 million.
DOD: $17.8 million expected;
$.5 mil ion lost in indirect costs;
approximately 15 per cent of re
mainder wi'l be cut from new
and renewed contracts; net loss
of $3.1 million.
NASA: $3.9 million expected;
predicted cutback of one-third;
not loss of $1.3 million.
Office of Education: $3.3 mil
lion expected; predicted reduc
tion of 17 per cent; net loss of
$.5 million.
Other agencies: $1.2 million
pected; 30 per cent loss planned;
net loss of $.4 million.
$10 Million Total
This gives a total loss in re
search funds of $10 million, out
of a total University-wide re
s arch budget (excluding SLAC)
of $46.1 million, or more than
20 per cent.
The oi tlook for the future is
q"estionablo. Cuthbertson noted
that if the cuts are restoreed in
1969-70, "we'll be alright," but
added that the chances "don't
look good."
As Riddle commented, "We
expanded on soft money, oppor
tunity money, and forged ahead.
We took gambles, and now the
chickens are here. It's a hard
picture."
is hope this year for
DOD contracts. The Senate ap
proved the Defense appropria
tion without the expected 10-20
r- r cent cut which had been
made by the House. Its fate now
lies in the Conference Commit
ter.
The departments which will
feel the NSF squeeze the most
are those in the physical scien
ces division of the School of
Humanities and Sciences, and
hcmical engineering and ma
terials science in the School of
Engineering.
Stanford has suddenly been
thrust into a desperate financial
crisis because of recent govern
ment budget cutbacks.
Meanwhile, University offi
cials are trying to confront the
situation and dig the school out
of its monetary hole.
Reductions in grants and con
tracts to educational institutions
by most government agencies
may leave the University with
$10 million less than had been
expected for fiscal 1969.
As a result, Stanford is fac
ing a million-dollar deficit in its
own budget this academic year.
Besides slashes in appropria

tions for research from such
agencies as th" National Science
Foundation (NSF), Department
of Defense (DOD), Public Health
Service (PHS), and National
Aeronautics and Space Admin
istration (NASA), the Senate
passed an amendment to the
DOD bill yesterday that will
cost the school half a million
dollars.
The proposal, introduced by
Sen. Mike Mansfield (D-Mont.),
places a ceiling on indirect costs
of 25 percent of direct costs in
DOD research contracts.
Indirect costs are those in
maintaining facilities so that the
contracted research can be

undertaken.
The measure must still be ap
proved by the joint Senate-House
Conference Committee.
The agency cutbacks were
necessitated by a Senate de
mand that the ten per cent sur
tax be accompanied by a $6
billion reduction in snending.
NSF Hit Hard
One of the agencies hardest
hit by the cuts in the NSF, which
operates under the Bu
rea>' of the Budget. NSF has
s ashed Stanford research funds
from an "xnected $9.5 milMon
down to $6.9 million.
Nearly $900,000 allotted for
traineeships and instruction has
been left alone, however.
Vice President for Finance
Kenneth Cuthbertson said the
cuts mean Stanford is "going to
be pushed into a deficit this
year.'"

analysis manager in the Control
' r's office, concurred, and
