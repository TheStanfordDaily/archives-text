### TIM HAIGHT 
We may not be too far away
from the time heckling becomes
a capital crime. To hear our
major politicians, the heckling
of the left is balanced against
the assassinations of the right,
or the lynchings in the South.
This is insane. Heckling isn't
illegal. It may be bad manners,
in that it defies the notion that
the only person who has a right
to speak is the man who has
hired the hall and invited the
public.
What Hubert Humphrey fails
to realize is that if those people
who were shouting at him were
really committed "anarchists"
and "nihilists", they would kill
him, or stay at home studying
small group tactics and waiting
for their chance. You don't find
the Viet Cong picketing the Na
tional Assembly in Saigon.
History is full of assassina
tions and bombings. It is so full
of hecklings that they are hard
ly mentioned. Nelson Rockefel
ler was booed at the 1964 Re
publican Convention by the
same people who now cry "law
and order." When Senator Abra
ham Ribicoff had the floor of the
Democratic National Convention
this August and deviated from
the normal total vapidity of po
litical rhetoric to discuss Mayor
Daley's "Gestapo tactics"—May
or Daley did not call in the po
lice to quell the boos that fol
lowed. Of course not. Daley was
one of those doing the booing.
But let a bunch of "hippies"
try to sleep in a park and hun
dreds of police will have to post
pone fighting rape, arson, mur
der, and theft to rout them out.
Let a group of socialists in Ber
keley sponsor a rally that blocks
a few paltry blocks of space on
a Friday night and again hun
dreds of cops must attend.
The response does not fit the

crime. And with the rising rates
of crime—murder, rape, robbery
—that nobody endorses, valuable
time is being wasted.
Of course, police justify their
suppression of demonstrators by
pointing to the sometimes wild
statements of a few of their
"leaders" in the newspapers.
While it is true that David Del
lenger or Tom Hayden may oc
casionally make an extreme
statement, it is also true that
if we took George Wallace at
his word, about running over
hippies with his car (murder)
or attacking Washington bur
eaucrats with their briefcases,
(assault) then Wallace and all
his followers should be locked
up.
Of course, that would leave
the police short-handed. Most of
them are for Wallace.
It is clear that the real crisis
in this country is not a break
down in law and order but an
inability of an inherently inse
cure national spirit to accept the
challenges of people who want
to live their own lives.
Many observers of American
culture have noted the supposed
lack of overt authority in our
society. In several European
countries, one's advancement de
pends on how he scores in
school tests administered by the
state. His religion is often in
the hands of a bureaucracy and
his soul secure if he performs
given rituals.
This has never been the case
in the U.S. If a person doesn't
get into Stanford, he can try
Cal. If not there, San Jose State,
Foothill, or the Ajax Police
Academy. His religion and his
conscience are considered per
sonal matters. Our history is
full of reformed failures, of men
overcoming adversity, of Hora
tio Algers.
But not everybody can make

it. While the Wallace supporters
are convinced they have freedom
of initiative, it is all but certain
that few of them will become
millionaires. They have to justi
fy that failure, and since their
myths forbid their blaming the
social system, they find other
devices.
Other than self-hatred, the us
ual devices are conformity, rac
ism, and paranoia. It is nothing
new to the United States, to
criticise people for being differ
ent. But foreign observers say
that the pressure here seems ex
treme. If this seems exagger
ated, look at how hard we have
to fight just to like our kind of
music, wear our hair our way,
or even use our own slang.
Racism has given the egotisti
cal lower- and middle-class male
a whipping boy. When he runs
into a conflict between the upper
class's tight hold on money and
power and the American myth
of "success through hard work,"
he can hate niggers.
People often look to others
for their identities, and they
look to their children — often
named after them in the hope
of immortal life —for justifica
tion of themselves. When the
children don't deliver the proper
praise—the kind a jealous God
expects—they are cast into Hell.
As Art Hoppe mentioned re
cently people have smoked
dope, lived with little money,
baiiied seldom, and worn flashy
clothes for a long time. Remem
ber the poor? Nobody minded
that. What causes trouble is
when white kids choose to live
that way. Then the oldsters'
identity crisis begins.
The frightening thing is that
this column sounds like a foot
note to Erich Fromm's Escape
from Freedom, when he discuss
es the causes of the Nazi revo
lution.
