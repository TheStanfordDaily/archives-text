## Groovy Graphics Defended

Editor, The Daily:
As far as I am concerned, Mr.
Michaels can go bite himself.
For the first time in three
years I have found The Daily
of interest. As Mr. Goose once
said, it is "Interesting! Provoca
tive! Well seasoned!"
The Daily is no New York
Times, but then again it has
never pretended to be. Rather
it has always been just another
college daily. At least now it has
assumed a little character of its
own.
And though I am not qualified
to be a journalistic critic, I cer
tainly do not find the editorial
content of The Daily to be "nau
seating" or "disgusting" (adjec
tives Mr. Michaels is fond of).
I think you should be con
gratulated for showing us what
college is all about — for think

ing on your own and making
others sit up, take notice, and
think away some of their own
cobwebs.

• Reckoning IS ear
Editor, The Daily:
Goy world: the day of reckon
ing is at hand. We are waiting
for the Wilbur Food Service to
distribute the yellow stars.
It was flagrantly brought to
our attention that: 1. Last Mon
day — Rosh Hashanah — pork
chops were served for dinner.
2. The menu for Yom Kippur —
sacred day of fasting was one
of the few Wilbur meals that is
edible by mankind — turkey.
This is a direct insult against
Stanford's Jewish population by
the Wilbur Food Service.

• Chivalry Lives?
Editor, The Daily:
.Havelock Ellis said that "Chiv
alry is the art of treating a
woman as a cross between an
angel and an idiot." If that is an
accurate definition then I would
like to congratulate the Gradu
ate School of Business and the
Stanford Management Intern
Program on their celebration of
their somewhat medieval, but
charming, chivalric values.
The composite picture drawn
in Wednesday's article entitled
"Biz School Women Attractive
Asset" is of a competent and
useful member of the Stanford
community. The attitude repre
sented in the Business School
belies this picture entirely.
If the purpose of admitting
women is indeed, only to " . . .
pick things up a little," why not
instead recruit topless dancers
or upstairs maids? I found form
er Dean Arbuckle's statement
particularly dismaying. He "val
ued" women in the School "be
cause they raise the competitive
spirit of the men. The men work
harder to prove that it is a man's
world after all." .
What kind of rationale is that
for admitting women? Are the
men students really in need of
so outmoded, provincial and prej

udicial an inspiration as the
maintenance of a man's world?
Is it still a man's world? With
attitudes such as those expres
sed by students and faculty in
the article, i.e., women are win
dow dressing, decorative but
hardly functioned, it will prob
ably remain so.
There is going to be a lot of
creativity and potential and
many degrees stirred up in mac
aroni and cheese casseroles and
pablum — lost forever, simply
because there is no place they
can be used.
An indication of this could
be found in the registration
packet advertisement for the
Stanford Management Intern
Program. After outlining what
appears to be a stimulating and
successful program for introduc
ing students to management po
sitions, the catch in the whole
operation is revealed. "Because
companies in the past have been
reluctant to hire freshman and
women, the program is thus pri
marily intended for male sopho
mores, juniors, and returning
seniors."
I feel sure that it is a safe as
sumption to say that the ma
jority of participating companies
purport to be Equal Opportun
ities employers. In other words,
race and/or religion will not be
a consideration, but sex will.
There's rumor circulating here
at Stanford that chivalry is dead.
J protest ... it is alive and well
in the halls of the Graduate
School of Business. It's a fine art
—treating a woman as a cross
between an angel and an idiot.
I wish it were a forgotten one.

• Packet Tempest
Editor, The Daily:
A recent letter to The Dally
complaining about the inclusion
of "The Goods on Pitzer" bulle
tin in the registration packet

prompts me to clarify some prev
alent misunderstandings about
the rights and regulations con
cerning the reg packet.
The packet is put together on
the Sunday before each Reg
Day in TMU. Alpha Phi Omega,
National Service Fraternity,
supervises the operation as a
service, and Dave Swift (ASSU
Financial Manager) has the au
thority to censor any material
which is in extremely poor
taste. Those who desire to stuff
materials in the packet merely
arrive at the scheduled time and
room with 12,000 pieces and two
people to help with the stuffing.
Anyone affiliated with Stan
ford is allowed to distribute his
material in the packets, but no
one is allowed to independently
distribute to people waiting in
reg lines (that's why we have
a reg packet).
While I personally agree that
slanted and unfair remarks were
made in the Pitzer bulletin, I
cannot conclude (as Miss Ma
honey does in her letter) that
Stanford's freedom of speech
was violated. On the contrary,
anyone could have placed a fa
vorable information sheet about
President Pitzer in the same
packet, simply by volunteering
to do so.
