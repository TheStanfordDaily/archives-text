## Wyler's 'Funny Girl' 
### TODD McCARTHY 
"Funny Girl" avoids the hazards which have
meant the decline of the filmusical as art and
entertainment. Most recent productions, "Came
lot," "Half a Sixpence" have reduced actors to
singing narrators of travelogues.
But, like the great musicals of the "50's," "Fun
ny Girl" concentrates on one vibrant character.
The enthusiasm and sparkle of that character
generate more than enough energy to carry the
rest of the film.
The main character in this case, of course, is
played by Barbra Streisand. In her screen de
but, she displays such theatrical and emotional
virtuosity that her performance transcends nor
mal musical comedy limitations and becomes
truly dramatic and involving.
Even with la Streisand's performance, the film
could have proved unsatisfying. What clinches
its success is the direction of William Wyler.
Though he is considered by many critics to
be a "distinguished" director, Wyler does not
have a great following among film enthusiasts.
This raises an interesting question in regard to
the aims of a director. Should he stamp all his
films with a characteristic style and point of view
about people and life in general? Or should he
submerge his personality in the film and adapt
his style to his materia l .
First Musical
"Funny Girl" is Wyler's first musical. He has
already also mastered suspense "The Collector,"
"The Desperate Hours," drama "The Little
Foxes," "Detective Story" and romance "Wuther

ing Heights," "Romnn Holiday." has won O'-
cars for "Mrs. Miniver," "The B' St of Our
Lives," and "Ben Hur," three "big" films of vary
ing merit.
If the goal of the director is indeed to adar 4
his skills to each project, Wvler is the re
fect helmsman, for in none of his films is his
persona' direction made obvious.
His work is never pretentious, self-indulgent or
cute.
This does not, however, preclude cine
matic moments in films. In "Funny Girl"
there is the song, "Don't Rnin on My Parade,"
the perfect example of a stage number "opened
up" for the screen. During the course of the
number. Streisand proceeds by train from Balti
more to New York, by foot to the harbor anÂ«i by
tugboat out into the ocean in pursuit of her hus
band-to-be, Nick Arnstein.
Occasional Miscasting
Ray Stark, Fanny Brice's son-in-law. made a
fi w minor blunders in producing film. Omar
Sharif was mis-cast as lover-gambler Arnstein;
Frank Sinatra or David Janssen would have bet
ter choices. The practically tuneless second act
runs on too long. Some good numbers from the
original were cut and a couple of average ones
added.
These are minor reservations, however. With
"Funny Girl," Barbra Streisand has proven that
there is no province of show business she can not
conquer; William Wyler has mastered a new
milieu and Hollywood has been blessed with one
of its few great screen musicals.
