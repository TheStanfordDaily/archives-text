# DAVID and Goliath
## 
### 
Insanity's feathery wing has brushed the face of Stanford three
times in as many weeks. Our football team is undefeated.
After numberless years of quest, Stanford has found a quarter
back who can throw, ends who can catch, tacklers who can tackle,
and perhaps even a coach who can coach.
Many fans already sense an unfamiliar fragance in the air, a per
fume that last wafted across the Quad in 1952. It's been a long time.
Before we get stoned on this new scent, let us look ahead. On
Saturday looms the joust with the University of Southern Cali
fornia. Coach McKey's giants have ground the Indian beak into
the turf for ten straight years now.
With a bit of flair, daring, and adventure, our team might just
do the impossible. Like David did to Goliath.
