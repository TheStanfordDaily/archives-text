# Oh,Christ

### PAUL RUPERT 
Last Fall I was walking with
several friends in New York,
discussing the power structure
and seeking an ice cream cone.
One of my companions had spent
a greater part of his life in Lat
in America. He is painfully
aware of the miserable condi
tions throughout that continent,
and for the past few years he
has been researching the Ameri
can corporations which domi
nate most of the Latin econo
mies.
As Art Melville said last week,
as every scholar of the Empire
knows, the United Fruit Com
pany is a classic parasite. In pur
suit of the banana market, it
has come to be a major power
in at least five Central American
countries. It can dictate govern
ments, feed or starve thousands,
and generally decide how mil
lions of people will live.
Thus the Banana Boycott re
cently launched by AVILA
(Avoid Vietnam in Latin Ameri
ca).
While many do not view ab
stention from use of the banana
as a great sacrifice, consider
Baskin-Robbins. There we were,
hell-bent for Blueberry cheese
cake on a sugar cone, when an

other friend Joined us and told
us the terrifying news: "United
Fruit has bought out Baskin-
Robbins and A&W."
The People's Ice Cream
No one had to say it: if you
eat that ice cream cone, you're
contributing to United Fruit's
profits (and power) and adding
another straw to the burden on
the backs of the Latins. Amid
much cursing and defiant cries
that 'ice cream belongs to the
people', we went to a store which
sold coffee and vanilla on plain
cones.
Many of you are probably say
ing 'Oh, Christ!, is there no pure
pleasure left?' Perhaps I am
crazy or have no grasp of politi
cal reality.
Needless to say, the likelihood
of my crippling the American
Empire by refusing to cooperate
with United Fruit's subsidiaries
is not a complete solution. But
since the problem is an impov
erished world, kept poor so that
we might continue to enjoy our
luxuries, we have to look at each
of our luxuries and ask our
selves why we do what we do.
There in both symbolic and
material importance in a 'silly'
and 'politically ineffective' notion
like a Baskin-Robbins boycott.

Imagine yourself picketing the
store downtown, explaining to
passersby tha* they are support
ing a wage o* 30 or 40 cents a
day for the Guatemalan worker.
Since many don't even know
where Guatemala is, let alone
how the U.S. controls it, there
is much to be taught. Or sup
pose you are in a car full of your
friends and someone says "let's
go to B-R for a guava cone":
there is another chance.
Boycotts Are Educational
Thus, the educational value of
such a boycott is obvious. A
tougher argument comes on the
question of effectiveness.
I would be among the first to
admit that this kind of boycott
on this issue will hardly whip
the corporate giant into line. But
you don't need an ice cream cone
either.
That is to say, we are very
used to incredible abundance. To

give anything up is a sacrifice.
Thus I have to convince you
that yorr abstention is both ab
solutely necessary and 'political
ly effective' before you will con
"ider doing it.
But I suggest we turn the ta
bles. You tell me how you justi
fy eating ice cream cones at all,
let alone in the face of the fact
that by so doing you are in the
smallest (but most important)
way building a world you often
decry.
I can think of another mani
festation of the problem: your
draft card, if you're a guy or
your boy friend's d'-aft card if
you're a girl. The same educa
tional, symbolic element is here.
Things are a little easier here
because the whole question is
more clear. Most people want ice
cream cones—fewer really hun
ger for draft cards.
Again the question of "politi

ral eff ctiveness' Is raised. But
it should be argued with full
awareness of our preference for
luxurious solutions and our fear
of sacrifice. Our distaste for jail
docs not help us decide what is
a politically rffective act. That
question must be answered by
honest analysis.
In the participatory empire,
nobody is clean. As Prof. Robert
McAfee Brown said
those who ask the university to
withdraw from the empire, who
ask professors to stop doing de
fense-related research, who con
demn the university as racist—
all those who are 'against the
war'—all of us should examine
our relationship to the institu
tions we condemn.
If th rt ties are there, perhaps
we should sever them. If that
means no more draft card or no
more blueberry cheesecake, so
be it.

store downtown, explaining to
passersby tha* they are support
ing a wage o* 30 or 40 cents a
day for the Guatemalan worker.
Since many don't even know
where Guatemala is, let alone
how the U.S. controls it, there
is much to be taught. Or sup
pose you are in a car full of your
friends and someone says "let's
go to B-R for a guava cone":
there is another chance.
Boycotts Are Educational
Thus, the educational value of
such a boycott is obvious. A
tougher argument comes on the
question of effectiveness.
I would be among the first to
admit that this kind of boycott
on this issue will hardly whip
the corporate giant into line. But
you don't need an ice cream cone
either.
That is to say, we are very
used to incredible abundance. To

give anything up is a sacrifice.
Thus I have to convince you
that yorr abstention is both ab
solutely necessary and 'political
ly effective' before you will con
"ider doing it.
But I suggest we turn the ta
bles. You tell me how you justi
fy eating ice cream cones at all,
let alone in the face of the fact
that by so doing you are in the
smallest (but most important)
way building a world you often
decry.
I can think of another mani
festation of the problem: your
draft card, if you're a guy or
your boy friend's d'-aft card if
you're a girl. The same educa
tional, symbolic element is here.
Things are a little easier here
because the whole question is
more clear. Most people want ice
cream cones—fewer really hun
ger for draft cards.
Again the question of "politi

ral eff ctiveness' Is raised. But
it should be argued with full
awareness of our preference for
luxurious solutions and our fear
of sacrifice. Our distaste for jail
docs not help us decide what is
a politically rffective act. That
question must be answered by
honest analysis.
In the participatory empire,
nobody is clean. As Prof. Robert
McAfee Brown said
those who ask the university to
withdraw from the empire, who
ask professors to stop doing de
fense-related research, who con
demn the university as racist—
all those who are 'against the
war'—all of us should examine
our relationship to the institu
tions we condemn.
If th rt ties are there, perhaps
we should sever them. If that
means no more draft card or no
more blueberry cheesecake, so
be it.

Last Fall I was walking with
several friends in New York,
discussing the power structure
and seeking an ice cream cone.
One of my companions had spent
a greater part of his life in Lat
in America. He is painfully
aware of the miserable condi
tions throughout that continent,
and for the past few years he
has been researching the Ameri
can corporations which domi
nate most of the Latin econo
mies.
As Art Melville said last week,
as every scholar of the Empire
knows, the United Fruit Com
pany is a classic parasite. In pur
suit of the banana market, it
has come to be a major power
in at least five Central American
countries. It can dictate govern
ments, feed or starve thousands,
and generally decide how mil
lions of people will live.
Thus the Banana Boycott re
cently launched by AVILA
(Avoid Vietnam in Latin Ameri
ca).
While many do not view ab
stention from use of the banana
as a great sacrifice, consider
Baskin-Robbins. There we were,
hell-bent for Blueberry cheese
cake on a sugar cone, when an

other friend Joined us and told
us the terrifying news: "United
Fruit has bought out Baskin-
Robbins and A&W."
The People's Ice Cream
No one had to say it: if you
eat that ice cream cone, you're
contributing to United Fruit's
profits (and power) and adding
another straw to the burden on
the backs of the Latins. Amid
much cursing and defiant cries
that 'ice cream belongs to the
people', we went to a store which
sold coffee and vanilla on plain
cones.
Many of you are probably say
ing 'Oh, Christ!, is there no pure
pleasure left?' Perhaps I am
crazy or have no grasp of politi
cal reality.
Needless to say, the likelihood
of my crippling the American
Empire by refusing to cooperate
with United Fruit's subsidiaries
is not a complete solution. But
since the problem is an impov
erished world, kept poor so that
we might continue to enjoy our
luxuries, we have to look at each
of our luxuries and ask our
selves why we do what we do.
There in both symbolic and
material importance in a 'silly'
and 'politically ineffective' notion
like a Baskin-Robbins boycott.

war'—all of us should examine
our relationship to the institu
tions we condemn.
If th rt ties are there, perhaps
we should sever them. If that
means no more draft card or no
more blueberry cheesecake, so
be it.

Last Fall I was walking with
several friends in New York,
discussing the power structure
and seeking an ice cream cone.
One of my companions had spent
a greater part of his life in Lat
in America. He is painfully
aware of the miserable condi
tions throughout that continent,
and for the past few years he
has been researching the Ameri
can corporations which domi
nate most of the Latin econo
mies.
As Art Melville said last week,
as every scholar of the Empire
knows, the United Fruit Com
pany is a classic parasite. In pur
suit of the banana market, it
has come to be a major power
in at least five Central American
countries. It can dictate govern
ments, feed or starve thousands,
and generally decide how mil
lions of people will live.
Thus the Banana Boycott re
cently launched by AVILA
(Avoid Vietnam in Latin Ameri
ca).
While many do not view ab
stention from use of the banana
as a great sacrifice, consider
Baskin-Robbins. There we were,
hell-bent for Blueberry cheese
cake on a sugar cone, when an

other friend Joined us and told
us the terrifying news: "United
Fruit has bought out Baskin-
Robbins and A&W."
The People's Ice Cream
No one had to say it: if you
eat that ice cream cone, you're
contributing to United Fruit's
profits (and power) and adding
another straw to the burden on
the backs of the Latins. Amid
much cursing and defiant cries
that 'ice cream belongs to the
people', we went to a store which
sold coffee and vanilla on plain
cones.
Many of you are probably say
ing 'Oh, Christ!, is there no pure
pleasure left?' Perhaps I am
crazy or have no grasp of politi
cal reality.
Needless to say, the likelihood
of my crippling the American
Empire by refusing to cooperate
with United Fruit's subsidiaries
is not a complete solution. But
since the problem is an impov
erished world, kept poor so that
we might continue to enjoy our
luxuries, we have to look at each
of our luxuries and ask our
selves why we do what we do.
There in both symbolic and
material importance in a 'silly'
and 'politically ineffective' notion
like a Baskin-Robbins boycott.

Imagine yourself picketing the
store downtown, explaining to
passersby tha* they are support
ing a wage o* 30 or 40 cents a
day for the Guatemalan worker.
Since many don't even know
where Guatemala is, let alone
how the U.S. controls it, there
is much to be taught. Or sup
pose you are in a car full of your
friends and someone says "let's
go to B-R for a guava cone":
there is another chance.
Boycotts Are Educational
Thus, the educational value of
such a boycott is obvious. A
tougher argument comes on the
question of effectiveness.
I would be among the first to
admit that this kind of boycott
on this issue will hardly whip
the corporate giant into line. But
you don't need an ice cream cone
either.
That is to say, we are very
used to incredible abundance. To

give anything up is a sacrifice.
Thus I have to convince you
that yorr abstention is both ab
solutely necessary and 'political
ly effective' before you will con
"ider doing it.
But I suggest we turn the ta
bles. You tell me how you justi
fy eating ice cream cones at all,
let alone in the face of the fact
that by so doing you are in the
smallest (but most important)
way building a world you often
decry.
I can think of another mani
festation of the problem: your
draft card, if you're a guy or
your boy friend's d'-aft card if
you're a girl. The same educa
tional, symbolic element is here.
Things are a little easier here
because the whole question is
more clear. Most people want ice
cream cones—fewer really hun
ger for draft cards.
Again the question of "politi

ral eff ctiveness' Is raised. But
it should be argued with full
awareness of our preference for
luxurious solutions and our fear
of sacrifice. Our distaste for jail
docs not help us decide what is
a politically rffective act. That
question must be answered by
honest analysis.
In the participatory empire,
nobody is clean. As Prof. Robert
McAfee Brown said
those who ask the university to
withdraw from the empire, who
ask professors to stop doing de
fense-related research, who con
demn the university as racist—
all those who are 'against the
war'—all of us should examine
our relationship to the institu
tions we condemn.
