## End Of Incident 
### 
EDITOR'S NOTE: On a Satur
day afternoon last spring work
ers in the Tresidder drug store
closed the store for a short pe
riod to non-Stanford students on
the grounds that there were too
many patrons in the store for
them to keep track of. Among
the patrons were students from
the Day School on a field trip to
Stanford. Store employees al
legedly charged some of the
children with stealing. The Uni
versity's Human Relations Com
mission has ordered an apology
to the Day School and has rep
rimanded the employees in
volved in the closing of the
StO'd.
Euitor, The DAILY:
Concerning the Day School in
cident at Tresidder Union Build
ing, I did not wish to answer
Ex-President Sterling's apology
until school had reconvened and
all persons who are interested
might have the opportunity to
learn how we, at the Day
School, feel.
I am deeply saddened by the
attitude Stanford has taken. The
Human Relations Commission,
in its report, indicated that its
function was to determine (some
three months later) if a series
of incidents did occur on March
9th. There was considerable at
tention paid to the exact chron
ology of events during a thirty
minute or one hour period.
There was a lack of regard
for the emotional effect these
events had on students, and even
teachers, of the Day School. The
Commission listed findings
which indicated that members
of the Day School had been ly
ing. There was no such implied
disbelief of the testimony of
Stanford employees.
Why in the world would the
Day School, a body of responsi
ble students, teachers, and ad
ministrators, seek out and create
stories about blatantly discrimi
natory conduct? On the other
hand, would an employee not
wish to protect his Job?
I had hoped that Stanford
would be able to investigate the
incidents with a respectful atti

tude towards the Day School as
a vital educational organization
and with a respectful attitude
towards the sensitive black chil
dren who were guests of Stan
ford that day. I was badly dis
appointed.
Some facts of March 9th are
simple to comprehend. Things
occurred that injured children.
Adults were made to know that
the Day School group was not
welcome at Tresidder Memorial
Union.
I question whether the func
tion of the Human Relations
Commission should be to set up
a legal case situation and deter
mine which side is correct, pro
tecting persons charged with dis
crimination. I would rather see
the Commission dedicated to
eradicating any kind of racism
from the campus, recognizing
that it does exist at Stanford as
in almost every large institu
tion.
Is not the Commission's sug
gestion that campus visitors
clear with the University before
visiting its facilities a further
isolation of the University from
the surrounding communities?
Until we can be sure that the
Human Relations Commission
can do more than protect those
who are accused of discrimina
tion, and issue luke warm apolo
gies, we are not happy about
having our young children visit
Stanford.
We suggest that the Commis
sion becomes more than just a
legalistics body that investigates
an incident to death, making
gentle recommendations to the
President. I also still hope that
Stanford may feel inclined to
demonstrate its good faith, to
indicate that it is supportive of
the purposes and educational
goals of the Day School.
We might still meet, perhaps
with the President, and discuss
the recommendations that we
bear from the East Palo Alto
Day School community.

Chairman of the Executive
Board
East Palo Alto Day School
