• McCarthy Holds Back
MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. (AP)
—Sen. Eugene McCarthy has
laid down the conditions to be
met before he will personally
endorse Vice President Hubert
H. Humphrey, it was reported
today.
None of the four has been ful

ly met, said Gerald N. Hill, San
Francisco, a lawyer who headed
McCarthy's campaign for the
presidential nomination in Cali
fornia.
Hill told newsmen at the New
Democratic Coalition conference
here that he was empowered
by McCarthy to release the four
conditions. They are that
Humphrey agree to:
1. A halt to the bombing of
North Vietnam.
2. A national election in Viet
nam including "all elements" of
the political structure, presum
ably including the National Lib
eration Front.
3. Reform of the U.S. military
draft system.
4. Reform of the Democratic
Party structure.
Hill, who presides over the
California Democratic Council,
said he proposed in a Sept. 27
letter to McCarthy that the sen
ator not endorse Humphrey un
less the vice president proposed
"major changes in policy."
Hill said Humphrey has gone
"about 20 per cent of the way"
in his latest Vietnam bombing
proposal. The vice president has
agreed to a bombing halt if
there is some reciprocal sign
from North Vietnam.
• Nixon Moves Ahead
NEW YORK (AP) — Richard
M. Nixon moved farther ahead

of both third party candidate
George C. Wallace and Demo
crat Hubert H. Humphrey in a
new presidential preference sur
vey published Sunday by The
New York Times.
It showed Republican Nixon
leading in 34 states with 380
electoral votes, 110 more than
are needed to be elected presi
dent. He was said to be leading
in four more states with 34 elec
toral votes than in a similar sur
vey three weeks ago.
Wallace led in seven states
with 66 electoral votes, a loss of
one state with 11 votes. Hum

states and the District of Colum
bia with 28 electoral votes, a
drop of two states and 14 votes.
The latest Los Angeles Times
state poll, the result of 1,007
interviews conducted Sept. 28
and 29, now shows Nixon lead
ing the Democratic candidate
44 to 33 per cent. A poll con
ducted Sept. 7 and 8 had Nixon
ahead 43 to 34 per cent.
Third-party candidate George
Wallace had 7 per c~nt in the
latest survey while and
Freedom party candidate Eld
ridge Cleaver had 2 per cent.
The survey indicates that
Wallace receives heavier support
in Northern California than in
Southern California, despite past
elections which show southern
California as more conservative
than the northern part of the
state.
• 4 Hump' On Schools
WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice
President Hubert H. Humphrey
proposed Sunday a greatly ex
panded federal role in American
education extending from free
preschool training for all chil
dren to loans for adults who
s?ek new careers through great
er education.

date for president, announced a
nine-point program "to give ev

ery American access to excel
lent education," and pledged to
carry it out if elected.
The vice president's program
calls for boosting federal spend
ing at all levels. There must be,
" a federal contribution to an
American system of education
serving all our people," he said.
Humphrey proposed that "bil
lions of dollars in resources"
from federally owned oil shale
deposits could be successfully
exploited and the revenues ear
marked as an educational trust
fund.
He proposed doubling the fed
eral investment in public ele
mentary and secondary educa
tion in the n°xt four years to
"harrow th° range of pre-stu
dent expenditures among the
states and within the states."
• New Fed Aid Bad
NE WYORK (AP) — Repub
lican Richard M. Nixon said
Sunday night that vast new gov
ernment programs for the cities
and poor would "drain the
112 deral treasury to soothe the
public conscience" and would
fn.il.
"The present administration
has been so transfixed by federal
power that it has ignored the
power of the people," the GOP
pr-sidcntial nominee said in a
radio speech on voluntary citi
zen efforts to improve life in
America.
"The next President must
move consciously and deliberate
ly to inspire those voluntary ef
forts that bring freedom alive,"
Nixon said.
The speech was one of a series
of nationwide radio addresses
Nixon has built into his White
House campaign.
Nixon said government must
play an important role but is
"only part of the mix.
"We need to enlist the ener
gies of that dynamic four-fifths
of our economy represented by

private enterprise, and we also
need to enlist those millions of
Americans who stand ready to
serve and to help, if only they
kenw what to do and how," Nix
on said.
"As government has strained
to do more, our people have felt
constrained to do less."
• Cranston Would Win
LOS ANGELES (AP)—lf the
election for U.S. Senate were
held now, Democratic Alan
Cranston would command an ab
solute majority, the State Poll
said Sunday.
The poll, published in the Los
Angeles Times, said of a cross
section of 1,007 voters, 53 per
cent would vote for Cranston,
32 per cent for Republican can
didate Max Rafferty and 2 per
cent for Peace and Freedom
candidate Paul Jacobs.
Cranston appealed Sunday for
federal school subsidies to bring
up the quality of education for
children in poor districts to the
level of wealthier districts.
Cranston, speaking to support
ers, said there is "Beverly Hills
where the children receive $1,-
000 worth of education, and a
Pomona which spends only
$500."
He said the gap is caused by
the relative ability of each dis
trict to levy property taxes to
support the schools and "school
property taxes have reached
their absolute limits."
"We know children in Watts
and East Los Angeles are not
getting a good education," said
Cranston.

dency.

approached at the convention
