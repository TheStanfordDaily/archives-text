## 
### BARBARA RITZ 
After some disagreement and
a threatened staff walk-out,
members of KZSU's editorial
board last week voted to broad
cast controversial speeches and
programs over KZSU.
According to Tim Logan, sta
tion manager and head of the
editorial board, the dispute
arose over the broadcast of the
Cleaver speech Tuesday night
in Memorial Auditorium.
In addition, he said that a
number of the staff threatened
to resign if political factions or
campus organizations like the
Black Students Union and Stu
dents for a Democratic Society
were permitted to view their
opinios over the air, without
equal time allotted for opposing
viewpoints.
Logan stated that half an hour
per week is now open to any in
dividual or group. In accordance
with the new policy, anyone is
welcome to prepare a format.
The program, regardless of con

tent, will be permitted on the
air.
Logan added that although
KZSU will not attempt to inter
fere with the program's content,
the broadcast must still conform
to the regulations established by
the Federal Communications
Commission.
Donald Price, Assistant Dean
of the School of Humanities and
Sciences, indicated that part of
KZSU's income is furnished by
the Provost's office. In addition,
he said that the station's license
is held by the Board of Trustees.
According to Price, the admin
istration would not attempt to
censor any program on KZSU,
including political broadcasts or
speeches critical of the Univer
sity. However, Price concurred
that any broadcast must meet
the requirements of the Federal
Communications Commission.
Price stated that during last
year's sit-in demonstrations,
KZSU's coverage was an "excel
lent service" to the University.

Already being planned for
broadcast are a study of student
activism and programs evaluat
ing general studies at Stanford.
KZSU has a potential for
reaching 200,000 FM receivers,
commented Logan, but the
broadcast style has never been
"to compete with rock and roll
stations like KYA." KZSU broad
casts at 90.1 on FM and 880 on
an AM hookup through the elec
trical system in University resi
dences.
KZSU presents a specified for
mat of folk or all-blues music
during the afternoon, dinner mu
sic from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m., tapes
of speeches or special events be
tween 7 p.m. and 8, and concert
music in the evening.
Logan said that whenever a
speaker comes on campus, KZSU
will broadcast the speech at least
three times, and he indicated
the rebroadcast of the Cleaver
speech is scheduled tonight at
8 p.m.

an AM hookup through the elec

dences.
KZSU presents a specified for
mat of folk or all-blues music
during the afternoon, dinner mu

Logan said that whenever a
speaker comes on campus, KZSU
will broadcast the speech at least
three times, and he indicated
the rebroadcast of the Cleaver
speech is scheduled tonight at
8 p.m.
After some disagreement and
a threatened staff walk-out,
members of KZSU's editorial
board last week voted to broad
cast controversial speeches and
programs over KZSU.
According to Tim Logan, sta
tion manager and head of the
editorial board, the dispute
arose over the broadcast of the
Cleaver speech Tuesday night
in Memorial Auditorium.
In addition, he said that a
number of the staff threatened
to resign if political factions or
campus organizations like the
Black Students Union and Stu
dents for a Democratic Society
were permitted to view their
opinios over the air, without
equal time allotted for opposing
viewpoints.
Logan stated that half an hour
per week is now open to any in
dividual or group. In accordance
with the new policy, anyone is
welcome to prepare a format.
The program, regardless of con

tent, will be permitted on the
air.
Logan added that although
KZSU will not attempt to inter
fere with the program's content,
the broadcast must still conform
to the regulations established by
the Federal Communications
Commission.
Donald Price, Assistant Dean
of the School of Humanities and
Sciences, indicated that part of
KZSU's income is furnished by
the Provost's office. In addition,
he said that the station's license
is held by the Board of Trustees.
According to Price, the admin
istration would not attempt to
censor any program on KZSU,
including political broadcasts or
speeches critical of the Univer
sity. However, Price concurred
that any broadcast must meet
the requirements of the Federal
Communications Commission.
Price stated that during last
year's sit-in demonstrations,
KZSU's coverage was an "excel
lent service" to the University.

Already being planned for
broadcast are a study of student
activism and programs evaluat
ing general studies at Stanford.
KZSU has a potential for
reaching 200,000 FM receivers,
commented Logan, but the
broadcast style has never been
"to compete with rock and roll
stations like KYA." KZSU broad
