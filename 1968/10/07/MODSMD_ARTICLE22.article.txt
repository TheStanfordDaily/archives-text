# 'Beat SC!'
## Plunkett Bombs Defoliate Air Force 
### GABY CAVALLI 
Stanford's Jim Plunkett found
the Air Force Falcons squarely
in his sights Saturday afternoon
and gunned them down 24-13
with his eighth and ninth touch
down passes of the year.
A crowd estimated at 35,000
was on hand as the Indians de
cisively whipped a tough cadet
eleven for their third straight
win of the youthful '68 cam
paign. It marked the first time
in 12 years that a Stanford foot
ball team has won three straight
games.
The win enabled Stanford to
move Into a select circle of three
teams on the West Coast who are
still undefeated. The other two
teams are Cad and USC.
Next week the powerful Tro
jans will invade Stanford Sta
dium, hoping to overwhelm the
Indians for the eleventh straight
time and hand them their first
loss of the season.
Back of the Game
The 19-year-old Plunkett com
pleted 12 of 28 passes for 192
yards and garnered "Back of the
Game" honors for the third con
secutive week. For the press
box writers who select the
game's top players each week,
it's getting to be an automatic
response to etch in Plunkett's
name as the game's top back.
This time the key man on the
receiving end of Plunkett's
aerials was swift split end Jack
Lasater, who corralled five
passes for 114 yards and one
touchdown.
Tough Secondary
Despite the success of Stan
ford's passing game, both Las
ater and tight end Bob Moore
found the Air Force secondary
tough to handle.
"This was the best secondary
we've faced," Lasater comment
ed after the game. "They hit
awful hard once you caught the
ball."
Moore echoed Lasater's senti
ments: "Their secondary really
hit," the 6-3, 205 pounder assert
ed. "They double-teamed us on
most third-down and passing sit

uations, with a linebacker hitting
us at the line, trying to hold us
up."
Plunkett had trouble hitting
his receivers at first, as he seem
ed to be throwing high. After the
game he said this was probably
because he had been "hurrying
my passes a little."
The sophomore signal-caller
tallied the first Tribe TD himself
on a four yard bootleg with 4:47
left in the opening period. The
big play of the drive was a 37-
yard pass interference call on
Falcon defensive back Cyd Maat
tala.
Controversial Call
Flanker Gene Washington was
running a fly pattern down the
right sideline, with Maattala
covering him, when the defender
shoved him out of bounds. Wash
ington recovered his balance in
time to catch Plunkett's pass,
five yards out of bounds, as the
referee called interference.
Falcon pilot Ben Martin storm
ed at the referee in protest, but
Tribe coach John R a Is to n
thought it was a good call.
"Gene was pushed out of
bounds," Ralston said after the
game. "There's no question that
it was pass interference. I don't
think he would have caught the
ball in bounds, though," Ralston
added with a smile.
Four plays after the interfence
call Plunkett carried it in, and
Steve Horowitz hit the extra
point to make it 7-0.
The Falcons came right back,
however, driving 82 yards in 15
plays to tie the score at 7-apiece.
Curtis Martin dove in for the
score from the one yardline with
13:18 left in the second stanza.
Turning: Point
The turning point in the game
came two minutes later, when
Plunkett dropped back to pass
on first down and hit Lasater on
a 65-yard scoring play.
Lasater got behind Ruddy Hal
lenbeck, hauled in Plunkett's
perfectly-thrown aerial at the 25,
and easily outraced Hallenbeck
to the end zone.
An exhilarated Lasater could

n't say enough about his battery
mate after the game.
"Plunkett's just great," Las
ater beamed. "That bomb he
threw me was just perfect —
you couldn't ask for a better
pass."
The Indians nearly got a two
point conversion on the follow
ing play. Mark Marquess, who
holds the ball on Horowitz's PAT
attempts, fumbled the snap from
center. Marquess, a quarterback
last year, rolled around the left
side and flipped it to Bubba
Brown for the two-pointer, but a
penalty for having an ineligible
receiver downfield nullified his
effort.
Kicker Horowitz then came
through with a 35-yard extra
point, since the violation cost
the Indians 15 yards. The kick
seemed to give Horowitz confi
dence, for minutes later he boot
ed a 20-yard field goal to give
Stanford a 17-7 edge.
The final Tribe tally came on
a three-yard toss from Plunkett
to tight end Moore, capping a
57-yard, 11-play drive.
After the game Ralston indi
cated that the scoring play, like
Plunkett's previous TD pitch,
was called by coach Dick Ver
meil. Vermeil, who is stationed
in the press box, twice noticed
flaws in the cadet secondary, and
it paid off in 12 points.
The spunky Falcons fought
back gamely in the final quarter

to put across their second touch
down.
Quarterback Gary Baxter en
gineering an 80-yard drive
against the Tribe's second-string
defense, completing five passes
during the march.
Four of them, including a 22-
yard strike which put the ball
on Stanford's one, were caught
by tight end Dave MacGhee. The
fifth was hauled in by Charley
Longnecker, who was a thorn
in the Indian's side all afternoon,
catching 11 passes for 112 yards
and winning "Lineman of the
Game" honors.
After the Baxter - MacGhee
atrial act had put the Air Force
on the Stanford one, Martin
scored his second one-yard
touchdown. Denny Leuthauser's
PAT try was wide, so It ended
24-13.
Coach Ralston was not entire
ly pleased with his team's per
formance. He cited the blocking
on the offensive line and the
running game as two areas
where the team still needs work.
"We have to improve our
blocking and our consistency up
front," Ralston noted. "We have
to bring our running game along
to take the pressure off the
passer. Brown and Williams
showed some good things in
heavy traffic, but we wouldn't
.xke the off tackle play. They
gave it to us, but we didn't take
advantage of it."
