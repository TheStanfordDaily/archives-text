# Africa Summer Boosted
## 
### 
Drawing from over 120 cam
puses in the United States and
Canada, Operation Crossroads
Africa (OCA) has successfully
sent groups of students for sum
mer work and living experience
into all part of Africa.
OCA was founded in 1958 pri
marily to give exposure to Af-

Rica for American college stu
dents. It has since expanded this
role; for example, in 1964 a "Re
verse Flow" program was be
gun, by which African students
travel to the U.S.
The majority of Crossroads
spend summers in work-camp
projects. All OCA Projects are
undertaken upon the recommen
dation of African Governments
or, in some instances, of volun
tary organizations which act as
sponsors.
A representative of OCA, Mr.
Jerome Vogel,will be at Stanford
on October 8, and will be avail
able for discussion and questions
at Branner Hall (lunch) and
Serra House (dinner). Addition
al information may be obtained
at the Volunteer Services Cen
ter, in the Old Union.

can no longer be used since the entrances have been closed off, due
to the possibility of collapse. A similar pedestrian overpass col
