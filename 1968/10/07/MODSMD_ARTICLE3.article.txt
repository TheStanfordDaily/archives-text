# Med School To Enroll More Minority Students
## 
### 
The Medical School of Medi
cine Saturday morning an
nounced that it would immedi
ately increase minority student
enrollment. The medical faculty
senate unanimously approved
the spirit of the "demands" sub
mitted to them last by the
Black Student Union (BSU).
The senate urged this pro
gram be strengthened with a tu
torial program designed espec
ially for minority students who
request aid with the studies and
course work.
One of the demands the facul
ty senate agreed to was to ad
mit ten minority students into
sp°cial programs in the School
of Medicine.
Undecided was whether this
would be accomplished by in
creasing the average number of
studsnts admitted each year
(64) or by making room for

within th° present quota.
Dr. Bernard Nelson, Associate
Dean of Student Affairs at the
Medical School, said that these
particulars of the new arrange
ment will be decided at future
meetings of the Faculty Senate.
Nelson also noted that the
school does not want to limit mi
nority admissions to ten. "We
will have ten in special programs
grams plus any who qualify
under the regular applicant
pool."
The special program will be
discontinued eventually the Med
School announced, because they
"hope there will be improvement
further down the pipeline, so in
say five years, minority students
can compete with the rest" of
the applicants.
"The school hopes that with
the general improvement of mi
nority group education, in five

years it (finding qualified mi
nority group applicants) won't
be the problem it is today."
Glaser Pleased
Dr. Robert J. Glaser, acting
University president, announced
that the Medical School admin
istration is very pleased by the
faculty senate action.
The BSU statement on this de
cision noted that this program
will begin September 1969, and
that the ten places reserved for
minority students do not limit
the number of minority pupils
admitted.
"The BSU would like to com
mend the Medical School for
their prompt and constructive
response."
Proposals
There are the proposals adopt
ed by the faculty senate:
• The increased minority en
rollment will begin with the
class entering next September.

• Minority students be defined
as students of educationally de
prived racial or cultural groups
in the United States.
• Ten places in the entering
class be reserved for minority
tudents, and if ten minority stu
dents are not found, these places
would be open to regular appli
cants.
• All students admitted, re
gardless of the method used,
will be required to complete the
same requirements for individu
al course completion and grad
uation.
Quota Undesirable
The senate statement noted
the quota system is undesirable
for routine handling of applica
tions and that the designation of
ten places in the class is done
in the spirit of experiment in
medical admissions for a special
purpose and the ultimate aim is
to eliminate all quotas.

the number of minority pupils
admitted.
"The BSU would like to com
mend the Medical School for
their prompt and constructive
response."
Proposals
There are the proposals adopt
ed by the faculty senate:
• The increased minority en
rollment will begin with the
class entering next September.

• Minority students be defined
as students of educationally de
prived racial or cultural groups
in the United States.
• Ten places in the entering
class be reserved for minority
tudents, and if ten minority stu
dents are not found, these places
would be open to regular appli
cants.
• All students admitted, re
gardless of the method used,
will be required to complete the
same requirements for individu
al course completion and grad
uation.
Quota Undesirable
The senate statement noted
the quota system is undesirable
for routine handling of applica
tions and that the designation of
ten places in the class is done
in the spirit of experiment in
medical admissions for a special
purpose and the ultimate aim is
to eliminate all quotas.
The Medical School of Medi
cine Saturday morning an
nounced that it would immedi
ately increase minority student
enrollment. The medical faculty
senate unanimously approved
the spirit of the "demands" sub
mitted to them last by the
Black Student Union (BSU).
The senate urged this pro
gram be strengthened with a tu
torial program designed espec
ially for minority students who
request aid with the studies and
course work.
One of the demands the facul
ty senate agreed to was to ad
mit ten minority students into
sp°cial programs in the School
of Medicine.
Undecided was whether this
would be accomplished by in
creasing the average number of
studsnts admitted each year
(64) or by making room for

within th° present quota.
Dr. Bernard Nelson, Associate
Dean of Student Affairs at the
Medical School, said that these
particulars of the new arrange
ment will be decided at future
meetings of the Faculty Senate.
Nelson also noted that the
school does not want to limit mi
nority admissions to ten. "We
will have ten in special programs
grams plus any who qualify
under the regular applicant
pool."
The special program will be
discontinued eventually the Med
School announced, because they
"hope there will be improvement
further down the pipeline, so in
say five years, minority students
can compete with the rest" of
the applicants.
"The school hopes that with
the general improvement of mi
nority group education, in five

years it (finding qualified mi
nority group applicants) won't
be the problem it is today."
Glaser Pleased
Dr. Robert J. Glaser, acting
University president, announced
that the Medical School admin
istration is very pleased by the
faculty senate action.
The BSU statement on this de
cision noted that this program
will begin September 1969, and
that the ten places reserved for
minority students do not limit
the number of minority pupils
admitted.
"The BSU would like to com
mend the Medical School for
their prompt and constructive
response."
