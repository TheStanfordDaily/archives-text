# For Demonstrations
## Glaser Sets Interim Policy 
### 
Acting President Dr. Robert J. Glaser announced Saturday new
interim policy guidelines regarding free speech, peaceable assembly,
and freedom of movement on campus.
Under this policy, prevention or obstruction of effective carrying
out of University functions and activity as well as interferring with
legitimate movement of any person around the campus violates
University regulations.
When a disturbance occurs, students, faculty, and staff are obli
gated to leave a University building and must identify themselves
upon request to a member of the University communitv acting in
his official role and identifying himself as such, the guideline notes.
The new policy seems partly directed at faculty members who
participate in campus demonstrations. In the Encina Hall-CIA con
frontation last Fall, Maoist English professor Bruce Franklin was
not charged with any violation of University rules as the students
involved were. The new policy seems to provide for action against
activist faculty.
This policy was formulated by members of the Associated Stu
dents ASSU), Students Judicial Body, the Senate of the Academic
Council, and the Stanford chapter of the Association of University
Professors.
Glaser said, in a statement to the Stanford community:
"Because the rights of free speech and peaceful assembly are
fundamental to the democratic process, Stanford firmly supports

the rights of all members of the University community to express
their views or to protect against actions and opinions with which
they disagree,
"All members of the University also share a concurrent obliga
tion to maintain on the campus an atmosphere conducive to schol
arly pursuits; to preserve the dignity and seriousness of University
ceremonies and public exercises; and to respect the rights of all
individuals."
"It is a violation of university policy for a member of the faculty,
staff, or student body to (1) prevent or disrupt the effective carry
ing out of a University function or approved activity, such as lec
tures, meetings, interviews, ceremonies, the conduct of University
business in a University office, and public events; (2) obstruct the
legitimate movement of any person about the campus or in any
University building or facility.
Members of the faculty, staff, and student body have an obliga
tion to leave a university building or facility when asked to do so
in the furtherance of the above regulations by a member of the
University community acting in an official role, and identifying him
self as such; members of the faculty, staff, or student body also
have an obligation to identify themselves, when requested to do so
by such a member of the University community who has reason
able grounds to believe that the person(s) has violated section (1)
or (2) of this policy and who has so informed the person(s)."
