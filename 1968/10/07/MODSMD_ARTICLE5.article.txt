• NY Board Suspended
NEW YORK (AP) — The City
Board of Education, facing the
threat of yet another teachers'
strike of the 1.1-million pupil
public school system, voted Sun
day night to suspend the govern
ing board of an experimental
school district central to the dis
pute.
The board announced a 30-day
suspension of the governing
board of the Octan Hill-Browns
ville experimental school dis
trict. By an 8 to 2 vote, it direct
ed Supt. of Schools Bernard E.
Donovan to assume direct con
trol of the district's eight
schools.
The board announced its deci
sion after a three-hour meeting
that followed conferences with
both the leader of the teachers'
union and the administrator of
the Ocean Hill district, where
the issues have been drawn re
garding the fate of 85 teachers.
The union has contended that
job security and right of due

process have been denied to the
teachers, whose transfer out of
the district is sought by the lo
cal governing board. The local
board has contended the teach
ers were trying to sabotage the
experiment in local school con
trol, designed to upgrade the
quality of slum neighborhood
education.
The union has a new strike
authorization vote of its chapter
chairmen scheduled Monday.
Another walkout would be the
third by the union against the
nation's largest school system
since Sept. 9.
The previous strikes ended
when the Board of Education
agreed to return the disputed
teachers to the classrooms, only
to have the return rebuffed by
demonstrators the first time
and the teachers denied duty as
signments the second time.
• Students Blame Cops
MEXICO CITY (AP)— Student
leaders blamed secret police

men who wore white gloves as a
means of identification for start
ing Wednesday's gun battle
that killed at 35 persons.
The government said anti-na
tionalist and Communist ele
ments were behind the trouble.
The students also charged
that the official death toll of 35
was off base, contending that
the fighting took the lives of 150
students and civilians and 40
soldiers.
"We ourselves dragged away
many bodies of our comrades to
give them a decent burial," said
one leader. He said the secret
police fired indiscriminately
into the crowd of 6,000 students
and spectators at a rally in the
plaza.
The student leader said the
secret police were the same
group of nightriders who ma
chine-gunned several schools in
disturbances earlier this year
and beat up several students.
Students believe they are in
league with a faction of the rul

ing Institutional Revolutionary
Party (PRI).
• Biafran Hopes Surge
UMUAHIA, Biafra (AP) —
Binfra's head of the state says
there are hopeful signs the tides
of world opinion as well as the
ti 'es of battle are beginning to
turn in favor of his secessionist
nation in the war with Nigeria.
Lt. Col. C. Ojukwu
told a half dozen U.S., Canadian
and Dutch reporters Saturday
that situation "is difficult but not
hope'ess" in his steadily shrink
ing nation where thousands of
children and now older people
am dying weekly from a protein
deficiency disease called kwasior
kor.
Just back from the front at
OgiWwi, which th? Biafrans are
battling to retake from federal
troops, the Ibi leader said there
had a steady improvement
in both arms and relief supplies.
"I am still scouring the earth
to get whatever arms I can lay
my hands on," he said, ad«ling
that at the moment Biafra's
greatest military nesd is better
antiaircraft defense and weip
ons to cope with the British-built
armored cars that have enabled
the Nigerian troops to control
most of the major roads.
Asked if it might not be more
humanitarian to stop the war
for whatever setfement he
could get in order to save his
starving people. Ojukwu replied
with visible emotion: "The
crime of genocide has not on'y
been threatened but fulfilled. The
only reason any of us ar? alive
today is because we have our
rifles. Otherwise the massacre
would be complete. It would be
suicidal for us to lay down our
arms at this stage."

• Fly To Olympics
MEXICO CITY (AP) — The
powerful 77-man United States
track and field team flew into
this Olympic capital Sunday and
insisted that the threat of a
black boycott is dead.
The question was the one

Mexican ana overseas newsmen
were most concerned about when
the second big planeload of ath
letes and personnel — number
ing 157—put down at the Mexi
co City airport in a light rain.
"We have b°en assumed there
will be no trouble whatever,"
said Payton Jordan, head coach
from Stanford University. "The
boys are here to win medals and
that is all they are concerned
with."
"The black boycott issue is
dead" added Stan Wright, Negro
assistant coach. "I have been
very close to the black athletes.
You can bet there will be no
demonstrations."
John Carlos, d Negro
"printer formerly of San Jose
State and one of the militants
in th? black protest movement,
corroborate:! his coaches' state
ments, with some mild reserva
tions.
"We have no intention of dr
upting the Games," Carlos sail.
'Tut tha' doe° not mean we will
not do something to accentuate
th? inju"ti' , es that have been
don the black man in Ameri
ca."
• Gibson Wins Again
DETROIT (AP) — Bob Gib
son fired away through the rain,
chill and mist to a record sev
enth straight World Series vic
tory Sunday in a 10-1 rout of
Detroit that was marred by the
umpires' warning to both man
agers against stalling and speed
up tactics. The Cards took an
overwhelming 3-1 lead in games.
Managers Mayo Smith of the
Tigers and Red Schoendienst of
the Cards were called to home
plate by plate umpire Bill Kin
namon at the end of the fifth

ming when things began to get
a little ridiculous on both sides.
The game was held up 37 min
utes at the start and delayed
again for 74 minutes in the top
of the third as rain swept across
Tiger Stadium and its 53,634
fans.
For soma time it appeared the
game never would be started
and then, after the Cards had
opened up a 4-0 lead in the
third, that it never would be re
sumed.
The home fans chanted "Rain,
rain, rain" like a football crowd
rooting for a touchdown.
Detroit was doing its best to
consume time, hoping for more
rain and St. Louis was doing its
best to speed up action with
some odd baseball rupnning.
"We called both managers
out," said Kinnamon. "We didn't
want one team stalling. We
didn't want one team to be hur
rying. One was told not to delay
and one was told not to speed
up."
