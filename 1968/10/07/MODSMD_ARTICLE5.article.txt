• NY Board Suspended
NEW YORK (AP) — The City
Board of Education, facing the
threat of yet another teachers'
strike of the 1.1-million pupil
public school system, voted Sun
day night to suspend the govern
ing board of an experimental
school district central to the dis
pute.
The board announced a 30-day
suspension of the governing
board of the Octan Hill-Browns
ville experimental school dis
trict. By an 8 to 2 vote, it direct
ed Supt. of Schools Bernard E.
Donovan to assume direct con
trol of the district's eight
schools.
The board announced its deci
sion after a three-hour meeting
that followed conferences with
both the leader of the teachers'
union and the administrator of
the Ocean Hill district, where
the issues have been drawn re
garding the fate of 85 teachers.
The union has contended that
job security and right of due

process have been denied to the
teachers, whose transfer out of
the district is sought by the lo
cal governing board. The local
board has contended the teach
ers were trying to sabotage the
experiment in local school con
trol, designed to upgrade the
quality of slum neighborhood
education.
The union has a new strike
authorization vote of its chapter
chairmen scheduled Monday.
Another walkout would be the
third by the union against the
nation's largest school system
since Sept. 9.
The previous strikes ended
when the Board of Education
agreed to return the disputed
teachers to the classrooms, only
to have the return rebuffed by
demonstrators the first time
and the teachers denied duty as
signments the second time.
• Students Blame Cops
MEXICO CITY (AP)— Student
leaders blamed secret police

men who wore white gloves as a
means of identification for start
ing Wednesday's gun battle
that killed at 35 persons.
The government said anti-na
tionalist and Communist ele
ments were behind the trouble.
The students also charged
that the official death toll of 35
was off base, contending that
the fighting took the lives of 150
students and civilians and 40
soldiers.
"We ourselves dragged away
many bodies of our comrades to
give them a decent burial," said
one leader. He said the secret
police fired indiscriminately
into the crowd of 6,000 students
and spectators at a rally in the
plaza.
The student leader said the
secret police were the same
group of nightriders who ma
chine-gunned several schools in
disturbances earlier this year
and beat up several students.
Students believe they are in
league with a faction of the rul

ing Institutional Revolutionary
Party (PRI).
