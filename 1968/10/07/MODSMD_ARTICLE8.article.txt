# Friends' To Tutor EPA Students
## 
### TOM GRAY 
More than 300 Stanford stu
dents have joined at least four
programs to tutor junior high
and high school students of var
ied economic, cultural and racial
backgrounds.
The tutoring will take two
widely differing approaches, one
in which a personal relationship
between tutor and pupil is
stressed, and another in which
the prospect of whites tutoring
blacks has raised fears of a loss
of black culture.
Representatives of the Black
Student Union, heading a pro
gram at Ravenswood High
School, have warned the virtual
ly all-white body of tutors that
they must limit as much as pos
sible imposing their "psycholog
ical perspective" on black stu
dents.

At the primarily black high
school in East Palo Alto, several
hundred tutors are being sought
for the "Go Go to College" pro
gram aimed at getting black
students into four-year colleges.
Founded by the Faculty of the
Stanford Medical School, the
program is sponsored by the
Stanford BSU and representa
tives of the faculty and staff. Go
Go to College will also operate
at Menlo-Atherton High School,
where two to three hundred tu
tors have been requested. The
program is, this year, a joint
effort of the forces of the old
Go Go program and the Stanford
Area Tutorial program, both of
which worked at Ravenswood
last year under separate spon
sors.
The new overtone of the Rav

enswood project was apparent
at the first meeting for potential
tutors when a panel of black
speakers told the white audi
ence that the tutor's job was "to
help the stu'ent with his needs,
not to transmit inspiration." The
tutors were also told to seek
only as much "personal rapport"
as is necessary to "introduce the
student to basic skills needed in
college."
Tutors Warned
One of the speakers, Frank
Satterwhite, warned the white
tutors of Ihe racial pitfalls that
await them in instructing black
students. He warned against
holding two especially destruc
tive attitudes: one, a sense of
guilt that makes some whites
work toward improving their

image, becoming too "nice" and
very often intimidated; and,
also, a feeling of cultural super
iority on the part of whites that
makes them try to mold their
black tutees into the white value
system.
The tutors were also warned
that personal contact with pu
pils would be kept to a mini
mum, mainly to the tutors'
culture from being forced on the
blacks. Another speaker, Joyce
King, told the white audience
that they should avoid in any
way possible inspiring a "brain
drain" of black talent from the
black community.
In spite of these warnings, the
Sept. 30 meeting seemed to dis
courage few if any of the poten
tial tutors. They will go through

a more intensive briefing at an
"attitude" training session in the
near future, followed by confer
ences with Ravenswood teach
ers.
Other Programs
Different from the Ravens
wood project both in goals and
operation are the combined ef
forts of the Stanford Young Re
publicans' "Help" tutorial pro
gram and the Stanford Frienis
program at Crittendon Junior
High in Mountain View. They
act as tutors and friends to the
students in the sixth through
eighth grades, many of them
economically and culturally dis
advantaged.
The Stanford Friends, as its
name suggests, aims at develop
ing friendships between otan

ford tutors and selected students
with problems of an economic,
cultural or personal nature. Di
r cte-i by Mr. and Mrs. Robert
Freelen, former faculty resident
at Serra house, the project em
phasizes the development of
personal rapport between the
tutor and pupil. In the past, the
program, besides individual con
tact, has organized group activi
ties, such as trips and, last year,
an overnight outing for about
forty youngsters.
Outside Class
Also on a personal level, but
with a greater emphasis on
school activities, the YR's Help
program works with the Critton
don administration to assist pu
pils in studying, but also works
in after-sehool athletics and on
projects, such as a school news

paper. Here also a personal rap
port between tutor and pupil is
stressed.
Each program expects about
25 to 30 Stanford students par
ticipating beginning Oct. 14 as
tutors. The project is open to
any student who wishes to join
it, regardless of his particular
skills or field of interest. The
Stanford Friends and YR Help
program can be contacted
through The Volunteer Services
Center. Membership in the
Young Republicans is not neces
sary for joining Project Help.
As in the Ravenswood program,
students will be expected to
tutor for at least two hours a
week, and, in addition, are urged
to spend extra time with the in
dividual youngsters.

drain" of black talent from the
black community.
In spite of these warnings, the
Sept. 30 meeting seemed to dis
courage few if any of the poten
tial tutors. They will go through

a more intensive briefing at an
"attitude" training session in the
near future, followed by confer
ences with Ravenswood teach
ers.
Other Programs
Different from the Ravens
wood project both in goals and
operation are the combined ef
forts of the Stanford Young Re
publicans' "Help" tutorial pro
gram and the Stanford Frienis
program at Crittendon Junior
High in Mountain View. They
act as tutors and friends to the
students in the sixth through
eighth grades, many of them
economically and culturally dis
advantaged.
The Stanford Friends, as its
name suggests, aims at develop
ing friendships between otan

ford tutors and selected students
with problems of an economic,
cultural or personal nature. Di
r cte-i by Mr. and Mrs. Robert
Freelen, former faculty resident
at Serra house, the project em
phasizes the development of
personal rapport between the
tutor and pupil. In the past, the
program, besides individual con
tact, has organized group activi
ties, such as trips and, last year,
an overnight outing for about
forty youngsters.
Outside Class
Also on a personal level, but
with a greater emphasis on
school activities, the YR's Help
program works with the Critton
don administration to assist pu
pils in studying, but also works
in after-sehool athletics and on
projects, such as a school news

paper. Here also a personal rap
port between tutor and pupil is
stressed.
Each program expects about
25 to 30 Stanford students par
ticipating beginning Oct. 14 as
tutors. The project is open to
any student who wishes to join
it, regardless of his particular
skills or field of interest. The
Stanford Friends and YR Help
program can be contacted
through The Volunteer Services
Center. Membership in the
Young Republicans is not neces
sary for joining Project Help.
As in the Ravenswood program,
students will be expected to
tutor for at least two hours a
week, and, in addition, are urged
to spend extra time with the in
dividual youngsters.
More than 300 Stanford stu
dents have joined at least four
programs to tutor junior high
and high school students of var
ied economic, cultural and racial
backgrounds.
The tutoring will take two
widely differing approaches, one
in which a personal relationship
between tutor and pupil is
stressed, and another in which
the prospect of whites tutoring
blacks has raised fears of a loss
of black culture.
Representatives of the Black
Student Union, heading a pro
gram at Ravenswood High
School, have warned the virtual
ly all-white body of tutors that
they must limit as much as pos
sible imposing their "psycholog
ical perspective" on black stu
dents.

At the primarily black high
school in East Palo Alto, several
hundred tutors are being sought
for the "Go Go to College" pro
gram aimed at getting black
students into four-year colleges.
Founded by the Faculty of the
Stanford Medical School, the
program is sponsored by the
Stanford BSU and representa
tives of the faculty and staff. Go
Go to College will also operate
at Menlo-Atherton High School,
where two to three hundred tu
tors have been requested. The
program is, this year, a joint
effort of the forces of the old
Go Go program and the Stanford
Area Tutorial program, both of
which worked at Ravenswood
last year under separate spon
sors.
The new overtone of the Rav

enswood project was apparent
at the first meeting for potential
tutors when a panel of black
speakers told the white audi
ence that the tutor's job was "to
help the stu'ent with his needs,
not to transmit inspiration." The
tutors were also told to seek
only as much "personal rapport"
as is necessary to "introduce the
student to basic skills needed in
college."
Tutors Warned
One of the speakers, Frank
Satterwhite, warned the white
tutors of Ihe racial pitfalls that
await them in instructing black
students. He warned against
holding two especially destruc
tive attitudes: one, a sense of
guilt that makes some whites
work toward improving their

image, becoming too "nice" and
very often intimidated; and,
also, a feeling of cultural super
iority on the part of whites that
makes them try to mold their
black tutees into the white value
system.
The tutors were also warned
that personal contact with pu
pils would be kept to a mini
mum, mainly to the tutors'
culture from being forced on the
blacks. Another speaker, Joyce
King, told the white audience
that they should avoid in any
way possible inspiring a "brain
drain" of black talent from the
black community.

stressed, and another in which
the prospect of whites tutoring
blacks has raised fears of a loss
of black culture.
Representatives of the Black
Student Union, heading a pro
gram at Ravenswood High
School, have warned the virtual
ly all-white body of tutors that
they must limit as much as pos
sible imposing their "psycholog
ical perspective" on black stu
dents.

At the primarily black high
school in East Palo Alto, several
hundred tutors are being sought
for the "Go Go to College" pro
gram aimed at getting black
students into four-year colleges.
Founded by the Faculty of the
Stanford Medical School, the
program is sponsored by the
Stanford BSU and representa
tives of the faculty and staff. Go
Go to College will also operate
at Menlo-Atherton High School,
where two to three hundred tu
tors have been requested. The
program is, this year, a joint
effort of the forces of the old
Go Go program and the Stanford
Area Tutorial program, both of
which worked at Ravenswood
last year under separate spon
sors.
The new overtone of the Rav

enswood project was apparent
at the first meeting for potential
tutors when a panel of black
speakers told the white audi
ence that the tutor's job was "to
help the stu'ent with his needs,
not to transmit inspiration." The
tutors were also told to seek
only as much "personal rapport"
as is necessary to "introduce the
student to basic skills needed in
college."
Tutors Warned
One of the speakers, Frank
Satterwhite, warned the white
tutors of Ihe racial pitfalls that
await them in instructing black
students. He warned against
holding two especially destruc
tive attitudes: one, a sense of
guilt that makes some whites
work toward improving their

image, becoming too "nice" and
very often intimidated; and,
also, a feeling of cultural super
iority on the part of whites that
makes them try to mold their
black tutees into the white value
system.
The tutors were also warned
that personal contact with pu
pils would be kept to a mini
mum, mainly to the tutors'
culture from being forced on the
blacks. Another speaker, Joyce
King, told the white audience
that they should avoid in any
way possible inspiring a "brain
drain" of black talent from the
black community.
In spite of these warnings, the
Sept. 30 meeting seemed to dis
courage few if any of the poten
tial tutors. They will go through

a more intensive briefing at an
"attitude" training session in the
near future, followed by confer
ences with Ravenswood teach
ers.
Other Programs
Different from the Ravens
wood project both in goals and
operation are the combined ef
forts of the Stanford Young Re
publicans' "Help" tutorial pro
gram and the Stanford Frienis
program at Crittendon Junior
High in Mountain View. They
act as tutors and friends to the
students in the sixth through
eighth grades, many of them
economically and culturally dis
advantaged.
The Stanford Friends, as its
name suggests, aims at develop
ing friendships between otan

ford tutors and selected students
with problems of an economic,
cultural or personal nature. Di
r cte-i by Mr. and Mrs. Robert
Freelen, former faculty resident
at Serra house, the project em
phasizes the development of
personal rapport between the
tutor and pupil. In the past, the
program, besides individual con
tact, has organized group activi
ties, such as trips and, last year,
an overnight outing for about
forty youngsters.
Outside Class
Also on a personal level, but
with a greater emphasis on
school activities, the YR's Help
program works with the Critton
don administration to assist pu
pils in studying, but also works
in after-sehool athletics and on
projects, such as a school news

paper. Here also a personal rap
port between tutor and pupil is
stressed.
Each program expects about
25 to 30 Stanford students par
ticipating beginning Oct. 14 as
tutors. The project is open to
any student who wishes to join
it, regardless of his particular
skills or field of interest. The
Stanford Friends and YR Help
program can be contacted
through The Volunteer Services
Center. Membership in the
Young Republicans is not neces
sary for joining Project Help.
As in the Ravenswood program,
students will be expected to
tutor for at least two hours a
week, and, in addition, are urged
to spend extra time with the in
dividual youngsters.
More than 300 Stanford stu
dents have joined at least four
programs to tutor junior high
and high school students of var
ied economic, cultural and racial
backgrounds.
The tutoring will take two
widely differing approaches, one
in which a personal relationship
between tutor and pupil is
stressed, and another in which
the prospect of whites tutoring
blacks has raised fears of a loss
of black culture.
