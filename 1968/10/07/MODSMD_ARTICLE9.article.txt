# Labor Pains
## The
						Price Of Grapes 
### ALAN RADER 
In the fertile San Joaquin Val
ley of California, the average
farm-worker works ten, twelve,
■ fourteen hours a day, six days
a week, and earns less than
■ $2,000 a year.
; He can not support his fam
■ ily. His children drop out of
grade school to work in the
! fields. Their lack of education
; traps them and creates a low
. priced labor force.

An oppressive social structure
! serves to guarantee the exis
» tence of that cheap labor and—
1 given the Mexican-American de
* scent of most California farm
* workers —also feeds the racial
•. prejudices of the area.
In some towns in the Valley
« there is no house with running
z water, hot or cold. The farm
~ workers who live there carry
large cans "across the tracks"
S for their water. "Across the
| tracks" can be up to 20 miles.
Poor Iw< Mlical Attention
2 Medical care is largely non
* existent. Where it is available it
~ is inadequate and structured to
I discourage its use: Mexican-
Americans often spend a day or
two in a waiting room hoping
for treatments.
This June a young woman,
pregnant and in labor, entered
the Kern County General Hos
pital. Eight hours passed before
v she received any medical atten
] tion. Both she and her baby died.
£ Agricultural interests control
4 all public agencies in the San
! Joaquin Valley. State health and
safety laws are ignored, includ
ing those requiring toilet and
i| handwashing facilities in the
| field for farmworkers. The ig
-3 norant who question are told, as
J one woman was this summer,
* "You don't need toilets. Use the
••vineyards!"
Those who demand are fired.
For the women who are "too
modest," kidney infections be
come an occupational disease.
Send Children To The Fields
Through tracking systems and
suspensions, the schools move
as many Chicanos as they can
from classrooms to fields. When
growers in one Fresno County
town found they had a labor
shortage recently, the school
board closed the schools for
three weeks and instructed the
students to work in the fields.
Parents who would not bring
their children to work were
fired.
Several of the large growers
maintain their own labor camps.
The farm-workers live on the
grower's land, renting tin hovels
and buying overpriced food. Gar

bage Is let uncollected for four
or five weeks. The day before
payday the grower extends cred
it for cheap wine at $2.00 a pint
and supplies prostitutes. The
farm-worker is soon in debt,
bound to the land.
To fight their institutionalized
poverty the farm-workers
formed a union, the United
Farm Workers, (UFW, AFL
CIO). It is led by Cesar Chavez.
The United Farm Workers
have won every farm-worker
election (three elections and six
card-ballots) and have success
ful contracts with nine produ
cers of wine grapes. They have
been on strike against California
table grape growers since Sep
tember, 1965, but these growers
have refused to recognize the
rights of their employees.
Refuse Elections
Farm-workers, exempted from
the National Labor Relations
Act (which allows employees to
petition for an election and com
pels their employer to negotiate
with a union that wins a majori
ty), can only ask growers for an
election. The growers have con
sistently refused.
The union can still strike. At
the first vineyard struck this
season approximately 90 per
cent of the workers walked out
of the fields. The growers re
sponded by importing illegal la
bor to break the strike. The fed
eral government will do nothing.
The NFW set up picket lines
to convince strikebreakers to
come out of the fields. Growers
responded with violence. They
drove trucks into picket line,
brandished guns, and beat many
pickets.
Last July 6 a student on the
picket line was struck by a
truck, dragged into the field, and
beaten for a half hour by several
men. Police protection in grape
country is comparable to police
protection in Oakland. The vio
lence was successful: the union
has halted most picketing.
Boycott Is Last Chance
The only means left to the
farm workers in their attempt
to bring growers to the bargain
ing table is a consumer boycott
—an appeal to consumers to re
frain from buying grapes. For
several months farm-workers
have been visiting major cities
and, with support from local
sympathizers, attempting to or
ganize such a support. Grape

sales in the East have fallen 25
per cent and the growers are
now trying to reroute grapes to
California markets.
Stanford University continues
to buy grapes. Members of this
community must decide either
to practice some measure of so
cial consciousness and responsi
bility or to cast their lot with
other interests, including the
rich alumni in the San Joaquin
Valley.
It is the lives of the farm
workers of California that are
at stake, not the lives of Stan
ford students. The issue is not

a choice between roast beef and
chicken. The issue is the right
of farm-workers to organize and
end their oppression.
The struggle in the San Joa
quin Valley is not merely a la
bor-management struggle. It is
a moral contest. There is no neu
tral ground. Stanford Univer
sity, in buying grapes, has de
clared its position.
For those who feel that Stan
ford must not comply with the
oppression of California farm
workers, there will be an open
meeting at noon tomorrow in
White Plaza.
