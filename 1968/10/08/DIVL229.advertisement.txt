Shuttle buses will leave from Serra Street (in front of the quad) as fast
as they are loaded starting from 2:15 and continuing until 4:15. The tours
will start with a short explanatory motion picture in the SLAC Auditorium
(which will run continuously until 5:00). Following each showing of the
movie, visitors may board buses for tours guided by SLAC faculty, stu
dents, and staff. All SLAC facilities will be open for casual roaming.
Continuous shuttle bus service will return visitors to the quad, the last
bus departing at 5:45.
