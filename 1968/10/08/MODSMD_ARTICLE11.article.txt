Find a grape. Put it in your mouth. Bite. There
is a brief resistance and then your mouth is
flooded with cool, sweet juice.
In a good world your enjoyment of that fruit

would not have moral implications. Unfortunate
ly this is not a good world. The fluid which re
freshes you has been squeezed from the body of

an impoverished California farm worker.
Yes, the Daily waxes melodramatic again. But
there is blood on those grapes. The people who
picked them work for an average of $1.40 to $1.50
an hour, and most of them do not work all year.
One dollar and forty cents. A cipher. Translate
it. It means an income of about $3,000 each year
for the families who pick grapes.
It means a house with no running water, no
bathroom. It means kids in the fields when they
should be in school. It means when you get sick
you think twice about going to see a doctor.
But more than that, $1.40 means no power
for those who get that much for an hour's work.
No purchasing power, no political power, leav
ing only moral power and physical power.
Because they have no political weight in this
country, farm woikers have been exempted from
the National Labor Relations Act. They are not
guaranteed the right to bargain collectively. In
non-agricultural industries, California's unskilled
laborers were paid an average of $3.05 an hour

in 1965, more than twice the wage of the unor
ganized farm workers.
The treatment of farm workers in California
both blatantly unjust and relatively easy to iso
late. The efforts of Cesar Chavez to organize have
been met with the importation of scab labor, use
of quasi-legal injunctions and violence. But Cha
vez has formed the nucleus of an organization
that can improve the lives of workers in the fields
of the San Joaquin Valley.
It is doubtful that most Stanford students will
ever taste the bitterness that is daily fare for
those who are working in Delano to change the

lives of their people. There are a few, like law stu
dent A 1 Rader, who have committed themselves
to the struggle, who have lived with Cesar Cha
vez and his followers, and who can feel part of
what they feel.
For the rest of us it is a matter of imagination.
Can we put ourselves, for a few moments, in the
place of a person who works with his hands, who
has little hope of bettering his condition or pro
viding a brighter future for his children, who can
see the abundance enjoyed by most Americans
but who cannot share it?
If we can do that, the United Farm Workers of
California will win their fight. If the growers can
not sell their table grapes, they will sign con
tracts with the union. If people do not eat grapes,
the growers will not be able to sell them.
The University food service will stop purchas
ing grapes if enough students sign petitions to
that effect. If you can find such a petition, we
urge you to put your name on it.
Don't eat any more grapes. Don't let the Uni
versity buy them.
