# Letters To The Editor
## Cleaver Vs. Good Old Days 
### 
EDITOR'S NOTE: A grey-haired
lady strode into our office yes
terday and handed us this letter.
"Will you print it?" she asked
after allowing us time to note
that, like most letters, it was
typed on paper. "Maybe we will
and mayl»e we won't," we replied,
making a small contribution to
our generation's reputation for
insolence.
Editor, the DAILY:
What was Eldridge Cleaver's
message to the Stanford com
munity? His vocabulary was lim
ited to words meant to shock.
I knew men who could swear
— seamen, longshoremen, cat
skinners, boomers of all kinds.
They worked hard, drank hard,
fought hard and played hard.
Their language matched their
lives. The language was not
meant to shock — just to express
their meaning in pictures as they
saw them.
Yet if a man dared to use pro
fane words in front of a woman,

wife or whore, he would quickly
find himself knocked down with
a swift uppercut punch to the
jaw.
These men were workers, inde
pendent, yet proud of their work.
They would boast of loading
more tonnage than any other
longshoreman, or would shinny
up a 50 foot iron beam scornful
of any who could not match their
skill.
Some I knew were IWW's
(wobblys) or communists. They
organized and fought for wages,
hours, working conditions — yes,
for "Self Determination for Ne
groes in the Black Belt" and
"Freedom for the 9 Scottsboro
Boys." They were tarred and
feathered in the South, viciously
clubbed and beaten by company
police sadists who enjoyed their
work.
They went to jail, not for rape,
but for a cause they considered
just. They had a vision of a bet
ter world where production was
for use and not for profit. They

spoke not so much of destroying
but of building — of building a
socialist society.
They were coarse, rough, tough
men with gut language that was
picturesque and expressive.
These were the masters from
whom Cleaver, "the worker"
could learn.
These men would have listened
to Cleaver with amusement first,
then with boredom a"nd finally
with amazement at the reaction
of the young middleclass audi
ence — even as I did.
For myself I am stil trying to
unravel Cleaver's message. Was
there one? I heard some bor
rowed slogans of the past such
as "Power to the Workers." I
heard him call on Mao Tse Tung
to drop the hydrogen bomb on
his head so he could take some of
the pigs with him.
Was it for this that the un
critical Stanford students gave
him a standing ovation or was it
just that the repetition of pro
fane words symbolized and epi

tomized their rebellion against
authority.
Wo need no gods. We must re
tain a critical perspective.
From the birth pangs of the
developing struggle for identity
and manhood will be born lead
ers who will formulate theory
and act to build a better society.
