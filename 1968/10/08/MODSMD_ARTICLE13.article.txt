ARTICLE 111, SECTION 3, OF THE
BY-LAWS
Setcion 3. Hare System of Election.
A. Validation of Ballots for Representa
tives.

1. Exclude any invalid ballots. Set aside
as invalid any ballot from which the first
choice of the voter cannot be clearly as
certained.
2. Regard every other ballot as valid
whether it is marked according to instruc
tions or not.
a. If a ballot has a single cross mark
and no number 1, consider the cross
mark as an expression of first choice.
b. If a ballot contains both figures and
crosses, accept the order of the choices
shown by the figures as the voter's in
tention in so far as the order is clearly
indicated.
c. If the consecutive numerical order
of the numbers on a ballot is broken
by the omission of one or more num
bers, accept the smallest number as in
dicating the first choice, the next small
est the second choice, etc., without re
gard to the number or numbers omitted.
d. If the voter's choices have been
indicated not by numbers but by writing
the first choice at the top of the ballot,
the second choice just below the first,
etc., in such a way that the voter's in
tent is unmistakable, regard the ballot
as valid.
e. Regard no ballot as invalid because
the names of the candidates thereon for
whom the voter did not mark a choice
have been stricken out.
H. Establishment of Quota for Repre
sentatives.
I. Count the valid ballots cast in the
election in question.
2. Determine the quota sufficient to elect
a Representative by dividing the number
of valid ballots by one more than the
number of Representatives to be elected
and adding one to the result, disregarding
any fraction.
C. First Count.
1. Sort the valid ballots, giving each tc
the candidate marked on it as first or high
est choice.
2. Credit each candidate initially with
one vote for every ballot thus sorted to
him. In this and in subsequent counts
make certain that no ballot is credited to
more than one candidate at the same
time.
3. Declare elected any candidate who
has received the quota.
4. Tally the number of ballots credited
to each candidate. (This completes the
first count.)
D. Transfer of Surplus Ballots.
1. If on the first count any candidate
was credited with more ballots then the
quota, declare the excess (over the quota)
to be his surplus.
2. Transfer surplus ballots to other can
didates (if two or more candidates are in
volved. the largest surplus first, then the
next largest, etc.) according to the rules
which follow.
3. For each candidate credited with a
surplus, sort all ba:lnts into two groups as
follows
a. Transferable Ballots — those from
which the next choice of the voter for
some continuing candidate can be clearly
ascertained. A continuing candiate, as
used here and subsequently, is a candi
date as yet neither elected nor defeated.
b. Non-Transferable Ballots — those
from which the next choice of the voter
for some continuing candidate cannot be
clearly ascertained.
4. For each candidate who has a surplus
c unt th? transferable ballot.
5. If the number of the transferable bal
lots is equal to or less than the surplus,
transfer each transferable ballot to the
continuing candidate marked on it as next
choice.
6. If the number of transferable ballots
is greater than the surplus, select and
transfer ballots up to the number of the
surplus proportionately according to the
following directions:
a. Sort the transferable ballots of a
candidate into groups in accordance with
the next choice marked on each for a
continuing candidate.
b. Multiply the number of ballots in
each group of transferable ball ts thus
s rt -d by the fraction of which the
numerator is the number of surplus
ballots and the denominator is the total
number of transferable ballots in the
several groups.
c. Of the fractions that may appear
in the resulting products, consider as
having the value of one as many of the
largest fractions as may be necessary to
make the total number of ballots trans
ferred equal to the surplus. If in the
raising of fractions to whole numbers
there are ties which must be brok n
in order to achieve the number of the
surplus, break the ties by lot. Disregard
all other fractions.
d. In the case of each group, the
product thus obtained is the number of
ballots to be transferred from the
group, each to the continuing candidate

marked on it as next choice.
c. In each case transfer ballots in
the number indicated by the product.
Choose ballots for transfer in a descend
in# order in accordance with the num
ber of choices expressed. In this order
break buy lies by lot.
7. Whenever in the transfer of a sur
plus the votes of any candidate become
equal to the quota, immediately declare
him elected and make no further transfer
to him.
8. If any ballot properly reckoned as
transferable at the beginning of a transfer
of surplus ballots becbmes non-transferable
in the process, treat it thereafter as a non
transferable ballot.
E. The Second Count
1. After the transfer of all surpluses
tabulate the ballots to the credit of each
candidate, as the second count.
F. The Third Count.
1. After the second count decleare de
feated all candidates with no ballots to
their credit.
2. Next decleare defeated the continuing
candidate lowest on the poll. If two or
more candidates are tied for the position
lowest on the poll, break the tie by refer
ence to the candidate most ipften preferred
on the ballots of all continuing candidates.
If the tie cannot be broken by this method,
break it by lot.
J. Then transfer all ballots of the can
didate or candidates just defeated each to
the candidate marked on it as next choice
among continuing candidates, except as fol
lows :
a. Whenever in this or any subsequent
transfer a ballot shows no next choice
for a candidate not yet elected or de
feated, set it aside as exhausted.
b. If a ballot to be transferred is
marked with the same choice for two or
more candidates, disregard all choices
for candidates already elected or defeat
ed and regard the next choice among
the other candidates as the voter's next
choice. If, however, that next choice is
marked for two or more candidates not
yet elected or defeated, treat the ballot
as if that choice and all subsequent
choices had not been marked at all and
set it aside as exhausted.
c. When in the transfer of ballots
from a defeated candidate the votes of
any candidate become equal to the quota,
immediately declare him elected and
make no further transfer to him.
4. Tabulate the ballots to the credit of
each candidate, as the third count.
G. Subsequent Counts.
1. After the defeated candidate's ballots
have all been transferred, declare defeated
the candidate then lowest on the poll and
transfer all his ballots, as prescribed in
Section F.
2. Continue to defeat lowest candidates
in order and to transfer their ballots until
the election is finished as prescribed below.
3. As soon as the necessary number of
candidates have been elected, declare the
election at an end; but any transfer of
ballots that is in progress may be com
pleted for the record.
4. If the number of candidates not yet
elected or defeated is reduced to the num
ber still to be elected and all the ballots
of the candidates who have been defeated
are transferred without completing the
election, bring the election to an end by
declaring all the remaining candidates
elected. •
H. Election of Alternates.
I. Restore all ballots to their original
status.
2. Declare ineligible for election as an
Alternate any candidate who has been
elected as a Representative.
3. Exclude any ballots which are in
valid for the designation of Alternates,
following the procedures set forth in Sec
tion A. but taking into account the in
eligibility of candidates already elected as
Representatives.
4. Determine the quota for the design
tion of Alternates, following the proce
dures set forth in Section 6, but taking
into account that:
a. The number of valid ballots may
not be the same as for the election of
Representatives; and
b. The number of Alternates to be
designated is one more than the number
of Representatives elected.
5. Sort ballots as in the first count for
the election of Representatives. (Section
C, Paragraphs 1 and 2.)
6. Conduct the first count as indicated
in Section C.
7. Transfer any surplus ballots follow
ing the procedures set forth in Section D.
8. Continue the second, third, and sub
sequent counts as indicated in Section E,
