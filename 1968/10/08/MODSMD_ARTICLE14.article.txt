# Students Are Niggers

Students are niggers. When you get that straight,
our schools hegin to make sense.

.It's more important,
though, to understand why they're niggers. If we
follow that question seriously enough, it will lead
us past the zone of academic bullshit, where dedi
cated teachers pass their knowledge on to a new
generation, and into the nitty-gritty of human needs
and hang-ups. And from there we can go on to con
sider whether it might ever be possible for students
to come up from slavery.
First let's see what's happening now. Let's look
at the role students play in what we like to call
education.
At Cal State L.A., where I teach, the students have
separate and unequal dining facilities. If I take them
into the faculty dining room, my colleagues get
uncomfortable, as though there were a bad smell.
If I eat in the student cafeteria, I become known as
the educational equivalent of a niggerlover. In at
least one building there are even rest rooms which
students may not use.
Students at Cal State are politically disenfranchised.
They are in an academic Lowndes County. Most of
them can vote in national elections-their average age
is about 26-but they have no voice in the decisions
which affect their academic lives. The students are,
it is true, allowed to have a toy government of.their
own. It is a government run for the most part by Uncle
Toms and concerned principally with trivia. The
faculty and administrators decide what courses will
be offered; the students get to choose their own Home
coming Queen. Occasionally, when student leaders
get uppity and rebellious, they're either ignored, put
off with trivial concessions, or maneuvered expertly
out of position.
A student at Cal State is expected to know his place.
He calls a faculty member "Sir" or "Doctor" or
"Professor'-and he smiles and shuffles some as he
stands outside the professor's office waiting for per
mission to enter. The faculty tell him what courses to
take (in my department, English, even elfectives have
to be approved by a faculty member); they tell him
what to read, what to write, and, frequently, where to
set the margins on his typewriter. They tell him what's
true and what isn't. Some teachers insist that they
encourage dissent but they're almost always jiving
and every student knows it. Tell the man what he
wants to hear or he'll fail your ass out of the course.
When a teacher says "jump," students jump. I know
Of one professor who refused to take up class time
for exams and required students to show up for tests
it 6:30 in the morning. And they did, by God! Another,
at exam time, provides answer cards to be filled
out-each one enclosed in a paper bag with a hole cut
in the top to see through. Students stick their writing
hands in the bags while taking the test. The teacher

of students as niggers by

isn't a provo; I wish he were. He does it to prevent
cheating. Another colleague once caught a student
reading during one of his lectures and threw her book
against the wall. Still another lectures his students
into a stupor and then screams at them in a rage
when they fall asleep.
Just last week, during the first meeting of a class,
one girl got up to leave after about ten minutes had
gone by. The teacher rushed over, grabbed her by the
arm, saying ' This class is NOT dismissed!" and led
her back to her seat. On the same day another teacher
began by informing his class that he does not like
beards, mustaches, long hair on boys, or capri pants
on girls, and will not tolerate any of that in his class.
The class, incidentally, consisted mostly of high
school teachers.
Even more discouraging than this Auschwitz ap
proach to education is the fact that the students take
it. They haven't gone through twelve years of public
school for nothing. They've learned one thing and
perhaps only one thing during those twelve years.
They've forgotten their algebra. They're hopelessly
vague about chemistry and physics. They've grown to
fear and resent literature. They write like they've
been lobotomized. But, Jesus, can they follow orders!
Freshmen come up to me with an essay and ask if
I want it folded and whether their name should be in
the upper right hand corner. And I want to cry and kiss
them and caress their poor tortured heads.
Students don't ask that orders make sense. They
give up expecting things to make sense long before
they leave elementary school. Things are true be
cause the teacher says they're true. At a very early
age we all learn to accept "two truths," as did certain
medieval churchmen. Outside of class, things are
true to your tongue, your fingers your stomach, your
heart. Inside class, things are true by reason of
authority. And that's just fine because you don't
care anyway. Miss Wiedemeyer tells you a noun
is a person, place or thing. So let it be. You don't
give a rat's ass; she doesn't give a rat's ass.
The important thing is to please her. Back in
kindergarten, you found out that teachers only love
children who stand in nice straight lines. And that's
where it's been at ever since. Nothing changes except
to get worse. School becomes more and more obviously
a prison. Last year I spoke to a student assembly
at Manual Arts High School and then couldn't get out
of the god-damn school. I mean there was NO WAY
OUT. Locked doors. High fences. One of the inmates
was trying to make it over a fence when he saw me
coming and froze in panic. For a moment I expected
sirens, a rattle of bullets, and him clawing the fence.
Then there's the infamous ' code of dress." In
some high schools, if your skirt looks too short,
you have to go home to change. Boys in high school
can't be too sloppy and they can't even be too sharp.
You'd think the school board would be delighted
to see all the spades trooping to school in pointy
shoes, suits, ties and stingy brims. Uh-uh. They're

too visible.
What school amounts to, then, for white and black
kids alike, is a 12-year course in how to be slaves.
What else could explain what I see in a freshman
class? They've got that slave mentality: obliging and
ingratiating on the surface but hostile and resistent
underneath.
As do black slaves, students vary in their aware
ness of what's going on. Some recognize their own
put-on for what it is and even let their rebellion
break through to the surface now and then. Others
including most of the "good students"-have been more
deeply brainwashed. They swallow the bullshit with
greedy mouths. They honest-to-God believe in grades,
in busy work, in General Education requirements.
They're pathetically eager to be pushed around.
They're like those old grey-headed house niggers
you can still find in the South who don't see what all
the fuss is about because Mr. Charlie "treats us
real good."
College entrance requirements tend to favor the
Toms and screen out the rebels. Not entirely, of
course. Some students at Cal State L.A. are expert
con artists who know perfectly well what's happening
They want the degree or the 2-S and spend their
years on the old plantation alternately laughing and
cursing as they play the game. If their egos are
strong enough, they cheat a lot. And, of course, even
the Toms are angry down deep somewhere. But it
comes out in passive rather than active aggression.
They're unexplainably thick-witted and subject to fre
quent spells of laziness. They misread simple ques
tions. They spend their nights mechanically outlining
history chapters while meticulously failing to com
prehend a word of what's in front of them.
The saddest cases among both black slaves and
student slaves are the ones who have so thoroughly
introjected their masters' values that their anger is
turned inward. At Cal State these are the kids for
whom every low grade is torture, who stammer and
shake when they speak to a professor, who go through
an emotional crisis every time they're called upon
during class. You can recognize them easily at finals
time. Their faces are festooned with fresh pimples;
their bowels boil audibly across the room. If there
really is a Last Judgement, then the parents and
teachers who created these wrecks are going to
burn in hell.
So students are niggers. It's time to find out why,
and to do this, we nave to take a long look at Mr.
Charlie. The teachers I know best are college pro
fessors. Outside the classroom and taken as a group,
their most striking characteristic is timidity.
Just look at their working conditions. At a time when
even migrant workers have begun to fight and win, col
lege professors are still afraid to make more than
a token effort to improve their pitiful economic
status. In California state colleges the faculties are
screwed regularly and vigorously by the Governor
and Legislature and yet they still won't offer any
solid resistance. They lie flat on their stomachs
with their pants down, mumbling catch phrases like
"professional dignity'' and "meaningful dialogue."
Professors were no different when I was an under
graduate at UCLA during the McCarthy era; it was like
a cattle stampede as they rushed to cop out. And, in
more recent years, I found that my being arrested
in sit-ins brought from my colleagues not so much
approval or condemnation as open-mouthed astonish
ment. "You could lose your job!"
Now, of course, there's the Vietnamese war. It gets

some opposition from a few teachers. Some support it.
But a vast number of professors, who know perfectly
well what's happening, are copping out again. And
in the high schools, you can forget it. Stillness reigns.
I'm not sure why teachers are so chickenshit.
It could be that academic training itself forces a split
between thought and action. It might also be that
the tenured security of a teaching job attracts timid
persons and, furthermore, that teaching, like police
work, pulls in persons who are unsure of themselves
and need weapons and the other external trappings
of authority.
The classroom offers an artificial and protected
environment in which they can exercise their will to
power. Your neighbors may drive a better car; gas
station attendants may intimidate you; your wife may
dominate you; the State Legislature may shit on you;
but in the classroom, by God, students do what you
say-or else. The grade is a hell of a weapon. It may
not rest on you hip, potent and rigid like a cop's gun,
but in the long run it's more powerful. At your per
sonal whimâ€”any time you choose-you can keep 35
students up for nights and have the pleasure of seeing
them walk into the classroom pasty-faced and red
eyed carrying a sheaf of typewritten pages , with
title page, ML A footnotes and margins set at 15 and
91.
The general timidity which causes teachers to make
niggers of their students usually includes a more spe
cific fear-fear of the students themselves. After all,
students are different, just like black people. You
stand exposed in front of them, knowing that their in
terests, their values and their language are different
from yours. To make matters worse, you may
suspect that you yourself are not the most engaging
of persons. What then can protect you from their
ridicule and scorn? Respect for Authority. That's
what. It's the policeman's gun again. The white bwana's
pith helmet. So you flaunt that authority. You wither
whisperers with a murderous glance. You crush
objectors with erudition and heavy irony.
And, worst cf all, you make your own attainments
seem not accessible but awesomely remote. You con
ceal your massive ignorance-and parade a slender
learning.
The teacher's fear is mixed with an understandable
need to be admired and to feel superior, a need which
also makes him cling to his "white supremacy."
Ideally, a should minimize the distance be
tween himself and his students. He should encourage
them not to need him-eventually or even immediately.
But this is rarely the case. Teachers make themselves
high priests of arcane mysteries. They become mas
ters of mumbojumbo. Even a more or less con
scientious teacher may be torn between the desire
to give and the desire to hold them in bondage to
him. I can find no other explanation that accounts
for the way my own subject, literature, is generally
taught. Literature, which ought to be a source of joy,
solace and enlightenment, often becomes in the class
room nothing more than a source of anxiety-at least
an arena for expertise, a ledger book for the ego.
Literature teachers, often afraid to join a real union,
nonetheless may practice the worst kind of trade
unionism in the classroom; they do to literature what
Beckmesser does to song in Wagner's "Meister
singer." The avowed purpose of English departments
is to teach literature; too often their real function
is to kill it.
Finally, there's the darkest reason of all for the
master-slave approach to education. The less train
ed and tne less socialized a person is, the more fie
constitutes a sexual threat and the more he will be
subjugated by institutions, such as penitentiaries and
schools. Many of us are aware by now of the sexual
neurosis which makes white man so fearful of
integrated schools and neighborhoods, and which
make the castration of Negroes a deeply entrenched
Southern folkway. We should recognize a similar pat
tern in education. There .is a kind of castration "iat
goes on in schools. It begins, before school years,
with parents' first encroachments on their children's
free unashamed sexuality and continues right up to
the day when they hand you your doctoral diploma
with a bleeding, shriveled pair of testicles stapled
to the parchment. It's not that sexuality has no place
in the classroom. You'll find it there but only in cer
tain perverted and vitiated forms.
How does sex show up in school? First of all, there's
the sadomasochistic relationship between teachers
and students. ,
