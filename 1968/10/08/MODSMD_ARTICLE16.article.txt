• Berkeley Heats Up
BERKELEY (AP) — Student
and faculty leaders at the Uni
versity of California said Mon
day they would press for credit
for a course featuring Black
Panther leader Eldridge Cleaver
but indicated they would avoid
any confrontation this week over
the credit question.
Chancellor Roger Heyns as
signed a university classroom
for the course Sunday night,
clearly stating the room had
been authorized "only for a stu
dent-sponsored, noncredit pro
gram."
Cleaver is scheduled to deli
ver the first of 10 lectures in
the course. Social Analysis 139-
X, at 11 a.m. Tuesday in 155
Dwinelle Hall. The second lec
ture is scheduled for the follow
-ing Tuesday.
At a news conference Monday,
student body president Charles
Palmer said he believes the uni
versity Board of Regents will
soften their position. The Re
gents voted recently to limit a
guest lecturer in a course where
credit is given to one appear
ance.
The faculty instructors in the
course said the issue of credit
can only be resolved by the Aca
demic Senate, which voted last
Thursday to direct its commit
tee on courses "to take all steps
to encourage course and credit
status" for the lectures.
• Political Roundup
Hubert H. Humphrey, cam
paigning through Pennsylvania
Monday, taunted his Republican
opponent for the presidency and
again challenged him to debate,
while Richard M. Nixon asserted
that administration war policy
would be "an albatross" around
Humphrey's neck.
Nixon told 18,000 persons at a
rally in Buffalo, N.Y., that If
peace is not achieved by election
time the nation should turn
away from the current national
leadership. He said he could of
er "a fresh hand and a fresh
eye."
The Republican nominee
sounded a note of confidence in
light of polls and the size of his
crowds, but said, "we're not tak
ing anything for granted."

Earlier, Humphrey had ac
cused Nixon of taking "the
American people for granted."
Humphrey sent a telegram to
Nixon regarding a series of de
bates and told a Wilkes-Barre
crowd: "I know why Mr. Nixon
doesn't want to debate me; be
cause he can't defend a record
he doesn't have."
Third-party candidate George
C. Wallace said in Washington
that as president he would move
up to 30,000 troops into the na
tion's capital, if necessary, to
stamp out crime.
The American Independent
candidate called for a military
victory in Vietnam if the peace
talks fail, but said, "I would not
consider nuclear war at all in
Vietnam.
He said his anti-Negro image
was the creation of Washington
newsmen who write it, then go
home to white suburbs. He
promised there would be Ne
groes in appointive positions in
his administration.
The Democratic vice presiden
tial candidate, Sen. Edmund S.
Muskie, ran into the roughest
heckling of his campaign Mon
day as demonstrators disrupted
his speech at Syracuse Univer
sity.
A woman with an electronic
"bullhorn" and others drowned
out Muskie until a group of stu
dents, identified by a school
spokesman as members of the
Syracuse football team, moved
in among the hecklers.
A school spokesman said the
hecklers were not students. Re
publican vice presidential candi
date Gov. Spiro T. Agnew, cam
paigning in North Carolina,
hammered away at federal
spending and fired several barbs
at Wallace.
Agnew said the federal deficit
is an "economic hangover that
can't be cured in the Humphrey
family pharmacy," a reference
to the vice president's onetime
business in Minnesota.
• Bomb Halt Poll
WASHINGTON (AP) — Al
though their terms vary widely,
at least half of the 100 U.S. sen
ators say they favor some plan
to end all American bombing
raids on North Vietnamese ter
ritory.
Included in this group are 3
Republicans and 24 Democrats
who say they want the bombing
ended unconditionally, at least
as an experiment to test the re
action and sincerity of the Hanoi

regime. Eleven of these senators
are seeking re-election this year.
Their position is opposed
strongly by 18 senators — 10 Re
publicans and 8 Democrats —
who say they are against what
one of their number terms "lift
ing the umbrella" of air support
over U.S. combat troops in the
field.
Twenty-three of the 85 sena
tors reached in an Associated
Press Survey said they favor a
halt—but only if North Vietnam
responded with reciprocal ac
tion that appeared to offer
chances either for de-escalation
of the war or compromise at the
bargaining table in Paris. This
group includes 16 Democrats
and 7 Republicans.
• Vietnam-Bound
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Supreme Court Monday turned
down a challenge to President
Johnson's mobilization of reser
vists and freed the Army to
send 256 soldiers to Vietnam.
Eight justices joined in the
action and gave not one word of
explanation for their ruling.
The ninth, Justice William O.
Douglas, dissented and said the
Army had not lived up to its
promises to the reservists.
The Army, acting swiftly aft
er learning of the court's ruling,
announced immediately that five
of the protesting units would be
sent to Vietnam according to
plan.
The reservists lodged two ma
jor claims: 1. That in being
called up for 24 months as units
they were not given credit for
active duty time some already
had served as individuals and
2, That they could be called up
only in time of war or of na
tional emergency declared by
Congress.
Douglas, who had temporari
ly blocked the Army from send
ing the men to Vietnam, said
the issue was not the power of

Congress "but how legislation
shall be read, in order, if possi
ble, to avoid creating a "credibili
ty gap' between the people and
their government."
The appeals presented the
first challenges to the 1966 law
which authorized Johnson to
mobilize the ready reserve for
Vietnam action.
Until the law was enacted re
serve units could be called to
active duty only in time of war
or of national emergncy.
Douglas had ordered the Ar
my, in some instances at the last
minute, not to send the men to
Vietnam until the court could
consider their pleas. The jus
tices did so at a private confer
ence following this opening day.
• France On Peace
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y.
(AP) — France declared Monday
that only an end to the Soviet
military occupation of Czecho
slovakia could remove bars to
East - West cooperation in the
search for world peace.
In a policy speech to the 125-
nation United Nations General
Assembly Michel Debre, the
French foreign minister, de
scribed the Soviet-led invasion
of Czechoslovakia as "another
dark day in postwar history.
"The Europeans, in their vast
majority — whatever the nation
to which they belong, in the
East and in the West — were
shocked to their very depths
when they learned of the mili
tary intervention of Czechoslo
vakia by the Soviet Union and
the fo; r other power-, belong
ing to th 3 Warsaw Pact," he
said.
He asserted that, without an
East-West detente, peace is im

possible in Europe and the
world, and added: "There is no
detente than can accommodate
itself to occupation troops sta
tioned by force."
• Cong "Defeated"?
SAIGON (AP) — President
Nguyen Van Thieu said Monday
the enemy has lost the Vietnam
war on the battlefield and has
shifted emphasis to the political
arena to force a Communist-led
coalition government on South
Vietnam.
"They know they cannot win
militarily, so they move to the
political phase," he told news
men at a Senate reception.
He dwelt on the same theme
in a speech earlier Monday to
the National Assembly, noting
that in the past five months
"the Communists have been un
able to obtain a single military
success."
"The scheme of the Hanoi re
gime is to have us accept that
step which will lead to the crea
tion of a coalition government,
paving the way for Communist
takeover by political means,"
said Thieu.
Reiterating his conditions for
peace, Thieu said Hanoi "has
to acknowledge its aggression
against South Vietnam and must
agree to end that aggression."
• Tigers Rally
DETROIT (AP) — A 1 Kaline,
who sweated out 16 lean years
to get into a Detroit World Se
ries, kept the Tigers alive Mon
day with a two-run single in the
seventh inning for a 5-3 victory
that sent the Series back to St.
Louis for a sixth game Wednes
day.
Mickey Lolich, the only Tiger
winner in the first four games,
came through again despite a
heavy bombing in the first in
ning when Orlando Cepeda's
two-run homer capped a three
run spurt.
It was Mickey who opened the
winning rally in the sevont u
with a single when Detro...
bounced back as they had done
all season. Then Lolich closed
out a ninth inning threat by fan
ning Roger and throwing
out Lou Brock, who had collect
ed three hits earlier.

Bright sunshine and a chilling
breeze provided a contrast to
Sunday's rainy, sloppy game.
There were many exciting plays
and dramatic moments in the
best played game of the Series
to date.
The standing room crowd
heard an unusual rendition of
the National Anthem by Jose
Feliciano, a blind Puerto Rican
singer who gave a mixed version
of soul and folk music touch
that puzzled many observers.
