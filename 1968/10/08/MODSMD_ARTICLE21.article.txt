# Boycott
## 
### 
Grapes will be the topic of dis
cussion at an open meeting today
in White Plaza. Sponsored by the
Stanford Grape Boycott Commit
tee, the rally will begin at 11:00
with picketing in front of Tresid
der Union, which still buys Cali
fornia table grapes.
To explain the significance of
the boycott, Ed Dutton and An
dres Chavez will address the
rally. Dutton is a veteran organ
izer from the San Joaquin Valley
who participated in founding the
Black Congress in Watts and
worked state-wide in social ac
tion training and community de
velopment. Chavez, previously a
farmworker, is now a full-time
organizer for the United Farm
Workers (UFW).
The controversy surrounding
the boycott concerns the rights
of farm workers to organize and
make demands on their employ
ers. The average wage for male
pickers is $1.50 to $1.65 an hour
and is $1.65 for women. The
workers have annual earnings of
less than $1500 a year, and their
living conditions are poor.
To correct this situation the
farm-workers, who are exempted
from the National Labor Rela
tions Act, formed a union, the
UFW. The union struck Cali
fornia table grape growers, but
the growers have imported out
side labor to break the strike. As
a last resort, the UFW organized
the boycott which is now gaining
strength in the East.
