Overseas Campuses, written by
members of former overseas
campus groups. This article was
written by a junior who recently
returned from Austria.)

Austria is those left-overs of
the Austro-Hungarian Empire
that nobody wanted. After the
First World War, the French
Premier, Clemenceau somewhat
cruelly described the Austrian
Republic as "that which re
mains."
Since then Austria has suffer
ed economically from its trun
cated existence, separated from
former markets and resources
in eastern Europe. The 1931 col
lapse of the Creditanstalt, which

Is still Vienna's largest bank,
figured prominently in the
worldwide Great Depression.
As a political entity, Austria
is a neutral state wedged be
tween two NATO members,
West Germany and Italy. At
present, neighboring Czechoslo
vakia is filled with Warsaw Pact
troops, and Austria is filled with
Czechoslovak refugees.
The nearness of Soviet troops
is constantly brought home to
the Viennese by the Soviet war
memorial located on a part of
Schwarzenberg Place that was
once renamed Stalin Place by
Soviet occupation authorities-
Conservative Rule
The country is governed by
the People's Party, which stands
for conservative Catholic social
values. The parliamentary op
position is headed by the Soc
ialist Party, which has purged
Marx and Austro-Marxism. The
socialist youth movements say
the Socialist Party developed a
bourgeois, establishmentarian
"coalition mentality" from its
years of post-World War II col
laboration with the People's
Party. Socialist Party rallies us
ually end with the youth singing
the banned "Internationale"
while their embarrassed elders
stand by with tightly pursed
lips.
The older Viennese burghers
are glad to "have their peace."
They fear a return to the civil
strife of the 1930's during which
Dollfuss's clerical fascist gov
ernment cannonaded the Karl-
Marx-Hof housing complex.
There is a past that Austrians
would rather forget. The Aus
trians find that poet W. H.
Auden, who lives outside Vienna,
is hitting a little too close to
home when he says that the
thing that he likes about Aus
tria is that every time you round
a corner there is another old
Nazi.
The city of Vienna itself is
the "waterhead" of the old Em
pire and maintains imperial pre
tensions. Vienna is a monument
to the Hapsburg dynasty. The
"good old days" are everywhere
present in its parks, boulevards,
baroque palaces, and gothic
churches.
Stanford's overseas campus in
the Palais Archduke Karl is sit
uated in the heart of Vienna's
red-light district. The building,
once the property of the famous
Esterhazy family, now belongs
to Caritas, the international
Catholic relief organization.
Vienna Campus
Stanford students are housed
on the third and fourth floors
of the building. During the au

tumn, winter, and spring, the
fifth floor houses Austrian and
foreign students attending tech
nical school and university. The
two Stanford groups which have
been in Vienna had almost no
contact with these students. Dur
ing the summer, the fifth floor
is a hotel listed in Europe on $5
a Day.
The second floor has libraries,
an auditorium, and three recita
tion rooms, the use of which
Stanford shares with an organi
zation called the International
Cultural Center. One staircase
and the rooms along one side of
the second floor are left from
the old palais. In the rest of the
building, the decor is cell-block
modern.
Stanford's overseas campus is
only a few minutes away from
Kaertnerstrasse, the axis of Vi
enna's central First District, and
is near the State Opera house.
The location makes access to
cultural events in theatres and
museums easy. Music in Vienna
is inexpensive and renowned.
Close at hand are numerous
parks filled with ducks, senior
citizens, and statues of musici
ans, and avenues are lined with
pile after pile of government
buildings housing the bureaucra
cy which has been growing un
ceasingly since the time of Em
press Maria Theresa.
For reaching outlying areas of
the city, there is a street car
network which goes everywhere.
Driving an automobile in the
city is said to cause insanity.
Travel Center
The city of Vienna is east of
Prague and provides a good
jumping off place to eastern
Europe. It is also convenient to
northern Italy, southern Ger
many, and the ski resorts of
Switzerland and the Austrian
Tyrol.
The administration of Stan
ford in Austria is part of the
overseas campus system which
one student has called "the last
truly feudal fief left at Stan
ford." The Austrian campus ad
ministration is stricter than
some other campuses on class
attendance and returning on
time after weekends.
Students should bear in mind
that grading has traditionally
been tougher at the two Ger
man-language campuses. Partly
because of its recent relocation
and partly because of the con
servative reticence of the Vien
nese, who are over-supplied with
Americans, no Austrian families
are associated with the Vienna
campus.


STANFORD-IN-OSTERREICH — Palais Archduke Karl is the home
of Stanford's overseas campus in Austria. The massive five-story
complex Is located in the red-light district of Vienna. Applications
for next year's fall-winter session in Austria are being accepted.

The city of Vienna is east of

Europe. It is also convenient to
northern Italy, southern Ger

Switzerland and the Austrian
Tyrol.
The administration of Stan

some other campuses on class
attendance and returning on
time after weekends.
Students should bear in mind
that grading has traditionally
been tougher at the two Ger

STANFORD-IN-OSTERREICH — Palais Archduke Karl is the home
of Stanford's overseas campus in Austria. The massive five-story
complex Is located in the red-light district of Vienna. Applications
for next year's fall-winter session in Austria are being accepted.

Austria is those left-overs of
the Austro-Hungarian Empire
that nobody wanted. After the
First World War, the French
Premier, Clemenceau somewhat
cruelly described the Austrian
Republic as "that which re
mains."
Since then Austria has suffer
ed economically from its trun
cated existence, separated from
former markets and resources
in eastern Europe. The 1931 col
lapse of the Creditanstalt, which

Is still Vienna's largest bank,
figured prominently in the
worldwide Great Depression.
As a political entity, Austria
is a neutral state wedged be
tween two NATO members,
West Germany and Italy. At
present, neighboring Czechoslo
vakia is filled with Warsaw Pact
troops, and Austria is filled with
Czechoslovak refugees.
The nearness of Soviet troops
is constantly brought home to
the Viennese by the Soviet war
memorial located on a part of
Schwarzenberg Place that was
once renamed Stalin Place by
Soviet occupation authorities-
Conservative Rule
The country is governed by
the People's Party, which stands
for conservative Catholic social
values. The parliamentary op
position is headed by the Soc
ialist Party, which has purged
Marx and Austro-Marxism. The
socialist youth movements say
the Socialist Party developed a
bourgeois, establishmentarian
"coalition mentality" from its
years of post-World War II col
laboration with the People's
Party. Socialist Party rallies us
ually end with the youth singing
the banned "Internationale"
while their embarrassed elders
stand by with tightly pursed
lips.
The older Viennese burghers
are glad to "have their peace."
They fear a return to the civil
strife of the 1930's during which
Dollfuss's clerical fascist gov
ernment cannonaded the Karl-
Marx-Hof housing complex.
There is a past that Austrians
would rather forget. The Aus
trians find that poet W. H.
Auden, who lives outside Vienna,
is hitting a little too close to
home when he says that the
thing that he likes about Aus
tria is that every time you round
a corner there is another old
Nazi.
The city of Vienna itself is
the "waterhead" of the old Em
pire and maintains imperial pre
tensions. Vienna is a monument
to the Hapsburg dynasty. The
"good old days" are everywhere
present in its parks, boulevards,
baroque palaces, and gothic
churches.
Stanford's overseas campus in
the Palais Archduke Karl is sit
uated in the heart of Vienna's
red-light district. The building,
once the property of the famous
Esterhazy family, now belongs
to Caritas, the international
Catholic relief organization.
Vienna Campus
Stanford students are housed
on the third and fourth floors
of the building. During the au

tumn, winter, and spring, the
fifth floor houses Austrian and
foreign students attending tech
nical school and university. The
two Stanford groups which have
been in Vienna had almost no
contact with these students. Dur
ing the summer, the fifth floor
is a hotel listed in Europe on $5
a Day.
The second floor has libraries,
an auditorium, and three recita
tion rooms, the use of which
Stanford shares with an organi
zation called the International
Cultural Center. One staircase
and the rooms along one side of
the second floor are left from
the old palais. In the rest of the
building, the decor is cell-block
modern.
Stanford's overseas campus is
only a few minutes away from
Kaertnerstrasse, the axis of Vi
enna's central First District, and

present in its parks, boulevards,
baroque palaces, and gothic
churches.
Stanford's overseas campus in
the Palais Archduke Karl is sit
uated in the heart of Vienna's
red-light district. The building,
once the property of the famous
Esterhazy family, now belongs
to Caritas, the international
Catholic relief organization.
Vienna Campus
Stanford students are housed
on the third and fourth floors
of the building. During the au

tumn, winter, and spring, the
fifth floor houses Austrian and
foreign students attending tech
nical school and university. The
two Stanford groups which have
been in Vienna had almost no
contact with these students. Dur
ing the summer, the fifth floor
is a hotel listed in Europe on $5
a Day.
The second floor has libraries,
an auditorium, and three recita
tion rooms, the use of which
Stanford shares with an organi
zation called the International
Cultural Center. One staircase
and the rooms along one side of
the second floor are left from
the old palais. In the rest of the
building, the decor is cell-block
modern.
Stanford's overseas campus is
only a few minutes away from
Kaertnerstrasse, the axis of Vi
enna's central First District, and
is near the State Opera house.
The location makes access to
cultural events in theatres and
museums easy. Music in Vienna
is inexpensive and renowned.
Close at hand are numerous
parks filled with ducks, senior
citizens, and statues of musici
ans, and avenues are lined with
pile after pile of government
buildings housing the bureaucra
cy which has been growing un
ceasingly since the time of Em
press Maria Theresa.
For reaching outlying areas of
the city, there is a street car
network which goes everywhere.
Driving an automobile in the
city is said to cause insanity.
Travel Center
The city of Vienna is east of
Prague and provides a good
jumping off place to eastern
Europe. It is also convenient to
northern Italy, southern Ger
many, and the ski resorts of
Switzerland and the Austrian
Tyrol.
The administration of Stan
ford in Austria is part of the
overseas campus system which
one student has called "the last
truly feudal fief left at Stan
ford." The Austrian campus ad
ministration is stricter than
some other campuses on class
attendance and returning on
time after weekends.
Students should bear in mind
that grading has traditionally
been tougher at the two Ger
man-language campuses. Partly
because of its recent relocation
and partly because of the con
servative reticence of the Vien
nese, who are over-supplied with
Americans, no Austrian families
are associated with the Vienna
campus.


STANFORD-IN-OSTERREICH — Palais Archduke Karl is the home
of Stanford's overseas campus in Austria. The massive five-story
complex Is located in the red-light district of Vienna. Applications
for next year's fall-winter session in Austria are being accepted.

Overseas Campuses, written by

Austria is those left-overs of
the Austro-Hungarian Empire
that nobody wanted. After the
First World War, the French
Premier, Clemenceau somewhat
cruelly described the Austrian
Republic as "that which re
mains."
Since then Austria has suffer
ed economically from its trun
cated existence, separated from
former markets and resources
in eastern Europe. The 1931 col
lapse of the Creditanstalt, which

Is still Vienna's largest bank,
figured prominently in the
worldwide Great Depression.
As a political entity, Austria
is a neutral state wedged be
tween two NATO members,
West Germany and Italy. At
present, neighboring Czechoslo
vakia is filled with Warsaw Pact
troops, and Austria is filled with
Czechoslovak refugees.
The nearness of Soviet troops
is constantly brought home to
the Viennese by the Soviet war
memorial located on a part of
Schwarzenberg Place that was
once renamed Stalin Place by
Soviet occupation authorities-
Conservative Rule
The country is governed by
the People's Party, which stands
for conservative Catholic social
values. The parliamentary op
position is headed by the Soc
ialist Party, which has purged
Marx and Austro-Marxism. The
socialist youth movements say
the Socialist Party developed a
bourgeois, establishmentarian
"coalition mentality" from its
years of post-World War II col
laboration with the People's
Party. Socialist Party rallies us
ually end with the youth singing
the banned "Internationale"
while their embarrassed elders
stand by with tightly pursed
lips.
The older Viennese burghers
are glad to "have their peace."
They fear a return to the civil
strife of the 1930's during which
Dollfuss's clerical fascist gov
ernment cannonaded the Karl-
Marx-Hof housing complex.
There is a past that Austrians
would rather forget. The Aus
trians find that poet W. H.
Auden, who lives outside Vienna,
is hitting a little too close to
home when he says that the
thing that he likes about Aus
tria is that every time you round
a corner there is another old
Nazi.
The city of Vienna itself is
the "waterhead" of the old Em
pire and maintains imperial pre
tensions. Vienna is a monument
to the Hapsburg dynasty. The
"good old days" are everywhere
present in its parks, boulevards,
baroque palaces, and gothic
