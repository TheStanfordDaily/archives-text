# Stanford Minorities Win New Administrative Post
## 
### PENNY HILL 
As a result of last spring's
Black Student Union (BSU) Ad
ministration confrontation, a
black man is now Stanford's as
sistant provost for inter-group
relations.
James E. Simmons, hired with
the help of BSU consultants,
will act as a liaison between Pro
vost Richard W. Lyman's office
and minority groups on campus.
Presently Simmons is in the
process of "trying to adequately
define the new office," he com
mented.
Among the responsibilities of
the office, according to Simmons,
is to try to make Stanford ap
pealing to those minority stu
dents for whom Stanford is
right. He noted that Stanford is
not the best university for all
students, just as all students are
not right for Stanford.
Simmons said that he looks
forward to significant increases
in minority group enrollment,
both on the undergraduate and
graduate levels. "It is the objec
tive of the University to continue
to make significant increases in
enrollment of blacks and
browns," he added.
Spirit Of Today
To handle these admissions,
Simmons said that a minority
group admissions officer "is cer
tainly in the spirit of today." He
stated that he thought "the ad
missions office would be greatly
enhanced by having this type of
capability."

Another aspect of the new
assistant provost's office is work
ing with the eleven new "mar
ginal students." "They are a new
concern at Stanford," he said,
stressing that they are an in
tegral part of the freshman
class. "They represent nothing
but a new thrust and re-evalua
tion of Stanford's role."
Simmons also expressed his
feelings about adding more black
instructors to Stanford's facul
ty. "Having well prepared fac
ulty who are black is a plus for
this institution," Simmons said,
because the students and the uni
versity "would have a top-notch
professor."
Simmons noted a difference
between mostly white and most
ly black universities. He said
that although the black universi
ties don't have the vast financial
resources that Stanford and oth
er universities have, black stu
dents are willing to turn down
invitations to white schools in
favor of the black universities.
He explained this by the pres
ence of a feeling of belonging at
the black universities. "They are
willing to take the risk of at
tending one of these colleges to
have that experience," he said.
Has Many Gusty Feelings
Because he is dealing with the
BSU, many individuals have
wondered about his political
stand. About his militancy he
commented, "I have some real
gutsy feelings about the move
ment, revolution, Black Power,

and development of nationalistic
pride of my people, basically
because I'm black. At the same
time I recognize that I have ac
cepted and will assume admini
strative responsibilities at this
institution, and I will try to carry
out these responsibilities in a
very black way."
Before becoming a member
of the Stanford community, Sim
mons, 37, was the executive di
rector of the Independent
Schools Talent Search Program
at Dartmouth College, Hanover,
N.H. Before that some of the
many positions he has held are
deputy director of the Upward
Bound program in the Office of
Economic Opportunity, 1965-66,
and executive director of CON
TAC, a statewide program link
ing Connecticut colleges and sec
ondary schools during 1962-63.
He still serves as a consultant
for the Upward Bound program,
the U.S. Office of Education, Ed
ucational Associates, Inc., and
the People's Program on Pover
ty, Rich Square, N.C.
After graduating from Hamp
ton Institute, Hampton, Va., in
1965, he received a master's de
gree in education from Harvard
University. Between 1955 and
1960 he taught high school in
North Carolina and Virginia and
was associate dean of men at
Hampton Institute during 1960-
62.
During this year's presidential
campaign, Simmons will head
the Faculty for Humphrey com
mittee.
