# Judicial System Revised
## Constitution Vote Next Week 
### MICHAEL KUHL JEAN McCOMISH 
A proposed revision of the ju
dicial system and one, possibly
two, constitutions will be placed
before students in a special elec
tion set for Monday* and Tues
day of next week.
The referendum on the stu
dent judicial system calls for ap
proval of the "Judicial and Rule
making Bodies recommended by
the Committee-of-15 . . . until
March 1, 1969."
A new ASSU constitution,
first proposed last spring and
since revised by the summer Le
gislature, has received enough
student signatures to be placed
on the ballot, according to ASSU
President Denis Hayes.
A second constitution, pro
posed by the Committee for Stu
dent Responsibility, still needs
the approval of the head of the
political science department be
fore it can be placed on the
ballot.
Text Inside
The texts of the first constitu
tion and the C-15 proposal ap
pear on page and four of
today's Daily. The present
ASSU constitution requires that
they appear at least once more
before the student body votes
on them.
Approval of the C-15 proposal
carries the further stipulation
that the group consider two re
visions, since students do not
view the proposed bodies as
"permanently desirable."
The referendum proposes that
there be "a preponderance of
student members" on [rule-mak

ing and judicial] bodies and
that they be chaired by a stu
dent. It also calls for a system
for "those members of the Stan
ford community who are not
students."
Last Spring's
The proposed constitution was
greatly influenced by the consti
tution voted on last spring which
received more than two-thirds
vote required for approval. The
Elections Commission ruled that
the results were invalid, because
the proposed constitution d i d
not appear in the Daily twice
before the election.
The main features include a
21-member Senate, assessment
of ASSU fees by the student
body, financial autonomy and a
comprehensive Bill of Rights.
Student Senators would be
elected on a campus-wide basis
through the Hare system of pro
portional selection. This system
was used by the faculty this
summer in selecting members of
the Academic Senate.
ISO Members Now
Currently each residence unit
and an equal proportion of off
campus undergraduates and
graduate students elect
sentatives to the 150-member
Legislature.
Proponents of the new consti
tution insist that increasing stu
dent concern with matters of
education and influence in the
University preclude a residence
centered legislative system.
The Committee for Student
Responsibility proposal urges
retention of the present form of

LASSU, but election of an Exec
utive Senate from this body to
perform the week-to-week legis
lative actions.
Political Parties
Along with this revision, the
proposal calls for formation of
political parties within two
weeks of ratification.
The other proposal does not
carry such a requirement, but
as Hayes points out, "If political
parties seem desirable, clearly
this system provides for it."
Concurrent with the referen
dum on the C-15 proposal, the
ASSU-sponsored plan calls for a
judicial body supported by two
thirds of the students voting.
Whether that body takes the
form proposed or another, the
Constitution still has an extend
ed exposition of student rights.
The second proposal lists a
three level system of a primary
student judiciary, a student ap
pellate board, and the Represen
tative Assembly "called to hear
the final appeal of the defen
dant."
The ASSU, as such, would
exist "as an independent corpor
ation" with "the power to enter
into legal agreements binding
upon all parties," according to
Committee for Student Respon
sibility's proposal.
Reactions to the proposed con
stitutions have varied widely
throughout the campus — rang
ing from support to general con
fusion and bewilderment.
Supporters of the ASSU-pro
posed Constitution argue that it

provides for a more effective
governing body and for more
student control of ASSU. They
claim that more money would
be diverted to campus organiza
tions and departmental groups.
Opponents contend that the
proposal leaves the Senate large
ly under the control of the ASSU
President.
Michael Weinstein, former
speaker of the Legislature,
maintained that the Senate, once
free of its financial duties, would
play politics. The ASSU would
voice student opinion on issues
without student backing, while
still tied to the financial shirt
tails of the university, he adds.
The Committee for Student
Responsibility's Constitution
also has its share of supporters
and opponents.
Weinstein feels that a change
would be advisable only if it
were a revolutionary one which
cleared up the hypocritical posi
tion of the present Constitution
in respect to financial autonomy
and student activism.
A voluntary organization, as
proposed by the Committee for
Student Responsibility, would
not provide a strong, cohesive
group capable of getting things
done, says Don Lessard of the
Graduate School of Business.
Lessard, who was active in the
Summer Legislature's delibera
tions on the ASSU proposal,
suggests that the other proposal
would tend to set students off
against the faculty and admini
stration.

March 1, 1969."
A new ASSU constitution,
first proposed last spring and
since revised by the summer Le
gislature, has received enough
student signatures to be placed
on the ballot, according to ASSU
President Denis Hayes.
A second constitution, pro
posed by the Committee for Stu
dent Responsibility, still needs
the approval of the head of the
political science department be
fore it can be placed on the
ballot.
Text Inside
The texts of the first constitu
tion and the C-15 proposal ap
pear on page and four of
today's Daily. The present
ASSU constitution requires that
they appear at least once more
before the student body votes
on them.
Approval of the C-15 proposal
carries the further stipulation
that the group consider two re
visions, since students do not
view the proposed bodies as
"permanently desirable."
The referendum proposes that
there be "a preponderance of
student members" on [rule-mak

ing and judicial] bodies and
that they be chaired by a stu
dent. It also calls for a system
for "those members of the Stan
ford community who are not
students."
Last Spring's
The proposed constitution was
greatly influenced by the consti
tution voted on last spring which
received more than two-thirds
vote required for approval. The
Elections Commission ruled that
the results were invalid, because
the proposed constitution d i d
not appear in the Daily twice
before the election.
The main features include a
21-member Senate, assessment
of ASSU fees by the student
body, financial autonomy and a
comprehensive Bill of Rights.
Student Senators would be
elected on a campus-wide basis
through the Hare system of pro
portional selection. This system
was used by the faculty this
summer in selecting members of
the Academic Senate.
ISO Members Now
Currently each residence unit
and an equal proportion of off
campus undergraduates and
graduate students elect
sentatives to the 150-member
Legislature.
Proponents of the new consti
tution insist that increasing stu
dent concern with matters of
education and influence in the
University preclude a residence
centered legislative system.
The Committee for Student
Responsibility proposal urges
retention of the present form of

LASSU, but election of an Exec
utive Senate from this body to
perform the week-to-week legis
lative actions.
Political Parties
Along with this revision, the
proposal calls for formation of
political parties within two
weeks of ratification.
The other proposal does not
carry such a requirement, but
as Hayes points out, "If political
parties seem desirable, clearly
this system provides for it."
Concurrent with the referen
dum on the C-15 proposal, the
ASSU-sponsored plan calls for a
judicial body supported by two
thirds of the students voting.
Whether that body takes the
form proposed or another, the
Constitution still has an extend
ed exposition of student rights.
The second proposal lists a
three level system of a primary
student judiciary, a student ap
pellate board, and the Represen
tative Assembly "called to hear
the final appeal of the defen
dant."
The ASSU, as such, would
exist "as an independent corpor
ation" with "the power to enter
into legal agreements binding
upon all parties," according to
Committee for Student Respon
sibility's proposal.
Reactions to the proposed con
stitutions have varied widely
throughout the campus — rang
ing from support to general con
fusion and bewilderment.
Supporters of the ASSU-pro
posed Constitution argue that it

provides for a more effective
governing body and for more
student control of ASSU. They
claim that more money would
be diverted to campus organiza
tions and departmental groups.
Opponents contend that the
proposal leaves the Senate large
ly under the control of the ASSU
President.
Michael Weinstein, former
speaker of the Legislature,
maintained that the Senate, once
free of its financial duties, would
play politics. The ASSU would
voice student opinion on issues
without student backing, while
still tied to the financial shirt
tails of the university, he adds.
The Committee for Student
Responsibility's Constitution
also has its share of supporters
and opponents.
Weinstein feels that a change
would be advisable only if it
were a revolutionary one which
cleared up the hypocritical posi
tion of the present Constitution
in respect to financial autonomy
and student activism.
A voluntary organization, as
proposed by the Committee for
Student Responsibility, would
not provide a strong, cohesive
group capable of getting things
done, says Don Lessard of the
Graduate School of Business.
Lessard, who was active in the
Summer Legislature's delibera
tions on the ASSU proposal,
suggests that the other proposal
would tend to set students off
against the faculty and admini
stration.
A proposed revision of the ju
dicial system and one, possibly
two, constitutions will be placed
before students in a special elec
tion set for Monday* and Tues
day of next week.
The referendum on the stu
dent judicial system calls for ap
proval of the "Judicial and Rule
making Bodies recommended by

The texts of the first constitu
tion and the C-15 proposal ap
pear on page and four of
today's Daily. The present
ASSU constitution requires that
they appear at least once more
before the student body votes
on them.
Approval of the C-15 proposal
carries the further stipulation
that the group consider two re
visions, since students do not
view the proposed bodies as
"permanently desirable."
The referendum proposes that
there be "a preponderance of
student members" on [rule-mak

ing and judicial] bodies and
that they be chaired by a stu
dent. It also calls for a system
for "those members of the Stan
ford community who are not
students."
Last Spring's
The proposed constitution was
greatly influenced by the consti
tution voted on last spring which
received more than two-thirds
vote required for approval. The
Elections Commission ruled that
the results were invalid, because
the proposed constitution d i d
not appear in the Daily twice
before the election.
The main features include a
21-member Senate, assessment
of ASSU fees by the student
body, financial autonomy and a
comprehensive Bill of Rights.
Student Senators would be
elected on a campus-wide basis
through the Hare system of pro
portional selection. This system
was used by the faculty this
summer in selecting members of
the Academic Senate.
ISO Members Now
Currently each residence unit
and an equal proportion of off
campus undergraduates and
graduate students elect
sentatives to the 150-member
Legislature.
Proponents of the new consti
tution insist that increasing stu
dent concern with matters of
education and influence in the
University preclude a residence
centered legislative system.
The Committee for Student
Responsibility proposal urges
retention of the present form of

LASSU, but election of an Exec
utive Senate from this body to
perform the week-to-week legis
lative actions.
Political Parties
Along with this revision, the
proposal calls for formation of
political parties within two
weeks of ratification.
The other proposal does not
carry such a requirement, but
as Hayes points out, "If political
parties seem desirable, clearly
this system provides for it."
Concurrent with the referen
dum on the C-15 proposal, the
ASSU-sponsored plan calls for a
judicial body supported by two
thirds of the students voting.
Whether that body takes the
form proposed or another, the
Constitution still has an extend
ed exposition of student rights.
The second proposal lists a
three level system of a primary
student judiciary, a student ap
pellate board, and the Represen
tative Assembly "called to hear
the final appeal of the defen
dant."
The ASSU, as such, would
exist "as an independent corpor
ation" with "the power to enter
into legal agreements binding
upon all parties," according to
Committee for Student Respon
sibility's proposal.
Reactions to the proposed con
stitutions have varied widely
throughout the campus — rang
ing from support to general con
fusion and bewilderment.
Supporters of the ASSU-pro
posed Constitution argue that it

provides for a more effective
governing body and for more
student control of ASSU. They
claim that more money would
be diverted to campus organiza
tions and departmental groups.
Opponents contend that the
proposal leaves the Senate large
ly under the control of the ASSU
President.
Michael Weinstein, former
speaker of the Legislature,
maintained that the Senate, once
free of its financial duties, would
play politics. The ASSU would
voice student opinion on issues
without student backing, while
still tied to the financial shirt
tails of the university, he adds.
The Committee for Student
Responsibility's Constitution
also has its share of supporters
and opponents.
Weinstein feels that a change
would be advisable only if it
were a revolutionary one which
cleared up the hypocritical posi
tion of the present Constitution
in respect to financial autonomy
and student activism.
A voluntary organization, as
proposed by the Committee for
Student Responsibility, would
not provide a strong, cohesive
group capable of getting things
done, says Don Lessard of the
Graduate School of Business.
Lessard, who was active in the
Summer Legislature's delibera
tions on the ASSU proposal,
suggests that the other proposal
would tend to set students off
against the faculty and admini
stration.
A proposed revision of the ju
dicial system and one, possibly
two, constitutions will be placed
before students in a special elec
tion set for Monday* and Tues
day of next week.
The referendum on the stu
dent judicial system calls for ap
proval of the "Judicial and Rule
making Bodies recommended by
the Committee-of-15 . . . until
March 1, 1969."
A new ASSU constitution,
first proposed last spring and
since revised by the summer Le
gislature, has received enough
student signatures to be placed
on the ballot, according to ASSU
President Denis Hayes.
A second constitution, pro
posed by the Committee for Stu
dent Responsibility, still needs
the approval of the head of the
political science department be
fore it can be placed on the
ballot.
