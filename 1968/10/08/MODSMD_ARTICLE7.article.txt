# Lyman Assails Federal Cuts
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTS 
Stanford researchers with Na
tional Science Foundation (NSF)
support were given the bad news
yesterday at a meeting with
JProvost Richard Lyman: cut
back.
Meanwhile, Lyman blasted the
sudden cuts.
"It seems to me the whole
system has been turned around,"

he said. 'The car has been
♦turned around in the middle of
a day's driving. For years, the
project grant system has served
us well, but now it's beginning
to show its teeth."
Faced with a slash in NSF
funding for the present govern
ment fiscal year, administra
tors have been busy for the past
several weeks devising a scheme
for apportioning the reductions.
The final formula was based
on continuing projects, new
grants, traineeships, and sum
mer institute funds.
New Formula
Each school will be allowed
to spend an amount equal to 70
per cent of last year's expendi
tures on projects continuing
now, plus full traineeship and
summer institute allocations,
plus 70 per cent of new grants
received since July 1.
Deans and department heads
will be responsible for slicing
the shrunken pie among the
principal investigators in each
school.
This formula gives $17,815 to
Business, $189,100 to Earth Sci
ences, $699,348 to Education, $1,-
153,233 to Engineering, $504,955
to the Stanford Electronics Labs,
$440,712 to the Humanities and
Social Sciences, and $2,254,365 to
the Physical Sciences.
Also allocated were $311,610 to
Medicine $430,875 for the Insti
tute for Mathematical Studies in
the Social Sciences, $149,130 for
the Hansen Labs, and $125,485
for unsponsored research.

Provision was also made for
$66,000 in dependency allowances
to go along with the trainee
ships, and a special fund of
$815,422 as a reserve fund for
new grants (awarded after Oc
tober 7) and contingencies.
Although Stanford had expect
ed $9.5 or $10 million from NSF
this year, the budget cutbacks
imposed by Congress when they
approved the six per cent sutrax
forced NSF to put a ceiling on
expenditures this year.
Large cuts are also expected
from other government agencies,
but these will not be felt until
contracts are renewed or new
grants applied for.
Lyman began the meeting,
held in Bishop Auditorium, by
attacking the timing and method
of the NSF slash.
"Strongest Grievances"
"One of my strongest griev
ances is imposed upon — I'm
not going to say the NSF — but
the Congress, Bureau of the Bud
get, and the Foundation," he
said, for forcing the cut within
the contract year.
He charged this move "mini
mized the chances for a fair
application" of the cuts, "and
maximizeed the chances for con
fusion" and dissention among
the investigators.
Lyman noted that the reduc
tion in research funds will cause
a half-million dollar loss in in
diirect cost payments, creating a
$700,000 defiicit in this year's
University budget.
Indirect costs are expenses in
curred by the school in maintain
ing facilities so that contracted
research can be conducted. The
University is partially reim
bursed for the time the research
er spends away from teaching.
It is determined as a varying
percentage of the direct cost
(amount of contract or grant
spent).
The loss in funds results in
a similar loss in indirect pay
ments.
Another possible contributor
to Stanford's red-ink budget is
Sen. Miko Mansfield's (D.-Mont.)
amendment to the Defense De
partment bill which would limit
indirect cost payments for De
fense research contracts to 25
per cent of direct costs.
Stanford now receives as much
as 57 per cent of direct costs.
This amendment, if approved,
would cost the University an

other half-million dollars this
year.
Not Immediately Damaging
Controller Kenneth Creighton
reported that the deficit would
not be damaging immediately.
Stanford has built up a $3 mil
lion surplus over the past sev
eral years, he noted, and this
would handle the funds loss.
The main problem will arise,
he noted, if the cuts continue
through 1969-70 and 1970-71. Be
cause of normal increases in ex
penditures, the surplus will not
be enough to cover another de
ficit.
This year is the first time in
about 15 years that Stanford
has been forced into deficit fi
nancing.
Another speaker at the meet
ing, Associate Provost and Pro
fessor of Computer Science Wil
liam F. Miller, noted that more
funds were added to the re
search area by slashing the
planned construction allocation.
In August, more than $700,-
000 had been set aside from NSF
funds for building projects. This
has now been reduced to $229,-
000.
Total Expenditures
This amount, plus those pre
viously mentioned, constitute
the total expenditures allowed
this year by NSF, $7,387,000.
Miller also said traineeships
were not cut because the school
considered them unbreakable
"commitments."
William Baxter, professor of
law and chairman of the Aca
demic Council's Research Policy
Committee, commented on the
new formula for funds alloca
tion.
The plan, he said, "avoids nor
mative comparisons of research
projects—weighing one vs. the
other—at University level. Noth
ing would be more conducive to
warfare."
The decision is left to schools
and departments.
'There's nothing magically,
unassailably right" about the
formula, he added. "It's at least
as good as any other, we think,
and much better than many."
Some professors were dis
turbed at the sudden shock of
the cuts. Paul Ehrlich, professor
of biology, urged that Stanford
engage in more deficit spending
to "ease the pain all around."
He was supported by Ingram
Olkin, professor of statistics.
