# Have I Ever Lied To You?
## Cure For Nuke-Fear 
### ART BUCHWALD 
One of the things that Gen.
Curtis LeMay said at his press
conference last week was that
Americans seem to have a pho
bia about nuclear weapons. This
struck home because I have to
admit I've had such a phobia for
some time. But only after Gen.
LeMay bi'ought it up did I decide
to do something about it. I went
to see Dr. Adolph Strainedluff,
a psychiatrist who specializes in
nuclear weapon phobias.
"On the couch," he said. "Vat
seems to be the trouble?"
"Doctor," I said staring at the
ceiling, "I have this fear of nu
clear weapons. I know it's silly,
but to me it's very real."
"Aha, very hinterasting. Ven
did you first become aware of
such a phobia?"
"I think it was around the
time of Hiroshima or Nagasaki,
I'm not sure which. I saw these
photos of all these people killed
and miles and miles of rubble,
and suddenly I got this thing
about atomic weapons."
Dr. Strainedluff tapped a pen
cil against his knee. "So tell me,
how does this phobia manifest
itself?"

"In peculiar ways, Doctor. I
get the feeling if I ever see a
mushroom cloud, I'm going to
die."
"Very hinteresting, very hin
teresting. You know it's all in the
mind, don't you?"
"Of course. That's why I came
to you. I don't want to do any
thing stupid."
Dr. Strainedluff said, "You are
a very sick man. You think that
just because an atomic bomb
killed a few thousand people 23
years ago, you are threatened.
You are manifesting infantile re
pressed hostility toward the
weapons of war. In psychiatry
we call this a military-industrial
inferiority complex."
"I know I'm sick. You've got
to help me," I begged.
"All right. First you haff to
get over this absurd fear of nu
clear bombs. You must think of
them as just another weapon in
our vast defensive arsenal. Ve
haff bowie knives and H-bombs,
and in war, one is just as good
as another. You're not afraid of
a knife, are you?"
"Well, I don't think about it
a lot."
"So vhy should you be afraid

of an H-bomb? It's another form
of a knife."
"I never thought of it like
that."
"Okay, so now let's look at
some facts straight in the eye.
In Bikini we blew up 20 bombs
in an experiment. So ve thought
everything vould be destroyed,
that's how stupid ve were. Do
you know that now after all the
boom boom, the place is flourish
ing and the rats are fatter than
they ever vas before?"
"It's good to hear."
"The coconuts are hanging
from the trees, fish are svim
ming in the lagoon and the voice
of the turtle can be heard in the
land. The only things that don't
seem to be doing so good are
the land crabs."
"I don't like land crabs," I
said.
"So, then you don't haff any
thing to vorry about."
Dr. Strainedluff started play
ing with the hand grenade which
was attached to his watch fob.
"If you're going to be a happy,
normal human being," he shout
ed, "you're going to haff to stop
with all these guilty peace feel
ings."
He was stomping around the
room. "So get out of here vith
your lousy phobias, and all this
stuff about being afraid to die.
If you're not villing to take a
little fallout for the good of the
country, then go back vhere you
came from!"
In spite of Dr. Strainedluff's
final outburst, he did cure me
of my phobia. I'm no longer
afraid of nuclear weapons. Now
I'm afraid of him.
