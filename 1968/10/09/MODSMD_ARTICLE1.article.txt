# SES Calls For Undergraduate Study Reforms
## 
### BROOKE SHEARER RICKI WARD 
The general studies program
is characterized by "rigidity,
superficiality, selectivity, and
unreality."
From this premise, the Re
port on Undergraduate Educa
tion of the Study of Education
at Stanford proposes sweeping
changes in the university's
undergraduate organization, re
quirements, and curriculum,
keynoted by the creation of the
new position, Dean of Under
graduate Studies.
In one of the SES's major po
sition papers, the report includes
specific suggestions for an at
tenuated general studies pro
gram, a restructured freshman
year, creation of a semester sys
tem with a reading period, ex
tension of pass-fail grading, and
greater emphasis on independent
and honors work.
The SES committee urges
adoption of all recommendations
"in their entirety," terming the
report a "comprehensive and co
herent effort" to develop pro
grams, complementing, rather

than conflicting, with the educa
tional process.
In place of the heavily criti
cized general studies program,
the report proposes a set of min
imal university-wide prescrip
tions, which allow much greater
freedom of choice than is pres
ently available to undergradu
ates.
According to an unofficial re
lease of the preliminary version
of the report, the post of a Dean
of Undergraduate Studies would
replace the "confusingly over
lapping" positions of the Dean
of Undergraduate Education and
the Director of General Studies.
At the same time, the report
recommends that the two Aca
demic Council committees that
oversee these administrative
posts — the Committee on
Undergraduate Education and
the Committee on General Stu
dies — be consolidated into a
single committee on undergrad
uate studies.
One of the Dean's most im
portant initial duties would be
to oversee the implementation of
the many changes that the re
port proposes.

The report urges that distri
butional requirements be kept
"at the absolute minimum nec
essary to prevent educational
lopsidedness." Each student
would have his choice of any
two courses in each of the fol
lowing three areas: humanities,
social sciences, and natural sci
cn'-p1; and technology. This
aid eliminate the present re*
Irements in mathematics,

languages, laboratory sciences,
and other areas.
These area requirements would
determine about one-fourth of a
.indent's total program. The re
port suggests that another
fourth of his work should be
designed in accordance with his
own interests. They therefore
propose that a students major
department should be able to
prescribe not more than one
half of his total program, as

measured by courses taken.
Reconstructed Freshman Year
All freshmen would be re
quired to take a tutorial simi'ar
i , r]i ■- nt freshman
fh would be designed to pro
' ide practice in writing and ex
posure to some aspect of his
torical studies. This would elimi
nate the need for both English
and History of Western Civiliza
tion, traditionally required
freshman courses.

If a student preferred a tutor
ial in a scientific field, he could
still satisfy his English re
quirements by taking a one
term writing course in conjunc
tion with some other class, under
Ihe supervision of the English
department. .He .could also
choose from a variety of one
term courses in historical studies
in satisfaction of the freshman
history requirement.
More Honors Work
The report's recommendations
for the design of the undergrad
uate curriculum call for a rapid
move toward more independent
and honors courses and more
self-directed work in the form
of individual research, special
projects, and extensive papers in
regular courses.
The faculty is encouraged to
extend regular credit for any
course upon satisfactory com
pletion of a written or oral
exam, without requiring that
the student be formally enrolled
in class.
In order for this new emphasis
to be successful, the report rec
ommends that the academic cal
endar be restructured to include
a reading period prior to final
examinations.
Reading Period
These reading periods would
be free from all formal academic
appointments and examinations,
and would allow students to con
centrate on self-directed work
or review, synthesize, and reflect
on what they have learned.
Although there are some stu
dents who would waste this
time, experience at other schools
which schedule reading periods,
schools such as Harvard and
Yale, has indicated that the great
majority would make good use
of the time. Most students bene
fit from the opportunity to work
entirely on their own for short
periods of time. Finally, "there
could be no better preparation
for the individual responsibility
of graduate education and for
the process of continual s e If
education which must take place
after a student has finished his
formal schooling."
The committee suggests that
two longer terms of the semes
ter calendar are better suited to
the inclusion of the reading pe
riod than the three terms of the
present quarter system. They
therefore recommend an aca
demic year which would begin
immediately after Labor Day
and end late in May.
would be a two week
Christmas vacation imme.ii \tely
before the winter reading pe
riod and a one-week break at
Easter in the middle of the
spring semester.
An alternative calendar which
would still include the reading
period is a semester system
which would begin in late Aug
ust, and allow the completion of
the fall term before Christmas
vacation. The second semester
would then end in late May. If
the quarter system must be re
tained, the instructional period
could be shortened to nine
weeks to allow the inclusion of a
one and one-half week reading
period.

The report does not advocate
a complete pass-fail system
even though Stanford graded its
first students in that manner. It
favors the retention of A, B, and
C, and recommends the addition
of a "pass," to serve as the only
grades. The present D and F
grades would be eliminated and
the sole penalty for failing to
complete a course would be loss
of credit towards graduation.
The study recommends that
the pass-fail option be extended
to include any course, subject
only to the consent of the in
structor and department con
cerned. Further, students should
be allowed to take an unlimited
number of pass-fail courses.
The credit system now in use
should be replaced, offers SES,
by a course credit system. Credit
for 32 course i under the semes
ter system, or 36 under the
quarter system, should be re
quired for a Bachelor's degree.
This would mean 4 courses per
semester or 3 courses per quar
ter would represent the standard
academic load.
With the elimination of units
of credit, the student will have
no way of judging just how
much work a course will re
quire. Therefore, each depart
ment should publish a detailed
course description for each class
that it offers before preregistra
tion each term.
Field Work
The study encourages the un
dertaking of field work and oth
er forms of "off-campus learn
ing," but it suggests that some
outcomes of such activities are
directed "to affect rather than
to knowledge," and so lie out
side the proper judgment of the
University. The committee there
fore suggests that the ASSU
and the Dean of Students estab
lish a "social service clearing
house with a full-time director,
to serve as an information and
coordination center for field
work that stresses social ser
vice."
At the same time, the univer
sity departments should estab
lish a regular course entitled Di
rected Field Research, which
could provide preparation and
supervision for field work of an
academic nature.
Self-Designed Majors
The report also proposes three
special programs, which would
give even more freedom to those
who do not wish to follow the
standard college curriculum.
First of these special programs
is the self-designed major, in
tended for students who can pre
sent "an intellectually coherent
plan of concentration that cuts
across departmental lines."
The second proposal goes one
step further, and is intended
"for a very limited number of
students who show "exceptional
and unusual promise of intel
lectual or artistic creativity."
The proposed University Honors
Program would allow these few
to design their entire undergrad
uate programs free of all for
mal concentration or distribu
tion requirements.
In sum, the Study of Educa
tion at Stanford views the gen
eral education ideal as "totally
impracticable as a dominant cur
ricular pattern in the modern
university."

ON THE LEFT — At a rally In White Plaza yesterday students
called for a continuation of the boycott on table grapes in support
of unionization among farm workers. At the end of the rally a
group of students aligned with the Students for a Democratic
Society tacked a demand that Stanford sever links in Southeast
Asia on the door of the Quad office of the Board of Trustees.
