Editor, The DAILY:
I am writing to you concern
ing your editorial in Stanford
Daily of October 8, 1968.
Your writer properly pointed
out that there exists a grape
strike and a grape boycott. More
important than the grape boy
cott itself, though, is the boy
cott of stores which sell grapes.
By forcing stores to take
grapes off their shelves, we hope
to put much greater pressure
upon the grape growers. If
stores order no table grapes,
growers will sell no grapes.
Today was begun a petition to
be presented to the director of
the Union food service at Tres
sider. It requests that the Un
ion stop serving table grapes. It
may be signed by anyone con
nected with the Stanford Com
munity at the grape table in
White Plaza this week.
Students who support the
worker's strike and the boycott
effort can help by not purchas
ing at stores which sell grapes.
The only grocery chains now
not selling grapes are Purity,
Littleman, and Co-op.
If you make a special trip to
one of these stores, it would be
helpful if people would mention
to the manager that you are
only there because his store does
not sell grapes.
There is much more going on
than just a simple grape boy
cott, as the editorial implied.
