## Czechs Supported 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
A group of nine faculty mem
bers have joined forces to lend
moral and material support to
those Czechoslovakians exiled
since last month's invasion.
Tomorrow and Thursday on
White Memorial Plaza, a group
of Czech origin will be collect
ing signatures on a petition de
ploring "the Soviet invasion and
occupation."
The faculty members of the
Stanford - for - Czechoslavakia
Committee will discuss their
feelings on the current Czech
situation and urge support to
night at 8 in the Tresidder large
lounge.
In a letter sent to all faculty
members yesterday, the commit
tee said that the "hundreds of
Czechoslovak scholars, scien
tists, writers, and artists who
are at present in Western Eu
rope . . . cannot and should not
be forced to return under the
present conditions to Czecho
slovakia."
Native Country
The letter expressed the
group's hope that these intellec
tuals would "be able to go back
soon to their native country and
continue their work," but that
they need help their own
personal safety can be assured.
Political Science Prof. Gabriel
Almond, who will be bne of the
speakers in tonight's open meet
ing, points out the tremendous
change that had overtaken the
country before Russian soldiers
entered the country.
"No scholar of East European
politics would have dared pre
dict a decade ago that Czecho
slovakia would pop out loaded
with democratic impulses," he
said yesterday.
Vital Tendency
Almond is impressed that this
"very vital and democratic ten

dency" came out of the Commu
nist party itself. Because of this
origin, the Czechs were "able to
avoid extremes" in reconciling
socialism to democratic reforms,
he said.
The Russian invasion indi
cates to Almond "the probability
that these same tendencies are
prevalent in the Soviet Union,"
and that this was the only way
they knew of quelling them.
History Prof. Gordon Craig is
bothered by the Russian action
because of what it means to "the
whole business of nuclear con
trol."
Disarticulation
"This is a complete disarticu
lation of Russian policy to date,"
Craig said. Recalling the Nazi
invasion of 30 years ago that
lead to World War 11, he sug
gested that events in Czechosla
vakia might well "lead to a situ
ation where we could blow the
world up."
A third speaker for tonight's
meeting, Prof. Jan Triska of the
Institute of Political Studies,
speaks as a refugee who fled
Czechoslovakia and who has
since watched his country go
through tremendous change.
As a person who has been out
side of Czechoslovakia, except
for a few brief visits, he refers
to the changes after the ouster
of Novotony as something that
"really gave hope to many of us
in the West."
Passive Reaction
Referring to the passive reac
tion which he personally ob
served after the Soviet invasion,
Triska says that this was "a
proud unity of the people over
night.
The change was so dramatic
during the past years that Tris
ka was "very warmly accepted
by the people" during his past
five trips to Prague.

Attempting to describe the
temper of the people before
Russian entrance, Triska uses
terms like "populist, heady, ex
citing."
Reexamination
Czech leaders were encourag
ing re-examination of their
country's history, but they were
also cautioning against exces
sive criticism. They were saying,
"We know where we're going,
but we don't know how we're
getting there," Triska reports.
The Russian soldiers who
were sent into Prague were at
loss to find the counter revolu
tionaries who supposedly trig
gered their military action.
"They couldn't find an enemy.
Just imagine the fustration," he
says.
Triska insists that Russia's ac
tion differs substantially from
the Nazi invasion in 1938. In the
latter case "everything was se
cured within 24 hours."
"Some of my friends in Czech
oslovakia think that the Rus
sians really had never thought
about invading their country.
They think it must have been a
last minute thing," he said.
Other faculty members who
will speak tonight include: Milo
rad Drachkovitch, William Lin
ville, Philip Rhinelander, Carl
Spaeth, Wayne Vucinich, and
Bertram Wolfe.
