• McCarthy Declines
NEW YORK (AP) — Sen. Eu
gene McCarthy, in his first ma
jor political speech since losing
the Democratic presidential
nomination to Hubert H. Huir
phrey in August, declined again
Tuesday night to support the
vice president's campaign.
"The call goes out for party
unity, just as did a year ago,"
McCarthy said. "It was not ac
ceptable then, and it's not any
more acceptable today."
The Minnesota senator spoke
at a $100-a-plate fund-raising
dinner for New York Demo
cratic senatorial nominee Paul
O'Dwyer, a peace candidate
who also has consistently re
fused to support Humphrey.
McCarthy said his efforts to
change the direction of the
Democratic party were not
aimed at getting anybody elect
ed.
But he said he saw "no reason
why the direction of the party
could not be changed with a
presidential candidate this year."
He listed three conditions he
thought should be met to change
the direction: Shifts in Vietnam
war policy, a restructuring of
the draft system and restructur
ing of the party machinery.
McCarthy received a three
minute standing ovation from
the 1,400 persons who packed
the grand ballroom of the New
York Hilton Hotel.
McCarthy reviewed his efforts
over the past year and said that
he began his presidential cam
paign more so "to raise issues
than to save or divide the Dem
ocratic party."
He added, "We did not raise

these issues to gain control. We
did not raise the issues to win
office."
• Political Roundup
Hubert H. Humphrey visited
the House of Representatives
Tuesday and challenged Rich
ard M. Nixon to end a Republi
can filibuster blowing passage
of a bill to permit television de
bates between the presidential
candidates.
The vice president, who has
repeatedly tried to prod his
GOP opponent into a debate,
called on Nixon to end the par
liamentary roadblock, saying
the American people "want to
hear serious talk about the chal
lenges facing the nation."
Earlier in the day, the Demo
cratic presidential candidate
proposed regular annual sum
mit meetings between Soviet
and U.S. leaders. These "infor
mal" meetings, Humphrey said,
would be "free of the publicity,
free of the high expectations
that surround irregular summit
mee Ings."
Campaigning in the Middle
West, Nixon charged that Hum
phrey envisions $50 billion in
added government spending,
and would be "the most expen
sive president in U.S. history."
Speaking in Humphrey's
home town of Minneapolis, Nix
on said he himself supported
lower federal taxes and cuts in
federal spending.
The Republican presidential
nominee switched his bombs to
third party candidate George C.
Wallace before an audience of
5,000 persons in industrial Flint,
Mich.

Nixon urged working men not
to waste their vote on a candi
date who couldn't win, saying,
"Do you just want to get some
thing off your chest or do you
want to get something done."
Wallace was in Boston, visit
ing the historic USS Constitu
tion and the Boston Common,
where he drew one of the largest
crowds of his campaign.
At the Boston Naval Yard he
promised to strengthen the mili
tary, but repeated his belief that
"nuclear war is unthinkable."
Wallace's running mate, re
tired Air Force Gen. Curtis
LeMay, told a news conference
in Los Angeles that he joined
the third party campaign be
cause he feared that Nixon
would pack his cabinet with
left-wingers.
In Miami, Democratic vice
presidential nominee Sen. Ed
mund S. Muskie criticized Wal
lace's choice of a running mate,
saying it was dictated by a
"philosophy of violence and
overkill."
Muskie in turn was criticized
by his GOP counterpart, Mary
land Gov. Spiro T. Agnew, who
criticized the Maine senator's
"approbation for the law break
er." Agnew said Muskie had not
condemned, strongly enough,
three students who burned their
draft cards in his presence.
• Cleaver Speaks
BERKELEY (AP) —Black
Pan 1 her Eldridge Cleaver deliv
ered the first of a much-opposed
series of lectures on racism
Tuesday, speaking courteously
and avoiding the obscenities that
have studded other recent talks.
The 33-year-old ex-convict,
who in the past has applied four
letter words to Gov. Reagan and
university regents who opposed
his selection as a speaker, ad
dressed 400 students in a class
room at the University of Cali
fornia.
He spoke politely and articu
lately, then answered questions.
Cleaver, neatly attired in a
black suit and wearing two
strings of beads, said that where
as the white dress of a bride
symbolizes purity that black is
for funeral, a black beard means
a pirate ,a black cat means bad
luck.

"These negative connotations
of blackness stigmatize the
black man as having evil conno
tations," Cleaver told the nearly
100 enrolled in the course and
more than 300 auditing it for
possible future choice.
Student sponsors of the
course, Social Analysis 139 X,
still hope those taking it will get
credit. But the class began Tues
day in Room 155, Dwinelle Hall,
as a noncredit course in order
that Cleaver can be permitted 10
lectures.
• Gun Control
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen
ate - House conferees agreed
Tuesday on a bill to prohibit in
terstate mail order sale of all
fiirearms and ammunition.
The compromise measure also
includes a general ban on over
the-counter sale of firearms to
nonresidents of a state and pro
hibits sales of rifles and shot
guns to persons under 18 years
of age. Persons under 21 al
ready are banned from buying
handguns.
Sen. Thomas J. Dodd, D-
Conn., chief Senate sponsor of
the legislation, hailed the com
promise as "a milestone."
The measure supplements a
section of the Omnibus Crime
Control and Safe Streets Act
passed earlier in the year ban
ning interstate mail order sales
of handguns.
It extends this ban to rifles
and shotguns and also covers
sales of all kinds of ammuni
tion.
Besides the prohibition on in
terstate mail order sales, the
bill regulates sales of firearms
by mail within a state by pro
viding for a seven-day waiting
period and the filing of an affi
davit of eligibility by the pur
chaser.
Over-the-counter sales to non
residents would be prohibited
except that a person could buy a
long gun in an adjoining state
if he qualified under the laws
of both states.
The measure would become
effective on Dec. 16, the same
date as the section of the crime
control bill curbing handgun
sales.

• Student Convicted
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A
theological student was convict
ed Tuesday of willfully refusing
military induction. Henry Duval
Gregory IV, 25, could receive a
maximum five-year prison term
and a $10,000 fine.

ginia graduate, was called for
induction by his Roanoke, Va.,
draft board after he turned in
his draft card in a demonstra
tion outside the San Francisco
federal building.
U.S. Dist. Judge Stanley Wei
gel handed down his verdict
without leaving the bench after
rejecting as irrelevant testimony
from two foes of the Vietnam
war.
On the stand Monday, the
Presbyterian student of San
Francisco Theological Seminary

deferment as a clergy student
would have for him been an act
of hypocrisy.
Judge Weigel Tuesday de
clared the testimony of Dr. Rob

University religion professor, ir
relevant ,and on government ob
jection refused to let J. B. Nie
lands, University of California
biochemist, testify at all.
Brown had testified on the be
liefs of draft resisters acting
through conscience. Nielands
wanted to tell his view of Amer
ican military operations in Viet
nam, where he had visited the
north last year.
Weigel told defense counsel
Aubrey Grossman, "We are not
here to argue the merits of the
war in Vietnam. The question
simply is, did the young man
refuse induction violate the law
and know its consequences?"
• Arms Uncovered
SAIGON (AP) — Massive al
lied sweeps turned up an enemy
arms warehouse Tuesday, add
ing to the more than 150 tons of
munitions and supplies the U.S.

The cache—called a "logistical
warehouse"—was turned up by
South Vietnamese troops near
the provincial capital of Quang

• Czech Delegation
PRAGUE (AP) — A Czecho
slovak government delegation
arrived in Moscow Tuesday
night to negotiate a treaty legal
izing the occupation of their
country by a Soviet-led force of
Warsaw Pact nations, Czecho
slovak sources reported.
Their arrival was confirmed
as the Presidium of the Czecho
slovak Communist party ap
proved commitments made in
Moscow last week by party
chief Alexander Dubcek, the
news agency CTX reported.
They included promises of fur
ther limitations on Dubcek's lib
eral reform program and agree
ment on the continued stay of
some of the occupation troops.
A communique on the Presidi
um meeting, which brought to
gether Dubcek and his chief as
sistants, said the Presidium
"approved the procedure of the
Czechoslovak delegation" at the
Moscow talks. This shunted to
one side reports that the party
leadership would rebel against
the harsh Kremlin demands.
Although Czechoslovakia
agreed at last week's talks in
Moscow to a tightening of press
controls and partial return to
Soviet-style communism, the
Presidium emphasizes the party
"must continue all the positive
features" of its popular reform
policies launched last January.
Prague had agreed to con
sider and sign a treaty that
would cloak the occupation with
legality in Moscow talks between
Dubcek and Soviet leaders.
Czechoslovak informants have
said the number of troops to re
main will be at least seven divi
sions, or about 100,000 men. But
some reports said the number
staying is still up for negotia
tions and the Russians may in
sist on more.
• Record Roll-Call
WASHINGTON (AP)—Repub
licans locked the House in a
parliamentary vice Tuesday in
an attempt to prevent action on
a bill that would permit tele
vised debates between the ma
jor presidential condidates.
The Republicans made repeat
ed demands that a quorum be
present, forcing an endless
round of roll calls that kept the
House from taking up any bills.
Their delaying tactics began
at noon and by 9:30 p. m. 18 roll
calls had been taken. They tied
up the House despite a personal

visit from Vice President Hu
bert H. Humphrey in an effort
to loose the jam.
The vice president also issued
a strong call to Republican can
didate Richard M. Nixon, urging
him to clear the roadblock by
supporting the bill.
• Jaywalker Shot
A white motorcycle policeman
shot and killed an unidentified
Negro man who alllegedly re
sisted arrest for a pedestrian
traffic violation.
In a brief but violent protest
over the fatal shooting, angry
blacks poured onto the main
business street of Washington's
northwest Negro district last
night.
One major fire was reported
and the crowd stoned fiiremen
and broke scores of shop win
dows before a massive show of
force by riot-trained special po
lice units brought calm.
No arrests were reported and
there were no injuries except
one fireman overcome by smoke.
Tear gas was used sparingly
in the section, scene of last
April's riots following the mur
der of Dr. Martin Luther King.
Officers said they used gas to
chase persons off roofs who
were hurling objects to the
streets below.
One incident of looting was re
ported, but officials said the
main damage came from brok
en plate glass windows and the
fire, which gutted an auto parts
firm.

His talk was promoted by a
rally a few minutes earlier in

a Democratic Society chapter de
manded that Smith state his po

The 33-year-old ex-convict,
who in the past has applied four

a pirate ,a black cat means bad
luck.

"These negative connotations

• Gun Control
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen
ate - House conferees agreed
Tuesday on a bill to prohibit in
terstate mail order sale of all
fiirearms and ammunition.
The compromise measure also
includes a general ban on over
the-counter sale of firearms to
nonresidents of a state and pro
hibits sales of rifles and shot
guns to persons under 18 years
of age. Persons under 21 al
ready are banned from buying
handguns.
Sen. Thomas J. Dodd, D-
Conn., chief Senate sponsor of
the legislation, hailed the com
promise as "a milestone."
The measure supplements a
section of the Omnibus Crime
Control and Safe Streets Act
passed earlier in the year ban
ning interstate mail order sales
of handguns.
It extends this ban to rifles
and shotguns and also covers
sales of all kinds of ammuni

Besides the prohibition on in
terstate mail order sales, the
bill regulates sales of firearms
by mail within a state by pro
viding for a seven-day waiting
period and the filing of an affi
davit of eligibility by the pur
chaser.
Over-the-counter sales to non
residents would be prohibited
except that a person could buy a
long gun in an adjoining state
if he qualified under the laws
of both states.
The measure would become
effective on Dec. 16, the same

PRAGUE (AP) — A Czecho
slovak government delegation
arrived in Moscow Tuesday
night to negotiate a treaty legal
izing the occupation of their
country by a Soviet-led force of
Warsaw Pact nations, Czecho
slovak sources reported.
Their arrival was confirmed
as the Presidium of the Czecho
slovak Communist party ap
proved commitments made in
Moscow last week by party
chief Alexander Dubcek, the
news agency CTX reported.
They included promises of fur

some of the occupation troops.
A communique on the Presidi
um meeting, which brought to
gether Dubcek and his chief as
sistants, said the Presidium
"approved the procedure of the
Czechoslovak delegation" at the
Moscow talks. This shunted to
one side reports that the party
leadership would rebel against
the harsh Kremlin demands.
Although Czechoslovakia
agreed at last week's talks in
Moscow to a tightening of press
controls and partial return to
Soviet-style communism, the
Presidium emphasizes the party
"must continue all the positive
features" of its popular reform
policies launched last January.
Prague had agreed to con
sider and sign a treaty that
would cloak the occupation with
legality in Moscow talks between
Dubcek and Soviet leaders.
Czechoslovak informants have
said the number of troops to re
main will be at least seven divi

some reports said the number

Their delaying tactics began
at noon and by 9:30 p. m. 18 roll

No arrests were reported and
there were no injuries except

NEW YORK (AP) — Sen. Eu

the Democratic presidential
nomination to Hubert H. Huir

Tuesday night to support the
vice president's campaign.
"The call goes out for party
unity, just as did a year ago,"
McCarthy said. "It was not ac
ceptable then, and it's not any
more acceptable today."
The Minnesota senator spoke
at a $100-a-plate fund-raising
dinner for New York Demo
cratic senatorial nominee Paul
O'Dwyer, a peace candidate
who also has consistently re
fused to support Humphrey.
McCarthy said his efforts to
change the direction of the
Democratic party were not
aimed at getting anybody elect
ed.
But he said he saw "no reason
why the direction of the party
could not be changed with a
presidential candidate this year."
He listed three conditions he
thought should be met to change
the direction: Shifts in Vietnam
war policy, a restructuring of
the draft system and restructur
ing of the party machinery.
McCarthy received a three
minute standing ovation from
the 1,400 persons who packed
the grand ballroom of the New
York Hilton Hotel.
McCarthy reviewed his efforts
over the past year and said that
he began his presidential cam
paign more so "to raise issues
than to save or divide the Dem
ocratic party."
He added, "We did not raise

these issues to gain control. We
did not raise the issues to win
office."
• Political Roundup
Hubert H. Humphrey visited
the House of Representatives
Tuesday and challenged Rich
ard M. Nixon to end a Republi
can filibuster blowing passage
of a bill to permit television de
bates between the presidential
candidates.
The vice president, who has
repeatedly tried to prod his
GOP opponent into a debate,
called on Nixon to end the par
liamentary roadblock, saying
the American people "want to
hear serious talk about the chal
lenges facing the nation."
Earlier in the day, the Demo
cratic presidential candidate
proposed regular annual sum
mit meetings between Soviet
and U.S. leaders. These "infor
mal" meetings, Humphrey said,
would be "free of the publicity,
free of the high expectations
that surround irregular summit
mee Ings."
Campaigning in the Middle
West, Nixon charged that Hum
phrey envisions $50 billion in
added government spending,
and would be "the most expen
sive president in U.S. history."
Speaking in Humphrey's
home town of Minneapolis, Nix
on said he himself supported
lower federal taxes and cuts in
federal spending.
The Republican presidential
nominee switched his bombs to
third party candidate George C.
Wallace before an audience of
5,000 persons in industrial Flint,
Mich.

Nixon urged working men not
to waste their vote on a candi
date who couldn't win, saying,
"Do you just want to get some
thing off your chest or do you
want to get something done."
Wallace was in Boston, visit
ing the historic USS Constitu
tion and the Boston Common,
where he drew one of the largest
crowds of his campaign.
At the Boston Naval Yard he
promised to strengthen the mili
tary, but repeated his belief that
"nuclear war is unthinkable."
Wallace's running mate, re
tired Air Force Gen. Curtis
LeMay, told a news conference
in Los Angeles that he joined
the third party campaign be
cause he feared that Nixon
would pack his cabinet with
left-wingers.
In Miami, Democratic vice

PRAGUE (AP) — A Czecho
slovak government delegation
arrived in Moscow Tuesday
night to negotiate a treaty legal
izing the occupation of their
country by a Soviet-led force of
Warsaw Pact nations, Czecho
slovak sources reported.
Their arrival was confirmed
as the Presidium of the Czecho
slovak Communist party ap
proved commitments made in
Moscow last week by party
chief Alexander Dubcek, the
news agency CTX reported.
They included promises of fur

some of the occupation troops.
A communique on the Presidi
um meeting, which brought to
gether Dubcek and his chief as

"approved the procedure of the
Czechoslovak delegation" at the
Moscow talks. This shunted to
one side reports that the party
leadership would rebel against
the harsh Kremlin demands.
Although Czechoslovakia
agreed at last week's talks in
Moscow to a tightening of press
controls and partial return to
Soviet-style communism, the
Presidium emphasizes the party
"must continue all the positive
features" of its popular reform
policies launched last January.
Prague had agreed to con
sider and sign a treaty that
would cloak the occupation with
legality in Moscow talks between
Dubcek and Soviet leaders.
Czechoslovak informants have
said the number of troops to re
main will be at least seven divi
sions, or about 100,000 men. But
some reports said the number

• Record Roll-Call
WASHINGTON (AP)—Repub

parliamentary vice Tuesday in
an attempt to prevent action on
a bill that would permit tele

The Republicans made repeat

present, forcing an endless
round of roll calls that kept the
House from taking up any bills.
Their delaying tactics began
at noon and by 9:30 p. m. 18 roll
calls had been taken. They tied
up the House despite a personal

visit from Vice President Hu

to loose the jam.
The vice president also issued

No arrests were reported and
there were no injuries except
one fireman overcome by smoke.
Tear gas was used sparingly

• McCarthy Declines
NEW YORK (AP) — Sen. Eu
gene McCarthy, in his first ma

the Democratic presidential
nomination to Hubert H. Huir
phrey in August, declined again
Tuesday night to support the
vice president's campaign.
"The call goes out for party
unity, just as did a year ago,"
McCarthy said. "It was not ac
ceptable then, and it's not any
more acceptable today."
The Minnesota senator spoke
at a $100-a-plate fund-raising
dinner for New York Demo
cratic senatorial nominee Paul
O'Dwyer, a peace candidate
who also has consistently re
fused to support Humphrey.
McCarthy said his efforts to
change the direction of the
Democratic party were not
aimed at getting anybody elect
ed.
But he said he saw "no reason
why the direction of the party
could not be changed with a
presidential candidate this year."
He listed three conditions he
thought should be met to change
the direction: Shifts in Vietnam
war policy, a restructuring of
the draft system and restructur
ing of the party machinery.
McCarthy received a three
minute standing ovation from
the 1,400 persons who packed
the grand ballroom of the New
York Hilton Hotel.
McCarthy reviewed his efforts
over the past year and said that
he began his presidential cam
paign more so "to raise issues
than to save or divide the Dem
ocratic party."
He added, "We did not raise

these issues to gain control. We
did not raise the issues to win
office."
• Political Roundup
Hubert H. Humphrey visited
the House of Representatives
Tuesday and challenged Rich
ard M. Nixon to end a Republi
can filibuster blowing passage
of a bill to permit television de
bates between the presidential
candidates.
The vice president, who has
repeatedly tried to prod his
GOP opponent into a debate,
called on Nixon to end the par
liamentary roadblock, saying
the American people "want to
hear serious talk about the chal
lenges facing the nation."
Earlier in the day, the Demo
cratic presidential candidate
proposed regular annual sum
mit meetings between Soviet
and U.S. leaders. These "infor
mal" meetings, Humphrey said,
would be "free of the publicity,
free of the high expectations
that surround irregular summit
mee Ings."
Campaigning in the Middle
West, Nixon charged that Hum
phrey envisions $50 billion in
added government spending,
and would be "the most expen
sive president in U.S. history."
Speaking in Humphrey's
home town of Minneapolis, Nix
on said he himself supported
lower federal taxes and cuts in
federal spending.
The Republican presidential
nominee switched his bombs to
third party candidate George C.
Wallace before an audience of
5,000 persons in industrial Flint,
Mich.

Nixon urged working men not
to waste their vote on a candi
date who couldn't win, saying,
"Do you just want to get some
thing off your chest or do you
want to get something done."
Wallace was in Boston, visit
ing the historic USS Constitu
tion and the Boston Common,
where he drew one of the largest
crowds of his campaign.
At the Boston Naval Yard he
promised to strengthen the mili
tary, but repeated his belief that
"nuclear war is unthinkable."
Wallace's running mate, re
tired Air Force Gen. Curtis
LeMay, told a news conference
in Los Angeles that he joined
the third party campaign be
cause he feared that Nixon
would pack his cabinet with
left-wingers.
In Miami, Democratic vice
presidential nominee Sen. Ed
mund S. Muskie criticized Wal
lace's choice of a running mate,
saying it was dictated by a
"philosophy of violence and
overkill."
Muskie in turn was criticized
by his GOP counterpart, Mary
land Gov. Spiro T. Agnew, who
criticized the Maine senator's
"approbation for the law break
er." Agnew said Muskie had not
condemned, strongly enough,
three students who burned their
draft cards in his presence.
• Cleaver Speaks
BERKELEY (AP) —Black
Pan 1 her Eldridge Cleaver deliv

series of lectures on racism
Tuesday, speaking courteously
and avoiding the obscenities that
have studded other recent talks.
The 33-year-old ex-convict,
who in the past has applied four
letter words to Gov. Reagan and
university regents who opposed
his selection as a speaker, ad
dressed 400 students in a class
room at the University of Cali
fornia.
He spoke politely and articu
lately, then answered questions.
Cleaver, neatly attired in a
black suit and wearing two
strings of beads, said that where
as the white dress of a bride
symbolizes purity that black is
for funeral, a black beard means
a pirate ,a black cat means bad
luck.

"These negative connotations
of blackness stigmatize the
black man as having evil conno
tations," Cleaver told the nearly
100 enrolled in the course and
more than 300 auditing it for
possible future choice.
Student sponsors of the
course, Social Analysis 139 X,
still hope those taking it will get
credit. But the class began Tues

as a noncredit course in order
that Cleaver can be permitted 10

• Gun Control
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen
ate - House conferees agreed
Tuesday on a bill to prohibit in
terstate mail order sale of all
fiirearms and ammunition.
The compromise measure also
includes a general ban on over
the-counter sale of firearms to
nonresidents of a state and pro
hibits sales of rifles and shot
guns to persons under 18 years
of age. Persons under 21 al
ready are banned from buying
handguns.
Sen. Thomas J. Dodd, D-
Conn., chief Senate sponsor of
the legislation, hailed the com
promise as "a milestone."
The measure supplements a
section of the Omnibus Crime
Control and Safe Streets Act
passed earlier in the year ban
ning interstate mail order sales
of handguns.
It extends this ban to rifles
and shotguns and also covers
sales of all kinds of ammuni
tion.
Besides the prohibition on in
terstate mail order sales, the
bill regulates sales of firearms
by mail within a state by pro
viding for a seven-day waiting
period and the filing of an affi
davit of eligibility by the pur
chaser.
Over-the-counter sales to non
residents would be prohibited
except that a person could buy a
long gun in an adjoining state
if he qualified under the laws
of both states.
The measure would become
effective on Dec. 16, the same
date as the section of the crime
control bill curbing handgun
sales.

WASHINGTON (AP)—Repub
licans locked the House in a
parliamentary vice Tuesday in
an attempt to prevent action on
a bill that would permit tele

The Republicans made repeat
ed demands that a quorum be
present, forcing an endless
round of roll calls that kept the
House from taking up any bills.
Their delaying tactics began
at noon and by 9:30 p. m. 18 roll
calls had been taken. They tied
up the House despite a personal

visit from Vice President Hu

to loose the jam.
The vice president also issued

him to clear the roadblock by
supporting the bill.
• Jaywalker Shot
A white motorcycle policeman
shot and killed an unidentified
Negro man who alllegedly re
sisted arrest for a pedestrian
traffic violation.
In a brief but violent protest
over the fatal shooting, angry
blacks poured onto the main
business street of Washington's
northwest Negro district last
night.
One major fire was reported
and the crowd stoned fiiremen
and broke scores of shop win
dows before a massive show of
force by riot-trained special po

No arrests were reported and
there were no injuries except
one fireman overcome by smoke.
Tear gas was used sparingly
in the section, scene of last
April's riots following the mur

Officers said they used gas to
chase persons off roofs who
were hurling objects to the
streets below.
One incident of looting was re
ported, but officials said the
main damage came from brok
en plate glass windows and the
fire, which gutted an auto parts
firm.

• McCarthy Declines
NEW YORK (AP) — Sen. Eu
gene McCarthy, in his first ma
jor political speech since losing
the Democratic presidential
nomination to Hubert H. Huir
phrey in August, declined again
Tuesday night to support the
vice president's campaign.
"The call goes out for party
unity, just as did a year ago,"
McCarthy said. "It was not ac
ceptable then, and it's not any
more acceptable today."
The Minnesota senator spoke
at a $100-a-plate fund-raising
dinner for New York Demo
cratic senatorial nominee Paul
O'Dwyer, a peace candidate
who also has consistently re
fused to support Humphrey.
McCarthy said his efforts to
change the direction of the
Democratic party were not
aimed at getting anybody elect
ed.
But he said he saw "no reason
why the direction of the party
could not be changed with a
presidential candidate this year."
He listed three conditions he
thought should be met to change
the direction: Shifts in Vietnam
war policy, a restructuring of
the draft system and restructur
ing of the party machinery.
McCarthy received a three
minute standing ovation from
the 1,400 persons who packed
the grand ballroom of the New
York Hilton Hotel.
McCarthy reviewed his efforts
over the past year and said that
he began his presidential cam
paign more so "to raise issues
than to save or divide the Dem
ocratic party."
He added, "We did not raise

these issues to gain control. We
did not raise the issues to win
office."
• Political Roundup
Hubert H. Humphrey visited
the House of Representatives
Tuesday and challenged Rich
ard M. Nixon to end a Republi
can filibuster blowing passage
of a bill to permit television de
bates between the presidential
candidates.
The vice president, who has
repeatedly tried to prod his
GOP opponent into a debate,
called on Nixon to end the par
liamentary roadblock, saying
the American people "want to
hear serious talk about the chal
lenges facing the nation."
Earlier in the day, the Demo
cratic presidential candidate
proposed regular annual sum
mit meetings between Soviet
and U.S. leaders. These "infor
mal" meetings, Humphrey said,
would be "free of the publicity,
free of the high expectations
that surround irregular summit
mee Ings."
Campaigning in the Middle
West, Nixon charged that Hum
phrey envisions $50 billion in
added government spending,
and would be "the most expen
sive president in U.S. history."
Speaking in Humphrey's
home town of Minneapolis, Nix
on said he himself supported
lower federal taxes and cuts in
federal spending.
The Republican presidential
nominee switched his bombs to
third party candidate George C.
Wallace before an audience of
5,000 persons in industrial Flint,
Mich.

Nixon urged working men not
to waste their vote on a candi
date who couldn't win, saying,
"Do you just want to get some
thing off your chest or do you
want to get something done."
Wallace was in Boston, visit
ing the historic USS Constitu
tion and the Boston Common,
where he drew one of the largest
crowds of his campaign.
At the Boston Naval Yard he
promised to strengthen the mili
tary, but repeated his belief that
"nuclear war is unthinkable."
Wallace's running mate, re
tired Air Force Gen. Curtis
LeMay, told a news conference
in Los Angeles that he joined
the third party campaign be
cause he feared that Nixon
would pack his cabinet with
left-wingers.
In Miami, Democratic vice
presidential nominee Sen. Ed
mund S. Muskie criticized Wal
lace's choice of a running mate,
saying it was dictated by a
"philosophy of violence and
overkill."
Muskie in turn was criticized
by his GOP counterpart, Mary
land Gov. Spiro T. Agnew, who
criticized the Maine senator's
"approbation for the law break
er." Agnew said Muskie had not
condemned, strongly enough,
three students who burned their
draft cards in his presence.
• Cleaver Speaks
BERKELEY (AP) —Black
Pan 1 her Eldridge Cleaver deliv
ered the first of a much-opposed
series of lectures on racism
Tuesday, speaking courteously
and avoiding the obscenities that
have studded other recent talks.
The 33-year-old ex-convict,
who in the past has applied four
letter words to Gov. Reagan and
university regents who opposed
his selection as a speaker, ad
dressed 400 students in a class
room at the University of Cali
fornia.
He spoke politely and articu
lately, then answered questions.
Cleaver, neatly attired in a
black suit and wearing two
strings of beads, said that where
as the white dress of a bride
symbolizes purity that black is
for funeral, a black beard means
a pirate ,a black cat means bad
luck.

"These negative connotations
of blackness stigmatize the
black man as having evil conno
tations," Cleaver told the nearly
100 enrolled in the course and
more than 300 auditing it for
possible future choice.
Student sponsors of the
course, Social Analysis 139 X,
still hope those taking it will get
credit. But the class began Tues
day in Room 155, Dwinelle Hall,
as a noncredit course in order
that Cleaver can be permitted 10
lectures.
• Gun Control
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen
ate - House conferees agreed
Tuesday on a bill to prohibit in
terstate mail order sale of all
fiirearms and ammunition.
The compromise measure also
includes a general ban on over
the-counter sale of firearms to
nonresidents of a state and pro
hibits sales of rifles and shot
guns to persons under 18 years
of age. Persons under 21 al
ready are banned from buying
handguns.
Sen. Thomas J. Dodd, D-
Conn., chief Senate sponsor of
the legislation, hailed the com
promise as "a milestone."
The measure supplements a
section of the Omnibus Crime
Control and Safe Streets Act
passed earlier in the year ban
ning interstate mail order sales
of handguns.
It extends this ban to rifles
and shotguns and also covers
sales of all kinds of ammuni
tion.
Besides the prohibition on in
terstate mail order sales, the
bill regulates sales of firearms
by mail within a state by pro
viding for a seven-day waiting
period and the filing of an affi
davit of eligibility by the pur
chaser.
Over-the-counter sales to non
residents would be prohibited
except that a person could buy a
long gun in an adjoining state
if he qualified under the laws
of both states.
The measure would become
effective on Dec. 16, the same
date as the section of the crime
control bill curbing handgun
sales.

PRAGUE (AP) — A Czecho
slovak government delegation
arrived in Moscow Tuesday
night to negotiate a treaty legal
izing the occupation of their
country by a Soviet-led force of
Warsaw Pact nations, Czecho
slovak sources reported.
Their arrival was confirmed
as the Presidium of the Czecho
slovak Communist party ap
proved commitments made in
Moscow last week by party
chief Alexander Dubcek, the
news agency CTX reported.
They included promises of fur
ther limitations on Dubcek's lib

some of the occupation troops.
A communique on the Presidi
um meeting, which brought to
gether Dubcek and his chief as
sistants, said the Presidium
"approved the procedure of the
Czechoslovak delegation" at the
Moscow talks. This shunted to
one side reports that the party
leadership would rebel against
the harsh Kremlin demands.
Although Czechoslovakia
agreed at last week's talks in
Moscow to a tightening of press
controls and partial return to
Soviet-style communism, the
Presidium emphasizes the party
"must continue all the positive
features" of its popular reform
policies launched last January.
Prague had agreed to con
sider and sign a treaty that
would cloak the occupation with
legality in Moscow talks between
Dubcek and Soviet leaders.
Czechoslovak informants have
said the number of troops to re

some reports said the number

• Political Roundup
Hubert H. Humphrey visited
the House of Representatives
Tuesday and challenged Rich
ard M. Nixon to end a Republi
can filibuster blowing passage
of a bill to permit television de
bates between the presidential
candidates.
The vice president, who has
repeatedly tried to prod his
GOP opponent into a debate,
called on Nixon to end the par
liamentary roadblock, saying
the American people "want to
hear serious talk about the chal
lenges facing the nation."
Earlier in the day, the Demo
cratic presidential candidate
proposed regular annual sum
mit meetings between Soviet
and U.S. leaders. These "infor
mal" meetings, Humphrey said,
would be "free of the publicity,
free of the high expectations
that surround irregular summit
mee Ings."
Campaigning in the Middle
West, Nixon charged that Hum
phrey envisions $50 billion in
added government spending,
and would be "the most expen
sive president in U.S. history."
Speaking in Humphrey's
home town of Minneapolis, Nix
on said he himself supported
lower federal taxes and cuts in
federal spending.
The Republican presidential
nominee switched his bombs to
third party candidate George C.
Wallace before an audience of
5,000 persons in industrial Flint,
Mich.

Nixon urged working men not
to waste their vote on a candi
date who couldn't win, saying,
"Do you just want to get some
thing off your chest or do you
want to get something done."
Wallace was in Boston, visit
ing the historic USS Constitu
tion and the Boston Common,
where he drew one of the largest
crowds of his campaign.
At the Boston Naval Yard he
promised to strengthen the mili
tary, but repeated his belief that
"nuclear war is unthinkable."
Wallace's running mate, re
tired Air Force Gen. Curtis
LeMay, told a news conference
in Los Angeles that he joined
the third party campaign be
cause he feared that Nixon
would pack his cabinet with
left-wingers.
In Miami, Democratic vice
presidential nominee Sen. Ed
mund S. Muskie criticized Wal
lace's choice of a running mate,
saying it was dictated by a
"philosophy of violence and
overkill."
Muskie in turn was criticized
by his GOP counterpart, Mary
land Gov. Spiro T. Agnew, who
criticized the Maine senator's
"approbation for the law break
er." Agnew said Muskie had not
condemned, strongly enough,
three students who burned their
draft cards in his presence.

Tuesday, speaking courteously

The 33-year-old ex-convict,
who in the past has applied four
letter words to Gov. Reagan and
university regents who opposed
his selection as a speaker, ad
dressed 400 students in a class
room at the University of Cali

Cleaver, neatly attired in a

as the white dress of a bride
symbolizes purity that black is
for funeral, a black beard means
a pirate ,a black cat means bad
luck.

"These negative connotations
of blackness stigmatize the
black man as having evil conno

100 enrolled in the course and
more than 300 auditing it for
possible future choice.
Student sponsors of the

• Gun Control
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen
ate - House conferees agreed
Tuesday on a bill to prohibit in
terstate mail order sale of all
fiirearms and ammunition.
The compromise measure also
includes a general ban on over
the-counter sale of firearms to
nonresidents of a state and pro
hibits sales of rifles and shot
guns to persons under 18 years
of age. Persons under 21 al
ready are banned from buying
handguns.
Sen. Thomas J. Dodd, D-
Conn., chief Senate sponsor of
the legislation, hailed the com
promise as "a milestone."
The measure supplements a
section of the Omnibus Crime
Control and Safe Streets Act
passed earlier in the year ban
ning interstate mail order sales
of handguns.
It extends this ban to rifles
and shotguns and also covers
sales of all kinds of ammuni
tion.
Besides the prohibition on in
terstate mail order sales, the
bill regulates sales of firearms
by mail within a state by pro
viding for a seven-day waiting
period and the filing of an affi
davit of eligibility by the pur
chaser.
Over-the-counter sales to non
residents would be prohibited
except that a person could buy a
long gun in an adjoining state
if he qualified under the laws
of both states.
The measure would become
effective on Dec. 16, the same
date as the section of the crime

PRAGUE (AP) — A Czecho

arrived in Moscow Tuesday
night to negotiate a treaty legal

country by a Soviet-led force of
Warsaw Pact nations, Czecho
slovak sources reported.
Their arrival was confirmed
as the Presidium of the Czecho

Moscow last week by party
chief Alexander Dubcek, the
news agency CTX reported.
They included promises of fur

some of the occupation troops.
A communique on the Presidi

gether Dubcek and his chief as

"approved the procedure of the
Czechoslovak delegation" at the
Moscow talks. This shunted to
one side reports that the party
leadership would rebel against
the harsh Kremlin demands.
Although Czechoslovakia
agreed at last week's talks in
Moscow to a tightening of press
controls and partial return to
Soviet-style communism, the
Presidium emphasizes the party
"must continue all the positive
features" of its popular reform
policies launched last January.
Prague had agreed to con
sider and sign a treaty that
would cloak the occupation with
legality in Moscow talks between
Dubcek and Soviet leaders.
Czechoslovak informants have
said the number of troops to re

some reports said the number

• Gun Control
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen
ate - House conferees agreed
Tuesday on a bill to prohibit in
terstate mail order sale of all
fiirearms and ammunition.
The compromise measure also
includes a general ban on over
the-counter sale of firearms to
nonresidents of a state and pro
hibits sales of rifles and shot
guns to persons under 18 years
of age. Persons under 21 al
ready are banned from buying
handguns.
Sen. Thomas J. Dodd, D-
Conn., chief Senate sponsor of
the legislation, hailed the com
promise as "a milestone."
The measure supplements a
section of the Omnibus Crime
Control and Safe Streets Act
passed earlier in the year ban
ning interstate mail order sales
of handguns.
It extends this ban to rifles
and shotguns and also covers
sales of all kinds of ammuni
tion.
Besides the prohibition on in
terstate mail order sales, the
bill regulates sales of firearms
by mail within a state by pro
viding for a seven-day waiting
period and the filing of an affi
davit of eligibility by the pur
chaser.
Over-the-counter sales to non
residents would be prohibited
except that a person could buy a
long gun in an adjoining state
if he qualified under the laws
of both states.
The measure would become
effective on Dec. 16, the same

PRAGUE (AP) — A Czecho
slovak government delegation
arrived in Moscow Tuesday
night to negotiate a treaty legal
izing the occupation of their
country by a Soviet-led force of
Warsaw Pact nations, Czecho
slovak sources reported.
Their arrival was confirmed
as the Presidium of the Czecho
slovak Communist party ap
proved commitments made in
Moscow last week by party
chief Alexander Dubcek, the
news agency CTX reported.
They included promises of fur
ther limitations on Dubcek's lib

some of the occupation troops.
A communique on the Presidi
um meeting, which brought to
gether Dubcek and his chief as
sistants, said the Presidium
"approved the procedure of the
Czechoslovak delegation" at the
Moscow talks. This shunted to
one side reports that the party
leadership would rebel against
the harsh Kremlin demands.
Although Czechoslovakia
agreed at last week's talks in
Moscow to a tightening of press
controls and partial return to
Soviet-style communism, the
Presidium emphasizes the party
"must continue all the positive
features" of its popular reform
policies launched last January.
Prague had agreed to con
sider and sign a treaty that
would cloak the occupation with
legality in Moscow talks between
Dubcek and Soviet leaders.
Czechoslovak informants have
said the number of troops to re
main will be at least seven divi
sions, or about 100,000 men. But
some reports said the number

• Record Roll-Call
WASHINGTON (AP)—Repub

an attempt to prevent action on
a bill that would permit tele

The Republicans made repeat

present, forcing an endless
round of roll calls that kept the
House from taking up any bills.
Their delaying tactics began
at noon and by 9:30 p. m. 18 roll
calls had been taken. They tied
up the House despite a personal

visit from Vice President Hu

to loose the jam.
The vice president also issued
a strong call to Republican can

him to clear the roadblock by
supporting the bill.

One major fire was reported
and the crowd stoned fiiremen

No arrests were reported and
there were no injuries except
one fireman overcome by smoke.
Tear gas was used sparingly
in the section, scene of last

Officers said they used gas to

• McCarthy Declines
NEW YORK (AP) — Sen. Eu
gene McCarthy, in his first ma

the Democratic presidential
nomination to Hubert H. Huir

Tuesday night to support the
vice president's campaign.
"The call goes out for party
unity, just as did a year ago,"
McCarthy said. "It was not ac
ceptable then, and it's not any
more acceptable today."
The Minnesota senator spoke
at a $100-a-plate fund-raising
dinner for New York Demo
cratic senatorial nominee Paul
O'Dwyer, a peace candidate
who also has consistently re
fused to support Humphrey.
McCarthy said his efforts to
change the direction of the
Democratic party were not
aimed at getting anybody elect
ed.
But he said he saw "no reason
why the direction of the party
could not be changed with a
presidential candidate this year."
He listed three conditions he
thought should be met to change
the direction: Shifts in Vietnam
war policy, a restructuring of
the draft system and restructur
ing of the party machinery.
McCarthy received a three
minute standing ovation from
the 1,400 persons who packed
the grand ballroom of the New
York Hilton Hotel.
McCarthy reviewed his efforts
over the past year and said that
he began his presidential cam
paign more so "to raise issues
than to save or divide the Dem
ocratic party."
He added, "We did not raise

these issues to gain control. We
did not raise the issues to win
office."
• Political Roundup
Hubert H. Humphrey visited
the House of Representatives
Tuesday and challenged Rich
ard M. Nixon to end a Republi
can filibuster blowing passage
of a bill to permit television de
bates between the presidential
candidates.
The vice president, who has
repeatedly tried to prod his
GOP opponent into a debate,
called on Nixon to end the par
liamentary roadblock, saying
the American people "want to
hear serious talk about the chal
lenges facing the nation."
Earlier in the day, the Demo
cratic presidential candidate
proposed regular annual sum
mit meetings between Soviet
and U.S. leaders. These "infor
mal" meetings, Humphrey said,
would be "free of the publicity,
free of the high expectations
that surround irregular summit
mee Ings."
Campaigning in the Middle
West, Nixon charged that Hum
phrey envisions $50 billion in
added government spending,
and would be "the most expen
sive president in U.S. history."
Speaking in Humphrey's
home town of Minneapolis, Nix
on said he himself supported
lower federal taxes and cuts in
federal spending.
The Republican presidential
nominee switched his bombs to
third party candidate George C.
Wallace before an audience of
5,000 persons in industrial Flint,
Mich.

Nixon urged working men not
to waste their vote on a candi
date who couldn't win, saying,
"Do you just want to get some
thing off your chest or do you
want to get something done."
Wallace was in Boston, visit
ing the historic USS Constitu
tion and the Boston Common,
where he drew one of the largest
crowds of his campaign.
At the Boston Naval Yard he
promised to strengthen the mili
tary, but repeated his belief that
"nuclear war is unthinkable."
Wallace's running mate, re
tired Air Force Gen. Curtis
LeMay, told a news conference
in Los Angeles that he joined
the third party campaign be
cause he feared that Nixon
would pack his cabinet with
left-wingers.
In Miami, Democratic vice
presidential nominee Sen. Ed
mund S. Muskie criticized Wal
lace's choice of a running mate,
saying it was dictated by a
"philosophy of violence and
overkill."
Muskie in turn was criticized
by his GOP counterpart, Mary
land Gov. Spiro T. Agnew, who
criticized the Maine senator's
"approbation for the law break
er." Agnew said Muskie had not
condemned, strongly enough,
three students who burned their
draft cards in his presence.

• Czech Delegation
PRAGUE (AP) — A Czecho
slovak government delegation
arrived in Moscow Tuesday
night to negotiate a treaty legal
izing the occupation of their
country by a Soviet-led force of
Warsaw Pact nations, Czecho
slovak sources reported.
Their arrival was confirmed
as the Presidium of the Czecho
slovak Communist party ap
proved commitments made in
Moscow last week by party
chief Alexander Dubcek, the
news agency CTX reported.
They included promises of fur
ther limitations on Dubcek's lib
eral reform program and agree
ment on the continued stay of
some of the occupation troops.
A communique on the Presidi
um meeting, which brought to
gether Dubcek and his chief as
sistants, said the Presidium
"approved the procedure of the
Czechoslovak delegation" at the
Moscow talks. This shunted to
one side reports that the party
leadership would rebel against
the harsh Kremlin demands.
Although Czechoslovakia
agreed at last week's talks in
Moscow to a tightening of press
controls and partial return to
Soviet-style communism, the
Presidium emphasizes the party
"must continue all the positive
features" of its popular reform
policies launched last January.
Prague had agreed to con
sider and sign a treaty that
would cloak the occupation with
legality in Moscow talks between
Dubcek and Soviet leaders.
Czechoslovak informants have
said the number of troops to re
main will be at least seven divi
sions, or about 100,000 men. But
some reports said the number
staying is still up for negotia
tions and the Russians may in
sist on more.
• Record Roll-Call
WASHINGTON (AP)—Repub
licans locked the House in a
parliamentary vice Tuesday in
an attempt to prevent action on
a bill that would permit tele
vised debates between the ma
jor presidential condidates.
The Republicans made repeat
ed demands that a quorum be
present, forcing an endless
round of roll calls that kept the
House from taking up any bills.
Their delaying tactics began
at noon and by 9:30 p. m. 18 roll
calls had been taken. They tied
up the House despite a personal

visit from Vice President Hu
bert H. Humphrey in an effort
to loose the jam.
The vice president also issued
a strong call to Republican can
didate Richard M. Nixon, urging
him to clear the roadblock by
supporting the bill.
• Jaywalker Shot
A white motorcycle policeman
shot and killed an unidentified
Negro man who alllegedly re
sisted arrest for a pedestrian
traffic violation.
In a brief but violent protest
over the fatal shooting, angry
blacks poured onto the main
business street of Washington's
northwest Negro district last
night.
One major fire was reported
and the crowd stoned fiiremen
and broke scores of shop win
dows before a massive show of
force by riot-trained special po
lice units brought calm.
No arrests were reported and
there were no injuries except
one fireman overcome by smoke.
Tear gas was used sparingly
in the section, scene of last
April's riots following the mur
der of Dr. Martin Luther King.
Officers said they used gas to
chase persons off roofs who
were hurling objects to the
streets below.
One incident of looting was re
ported, but officials said the
main damage came from brok
en plate glass windows and the
fire, which gutted an auto parts
firm.
• ROTC Remains
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
Confronting about 500 students,
many of them booing him, Presi

cisco State College declared on
Tuesday that an Air Force
ROTC unit would remain on the
campus.
Smith, flanked by security
guards, said it was up to the
faculty to suggest any change
in course curriculum, and that
students are represented on fac
ulty groups.
His talk was promoted by a
rally a few minutes earlier in
which the campus Students for
a Democratic Society chapter de
manded that Smith state his po
sition on the ROTC issue within
a week.

• McCarthy Declines
NEW YORK (AP) — Sen. Eu
gene McCarthy, in his first ma
jor political speech since losing
the Democratic presidential
nomination to Hubert H. Huir
phrey in August, declined again
Tuesday night to support the
vice president's campaign.
"The call goes out for party
unity, just as did a year ago,"
McCarthy said. "It was not ac
ceptable then, and it's not any
more acceptable today."
The Minnesota senator spoke
at a $100-a-plate fund-raising
dinner for New York Demo
cratic senatorial nominee Paul
O'Dwyer, a peace candidate
who also has consistently re
fused to support Humphrey.
McCarthy said his efforts to
change the direction of the
Democratic party were not
aimed at getting anybody elect
ed.
But he said he saw "no reason
why the direction of the party
could not be changed with a
presidential candidate this year."
He listed three conditions he
thought should be met to change
the direction: Shifts in Vietnam
war policy, a restructuring of
the draft system and restructur
ing of the party machinery.
McCarthy received a three
minute standing ovation from
the 1,400 persons who packed
the grand ballroom of the New
York Hilton Hotel.
McCarthy reviewed his efforts
over the past year and said that
he began his presidential cam
paign more so "to raise issues
than to save or divide the Dem
ocratic party."
He added, "We did not raise

these issues to gain control. We
did not raise the issues to win
office."
• Political Roundup
Hubert H. Humphrey visited
the House of Representatives
Tuesday and challenged Rich
ard M. Nixon to end a Republi
can filibuster blowing passage
of a bill to permit television de
bates between the presidential
candidates.
The vice president, who has
repeatedly tried to prod his
GOP opponent into a debate,
called on Nixon to end the par
liamentary roadblock, saying
the American people "want to
hear serious talk about the chal
lenges facing the nation."
Earlier in the day, the Demo
cratic presidential candidate
proposed regular annual sum
mit meetings between Soviet
and U.S. leaders. These "infor
mal" meetings, Humphrey said,
would be "free of the publicity,
free of the high expectations
that surround irregular summit
mee Ings."
Campaigning in the Middle
West, Nixon charged that Hum
phrey envisions $50 billion in
added government spending,
and would be "the most expen
sive president in U.S. history."
Speaking in Humphrey's
home town of Minneapolis, Nix
on said he himself supported
lower federal taxes and cuts in
federal spending.
The Republican presidential
nominee switched his bombs to
third party candidate George C.
Wallace before an audience of
5,000 persons in industrial Flint,
Mich.

Nixon urged working men not
to waste their vote on a candi
date who couldn't win, saying,
"Do you just want to get some
thing off your chest or do you
want to get something done."
Wallace was in Boston, visit
ing the historic USS Constitu
tion and the Boston Common,
where he drew one of the largest
crowds of his campaign.
At the Boston Naval Yard he
promised to strengthen the mili
tary, but repeated his belief that
"nuclear war is unthinkable."
Wallace's running mate, re
tired Air Force Gen. Curtis
LeMay, told a news conference
in Los Angeles that he joined
the third party campaign be
cause he feared that Nixon
would pack his cabinet with
left-wingers.
In Miami, Democratic vice
presidential nominee Sen. Ed
mund S. Muskie criticized Wal
lace's choice of a running mate,
saying it was dictated by a
"philosophy of violence and
overkill."
Muskie in turn was criticized
by his GOP counterpart, Mary
land Gov. Spiro T. Agnew, who
criticized the Maine senator's
"approbation for the law break
er." Agnew said Muskie had not
condemned, strongly enough,
three students who burned their
draft cards in his presence.
• Cleaver Speaks
BERKELEY (AP) —Black
Pan 1 her Eldridge Cleaver deliv
ered the first of a much-opposed
series of lectures on racism
Tuesday, speaking courteously
and avoiding the obscenities that
have studded other recent talks.
The 33-year-old ex-convict,
who in the past has applied four
letter words to Gov. Reagan and
university regents who opposed
his selection as a speaker, ad
dressed 400 students in a class
room at the University of Cali
fornia.
He spoke politely and articu
lately, then answered questions.
Cleaver, neatly attired in a
black suit and wearing two
strings of beads, said that where
as the white dress of a bride
symbolizes purity that black is
for funeral, a black beard means
a pirate ,a black cat means bad
luck.

"These negative connotations
of blackness stigmatize the
black man as having evil conno
tations," Cleaver told the nearly
100 enrolled in the course and
more than 300 auditing it for
possible future choice.
Student sponsors of the
course, Social Analysis 139 X,
still hope those taking it will get
credit. But the class began Tues
day in Room 155, Dwinelle Hall,
as a noncredit course in order
that Cleaver can be permitted 10
lectures.
• Gun Control
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen
ate - House conferees agreed
Tuesday on a bill to prohibit in
terstate mail order sale of all
fiirearms and ammunition.
The compromise measure also
includes a general ban on over
the-counter sale of firearms to
nonresidents of a state and pro
hibits sales of rifles and shot
guns to persons under 18 years
of age. Persons under 21 al
ready are banned from buying
handguns.
Sen. Thomas J. Dodd, D-
Conn., chief Senate sponsor of
the legislation, hailed the com
promise as "a milestone."
The measure supplements a
section of the Omnibus Crime
Control and Safe Streets Act
passed earlier in the year ban
ning interstate mail order sales
of handguns.
It extends this ban to rifles
and shotguns and also covers
sales of all kinds of ammuni
tion.
Besides the prohibition on in
terstate mail order sales, the
bill regulates sales of firearms
by mail within a state by pro
viding for a seven-day waiting
period and the filing of an affi
davit of eligibility by the pur
chaser.
Over-the-counter sales to non
residents would be prohibited
except that a person could buy a
long gun in an adjoining state
if he qualified under the laws
of both states.
The measure would become
effective on Dec. 16, the same
date as the section of the crime
control bill curbing handgun
sales.

• Student Convicted
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A
theological student was convict
ed Tuesday of willfully refusing
military induction. Henry Duval
Gregory IV, 25, could receive a
maximum five-year prison term
and a $10,000 fine.
Gregory, a University of Vir
ginia graduate, was called for
induction by his Roanoke, Va.,
draft board after he turned in
his draft card in a demonstra
tion outside the San Francisco
federal building.
U.S. Dist. Judge Stanley Wei
gel handed down his verdict
without leaving the bench after
rejecting as irrelevant testimony
from two foes of the Vietnam
war.
On the stand Monday, the
Presbyterian student of San
Francisco Theological Seminary
at San Anselmo said accepting
deferment as a clergy student
would have for him been an act
of hypocrisy.
Judge Weigel Tuesday de
clared the testimony of Dr. Rob
ert McAfee Brown, Stanford
University religion professor, ir
relevant ,and on government ob
jection refused to let J. B. Nie
lands, University of California
biochemist, testify at all.
Brown had testified on the be
liefs of draft resisters acting
through conscience. Nielands
wanted to tell his view of Amer
ican military operations in Viet
nam, where he had visited the
north last year.
Weigel told defense counsel
Aubrey Grossman, "We are not
here to argue the merits of the
war in Vietnam. The question
simply is, did the young man
refuse induction violate the law
and know its consequences?"
