# 5 Of 7 Starters Lost
## Water Poloists Cast As Underdogs Daily SPORTS 
### 
Last year's Stanford varsity
water polo team had the great
distinction of being rated second
in the nation and still not win
ning the conference. This season,
defending national champs
UCLA will again be rated on top,
but the Indians will be hard
pressed to stay close to the lead
ers.
Stanford will be missing five
of last year's starting seven, and
must be cast in the role of un
derdog in nearly every game this
season. The proven scoring abil
ity of such Olympic-bound stars
as Gary Sheerer, John Parker,
and Greg Buckingham will be
difficult to replace. Coach Jim
Gaughran will be going with

four returning lettermen, some
outstanding sophomores, and a
lot of hope in the upcoming cam
paign.
Coach Gaughran has already
seen some basis for that hope
as the varsity started out the
season with a convincing win
over a strong Alumni team, beat
ing them, 14-5.
Opener
League competition for the
varsity begins Friday at 3 p.m.
with a home encounter against
California. Outstanding Stan
ford swimmer Dick Roth who
made his debut as a polo player
against the Alums and scored
four goals will be counted on
heavily. Wayne Wilson will be

back in the pool after a year
off, and is expected to help take
up the scoring slack.
All the new faces make pre
dicting a season finish almost
impossible. Although the Cards
have been rated first or second
nationally in every year since
1963, their unknown potential
for this season makes them the
longshot in the conference race.
In the Pacific Eight, only four
schools play water polo. UCLA
is the unanimous choice to win
all the league and national hon
ors again. According to Coach
Gaughran, California should be
second choice in the conference,
followed by USC and Stanford.
The varsity also faces nation
ally ranked teams such as UC
Irvine and San Jose State in
non-league play.
Even though the future of the
varsity is cloudy, the Stanford
Frosh squad are certain to be
winners. "They could give the
varsity a rough game," com
mented Gaughran.
Led by last year's CIF Player
of the Year at Fullerton High
School, Rick Massimino, the
Frosh murdered San Jose City
College last week, 21-6. "Massi
mino could be one of the all
time greats," Gaughran re
marked. Pete Gadd played an
outstanding game in the goal.
The freshman also play Califor
nia on Friday at home.

as the varsity started out the
season with a convincing win
over a strong Alumni team, beat
ing them, 14-5.
Opener
League competition for the
varsity begins Friday at 3 p.m.
with a home encounter against
California. Outstanding Stan
ford swimmer Dick Roth who
made his debut as a polo player
against the Alums and scored
four goals will be counted on
heavily. Wayne Wilson will be

back in the pool after a year
off, and is expected to help take
up the scoring slack.
All the new faces make pre
dicting a season finish almost
impossible. Although the Cards
have been rated first or second
nationally in every year since
1963, their unknown potential
for this season makes them the
longshot in the conference race.
In the Pacific Eight, only four
schools play water polo. UCLA
is the unanimous choice to win
all the league and national hon
ors again. According to Coach
Gaughran, California should be
second choice in the conference,
followed by USC and Stanford.
The varsity also faces nation
ally ranked teams such as UC
Irvine and San Jose State in
non-league play.
Even though the future of the
varsity is cloudy, the Stanford
Frosh squad are certain to be
winners. "They could give the
varsity a rough game," com
mented Gaughran.
Led by last year's CIF Player
of the Year at Fullerton High
School, Rick Massimino, the
Frosh murdered San Jose City
College last week, 21-6. "Massi
mino could be one of the all
time greats," Gaughran re
marked. Pete Gadd played an
outstanding game in the goal.
The freshman also play Califor
nia on Friday at home.
Last year's Stanford varsity
water polo team had the great
distinction of being rated second
in the nation and still not win
ning the conference. This season,
defending national champs
UCLA will again be rated on top,
but the Indians will be hard
pressed to stay close to the lead
ers.
Stanford will be missing five
of last year's starting seven, and
must be cast in the role of un
derdog in nearly every game this
season. The proven scoring abil
ity of such Olympic-bound stars
as Gary Sheerer, John Parker,
and Greg Buckingham will be
difficult to replace. Coach Jim
Gaughran will be going with

four returning lettermen, some
outstanding sophomores, and a
lot of hope in the upcoming cam
paign.
Coach Gaughran has already
seen some basis for that hope
as the varsity started out the
season with a convincing win
over a strong Alumni team, beat
ing them, 14-5.
