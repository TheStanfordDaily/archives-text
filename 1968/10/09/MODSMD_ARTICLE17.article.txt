# Stanford Aquatic Stars Bolster Olympic Team
## 
### 
Two members of last year's number two ranked water polo
team and six Stanford swimmers will be competing in the
Olympic Gamrs in Mexico City. They are:
Greg Bucking-ham ('6B) — Greg, one of the prime forces in
our 1967 NCAA Championship victory, made the Team
in two events — the 200 and 400 individual medleys. He
was a close second in the Trials to Charlie Hickcox and
5.3 seconds under the former World and Olympic record.
Mike Wall C6B) — Mike made the team on the basis of his
high placing in the Trials in both the 400 meters and
1500 meters freestyle. In placing fourth in the 1500,
Mike was 18 seconds under the Olympic record set in
1964.
John Ferris C7l) — One of three Stanford sophomores to
make the Olympic Team in swimming, made it in botl?
the 200 Individual medley and the 20C butterfly whore
he was just touched out in the last stroke by Mark Spitz.
Mitch Ivey C7l) — Mitch placed a close second in the 200
backstroke, only 8/100 of a second behind the winner,
and will be a real threat for a gold medal.
Brent Berk ('7l) — Brent provided one of the big surprises
of the Olympic Trials in placing a very close second
behind Mike Burton in the 400 freestyle. His great per
formance (he placed 4th in the 200 free as well) is a
big boost to Stanford's swimming future, since the
departure of Mike Wall left a big void in our distance
events.
Gary Sheerer C6B) — Gary, who is Stanford's all-time best
water polo was one of the most obvious choices
to make the final 11-man cut for the Olympic squad.
He's one of the real leaders of the team, and ranks
with the world's top players.
John Parker C6B) — Although John didn't make the final Pan
American Games Water Polo Team last year, his hard
work and determination, and his fierce defensive play
during the last year have moved him into a starting
role on the Olympic Team.
Nocolao C 69) — Luis will be swimming for his native
Argentine Olympic Team in the Games, and will be
swimming at least the 100 butterfly, 100 freestyle, and
all three relays.

Brent Berk ('7l) — Brent provided one of the big surprises
of the Olympic Trials in placing a very close second
behind Mike Burton in the 400 freestyle. His great per
formance (he placed 4th in the 200 free as well) is a
big boost to Stanford's swimming future, since the
departure of Mike Wall left a big void in our distance
events.
Gary Sheerer C6B) — Gary, who is Stanford's all-time best
water polo was one of the most obvious choices
to make the final 11-man cut for the Olympic squad.
He's one of the real leaders of the team, and ranks
with the world's top players.
John Parker C6B) — Although John didn't make the final Pan
American Games Water Polo Team last year, his hard
work and determination, and his fierce defensive play
during the last year have moved him into a starting
role on the Olympic Team.
Nocolao C 69) — Luis will be swimming for his native
Argentine Olympic Team in the Games, and will be
swimming at least the 100 butterfly, 100 freestyle, and
all three relays.
Two members of last year's number two ranked water polo
team and six Stanford swimmers will be competing in the
Olympic Gamrs in Mexico City. They are:
Greg Bucking-ham ('6B) — Greg, one of the prime forces in
our 1967 NCAA Championship victory, made the Team
in two events — the 200 and 400 individual medleys. He
was a close second in the Trials to Charlie Hickcox and
5.3 seconds under the former World and Olympic record.
Mike Wall C6B) — Mike made the team on the basis of his
high placing in the Trials in both the 400 meters and
1500 meters freestyle. In placing fourth in the 1500,
Mike was 18 seconds under the Olympic record set in
1964.
John Ferris C7l) — One of three Stanford sophomores to
make the Olympic Team in swimming, made it in botl?
the 200 Individual medley and the 20C butterfly whore
he was just touched out in the last stroke by Mark Spitz.
Mitch Ivey C7l) — Mitch placed a close second in the 200
backstroke, only 8/100 of a second behind the winner,
and will be a real threat for a gold medal.
Brent Berk ('7l) — Brent provided one of the big surprises
of the Olympic Trials in placing a very close second
