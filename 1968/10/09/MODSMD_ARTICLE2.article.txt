# Educational Study Nears Completion
## 
### 
Later this fall the results of a long-awaited study and revalua
tion of campus academic life undertaken more than a year and a
half ago will be released as the official findings and recommenda
tions of an organization known as the Study of Education at Stan
ford (SES).
The SES while, at work for some twenty months, actually can be
traced back several years. But in spite of this period of existence,
confusion has been the organization's constant companion.
In truth the program is headed by Vice Provost Herbert Packer,
and is directed by a small group of faculty and students known as
the Steering Committee, of which Packer is chairman.
The program was originally conceived in 1965 when President
Wallace Sterling suggested Stanford could stand a careful re-exam
ination of all its educational processes.
Ten years earlier, the university had run a study of undergradu
ate education which resulted, among other things, in the adoption
of the present General Studies program.
Planning Committee
Two years ago, the President established a faculty-student group
called the Planning Committee for the Study of Stanford's Educa
tional Program. This group concluded its work in early December
by suggesting that a broad, two-year study be conducted.
While this group was meeting, student demands for educational
reform began to grow, led by David Harris, student body president,
who was also a member of this Planning Committee.
In the fall of 1966, the President established a faculty-student
group called the Planning Committee for the Study of Stanford's
Educational Program. This group concluded its work in early De
cember by suggesting that a broad, two-year study be conducted.
In January 1967 Herbert Packer, who had recently been appointed
Vice Provost for Academic Planning and Programs, was named by
President Sterling to be Chairman of the Steering Committee.
Steering Committee
In the following weeks, the other member of the committee were
selected, a total of six faculty and three students. The method for
selecting student members generated a controversy that left the
Study with a good deal of student enmity as it began its work.
