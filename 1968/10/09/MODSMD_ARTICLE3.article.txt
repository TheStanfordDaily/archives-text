# SDS Nails Demand On Trustees' Door
## 
### EILEEN HALEY 
Hammering their resolutions onto the Board of Trustees campus
office door, Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) demanded that
Stanford, Stanford Research Institute, and "all members of the
University community immediately halt all military and economic
projects and operations concerned with Southeast Asia."
The action followed yesterday's meeting concerning the grape
boycott in White Plaza at which students and the University were
urged to support the striking farmworkers.
On strike since 1965, the farmworkers are asking for the right to
hold elections among the workers in the field on whether they wish
a union. If the workers elect to have a union, the employers must
negotiate with the union, which represents the workers demands.
To help the farmworkers continue their strike, students were
asked to help picket local stores which are still selling grapes, as
well as to vote in favor of the University's boycotting grapes in
next week's referendum. If the students express the desire that the
University stop buying and serving grapes in the Union, according
to Mr. Tregea of Tresidder, "we would certainly respond to the
opinion of the student body."
No Action
There will be no immediate action taken on the SDS demands
until Acting President Glaser returns from a trip East.
"Damn it, if you're concerned about your identity, join the United
Farmworkers and get involved," stated Ed Dutton, associate pro
fessor at Fresno State, who has worked in Watts.
"United Farmworkers is not a union per se," according to Andy
Chavez local organizer, but "a poor people's movement" which the
"people are organizing for bread and justice."
Farmer's Plight
A different angle was presented by a student speaking for small
farmers, whose family's farm had just been confiscated by a bank
a week ago. He pointed out the plight of the small grower, threat
ened by both the large, wealthy agro-business conccrns and by the
increase in wages demanded by unionized farmworkers. According
to him, the only solution is to educate "the little guy" that inde
pendent farming is no longer viable and that his strength would be
found in allying himself with labor.
