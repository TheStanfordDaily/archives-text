# SES Report Under Early Attack?
## 
### 
Faculty members in the School of Humanities
and Sciences will vote next Monday after fifteen
minutes of debate on a resolution which, if
passed, could effectively kill the cornerstone pro
posal for a dean of undergraduate studies in the
SES undergraduate education recommendations.
Influential Hand S faculty members claim they
were unaware of the resolution's ramifications
until yesterday when they received advance cop
ies of the SES paper. The resolution was drafted
last week.
Administrators, particularly SES personnel,
view the faculty resolution as a carcfully formu
lated move to ditch the SES idea of a dean of
undergraduate studies. SES Chairman Herbert
Packer notes that the Hand S steering commit
tee, which drafted the resolution, has long known
about the SES plan, and, in fact, received a draft
copy for distribution to all Hand S faculty more
than a week ago.
The Hand S resolution requests that no new
dean of undergraduate education be named prior
to exploration by the faculty and dean of Hand
S of that school's role in undergraduate educa
tion.
Crucial Vote
Differing views aside, it is clear an Hand S
vote accepting the resolution would act as a dam
per of further discussion of the SES idea simply
because Packer and his colleagues view the vote
as crucial.
Richard Lyman, vice-president and provost, has
cancelled a trip to New York to attend the Mon
day Hand S meeting. Packer has scheduled a
meeting with the Hand S steering committee on
Monday just prior to the faculty meeting. This
meeting was originally intended to explore overall
questions about SES, but now will probably cen
ter on resolution discussion. Packer is not a mem
ber of the Hand S faculty.
Conflicting interpretation of the resolution de
veloped in the past two days from a confusing

sequence of events and statements which supply
either view with solid supporting evidence.
For more than a year, the Hand S faculty has
been examining the role of the dean of under
graduate education. The resolution thus appears
to be a logical outcome of that examination.
Timing Bad
The administration asks: "Why then a resolu
tion which calls for further exploration and why
a vote just as the SES idea appears?"
Gavin Langmuir, history professor and chair
man of the Hand S steering committee, stated
yesterday morning that he knew nothing about
the dean of undergraduate studies.
The previous evening he had refused to release
the Hand S agenda which includes the text of
the resolution. He said, "These things are better
discussed after the meeting rather than before."
Yesterday morning he released the text.
Undelivered Reports
Meanwhile, Packer states, Halsey Royden, act
ing dean of Hand S, asked for a copy of the dean
of undergraduate studies proposal nearly two
weeks ago, Royden said, according to Packer,
that copies of the draft recommendation would
be circulated to all Hand S faculty members. As
of yesterday, none had received it.
The resolution was drawn up by the Hand S
steering committee, of which Royden is a mem
ber. Other members of the committee, however,
such as Religion Prof. William Clebsch, claim no
knowledge of the SES plan.
The administration, enlarging on its premise,
has provided a lengthy list of motivations for the
faculty action. Included are (1) a rallying point
for conservative faculty, (2) Hand S faculty
chauvinism, and (3) a desire in the Hand S fac
ulty to keep all power in its hands concerning
undergraduate education.
The SES proposal would limit that power, giv
ing interdepartmental jurisdiction to the new
dean of undergraduate studies. (See article on
SES report.)
