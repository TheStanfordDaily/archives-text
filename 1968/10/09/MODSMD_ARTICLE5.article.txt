## Politics Of Education Study 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
University politics may well
be the curse of the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES).
The Study began 20 months
ago plagued by campus politics,
and publication today of its
recommendations on undergrad
uate education appear in a deep
ly clouded manner and time.
The School of Humanities and
Sciences seems prepared to start
a holding action on The Study's
central proposal for creating a
dean of undergraduate studies
before the proposal gets off the
ground.
SES recommendations were
published by The Daily three
weeks before the official release
daae, but "leak" news coverage
was encouraged by The Study
which is suffering from prema
ture labor pains prompted by
faculty pressure to read, dis
cuss, and revise recommenda
tions before public dissemina
tion.

The SES steering committee
yielded to these calls, but is not
unhappy to find the facts avail
able to the whole community.
Details about publication con
fusion and Hand S faculty an
tagonism portray a grim and
unsure atmosphere surrounding
the conclusions of SES. The poli
ticking in Hand S is probably
a forewarning of comparable
efforts to come, sparked by rec
ommendations that will undoubt
edly disturb faculty interest
groups.
Student interests are equally
affected by the SES undergrad
uate paper and activities from
that sector are a surety. Unlike
the sit-in last spring, students
may find themselves in opposi
tion to a majority of the faculty,
and, surprisingly, in agreement
with most administrators.
Cross-Communication
Lack of communication has
not alleviated political problems
for SES. In fact, according to

many faculty members, cross
communication between SES
and the Hand S faculty ac
counts for the apparent assault
on the dean of undergraduate
studies idea.
SES personnel and high rank
ing administrators feel factual
indications belie this notion, and
are quick to point to recenl
events to prove the faculty is.
as one administrator put it,
"playing dirty pool."
The facts arc not easy to sort
out, but administration and fac
ulty seem committed to the task
whether or not SES recommen
dations lie by the wayside dur
ing the process. Much like last
May's sit-in, the basic issues at
stake may be overwhelmed by
emotional interest-group action
or lack of action.
Debate
Debate on the Hand S act
ties is a case in point. For man
months Hand S has been ex
amining the area of governing
undergraduate education. The
trend of deliberations has been
against naming a now dean of
undergraduate education, and
members of the Hand S faculty
steering committee claim the
resolution on next Monday's
agenda is a logical outcome o1
past discussions.
Provost Richard Lyman and
Vice-Provost Herbert Packer
seem to feel the resolution did
not coincidentally pop up just
as the SES undergraduate stu
dies dean recommendation was
to be published.
The faculty suggests the ad
ministration is paranoic, and the
administration suggests they're
right because there's a cause for
paranoia. The reasoning on both
sides is indicative of the uneasy
and untrusting relationship be
tween the faculty and admin
istration, a relationship which
could kill SES.
Make or Break
Quite simply, the faculty will
make or break SES. Practically
all Study recommendations come
under the jurisdiction of the fac
ulty. Though a faculty vote to
reject a proposal is not legally
binding, administration resist
ence would be futile.
The Hand S faculty is keenly
aware of this point and a vote
on Monday supporting the reso
lution, even if not directed at
the SES recommendation, would
effectively put the damper on
initiatives to name a dean of
undergraduate studies.
Pressure
Faculty pressure has also led
to co fusion surrounding publi
cation v * the undergraduate re
port. Less than a week ago, SES
Chairman Packer planned to re
lease the report in mid-October,
publishing it for everyone at
the same time. A number of in
fluential faculty members insist
ed such a plan left their interests
unanswered. They wished to
view the report in advance and
offer alternative suggestions be
fore final printing.
Turning down the faculty
would be bad politics, so Packer
and the SES steering committee
revised the publication schedule
to incorporate several weeks of
"confidential" debate.
At the same time, Packer
asked ASSU President Denis
Hayes if students cared to have
a "confidential" look, and Hayes
promised to appoint a student
committee.
60 People
The problem soon arose, how
ever, that once 60 people had the
report it would be close to public
knowledge and half its contents
would be rumored around cam
pus. Packer was caught in a
bind. Caring for the faculty
meant muddling the clarity of
one large scale publication and,
in the process, meant a drastic
reduction in the impact of pub
lication.
His problem is ended by today's
Daily, but only the symptom of
a huge malaise has been endt.d.
The faculty got their chance for
review, but the community can
read the same material just
half a day after the faculty re
ceived special copies. What is to
discourage the faculty from be
lieving they were misled by
Packer?

No one is the winner, least of
all SES recommendations and
reasonable discussion of them.

report it would be close to public

No one is the winner, least of

reasonable discussion of them.
It seems clear this morning that
the Stanford community will be
satisfied discussing the politics
of SES rather than its contents.
University politics may well
be the curse of the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES).
The Study began 20 months
ago plagued by campus politics,
and publication today of its
recommendations on undergrad
uate education appear in a deep
ly clouded manner and time.
The School of Humanities and
Sciences seems prepared to start
a holding action on The Study's
central proposal for creating a
dean of undergraduate studies
before the proposal gets off the
ground.
SES recommendations were
published by The Daily three
weeks before the official release
daae, but "leak" news coverage
was encouraged by The Study
which is suffering from prema
ture labor pains prompted by
faculty pressure to read, dis
cuss, and revise recommenda
tions before public dissemina
tion.

The SES steering committee
yielded to these calls, but is not
unhappy to find the facts avail
able to the whole community.
Details about publication con
fusion and Hand S faculty an
tagonism portray a grim and
unsure atmosphere surrounding
the conclusions of SES. The poli
ticking in Hand S is probably
a forewarning of comparable
efforts to come, sparked by rec
ommendations that will undoubt
edly disturb faculty interest
groups.
Student interests are equally
affected by the SES undergrad
uate paper and activities from
that sector are a surety. Unlike
the sit-in last spring, students
may find themselves in opposi
tion to a majority of the faculty,
and, surprisingly, in agreement
with most administrators.
Cross-Communication
Lack of communication has
not alleviated political problems
for SES. In fact, according to

many faculty members, cross
communication between SES
and the Hand S faculty ac
counts for the apparent assault
on the dean of undergraduate
studies idea.
SES personnel and high rank
ing administrators feel factual
indications belie this notion, and
are quick to point to recenl
events to prove the faculty is.
as one administrator put it,
"playing dirty pool."
The facts arc not easy to sort
out, but administration and fac
ulty seem committed to the task
whether or not SES recommen
dations lie by the wayside dur
ing the process. Much like last
May's sit-in, the basic issues at
stake may be overwhelmed by
emotional interest-group action
or lack of action.
Debate
Debate on the Hand S act
ties is a case in point. For man
months Hand S has been ex
amining the area of governing
undergraduate education. The
trend of deliberations has been
against naming a now dean of
undergraduate education, and
members of the Hand S faculty
steering committee claim the
resolution on next Monday's
agenda is a logical outcome o1
past discussions.
Provost Richard Lyman and
Vice-Provost Herbert Packer
seem to feel the resolution did
not coincidentally pop up just
as the SES undergraduate stu
dies dean recommendation was
to be published.
The faculty suggests the ad
ministration is paranoic, and the
administration suggests they're
right because there's a cause for
paranoia. The reasoning on both
sides is indicative of the uneasy
and untrusting relationship be
tween the faculty and admin
istration, a relationship which
could kill SES.
Make or Break
Quite simply, the faculty will
make or break SES. Practically
all Study recommendations come
under the jurisdiction of the fac
ulty. Though a faculty vote to
reject a proposal is not legally
binding, administration resist
ence would be futile.
The Hand S faculty is keenly
aware of this point and a vote
on Monday supporting the reso
lution, even if not directed at
the SES recommendation, would
effectively put the damper on
initiatives to name a dean of
undergraduate studies.
Pressure
Faculty pressure has also led
to co fusion surrounding publi
cation v * the undergraduate re
port. Less than a week ago, SES
Chairman Packer planned to re
lease the report in mid-October,
publishing it for everyone at
the same time. A number of in
fluential faculty members insist
ed such a plan left their interests
unanswered. They wished to
view the report in advance and
offer alternative suggestions be
fore final printing.
Turning down the faculty
would be bad politics, so Packer
and the SES steering committee
revised the publication schedule
to incorporate several weeks of
"confidential" debate.
At the same time, Packer
asked ASSU President Denis
Hayes if students cared to have
a "confidential" look, and Hayes
promised to appoint a student
committee.

Faculty pressure has also led
to co fusion surrounding publi
cation v * the undergraduate re
port. Less than a week ago, SES
Chairman Packer planned to re
lease the report in mid-October,
publishing it for everyone at
the same time. A number of in
fluential faculty members insist
ed such a plan left their interests
unanswered. They wished to
view the report in advance and
offer alternative suggestions be
fore final printing.
Turning down the faculty
would be bad politics, so Packer
and the SES steering committee
revised the publication schedule
to incorporate several weeks of
"confidential" debate.
At the same time, Packer
asked ASSU President Denis
Hayes if students cared to have
a "confidential" look, and Hayes
promised to appoint a student
committee.
60 People
The problem soon arose, how
ever, that once 60 people had the
report it would be close to public
knowledge and half its contents
would be rumored around cam
pus. Packer was caught in a
bind. Caring for the faculty
meant muddling the clarity of
one large scale publication and,
in the process, meant a drastic
reduction in the impact of pub
lication.
His problem is ended by today's
Daily, but only the symptom of
a huge malaise has been endt.d.
The faculty got their chance for
review, but the community can
read the same material just
half a day after the faculty re
ceived special copies. What is to
discourage the faculty from be
lieving they were misled by
Packer?

No one is the winner, least of
all SES recommendations and
reasonable discussion of them.
It seems clear this morning that
the Stanford community will be
satisfied discussing the politics
of SES rather than its contents.
University politics may well
be the curse of the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES).
The Study began 20 months
ago plagued by campus politics,
and publication today of its
recommendations on undergrad
uate education appear in a deep
ly clouded manner and time.
The School of Humanities and
Sciences seems prepared to start
a holding action on The Study's
central proposal for creating a
dean of undergraduate studies
before the proposal gets off the
ground.
SES recommendations were
published by The Daily three
weeks before the official release
daae, but "leak" news coverage
was encouraged by The Study
which is suffering from prema
ture labor pains prompted by
faculty pressure to read, dis
cuss, and revise recommenda
tions before public dissemina
tion.

The SES steering committee
yielded to these calls, but is not
unhappy to find the facts avail
able to the whole community.
Details about publication con
fusion and Hand S faculty an
tagonism portray a grim and
unsure atmosphere surrounding
the conclusions of SES. The poli
ticking in Hand S is probably
a forewarning of comparable
efforts to come, sparked by rec
ommendations that will undoubt
edly disturb faculty interest
groups.
Student interests are equally
affected by the SES undergrad
uate paper and activities from
that sector are a surety. Unlike
the sit-in last spring, students
may find themselves in opposi
tion to a majority of the faculty,
and, surprisingly, in agreement
with most administrators.
Cross-Communication
Lack of communication has
not alleviated political problems
for SES. In fact, according to

many faculty members, cross
communication between SES
and the Hand S faculty ac
counts for the apparent assault
on the dean of undergraduate
studies idea.
SES personnel and high rank
ing administrators feel factual
indications belie this notion, and
are quick to point to recenl
events to prove the faculty is.
as one administrator put it,
"playing dirty pool."
The facts arc not easy to sort
out, but administration and fac
ulty seem committed to the task
whether or not SES recommen
dations lie by the wayside dur
ing the process. Much like last
May's sit-in, the basic issues at
stake may be overwhelmed by
emotional interest-group action
or lack of action.
Debate
Debate on the Hand S act
ties is a case in point. For man
months Hand S has been ex
amining the area of governing
undergraduate education. The
trend of deliberations has been
against naming a now dean of
undergraduate education, and
members of the Hand S faculty
steering committee claim the
resolution on next Monday's
agenda is a logical outcome o1
past discussions.
Provost Richard Lyman and
Vice-Provost Herbert Packer
seem to feel the resolution did
not coincidentally pop up just
as the SES undergraduate stu
dies dean recommendation was
to be published.
The faculty suggests the ad
ministration is paranoic, and the
administration suggests they're
right because there's a cause for
paranoia. The reasoning on both
sides is indicative of the uneasy
and untrusting relationship be
tween the faculty and admin
istration, a relationship which
could kill SES.
Make or Break
Quite simply, the faculty will
make or break SES. Practically
all Study recommendations come
under the jurisdiction of the fac
ulty. Though a faculty vote to
reject a proposal is not legally
binding, administration resist
ence would be futile.
The Hand S faculty is keenly
aware of this point and a vote
on Monday supporting the reso
lution, even if not directed at
the SES recommendation, would
effectively put the damper on
initiatives to name a dean of
undergraduate studies.
