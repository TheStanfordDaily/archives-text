Academic bureaucracy prolife
rates without regard to the ac
tual gain in knowledge. Or, re
stated more simply, scholars
have lost the ability to distin
guish between the pretense of
progress and progress itself.
I submit as evidence a 10-page
paper delivered at a recent con
vention of psychologists: "Some
Recent Developments in Suicid
ology," by Edwin S. Shneidman,
Ph.D.
You probably think Suicidolo
gy has something to do with
suicides. But that's a bit simple.
Suicidology, we are told, is the
study of "the prevention of pre
necessary, self-afflicted destruc
tion."
Suicidology was invented in
1966 by Dr. Shneidman and his
colleagues at the Center for
Studies of Suicide Prevention,
financed by the U.S. Govern
ment's National Institute of
Mental Health.
After its invention, Suicidolo
gy made rapid strides with the
formation of an American Asso
ciation of Suicidology. The fron
tiers of knowledge widened as
two government grants were ob
tained; one to pay for a national
suicidology conference, and one
for an international conference.
Soon a Bulletin of Suicidology
appeared. We will soon be

blessed with a Suicidology Bibli
ography, 1967-1967, listing all
that was ever written on Sui
cidology before it existed.
But Dr. Shenidman and other
suicidologists have not been con
tent with these achievements.
They have actively worked to in
crease the nation's supply of
suicidologists. A federal grant to
Johns Hopkins University has
been used to educate a "cadre
of specially trained suicidolo
gists," and thereby "helped the
movement toward professionali
zation of Suicidology."
But all is not well with the
new profession. The goal of Sui
cidology, explains Dr. Shneid
man, is "a reduction in the sui
cide rate." But the U.S. has no
accurate suicide statistics. How
can suicidologists prove their ef
fectiveness if nobody keeps
count?
Dr. Shneidman has the an
swer: "We must demonstrate
that the lives we claimed to
save were indeed saved. To put
it another way, our goal Is not
only to effect a reduction in sui
cidal deaths but to do so in such
a way as to be able to demon
strate unequivocally that this re
duction has been effected . . . we
shall have to invent new proce
dures of demonstration and
proof."

Now that Suicidology has
achieved professional status,
there should be ample funds to
lick this statistics problem. The
Center spent $1.9 million of re
search grants in 1968 alone. Dr.
Shneidman cites several academ
ic research projects making rap
id strides in developing a "meth
odology" of Suicidology. Every
profession needs its own meth
odology.
Thus we see how a "profes
sion" is created out of thin air,
with all the paraphernalia of
academic bureaucracy. It's like
an industry that sells its own
product back to itself.
Suicides have been studied
for a long time, of course. I
used to think that psychiatrists
worried about suicides. But now,
I suppose, ambitious psychia
trists all over the country are
taking down their "psychiatrist"
shingles and substituting the im
posing title, "suicidologist."
Don't misinterpret my remarks
as criticism of Dr. Shneidman.
He is clearly one of the foremost
suicidologists in the nation.
But I am concerned over the
terrible power of the suffix,
"-ology". By the simple addition
of this suffix to a common word,
it seems possible to establish a
respected profession overnight,
along with annual convention,
scholarly journal, trained cadre,
and millions of dollars of federal
support.
Each new "-ology" constitutes
a dramatic reaffirmation of my
First Law of Modern Scholar
ship: academic bureaucracy pro
liferates without regard to ac
tual gain In knowledge. The
growth of bureaucratic forms
could conceivably impede prog
ress—with all the work of at
tending conventions, compiling
bibliographies, submitting jour
nal articles, and drawing up re
search proposals, who has time
for scholarship?

suicidology conference, and one
for an international conference.
Soon a Bulletin of Suicidology
appeared. We will soon be

blessed with a Suicidology Bibli
ography, 1967-1967, listing all
that was ever written on Sui
cidology before it existed.
But Dr. Shenidman and other
suicidologists have not been con
tent with these achievements.
They have actively worked to in
crease the nation's supply of
suicidologists. A federal grant to
Johns Hopkins University has
been used to educate a "cadre
of specially trained suicidolo
gists," and thereby "helped the
movement toward professionali
zation of Suicidology."
But all is not well with the
new profession. The goal of Sui
cidology, explains Dr. Shneid
man, is "a reduction in the sui
cide rate." But the U.S. has no
accurate suicide statistics. How
can suicidologists prove their ef
fectiveness if nobody keeps
count?
Dr. Shneidman has the an
swer: "We must demonstrate
that the lives we claimed to
save were indeed saved. To put
it another way, our goal Is not
only to effect a reduction in sui
cidal deaths but to do so in such
a way as to be able to demon
strate unequivocally that this re
duction has been effected . . . we
shall have to invent new proce
dures of demonstration and
proof."

Now that Suicidology has
achieved professional status,
there should be ample funds to
lick this statistics problem. The
Center spent $1.9 million of re
search grants in 1968 alone. Dr.
Shneidman cites several academ
ic research projects making rap
id strides in developing a "meth
odology" of Suicidology. Every
profession needs its own meth
odology.
Thus we see how a "profes
sion" is created out of thin air,
with all the paraphernalia of
academic bureaucracy. It's like
an industry that sells its own
product back to itself.
Suicides have been studied
for a long time, of course. I
used to think that psychiatrists
worried about suicides. But now,
I suppose, ambitious psychia
trists all over the country are
taking down their "psychiatrist"
shingles and substituting the im
posing title, "suicidologist."
Don't misinterpret my remarks
as criticism of Dr. Shneidman.
He is clearly one of the foremost
suicidologists in the nation.
But I am concerned over the
terrible power of the suffix,
"-ology". By the simple addition
of this suffix to a common word,
it seems possible to establish a
respected profession overnight,
along with annual convention,
scholarly journal, trained cadre,
and millions of dollars of federal
support.
Each new "-ology" constitutes
a dramatic reaffirmation of my
First Law of Modern Scholar
ship: academic bureaucracy pro

could conceivably impede prog

swer: "We must demonstrate
that the lives we claimed to
save were indeed saved. To put
it another way, our goal Is not
only to effect a reduction in sui
cidal deaths but to do so in such
a way as to be able to demon
strate unequivocally that this re
duction has been effected . . . we
shall have to invent new proce
dures of demonstration and
proof."

Now that Suicidology has
achieved professional status,
there should be ample funds to
lick this statistics problem. The
Center spent $1.9 million of re
search grants in 1968 alone. Dr.
Shneidman cites several academ
ic research projects making rap
id strides in developing a "meth
odology" of Suicidology. Every
profession needs its own meth
odology.
Thus we see how a "profes
sion" is created out of thin air,
with all the paraphernalia of
academic bureaucracy. It's like
an industry that sells its own
product back to itself.
Suicides have been studied
for a long time, of course. I
used to think that psychiatrists
worried about suicides. But now,
I suppose, ambitious psychia
trists all over the country are
taking down their "psychiatrist"
shingles and substituting the im
posing title, "suicidologist."
Don't misinterpret my remarks
as criticism of Dr. Shneidman.
He is clearly one of the foremost
suicidologists in the nation.
But I am concerned over the
terrible power of the suffix,
"-ology". By the simple addition
of this suffix to a common word,
it seems possible to establish a
respected profession overnight,
along with annual convention,
scholarly journal, trained cadre,
and millions of dollars of federal
support.
Each new "-ology" constitutes
a dramatic reaffirmation of my
First Law of Modern Scholar
ship: academic bureaucracy pro
liferates without regard to ac
tual gain In knowledge. The
growth of bureaucratic forms
could conceivably impede prog
ress—with all the work of at
tending conventions, compiling
bibliographies, submitting jour
nal articles, and drawing up re
search proposals, who has time
for scholarship?
