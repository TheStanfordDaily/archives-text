The interim policy on demonstrations
promulgated by Acting President Robert
Glaser is yet another demonstration of how
arbitrary a hierarchy can be.. And we ques
tion if it is really much of a clarification of
the old policy.
Although Glaser recognized that the old
demonstration policy, whose vagueness
helped to bring on last spring's sit-in, was
clearly unacceptable, his new effort does not
help much.
The policy may in fact rlightly clarify
whether demonstrations that obstruct pas
sage in University facilities are against Uni
versity rules. It also gives the administration
a handle on professors and staff members
who join students in protest.
The new policy says it is a violation of
University rules for any member of the fac
ulty, staff or student body to "(1) prevent or
disrupt the effective carrying out of a Uni
versity function or approved activity, such
as lectures, meetings, interviews, ceremo
nies, the conduct of University business in
a University office, and public events; (2)
obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any Univer
sity building or facility."
The enforcing section of the policy is espe
cially arbitrary in its laying on students, fac
ulty, and staff obligations without the con
sent of all interested parties. Glaser might
have consulted more widely on the matter.
Glaser ignored the absurdity of requiring
demonstrators not to "prevent or disrupt the
effective carrying out of a University func
tion or approved activity," when many func
tions and activities like the Reserved Officers
Training Corps and Department of Defense
research may in reality be more oppressive
and more destructive of other people's free
dom than any demonstration could ever be.
The clause that states that demonstrators
must leave a building when asked to do so
by "a member of the University community
acting in an official role, and identifying him

self as such" is full of wonderful ambiguities.
It leaves unclear whether the administration
will tolerate peaceful sit-ins like the one of
last May, in which faculty and staff and stu
dents were free to move among the demon
strators and go about their business if they
wished.
And one can justly question if it could not
have been made clearer just who qualifies as
"a member of the University community act
ing in an official role."
The resulting policy, with the omission of
specific penalties and of specific situations in
which it will be applied, is unacceptable.
The administration has tried to tidy up its
legal superstructure but in the process has
laid a smokescreen over what it actually
means to do.

whether demonstrations that obstruct pas
sage in University facilities are against Uni
versity rules. It also gives the administration
a handle on professors and staff members
who join students in protest.
The new policy says it is a violation of
University rules for any member of the fac
ulty, staff or student body to "(1) prevent or
disrupt the effective carrying out of a Uni
versity function or approved activity, such
as lectures, meetings, interviews, ceremo
nies, the conduct of University business in
a University office, and public events; (2)
obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any Univer
sity building or facility."
The enforcing section of the policy is espe
cially arbitrary in its laying on students, fac
ulty, and staff obligations without the con
sent of all interested parties. Glaser might
have consulted more widely on the matter.
Glaser ignored the absurdity of requiring
demonstrators not to "prevent or disrupt the
effective carrying out of a University func
tion or approved activity," when many func
tions and activities like the Reserved Officers
Training Corps and Department of Defense
research may in reality be more oppressive
and more destructive of other people's free
dom than any demonstration could ever be.
The clause that states that demonstrators
must leave a building when asked to do so
by "a member of the University community
acting in an official role, and identifying him

self as such" is full of wonderful ambiguities.
It leaves unclear whether the administration
will tolerate peaceful sit-ins like the one of
last May, in which faculty and staff and stu
dents were free to move among the demon
strators and go about their business if they
wished.
And one can justly question if it could not
have been made clearer just who qualifies as
"a member of the University community act
ing in an official role."
The resulting policy, with the omission of
specific penalties and of specific situations in
which it will be applied, is unacceptable.
The administration has tried to tidy up its
legal superstructure but in the process has
laid a smokescreen over what it actually
means to do.
The interim policy on demonstrations
promulgated by Acting President Robert
Glaser is yet another demonstration of how
arbitrary a hierarchy can be.. And we ques
tion if it is really much of a clarification of
the old policy.
Although Glaser recognized that the old
demonstration policy, whose vagueness
helped to bring on last spring's sit-in, was
clearly unacceptable, his new effort does not
help much.
The policy may in fact rlightly clarify
whether demonstrations that obstruct pas
sage in University facilities are against Uni
versity rules. It also gives the administration
a handle on professors and staff members
who join students in protest.
