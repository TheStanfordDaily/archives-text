Both the Medical School Senate and the
Black Student Union (BSU) are to be com
mended on their agreement over getting
more minority students into the school â€”
tentatively.
For though the Senate did agree to move
to assure that ten minority students could be
in the class which takes up work next fall, it
failed to approve the 20 percent minority
quota for subsequent classes which the BSU
demanded.
In addition, the important question of how
the students are to be recruited and by whom
they are to be chosen is still open for negotia
tions.
The BSU had asked in its demands to the
Medical School faculty and administration
that a special committee on minority admis
sions be created.
While the precise nature of the admissions
committee or the precise figure for a minority
students quota should certainly be up for ne
gotiations, it is important that neither side
forget the importance of these questions.
We feel that foot-dragging by the Medical
School faculty must be ended with agreement
on specific mechanisms for long-term recruit
ing and selecting minority group students.
