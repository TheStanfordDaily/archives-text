The study of man's natural environment is a 2000-year-old cultural quest.
Thequestion "What is matter" was first asked by the Greek philosophers.

// currently led to the evergrowing realization of how much more there is \\
// yet to be learned. Just as super-huge telescopes are required to study \\
(/ the outer reaches of our universe, so are larger and more complex in-
struments required to probe the near-infinitesimal constituents of matter. C 7
The two-mile accelerator at SLAC is just such an instrument.

Shuttle buses will leave from Serra Street (in front of the quad) as fast
as they arc loaded starting from 2:15 and continuing until 4:15. The tours
will start with a short explanatory motion picture in the SLAC Auditorium
(which will run continuously until 5:00). Following each showing of the
movie, visitors may board buses for tours guided by SLAC faculty, stu
