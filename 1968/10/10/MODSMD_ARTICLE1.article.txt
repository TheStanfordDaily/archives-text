# Political In-Fighting, Confusion May Choke SES

### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
The Study of Education at
Stanford expected intense debate
on its undergraduate paper. On
the day of its publication, debate
is running second to confusion
and questioning.
At least half the community is
unsure how SES started, who
ran it, and, in fact, what it is.
The other half is wondering
about the political furor sur
rounding publication of there-

Analysis

port yesterday and the plans of
the Humanities and Sciences
faculty.
It appears that only a handful
of faculty members, administra
tors and students see the total
picture and are participating in
the action, a situation demand
ing immediate remedy if sense
and saneness are to overtake
bewilderment and ignorance.

The Study was inaugurated in
January, 1967 by former Presi
dent Wa'lace Sterling. Ten years
earlier, Stanford had conducted
a study of undergraduate educa
tion, culminating in the General
Studies program.
T..0 Year Study Recommended
By 1966, complaints about gen
eral studies could no longer be
ignored, and Sterling appointed
a joint faculty-student commit
tee that fall to examine how the
University could best be review
ed and re-evaluated. The com
mittee recommended that a com
plete, two-year study of Stan
ford be conducted, touching all
bases from residues and gov
ernment to curriculum and aca
demic schedule.
In January 1967, Sterling
named Herbert L. Packer as
ehairman of The Studv, and a
steering committee to direct the
operation was short'y form d,
including Packer, five faculty
members, and three students,
"he St"dy was given a budget
112 about $100,000.
Hardly initiated, the Study ran

into political problems. Packer
insisted he have final word in
picking student members, a be
lief strongly opposed by ASSU
President David Harris and oth
er student leaders. Harris asked
that students select students, but
Packer refused and named them
himself after limited consulta
tion with students.
Bad feeling followed The
Study for several months after
this experience. It was an early
indication of future political
problems that would face SES.
More important, it was indica
tive of a serious and major
handicap facing Packer and The
Study.
SES was administration initi
ated and organized, and both stu
dents and faculty members have
found it difficult to overcome the
idea that it began with a Presi
dential directive.
Resentment Resolved
Resentment was subsequently
overcome as influential faculty
members joined and directed
SES work and numerous stu
dents began to participate in de

liberations.
Packer made it clear he was
keenly aware of student input
and some of the major SES rec
ommendations stem from stu
dent activity. During the major
part of its review, SES func
tioned smoothly with coopera
tion and interest from the Uni
versity's three main constitu
encies.
As it gathered steam, The
Study began to exert a subtle
pressure on all areas of Stan
ford life. Other eommittes oper
ating autonomously modified
their efforts to avoid overlapping
with SES, and many short-term
changes in various phases of the
University were set aside until
SES completed its work.
SES Affects Coed Housing
In less subtle fashion, SES
committees occasionally present
ed interim reports and recom
mendations when decisions on
topics were about to be made.
The key example is the SES
residence committee which pre
pared a report last year calling
for expansion of coed housing.

This report played a central role
in expansion of that system for
this year.
Just when SES was running
most smoothly, politics again
entered the picture and nearly
threw the whole program out
the window. The sit-in was the
cause.
Sit-In Alienates
Administration
During the May sit-in, and
more acutely following it, the
administration, particular
-1 y Packer, acted and spoke in
manners that alienated large
numbers in the faculty and stu
dent body.
A peaceful resolution to the
sit-in, many faculty members be
lieved occurred despite admini
tration misjudgments and mis
deeds. The faculty voted against
administration recommendations
and policy in a tumultuous meet
ing of more than 800 faeulty
members, and many faculty
members emerged from the
meeting irritated, if not furious,
at what they claimed to be an
emotional presentation by the

administration, referring direct
ly to Provost Richard Lyman
and Packer.
Packer, and Lyman to a lesser
degree, took the faculty vote as
a personal defeat and quickly
developed defenses, blaming the
faculty for quick-headed actions.
Packer Infuriates Faculty
The administration - faculty
gulf was not small. Shortly after
the sit-in, Packer delivered a hot,
intemperate speech to a meeting
of the faeulty. His speech, and
tone of delivery, further incens
ed faculty members. The result
was great tension over SES, and
for many weeks, some faculty
members working in SES kept
their distance from Packer and
vice versa.
Tensions eased over the sum
mer and this fall SES appeared
to be reaching culmination in a
relatively friendly atmosphere
on campus. All of the spring's
bitterness has not died, however,
and it continues to plague SES
in several forms.
Some faculty members con
tinue to hold a grudge against

Packer and Lyman and will op
erate to undermine SES recom
mendations, but more subtle
problems will prove the larger
obstacles.
Packer remains defensive
about the sit-in and this leads
him to two paradoxical views.
He tends to view the faculty in
a conspiratorial manner, looking
for ways they are out to subvert
his activities. At the same time,
he makes a greater effort to fol
low faculty whims, painfully
aware of their power.
These two attitudes, plus old
faculty antagonism toward
Packer, go a long way in explain
ing some of the political prob
lems facing Packer and SES as
the undergraduate education
paper is discussed.
New Post Under Question
Next Monday the faculty of
the School of Humanities and
Sciences will vote on a resolu
tion that requests no appoint
ment be made to the post of
dean of undergraduate education
until the Hand S faculty and
dean have time to examine their
relation to undergraduate educa
tion. This resolution follows

months of discussion about the
undergraduate dean position.
When Packer heard about the
resolution he immediately con
cluded it was an attempt to hob
b'e the SES proposed calling for
a dean of undergraduate studies.
Packer viewed support of the H
and S resolution as a clear mes
sage that he and Lyman should
stop thinking about a new post.
Hand S faculty members look
upon their resolution in a differ
ent light, claiming they knew
nothing of the SES proposal un
til yesterday, long after the reso
lution was written.
Confidential Faculty
Recommendations
On a separate front, and this
is an example of Packer's bow
ing to faculty wishes, SES post
poned publication of its report
for several weeks so influential
faculty members could discuss it
and make their own recommen
dations in a "confidential man
ner." Packer acceded to this
wish, fearing refusal would
further alienate faculty mera
b rs who will ultimately decide
on adoption of SES recommen
dations.
It is clear some of Packer's
fears are well founded. It is
equally clear his actions have
don? more harm than good.
SES In Jeopardy
These latest developments
place SES in greater jeopardy
than any time in its existence.
Packer and Lyman are squirm
ing about statements printed in
The Daily because they fear
their relationship with the fac
ulty has been further strained
and they face a huge problem
trying to persuade the faculty
to vote against the Hand S
resolution.
Lyman and Packer appear
to be swirling about in tactical
and strategic discussions about
how to deal with the faculty.
Progress Hinger On Trust
Where SES goes from here de
pends on an increase in mutual
trust between faculty members
and administrators. While a gulf
of mistrust separates them, poli
tics and in-fighting will domi
nate discussion.
In the process, SES may choke
to death.

port yesterday and the plans of
the Humanities and Sciences
faculty.
It appears that only a handful
of faculty members, administra
tors and students see the total
picture and are participating in
the action, a situation demand
ing immediate remedy if sense
and saneness are to overtake
bewilderment and ignorance.

The Study was inaugurated in
January, 1967 by former Presi
dent Wa'lace Sterling. Ten years
earlier, Stanford had conducted
a study of undergraduate educa
tion, culminating in the General
Studies program.
T..0 Year Study Recommended
By 1966, complaints about gen
eral studies could no longer be
ignored, and Sterling appointed
a joint faculty-student commit
tee that fall to examine how the
University could best be review
ed and re-evaluated. The com
mittee recommended that a com
plete, two-year study of Stan
ford be conducted, touching all
bases from residues and gov
ernment to curriculum and aca
demic schedule.
In January 1967, Sterling
named Herbert L. Packer as
ehairman of The Studv, and a
steering committee to direct the
operation was short'y form d,
including Packer, five faculty
members, and three students,
"he St"dy was given a budget
112 about $100,000.
Hardly initiated, the Study ran

into political problems. Packer
insisted he have final word in
picking student members, a be
lief strongly opposed by ASSU
President David Harris and oth
er student leaders. Harris asked
that students select students, but
Packer refused and named them
himself after limited consulta
tion with students.
Bad feeling followed The
Study for several months after
this experience. It was an early
indication of future political
problems that would face SES.
More important, it was indica
tive of a serious and major
handicap facing Packer and The
Study.
SES was administration initi
ated and organized, and both stu
dents and faculty members have
found it difficult to overcome the
idea that it began with a Presi
dential directive.
Resentment Resolved
Resentment was subsequently
overcome as influential faculty
members joined and directed
SES work and numerous stu
dents began to participate in de

liberations.
Packer made it clear he was
keenly aware of student input
and some of the major SES rec
ommendations stem from stu
dent activity. During the major
part of its review, SES func
tioned smoothly with coopera
tion and interest from the Uni
versity's three main constitu
encies.
As it gathered steam, The
Study began to exert a subtle
pressure on all areas of Stan
ford life. Other eommittes oper
ating autonomously modified
their efforts to avoid overlapping
with SES, and many short-term
changes in various phases of the
University were set aside until
SES completed its work.
SES Affects Coed Housing
In less subtle fashion, SES
committees occasionally present
ed interim reports and recom
mendations when decisions on
topics were about to be made.
The key example is the SES
residence committee which pre
pared a report last year calling
for expansion of coed housing.

This report played a central role
in expansion of that system for
this year.
Just when SES was running
most smoothly, politics again
entered the picture and nearly
threw the whole program out
the window. The sit-in was the
cause.
Sit-In Alienates
Administration
During the May sit-in, and
more acutely following it, the
administration, particular
-1 y Packer, acted and spoke in
manners that alienated large
numbers in the faculty and stu
dent body.
A peaceful resolution to the
sit-in, many faculty members be
lieved occurred despite admini
tration misjudgments and mis
deeds. The faculty voted against
administration recommendations
and policy in a tumultuous meet
ing of more than 800 faeulty
members, and many faculty
members emerged from the
meeting irritated, if not furious,
at what they claimed to be an
emotional presentation by the

administration, referring direct
ly to Provost Richard Lyman
and Packer.
Packer, and Lyman to a lesser
degree, took the faculty vote as
a personal defeat and quickly
developed defenses, blaming the
faculty for quick-headed actions.
Packer Infuriates Faculty
The administration - faculty
gulf was not small. Shortly after
the sit-in, Packer delivered a hot,
intemperate speech to a meeting
of the faeulty. His speech, and
tone of delivery, further incens
ed faculty members. The result
was great tension over SES, and
for many weeks, some faculty
members working in SES kept
their distance from Packer and
vice versa.
Tensions eased over the sum
mer and this fall SES appeared
to be reaching culmination in a
relatively friendly atmosphere
on campus. All of the spring's
bitterness has not died, however,
and it continues to plague SES
in several forms.
Some faculty members con
tinue to hold a grudge against

Packer and Lyman and will op
erate to undermine SES recom
mendations, but more subtle
problems will prove the larger
obstacles.
Packer remains defensive
about the sit-in and this leads
him to two paradoxical views.
He tends to view the faculty in
a conspiratorial manner, looking
for ways they are out to subvert
his activities. At the same time,
he makes a greater effort to fol
low faculty whims, painfully
aware of their power.
These two attitudes, plus old
faculty antagonism toward
Packer, go a long way in explain
ing some of the political prob
lems facing Packer and SES as
the undergraduate education
paper is discussed.
New Post Under Question
Next Monday the faculty of
the School of Humanities and
Sciences will vote on a resolu
tion that requests no appoint
ment be made to the post of
dean of undergraduate education
until the Hand S faculty and
dean have time to examine their
relation to undergraduate educa
tion. This resolution follows

months of discussion about the
undergraduate dean position.
When Packer heard about the
resolution he immediately con
cluded it was an attempt to hob
b'e the SES proposed calling for
a dean of undergraduate studies.
Packer viewed support of the H
and S resolution as a clear mes
sage that he and Lyman should
stop thinking about a new post.
Hand S faculty members look
upon their resolution in a differ

nothing of the SES proposal un

port yesterday and the plans of
the Humanities and Sciences
faculty.
It appears that only a handful
of faculty members, administra
tors and students see the total
picture and are participating in
the action, a situation demand
ing immediate remedy if sense
and saneness are to overtake
bewilderment and ignorance.

The Study was inaugurated in
January, 1967 by former Presi
dent Wa'lace Sterling. Ten years
earlier, Stanford had conducted
a study of undergraduate educa
tion, culminating in the General
Studies program.
T..0 Year Study Recommended
By 1966, complaints about gen
eral studies could no longer be
ignored, and Sterling appointed
a joint faculty-student commit
tee that fall to examine how the
University could best be review
ed and re-evaluated. The com
mittee recommended that a com
plete, two-year study of Stan
ford be conducted, touching all
bases from residues and gov
ernment to curriculum and aca
demic schedule.
In January 1967, Sterling
named Herbert L. Packer as
ehairman of The Studv, and a
steering committee to direct the
operation was short'y form d,
including Packer, five faculty
members, and three students,
"he St"dy was given a budget
112 about $100,000.
Hardly initiated, the Study ran

into political problems. Packer
insisted he have final word in
picking student members, a be
lief strongly opposed by ASSU
President David Harris and oth
er student leaders. Harris asked
that students select students, but
Packer refused and named them
himself after limited consulta
tion with students.
Bad feeling followed The
Study for several months after
this experience. It was an early
indication of future political
problems that would face SES.
More important, it was indica
tive of a serious and major
handicap facing Packer and The
Study.
SES was administration initi
ated and organized, and both stu
dents and faculty members have
found it difficult to overcome the
idea that it began with a Presi
dential directive.
Resentment Resolved
Resentment was subsequently
overcome as influential faculty
members joined and directed
SES work and numerous stu
dents began to participate in de

liberations.
Packer made it clear he was
keenly aware of student input
and some of the major SES rec
ommendations stem from stu
dent activity. During the major
part of its review, SES func
tioned smoothly with coopera
tion and interest from the Uni
versity's three main constitu
encies.
As it gathered steam, The
Study began to exert a subtle
pressure on all areas of Stan
ford life. Other eommittes oper
ating autonomously modified
their efforts to avoid overlapping
with SES, and many short-term
changes in various phases of the
University were set aside until
SES completed its work.
SES Affects Coed Housing
In less subtle fashion, SES
committees occasionally present
ed interim reports and recom
mendations when decisions on
topics were about to be made.
The key example is the SES
residence committee which pre
pared a report last year calling
for expansion of coed housing.

This report played a central role
in expansion of that system for
this year.
Just when SES was running
most smoothly, politics again
entered the picture and nearly
threw the whole program out
the window. The sit-in was the
cause.
Sit-In Alienates
Administration
During the May sit-in, and
more acutely following it, the
administration, particular
-1 y Packer, acted and spoke in
manners that alienated large
numbers in the faculty and stu
dent body.
A peaceful resolution to the
sit-in, many faculty members be
lieved occurred despite admini
tration misjudgments and mis
deeds. The faculty voted against
administration recommendations
and policy in a tumultuous meet
ing of more than 800 faeulty
members, and many faculty
members emerged from the
meeting irritated, if not furious,
at what they claimed to be an
emotional presentation by the

administration, referring direct
ly to Provost Richard Lyman
and Packer.
Packer, and Lyman to a lesser
degree, took the faculty vote as
a personal defeat and quickly
developed defenses, blaming the
faculty for quick-headed actions.
Packer Infuriates Faculty
The administration - faculty
gulf was not small. Shortly after
the sit-in, Packer delivered a hot,
intemperate speech to a meeting
of the faeulty. His speech, and
tone of delivery, further incens
ed faculty members. The result
was great tension over SES, and
for many weeks, some faculty
members working in SES kept
their distance from Packer and
vice versa.
Tensions eased over the sum
mer and this fall SES appeared
to be reaching culmination in a
relatively friendly atmosphere
on campus. All of the spring's
bitterness has not died, however,
and it continues to plague SES
in several forms.
Some faculty members con
tinue to hold a grudge against

Packer and Lyman and will op
erate to undermine SES recom
mendations, but more subtle
problems will prove the larger
obstacles.
Packer remains defensive
about the sit-in and this leads
him to two paradoxical views.
He tends to view the faculty in
a conspiratorial manner, looking
for ways they are out to subvert
his activities. At the same time,
he makes a greater effort to fol
low faculty whims, painfully
aware of their power.
These two attitudes, plus old
faculty antagonism toward
Packer, go a long way in explain

Packer Infuriates Faculty
The administration - faculty
gulf was not small. Shortly after
the sit-in, Packer delivered a hot,
intemperate speech to a meeting
of the faeulty. His speech, and
tone of delivery, further incens
ed faculty members. The result
was great tension over SES, and
for many weeks, some faculty
members working in SES kept
their distance from Packer and
vice versa.
Tensions eased over the sum
mer and this fall SES appeared
to be reaching culmination in a
relatively friendly atmosphere
on campus. All of the spring's
bitterness has not died, however,
and it continues to plague SES
in several forms.
Some faculty members con
tinue to hold a grudge against

Packer and Lyman and will op
erate to undermine SES recom
mendations, but more subtle
problems will prove the larger
obstacles.
Packer remains defensive
about the sit-in and this leads
him to two paradoxical views.
He tends to view the faculty in
a conspiratorial manner, looking
for ways they are out to subvert
his activities. At the same time,
he makes a greater effort to fol
low faculty whims, painfully
aware of their power.
These two attitudes, plus old
faculty antagonism toward
Packer, go a long way in explain
ing some of the political prob
lems facing Packer and SES as
the undergraduate education
paper is discussed.

Packer viewed support of the H

News
Analysis

port yesterday and the plans of
the Humanities and Sciences
faculty.
It appears that only a handful
of faculty members, administra
tors and students see the total
picture and are participating in
the action, a situation demand
ing immediate remedy if sense
and saneness are to overtake
bewilderment and ignorance.

The Study was inaugurated in
January, 1967 by former Presi
dent Wa'lace Sterling. Ten years
earlier, Stanford had conducted
a study of undergraduate educa
tion, culminating in the General
Studies program.
T..0 Year Study Recommended
By 1966, complaints about gen
eral studies could no longer be
ignored, and Sterling appointed
a joint faculty-student commit
tee that fall to examine how the
University could best be review
ed and re-evaluated. The com
mittee recommended that a com
plete, two-year study of Stan
ford be conducted, touching all
bases from residues and gov
ernment to curriculum and aca
demic schedule.
In January 1967, Sterling
named Herbert L. Packer as
ehairman of The Studv, and a
steering committee to direct the
operation was short'y form d,
including Packer, five faculty
members, and three students,
"he St"dy was given a budget
112 about $100,000.
Hardly initiated, the Study ran

into political problems. Packer
insisted he have final word in
picking student members, a be
lief strongly opposed by ASSU
President David Harris and oth
er student leaders. Harris asked
that students select students, but
Packer refused and named them
himself after limited consulta
tion with students.
Bad feeling followed The
Study for several months after
this experience. It was an early
indication of future political
problems that would face SES.
More important, it was indica
tive of a serious and major
handicap facing Packer and The
Study.
SES was administration initi
ated and organized, and both stu
dents and faculty members have
found it difficult to overcome the
idea that it began with a Presi
dential directive.
Resentment Resolved
Resentment was subsequently
overcome as influential faculty
members joined and directed
SES work and numerous stu
dents began to participate in de

liberations.
Packer made it clear he was
keenly aware of student input
and some of the major SES rec
ommendations stem from stu
dent activity. During the major
part of its review, SES func
tioned smoothly with coopera
tion and interest from the Uni
versity's three main constitu
encies.
As it gathered steam, The
Study began to exert a subtle
pressure on all areas of Stan
ford life. Other eommittes oper
ating autonomously modified
their efforts to avoid overlapping
with SES, and many short-term
changes in various phases of the
University were set aside until
SES completed its work.
SES Affects Coed Housing
In less subtle fashion, SES
committees occasionally present
ed interim reports and recom
mendations when decisions on
topics were about to be made.
The key example is the SES
residence committee which pre
pared a report last year calling
for expansion of coed housing.

This report played a central role
in expansion of that system for
this year.
Just when SES was running
most smoothly, politics again
entered the picture and nearly
threw the whole program out
the window. The sit-in was the
cause.
Sit-In Alienates
Administration
During the May sit-in, and
more acutely following it, the
administration, particular
-1 y Packer, acted and spoke in
manners that alienated large
numbers in the faculty and stu
dent body.
A peaceful resolution to the
sit-in, many faculty members be
lieved occurred despite admini
tration misjudgments and mis
deeds. The faculty voted against
administration recommendations
and policy in a tumultuous meet
ing of more than 800 faeulty
members, and many faculty
members emerged from the
meeting irritated, if not furious,
at what they claimed to be an
emotional presentation by the

administration, referring direct
ly to Provost Richard Lyman
and Packer.
Packer, and Lyman to a lesser
degree, took the faculty vote as
a personal defeat and quickly
developed defenses, blaming the
faculty for quick-headed actions.
