"If we could research spray noz
zles, those nozzles may be used to
spray crops with insecticide or used
to spray people with poison." Robert
K. Brunswald, a vice president of
the Stanford Research Institute
(5.R.1.), spoke—smiling languidly—
he could have been discussing the
year's pork production in Kansas.
Last Friday a group of five fresh
men viewed the factory. A group of
massive buildings, this center of in
human research, 5.R.1., stood in de
fiance of our presence.
Inside: Brightly colored cubist
paintings twisting in their frames,
camoflauged the green corridors jag
ging off from the main hall—running
deep into the hidden womb of the
research center.
The waiting room—antiseptically
cleansed of odors and perfumed
with the smell of no smell—reflected
success. And, indeed, the past year
had been a good one for S.R.I.—
thirty-five million dollars in Defense
contracts alone. The display, ar
ranged in humble taste, fused with
the modd of American business.
Leaning over a mahogany table—
settling into a massive black leather
chair—pursing his lips with a tight
suffering grimace, Mr. Robert Med
ders' Public Relations Officer ex
plained the subsistance state of
5.R.1.:
"Heck, we barely have enough to
keep me on—and I'm the P.R. man.
I have to take all you ami lots of
other people around." The tears be
gan to flow. Pausing, staring blank
ly but with sad, puppy eyes, at the
hardwood paneling on the far wall,
Mr. Medders continued his mourn
ful cant: "Heck, if we take even a
little time away from our scientists
we might not even stay in the
BLACK."
A day in the life of an S.R.I,
worker is hard. He is constantly sub
ject to attack by the viscious and
scandalous newspapers.

Mr. Medders pointed out: "Heck,
they just lie. Why last year some
one said we were building explosive
gelatin capsules to increase the de
structive yield. And heck, we tried
them out and they couldn't hold in
that much pressure at all. Heck, how
could we be intent on increasing de
structive yield?"
The S.R.I, is policyless, colorless,
and spayed. Asked if any discretion
were used in the selection of proj
ects, Brunswold responded, "We op
erate under no policy at all. We
don't consider the uses of our re
search."
The talk over—standing up, shak
ing the two queezy hands—we left
with a good knowledge of the
S.R.l.'s illustrious projects: "Biologi
cal-chemical warfare, bomb-charting
in Vietnam, Communist insurgents,
counter insurgency techniques by
violence, unconventional warfare,
A-bomb transportation, recruiting
guerrillas, Navy in counterinsurgen
cy. . . The utility and diversity of
S.R.I, speaks for itself.
Most heartening, however, is the
focus of the organization. "Improve
the general standard of living in
America and the PEACE and PROS
PERITY of mankind."
As we trolleyed off, Mr. Medders
stood by the door waving, a hand
kerchief in one hand, mouthing some
word—-could it have been "PAX?"

plained the subsistance state of
5.R.1.:
"Heck, we barely have enough to
keep me on—and I'm the P.R. man.
I have to take all you ami lots of
other people around." The tears be
gan to flow. Pausing, staring blank
ly but with sad, puppy eyes, at the
hardwood paneling on the far wall,
Mr. Medders continued his mourn
ful cant: "Heck, if we take even a
little time away from our scientists
we might not even stay in the
BLACK."
A day in the life of an S.R.I,
worker is hard. He is constantly sub
ject to attack by the viscious and
scandalous newspapers.

Mr. Medders pointed out: "Heck,
they just lie. Why last year some
one said we were building explosive
gelatin capsules to increase the de
structive yield. And heck, we tried
them out and they couldn't hold in
that much pressure at all. Heck, how
could we be intent on increasing de
structive yield?"
The S.R.I, is policyless, colorless,
and spayed. Asked if any discretion
were used in the selection of proj
ects, Brunswold responded, "We op
erate under no policy at all. We
don't consider the uses of our re
search."
The talk over—standing up, shak
ing the two queezy hands—we left
with a good knowledge of the
S.R.l.'s illustrious projects: "Biologi
cal-chemical warfare, bomb-charting
in Vietnam, Communist insurgents,
counter insurgency techniques by
violence, unconventional warfare,
A-bomb transportation, recruiting
guerrillas, Navy in counterinsurgen
cy. . . The utility and diversity of
S.R.I, speaks for itself.
Most heartening, however, is the
focus of the organization. "Improve
the general standard of living in
America and the PEACE and PROS
PERITY of mankind."
As we trolleyed off, Mr. Medders
stood by the door waving, a hand
kerchief in one hand, mouthing some
word—-could it have been "PAX?"

"If we could research spray noz
zles, those nozzles may be used to
spray crops with insecticide or used
to spray people with poison." Robert
K. Brunswald, a vice president of
the Stanford Research Institute
(5.R.1.), spoke—smiling languidly—
he could have been discussing the
year's pork production in Kansas.
Last Friday a group of five fresh
men viewed the factory. A group of
massive buildings, this center of in
human research, 5.R.1., stood in de
fiance of our presence.
Inside: Brightly colored cubist
paintings twisting in their frames,
camoflauged the green corridors jag
ging off from the main hall—running
deep into the hidden womb of the
research center.
The waiting room—antiseptically
cleansed of odors and perfumed
with the smell of no smell—reflected
success. And, indeed, the past year
had been a good one for S.R.I.—
thirty-five million dollars in Defense
contracts alone. The display, ar
ranged in humble taste, fused with
the modd of American business.

chair—pursing his lips with a tight
suffering grimace, Mr. Robert Med
