### BILL LELAND ALAN STRAIN 
This week's column will dis
cuss the I-S(C) classification
and some initial considerations
pertinent to the graduate stu
dent who began his graduate
study after June 30, 19G7.
To clear up confusion concern
ing the I-S(C), we will first cite
the Selective Service regula
tions. Section 1622.15(b) reads
as follows: "In Class I-S shall
be placed any registrant who
while satisfactorily pursuing a
full-time course of instruction at
a college (or) university . . . and
during his academic year at
such instittuion is ordered to
report for induction, except that
no registrant shall be placed in
Class I-S under the provision of
this paragraph (1) who has pre
viously been placed in Class I-S
thereunder or (2) who has been
deferred as a student in Class
11-S (after June 30, 1967) and
has received his baccalaureate
degree; a registrant who Is
placed in I-S under the provision

of this paragraph shall be re
tained in Class I-S (1) until the
end of his academic year or (2)
until he ceases satisfactorily to
pursue such course of instruc
tion, whichever is earlier."
In short, an undergraduate
who has not previously had a
I-S(C) and is ordered to report
for induction during his academ
ic year is deferred by statute in
Class I-S(C) for the remainder
of his academic year.
The graduate student is eligi
ble for the I-S(C) only if he has
not requested and received the
11-S deferment after June 30,
1967.
Emphasizing again, the I-S(C)
is granted only after the mailing
of an order to Report for Induc
tion. At the termination of the
I-S classification, the registrant
may request a 11-S or other ap
propriate classification.
The discussion of the I-S(C)
once again underlines the highly
eligible draft status of the pres
ent first or second year graduate
student.

There is an outside chance,
perhaps an extreme "long shot",
that the first or second year
graduate student may qualify
for the 11-A classification. Sec
tion 1622.22(a) of the Selective
Service regulations reads: "In
Class 11-A shall be placed any
registrant whose employment in
industry, or other occupation or
employment, ... or whose ac
tivity in research, or medical,
scientific, or other endeavors is
found to be necessary to the
maintenance of the national
health, safety, or interest."
Operations Bulletin No. 322 of
February 1968 further indicates
that the law leaves "each local
board with discretion to grant,
in individual cases, occupational
deferments based on a showing
of essential community need."

once again underlines the highly
eligible draft status of the pres
ent first or second year graduate
student.

There is an outside chance,
perhaps an extreme "long shot",
that the first or second year
graduate student may qualify
for the 11-A classification. Sec
tion 1622.22(a) of the Selective
Service regulations reads: "In
Class 11-A shall be placed any
registrant whose employment in
industry, or other occupation or
employment, ... or whose ac
tivity in research, or medical,
scientific, or other endeavors is
found to be necessary to the
maintenance of the national
health, safety, or interest."
Operations Bulletin No. 322 of
February 1968 further indicates
that the law leaves "each local
board with discretion to grant,
in individual cases, occupational
deferments based on a showing
of essential community need."
This week's column will dis
cuss the I-S(C) classification
and some initial considerations
pertinent to the graduate stu
dent who began his graduate
study after June 30, 19G7.
To clear up confusion concern
ing the I-S(C), we will first cite
the Selective Service regula
tions. Section 1622.15(b) reads
as follows: "In Class I-S shall
be placed any registrant who
while satisfactorily pursuing a
full-time course of instruction at
a college (or) university . . . and
during his academic year at
such instittuion is ordered to
report for induction, except that
no registrant shall be placed in
Class I-S under the provision of
this paragraph (1) who has pre
viously been placed in Class I-S
thereunder or (2) who has been
deferred as a student in Class
11-S (after June 30, 1967) and
has received his baccalaureate
degree; a registrant who Is
placed in I-S under the provision

of this paragraph shall be re
tained in Class I-S (1) until the
end of his academic year or (2)
until he ceases satisfactorily to
pursue such course of instruc
tion, whichever is earlier."
In short, an undergraduate
who has not previously had a
I-S(C) and is ordered to report
for induction during his academ
ic year is deferred by statute in
Class I-S(C) for the remainder
of his academic year.
The graduate student is eligi
ble for the I-S(C) only if he has
not requested and received the
11-S deferment after June 30,
1967.
Emphasizing again, the I-S(C)
is granted only after the mailing
of an order to Report for Induc
tion. At the termination of the
I-S classification, the registrant
may request a 11-S or other ap
propriate classification.
