• Menlo Race Riot
MENLO PARK (AP) — Po
lice were called to Menlo Ather
ton High School Wednesday
where fighting broke out be
tween Negro and white students.
Three police cars from Ather
ton and two from Menlo Park
stood guard outside while facul
ty members restored order.
Principal Douglas D. Murray,
who has rejected Negro de
mands that he resign, said five
white students were beaten up,
none seriously.
The high school, which has
350 Negroes among its 2,000
students, has had flareups since
last Friday when signs appear
ed in washrooms threatening
blacks. That day the school
closed early.
But Murray said Wednesday
there was "absolutely no pos
sibility" of any shutdown.
Atherton Police Lt. Shirden
Flanders said Murray summon
ed police Wednesday afternoon,
reporting about 100 students had
formed roving bands and were
beating students as they left
classes.
But Flanders said the bands
had broken up when police got
there.
Murray told faculty members
to keep the hallways clear and
empowered them to suspend
students not obeying instruc
tions.
Last year Menlo Atherton
High was closed for three days
because of racial troubles. A
parents' group, formed as a re
sult, backed Murray.
The demand for Murray's
resignation was made Monday
bya group of 30 blacks who said
he mishandled minorities.

predominated, however. At Pan

Nixon told a big crowd:
"A vote for Rafferty is a vote
for the new leadership we
need."
Nixon's visit brought o; t thou

score of hecklers. He < xhorted
partisans to "sock it to" heck
lers.

SAIGON (AP) — A coup at
tempt against President Nguyen
Van Thieu's government has
been foiled and mass arrests of
ranking South Vietnamese offi
cers are expected, a high gov
ernment source said Wednes
day.
An official spokesman for
Thieu, however, denied knowl
edge of any coup attempt, al
though he admitted the govern
ment had placed South Viet
nam's armed forces on full
alert. The U.S. Embassy also
said it had no information about
an abortive coup.
The highly placed source told
reporters several Vietnamese
majors and colonels had already
been arrested.
"You can expect a lot of peo
ple to be arrested in the next
few days as a result of the coup
attempt that failed," he said.
The source reported that the
coup was thwarted Tuesday
night. If true, it was the first at
tempt to overthrow Thieu's gov
ernment since he came into
power in October, 1967.
• Polls Against Him
ALBANY, N. Y. (AP) — Geo
rge C. Wallace charged Wednes

day that Richard M. Nixon is in
cahoots with the Gallup Poll and
said the national public opinion
polls are rigged.
Wallace called for a congres
sional investigation of the
professional polltakers, who he
said are controlled by the East
ern moneyed interests.
The third-party presidential
challenger predicted the next
major poll will show that he has
lost ground to Republican Nix
on. He offered this explanation
at a rally of 5,000 in Scranton,
Pa., elaborating at an airport
news conference in Albany later:
"Mr. Nixon said in Michigan
the other day Gov. Wallace is
beginning to lose some of his
support—and the reason for that
is, Mr. Nixon knows what th.?
Gallup Poll is going to say in
advance.
"Because they are for Mr.
Nixon. And we ought to have a
Congressional investigation of
these professional pollsters in
the country."

• Down To The Wire
ST. LOUIS (AP) — The awe
some figure of Bob Gibson, sev
enth game hero of two St. Louis
Cardinal world champs, bars
the door to the aroused Detroit
Tigers who evened the World
Series at three games each be
hind Denny McLain Wednesday
with a 13-1 romp on a record
tying 10-run third inning.
Gibson, who beat the New
York Yankees in the seventh
game in 1964, the Boston Red
Sox in 1967 and won two earlier
games in this set, will face
Mickey Lolich, the Tigers' two
game winner in Thursday's
showdown at Busch Stadium.

Lolich will be coming back with
only two days' rest.
Until the final minutes of the
rain-spattered sixth contest, it
appeared the Cardinals were to
suffer the humiliation of the
most lopsided shutout in Series
history. They finally scratched
out a run in then inth when Ju
lian Javier singled with two on
and two out.
McLain, the 31-game winner
who was reported out of the Ser
ies after losing the first and
fourth games, credited a corti
sone shot with dulling the pain
in his aching right shoulder to
permit this clutch performance.
