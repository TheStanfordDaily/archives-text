# Committee Report

(EDITOR'S NOTE: Because of the importance of the work that
goes on in University committees, the chairmen of several of the
committees of the Academic Council have consented to report pro
ceedings of interest to the community through The Daily.)
Law Prof. William Baxter, chairman of the Committee on Re
search Policy, reports the following actions taken by the committee
in its Tuesday meeting:
• The committee approved renewal of a half-million-dollar con
tract between Stanford Electronic Laboratories and a research arm
of the Air Force for research on problems of receiver techniques,
electric pattern recognition, and related questions.
• The committee rejected a proposal for a contract between Stan
ford Electronics Laboratories and Ford Philco to apply techniques
developed in the laboratories on Ford Philco problems. The contract
may be resubmitted later.
• The committee approved the continuation of a National Aero
nautics and Space Administration (NASA) summer program held
at Stanford which is classified because some of the research work
done by the academicians who participate must be carried on at a
military base.
• The committee approved a $25,000 to $30,000 a year contract
between NASA and the Department of Aeronautics and Astronau
tics for research on math model building concerning panel behavior
at ultra-supersonic speeds.
• The committee questioned another smaller project for the Civil
Engineering Department for building math models concerning fluid
flow on hydrofoils because of a "troublesome clause," Prof. Baxter
said. This contract may also be resubmitted.
