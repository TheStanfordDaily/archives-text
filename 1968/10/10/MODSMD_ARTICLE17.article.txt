(Continued From TUESDAY )

This article was written by
Jerry Farber, a teacher at
Cal State, Los Angeles. It
may be that the phenomenon
he discusses - the treatment
of students as niggers by
the education system —may
not be limited to Cal State.

That's plenty sexual, although the price
of enjoying it is to be unaware of what's happening.
In walks the student in his Ivy League equivalent of
a motorcycle jacket. In walks the teacher-a kind of
intellectual rough trade-and flogs his students with
grades, tests, sarcasamand, snotty superiority until
their very brains are bleeding. In Swinboume's En
gland, the whipped school boy frequently grew up to
be a flagellant. With us the perversion is intellectual
but it's no less perverse.
Sek also shows up in the classroom as academic
subject matter-sanitized and abstracted, thoroughly
divorced from feeling. You get "sex education" now in
both high school and college classes:everyone deter
mined not to be embarrassed, to be very up to date,
very contempo. These are the classes for which sex,
as Feiffer puts it, ' can be a beautiful thing if proper
ly administered.' And then, of course, there's still
another deDressing manifestation of sex in the class
room: the "off-color" teacher, who keeps his class
awake with sniggering sexual allusions, obscene
titters and academic innuendo. The sexuality he pur
veys, it must be admitted, is at least better than
none at all.
What's missing, from kindergarten to graduate
school, is honest recognition of what's actually hap
pening-turned-on awareness of sexuality. It's not
that sex needs to be pushed in school. But we should
let it be, where it is and like it is. It is only reason
ably to ask that junior high school teachers don't by
example and stricture, teach students to repress their
sexuality. As things stand now, students are physically
castrated or spayed-and for the very same reason that
black men are castrated in Georgia: because they're
a threat.
So you can add sexual repression to the list of
causes, along with vanity, fear and will to power,
that turn the teacher into Mr. Charlie. You might also
want to keep in mind that he was a nigger once himself
and has never really gotten over it. And there are
more causes, some of which are better described
in sociological than in psychological terms. Work them
out, it's not hard. But in the meantime what we've got
on our hands is a whole lot of niggers. And what
makes this particularly grim is that the student has
less chance than the black man of getting out of his
bag. Because the student doesn't even know he's in it.
That, more or less, is what's happening in higher
education. .And the results are staggering.
For one thing damn little education takes place in the
schools. How could it? You can't educate slaves; you
can only train them. Or, to use an even uglier and
more timely word, you can only program them.
1 like to folk dance. Like other novices, I've gone
to the Intersection or to the Museum and paid out
good money in order to learn how to dance. No grades,
no prerequisites, no separate dining rooms; they just
turn you on to dancing. That's education. Now look

at what happens in college. A friend of mine, Milt,
recently finished a folk dance class. For his final
he had to learn things like this: "The Irish are known
for their wit and imagination, qualities reflected in
their dances, which include the jig, the reel and the
hornpipe." And then the teacher graded him A,B, C, D,
or F, while he danced in front of her. That's not
education. That's not even training. That's an abomina
tion on the face of the earth. It's especially ironic
because Milt took that dance class trying to get out of
the academic rut. He took crafts for the same reason.
Great, right? Get your hand in some clay? Make
something? Then the teacher announced that a 20-page
term paper would be required-with footnotes.
At my school we even grade people on how they read
poetry. That's like grading people on how they make
love. But we do it. In fact, God help me, I do it. I'm
the Adolph Eichmann of English 323. Simon Legreeon
the poetry plantation. "Tote that lamb! Lift that
spondee!" Even to discuss a good poem in that en
vironment is potentially dangerous because the very
classroom is contaminated. As hard as I may try to
turn students on to poetry, I know that the desks, the
tests, the IBM cards, their own attitudes toward school,
and my own residue of UCLA method are turning them
off.
Another result of student slavery is equally serious.
Students don't eet emancipated when they graduate.
As a matter of fact, we don't let them graduate until
they've demonstrated their willingness-over 16 years
to remain slaves. And for important jobs, like teaching,
we make them go through more years, just to make
sure. What I'm getting at is that we're all more or
less niggers and slaves, teachers and students alike.
This is a fact you want to start with in trying to under
stand wider social phenomena, say, politics in our
country and in other countries.
Educational oppression is trickier to fight than racial
oppression. If you're a black rebel, they can't exile
you; they either have to intimidate you or kill you.
But in high school or college, they can just bounce
you out of the fold. And they do. Rebel students and
renegade faculty members get smothered or shot down
with devastating accuracy. In high school, it's usually
the student who gets it; in college, it's more often the
teacher. Others get tired of fighting and voluntarily
leave the system. This may be a mistake though.
Dropping out of college, for a rebel, is a little like
going North, for a Negro. You can't really get away
from it so you might as well stay and raise hell.
How do you raise hell? That's a whole other article.
But just for a start, why not stay with the analogy?
What have black people done? They have, first of all,
faced the fact of their slavery. They've stopped kid
ding themselves about an eventual reward in that Great
Watermelon Patch in the sky. They've organized;
they've decided to get freedom now, and they've start
ed taking it.
Students, lik.? black people, have immense un
used power. They could, theoretically, insist
on participating in their own education. They
could make academic freedom bilateral. They
could teach their teachers to thrive on love and
admiration, rather than fear and respect, and to
lay down their weapons. Students could dis
cover community. And they could learn to dance
