# Troppman Girds Papooses For 'Awesome' Trobabes
## 
### BOB FEDUNLAK 
Stanford's frosh footballers
will try to set an example for
the varsity when they open their
season Friday afternoon at 2:30
against a University of Southern
California yearling squad de
scribed by Papoose coach Jim
Troppman as "impressive" and
"awesome."
Led by high school all-Amer
ica quarterback Mike Moore, the
Cards will rely mainly on a run
ning attack featuring the speed
of Jackie Brown and the power
of Hilary Shockley.
Watch For Roll-out
Brown, a 190 lb. all-stater from
Yakima, Washington, is a 9.9
man with fine moves, while
Shockley, at 205 lb., has the
strength needed in short yardage
situations. Quarterback Moore is
also a fine runner, and Coach
Troppman plans on using a roll
out offense to take full advan
tage of Moore's abilities.
When Moore throws, his pri
mary target looks to be Don
Alvarado, an excellent flanker
back from San Anselmo, who
played on the North Shrine team
this summer.
Offensive Line Sturdy
Blocking duties will be han
dled by a strong offensive line,
led by two pro-sized tackles —
6'5", 235 lb. Greg Sampson, an
all-City selection from Long

Beach; and all-America, all-
C.I.F. Chic Doe, a 6'6" 243 pound
er from Pico Rivera.
Also featured in the offensive
line will be two-time all-league
center Denny Sheehan from De
lano, whose brother Tim was a
first string performer for the
Indian varsity at the same po
sition in 1965 and 1966.
Defensively, Troppman singled
out Jeff Siemon, a 220 lb. middle
linebacker from Bakersfield, as
the key performer. Siemon, a
South Shrine team performer,
has impressed the coaching staff
with his aggressive play, and
looks like "the heart of the de
fense," according to Troppman.
Injuries Claim Pair
Troppman also made special
mention of two injured players
who, though unable to suit up
tomorrow, figure to play key
roles later in the season.
Both Pete Lazetich, an all-
America and two-time all-stater
from Billings, Montana, and
Mike Kloos, the North Shrine
team quarterback, suffered in
juries in summer all-star games.
However, Troppman feels that
both might be ready to see ac
tion in the final two games
against Cal and San Jose.
Sizing up the team, Troppman
cited lack of depth as the biggest
overall handicap facing the
Papooses this season. With only

- »r
42 men on the squad, many tit
the starters will play both ways,
so late-game fatigue could ptoye
to be a problem.
The biggest question about to
morrow's game th 6 ugh, Is
whether Siemon and the test
of the Stanford defense can
contain Trobabe
Jimmy Jones. Jones, a Super
star from Harrisburg, Penh,,
holds countless state records and
was regarded by many college
coaches as the finest high school
player in the nation.
Small SC Squad
The rest of the USC frosh,
though less widely kncAvn than
Jones, certainly havfe no lacj? of
talent. Virtually evefy stAJsfci"
on the small but very setypt
squad (23 men) was kU-stot6
caliber in high school. Tfadititth*
ally, the Trobabe team is rtiiwb
up entirely of men .fb
see much varsity action, fthd
this year appears to be no ex
ception.
There is no doubt that tfte
Papooses must play in oat
standing game to win. But -U
Jones can be hold in chfcck White
the Stanford backs rUn at their
best, Indian rooters can expect
to be treated to the first half
of a rare spectacle — twp tJSC
football losses within 24 houlte.

this year appears to be no ex

There is no doubt that tfte
Papooses must play in oat

the Stanford backs rUn at their
best, Indian rooters can expect
to be treated to the first half
of a rare spectacle — twp tJSC
football losses within 24 houlte.
Stanford's frosh footballers
will try to set an example for
the varsity when they open their
season Friday afternoon at 2:30
against a University of Southern
California yearling squad de
scribed by Papoose coach Jim
Troppman as "impressive" and
"awesome."
Led by high school all-Amer
ica quarterback Mike Moore, the
Cards will rely mainly on a run
ning attack featuring the speed
of Jackie Brown and the power
of Hilary Shockley.
Watch For Roll-out
Brown, a 190 lb. all-stater from
Yakima, Washington, is a 9.9
man with fine moves, while
Shockley, at 205 lb., has the
strength needed in short yardage
situations. Quarterback Moore is
also a fine runner, and Coach
Troppman plans on using a roll
out offense to take full advan
tage of Moore's abilities.
When Moore throws, his pri
mary target looks to be Don
Alvarado, an excellent flanker
back from San Anselmo, who
played on the North Shrine team
this summer.
Offensive Line Sturdy
Blocking duties will be han
dled by a strong offensive line,
led by two pro-sized tackles —
6'5", 235 lb. Greg Sampson, an
all-City selection from Long

Beach; and all-America, all-
C.I.F. Chic Doe, a 6'6" 243 pound
er from Pico Rivera.
Also featured in the offensive
line will be two-time all-league
center Denny Sheehan from De
lano, whose brother Tim was a
first string performer for the
Indian varsity at the same po
sition in 1965 and 1966.
Defensively, Troppman singled
out Jeff Siemon, a 220 lb. middle
linebacker from Bakersfield, as
the key performer. Siemon, a
South Shrine team performer,
has impressed the coaching staff
with his aggressive play, and
looks like "the heart of the de
fense," according to Troppman.
Injuries Claim Pair
Troppman also made special
mention of two injured players
who, though unable to suit up
tomorrow, figure to play key
roles later in the season.
Both Pete Lazetich, an all-
America and two-time all-stater
from Billings, Montana, and
Mike Kloos, the North Shrine
team quarterback, suffered in
juries in summer all-star games.
However, Troppman feels that
both might be ready to see ac
tion in the final two games
against Cal and San Jose.
Sizing up the team, Troppman
cited lack of depth as the biggest
overall handicap facing the
Papooses this season. With only

- »r
42 men on the squad, many tit
the starters will play both ways,
so late-game fatigue could ptoye
to be a problem.
The biggest question about to
morrow's game th 6 ugh, Is
whether Siemon and the test
of the Stanford defense can
contain Trobabe
Jimmy Jones. Jones, a Super
star from Harrisburg, Penh,,
holds countless state records and
was regarded by many college
coaches as the finest high school
player in the nation.
