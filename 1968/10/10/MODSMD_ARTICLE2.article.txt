# A 						Fast Visit With Mark Rudd
## 
### BARBARA RITZ 
After most of the questions
had been asked, the auditorium
almost empty, Mark Rudd, guest
speaker for the SDS program in
Memorial Auditorium and lead
er of Columbia's demonstrations
last May, found a short oppor
tunity to rest.
He was seated in a chair by
the aisle. I noticed he was wear
ing a maroon knit shirt, similar
to one he had been photographed
wearing in last spring's NEWS
WEEK. With vivid phrases the
article described the Columbia
demonstrations and the accom
panying photograph made him
look like an orator shouting a

harangue to masses of students.
"Hi, I'm Mark," he said, smil
ing to me. I identified myself as
a DAILY reporter.
He told me he was 21 years
old, from New York, and that
he entered Columbia University
with the intention of becoming
a history major.
"Do you intend to go back to
school?" I asked. He said he
might, but that he was more
concerned with SDS at the mo
ment.
"What are your plans if you
lon't graduate?"
"Why do you have to gradu
ate?" he asked me, adding that
his goals are working for SDS
and publicizing the movement.
I wanted to ask him what he
planned to do with his life after
that, but there was no way to
phrase the question. He faceti
ously commented that he would
be a college professor after a
number of years, so he could
teach students the same kind of
values that he was learning in
society now.
"I don't want to go on with
this interview," he said.
"It would be all right if you
asked me about my plans for
SDS, but I don't want to go into
my personal life. 'Mark Rudd' is
nly a name and I don't want to
p rp trate the image of 'Mark
P.udd' the way the press has
1 n 'oing it all along."
' Why aro you in SDS and
g v ng public speeches if you
don't want to see your image
perpetrated?" I asked.
"I'm doing it for the money,"
c mment d, smiling, as if
' w .nt 'd mo to smil", too. Mark
• • .plainej that he had a busy
chrdulc and was supposed to
]■ avc shortly for San Francisco.
He looked up at several per
sons in the auditorium. His

voice carried that facetious
sound again. .
"I'm not Mark Rudd," he said.
He pointed to a eoiripanion.
"That's Mark Rudd. She's wear
ing a mask and different clothes,
and she goes around talking like
me. When the press writes
about Mark Rudd, they write
about her."
His comment made me think
about the pages of newspaper
commentary on the Columbia
demonstrations, the detailed ac
counts of rebel leaders, and the
names that won't be soon for
gotten.
He smiled again. "There really
isn't any 'Mark Rudd' after all."

school?" I asked. He said he
might, but that he was more
concerned with SDS at the mo
ment.
"What are your plans if you
lon't graduate?"
"Why do you have to gradu
ate?" he asked me, adding that
his goals are working for SDS
and publicizing the movement.
I wanted to ask him what he
planned to do with his life after
that, but there was no way to
phrase the question. He faceti
ously commented that he would
be a college professor after a
number of years, so he could
teach students the same kind of
values that he was learning in
society now.
"I don't want to go on with
this interview," he said.
"It would be all right if you
asked me about my plans for
SDS, but I don't want to go into
my personal life. 'Mark Rudd' is
nly a name and I don't want to
p rp trate the image of 'Mark
P.udd' the way the press has
1 n 'oing it all along."
' Why aro you in SDS and
g v ng public speeches if you
don't want to see your image
perpetrated?" I asked.

c mment d, smiling, as if
' w .nt 'd mo to smil", too. Mark
• • .plainej that he had a busy
chrdulc and was supposed to
]■ avc shortly for San Francisco.
He looked up at several per
sons in the auditorium. His

voice carried that facetious
sound again. .
"I'm not Mark Rudd," he said.
He pointed to a eoiripanion.
"That's Mark Rudd. She's wear
ing a mask and different clothes,
and she goes around talking like
me. When the press writes
about Mark Rudd, they write
about her."
His comment made me think
about the pages of newspaper
commentary on the Columbia
demonstrations, the detailed ac
counts of rebel leaders, and the
names that won't be soon for
gotten.
He smiled again. "There really
isn't any 'Mark Rudd' after all."
After most of the questions
had been asked, the auditorium
almost empty, Mark Rudd, guest
speaker for the SDS program in
Memorial Auditorium and lead
er of Columbia's demonstrations
last May, found a short oppor
tunity to rest.
He was seated in a chair by
the aisle. I noticed he was wear
ing a maroon knit shirt, similar
to one he had been photographed
wearing in last spring's NEWS
WEEK. With vivid phrases the
article described the Columbia
demonstrations and the accom
panying photograph made him
look like an orator shouting a

harangue to masses of students.
"Hi, I'm Mark," he said, smil
ing to me. I identified myself as
a DAILY reporter.
He told me he was 21 years
old, from New York, and that
he entered Columbia University
with the intention of becoming
a history major.
"Do you intend to go back to
school?" I asked. He said he
might, but that he was more
concerned with SDS at the mo
ment.
"What are your plans if you
lon't graduate?"
"Why do you have to gradu
