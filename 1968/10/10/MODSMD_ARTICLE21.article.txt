## Football Fever 
### Gary Cavalli 
There's an unfamiliar aura of excitement noticeable at Stanford
&ls week. It's the type of excitement that Inspires banners in fra
ternity windows, signs painted on the pavement, and printed slo
gans pinned on shirt pockets. It's the type of excitement that only
a winning football team can inspire.
For the first time since Orville and Wilbur Wright took off from
K!tty Hawk, Stanford's football team is ranked nationally. The
ISth-ranked Indians are undefeated after three games, and they
have the type of young, explosive team that may go on winning
for two more years.
But this Saturday the bubble may burst when O. J. Simpson
visits Stanford Stadium for the first time. Simpson and his USC
Cohorts are currently rated second In the country, and will be 9-
p&lnt favorites to end the Tribe's unbeaten skein.
Simpson is not the entire USC team—he Is just most of It. The
Trojans have scored 10 touchdowns this year, and Simpson has
nine of them. They have 737 yards rushing, and Simpson has
gained 588 of them. They have completed 36 passes, and Simpson
has caught eight of them.
Statistics like these lead Stanford tight end Bob Moore to say
"USC has only got one man. If ysu stop him, you've got it made."
Indians Smell Success
Moore, along with every other man on the Indian football team,
belffeves Stanford is going to win Saturday afternoon.
"I really think we'll beat USC," Mooro said after Stanford's 24-13
win over Air Force last week. "We should be able to move against
them. Their secondary won't be any better than Air Force's."
"We'll give 'em a hell of a fight," grinned split end Jack Lasater
following the Air Force game, his best of the season. "I doubt if
their defense will be any better than the one we faced today."
Defensive back Dick Oliver admitted he "can hardly wait for the
USC game." Asked if he thought the Indians had a chance to beat
the Trojans, Dick replied "Definitely, we've got a real good chance."
Perhaps the most soft-spoken man on the Tribe team is the one
who will have the greatest burden of pressure on his shoulders
Saturday, quarterback Jim Plunkett.
Plunkett feels that the Indians gained confidence and momentum
in the Air Force game last week, but knows he must direct the
offense to paydirt several times Saturday if the Tribe is to upset
USC.
"We can't hope to shut off USC," Plunkett commented last week,
"to we're going to have to score a lot of points to win."
Optimistic Alums Chip In
. l*he optimism doesn't end with the football team. Five checks
lor $22.50 arrived at the Athletic Department early this week. An
accompanying note explained that the checks, sent by five Stanford
alumni, are to be used to pay for the five footballs that the Indians
will throw into the stands after they score touchdowns Saturday
afternoon.
The five donors—John D. Banks, Richard Farmer, Joseph W.
Mell, Richard Oakley and James Stephenson—may be a little opti
mistic in hoping for five touchdowns. We think four would be more
realistic. The score should be in the neighborhood of 28-24, as
Stanford takes the first big step towards Pasadena.
