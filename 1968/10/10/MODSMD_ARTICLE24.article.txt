# RAs, TAs Gain Staff Parking
## 
### ANN DENTON 
Reading the fine print of the
newest edition of the parking
information leaflet, Yale Braun
stein, LASSU Speaker, discov
ered a significant change in uni
versity parking regulations. This
year for the first time all teach
ing and research assistants have
staff parking privileges.
This is going to save TA's and
RA's the ten dollar registration
fee required of them previously
when classified as students. It
will also give them staff immu
nity from police action on un
paid parking tickets.
Unfortunately the change will
not make it any easier for TA's
and RA's to park, since the Uni
versity has not relabeled any
lots for the staff, and this new
move will nearly double the
number of staff cars.
Decision Made
The decision originated in the
Business Office. Dan DeYoung,
of the Business Office, said, "It
was approved that those people
who needed to park their cars
in performance of their job
shouldn't have to pay registra
tion fees."
This important decision, how
ever, was never publicized. Yale
Braunstein discovered the
change and through the Daily
spread the news that TA's and
RA's would have their ten dol
lars refunded.
They must first apply for a
staff sticker by contacting their
department secretaries. After
the police have processed the ap
plications, they may pick up

their refunds at the police de
partment near Tresidder Union.
The fact that the administra
tion didn't announce this change,
has caused the mix-up. Braun
stein complains that there are
"people up there making rules
about situations that affect stu
dents and then not telling a soul.
Even in this case, where the Ad
ministration has done something
good, they've botched it up."
Numbers Problem
The parking situation also in
volves a problem of numbers.
There are 9,336 cars registered
on campus and 10,180 parking
spaces. However, one-fifth of
these spaces are in the Stanford
Medical Center parking lot,
nearly one mile away from the
center of campus.
Add to this the over 1000
teaching and research assistants
who have just been granted
parking privileges in reserved
areas and it looks like trouble.
Trouble is coming from an
other direction. There are more
than 3000 unpaid parking tickets
among faculty and 1200 among
students remaining from 1967-
68.
The tickets issued on campus
are called Stanford tickets. Only
the University can enforce their
payment. While student viola
tions were very effectively en
forced by registration being held
up until payment, the University
administered no action against
employees who did not pay.
Student Appeal
Any student who had a legiti

mate excuse was allowed to ap
peal to the Student Judicial '
Council, after paying his fine.
If the excuse was accepted by
the Council, the police returned
the money.
Still, until the case of Gil
Berkley, students were discrimi
nated against. Berkley appealed
to the Council on the grounds
that faculty weren't forced to
pay for their violations, so stu
dents shouldn't have to pay for
theirs.
The Council then announced
that it would not enforce any
parking violations against stu
dents unless the University en
forced them against employees.
Faced with such widespread
disregard for university park
ing regulations, Acting Presi
dent Robert J. Glaser has
formed a 12-man committee of
faculty, administration, and stu
dents to try to resolve this issue.

The Council then announced
that it would not enforce any
parking violations against stu
dents unless the University en
forced them against employees.
Faced with such widespread
disregard for university park
ing regulations, Acting Presi
dent Robert J. Glaser has
formed a 12-man committee of
faculty, administration, and stu
dents to try to resolve this issue.
Reading the fine print of the
newest edition of the parking
information leaflet, Yale Braun
stein, LASSU Speaker, discov
ered a significant change in uni
versity parking regulations. This
year for the first time all teach
ing and research assistants have
staff parking privileges.
This is going to save TA's and
RA's the ten dollar registration
fee required of them previously
when classified as students. It
will also give them staff immu
nity from police action on un
paid parking tickets.
Unfortunately the change will
not make it any easier for TA's
and RA's to park, since the Uni
versity has not relabeled any
lots for the staff, and this new
move will nearly double the
number of staff cars.
Decision Made
The decision originated in the
Business Office. Dan DeYoung,
of the Business Office, said, "It
was approved that those people
who needed to park their cars
in performance of their job
shouldn't have to pay registra
tion fees."
This important decision, how
ever, was never publicized. Yale
Braunstein discovered the
change and through the Daily
spread the news that TA's and
RA's would have their ten dol
lars refunded.
They must first apply for a
staff sticker by contacting their
department secretaries. After
the police have processed the ap
plications, they may pick up

their refunds at the police de
partment near Tresidder Union.
The fact that the administra
tion didn't announce this change,
has caused the mix-up. Braun
stein complains that there are
"people up there making rules
about situations that affect stu
dents and then not telling a soul.
Even in this case, where the Ad
ministration has done something
good, they've botched it up."
Numbers Problem
The parking situation also in
volves a problem of numbers.
There are 9,336 cars registered
on campus and 10,180 parking
spaces. However, one-fifth of
these spaces are in the Stanford
Medical Center parking lot,
nearly one mile away from the
center of campus.
Add to this the over 1000
teaching and research assistants
who have just been granted
parking privileges in reserved
areas and it looks like trouble.
Trouble is coming from an
other direction. There are more
than 3000 unpaid parking tickets
among faculty and 1200 among
students remaining from 1967-
68.
The tickets issued on campus
are called Stanford tickets. Only
the University can enforce their
payment. While student viola
tions were very effectively en
forced by registration being held
up until payment, the University
administered no action against
employees who did not pay.
Student Appeal
Any student who had a legiti

mate excuse was allowed to ap
peal to the Student Judicial '
Council, after paying his fine.
If the excuse was accepted by
the Council, the police returned
the money.
Still, until the case of Gil
Berkley, students were discrimi
nated against. Berkley appealed
to the Council on the grounds
that faculty weren't forced to
pay for their violations, so stu
dents shouldn't have to pay for
theirs.
The Council then announced
that it would not enforce any
parking violations against stu
