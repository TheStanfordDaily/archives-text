# Effect On Frats Uncertain
## New Cluster Spurs Diverse Reactions 
### DAVE NOLAN 
"It may have cost $600,000,
but we don't have any curtains,"
mused senior John Tato as he
looked out over the spacious in
ner courtyard of the brand new
Delta Kappa Epsilon house.
The DKE house is one of five
new frat houses in the recently
completed fraternity cluster just
east of Cowell Health Center.
The Dekes, along with Alpha
Sigma Phi, Alpha Tau Omicron,
Chi Psi, and Phi Gamma D~>lta
will formally dedicate the $2.7
million complex at ceremonies
tomorrow at 10:30 aon.

..Despite such bugs
as no curtains, balky light
switches, and swarms of flies,
the general reaction of most of
the frat members to the new
physical plants is one of en
thusiasm and in some cases wild
enthusiasm.
New Frat House is "Palace"
"Compared to our old hole,
this place is a palace," comment
ed Peter Duffy, a junior living
in the now Chi Psi house. "It's
hard getting used to not being
in a firetrap with a 5-minute
burning time."
The houses are indeed quite
liveable. All are built on a simi

lar concept of separation of liv
ing and social and incorp
orate hacienda-like courtyards.
All hav? intercom systems, and
the Chi Psi house evon sports
a special weight-lifting machine.
Understandably, almost no one
laments the passing of the old
houses. Tack d onto the Chi Psi
bulletin board is a color se
quence of snapshots depicting in
grisly detail the demolition of the
old lodge. "But there were no
tears when the lodge came
down," commented Duffy. "The
only tears in that place came
from all the dust in the car
pets."

But not everyone is 100° ft for
the new location
"I miss having trrees and
girls around," sighed Tato, re
m mbTing earlier days on the
Row. "And th" 1 neighbors are al
ready complaining about noise."
The antiseptic moderness and
impersonal sameness of the five
houses also cam* under fire.
"Stanford has put its stamp
on us, all right," said Duffy. "It's
lik > we're all from the same
cooki- 1 cutter."
The effect of the new physi
cal plant touches more than just
the physical comfort of day-to
day living. "The new house has
h >lpod our spirit tremendously,"
commented Chi Psi Andy Van
d?rschoot. "Our attitude is dif
ferent. We used to flick cigarette
butts on the floor in the old
place. Now we want to keep the
house spotless."

new physical plants great

brand new house is obvious but
each of the five houses in the
cluster is faced with a challenge
of selling themselves in competi

"Th ra buildings are physically
all the same," explained Chi Psi
president Dave Bonde. "It all
depends on people. Our only sell
ing point is the guys in the
house." He added with a laugh,
"And maybe our weight ma

house members. "We'll end up

Vanderschoot.
A few members were suspic
ious of the University's motives
in retaining ownership of the
houses, fearing that a possible
"takeover" or "phasing out" of
the fraternity system was the
long-range plan. They pointed
out the ease with which the
whole complex could be convert
ed to a co-ed dormitory system.
Frat System Strengthened
On the contrary, the general
feeling among cluster residents
was that the new complex great
ly strengthened the fraternity

system at Stanford. It enabled
all five houses to substantially
increase their membership, and
at the same time build up house
spirit and unity.
"Dean Williams has assured
me that there is definitely no
phase-out planned," asserted Chi
Psi president Bonde.
A member of the Deke house
summed up the general feeling
pretty succinctly as he gazed out
over the courtyard. "It's some
thing new, something to adjust
to. Whether it's better than the
old way is debatable. I guess
we won't know for a few years
yet."

Vanderschoot.
A few members were suspic
ious of the University's motives
in retaining ownership of the
houses, fearing that a possible
"takeover" or "phasing out" of
the fraternity system was the
long-range plan. They pointed
out the ease with which the
whole complex could be convert
ed to a co-ed dormitory system.
Frat System Strengthened
On the contrary, the general
feeling among cluster residents
was that the new complex great
ly strengthened the fraternity

system at Stanford. It enabled
all five houses to substantially
increase their membership, and
at the same time build up house
spirit and unity.
"Dean Williams has assured
me that there is definitely no
phase-out planned," asserted Chi
Psi president Bonde.
A member of the Deke house
summed up the general feeling
pretty succinctly as he gazed out
over the courtyard. "It's some
thing new, something to adjust
to. Whether it's better than the
old way is debatable. I guess
we won't know for a few years
yet."
"It may have cost $600,000,
but we don't have any curtains,"
mused senior John Tato as he
looked out over the spacious in
ner courtyard of the brand new
Delta Kappa Epsilon house.
The DKE house is one of five
new frat houses in the recently
completed fraternity cluster just
east of Cowell Health Center.
The Dekes, along with Alpha
Sigma Phi, Alpha Tau Omicron,
Chi Psi, and Phi Gamma D~>lta
will formally dedicate the $2.7
million complex at ceremonies
tomorrow at 10:30 aon.

..Despite such bugs
as no curtains, balky light
switches, and swarms of flies,
the general reaction of most of
the frat members to the new
physical plants is one of en
thusiasm and in some cases wild
enthusiasm.
New Frat House is "Palace"
"Compared to our old hole,
this place is a palace," comment
ed Peter Duffy, a junior living
in the now Chi Psi house. "It's
hard getting used to not being
in a firetrap with a 5-minute
burning time."
The houses are indeed quite
liveable. All are built on a simi

lar concept of separation of liv
ing and social and incorp
orate hacienda-like courtyards.
All hav? intercom systems, and
the Chi Psi house evon sports
a special weight-lifting machine.
Understandably, almost no one
laments the passing of the old
houses. Tack d onto the Chi Psi
bulletin board is a color se
quence of snapshots depicting in
grisly detail the demolition of the
old lodge. "But there were no
tears when the lodge came
down," commented Duffy. "The
only tears in that place came
from all the dust in the car
pets."

But not everyone is 100° ft for

Frat System Strengthened
On the contrary, the general
feeling among cluster residents
was that the new complex great
ly strengthened the fraternity

system at Stanford. It enabled
all five houses to substantially
increase their membership, and
at the same time build up house
spirit and unity.
"Dean Williams has assured
me that there is definitely no
phase-out planned," asserted Chi
Psi president Bonde.
A member of the Deke house
summed up the general feeling
pretty succinctly as he gazed out
over the courtyard. "It's some
thing new, something to adjust
to. Whether it's better than the
old way is debatable. I guess
we won't know for a few years
yet."
"It may have cost $600,000,
but we don't have any curtains,"
mused senior John Tato as he
looked out over the spacious in
ner courtyard of the brand new
Delta Kappa Epsilon house.
The DKE house is one of five
new frat houses in the recently
completed fraternity cluster just
east of Cowell Health Center.
The Dekes, along with Alpha
Sigma Phi, Alpha Tau Omicron,
Chi Psi, and Phi Gamma D~>lta
will formally dedicate the $2.7
million complex at ceremonies
tomorrow at 10:30 aon.

..Despite such bugs
as no curtains, balky light
switches, and swarms of flies,
the general reaction of most of
the frat members to the new
physical plants is one of en
thusiasm and in some cases wild
enthusiasm.
New Frat House is "Palace"
"Compared to our old hole,
this place is a palace," comment
ed Peter Duffy, a junior living
in the now Chi Psi house. "It's
hard getting used to not being
in a firetrap with a 5-minute
burning time."
The houses are indeed quite
liveable. All are built on a simi

lar concept of separation of liv
ing and social and incorp
orate hacienda-like courtyards.
All hav? intercom systems, and
the Chi Psi house evon sports
a special weight-lifting machine.
Understandably, almost no one
laments the passing of the old
houses. Tack d onto the Chi Psi
bulletin board is a color se
quence of snapshots depicting in
grisly detail the demolition of the
old lodge. "But there were no
tears when the lodge came
down," commented Duffy. "The
only tears in that place came
from all the dust in the car
pets."

But not everyone is 100° ft for
the new location
"I miss having trrees and
girls around," sighed Tato, re
m mbTing earlier days on the
Row. "And th" 1 neighbors are al
ready complaining about noise."
The antiseptic moderness and
impersonal sameness of the five
houses also cam* under fire.
"Stanford has put its stamp
on us, all right," said Duffy. "It's
lik > we're all from the same
cooki- 1 cutter."
The effect of the new physi
cal plant touches more than just
the physical comfort of day-to
day living. "The new house has
h >lpod our spirit tremendously,"
commented Chi Psi Andy Van
d?rschoot. "Our attitude is dif
ferent. We used to flick cigarette
butts on the floor in the old
place. Now we want to keep the
house spotless."

"Th ra buildings are physically

president Dave Bonde. "It all

Vanderschoot.
A few members were suspic

in retaining ownership of the
houses, fearing that a possible
"takeover" or "phasing out" of
the fraternity system was the
long-range plan. They pointed
out the ease with which the
