# 'Revolution Will Eliminate Institutions Which Seek To Exploit People': Rudd
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
"SDS is trying to develop a
mass movement and eventually
create a majority revolution,"
declared Mark Rudd, leader of
the student strike that rocked
Columbia University last spring.
Speaking yesterday to a Me
morial Auditorium audience of
350, Rudd added that he couldn't
predict the outcome, but that
institutions which exploit the
people would be eliminated.
Rudd's talk followed a 45 min
ute film on the Columbia strike.
He answered questions from the
floor instead of giving a formal
speech.
Referring to the present situa
tion at Columbia, Rudd, who is
no longer a student there, stated
that the people now know the
issues, and the stakes are high
er. The administration will not
give up, and it's a question of
whether or not the students are
ready to sacrifice their careers.
Rudd is touring the U.S. to see
how the movement is doing and
to spread the"truth about Co
lumbia." He plans more travel
ing in the future. Rudd also
plans to continue his work with
SDS and develop a regional
group in the New York area.

Rudd said that new issues
have been raised but he couldn't
predict what would happen. He
said, however, "I don't think the
university will be closed down."
When questioned about the
results of the Columbia strike,
Rudd replied, "We partially won
some of our demands." On the
restructuring of the university,
Rudd said, "very little has been
done. It doesn't matter," he con
tinued, "it wasn't the radical's
goal; it was the liberal's.
"There is going to be a tre
mendous push to talk about the
structuring and not the function
of the university," said Rudd. !
University's Function
"What has been the function
of a university?" asked Rudd.
"To produce trained personnel
for the government, military and
business — to keep the system
going," he answered. Rudd stat
ed that the universities are not
places of value-free Inquiry, are
not neutral, and are not the
centers of critical thought that
they should be.
He stated that Columbia stu
dents were standing up In class
to challenge their professors on
course content, and that some
attempt was also being made
to set up counter-classes.

Asked to comment on the re
cent demand made by the Stan
ford SDS that the university dis
associate itself with Southeast
Asia, Rudd stated, "They're a
lot more advanced than ours.
Yours go right to the heart of
the problem. They can't be met
without a complete reconstruct
ing of the university and a trans
fer of power."
When pressed on Stanford is
sues and organizations, Rudd
finally stated, "I don't know."
Through the Looking Glass
Asked what he thought about
the Stanford SDS, Rudd replied,
~They're working hard on get
ting the issues across and are
well organized. I'm impressed
by Through the Looking Glass,"
a recent SDS guide to Stanford
and it's environs.
Commenting on Stanford,
Rudd said, "Stanford, with its
SRI, is much more a Columbia,
with what it does, than Colum
bia."
Strike Film
A film on the Columbia strike

was shown before Rudd's ap
pearance. Produced by News
reel, a New York underground
group, showed various aspects
of the events that occurred be
fore, after and during the strike
from an anti - administration
viewpoint. There was scattered
applause from the audience of
350 at several points in the nar
ration.
The film concluded with the
walkout of much of the gradu
ating class at commencement
last May and with the words,
"students refuse to be produced
any longer."
In his remarks after the film,
Rudd charged that Columbia and
the police were trying to down
play the importance of the
events and use the courts to
silence the leaders of the strike.
When asked to comment on
the fire which destroyed the
manuscript of a professor's book
in a student-occupied building,
Rudd answered, "We left that
building ten minutes before the

fire. I'm not going to say who
started the fire, but the building
was in the hands of the police."
Rudd also commented on his
recent trip to Cuba, saying that
despite Drew Pearson's charge
that he had received "instruc
tion," all he did was "look at
cows, ride around in buses and
talk to people."
"I didn't learn anything about
the Communist Party that is ap
plicable in America," added
Rudd.
In an earlier interview, Rudd
asserted that FBI reports that
workshops at the SDS conven
tion last summer at Michigan
techniques of sabotage wore "a
lie. It's an effort to make us
look like a small, nihilist, terror
ist fringe group."
Rudd explained that SDS's
programs are not meant to cause
mass destruction, although, he
added, "It wouldn't be a bad
thing. I think it would be a
visible demonstrations of the
present situation."

university will be closed down."
When questioned about the
results of the Columbia strike,
Rudd replied, "We partially won
some of our demands." On the
restructuring of the university,
Rudd said, "very little has been
done. It doesn't matter," he con
tinued, "it wasn't the radical's
goal; it was the liberal's.
"There is going to be a tre
mendous push to talk about the
structuring and not the function
of the university," said Rudd. !
University's Function
"What has been the function
of a university?" asked Rudd.
"To produce trained personnel
for the government, military and
business — to keep the system
going," he answered. Rudd stat
ed that the universities are not
places of value-free Inquiry, are
not neutral, and are not the
centers of critical thought that
they should be.
He stated that Columbia stu
dents were standing up In class
to challenge their professors on
course content, and that some
attempt was also being made
to set up counter-classes.

Asked to comment on the re
cent demand made by the Stan
ford SDS that the university dis
associate itself with Southeast
Asia, Rudd stated, "They're a
lot more advanced than ours.
Yours go right to the heart of
the problem. They can't be met
without a complete reconstruct
ing of the university and a trans
fer of power."
When pressed on Stanford is
sues and organizations, Rudd
finally stated, "I don't know."
Through the Looking Glass
Asked what he thought about
the Stanford SDS, Rudd replied,
~They're working hard on get
ting the issues across and are
well organized. I'm impressed
by Through the Looking Glass,"
a recent SDS guide to Stanford
and it's environs.
Commenting on Stanford,
Rudd said, "Stanford, with its
SRI, is much more a Columbia,
with what it does, than Colum
bia."
Strike Film
A film on the Columbia strike

was shown before Rudd's ap
pearance. Produced by News
reel, a New York underground
group, showed various aspects
of the events that occurred be
fore, after and during the strike
from an anti - administration
viewpoint. There was scattered
applause from the audience of
350 at several points in the nar
ration.
The film concluded with the
walkout of much of the gradu
ating class at commencement
last May and with the words,
"students refuse to be produced
any longer."
In his remarks after the film,
Rudd charged that Columbia and
the police were trying to down
play the importance of the
events and use the courts to
silence the leaders of the strike.
When asked to comment on
the fire which destroyed the
manuscript of a professor's book
in a student-occupied building,
Rudd answered, "We left that
building ten minutes before the

fire. I'm not going to say who
started the fire, but the building
was in the hands of the police."
Rudd also commented on his
recent trip to Cuba, saying that
despite Drew Pearson's charge
that he had received "instruc
tion," all he did was "look at
cows, ride around in buses and
talk to people."
"I didn't learn anything about
the Communist Party that is ap
plicable in America," added
Rudd.
In an earlier interview, Rudd
asserted that FBI reports that
workshops at the SDS conven
tion last summer at Michigan
techniques of sabotage wore "a
lie. It's an effort to make us
look like a small, nihilist, terror
ist fringe group."
Rudd explained that SDS's
programs are not meant to cause
mass destruction, although, he
added, "It wouldn't be a bad
thing. I think it would be a
visible demonstrations of the
present situation."
"SDS is trying to develop a
mass movement and eventually
create a majority revolution,"
declared Mark Rudd, leader of
the student strike that rocked
Columbia University last spring.
Speaking yesterday to a Me
morial Auditorium audience of
350, Rudd added that he couldn't
predict the outcome, but that
institutions which exploit the
people would be eliminated.
Rudd's talk followed a 45 min
ute film on the Columbia strike.
He answered questions from the
floor instead of giving a formal
speech.
Referring to the present situa
tion at Columbia, Rudd, who is
no longer a student there, stated
that the people now know the
issues, and the stakes are high
er. The administration will not
give up, and it's a question of
whether or not the students are
ready to sacrifice their careers.
Rudd is touring the U.S. to see
how the movement is doing and
to spread the"truth about Co
lumbia." He plans more travel
ing in the future. Rudd also
plans to continue his work with
SDS and develop a regional
group in the New York area.

Rudd said that new issues
have been raised but he couldn't
predict what would happen. He

the problem. They can't be met
without a complete reconstruct
ing of the university and a trans
fer of power."
When pressed on Stanford is
sues and organizations, Rudd
finally stated, "I don't know."
Through the Looking Glass
Asked what he thought about
the Stanford SDS, Rudd replied,
~They're working hard on get
ting the issues across and are
well organized. I'm impressed
by Through the Looking Glass,"
a recent SDS guide to Stanford
and it's environs.
Commenting on Stanford,
Rudd said, "Stanford, with its
SRI, is much more a Columbia,
with what it does, than Colum
bia."
Strike Film
A film on the Columbia strike

was shown before Rudd's ap
pearance. Produced by News
reel, a New York underground
group, showed various aspects
of the events that occurred be
fore, after and during the strike
from an anti - administration
viewpoint. There was scattered
applause from the audience of
350 at several points in the nar
ration.
The film concluded with the
walkout of much of the gradu
ating class at commencement
last May and with the words,
"students refuse to be produced
any longer."
In his remarks after the film,
Rudd charged that Columbia and
the police were trying to down
play the importance of the
events and use the courts to
silence the leaders of the strike.
When asked to comment on
the fire which destroyed the
manuscript of a professor's book
in a student-occupied building,
Rudd answered, "We left that
building ten minutes before the

fire. I'm not going to say who
started the fire, but the building
was in the hands of the police."
Rudd also commented on his
recent trip to Cuba, saying that
despite Drew Pearson's charge
that he had received "instruc
tion," all he did was "look at
cows, ride around in buses and
talk to people."
"I didn't learn anything about
the Communist Party that is ap
plicable in America," added
Rudd.
In an earlier interview, Rudd
asserted that FBI reports that
workshops at the SDS conven
tion last summer at Michigan
techniques of sabotage wore "a
lie. It's an effort to make us
look like a small, nihilist, terror
ist fringe group."
Rudd explained that SDS's
programs are not meant to cause
mass destruction, although, he
added, "It wouldn't be a bad
thing. I think it would be a
visible demonstrations of the
present situation."
"SDS is trying to develop a
mass movement and eventually
create a majority revolution,"
declared Mark Rudd, leader of
the student strike that rocked
Columbia University last spring.
Speaking yesterday to a Me
morial Auditorium audience of
350, Rudd added that he couldn't
predict the outcome, but that
institutions which exploit the
people would be eliminated.
Rudd's talk followed a 45 min
ute film on the Columbia strike.
He answered questions from the
floor instead of giving a formal
speech.
Referring to the present situa
tion at Columbia, Rudd, who is
no longer a student there, stated
that the people now know the
issues, and the stakes are high
er. The administration will not
give up, and it's a question of
whether or not the students are
ready to sacrifice their careers.
Rudd is touring the U.S. to see
how the movement is doing and
to spread the"truth about Co
lumbia." He plans more travel
ing in the future. Rudd also
plans to continue his work with
SDS and develop a regional
group in the New York area.

Rudd said that new issues
have been raised but he couldn't
predict what would happen. He
said, however, "I don't think the
university will be closed down."
When questioned about the
results of the Columbia strike,
Rudd replied, "We partially won
some of our demands." On the
restructuring of the university,
Rudd said, "very little has been
done. It doesn't matter," he con
tinued, "it wasn't the radical's
goal; it was the liberal's.
"There is going to be a tre
mendous push to talk about the
structuring and not the function
of the university," said Rudd. !
University's Function
"What has been the function
of a university?" asked Rudd.
"To produce trained personnel
for the government, military and
business — to keep the system
going," he answered. Rudd stat
ed that the universities are not
places of value-free Inquiry, are
not neutral, and are not the
centers of critical thought that
they should be.
He stated that Columbia stu
dents were standing up In class
to challenge their professors on
course content, and that some
attempt was also being made
to set up counter-classes.

Asked to comment on the re
cent demand made by the Stan
ford SDS that the university dis
associate itself with Southeast
Asia, Rudd stated, "They're a
lot more advanced than ours.
Yours go right to the heart of
the problem. They can't be met
without a complete reconstruct
ing of the university and a trans
fer of power."
