# Udall Sees Population Rise As Threat To Our Society
## 
### CICELY BATES 
Secretary of the Interior Stew
art L. Udall urged all America
to "multiply its productive ca
pacity by its reproductive re
straint," in an address given last
night in Memorial Auditorium.
Udall spoke as part of the stu
dent-run Stanford Population
Environment Forum (SPEF) se
ries dedicated to spotlight the
relationship between man and
his environment and to bring
speakers to the campus who are
experts in the field.
Udall was greeted by an en
thusiastic audience of about 1500
persons. There were no demon
strations, and the audience was
eagerly responsive to Udall and
his arguments. The Secretary
deviated from his prepared
speech at times, to give the topic
a more personal touch with
anecdotes and stories of his own
experiences in the field of con
servation.
Udall's topic was "Is There a
Population Problem?" and the
Secretary felt that there defi
nitely was. He bluntly stated
that "if we double our numbers,
there will be only half as much
water per person. The same is
true of our foodstuffs, park
lands, air and physical space."
Mass Production Stressed
Since the end of World War
11, America has stressed mass
production, contended Udall.
"Our interest was in the conver
sion of Industry, not the recrea
tion of society," he lamented.
Because of our "ability to mass
produce, market, and construct,"
Udall pronounced that now "we
are caught up, at last in the
profligacy of our plenty."
To correct this situation Udall
stated that man should be care
ful not to "apply cosmetics when
it is surgery that is quite neces
sary." Looking to the govern
ment, Udall said that the coun
try's leadership "will have to
examine the total system by

which our Industry, economy,
and society transform energy
and materials from ground re
sources to finished products . . .
to ultimate use ... to final dis
posal."
Birth Control Advocated
Attacking the population prob
lem itself, Udall advocated that
the government take "action at
all levels to make both informa
tion and birth control devices
available to all of our people."
He reasoned, "As to population,
less will mean more."
If such a "grow-slow" society
could be created, man could
"bring our land-man equation
into balance" and such a "rear
rangement of our physical en
vironment could help solve many
of our social dilemmas."
Immediate consequences of
such a slow-growth society
would be "a diminuation of the
pressures we have lived with so
long . . . pressures to build more
houses instead of more livable
communities . . . pressures to
build highways instead of inte
grated transportation systems
. . . pressures to build more
classrooms instead of education
al excellence."
Conservation Would Erase
"Blemishes"
The conservation of the na
tion's natural resources, man
himself, and his environment
would help erase the "blemishes
on our escutcheon," he said.
Such issues as racial discord
and urban decay, and more spe
cifically, divorce, delinquency,
and unhappiness can be allevi
ated in "a new burst of creative
energy and idealism," stated
Udall optimistically.
"The worth of a society or of
a civilization is measured by the
quality of life it offers its citi
zens," he said. To achieve a bet
ter quality of life for its citizens,
Udall hoped America would re
ject the "outgrown and danger
ous growth gospel that all eco

nomic growth is next to Godli
ness." "The key to the future is
not our resources, but our re
sourcefulness and resiliency," he
emphasized.
Must Begin Human Planning:
"The bright uplands of a bet
ter world will not come into
view until we bring population
and human planning into bal
ance," he warned. America is
soon to enter its third century
of existence. Udall hoped that it
would do so keeping three es
sential quality-of-life maxims
foremost in its mind: "Bigger is
not better, Slower is faster, Less
is more."
During a short question and
answer period following his ad
dress, Udall admitted to the
evenly divided student and adult
audience that many of his re
marks were being said as he was
"going out the door" of his Cab
inet office. Udall also stated to
the receptive audience that the
idea of population control was
not a part of present political
dialogues because the idea was
still new.
