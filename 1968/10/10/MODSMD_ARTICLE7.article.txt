With the possible exception of having Maoist profes
sor Bruce Franklin machine gunned to death at the
hands of ex-Nazi army officers hired by Board of Trus
tees member David Packer, the radical Left at Stanford
couldn't have asked for a better issue to mobilize stu
dent support around than the selection of Kenneth
Pitzer as the next president of this university.
Just as the excesses of the Chicago police combined
with the steam roller nomination of Hubert Humphrey
at the Democratic convention served to confirm the
most incisive radical critique about the inflexibility of
the American system, so too the choice of Pitzor to
succeed Wallace Sterling seemingly serves to substan
tiate the Left wing's most paranoiac ravings abuut
Stanford's relationship to the innately evil "military
industrial complex."
As everyone who has read the muckracking SDS
C u.lents for a Society) p unphlet ... ocan
fc i hould know, Mr. Pitzer has served capably in a
number of distinguished positions in the fields of edu
cation and government such as director of research
for the Atomic Energy Commission and president of
Rice University. If his numerous contacts in govern
ment and the military were not enough to condemn
him in the eyes of those whose perfected vision of a
university president would be a hybrid cross between

Steve Weissman, Joseph Stalin and Tiny Tim, SDS
also has provided us with the startling fact that some
of Mr. Pitzer's best friends at Rice were (gasp!) busi
nessmen.
The essential thrust of the SDS analysis Is that Mr.
Pitzer, given his background, symbolizes all those qual
ities of industry, finance and the military which every
good radical abhors. Now for those of us who remain
naively skeptical about this whole matter of Stanford
Research Institute, the University's relationship to the
war and indeed Mr. Pitzer's qualifications to oversee
such an institution as Stanford, there remains the nag
ging suspicion that what we are watching emerge on
this campus is the most vile form of witch-hunting that
America has endured since the era of Joe McCarthy.
The most recent SDS demands that members of the
administration and faculty reveal the financial details
of their personal affairs so that the Left can ferret out
and identify those whose connections or holdings in
business might appear sinister is symptomatic of the
type of mentality which perceives business as having
some mysterious hold on the operations of the univer
sity and perhaps the country.
During the McCarthy years, it was an individual's
association with a Communist front group that was
cause for suspicion, today, if you happen to be a
stockholder, watch out. In the topsy-turvy world of

the radical Left it's neither the Black Panthers nor the
Communist party that is the menace, it's the local
Chamber of Commerce. SDS' conspiracy theory which
views the Board of Trustees, Pitzer, SRI and the mili
tary as being all bound up in some type of plot to
make money off the war in Vietnam is similar to those
conspiracy theories of history forwarded by Robert
Welch and the John Birch Society.
The warning of SDS should be clear to all of us:
Before you go to sleep at night be sure to check under
your bod iust in case thorp's a businessman lurking
about hoping to make a profit off your snoring.
If academic freedom is to survive at Stanford then
we cannot tolerate the indigenous form of McCarthy
ism now developing, the intimidation of faculty and
administration nor the veiled threats of violence which
characterize the demands and rhetoric of SDS. It may
well be that when Mr. Pitzer arrives in December that
he will be judged not by his past record but by his
dedication to preserving the free pursuit of knowledge
and the right of students to hold views and opinions
divergent from those of Che Guevara. As far as I'm
concerned the only reason we have to worry about
Mr. Pitzer is not that he has friends who are business
men but the fact that he voted for Lyndon Johnson
in 1964.

The most recent SDS demands that members of the
administration and faculty reveal the financial details
of their personal affairs so that the Left can ferret out
and identify those whose connections or holdings in
business might appear sinister is symptomatic of the
type of mentality which perceives business as having
some mysterious hold on the operations of the univer
sity and perhaps the country.
During the McCarthy years, it was an individual's
association with a Communist front group that was
cause for suspicion, today, if you happen to be a
stockholder, watch out. In the topsy-turvy world of

the radical Left it's neither the Black Panthers nor the
Communist party that is the menace, it's the local
Chamber of Commerce. SDS' conspiracy theory which
views the Board of Trustees, Pitzer, SRI and the mili
tary as being all bound up in some type of plot to
make money off the war in Vietnam is similar to those
conspiracy theories of history forwarded by Robert
Welch and the John Birch Society.
The warning of SDS should be clear to all of us:
Before you go to sleep at night be sure to check under
your bod iust in case thorp's a businessman lurking
about hoping to make a profit off your snoring.
If academic freedom is to survive at Stanford then
we cannot tolerate the indigenous form of McCarthy
ism now developing, the intimidation of faculty and
administration nor the veiled threats of violence which
characterize the demands and rhetoric of SDS. It may
well be that when Mr. Pitzer arrives in December that
he will be judged not by his past record but by his
dedication to preserving the free pursuit of knowledge
and the right of students to hold views and opinions
divergent from those of Che Guevara. As far as I'm
concerned the only reason we have to worry about
Mr. Pitzer is not that he has friends who are business
men but the fact that he voted for Lyndon Johnson
in 1964.
With the possible exception of having Maoist profes
sor Bruce Franklin machine gunned to death at the
hands of ex-Nazi army officers hired by Board of Trus
tees member David Packer, the radical Left at Stanford
couldn't have asked for a better issue to mobilize stu
dent support around than the selection of Kenneth
Pitzer as the next president of this university.
Just as the excesses of the Chicago police combined
with the steam roller nomination of Hubert Humphrey
at the Democratic convention served to confirm the
most incisive radical critique about the inflexibility of
the American system, so too the choice of Pitzor to
succeed Wallace Sterling seemingly serves to substan
tiate the Left wing's most paranoiac ravings abuut
Stanford's relationship to the innately evil "military
industrial complex."
As everyone who has read the muckracking SDS
C u.lents for a Society) p unphlet ... ocan
fc i hould know, Mr. Pitzer has served capably in a
number of distinguished positions in the fields of edu
cation and government such as director of research
for the Atomic Energy Commission and president of
Rice University. If his numerous contacts in govern
ment and the military were not enough to condemn
him in the eyes of those whose perfected vision of a
university president would be a hybrid cross between

Steve Weissman, Joseph Stalin and Tiny Tim, SDS
also has provided us with the startling fact that some
of Mr. Pitzer's best friends at Rice were (gasp!) busi
nessmen.
The essential thrust of the SDS analysis Is that Mr.
Pitzer, given his background, symbolizes all those qual
ities of industry, finance and the military which every
good radical abhors. Now for those of us who remain
naively skeptical about this whole matter of Stanford
Research Institute, the University's relationship to the
war and indeed Mr. Pitzer's qualifications to oversee
such an institution as Stanford, there remains the nag
ging suspicion that what we are watching emerge on
this campus is the most vile form of witch-hunting that
America has endured since the era of Joe McCarthy.
