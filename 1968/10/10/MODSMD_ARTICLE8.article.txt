# Letters To The Editor
## Packer's Objection 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
There are several factual in
accuracies in the unsigned story
entitled SES Report Under Early
Attack? that appeared in this
morning's Daily. The most dis
tressing is one that quotes me
as saying that "Halsey Royden,
acting dean of Hand S, asked
for a copy of the dean of under
graduate studies proposal nearly
two weeks ago. Royden said,
according to Packer, that copies
of the draft recommendation
would be circulated to all H
and S faculty members."
The facts are as follows. A
Daily reporter asked me wheth
er any members of the Hand S
Steering Committee had re
ceived copies of the draft pro
posal. I told him that Dean Roy
den had received a copy last
week in his capacity as a mem
ber of the SES Committee on
Government of the University
(which, incidentally, approved
the recommendation in princi
pal on March 15, 1968).
The further facts, which I
hope will set the record straight
on other inaccuracies in this
story, are these: I telephoned
Professor Langmuir, the Chair

man of the Hand S Steering
Committee on Thursday, Octob
er 3, to invite him and the other
members of his group to meet
with members of the SES Steer
ing Committee for a discussion
Joi the SES recommendations
on undergraduate education. In
the course of that conversation,
Professor Langmuir mentioned
that a resolution on the subject
of a dean of undergraduate ed
ucation would be introduced at
the Hand S Assembly meeting
on October 14.
I expressed interest because
of the probable effect of such
a resolution on SES recommen
dations. Professor Langmuir
then asked whether I had avail
able a description of the SES
proposal that could be circulated
with the agenda for the Hand S
Assembly.
I readily agreed to provide one,
because it seemed to me most
unwise for the Hand S As
sembly to debate the resolution
being laid before it by its Steer
ing Committee without knowing
the reasons for the SES recom
mendation.
On the next day, my office re
ceived a draft description, adapt-

Ed from an SES working paper,
to the Hand S Dean's Office
for distribution with the agenda.
At the same time, I sent the
draft description to the mem
bers of the SES Committee on
the Government of the Univer
(Sity, including Dean Royden,
with a covering note explaining
why the draft was being made
available to members of the
Hand S Assembly.
While several members of the
Hand S Steering Committee
have been generally aware for
some time that SES is going to
propose a key role for a Dean
of .Undergraduate Studies, I
have no reason to suppose that
any member of that Committee
(with the exception noted above)
saw the precise text of the pro
jposal before its general dis
tribution to members of the H
and S Assembly with the agenda
for the meeting.
It does seem regrettable that
the Hand S Steering Commit
tee did not take the initiative in
approaching anyone in SES
about their resolution despite its
obvious impact on SES recom
mendations. If we in SES have
fallen into error on the matter
of communications with our
brethren, it seems clear that we
have company in that error.
All of this, while required to
set the record straight, is some
what beside the point. The point
is that the Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies proposal needs to
be discussed on its merits and
without reference to "politics,"
"tactics," or "failures of com
munication."

• Austria Wien
Editor, The DAILY:
I feel sorry for Bill Evers. It
is apparent that the cold-heart
edness of the Austrian people
and the strictness of Dr. Straub
and the administration made
such an impression on him that
he was forced to write only on
these points in his Oct. 8 article.
I am an alumna of Austria V
or Wien I as we proudly call
ourselves. Besides heartily en
joying life in der Seilerstatte,
even though we were in the red
light district as Mr. Evers men
tioned, I had both a Viennese
family and a family at Semmer
ing, the former Austrian cam
pus-site, who I'm sure if Mr.
Evers had taken the time to
visit (their names were on the
list left at the campus of Aus
trian contacts) would have de
stroyed his concept of Austrian
cold-heartedness.
As to the administration of the
Austrian campus—the Straubs
are Viennese people. I spent
many an afternoon in small
cafes with them or in their home
for coffee and talk. . . .
I feel it would be unfortunate
if Mr. Evers' personal opinions
of the operation of the Vienna
campus and the character of the
Austrian people influenced the
decision of very many students
desirous of attending a German
speaking campus. It is apparent
that he did not attempt to in
volve himself enough to come
to enjoy the Austrian way of
life.

on undergraduate education. In
the course of that conversation,
Professor Langmuir mentioned
that a resolution on the subject
of a dean of undergraduate ed
ucation would be introduced at
the Hand S Assembly meeting
on October 14.
I expressed interest because
of the probable effect of such
a resolution on SES recommen
dations. Professor Langmuir
then asked whether I had avail
able a description of the SES
proposal that could be circulated
with the agenda for the Hand S
Assembly.
I readily agreed to provide one,
because it seemed to me most
unwise for the Hand S As
sembly to debate the resolution
being laid before it by its Steer
ing Committee without knowing
the reasons for the SES recom
mendation.
On the next day, my office re
ceived a draft description, adapt-

Ed from an SES working paper,
to the Hand S Dean's Office
for distribution with the agenda.
At the same time, I sent the
draft description to the mem
bers of the SES Committee on
the Government of the Univer
(Sity, including Dean Royden,
with a covering note explaining
why the draft was being made
available to members of the
Hand S Assembly.
While several members of the
Hand S Steering Committee
have been generally aware for
some time that SES is going to
propose a key role for a Dean
of .Undergraduate Studies, I
have no reason to suppose that
any member of that Committee
(with the exception noted above)
saw the precise text of the pro
jposal before its general dis
tribution to members of the H
and S Assembly with the agenda
for the meeting.
It does seem regrettable that
the Hand S Steering Commit
tee did not take the initiative in
approaching anyone in SES
about their resolution despite its
obvious impact on SES recom
mendations. If we in SES have
fallen into error on the matter
of communications with our
brethren, it seems clear that we
have company in that error.
All of this, while required to
set the record straight, is some
what beside the point. The point
is that the Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies proposal needs to
be discussed on its merits and
without reference to "politics,"
"tactics," or "failures of com
munication."

Editor, The DAILY:
I feel sorry for Bill Evers. It
is apparent that the cold-heart
edness of the Austrian people
and the strictness of Dr. Straub
and the administration made
such an impression on him that
he was forced to write only on
these points in his Oct. 8 article.
I am an alumna of Austria V
or Wien I as we proudly call
ourselves. Besides heartily en
joying life in der Seilerstatte,
even though we were in the red
light district as Mr. Evers men
tioned, I had both a Viennese
family and a family at Semmer
ing, the former Austrian cam
pus-site, who I'm sure if Mr.
Evers had taken the time to
visit (their names were on the
list left at the campus of Aus
trian contacts) would have de
stroyed his concept of Austrian
cold-heartedness.
As to the administration of the
Austrian campus—the Straubs
are Viennese people. I spent
many an afternoon in small
cafes with them or in their home
for coffee and talk. . . .
I feel it would be unfortunate
if Mr. Evers' personal opinions
of the operation of the Vienna
campus and the character of the
Austrian people influenced the
decision of very many students
desirous of attending a German
speaking campus. It is apparent
that he did not attempt to in
volve himself enough to come
to enjoy the Austrian way of
life.
ALLISON AMEND
Editor, The Daily:
There are several factual in
accuracies in the unsigned story
entitled SES Report Under Early
Attack? that appeared in this
morning's Daily. The most dis
tressing is one that quotes me
as saying that "Halsey Royden,
acting dean of Hand S, asked
for a copy of the dean of under
graduate studies proposal nearly
two weeks ago. Royden said,
according to Packer, that copies
of the draft recommendation
would be circulated to all H
and S faculty members."
The facts are as follows. A
Daily reporter asked me wheth
er any members of the Hand S
Steering Committee had re
ceived copies of the draft pro
posal. I told him that Dean Roy
den had received a copy last
week in his capacity as a mem
ber of the SES Committee on
Government of the University
(which, incidentally, approved
the recommendation in princi
pal on March 15, 1968).
The further facts, which I
hope will set the record straight
on other inaccuracies in this
story, are these: I telephoned
Professor Langmuir, the Chair

man of the Hand S Steering
Committee on Thursday, Octob
er 3, to invite him and the other
members of his group to meet
with members of the SES Steer
ing Committee for a discussion
Joi the SES recommendations

of .Undergraduate Studies, I
have no reason to suppose that
any member of that Committee
(with the exception noted above)
saw the precise text of the pro
jposal before its general dis
tribution to members of the H
and S Assembly with the agenda
for the meeting.
It does seem regrettable that
the Hand S Steering Commit
tee did not take the initiative in
approaching anyone in SES
about their resolution despite its
obvious impact on SES recom
mendations. If we in SES have
fallen into error on the matter
of communications with our
brethren, it seems clear that we
have company in that error.
All of this, while required to
set the record straight, is some
what beside the point. The point
is that the Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies proposal needs to
be discussed on its merits and
without reference to "politics,"
"tactics," or "failures of com
munication."

Editor, The DAILY:
I feel sorry for Bill Evers. It
is apparent that the cold-heart
edness of the Austrian people
and the strictness of Dr. Straub
and the administration made
such an impression on him that
he was forced to write only on
these points in his Oct. 8 article.
I am an alumna of Austria V
or Wien I as we proudly call
ourselves. Besides heartily en
joying life in der Seilerstatte,
even though we were in the red
light district as Mr. Evers men
tioned, I had both a Viennese
family and a family at Semmer
ing, the former Austrian cam
pus-site, who I'm sure if Mr.
Evers had taken the time to
visit (their names were on the
list left at the campus of Aus
trian contacts) would have de
stroyed his concept of Austrian
cold-heartedness.
As to the administration of the
Austrian campus—the Straubs
are Viennese people. I spent
many an afternoon in small
cafes with them or in their home
for coffee and talk. . . .
I feel it would be unfortunate
if Mr. Evers' personal opinions
of the operation of the Vienna
campus and the character of the
Austrian people influenced the
decision of very many students
desirous of attending a German
speaking campus. It is apparent
that he did not attempt to in
volve himself enough to come
to enjoy the Austrian way of
life.

Editor, The Daily:
There are several factual in
accuracies in the unsigned story
entitled SES Report Under Early
Attack? that appeared in this
morning's Daily. The most dis
tressing is one that quotes me
as saying that "Halsey Royden,
acting dean of Hand S, asked
for a copy of the dean of under
graduate studies proposal nearly
two weeks ago. Royden said,
according to Packer, that copies
of the draft recommendation
would be circulated to all H
and S faculty members."
The facts are as follows. A
Daily reporter asked me wheth
er any members of the Hand S
Steering Committee had re
ceived copies of the draft pro
posal. I told him that Dean Roy
den had received a copy last
week in his capacity as a mem
ber of the SES Committee on
Government of the University
(which, incidentally, approved
the recommendation in princi
pal on March 15, 1968).
The further facts, which I
hope will set the record straight
on other inaccuracies in this
story, are these: I telephoned
Professor Langmuir, the Chair

man of the Hand S Steering
Committee on Thursday, Octob
er 3, to invite him and the other
members of his group to meet
with members of the SES Steer
ing Committee for a discussion
Joi the SES recommendations
on undergraduate education. In
the course of that conversation,
Professor Langmuir mentioned
that a resolution on the subject
of a dean of undergraduate ed
ucation would be introduced at
the Hand S Assembly meeting
on October 14.
I expressed interest because
of the probable effect of such
a resolution on SES recommen
dations. Professor Langmuir
then asked whether I had avail
able a description of the SES
proposal that could be circulated
with the agenda for the Hand S
Assembly.
I readily agreed to provide one,
because it seemed to me most
unwise for the Hand S As
sembly to debate the resolution
being laid before it by its Steer
ing Committee without knowing
the reasons for the SES recom
mendation.
On the next day, my office re
ceived a draft description, adapt-

Ed from an SES working paper,
to the Hand S Dean's Office
for distribution with the agenda.
At the same time, I sent the
draft description to the mem
bers of the SES Committee on
the Government of the Univer
(Sity, including Dean Royden,
with a covering note explaining
why the draft was being made
available to members of the
Hand S Assembly.
While several members of the
Hand S Steering Committee
have been generally aware for
some time that SES is going to
propose a key role for a Dean
of .Undergraduate Studies, I
have no reason to suppose that
any member of that Committee
(with the exception noted above)
saw the precise text of the pro
jposal before its general dis
