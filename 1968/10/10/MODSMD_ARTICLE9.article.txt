We find appalling the trend to
ward muzzling academic inquiry
that seems to be cropping up across
the nation.
Last week The University of Min
nesota Daily printed an obscene
four-letter word as a direct quote
in a story about a demonstration on
campus. It also printed a picture of
the same word written on a poster
at the demonstration.
And now the state legislature
seems to be making noises about
cutting the University's appropria
tions in order to get back at the
institution.
Peter Gruchow, editor of The
Minnesota Daily told the board
governing his paper that his editors
had decided "after long and delib
erate thought" to print the objec
tionable word. The governor of
Minnesota and several state legisla
tors had complained to the Univer
sity president about the decision.
But the paper's publishing board
ruled against punishing Gruchow
because he was "motivated by an
ethical commitment to report the
news completely and accurately."

Several times in the last year The
Stanford Daily has seen fit to report
expletives verbatim, and we take
great pride in the fact that there
has been little reaction to our re
portage of these words.
We do not have any particular af
fection for obscenities, and we very
much wish we lived in a world that
did not so frequently call forth the
obscene. But to ignore such expres
sions would be to ignore a part of
life.
We support the Minnesota paper
in its effort honestly to report what
goes on. And we deplore the puri
tanistic reaction of the legislature
of Minnesota. Though the issue in
this case is more a question of jour
nalistic than academic freedom, we
believe the two freedoms are very
much akin.
And it is clear to a growing num
ber of academics and journalists
that links between universities, uni
versity newspapers, and political
bod:es are not in the best interest
of freedom of thought and expres
sion.
