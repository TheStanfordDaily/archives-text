HOUSE
FRIDAY, OCTOBER 11 Presented by the Faculty of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center in cooperation with the
2:30 TILL 5:30 Program Division of Tresidder Memorial Union
The study of man's natural environment is a 2000-year-old cultural quest.
f7\ Thequestion "What is matter" was first asked by the Greek philosophers. /7j
\ ) Much has been learned since then about matter. This learning has con- 11
Jj currently led to the evergrowing realization of how much more there is \\
// yet to be learned. Just as super-huge telescopes are required to study \\
(/\ the outer reaches of our universe, so are larger and more complex in- [\J
strum ents required to probe the near-infinitesimal constituents of matter.
Â» The two-mile accelerator at SLAC is just such an instrument.
VISIT ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS ....... MEET
WITH SOME OF THE FACULTY AND STUDENTS FROM MANY UNIVERSITIES AND
COUNTRIES WHO ARE AT SLAC PROBING THE UNIVERSE'S TINIEST CONSTITUENTS
. AND FIND OUT "WHY" AND "HOW" THEY DO IT LEARN OF THIS
JOINT VENTURE OF STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
IN PURSUIT OF PURE BASIC SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH.
Shuttle buses will leave from Serra Street (in front ol the quad) as last
as they are loaded starting from 2:15 and continuing until 4:15. Ihe tours
