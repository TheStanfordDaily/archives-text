# Glaser Asks SRI Probe
## 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON 
Acting president Robert Gla
ser last night called for a joint
student-faculty investigation of
Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) and its connection with
the University.
In an unprecedented speech in
front of the student legislature,
Glaser set six months as the
maximum time for the investi
gating committee to make its re
port, so it wouldn't "drag on un
til 1982."
The legislature, in its meeting,
voted to place the proposed ju
dicial system on the ballot in a
somewhat amended form. They
decided to allow only "No" or
"yes" until March 15 votes. This
would make the new judicial
system only temporary at b°st.
Concerning SRI, the medical
school dean said he had dis
cussed the investigation with
President-designate Pitzer and
the latter had agreed to it "100
per cent."
Responding to criticism that
the University had been slow to
examine its connection with SRI,
Glaser said, "You can criticize us
for being too slow," but "we
have been and are studying"
SRI.
He said that the University
has examined the relationship
with SRI in the past, as recently
as three years ago, but that
times change and another study
was warranted.
Indirect Relationship
The study should be directed
not only at the corporate rela
tionship with the University but
also at any indirect relationship
the University has with SRI, the
acting president said.
Glaser admitted that any final
decision concerning the Univer
sity's ties with SRI would be up
to Stanford's Board of Trustees,
but he maintained that his past
dealings with the board have
convinced him that the trustees
realize things have changed in
the last fifty years.
He cited the Board of Trus
tees interest in low-cost housing
as evidence of this change (see
related story on this page).
Glaser called for students to
"participate with us as equal
partners" in making this year
one of "constructive change." He
emphasized, however, that such
change must be "amid order."
Pitzer To Cooperate
He said his conversations with
President-designate Pitzer had
convinced him that Pitzer would
back his moves. "I hope you'll at
least give him the chance to do
it,"the acting president said.
Tracing the history of SRI,
Glaser said the Institute had ori
ginally been setup for "problems
important to society in general,
but not to the University in par
ticular." He said this approach
at least needed to be re-exam
ined.
He noted the tacking of the
Students for a Democratic So
ciety's demands to the Board of
Trustees' door Tuesday was "a
la Martin Luther."

Responding to a question, Gla
ser said the recent recommenda
tions of the Stanford AAUP
chapter on University govern
ance were "extremely good."
'The great majority of the rec
ommendations should be imple
mented soon and some immedi
ately," the acting president said.
SDS Ultimatum
Asked about the University's
response to the SDS demands
and deadHne, he said, "There is
no way we can respond by the
given date," but he added that
the administration would have
some statement by Monday.
In an interview with The Daily
Monday of this week, Glaser
said the issue of SRI "is a legit
imate issue to examine—not one
to sweep under the rug and say
it doesn't exist." The SDS de
mands were made two days af4
ter the interview with Glaser. 1
His talk to the legislature last
night was very well received and
students present were heard call
ing it "a damned good speech"
and "very impressive."
In other developments at the
LASSU meeting, a referendum
on the grape boycott was placed
on Monday's ballot and a change
in the composition of the Com
mittee of Fifteen was approved.

CONFRONTATION? — Acting president Glaser last night broke precedent and addressed the student
legislature. Well-received by the legislators, Glaser spoke and answered questions on Stanford's
connection with the Stanford Research Institute. University ties with the research corporation have
been attacked by the local Students for a Democratic Society chapter.
Acting president Robert Gla
ser last night called for a joint
student-faculty investigation of
Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) and its connection with
the University.
In an unprecedented speech in
front of the student legislature,
Glaser set six months as the
maximum time for the investi
gating committee to make its re
port, so it wouldn't "drag on un
til 1982."
The legislature, in its meeting,
voted to place the proposed ju
dicial system on the ballot in a
somewhat amended form. They
decided to allow only "No" or
"yes" until March 15 votes. This
would make the new judicial
system only temporary at b°st.
Concerning SRI, the medical
school dean said he had dis
cussed the investigation with
President-designate Pitzer and
the latter had agreed to it "100
per cent."
Responding to criticism that
the University had been slow to
examine its connection with SRI,
Glaser said, "You can criticize us
for being too slow," but "we
have been and are studying"
SRI.
He said that the University
has examined the relationship
with SRI in the past, as recently
as three years ago, but that
times change and another study
was warranted.
Indirect Relationship
The study should be directed
not only at the corporate rela
tionship with the University but
also at any indirect relationship
the University has with SRI, the
acting president said.
Glaser admitted that any final
decision concerning the Univer
sity's ties with SRI would be up
to Stanford's Board of Trustees,
but he maintained that his past
dealings with the board have
convinced him that the trustees
realize things have changed in
the last fifty years.
He cited the Board of Trus
tees interest in low-cost housing
as evidence of this change (see
related story on this page).
Glaser called for students to
"participate with us as equal
partners" in making this year
one of "constructive change." He
emphasized, however, that such
change must be "amid order."
Pitzer To Cooperate
He said his conversations with
President-designate Pitzer had
convinced him that Pitzer would
back his moves. "I hope you'll at
least give him the chance to do
it,"the acting president said.
Tracing the history of SRI,
Glaser said the Institute had ori
ginally been setup for "problems
important to society in general,
but not to the University in par
ticular." He said this approach
at least needed to be re-exam
ined.
He noted the tacking of the
Students for a Democratic So
ciety's demands to the Board of
Trustees' door Tuesday was "a
