# DAILY POLL
## 
### 
If you get an unusual phone call today, with a strange person
asking you peculiar questionsâ€”don't hang up. It's just us.
We're reinstituting the long-defunct Stanford Daily Poll. The
first question will deal with the SDS demands about the Stanford
Research Institute.
A random sample of students has been selected, and we'll be
calling late this afternoon (and later, if necessary.) So make us
happy and answer.
