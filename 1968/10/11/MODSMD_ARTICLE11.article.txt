# The 						Speaker
## Constitution Lacking 
### YALE BRAUNSTEIN 
Next week the student body
will vote on a new constitution
and a new judicial system. Each
of these documents has several
shortcomings. I shall deal with
each separately.
Under the new ASSU constitu
tion, a senate of twenty elected
members and the student body
president will represent the stu
dent body. This is approximately
one representative for every 500
students, as opposed to the cur
rent ratio of one legislator for
every 75 students. (The academ
ic senate has 64 members that
represent approximately 982 fac
ulty members.)
Assuring that the 20 student
senators are truly representative
may be impossible.
This is not the only feature of
the new constitution —if a more
"workable" legislature is all that
is desired, this could be accom
plished simply by reducing the
size of the legislature (amend
the current constitution) or en

larging and giving more power
to the rules committee (chang
ing the by-laws).
Other deficiencies in the new
constitution are the lack of pro
visions for coordinating of the
activities and, especially, the ex
penditures of the various grad
uate and undergraduate associa
tions. It is easy to envisage a
group desiring funds applying
simultaneously to the senate and
six subordinate associations.
The lack of separation be
tween the executive and legisla
ture upsets me. And the section
on the judiciary omits any pro
hibition of double jeopardy with
in the university. This is a par
ticularly serious problem be
cause the form of the judicial
system is still unsettled.
Objections to the proposed ju
dicial system are numerous.
Even the student members of
the Committee of Fifteen were
not unanimous in approval—the
blank space on the top oi Tues
day's copy of the Cl 5 statement

formerly contained a statement
to this effect.
Among the shortcomings:
—students are out-numbered
on both the rule-making and the
adjudicating councils.
tin 4 amendment provisions
are unduly complicated and un
workable.
—it is inconsistent with the
proposed new constittuion.
—the Dean of Students has a
say in the formation of rules
and is the only alternative to the
Judicial Council.
It is difficult to decide whether
the proposed judicial reform is
better than nothing. Currently
we have an unknown evil, the
Temporary Judicial Council. Ap
proval of the reform proposal
may replace it with a greater
evil.
I recommend that all students
vote either for temporary ap
proval (Proposition 2) or rejec
tion (Proposition 3) of the CIS
judicial system.
