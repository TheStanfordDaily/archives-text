# Letters To The Editor
## SRI's Pacific Plan 
### 
Editor, The DAILY:
In reading "The Sun Never
Sets on SRI" in The Stanford
Daily of October 4, I am greatly
disappointed to see so many dis
tortions of information readily
available from the Institute and
other sources.
One example will illustrate the
point. The article states that the
Institute's "directors and admin
istrators conceive of a 'Pacific
Basin strategy' involving a sep
aration of Japan from Mainland
China markets and creation of
a U.S. version of the pre-war
Greater East Asian Co-Prosperi
ty Sphere."
The article goes on to link
this so-called "strategy" with the
1965 massacre of 300,000 to 500,-
000 communists in Indonesia and
calls this situation a "coup for
SRI."
No statement of SRl's objec
tives could be further from the
truth. We have no Pacific Basin
strategy other than a program
of research and public service
aimed at accelerating economic
and industrial development in all
the Pacific nations.

Editor, The DAILY:
Recent articles in the Daily
concerning the grapeworkers'
strike in Delano and the associ
ated boycott of grapes in urban
areas have applied simple ideo
logical tei*ms, such as oppression
and racism, to an extremely com
plex problem, a problem deserv
ing much less impassioned and
more penetrating analysis for
adequate understanding.
In 1965 when the grape pick
ers' strike began, working condi
tions in the Delano vineyards

were very poor. Since that time,
however, both wages and work
ing conditions have improved
substantially.
Recent surveys, one conducted
by the California Farmer in the
Coachella Valley and another
conducted by the mayor of Van
couver, B.C. in the Central Val
ley, found wages of grape pick
ers averaging around $2.25 per
hour.
Working conditions, such as
sanitary facilities, conformed to
state regulations. . . .
The current issue in the Dela
no strike is not one of wages;
it concerns, rather, the organiza
tional rights of the workers.
Surveys taken in 1966 by a
Democratic congressman and in
1967 by his Republican successor,
found that only about twenty
five percent of the grape work
ers in the Delano area wanted
union representation. Recently
an organization of grape work
ers opposed to unionization has
been formed.
These facts do not change the
principle involved, the right of
workers to be represented by a
bargaining organization if they o
choose. Nevertheless, those sup
porting the boycott as a means
of gaining these rights should
realize that their efforts are
hurting most the large majority
of grape workers, who do not
want union representation, and
who need the money they earn
in the vineyards very badly.

Editor: The DAILY:
Predictions of monstrous dis
orders on the Stanford campus
this fall have been made by sev
eral persons whose relationship
to the left remain ambiguous at
best. Despite Dennis Hayes'
semi-retraction of his own state
ment, the impact — possibly the
intent — of his original words
are strongly felt in the student
community.
Although those of us, who
would prefer that the University
were run by the academic com
munity rather than by large
corporations, are finding more
and more people with us each
day, it is probably true that we
are something short of the nec
essary student and faculty sup
port to seize the University and
hold it from the U.S. Army.

It is therefore a strong possi
bility that massive action of the
kind predicted will not occur
until the aggressive nature of
our off campus corporate rulers
and their on campus liberal ad
ministrators is again manifest.
As the community may recall,
it was an attempt last year to
single out and prosecute a few
activists among a crowd of anti-
CIA demonstrators which even
tually brought forth retributive
forces (from both the student
and faculty communities)
against the Administration.
As one of several hundred rad
icals who vulturously roam the
campus by night in search of
the innocent and defenseless, I
am willing to predict only that in
the end the people will triumph
over bureaucrats, technocrats,
and tyrants. And I would sug
gest that the selection of Ken
Pitzer, whose credentials even
as a liberal are poor, may signal
a new era of corporate disregard
for the public interest and wel
fare.
It would not be surprising to
find Dr. Pitzer — known best for
his willingness to testify before
the "investigating" committee of
Sen. Joseph McCarthy — trying
desperately, a la Hubert Humph
rey, to single out a special elite
group of troublemakers without
which all troubles on the campus
would cease. Pitzer has already
made public statements suggest
ing that he believes in this sim
plistic analysis of the problems
of our society.
All we can do, I believe, is
wait and see how the new Ad
man responds to grievances
which question the basic organi
zation and function of this not
so private institution in this not
so free society.
In this same context, it should
be known by the student com
munity that a group of 10 or so
professors are putting out a reg
ular memo on "student unrest"
with articles from the "objec
tive" media (eg: Fortune, Satur
day Review, the Dean of Co
lumbia College). This is being
sent to all faculty members.
But how many will ever see
the 75 page book on the internal
working and machinations of Co
lumbia University Corporation
put out by Columbia SDS or The
Radical Guide to Stanford pub
lished by Stanford SDS?

Predictions of monstrous dis
orders on the Stanford campus
this fall have been made by sev
eral persons whose relationship
to the left remain ambiguous at
best. Despite Dennis Hayes'
semi-retraction of his own state
ment, the impact — possibly the
intent — of his original words
are strongly felt in the student
community.
Although those of us, who
would prefer that the University
were run by the academic com
munity rather than by large
corporations, are finding more
and more people with us each
day, it is probably true that we
are something short of the nec
essary student and faculty sup
port to seize the University and
hold it from the U.S. Army.

It is therefore a strong possi
bility that massive action of the
kind predicted will not occur
until the aggressive nature of
our off campus corporate rulers
and their on campus liberal ad
ministrators is again manifest.
As the community may recall,
it was an attempt last year to
single out and prosecute a few
activists among a crowd of anti-
CIA demonstrators which even
tually brought forth retributive
forces (from both the student
and faculty communities)
against the Administration.
As one of several hundred rad
icals who vulturously roam the
campus by night in search of
the innocent and defenseless, I
am willing to predict only that in
the end the people will triumph
over bureaucrats, technocrats,
and tyrants. And I would sug
gest that the selection of Ken
Pitzer, whose credentials even
as a liberal are poor, may signal
a new era of corporate disregard
for the public interest and wel
fare.
It would not be surprising to
find Dr. Pitzer — known best for
his willingness to testify before
the "investigating" committee of
Sen. Joseph McCarthy — trying
desperately, a la Hubert Humph
rey, to single out a special elite
group of troublemakers without
which all troubles on the campus
would cease. Pitzer has already
made public statements suggest
ing that he believes in this sim
plistic analysis of the problems
of our society.
All we can do, I believe, is
wait and see how the new Ad
man responds to grievances
which question the basic organi
zation and function of this not
so private institution in this not
so free society.
In this same context, it should
be known by the student com
munity that a group of 10 or so
professors are putting out a reg
ular memo on "student unrest"
with articles from the "objec
tive" media (eg: Fortune, Satur
day Review, the Dean of Co
lumbia College). This is being
sent to all faculty members.
But how many will ever see
the 75 page book on the internal
working and machinations of Co
lumbia University Corporation
put out by Columbia SDS or The
Radical Guide to Stanford pub
lished by Stanford SDS?

In reading "The Sun Never

disappointed to see so many dis
tortions of information readily
available from the Institute and
other sources.
One example will illustrate the
point. The article states that the
Institute's "directors and admin
istrators conceive of a 'Pacific
Basin strategy' involving a sep
aration of Japan from Mainland
China markets and creation of
a U.S. version of the pre-war
Greater East Asian Co-Prosperi
ty Sphere."
The article goes on to link
this so-called "strategy" with the
1965 massacre of 300,000 to 500,-
000 communists in Indonesia and
calls this situation a "coup for
SRI."
No statement of SRl's objec

Recent articles in the Daily
concerning the grapeworkers'
strike in Delano and the associ
ated boycott of grapes in urban
areas have applied simple ideo
logical tei*ms, such as oppression
and racism, to an extremely com
plex problem, a problem deserv
ing much less impassioned and
more penetrating analysis for
adequate understanding.
In 1965 when the grape pick
ers' strike began, working condi
tions in the Delano vineyards

were very poor. Since that time,
however, both wages and work
ing conditions have improved
substantially.
Recent surveys, one conducted
by the California Farmer in the
Coachella Valley and another
conducted by the mayor of Van
couver, B.C. in the Central Val
ley, found wages of grape pick
ers averaging around $2.25 per
hour.
Working conditions, such as
sanitary facilities, conformed to
state regulations. . . .
The current issue in the Dela
no strike is not one of wages;
it concerns, rather, the organiza
tional rights of the workers.
Surveys taken in 1966 by a
Democratic congressman and in
1967 by his Republican successor,
found that only about twenty
five percent of the grape work
ers in the Delano area wanted
union representation. Recently
an organization of grape work
ers opposed to unionization has
been formed.
These facts do not change the
principle involved, the right of
workers to be represented by a
bargaining organization if they o
choose. Nevertheless, those sup
porting the boycott as a means
of gaining these rights should

In reading "The Sun Never
Sets on SRI" in The Stanford
Daily of October 4, I am greatly
disappointed to see so many dis
tortions of information readily
available from the Institute and
other sources.
One example will illustrate the
point. The article states that the
Institute's "directors and admin
istrators conceive of a 'Pacific
Basin strategy' involving a sep
aration of Japan from Mainland
China markets and creation of
a U.S. version of the pre-war
Greater East Asian Co-Prosperi
ty Sphere."
The article goes on to link
this so-called "strategy" with the
1965 massacre of 300,000 to 500,-
000 communists in Indonesia and
calls this situation a "coup for
SRI."
No statement of SRl's objec
tives could be further from the
truth. We have no Pacific Basin
strategy other than a program
of research and public service
aimed at accelerating economic
and industrial development in all
the Pacific nations.

Recent articles in the Daily
concerning the grapeworkers'
strike in Delano and the associ
ated boycott of grapes in urban
areas have applied simple ideo
logical tei*ms, such as oppression
and racism, to an extremely com
plex problem, a problem deserv
ing much less impassioned and
more penetrating analysis for
adequate understanding.
In 1965 when the grape pick
ers' strike began, working condi
tions in the Delano vineyards

were very poor. Since that time,
however, both wages and work
ing conditions have improved
substantially.
Recent surveys, one conducted
by the California Farmer in the
Coachella Valley and another
conducted by the mayor of Van
couver, B.C. in the Central Val
ley, found wages of grape pick
ers averaging around $2.25 per
hour.
Working conditions, such as
sanitary facilities, conformed to
state regulations. . . .
The current issue in the Dela
no strike is not one of wages;
it concerns, rather, the organiza
tional rights of the workers.
Surveys taken in 1966 by a
Democratic congressman and in
1967 by his Republican successor,
found that only about twenty
five percent of the grape work
ers in the Delano area wanted
union representation. Recently
an organization of grape work
ers opposed to unionization has
been formed.
These facts do not change the
principle involved, the right of
workers to be represented by a
bargaining organization if they o
choose. Nevertheless, those sup
porting the boycott as a means
of gaining these rights should
realize that their efforts are
hurting most the large majority
of grape workers, who do not
want union representation, and
who need the money they earn
in the vineyards very badly.

Editor: The DAILY:
Predictions of monstrous dis
orders on the Stanford campus
this fall have been made by sev
eral persons whose relationship
to the left remain ambiguous at
best. Despite Dennis Hayes'
semi-retraction of his own state
ment, the impact — possibly the
intent — of his original words
are strongly felt in the student
community.
Although those of us, who
would prefer that the University
were run by the academic com
munity rather than by large
corporations, are finding more
and more people with us each
day, it is probably true that we
are something short of the nec
essary student and faculty sup
port to seize the University and
hold it from the U.S. Army.

It is therefore a strong possi
bility that massive action of the
kind predicted will not occur
until the aggressive nature of
our off campus corporate rulers
and their on campus liberal ad
ministrators is again manifest.
As the community may recall,
it was an attempt last year to
single out and prosecute a few
activists among a crowd of anti-
CIA demonstrators which even
tually brought forth retributive
forces (from both the student
and faculty communities)
against the Administration.
As one of several hundred rad
icals who vulturously roam the
campus by night in search of
the innocent and defenseless, I
am willing to predict only that in
the end the people will triumph
over bureaucrats, technocrats,
and tyrants. And I would sug
gest that the selection of Ken
Pitzer, whose credentials even
as a liberal are poor, may signal
a new era of corporate disregard
for the public interest and wel
fare.
It would not be surprising to
find Dr. Pitzer — known best for
his willingness to testify before
the "investigating" committee of
Sen. Joseph McCarthy — trying
desperately, a la Hubert Humph
rey, to single out a special elite
group of troublemakers without
which all troubles on the campus
would cease. Pitzer has already
made public statements suggest
ing that he believes in this sim
plistic analysis of the problems
of our society.
All we can do, I believe, is
wait and see how the new Ad
man responds to grievances
which question the basic organi
zation and function of this not
so private institution in this not
so free society.
