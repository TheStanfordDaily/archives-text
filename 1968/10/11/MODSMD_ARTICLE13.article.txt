### TIM HAIGHT 
Today, all those millions of "forgotten
who will vote for George Wallace, are having their turn
in the limelight.
If the universitty can again overcome its inherent
class snobbishness and revulsion at populist risings
on the right, scholars could learn a thing or two from
the Southern Spoiler.
The first lesson might be called, "Integration como
home." Many of Wallace's followers are racist. Most
of them are in jobs that will be filled by black people
long before the groves of academe refllect equality
They see a real threat to their economic existence.
They're perfectly right. If we have as many blacks
as whites employed, with equal chances for advance
ment and unemployment stays the same, we shall
have as many whites as blacks unemployed or under
employed. That's plain common sense.
Of course, the way the Wallace people react is
bigoted and shortsighted. They are trying to hold up
the status quo by fighting the blacks. They should be
challenging the notion that anybody has to unemployed.
Of course, if they did that, George Wallace might
not get much money for his campaign. Right now, his
rightist populism has its limits.
While he advocates taking away the tax-exempt sta
tus of the foundations, he does not support abolishing
the oil-depletion allowance. While he resents the steel
worker's taxes going to pay the maintenance of the
poor, he does not resent the tax structure that puts
that burden on the middle class and not the rich.

What else bugs the Wallaceites? They see leftist
students, black people, and Washington bureaucrats
getting all the attention, especially on television.
They're right. Not having the money to buy time
on the media, students and poor people have been
forced to make news to publicize their point. Since
what the news media really like are personalities, con
flict, and violence, protest movements have catered
to that style.
Why does this bug the Wallace man? First of all,
he is caught in a major contradiction of American so
ciety. He is leading an alienated, fragmented life and
is supposed to like it.
He can like it, if he is given a minimum of comforts
and, more importantly, myths that dignify and legiti
mize his living that way. If he can be convinced that
he follows the piper bccause he likes the music, every
thing's fine.
But where are the myths being maintained? One
of the functions of a communication system is to so
cialize new members. To this might be added keeping
them socalized in times of stress.
In our society this would mean telling the worker
that he leads a full life, has dignity, and that evory
thing's basically O.K. In our free country things have
not been working out this way, and the discontent
that the Wallace people show may very well come
from that.
Not that some people aren't trying. Wallace is glor
ifying his people by the standard racist technique of
putting them up by putting others down. Nixon, on
the other hand has expensive TV commercials about

how most things are good and about the virtues of
the forgotten American. Humphrey tried with "the
politics of joy," but that was too far out.
Now, whether they realize it or not, the Wallace
people are using the same techniques to make up for
their lack of supporting myths that the blacks and stu
dents used. They are getting on TV. When they fail
to get elected, to keep that heady wine of publicity
flowing, you can expect violence.
But what does this mean on a deeper level? Prob
ably that some forces such as alienation and lack of
purpose are bugging the factory worker and the South
ern farmer in ways very similar to those felt by the
hippie and radical.
But because they have been socalized differently by
different dissident traditions, the outcome will be
different. It could mean American Nazism.
America is a paradox. While our myths said every
one could succeed, our economic realities have made
that impossible. Our society is becoming more and
more hierarchical. Racism has been a convenient way
to keep some people at the bottom and also provide a
myth to please others lower in the heap. But now that
blacks are demanding a decent life, racism is not
enough.
Pretty soon, the class lines that racism and the Amer
ican dream iced over are going to show. But as long
as the rich and powerful in our countrv can keep the
workers, the minorities, the poor, and tne intellectuals
hating and fearing each other, they will be able to
ride out the storm.
All the way to Armageddon.
