## Jobs For Black Youth 
### ART WILSON 
Some people prefer to talk
about welfare roll call and gov
ernment aid to minorities and
poor people, to say that black
people are lazy, shiftless, and
ignorant. Well, the time has
come for some of the worldly
philosophers and authorities to
deal with the real world.
Black people are a starving
minority that needs desperately
jobs and employment. The fig
ures always say that more and
more blacks are being hired, but
what they forget is that more
and more black people compete
in the job market everyday.
You cannot compute employ
ment status on the basis of last
year's statistics. The ghetto
needs, food, clothes, shelter; the
ghetto needs education, book
learning, and professional peo
ple; but the ghetto also needs
jobs.
It needs jobs for its young
people, who will be the black
leaders of tomorrow. It needs
jobs for its young people, who
refuse to stand for the same
type of activity that kept their
fathers, and their fathers' fa
thers homeless, jobless, and
starving.
If America is, in fact, a society
that wants to be pulled from the
throes of racism, then the peo
ple of America must respond.
The people of America must aid
the black people. The people of

America, in white suburbia, in
the White House, in Stanford
University must aid black peo
ple.
And this, believe it or not, is
not a difficult thing to do. All
that need be done is to give a
black youngster in Nairobi an
after-school job. This is what
will change the system.
Give a black youth in East
Palo Alto or East Menlo Park
a job. A chance to earn money
for perhaps the first time and
put it to good use. This is the
thing that save America, this is
the action that will aid black
people.
All we are asking is that you

walk in the shoes of the black
young adult for one day, one
hour, or even one second. Then
you, too, will b? aware of the
problem, and you will make your
contribution toward the rescue
of America.
No electoral ballot is required
here, all that need be done is to
give a damn and give a job.

that need be done is to give a
black youngster in Nairobi an
after-school job. This is what
will change the system.
Give a black youth in East
Palo Alto or East Menlo Park
a job. A chance to earn money
for perhaps the first time and
put it to good use. This is the
thing that save America, this is
the action that will aid black
people.
All we are asking is that you

walk in the shoes of the black
young adult for one day, one
hour, or even one second. Then
you, too, will b? aware of the
problem, and you will make your
contribution toward the rescue
of America.
No electoral ballot is required
here, all that need be done is to
give a damn and give a job.

Some people prefer to talk
about welfare roll call and gov
ernment aid to minorities and
poor people, to say that black
people are lazy, shiftless, and
ignorant. Well, the time has
come for some of the worldly
philosophers and authorities to
deal with the real world.
Black people are a starving
minority that needs desperately
jobs and employment. The fig
ures always say that more and
more blacks are being hired, but
what they forget is that more
and more black people compete
in the job market everyday.
You cannot compute employ
ment status on the basis of last
year's statistics. The ghetto
needs, food, clothes, shelter; the
ghetto needs education, book
learning, and professional peo
ple; but the ghetto also needs
jobs.
It needs jobs for its young
people, who will be the black
leaders of tomorrow. It needs
jobs for its young people, who
refuse to stand for the same
type of activity that kept their
fathers, and their fathers' fa
thers homeless, jobless, and
starving.
If America is, in fact, a society
that wants to be pulled from the
throes of racism, then the peo
ple of America must respond.
The people of America must aid
the black people. The people of

America, in white suburbia, in
the White House, in Stanford
University must aid black peo
ple.
And this, believe it or not, is
not a difficult thing to do. All
that need be done is to give a

after-school job. This is what
will change the system.
