# Can Indians Bottle Up O.J.?
## 
### GARY CAVALLI 
"The coaches who've played
USC tell me about the humans
on the USC team, and then they
tell me about O. J. Simpson."
That is how Stanford coach
John Ralston sums up his feel
ings about the Trojans' great
running back, who the Indians
will have to contain to pull off an
upset tomorrow afternoon at
Stanford Stadium.

Kickoff time is 1:30 p.m. for
what promises to be the Tribe's
most important game of the '68
season. Over 80,000 fans are ex
pected to jam their way into the
Indian wigwam, so spectators
are urged to head for the sta
dium a half-hour earlier than
they normally would.
"Simpson may be the greatest
player ever to put on the equip
ment," Ralston commented after
Stanford's 24-13 win over Air
Force last Saturday. "He'll get
his 150-200 yards. You just can't
hope to shut him off. He'll get
them whether you like it or
not."
With this in mind, Stanford
will be playing a "containment"
type of defense Saturday. The
Indian defenders will concen
trate on holding Simpson to
short gains, without letting him
bust loose for the game-breaker,
the long touchdown run which
can both devastate and de
moralize an opponent.

Both teams go into the con
test with unblemished 3-0 rec
ords. This is not an unusual sit
uation for the Trojans, who have
compiled an amazing 49-13-1
record over the past six years.
But the last time Stanford start
ede a season with three straight
wins was back in 1954, when
John Brodie was at the helm.
The man who'll be holding
Stanford's hopes in the palm of
his hand tomorrow, quarterback
Jim Plunkett, was only six years
old when Brodie led the '54 In
dians to their three-game har
vest. Back then Plunkett was
doing the same thing he'll be
doing tomorrow, throwing a
football.
Answer to O. J.
An aspiring quarterback since
his early youth, Plunkett has
blossomed into an excellent sig
nal-caller in this his sophomore
year of football competition. In
three games he has connected on

36 of 67 passes for 696 yards
and nine touchdowns.
The Trojan coaching staff is
well aware of Plunkett's abili
ties.
"That kid (Plunkett) is doing
a tremendous job for them,"
noted USC mentor John McKay
after Plunkett directed the In
dians to their triumph over Air
Force.
Trojan assistant coach and
scout Joe Margucci, who saw
Stanford down the Falcons, re
ported to McKay that "this is
the best Stanford team I've seen
in 10 years."
Keying on Plunkett's aerial at
tack, the Trojans figure to em
ploy a fierce pass rush in to
morrow's encounter. To counter
this, not only will the Tribe of
fensive line have to provide pro
tection for Plunkett, but the run
ning backs must take some of
the pressure off by making the
Indian ground game a factor for
USC to contend with.

Ralston, who feels that both
his line and his running backs
have not yet played up to their
potential, knows their perform
ance will be a pivotal factor in
tomorrow's game.
"We need more consistency in
our blocking up front," Ralston
said after the Air Force game,
"and our running game has to
improve to take some of the
pressure off the passer."
The Trojans, second-ranked
team in the country, are nine
point favorites to dump 18th
ranked Stanford tomorrow. But
the odds don't bother Ralston
or any of the Indian players.
"With each opponent we've
been climbing up the ladder in
competition," Ralston reflected
early this week. "Saturday we
reach the top." The coach paused
for a moment and then said "I
feel very strongly that we can
win the ballgame."


MARKED MAN —This Is the man Stanford must put the elamps on
tomorrow, O. J. Simpson. Generally considered one of the two top
collegiate football players in the country, Simpson has gained 588
yards in three games. The entire Stanford team has 578 yards rush
ing.
"The coaches who've played
USC tell me about the humans
on the USC team, and then they
tell me about O. J. Simpson."

"Simpson may be the greatest
player ever to put on the equip
ment," Ralston commented after
Stanford's 24-13 win over Air
Force last Saturday. "He'll get
his 150-200 yards. You just can't
hope to shut him off. He'll get
them whether you like it or
not."
With this in mind, Stanford
will be playing a "containment"
type of defense Saturday. The
Indian defenders will concen
trate on holding Simpson to
short gains, without letting him
bust loose for the game-breaker,
the long touchdown run which
can both devastate and de
moralize an opponent.

Both teams go into the con
test with unblemished 3-0 rec
ords. This is not an unusual sit
uation for the Trojans, who have
compiled an amazing 49-13-1
record over the past six years.
But the last time Stanford start
ede a season with three straight
wins was back in 1954, when
John Brodie was at the helm.
The man who'll be holding
Stanford's hopes in the palm of
his hand tomorrow, quarterback
Jim Plunkett, was only six years
old when Brodie led the '54 In
dians to their three-game har
vest. Back then Plunkett was
doing the same thing he'll be
doing tomorrow, throwing a
football.
Answer to O. J.
An aspiring quarterback since
his early youth, Plunkett has
blossomed into an excellent sig
nal-caller in this his sophomore
year of football competition. In
three games he has connected on

36 of 67 passes for 696 yards
and nine touchdowns.
The Trojan coaching staff is
well aware of Plunkett's abili
ties.
"That kid (Plunkett) is doing
a tremendous job for them,"
noted USC mentor John McKay
after Plunkett directed the In
dians to their triumph over Air
Force.
Trojan assistant coach and
scout Joe Margucci, who saw
Stanford down the Falcons, re
ported to McKay that "this is
the best Stanford team I've seen
in 10 years."
Keying on Plunkett's aerial at
tack, the Trojans figure to em
ploy a fierce pass rush in to
morrow's encounter. To counter
this, not only will the Tribe of
fensive line have to provide pro
tection for Plunkett, but the run
ning backs must take some of
the pressure off by making the
Indian ground game a factor for
USC to contend with.

Ralston, who feels that both
his line and his running backs
have not yet played up to their
potential, knows their perform
ance will be a pivotal factor in
tomorrow's game.
"We need more consistency in
our blocking up front," Ralston
said after the Air Force game,
"and our running game has to
improve to take some of the
pressure off the passer."
The Trojans, second-ranked
team in the country, are nine
point favorites to dump 18th
ranked Stanford tomorrow. But
the odds don't bother Ralston
or any of the Indian players.
"With each opponent we've
been climbing up the ladder in
competition," Ralston reflected
early this week. "Saturday we
reach the top." The coach paused
for a moment and then said "I
feel very strongly that we can
win the ballgame."


MARKED MAN —This Is the man Stanford must put the elamps on
tomorrow, O. J. Simpson. Generally considered one of the two top
collegiate football players in the country, Simpson has gained 588
yards in three games. The entire Stanford team has 578 yards rush
ing.
"The coaches who've played
USC tell me about the humans
on the USC team, and then they
tell me about O. J. Simpson."
That is how Stanford coach
John Ralston sums up his feel
ings about the Trojans' great
running back, who the Indians
will have to contain to pull off an
upset tomorrow afternoon at
Stanford Stadium.

Kickoff time is 1:30 p.m. for
what promises to be the Tribe's
most important game of the '68
season. Over 80,000 fans are ex
pected to jam their way into the
Indian wigwam, so spectators
are urged to head for the sta
dium a half-hour earlier than
they normally would.

ords. This is not an unusual sit
uation for the Trojans, who have
compiled an amazing 49-13-1
record over the past six years.
But the last time Stanford start
ede a season with three straight
wins was back in 1954, when
John Brodie was at the helm.
The man who'll be holding
Stanford's hopes in the palm of
his hand tomorrow, quarterback
Jim Plunkett, was only six years
old when Brodie led the '54 In
dians to their three-game har
vest. Back then Plunkett was
doing the same thing he'll be
doing tomorrow, throwing a
football.
Answer to O. J.
An aspiring quarterback since
his early youth, Plunkett has
blossomed into an excellent sig
nal-caller in this his sophomore
year of football competition. In
three games he has connected on

36 of 67 passes for 696 yards
and nine touchdowns.
The Trojan coaching staff is
well aware of Plunkett's abili
ties.
"That kid (Plunkett) is doing
a tremendous job for them,"
noted USC mentor John McKay
after Plunkett directed the In
dians to their triumph over Air
Force.
Trojan assistant coach and
scout Joe Margucci, who saw
Stanford down the Falcons, re
ported to McKay that "this is
the best Stanford team I've seen
in 10 years."
Keying on Plunkett's aerial at
tack, the Trojans figure to em
ploy a fierce pass rush in to
morrow's encounter. To counter
this, not only will the Tribe of
fensive line have to provide pro
tection for Plunkett, but the run
ning backs must take some of
the pressure off by making the
Indian ground game a factor for
USC to contend with.

Ralston, who feels that both
his line and his running backs
have not yet played up to their
potential, knows their perform
ance will be a pivotal factor in
tomorrow's game.
"We need more consistency in
our blocking up front," Ralston
said after the Air Force game,
"and our running game has to
improve to take some of the
pressure off the passer."
The Trojans, second-ranked
team in the country, are nine
point favorites to dump 18th
ranked Stanford tomorrow. But
the odds don't bother Ralston
or any of the Indian players.
"With each opponent we've
been climbing up the ladder in
competition," Ralston reflected
early this week. "Saturday we
reach the top." The coach paused
for a moment and then said "I
feel very strongly that we can
win the ballgame."


MARKED MAN —This Is the man Stanford must put the elamps on
tomorrow, O. J. Simpson. Generally considered one of the two top
collegiate football players in the country, Simpson has gained 588
yards in three games. The entire Stanford team has 578 yards rush
ing.
