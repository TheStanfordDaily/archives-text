# Clark: Pace Not Waste
## Sacto Invite Lures Harriers 
### ALLEN MEREDITH 
Varsity coach Marshall Clark,
with a glitter in his eye that
would inspire any athletic team
on to victory, stands firm in his
belief that Stanford's cross-coun
try team will be the strongest
in the school's history.
Tomorrow the team will have
a chance to confirm the coach's
optimism when they journey

north to compete in the Sacra
mento Invitational.
Last weekend's intra-squad
meet opened the 1968 season
with a fast but steady pace
which carried four Indians and
one stubborn Papoose to a fine
beginning at the Stanford
course.
Senior Brook Thomas, junior
Chuck Menz, sophomores Don
Karding and Duncan Mac Donald,
and freshman Jack Lawson all
entered the finish chute together
with a very strong 20:40.1 clock
ing.
Brock Cools It
Junior Greg Brock, who has
been plagued with a chest cold,
slacked off the main pack to pre
serve his strength and finished
sixth.
Three freshmen—Bernie Lah
de, Robert Coe, George Watson
—followed the veteran Brock
with impressive times. All three
placed their names on the AU-

Time freshman list, Bernie plac
ing seventh, Bob ninth, and
George eleventh.
The fast course at Sacramento
will have an effect on Coach
Clark's strategy.
"The team will try to hang to
gether as a single unit as they
did this past weekend. The
course, conducive to speed and
controlleed running, will keep
them near the front until the
climax, which is important In;a
distance race."
The nationally reknowned
cross-country teams from USC
and San Diego will be present
to hinder Stanford's efforts for
a good showing and the all-im
portant strong finish. At the Cal
State-Long Beach Invitational
earlier this month, USC and San
Diego placed in the first ten po
sitions which is as strong an in
dication as can be found that
both teams will be strong, to say
the least.
