# University Urges Low-Cost Housing
## 
### 
Acting President Robert J.
Glaser yesterday urged the Palo
Alto Planning Commission to
"carefully consider" designating
the City's Corporation Yard site
for low and moderate income
housing.
The site is located on land
leased by the city from Stanford,
across El Camino Real from the
main entrance to the University.
In a letter to Planning Com
mission Chairman Stanley N.
Nortton, Glaser said that the
present shortage of low and
moderate income housing in Palo
Alto "constitutes a particular
hardship on members of minor
ity groups who are interested in
obtaining good jobs and whom
a number of employers, includ
ing Stanford, are making special
efforts to hire."
In action yesterday, the city
planning commission approved
three plans in addition to Gla
ser's as being "appropriate" uses
of the site. They include a Holi
day Inn, an office building and a
retired persons' home.
The Corporation Yard site
alone "would by no means be a
solution to the overall problem,
either for the city or for Stan
ford," Glaser added. "In the
last analysis it is likely that mul
tiple programs will be needed to
meet the existing shortage effec
tively," he said.
While the limited area avail
able at the Corporation Yard

site may pose problems on ade
quate recreation space and traf
fic patterns, "these factors must
be balanced against the paucity
of other sites in Palo Alto," Pres
ident Glaser declared.
