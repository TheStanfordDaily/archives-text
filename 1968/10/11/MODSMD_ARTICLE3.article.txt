# Peace Air Force 'Bombs' US Navy
## 
### DIARMUID McGUIRE 
A lovely, dark eyed Navy offi
cer led two Stanford medical
students and a Vietnam veteran
in a daring airborne leaflet raid
on several miMtary installations
and an aircraft carrier in the
Bay Area yesterday.
Sue Schnall, wearing the spif
fy black and white uniform of a
lieutenant junior grade in the
Navy Nursing Corps, told news
men at Palo Alto airport the
mission was intended to inform
servicemen of the G.l.'s and
Vet's March for Peace, sched
uled to take off from the Pan
handle of Golden Gate Park at
11:00 Saturday morning.
A 1967 graduate of the Stan
ford School of Nursing, Sue is
assigned to the Oak Knoll Na
val Hospital, where she helps to
care for Vietnam casualties. Re

cency she has also been helping
to organize the October 12 ser
vicemen's peace march.
Accompanying Sue in their
rented Piper Cherokee peace
craft were her husband
and Pilot Bill Gray, both fifth
vear medical students at Stan
ford, and James Rondo, a vet
eran of 20 months in Vietnam.
Peter Schnall said the air
borne leaflet drop was moti
vated partly by the harrassment
that march organizers have met
on the ground. "There have been
a lot of efforts on the part of
the services to suppress infor
mation about the march," he
said.
Asked by reporters how his
buddies in Vietnam would react
to his peace activities, former
Sp. 4 Rondo said that he thought

they would appreciate the sup
port. "There are guys dying over
there every day,"he said. "They
like to think that someone is in
terested in their safety."
Desnite advance publicity for
the flight, no military police
were in evidence at Palo Alto
airport when the quartet 'and d.
They said the only difficulty they
encountered was in getting the
leaflets out of the plane. The
windows would not open so they
had to shove them out through
the baggage compartment.
According to a Channel 5 TV
news team, the leaflets missed
the carrier Enterprise but hit
the dock beside the warship. Sue
Schnall reported direct hits on
Yerba Buena Island, Treasure
Island and Oak Knoll Naval
Hospital.

A lovely, dark eyed Navy offi
cer led two Stanford medical
students and a Vietnam veteran
in a daring airborne leaflet raid
on several miMtary installations
and an aircraft carrier in the
Bay Area yesterday.
Sue Schnall, wearing the spif
fy black and white uniform of a
lieutenant junior grade in the
Navy Nursing Corps, told news
men at Palo Alto airport the
mission was intended to inform
servicemen of the G.l.'s and
Vet's March for Peace, sched
uled to take off from the Pan
handle of Golden Gate Park at
11:00 Saturday morning.
A 1967 graduate of the Stan
ford School of Nursing, Sue is
assigned to the Oak Knoll Na
val Hospital, where she helps to
care for Vietnam casualties. Re

cency she has also been helping
to organize the October 12 ser
vicemen's peace march.
Accompanying Sue in their
rented Piper Cherokee peace
craft were her husband
and Pilot Bill Gray, both fifth
vear medical students at Stan
ford, and James Rondo, a vet
eran of 20 months in Vietnam.
Peter Schnall said the air
borne leaflet drop was moti
vated partly by the harrassment
that march organizers have met
on the ground. "There have been
a lot of efforts on the part of
the services to suppress infor
mation about the march," he
said.
Asked by reporters how his
buddies in Vietnam would react
to his peace activities, former
Sp. 4 Rondo said that he thought

they would appreciate the sup
port. "There are guys dying over
there every day,"he said. "They
like to think that someone is in
terested in their safety."
