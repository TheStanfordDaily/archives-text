# Faculty Panel Foresees Possible Czech Democracy
## 
### CHARLIE JONAS 
A vital pulse of democracy
still exists in Czechoslovakia ac
cording to the seven faculty
members at Wednesday night's
panel discussion concerning the
recent events in that nation.
"No expert would have pre
dicted, before January, the Czech
libertarian movement," said
Prof. Gabriel Almond. There
was no indication of possible
democratization, for Czech his
tory during the past thirty years
has been characterized by brutal
tyranny, he added.
Resistance to the Russian in
vasion has taken the form of
passive refusal to co-operate in
any degree with the Russians.
"Passive resistance," explained
Prof. Wayne Vucinich, "has been

the key whenever Czechoslovak
ia has been invaded."
The Russians' move showed
"completely irrational behavior,"
stated Prof. Gordon Craig. The
Soviet inability to cope with the
Czech political situation possibly
indicates a "deep, inter-nascine
struggle" withii- the Soviet
Union.
There is considerable evidence
that Russia "is losing its grip,"
feels Prof. Bertram Wolfe. The
demise of the Warsaw Pact is
near because Pact troops were
used to invade a loyal member.
Satellites Disagree
Communist parties through
out the world have voiced their
disagreement with the Soviet ac
tion. Italian Communist Party
leader Luigi Longo has bom
barded Moscow • ith letters do
minding th? withdrawal of
troops from Czechoslovakia.
There has been some protest
within Russia. When Czech lead-
were meeting with t'leir So
viet counterparts, a group in
Red Square carried placards an
nouncing, in Czech, their sup
port for the regime.
The group was arrested, but
* hen trial last Tues
day, demonstrators demanded
their release, according to Prof.
Wolfe.

The Soviet troops were some
what disconcerted by the events
following their arrival, added
Prof. Wolfe. "They came with
the story that they were invited,
but they couldn't find anyone
who wanted them." Nor have the
Soviets been able to find a lead
er willing or able to reverse the
democratic trend of recent
months.
New Unity
Prof. Jan Triska reported that
on his recent visit to Czechoslo
vakia, he realized that the in
vasion "brought unity to the
Czech and Slovak people" that
thoy had not had ino 1939.
There are no dissid ni factions
in the country, according to
Triska.

what disconcerted by the events
following their arrival, added
Prof. Wolfe. "They came with
the story that they were invited,
but they couldn't find anyone
who wanted them." Nor have the
Soviets been able to find a lead
er willing or able to reverse the
democratic trend of recent
months.
New Unity
Prof. Jan Triska reported that
on his recent visit to Czechoslo
vakia, he realized that the in
vasion "brought unity to the
Czech and Slovak people" that
thoy had not had ino 1939.
There are no dissid ni factions
in the country, according to
Triska.
Members of the Stanford com
munity wishing to voice their
for the Czech people
may do so by signing the peti
tion available from the Stan
ford-for-Czcchoslovakia commit
tee. Monetary contributions are
welcomed to support those sci
entists, writers, and authors who
have left their homes because of
fear of arrest.
A vital pulse of democracy
still exists in Czechoslovakia ac
cording to the seven faculty
members at Wednesday night's
panel discussion concerning the
recent events in that nation.
"No expert would have pre
dicted, before January, the Czech
libertarian movement," said
Prof. Gabriel Almond. There
was no indication of possible
democratization, for Czech his
tory during the past thirty years
has been characterized by brutal
tyranny, he added.
Resistance to the Russian in
vasion has taken the form of
passive refusal to co-operate in
any degree with the Russians.
"Passive resistance," explained
Prof. Wayne Vucinich, "has been

the key whenever Czechoslovak
ia has been invaded."
The Russians' move showed
"completely irrational behavior,"
stated Prof. Gordon Craig. The
Soviet inability to cope with the
Czech political situation possibly
indicates a "deep, inter-nascine
struggle" withii- the Soviet
Union.
There is considerable evidence
that Russia "is losing its grip,"
feels Prof. Bertram Wolfe. The
demise of the Warsaw Pact is
near because Pact troops were
used to invade a loyal member.
Satellites Disagree
Communist parties through
out the world have voiced their
disagreement with the Soviet ac
tion. Italian Communist Party
leader Luigi Longo has bom
barded Moscow • ith letters do
minding th? withdrawal of
troops from Czechoslovakia.
There has been some protest
within Russia. When Czech lead-
were meeting with t'leir So
viet counterparts, a group in
Red Square carried placards an
nouncing, in Czech, their sup
port for the regime.
The group was arrested, but
* hen trial last Tues
day, demonstrators demanded
their release, according to Prof.
Wolfe.

The Soviet troops were some
what disconcerted by the events
following their arrival, added
Prof. Wolfe. "They came with
the story that they were invited,
but they couldn't find anyone
who wanted them." Nor have the
