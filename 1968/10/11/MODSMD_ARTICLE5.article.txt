## SDS Sets Demand Deadline 
### BARBARA RITZ 
Students for a Democratic So
cicty (SDS) have clarified wha
initial "action" it will use tf
achieve its demands from th<
University and Stanford Re
search Institute (SRI).
After a noon White Plaza rallj
Monday, SDS members will leac
a march to SRI to "see what th<
eaction is," according to SDS
member David Pußh.
SDS set a deadline of Mon
dav, October 14, for meeting tht
following demands:
"All contracts, both classified
and unclassified, be made pub
lic, complete with information on
the value of the contracts and
the individuals performing the
work; Stanford and SRI trus
tees make public all their corp
orate and governmental connec
tions; and the Stanford faculty
make public all their governmen
tal and corporate contracts and
connections."
Ask Cooperation
Members of SDS called the
demands a statement of "pur
pose and intention," and ex
pressed a strong desire for "co
operation" from SRI and the
University in producing the in
formation on its corporate and
government connections.
SDS also distributed a printed
leaflet sketching the military
and governmental activities of a
number of Stanford professors
and trustees and SRI directors.
One engineering facultv mem
ber mentioned in the leaflet told
the Daily that h had not seen

the demands as printed, nor was
he aware that his name was on
the list.
Inferences Drawn
"There's no question of th">
accuracy of what the SDS has
been saying," he commented.
"It's the inference of what they
are saving that is incorrect." The
faculty member explained that
he had c erved on government
boards in the past and that he
will continue to do so.
He commenteed that the
moral inplications were not ig
nored, and that he carefully
evaluated the alternatives before
doing defense work.
SDS made public Tuesday a
formal announcement to the
Stanford Trustees posted onto
the Board of Trustees Office
door:
"We, the members of Stan
ford SDS and concerned mem
bers of the Stanford community,
demand that Stanford Univer
sity, its wholly owned subsidiary,
the Stanford Research Institute,
and all members of the univer
sity community immediately halt
all military and economic proj
ects and operations concerned
with Southeast Asia."
Fill Them In
Members of the SDS, then vis
ited campus residences to "pro
vide th> Stanford community
with all the information," said
Fred Cohen, another member.
In its printed resolutions pre
sented to campus residents SDS
•liioiTnH that SRI does chemical

and biological warfare research,
including tear gas and crop do
foliation.
SRI has had 55 staff members
doing eountor-insurponcy work
in Thailand since 1962: is per
forming cost analvsis of alterna
tive bombing sights over North
Vietnam; and is doing long
range survevs of invostment op
portunities in Southeast Asia for
U.S. corporations, SDS claimed.
Decided Monday
The demands were voted at'
a meeting attended by approxi
mately 200 SDS members and
supporters Monday night.
The resolutions also charged
that "many Stanford and SRI
trustees are major executives of
1) war-based corporations such
as MacDonell-Douglas, Hewlett-
Packard, and General Dynam
ics and 2) corporations with
heavy investments in Southeast
Asia such as Tenneco, Utah Con
struction, and Kaiser."
The SDS also noted that "many
Stanford faculty members con
sult for or serve as directors of
nearby war - based companies
and serve on Defense Depart
ment subsidized advisory boards
and committees."
SDS has been particularly ac
tive this fall in organizing pro
grams and membership support.
The SDS presented a film on
Hie Columbia demonstrations
Wednesday in Memorial Audi
torium, featuring a speech by
Mark Rudd, one of the leaders
of the national student revolt.
