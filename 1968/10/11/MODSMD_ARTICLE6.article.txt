# Demonstration Policy Passed
## 
### 
Faculty representatives yes
terday formally endorsed Stan
ford's new policy on campus dis
ruption and said alleged faculty
violations should be heard by the
same judicial group that hears
students.
Adopted by a 42-3 majority,
the action came in response to
a request from Acting President
Robert Glaser and followed the
recommendation of the Advisory
Board, a seven-man group elect
ed by the faculty.
Binding On The Faculty
The Senate of the Academic
Council, which approved the new
rules in principle "as appropri
ate for the entire University

community" Sept. 12, endorsed
the final version issued Monday
by Glaser as binding upon the
faculty.
In general, the interim rules
make it a policy violation to pre
vent or disrupt university func
tions or to interfere with the
legitimate movement of individ
uals on campus.
They also oblige students, fac
ulty, and staff members to leave
buildings and to identify them
selves, if disruption occurs and
they are asked to do so by a
member of the university com
munitv, acting in his official role
and identifying himself as such.
Under the Senate action, al
leged faculty violations of this
policy would be heard by the
same group which heard stu
dents, following identical proce
dures.
Findings of the judicial group
would be recommendations to
the University president, just as
in the case of students.
Sanctions for faculty would
range from censure—a finding of
violation without recommenda
tion of penalty—to instigation of
procedures which could lead to
dismissal. Several intermediate
penalties may be developed later.
The University's tenure state
ment, revised last year and ap
proved by both faculty and trus
tees, permit formal hearings by
the Advisory Board in cases in
volving disciplinary reductions
in salary or recommendations
for dismissal of faculty mem
bers. This procedure would re
main unchanged.
Early this fall, President Gla
ser appointed a Temporary Ju
dicial Council to serve until such
time as students may approve a
new Stanford Judicial Council.
This proposal will go to a cam
pus-wide referendum Monday
and Tuesday.
