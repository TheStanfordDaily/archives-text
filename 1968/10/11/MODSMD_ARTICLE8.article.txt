# Grapes Disappearing
## 
### 
Grapes have practically disap
peared from the Stanford cam
pus.
William Meyers, Stanford food
service manager said yesterday
that "grapes are no longer being
served in the residence halls."
Even in halls where students
have not specifically supported
the boycott grapes have been re
moved from the menu.
"If the students desire them
we will serve them," Meyers
said.
Forrest Tregea, manager of
Tresidder Union and the faculty
club, refused to acknowledge
that the boycott had affected his
food purchasing policy.
"We have not served grapes
during the last three weeks be
cause they have not been good,"
Tregea said. He added that if
student opinion was generally
opposed to the serving of grapes,
he would go along with the boy
cott.
About 300 pounds of grapes
are normally consumed each
week in the residence halls dur
ing the fall season. They are
often included in fruit salad.
Last week only 30 pounds were
used and no more have been or
dered.
