# A 						PIGS EYE VIEW

### SKIP HARRIS 
For most of you at the Youngbloods concert it was probably little
more than a show. For the fifty of us who were student police it
was an education.
We were assigned to protect the "integrity" of the fence around
Frost. In the bushes around that fence were at least 500 school-age
kids.
They were not from East Palo Alto. They were "middle-class"
whites. Throughout the evening there were little circles of people
in the shadows smoking Dot. The whole atmosphere was somewhat
unreal. It was incredibly tense for that kind of situation.
All of those kids had come there to get in free and some of them
came shouldering huge chips. It was like they wanted another Chi
cago with the student police and a handful of Santa Clara sheriff's
deputies.
If we had ever been assaulted I would have been with the rest
doing my best to avoid violence by leaving quickly. But we did try
to keep people out if we could.
There just did not seem to exist the kind of a game between the
students and the kids that one might have expected. There was
very little of the feeling "I'll just try and get in without getting
caught."
I identified with most of the kids across the fence. I had hopped
a few fences myself. I felt no antagonism towards them and it
didn't seem right that they should feel so much towards me.
I didn't care if they resented my presence or called me a dumb
cop. What surprised most of us was the personal and violent nature
of most of the insults. Most of us were spat at and a few were hit
with stones.
We had a glimpse of what it must be like walking a beat in the
ghetto. When I think of how little that experience actually resem
bled the violence of Harlem or Watts it terrifies me to think of the
pressure that a policeman must be under in riot situations.
As the evening matured, we learned something else. There was
very little we could do to prevent someone from hopping the fence
or starting a fight. I could not say "Don't or I'll shoot!" or "Don't
or I'll club you!" I had neither a gun nor a club.
The interesting thing is that we were pretty much effective. We
were forced to learn that other things would work.
There is little doubt in my mind that if we had threatened vio
lence the situation would have become violent. We had to eliminate
the "confrontation" atmosphere. We had to make it quite obvious
that we weren't out there to crack heads. I think that towards the
end we succeeded in this. That we had no weapons helped reinforce
the point.
We all got to see a bit of what it must be like for a cop in front
of a mob. For the first time we students had to think about what
must have been going through the minds of the police in Chicago.
But we also saw some of the things that can cause an intense
hatred of the police. You have to fear The Man just because he has
the power of life and death over you.
By the same token a cop has one hell of a dangerous job. He may
have to protect himself against someone with a gun.
What is the result of this in the climate of today? Escalation:
both sides are arming for Armageddon. The words of Chekhov
scream at us from the past: "If in the first act you hang a pistol on
the wall, by the third act you must use it."
For most of us that night it became obvious that there is prob
ably a better solution. For me it became obvious that there had
best be.
