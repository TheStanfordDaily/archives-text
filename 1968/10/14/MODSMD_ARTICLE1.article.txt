# Asia Involvement
## SDS To Protest SRI 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Stanford Students for a Demo
cratic Society (SDS) have called
a noon rally-caravan for today
in protest against Stanford Re
search Institute (SRI) and its in
volvement in classified military
research.
A poll conducted this weekend
bv The Daily, however, shows
that less than 25 per cent of the
Stanford student body supports
the SDS demands. The poll also
indicates that only four per cent
of the student body plan to par
ticipate in the protest at SRl's
Menlo Park headquarters. (See
tabulation at end of story.)
In a related development, act
ing president Glaser yesterday
asked ASSU president Denis
Hayes to name five students to
a twelve-man committee to ex
amine the University's ties with
SRI. Glaser also asked the fac
ulty Academic Senate to name
five people to the committee.
The administration will name
the other two members.
The SDS rally will begin in
White P'aza at noon with speak
ers on SRl's activities in South
east Asia. SDS members report
that a former employee of SRI
may address the rally on the In
stitute's military research.
Following the White Plaza ral
ly cars will leave for SRl's com
plex in Menlo Park where the
protest will continue. Exactly
what form the protest will take
is uncertain. SDS officials say
that no violent confrontation is
planned but that some individ
uals may try to get arrested.
They emphasize that any at
tempts at getting arrested will
be individual decisions, not sup
ported by the SDS chapter.
New Committee Formed
Glaser announced the forma
tion of the student-faculty com
mittee Thursday night in a
speech before the student legis
lature. Formation of the commit
tee has drawn mixed reaction
from the Stanford SDS chapter

and an endorsement from SRI
officials.
In a statement re'eased to The
Daily yesterday afternoon SRI
said they would "cooperate fully
with the investigating commit
tee. He further said that the
"Institute's responsibilities . . .
to its clients, however, preclude
acceptance of the recent SDS
demands."
Early yesterday afternoon the
Daily received a fiver signed by
the "SDS Action Committee."
"Not onlv are the lepal ties of
SRI to Stanford well known, but
. . . the trustees (manv of who
are on SRl's Board of Directors)
are weM aware of the types of
research being undertaken there.
. . . the fiver said.
Disaffiliation From SRI
The fiver suggests that the
study will be followed by disaf
filiation of Stanford from SRI,
"a legal shift" which "would
mean no real change at all nei
ther in purpose or activities"
but would be designed to "hide
realitv and to give many people
the chance to wash their hands
of the issue."
The statement, however, was
later disavowed by SDS leaders
who said that members of the
Stanford chapter had not yet
made up their minds on Glaser's
committee proposal. Glaser has
set an April 15 deadline for the
committee's report.

the other two members.
The SDS rally will begin in
White P'aza at noon with speak
ers on SRl's activities in South
east Asia. SDS members report
that a former employee of SRI
may address the rally on the In
stitute's military research.
Following the White Plaza ral
ly cars will leave for SRl's com
plex in Menlo Park where the
protest will continue. Exactly
what form the protest will take
is uncertain. SDS officials say
that no violent confrontation is
planned but that some individ
uals may try to get arrested.
They emphasize that any at
tempts at getting arrested will
be individual decisions, not sup
ported by the SDS chapter.
New Committee Formed
Glaser announced the forma
tion of the student-faculty com
mittee Thursday night in a
speech before the student legis
lature. Formation of the commit
tee has drawn mixed reaction
from the Stanford SDS chapter

and an endorsement from SRI
officials.
In a statement re'eased to The
Daily yesterday afternoon SRI
said they would "cooperate fully
with the investigating commit
tee. He further said that the
"Institute's responsibilities . . .
to its clients, however, preclude
acceptance of the recent SDS
demands."
Early yesterday afternoon the
Daily received a fiver signed by
the "SDS Action Committee."
"Not onlv are the lepal ties of
SRI to Stanford well known, but
. . . the trustees (manv of who
are on SRl's Board of Directors)
are weM aware of the types of
research being undertaken there.
. . . the fiver said.
Disaffiliation From SRI
The fiver suggests that the
study will be followed by disaf
filiation of Stanford from SRI,
"a legal shift" which "would
mean no real change at all nei
ther in purpose or activities"
but would be designed to "hide
realitv and to give many people
the chance to wash their hands
of the issue."
The statement, however, was
later disavowed by SDS leaders
who said that members of the
Stanford chapter had not yet
made up their minds on Glaser's
committee proposal. Glaser has
set an April 15 deadline for the
committee's report.
Stanford Students for a Demo
cratic Society (SDS) have called
a noon rally-caravan for today
in protest against Stanford Re
search Institute (SRI) and its in
volvement in classified military
research.
A poll conducted this weekend
bv The Daily, however, shows
that less than 25 per cent of the
Stanford student body supports
the SDS demands. The poll also
indicates that only four per cent
of the student body plan to par
ticipate in the protest at SRl's
Menlo Park headquarters. (See
tabulation at end of story.)
In a related development, act
ing president Glaser yesterday
asked ASSU president Denis
Hayes to name five students to
a twelve-man committee to ex
amine the University's ties with
SRI. Glaser also asked the fac
ulty Academic Senate to name
five people to the committee.
The administration will name
the other two members.
