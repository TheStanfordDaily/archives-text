# CONSTITUTIONS
## 
### 
The two proposed constitutions that go before
the student body for ratification this morning
present an interesting problem for the voter. We
cannot recommend that he vote for one or the
other or both.
We believe that the weakness and lack of fore
thought shown in the shorter constitution makes
it unattractive. Devotion to outmoded forms of
student government makes the longer one equally
repugnant.
In the end, it seems to us that Denis Hayes'
proposal is more coherent on the whole, but the
other constitution raises important questions
about the freedom of students to organize as they
wish.
The second document is a step toward a radical
reappraisal of the functions of student govern
ment, and its idea of setting up student govern
ment as a voluntary association which students
would not be required to join might strengthen
the committment of participating students. It is
unfortunate that the legal questions involved
were not carefully examined and that the proposal
itself is so incoherent in places.
Hayes' Constitution
The longer constitution sets up an association,
similar to the present one, that draws membership
from all students of the University. It sets up a 21-
member Senate as "final representative authority."
The Senate would have ten undergraduate mem
bers elected in a manner to be set out in bylaws
and 10 graduate members to be elected from the
various graduate schools.
The Senate could make budgets, appoint per
sons to committees, enact bylaws, and would hold
biweekly meetings usually.
The constitution would establish a president
and vice-president, the latter presiding over the
Senate.
The constitution provides that a judicial body
be recognized only if approved by a two-thirds
vote of students, and outlines a list of rights of
students along the lines of the U.S. Constitution's
Bill of Rights.
The constitution introduces a financial innova
tion in that it would allow a referendum of the stu

dent body to set the total fee level after a "base
level" of dues had been set by the Senate. Half
of the fees above the base-level would be remitted
to graduate and underrgaduate associations on a
per capita basis.
The association's financial manager would be
appo'nted by a student committee, and not by the
Dean of Students as at present.
The Shorter Constitution
The shorter constitution, which could legally be
adopted along with the longer one, would estab
lish a voluntary students' union, which would be
incorporated under state law. The constitution
authorizes formation of political parties and pro
vides for a Representative Assembly that would
meet once a month. A 30-member Senate, elected
from the members of the Assembly, would meet
weekly, and all its decisions would be subject to
review of the Assembly. The Assembly would be
elected from living units and off-campus students
on the ratio of one legislator for every 100 stu
dents.
In a bill of rights section, the constitution asserts
that all government authority derives only from
the consent of the governed and that students
therefore must participate directly in University
decisions affecting them. It also says that students
have the right to form voluntary associations not
controlled financially by the association.
