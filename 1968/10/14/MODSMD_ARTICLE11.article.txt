# JUDICIAL SYSTEM
## 
### 
The new judicial system proposed by the Com
mittee of Fifteen last spring and coming up for a
vote today and tomorrow is a very poorly written
document. But it is our opinion that it should be
adopted until March 1, 1969.
Students can vote either "no" or "yes until
March 1, 1969," according to a recent vote by the
Legislature. The stipulation that this be a tempor
ary system should make it clear to the student
faculty-adininistration Committee of Fifteen that
Stanford students want something better before
the year is out.
Establishing a student-faculty legislative body
on conduct, the proposal would give the faculty
a majority and let students select only three of
five student members in a referendum. The other

students would serve by virtue of their positions
as speaker of the Legislature and president of the
Associated Students.
The faculty members would be chosen by the
University president with the help of the Aca
demic Council. Actions by the body require only
seven positive votes; that is ,at one student
must vote with the faculty members to enact any
rule.
To enforce rules made by the legislative council,
the report sets up a Stanford Judicial Council con
sisting of four faculty members, four students, and
a chairman selected by the University president
from the law school faculty. Again the faculty has
a majority.
The question of the triple jeopardy under which
students live is ignored in the document. Under
the proposed system as well the present system
a student faces prosecution by the civil authorities
for his actions, suspension from the University,
and subsequent induction into the armed services.
We believe the provisions for a Judicial Aide to
look into the details of the cases before the Judi
cial Council are wise, and the official provision for
establishing overseas campus judicial councils is
very good in principle.
But the document gets very hazy indeed when
the question of amendment of the charter comes
up. It would be very easy for the legislative or
judicial councils to recommend to the three con
stituencies involved (the Associated Students,
the Academic Council, and the President) that the
charter be amended.
It would not be so easy for the students to raise
a yes vote of about 2400 students (20 percent of
the student body as required by the proposal) to
initiate consideration of an amendment. The Aca
demic Council is also required to muster 200 yes
voting members for amendments even though the
quarterly meetings of that body usually draw only
about 150 professors. And an amendment request
merely goes to the Committee of Fifteen, which
has to formulate it and prepare it for a ratification
ballot.
If the charter is adopted, we urge the Commit
tee of Fifteen to move rapidly to amend it to in
clude a student majority on both councils.
We also urge the Committee to consider offi
cial elimination of the penalty of suspension, ex
cept in the case of academic crimes.
