## View Of Cleaver 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
Eldridge Cleaver appealed to
us students as the only sane peo
ple in American society; our re
action to some of his ideas I'm
afraid belied that faith.
He called on us to realize our
racist heritage, to recognize that
the survival of this country de
pends on our taking on our in
dividual hearts and minds and
bodies a working commitment
to dignity and freedom.
His vision is radical and
strange: the establishment of

human institutions on human
values.
Were we responding in his
spirit by cheering the specter of
revolution in the streets? Cer
tainly we must recognize that
the foundation of American so
ciety is rotten, and that the
whole building might have to
come down for it to be fixed, but
what quality of awareness finds
that prospect desirable?
Clearly Cleaver doesn't, or he
would have been in the streets
Tuesday night rather than in

Mem Aud, plugging responsible
black-white coaHtions.
Perhaps some of our motiva
tions are limited to feelings of
guilt, which we expunge period
ically by lauding someone else's
resolve to fix our own house.
What kind of humanist recon
struction will that con
sciousness beget?
America has been conscient
ously silent for generations; we
might reflect a little more now
while raising our voices.
