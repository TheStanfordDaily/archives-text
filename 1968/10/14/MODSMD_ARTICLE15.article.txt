## Glaser Questioned

Editor, THE DAILY:
Open Letter to President Glaser
To many students who oppose
the Vietnam war, the proposal of
a six-month study of SRI ap
pears to be an effort on your
part to stall, hoping to put the
issue of Stanford's involvement
in the war effort in abeyance
until the school year is over. . . .
Are you willing to answer in
public the following questions
within the next few days and
other questions that members
of the community might wish to
pose?
1) Why can't the full informa
tion on SRl's defense and "devel
opment" contracts be made pub
lic immediately? How can a free
and open inquiry into SRI be
conducted while important infor
mation about the most advanced
military research projects is
kept from the public's eye by
designating it "classified?"
2) Why can't the study be
given highest priority in view
of the signficance of the war is
sue? Why can't the study be
shortened to three or four
freeks?
3) How can the proposed study
be objective? . . . Will the com
mittee work from the assump
tion that a truly neutral univer
sity would not be involved in
warfare and overseas "develop
ment" research?
4) While those students who
have made SRl's defense and
"development" research an issue
be well represented on the com
fnittee?
5) If the committee, unlikely
as it may seem, decided that
much of SRl's work was in sup
port of the oppressive American
intervention in Southeast Asia,
would the administration and
trustees, those responsible for
founding SRI, be willing to ter
minate that work, instead of
merely "disassociating" SRI
from Stanford?

6) Will you be willing to ex
pand the scope of the study to
include the relationships be
tween trustees' business inter
ests and the war effort? . . .
7) Can you allay the fears
that many students have about
the seriousness of the proposed
study by quickly responding to
these and other questions?
