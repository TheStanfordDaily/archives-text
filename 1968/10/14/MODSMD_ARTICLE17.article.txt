# The 						President
## About This Election 
### DENIS HAYES 
One night, as we were passing out copies of the
newly-drafted constitution over dinner, we were
greeted by two good-humored fellows who said
they sort of dug the constitution-making scene.
Further, they thought they would draw up one of
their own to put on the ballot with ours.
Now that the election is upon us I think I should
favor their remarkable document with some re
marks.
1. The constitution proposed by the Committee
for Student Responsibility would abolish all oth
er student governmental organizations immedi
ately, but the new constitution itself would not
come into effect until the "Union" it establishes
can become incorporated.
In California the process of incorporation can
be reasonably lengthy, a one year wait not being
unusual. A vote for this constitution effectively
means that students will be prohibited from par
ticipating in university goverance for the rest of
this year.
2. It is impossible to suggest how large the
"Representative Assembly" their document pro
poses will be; the authors themselves can only
give guesses. Four hundred people, however,
would clearly be a conservative estimate.
Due to sloppiness in writing this section, the
Assembly might conceivably range over 1000
people. Since we're seldom able to round up more
than 50 or 60 people for a LASSU meeting, figures
in excess of 400 seem a little ambitious.
3. The constitution (Sec 11, A) clearly states
that the final legislative power of the organization
lies within this Assembly. That means that deci
sions of the Assembly cannot be reversed, even
by an overwhelming vote of the members.
4. The much-heralded provision for political
parties implies that political parties are somehow
presently impossible. As a matter of fact, the
graduate students had a working political party

a couple of years ago which captured control of
LASSU. It has since disbanded, but others can
easily be formed, even under the existing system.
5. The constitution proposed by the Commit
tee for Student Responsibility has judicial sec
tions which would leave any student who didn't
want to pay his dues (and who determines the
dues level?) out in the cold, without any legal
rights at Stanford at all.
6. The provision regarding the providing of
legal counsel is a clear path to bankruptcy. The
first time a student was accused of some crime
and demanded Melvin Belli as liib lawyer, the
whole year's budget would be wiped out in one
fell swoop.
7. The president of the "Union" gets to appoint
all the judges, all the committee representatives,
and the Treasurer. Now "checks and balances"
can clearly be overdone, but that seems like a
lot of authority for one individual.
Student selection of student representatives in
university governance has long been a hang-up.
The "Student Responsibility" would throw
this gain away, at precisely that time that we are
getting full voting participation on all commit
tees. This year students will be making funda
mental decisions on every aspect of their lives,
from low-cost housing to ROTC, from SRI to
parking facilities.
As the new voluntary organization would rep
resent only a small fraction of the student body
(the fraction rich enough to pay its dues), it
could certainly not claim the right to determine
who student representatives should be.
The constitution proposed by the Committee for
Student Responsibility has been characterized
as the most poorly drafted document ever brought
to a vote.
But that's all water over the dam now. Just be
sure to vote for the new ASSU constitution and
bylaw and to vote against the crude miscarriage
of the Committee for Student Responsibility.

for Student Responsibility would abolish all oth
er student governmental organizations immedi
ately, but the new constitution itself would not
come into effect until the "Union" it establishes
can become incorporated.
In California the process of incorporation can
be reasonably lengthy, a one year wait not being
unusual. A vote for this constitution effectively
means that students will be prohibited from par
ticipating in university goverance for the rest of
this year.
2. It is impossible to suggest how large the
"Representative Assembly" their document pro
poses will be; the authors themselves can only
give guesses. Four hundred people, however,
would clearly be a conservative estimate.
Due to sloppiness in writing this section, the
Assembly might conceivably range over 1000
people. Since we're seldom able to round up more
than 50 or 60 people for a LASSU meeting, figures
in excess of 400 seem a little ambitious.
3. The constitution (Sec 11, A) clearly states
that the final legislative power of the organization
lies within this Assembly. That means that deci
sions of the Assembly cannot be reversed, even
by an overwhelming vote of the members.
4. The much-heralded provision for political
parties implies that political parties are somehow
presently impossible. As a matter of fact, the
graduate students had a working political party

a couple of years ago which captured control of
LASSU. It has since disbanded, but others can
easily be formed, even under the existing system.
5. The constitution proposed by the Commit
tee for Student Responsibility has judicial sec
tions which would leave any student who didn't
want to pay his dues (and who determines the
dues level?) out in the cold, without any legal
rights at Stanford at all.
6. The provision regarding the providing of
legal counsel is a clear path to bankruptcy. The
first time a student was accused of some crime
and demanded Melvin Belli as liib lawyer, the
whole year's budget would be wiped out in one
fell swoop.
7. The president of the "Union" gets to appoint
all the judges, all the committee representatives,
and the Treasurer. Now "checks and balances"
can clearly be overdone, but that seems like a
lot of authority for one individual.
Student selection of student representatives in
university governance has long been a hang-up.
The "Student Responsibility" would throw
this gain away, at precisely that time that we are
getting full voting participation on all commit
tees. This year students will be making funda
mental decisions on every aspect of their lives,
from low-cost housing to ROTC, from SRI to
parking facilities.
As the new voluntary organization would rep
resent only a small fraction of the student body
(the fraction rich enough to pay its dues), it
could certainly not claim the right to determine
who student representatives should be.
The constitution proposed by the Committee for
Student Responsibility has been characterized
as the most poorly drafted document ever brought
to a vote.
But that's all water over the dam now. Just be
sure to vote for the new ASSU constitution and
bylaw and to vote against the crude miscarriage
of the Committee for Student Responsibility.
One night, as we were passing out copies of the
newly-drafted constitution over dinner, we were
greeted by two good-humored fellows who said
they sort of dug the constitution-making scene.
Further, they thought they would draw up one of
their own to put on the ballot with ours.
Now that the election is upon us I think I should
favor their remarkable document with some re
marks.
