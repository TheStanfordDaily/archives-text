# IT'S NO JOKE

### DICK GREGORY 
In his First Inaugural Address
delivered March 4, 1861, Abra
ham Lincoln Said: "This coun
try, with its institutions, belongs
to the people who inhabit it.
When ever they shall grow
of the existing Govern
ment, they can exercise their
constitutional right of amending
it or their revolutionary right to
dismember or overthrow it . .
It is a curious statement by
one of our greatest Americans
to be read at a time when the
demand for law and order is
being used to suppress the right
of dissent.
A recurring question these
days, which has become almost
as popular in the national vocab
ulary as the cry for law and
order, is "What do these revolu
tionaries want?" Black militants,
New Left radicals and student
revolutionaries are increasingly
faulted for not having a blue
print for the kind of social and
political order they envision.
"These revolutionaries," peo
ple are fond of saying, "merely
want to tear the country down
but they have nothing to erect
in its place."
It seems curiously interesting
to me that no one ask George
Washington and the Sons of Lib
erty what their Constitution
would look like before the Amer
ican Revolution.
The weariness to which Lin
coln refers is part of the natural
process of evolution, which is

slow and gradual change. The
fulfillment of evolution is revo
lution, or quick change.
When a woman becomes preg
nant, the nine-month gestation
period is part of the process of
evolution. But at the end of the
nine months, revolution — quick
change—follows. And all the Na
tional Guardsmen or federal
troops in the world cannot keep
that baby from coming forth.
The revolutionary activity in
America today is part of the
same natural process. Once the
idea of freedom becomes impreg
nated in the national body, the
evolutionary process leading to
ward the fulfillment of revolu
tion has already begun.
If a woman wants an abortion,
she must have it performed dur
ing the early stages of her preg
nancy. The longer she waits, the
greater the chance of death for
both the mother and the child.
So it is also with a national ;
body impregnated with the idea
of freedom. America is already
well into this pregnancy and to
try to perform an abortion now,
in the form of repression and
thwarting of dissent, will surely j
mean death for both the mother
country and her children.
It is frightening to see so many
people attempt to resist the nat
ural forces at work in the evolu
tion of American society. Stu
dent radicals and revolutionaries !
are viewed with horror and their
campus take-overs are termed.
disgraceful. But for years stu

dents have been going to Fort
Lauderdale, Florida, during their
spring vacation and rioting on
the beaches.
National consensus viewed
these acts as just part of the
process of kids growing up. It
was the same when college stu
dents were conducting pantie
raids, swallowing goldfish and
cramming into telephone booths.
Such acts were excused as the
irresponsible foolishness which
accompanies the growing up
process.
Now that revolution is in the

air on college campuses all over
the country, national consensus
is of a different sort. There is a
general feeling that today's cam
pus disorders should be thwarted
and students disciplined.
Yet college students today are
asking, indeed demanding, more
responsibility rather *han en
gaging in irresponsible actions.
College students are seeking the
responsibility of self-government
and a voice in determining the
forms which will defiine their
education. They are refusing to
accept an irresponsible role.

Now that revolution is in the

air on college campuses all over
the country, national consensus
is of a different sort. There is a
general feeling that today's cam

asking, indeed demanding, more
responsibility rather *han en

College students are seeking the

It is a curious statement by
one of our greatest Americans
to be read at a time when the
demand for law and order is
being used to suppress the right
of dissent.
A recurring question these
days, which has become almost
as popular in the national vocab
ulary as the cry for law and
order, is "What do these revolu
tionaries want?" Black militants,
New Left radicals and student
revolutionaries are increasingly
faulted for not having a blue
print for the kind of social and
political order they envision.
"These revolutionaries," peo
ple are fond of saying, "merely
want to tear the country down
but they have nothing to erect
in its place."
It seems curiously interesting
to me that no one ask George
Washington and the Sons of Lib

When a woman becomes preg

nine months, revolution — quick

that baby from coming forth.

If a woman wants an abortion,

in the form of repression and
