# Ehrlich Discusses Threat
## Dangers Of Overpopulation 
### 
"Whatever your cause, it's a
lost cause unless we have popu
lation control," said Biology Pro
fessor Paul Ehrlich in an unex
pected "sermon" on the popula
tion problem yesterday morning
in Memorial Church. Professor
Ehrlich had been asked to speak

due to the illness of Dean Napier.
Ehrlich's address, taken large
ly from his book The Population
Bomb, focused on the statistical
facts of overpopulation and on
the moral dilemmas that this
problem imposes.
Our presently urgent condi
tion began when man gave up
hunting for his food and instead
took up agriculture, said Ehr
lich. Man thereby created simp
ler but more unstable ecological
systems which have now gotten
out of control. "Of the approxi
mately three and a third billion
people in the world today, be
tween one and two billion are
hungry."
The look for the future, he
containued, is frightening. "If
present growth rates continue,
the world's population will have
doubled in 35 years." But the
problem is even worse than these
figures suggest. In the underde
veloped countries, where the cri
sis is already most acute, the
population will have doubled els
early as 19 years from now. "If
present rates could be continued
indefinitely," he noted, within
900 years were would have more
than 200 people on each square
yard, land and sea."
Science Inadequate
Professor Ehrlich denied that
science could adequately solve

the problem. "Since the world
cannot feed the three billion peo
ple we have today, it obviously
won't be able to feel twice that
number in the year two thous
and."
The newest agricultural in
novations will be inadequate.
Agriculture is "not coming close
today, and the latest word from
India is that the much balley
hooed 'green revolution' is over
already."
Furthermore, to those who
claim that the sea can be exploit
ed as an infinite source of food,
Professor Ehrlich pointed out
that instead of increasing our
yield from the sea, we are actual
ly upsetting its ecological bal
ance and polluting it.
Another "solution" which Ehr
lich criticized was the idea of
transporting people from over
populated areas of the globe to
less crowded areas. "It would
take every commercial Ameri
can plane, working full time,
just to move India's increase in
population in one year to the
United States."
Moral Issues
Nor could we expect to trans
port people to other planets, he
emphasized. An Apollo rocket
costs $145 million, and if we
could put 100 people on an Apol
lo, we would need to send off

2000 rockets every day to take
care of the world increase of
70 million people per year.
Professor Ehrlich continued
by speaking of the moral issues
which have been raised by over
population. "By refusing to deal
realistically with the problem,
we are committing countries like
India to mass famine and pesti
lence which could wipe out more
than 90 per cent of their pop
ulation. These conditions in the
under-developed countries cause
world-wide political instability.
"Unless we choose to accept
Curt Lemay's solution, thermo
nuclear war, we must control
the birth rate."
Protests Pope's Stand
Ehrlich attacked those who
oppose this effort as "enemies
of mankind." Noting a quote be
lieved to be from George Ber
nard Shaw, Ehrlich asked, "Why
should we take advice on sex
from the Pope? If he knows any
thing about it, he shouldn't."
In closing, Professor Ehrlich
charged Protestants with con
centrating too much on the ecu
menical movement with the
O'Boyles and the Maclntyres and
the Catholic establishment and
urged instead that they support
the thousands of responsible
Catholics who are protesting the
Pope's encyclical.
