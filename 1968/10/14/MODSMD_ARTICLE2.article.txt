# Daily Poll
## 
### 
Over the weekend members of
the Daily staff conducted phone
interviews with a cross-section
of the Stanford student body.
Two questions were asked:
first, "Do you support the de
mand made by the Stanford
chapter of SDS to President Gla
ser and SRI this week? (The
demand was that Stanford and
SRI cease "forthwith" all in
volvement in Southeast Asia;

the full text of the demand was
read to each respondent); sec
ond. "will you participate in the
demonstration planned by SDS
at SRI Monday?"
Queried were 123 students se
lected, at random, from a com
puter list of all registered stu
dents. Variable taken into ac
count in selecting pollees in
cluded sex, school (i.e. engineer
ing, law, etc.) and whether they
were graduate or undergraduate.
An after the fact check showed
that the breakdown by residence
was fairly accurate (i.e. on cam
pus, ofT-campus or in a fraterni
ty).
Marshall Schwartz, associate
editor of The Dailv and a third
year graduate student in statis
tics. devised the poll. According
to Schwartz, the poll is as accu
rate as the national polls.
Schwartz added that while four
percent of the student body in
dicated they would like to par
ticipate in today's demonstra
tion in Menlo Park, many said
they might not show up because
of "classes" or other conflicts.
Four per cent would be 500, and
Schwartz says 200 "wou'd be a
better maximum estimate." The
poll does not include non-stu
dents.
