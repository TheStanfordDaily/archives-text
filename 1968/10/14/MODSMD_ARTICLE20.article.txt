# Forum Scrutinizes Population Problem
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Secretary of the Interior Stu
art Udall asked recently "Is
There a Population Problem?"
The Stanford Population and En
vironment Forum (SPEF) will
spend the rest of this year try
ing to provide answers to that
question and others concerning
ecology, the study of man's re
lation to his environment.
The Population and Environ
ment Forum is not simply a
group presenting guest speakers.
It will also sponsor seminars, ex
hibits, and other projects to cre
ate a greater understanding of
environmental problems. The
Forum is a student organization
that grew out of last year's Stan
ford Council on Population and
Environment (SCOPE), an in
formal seminar of students and
faculty members that sought
ways to act upon such issues.
Although SPEF will consider
other problems, the effects of
overpopulation will be given the
greatest emphasis. SPEF Direc
tor Bill Atherton, a senior, com
mented, "You can't consider any
plan for your environment with
out considering population con
trol."
He said there is little prospect
for methods to make the world's

natural resources serve an un
limited population growth.
No Answer
"Technology is not going to be
a panacea," he said. "People who
look to solar power and all these
things don't understand."
He said such methods as devel
oping foods from the sea or solar
power, even if technically possi
ble, would not be economically
feasible for a drastically over
populated world.
Atherton explained that the
group's yearlong program will
be divided into three segments.
The Fall Quarter wi'l be devoted
to "Identification of Problems."
In Winter, specific topics of
population and environment will
be studied in detail. During
Spring Quarter, the material
studied will be organized into a
"Stanford Consensus" on popu
lation problems and plans for
community action.
Other Speakers
This Monday evening, Oct. 14,
the continuing program of guest
speakers will present Dr. Philip
Lee, who will discuss current
environmental programs.
Other speakers during October
will include Congressman Paul
N. McCloskey Jr. and Kenneth
R. Hansen, consulting economist
for the U.S. Bureau of the Budg
et.
This quarter SPEF will also
begin organizing student semi
nars which will study specific
environmental problems, such as
the effects of air pollution or the
use of pesticides, during the
Winter Quarter.
Guests-in-residence from busi
ness, science, and industry will
be invited to spend a day or two
with a seminar group and also
give a short talk at Tresidder
followed by a question and an
swer period.
Seminars collecting back
ground information have already
begun at the Adelphi Interna
tional House of Lagunita. By the
end of Winter Quarter, all of the
seminars will prepare a position
paper on the problems they have
studied. These will be used by a
special Student Congress to
write what Atherton called "an

Environmental Bill of Rights,
outlining what we would like to
work for in our environment."
Films Scheduled
SPEF also plans to show films
on ecological problems and to
set up a speaker bureau to serve
groups in this area. A data li
brary for environmental infor
mation will soon be available in
the Browsing Room of Tresidder
Union.
In the spring, the Forum hopes
to invite experts in and out of
the academic community to
Stanford for a state conference
to discuss the philosophy of pop
ulation control and specific pro
posals for action.
Students will also investigate
the possibilities of establishing
a training program for para
medical personnel to work on
population control with such
agencies as VISTA, the Peace
Corps, Family Planning, or for
rural medical doctors.
SPEF will work during the
year to have a course in ecology
organized that will fulfill the
science requirements of the Gen
eral Studies Program. Atherton
admitted, however, that chances
"are slim right now" for such a
plan because Stanford, as most
universities, does not have a de
partment of ecology.
He said such a course would
have to be taught by a team of
teachers from many areas of the
social and natural sciences and
the humanities to convey the
many factors involved in envir
onmental problems.
Publicity Stunt
SPEF also plans exhibits to
create interest in the program.
Searching for a publicity stunt
to dramatize an exhibit on "Birth
Control Through the Ages" on
display this week in White Pla
za, SPEF members considered
giving Stanford girls intrauter
ine contraceptive devices to be
worn as earrings.
Atehrton explained, however,
that the prescription devices
could not be obtained for such
unusual purposes, but that he
was planning to twist pipe clean
ers or wire into the shape of
the intrauterine contraceptives
and to give those out.
