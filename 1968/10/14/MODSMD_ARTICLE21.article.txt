# Simpson Salvages 27-24 Squeaker
## Indians Nearly Tomahawk Trojans 
### GARY CAVALLI 
Stanford has a great football
team.
This became apparent Satur
day afternoon at Stanford Sta
dium, when the second-ranked
USC Trojans overcame a bril

liant Stanford effort to pull out
a 27-24 win.
81,000 fans jammed into the
spacious Indian wigwam, and
they weren't disappointed. What
they saw was 60 minutes of out
standing, aggressive, hard-hit
ting football. It may have been
the best game ever played in
Stanford Stadium.
The difference, of course, was
Trojan halfback O. J. Simpson.
Simpson, who never seems to
tire, carried the ball 47 times for
220 yards and three touchdowns.
Two of the touchdowns and 162
of the yards came in the second
half, when USC battled back
from a 17-10 deficit to win.
The Tribe completely out
played USC in the first half, but
all they got out of it was a 10-
10 deadlock at intermission.
Muffed Opportunities
The Indians drove deep into
Trojan territory three times in
the first quarter, but couldn't
put the ball over for a score. On
all three occasions kicker Steve

Horowitz missed field goal at
tempts. Horowitz's kicks were
long enough, but each one sailed
wide to the right.
Trojan booter Ron Ayala suc
ceeded where Horowitz failed,
however, splitting the uprights
from 32 yards out to give Troy
a 3-0 lead.
Bubba Brown put Stanford on
top for the first time 40 seconds
after Ayala's three-pointer with
a scintillating 51-yard romp to
paydirt.
Brown Bust Loose
Brown took a pitchout from
Jim Plunkett, scooted through a
hole over left tackle, got a nice
block from Jack Lasater, then
cut to his left and outraced the
Trojan secondary to the goal
line.
The first of two crucial broken
plays that set up USC tallies fol
lowed minutes later.
On second-and-10 from the
Stanford 12, Trojan quarterback
Steve Sogge, falling down under
pressure from Indian lineman,
hit tight end Bob Miller on the

four yard line. Simpson took It
in from there on two tries, scor
ing on an amazing dive over the
Tribe defense.
With 40 seconds to go in the
half, Horowitz booted a 38-yard
field goal to send the teams into
the dressing room at halftime
tied 10-all.
90-Yard March
Plunkett went right to work
in the third quarter, engineer
ing an 11-play, 90 yard drive to
a touchdown. The last 53 yards
came on three passes to split
end Lasater, who got the TD on
a 27-yard bullet from Plunkett.
Stanford got the ball again
when Simpson fumbled at mid
field but the Indians gave it
right back when Plunkett's pass
to tight end Bob Moore was in
tercepted by Trojan linebacker
Billy Shaw.
Simpson quickly atoned for
his fumble by taking a pitchout
from Sogge and scampering 46
yards for his second touchdown.
Ayala's extra-point made it. 17-
apiece.

The Indians generated another
drive after Jim Kauffman re
turned the USC kickoff to the
37.
Six-Point Keeper
The march consumed eight
plays, with Plunkett getting the
final 10 on a beautifully executed
bootleg play around the right
side. Horowitz's third straight
conversion gave Stanford a 24-
17 lead with five minutes left in
the third quarter. It was the
last point Stanford was to score.
The Trojans knotted it up
again at 24-all by going 70 yards
in five plays for the six-pointer.
Simpson carried on four of the
five plays, but the fifth one was
the one that counted.
Sogge hooked up with speed
ster Jim Lawrence, who was a
thorn in Stanford's side all af
ternoon, on a 52-yard completion
to the Tribe four. Simpson
banged in for the TD from there,
breaking a tackle in the back
field and dragging three men in
with him.
The USC defense held the In
dians deep in their own terri
tory, so Simpson and company
went back to work from mid
field.
Broken Play Decisive
Simpson carried for 19 on first
down, but the Tribe defense stif
fened, leading to a fourth and
one situation on the 22. At this
point the second crucial broken
play put the Trojans into posi
tion for the winning field goal.
Sogge pitched out to Simpson,
who started around the right
side, reversed his field, and was
chased back to the right again
before spotting teammate Dan
Scott standing alone on the 10
yard line. Simpson fired the ball
to fullback Scott, who made it
to the eight before being hauled
down.
The Indian defense, led by
George Buehler and Bob Bittner,
held the Trojans, but Ayala
kicked his second field goal from
34 yards out to provide the win
ning margin.
Stanford came back gamely in
the closing minutes, but the
drive bogged down at the Trojan
41. On fourth-and-11 from that
point Plunkett nailed Gene
Washington on an out pattern
at the 32, but it wasn't enough
for the first down.
The Indians almost forced the
Trojans to punt with a minute
remaining, but Simpson got a
first down by the nose of the
football at the 37 and the last
precious seconds ticked away.
