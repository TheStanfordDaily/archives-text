# The 						Inside Track
## It's All In The Game 
### Gary Cavalli 
Shoulders sagged, heads drooped, and soiled fingers rubbed tears
from tired, red eyes. The scene was the Stanford dressing room
after a heart-breaking 27-24 loss to UC.
Around the corner an "extremely disappointed" John Ralston sat
and talked with reporters. Though emotionally drained by the,
agonizing loss, Ralyton managed a weak smile and praised his
team's brilliant performance.
"I was extremely proud of the team," Ralston said softly. "They
gave 100 per cent all afternoon, and you can't ask for more than
that. I feel badly about the loss, but we lost to a better team." «•
The Tribe mentor indicated he was especially pleased with the *
team's ability to run inside against USC, the performance of quar
terback Jim Plunkett, and the overall defensive effort.
"At first we thought we wouldn't be able to run inside against
them," Ralston observed, "but our running game did surprisingly";
well. Plunkett was excellent, he did a real fine job."
"We got a real good defensive effort," Ralston continued. "I was""
very pleased with Jim Kauffman, in his first start, and Dennis
Moore played very well."
Players Mirror Disappointment
The players themselves felt, and looked, tremendously disap- ,J
pointed.
"This is the biggest disappointment I've ever had in my life,""*;
said tight end Bob Moore, expressing the team's general feeling. " v
"The bad thing about a game like this is that you remember every
thing you did wrong, every little mistake."
"We played a great game," sophomore linebacker Moore asserted,
"but I guess it just wasn't in the cards."
Despite the letdown, both the players and Coach Ralston feel
the team will be able to bounce back next week.
"This should be a real unifying factor for us," claimed split re
ceiver Jack Lasater. "It'll give us a lot of confidence."
"We'll be able to pick up," linebacker Moore affirmed. "This is a
real tough conference, and it'll be tough for USC to go undefeated.
We're still in it."
Tight end Moore agreed: "They had some lucky breaks today —"""
like those broken plays. In a conference as tough as ours you'd have
to say there's a chance they'll get knocked off. It may be a bad way
to look at it, but after losing to USC, it's the best way. We have a
lot of confidence in ourselves. Before next Saturday we'll be ready
to play."
Another World
On the other side of Encina Gym, in the visitor's dressing room,
the atmosphere was completely different.
Towels slapped, conversation bubbled, bars of soap sailed through
the air, and a deep voice hummed a popular tune.
Off to one side a naked O.J. Simpson was surrounded by a ring
of reporters. The man Coach Ralston says "may be the best football
player every to put on the gear" admitted having trouble with the
Stanford defense.
"They were the surest tacklers I've ever faced. They certainly
have a great team," O.J. acknowledged.
The strength, the stamina, and the incredible modesty of this
man can only be appreciated by seeing him after the game, and
noticing the absence of bruises on his lithe body, the absolute
indifference he has toward his own remarkable achievements ("Did
I really carry the ball 47 times?"), and his quickness to point out
the influence of luck in the game.
When asked about his pass to Dan Scott, probably the most im
portant play of the game, O.J. grinned and said, "That was sup
posed to be a 27 power sweep. I saw I couldn't go anywhere and
reversed my field. When I realized I couldn't get around the de
fenders I cut back again, and then I saw Danny all by himself on the
10. I threw it to him and hoped there wasn't an illegal man down
field."
Trojan coach John McKay was lavish in his praise of Stanford.
"Offensively Stanford had it over our other opponents, but Miami
may have been stronger defensively," McKay remarked. "Plunkett
did a magnificent job, and so did Gene Washington."
All in all, O.J. Simpson summed it up the best when he said,
"That was the scariest game I've ever been in."
