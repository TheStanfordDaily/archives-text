# FDR's Advisor
## Hoover Gets Moley Papers 
### BRIAN McCAFFREY 
The Hoover Institution has
formally received the papers of
Raymond Moley, well known
journalist and former advisor to
President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
At a press conference on Tues
day Dr. Moley stated that he
chose Stanford's Hoover Insti
tution over Eastern competitors
because it is the "best organized
center for research on papers
and records in this country and
probably abroad."

Dr. Glenn Campbell, director
of the Institution, said that "The
Moley collection greatly en
hances the Hoover Institution's
importance as a center for ad
vanced study of 20th century
history." The Moley papers are
the only source for some de
tailed information on the early
years of the Roosevelt adminis
tration.
Although the entire collection
of Moley's papers, which com
prises some 100 file drawers, has

not yet arrived, the collection
will be complete soon. The In
stitution will require several
months to completely organize
the papers. After this is done
they will be open for research.
Dr. Moley has recently retired
from Newsweek magazine after
thirty years as a contributing
editor and columnist. Prior to
his association with Newsweek
taught in both high school and
college. He also edited Today

magazine and is the author of
nearly twenty books.
Moley terminated his relation
ship with President Roosevelt
in 1936 when according to Mo
ley ; Roosevelt had become a
"demagogue." Moley said that
F.D.R. was trying to weld the
Democratic Party together with
a pro-labor anti-business stand.
Moley subsequently joined the
Republican Party in which he is
still an active member.
Commenting on the current
political scene, Moley said that
he is a close friend and strong
supporter of Richard Nixon. He
said that Spiro Agnew, being
from a border state and having
a record for law and order and
experience with suburban prob
lems was an ideal choice for a
running mate.
Regarding the Wallace candi
dacy, Moley predicted that with
Agnew the Republicans would
regain some of the southern
states. He also emphasized that
those who are supporting Wal
lace are playing right into
Humphrey's hands. Moley feels
that if the election goes to the
House, Humphrey will be
chosen.

a record for law and order and
experience with suburban prob
lems was an ideal choice for a
running mate.
Regarding the Wallace candi
dacy, Moley predicted that with
Agnew the Republicans would
regain some of the southern
states. He also emphasized that
those who are supporting Wal
lace are playing right into
Humphrey's hands. Moley feels
that if the election goes to the
House, Humphrey will be
chosen.
The Hoover Institution has
formally received the papers of
Raymond Moley, well known
journalist and former advisor to
President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
At a press conference on Tues
day Dr. Moley stated that he
chose Stanford's Hoover Insti
tution over Eastern competitors
because it is the "best organized
center for research on papers
and records in this country and
probably abroad."

Dr. Glenn Campbell, director
of the Institution, said that "The
Moley collection greatly en
hances the Hoover Institution's
importance as a center for ad
vanced study of 20th century
history." The Moley papers are
the only source for some de
tailed information on the early
years of the Roosevelt adminis
tration.
Although the entire collection
of Moley's papers, which com
prises some 100 file drawers, has

not yet arrived, the collection
will be complete soon. The In
stitution will require several
months to completely organize
the papers. After this is done
they will be open for research.
Dr. Moley has recently retired
from Newsweek magazine after
thirty years as a contributing
editor and columnist. Prior to
his association with Newsweek
taught in both high school and
college. He also edited Today

magazine and is the author of
nearly twenty books.
Moley terminated his relation
ship with President Roosevelt
in 1936 when according to Mo
ley ; Roosevelt had become a
"demagogue." Moley said that
F.D.R. was trying to weld the
Democratic Party together with
a pro-labor anti-business stand.
Moley subsequently joined the
Republican Party in which he is
still an active member.
Commenting on the current
political scene, Moley said that
he is a close friend and strong
supporter of Richard Nixon. He
said that Spiro Agnew, being
from a border state and having
a record for law and order and
experience with suburban prob
lems was an ideal choice for a
running mate.
