# Let Black Community Alone, Declares Politician Francois
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
Black people are tired of whites
dictating what is best for them
whether the whites be radical or
moderate, said black politician
Terry Francois, in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium Friday night.
"I resent white middle class
people telling us to reject some
of our leaders. I resent them
dividing our community", he ex
plained to a small audience.
Francois criticized white radi
cals meddling in black politics
as well as many whites planning
not to vote in November because
of unacceptable candidates.
The San Francisco supervisor
condemned white radicals who
call for "total rejection of all
black leadership that have any
kind of acceptance in the white
community."
In specific, he criticized "white
people in the Peace and Freedom
party telling Kathleen Cleaver
(Eldridge's wife) to run against

Willie Brown." Brown is an in
cumbent state Assemblyman in
San Francisco up for re-election.
"White people can do a bigger
job in the white community than
messing around in our commu
nity. There is so much bigotry
in the suburbs."
Francois, who declares himself
"a realist, a politician," also had
few kind words for "whites sit
ting back and not voting. The
middle class won't feel the dif
ference between Humphrey or
Nixon. The poor will. Food
stamps, medical care mean a
great deal.
"For those of you with any
compassion, you can't say that
the next four years don't mat
ter."
Francois, a supporter of Hum
phrey, said that he had little
hope for poverty programs if
Nixon is elected. "Humphrey be
lieves in these programs."
Asked about McCarthy he said,

"I won't support him. He would
have to show me a lot. I don't
believe Robert Kennedy or Eu
gene McCarthy would have got
ten us out of Vietnam more
quickly than Hubert Humphrey.
Efforts of white McCarthy sup
porters to get blacks to support
their man was a further example
who's best for them. The next
four years are important, and
I'm going to support Hubert
Humphrey."
