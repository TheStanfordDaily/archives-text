# McCarthy Insists Fight To Continue
## 
### 
Sen. Eugene McCarthy showed
yesterday that his ideals and po
litical beliefs did not die with
his defeat at Chicago.
When the former contender
for the Democratic presidential
nomination spoke in the Old Pa
villion, the repeated ovations of
the rain-soaked but enthusiastic
crowd of 4,000 proved the sena
tor's own words: that the drive
for a change in the content and
procedure of the American po
litical process is still vibrant and
"won't disappear after Novem
ber."
At the invitation of the Stan
ford Committee for a New Dem
ocratic Politics, McCarthy came
to endorse Alan Cranston's and
Don Edwards' campaigns for the
U.S. Senate and U.S. House of
Representatives respectively.
At the same time, he put in
a plea for a change in the po
litical system so that the electo
rate can make its judgements a
part of the policy of the U.S.
"I hope we can make the two
party system work," McCarthy
said. "It didn't work this year.
It didn't work in 1964."
Green Stamp Plan
Certain practices are in opera
tion in the electoral system, he
said, which meant this year that
nearly 50 percent of the popula-

tion felt they "hadn't had the op
portunity to make their judge
ment heard."
One of these practices was
seniority, something McCarthy
termed "a kind of Green Stamp
Plan." In operation in Chicago
it resulted in Humphrey's nomi
nation. Another practice was the
unit rule of voting which, he
said, was provided for in the
constitution, would not have
been accepted in the past, and
should not be accepted now.
McCarthy said that what his
supporters advocate "is not a
new politics, but a politics which
is as old as the country."
"I didn't try to take over the
Democratic Party. I didn't really
see where it was. I thought it
might have made it through Chi
cago to be the responsible party
of the U.S."
Lack of Response
McCarthy said that had true
representation been in effect at
the convention at Chicago, "no
matter who the candidate was,
he would have run on our plat
form. What the people clearly
indicated was what they wanted
the issues to be. They continue
to indicate what they want by
their lack of response after the
convention."


MCCARTHY RETURNS â€” Senator Eugene McCarthy greets the
estimated 4000 in the Old Pavilion with an upraised peacc sign yes
terday. He lent his support to Cong. Don Edwards and Senate can
didate Alan Cranston.
Prof. Hubert Marshall, who
chaired C-15 last spring, con
tends that the proposal would
mend serious deficiencies of the
current system.
While he recommends passage
of the proposal, Von Schlegell
suggests that there are issues
"inherent in the C-15 recommen
dation which stand to be criti
zed" and which C-15 needs to
consider before the proposal
would run out this spring.
