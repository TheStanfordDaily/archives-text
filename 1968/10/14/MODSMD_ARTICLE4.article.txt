# Student Charters Face Vote
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
Voting begins today and con
tinues tomorrow on three prop
ositions dealing with two pro
posed ASSU constitutions, stu
dent judicial reform, and the
current boycott of California
table grapes.
Elections Commissioner Bill
Debs announced Friday that
polling places will be open on
White Memorial Plaza, in front
of the Physics Tank, and at En
gineering Corner from 9:30 a.m.
to 4:00 p.m. each day.
The majority of student inter
est in this special election ap
pears to center around the two
different proposals for student
government.
The proposed new ASSU con
stitution, which draws from pro
posals of last Spring's Constitu
tional Convention and the Sum
mer Legislature under the lead
ership of ASSU President Denis
Hayes, proposes streamlining the
present organization and stu
dent control in assessing fees.
The second constitution, pro
posed by the Committee for Stu
dent Responsibility (CSR), calls
for a voluntary student union
which would enter into contract

ual agreements with the faculty
and administration.
Confusion
Confusion over the relation
ship between the two proposals
is such that a student may vote
for both proposals, vote against
both, or split his vote between
the two.
A two-thirds vote is required
to adopt either or both of the
proposed constitutions and the
proposed new ASSU By-Law,
which establishes the Hare sys
tem of proportional representa
tion.
The third resolution proposes
that "the students of Stanford
University support the boycott
of California table grapes and
the struggle of the United Farm
Workers for better working and
living eonditions."
Pro|M>nents Contend
Proponents of the two consti
tutions bitterly contended for
stud nt support of their pro
posals in informational sheets
handed out over the week-end.
The CSR proposal calls for a
"voluntary union of Stanford
students . . . incorporated under
the laws of the State of 'Cali
fornia." Critics contend that such
a change involves a lengthy proc
ess, with a "one year wait not
being unusual."
Richard Carp, co-chairman of
CSR, contends that such a
change was proposed to "allow
stud nts to make agreements
with the University which are
legally binding on both. Only
by incorporating can the stu
dents protect themselves against
whimsy, breach of faith, and
lapses of memory."
21-Member Senate
The new ASSU constitution
calls for a 21-member Senate,
replacing thr> present 150-mem
ber Legislature.
Undergraduate students would
elect ten members at large, and
graduate students would elect
ten members from their various
d partments. The ASSU Presi
dent would serve as an ex
ofllcio member with a vote, while
the Vice-President would be the
presiding officer of the Senate.
CSR favors retention of the
present system of residence se
lection of representatives, but
proposes that a 30-momber Sen
at be selected to carry on the
week-10-week business.
The Hayes constitution would
have the Senate establish a base
fop "essential (to)'operating the
'rsociation Office, the President

of the Association, the Senate,
and such rule-making judicial
bodies as the Association shall
establish."
Assessments
Special assessments, required
beyond this base fee, would be
levied by a majority vote of
the student body and could b?
used by associations of gradu
ate and undergraduate depart
ments.
The Financial Manager would
be appointed by a committee of
students, as opposed to the pres
ent practice of appointment by
the Dean of Students.
CSR insists that such a move
would not lead to financial auto
nomy and contends that only a
student union offers financial,
as well as legal, autonomy.
Proponents of th 1 Hayes con
stitution also point out that re
quirement for hiring a "legal
counsel to represent the Associ
ation in legal matters" could lead
to a situation where the "whole
bloody year's budget would be
wiped out in on: 1 fell swoop."
Disenfranchised
CSR insists that freshmen
would "be effectively disenfran
chised, as it is practically impos
sible for them to elect th *ir rep
resentatives to a 21 man bodv."
The Committee of 15's pro
posal for enactment and enforce
ment of studont disciplinary
regulations was accepted by the
Academic Council in its final
spring quarter meeting.
Although the plan has im
proved in principle by the
LASSU last spring, the approval
of the student body is necessary
before it can go into effect. Ap
proval of th> referendum, how
ever, extends the plan until
March 1, 19(59.
'Substantial'
ASSU Vice-President Vic Von
Schlegell suggests that objec
tions to the proposal are "sub
stantial enough to call for seri
ous reconsideration."
Jim Schni"der, a supporter,
agrees and says that approval
might well cause students "to
lose anv bargaining power that
we may have to gain a more
equitable position."
For now, he said, "we must
do the best we can with Ed
ward's campaign, and do the
best we can with the rest of this
presidential campaign."
In the long run, however, Mc-
Carthy felt that the objectives
must continue to be "a change
in the substance of the Ameri
can political process and a
change in the procedure of the
process itself."
He declared that he and his
supporters must be prepared to
"commit ourselves for however
long it may take."
"We Want Gene"
By any estimation, McCarthy
was very warmly received. If the
crowd which greeted him when
he spoke at Stanford almost a
year ago was enthusiastic, the
audience yesterday was exuber
ant.
When the senator entered the
pavillion, accompanied by Cran
ston and Edwards, Jack Diamond
and the Karats, a pop group
engaged to entertain before and
after the speeches, struck up

McCarthy's campaign song,
"When the Saints Go Marching
In." The audience immediately
gave the senator a standing ova
tion, and began to chant, 'We
Want Gene! We Want Gene!"
Although McCarthy was ob
viously the prime attraction, the
actual purpose of yesterday's
gathering was to enlist support
for Cranston and Edwards. Even
the candidates, however, concen
trated on the senator from Min
nesota.
Edward, speaking before Mc-
Carthy, discussed the political
activism of the present young
generation, and remarked that
in spite of the temporary set
backs of Chicago, "we the coun
try, we the peop'e, and we the
world still have Eugene McCar
thy."
Cranston, in expounding his
senatorial plank, vowed an ac
tive part in "the fight for more
responsible and responsive poli
tics led by Sen. McCarthy."
"Whatever happens this year,
it will go down in history as
Eugene McCarthy's year."
Voting begins today and con

The Committee of 15's pro

LASSU last spring, the approval
of the student body is necessary

'Substantial'
ASSU Vice-President Vic Von
Schlegell suggests that objec
tions to the proposal are "sub
stantial enough to call for seri
ous reconsideration."
Jim Schni"der, a supporter,
agrees and says that approval
might well cause students "to
lose anv bargaining power that
we may have to gain a more
equitable position."
For now, he said, "we must
do the best we can with Ed
ward's campaign, and do the
best we can with the rest of this
presidential campaign."
In the long run, however, Mc-
Carthy felt that the objectives
must continue to be "a change
in the substance of the Ameri
can political process and a
change in the procedure of the
process itself."
He declared that he and his
supporters must be prepared to
"commit ourselves for however
long it may take."
"We Want Gene"
By any estimation, McCarthy
was very warmly received. If the
crowd which greeted him when
he spoke at Stanford almost a
year ago was enthusiastic, the
audience yesterday was exuber
ant.
When the senator entered the
pavillion, accompanied by Cran
ston and Edwards, Jack Diamond
and the Karats, a pop group
engaged to entertain before and
after the speeches, struck up

McCarthy's campaign song,
"When the Saints Go Marching
In." The audience immediately
gave the senator a standing ova
tion, and began to chant, 'We
Want Gene! We Want Gene!"
Although McCarthy was ob
viously the prime attraction, the
actual purpose of yesterday's
gathering was to enlist support
for Cranston and Edwards. Even
the candidates, however, concen
trated on the senator from Min
nesota.
Edward, speaking before Mc-
Carthy, discussed the political
activism of the present young
generation, and remarked that
in spite of the temporary set
backs of Chicago, "we the coun
try, we the peop'e, and we the
world still have Eugene McCar
thy."
Cranston, in expounding his
senatorial plank, vowed an ac
tive part in "the fight for more
responsible and responsive poli
tics led by Sen. McCarthy."
"Whatever happens this year,
it will go down in history as
Eugene McCarthy's year."
Voting begins today and con
tinues tomorrow on three prop
ositions dealing with two pro
posed ASSU constitutions, stu
dent judicial reform, and the
current boycott of California
table grapes.
Elections Commissioner Bill
Debs announced Friday that
polling places will be open on
White Memorial Plaza, in front
of the Physics Tank, and at En
gineering Corner from 9:30 a.m.
to 4:00 p.m. each day.
The majority of student inter
est in this special election ap
pears to center around the two
different proposals for student
government.
The proposed new ASSU con
stitution, which draws from pro
posals of last Spring's Constitu
tional Convention and the Sum
mer Legislature under the lead
ership of ASSU President Denis
Hayes, proposes streamlining the
present organization and stu
dent control in assessing fees.
The second constitution, pro
posed by the Committee for Stu
dent Responsibility (CSR), calls
for a voluntary student union
which would enter into contract

ual agreements with the faculty
and administration.
Confusion
Confusion over the relation
ship between the two proposals
is such that a student may vote
for both proposals, vote against
both, or split his vote between
the two.
A two-thirds vote is required
to adopt either or both of the
proposed constitutions and the
proposed new ASSU By-Law,
which establishes the Hare sys
tem of proportional representa
tion.
The third resolution proposes
that "the students of Stanford
University support the boycott
of California table grapes and
the struggle of the United Farm
Workers for better working and
living eonditions."
Pro|M>nents Contend
Proponents of the two consti
tutions bitterly contended for
stud nt support of their pro
posals in informational sheets
handed out over the week-end.
The CSR proposal calls for a
"voluntary union of Stanford
students . . . incorporated under
the laws of the State of 'Cali
fornia." Critics contend that such
a change involves a lengthy proc
ess, with a "one year wait not
being unusual."
Richard Carp, co-chairman of
CSR, contends that such a
change was proposed to "allow
stud nts to make agreements
with the University which are
legally binding on both. Only
by incorporating can the stu
dents protect themselves against
whimsy, breach of faith, and
lapses of memory."
21-Member Senate
The new ASSU constitution
calls for a 21-member Senate,
replacing thr> present 150-mem

Undergraduate students would
elect ten members at large, and
graduate students would elect
ten members from their various
d partments. The ASSU Presi
dent would serve as an ex
ofllcio member with a vote, while
the Vice-President would be the
presiding officer of the Senate.
CSR favors retention of the
present system of residence se
lection of representatives, but
proposes that a 30-momber Sen
at be selected to carry on the
week-10-week business.
The Hayes constitution would
have the Senate establish a base
fop "essential (to)'operating the
'rsociation Office, the President

of the Association, the Senate,
and such rule-making judicial
bodies as the Association shall
establish."
Assessments
Special assessments, required
beyond this base fee, would be
levied by a majority vote of
the student body and could b?
used by associations of gradu
ate and undergraduate depart
ments.
The Financial Manager would
be appointed by a committee of
students, as opposed to the pres
ent practice of appointment by
the Dean of Students.
CSR insists that such a move
would not lead to financial auto
nomy and contends that only a
student union offers financial,
as well as legal, autonomy.

White Memorial Plaza, in front
of the Physics Tank, and at En
gineering Corner from 9:30 a.m.
to 4:00 p.m. each day.
The majority of student inter
est in this special election ap
pears to center around the two
different proposals for student
government.
The proposed new ASSU con
stitution, which draws from pro
posals of last Spring's Constitu
tional Convention and the Sum
mer Legislature under the lead
ership of ASSU President Denis
Hayes, proposes streamlining the
present organization and stu
dent control in assessing fees.
The second constitution, pro
posed by the Committee for Stu
dent Responsibility (CSR), calls
for a voluntary student union
which would enter into contract

ual agreements with the faculty
and administration.
Confusion
Confusion over the relation
ship between the two proposals
is such that a student may vote
for both proposals, vote against
both, or split his vote between
the two.
A two-thirds vote is required
to adopt either or both of the
proposed constitutions and the
proposed new ASSU By-Law,
which establishes the Hare sys
tem of proportional representa
tion.
The third resolution proposes
that "the students of Stanford
University support the boycott
of California table grapes and
the struggle of the United Farm
Workers for better working and
living eonditions."
Pro|M>nents Contend
Proponents of the two consti
tutions bitterly contended for
stud nt support of their pro
posals in informational sheets
handed out over the week-end.
The CSR proposal calls for a
"voluntary union of Stanford
students . . . incorporated under
the laws of the State of 'Cali
fornia." Critics contend that such
a change involves a lengthy proc
ess, with a "one year wait not
being unusual."
Richard Carp, co-chairman of
CSR, contends that such a
change was proposed to "allow
stud nts to make agreements
with the University which are
legally binding on both. Only
by incorporating can the stu
dents protect themselves against
whimsy, breach of faith, and
lapses of memory."
21-Member Senate
The new ASSU constitution
calls for a 21-member Senate,
replacing thr> present 150-mem
ber Legislature.
Undergraduate students would
elect ten members at large, and
graduate students would elect
ten members from their various
d partments. The ASSU Presi
dent would serve as an ex
ofllcio member with a vote, while
the Vice-President would be the
presiding officer of the Senate.
CSR favors retention of the
present system of residence se
lection of representatives, but
proposes that a 30-momber Sen
at be selected to carry on the
week-10-week business.
The Hayes constitution would
have the Senate establish a base
fop "essential (to)'operating the
'rsociation Office, the President

of the Association, the Senate,
and such rule-making judicial
bodies as the Association shall
establish."
Assessments
Special assessments, required
beyond this base fee, would be
levied by a majority vote of
the student body and could b?
used by associations of gradu
ate and undergraduate depart
ments.
The Financial Manager would
be appointed by a committee of
students, as opposed to the pres
ent practice of appointment by
the Dean of Students.
CSR insists that such a move
would not lead to financial auto
nomy and contends that only a
student union offers financial,
as well as legal, autonomy.
Proponents of th 1 Hayes con
stitution also point out that re
quirement for hiring a "legal
counsel to represent the Associ
ation in legal matters" could lead
to a situation where the "whole
bloody year's budget would be
wiped out in on: 1 fell swoop."
Disenfranchised
CSR insists that freshmen
would "be effectively disenfran
chised, as it is practically impos
sible for them to elect th *ir rep
resentatives to a 21 man bodv."
The Committee of 15's pro
posal for enactment and enforce
ment of studont disciplinary
regulations was accepted by the
Academic Council in its final
spring quarter meeting.
Although the plan has im
proved in principle by the
LASSU last spring, the approval
of the student body is necessary
before it can go into effect. Ap
proval of th> referendum, how
ever, extends the plan until
March 1, 19(59.
'Substantial'
ASSU Vice-President Vic Von
Schlegell suggests that objec
tions to the proposal are "sub
stantial enough to call for seri
ous reconsideration."
Jim Schni"der, a supporter,
agrees and says that approval
might well cause students "to
lose anv bargaining power that
we may have to gain a more
equitable position."
For now, he said, "we must
do the best we can with Ed
ward's campaign, and do the
best we can with the rest of this
presidential campaign."
In the long run, however, Mc-
Carthy felt that the objectives
must continue to be "a change
in the substance of the Ameri
can political process and a
change in the procedure of the
process itself."
He declared that he and his
supporters must be prepared to
"commit ourselves for however
long it may take."
"We Want Gene"
By any estimation, McCarthy
was very warmly received. If the
crowd which greeted him when
he spoke at Stanford almost a
year ago was enthusiastic, the
audience yesterday was exuber
ant.
When the senator entered the
pavillion, accompanied by Cran
ston and Edwards, Jack Diamond
and the Karats, a pop group
engaged to entertain before and
after the speeches, struck up

McCarthy's campaign song,
"When the Saints Go Marching
In." The audience immediately
gave the senator a standing ova
tion, and began to chant, 'We
Want Gene! We Want Gene!"
Although McCarthy was ob
viously the prime attraction, the
actual purpose of yesterday's
gathering was to enlist support
for Cranston and Edwards. Even
the candidates, however, concen
trated on the senator from Min
nesota.
Edward, speaking before Mc-
Carthy, discussed the political
activism of the present young
generation, and remarked that
in spite of the temporary set
backs of Chicago, "we the coun
try, we the peop'e, and we the
world still have Eugene McCar
thy."
Cranston, in expounding his
senatorial plank, vowed an ac
tive part in "the fight for more
responsible and responsive poli
tics led by Sen. McCarthy."
"Whatever happens this year,
it will go down in history as
Eugene McCarthy's year."
Voting begins today and con
tinues tomorrow on three prop
ositions dealing with two pro
posed ASSU constitutions, stu
dent judicial reform, and the
current boycott of California
table grapes.

counsel to represent the Associ
ation in legal matters" could lead
to a situation where the "whole
bloody year's budget would be
wiped out in on: 1 fell swoop."
Disenfranchised
CSR insists that freshmen
would "be effectively disenfran
chised, as it is practically impos
sible for them to elect th *ir rep
resentatives to a 21 man bodv."
The Committee of 15's pro
posal for enactment and enforce
ment of studont disciplinary
regulations was accepted by the
Academic Council in its final
spring quarter meeting.
Although the plan has im
proved in principle by the
LASSU last spring, the approval
of the student body is necessary
before it can go into effect. Ap
proval of th> referendum, how
ever, extends the plan until
March 1, 19(59.
'Substantial'
ASSU Vice-President Vic Von
Schlegell suggests that objec
tions to the proposal are "sub
stantial enough to call for seri
ous reconsideration."
Jim Schni"der, a supporter,
agrees and says that approval
might well cause students "to
lose anv bargaining power that
we may have to gain a more
equitable position."
For now, he said, "we must
do the best we can with Ed
ward's campaign, and do the
best we can with the rest of this
presidential campaign."
In the long run, however, Mc-
Carthy felt that the objectives
must continue to be "a change
in the substance of the Ameri
can political process and a
change in the procedure of the
process itself."
He declared that he and his
supporters must be prepared to
"commit ourselves for however
long it may take."
"We Want Gene"
By any estimation, McCarthy
was very warmly received. If the
crowd which greeted him when
he spoke at Stanford almost a
year ago was enthusiastic, the
audience yesterday was exuber
ant.
When the senator entered the
pavillion, accompanied by Cran
ston and Edwards, Jack Diamond
and the Karats, a pop group
engaged to entertain before and
after the speeches, struck up

McCarthy's campaign song,
"When the Saints Go Marching
In." The audience immediately
gave the senator a standing ova
tion, and began to chant, 'We
Want Gene! We Want Gene!"
Although McCarthy was ob
viously the prime attraction, the
actual purpose of yesterday's
gathering was to enlist support
for Cranston and Edwards. Even
the candidates, however, concen
trated on the senator from Min
nesota.
Edward, speaking before Mc-
Carthy, discussed the political
activism of the present young
generation, and remarked that
in spite of the temporary set
backs of Chicago, "we the coun
try, we the peop'e, and we the
world still have Eugene McCar
thy."
Cranston, in expounding his
senatorial plank, vowed an ac
tive part in "the fight for more
responsible and responsive poli
tics led by Sen. McCarthy."
"Whatever happens this year,
it will go down in history as
Eugene McCarthy's year."
Voting begins today and con
tinues tomorrow on three prop
ositions dealing with two pro
posed ASSU constitutions, stu
dent judicial reform, and the
current boycott of California
table grapes.
Elections Commissioner Bill
Debs announced Friday that
polling places will be open on
White Memorial Plaza, in front
of the Physics Tank, and at En
gineering Corner from 9:30 a.m.
to 4:00 p.m. each day.
The majority of student inter
est in this special election ap
pears to center around the two
different proposals for student
government.
The proposed new ASSU con
stitution, which draws from pro
posals of last Spring's Constitu
tional Convention and the Sum
mer Legislature under the lead
ership of ASSU President Denis
Hayes, proposes streamlining the
present organization and stu
dent control in assessing fees.
The second constitution, pro
posed by the Committee for Stu
dent Responsibility (CSR), calls
for a voluntary student union
which would enter into contract

ual agreements with the faculty
and administration.
Confusion
Confusion over the relation
ship between the two proposals
is such that a student may vote
for both proposals, vote against
both, or split his vote between
the two.
A two-thirds vote is required
to adopt either or both of the
proposed constitutions and the
proposed new ASSU By-Law,
which establishes the Hare sys
tem of proportional representa
tion.
The third resolution proposes
that "the students of Stanford
University support the boycott
of California table grapes and
the struggle of the United Farm
Workers for better working and
living eonditions."
Pro|M>nents Contend
Proponents of the two consti
tutions bitterly contended for
stud nt support of their pro
posals in informational sheets
handed out over the week-end.
The CSR proposal calls for a
"voluntary union of Stanford
students . . . incorporated under
the laws of the State of 'Cali
fornia." Critics contend that such
a change involves a lengthy proc
ess, with a "one year wait not
being unusual."
Richard Carp, co-chairman of
CSR, contends that such a
change was proposed to "allow
stud nts to make agreements
with the University which are
legally binding on both. Only
by incorporating can the stu
dents protect themselves against
whimsy, breach of faith, and
lapses of memory."
21-Member Senate
The new ASSU constitution
calls for a 21-member Senate,
replacing thr> present 150-mem
ber Legislature.
Undergraduate students would
elect ten members at large, and
graduate students would elect
ten members from their various
d partments. The ASSU Presi
dent would serve as an ex
ofllcio member with a vote, while
the Vice-President would be the
presiding officer of the Senate.
CSR favors retention of the
present system of residence se
lection of representatives, but
proposes that a 30-momber Sen
at be selected to carry on the
week-10-week business.
The Hayes constitution would
have the Senate establish a base
fop "essential (to)'operating the
'rsociation Office, the President

of the Association, the Senate,
and such rule-making judicial
bodies as the Association shall
establish."
Assessments
Special assessments, required
beyond this base fee, would be
levied by a majority vote of
the student body and could b?
used by associations of gradu
ate and undergraduate depart
ments.
The Financial Manager would
be appointed by a committee of
students, as opposed to the pres
ent practice of appointment by
the Dean of Students.
CSR insists that such a move
would not lead to financial auto
nomy and contends that only a
student union offers financial,
as well as legal, autonomy.
Proponents of th 1 Hayes con
stitution also point out that re
quirement for hiring a "legal
counsel to represent the Associ
ation in legal matters" could lead
to a situation where the "whole
bloody year's budget would be
wiped out in on: 1 fell swoop."
