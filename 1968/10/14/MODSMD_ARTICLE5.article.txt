# TMU Blackout
## 
### 
Water short circuited the
power but not the students — at
least temporarily — last night
at Tresidder Union as things
went on pretty much as normal
for nearly an hour in spite of
the fact the students sat in al
most total darkness.
According to Fitch of
the fire department the failure
was caused when (he basement
became engulfed in some three
feet of water after the drainage
system failed during a brief
downpour.
Tresidder finally succumbed to
the water anil closed its doors
around 8:30. But the atmosphere
did not seem to ruflle file stu
dents.
The cafeteria was functioning
up until closing in spite of the
fact few could see what they
were eating and intransigent stu
dents read uncaringly in the dim
light of the auxiliary lighting
system in the lounge.
