## Still 'Clean Gene' 
### DIARMUID McGUIRE 
Euegene McCarthy stopped off a Boeing 727 and into the San
Jose airline terminal at about 1:45 yesterday afternoon.
Those who feel that the Senator embodies the crushed hopes of
their generation will be pleased to know that he did not look it.
He appeared (it and self-contained as he moved through the grove
of politicians and campaign staffers that had sprung up to greet
him.
With their neat suits and carefully trimmed hair, the whole
party looked very much at home in the formica and frosted glass
reality of the airport. McCarthy, Congressman Don Edwards, and
their eager, alert tlock of staffers all glowed with the same rear
projected florescence that drew one's eye to the sign over the
United ticket counter.
Not to denigrate them. They are healthy, intelligent, mainstream
people. But where is the mainstream going?
Red Ford
McCarthy climbed into .1 brand new red Ford to go to the Hyatt
House in San Jose, where he was scheduled to spend an hour or
so before coming up to Stanford. The only contrast to the general
glossiness of the car, the politic-os and the airport was provided by
the handful of reporters, who were packed into a chartered bus.
They were generally balding, disheveled and of troubled complexion.
We located a quiet, rnoustached press aide and asked about an
interview. "Well," he said, "there may be a chance up at Stanford
if you can catch him at the right time."
We got the message. This is the big time. kid. No special breaks
for The Stanford Daily. So we waited tor our next chance and
dived in.
Passageway
The ex-candidate was standing in a passageway under the stands
of the basketball pavilion with Edwards and Alan Cranston. Out
side 4000 beautiful, excited kids were generating noise and green
house humility.
We made our move. "Senator," we said, "could you ..."
Hand on the shoulder. The man from The Palo Alto Times want
ed to take some pictures. We stepped back.
Flash, flash. Another try. "Senator, we would like to know..."
"What is that button?" The white knight of political liberalism
was looking at a button on our lapel. He could not make it out. He
put on his glasses and peered at it again.
"It's for Eldridge Cleaver," we said.
Gene McCarthy examined us very carefully. "Oh," he said.
New York
We could not tell him about how we had worked in his messed-up
New York campaign headquarters this summer, or about the feel
ings that Cleaver pin represented. We just spewed out the question
we had been trying to formulate for two days.
"Senator, the kids out there and most of the people who read The
Daily are your people. They are pretty upset by the way things
are going. Do you have any special message for them, any words
that might help them to see their way out of this situation?"
"Well," he said, "I go into that in my speech. We have to work
for candidates like Congressman Edwards, and then start think
ing about restructuring the political system. It will take some
time."
Sensible
We were hammered by the realization that the answer was a hell
of a lot more sensible than our question. But we hung on. "But do
you think that these people can visualize a change that cannot come
for four years?"
"Yes, I think they can."
Finally, reeling, we fell back on the journalist's last straw.
"What are your plans now?"
"I don't have any plans, really. I don't think that what happens
to me is very important in the long run. We shouldn't think too
much in terms of individual personalities in these things."
"But these kids are worried about what happens to you."
"Yes, I suppose they are."
A rock combo outside swung into a soulful "When The Saints
Come Marching In." Gene McCarthy went out and there was a
thunder of hands and voices, and for a little while it was like last
summer.
