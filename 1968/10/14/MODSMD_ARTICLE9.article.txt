## SRI Happy With Arrangement 
### KIM THORBURN MARGIE WOLF 
Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) is "extremely happy with
the present arrangement" be
twen the University and its
subsidiary, according to SRl's
top administrator, Executive
vice-president Weldon Gibson.
Gibson termed the relation
ship "beneficial" to both Stan
ford and SRI during a press con
ference last week with Daily re
porters.
Projects from Bank of Amer
ica's "Irma" computerized book
keeping to urban mass transit
studies to defense contracts earn
Gibson's adjectives "highly di
versified" for the Institute.
But the work "has to be re
search," Gibson said, outlining a
"philosophical" if not a "moral"
guideline.
'Pyramid'
SRI is organized like "an up
side-down pyramid" the execu
tive explained, with the research
ers on top. A researcher decides
whether he wants to work on a
project and his p'an is reviewed
by a department head and exec
utive, if necessary.
The 1836-man research staff is
roughly divided into Economics,
Engineering Sciences, Electron
ics and Radio, Management and
Systems Sciences, Life Sciences,
Physical Sciences and Informa
tion areas. SRI employs a total
of 3200 people, most at its 80-
acre Menlo Park site but with
offices as distant as Washington,
D.C., Geneva, and Tokvo. Its

current budget exceeds $65 mil
lion per year.
Non-Profit
SRI. which Gibson describes as
Stanford's "wholly-owned sub
sidiary." is a non-profit organi
zation. Seventy-five percent of
its projects are financed by the
government at federal, state, or
local levels; 7."5 percent of gov
ernment work is done for the
Defense Department.
Twenty-five rercent of SRl's
research is done for private
companies or individual, with
about one fifth of this in the
of international indus
tries and foreign governments.
Cibson flatly denied investigat
ing the most effective bombing
runs over North Vietnam as "not
our business", but Vice-presi
dent of Planning and Coordina
tion R"dolf Brunsvold said. "As
an institution we don't take a
view on the rightness or wrong
ness of the established govern
ment." Alternately, any research
er may decline to work on a
certain project for any reason,
including morality.
Classified
About a third of SRl's projects
are classified in other words,
classified information is in
volved. Only "a handful", said
Gibson, are so secret that even
their existence cannot be re
vealed.
About half of the Institute's
projects are initiated from with
in. When a researcher prepares
a "thlnk-piece" h<> may find a
sponsor and pursue it.

All projects, regardless of
origin, are submitted to an "ex
tensive screening process", Gib
son explained, to determine feas
ibility and accordance with the
Institute's aims.
Begins At Top
SRl's relationship to Stanford
begins at the top. Stanford Trus
tees are general members of the
corporation and elect the Board
of Directors and its chairman,
presently Ernest Arbuckle, for
mer dean of the graduate school
of business.
The Board of Directors elects
SRl's officers and establishes
basic guidelines for the Insti
tute.
About 50 Stanford faculty
members at any time act as
"consultants" to SRI. Twenty
from the SRI staff are now
teaching at the University. In
stitute workers frequently moni
tor these for students.
No Money Ties
Economically, the university
and SRI are not associated. Stan
ford gave the institute an initial
loan, but it has long since been
paid back. At times SRI makes
grants to the University in
fields of mutual interest.
"In general, the facilities of
the University are not available
to this organization," Gibson
said, but SRI pays for using the
Stanford libraries and occasion
ally pursues joint projects on
the campus.
Begun in 1916, SRI was the
"brainchild" of two Stanford
chemistry professors, Robert

Swain and Philip Leighton, and
of an al mnus and director of
sevTa' corporations, H. Swim.
A study by Dr. Henry Heald
of the Illinois Institute of Tech
nology revealed a research in
stitute on the west coast would
be invaluable in the wake of de
veloping industry.
Atholl a San Fran
cisco industrialist, was the fa
ther of the project, a former
Stanford Vice-president Alvin
Enrich its architect. Eurich was
largely responsible for SRl's af
filiation with the University.
Most of the original research
ers were recruited from the Fed
era' government, and some Stan
ford faculty members served as
consultants. The first work was
competed in the Physics Cor
ner of the Quad, but SRI soon
outgrew its first home.
University Policy
With regards to its property,
Gibson stated, the Institute fol
lows "basically the same policy"
for protection as does the Uni
versity, but does have a "certain
external obligation," particular
ly to its clients.
Gibson emphasized "SRI, aside
from the single items of security
and obligations to our clients, is
a glass bowl."
Regarding future activities,
Brunsvold said, "the thrust we
would hope to see is a solution
of the real problems confronting
society."
(Tomorrow The Daily will
continue reviewing SRI with a
summary of its economic devel
opment programs.)
