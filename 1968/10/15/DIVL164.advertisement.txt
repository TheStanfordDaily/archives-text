Some people won't make
a move without it.
The KLH Model Eleven.
One of our good customers, faced with the choice of tak
ing his wife or KLH Model Eleven to Port Said—took his wife.
Of course.
We don't make silly claims about the Eleven.
But we'll bet you see more KLH Model Elevens going places
with people who go places than any other stereo portable on
the market.
The reason is simple. The Eleven is a portable that's really
portable. Just 28 pounds of solid musical performance.
It's got KLH quality throughout. There are specially de
signed KLH full range speakers; a distortion-free solid state
amplifier; an automatic turntable custom-built for KLH by
Garrard; magnetic cartridge and diamond stylus; inputs for
tuner and tape recorder, and many other features.
Come down to the store.
Listen to the big sound of a little Eleven.
It's for sure you'll run out of the store with one.
And you won't need muscles or track shoes. It's that light
So is the Diice.
