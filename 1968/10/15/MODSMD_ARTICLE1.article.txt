# SES To Rescue 'Neglected' Undergraduates?
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
At Stanford, undergraduates
don't count. They are insigni
ficant because faculty have
little interest in them. Faculty
care about other things — like

research grants, tenure, gradu
ate students; and publishing or
perishing.
You must grasp the monu
mental insignificance of under
graduates to appreciate the new
paper "by the Study of Education
at Stanford (SES) on Under
graduate Education. SES points
out that undergraduate educa
tion at Stanford is a fraud, and
makes some recommendations
on what we can do about it.
Naturally the 48-page paper
doesn't use nasty words like
••fraud." But it is remarkably
fiWUVk.

The key sentence in the SES
report is: "The faculty of to
day's university, for better or
worse, Consists of a collection
of discipline - oriented special
ists." These specialists have
made Stanford famous for re
search and graduate training.
But "general education" — the
thing undergraduates want —
is "dead or dying" not only at
Stanford, but throughout the
nation, says SES. Why? Because
professors neglect undergradu
ates. Teaching is left to graduate
students. Instead of giving un
dergraduates freedom to choose
their courses, and accepting the
burden of advising to help them
make those choices, the faculty
prescribes a jungle of course re
quirements.
"The prescriptiveness of the
General Studies program," says
SES, is "a symbol of the facul
ty's lack of concern with under
graduate education." And the
General Studies requirements
themselves result from "a set of

political compromises among in
terest groups in the faculty,"
suggests SES.
A Return to Older Traditions
'The recommendations in this
report represent a return to
some of the older traditions of
higher learning, traditions from
which American universities
have strayed too far in the in
terests of convenience and mass
production, 1 ' says SES.
Obviously a quick solution to
the undergraduates' plight would
be to wipe out the competition.
Stanford could cancel all $60
million in research contracts,
abolish the archaic department
structure, and expel all gradu
ate students. But SES probably
didn't even consider this course
of action, because it would result
in all the faculty resigning in
protest. And then Stanford
would cease to be Eminent.
No, SES realizes that no re
form of undergraduate educa
tion is feasible that would threat

en the "rea'ity of university or
ganization," as report says
sweetly. SES's sharp-tongued
paper seks on'y to arouse the
faculty's guilty conscience.
Western Civ To Abolished
With this background, it
should be easier to i nderstand
the SES recommendations for
what they are — an earnest at
tempt to rescue undergraduate
education from a bureaucratic,
computerized mediocrity.
SES wants General Studies re
quirements to be virtually a
bolished. Freshman English and
Western Civilization (the Uni
versity's answer to television)
would be scrapped. Instead
freshmen would take a small
Freshman Tutorial, featuring a
real, live professor teaching on
whatever he knows best.
Quarters would be replaced
by semesters with two-week
reading periods, so students can
seek to understand rather than
rush to perform assigned tasks.
Departments are urged to pro

vide more honors programs and
directed rending. In general, "a
dramatic shift in the allocation
of teaching resources at the un
dergraduate level" is asked.
In many other specific recom
mendations (summarized in ac
companying table), SES echoes
this theme: "Free both teacher
and student of tramme's that
restrain the freedom to teach
and learn that ought to char
acterize the University. Our
present arrangements place far
too much reliance on prescrip
tion." And even if reforms don't
win faculty to the cause of un
dergraduate education, perhaps
the undergraduate will be chal
lenged to go out and seek edu
cation more eagerly. Now all
they do is follow directions.
Dean of Undergraduate
Education Proposed
But SES knows that the odds
against excellence in undergrad
uate education are very high at
Stanford. Re-writing the rule
book won't be enough. Some

bodv with clout will have to
work fur-time for The Cause.
At present Stanford has no such
person. SES proposes such an
administrator, to be called D?an
of Undergraduate Education. He
would be "the academic advocate
for the interests of the under
graduate."
Please note the use of the
word "advocate." Only the op
pressed need advocates. The pro
posal is frank recognition that
the wielders of academic power
at Stanford put other concerns
ahead of undergraduate educa
tion.
Engineering School Sets
Example
This situation was confronted
earlier this year by the School
of Engineering in a curriculum
study. The school has been a
microcosm of the whole Univer
sity: graduate study and re
search grew magnificent l y, while
undergraduate education went
to hell. The Engineering study
group, headed by Prof. Ralph

J. Smith, went so far as to pro
pose an "Undergraduate Divi
sion" within the Engineering
School. Only by this drastic or
ganizational change did Smith
and his committee think they
could maintain faculty attention
for undergraduate teaching.
(Incidentally, the engineering
•taculty would accept only a
watered-down version of the pro
posal — an "Undergraduate
Council." This was seen as less
of a threat to the hegemony of
individual departments.)
'Bitter Fights' Over Proposals
As the professed champion
of the neglected undergraduate,
SES has made a significant at
tack on the status quo. But there
is no assurance that the status
quo will budge. The report (sec
ond of many on all aspects of
the University) is merely a set
of proposals, which must pass
the faculty senate and the Board
of Trustees.
Bitter fights are likely over
