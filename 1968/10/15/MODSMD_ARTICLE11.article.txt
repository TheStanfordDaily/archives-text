# Candidate Urges Fight For Change
## 
### DAVID LISCHINSKY 
Peggy Terry, Peace and Free
dom candidate for vice-president
will speak at Tresidder Union
this morning at 10 a.m.
Miss Terry, Eldridge Cleaver's
running mate, is a member of
JOIN Community Union—an or
ganization of poor whites in Chi
cago—and is editor of JOIN'S
newspaper, The Firing Line.
When asked about JOIN'S pur
pose she replied, "JOIN is an or
ganization of neighborhood peo
ple who want to improve their
neighborhood and country.
These people feel that only when
all of the little people get to
gether can they begin to change
the neighborhood. They realize
that the people who run things—
politicians, cops, landlords, etc.
—will not listen to one person.
It takes lots of people getting to
gether to fight for their rights
in order to change the way
things are."
Poverty and exploitation in
America are not abstractions for
Peggy Terry—she speaks from
personal experience. Born into a
family of poor white itinerants,
she has lived with poverty, hun
ger and fear for most of her
life. Now she is "helping to or
ganize poor whites to fight
back."
When describing her early life,
Peggy Terry speaks calmly and
quietly: "I was born in Hailey
ville, Oklahoma, within sight of
the McCallister Penitentiary.
The McCallister pen is where
Tom Joad, the main character in
The Grapes of Wrath, was im

prisoned. My people are of Irish
immigrant stock; we were very
poor and, like the Joads, traveled
around in a battered old car
looking for any kind of work."
Just staying alive was a con
stant problem, she relates. "Part
of each day was spent climbing
up and throwing coal off the coal
trains . . . Some of the coal we
used for heat, and the rest we
carried on our back and sold to
buy food. Sometimes the rail
road dicks would shoot at us
with rifles.
"Shooting at us never did any
good because we were more
afraid of slow death by cold and
hunger than we were of quick
death by a bullet . . . The tune
of the day, I remember, was
'Life is Just a Bowl of Cher
ries'."
