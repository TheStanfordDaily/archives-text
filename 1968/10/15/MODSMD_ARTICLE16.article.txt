# African Table
## 
### 
For almost two years a very
interesting event has been go
ing on, probably without the
knowledge of many people on
campus. The "African Table" is
a Monday noon luncheon event
where the African students, stu
dents and professors in African
studies, and all friends of Africa
meet for discussion.
It is a very friendly and
rather informal get-together for
exchanging views on diverse
topics including social, cultural,
and political events in Africa.
Guest speakers are often in
vited either to lead a discussion
or to give a brief talk on some
special topic.
The Organization of African
Students at Stanford (OASS)
plans to make this year's Afri
can Table a more interesting
one. The OASS members hope
to share their cultural heritage,
which dates back to pre-historic
times, with members of the
Stanford Community.
The African Table will meet
this year at the International
Center on Mondays at noon.
Each person provides his own
lunch and the OASS provides
coffee. _
