# Discussion Groups Replace Intended SDS-SRI Encounter
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
An SDS • SRI confrontation
fizzled out yesterday, but was
replaced by a two-hour dialogue
between Students for a Demo
cratic Society (SDS) members
and Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) employees.
SRI spokesmen made it clear
from the beginning that no offi
cial discussions could be held
before the half-dozen television
cameras and microphones as
sembled in front of the SRI
building complex in Menlo Park.
Instead, the 75 demonstrators
were invited to begin regularly
scheduled appointments between
SRI and any interested Stanford
students.
Public Relations Director
Homer Medders immediately of
fered the radicals a 9 a.m. ap
pointment for today, with places
for five students.
Five students accepted the of
fer over the protestations of
several SDS members that all
discussions be "open dialogues
and not held in private since
they affect so many lives."
Town Meetings Suggested
Besides the projected appoint
ments between students and SRI
management and employees, SRI
spokesmen were also receptive
to open town meetings between

Stanford students and any in
terested SRI employees. They
urged students to begin plans
for the meetings.
The beginning of the SDS-SRI
dialogue comes several days af
ter the announcement by Acting
Stanford President Robert Glas
er of a 12-member committee to
study the University's relation
ship to the Stanford-owned re
search institute.
President - designate Kenneth
Pitzer explained yesterday in a
Daily interview that he and
Glaser discussed "five or six
weeks ago the need for a high
priority investigation" of SRI.
SRI Board Chairman Ernest Ar
buckle was also included in the
discussion, according to Pitzer.
Cameras Grind
After a short noon White
Plaza rally and a brief television
confrontation between several
SDS members and SRI Security
Director Lloyd Schuknecht, the
rest of the afternoon was mark
edly quiet and calm.
SDS demands for "open dia
logues now so that all of us
— Stanford students, employees,
and the American public —
know what's going on here be
cause I don't think the American
public would tolerate it," as
voiced by English Prof. Bruce

Franklin, were coi ntered by
Schuknecht and Medders' dec
larations that "this is neither the
right time nor the right place"
for official discussions.
Medders then proposed the
series of small group discussions
and investigations by five stu
dents per session. He noted that
SRI would accommodate any
student requests for interviews
with employees, noting that sev
eral groups of students have
spoken with SRI authorities in
the past several we x ks.
Talks With Workers?
Left unclear was the possi
bility of student disci vssion*?
with employees in sensitive or
classified areas. It is expect d
that this issue will brought
up at this morning' meeting.
Franklin noted that the
group's purpose was not to dem
onstrate or to lectur" 1
but rather "to learn, to talk
with people."
Briefly after five students ac
cepted the meeting invitation,
SRI Executive Vice-Presid"nt
Gibson walked through SRI hall
ways, inviting emr-loyees to talk
with the students assembled out
side. More than 15 employees
responded, while many more ob
served the proceedings behind

the safety of SRl's tinted plate
glass windows.
Spirited Debates
The demonstration then quick
ly broke up into little knots of
one SRI employee and four or
five students. The debates were
vigorous and last for more than
two hours until rain drove em
ployees inside and students back
to campus.
SRI workers were all quizzed
on their type of work, their
knowledge of classified defense
work undertaken by the institu
tion, and their moral philoso
phies toward war research.
Typical was the debate be
tween SDS member Fred Cohen
and economic development em
ployee Andrew Khourie. Cohen
maintained that "politics is not
only voting. The $30 million de
fense department contract with
SRI is a political act."
Views Polarized
Khourie quickly responded,
'No it isn't." The two agreed
that they operated from two to
ta'ly opposite political philoso
phies.
The noon White Plaza rally
before the tr >k to Menlo Park
drew over 200 persons, includ
ing many onlookers, several ad
ministrators, and over 30 news
men.
Senior Bill Klingel opened the
rally, claiming that "those who
run the University are only in
terested in a reappraisal of the
ties with SRI." He asked that
a "political perspective" be add
ed to the investigation.
He said SDS would "oppose
all Stanford imperialism no mat
t r what reforms the trustees
propose in the structure of SRI."
"All these reforms at the lib
eral end of the range of pre
sumptions (illustrate SRl's
view) that American develop
ment of the world is good —
it's profitable, but good.
"Contrary to what we've been
told, what we learned in last
