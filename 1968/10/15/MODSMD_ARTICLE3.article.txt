# H & S Tables Resolution On Dean
## 
### 
The School of Humanities and
Sciences yesterday voted to ta
ble a resolution opposing the
creation of a post of Dean of
Undergraduate Education. The
resolution, as introduced, was in
conflict with a recent SES pro
posal for the creation of such a
post.
Approximately 130 faculty
members attended the meeting
at which Provost Richard Ly
man promised that no one would
be named to the post until after
the SES reports on Undergradu
ate Education and The Govern
ance of the University have
been officially released.
Lyman also assured the fac
ulty that if the dean is ever
named, it would only be after
a selection process involving
both students and members of
the Humanities and Sciences
faculty. The dean would also be
a member of the H & S faculty,
Lyman promised.
