### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
Robert J. Glaser socks it to
'em!
Though acting president for
little more than a month, Glaser
has brought energy, frankness,
drama, and leadership to Stan
ford, four characteristics long

absent from the Stanford presi
dency.
In private and public he says
exactly what he thinks, often in
blunt language. Quite simply,
Glaser doesn't mess around, and
it increasingly seems a pity he
can't remain as president.

President designate Pi t z e r
could do worse than learn from
Glaser. Former President Wal
lace Sterling was Stanford's
man of the hour for growth, but
failed as a dynamic leader when
students became restless and ac
tively concerned about their so
ciety and university. Glaser
seems far more aware of stu
dent attitudes and is in greater
sympathy with them than most
parents, faculty members, and
administrators combined.
Glaser's dramatic appearance
before LASSU last week to an
nounce plans for a review of
SRI, exemplifies his style and
the effects it can have.
There is a direct ratio be
tween presidential leadership at
Stanford and student activism,
particularly militant student ac
tivism. The more dynamic the
leadership, the less chance there
is for angry student activity.
This formula, of course, as
sumes that presidential activity
will be in alliance with rather
than antithetical to student con
cerns. Obviously powerful ad
ministration leadership in con
servative causes would spark a
student response, but Glaser's
activities should be complemen
tary to liberal student desires.
Glaser's plan to study SRI
during the next six months will

not satisfy SDS. Clearly, It's too
early to know whether it will
satisfy anyone, but if the study
is like its initiator, it will spare
nothing in its analysis, and will
present the blunt facts about
SRI.
The study should make the
SRI issue less than inflamma
tory for most students, though
SDS undoubtedly will attempt to
carry on its guerilla activities
this week in hopes of mobilizing
the campus for militant action
in support of its demands. Be
fore Glaser's action, SDS might
have succeeded. It now appears
to be hurting badly, and in
search of some other issue.
Not that the SDS demands are
wildly unreasonable. Without
question, SRI is less than a
wholesome bedmate for Stan
ford scholars and has placed
Stanford in a most compromis
ing position with classified re
search, especially war research.
The University should long
ago have ended its relationship
with this cousin of the Rand
Corporation and the campus
should thank SDS for forcing
some painful self-analysis.
Glaser's response to the de
mands is balanced, in good rea
son, and damn good tactics. In
past years, once demands had
been nailed to doors, administra
tors would have begun digging

foxho'es in their offices rather
than responding directly to
thoughtful concerns. Perhaps
the SDS time limit is unraason
able, but, as Glaser realized, get
ting up-tight about deadlines is
the surest way to trouble.
But what will happen, to the
SRI study and Stanford in gen
eral when Glaser leaves? He
noted at the LASSU meeting
that Pitzer was in "100 per cent"
agreement on the need for an
SRI review. That is only some
what reassuring. The key ques
tion is: would Pitzer have ini
tiated the review? Would he
have responded to SDS in an
equally thoughtful manner?
Answers will become apparent
after December 1, when Pitzer
officially takes office. Meanwhile,
one can only wonder and ask
some further questions:
SRI is the Trustees' baby.
Glaser has little to lose by tam
pering with the Trustees. Pitzer
does. Will he tamper?
Can Pitzer objectively call for
a review of SRI when he sits on
the Board of the Rand Co.?
In sum, will Pitzer be the free
agent and open mind Stanford
so desperately needs as its presi
dent?
If he fails, it will not be for
lack of a forceful precedent.
Robert Glaser is making sure of
that.
