## More About Election 
### JIM SPICKARD 
It is quite understandable
that Denis Hayes is upset about
the second Constitution on this
week's referendum ballot. The
first Constitution was his baby,
and when a group of students
threatens to present a real
choice in the election, parental
fear and anger takes over.
The most ridiculous of Denis'
claims is that our Assembly
will contain up to 1000 members,

that our legal aid fund will be
bankrupt the minute a member
requests Melvin Belli as lawyer,
and that the president could be
come a dictator.
In the first place, the As
sembly would be elected in the
same manner as the 150 man
LASSU (from residences and
off-campus) so that it will be
no larger.
Second, as to our legal aid
program, any student who feels
his rights are infringed at Stan
ford may appeal to the Associa
tion's legal counsel for defense.
Unless that counsel is Mr. Belli,
there is no chance that he will
be involved. The Association's
lawyer will defend Association
members.
Third, the section on appoint
ments was copied directly from
Denis' Constitution. Any fault
he finds with us he had better
find with himself also. But un
der either Constitution the Sen
ate must confirm all appoint
ments.

The thing Denis does not
seem to realize both in propos
ing his Constitution (which re
forms the present LASSU struc
ture and little else) and in at
tacking ours, is that students
at present have no legal power
and no legal voice at this Uni
versity.
It took a sit-in last spring
to force the Administration to
recognize the tri-partite judicial
agreement of 1964. Under Denis'
Constitution as under the pres
ent one it would take similar
action to force the Administra
tion to live up to any agree
ments they have made. We have
no protection against whimsy,
breach of faith, or lapse of
memory.
Our Constitution proposes to
establish a legal alternative to
coercion. By incorporating as a
legal body, we can make con
tractually binding agreements
with the university, and any
double-dealing or foot-dragging
may be taken to the courts.
But there is one more point
for the voter in this election.
If you firmly believe that one
constitution is excellent, vote for
it. If you believe that they are
both good, make a rational
choice, because the one that
passes will be around for quite
a white. It can be amended but
probably not reformed in its
basic principles for several
years.
But if you believe that neither
is good then vote against them
both, and work after the elec
tion for a compromise to be sub
mitted later in the year. It is
far better to put through a good
constitution, even if we have to
wait, than one that does not
fit our ideals.

It is quite understandable
that Denis Hayes is upset about
the second Constitution on this
week's referendum ballot. The
first Constitution was his baby,
and when a group of students
threatens to present a real
choice in the election, parental
fear and anger takes over.
The most ridiculous of Denis'
claims is that our Assembly
will contain up to 1000 members,

that our legal aid fund will be
bankrupt the minute a member
requests Melvin Belli as lawyer,
and that the president could be
come a dictator.
In the first place, the As
sembly would be elected in the
same manner as the 150 man
LASSU (from residences and
off-campus) so that it will be
no larger.
Second, as to our legal aid
program, any student who feels
his rights are infringed at Stan
ford may appeal to the Associa
tion's legal counsel for defense.
Unless that counsel is Mr. Belli,
there is no chance that he will
be involved. The Association's
lawyer will defend Association
members.
Third, the section on appoint
ments was copied directly from
Denis' Constitution. Any fault
he finds with us he had better
find with himself also. But un
der either Constitution the Sen
ate must confirm all appoint
ments.

The thing Denis does not
seem to realize both in propos
ing his Constitution (which re
forms the present LASSU struc
ture and little else) and in at
tacking ours, is that students
at present have no legal power
and no legal voice at this Uni
versity.
It took a sit-in last spring
to force the Administration to
recognize the tri-partite judicial
agreement of 1964. Under Denis'
Constitution as under the pres
ent one it would take similar
action to force the Administra
tion to live up to any agree
ments they have made. We have
no protection against whimsy,
breach of faith, or lapse of
memory.
Our Constitution proposes to
establish a legal alternative to
coercion. By incorporating as a
legal body, we can make con
tractually binding agreements
with the university, and any
double-dealing or foot-dragging
may be taken to the courts.
But there is one more point
for the voter in this election.
If you firmly believe that one
constitution is excellent, vote for
it. If you believe that they are
both good, make a rational
choice, because the one that
passes will be around for quite
a white. It can be amended but
probably not reformed in its
basic principles for several
years.
But if you believe that neither
is good then vote against them
both, and work after the elec
tion for a compromise to be sub
mitted later in the year. It is
far better to put through a good
constitution, even if we have to
wait, than one that does not
fit our ideals.
