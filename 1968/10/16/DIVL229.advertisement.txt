Reading Dynamics is an incredible education breakthrough that you , % j' ' IS
can dovetail right into your regular school year. It is the definitive } 114
rapid reading method in the world today because their graduates con- HHk|§ jiillif^y^
sistently surpass the 450 to 600 word per minute rates aspired to by
conventional reading courses. Most Reading Dynamics graduates can
read between 1,000 and 3,000 words per minute. Many go higher, and
all understand and appreciate what they read at these staggering speeds.
Just stop and think of the tremendous knowledge explosion that has
taken place during the last thirty years in business, science, psychology, , -

Reading Dynamics is an incredible education breakthrough that you , % j' ' IS
can dovetail right into your regular school year. It is the definitive } 114
rapid reading method in the world today because their graduates con- HHk|§ jiillif^y^
sistently surpass the 450 to 600 word per minute rates aspired to by
conventional reading courses. Most Reading Dynamics graduates can
read between 1,000 and 3,000 words per minute. Many go higher, and
all understand and appreciate what they read at these staggering speeds.
Just stop and think of the tremendous knowledge explosion that has
taken place during the last thirty years in business, science, psychology, , -
history and even the arts. Thirty years ago you didn't have to know
about NASA, cybernetics, the One-Dimensional Man or John Updike,
and over half of the subjects listed in today's college catalogs were not

FREE READING DYNAMICS MINI-LESSON W
Does Reading Dynamics really work? Well there is one way to find l||

sistently surpass the 450 to 600 word per minute rates aspired to by
conventional reading courses. Most Reading Dynamics graduates can
read between 1,000 and 3,000 words per minute. Many go higher, and
all understand and appreciate what they read at these staggering speeds.
Just stop and think of the tremendous knowledge explosion that has
taken place during the last thirty years in business, science, psychology, , -
history and even the arts. Thirty years ago you didn't have to know
about NASA, cybernetics, the One-Dimensional Man or John Updike,
and over half of the subjects listed in today's college catalogs were not
offered then. = *$fs
