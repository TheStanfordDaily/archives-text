# Santa Clara Police 'Play It By Ear'
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
On registration day, Associate
Dean of Students Bill Wyman
answered his phone and listened
in astonishment as a Santa
Clara police sergeant announced,
"Our boys are loading onto bus
es and we're coming up to get
your radicals with tear gas and
billy clubs. A couple of nights
in jail ought to cool 'em down a
bit."
The sergeant, Don Tamm, was
joking. Bill Wyman wasn't
laughing.
Apart from occasional jokes,
the Santa Clara police make a
serious business of law enforce
ment with particular attention
focused on understanding and
following moments of crisis at
Stanford.
During the sit-in last May, two
plainclothes policemen were con
stantly on duty in the Old Union,
circulating to catch the mood
and prepare for any turns to
ward violence. The Santa Clara
Sheriff's office was continually
in contact with the Stanford ad
ministration and leaders of the
sit-in.
Not Called
The county police were not
called in to evict students and
clearly had no desire to be called.
Sheriff Charles Prelsnik, who
closely resembles Broderick
Crawford of "Highway Patrol,"
intends to keep his men off cam
pus in demonstrations unless
their use is requested by the ad
ministration.
The Stanford administration is
equally unenthusiastic about
using police. Provost Richard
Lyman says,"The use of police
at campuses around the country
has only worsened the situation.
No one in his right mind would
call in the police unless there
were overwhelming reasons,
such as property destruction."
Legally, police will not enter
private property until there is a
declaration of trespass by the
owners. No such declaration
came from the Stanford admin
istration last spring. An area of
ambiguity remains, however, at
times when the administration
will not declare trespassing but
the police think the situation
warrants their presence.
Personal Judgement
Sheriff Prelsnik, speaking in

his plush San Jose office, notes,
"Such situations are a matter
of personal judgement. We play
them by ear, and try to keep on
the scene to anticipate major
changes in mood, etc."
If the need for police action
at Stanford arises, the Sheriff
is confident his "special force"
will handle the situation with an
emphasis on calm and non-vio
lence. He says, "We aren't look
ing for anymore trouble than
anyone else. We don't believe in
over-reacting or using force
when it's not necessary."
The Sheriff continued his ex
planation after pointing behind
him to a plaque holding the
"Law Enforcement Code Of
Ethics." Excerpts from this
document read: "As A Law En
forcement Officer (Sic), my fun
damental duty is to serve man
kind; to safeguard lives and
property, to protect the innocent
against deception, the weak
against oppression or intimida
tion ... I will never act officious
ly or permit personal feelings,
prejudices,, animosities, or
friendships to influence my deci
sions ... I will never employ
unnecessary force or vio
lence . . ."
Follow Ethics
Sheriff Prelsnik, a heavily set,
cheerful ex-FBI agent, believes,
"my men follow those ethics.
I've got a special group of fellas
for tough assignments, such as
a violent demonstration at Stan
ford. They're aware of the abuse
they may encounter, but before
they go up there, they'll be com
pletely briefed on the situation
and the attitudes."
Commenting on demonstra
tions in general, Prelsnik said,
"The right to dissent belongs to
everyone and there's no problem
as long as demonstrations are
peaceful. The sit-in in the Old
Union last May didn't cause any
problem. It was within the
bounds of peaceful conduct."
Prelsnik jokingly used the
phrase "facist pig" several
times as he talked and philoso
phically explained, "No one likes
to be called names, but this is
the business we're in."
Legal Relationship
During a tour of the Sheriff's
Department facilities, Sergeant
Tamm discussed the legal rela-

tionship between the sheriff's
forces and Stanford. Tamm, who
is the department's community
relations officer, said, "Stanford
is an unincorporated part of
Santa Clara County. Santa Clara
police are responsible for basic
law enforcement in unincorpo
rated areas. The Stanford police
are not deputies or peace offi
cers, they are a security force,
and our department, for exam
ple, doesn't back up Stanford
police tickets for parking.
"The University has contract
ed for a traffic patrol, and we
are on campus four hours a day
looking for violations and giving
our own tickets."
As Tamm talked, he stopped
the tour outside the narcotics
room and a quick look indicated
the police are well briefed on
drugs. Four display cases hung
on the wall, two exhibiting dan
gerous and habit forming drugs.
All conceivable drugs and para
phernalia for their use were in
cluded, with larger objects such

as water pipes sitting discreetly
behind the chief narcotics offi
cer's desk.
Don't Snoop
When asked later about drug
use at Stanford, the sheriff
stated, "We have no regular pa
trol on campus, so we must be
invited in for narcotics investi
gations. We don't go snooping
around."
The sheriff, however, admitted
that elsewhere in the county, his
officers do snoop around and he
remarked that arrests and con
victions on drug abuse had in
creased several hundred per cent
in recent years. Prelsnik ex
plained this unbalanced system
by noting, "I have no knowledge
of major drug abuse at Stan
ford. If such facts were brought
to our attention we might have
to act."
He laughingly commented on
the recent arrest of a Stanford
student living off campus who
had, "quite a crop growing in
his backyard."

"Such situations are a matter
of personal judgement. We play

the scene to anticipate major
changes in mood, etc."
If the need for police action
at Stanford arises, the Sheriff
is confident his "special force"
will handle the situation with an
emphasis on calm and non-vio
lence. He says, "We aren't look
ing for anymore trouble than
anyone else. We don't believe in
over-reacting or using force
when it's not necessary."
The Sheriff continued his ex
planation after pointing behind
him to a plaque holding the
"Law Enforcement Code Of
Ethics." Excerpts from this
document read: "As A Law En
forcement Officer (Sic), my fun
damental duty is to serve man
kind; to safeguard lives and
property, to protect the innocent
against deception, the weak
against oppression or intimida
tion ... I will never act officious
ly or permit personal feelings,
prejudices,, animosities, or
friendships to influence my deci
sions ... I will never employ
unnecessary force or vio
lence . . ."
Follow Ethics
Sheriff Prelsnik, a heavily set,
cheerful ex-FBI agent, believes,
"my men follow those ethics.
I've got a special group of fellas
for tough assignments, such as
a violent demonstration at Stan
ford. They're aware of the abuse
they may encounter, but before
they go up there, they'll be com
pletely briefed on the situation
and the attitudes."
Commenting on demonstra
tions in general, Prelsnik said,
"The right to dissent belongs to
everyone and there's no problem
as long as demonstrations are
peaceful. The sit-in in the Old
Union last May didn't cause any
problem. It was within the
bounds of peaceful conduct."
Prelsnik jokingly used the
phrase "facist pig" several
times as he talked and philoso
phically explained, "No one likes
to be called names, but this is
the business we're in."
Legal Relationship
During a tour of the Sheriff's
Department facilities, Sergeant
Tamm discussed the legal rela-

tionship between the sheriff's
forces and Stanford. Tamm, who
is the department's community
relations officer, said, "Stanford
is an unincorporated part of
Santa Clara County. Santa Clara
police are responsible for basic
law enforcement in unincorpo
rated areas. The Stanford police
are not deputies or peace offi
cers, they are a security force,
and our department, for exam
ple, doesn't back up Stanford
police tickets for parking.
"The University has contract
ed for a traffic patrol, and we
are on campus four hours a day
looking for violations and giving
our own tickets."
As Tamm talked, he stopped
the tour outside the narcotics
room and a quick look indicated
the police are well briefed on
drugs. Four display cases hung
on the wall, two exhibiting dan
gerous and habit forming drugs.
All conceivable drugs and para
phernalia for their use were in
cluded, with larger objects such

as water pipes sitting discreetly
behind the chief narcotics offi
cer's desk.
Don't Snoop
When asked later about drug
use at Stanford, the sheriff
stated, "We have no regular pa
trol on campus, so we must be
invited in for narcotics investi
gations. We don't go snooping
around."
The sheriff, however, admitted
that elsewhere in the county, his
officers do snoop around and he
remarked that arrests and con
victions on drug abuse had in
creased several hundred per cent
in recent years. Prelsnik ex
plained this unbalanced system
by noting, "I have no knowledge
of major drug abuse at Stan
ford. If such facts were brought
to our attention we might have
to act."
He laughingly commented on
the recent arrest of a Stanford
student living off campus who
had, "quite a crop growing in
his backyard."

the scene to anticipate major
changes in mood, etc."
If the need for police action
at Stanford arises, the Sheriff
is confident his "special force"
will handle the situation with an
emphasis on calm and non-vio
lence. He says, "We aren't look
ing for anymore trouble than
anyone else. We don't believe in
over-reacting or using force
when it's not necessary."
The Sheriff continued his ex
planation after pointing behind
him to a plaque holding the
"Law Enforcement Code Of
Ethics." Excerpts from this
document read: "As A Law En
forcement Officer (Sic), my fun
damental duty is to serve man
kind; to safeguard lives and
property, to protect the innocent
against deception, the weak
against oppression or intimida
tion ... I will never act officious
ly or permit personal feelings,
prejudices,, animosities, or
friendships to influence my deci
sions ... I will never employ
unnecessary force or vio
lence . . ."
Follow Ethics
Sheriff Prelsnik, a heavily set,
cheerful ex-FBI agent, believes,
"my men follow those ethics.
I've got a special group of fellas
for tough assignments, such as
a violent demonstration at Stan
ford. They're aware of the abuse
they may encounter, but before
they go up there, they'll be com
pletely briefed on the situation
and the attitudes."
Commenting on demonstra
tions in general, Prelsnik said,
"The right to dissent belongs to
everyone and there's no problem
as long as demonstrations are
peaceful. The sit-in in the Old
Union last May didn't cause any
problem. It was within the
bounds of peaceful conduct."
Prelsnik jokingly used the
phrase "facist pig" several
times as he talked and philoso
phically explained, "No one likes
to be called names, but this is
the business we're in."
Legal Relationship
During a tour of the Sheriff's
Department facilities, Sergeant
Tamm discussed the legal rela-

tionship between the sheriff's
forces and Stanford. Tamm, who
is the department's community
relations officer, said, "Stanford
is an unincorporated part of
Santa Clara County. Santa Clara
police are responsible for basic
law enforcement in unincorpo
rated areas. The Stanford police
are not deputies or peace offi
cers, they are a security force,
and our department, for exam
ple, doesn't back up Stanford
police tickets for parking.
"The University has contract
ed for a traffic patrol, and we
are on campus four hours a day
looking for violations and giving
our own tickets."
As Tamm talked, he stopped
the tour outside the narcotics
room and a quick look indicated
the police are well briefed on
drugs. Four display cases hung
on the wall, two exhibiting dan
gerous and habit forming drugs.
All conceivable drugs and para
phernalia for their use were in
cluded, with larger objects such

as water pipes sitting discreetly
behind the chief narcotics offi
cer's desk.
Don't Snoop
When asked later about drug
use at Stanford, the sheriff
stated, "We have no regular pa
trol on campus, so we must be
invited in for narcotics investi
gations. We don't go snooping
around."
The sheriff, however, admitted
that elsewhere in the county, his
officers do snoop around and he
remarked that arrests and con
victions on drug abuse had in
creased several hundred per cent
in recent years. Prelsnik ex
plained this unbalanced system
by noting, "I have no knowledge
of major drug abuse at Stan
ford. If such facts were brought
to our attention we might have
to act."
He laughingly commented on
the recent arrest of a Stanford
student living off campus who
had, "quite a crop growing in
his backyard."

BRODERICK CRAWFORD? — No, it's the Sheriff of Santa Clara
County, Charles Prelsnik, who's a bit more gun-shy than the star
of "Highway Patrol."
On registration day, Associate
Dean of Students Bill Wyman
answered his phone and listened
in astonishment as a Santa
Clara police sergeant announced,
"Our boys are loading onto bus
es and we're coming up to get
your radicals with tear gas and
billy clubs. A couple of nights
in jail ought to cool 'em down a
bit."
The sergeant, Don Tamm, was
joking. Bill Wyman wasn't
laughing.
Apart from occasional jokes,
the Santa Clara police make a
serious business of law enforce
ment with particular attention
focused on understanding and
following moments of crisis at
Stanford.
During the sit-in last May, two
plainclothes policemen were con
stantly on duty in the Old Union,
circulating to catch the mood
and prepare for any turns to
ward violence. The Santa Clara
Sheriff's office was continually
in contact with the Stanford ad
ministration and leaders of the
sit-in.
Not Called
The county police were not
called in to evict students and
clearly had no desire to be called.
Sheriff Charles Prelsnik, who
closely resembles Broderick
Crawford of "Highway Patrol,"
intends to keep his men off cam
pus in demonstrations unless
their use is requested by the ad
ministration.
The Stanford administration is
equally unenthusiastic about
using police. Provost Richard
Lyman says,"The use of police
at campuses around the country
has only worsened the situation.
No one in his right mind would
call in the police unless there
were overwhelming reasons,
such as property destruction."
Legally, police will not enter
private property until there is a
declaration of trespass by the
owners. No such declaration
came from the Stanford admin
istration last spring. An area of
ambiguity remains, however, at
times when the administration
will not declare trespassing but
the police think the situation
warrants their presence.
Personal Judgement
Sheriff Prelsnik, speaking in

his plush San Jose office, notes,
"Such situations are a matter
of personal judgement. We play
