EDITOR'S NOTE: The folk
lug exerpts have been tab
from students' testimony to t
Academic Senate concerning tl
Reserve Officers Tral n 1 n
Corps.
MARK EDWARDS
The Academic Senate is cui
rently considering the status c
military courses on campus.
This investigation was in
tiated in part by the Sneed-Kos
telanetz report, a document pre
senting the views of a number
of faculty members concerning
credit for R.O.T.C. Sneed and
Kostelanetz question both the
rigor and content of R.O.T.C.
courses and especially criticize
the control and determination of
texts, instructors and general
curriculum by people outside the
university community, namely
the Pentagon and the federal
government.
In my opinion, all specifically
military "indoctrination," "famil
iarization" and "career orienta
tion" should be taught in sepa
rate noncredit courses. The re
maining course material could be
covered either by course substi
tution and/or restructured, su
pervised credit courses offered
by R.O.T.C. instructors.
If revised R.O.T.C. courses are
to be offered for credit, the offi
cers involved could be given the
academic rank of instructor.
Whatever the final solution in
the R.O.T.C. problem, the Aca
demic Senate will be setting
some important precedents for
the University at large. First
they are and will be engaged in
both department and course re
view, considering both rigor and
content. The criteria used could
be easily and, I feel, construct
ively applied to other courses
and departments in the Univer
sity.
I have omitted all questions of
a moral nature. I feel this issue
can be best confronted on the
terms of the Sneed-Kostelanetz
report. Also I fear moral judg
ments that will open the door to
similar judgments from people
of other persuasions.

As I see it there are several
strains of thought in the various
opposition viewpoints to ROTC.
One is the argument that
ROTC has no place on a univer
sity campus and in particular on
the Stanford Campus. I disagree
completely with this idea.
On a pragmatic level, ROTC is
important to the University.
There are at present over 350
students enrolled in either Mili
tary, Naval or Air Science.
The three Military Science pro
grams are providing over 105
scholarships of full tuition,
books and fees to students in the
programs.
However, pragmatic considera
tions are not the only considera
tions in maintaining ROTC at
Stanford.

These are highly dedicated and
motivated men but their atti
tudes and perspective have been
shaped by close and constant
contact with the military over
an extended educational experi
ence.
On the other hand, ROTC par
ticularly at a school such as
Stanford, provides a unique op
portunity for the development
c " military leaders in an academ
ic and intellectual atmosphere.
It is important that the stu
dent take Military Science
courses while in the university
atmosphere so that he can in
fact examine the military in the
light of his own intellectual de
velopment.

Stanford seems to accept the
presence of the ROTC programs
on campus for three main rea
sons:
First, because the ROTC pro
vides a course sequence request
ed by approximately five hun
dred students, so that the very
strength of the demand should
justify its inclusion in the cur
riculum.
Second, because the ROTC
gives Stanford students the
same "advantages" that stu
dents have at many other col
leges across the country, mak
ing it a convenient way for stu
dents to fulfill the educational
requirements for an officer's
commission during their under
graduate years.
Third, because liberally-edu
cated officers are needed to main
tain civilian control of the mili
tary, to temper the influences of
the service academies' profes
sional soldiers.
In the first place, it seems
ridiculous to justify the "supply"
because of a spurious "demand."
Very few people are taking mili
tary science courses for their in
trinsic value. Most students see
them only as prerequisites for a
military career or an ROTC com
mission.
ROTC, in both purpose and
process, is primarily non-educa
tional, standing in basic opposi
tion to a concept of education
based on individual self-cogni
zance, where education is an in
ternal and not an imposed pro
cess.
The program itself is one of
dehumanization and indoctrina
tion, in which the cadet is viewed
as something non-human, a re

ceptacle of preformed conclu
sions.
Why should Stanford allow a
federal institution, according to
its self-determined, self-perpetu
ating, and legally enforced "na
tional needs" a prime position
from which to attract students?
Other institutions may offer
scholarships as incentives to stu
dents, but only ROTC moves in
with teachers and textbooks as
well.

What is the relationship of a
private university to the Federal
Government's desire to initiate
and fund programs whose only
justification seems to lie in their

similarity to the national inter
est—which is also defined by
those persons who devise the
programs?
We do not open our facilities
to everyone who has a service to
offer. What then, are the criteria
of exclusion and inclusion? Mon
ey? National interest? Intellec
tual value?
Clearly, when you are willing
to pay a student $14,000 for his
preparation to serve in the mili
tary and not a single dollar of
public money to a student who
chooses to serve his military ob
ligation as a conscientious ob
jector working as a hospital or
derly, you have placed very dif
ferent values on their lives.
