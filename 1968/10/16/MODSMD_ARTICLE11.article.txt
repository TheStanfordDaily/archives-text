# Letters To The Editor
## Langmuir's Correction 
### 
Editor, The DAILY:
On Friday your editor received
a letter from me stating very
clearly that the resolution pro
posed to the Humanities and Sci
ences Assembly said nothing
about the substance of SES rec
ommendations relevant to the
creation of a Dean of Under
graduate Studies, that it merely
asked that there be adequate
consultation about the nature of
the proposed office before an ap
pointment was made to that of
fice.
You did not print that letter.
Instead in Tuesday's Dally you
reported that a resolution "op
posing the creation of a post of
Dean of Undergraduate Educa
tion" was tabled, in direct con
tradiction to information avail
able to you.
The resolution was tabled be
cause Provost Lyman stated that
there would be adequate discus
sion ol the SES report before
an appointment, and that the
Humanities and Sciences facultj
and its Steering Committee
would be intimately involved in
the appointment of a search
committee.
Provost Lyman spoke directly
to the intent of the resolution;
you continued to distort it, al
though you had been informed
of your previous error. Irrespon
sible reporting does a disservice

to the v/ork of the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford and the hopes
for substantial reforms.

Chairman
Steering Committee of the
Hand S Assembly
• Rules For Faculty
Editor, THE DAILY:
An action taken by the Aca
demic Senate at its meeting last
Thursday is of particular inter
est at this time. The Senate voted
42 to 3 to approve the applica
tion to faculty members of judi
cial policies regarding campus
disruption.
In particular, the Senate en
dorsed as binding upon the fac
ulty the present policy on cam
pus disruption, and asserted that
procedures in effect for dealing
with student violations be ap
plicable to faculty violations in
regard both to procedures and to
findings.
The overwhelming majority by
which these actions were adopt-

Ed, with 45 representatives par
ticipating out of a total voting
membership of 53, is a strong
indication of the importance at
tached by the faculty to the
early establishment of sound
judicial procedures.

asked that there be adequate
consultation about the nature of
the proposed office before an ap
pointment was made to that of
fice.
You did not print that letter.
Instead in Tuesday's Dally you
reported that a resolution "op
posing the creation of a post of
Dean of Undergraduate Educa
tion" was tabled, in direct con
tradiction to information avail
able to you.
The resolution was tabled be
cause Provost Lyman stated that
there would be adequate discus
sion ol the SES report before
an appointment, and that the
Humanities and Sciences facultj
and its Steering Committee
would be intimately involved in
the appointment of a search
committee.
Provost Lyman spoke directly
to the intent of the resolution;
you continued to distort it, al
though you had been informed
of your previous error. Irrespon
sible reporting does a disservice

to the v/ork of the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford and the hopes
for substantial reforms.

• Rules For Faculty
Editor, THE DAILY:
An action taken by the Aca
demic Senate at its meeting last
Thursday is of particular inter
est at this time. The Senate voted
42 to 3 to approve the applica
tion to faculty members of judi
cial policies regarding campus
disruption.
In particular, the Senate en
dorsed as binding upon the fac
ulty the present policy on cam
pus disruption, and asserted that
procedures in effect for dealing
with student violations be ap
plicable to faculty violations in
regard both to procedures and to
findings.
The overwhelming majority by
which these actions were adopt-

Ed, with 45 representatives par
ticipating out of a total voting
membership of 53, is a strong
indication of the importance at
tached by the faculty to the
early establishment of sound
judicial procedures.

Chairman, Academic Senate
