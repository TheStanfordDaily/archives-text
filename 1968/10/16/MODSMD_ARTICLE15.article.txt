# Bio Committees Include Students
## 
### HUGH WONG 
The Biology department is cur
rently reorganizing the structure
of its standing committees in an
ittempt to incorporate more stu
dent participation into its deci
sion-making processes.
Although several graduate and
undergraduate students served
on an ad-hoc committee to rec
ommend curriculum changes
last year, this year's standing
committees will be the first for
mally organized bodies to which
specific duties have been desig
nated.
The four new standing com
mittees, composed of students
and faculty members, are:
• The Departmental Policy
Committee, which recommends
new appointments to the depart
ment, areas for new appoint
ments, and other major policy
changes. It also reviews the de
partment headship at three-year
intervals.
• .Committee on Undergradu
ate Studies, which reviews the
structure of the undergraduate
cui riculum, the assignment of
teaching responsibilities within
it, as well as the advising sys
tem and honors programs.
• Committee on Graduate
Studies, which reviews the grad
uate curriculum, the advising
system, admissions, problems
with the draft, and so forth.
• Committee on Facilities,

which is concerned with the li
brary, storeroom, space assign
ments, and other aspects of the
physical plant.
Composition
The first three committees will
be composed of a chairman, se
lected by the departmental fac
ulty, and three other faculty
members. In addition, the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Stud
ies will be composed of one
graduate and two undergradu
ate students; the Committee on
Graduate Studies, three gradu
ates; and the Departmental Pol
icy Committee, one graduate and
one undergraduate.
The means of selecting these
student members will be left en
tirely to the respective groups.
Biology undergraduates are in
vited to a meeting tonight at 8
p.m. in the Roble dining hall to
devise a means of selecting un
dergraduate members to the
standing committees. The ap
pointments to the committees
are effective immediately this
fall for a one year term.
Prof. Donald Kennedy, depart
ment chairman, believes that it
is "very important in making
Stanford more of a community,
that student activity take place
at a departmental level." The
recommendations of these com
mittees, he says, "usually carry
great influence," in that they are
rarely decided against
