# Thomas Leads Way
## Tribe Runners Upset Trojans 
### ALLEN MEREDITH 
With surprising strength,
depth and determination, the
Stanford cross-country team pro
duced the biggest upset of the
year last weekend by nipping
the number one-rated USC Tro
jans 49-50.
The scene was the Sacramento
State Invitational Meet, where
numerous teams from around
the country — including San
Diego State, Cal Davis, and San
Jose State — came to compete
but returned home perplexed by
a talented Indian tribe.
Senior Brook Thomas led the
team in its campaign to set back
the Trojans.
Thomas placed fourth, follow
ed by seventh, eighth, four
teenth, and sixteenth place ef
forts by Allen Sanford, Don
Kardong, Greg Brock and Chuck
Menz, respectively.
Strategic Preparations
The Indians arrived at the
new 4.2 mile course prepared
for a wet and slushy cross
country meet, and they weren't
disappointed. Expecting an ex
tremely fast pace in the first
mile, all seven runners got off to

a quick start, with Thomas and
Menz crossing the first mile at
4:32.
The large herd of some 200
harriers proceeded up along the
banks of the American River,
and at the 2.1 mile marker,
Thomas was clocked at 9:50
with his teammates not far be
hind.
When the pressure began to
mount as the runners began
closing in on the finish line, the
final kicks of Sanfond and Kar
dong proved decisive, as each
runner passed between four and
five men apiece to place sev
enth and eighth.
In cross country meets final
scores are determined by adding
up the places of the top five
finishers on each team. By add
ing up the fourth, seventh,
eighth, fourteenth and sixteenth
places that Stanford collected,
the Tribe's total was 49.
Unsung- Hero
Despite the fact that Duncan
Mac Donald did not place among
these top five, he played a key
role in the final result, by plac
ing 18th and keeping the fifth
USC runner behind him. Had

Mac Donald faltered, the USC
runner would have moved up
a notch and the Trojans would
have tied Stanford.
The Tribe's seventh man, Bob
Achondo, placed 31st with a
time of 22:19. Ochondo's fine
clocking was only 1:14 behind
Stanford's top man, Thomas,
who timed 21:05.
This Saturday the Trojans will
get a chance to avenge last
week's loss, when the Indians
host them on the Stanford golf
course. Cal Poly of Pomona will
also compete in the meet, which
starts at 10 a.m., but it will
most likely wind up in a close
battle between Stanford and
USC.
Tribe coach Marshall Clark
expects the Trojans to be really
up for Saturday's encounter.
"SC will have a lot of pictures
on the locker room door this
week," Clark commented.
Frosh Romp
While the varsity was squeak
ing by the Trojans, Stanford's
frosh team experienced no diffi
culty at all in outdistancing all
competition.
Sparked by a one-two finish by
Robert Coe and Jack Lawson,
the Papooses collected 48 points.
Their closest competition, UC
Davis, scored 130 points to take
second.


ONE, TWO — Brook Thomas (left) and Allen Sanford (right)
stretch it out during a pre season workout on the Stanford golf
course. The same duo finished fourth and seventh in Saturday's
Sacramento State Invitational as they led Stanford to a 49-50 upset
of the number one ranked USC Trojans. Southern Cal will get
a chance for revenge this Saturday as they take on the Tribe here
at Stanford.
