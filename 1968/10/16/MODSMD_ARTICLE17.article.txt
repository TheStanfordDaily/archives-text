# Cal Soccer Team Hands Indians Fifth Straight Loss
## 
### FRED PRIDDLE 
Outshot (30-10) and outscored
(1-0), the Stanford varsity soc
cer team battled the California
3ears for 88 minutes on a field
that was a sea of mud.
The outcome was decided by
a penalty shot. Up until then
it was anyone's game.
Stanford played three soccer
games with the Bears and the
referees called four penalties
against the Indians, one each
in the frosh and JV games and
two in the varsity contest. The
first was a foul by fullback Phil
Fletcher for illegal tackling, the
second against goalkeeper Dan
Clement for illegal charging.
The first penalty shot Cle
ment was unable to stop because
of the slippery footing, but the
second he was able to stop.
Tossup
The game was a tossup from
start to finish. A highly partisan
crowd of 300 roundly cheered
the spirited play of both teams.
The loss to California makes five
straight losses for the Indians.
In spite of this, the team is
steadily improving and may
come into its own before the
season is much older.
Coach Fred Priddle felt Dan
Clement was outstanding at
goal, while Stan Holmgren and

Phil Fletcher were outstanding
in the defense. The coaches were
pleased with the play of the en
tire team and subs.
JV's Lose
The JV's had their winning
streak stopped at two by losing
to California 4-1. A penalty shot
and injury to goalkeeper Den
nis Sullivan was just too much
to overcome, although the In
dians were leading at half time
1-0.
The coaches are confident that
next Saturday's contest with San
Francisco State College will see
the Indians cracking the win
column. The Gators will be
strong, but Stanford playing on
their own grounds will have an
advantage. The weekend sche
dule is as follows:
