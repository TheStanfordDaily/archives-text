# Both Constitutions Rejected
## 
### 
Results from the 1480 votes
cast in Monday's and Tuesday's
election reveal that the present
Constitution will remain in ef
fect. Neither the proposed new
ASSU Constitution nor the con
stitution offered by the Commit
tee for Student Responsibility
received the necessary two
thirds majority of the votes cast.
These results are tentative
pending receipt of overseas bal
lots. A 3 to 1 majority overseas
for the ASSU Constitution will
give it the necessary quota.
Results from the 450 persons
attending the overseas campuses

will not be available for ten to
fifteen days. The ballots have to
be mailed over and the election
has to be held before the results
can be cabled.
Passed by large majorities
were the Committee of Fifteen's
proposals and the support of the
grape boycott. The proposed by
law regarding the Hare System
method of voting will go into
effect only if the ASSU Consti
tution is eventually passed.
A complete analysis of the
voting will appear in Thursday's
DAILY.
