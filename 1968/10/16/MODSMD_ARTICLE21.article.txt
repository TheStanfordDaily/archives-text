# H.E.W. Official Discusses Problems Of Birth Control
## 
### 
Federal government birth con
trol policies were discussed by
1 )r. P'hilip R. Lee, the U.S. As
sistant Secretary of Health, Ed
ucation, and Welfare (HEW),
and members of the Stanford
Population and Environment
Forum on Monday night.
Dr. Lee worked as an internist
for ten years in Palo Alto. In
harge of the "health" depart
ment of HEW, he has a budget
of over $10 billion and directs
over 45,0(30 people. Among his
responsibilities are Medicare, the
Federal Drug Exchange, and all
public health services. He has
five children.
Dr. Leo began by reviewing
the evils inherent in the popula
tion explosion: malnutrition,
poverty, pollution, exploitation
of national resources, and urban
migration. "It is not sheer num
bers we fear," he said, but "the
destruction of the quality of hu
man life."

Dr. Lee outlined the develop
ment of U.S. Government poli
cies toward family planning. In
1959, Eisenhower's comment was
that it is "not our business."
Since that time government con
cern and Congressional support
have increased greatly. This con
cern was displayed first through
the financing of research, then
in the provision of information
on family planning. Finally,
with the Child Health Act of
19(77, the provision of services
was authorized.
Governmental family planning
policy, Dr. Lee said, is based on
"equality of opportunity and
freedom of choice." He quoted
Secretary General of the U.N.,
U Thant, saying "the family is
the fundamental unit of human
society," but also that "aware
ness of an accessibility to birth
control services is a basic hu
man right." The U.S. Govern
ment's policy is to make birth
control available to everyone,
but not to force its use.
Dr. Lee went on to discuss the
problem of population control.
"Family planning is not synony
mous with population control,"
he said, and any birth control
measures taken now will not be
effective for at least a genera
tion, until there are fewer wom
en of child-bearing age.
Our economic policies, at the
present time are far more im
portant than family planning.
Economic developments, Lee ex
plained, inhibit fertility. With in

creased security and education,
and as the cost of child rearing
rises, the birth rate drops.
Dr. Lee pointed out the dan
gers of "crash government pro
grams," which might entail the
loss of freedoms. "The issues
must be thoroughly debated," he
said.
During the question period,
Biology Professor Paul Ehrlich,
author of The Population Bomb,
objected to Dr. Lee's view of
freedom. He questioned the
amount of liberty we will have
when we have no room to live,
and advocated more immediate
and forceful action.
Dr. Lee was also asked wheth
er he was aware of the black
militant position that direction
of birth control services to low
income families was an attempt
at genocide. Dr. Lee said that
he was aware of this position.
"I am sure that it is the men
who are making these state
ments," he commented.
When provided to low income
areas, the services were utilized
in nine out of ten cases. He said
that the government is only pro
viding the people with the free
dom of choice and access to
those services which upper and
middle-class women can afford.
Congressman Paul N. McClos
key will be the third speaker for
the Population and Environment
Forum. He will discuss "Propo
sals for Legislative Action" on
Monday, at 8 p.m. in Tresidder
Lounge.
