# The 						Sequoia Will Rise Again
## 
### LYNNE McCALLISTER 
The Sequoia, Stanford's liter
ary magaine, has been recreated.
Founded in 1892, the Sequoia
is nationally known. It was cre
ated to publish student poetry
and short stories. The year be
fore last the Sequoia put out two
issues. The spring issue, how
ever, came back from the print
er's after the end of school and
was never sold. The magazine
went out of business. The Se
quoia has now come back with
a new editorial board and a new
philosophy.
During the summer Steve La
vine, a Stanford senior In the
English Honors program, talked
to the Publications Board about
restarting the Sequoia. He was
appointed editor.
Lavine had been on the edito
rial board of The Workshop, a
small literary magaine started,
he said, as "a revolt against the
Sequoia as it become more and
more cliquish." He said that al
though the old Sequoia had had
excellent writing, the material
had "lacked connections with
reality."
Steve Lavine is a member of
the Tresidder Cultural Arts
Board and was a sponsor last
year in Wilbur Hall. He writes
poetry and prose, and is interest
ed in eighteenth century litera
ture and contemporary poetry.
Next year he hopes to go to
Merton College, Oxford for an
other B.A. in English.
The new Sequoia board con
sists mostly of members of the
old Workshop. Among its mem
bers are Robert Barrett, Steve
Worley, Eric Anderson, and Mar
ianne Gabel. Staff members are
still needed to fill a variety of
positions. Lavine said that the
organization has "an informal
structure, with each person do
ing what he wants."
"Our policy," Lavine said, "is
to print what's new in poetry
and prose." He also wants to
"give Stanford undergrads a
place to publish their first
works in a recognized maga
zine."
Sequoia's faculty advisor is

Wilfred Stone, a distinguished
critic and a member of the En
glish department.
Although the Sequoia intends
to publish mainly student work,
many published writers have re
sponded to the editor's request
for material. For example, So
tere Torregian, one of the lead
ing surrealist poets in the coun
try, is now living in Palo Alto
and has submitted poems. Other
contributors include David Igna
tow, James Tate, Lewish Warsh,
Phillip Hey, Randy Kirshner,
and Anne Waldman, all pub
lished poets.
"Motorcycle poetry," written
by a member of the East Cam
bridge Ostrogoths, will appear
in the next issue. The editor
met A. T. Hunn (Atila the) in
a barroom brawl in Cambridge,
Mass. This issue will also in
clude translations of Vietnamese
Buddhist poems written between
the twelfth century and the
present. These poems were sent
in by the Asian Society.
Lack of Funds
The Sequoia, however, has a
serious lack of funds. The ASSU
has provided $400 for the year
and the Creative Writing De
partment has contributed $200.
The magazine costs $750 an is
sue to publish and its board
hopes to put out three issues.
They are dependent for the rest
of their funds on contributions,
ads, subscriptions and sales.
"Stanford undergrads seem to
have no cultural focus," Lavine
said. The Sequoia hopes to pro
vide this focus. The Jonnie
Scott poetry reading was the
first of an Art Series co-spon
sored by the Sequoia and the
Tresidder Union Board.
Scott, an angry black poet,
read his poems with an accom
paniment of congas, saxaphone,
and flute. On Oct. 23, the Mari
bor String Quartet, a group of
Stanford students, will perform.
The Sequoia plans to present
other such programs, including
poetry readings by Wendell
Berry and James Tate, an inter
pretive dance concert, and a stu
dent art show.

Christopher Pope is in charge
of the Sequoia Arts Series. The
purpose of this series is to "give
Stanford students a chance to
perform publlcally and to build

an audience."
The Sequoia is now in the
process of selecting and editing
material. The first Issue will
come out Nov. 20.

still needed to fill a variety of
positions. Lavine said that the
organization has "an informal
structure, with each person do
ing what he wants."
"Our policy," Lavine said, "is
to print what's new in poetry
and prose." He also wants to
"give Stanford undergrads a
place to publish their first
works in a recognized maga
zine."
Sequoia's faculty advisor is

Wilfred Stone, a distinguished
critic and a member of the En

Although the Sequoia intends
to publish mainly student work,
many published writers have re
sponded to the editor's request
for material. For example, So
tere Torregian, one of the lead
ing surrealist poets in the coun
try, is now living in Palo Alto
and has submitted poems. Other
contributors include David Igna
tow, James Tate, Lewish Warsh,
Phillip Hey, Randy Kirshner,
and Anne Waldman, all pub
lished poets.
"Motorcycle poetry," written
by a member of the East Cam
bridge Ostrogoths, will appear
in the next issue. The editor
met A. T. Hunn (Atila the) in
a barroom brawl in Cambridge,
Mass. This issue will also in
clude translations of Vietnamese
Buddhist poems written between
the twelfth century and the
present. These poems were sent
in by the Asian Society.
Lack of Funds
The Sequoia, however, has a
serious lack of funds. The ASSU
has provided $400 for the year
and the Creative Writing De
partment has contributed $200.
The magazine costs $750 an is
sue to publish and its board
hopes to put out three issues.
They are dependent for the rest
of their funds on contributions,
ads, subscriptions and sales.
"Stanford undergrads seem to
have no cultural focus," Lavine
said. The Sequoia hopes to pro
vide this focus. The Jonnie
Scott poetry reading was the
first of an Art Series co-spon
sored by the Sequoia and the
Tresidder Union Board.
Scott, an angry black poet,
read his poems with an accom
paniment of congas, saxaphone,
and flute. On Oct. 23, the Mari
bor String Quartet, a group of
Stanford students, will perform.
The Sequoia plans to present
other such programs, including
poetry readings by Wendell
Berry and James Tate, an inter
pretive dance concert, and a stu
dent art show.

Christopher Pope is in charge
of the Sequoia Arts Series. The
purpose of this series is to "give
Stanford students a chance to
perform publlcally and to build

an audience."
The Sequoia is now in the
process of selecting and editing
material. The first Issue will
come out Nov. 20.
The Sequoia, Stanford's liter
ary magaine, has been recreated.
Founded in 1892, the Sequoia
is nationally known. It was cre
ated to publish student poetry
and short stories. The year be
fore last the Sequoia put out two
issues. The spring issue, how
ever, came back from the print
er's after the end of school and
was never sold. The magazine
went out of business. The Se
quoia has now come back with
a new editorial board and a new
philosophy.
During the summer Steve La
vine, a Stanford senior In the
English Honors program, talked
to the Publications Board about
restarting the Sequoia. He was
appointed editor.
Lavine had been on the edito
rial board of The Workshop, a
small literary magaine started,
he said, as "a revolt against the
Sequoia as it become more and
more cliquish." He said that al
though the old Sequoia had had
excellent writing, the material
had "lacked connections with
reality."
Steve Lavine is a member of
the Tresidder Cultural Arts
Board and was a sponsor last
year in Wilbur Hall. He writes
poetry and prose, and is interest
ed in eighteenth century litera
ture and contemporary poetry.
Next year he hopes to go to
Merton College, Oxford for an
other B.A. in English.

"Stanford undergrads seem to
have no cultural focus," Lavine
said. The Sequoia hopes to pro
vide this focus. The Jonnie
Scott poetry reading was the
first of an Art Series co-spon
sored by the Sequoia and the
Tresidder Union Board.
Scott, an angry black poet,
read his poems with an accom
paniment of congas, saxaphone,
and flute. On Oct. 23, the Mari
bor String Quartet, a group of
Stanford students, will perform.
The Sequoia plans to present
other such programs, including
poetry readings by Wendell
Berry and James Tate, an inter
pretive dance concert, and a stu
dent art show.

Christopher Pope is in charge
of the Sequoia Arts Series. The
purpose of this series is to "give
Stanford students a chance to
perform publlcally and to build

an audience."
The Sequoia is now in the
process of selecting and editing
material. The first Issue will
come out Nov. 20.
