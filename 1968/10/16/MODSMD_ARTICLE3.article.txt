# No 'Gaities'
## Drama Review Folds News Analysis 
### DIARMUD McGUIRE HUGH WONG 
There won't be any Gaities at
Stanford this fall. Ram's Head's
traditional fall revue appears to
have fallen victim to the under
graduate theatrical organiza
tion's internal weaknesses. But
the demise of Gaities has also
brought a misunderstanding
with serious racial implications
to the campus.
Johnie Scott, already a writer
and poet of national reputation,
spent the summer writing a
script for the autumn show. At
the beginning of this quarter the
Ram's Head board decided not
to produce his or any other Gai
ties this year.
Scott is extremely bitter. (See
"The Bad Mouth" page 2.) For
one thing, it appears that he was
not directly informed of the de
cision for some time after it was
made.
Contract
He was working under con
tract and will be paid for his un
produced script. But money was
not Scott's central concern.
The show which he wrote
would have centered around the
conflicts of a black undergrad
uate at Stanford — a black boy
who saw his best friend shot
down in the streets of Watts
and then wound up in the land
of fraternities and the Big Game.
The cast would have been pre
dominantly black.
Scott's Gaities was evidently
too strong for some members of
Ram's Head to swallow, and
there were several resignations
from the organization during the
summer.
A Tradition
One problem was the fact that
Gaities was a tradition, and
Scott's script was far from tra
ditional. As Coco Pratt, who was
originally scheduled to produce
the show, said yesterday,"I felt
I could not produce anything as
different as this."
But beyond that, interest in
Ram's Head seems to have been
declining steadily for the past
several years. The organization
has had particular difficulty at
tracting people to design and
build sets, arrange lighting and
handle the many technical prob
lems involved in a theatrical
production.
Kathy Williams, president of
Ram's Head, told the Daily yes
terday that the show died of a
shortage of technicians, among
other things. Personal conflicts
within the organization appar
ently added to the problem.
Bob Fletcher, who would have

been director of the 1968 Gaities,
blames the problem on the fact
that he did not have adequate
authority over the crew. "I, as
director, did not have the power
I wished to have," he .said rec
ently. "The director must have
full artistic control over the
show."
In any case Johnie Scott is
left with an unproduced script—
everyone who has read it agrees
that it is very good—and a con
viction that racism runs very
deep at Stanford.
"Don't ever 'ask' a black man
for the 'Truth' as though you
can handle it—no, don't do that

and then have that black slapped
in the face. . ." Scott writes in
today's column.
Scott predicts that people will
blame the absence of a Gaities
on him. He writes that he ex
pects to hoar "how Johnie Scott
made a whole lot of enemies
when he let the people know
that it was because of Him, His
Script, that there won't be a
Gaities this time . . ."
But, he implies, it is because
he did not produce a "Black
Oklahoma" or a "Black Follies"
that Ram's Head did not stage
his work.
Rumor
Members of the Ram's Head
board seemed to regret particu
larly the fact that Scott heard

of their decision only by rumor.
"I don't know why nobody
called Johnie," said Mrs. Wil
liams. "We may have been a bit
afraid to tell him. There were
about three people who might
have called him, and each one
hoped the other might do it."
"Johnie's show would have
been a great success," said the
Ram's Head president. "It would
have brought in people who are
really interested in what's hap
pening."
Finincial Crisis
"We wanted so much to do it.
Having to face the fact that
there won't be any Gaities is
very difficult."
In addition to their personal
disappointment, the members of
Ram's Head have to contend
with a financial crisis. The or
ganization is already several
thousand dollars in debt, with
no source of income this fall.
Another problem was the fact
that, aside from the script, the
fall Gaities was far behind
schedule by the beginning of the
quarter. No music had been
written for Scott's lyrics, and no
stage could be reserved until
early in November.
But the real loser is the Stan
ford community, which might
have been exposed to an original
and relevant musical drama this
year. There is a possibility that
Scott's script will be produced
by a San Francisco theater
group in the spring. But Stan
ford has almost certainly lost its
chance.

different as this."
But beyond that, interest in
Ram's Head seems to have been
declining steadily for the past
several years. The organization
has had particular difficulty at
tracting people to design and
build sets, arrange lighting and
handle the many technical prob
lems involved in a theatrical
production.
Kathy Williams, president of
Ram's Head, told the Daily yes
terday that the show died of a
shortage of technicians, among
other things. Personal conflicts
within the organization appar
ently added to the problem.
Bob Fletcher, who would have

been director of the 1968 Gaities,
blames the problem on the fact
that he did not have adequate
authority over the crew. "I, as
director, did not have the power
I wished to have," he .said rec
ently. "The director must have
full artistic control over the
show."
In any case Johnie Scott is
left with an unproduced script—
everyone who has read it agrees
that it is very good—and a con
viction that racism runs very
deep at Stanford.
"Don't ever 'ask' a black man
for the 'Truth' as though you
can handle it—no, don't do that

and then have that black slapped
in the face. . ." Scott writes in
today's column.
Scott predicts that people will
blame the absence of a Gaities
on him. He writes that he ex
pects to hoar "how Johnie Scott
made a whole lot of enemies
when he let the people know
that it was because of Him, His
Script, that there won't be a
Gaities this time . . ."
But, he implies, it is because
he did not produce a "Black
Oklahoma" or a "Black Follies"
that Ram's Head did not stage
his work.
Rumor
Members of the Ram's Head
board seemed to regret particu
larly the fact that Scott heard

of their decision only by rumor.
"I don't know why nobody
called Johnie," said Mrs. Wil
liams. "We may have been a bit
afraid to tell him. There were
about three people who might
have called him, and each one
hoped the other might do it."
"Johnie's show would have
been a great success," said the
Ram's Head president. "It would
have brought in people who are
really interested in what's hap
pening."
Finincial Crisis
"We wanted so much to do it.
Having to face the fact that
there won't be any Gaities is
very difficult."
In addition to their personal
disappointment, the members of
Ram's Head have to contend
with a financial crisis. The or
ganization is already several
thousand dollars in debt, with
no source of income this fall.
Another problem was the fact
that, aside from the script, the
fall Gaities was far behind
schedule by the beginning of the
quarter. No music had been
written for Scott's lyrics, and no
stage could be reserved until
early in November.
But the real loser is the Stan
ford community, which might
have been exposed to an original
and relevant musical drama this
year. There is a possibility that
Scott's script will be produced
by a San Francisco theater
group in the spring. But Stan
ford has almost certainly lost its
chance.
There won't be any Gaities at
Stanford this fall. Ram's Head's
traditional fall revue appears to
have fallen victim to the under
graduate theatrical organiza
tion's internal weaknesses. But
the demise of Gaities has also
brought a misunderstanding
with serious racial implications
to the campus.
Johnie Scott, already a writer
and poet of national reputation,
spent the summer writing a
script for the autumn show. At
the beginning of this quarter the
Ram's Head board decided not
to produce his or any other Gai
ties this year.
Scott is extremely bitter. (See
"The Bad Mouth" page 2.) For
one thing, it appears that he was
not directly informed of the de
cision for some time after it was
made.
Contract
He was working under con
tract and will be paid for his un
produced script. But money was
not Scott's central concern.
The show which he wrote
would have centered around the
conflicts of a black undergrad
uate at Stanford — a black boy
who saw his best friend shot
down in the streets of Watts
and then wound up in the land
of fraternities and the Big Game.
The cast would have been pre
dominantly black.
Scott's Gaities was evidently
too strong for some members of
Ram's Head to swallow, and
there were several resignations
from the organization during the
summer.
A Tradition
One problem was the fact that
Gaities was a tradition, and
Scott's script was far from tra
ditional. As Coco Pratt, who was
originally scheduled to produce
the show, said yesterday,"I felt
I could not produce anything as
different as this."

he did not produce a "Black
Oklahoma" or a "Black Follies"
that Ram's Head did not stage
his work.
Rumor
Members of the Ram's Head
board seemed to regret particu
larly the fact that Scott heard

of their decision only by rumor.
"I don't know why nobody
called Johnie," said Mrs. Wil
liams. "We may have been a bit
afraid to tell him. There were
about three people who might
have called him, and each one
hoped the other might do it."
"Johnie's show would have
been a great success," said the
Ram's Head president. "It would
have brought in people who are
really interested in what's hap
pening."
Finincial Crisis
"We wanted so much to do it.
Having to face the fact that
there won't be any Gaities is
very difficult."
In addition to their personal
disappointment, the members of
Ram's Head have to contend
with a financial crisis. The or
ganization is already several
thousand dollars in debt, with
no source of income this fall.
Another problem was the fact
that, aside from the script, the
fall Gaities was far behind
schedule by the beginning of the
quarter. No music had been
written for Scott's lyrics, and no
stage could be reserved until
early in November.
But the real loser is the Stan
ford community, which might
have been exposed to an original
and relevant musical drama this
year. There is a possibility that
Scott's script will be produced
by a San Francisco theater
group in the spring. But Stan
ford has almost certainly lost its
chance.
There won't be any Gaities at
Stanford this fall. Ram's Head's
traditional fall revue appears to
have fallen victim to the under
graduate theatrical organiza
tion's internal weaknesses. But
the demise of Gaities has also
brought a misunderstanding
with serious racial implications
to the campus.
Johnie Scott, already a writer
and poet of national reputation,
spent the summer writing a
script for the autumn show. At
the beginning of this quarter the
Ram's Head board decided not
to produce his or any other Gai
ties this year.
Scott is extremely bitter. (See
"The Bad Mouth" page 2.) For
one thing, it appears that he was
not directly informed of the de
cision for some time after it was
made.
Contract
He was working under con
tract and will be paid for his un
produced script. But money was
not Scott's central concern.
The show which he wrote
would have centered around the
conflicts of a black undergrad
uate at Stanford — a black boy
who saw his best friend shot
down in the streets of Watts
and then wound up in the land
of fraternities and the Big Game.
The cast would have been pre
dominantly black.
Scott's Gaities was evidently
too strong for some members of
Ram's Head to swallow, and
there were several resignations
from the organization during the
summer.
A Tradition
One problem was the fact that
Gaities was a tradition, and
Scott's script was far from tra
ditional. As Coco Pratt, who was
originally scheduled to produce
the show, said yesterday,"I felt
I could not produce anything as
different as this."
But beyond that, interest in
Ram's Head seems to have been
declining steadily for the past
several years. The organization
has had particular difficulty at
tracting people to design and
build sets, arrange lighting and
handle the many technical prob
lems involved in a theatrical
production.
Kathy Williams, president of
Ram's Head, told the Daily yes
terday that the show died of a
shortage of technicians, among
other things. Personal conflicts
within the organization appar
ently added to the problem.
Bob Fletcher, who would have

been director of the 1968 Gaities,
blames the problem on the fact
that he did not have adequate
authority over the crew. "I, as
director, did not have the power
I wished to have," he .said rec
ently. "The director must have
full artistic control over the
show."
In any case Johnie Scott is
left with an unproduced script—
everyone who has read it agrees
that it is very good—and a con
viction that racism runs very
deep at Stanford.
"Don't ever 'ask' a black man
for the 'Truth' as though you
can handle it—no, don't do that

and then have that black slapped
in the face. . ." Scott writes in
today's column.
Scott predicts that people will
blame the absence of a Gaities
on him. He writes that he ex
pects to hoar "how Johnie Scott
made a whole lot of enemies
when he let the people know
that it was because of Him, His
Script, that there won't be a
Gaities this time . . ."
