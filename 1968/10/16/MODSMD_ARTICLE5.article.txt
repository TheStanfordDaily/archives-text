# Germany XX Schedules Counter-Orientation Forum
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
The overseas campus pro
gram, an experience shared by
more than half of the Stan
ford student body, has come in
for its share of praise and criti
cism over the ten years since
its inception.
This week a number of stu
dents who attended the German
campus last winter and spring
quarters began a "counter
orientation program" for those
students leaving for same cam
pus this January. The group
hopes to acquaint students with
"how it is" and "how it could
be."
Last spring Stanford-in-
Germany Group XX adopted a
new student constitution call
ing for more flexibility in what
they found to be "a very ritual
ized and over-centralized over
seas campus program."
Members of that group hope
to bring Stanford-in-Germany
Group XXII to "the same
awareness that Group XX fi
nally reached after being in

Germany for five months," says
junior Geoff White.
At the same time, White, who
was Group XX's male judicial
representative, is quick to point
out that the Landgut Burg cam
pus alumni don't want to make
their program a "negative thing
that might discourage students
from attending an overseas cam
pus."
Central to the group's list of
suggested changes is a call for
tion."
"We take the initiative in
defining our roles as stu
dents . . reads the adopted
constitution. "We recognize our
right to make our own social
regulations and to work with
professors in designing new
programs of study."
Unused Options
Some of the group's recom
mendations were incorporated
by Academic Director Herr Hut
schneider. But the students
maintain that each overseas
campus needs to be "considered
a unique and largely indepen
dent unit" before additional
changes can take place.

"Our experience with the
Overseas Campus Office shows
that it proceeds, and is pro
ceeding, with token changes,"
charges Will Hobbs, one of the
organizers of the counter
orientation sessions.
There are options within the
overseas campus program that
are not currently utilized by the
German campus, says White.
"Without changing the letter of
the law, you can change the real
ity of the situation," he says.
Discrepancy
Past groups have seen a dis
crepancy in what the program
is and what it was made out to
be in the orientation sessions.
For Group XX! it was "the
discrepancy between what was
there and what it could have
been,"says White.
Included in the constitution
was a resolution calling for a
German language program "ful
ly integrated, aiming at enab
ling the student to speak, read,
and write contemporary Ger
man."

Group XX feds it is essential
that such a program "be in
tensely conversational at the
beginning, supplying the student
with useful words and idioms
and with the opportunity to
speak as much as possible with
othir students an-! with the in
structor."
It was a judicial controversy
during the last month of their
stay in Germany that ultimately
prompted the group's action.
White refers to his experience
"not really what we expected it
to be. We were liaisons between
the director of the campus and
the students."
Justify Regulations
As cases arose in the group
and the judicial council was
placed in a position of justifying
the regulations, White admits
that he reached a point where
he "couldn't punish students
anymore."
Returnees from the four other
Stanford overseas campuses
have indicated interest in car
rying out similar counter
orientation sessions.
