# The 						Bad Mouth — A Column

### JOHNIE SCOTT 
If Stanford University plans
to (and it already has) organize
student dissent and disenchant
ment with the inequites and
hypocrisies of a basically racist
institution, then all I can say
is that Messrs. Pitzer, Lyman
and Co. had best be together
when the time comes to meet
the truth.
Not to leave anyone of you
hanging by that fragile com
modity, "the truth," allow me
to introduce into the columns
of the Stanford Daily a poem
by white Southerner John
Beecher (a man I personally
consider one of the most insight
ful human beings in this white
man's country).
"A DIXIE HERO."
"Ole Raymond seed this black
boy comin long the walk an
didn' lahk his looks ho he retch
down and grab a gre't big rock
an stove damn nigguh's head
in faw him. Nevah seed so
comical a thang sence Ah been
bawn.
Ole Raymond bust a hole big
as a half a dollar spang in
his fo'head. Cain't kill no nig
ger thataway. They skulls Ls
bone clean th'oo. Well, Raymon
got th'owed outa school. Shit,
not faw that. He cussed the
principal."
The truth, Dear Sirs, is that

right here, not in Viet Nam,
but right here at Stanford and
a million other strongholds of
white power, is where genocide
is being waged against the col
ored people of this world.
(Moreover, You People Know
This, you only hang back to see
if others know, if the word is
yet being spread to the masses,
if Malcolm X is truly dead, or
whether people have yet stirred
from their guilt complexes to
understand the murder of Rev
erend King).
How is this genocide being
waged? It is being waged in any
number of forms—a credit to
the sophistication of modern
day warfare. These forms range
from cultural strangulation to
political castration.
The Big Game for instance.
I'm waiting to hear what re
ports will be made official on
this year's pre-Game festivities
and Gaities. Like, "How Johnie
Scott made a whole lot of ene
mies when he let the people
know that it was because of
Him, His Script, that there won't
be a Gaities this time for what
might be the best year ever for
Stanford that way!"
Like how it was that he—like
a whole lotta students who did
n't go to any Stanford Games—
not all the time they were here
—how this black man sat down

to write a script for Gaities that
was not a "Black Oklahoma," or
a "Black Follies," or even a
classic post-Leßoi Jonesian
statement on the nature of Stan
ford theater. . . .
Simply, very simply, how that
script, before it was even writ
ten, before Scott had even been
picked to write the damn thing,
had inspired the rationalized
resignations of certain members
of the Ramshead Board. How
durng the summer when the
story was beng released, more
of this youthful Establishment
withdrew, and of how, at quar
ter's beginning, the liberated
actors and directors of this
group quietly voted not only to
not do Scott's script, but against
doing anything at all with Gai
ties this year.
Now, for the reasons why.
The Bad Mouth was "out" on
what transpired at the meeting
of Ramshead during the first
week of this fall quarter. Among
the statements floating through
the room—"Why, this play is
racist and immoral," "Uh, uh,
you know we can't have a play
that has more Blacks in it than
whites!"
A little more? —Ask the peo
ple from Ramshead, all of
them good-intentioned, well
meaning people all of whom
were sick at the decision by the

Board not to do the script
(somehow forgot that "They"
were the Board).
Ask the people there, who
came up later wanting to do this
particular script "in the spring,
with the Speech and Drama
Dept., we're certain we can do
it then for the serious drama
that it could be."
What was the Bad Mouth on
these people? Simply this—
don't come to me with your
patronizing lilywhite attitudes/
faces talking of "serious" drama
when you and I both know what
the real story, the real prob
lems were.
Don't talk to me quietly of
being sorry that it (the play)
didn't happen when the truth
of the matter is that once paper
entered the typewriter said play

was doomed (the play?—a
movement from slum world to
Stanford, from poverty to the
Big Game, and what that means,
from the other side of the
tracks . . . this, all done with as
little profanity as possible, ac
cording to the censors).
Don't ever "ask" a black man
for the"Truth" as though you
can handle it—no, don't do that
and then have that black slapped
in the face (I wrote the play
because no blacks had ever writ
ten a Gaities, because it would
be interesting to see if the Sys
tem could absorb any and all
life-styles, especially those of its
students).
Don't talk about genocide in
Viet Nam when the truth is that
"genocide" is being waged here
in the form of a one-way front
ing-off of the black psyche with
white quasi-Victorian postures
of moral indignation when the
facts are that certain black peo
ple did not choose to "confess"
their lives, or please these self
flagellating white psyches with
condemnations of the "liberal"
people (whoever they are, or
used to be).
When black art, which is
black life, cannot enter the Sys
tem normally, then it is left
with precious few alternatives.
It can die, on the outside, rag
ing against "the White Man." It
can wither, like a tubercloid, as
if the fault was it own.
Or, the black psyche can look
at the needle which was sup
posed to inject it into the Sys
tem, along with the hand that
would have been pressing down
on that needle—and see where
the needle's point was blunt, un
able to pierce any skin, and
where that hand belonged to a
man who would never know
ingly take something into his
System that might break the
routine.
Stanford University, like "Ole
Raymond's school principal," is
a dope addict. It will shoot her
oin into its bloodstream for that
druggy high. It will shoot
"speed" into its system for that
spaced-out feeling. It will do all
of this in the dark, where no
body can see what is happening.
Then, come out talking of a
"melting-pot" and "tolerance for
others" and "law and order is

necessary" and "George Wallace
is bad medicine" like a Logic
prof I know whose examples
many times revolve about the
theme of "Tricky Dick Nixon's
upcoming presupposed victory
in November."
And the coldest thing about
all of this is that I ain't sorry.
Not for anything. Black people
have revolted, anyway, our revo
lution being an asking into the
system (that's what integration
is all about.) But it don't go
down that way, and it never has.
So what am I saying, and what
am I going to do?
I really can't say anything,
outside of the fact that I am go
ing to point out each and every
time it happens this year (or as
long as I am left with a column
—you know the Administration
has a funny way of silencing
certain voices and editing cer
tain observations) I am going to
point out those demonstrated in
stances of racism" right here"
in this country, on this campus,
what is happening, and why.
"In the brightest day,
In the blackest night,
No evil shall escape my sight.
Let those who worship evil's
might,
Beware of my power,
Green Lantern's light!"
I can't really do anything, ex
cept try and find out how many
forms of resistance white folks
have to facirg truth—which can
be black art, or hitting nigguh's
in the head with rocks, or find
ing black people dead castrated
on lonely highways—this hap
pening in the year of Our Lord
1968—then walking into some

body's class to be told that for
a little while let me lay my
concerns to the side and get my
Academics together.
I am left with precious few
alternatives, as I said, so that
it seems as tho the most logical
course for me at the present
would be to delve into the Amer
ican Way ... of Whatever.
Do I expect a reply from
Ramshead, by the way? Truth
fully, no, for I got my informa
tion about their little deal via
the grapevine and a long time
after their vote agnbist had
gone thru.
I say that if they, their orga
nization, for example, can't deal
with heavy people or heavy sub
jects, then they should stay
away from the likes of me. I
don't care to be running cry
ing to the Administration about
how some small band of honkies
messed over me.
Beside, President Pitzer is too
busy with other things—like re
trieving lost Federal contracts.
