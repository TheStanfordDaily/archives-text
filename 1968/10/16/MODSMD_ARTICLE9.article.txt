### PAUL RUPERT 
On more than one occasion we
have been called a nation of
sheep. While that description is
meant to be characterological,
last spring an alarmed citizenry
learned that as the victims of a
nerve gas attack, men and sheep
are also biologically equal.
To shepherds near the U.S.
Army's Dugway Proving
Grounds in Utah, the discovery
of six thousand dead sheep came
as a surprise indeed: even they
did not take warnings about the
danger of grass that seriously.
So they looked to other causes.
This led them to the U.S. Army,
which tests nerve gas at Dug
way.
In what has become a common
event, the Army tried to pull the
wool over their eyes, denying
that tests had occurred or that
any gas could have escaped.
To make a long lie a short
truth, the Army finally con
fessed quietly and paid off the
shepherds. But then Seymour
Hersh, a student of chemical and
biological warfare (CBW) re
search and production, visited
the area to find out exactly what
had happened.
I was sitting in a funky audi
torium in Manhattan, Kansas,
this summer when he laid the
story out. He explained how a
nozzle mal-functioned, an enor
mous cloud of red-tinted gas es
caped, and a band of petrified
monitors watched it waft away
toward Salt Lake City.
Phone calls were made to the
Pentagon when it became clear
that the cloud was not dispers
ing. Computers churned out
evacuation plans and the Army
prepared to close off Route 40
as the clcud approached.
Then the cloud hit a warm
front, turned northward and was
washed to the ground in an en
suing rainstorm. Exit the sheep.
And enter the mayor of Salt
Lake City.
Now the mayor is above all a
reasonable man. Hersh asked
him why he didn't protest the
incident, and perhaps ask the
Army to get off Utah soil.
Of course the mayor shared
Hersh's fears of the obliteration
of his city, but he was also aware

that a serious economic disloca
tion could occure if a large em
ployer like the military were to
leave the state. And as he said,
one hoped we would continue to
have the Hand of Providence on
our side.
To Hersh and to any of us who
have made it a point to confront
the military, such a reaction is
all too common. It sounds like
the argument of microbiologist
who explains that if he is to do
any "good work" at all, he must
recognize that the federal gov
ernment pays for most research;
to balk at the CBW part would
mean serious economic disloca
tion.
Or Reverend Loveless of Ta
coma Park, Maryland's Sligo
Adventists Church, which pro
vides C.O.'s who, in the national
interest, expose themselves to
new forms of plague and anth
rax and other fatal diseases at
Fort Detrick, Maryland. He ex
plains that "we like to look at
ourselves as conscientious co-op
erators, not conscientious objec
tors." He adds that if his church
stopped providing C.O.'s for this
specific kind of work, then their
preferred status with local draft
boards could soon disappear.
Or research institutes like SRI,
which has large standing con
tracts for developing dispersal
systems, projecting dispersal
patterns, and monitoring tests at
Dugway itself: would it argue
that it does not like the work,
but that the military provides
much of its research money?
Or would Trustee William
Hewlitt, who is a director of
FMC Corp. in San Jose, contend
that FMC would cause economic
dislccations if it closed down its
plant in Newport, Indiana, where
the nerve gas "VX" is made.
All these arguments sound
quite reasonable. They are the
arguments of men who are
caught in a position where every
move is a bad move. There are
no good alternatives.
But one has somehow to es
tablish priorities, to understand
where the greatest dangers lie.
At the very least each of us
ought to know the gases that
await us. Being in the midst of
one of the country's military re
search strongholds, we have a
unique chance to get to know
the arsenal and perhaps to
question and alter its function.
It's a recent, but accurate tru
ism that those who choose to live
like sheep will all too often die
like them.
