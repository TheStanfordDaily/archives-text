Which Way
To Stereo JK
Value? jst
One way is to buy a "big name" receiver, then
hold down the price with private-brand, "cigar
box" speakers.
But speakers do the actual changing of electricity
to sound, and if they're not tops, neither will your
sound be.
The other way to stereo value is with top-quality
speakers and Lafayette's own fine receivers.
Hear this at Lafayette: our LR-500T 60-watt solid
state AM-FM Stereo receiver, Garrard changer with
Empire or Shure cartridge (diamond needle, of
course) and base, and two KLH Twenty-two or AR
4x acoustic suspension speaker systems.
