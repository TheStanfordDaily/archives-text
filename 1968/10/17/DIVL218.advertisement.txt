We call it Easymatic-you'll call it terrific! It's Sony's new solid-state, Easy
matic CassetteCorder, a whole new idea in tape recording. Simply snap in the
Sony tape Cassette cartridge, no tape threading-press a button, and you're
ready for business-or pleasure. Nothing could be easier. The Sony Cassette

easy for you.
