# freshman's father circling earth in Apollo 7

### JENNY MATTHEWS 
Eighteen-year-old Wally of the
second floor in Trancos doesn't
usually introduce himself by his
last name, and if asked, will
simply say that his father works
for NASA.
Wally is a freshman, has
glowing red hair, likes his West
ern Civ. instructor, and works
out calculus problems with the
other guys in Trancos. But since
last Friday, Wally has been fol
lowing the progress of his dad's
eleven-day flight through space.
Wally's last name is Schirra and
his dad is Captain Walter M.
Schirra Jr. of the Navy, Com
mander of Apollo 7.
This is the third time Wally
has seen his father rocket into
space, the first time being in an
October 1964 Mercury flight,
followed by a December 1965
Gemini flight, and he admits
feeling "more proud, than
scared."
"It has to be done," says
Wally about Capt. Schirra's
space travels, "I think we ought

to explore the moon for, well,
things like, mineral deposits. I
don't think it will give us a
solution for an overflow of pop
ulation, but there are great op
portunities for technological ad-

vances . . . and a lot better
working conditions there."
Wally describes the people
working on the Space Program
as "one big happy family," but
admits that his father's work
often disrupts the life of his

immediate family including his
mother ?.nd 11-year-old sister,
Suzanne. "Last year, my dad
was only home about fifty
days."
One effect the space program

has had on the Schirra family,
is, as Wally says, "we've hart
to move everywhere." He con
tinues, "we've lived in Texas
the longest . . . but I was born
in Rhode Island, I've lived in
three different places in Califor

nia. . . I had three fourth grade
classes â€”or maybe even four."
Wally is interested in science,
but prefers biology to physics
and other nelds of exploration.
"I don't really know what the
details are in the space flights,"
he says, "but I like to see what
the orbital plans are for going
to the moon and see how they
land; not just know what the
astronauts are doing but how
they're doing it. But I'm ex
posed to it so much, I guess I'm
just rather disinterested in it.
I like biology a lot more. I'd
probably be interested though in
a course in astronautics."
In addition to biology, Wally
has an informal acquaintance
with drawing. "I draw sort of
wierd things; my own sort of
art, I guess." His favorite way
of decorating his room is using
posters "borrowed from kiosks
and various parts of the
campus."
Wally's very enthusiastic
about sports and is currently
taking judo and tennis to keep

in shape. He is also very inter
ested in football, and he com
mented, "My dad was supposed
to give a plug for the SC game"
from Apollo 7 spacecraft, "but I
have no idea if he did."
When asked about following
his father in a career as an as
tronaut, Wally answers that
he'd really like to, "but I don't
think I will." He believes,
"there's no really set way to be
come an astronaut; all the astro
nauts now have such varied
backgrounds."
Activity last Friday, the day
of lift off for Apollo 7, forced
Wally to miss classes. But in
stead of freeing himself to fol
low the mission's progress, he
laments that he cut classes be
cause "the press kept on bug
ging me." He explains, "I had
En interview at 9:30 in the
morning and I was planning to
go to my calculus class at 10,
but the interview ran overtime,
luy next class was at 2:00, but
they wanted a TV interview at
2 , . He adds, "most of the

questions are repetitious, like,
'How did you feel about the
flight?' and you really can't
answer things like that."
In spite of the number of re
porters that have recently been
following him around on cam
pus, Wally is really enthusiastic
about Stanford.
He feels, like many freshmen,
somewhat isolated on campus.
"I guess homework ties students
down a lot. I'm lost from the
world it seems. A lot of kids
in my dorm didn't even know
the World Series had started
till after the second day. Russia
could have invaded Alaska, and
a lot of us probably wouldn't
have known. There is a lot to
do here, though."
Wally doesn't plan to go home
when his father returns from
the Apollo 7 mission. But when
asked if he regrets missing any
of the action, he replied, "I
don't like the action. I'd rather
be out here where it's half-way
quiet."
