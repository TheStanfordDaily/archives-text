# PRESIDENT GLASER
## 
### 
Last Thursday night, Acting President
Robert Glaser made an unprecedented
appearance at a meeting of the student leg
islature, LASSU. It was the first time in
memory that Stanford's chief executive had
attended and addressed a LASSU meeting.
The following day, Glaser strongly urged
Palo Alto to consider using the Corporation
Yard —leased from Stanford by the city —for
low income housing, supporting demands
made by the Stanford local of the American
Federation of Teachers.
This followed by only a few hours his
support of a full-scale investigation of the
Stanford Research Institute (SRI), prev
iously demanded by Students for a Demo
cratic Society.
Local radicals dismiss these events as in
significant. Glaser's support of an investiga
tion of the University's ties with SRI is
merely a stalling action, they feel.
"Six months for the investigation? one
Peninsula Observer staffer commented. "He
could have one of his assistants turn out a
report in two days. All this is for is to stop
people from saying he's not taking any ac
tion."
And as for the Corporation yard recom

mendation, the activists feel Glaser could
force Palo Alto to put up cheap housing,
and not merely urge that it do so.
But despite these criticisms —which we
feel are excessive—the job Glaser has done
in his three months as acting president is
better than anyone could have expected.
We hope that in his remaining few Weeks
in office President Glaser will continue along
the same lines—speeding the SRI investi
gation, trying to assure low income housing
in the area, and setting out on new paths.
When he assumed the post, he said he
wanted to establish "a more meaningful ex
change between students, faculty, admin
istrators, and trustees." We feel he has
progressed admirably toward his goal.
As an interim president, one could have
expected that Glaser might serve merely as
a liason between the two administrations.
But he had done much more than this.
His genius consists of his desire to respond
quickly to the needs of others in the com
munity. Though it may be said that his
talent is for conciliation, it seems to us that
his concern is honest and his attempts at
compromise are usually just.
We are sorry he must leave the post
December 1. He is an example for Kenneth
Pitzer of what a Stanford president should
be.
