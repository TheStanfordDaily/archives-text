# Dear Mom
## Chemical War At Home 
### CISSIE BONINI 
Dear Mom:
I recently broke up with a boy
whom I shall call P.P. and I
thought my heart had shattered
into thousands of tiny pieces
floating around in my blood
stream. However, I have come
to realize that P.P. lacked cer
tain qualifications (most of
which are possessed by Paul
Newman) and that I had in
digestion from eating toomuch
curry. Anyway his (P.P.'s) in
itials would never have matched

the monogram on my grand
mother's silver. My problem now
is how can I let all those gor
geous hunks know that I am un
attached?
Temporarily grounded,

Dear Wendy:
The solution to your problem
is in being direct and yet subtle.
I suggest that you wear a large
sandwich board around campus,
a direct approach, but inscribe
a subtle message on it. (For ex

ample, "Unattached female with
strong sexual urges desires in
tellectual companion.")
Love,
MOM
Dear Mom:
I am a graduate student wife
and my husband has a bushy
beard with fleas in it. He be
comes very irritated when I
spray him with "Raid." It has
become a real contention be
tween us. And now I am forced
to crouch behind the sofa, leap
out, and squirt him when he
comes home from school. He is
very unreasonable about this
and it is putting a strain on our
marriage. (P.S. He says his vi
sion is affected by the D.D.T.)

Dear Eleanor:
"Raid" does have an unpleas
ant odor. Some newer products
on the market are pine-scented
and — another advantage —
contain a much deadlier insecti
cide, so that it is not necessary
to spray so often.
