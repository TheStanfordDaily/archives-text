## Orbital Draft 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
If the flight of Apollo turns out to be successful, a new dimension
may be added to the question of draft resistance.
Both major party candidates are looking for an alternative to
the present draft programs, but like all true patriots they are
determined to work within the established system — which they
feel has captured and maintained an unflinching grip on the es
sence of democracy.
Informed sources have predicted that in the future American
youths who refuse to be inducted into the armed forces will be
put into orbit for two to five years as an alternative to military
service.
There are two reasons given for this dramatic, but seemingly
rational, policy change. First is the obvious overcrowdedness in
the nation's prisons. With no end to draft protests in sight, the very
presence of thousands of draft-dodgers could be enough to get this
program off the ground.
Second, some of the leaders of the establishment sense that the
reason for the widespread protest these days is a frustrated and
alienated feeling that grips the nation's young people. It is felt
that allowing the dissenters to utilize the very objects they de
plore would be a conciliatory measure and would make the young
people feel more a part of the military-industrial society.
In the words of a top executive, "No longer would the younger
generation be on the outside looking in — they'd be on the inside
looking down."
Avid proponents of this new policy have even gone so far as to
work out a selective service system for draft-dodgers. Orbital flights
would be provided on the basis of a lottery — except in presidential
election years when bearded hecklers would be given top priority.
t)raft card burners would go stand-by.
Once in orbit, they would serve a minimum of two and not more
than five years, with walks in space for good behavior.
Among the candidates for nation offlce there appears to be
mixed feelings about this new proposal. Sources close to Hubert
Humphrey have indicated that he thinks the plan is out of this
world, but top Nixon aides have stated that the former vice presi
dent prefers to wait until he has been elected so that he can take
credit for initiating the policy.
