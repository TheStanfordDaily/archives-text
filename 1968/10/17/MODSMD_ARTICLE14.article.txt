This summer there was a
lot of talk at Stanford about the
guns carried by the Stanford
Police. Are they necessary to
enforce parking tickets? Should
our police give the image of gun
slingers? Can Stanford show the
Bay Area and California how
law can be preserved in a com
munity without guns?
Now is a particularly good
time to ask ourselves about some
of these issues. The emotional
ism of the Kennedy assassina
tion has subsided in most of ur
Likewise we have the larger is
sue of "Law and Order" star
ing at us as a major part of all
three campaigns.
In answer to a letter from
Denis Hayes last July, Stanford
Chief Gordon Davis acknowl
edged the differences between
Stanford and the larger commu
nity. He then noted that 335 law
enforcement officials were killed
in America in the line of duty
between 1960 and 1067. This sta
tistic coupled with others plus
some local examples constituted
the Chief's defense of the pres
ent policy.
The present policy is that all
Stanford policemen in the field
are armed. Not only are the
patrolmen who investigate sus
picious cars at three in the
morning armed, but the man
who puts a parking ticket on
your car during class also car
ries a gun.
It's plain that there can be
situations where a policeman
might need a gun to protect his
life. But how many of those oc
cur at Stanford and how many
of those during daylight?
Captain William Wullschleg
er told me that his men are not
permitted to lse their guns to
stop felons and that there have
been no instances in his eight
year tenure where a Stanford
poilceman has had to pull a gun.
The how much need is there?
We ask if there is some way
we can cut down the number of
guns in our own community.
Chief Davis cited no case where
a policeman needed his gun dur
ing the working hours. At the
very least we are entitled to ask
if those guns are really neces
sary.
In a recent three year period
out of 400,000 criminals arrest
ed in England and Wales only
159 were carrying guns. In 1962
there were 29 murders in En
gland and Wales by gunfire
(with one-fourth the U.S. pop
ulation). There were 37 that
year in Japan (with one-half
the U.S. population) and 4,954
in the U.S.
Maybe we can make a start
at Stanford. Like San Francisco
we can at least have our po
licemen cover their guns with
jackets. Perhaps we could re
quire that they not carry them
during the University work day.
The problem is to achieve a
society that does not have guns
on the mind. The need is ob
vious but the answers are not

so clear. Some major depart
ment stores will not sell toy
guns this Christmas. They
should be commended for this.
Now is the time you should
ask yourself if there is some
thing that we can do right here.
Macy's has already done some
thing. How about us? There
must be a beginning. We have
to make the gun less a part of
American life.
