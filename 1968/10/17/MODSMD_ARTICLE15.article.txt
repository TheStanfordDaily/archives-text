• Deny Bombing Halt

SAIGON (AP) — U.S. Ambas
sador Ellsworth Bunker met
three times Wednesday with
President Nguyen Van Thieu,
and a high Vietnamese official
said they discussed a new U.S.
proposal to halt all bombing of
North Vietnam. Meanwhile, air
raids on the North continued
Wednesday and Thursday, and
more were planned for Friday.
No details were available im
mediately on Thursday's raids.
Sources said orders had gone
out for strikes Friday in line
with the usual practice of set
ting up missions a day in ad
vance.
On Wednesday, while the

world buzzed with reports of a
proposal to stop the bombing,
U.S. planes ranged as far as 50
miles north of the demilitarized
zone to strike at North Vietna
mese supply and transport fa
cilities.
In Washington, President
Johnson apparently ruled out
the idea of a bombing halt at
this time because of a lack of
evidence that it would be a step
toward peace. Hanoi's delegates
at the Paris peace talks have
said the bombing must end be
fore meaningful negotiations
can begin.
Johnson telephoned the major
presidential candidates, saying:
"There has been no basic change

in the situation, no break
through."
The Thursday morning com
munique from U.S. Headquar
ters listed no ground actions
across South Vietnam.
• Olympic Protest
MEXICO CITY (AP) — Tom
mie Smith and John Carlos lev
eled a bitter racial blast at the
white social structure Wednes
day night after winning the gold
and bronze medals respectively
in the 200 meter dash of the
Olympic Games.
Explaining their demonstra
tion on the victory stand, where
they held clenched fists in black
gloves high over their heads,
they said they wanted to show
the solidarity of black Ameri
cans.
White America "looks upon us
like a crowd at a bullfight. They
look upon us as nothing but
animals — low animals, roaches
and ants," Carlos said.
He said the reason for wearing
the black gloves was to demon
strate their point for both the
white and blacks back in the
United States.
"The reason for the closed
fist," he said, "was to show that
black men in America are unit
ed. We are gradually — no, I
mean rapidly—getting closer to
gether."
Carlos and Smith said the rea
son they wore only one glove
each was that they could get
only one pair of black ones,
which they shared.
They wore knee-length black
stockings as an added gesture of
protest against treatment of Ne
groes in the United States and
green and white buttons which
said "Olympic Project for Civil
Rights."
Carlos was asked why all the
Negroes were not following the
same procedure.
"Each will protest in his own
way," Carlos said.
• Czech-Soviet Pact
PRAGUE (AP) — Czechoslo
vakia reluctantly signed with
the Soviet Union Wednesday
night a treaty legalizing the
presence of Soviet bloc troops
on Czechoslovak territory. Most
will withdraw soon but there
was no indication how many
would stay, Tass quoted Soviet
Premier Alexi Kosygin as say
ing in a speech.
Kosygin said at the signing of
the treaty with Premier Oldrich
Cernik that the withdrawal will
include troops of Poland, Hun
gary, East Germany and Bul
garia. The four East bloc na
tions joined the Soviet Union in
invading Czechoslovakia Aug. 20
to smother a liberalizing trend
away from Soviet-style rule.
Kosygin's speech was made
available by Tass, the Soviet
news agency, in Moscow.

Kosygin made clear that the
Soviet Union expects the Czech
oslovak leaders to take further
measures to return their coun
try to old-line communism —
what he called "normalization of
the situation."
• White House Race
Richard M. Nixon and Hu
bert H. Humphrey spent Wed
nesday campaigning in separate
cities in the Midwest, then flew
to New York City to attend the
traditionally nonpolitical Alfred
E. Smith memorial dinner.
President Johnson also paid a
surprise visit to New York to at
tend the dinner.
Earlier in the day, Nixon
campaigned in Kansas City, ad
dressing a crowd of several
thousand at the city's Union Sta
tion railroad terminal.
The Republican also launched
the first of a series of 10 nightly
radio speeches with a prebroad
cast address in which he said he
listens carefully to young people
—even dissenters—and urged
that 18-year-olds be given the
vote.
Democrat Humphrey was in
St. Louis most of the day. He
spoke to several hundred per
sons at a high school gymna
sium, toured the downtown area
in a motorcade and appeared on
a local television show.
In the broadcast interview, he
conceded that he is trailing Nix
on, but promised, "We'll give
you the biggest surprise in
many, many years." He said he
would win in a "hair-breadth"
decision.
Third party presidential can
didate George C. Wallace took a
sentimental journey to Alamo
gordo, N.M., to visit the house
he and his wife, the late Lur
leen, lived in during the mid
-1940'5.
Later, he went to El Paso,
Tex., for a fund-raising dinner
and a public rally.
In other developments:
—Gov. Spiro T. Agnew of
Maryland, Nixon's running
mate, told a news conference in
Pittsburgh that his selection for
the No. 2 spot on the GOP ticket
was based strictly on his ability
in the field of urban affairs. He
denied he was selected because
of his strong stand on law and
order and his speech criticizing
moderate Negro leaders after
the Baltimore riots last April.
—Retired Air Force Gen. Cur
tis LeMay, Wallace's running
mate, wound up his first day in
Vietnam —a day devoted mainly
to briefings by top U.S. military
officials.
—Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of
Maine, Democratic vice presi
dential nominee, rested at home
in Washington after a nine-day
East Coast swing. Thursday he
heads for the Midwest.
• Gladys Mauls Cuba
MIAMI, Fla. (AP) — Hurri
cane Gladys mauled Cuba with
hammering wind and rain Wed
nesday, then howled into the
Florida Straits and aimed a 90-
mile-an-hour punch at the met
ropolitan Tampa Bay area of
Florida's west coast.
As the thinly populated south
west tip of Florida and the Keys
braced for hurricane winds dur
ing the night, first reports from
Cuba told of serious flash floods
and possibly heavy damage to

crops and industrial installa
tions.
Havana Radio said some
homes and buildings were un
dermined by water and partially
collapsed in Havana.
The reports, coming as Gladys
left Cuba behing, made no men
tion of deaths or injuries. Some
4,000 persons had been evacuated
from low-lying areas and 35,000
head of livestock driven to high
er ground.
In early evening the storm's
center was 240 miles southwest
of Miami near Latitude 23.7
North, Longitude 82.3 West.
The National Hurricane Cen
ter, warning that the storm's
winds would build up to 100
m.p.h., said its northward
course would i.ake it crashing
into the Tampa-St. Petersburg
area of more than one million
population some time Thursday.
But residents were urged to
take immediate precautions for
winds reaching gale force by
daybreak.
• Apollo Grooves On
SPACE CENTER, HOUSTON
(AP) — Happy and relaxed, the
Apollo 7 astronauts sped into the
last half of their 4.5-million-mile
space adventure Wednesday
night with the prospect of shin

a morning star.
The milestone passed at 7:52
p.m. (CDT), with Command Pi
lot Walter M. Schirra Jr. and
engineer Walter Cunningham
awake, but navigator Donn F.
Eisele was said to be asleep.
• Max vs. Cranston
LOS ANGELES (AP) — The
Max Rafferty Senate campaign
formally accused Democrat
Alan Cranston of unethical cam
paign practices Wednesday
while Cranston branded Raffer
ty "not only silly but frighten
ing."
Thomas C. Reed, the state
GOP national committeeman
and former aide to Gov. Rea
gan, filed a complaint on Raf
ferty's behalf with the Fair
Campaign Practices Committee.
Reed asked for "an immedi
ate and complete investigation
of Cranston's false and mislead
ing statements" on the Repub
lican Senate nominee's position
on the war.
"Cranston has stooped to a
campaign of name-calling," Reed
said.
Cranston, the Democratic
nominee, said it is Rafferty who
is not running a clean election
campaign. He added that Raf
ferty must take responsibility
for "lies" against Sen. Thomas
H. Kuchel, Rafferty's losing op
onent in the Republican pri
mary.

"We will give the truth,"
Cranston said.
Meanwhile, the Democratic
candidate criticized Rafferty's
suggestion in Sacramento Tues
day that the South Vietnamese
be allowed to vote on whether
the United States should con
tinue fighting in their country.
Rafferty told a high school
civics class that if the South
Vietnamese "want to go Com
munist, they ought to be al
lowed to do so. But if they want
our help, they should have that,
too." This wculd be decided in
referendum, he proposed
Cranston replied it's time "to
end this bloody struggle no mat
ter what the view of the South
Vietnamese.
Black Panther leader Eldridge
Cleaver is the wrong man to
speak on campus as an advocate
of black power, Cranston told
UCLA students Wednesday.
"I do not believe that a man
who called Bob Kennedy a fas
cist is a responsible person,"
Cranston declared in explaining
his stand on the Cleaver issue.
Although he didn't say when
or where Cleaver made the
statement about the late New
York senator, Cranston's reply
to a student's question drew a
burst of applause.
The Student Union room
which holds about 2,000 persons
was filled to overflowing for his
noontime appearance, and Cran
ston was interrupted frequently,
especially when he demanded
stronger efforts to end the Viet
nam war.
For the first time in his cam
paign, Cranston ran into some
heckling, although it wasn't ser
ious. A group called "freaks for
Rafferty" — about a dozen stu
dents — frequently applauded,
booed or laughed at various re
marks, although they were si
lent close to the end of his
speech.
• Huey Has Faith
VACAVILLE (AP) — Black
Panther founder Huey Newton,
convicted five weeks ago of man
slaughter in the death of an
Oakland policeman expressed
confidence Wednesday his con
viction will be reversed.
Newton met newsmen at the
state's Vacaville Medical facili
ty, where he is being processed
for the state correctional sys
tem, for the first time since he
was convicted in the gunshot
death of patrolman John Frey,
on Oct. 28, 1967.
Newton said he expected the
conviction to be overturned for
two reasons: because of a
change in the transcript of a
tape recording, and what he
called systematic exclusion of
blacks from his jury.
His case has been appealed to
the State District Court of Ap
peal.
• BART Exploration
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Gov.
Reagan's office is continuing to
explore ways of solving the $144
million deficit facing the San
Francisco Bay Area Rapid
Transit District, a Reagan aide
said Wednesday.
But Reagan's conditions for
another special legislative ses
sion on BART remain un

changed, said William Clark Jr.,
Reagan's executive Secretary.
"The governor has stated over
and over again that he will place
the matter on special call an
hour after he has learned there
is some agreement in the legis
lature on a solution that does
not include an increase in tolls
on the Bay Bridge," Clark told
a reporter.
• Complaint Denied
TACOMA, Wash. (AP) — A
complaint filed by about 30 mem
bers of a National Guard unit
from the Burbank, Calif., area
seeking release from active duty
was dismissed Wednesday.
U.S. Dist. Court Judge George
Boldt decided members of the
Ist Sqdn., 18th Armored Cavalry
Division, are members of a mili
tary reserve organization and
were called to active duty con
stitutionally.
The men, mobilized last April
13 and stationed at nearby Ft.
Lewis, contended they could be
called to active duty only to up
hold the laws of the nation or
in the event of insurrection or
invasion.
Boldt ordered the complaint
dismissed "for failure to state
any claim within the jurisdiction
of this court to determine," and
he quoted a recent statement
by the U.S. Supreme Court that
"the judiciary must be scrupu
lous not to interfere with legiti
mate Army matters."
• More SSS Blacks

Selective Service System says
the number of Negroes and oth
er minority members on local

past 18 months.
The system's October news

of last August. During about the
same period the total number of

showing some replacement of
whites by Negroes took place.

mie Smith and John Carlos lev
eled a bitter racial blast at the
white social structure Wednes
day night after winning the gold
and bronze medals respectively
in the 200 meter dash of the
Olympic Games.
Explaining their demonstra
tion on the victory stand, where
they held clenched fists in black
gloves high over their heads,
they said they wanted to show
the solidarity of black Ameri
cans.
White America "looks upon us
like a crowd at a bullfight. They
look upon us as nothing but
animals — low animals, roaches
and ants," Carlos said.
He said the reason for wearing
the black gloves was to demon
strate their point for both the
white and blacks back in the
United States.
"The reason for the closed
fist," he said, "was to show that
black men in America are unit
ed. We are gradually — no, I
mean rapidly—getting closer to
gether."
Carlos and Smith said the rea
son they wore only one glove
each was that they could get
only one pair of black ones,
which they shared.
They wore knee-length black
stockings as an added gesture of
protest against treatment of Ne
groes in the United States and
green and white buttons which
said "Olympic Project for Civil
Rights."
Carlos was asked why all the
Negroes were not following the
same procedure.
"Each will protest in his own
way," Carlos said.
• Czech-Soviet Pact
PRAGUE (AP) — Czechoslo
vakia reluctantly signed with
the Soviet Union Wednesday
night a treaty legalizing the
presence of Soviet bloc troops
on Czechoslovak territory. Most
will withdraw soon but there
was no indication how many
would stay, Tass quoted Soviet
Premier Alexi Kosygin as say
ing in a speech.
Kosygin said at the signing of
the treaty with Premier Oldrich
Cernik that the withdrawal will
include troops of Poland, Hun
gary, East Germany and Bul
garia. The four East bloc na
tions joined the Soviet Union in
invading Czechoslovakia Aug. 20
to smother a liberalizing trend
away from Soviet-style rule.
Kosygin's speech was made
available by Tass, the Soviet
news agency, in Moscow.

Kosygin made clear that the
Soviet Union expects the Czech
oslovak leaders to take further
measures to return their coun
try to old-line communism —
what he called "normalization of
the situation."

Florida's west coast.
As the thinly populated south
west tip of Florida and the Keys
braced for hurricane winds dur

• Max vs. Cranston
LOS ANGELES (AP) — The
Max Rafferty Senate campaign
formally accused Democrat
Alan Cranston of unethical cam

while Cranston branded Raffer
ty "not only silly but frighten

Thomas C. Reed, the state
GOP national committeeman
and former aide to Gov. Rea

Campaign Practices Committee.
Reed asked for "an immedi

of Cranston's false and mislead
ing statements" on the Repub

on the war.
"Cranston has stooped to a
campaign of name-calling," Reed
said.
Cranston, the Democratic

is not running a clean election
campaign. He added that Raf

for "lies" against Sen. Thomas

"We will give the truth,"
Cranston said.
Meanwhile, the Democratic

Thomas C. Reed, the state
GOP national committeeman
and former aide to Gov. Rea

Reed asked for "an immedi

of Cranston's false and mislead

"Cranston has stooped to a

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Tom

Explaining their demonstra

they held clenched fists in black

they said they wanted to show

White America "looks upon us
like a crowd at a bullfight. They
look upon us as nothing but
animals — low animals, roaches
and ants," Carlos said.
He said the reason for wearing
the black gloves was to demon
strate their point for both the
white and blacks back in the
United States.
"The reason for the closed
fist," he said, "was to show that
black men in America are unit

hammering wind and rain Wed
nesday, then howled into the
Florida Straits and aimed a 90-
mile-an-hour punch at the met

Florida's west coast.
As the thinly populated south
west tip of Florida and the Keys
braced for hurricane winds dur

Cuba told of serious flash floods
and possibly heavy damage to

crops and industrial installa

Havana Radio said some
homes and buildings were un

collapsed in Havana.
The reports, coming as Gladys

4,000 persons had been evacuated
from low-lying areas and 35,000

• Max vs. Cranston
LOS ANGELES (AP) — The
Max Rafferty Senate campaign
formally accused Democrat
Alan Cranston of unethical cam

while Cranston branded Raffer
ty "not only silly but frighten

Thomas C. Reed, the state
GOP national committeeman
and former aide to Gov. Rea

Campaign Practices Committee.
Reed asked for "an immedi

of Cranston's false and mislead
ing statements" on the Repub

on the war.
"Cranston has stooped to a
campaign of name-calling," Reed
said.
Cranston, the Democratic
nominee, said it is Rafferty who
is not running a clean election
campaign. He added that Raf

for "lies" against Sen. Thomas

"We will give the truth,"
Cranston said.
Meanwhile, the Democratic

SAIGON (AP) — U.S. Ambas

three times Wednesday with
President Nguyen Van Thieu,
and a high Vietnamese official
said they discussed a new U.S.
proposal to halt all bombing of
North Vietnam. Meanwhile, air
raids on the North continued
Wednesday and Thursday, and
more were planned for Friday.
No details were available im

Sources said orders had gone

with the usual practice of set

In Washington, President

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Tom

day night after winning the gold
and bronze medals respectively
in the 200 meter dash of the
Olympic Games.
Explaining their demonstra
tion on the victory stand, where
they held clenched fists in black
gloves high over their heads,
they said they wanted to show
the solidarity of black Ameri
cans.
White America "looks upon us
like a crowd at a bullfight. They
look upon us as nothing but
animals — low animals, roaches
and ants," Carlos said.
He said the reason for wearing
the black gloves was to demon
strate their point for both the
white and blacks back in the
United States.
"The reason for the closed
fist," he said, "was to show that
black men in America are unit
ed. We are gradually — no, I
mean rapidly—getting closer to
gether."
Carlos and Smith said the rea
son they wore only one glove
each was that they could get
only one pair of black ones,
which they shared.
They wore knee-length black
stockings as an added gesture of
protest against treatment of Ne
groes in the United States and
green and white buttons which
said "Olympic Project for Civil

• Max vs. Cranston
LOS ANGELES (AP) — The
Max Rafferty Senate campaign
formally accused Democrat
Alan Cranston of unethical cam

while Cranston branded Raffer

Thomas C. Reed, the state
GOP national committeeman
and former aide to Gov. Rea

Campaign Practices Committee.
Reed asked for "an immedi

of Cranston's false and mislead

on the war.
"Cranston has stooped to a
campaign of name-calling," Reed
said.
Cranston, the Democratic

is not running a clean election
campaign. He added that Raf

for "lies" against Sen. Thomas

"We will give the truth,"
Cranston said.
Meanwhile, the Democratic

be allowed to vote on whether
the United States should con

SAIGON (AP) — U.S. Ambas

three times Wednesday with
President Nguyen Van Thieu,
and a high Vietnamese official
said they discussed a new U.S.
proposal to halt all bombing of
North Vietnam. Meanwhile, air
raids on the North continued
Wednesday and Thursday, and
more were planned for Friday.
No details were available im

Sources said orders had gone
out for strikes Friday in line
with the usual practice of set

In Washington, President

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Tom

day night after winning the gold
and bronze medals respectively
in the 200 meter dash of the
Olympic Games.
Explaining their demonstra
tion on the victory stand, where
they held clenched fists in black
gloves high over their heads,
they said they wanted to show
the solidarity of black Ameri
cans.
White America "looks upon us
like a crowd at a bullfight. They
look upon us as nothing but
animals — low animals, roaches
and ants," Carlos said.
He said the reason for wearing
the black gloves was to demon
strate their point for both the
white and blacks back in the
United States.
"The reason for the closed
fist," he said, "was to show that
black men in America are unit
ed. We are gradually — no, I
mean rapidly—getting closer to
gether."
Carlos and Smith said the rea
son they wore only one glove
each was that they could get
only one pair of black ones,
which they shared.
They wore knee-length black
stockings as an added gesture of
protest against treatment of Ne
groes in the United States and
green and white buttons which
said "Olympic Project for Civil
Rights."

Negroes were not following the

• Max vs. Cranston
LOS ANGELES (AP) — The

formally accused Democrat
Alan Cranston of unethical cam

while Cranston branded Raffer

Thomas C. Reed, the state
GOP national committeeman
and former aide to Gov. Rea

Reed asked for "an immedi

of Cranston's false and mislead

on the war.
"Cranston has stooped to a
campaign of name-calling," Reed
said.

for "lies" against Sen. Thomas

Cranston said.
Meanwhile, the Democratic

• Deny Bombing Halt

SAIGON (AP) — U.S. Ambas

three times Wednesday with
President Nguyen Van Thieu,
and a high Vietnamese official
said they discussed a new U.S.
proposal to halt all bombing of
North Vietnam. Meanwhile, air
raids on the North continued
Wednesday and Thursday, and
more were planned for Friday.
No details were available im

Sources said orders had gone
out for strikes Friday in line
with the usual practice of set

On Wednesday, while the

U.S. planes ranged as far as 50
miles north of the demilitarized

In Washington, President
Johnson apparently ruled out
the idea of a bombing halt at
this time because of a lack of
evidence that it would be a step
toward peace. Hanoi's delegates

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Tom

day night after winning the gold

in the 200 meter dash of the
Olympic Games.
Explaining their demonstra
tion on the victory stand, where
they held clenched fists in black
gloves high over their heads,
they said they wanted to show
the solidarity of black Ameri
cans.
White America "looks upon us
like a crowd at a bullfight. They
look upon us as nothing but
animals — low animals, roaches
and ants," Carlos said.
He said the reason for wearing
the black gloves was to demon
strate their point for both the
white and blacks back in the
United States.
"The reason for the closed
fist," he said, "was to show that
black men in America are unit
ed. We are gradually — no, I
mean rapidly—getting closer to
gether."
Carlos and Smith said the rea
son they wore only one glove
each was that they could get
only one pair of black ones,
which they shared.
They wore knee-length black
stockings as an added gesture of
protest against treatment of Ne
groes in the United States and
green and white buttons which
said "Olympic Project for Civil

• Deny Bombing Halt

SAIGON (AP) — U.S. Ambas

three times Wednesday with
President Nguyen Van Thieu,
and a high Vietnamese official
said they discussed a new U.S.
proposal to halt all bombing of
North Vietnam. Meanwhile, air
raids on the North continued
Wednesday and Thursday, and
more were planned for Friday.
No details were available im

Sources said orders had gone
out for strikes Friday in line
with the usual practice of set

On Wednesday, while the

world buzzed with reports of a
proposal to stop the bombing,
U.S. planes ranged as far as 50
miles north of the demilitarized
zone to strike at North Vietna
mese supply and transport fa

In Washington, President
Johnson apparently ruled out
the idea of a bombing halt at
this time because of a lack of
evidence that it would be a step
toward peace. Hanoi's delegates
at the Paris peace talks have
said the bombing must end be

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Tom

day night after winning the gold
and bronze medals respectively
in the 200 meter dash of the
Olympic Games.
Explaining their demonstra
tion on the victory stand, where
they held clenched fists in black
gloves high over their heads,
they said they wanted to show
the solidarity of black Ameri
cans.
White America "looks upon us
like a crowd at a bullfight. They
look upon us as nothing but
animals — low animals, roaches
and ants," Carlos said.
He said the reason for wearing
the black gloves was to demon
strate their point for both the
white and blacks back in the
United States.
"The reason for the closed
fist," he said, "was to show that
black men in America are unit
ed. We are gradually — no, I
mean rapidly—getting closer to
gether."
Carlos and Smith said the rea
son they wore only one glove
each was that they could get
only one pair of black ones,
which they shared.
They wore knee-length black
stockings as an added gesture of
protest against treatment of Ne
groes in the United States and
green and white buttons which
said "Olympic Project for Civil

cist is a responsible person,"
Cranston declared in explaining
his stand on the Cleaver issue.
Although he didn't say when
or where Cleaver made the
statement about the late New
York senator, Cranston's reply
to a student's question drew a
burst of applause.
The Student Union room
which holds about 2,000 persons
was filled to overflowing for his
noontime appearance, and Cran
ston was interrupted frequently,
especially when he demanded
stronger efforts to end the Viet
nam war.
For the first time in his cam
paign, Cranston ran into some
heckling, although it wasn't ser
ious. A group called "freaks for
Rafferty" — about a dozen stu
dents — frequently applauded,
booed or laughed at various re
marks, although they were si
lent close to the end of his
speech.
• Huey Has Faith
VACAVILLE (AP) — Black
Panther founder Huey Newton,
convicted five weeks ago of man
slaughter in the death of an
Oakland policeman expressed
confidence Wednesday his con
viction will be reversed.
Newton met newsmen at the
state's Vacaville Medical facili
ty, where he is being processed
for the state correctional sys
tem, for the first time since he
was convicted in the gunshot
death of patrolman John Frey,
on Oct. 28, 1967.
Newton said he expected the
conviction to be overturned for
two reasons: because of a
change in the transcript of a
tape recording, and what he
called systematic exclusion of
blacks from his jury.
His case has been appealed to
the State District Court of Ap
peal.
• BART Exploration
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Gov.
Reagan's office is continuing to
explore ways of solving the $144
million deficit facing the San
Francisco Bay Area Rapid
Transit District, a Reagan aide
said Wednesday.
But Reagan's conditions for
another special legislative ses
sion on BART remain un

changed, said William Clark Jr.,
Reagan's executive Secretary.
"The governor has stated over
and over again that he will place
the matter on special call an
hour after he has learned there
is some agreement in the legis
lature on a solution that does
not include an increase in tolls
on the Bay Bridge," Clark told
a reporter.
• Complaint Denied
TACOMA, Wash. (AP) — A
complaint filed by about 30 mem
bers of a National Guard unit
from the Burbank, Calif., area
seeking release from active duty
was dismissed Wednesday.
U.S. Dist. Court Judge George
Boldt decided members of the
Ist Sqdn., 18th Armored Cavalry
Division, are members of a mili
tary reserve organization and
were called to active duty con
stitutionally.
The men, mobilized last April
13 and stationed at nearby Ft.
Lewis, contended they could be
called to active duty only to up
hold the laws of the nation or
in the event of insurrection or
invasion.
Boldt ordered the complaint
dismissed "for failure to state
any claim within the jurisdiction
of this court to determine," and
he quoted a recent statement
by the U.S. Supreme Court that
"the judiciary must be scrupu
lous not to interfere with legiti
mate Army matters."
