## Heiller Goes For Baroque 
### ALAN GLAROS 
A small afternoon crowd heard
Anton Heiller give a competent
and sometimes brilliant organ
recital last Sunday in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium.
The all-German program fea
tured Baroque composers but in
cluded some modern works.
The first half of the program
was strictly Baroque. Heiller
opened his program with the
Prelude and Fugue in D minor
by Georg Bohm, a partita (also
by Bohm), a chorale-fantasy of
Buxtehude, and two works of
Bach, one of which was the "Do
rian" Prelude and Fugue in D
minor.
Heiller then rounded out his
program with a sonata by the
modern composer Paul Hinde
mith, the Introduction and Pas
saeaglia in F Minor, from Mono
logue of Max Reger, and Heil
ler's own improvisation on a
submitted theme.
Ornamented
As far as the Baroque com
posers were concerned, Heiller
displayed his knowledge of Ba
roque ornamentation to the full
est. Without ornamentation, a

work by a composer such as
Buxtehude sounds dull and un
interesting, but Heiller managed
to bring some life into the Ba
roque works.
He was assisted in part by the
organ itself. Built by the Aus
trian manufacturer Hradetzky
and installed only last Novem
ber, the organ is uniquely suited
to the works of Bach and other
Barogue composers. Employing
mechanical (tracker) action, the
Hradetzky organ is an attempt
to return to the "classic" organ
of Bach.
But its brilliant sound is not
restricted to the composers of
the 17th century. The Hindemith
sonata and the work by Reger
sounded surprisingly good on
this organ.
The first half of the program
was for the most part unin
spired. Heiller helped enliven
some forty minutes of Baroque
music with some interesting reg
istrations, but sustaining listen
er interest proved to be a diffi
cult task.
Three Germans
This was due in part to the
program itself. Three German
Baroque composers played con
secutively for over one-half hour
do not make for wide-eyed at
tention. In addition, each time
Heiller wanted to change regis
trations, an interruption in the
flow of the music would occur.
Heiller used two assistants in
the Reger work to help him
change the stops. Why he didn't

use them in the other works to
avoid these annoying breaks in
the music is a real question.
The Bach prelude and fugue
proved to be most engaging
work of the first part of the pro
gram. Heiller played the work
with assurance and sensitivity,
displaying a feeling and com
mand of the Baroque idiom.
The Hindemith sonata led the
second half of the program and
proved to be a welcome break
from the Baroque music of the
first half.
Even though it was played a
shade too fast, folksongs on
which the work was based were
well brought out.
Reger Is Highlight
The Reger Introduction and
Passacaglia was the highlight of
the entire program. With the
help of two assistants, the regis
tration for the work was well
done and generally free of the
annoying breaks in the music
which occurred in the first half
of the program whenever Heiller
wanted to change stops. The Re
ger piece is one of those spec
tacular works in which the or
ganist gets a chance to show off
his technique. Fortunately, Heil
ler also managed to play osme
music.
The theme submitted to Heil
ler for improvisation can only
be described as ugly. Heiller
made the most of this vicious
theme, but the improvisation
was doomed from the very be
ginning.

This was due in part to the
program itself. Three German
Baroque composers played con
secutively for over one-half hour
do not make for wide-eyed at
tention. In addition, each time
Heiller wanted to change regis
trations, an interruption in the
flow of the music would occur.
Heiller used two assistants in
the Reger work to help him
change the stops. Why he didn't

use them in the other works to
avoid these annoying breaks in
the music is a real question.
The Bach prelude and fugue
proved to be most engaging
work of the first part of the pro
gram. Heiller played the work
with assurance and sensitivity,
displaying a feeling and com
mand of the Baroque idiom.
The Hindemith sonata led the
second half of the program and
proved to be a welcome break
from the Baroque music of the
first half.
Even though it was played a
shade too fast, folksongs on
which the work was based were
well brought out.
Reger Is Highlight
The Reger Introduction and
Passacaglia was the highlight of
the entire program. With the
help of two assistants, the regis
tration for the work was well
done and generally free of the
annoying breaks in the music
which occurred in the first half
of the program whenever Heiller
wanted to change stops. The Re
ger piece is one of those spec
tacular works in which the or
ganist gets a chance to show off
his technique. Fortunately, Heil
ler also managed to play osme
music.
The theme submitted to Heil
ler for improvisation can only
be described as ugly. Heiller
made the most of this vicious
theme, but the improvisation
was doomed from the very be
ginning.
A small afternoon crowd heard
Anton Heiller give a competent
and sometimes brilliant organ
recital last Sunday in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium.
The all-German program fea
tured Baroque composers but in
cluded some modern works.
The first half of the program
was strictly Baroque. Heiller
opened his program with the
Prelude and Fugue in D minor
by Georg Bohm, a partita (also
by Bohm), a chorale-fantasy of
Buxtehude, and two works of
Bach, one of which was the "Do
rian" Prelude and Fugue in D
minor.
Heiller then rounded out his
program with a sonata by the
modern composer Paul Hinde
mith, the Introduction and Pas
saeaglia in F Minor, from Mono
logue of Max Reger, and Heil
ler's own improvisation on a
submitted theme.
Ornamented
As far as the Baroque com
posers were concerned, Heiller
displayed his knowledge of Ba
roque ornamentation to the full
est. Without ornamentation, a

work by a composer such as
Buxtehude sounds dull and un
interesting, but Heiller managed
to bring some life into the Ba
roque works.
He was assisted in part by the
organ itself. Built by the Aus
trian manufacturer Hradetzky
and installed only last Novem
ber, the organ is uniquely suited
to the works of Bach and other
Barogue composers. Employing
mechanical (tracker) action, the
Hradetzky organ is an attempt
to return to the "classic" organ
of Bach.
But its brilliant sound is not
restricted to the composers of
the 17th century. The Hindemith
sonata and the work by Reger
sounded surprisingly good on
this organ.
The first half of the program
was for the most part unin
spired. Heiller helped enliven
some forty minutes of Baroque
music with some interesting reg
istrations, but sustaining listen
er interest proved to be a diffi
cult task.
