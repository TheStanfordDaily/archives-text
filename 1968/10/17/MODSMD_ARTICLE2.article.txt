# Political Science TA's Demand Salary Rise Of $700 Per Year
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Eleven graduate students with
teaching positions took the first
step yesterday that may lead to
a reappraisal of the role of the
teaching assistant (TA) in the
University.
The reevaluation of the Stan
ford TA may result from a list
of demands sent yesterday to
the Provost Richard Lyman by
the political science TA's.
The demands deal only with
one aspect of TA life, although
certainly the most volatile one:
salaries.
But it is expected that TA-Ad
ministration discussions will not
be limited to salary debates. As
sistant Provost Ray Bacchetti
expects meetings with TA's to
lead into "a sweeping look at
the system."
Specifically, the 11 graduate

students who serve as section
leaders for introductory political
science courses issued a set of
five demands through their
elected "steward" Richard
Young that include:
• Increase in salaries from
$2,300 to $3,000 per year for all
political science TA's.
• Payment of $300 for each
dependent of a TA.
• No increase in teaching
loads or reduction of existing
benefits to accompany the rise
in salary.
• Implementation of these de
mands should be carried out by
the beginning of Winter Quar
ter.
• Beginning of "good-faith"
negotiations by Friday, Oct. 25.
The 11 TA's in the depart
ment's teaching staff adopted
the demands unanimously. All
belong to the graduate students'
union, Local 1816 of the Amer
ican Federation of Teachers
(AFT).
Union Help
Although the demands deal
only with the political represen
tative in next week's meeting
with University officials. Initial
talks with political science TA's
seem certain to widen in scope
to include all University grad
uate students with teaching
posts.
Young, a 28-year-old TA with

two masters degrees, claimed
that the current $2,300 stipend
"is simply inadequate to live on
in this area." He said that TA's
are told not to gain outside em
ployment.
"These are minimal demands
to bring us up to minimum
subsistence levels," Young
stated. "The cost of living has
risen dramatically while salaries
have remained relatively stag
nant." The only recent signifi
cant salary boost for TA's came
last winter when salaries were
raised $200 per year.
Young explained that "many
graduate students don't view a
TA position as something to
strive for; the better grad stu
dents try to avoid TA duties.
It's simply a fact that fellow
ships pay better."
Letter Requested
Young stated that he wanted
to conduct discussions with ad
ministrators on an informal
basis, but a member of the pro
vost's office asked for a letter
listing areas of concern. The for
mal demands grew from this re
quest.
The demands are "extremely
moderate," according to Young.
"Salaries have been low due to
an oversight. I have faith in the
reasonableness of the Admini
stration." He said that requests
last year for salary reviews

were not seriously considered.
He added that he did not con
template a strike on the part of
the TA's. "Such action should
be unnecessary," he stated. "I
am confident of the acceptance
of the demands."
The local AFT union will be
included in the negotiations
since "these are campus-wide
issues and grievances," Young
said. He added that the political
science TA's acted first since
"we have a great deal of co
hesion and as political scientists
we understand the value of or
ganization."
Response Awaited
Andrew Moss, president of the
Union local, anticipates a
"strong response" in the near
future from other University de
partments. He stated that a Un
ion general meeting next week
will formulate a statement of
support for the political' science
efforts.
Moss termed the demands "an
important first step toward the
establishment of reasonable sal
aries for all."
Although still refusing to rec
ognize the 150-member organi
zation as a negotiating union,
Asst. Provost Bacchetti reaf
firmed earlier Administration
policy that University officials
will meet with any group of stu
dents or faculty.
Bacchetti explained that he

and other administrators will be
"glad to sit down and talk"
with political science and Union
representatives.
No Budget Yet
Bacchetti said, "I don't think
anyone disagrees with the fact
that salaries should be raised."
However, he stated that next
year's income has not been esti
mated so that spending prior
ities can not as yet be estab
lished.
"It will be another month, at
least, before we can meaning
fully talk about priorities," he
said. Uncertainities raised by
Congress, grants, the draft, and
enrollment have yet to be re
solved, he explained.
Bacchetti made it clear that
discussions with TA's would be
limited to neither the political
science students nor the salary
question. "This is a University
wide problem," he stated.
He commented that salaries
were "only one among several
other components. You can't
take a subject like this piece
by-piece." He suggested a broad
er topic in which interested
graduate students might join
administrators to investigate:
"The role of teaching in grad
uate education."

tion members became concerned
about TA living and working
conditions. "It's nice to know
they think that something
should be done, at last," he said.
Moss explained that the Un
ion "received no cooperation last
year—zero. 1 think this year will
be better, although we'll still
have to push for things."
He hopes that the upcoming
meetings with administrators
will "cut away some of the fog"
surrounding TA salaries and
policy decisions.
He also noted a "potential
problem that will need clearing
