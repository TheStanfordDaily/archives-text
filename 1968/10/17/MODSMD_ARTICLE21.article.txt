## Flicks With Weird Beauty 
### 
By BARBARA RITZ
Tonight Stanford Student's
can be film (Titles:
. ."Genesis I —Film Evolution"
presents a collection of 15 of the
best experimental and documen
tary films produced currently by
young American and British
filmmakers.
Two showings, at 7 tonight
and 9:30 p.m. Saturday, will be
in Cubberley Auditorium- Tick
ets can be purchased at Tresid
der and at the door. Student ad
missions is $1 and general ad
mission $1.50.
"Genesis I" is a persuasive
collection of exciting new (and
exciting old) tricks of the mo
tion picture trade by 15 inde
pendent young ringmasters,
each doing his own thing with
finesse and sometimes brilliance
and always gusto.
Their passionate intensity was
predictable; the excruciating
beauty of so many of their
images was not. To recapture a
few: the bride and her tattooed
bachelor, hand-in-hand, flying
high over the fairgrounds, a la
Chagall (in "The Matchseller");
the otherwise ordinary shots of
an everyday housewife dusting
her diningroom, lit by Vermeer
(in "Reliquary"); the Red Man's

bloodied skull superimposed on
the White Man's civilization in
"Now That the Buffalo's Gone,"
a film so distinctive it's recently
been added to the collection of
the Museum of Modern Art.
"Numbers" pays homage to
Eisenstein (lest he be forgotten
in the dazzle of strobe lights),
juxtaposing slaughter house
with maternity ward before you
know what's hit you. "Sound of
Flesh" brings back the flotsam
jetsam of surrealism's oldies but
goodies: the stocking masks and
mannequins are revitalized;
drugstore-cardinals piously ad
minister the Syntex sacraments
and rabbis slap razorbacks. But
it is cleanly photographed and
meticulously composed.
In "Children of Synanon" an
estranged young girl and her
cold fish mother "spill their
guts," and then are forced to
learn how to hug one another.
It is all part of "the game", and
a fine, moving moment. Another
one is in "Behind Every Great
Man", when the camera moves
in for a close-up of the little boy
sitting beside his mother in the
old photograph on the dressing
table of the transvestite. (There
is more "content" contained in
that one shot than in all of

Shirley Clarke's "Portrait of Ja
son").
All 15 short films have their
moments. Some have little else,
but a few extraordinary ones
seem to me completely realized
works of art. Two in particular
at opposite extremes:
"I Wish I Knew How It Would
Feel To Be Free" was shot all
over Now Haven's black ghetto.
The interviewer seems to be ask
ing simply what freedom means
to people there, with predictably
scorching results. The camera
didn't shake and wobble enough
to make this a classic of its
genre, perhaps, but on the other
hand the people speak out, via
the director rather than vice
versa, which seems to be what
cinema-verite is really good for.
Last, and most, in the cate
gory of must - see ■ to-believe:
"7362". Well, first of all, what
the hell is it? A soft machine?
A velvet hammer? An iron but
terfly, perhaps.
