# Author Claims U.S. Research On CBW Costs Half-Billion

The Federal Government was
spending more money on ehem
ieal and biological research in
1964 than it is spending now on
cancer research a speaker told
a Dinkelspiel audience Tuesday.
According to Seymour Hersch,
the author of a recently pub
lished book entitled Chemical
and Biological Warfare —Ameri-
ca's Hidden Arsenal, the United
States is currently admitting
spending $300 million, but "the
fact is that it is now spending
more than $500 million."
Hersch, who spent a number
of years in Washington as the
Associated Press Pentagon cor
respondent and most recently
spent time as Senator Eugene
McCarthy's press secretary dur
ing his bid for the Presidential
nomination, based his $500 mil
lion figure on the stepped up
shipping of material in recent
months to Vietnam.
He admitted, though, that of
all the information he has been
able to uncover he knows "only
two percent of all that is hap
pening." But he maintained that
in 1963 a Pentagon decision was
made to make all information
unavailable. The only ones able
to get it were such people as
\jnajor generals in the army
chemical reserve.
Dividing his talk in two parts,

chemical and biological, Hersch
first spoke of nerve gas which
was first developed by the Ger
mans during World War 11.
"After the war there was a
scramble to get what the Ger
mans had developed. The United
States recovered what they could
and shipped it home labeled
'Chlorine'."
The material was sent to
Edgewood, Maryland, just out
side Baltimore and one fiftieth
of a milligram was found to be
lethal in three minutes.
The Edgewood location event
ually developed a gas which
was found to be thirty times
more lethal. It was this UK gas
which was being tested in Dug
way, Utah, which killed 6400
sheep.
This advanced type of gas
was found to have a much
greater advantage over the for
mer gases, not only in its greater
potency, but also in the fact that
it does not need to be breathed.
It is absorbed into the pores.
In reference to the Dugway,
Utah incident which occurred
last March Hersch said that to
this day the military has denied
any connection with the inci
dent and in fact did not set up

a study group until more than a
month after the incident.
Hersch, who was covering the
story for Esquire magazine, said
that on March 13, 1968 at 5:22
in the morning either an F4 or
an F8 took off for a test of the
gas. The tubes which released
the gas failed to close after
the run and as a result was car
ried a great distance into the
upper atmosphere.
Hersch said that because of
the fact that the incident occur
red when human beings were in
bed, no human life was lost, but
for the exposed sheep as well as
surrounding wildlife, death came
soon after.
In the area of Biological War
fare Hersch pointed to the Fort
Dietrich Research Center in
Washington, D.C., which in its
research uses between 60,000 and
120,000 animals per month.
It has developed a neutronic
plague in which 99 percent in
flicted with the germ die.
According to Hersch, one of
the most frightening experi
ments at Fort Dietrich was a
program to breed resistence into
a form of plague. The mutations
were resistent to antibiotics, sun,
and heat.

Dietrich Research Center in
Washington, D.C., which in its
research uses between 60,000 and
120,000 animals per month.
It has developed a neutronic
plague in which 99 percent in
flicted with the germ die.
According to Hersch, one of
the most frightening experi
ments at Fort Dietrich was a
program to breed resistence into
a form of plague. The mutations
were resistent to antibiotics, sun,
and heat.
The Federal Government was
spending more money on ehem
ieal and biological research in
1964 than it is spending now on
cancer research a speaker told
a Dinkelspiel audience Tuesday.
According to Seymour Hersch,
the author of a recently pub
lished book entitled Chemical
and Biological Warfare —Ameri-
ca's Hidden Arsenal, the United
States is currently admitting
spending $300 million, but "the
fact is that it is now spending
more than $500 million."
Hersch, who spent a number
of years in Washington as the
Associated Press Pentagon cor
respondent and most recently
spent time as Senator Eugene
McCarthy's press secretary dur
ing his bid for the Presidential
nomination, based his $500 mil
lion figure on the stepped up
shipping of material in recent
months to Vietnam.
He admitted, though, that of
all the information he has been
able to uncover he knows "only
two percent of all that is hap
pening." But he maintained that
in 1963 a Pentagon decision was
made to make all information
unavailable. The only ones able
to get it were such people as
\jnajor generals in the army
chemical reserve.
Dividing his talk in two parts,

chemical and biological, Hersch
first spoke of nerve gas which
was first developed by the Ger
mans during World War 11.
"After the war there was a
scramble to get what the Ger
mans had developed. The United
States recovered what they could
and shipped it home labeled
'Chlorine'."
The material was sent to
Edgewood, Maryland, just out
side Baltimore and one fiftieth
of a milligram was found to be
lethal in three minutes.
The Edgewood location event
ually developed a gas which
was found to be thirty times
more lethal. It was this UK gas
which was being tested in Dug
way, Utah, which killed 6400
sheep.
This advanced type of gas
was found to have a much
greater advantage over the for
mer gases, not only in its greater
potency, but also in the fact that
it does not need to be breathed.
It is absorbed into the pores.
In reference to the Dugway,
Utah incident which occurred
last March Hersch said that to
this day the military has denied
any connection with the inci
dent and in fact did not set up

a study group until more than a
month after the incident.
Hersch, who was covering the
story for Esquire magazine, said
that on March 13, 1968 at 5:22
in the morning either an F4 or
an F8 took off for a test of the
gas. The tubes which released
the gas failed to close after
the run and as a result was car
ried a great distance into the
upper atmosphere.
Hersch said that because of
the fact that the incident occur
red when human beings were in
bed, no human life was lost, but
for the exposed sheep as well as
surrounding wildlife, death came
soon after.
In the area of Biological War
fare Hersch pointed to the Fort
Dietrich Research Center in
Washington, D.C., which in its
research uses between 60,000 and
120,000 animals per month.
