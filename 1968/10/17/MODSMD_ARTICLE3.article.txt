# Little Hope Remains For New Constitution
## 
### 
The 1,480 votes cast on this
campus in Monday's and Tues
day's election leave little hope
for a new constitution.
Neither the proposed new
ASSU Constitution nor the con
stitution offered by the Commit
tee for Student Responsibility
(CSR) received the necessary
two-thirds majority of the votes
cast. (See tabulation at end of
story.) Therefore, the present
Constitution will remain in ef
fect.
Not all the votes are in, how
ever. The 450 persons attending
overseas campuses have not yet
voted. The ballots still have to
be mailed overseas, so the final
results of the election will not
be known for ten to fifteen days.
The proposed ASSU Constitu
tion received 64.3% of the votes,
only 2.4% away from ratifica
tion. A 3 to 1 majority for this
constitution on the overseas
campuses would supply the need
ed votes.

Two of the three propositions
on the ballot were passed by
such large majorities that the
overseas votes will not affect
them. The proposals of the Com
mittee of Fifteen and the propo
sition to support the grape boy
cott were accepted overwhelm
ingly.
The proposed by-law regard
ing the Hare System method of
voting was ratified. However, it
will not go into effect unless the
ASSU Constitution is eventually
passed.
Student leaders' opinions con
cerning the results differ. Yale
Braunstein, Speaker of the Leg
islature (LASSU), thinks stu
dents made the correct decision.
He stated, "Both constitutions
had good points and bad points.
The strong points of both should
be combined and after a lot of
work be presented to the stu
dent body."
Denis Hayes, President of
LASSU, disagreed with Braun

stein's statement, pointing out
that six months and the recom
mendations of over 350 people
went into the proposed ASSU
constitution.
Hayes stated that he will not
participate in developing another
constitution, but noted that
LASSU members might well
start working on another one.

tion received 64.3% of the votes,
only 2.4% away from ratifica
tion. A 3 to 1 majority for this
constitution on the overseas
campuses would supply the need
ed votes.

Two of the three propositions
on the ballot were passed by
such large majorities that the
overseas votes will not affect
them. The proposals of the Com
mittee of Fifteen and the propo
sition to support the grape boy
cott were accepted overwhelm
ingly.
The proposed by-law regard
ing the Hare System method of
voting was ratified. However, it
will not go into effect unless the
ASSU Constitution is eventually
passed.
Student leaders' opinions con
cerning the results differ. Yale
Braunstein, Speaker of the Leg
islature (LASSU), thinks stu
dents made the correct decision.
He stated, "Both constitutions
had good points and bad points.
The strong points of both should
be combined and after a lot of
work be presented to the stu
dent body."
Denis Hayes, President of
LASSU, disagreed with Braun

stein's statement, pointing out
that six months and the recom
mendations of over 350 people
went into the proposed ASSU
constitution.
Hayes stated that he will not
participate in developing another
constitution, but noted that
LASSU members might well
start working on another one.

The 1,480 votes cast on this
campus in Monday's and Tues
day's election leave little hope
for a new constitution.
Neither the proposed new
ASSU Constitution nor the con
stitution offered by the Commit
tee for Student Responsibility
(CSR) received the necessary
two-thirds majority of the votes
cast. (See tabulation at end of
story.) Therefore, the present
Constitution will remain in ef
fect.
Not all the votes are in, how
ever. The 450 persons attending
overseas campuses have not yet
voted. The ballots still have to
be mailed overseas, so the final
results of the election will not
be known for ten to fifteen days.
