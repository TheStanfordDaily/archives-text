# Trustees To Dine With Students, But Will Meet In Private
## 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON 
Stanford trustees began a se
ries of on-campus dinners last
night amid mixed reactions from
students.
The trustees, who are to hold
their monthly meeting this af
ternoon at the Alumni house,
were guests at several campus
residences including Lagunita,
Delta Tau Delta and Soto House.
Today's trustee meeting has
led to an advertisement appear
ing in this issue of the Daily.
The ad invites "the Stanford
Community" to the 1 p.m. meet
ing. The ad seems to imply that
the meeting is to be an open one.
Meeting Closed
University spokesmen, how
ever, point out that Board meet
ings are not open and that to
day's meeting is no exception.
The ad, which appears on page
is sponsored by the "Ad Hoc
Committee for an Open Univer
sity." Members of the committee
include LASSU speaker Yale

Braunstein, former speaker Mike
Weinstein, and LASSU member
Jeff Kane.
Weinstein yesterday refused
to answer any questions about
the purpose of their paid adver
tisement. The committee has
also written a letter to the "Stan
ford Community" which reads,
"Last night the trustees visited
several dorms and talked with
the students. Today they are
meeting behind closed doors to
discuss their business â€”us -and
we are excluded from any par
ticipation.
"While the administration in
creases inclusion of students on
non-decision making committees,
it denies us an opportunity to
have a voice in the actual con
trol of the university. The trus
tee meeting today gives us an
opportunity to take an active
role in the highest ruling body
in the community."
"We therefore urge all mem
bers of the community to attend

the meeting of the Trustees at
1 p.m. this afternoon in Bowman
Alumni House."
'Guerillas' Entertain Lagunita
President-designate Kenneth
Pitzer was the guest last night
at Lagunita and was unexpect
edly entertained by a roving
guerilla theater group. The
group, numbering about 20, ar
rived at the Lagunita dining hall
at around 6:45 only to find the
doors locked and the curtains
drawn.
The anti-war group pounded
on the doors and windows for
several minutes, to no avail.
About ten minutes later they
again pounded on the doors and
were admitted, at the order of
Pitzer.
Several pickets entered the
hall and a band of "planes" also
"buzzed" the dining room. The
picketers carried signs saying,
"Lockheed, General Dynamics,
Northrup, etc. Unfair to Vietna
mese Peasants" and "What Does

Your Trustee Do For A Living?"
The guerilla theater players
received a moderate round of
applause and laughter after their
short presentation. Pitzer had
received a similar round of ap
plause when he was introduced
earlier.
Meanwhile at the Delta Tau
Delta House on San Juan Street
Trustees Charles Ducommun of
Ducommun, Inc. and William
Hewlett of Hewlett - Packard
were questioned about Presi
dent-designate Pitzer's qualifica
tions. When asked why faculty
hut not students were consulted
in the presidential selection pro
cess, Hewlett replied, "Students
are transitory; faculty are per
manent."
The trustees will continue
their on-campus dinners tonight
with members of the board hav
ing dinner at El Toro eating
club, Florence Moore Hall and
Lambda Nu.
