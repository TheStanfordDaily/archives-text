## Open Meetings For Senate 
### 
Editor, The DAILY:
Under a special agendum en
titled For the Good of the Uni
versity, meetings of the new
Senate of the Academic Council
are planned to accommodate ex
ploration and discussion of items
of concern to members of the
University community, even
though the consideration of
such items has not yet reached
the stage of specific proposals
for action or decision.
On September 26, 1968, the
Senate adopted a resolution
which included the provision
that the agendum, For the Good
of the University, be open to
members of the University com
munity by petition to the Steer
ing Committee and that this
mechanism be widely publicized.
This and other means of com
munication regarding common
concerns are to be studied by an
ad hoc Senate Committee which
includes both students and fac
ulty members.
Pending report from the new
Committee, students, faculty,
and staff members who wish to
make use of this provision are
invited to address the Steering
of the Academic Secretary.

• Ram's Head Protest
Editor, The DAILY:
I am particularly infuriated at
the article which appeared on
the front page of Number 19 this
year about the lack of a Gaities
this year.
So Johnnie Scott, "already a
writer and poet of national repu
tation" is angry that his script
was scrapped. He is angry that
no music had yet been written
to his lyrics. He is angry that

Mr. Scott submitted his script
towards the middle of August,
two full months after the initial
dead-line date. Nothing could be
done, of course, with the show
until a script was present, and
this lateness put a great pres
sure on the production staff
leaving them with three months
to write music, orchestrate same,
cast parts, rehearse, design sets
and costumes, organize publicity,
and all the rest that goes into a
major production.
This, however, was not our
entire set of problems. The
script was terrible. It was con
troversial, sure, but I'm not
knocking that. The technique of
writing was so terrible that ma
jor revisions were necessary.
Secondly, the lyrics submitted
with the script were a set of un
singable poetry—good in their
own right but not adaptable to
the genre of music. These, too,
were to be rewritten.
So Ram's Head found them
selves holding a bag of insur
mountable tasks and not much
time. Sure, a show of this topic,
although not related to Big
Game, would draw a great num
ber of the interested people. But
any show, even Gaities, must be
done completely with high-lustre
polish which Mr. Scott's late
script did not provide.

Editor, The DAILY:
It is a very strange experi
ence to be personally confronted
with an accusation such as the
DAILY labeled against Ram's
Head and its members today.
It is perhaps an even stranger
experience to be informed, via
the news media, of one's own
.motives for certain past ac
♦ionc ocTwiaiiy if these motives

six months on the issue now at
hand.
Last spring, the Ram's Head
Board contacted Johnie Scott
and Bob Fletcher regarding a
script for 1968 Gaieties. Mr. Scott
informed Ram's Head of the na
ture of the proposed script, and
the ideas were warmly received.
No statements such as "This
play is racist and immoral" were
said in the discussion at that
time, nor ever in any of the fol
lowing discussions of the script;
on the contrary, the Board voted
unanimously in 112 a v or of the
script, and its director, Bob
Fletcher.
This fall, we met again and
voted, this time not to produce
a Gaities. For those of us who
love Ram's Head, it was a hard
thing to do. The prospect of
producing Mr. Scott's script was
an exciting and challenging one,
and the enthusiasm of the Board
for the project was consistently
high. These and only these facts
were presented to the Board;
Never once was the content of
the show under discussion.
1. Having heard Mr. Flet
cher's resignation a few min
utes before, we did not have
and could not find a director
for anything, much less for a
serious, thoughtful work of
drama such as Mr. Scott's
script.
2. Gaities was scheduled to
go on in six weeks.
3. Ram's Head is currently
$1,500 in debt.
4. Half of our production
staff had resigned because of
personal conflicts with the di
rector.
5. We had no music, and we
did not know of anyone will
ing and capable of writing a

full musical score in two weeks.
DAILY writers McGuire and
Wong were informed of these
facts. I would be interested to
know if they would have ad
vised us to produce a show,
ANY show under these circum
stances.
But as we voted against Gaie
ties, we never once retracted our
votes for Johnie Scott's project.
At the very same meeting,
Ram's Head decided to spend
the better half of fall quarter
assembling sufficient financial
credit and technical staff to re
deem our position.
We will be assigned two MFA
drama department directors next
quarter. Because of its belief
in the project, and because of
its concern and sympathy with
the Black Cause, Ram's Head
voted to give first priority to
the effort to produce Johnie
Scott's script this winter quar
ter.

• Ram's Head Protest
Editor, The DAILY:
I am particularly infuriated at
the article which appeared on
the front page of Number 19 this
year about the lack of a Gaities
this year.
So Johnnie Scott, "already a
writer and poet of national repu
tation" is angry that his script
was scrapped. He is angry that
no music had yet been written
to his lyrics. He is angry that

Mr. Scott submitted his script
towards the middle of August,
two full months after the initial
dead-line date. Nothing could be
done, of course, with the show
until a script was present, and
this lateness put a great pres
sure on the production staff
leaving them with three months
to write music, orchestrate same,
cast parts, rehearse, design sets
and costumes, organize publicity,
and all the rest that goes into a
major production.
This, however, was not our
entire set of problems. The
script was terrible. It was con
troversial, sure, but I'm not
knocking that. The technique of
writing was so terrible that ma
jor revisions were necessary.
Secondly, the lyrics submitted
with the script were a set of un
singable poetry—good in their
own right but not adaptable to
the genre of music. These, too,
were to be rewritten.
So Ram's Head found them
selves holding a bag of insur
mountable tasks and not much
time. Sure, a show of this topic,
although not related to Big
Game, would draw a great num
ber of the interested people. But
any show, even Gaities, must be
done completely with high-lustre
polish which Mr. Scott's late
script did not provide.

It is a very strange experi

with an accusation such as the

It is perhaps an even stranger
experience to be informed, via
the news media, of one's own
.motives for certain past ac

six months on the issue now at
hand.
Last spring, the Ram's Head
Board contacted Johnie Scott
and Bob Fletcher regarding a
script for 1968 Gaieties. Mr. Scott
informed Ram's Head of the na
ture of the proposed script, and
the ideas were warmly received.
No statements such as "This
play is racist and immoral" were
said in the discussion at that
time, nor ever in any of the fol
lowing discussions of the script;
on the contrary, the Board voted
unanimously in 112 a v or of the
script, and its director, Bob
Fletcher.
This fall, we met again and
voted, this time not to produce
a Gaities. For those of us who
love Ram's Head, it was a hard
thing to do. The prospect of
producing Mr. Scott's script was
an exciting and challenging one,
and the enthusiasm of the Board
for the project was consistently
high. These and only these facts
were presented to the Board;
Never once was the content of
the show under discussion.
1. Having heard Mr. Flet
cher's resignation a few min
utes before, we did not have
and could not find a director
for anything, much less for a
serious, thoughtful work of
drama such as Mr. Scott's
script.
2. Gaities was scheduled to
go on in six weeks.
3. Ram's Head is currently
$1,500 in debt.
4. Half of our production
staff had resigned because of
personal conflicts with the di
rector.
5. We had no music, and we
did not know of anyone will
ing and capable of writing a

full musical score in two weeks.
DAILY writers McGuire and
Wong were informed of these
facts. I would be interested to
know if they would have ad
vised us to produce a show,
ANY show under these circum
stances.
But as we voted against Gaie
ties, we never once retracted our
votes for Johnie Scott's project.
At the very same meeting,
Ram's Head decided to spend
the better half of fall quarter
assembling sufficient financial
credit and technical staff to re
deem our position.
We will be assigned two MFA
drama department directors next
quarter. Because of its belief
in the project, and because of
its concern and sympathy with

voted to give first priority to

• Ram's Head Protest
Editor, The DAILY:
I am particularly infuriated at
the article which appeared on
the front page of Number 19 this
year about the lack of a Gaities
this year.
So Johnnie Scott, "already a
writer and poet of national repu
tation" is angry that his script
was scrapped. He is angry that
no music had yet been written
to his lyrics. He is angry that

Mr. Scott submitted his script
towards the middle of August,
two full months after the initial
dead-line date. Nothing could be
done, of course, with the show
until a script was present, and
this lateness put a great pres
sure on the production staff
leaving them with three months
to write music, orchestrate same,
cast parts, rehearse, design sets
and costumes, organize publicity,
and all the rest that goes into a
major production.
This, however, was not our
entire set of problems. The
script was terrible. It was con
troversial, sure, but I'm not
knocking that. The technique of
writing was so terrible that ma
jor revisions were necessary.
Secondly, the lyrics submitted
with the script were a set of un
singable poetry—good in their
own right but not adaptable to
the genre of music. These, too,
were to be rewritten.
So Ram's Head found them
selves holding a bag of insur
mountable tasks and not much
time. Sure, a show of this topic,
although not related to Big
Game, would draw a great num
ber of the interested people. But
any show, even Gaities, must be
done completely with high-lustre
polish which Mr. Scott's late
script did not provide.

It is a very strange experi

with an accusation such as the
DAILY labeled against Ram's
Head and its members today.
It is perhaps an even stranger
experience to be informed, via
the news media, of one's own
.motives for certain past ac
♦ionc ocTwiaiiy if these motives

six months on the issue now at
hand.
Last spring, the Ram's Head
Board contacted Johnie Scott
and Bob Fletcher regarding a
script for 1968 Gaieties. Mr. Scott
informed Ram's Head of the na
ture of the proposed script, and
the ideas were warmly received.
No statements such as "This
play is racist and immoral" were
said in the discussion at that
time, nor ever in any of the fol
lowing discussions of the script;
on the contrary, the Board voted
unanimously in 112 a v or of the
script, and its director, Bob
Fletcher.
This fall, we met again and
voted, this time not to produce
a Gaities. For those of us who
love Ram's Head, it was a hard
thing to do. The prospect of
producing Mr. Scott's script was
an exciting and challenging one,
and the enthusiasm of the Board
for the project was consistently
high. These and only these facts
were presented to the Board;
Never once was the content of
the show under discussion.
1. Having heard Mr. Flet
cher's resignation a few min
utes before, we did not have
and could not find a director
for anything, much less for a
serious, thoughtful work of
drama such as Mr. Scott's
script.
2. Gaities was scheduled to
go on in six weeks.
3. Ram's Head is currently
$1,500 in debt.
4. Half of our production
staff had resigned because of
personal conflicts with the di
rector.
5. We had no music, and we
did not know of anyone will
ing and capable of writing a

full musical score in two weeks.
DAILY writers McGuire and
Wong were informed of these
facts. I would be interested to
know if they would have ad
vised us to produce a show,
ANY show under these circum
stances.
But as we voted against Gaie
ties, we never once retracted our
votes for Johnie Scott's project.
At the very same meeting,
Ram's Head decided to spend
the better half of fall quarter
assembling sufficient financial
credit and technical staff to re
deem our position.
We will be assigned two MFA
drama department directors next
quarter. Because of its belief
in the project, and because of
its concern and sympathy with
the Black Cause, Ram's Head
voted to give first priority to
the effort to produce Johnie
