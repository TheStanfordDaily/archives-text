### BILL LELAND ALAN STRAIN 
The previous columns have laid the ground work for today's
discussion of the special problems of the first and second year
graduate student.
In a few cases, he will be eligible for the I-S(C). His other hope
for deferment in order to complete his graduate work is to be
classified 11-A.
Secion 1622.22(a) of the Regulations Code reads, " In Class 11-A
shall be placed any registrant whose employment in industry, or
other occupation of employment, ... or whose activity in research,
or medical, scientific or other endeavors is found to be necessary
to the maintenance of the national health, safety, or interest."
The SSS further leaves "each local board with discretion to
grant, in individual cases, occupational deferments based on a
showing of essential community need." The 11-A classification
is most usually applied to individuals in full-time employment
which is in the national interest or community need.
However, the phrase "or other endeavors" gives the local board
the discretion to give a broad interpretation to the qualifications
for the 11-A. In a few cases local boards express this discretion to
the favor of the registrant.
Given the manner in which eligibility for the 11-A is being deter
mined, science students appear to have a clear advantage over stu
dents in the humanities.
Each student must examine his present situation to determine
what case he can present in order to convince his local board that
his activity is in the national interest or community need. For ex
ample, if he is doing 40 hours of research each week on cancer
cells or liquid fuels for missiles supported by the National Institutes
of Health, or NASA, he may be able to convince his local board
that he should be defered.
In such cases, a full description of his activity and responsibilities
as well as supporting letters from his advisor or department chair
man may be helpful. In all cases there are unique factors to be
considered.
A few teaching assistants and research assistants have received
11-A classifications. If the local board determines that the registrant
is eligible for the 11-A, the fact that he is also a student does not
prohibit them from granting the 11-A.
A first- or second-year graduate student is advised to consider
the above, while understanding that pursuing a 11-A may be a
slim hope. However, as a minimal consideration, the early presen
tation of one's case to the local board may encourage the board
to act favorably on a future request for postponement of induction.
