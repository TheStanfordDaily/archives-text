ould like to vote against these

"You may have something
here, Frankenheimer."

"I know I do. Not only are
\mericans confused about whom
:o vote for, but they're not sure
■vhen they vote that they're real
y voting for the person they
hink they're voting for. The
people say a vote for Wal
ace is a vote for Humphrey; the
lumphrey people say that a
ote for Nixon is a vote for
Vallace, and the Wallace people
ay a vote for Humphrey is a
ote for anarchy."
"It's "not easy to be a voter
lese days," I had to agree.
"The simplest thing," Frank
nheimer said, "is to let people
ist their ballots ag-ainst Hum
t hrey, against Nixon or against
Wallace. In that way we'd know
where the people really stand.
"The beauty of it," Franken
heimer said, warming up to his
idea, "is that you would only at
tend the rallies of the candidate
you most object to, and you
would only work for the man
you wished to defeat."
"It would give you something
to work for."
"The negative vote plan would

solve the financial problems of
the candidates," Frankenhelmer
said. "People would much rather
give money to defeat someone
than donate it to a lukewarm
candidate whom they think
they're for."
"If the electorate only showed
up at rallies of candidates they
were against," I said, "it would
cut the speeches in half."
"They're doing it now on a
modest scale with hecklers,"
Frankenheimer said, "so that's
why I know it will work. An
other reason why I believe the
negative vote has merit is that
it will get young people inter
ested in politics again. Most of
them opted out when McCarthy
was defeated in Chicago. But if
they were given the opportunity
to work for the defeat of Hum
phrey, Nixon or Wallace, the
young people would all be back
in fox-ce, and you'd have a real
sense of participation in politics
again."
"How would it work?" I
asked.
"On Nov. 5 the voters would
go to their precincts and choose
the lever which read 'Against
Nixon,' 'Against Humphrey' or
'Against Wallace.' After the

vote was tallied, the candidate
who got the least amount of
votes would then become Presi
dent of the United States. But
he would have to have an abso
lute minority to win, or it would
go to the House."
"I know whom I want to vote
against right now," I said.
"Of course you do," said
Frankenheimer. "Everyone does.
Give the American people some
one to vote against and they'll
come out in droves. Even if the
candidate they voted against
wins, they'll still feel better for
having shown how they feel
about him. If nothing else, the
negative vote could get this
country out of the mental de
pression it's been in since the
presidential campaign began."

people say a vote for Wal
ace is a vote for Humphrey; the

Vallace, and the Wallace people

"It's "not easy to be a voter
lese days," I had to agree.
"The simplest thing," Frank
nheimer said, "is to let people
ist their ballots ag-ainst Hum
t hrey, against Nixon or against
Wallace. In that way we'd know
where the people really stand.
"The beauty of it," Franken
heimer said, warming up to his
idea, "is that you would only at
tend the rallies of the candidate
you most object to, and you
would only work for the man
you wished to defeat."
"It would give you something
to work for."
"The negative vote plan would

solve the financial problems of
the candidates," Frankenhelmer
said. "People would much rather
give money to defeat someone
than donate it to a lukewarm
candidate whom they think
they're for."
"If the electorate only showed
up at rallies of candidates they
were against," I said, "it would
cut the speeches in half."
"They're doing it now on a
modest scale with hecklers,"
Frankenheimer said, "so that's
why I know it will work. An
other reason why I believe the
negative vote has merit is that
it will get young people inter
ested in politics again. Most of
them opted out when McCarthy
was defeated in Chicago. But if
they were given the opportunity
to work for the defeat of Hum
phrey, Nixon or Wallace, the
young people would all be back
in fox-ce, and you'd have a real
sense of participation in politics
again."
"How would it work?" I
asked.
"On Nov. 5 the voters would
go to their precincts and choose
the lever which read 'Against
Nixon,' 'Against Humphrey' or
'Against Wallace.' After the

vote was tallied, the candidate
who got the least amount of
votes would then become Presi
dent of the United States. But
he would have to have an abso
lute minority to win, or it would
go to the House."
"I know whom I want to vote
against right now," I said.
"Of course you do," said
Frankenheimer. "Everyone does.
Give the American people some
one to vote against and they'll
come out in droves. Even if the
candidate they voted against
wins, they'll still feel better for
having shown how they feel
about him. If nothing else, the
negative vote could get this
country out of the mental de
pression it's been in since the
presidential campaign began."
