I Crime in the streets, marijuana in the schools, civil disobedienceâ€”these
are aspects of what appears to be a breakdown of social control. It is the
criminal sanction, the imposition of punshment for the violation of
criminal statutes, that constitutes our primary control over behavior
defined as antisocial.
But can the criminal sanction do the job? How do we decide that a certain
kind of conduct ought to be subjected to it? What are the reasonable
limits of the criminal sanction? And what are the alternatives to its use
II in the case of prostitution, narcotics offenses, and other conduct now
HgUHI questionably subject to criminal prosecution?
In the author's words, "We can have as much or as little crime as we
please, depending on what we choose to count as criminal." What we
cannot afford is a syste of criminal law that is out of touch with society's
values and beyond its capacity to maintain.
