# New Policy Set For Admissions
## 
### DOUGLAS ANDERSON 
Could a violin virtuoso be ad
mitted to Stanford next year
without a high school back
ground in science, math, or for
eign language?
A more flexible policy govern
ing freshman admissions re
quirements has been adopted by
the Academic Senate, which
would make this possible.
The new policy which will be
effective for 1969 applicants, but
primarily directed at the candi
dates of 1970, will give greater
latitude in subject requirements
for incoming freshmen, and thus
allow a greater diversity and
creativeness in the Stanford ap
plicant pool.
The policy statement which
was prepared by the Committee
on Undergraduate Admissions,
of which Herbert Solomon is
chairman, stresses the following
requirements:
"Stanford has no rigid sub
ject requirements for admis
sion. The study program a
student chooses is one of
several elements in the ad
mission decision and it is
reviewed as indicating both
his academic preparation
and his creative develop
ment. The best secondary
school preparation for Stan
ford is the strongest possible
background in English (in
cluding extensive training in
writing), mathematics and
one foreign language, to
gether with courses in both
science and social studies."
Requirements Replaced
The policy replaces a more
rigid pattern of high school
courses previously required for
admission. In prior years these
subjects and units have been re
quired:
"English, three units, math
two; foreign language (an
cient or modern), two; lab
oratory science, one; and
seven remaining units from
any of these noted, including
social sciences, and a maxi
mum of one unit of fine
arts." â€” bringing the total
to fifteen units.
Originally the former policy
was designed to insure a sound
background for the college
preparatory student. Academic
Senate members, however, have
found these requirements too
restrictive.
Too Restrictive
According to Dean of Admis
sions, Rixford K. Snyder: " . . .
the required four year high
school college preparatory
course of at least 15 units is too
restrictive and thus discourages
the fine arts of creative student
from applying to Stanford."
Director of Freshman Admis
sions, Douglas R. Walker is even

more explicit in denunciation of
the former policy. "The policy
requiring fifteen units . . . has
worked to straight-jacket the ap
plicant and the admissions of
fice," Walker said.
"In fact, in the last eight
years the admissions office has
often waived the requirements
to admit those students with
demonstrated ability who are de
ficient in one or more areas of
the required fifteen units."
Clarify Position
Walker further said that the
new policy will basically clarify
the position the admissions of
fice has held in the past.
Walker pointed out that with
in the last ten years high school
teaching is better, teacher train
ing has improved, secondary
school curriculum has been up
graded appreciably and better
academic counseling now exists.
He added that it is probable
that the majority of applicants
will still have fulfilled the fif
teen units in preparation. "How
ever, we don't want to lose those
especially creative potential stu
dents by an admission require
ment that is too restrictive."
New Policy In Catalog
The new policy will appear in
the next university admissions
requirements catalog to be re
leased in May and thus will have
its greatest impact on present
high school freshmen, who will
have more flexibility in choosing
their course of studies.
The policy allows high schools
greater latitude in their require
ments and is much in keeping
with admissions requirements at
many of Stanofrd's sister insti
tutions according to a survey
conducted last year by Profes
sors Richard C. Atkinson (psy
chology) and Charles N. Fifer
(English).
