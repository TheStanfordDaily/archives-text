# WORLD RESPONDS TO SDS POLL
## 
### Members of Stanford SDS 
Early Monday morning members of the Stanford Students for
a Democratic Society made a poll of a representative sample of the
people of the world.
The two questions asked were:
1. Do you support the demands of the Stanford chapter of the
Students for a Democratic Society that Stanford and its subsidiary
SRI stop killing you?
2. Do you plan to participate in SDS's demonstrations?
The results of the poll were in startling contrast to the one in
the Stanford Daily (10/14/68). An overwhelming majority of the
people questioned voted yes. On the first question, 85.4% of the
3,024,943,210 people of the world responded in the affirmative.
73.1% responded positively to the second question.
Many other members of the world community couldn't vote in
Monday's poll, but their surviving relatives expressed solidarity.
As one African, who asked not to be identified by name, country,
or race, said, "We are with you, brothers and sisters of America.
Do whatever you can to bring the mother down."
Probably the most heartening response came from Chairman
Mao Jse-tung of China.
"The 700,000,00 people of China wish to vote in proxy in your
poll. We must emphasize, however, that although we support your
just demands, we cannot go along with your tactics," he said.
When we explained that we only intended to engage in peaceful
protest he said, "Yes, that's exactly what I'm complaining about."
