### TIM HAIGHT 
Ever since FSM in 1964, our
generation's protest groups have
been called "negative." We do
not propose constructive alterna
tives, they say. We only knock.
This argument continues up to
this moment. Humphrey calls us
"anarchists" and "nihilists".
Even Dr. Philip Rhinelander of
this campus has trotted out this
old tired horse in the current
"Stanford" issue of Per/Se. In
response to this, let me lay my
Utopian trip on you. •
The first, and only, rule of the
Utopia is that everybody be free
to do as he wishes as long as he
does not harm anybody else.
From this assumption, several
corollaries follow:
(1) Diversity: There would be
no single, Platonic model for
the good society. There would
be many communities, as many
as came together naturally.
(2) Basic power of life-sup
port: Every individual would
have to be assured access to a
generous supply of material
goods—through a guaranteed in
come or a supply of basic goods
at no cost.
(3) Freedom from unwanted
work: Once every individual had
his basic necessities guaranteed,
he would have to work only
when he wanted to work. Bor
ing alienating work could be au
tomated, since "full" employ
ment would no longer be a so
cial necessity. The labor market
would become a free market and
not a choice of various econom
ic slaveries.
(4) An end to homo consu
mens: Since full employment

would no longer be necessary,
demand would not have to be
artificially stimulated to keep
the economy in Keynesian bal
ance. This would mean the per
sonality type who buys things
to bury his boredom would no
longer be encouraged in our so
ciety. It also means factories
could build things without de
signing them to break down or
go out of style.
(6) A new role for education:
Either the present university
would be freed from the neces
sity to create the innovators for
the eternally expanding econo
my and be able to turn to a
wholehearted investigation of
the proper conduct of man, or
professors and students could
form their own communities for
this purpose while living on
their guaranteed wages. Perhaps
both.
(7) A non-contradictory move
toward world peace: The
changes in the economy the
wage would permit would les
sen the power of the great cor
porations. Further, the examples
of free people (not harassed by
society as were the hippies but
supported by it) could show
current or aspiring executives
alternatives to self-definition
through economic empire-build
ing.
Further, what imperialism re
mained after this could be lim
ited by the government in the
name of the basic principle of
freedom within the limits of not
doing harm.
Men of good will in this coun
try could have time to help set
free other countries who wanted
assistance. Since Americans
would no longer have vested in
terests in the kind of economic
or political system of other so
cieties, and since their own ef
forts at becoming human might
lessen that incredible American
desire to make everybody like
them, real progress might be
possible.
(9) Freedom from racism: Ac
cording to Carmichael and Ham
ilton, racism is "the predication
of decisions and policies on con
siderations of race for the pur
pose of subordinating a racial
group and maintaining control
over that group." Since the bas
ic economic guarantee would be
to all Americans, minority
groups would be economically
free to celebrate their own cul
ture and/or to join with white
Americans who can get their
heads straight.
These proposals could go on
and on. Right now, they prob
ably look pretty incomplete.
They are. This is not The Re
public; this Utopia is an ever
developing pattern. But it does
indicate that we may be able to
think in these terms, rather
than simply issue-by-issue or in
terms of protest.
Where the protest comes in,
however, is when we find an
swers to the question, "Who or
what is keeping this kind of
Utopia from coming about?"

Probably certain personality
types have risen to power be
cause of their personalities. It is
not likely that these people
would truly redistribute (share)
that power because of their au
thoritarian hangups.
Issue-by-issue thinking tends
to reinforce the status quo be
cause it does not allow the root
of the issue to be seen in the
status quo itself. Perhaps this
is why Utopian thinkers usually
get Nowhere. Perhaps this is
why when we protest for peace,
they call us "negative" for op
posing war.

The first, and only, rule of the
Utopia is that everybody be free
to do as he wishes as long as he
does not harm anybody else.
From this assumption, several
corollaries follow:
(1) Diversity: There would be
no single, Platonic model for
the good society. There would
be many communities, as many
as came together naturally.
(2) Basic power of life-sup
port: Every individual would
have to be assured access to a
generous supply of material
goods—through a guaranteed in
come or a supply of basic goods
at no cost.
(3) Freedom from unwanted
work: Once every individual had
his basic necessities guaranteed,
he would have to work only
when he wanted to work. Bor
ing alienating work could be au
tomated, since "full" employ
ment would no longer be a so
cial necessity. The labor market
would become a free market and
not a choice of various econom
ic slaveries.
(4) An end to homo consu
mens: Since full employment

would no longer be necessary,
demand would not have to be
artificially stimulated to keep
the economy in Keynesian bal
ance. This would mean the per
sonality type who buys things
to bury his boredom would no
longer be encouraged in our so
ciety. It also means factories
could build things without de
signing them to break down or
go out of style.
(6) A new role for education:
Either the present university
would be freed from the neces
sity to create the innovators for
the eternally expanding econo
my and be able to turn to a
wholehearted investigation of
the proper conduct of man, or
professors and students could
form their own communities for
this purpose while living on
their guaranteed wages. Perhaps
both.
(7) A non-contradictory move
toward world peace: The
changes in the economy the
wage would permit would les
sen the power of the great cor
porations. Further, the examples
of free people (not harassed by
society as were the hippies but
supported by it) could show
current or aspiring executives
alternatives to self-definition
through economic empire-build
ing.
Further, what imperialism re
mained after this could be lim
ited by the government in the
name of the basic principle of
freedom within the limits of not
doing harm.
Men of good will in this coun
try could have time to help set
free other countries who wanted
assistance. Since Americans
would no longer have vested in
terests in the kind of economic
or political system of other so
cieties, and since their own ef
forts at becoming human might
lessen that incredible American
desire to make everybody like
them, real progress might be
possible.
(9) Freedom from racism: Ac
cording to Carmichael and Ham
ilton, racism is "the predication
of decisions and policies on con
siderations of race for the pur
pose of subordinating a racial
group and maintaining control
over that group." Since the bas
ic economic guarantee would be
to all Americans, minority
groups would be economically
free to celebrate their own cul
ture and/or to join with white
Americans who can get their
heads straight.
These proposals could go on
and on. Right now, they prob
ably look pretty incomplete.
They are. This is not The Re
public; this Utopia is an ever
developing pattern. But it does
indicate that we may be able to
think in these terms, rather
than simply issue-by-issue or in
terms of protest.
Where the protest comes in,
however, is when we find an
swers to the question, "Who or
what is keeping this kind of
Utopia from coming about?"

Probably certain personality
types have risen to power be
cause of their personalities. It is
not likely that these people
would truly redistribute (share)
that power because of their au
thoritarian hangups.
Issue-by-issue thinking tends
to reinforce the status quo be
cause it does not allow the root
of the issue to be seen in the
status quo itself. Perhaps this
is why Utopian thinkers usually
get Nowhere. Perhaps this is
why when we protest for peace,
they call us "negative" for op
posing war.
Ever since FSM in 1964, our
generation's protest groups have
been called "negative." We do
not propose constructive alterna
tives, they say. We only knock.

The first, and only, rule of the
Utopia is that everybody be free
to do as he wishes as long as he
does not harm anybody else.
From this assumption, several
corollaries follow:
(1) Diversity: There would be
no single, Platonic model for
the good society. There would
be many communities, as many
as came together naturally.
(2) Basic power of life-sup
port: Every individual would
have to be assured access to a
generous supply of material
goods—through a guaranteed in
come or a supply of basic goods
at no cost.
(3) Freedom from unwanted
work: Once every individual had
his basic necessities guaranteed,
he would have to work only
when he wanted to work. Bor
ing alienating work could be au
tomated, since "full" employ
ment would no longer be a so
cial necessity. The labor market
would become a free market and
not a choice of various econom
ic slaveries.
(4) An end to homo consu
mens: Since full employment

would no longer be necessary,
demand would not have to be
artificially stimulated to keep
the economy in Keynesian bal
ance. This would mean the per
sonality type who buys things
to bury his boredom would no
longer be encouraged in our so
ciety. It also means factories
could build things without de
signing them to break down or
go out of style.
(6) A new role for education:
Either the present university
would be freed from the neces
sity to create the innovators for
the eternally expanding econo
my and be able to turn to a
wholehearted investigation of
the proper conduct of man, or
professors and students could
form their own communities for
this purpose while living on
their guaranteed wages. Perhaps
both.
(7) A non-contradictory move
toward world peace: The
changes in the economy the
wage would permit would les
sen the power of the great cor
porations. Further, the examples
of free people (not harassed by
society as were the hippies but
supported by it) could show
current or aspiring executives
alternatives to self-definition
through economic empire-build
ing.
Further, what imperialism re
mained after this could be lim
ited by the government in the
name of the basic principle of
freedom within the limits of not
doing harm.
Men of good will in this coun
try could have time to help set
free other countries who wanted
assistance. Since Americans
would no longer have vested in
terests in the kind of economic
or political system of other so
cieties, and since their own ef
forts at becoming human might
lessen that incredible American
desire to make everybody like
them, real progress might be
possible.
(9) Freedom from racism: Ac
cording to Carmichael and Ham
ilton, racism is "the predication
of decisions and policies on con
siderations of race for the pur
pose of subordinating a racial
group and maintaining control
over that group." Since the bas
ic economic guarantee would be
to all Americans, minority
groups would be economically
free to celebrate their own cul
ture and/or to join with white
Americans who can get their
heads straight.
These proposals could go on
and on. Right now, they prob
ably look pretty incomplete.
They are. This is not The Re
public; this Utopia is an ever
developing pattern. But it does
indicate that we may be able to
think in these terms, rather
than simply issue-by-issue or in
terms of protest.
Where the protest comes in,
however, is when we find an
swers to the question, "Who or
what is keeping this kind of
Utopia from coming about?"

Probably certain personality
types have risen to power be
cause of their personalities. It is
not likely that these people
would truly redistribute (share)
that power because of their au
thoritarian hangups.
Issue-by-issue thinking tends
to reinforce the status quo be
cause it does not allow the root
of the issue to be seen in the
status quo itself. Perhaps this
is why Utopian thinkers usually
get Nowhere. Perhaps this is
why when we protest for peace,
they call us "negative" for op
posing war.
Ever since FSM in 1964, our
generation's protest groups have
been called "negative." We do
not propose constructive alterna
tives, they say. We only knock.
This argument continues up to
this moment. Humphrey calls us
"anarchists" and "nihilists".
Even Dr. Philip Rhinelander of
this campus has trotted out this
old tired horse in the current
"Stanford" issue of Per/Se. In
