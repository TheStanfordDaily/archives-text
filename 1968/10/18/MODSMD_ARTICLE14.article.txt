# Adlai Stevenson III To Speak At Anti-Violence Conference
## 
### 
"The appearance of club
wielding police, the machine
guns, the bloodshed, indiscrim
inate brutality and senseless ar
rests" escalated the violence at
the Chicago Democratic Conven
tion, claims Adlai Stevenson 111,
an Illinois delegate and present
ly Illinois State Treasurer.
Stevenson said that the con
frontation between the police
and the protesters became in
evitable when the city closed
"the doors to legitimate dissent
and peaceful assembly.'
Stevenson will be the guest
speaker at a Peninsula Issue
Conference dealing with the
"Politics of Confrontation." It
will be held on Saturday from
2 to 4 p.m. hi Bishop Auditorium
in the Graduate School of Bus
iness. Admission is free.
John Vasconcellos, Democratic
Assemblyman in the 24th Dis
trict, will be the chairman of
the panel. He now serves on the
Committee on Education, the
Committee on Municipal and
County Government, and the
Committee of Criminal Proced
ure. He was a California dele
gate to the Democratic National
Convention.

Included on the panel is James
Simmons, Vice Provost in
Charge of Community Relations
at Stanford. He is also Chairman
of the Stanford Faculty For
Humphrey.
There are three faculty mem
bers on the panel, Philip Zim
bardo, Michael Otten, and Paul
Verden.
Zimbardo, a psychologist at
Stanford, was formerly at Col
umbia University and is famil
iar with the recent student riot.
He is the author of the article
"Psychology of Police Confes
sioins" published in Psychology
Today.
Otten just completed his Ph.D.
dissertation "Paternalism to
Private Government: Patterns
of Universit Authority over Stu
dents" at Berkeley. He is now a
professor of Sociology at San
Jose State College.
Verden is both a sociology
professor at the University of
Santa Clara and a nonfiction
writer. The topics of his articles
range from"the Humor of
Lenny Bruce" to youth com
munes.

Two students, James Shock
and Kathy Johnson, will repre
sent student opinions on the
panel. Shock is a member of Stu
dents for a Democratic Society
(SDS) and the East Palo Alto
Community House. He partici
pated in the Michigan Avenue
confrontation this summer in
Chicago.
Johnson was formerly a Mc-
Carthy worker. She now man
ages the Los Altos Headquarters
of the Committee for a New
Democratic Policy.
The conference will begin with
short speeches by Vasconcellos,
the six panelists, and Stevenson.
The panelists may then question
Stevenson. The audience will
then have the opportunity to
question Stevenson and the
panel.
By confronting the issues in
volved in Chicago, the confer
ence hopes to investigate the
causes of the disorder and per
haps find means for avoiding
further violence. Stevenson ex
pects that people will ultimately
realize "that justive never can
rest on the end of a nightstick."
