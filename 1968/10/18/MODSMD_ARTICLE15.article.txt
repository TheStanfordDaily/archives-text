# Freshman Seminars
## 
### 
Applications for the Winter-
Quarter Freshman Seminar Se
ries are now available from
Ilene Weeks, in room 241 C.
The program will offer more
than 23 courses ranging in top
ics from "Analysis and Criti
cism of Popular Culture," taught
by Professor Breitrose of the
Communications Department, to
"African History" which will be
led by Professor Johnson of the
Department of History.
Groups will meet over the
two-quarter period, and each
seminar will carry three units of
academic credit per quarter. As
in the Fall-Winter seminar se
ries, classes will be small; no
more than eight students will be
admitted to each course.
The seminar program is now
in its fourth year, and the num
ber of student applicants has
continued to increase. Last quar
ter, over 725 students applied
for the 296 available positions.
Candidates were chosen at ran
dom although an effort was
made to retain a co-educational
balance.
