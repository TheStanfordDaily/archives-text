• Swimmers Hit Gold
MEXICO CITY (AP) — U.S.
swimming forces splashed to a
perfect, record-smashing start
in the Olympics with two gold
medals Thursday after Willie
Davenport won the 110-meter
hurdles and U.S. officials apolo
gized for a black American ra
cial protest in an award cere
mony.
The trio of golds gave the
United States nine for the five
day-old Games. The U.S. also
has three silvers and five
bronzes for a total of 17.
A quartet of teen-age girls ig

Kaye Hall of Tacoma, Wash.,
Catie Ball of Jacksonville, Fla.,
Ellie Daniels of Elkins Park,
Pa., and Sue Pederson of Sacra
mento, Calif., completed the
race in 4:28.3, eclipsing the
Olympic record and the listed
world mark.
Then, when the waters of the
Olympic pool had subsided, the
men's 400-meter freestyle relay

flashed to a second double rec
ord, winning in 3:31.7.
The quartet of Zach Zorn of
Buena Park, Calif., Steve Re
rych of Paterson, N.J., Mark
Spitz of Santa Clara, Calif., and
Ken Walsh of Ponte Vedra,
Calif., shattered the world rec
ord by nearly a full second.
Back at Olympic Stadium, Da

silver medals for the hurdles
with no trace of the controver

John Carlos of San Jose State

MEXICO CITY (AP) — U.S.

MEXICO CITY (AP) — U.S.

• Swimmers Hit Gold
MEXICO CITY (AP) — U.S.
swimming forces splashed to a
perfect, record-smashing start
in the Olympics with two gold
medals Thursday after Willie
Davenport won the 110-meter
hurdles and U.S. officials apolo
gized for a black American ra
cial protest in an award cere
mony.
The trio of golds gave the
United States nine for the five
day-old Games. The U.S. also
has three silvers and five
bronzes for a total of 17.
A quartet of teen-age girls ig
nited what is expected to be a
lush harvest of gold medals with
a narrow but double record vic

Kaye Hall of Tacoma, Wash.,
Catie Ball of Jacksonville, Fla.,
Ellie Daniels of Elkins Park,
Pa., and Sue Pederson of Sacra

race in 4:28.3, eclipsing the
Olympic record and the listed
world mark.
Then, when the waters of the
Olympic pool had subsided, the
men's 400-meter freestyle relay

flashed to a second double rec
ord, winning in 3:31.7.
The quartet of Zach Zorn of
Buena Park, Calif., Steve Re
rych of Paterson, N.J., Mark
Spitz of Santa Clara, Calif., and
Ken Walsh of Ponte Vedra,
Calif., shattered the world rec

Back at Olympic Stadium, Da

silver medals for the hurdles
with no trace of the controver

John Carlos of San Jose State

night.
After meeting for about five
hours, the U.S. Olympic Commit

of Smith and Carlos and warned
that any similar act might bring
stern disciplinary measures.
"I am embarrassed; ail of us

• Political Roundup
Richard M. Nixon said Thurs
day that if President Johnson
orders a halt in the bombing of
North Vietnam, Republicans will
support him.
The GOP presidential nomi
nee, campaigning in Rochester,
N.Y., said it was up to Johnson
to decide whether a bombing
pause would improve peace
prospects, but added that if the
President makes that judgment,
"We will support him."
Vice President Hubert H.
Humphrey campaigned in De

many workers favor third party
candidate George C. Wallace
because they think Humphrey
favors Negroes.
The Democratic presidential
nominee, said, however, that if
he is elected, there will be
enough jobs to go around for
both Negroes and whites.
Humphrey's campaign in New

Wallace campaigned in Texas,

"you've asserted your man
hood." Later, admitting he was
tired, Wallace canceled appear

and headed for home. He said

he planned to go to Washington
Saturday and meet there with
his running mate, retired Air

LeMay, meanwhile, flew from

Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of

called on his audiences to de

Gov. Spiro T. Agnew of Mary

the country was "on the verge
of a potential nuclear catas
