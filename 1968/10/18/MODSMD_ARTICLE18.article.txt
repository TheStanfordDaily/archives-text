# To Replace 'Gaieties'
## MAFIA Play Opens 
### 
Stanford's own MAFIA starts
its third year of operation Satur
day night with rarely performed
presentations of Murray Schis
gal's The Tiger and Lanford
Wilson's Home Free.
The MAFIA, no crime syndi
cate, is actually a producing or
ganization of Master of Fine

Arts students in the Speech and
Drama Department Those who
remember the old MAFIA of the
past two years will note that
some important changes have
been made.
The MAFIA will no longer be
mainly improvisational and the
ater game work. It will produce

one-act or full length plays in
order to present more works of
artistic merit. However, it will
also try to keep the intimate and
casual mood it has been famous
for by presenting a new, audi
ence-involved program on the
first and third Saturday of every
month.
All shows start at 11:30 p.m.
in the Nitery. A donation of 50
cents is requested which will en
title the audience to free peanut
butter, jelly, and cracker good
ies at intermission.
In addition to weekly perform
ances, the MAFIA will also pro
duce the Big Game Show, A
Funny Thing Happened on the
Way to the Forum. Realizing
over a week ago that Ram's
Head, which is usually in charge
of the show, would definitely not
be producing a Gaieties this
year, MAFIA successfully found
financial backing and a produc
tion staff to do the show. Ram's
Head will resume responsibility
for the show next year.
The decision to take over the
Big Game Show was based on
several factors. Some of the
MAFIA students had partici
pated in Gaieties as undergrad
uates and did not want to see
the only long standing tradition
in theater at Stanford disappear.
Gaieties have always given
students the opportunity and en
joyment to work on a show
whether they were experienced
and serious about drama or not
Also, MAFIA hopes to make a
profit on the Big Game show in
order to be able to keep on pro
ducing plays for Stanford Audi
ences at minimal costs.
Students interested in working
on Forum may come to Tresid
der Large Lounge this Sunday
from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. To be
chosen are actors, singers, dan
cers, a rock combo, and crews
for costumes, lights, sets, props,
and publicity. Actors and ac
tresses are requested to bring a
small photo, if possible, and to
be prepared to sing a solo. Call
backs will be at 5 p.m. the same
day.
