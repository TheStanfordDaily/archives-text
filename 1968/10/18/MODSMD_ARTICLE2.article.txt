# Hayes, Trustees Confer; War Contracts Questioned
## 
### 
Student Body President Denis
Hayes yesterday recommended
that Stanford Research Institute
accept no new research con
tracts involving chemical, bio
logical, or counter-insurrection
ary warfare pending the out
come of the study of its rela
tionship to the University.
His recommendation was pre
sented during committee meet
ings of the Stanford Board of
Trustees, who held the first in
a new quarterly series of meet
ings on campus yesterday.
Hayes appeared in response to
a trustee invitation.
In his talk with the trustees,
Hayes also suggested that stu
dents be included in trustee
committees as soon as possible,
particularly those concerned
with academic affairs and fi
nance. The Trustees Committee
indicated it would invite individ
ual faculty members broadly
knowledgeable in finance and
economics to attend particular
meetings.
Early this fall, the Stanford
chapter of the American Asso
ciation of University Professors
(AAUP) recommended that stu
dents, faculty, and staff have
"direct, formal mechanisms" for
communication with the trus
tees.
About 40 students gathered
outside Bowman Alumni House
early yesterday afternoon and
shared coffee and conversation
with the trustees before their
formal session.
When their session began,

LASSU speaker Yale Braunstein
spoke briefly with the trustees
at their request.
Afterwards, he said he had
urged the trustees to seek bet
ter communication with stu
dents, indicating they could
benefit from receiving student
comments before decisions were
reached. He suggested the trus
tees invite all those outside the
building to attend the session,
but the board declined to do so.
Braunstein said his appear
ance was "an interesting oppor
tunity" but added: "It's a shame
that only one person was able
to go in and make a presenta
tion."

In a talk with the trustees
Thursday morning, Hayes
praised faculty representatives
for voting to have faculty sub
ject to the same judicial group
as students in cases involving
alleged violations of several
rules on campus disruption.
Noting that several trustees
have privately told him they now
feel students might have made
a valuable contribution to se
lection of a new university pres
ident, Hayes suggested that they
endorse student participation in
selection of future presidents.
This idea was voiced earlier by
the Stanford AAUP.

ciation of University Professors
(AAUP) recommended that stu
dents, faculty, and staff have
"direct, formal mechanisms" for
communication with the trus
tees.
About 40 students gathered
outside Bowman Alumni House
early yesterday afternoon and
shared coffee and conversation
with the trustees before their
formal session.
When their session began,

LASSU speaker Yale Braunstein
spoke briefly with the trustees
at their request.
Afterwards, he said he had
urged the trustees to seek bet
ter communication with stu
dents, indicating they could
benefit from receiving student
comments before decisions were
reached. He suggested the trus
tees invite all those outside the
building to attend the session,
but the board declined to do so.
Braunstein said his appear
ance was "an interesting oppor
tunity" but added: "It's a shame
that only one person was able
to go in and make a presenta
tion."

In a talk with the trustees
Thursday morning, Hayes
praised faculty representatives
for voting to have faculty sub
ject to the same judicial group
as students in cases involving
alleged violations of several
rules on campus disruption.
Noting that several trustees
have privately told him they now
feel students might have made
a valuable contribution to se
lection of a new university pres
ident, Hayes suggested that they
endorse student participation in
selection of future presidents.
This idea was voiced earlier by
the Stanford AAUP.

Student Body President Denis
Hayes yesterday recommended
that Stanford Research Institute
accept no new research con
tracts involving chemical, bio
logical, or counter-insurrection
ary warfare pending the out
come of the study of its rela
tionship to the University.
His recommendation was pre
sented during committee meet
ings of the Stanford Board of
Trustees, who held the first in
a new quarterly series of meet
ings on campus yesterday.
Hayes appeared in response to
a trustee invitation.
In his talk with the trustees,
Hayes also suggested that stu
dents be included in trustee
committees as soon as possible,
particularly those concerned
with academic affairs and fi
nance. The Trustees Committee
indicated it would invite individ
ual faculty members broadly
knowledgeable in finance and
economics to attend particular
meetings.
Early this fall, the Stanford
chapter of the American Asso
ciation of University Professors
(AAUP) recommended that stu
dents, faculty, and staff have
"direct, formal mechanisms" for
communication with the trus
tees.
