## Indians Battle Game Cougars 
### GARY CAVALLI 
Stanford's Indians, who last
weekend played to within a field
goal of the number one team
In the country, will be trying to
get back on the winning track
tomorrow .afternoon at 1:30
when they face Washington
State's Cougars in Spokane.
Three missed Stanford field
goals and three broken plays
which set up USC scores pre
vented Stanford from pulling off
a tremendous upset last Sat
urday, as the Trojans eked out
a 27-24 win. As a result of their
brilliant performance, the In
dians moved up to 12th and 14th
on the national wire service
rankings.
The Cougars, two-touchdown
underdogs, will be hoping for a
letdown on Stanford's part when
the teams meet tomorrow in
Spokane.
Coach John Ralston, well
aware of this danger, feels his
team will be able to pick up the
pieces and come back strong.
"You've got to be let down
after losing a game like that,"
Ralston commented, "but I
think we'll rally together. This
is a very strong team."
ASU Tames Cougars
While Stanford was battling
USC down to the wire last week,
WSU was taking a 41-14 bom
bardment from Arizona State.
Coach Jim Sweeney's forces
nearly matched the Sun Devils
in yards gained and first downs,
but were unable to move once
they got past midfield.
The Cougars operate from a
shotgun offense and have the
Pacific-B's leading passer in se
nior Jerry Henderson. Hender
son has completed 62 of 112
passes for 778 yards, but has yet
to throw a touchdown pass.
Henderson's favorite receiv
,efr< flanker Johnny Davis, is
currently tied for second in the
league with 20 receptions. Davis,

who Stanford coach Ralston
considers "a real dandy," is
averaging 18.5 yards per catch.
Ground Game Stutters
The WSU running game has
not exactly been awesome this
year. Through four games the
Cougars have netted only 263
yards in 173 attempts on the
ground. Tailback Richard Davis
is the leading ballcarrier with
118 yards in 43 attempts.
Defensively, the WSU eleven
may be hurt by the loss of
strong side linebacker Jim Gor
ton, who broke his arm in prac
tice Monday.
A tough Cougar pass defense
led by swift Mark Williams, may
give Tribe quarterback Jim
Plunkett trouble tomorrow. Ac
cording to Ralston, "The Cou
gars have an excellent pass de
fense. They have a multiple type
defense, with a little more zone
than man-to-man."
The Cougar secondary has al
lowed only three touchdowns
passing in three games, yielding
an average of 128 yards per
game through the air.
Buehler Doubtful
Stanford may be without the
services of middle guard George
Buehler tomorrow afternoon.
Buehler, who was in on 15
tackles last weekend and was
voted Pacific-8 "Lineman of the
Week," despite suffering a knee
sprain, was listed by Ralston as
"doubtful for Saturday's game."
Ralston indicated that split
end Jack Lasater, who suffered
a hip pointer against USC, and
linebacker Don Parish, who
sprained his ankle, will both be
ready to go tomorrow.
In his only lineup change,
Ralston announced that Bubba
Brown has moved ahead of
Howie Williams at tailback.
Brown, who has a slight Charley
horse, gained 98 yards against
the Trojans, 51 of them coming
on a brilliant touchdown jaunt.


PLUNKETT FIBES â€” Phil Reinhard (69) provides the protection,

Bob Moore during last week's battle with USC.
