## 
### BOB FEDUNIAK 
Contrary to last Thursday's
story, the frosh counterpart of
last Saturday's Stanford - USC
football game will take place to
day at 2:30 in Stanford Sta
dium.
The game promises to be as
exciting as the varsity contest,
and looks to be another passing
vs. running confrontation.
Only this time it will be Stan
ford's running against USC's
passing. The Papooses plan to
employ a roll-out offense under
the direction of quarterback and
co-captain Miles Moore, an All
american from Santa Maria.
Joining Moore in the starting
backfield will be running backs
Jackie Brown and Hilary Shock
ley, along with flanker Don Al
varado.
The Trobabes will counter
with the passing of Jimmy
Jones, whom Parade magazine
called "the finest prep quarter
back in the nation."
The job of containing Jones
and the rest of the Trobabe at
tack falls on a strong Papoose
defense led by middle linebacker
Jeff Siemon who, with QB
Moore, was recently elected by

his teammates to serve as co
captain for the season.
Coach Jim Troppman looks
for an evenly matched game
between two excellent teams, and
regardless of the outcome, it
should be an exciting first look
at the varsity stars of the fu
ture.
