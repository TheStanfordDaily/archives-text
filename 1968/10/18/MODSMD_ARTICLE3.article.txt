# Stanford Village
## Closely Watched Dorm 
### BARBARA RITZ 
According to the City of Men
lo Park, housing in Stanford
Village has been "temporary"
for the past 22 years.
Instead of being closed down
this year, Stanford Village was
re-activated in September to al
leviate the housing shortage. It
will remain intact until August
1969. At that time the lease ex
pires, and the property goesi
back to its owner, the Stanford
Research Institute, commented
Homer Meaders, SRI Public Re
lations Manager.
Meaders described the SRI
purchase as "hastily-built struc
tures that the government erect
ed during World War II."
What is now Stanford Village
was formerly the Dibble Army
Hospital and a series of army
barracks that became surplus
stock after the War.
Bob Beyer, Assistant to the
City Manager of Menlo Park;
stated that the university pur
chased about 80 acres of land
from the government at $16,040
per acre immediately after the
war. He added that the City of
Menlo Park also purchased land
for their Civic Center.
Improvements Made
Stanford then remodeled the
buildings, installing kitchens
and bathrooms to provide hous
ing for approximately 2000 stu
dents. A shuttle bus service was
also provided to and from the
university.
SRI has been buying portions
of the land over a number of
years, explained Meaders, and
according to a triple agreement
with SRI and Menlo Park, Stan
ford was to have closed the Vil
lage in 1965.
Meaders explained that a "gen
tlemen's agreement" was made
at that time with the City to
extend the apartment section for

another three years to remedy
housing shortages.
The apartment buildings were
never in "first-class shape" said
Meaders, but plans to demolish
them were never effected.
"If you're living in a building,
you aren't going to want to see
it torn down," he remarked.
SRI Takes Over
Gradually buildings have been
de-artivated and sold to SRI and
to the City of Menlo Park. Mea
ders explained that SRI will take
over the property next year for
their long-range building pro
gram "1965 to 1984" in erecting
laboratories and office build
ings.
Edward Scoles, Assistant Bus
iness Manager of the University
Residences, said that the re
maining building #209 was re
activated early in September.
However, few or no people
signed up to live in Stanford
Vil'age the Thursday and Fri
day of Registration Week,
Scoles said, adding that he was
aware a number of graduate stu
dents showed up in the Old Un
ion to lobby about the increase
in rent.
Rent Increases
As of September the monthly
rent for a two-bedroom apart
ment was increased from $59 to
$100 per month.
Scoles explained that the main
reason for raising the rent was
to offset costs of "starting from
scratch" in refurnishing the
apartments.
David Jones, a married grad
uate student who moved out of
Stanford Village in August and
into Escondido Village in Sep
tember, claimed that Stanford
Village is "adequate housing."
He added that part of his satis
faction came from paying only
$59 a month for rent.
Jones commented that he had

never seen any rats in Stanford
Vi'lage, contrary to a rumor cir
culated during Registration
Week at Stanford to discourage
possible tenants.
"I really can't believe this
about the rats," he explained.
"The same rumor has been go
ing around Escondido Village
the whole time, too."
Demands For More Housing
Early in September graduate
students of the local American
Federation of Teachers issued a
series of demands against Stan
ford Village before it was re
activated.
The AFT also indicated that
adequate housing, for minority
groups and low-income workers
at Stanford, as well as gradu
ate students, should be made
available.
Ed Neison, secretary of the
AFT, indicated the need for
some kind of moderately-priced
housing which can be built next
year.
Nelson cited the architectural
examples of "modular-type hous
ing" similar to the Community
Health Center in East Palo Alto.
He also indicated the "Light
Tree Apartments," a group of
varied two and three bedroom
apartments.
"Low-income" and "adequate"
housing depend a lot on your
objectives, he noted.
Another member of the AFT
observed that a lot also depends
on your definition of "adequate"
housing.

students of the local American
Federation of Teachers issued a
series of demands against Stan
ford Village before it was re
activated.
The AFT also indicated that
adequate housing, for minority
groups and low-income workers
at Stanford, as well as gradu
ate students, should be made
available.
Ed Neison, secretary of the
AFT, indicated the need for
some kind of moderately-priced
housing which can be built next
year.
Nelson cited the architectural
examples of "modular-type hous
ing" similar to the Community
Health Center in East Palo Alto.
He also indicated the "Light
Tree Apartments," a group of
varied two and three bedroom
apartments.
"Low-income" and "adequate"
housing depend a lot on your
objectives, he noted.
Another member of the AFT
observed that a lot also depends
on your definition of "adequate"
housing.

REMODELED ARMY BARRACKS — Is it adequate housing?
According to the City of Men
lo Park, housing in Stanford
Village has been "temporary"
for the past 22 years.
Instead of being closed down
this year, Stanford Village was
re-activated in September to al
leviate the housing shortage. It
will remain intact until August
1969. At that time the lease ex
pires, and the property goesi
back to its owner, the Stanford
Research Institute, commented
Homer Meaders, SRI Public Re
lations Manager.
Meaders described the SRI
purchase as "hastily-built struc
tures that the government erect
ed during World War II."
What is now Stanford Village
was formerly the Dibble Army
Hospital and a series of army
barracks that became surplus
stock after the War.
Bob Beyer, Assistant to the
City Manager of Menlo Park;
stated that the university pur
chased about 80 acres of land
from the government at $16,040
per acre immediately after the
war. He added that the City of
Menlo Park also purchased land
for their Civic Center.
Improvements Made
Stanford then remodeled the
buildings, installing kitchens
and bathrooms to provide hous
ing for approximately 2000 stu
dents. A shuttle bus service was
also provided to and from the
university.
SRI has been buying portions
of the land over a number of
years, explained Meaders, and
according to a triple agreement
with SRI and Menlo Park, Stan
ford was to have closed the Vil
lage in 1965.
Meaders explained that a "gen
tlemen's agreement" was made
at that time with the City to
extend the apartment section for

another three years to remedy
housing shortages.
The apartment buildings were
never in "first-class shape" said
Meaders, but plans to demolish
them were never effected.
"If you're living in a building,
you aren't going to want to see
it torn down," he remarked.
SRI Takes Over
Gradually buildings have been
de-artivated and sold to SRI and
to the City of Menlo Park. Mea
ders explained that SRI will take
over the property next year for
their long-range building pro
gram "1965 to 1984" in erecting
laboratories and office build
ings.
Edward Scoles, Assistant Bus
iness Manager of the University
Residences, said that the re
maining building #209 was re
activated early in September.
However, few or no people
signed up to live in Stanford
Vil'age the Thursday and Fri
day of Registration Week,
Scoles said, adding that he was
aware a number of graduate stu
dents showed up in the Old Un
ion to lobby about the increase
in rent.
Rent Increases
As of September the monthly
rent for a two-bedroom apart
ment was increased from $59 to
$100 per month.
Scoles explained that the main
reason for raising the rent was
to offset costs of "starting from
scratch" in refurnishing the
apartments.
David Jones, a married grad
uate student who moved out of
Stanford Village in August and
into Escondido Village in Sep
tember, claimed that Stanford
Village is "adequate housing."
He added that part of his satis
faction came from paying only
$59 a month for rent.
Jones commented that he had

never seen any rats in Stanford
Vi'lage, contrary to a rumor cir
culated during Registration
Week at Stanford to discourage
possible tenants.
"I really can't believe this
about the rats," he explained.
"The same rumor has been go
ing around Escondido Village
the whole time, too."

As of September the monthly
rent for a two-bedroom apart
ment was increased from $59 to
$100 per month.
Scoles explained that the main
reason for raising the rent was
to offset costs of "starting from
scratch" in refurnishing the
apartments.
David Jones, a married grad
uate student who moved out of
Stanford Village in August and
into Escondido Village in Sep
tember, claimed that Stanford
Village is "adequate housing."
He added that part of his satis
faction came from paying only
$59 a month for rent.
Jones commented that he had

never seen any rats in Stanford
Vi'lage, contrary to a rumor cir
culated during Registration
Week at Stanford to discourage
possible tenants.
"I really can't believe this
about the rats," he explained.
"The same rumor has been go
ing around Escondido Village
the whole time, too."
Demands For More Housing
Early in September graduate
students of the local American
Federation of Teachers issued a
series of demands against Stan
ford Village before it was re
activated.
The AFT also indicated that
adequate housing, for minority
groups and low-income workers
at Stanford, as well as gradu
ate students, should be made
available.
Ed Neison, secretary of the
AFT, indicated the need for
some kind of moderately-priced
housing which can be built next
year.
Nelson cited the architectural
examples of "modular-type hous
ing" similar to the Community
Health Center in East Palo Alto.
He also indicated the "Light
Tree Apartments," a group of
varied two and three bedroom
apartments.
"Low-income" and "adequate"
housing depend a lot on your
objectives, he noted.
Another member of the AFT
observed that a lot also depends
on your definition of "adequate"
housing.

REMODELED ARMY BARRACKS — Is it adequate housing?
According to the City of Men
lo Park, housing in Stanford
Village has been "temporary"
for the past 22 years.
Instead of being closed down
this year, Stanford Village was
re-activated in September to al
leviate the housing shortage. It
will remain intact until August
1969. At that time the lease ex
pires, and the property goesi
back to its owner, the Stanford
Research Institute, commented
Homer Meaders, SRI Public Re
lations Manager.
Meaders described the SRI
purchase as "hastily-built struc
tures that the government erect
ed during World War II."
What is now Stanford Village
was formerly the Dibble Army
Hospital and a series of army
barracks that became surplus
stock after the War.
Bob Beyer, Assistant to the
City Manager of Menlo Park;
stated that the university pur
chased about 80 acres of land
from the government at $16,040
per acre immediately after the
war. He added that the City of
Menlo Park also purchased land
for their Civic Center.
Improvements Made
Stanford then remodeled the
buildings, installing kitchens
and bathrooms to provide hous
ing for approximately 2000 stu
dents. A shuttle bus service was
also provided to and from the
university.
SRI has been buying portions
of the land over a number of
years, explained Meaders, and
according to a triple agreement
with SRI and Menlo Park, Stan
ford was to have closed the Vil
lage in 1965.
Meaders explained that a "gen
tlemen's agreement" was made
at that time with the City to
extend the apartment section for

another three years to remedy
housing shortages.
The apartment buildings were
never in "first-class shape" said
Meaders, but plans to demolish
them were never effected.
"If you're living in a building,
you aren't going to want to see
it torn down," he remarked.
SRI Takes Over
Gradually buildings have been
de-artivated and sold to SRI and
to the City of Menlo Park. Mea
ders explained that SRI will take
over the property next year for
their long-range building pro
gram "1965 to 1984" in erecting
laboratories and office build
ings.
Edward Scoles, Assistant Bus
iness Manager of the University
Residences, said that the re
maining building #209 was re
activated early in September.
However, few or no people
signed up to live in Stanford
Vil'age the Thursday and Fri
day of Registration Week,
Scoles said, adding that he was
aware a number of graduate stu
dents showed up in the Old Un
ion to lobby about the increase
in rent.
