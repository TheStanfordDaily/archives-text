# Oregon Senator Receives Students' Aid In Campaign
## 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
At least fifteen Stanford stu
dents are going to Oregon to
morrow to help canvass for the
reelection of Sen. Wayne Morse.
The students are a part of the
Stanford Committee for New
Democratic Politics' plan to
work positively for candidates
they admire.
The canvassers will work in
Portland and Eugene trying to
counter the belief spread by

Morse's opponent that Morse is
too old for the job and has the
support of no young people.
In an exclusive interview with
the Daily yesterday, Sen. Morse
accused his opponent of using
his age as a "smear tactic" in
the campaign. "I'm in top form
physically, intellectually, and
from the standpoint of serving
the voters. I've never been more
vigorous or in better health."
Morse will be 68 Sunday.
Morse said that he whole
heartedly supports Vice-Presi
dent Humphrey for President, in
spite of the fact he supported
Sen. McCarthy at the Demo
cratic National Convention.
"Anybody who participates in a
McCarthy write-in gives half a
vote to Nixon and half a vote
to Wallace. After all they have
to make a choice as to what is
in the best interests of our
country as regards to the Presi
dency for the next 4 years,"
Morse said.
"The choice is," he continued
"between Humphrey and Nixon.
This country cannot withstand
the catastrophe of 4 years of
Nixon." He then attacked Nix
on's foreign policy as a continu
ation of John Foster Dulles's
policies such as "the building up
of an American military lifeline
around the world." He also said
that Nixon might get the U.S.
into a war with Red China.
"I'm supporting Humphrey on
the basis that if Humphrey is
given the mantle of responsibili
ty his foreign policy will dras
tically change from the policy
Johnson has been following,"
Morse said. "I'm satisfied that
we're going to have a complete
change in foreign policy in Asia
under Humphrey because he
knows that you can never unite
this country and continue this
illegal, immoral, and unjustifia
ble war in South Vietnam," he
concluded.
He also strongly discounted
the threat posed by George Wal
lace. "I think that by November
5, much of his political snowball
will melt under the heat of pub
lic opinion. I think that the
voters will come to recognize
that what they're asked for
when they're asked to vote for
Wallace is Hitler," said Morse.
He also said that Wallace prob
ably won't receive 5 per cent of
the total vote, and certainly
won't send the election to the
House of Representatives.

lic opinion. I think that the
voters will come to recognize
that what they're asked for
when they're asked to vote for
Wallace is Hitler," said Morse.
He also said that Wallace prob
ably won't receive 5 per cent of
the total vote, and certainly
won't send the election to the
House of Representatives.
At least fifteen Stanford stu
dents are going to Oregon to
morrow to help canvass for the
reelection of Sen. Wayne Morse.
The students are a part of the
Stanford Committee for New
Democratic Politics' plan to
work positively for candidates
they admire.
The canvassers will work in
Portland and Eugene trying to
counter the belief spread by

Morse's opponent that Morse is
too old for the job and has the
support of no young people.
In an exclusive interview with
the Daily yesterday, Sen. Morse
accused his opponent of using
his age as a "smear tactic" in
the campaign. "I'm in top form
physically, intellectually, and
from the standpoint of serving
the voters. I've never been more
vigorous or in better health."
Morse will be 68 Sunday.
Morse said that he whole
heartedly supports Vice-Presi
dent Humphrey for President, in
spite of the fact he supported
Sen. McCarthy at the Demo
cratic National Convention.
"Anybody who participates in a
McCarthy write-in gives half a
vote to Nixon and half a vote
to Wallace. After all they have
to make a choice as to what is
in the best interests of our
country as regards to the Presi
dency for the next 4 years,"
Morse said.
"The choice is," he continued
"between Humphrey and Nixon.
This country cannot withstand
the catastrophe of 4 years of
Nixon." He then attacked Nix
on's foreign policy as a continu
ation of John Foster Dulles's
policies such as "the building up
of an American military lifeline
around the world." He also said
that Nixon might get the U.S.
into a war with Red China.
"I'm supporting Humphrey on
the basis that if Humphrey is
given the mantle of responsibili
ty his foreign policy will dras
tically change from the policy
Johnson has been following,"
Morse said. "I'm satisfied that
we're going to have a complete
change in foreign policy in Asia
under Humphrey because he
knows that you can never unite
this country and continue this
illegal, immoral, and unjustifia
ble war in South Vietnam," he
concluded.
He also strongly discounted
the threat posed by George Wal
lace. "I think that by November
5, much of his political snowball
will melt under the heat of pub
lic opinion. I think that the
voters will come to recognize
that what they're asked for
when they're asked to vote for
Wallace is Hitler," said Morse.
