# ROTC Instructors Defend Existing Campus Program
## 
### RANDAL SAMSTAG 
The flack has been heavy for
R.O.T.C. programs at Stanford.
They have been a target of pro
testors and arsonists alike. Total
enrollment dropped to 241 from
586 in five years.
Ten faculty members recently
proposed to the Senate of the
Academic Council that sweeping
changes be made in military sci
ence programs including the
dropping of academic credit for
R.O.T.C. courses.
Still the heads of the three
service units here are confident
that military science can keep
a viable place within the Uni
versity community. But they
maintain that changes are neces
sary.
An ad hoc committee has been
established to review military
science programs and will re
port its recommendations to the
Academic Senate by January 15.
The University has the option
to drop R.O.T.C. at any time.
Solid Minority
In spite of the drop in en
rollment, there is a solid minor
ity of students n these programs
who want R.O.T.C. to stay. Some
cadets and mdshpmen are pad
$50 per month in scholarship
and advanced programs.
Graduate students accepted in
some ROTC programs can stay
clear of the Selective Service.

Certain students graduating
from ROTC can obtain scholar
ships for advanced studies.
ROTC instructors feel that en
rollment in the program would
suffer severely if academic credit
were suspended.
"If you put enough obstacles
in front of any program," says
Army Colonel Stanley M.
Ramey, "it is bound to fail."
'Broad Latitude'
In response to the charge of
standardization of course ma
terial, the army head replies,
"I am not told specifically how
to cover these subjects. I have
broad latitude to determine sub
ject matter and relative empha
sis."
As for grading, Col. Ramey
says, "In this department we
will stick to the Stanford grad
ing standard as we can. There
will be appropriate amount of
work to provide Stanford stu
dents with a challenge."
Major Leon C. Heinle, execu
tive head of the Air Force ROTC
at Stanford cites two reasons
for a higher grading distribu
tion in aerospace science. "We
have selected students, first, and
in addition we have a large num
ber of graduate students (16 of
50)."
New Curriculum
Concerning military science

reforms, Col. Ramey points out
that his department taay have
a new curriculum next year.
Courses such as "World Military
History" and"The Concept of
Force" conceivably could be
taught by the history and po
litical science departments, re
spectively.
Marine Colonel Robert L.
Thomas, head of the naval sci
ences department, remarks that
ROTC courses are open to all
Stanford students, class size per
mitting. Courses in navagation,
for example, have enrolled non-
ROTC students in the past and
even a few women students.
Army ROTC courses, open to
all students, must be taken in
sequence.
Not Unique
"ROTC courses are not unique
in professional thrust," says Col.
Thomas. Other departments in
the university offer courses that
are comparably professional or
pre-professional.
An army program which
allows students from six area
junior colleges to take military
science courses at Stanford has
come under attack.
Col. Ramey emphasises that
these students are in no way
entitled to any of the privileges
of Stanford student registration.
These programs are administer
ed through the junior colleges.
NROTC and AFROTC do not
have comparable programs.
Those who defend the pres
ence of ROTC on the Stanford
campus point out that the Uni
versity has an "obligation" to
actively participate in the na
tional community to which it
belongs. It is argued that we
all share an interest in national
security, without regard to dif
ferences of opinion over Viet
Nam or current foreign policy.
ROTC becomes a way for a uni
versity to express its "obliga
tion."
Ramey Position
Col. Ramey sums up his posi
tion as follows: "We will have
requirements for security forces
for some time to come. I feel
we need a wide spectrum of
types of people in these forces.
We need the best qualified lead
ers we can get." 11A three men
agree that ROTC graduates do
make good officers.
The ROTC departments hope
the Academic Senate committee
can offer guidelines for the con
tinuing presence of ROTC at
Stanford.
It does not seem likely that
the committee will recommend
that the programs be dropped
entirely, they feel Stanford's ties
with the ROTC go back to 1919.
Still, in that case the way would
be clear. Says Col. Heinle, "If it's
Stanford's decision, all the uni
versity has to say is 'go' and
we'll go."

tive head of the Air Force ROTC
at Stanford cites two reasons
for a higher grading distribu
tion in aerospace science. "We
have selected students, first, and
in addition we have a large num
ber of graduate students (16 of
50)."
New Curriculum
Concerning military science

reforms, Col. Ramey points out
that his department taay have
a new curriculum next year.
Courses such as "World Military
History" and"The Concept of
Force" conceivably could be
taught by the history and po
litical science departments, re
spectively.
Marine Colonel Robert L.
Thomas, head of the naval sci
ences department, remarks that
ROTC courses are open to all
Stanford students, class size per
mitting. Courses in navagation,
for example, have enrolled non-
ROTC students in the past and
even a few women students.
Army ROTC courses, open to
all students, must be taken in
sequence.
Not Unique
"ROTC courses are not unique
in professional thrust," says Col.
Thomas. Other departments in
the university offer courses that
are comparably professional or
pre-professional.
An army program which
allows students from six area
junior colleges to take military
science courses at Stanford has
come under attack.
Col. Ramey emphasises that
these students are in no way
entitled to any of the privileges
of Stanford student registration.
These programs are administer
ed through the junior colleges.
NROTC and AFROTC do not
have comparable programs.
Those who defend the pres
ence of ROTC on the Stanford
campus point out that the Uni
versity has an "obligation" to
actively participate in the na
tional community to which it
belongs. It is argued that we
all share an interest in national
security, without regard to dif
ferences of opinion over Viet
Nam or current foreign policy.
ROTC becomes a way for a uni
versity to express its "obliga
tion."
Ramey Position
Col. Ramey sums up his posi
tion as follows: "We will have
requirements for security forces
for some time to come. I feel
we need a wide spectrum of
types of people in these forces.
We need the best qualified lead
ers we can get." 11A three men
agree that ROTC graduates do
make good officers.
The ROTC departments hope
the Academic Senate committee
can offer guidelines for the con
tinuing presence of ROTC at
Stanford.
It does not seem likely that
the committee will recommend
that the programs be dropped
entirely, they feel Stanford's ties
with the ROTC go back to 1919.
Still, in that case the way would
be clear. Says Col. Heinle, "If it's
Stanford's decision, all the uni
versity has to say is 'go' and
we'll go."
The flack has been heavy for
R.O.T.C. programs at Stanford.
They have been a target of pro
testors and arsonists alike. Total
enrollment dropped to 241 from
586 in five years.
Ten faculty members recently
proposed to the Senate of the
Academic Council that sweeping
changes be made in military sci
ence programs including the
dropping of academic credit for
R.O.T.C. courses.
Still the heads of the three
service units here are confident
that military science can keep
a viable place within the Uni
versity community. But they
maintain that changes are neces
sary.
An ad hoc committee has been
established to review military
science programs and will re
port its recommendations to the
Academic Senate by January 15.
The University has the option
to drop R.O.T.C. at any time.
Solid Minority
In spite of the drop in en
rollment, there is a solid minor
ity of students n these programs
who want R.O.T.C. to stay. Some
cadets and mdshpmen are pad
$50 per month in scholarship
and advanced programs.
Graduate students accepted in
some ROTC programs can stay
clear of the Selective Service.

Certain students graduating
from ROTC can obtain scholar
ships for advanced studies.
ROTC instructors feel that en
rollment in the program would
suffer severely if academic credit
were suspended.
"If you put enough obstacles
in front of any program," says
Army Colonel Stanley M.
Ramey, "it is bound to fail."
'Broad Latitude'
In response to the charge of
standardization of course ma
terial, the army head replies,
"I am not told specifically how
to cover these subjects. I have
broad latitude to determine sub
ject matter and relative empha
sis."
As for grading, Col. Ramey
says, "In this department we
will stick to the Stanford grad
ing standard as we can. There
will be appropriate amount of
work to provide Stanford stu
dents with a challenge."

we need a wide spectrum of
types of people in these forces.
We need the best qualified lead
ers we can get." 11A three men
agree that ROTC graduates do
make good officers.
The ROTC departments hope
the Academic Senate committee
can offer guidelines for the con
tinuing presence of ROTC at
Stanford.
It does not seem likely that
the committee will recommend
that the programs be dropped
entirely, they feel Stanford's ties
with the ROTC go back to 1919.
Still, in that case the way would
be clear. Says Col. Heinle, "If it's
Stanford's decision, all the uni
versity has to say is 'go' and
we'll go."
The flack has been heavy for
R.O.T.C. programs at Stanford.
They have been a target of pro
testors and arsonists alike. Total
enrollment dropped to 241 from
586 in five years.
Ten faculty members recently
proposed to the Senate of the
Academic Council that sweeping
changes be made in military sci
ence programs including the
dropping of academic credit for
R.O.T.C. courses.
Still the heads of the three
service units here are confident
that military science can keep
a viable place within the Uni
versity community. But they
maintain that changes are neces
sary.
An ad hoc committee has been
established to review military
science programs and will re
port its recommendations to the
Academic Senate by January 15.
The University has the option
to drop R.O.T.C. at any time.
Solid Minority
In spite of the drop in en
rollment, there is a solid minor
ity of students n these programs
who want R.O.T.C. to stay. Some
cadets and mdshpmen are pad
$50 per month in scholarship
and advanced programs.
Graduate students accepted in
some ROTC programs can stay
clear of the Selective Service.

Certain students graduating
from ROTC can obtain scholar
ships for advanced studies.
ROTC instructors feel that en
rollment in the program would
suffer severely if academic credit
were suspended.
"If you put enough obstacles
in front of any program," says
Army Colonel Stanley M.
Ramey, "it is bound to fail."
'Broad Latitude'
In response to the charge of
standardization of course ma
terial, the army head replies,
"I am not told specifically how
to cover these subjects. I have
broad latitude to determine sub
ject matter and relative empha
sis."
As for grading, Col. Ramey
says, "In this department we
will stick to the Stanford grad
ing standard as we can. There
will be appropriate amount of
work to provide Stanford stu
dents with a challenge."
Major Leon C. Heinle, execu
tive head of the Air Force ROTC
at Stanford cites two reasons
for a higher grading distribu
tion in aerospace science. "We
have selected students, first, and
in addition we have a large num
ber of graduate students (16 of
50)."
New Curriculum
Concerning military science

reforms, Col. Ramey points out
that his department taay have
a new curriculum next year.
Courses such as "World Military
History" and"The Concept of
Force" conceivably could be
taught by the history and po
litical science departments, re
spectively.
Marine Colonel Robert L.
Thomas, head of the naval sci
ences department, remarks that
ROTC courses are open to all
Stanford students, class size per
mitting. Courses in navagation,
for example, have enrolled non-
ROTC students in the past and
even a few women students.
Army ROTC courses, open to
all students, must be taken in
sequence.
Not Unique
"ROTC courses are not unique
in professional thrust," says Col.
Thomas. Other departments in
the university offer courses that
are comparably professional or
pre-professional.
An army program which
allows students from six area
junior colleges to take military
science courses at Stanford has
come under attack.
Col. Ramey emphasises that
these students are in no way
entitled to any of the privileges
of Stanford student registration.
These programs are administer
ed through the junior colleges.
NROTC and AFROTC do not
have comparable programs.
Those who defend the pres
ence of ROTC on the Stanford
campus point out that the Uni
versity has an "obligation" to
actively participate in the na
tional community to which it
belongs. It is argued that we
all share an interest in national
security, without regard to dif
ferences of opinion over Viet
Nam or current foreign policy.
ROTC becomes a way for a uni
versity to express its "obliga
tion."
Ramey Position
Col. Ramey sums up his posi
tion as follows: "We will have
requirements for security forces
for some time to come. I feel
