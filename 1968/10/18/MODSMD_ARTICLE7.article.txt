# STANFORD REDWOODS
## 
### 
Stanford's University Relations Office and
the Planning Office have agreed to place a
memorial plaque in the vicinity of the six
"Palos Altos" redwoods which were "re
discovered" near the Biology building by
The Daily last July.
The only problem now is money. A me
morial plaque in honor of Stanford botany
Professor George Peirce, who planted the
trees about 50 years ago, would cost an
estimated $150 to $200. The General Secre
tary's Office would be willing to accept con
tributions for the plaque, made out to "Stan
ford University" and accompanied by a note
stating "Redwood Trees".
The Daily in a fit of arboreal passion has
proposed an inscription for the plaque which
would run as follows:
"These six redwoods were planted about
1915 by Stanford botany professor and pio

neer American plant physiologist George J.
Peirce, faculty member from 1897 to 1933.
Pursuant to the professor's intention, the
University named these monuments of na
ture officially 'Stanford Palos Altos' to assume
the tradition of El Palo Alto when the old
tree dies.
El Palo is the 1,000-year-old tree at San
Francisquito Creek that gave its name to
the city of Palo Alto and its image to Stan
ford's university seal. It is known as the old
est living landmark in California.
These trees shall be the living symbols of
Stanford's strength, independence, and en
during quality."
We urge that members of the Stanford
community help commemorate this bit of
Stanfordalia by making contributions to the
General Secretary's Office.
After all, what have you done lately for a
tree?
