## MAFIA Gaieties 
### 
Editor, The DAILY:
The MAFIA is a producing
organization of the Master of
Fine Arts students in the De
partment of Speech and Drama.
It has been organized to provide
an additional outlet for good
theater on campus. The MAFIA
regularly schedules perform
ances on Saturday evenings at
11:30 in the Nitery.
When the MAFIA learned, a
week ago, that Rams Head
would not be presenting a Gaie
ties this year, a special emer
gency meeting was called. MA
FIA felt that a tradition as
strong as the Gaieties should
not be terminated. We decided
to pursue the possibility of a
Gaieties presented by the MA
FIA.
Because many decisions and
plans had to be made immediate
ly, the MAFIA membership de
cided it was unfeasable to at
tempt an original script. We are,
however, taking over the Gaie
ties time slot with money nor
mally given to Rams Head by
ASSU. . . .
In lieu of the original script,
the MAFIA will be presenting
the Big Game Gaieties show this
year. The production will be "A
Funny Thing Happened On The
Way To The Forum," the smash
Broadway musical, freely aimed
at the Stanford Community. We

hope the Stanford Community
will in turn support us in our
dents, still have to deal with
those who define America's
goals as "grabbing hippies by
the hair and dragging them to
jail with the other communists."
attempt at keeping the Big
Game Gaieties Tradition alive.
Further, we hope Johnie Scott
will take advantage of our exis
tence and consider producing his
works under the auspices of
MAFIA. In this way we can as
sure him that he will be free to
tell it like it really is.

â€¢ SDS Demands
Editor, The Daily:
We wish to clarify the Octo
ber 14 date on the SDS demands
to the trustees that Stanford ex
tricate itself from American
military and economic policy
in Southeast Asia. The main de
mand is quoted below:
We, the members of Stanford
SDS and concerned members
of the Stanford community,
DEMAND that Stanford Uni
versity, its wholly owned sub
sidiary, the Stanford Research
Institute, and all members of
the community immediately
halt all military and economic
projects and operations con
cerned with Southeast Asia.
It would have been fine if
that happened immediately, but
it didn't.
There was a subsidiary de
mand that all information on
SRI funding and contracts be
made public by October 14, and
that didn't happen either.
There was no ultimatum or
threat implied by the October
14 date, a week from the prom
ulgation of the demands. . . .
We hope the Academic Senate
will consider the main demand
and the university's involvement
in the war in Vietnam and the
growing war in Thailand, rather
than intramural questions like
the nature of SRl's relationship
to the university, or manage
ment of student crises. SDS is
concerned with the effects of
our foreign policy in Southeast
Asia and how Stanford furthers
those effects.
