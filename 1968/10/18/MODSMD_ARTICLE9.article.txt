## White Man For White House 
### CHRIS PECK 
"Shut up you damn nigger,
listen to what he has to say."
The television cameras whirred
as long thin microphones picked
up the familiar "you have some
of the finest police in the world
here" speech of George Wallace.
The television cameras didn't
pick up the looks of fear that
glowed in the eyes of the Wal
lace supporters. The camera

didn't pick up the trembling,
high pitched voice of a man who
ran up the aisle to the Wallace
hecklers screaming, "Why don't
you go home you dirty commu
nist pigs?"
More than one was thinking
what a man next to me said out
loud; "Let's get a white man in
the White House, Wallace."
Young blacks and young
whites chanted, "Wallace is a

pig, Wallace is a pig" and were
greeted by a middle-aged Wal
lace supporter's cut, "you're
white trash."
Ten thousand people heard
George Wallace give the same
speech he has delivered across
the nation the past 11 months.
He said nothing beyond his "I'll
grab you hippies by the hair and
put you in jail along with the
other communists." Yet he at
tracted 10,000 people.
At one point in the rally a
Wallace campaign manager
stepped to the microphone and
asked, "Is this Wallace coun
try?" The loud minority of heck
lers jumped up, gave the Nazi
saluate and chanted "Seig Heil,"
only to be drowned out by the
roar of applause.
The rally lasted less than two
hours. After it was over, a fight
broke out between a man about
40 years old and two college
students.
The feelings that were at the
Cow Palace Sunday were com

plex. There was reaction to pro
gress in Vietnam, reaction to
fear for life and property in the
streets, and reaction to hate and
radicals of all kinds.
The rally was basically a sym
bolic release for Wallace sup
porters as well as the hecklers.
Both sides know that George
Wallace isn't going to be elected
in November.
But America will still have to
deal with "shut up you damn
nigger," still have to find a com
munication link between 40 year
old businessmen and college stu-
