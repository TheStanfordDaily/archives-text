Open Letter to the Stanford Community:
Today Yale Braunstein, a student, was permitted to speak before the
Board of Trustees of Stanford University. Following this action the Board
held a discussion as to whether or not students should be represented at
their meetings.
In response to the openness of the Trustees I would like to announce my
sincere interest in receiving an appointment to the Board. As a student
who has been in the Stanford community five years, and one who will soon
become a member of a time honored profession, I believe that I am well
qualified to sit on the Board and to deal with the complex problems of
governance.
Of course, I can not—and would not— claim to represent the great ma
jority of Stanford students in any sense, but I think that it is well known by
the Trustees and the community that, with so many diverse interest groups
on campus, no one could honestly make this claim. Instead let me only say
that I will represent myself and my beliefs to the best of my ability in the
same manner that each of the current members represents himself.
I would have no objection to the appointment of several other students
with divergent viewpoints simultaneous with my own In
deed, I would encourage the Board to select a cross section of students.
I hope this suggestion is taken seriously as I think that its implementa
tion would greatly improve the governance of the University.
Sincerely yours,
