# Stanford Grape Boycott
## Park-In Slows Grape Sales 
### LANG ATWOOD 
A "park-in" organized by the
Stanford Grape Boycott Commit
tee effectively turned away
many rush hour shoppers Fri
day afternoon at the Safeway
food store, 2811 Middlefield Road
in Palo Alto.
Boycott supporters began ar
riving at 4:30 and parking in the
store's lot. By 4:50 the lot was
filled with a mixture of boycott
and shopper's vehicles. A mas
sive traffic jam ensued as sup
porters and shoppers drove
around and around the lot wait
ing for other shoppers to leave.
Pickets and pamphleteers added
to the general confusion.
As the traffic backed up into
the street, three Safeway em
ployees came outside, but after
a quick look around, returned
to the store and contented them
selves with pressing their noses
against the window.
Gra[>e Display Affected
Most boycott supporters after
parking their cars went inside
to purchase a small item to
make their "parking" legal. The
store's grape display was the

object of much attention, and
many of the grapes disappeared
and were scattered about the
store.
The management finally re
moved the remainder of the
grapes and put up a little sign,
"Nice, delicious grapes please
ask produce clerk."
Boycotters Fill Parking Lot
By 5:30 the lot was full of
boycott cars and most shoppers
drove through and passed the
pickets without stopping. A few
wore persistant and parked il
legally. However, the patrons in
the store between five and six
were 90 per cent boycott sup
porters.
A Palo Alto police car stopped
once and warned that arrests
would be made if traffic was
blocked in the street. After
watching the area for about ten
minutes, the officer left.
The store manager, Robert R.
Sheehan, replied to DAILY ques
tions with a terse, "No com
ment." However, an employee
remarked about the "park-in,"
"It's the most fun I've had in a

long time." Another had a differ
ent opinion, he muttered, "Fuck
you," as he passed a picket and
said, "I'll get you after work."
Varying Public Reaction
The public's reaction ranged
from bewilderment to outright
hostility. One man stated, "I
support the boycott, but why
can't I shop here?"
When asked if he supported
the boycott, an elderly gentle
man in the store said, "I don't
support anything . . . except
Nixon." A woman shopper, ob
viously irritated, went up to the
manager and demanded that he
do something. She said, "It took
me a half an hour to get through
this mess, and I'm parked down
the street."
May fair, Lucky and Safeway
are the only chains still selling
grapes in the area and the
"park-in" was the latest tactic
adopted by the Stanford group
in their effort to halt grape
sales. Last week the Safeway
store was picketed, but this was
found to be ineffective and pro
duced a basklash reaction.

Alan Rader, a commit tee
spokesman, said that the pur
pose uf the picketing and park
in was "to make Safeway recog
nize their social responsibility."
When asked Friday if he
thought the "park-in" was suc
cessful, Rader replied, "I'd say
so. There's no one in sight."
