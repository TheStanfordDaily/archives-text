# AN EDITORIAL

October 14 has passed. October 14 was the deadline set by the
Stanford Students for a Democratic Society for Stanford Research
Institute to stop all war-connected projects.
I here was no way tor SRI to meet the SDS deadline, even if
they had wanted to. But some of the demands have merit and
should be met as soon as possible.
Specifically, we believe Stanford Research Institute should
stop accepting classified government contracts. The University is
coming close to this position and we see no reason SRI cannot
do the same.
It will be argued that SRI, by its nature, is involved in sensitive
work for government and industry that should be kept from
"competitors.' YVe categorically reject that idea as far as the
government goes.
We concede that a corporation may have a legitimate interest
in keeping research secrets from competitors, but the fact that
research is being conducted should be public knowledge. In
projects dealing with both government and industry that is not
presently the case.
Further, we believe a review process should be set up, within
the University, to screen all SRI contracts. Such a committee
exists for University contracts and shows signs of doing a good
job.
Some will argue that the simplest thing to do would be for the
University to sever its ties with SRI. This is no solution to the
problem.

Severance of the ties would not redirect the thrust of SRl's
work towards more socially useful projects. In tact, severance
of ties might make SHI an arm of the Pentagon, if it is not
already one.
As one member of our staff has said, "SRI could be doing
groovy things in the ghetto.' It could indeed.
Affiliation with the University would be particularly useful if
the University chose, as we feel it should, to help improve the

quality of American life, in ghettos and elsewhere. SRI could
serve as a valuable adjunct in such work.
Further, SRI could continue (and increase) work aimed at the
eradication of social injustice.
We are glad SDS helped bring the issue of SRI and its role
in society into the limelight. Acting president Glaser has also
done well by announcing the formation of a student-faculty com
mittee to examine SRl's ties with the University.
We look forward to following the committee's work and read
ing its report.
The committee's job will be difficult, but it is a necessary task
and one which must be accomplished with dispatch.
