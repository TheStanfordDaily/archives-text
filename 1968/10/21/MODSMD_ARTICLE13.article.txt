## Anthro Grads Endorse AFT 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The Association of Anthro-
Stanford strongly supports the
demands of the teaching assist
ants in the Political Science De
partment.
We agree that:
$3000 per academic year
should bo the minimum income
for each teaching assistant;
teaching assistants should
receive at lease $300 for each
dependant;
—no increase in teaching
loads or reduction of existing
benefits should accompany such
additional income;
negotiations should begin
immediately in order that such
increase could go into effect at
the start of the Winter term,
1909.
We believe that these points
should apply to all graduate stu
dents who assist in teaching in
any department of Stanford
University.

• Stanford Recalled
Editor, The Daily:
Without sounding like the pa
rent who walked four miles to
school and cherished the pad
dling, may I suggest something
worthwhile about Stanford aside
from a part in its policy.
I remember that the estab
lishment was good enough to
let me sit at the feet of David
Starr Jordan, hear the high
pitched but authentic words of
Professor Cubberly, gain pearls
of wisdom from Dr. Thorndike,
be enriched by quiet suggestions
of Elizabeth Lee Buckingham,
be entertained and enlightened
by Margaret Bailey, have con
versation with Professors Em
erson, Bassett, and Anderson,
worship the charm of Shake
speare from the recently de
ceased Hardin Craig, chat in
the commons with other great
souls, get a glimpse of Herbert
Hoover, welcome the visit of
Japan's Kagawa, and be influ
enced by others of immeasur
able strength.

• Grape Viewpoint
Editor, The Daily:
The recent article, "Price of
Grapes," which appeared under
the by-line of one, Alan Rader,
is perhaps one of the worst ox
ers, who have been the target
ever to appear in any respect

able newspaper anywhere. This
vicious and slanderous bit of
trash was so completely full of
lies and distortions that it de
fies the dignity of a detailed and
categoric denial.
Such garbage, with no names,
times, or places, or any sort of
proof or verification, is just one
example of bleeding hearts and
ill-informed hate - peddlers at
tempting to carry out this tre
mendous hoax against the large
masses of the American public.
I shall not attempt to com
ment on each lie or distortion of
Mr. Rader, whoever he may be,
except to remind him and his
kind that they serve no pur
pose or cause, do no justice to
the farm workers, or to Stan
ford, but simply reveal them
selves for what they are, thor
oughly immature pseudo
liberals, completely unaware of
the facts. More than likely, they
have fallen victims to the vicious
propaganda of high-placed un
ion leaders trying to exploit the
farm workers through lies and
blackmail.
The actual FACT that there
has never been a legitimate
strike of grape pickers at any
time and in any numbers any
where in the San Joaquin Val
ley, has forced these phony un
ion leaders to resort to BLACK
MAIL.
Along the way, they have at
tempted to recruit well-meaning
Americans, members of the cler
gy, and students on the various
campuses in an effort to give
this HOAX an air of legitimacy.
Well, it has failed as it must.
The Delano table grape grow
amples of yellow journalism
of these vicious attacks for
three years, pay the HIGHEST
farm wages under the best liv
ing conditions of any farm
group in America or the world,
and the FARM WORKERS
KNOW THIS better than Cea
sar Chavez, Alan Rader, Hum
phrey, or any Stanford co-ed.
That is why ninety-five (95)
per cent of the working force
in Delano, who are NOT mi
grants, and live in this area,
have never walked off the jobs
or even considered Ceasar Cha
vez as anything but a power
seeking opportunist, working as
a stooge for the big industrial
unions, who are chomping at
the bit in anticipation of month
ly dues from a huge agricultural
labor force.

Every farm worker in Ameri
ca has a perfect right to join or
refuse to join a union . . .
Farm workers, not particularly
in table grapes, but all over
America need help in the form
of adequate legislation, fairly
applied to all areas of the coun
try, by legitimate organizations

and governing bodies. They need
NO help from bleeding hearts,
churches, the left-wingers, the
Viet-nam groups, civil rights
marchers, students or phoney
liberals.
