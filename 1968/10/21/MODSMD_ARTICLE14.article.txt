## Who Gets Developed? 
### GEOFFREY STEVENS 
Many people are aware that
the cnunte r-insurgency and
chemical anri biological warfare
research that SRI does is part
of America's war effort in
Southeast Asia. Fewer people
understand, however, that SRl's
"development" research is an
other part of the same war ef
fort in Southeast Asia.
Just as America's military in
tervention has shown itself to
be full of contraditcions - like
intervening on behalf of a series
of military dictatorships in the
name of democracy, saving a
city by destroying it, and win
ning a war for eight years with
out victoryâ€”so America's "de
velopment" intervention is full
of contradictions.
Is there any formerly under
developed country in the world
which has been developed from
the outside by an economically
advanced country? That is to
say, have eighty years of Ameri
can involvement in South Amer
ica resulted in one economy
which is independent and auton
omous?
Isn't it true that the richer,
the more technologically ad
vanced, and the more experi

enced corporation or economy
will tend to dominate the poor
er, less technologically advanced
and less experienced corporation
or economy?
Will American "development"
efforts produce economic autono
my and independence ,or will
they result in American domina
tion of oil in Venezuela, copper
in Chile, and the canal in Pan
ama?
In the cases of both the white
businessman in the gehtto and
the American businessman in an
underdeveloped country, people
from the outside are running the
show. And just as black people
need to own the businesses of
the black ghettos, so Latin
Americans and Asians need to
own the businesses of their
countries.
Will the United States develop
the world as it has developed
itself, leaving many areas unde
veloped while polluting the air
and covering the land with free
ways and billboards?
Will the United States protect
underdeveloped countries as it
protects its own cities? Are the
Green Berets the international
version of the National Guard?
Will American investment in
Thailand necessitate the contin

ued presence of fifty thousand
American troops?
Just as we oppose America's
role as policeman of the world,
so we should oppose America's
role as "developer" of the world.
And just as we oppose SRl's
military research, so we should
oppose SRl's "development" re
search
