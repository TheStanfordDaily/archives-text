### 
Prof. Thomas J. Connolly, me

Melvin W. Reder, economics,
have been named chairmen of
the Ad Hoc Committees on
ROTC and Relations with Stu
dent Government, respectively.
Their solution was announced
today by Prof. G. L. Bach, eco
nomics and business, chairman
of the Senate Committee on
Committees.
Each committee will have
four students, nominated by Stu
dent Body President Denis
Hayes after consultation with a
student advisory group and with
the approval of the Student Leg
islature.
Members of the advisory
group included Legislature
Speaker Yale M. Braunstein;
Student Body Vice President
Victor von Schlegell; Nicholas
P. Falk, graduate student in
business; Lee D. Foreman, grad
uate student in law; and David
Mannheimer, junior philosophy
major.
Alter ROTC Program
Members of the ROTC Com
mittee, besides Connolly, will in
clude E. Howard Brooks, vice

provost; J. Thomas Carrato,
senior statistics rpnior; George
B. Catermole, graduate student
in philosophy; Mark U. Edwards
Jr., graduate student in history;
Thomas L. Grissom, graduate

Kostelanetz, assistant professor
of English; Robert L. Thomas,
professor and executive head of
naval science; and Lyman P.
Van Slyke, assistant professor

Committee on East Asian Stud

In a Sept. 26 resolution, the
Senate of the Academic Council
expressed its sense that "the
ROTC program should be al
tered, but that proper relations
between the ROTC departments
and Stanford may be estab
lished by review and reform of
the present relations." The ad
hoc committee was requested to
report its recommendations not
later than Jan. 15.
Prof. Reder headed a 13-man
Committee on Government for
the Stanford chapter of the
American Association of Univer
sity Professors last summer. Ob
jectives of the new committee

which he heads will be to con
sider how additional student
opinion can be brought to the
Senate and how the process of
petition can be made most ef
fective for all members of the
University community.
Ad Hoc Committee
Requested to report back to
the Senate before the end of
winter quarter, the ad hoc Com
mittee on Student Government
relations will include: Peter J.
Dunkley, junior history major;

electrical engineering and ap
plied physics; Rodney L. Levine,
graduate student in medicine;
Warren R. Lyons, graduate stu
dent in law and business; Rob
ert W. Rosenzweig, associate
provost; W. Richard Such, grad
uate student in law; and Leslie
M. Zatz, associate professor of
riadiology.
According to Prof. Bach, "It
was understood that special care
would be taken in the nomina
tion of student members to com
mittees that major viewpoints in
the student body would be rep
resented on each committee, in
so far as that is feasible."
