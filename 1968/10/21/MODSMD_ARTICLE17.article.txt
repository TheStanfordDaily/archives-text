# Parents' Day Speech
## 'Universities Face Three Crises' 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON 
Universities are facing crises
on at least three fronts, accord
ing to Vice-Provost Herbert
Packer. Speaking to a Parents'
Day audience of more than 1,000
Saturday, the steering commit
tee chairman ol the Study of

Education at Stanford (SES)
said crises confront universities
in finance, governance and un
dergraduate education.
In his speech, the crisis in un
dergraduate education received
emphasis by Packer. "It is a
crisis of confidence ... a ques
tion of being asked . . . what
is undergraduate education for?
Packer said that for some peo
ple undergraduate education is
"a desirable path to social suc
cess and financial security: four
years of work and play with the
right people." This type, how
ever, makes up less than half
of the student body at places
like Stanford, according to
Packer.
"It is the student who does
not know what an undergradu
ate education is for who is in
trouble today. And we in the

university are in trouble along
with him," said Packer.
Thirty year ago, "the under
graduate was the center of its
(the university's) universe and
the undergraduate education
was its central mission" and
three-quarters of the Stanford
student body were undergrad
uates. Today "the split is about
fifty-fifty. The old model has
ceased to describe reality; but
the myth persists."
'The Myth Persists'
Packer asserted that univer
sities perform well in the edu
cation of "specialists within a
given academic discipline," both
graduate and undergraduate.
"Where universities fall down
badly, in my judgment, is in
what is generally referred to as
general education, the education
of non-specialists."
Packer attributed this failure,
in part, to the predominance in
faculties of "discipline-oriented
specialists." He placed a larger
portion of the blame, however,
on "a set of highly detailed rules
called General Studies require
ments."
"Interpreting them,'.' Packer
said, "calls for exegetical tal
ents typically reserved for High
er Criticism of the Bible or in
terpretation of the Internal Rev
enue Code. The intent, of course,
is to see to it that students get
a well-rounded exposure to lots
of different fields of knowledge,"
Packer continued.
The Stanford Compromise
"The result, unhappily, is that
the letter kills the spirit, and
the fulfillment of General Stud
ies requirements becomes an
end in itself rather than a
means of guiding students to
rational choice."
Echoing a passage in an early
draft of the SES Undergradu

ate Education report, Packer
declared, "Its principal weak
ness is that it represents an
unsatisfactory compromise with
the myth of general education."
"The Stanford compromise,
which we call the General Stud
ies program, embodies . . . gen
eral education by the registrar's
office ... to reach an education
al goal by a bookkeeping ar
rangement."
Two Effects
In his speech Packer outlined
the principal recommendations
of SES concerning both the
freshman year and later under
graduate education saying, "The
prime purpose of the Freshman
Year, we believe should be to
provide the most favorable cur
ricular setting we can for de
veloping a commitment to the
education of the mind."
The recommendations , re
vealed in the Daily ten days
ago, "should have two effects,"
according to Packer.
The first would be the "in
noculation with the virus of in
tellectual inquiry." Packer said,
"The undergraduate years ought
to be the time not for stuffing
one's head full of knowledge
but rather for learning how one
goes about acquiring knowl
edge."
The second desirable effect,
according to Packer, "is to pro
vide for the troubled and search
ing young people who come as
undergraduate models of suc
cessfully functioning adult be
havior. People learn by example
more than they learn by pre
cept."
Intellectual Analysis
"The joys and frustrations of
intellectual analysis are, in this
setting at least, the best ano
dyne against existential despair.
Few will deny, I think, that
what the world (not just the
young) needs today is more an
alysis and less despair. With
the teacher freer to teach what
he wants to teach and the stu
dent freer to learn what he
wants to learn, our undergrad
uates may be enabled to move
a bit in that direction."
In other remarks, Packer
praised acting president Glaser's
"feel for human relations" in
bringing students and others in
to studies of low-cost housing,
ROTC, Stanford Roasearch In
stitute and on-campus housing.
He said Glaser's action helped
stop these issues from "becom
ing the subject for sit-ins."
