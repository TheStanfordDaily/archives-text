# Interceptions Prove Fatal
## Stanford Salvages Tie With WSU 
### DAVE NOLAND 
An aggressive and alert Wash
ington State team killed four
Stanford drives with intercep
tions and turned one of them
into a touchdown Saturday
afternoon, as the Cougars bat
tled the favored visitors to a
21-21 tie in Spokane.
The loss of ends Jack Lassiter
and Bob Moore made an already
discouraging day even gloomier
for the Tribe. Lasater suffered
a separation of the right should
er when he was hit grabbing a
12-yard delay pass near the end
of the first quarter, and may be
lost for the season. Moore pulled
a hamstring muscle in the sec
ond stanza and will miss next
Saturday's UCLA game.
The Tribe started strong,
marching 85 yards in 14 plays
to score on their first series of
downs. The big play came on a
third-and-21 situation, when
Lasater leaped high to pull down
a 44-yard Plunkett pass.
Fullback Greg Broughton
bulled over from the one for the
score, but Steve Horowitz shank
ed the conversion attempt off to
the right.
The Indians forced WSU to

punt from deep in their own
territory and were cruising com
fortably toward another first
quarter TD with a first and 10
at the Cougar 15. But WSU de
fensive back Mark Williams
picked off Plunkett's pass at
the goal line and ran it out
to the 20.
WSU scored twice in the sec
ond quarter to go ahead 14-6.
Another interception led to the
first TD. Plunkett slipped a little
screen pass to Moore from the
Stanford 43, but Cougar Dave
Crema intercepted and ran it
back to the Tribe 28.
Buehler Missed
From there, WSU tailback
Richard Lee Smith hammered
away a couple of times at the
center of the Indian line, making
injured 260-pound George Bueh
ler's absence painfully obvious.
Quarterback Jerry Henderson
snuck it over from the one, and
the conversion made it 7-6 WSU.
The Cougars increased their
lead to 14-7 after a Stanford
drive fizzled on the 12 and Horo
witz missed a 19-yard field goal,
goal.
The key play in the Cougar's

second TD drive was a 49 yard
pass to flanker Larry Thatcher.
Thatcher just barely caught the
high throw, staggered, fell, then
tried to squirm for a few extra
yards on his stomach. Andy Car
rigan, a bit over-zealously per
haps, attempted to hinder
Thatcher's progress, ripping off
his helmet and drawing a 15-
yard penalty in the progress.
Four plays later, Henderson
snuck over aagin from the one,
the PAT was good, and Stanford
trailed 14-6 with just 1:48 left
in the half.
But Plunkett hit Gene Wash
ington for 25 yards with a min
ute left, and hit him again for
39 to the Cougar one with 25
seconds to go.
Two-Pointer Ties It
Plunkett took it over on a
keeper, and trotted off the field,
expecting the PAT unit to come
on. Coach John Ralston, how
ever, elected to go for the two
points. Plunkett was late getting
back to the huddle, and a five
yard delay of game penalty re
sulted. Unconcerned, Plunkett

zeroed in on Ron Kadziel at the
edge of the end zone for the
two pointer. The half i>nded at
*4-1-1.
Halfway through the third
quarter WSU struck again, with
Henderson hitting Thatcher for
a 30 yarder. Four plays later,
Henderson threaded a 12-yard
pass through six Stanford de
fenders for a touchdown. The
extra-point made it WSU 21,
Stanford 14.
The Tribe finally got a break
in the fourth quarter when Cou
gar R. L. Smith fumbled on his
own 41. After a couple of pitch
outs to Bubba Brown and an 18-
yard pass to Kadziel, Plunkett
found Washington in the end
zone for an 11-yard TD pass.
Horowitz kicked the vital con
version to tie it at 21-apiece with
6:18 left.
The last six minutes provided
plenty of action, but no points
for either side.
Game-Winner Nullified
Stanford got a tremendous
boost from Lady Luck with 1:37
left in the game. WSU quarter

back Henderson threw a bomb
from his own 33 intended for
danker Johnny Davis. Safety
Jim Kauffman had a safe three
steps on Davis, and went for
the interception. lie leaped high,
the ball bouncing off his chest,
and when he came down Davis
was heading for the end zone
With the ball tucked safely un
der his arm. But the game-win
ning touchdown was nullified by
an i'legal motion penalty against
VVSU.
The Tribe almost pulled off
the miracle they needed on the
last play of the game. WSU
quartorhack Henderson, going
for broke all the way, threw the
bomb with eight seconds left
from his own 32. Don Parish in
tercepted for Stanford, galloped
10 yards, and then lateraled to
Dick Oliver. Oliver headed down
the sidelines with blockers in
front of him, and for a moment
it seemed he might go all the
way. But a desperate WSU de
fender knocked him out of
bounds at the Cougar 25-yard
line as the final gun went off.
