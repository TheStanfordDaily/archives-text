# 30-20 Comeback Win
## Frosh 'Shock' USC 
### BOB FEDUNIAK 
Combining opportunism with
fierce determination, the Stan
ford frosh footballers hammered
out a come-from-behind 30-20
victory Friday over the visiting
USC Trobabes.
In an evenly matched game
marked by outstanding individ
ual performances, the difference
proved to be the running of Pa
poose fullback Hilary Shockley,
and Stanford's ability to capital
ize on numerous SC mistakes.
Shockley was magnificent as
he repeatedly sliced through the
Trobabe line for gains totalling
131 yards on 23 carries, includ
ing two 1-yard TD plunges.
Quarterback Miles Moore ran
the option beautifully to net 82
yards in 15 carries, but was able
to complete only 4 of 14 passes,
all of those to sure-handed flank
er Don Alvarado. Speedster
Jackie Brown, the other member
of the Papoose backfield, kept
finding linebackers and corner
men where they really shouldn't
have been, and was able to break
loose on only one of his sweeps.
But Brown's one long run, a
29-yard carry to the SC 8-yard
line, set up the initial score
early in the first period. Follow
ing a fumble recovery by Steve
Brooks on the Trobabe 37,
Brown carried to the 8, and on
the next play Moore found Alva
rado on the goal line for the
score.
Southern Cal came back to tie
it up later in the opening quar
ter when 3 consecutive pass com
pletions netted 61 yards and a
TD for marvelous Jimmy Jones,
the Trobabe's all-everything QB
from Pennsylvania. Jones, who
completed 14 of 20 for 212 yards
and had two others dropped in
the end zone, hit former St. Ig
natius star Bob Giorgetti for 29
yards and the score.
Midway through the second
period, Stanford took the lead
again when another SC fumble
set up a 39-yard drive and
Shockley's first 1-yard touch
down. The PAT attempt was
wide, and the Papooses led 13-7
at the half.
In the third quarter, SC
seemed to settle down, and on
the 7th play from scrimmage,
Giorgetti broke off tackle for a
52 yard TD run. After holding
the Papooses on downs, fum
bling, and then holding again,
Jones again threw three straight
completions for the score. This
time he covered 72 yards with

the tally coming on a 25-yarder
to Jim Heumann.
From here on, it was all Stan
ford. The Papooses took the
kickoff and scored 9 plays later
on a 37-yard field goal by Greg
Sampson. Then, as the fourth
period got underway, defensive
back Jim Lodato intercepted a
Jones pass on the Stanford 25
and returned it to the SC 30.
Four plays later, Shockley went
over from a yard out to make it
23-20.
Ten minutes later, Shockley
set up the final tally with a 38-
yard sprint to the Trobabe 12.
Moore ran a keeper for 12 yards
and 6 points to end the scoring.
The outcome of the game was
determined in large measure by
the Trobabe's inability to keep
from losing the ball to Stan
ford's aggresive, though some
what leaky, defense. Middle line
backer Jeff Siemon was partic
ularly outstanding, as he began
the game with an unassisted
tackle, ended it with an inter
ception, and kept up pretty
much the same pace in between.
