# Judicial Council Gains Faculty Jurisdiction
## 
### 
Stanford faculty accused of
violating the new campus dis
rupt ion policy are to be heard
by the same judicial council
that hears students.
In a 42-3 vote of the Academic
Senate, the new system of
campus rule-making recom
mended by the Committee of
Fifteen was applied to faculty.
Following identical procedures
for both students and faculty,
the Judicial Council has original
jurisdiction over the hearing of
violations and over appeal. Its
findings would be recommenda
tions to the University presi
dent.
Sanctions for the faculty
would range from censure — a
finding of violation without rec
ommendation of punishment —
to instigation of procedures
which could lead to dismissal.
The University's tenure state
ment, revised last year and ap
proved by both faculty and trus
tees, permits formal hearings
by the President's Advisory
Board in cases involving disci
plinary reductions in the salary
or recommendations for dismis
sal of faculty members. This
procedure would remain un
changed.
Created by the new judicial
system, besides the judicial
council, is the Student Conduct
Legislative Council (SCLC), a
student - faculty rule, asking
body committee. Both bodies
have faculty majorities.
'Shift of Power'
The proposal chartering the
two committees was developed
by the Committee of Fifteen last
spring and approved in prin
ciple by students, faculty, and
administrators at the time. The
new judicial plan has been de
scribed as "an extremely signi
ficant shift in power within the
University" by Prof. Hubert
Marshall, political science, who
headed this committee.
"For the first time," stated
Marshall, "students will have a
very important formal role in
creating the rules under which
they live."
Marshall stated that the place
ment of both students and fac
ulty under the same enforce
ment committee is an attempt
to make visible equality of
treatment.
Students on the Committee
of 15 voiced a desire to have a
student majority on the Judicial
Committee since it will usually
deal with the hearing of stu
dent violators. An alternate re
quest was the creation of a four
student—four faculty commit
tee, which would select its own
chairman.
Revisions
Revisions will be possible
when student endorsement of
the new policy expires next
March. According to one mem
ber of Clf>, a revision could call
for the creation of two student
faculty judicial councils. One,
possessing a student majority,
would have jurisdiction over the
violations of students, while the
other committee, consisting of

a faculty majority, would have
separate jurisdiction over fac
ulty hearings.
Another proposal, as ex
plained by law student Peter
Sehilla of the Temporary Ju
dicial Council, could create three
separate committees, an all-stu
dent board to hear student vio
lations, a faculty council to hear
faculty, and an all-stalf commit
tee to deal with violations of the
staff.
The Stanford Judicial Council
to replace the Temporary Judi
cial Council, headed by law Pro
fessor Jack Friedenthal, will
consist of four faculty mem

bers, appointed by the President
from nominees; four student
members, appointed by a stu
dent-faculty selection commit
tee; and a chanrman, appointed
by the President from the Law
School Faculty, who would vote
only to break ties.
The SCLC is to have a faculty
majority, but adoption or dele
tion of rules will not be possible
by unilateral action of either
students or faculty.
Until the Stanford Judicial
Council is selected, any cases
of faculty or student violation
will be handled by the Tempor
ary Council.
