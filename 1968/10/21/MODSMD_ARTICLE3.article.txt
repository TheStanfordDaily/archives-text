### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Stanford students are evenly
divided on whether or not
classes in ROTC should be piv
ea for credit, this week's Daily
Poll revealed.
Of the 122 students questioned
(one per ccnt of the student
body) 42.'A said ROTC should
have credit while 42.6% disa
greed, the rest offering no opin
ion.
Allowing the military groups
to use University facilities was
approved by a three-to-one mar
gin, however. (S -e table at end
of article.)
The poll, conducted by tele
phone Thursday through Sat
urday, sampled a cross-section
of the student body. The ques
tions asked were:
1) Do you think that th
classes in the various branches
of ROTC should be given for
academic credit?
2) Do you think that ROTC
should or should not be allowed
to use Stanford's facilities?
Many of those queried said
some ROTC courses — such as
drill and rifiery — should not
carry credit, while others should.
These were counted among
those supporting credit for mili
tary training classes.
Students who felt ROTC
should not have crcdit were also
asked if there were other
courses now offered which they
felt should also have credit for
them eliminated.
The most common reply was
physical education classes.
Graduate students were more
strongly opposed to ROTC credit
than undergrads. They voted it
down by a three-to-two margin,
while undergrads supported
credit by the same proportion.
A separate tally of students
who are now or have ever been
members of ROTC or any other
branch of the armed forces was
also kept. The opinions- of this
grour >vere surprisingly close to
1 12! oise of the student body as a
whole.

Of the 29 students in this
group, 15 l'elt credit should be
awarded, 11 opposed the idea,
while three had no opinion. The
three-to-one ratio for use of fa
cilities remained about the same.
The opposition to ROTC was
slightly higher among males
than among females.
The major support for ROTC
came from two areas: under
graduates in the general studies
program (those who have not
yet declared a major) and the
School of Engineering.
General studies students voted
in favor of credit for ROTC by
a four-to-one margin, while the
ratio was better than two-to-one
among engineers.
Students in the School of Hu
manities and Sciences offered
the major opposition to ROTC,
going against credit by a two
to-one margin.
If students in general studies
are excluded, almost half of
those remaining — and four
sevenths of those voting yes or
no — opted against credit.
The professional schools—law,
business, medicine, and educa
tion — voted slightly against
credit.
Next week's poll will deal
with the national elections.
