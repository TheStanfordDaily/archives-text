## TA Role Questioned 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Aministration officials replied
to political science teaching as
stated that his next step would
sistant (TAi demands for pay
raises with a request for a
sweeping reevaluation of the
training of graduate students.
In a letter to TA representa
tive Richard Young from Vice
Provost E. Howard Brooks, the
Administration responded to sal
ary demands made last Wednes
day bv all 11 political science
TA's. '
The TA's demanded immedi
ate pay increases of $700 per
year, a payment increase for de
pendents, and no increase in
current teaching loads.
In response, Brooks called for
a meeting this week that "will
lead to actions which can en
compass questions of salary as
well as questions of University
financing and the nature of ca
reer preparation for college and
university teaching."

Brooks made it clear that this
week's meeting will not bo lim
ited only to the political science
TA's salary demands, but will
be "an initial discussion" that
will consider salaries within the
context of all graduate student
teaching and general University
financing.
"At a more specific level, we
are concerned about the rela
tionship of service as a teaching
assistant to advanced graduate
training. At a more general lev
el, we are concerned about the
distribution of scarce resources
such that the University as a
whole may be as good as we can
all make it bo," Brooks ex
plained.
Brooks tlien asked the TA's to
consider four questions "so that
our discussion can deal with a
wider range of issues relevant
to tho teaching responsibilities
of advanced graduate students."
• "What is (and what should
bet the relationship between ad

vancod graduate education and
service as a teaching assistant?
• "Is a fixed stipend for all
teaching assistants to be pre
ferred over using demonstrated
financial need as the criterion
in setting stipends?
• "If a choice must he made,
is an across-the-board increase
for all teaching assistants to be
preferred over a system of de
pendency allowances?
• "To what extent should
graduate students depend upon
loans nr other forms of support
to finance part of the cost of
their education?"
TA Young had no response to
Brooks' letter since he had not
received it as of last night. He
stated that his next <tep would
he to meet with the depart
ment's TA's to develop plans
for the meeting with administra
tors.
The local graduate student un
ion's president, Andrew Yf n « s,

who is working closely with po
litical science TA's on the salary
issue, predicted that TA's from
several other departments may
soon join the political science
students in their demands.
Besides an anticipated state
ment of support from the mem
bership of Local 1816 of the
American Federation of Teach
ers, Moss said that TA's from
English and anthropology de
partments in specific may soon
support the demands. The ques
tion of representation from all
departments in future TA-Ad
ministration discussions remains
open.
Moss announced a graduate
union dinner meeting for tomor
row at <1 p.m. in Ihe Tresidder
dining room in order to discuss
the political science demands,
plan future action, and elect new
officers.
