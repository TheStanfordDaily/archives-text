UNITED NATIONS, N.Y.
(AP) — Well-placed diplomats
said Sunday they believe North
Vietnam wants to get a peace
settlement under way before the
next U.S. administration takes
office Jan. 20 and thus will ac
cept the latest reported U.S.
proposals on scaling down the
Vietnam war.
They said the acceptance
probably would come out
Wednesday at the preliminary
peace negotiations in Paris.
Hanoi's motivation for the
move, they theorized, would be
that in assessing the U.S. presi
dential campaign the North
Vietnamese concluded that,
whatever new administration
took office, it would be easier to
deal with if some sort of settle
ment already was in the works.
The diplomats, who declined
to be quoted, outlined points of
the U.S. proposal, which they
said was forwarded to the North
Vietnamese by the Frcnch in
Paris last Monday.
They said the proposal con
tains a U.S. offer to stop all
bombing of the North if North
Vietnam will say what it will
do then.
They said it also outlines re
ciprocal gestures that would be
welcomed by Washington, in
cluding: 1. An agreement to
send no more North Vietnamese
troops to South Vietnam, 2. Con
tinuation of the current lull in
attacks on South Vietnamese
towns and cities, and 3. North
Vietnamese action toward re
storing thf demilitarized char
acter of the so-called demilitar
ized zone between North and
South Vietnam by ending infil
tration across it.
The United States also in
quires in the proposals whether
North Vietnam will enter into
serious negotiations, as it has
indicated it would do, once the
bombing stopped, the inform
ants said.
They said the United States
expressnd willingness to let the
South Vietnamese National Lib
eration Front, political arm of
the Viet Cong, take part in final
negotiations, provided North
Vietnam will let South Vietnam
take part too.

• Poitical Roundup
WASHINGTON (AP)—Rich
ard M. Nixon, calling for a "De-
Americanization" of the Viet
nam war, says that what is
needed now is "a dramatic es
calation of the non-military as
pects of the struggle political,
economic, psychological and dip
lomatic.
The Republican presidential
nominee, replying to questions
put to him by editors of the New
Republic magazine, said the
Vietnam war is a new kind of
war, more of a political than a
military struggle.
Hubert H. Humphrey prom
ised Sunday to stem soaring
medical costs as president and
accused Republicans of "stub
bornly and callously" resisting
federal involvement in health
problems.
The vice president said his
Republican opponent for the
presidency, Richard M. Nixon,
originally attacked the medicare
bill as doing "more harm than
good."
Third-party presidential can

Sunday he is opposed to a bomb
ing halt in North Vietnam un
less the United States is assured
of clearly defined concessions by
Hanoi.
Wallace said also that his run
