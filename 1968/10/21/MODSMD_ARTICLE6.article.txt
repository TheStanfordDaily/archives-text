## Least Undesirable Candidate 
### SHELLEY STARK 
I protest the Stanford Com
munity's boycott of this year's
Presidential Election as a means
of repudiating our two party
system.
The American Party system is
imperfect. No one claims it is
not. To unite a widespread, di
verse, self-interested and splint
ered electorate has always ne

cessitatd compromise and modi
fication.
Attempting to accommodate
two hundred million people un
der only two major parties has
modulated American politics and
government, and served to bal
ance radical minorities. Such
was Madison's plan, as outlined
in the Federalist Papers, to pro

tect against the tyranny of a
powerful minority.
Following Madison's plan, we
have successfully incorporated
many of the goals and means of
socialism without becoming a
pure, Marxist, Socialistic state.
Similarly, though defeated,
Eugene McCarthy and his sup
porters advanced the tradition
ally un-democratic party con
vention ahead 50 years at the
Chicago Convention, Further,
McCarthy succeeded in remov
ing one generation from power
while incorporating the next one
into the political system.
Granted, this process of mi
nority influence is a slow one,
but purposefully so. Madison,
also in the Federalist Papers,
maintained that "peaceful
change" is the only lasting and
secure progress.
If, however, we are tired of
waiting and are impatient—im
patient for the poor, the Negro,
and the deprived, then the only
solution is to change this struc
ture, not to remain outside of
it, whether apathetically or an
tagonistically.
Increased rigidity, for the
sake of preservation on account
of fear and insecurity, results in
the programs of a Nixon or a
Wallace.
Conservative, middle-class
America, frightened and inse
cure, and dedicated to maintain
ing the status-quo, is attracted
to simplistic solutions like "law
and order."

As members of an academic
community concerned with gov
ernment and politics, we can no
longer afford the luxury of deal
ing in absolutes. We must com
promise and support the candi
date whose ends and means are
closest to our own.
Those who remain outside the
campaign, waiting for a resur
rection of the dead will be dis
appointed—there are only three
candidates and neither Robert
Kennedy nor Eugene McCarthy
will ride to victory on Novem
ber 5.
Those hoping to reconstruct a
defeated Democratic Party may
be as disappointed as the liberal
Republicans in 1968, following
the Goldwater disaster. Further,
with the election of Nixon or
Wallace, they will find the coun
try, 8 years from now, even fur
ther from their desired image.
And those who resort to vio
lence only force middle-class
America to embrace conserva
tism.
If we remain outside this cam
paign, acting like spoiled chil
dren who have not had their
way, we will find ourselves with
no spokesman on January 20.
The liberal cause and especially
that of the Negro for which
Hubert Humphrey has consis
tantly risked his political career,
will be dead.
Politics remains the "Art of
the Possible." Humphrey is our
only possibility.

Politics remains the "Art of

I protest the Stanford Com
munity's boycott of this year's
Presidential Election as a means
of repudiating our two party
system.
The American Party system is
imperfect. No one claims it is
not. To unite a widespread, di
verse, self-interested and splint
ered electorate has always ne

cessitatd compromise and modi
fication.
Attempting to accommodate
two hundred million people un
der only two major parties has
modulated American politics and
government, and served to bal
ance radical minorities. Such
was Madison's plan, as outlined
in the Federalist Papers, to pro

tect against the tyranny of a
powerful minority.
Following Madison's plan, we
have successfully incorporated
many of the goals and means of
socialism without becoming a
pure, Marxist, Socialistic state.
Similarly, though defeated,
Eugene McCarthy and his sup
porters advanced the tradition
ally un-democratic party con
vention ahead 50 years at the
Chicago Convention, Further,
McCarthy succeeded in remov
ing one generation from power
while incorporating the next one
into the political system.
Granted, this process of mi
nority influence is a slow one,
but purposefully so. Madison,
also in the Federalist Papers,
maintained that "peaceful
change" is the only lasting and
secure progress.
If, however, we are tired of
waiting and are impatient—im
patient for the poor, the Negro,
and the deprived, then the only
solution is to change this struc
ture, not to remain outside of
it, whether apathetically or an
tagonistically.
Increased rigidity, for the
sake of preservation on account
of fear and insecurity, results in
the programs of a Nixon or a
Wallace.
Conservative, middle-class
America, frightened and inse
cure, and dedicated to maintain
ing the status-quo, is attracted
to simplistic solutions like "law
and order."

As members of an academic
community concerned with gov
ernment and politics, we can no
longer afford the luxury of deal
ing in absolutes. We must com
promise and support the candi
date whose ends and means are
closest to our own.
Those who remain outside the
campaign, waiting for a resur
rection of the dead will be dis
appointed—there are only three
candidates and neither Robert
Kennedy nor Eugene McCarthy
will ride to victory on Novem
ber 5.
Those hoping to reconstruct a
defeated Democratic Party may
be as disappointed as the liberal
Republicans in 1968, following
the Goldwater disaster. Further,
with the election of Nixon or
Wallace, they will find the coun
try, 8 years from now, even fur
ther from their desired image.
And those who resort to vio
lence only force middle-class
America to embrace conserva
tism.
If we remain outside this cam
paign, acting like spoiled chil
dren who have not had their
way, we will find ourselves with
no spokesman on January 20.
