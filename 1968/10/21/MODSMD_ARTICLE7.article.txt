The following exerpt was
taken from a letter written by a
Mexican federal soldier to a
friend:
. what I thought would
be a gang of snot-nosed Idds
has become a revolt and may
be a revolution now that the
famous order to destroy a
door with a bazooka shell was
given, and you know what
force they have. ... Of those
that I could count there were
19 dead, some of which were
unrecognizable since they
were blown to pieces.
One of them impressed me
so much that I was sick at my
stomach and wanted to throw
up since his entire stomach
was destroyed, his leg was
missing and he was screaming
for his mother and said that
he hadn't done anything and
Lieutenant Reyes . . . gave the
order to shoot him to finish
him off.
