Republican Vice-Presidential hopeful Spiro As
new has quite unintentionally produced renewed
national interest in the subject of ethnic labels.
His off-the-cuff references to "Polacks" and
"Japs" are now famous remarks.
Indignant reactions of members of the Pol
ish and Japanese communities show that such
persons find Agnew's choice of ethnic labels as
offensive as young black folks do when they are
called "Negroes."
Many whites are mystified to hear that blacks
do not want to be called "Negro" anymore, which
assumes that it was all right to do so at one
time. But the label. "Negro" never did make sense
from the black point of view.
When the Irishman left Ireland and camf to
this country, he left his homeland an Irishman
and remained an Irishman on his arrival. When
the Italians left Italy, they left as Italians and
continued to be known as Italians in America.
It is the same with other minority groups.
But it is not so with black folks. When we were
stolen from the country of our birth, we left our
homeland as Africans and became "Negroes"
when we got to America. If we were African
when we left home, white America owes us an
explanation about what happened on the way
over to cause the changing of our name.
That history is well-known. We left our coun
try with the status of full-fledged human dig
nity only to be shackled on American shores
with the less-than-human indignity of slavery.
If labels must be applied, "Black" is the pro
per designation for black Americans. We left
Africa black and were just as black when we got
here.

Another aspect to the "Negro" label exempli
fies the depth of discrimination. There seems to
be an unconscious unwritten tradition in America
today that a first name indicates ownership. A
tavern or nightclub owner attaches his name to
his property to establish he is the controlling
party.
The same tradition applies to the many ethnic
groups which comprise the total population of
America. Traditional terminology refers to these
groups as Irish-Americans, Italian-Americans or
Chinese-Americans.
The unwritten assumption is that they are pari
owners of America. America belongs to them,
rather than their belonging to America. They
each have a role to play in determining the con
trolling policies of the American establishment.
There are two glaring exceptions to this un
written tradition — the American-Indian and
the American-Negro. The original owners of
America's soil are seldom referred to as Indian-
Americans. Nor are the emancipated slaves des
ignated as Negro-Americans. And it certainly
cannot be said that the term Afro-American has
been generally accepted by white America.
Since the first name indicates ownership, the
terms American-Indian or American-Negro seem
to mean that America owns the Indian and the
"Negro."
Perhaps when issues become more black and
white, without the confusing label of the mis
appropriated Spanish word "Negro" blocking the
path to trust and understanding, this country will
truly belong to the people who inhabit it and all
the fellow-owners of this soil can begin to struc
ture justice into the policies of this land.

Africa black and were just as black when we got
here.

Another aspect to the "Negro" label exempli
fies the depth of discrimination. There seems to
be an unconscious unwritten tradition in America
today that a first name indicates ownership. A
tavern or nightclub owner attaches his name to
his property to establish he is the controlling
party.
The same tradition applies to the many ethnic
groups which comprise the total population of
America. Traditional terminology refers to these
groups as Irish-Americans, Italian-Americans or
Chinese-Americans.
The unwritten assumption is that they are pari
owners of America. America belongs to them,
rather than their belonging to America. They
each have a role to play in determining the con
trolling policies of the American establishment.
There are two glaring exceptions to this un
written tradition — the American-Indian and
the American-Negro. The original owners of
America's soil are seldom referred to as Indian-
Americans. Nor are the emancipated slaves des
ignated as Negro-Americans. And it certainly
cannot be said that the term Afro-American has
been generally accepted by white America.
Since the first name indicates ownership, the
terms American-Indian or American-Negro seem
to mean that America owns the Indian and the
"Negro."
Perhaps when issues become more black and
white, without the confusing label of the mis
appropriated Spanish word "Negro" blocking the
path to trust and understanding, this country will
truly belong to the people who inhabit it and all
the fellow-owners of this soil can begin to struc
ture justice into the policies of this land.
Republican Vice-Presidential hopeful Spiro As
new has quite unintentionally produced renewed
national interest in the subject of ethnic labels.
His off-the-cuff references to "Polacks" and
"Japs" are now famous remarks.
Indignant reactions of members of the Pol
ish and Japanese communities show that such
persons find Agnew's choice of ethnic labels as
offensive as young black folks do when they are
called "Negroes."
Many whites are mystified to hear that blacks
do not want to be called "Negro" anymore, which
assumes that it was all right to do so at one
time. But the label. "Negro" never did make sense
from the black point of view.
When the Irishman left Ireland and camf to
this country, he left his homeland an Irishman
and remained an Irishman on his arrival. When
the Italians left Italy, they left as Italians and
continued to be known as Italians in America.
It is the same with other minority groups.
But it is not so with black folks. When we were
stolen from the country of our birth, we left our
homeland as Africans and became "Negroes"
when we got to America. If we were African
when we left home, white America owes us an
explanation about what happened on the way
over to cause the changing of our name.
That history is well-known. We left our coun
try with the status of full-fledged human dig
nity only to be shackled on American shores
with the less-than-human indignity of slavery.
If labels must be applied, "Black" is the pro
per designation for black Americans. We left
Africa black and were just as black when we got
here.
