Dan Be r r i g a n and eight
friends stood around a wire bas
ket full of napalmed draft files
last May reciting a wish that
Americans could "see by our
napalming what we are doing
to other people's nations."
"We napalm these draft rec
ords because napalm has burned
people to death in Vietnam,
Guatemala and Peru and may be
used in American grettos. We
believe some property has no
right to exist. Hitler's gas ov
ens, Stalin's concentration
camps, atomic - bacteriological -
weaponry, files of conscription
and slum properties are exam
ples," they said.
The nine waited to be ar
rested. They intend to appeal
to the American conscience, to
the recent history of our Nur
emberg judgments on those who
commit genocide. Last week, af
ter what we all knew would be a
brief, narrowly legal trial, they
were found guilty of various
charges of property destruction
and interfering with Ihe work
ings of the State.
It is safe to say that justice on
the question of the workings of
the American Empire will never
be meted out by our own courts.
By way of analogy, one would
hardly have expected acquittal
for a conscientious 'martyr' who

burned down one of Hitler's
camps if he were tried in Hit
ler's courts.
And it is not merely because
the American court is hopeless
ly corrupt: in fact, the court
found the Nine rightly guilty on
the charges, as the law goes.
The problem is that those courts
operate in a parochial and blind
context.
No one makes judgments
from another's perspective; we,
as fat, placid Americans see a
threat to our property and to
the 'civil rights' of those about
to be inducted and little more in
Berrigan's act.
As Dan's brother, Phil, put it,
"America can at this point treat
us as it will. If it can find jus
tice for us and for the grow
ing millions of citizens who re
fuse complicity in its crimes,'
then it will display a stamina of
reform in full accordance with
its national creed"
"If it cannot find justice for
us, then its cup of violence will
fill up and up, finally to brim
over. And at that mysterious
point, we defendants will have
been right in choosir.g revolu
tion over reform. Personally, I
have little doubt as to the de
cision this court will take in the
name of our country."
It will be the refusal of Ameri

cd to understand the demands
of justice and her willingness to
enforce the law above all that
will ultimately leave her at the
mercy of the world's rightful
anger.
For Dan Berrigan and his
Catholic brothers, all returned
from the corners of the Em
pire — from Peru, Honduras,
Vietnam, Dominican Republic,
Guatemala — bring with them
the demands of the world's peo
ple for peace and justice.
Sensitive, powerful, incredibly
articulate men, they have said in
their actions and lives what we
must soon hear: either human
rights win out over property
rights, or a bloody fate exists
for us all. Either we quickly
come to understand how cor
rupted we are and respond to
just acts, or we demand that
the wronged resort to revolu
tion.
Last week the Daily poll on
the SRI issue showed 25% of
Stanford students agreed with
SDS's demands that S.U. and
SRI get out of Southeast Asia.
The SDS put out a boautiful
'counter-poll' of the world's peo
ple, in which over eighty per
cent of the people agreed with
the SDS demand "that SRI stop
killing you."
Humor aside, the simple ques

tion is there: to whose needs do
you respond? Berrigan, I think,
speaks for those who are not
with us on this campus, and in
whose names we constantly
make decisions: the poor, the
black, the Asian, the Latin.
Berrigan will toe here this af
ternoon at 4:15 in Dinkelspiel.
He is now awaiting sentencing
of up to eighteen years for what
he did. But that is only the
court's opinion. Those of us who
must first figure out how to act,
how to live in this arrogant
world sh o ul d hear him and
judge for ourselves.
Time Is short, and there are
so few people worth hearing.

ter what we all knew would be a
brief, narrowly legal trial, they
were found guilty of various
charges of property destruction
and interfering with Ihe work
ings of the State.
It is safe to say that justice on
the question of the workings of
the American Empire will never
be meted out by our own courts.
By way of analogy, one would
hardly have expected acquittal
for a conscientious 'martyr' who

burned down one of Hitler's
camps if he were tried in Hit
ler's courts.
And it is not merely because
the American court is hopeless
ly corrupt: in fact, the court
found the Nine rightly guilty on
the charges, as the law goes.
The problem is that those courts
operate in a parochial and blind
context.
No one makes judgments
from another's perspective; we,
as fat, placid Americans see a
threat to our property and to
the 'civil rights' of those about
to be inducted and little more in
Berrigan's act.
As Dan's brother, Phil, put it,
"America can at this point treat
us as it will. If it can find jus
tice for us and for the grow
ing millions of citizens who re
fuse complicity in its crimes,'
then it will display a stamina of
reform in full accordance with
its national creed"
"If it cannot find justice for
us, then its cup of violence will
fill up and up, finally to brim
over. And at that mysterious
point, we defendants will have
been right in choosir.g revolu
tion over reform. Personally, I
have little doubt as to the de
cision this court will take in the
name of our country."
It will be the refusal of Ameri

cd to understand the demands
of justice and her willingness to
enforce the law above all that
will ultimately leave her at the
mercy of the world's rightful
anger.
For Dan Berrigan and his
Catholic brothers, all returned
from the corners of the Em
pire — from Peru, Honduras,
Vietnam, Dominican Republic,
Guatemala — bring with them
the demands of the world's peo
ple for peace and justice.
Sensitive, powerful, incredibly
articulate men, they have said in
their actions and lives what we
must soon hear: either human
rights win out over property
rights, or a bloody fate exists
for us all. Either we quickly
come to understand how cor
rupted we are and respond to
just acts, or we demand that
the wronged resort to revolu
tion.
Last week the Daily poll on
the SRI issue showed 25% of
Stanford students agreed with
SDS's demands that S.U. and
SRI get out of Southeast Asia.
The SDS put out a boautiful
'counter-poll' of the world's peo
ple, in which over eighty per
cent of the people agreed with
the SDS demand "that SRI stop
killing you."
Humor aside, the simple ques

tion is there: to whose needs do
you respond? Berrigan, I think,
speaks for those who are not
with us on this campus, and in
whose names we constantly
make decisions: the poor, the
black, the Asian, the Latin.
Berrigan will toe here this af
ternoon at 4:15 in Dinkelspiel.
He is now awaiting sentencing
of up to eighteen years for what
he did. But that is only the
court's opinion. Those of us who
must first figure out how to act,
how to live in this arrogant
world sh o ul d hear him and
judge for ourselves.
Time Is short, and there are
so few people worth hearing.
Dan Be r r i g a n and eight
friends stood around a wire bas
ket full of napalmed draft files
last May reciting a wish that
Americans could "see by our
napalming what we are doing
to other people's nations."
"We napalm these draft rec
ords because napalm has burned
people to death in Vietnam,
Guatemala and Peru and may be
used in American grettos. We
believe some property has no
right to exist. Hitler's gas ov
ens, Stalin's concentration
camps, atomic - bacteriological -
weaponry, files of conscription
and slum properties are exam
ples," they said.
The nine waited to be ar
rested. They intend to appeal
to the American conscience, to
the recent history of our Nur

commit genocide. Last week, af

threat to our property and to
the 'civil rights' of those about
to be inducted and little more in
Berrigan's act.
As Dan's brother, Phil, put it,
"America can at this point treat
us as it will. If it can find jus
tice for us and for the grow
ing millions of citizens who re
fuse complicity in its crimes,'
then it will display a stamina of
reform in full accordance with
its national creed"
"If it cannot find justice for
us, then its cup of violence will
fill up and up, finally to brim
over. And at that mysterious
point, we defendants will have
been right in choosir.g revolu
tion over reform. Personally, I
have little doubt as to the de
cision this court will take in the
name of our country."
It will be the refusal of Ameri

cd to understand the demands
of justice and her willingness to
enforce the law above all that
will ultimately leave her at the
mercy of the world's rightful
anger.
For Dan Berrigan and his
Catholic brothers, all returned
from the corners of the Em
pire — from Peru, Honduras,
Vietnam, Dominican Republic,
Guatemala — bring with them
the demands of the world's peo
ple for peace and justice.
Sensitive, powerful, incredibly
articulate men, they have said in
their actions and lives what we
must soon hear: either human
rights win out over property
rights, or a bloody fate exists
for us all. Either we quickly
come to understand how cor
rupted we are and respond to
just acts, or we demand that
the wronged resort to revolu
tion.
Last week the Daily poll on
the SRI issue showed 25% of
Stanford students agreed with
SDS's demands that S.U. and
SRI get out of Southeast Asia.
The SDS put out a boautiful
'counter-poll' of the world's peo
ple, in which over eighty per
cent of the people agreed with
the SDS demand "that SRI stop
killing you."
Humor aside, the simple ques

tion is there: to whose needs do
you respond? Berrigan, I think,
speaks for those who are not
with us on this campus, and in
whose names we constantly
make decisions: the poor, the
black, the Asian, the Latin.
Berrigan will toe here this af
ternoon at 4:15 in Dinkelspiel.
He is now awaiting sentencing
of up to eighteen years for what
he did. But that is only the
court's opinion. Those of us who
must first figure out how to act,
how to live in this arrogant
world sh o ul d hear him and
judge for ourselves.
Time Is short, and there are
so few people worth hearing.
