# Pedaling Profs
## See How They Ride 
### MELISSA S. PASSETT 
For once the Stanford faculty
is following in the tracks of its
illustrious students — bicycle
tracks. It has been estimated,
by several professors, that from
100 to 500 members of the teach
ing staff do bicycle to and from
classes.
Among the conventional rea
sons for this "unprofessional"
conduct were cited convenience,
exercise, solution to the parking
problem, and kindness to the
budget—"lt's better than buying
another car;" but Lewis Spitz,
Professor of history, staunchly

declares that he rides "to fight
the accumulation of cholesterol
in the middle-aged man."
Alas, even with so many posi
tive factors, some proverbial
strings are still attached, and
there have been minor com
plaints about other bicyclists,
"clumps of people at 11:50 who
block the way," pedestrians, and
the disconcerting situation of
getting caught in the rain "en
pedal."
Only Professor Spitz <-eems to
have found true contentment on
his bicycle: "I'm so much in
love with the world that I have
no pet peeves; everything goes
so well."
'Moment of Desperation'
Everything does not go so
well, however, for all professors
who commute in this way. Po
litical Science instructor, Pro
fessor Verba, has had his black
cycle disappear twice. Each time,
it was found on the other side
of campus, and he can only con
clude that "some student must
have borrowed it in a moment
of desperation."
Professors Lyman and Tarshis
and Mr. Robert Hamrdla, assis
tant director of the overseas
campuses, all claim the distinc
tion of having fallen from their
bikes while on the way to class.
But perhaps the most outstand
ing accident was the half-hour

delay in the summer quarter
Economics 1 final resulting from
Professor Rene Erbe's tumble
while en route to administer the
examination.
Due to their bicycling, many
of these pedagogues have be
come familiar campus personali
ties. At almost any time it is
possible to see Professor Spitz
on his English Ra'eigh or Pro
fessor Brucker of the Journalism
Department whizzing through
White Plaza on his little green
and silver mini-bike.
The Art of Cycling
Although last year several stu
dents were given tickets for
failure to obey traffic signs, Da
vid Grey, Assistant Professor of
Communications, is one of the
few faculty members to have
been similarly penalized. Dean
Smith and Professor Lyman
credit their exemption to luck,
admitting that while they have
never been ticketed, they do "de
serve that experience."
Professor Spitz may well have
summed up the local police re
action to faculty offenders: "I
zip in between the poles so fast,
I suppose they just decided not
to chase me."
Actually, some of these digni
fied educators are quite accom
plished in the art of cycling.
Professor Tarshis has ridden
since he was seven years old, (a
statement which can only be al
lowed if we accept the premise

that professors were once chil
dren), Professor Spitz has been
peddling around the campus for
eight years, and Robert McAf
fee Brown, Professor of Reli
gion, first took up the "muscle
toning" pastime when he was
doing graduate work on his PhD
thesis and discertation at Ox
ford.
Craze Spreading
This bicycling craze among
the more sedate members of the
University is rapidly spreading.
Several academic departments
now keep bikes for the staff to
use. Nancy Weston of the Jour
nalism Department voiced the
fee'ing of most campus bicy
clists, "We're lucky to get back
and forth alive with all of that
construction, the trucks and the
kids who don't stop at corners!"
Bicycling professors were very
willing to volunteer the names
of their pedaling colleagues, and
several even offered to pose for
pictures.
Professor Craig's erect pos
ture as he pedals around campus
does indeed "illustrate the style
one can bring to bike riding,"
although more of the instructors
were inclined to view the entire
situation as somewhat more
frivolous, and Professor Spitz
added with a chuckle, "And here
I thought the Daily had world
shaking things with which to
contend!"

OFF AND PEDALING — "I'm
so much in love with the world,"
claims History Prof. Lewis
Spitz (above). Political Science
Prof. Sidney Verba lives in a
cruder world: his bike has
been stolen twice.



TRAFFIC HAZARDS — Though Economies Prof. Lorie Tarshis
(above) has been a veteran cyclist since the age of seven, both he
and Dean of Students Joel Smith (below) have fallen off their
bikes on campus.
