# Two Victories Open Debating Season
## 
### DAVID DAVENPORT 
Stanford's debate team has of
ficially opened its 1968-69 sea
son as it fielded teams at the
Wyoming and M.I.T. tourna
ments last week. Debating this
year's proposition, "Resolved
that executive control of U.S.
foreign policy should be substan
tially curtailed," Stanford teams
forged impressive records at
each tournament.
Stanford sent two teams to
the University of Wyoming to
compete with over 100 teams
from 12 states. Defeating all op
ponents in the preliminary
rounds, both Stanford teams ad
vanced to the finals. The teams
of Stuart Baskin-Tom Goodhue,
and Ron Oster-Ed Oster tied for
first placed. On that basis, Stan
ford also received the huge
sweepstakes trophy, as it out
pointed runners-up Air Force
Academy, Brigham Young, and
the University of Nebraska.
Meanwhile the Stanford team
of John Peterson-Ken Philpot

qualified for the octa-Finals at
the M.I.T. tournament. How
ever, they were defeated in that
round by Brown University.
