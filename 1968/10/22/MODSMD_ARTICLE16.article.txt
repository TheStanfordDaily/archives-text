# SES Changes Please Science Professors
## 
### LETA ZUCKERMAN 
Many members of the biology
and psychology departments at
Stanford seem to be very
pleased with the new SES pro
posals for a revision of the Gen
eral Studies program.
Two proposals in particular
would affect the biology depart
ment: the elimination of the
mandatory biology requirement
for any student who did not
take a biology course in high
school and the elimination of
the laboratory science require
ment.
According to Donald Kennedy,
head of the department, and
Professor David Regnery, who
has been working with the SES
Committee, the first proposal
will have little or no influence
on the enrollment in elementary
biology courses. Last year Reg
nery distributed a questionaire
to determine the science back
ground of the class. Most had
had both biology and a physical
science and so would have a
choice anyway.
Regnery's main objection to
the requirement as it now
stands, however, is that the high
school courses are very irregu
lar. Some are so bad that they

do not in the least substitute
for a Stanford course, he said.
The second proposal would
have much more of an effect. If
the lab is eliminated, there
would undoubtedly be a decrease
in the number of students en
rolled in the Biology 4-5 series.
Regnery and Kennedy would be
happy to see this happen.
The proposal that would affect
the psychology department is
the suggested revamping of the
area requirements. The new re
quirements would obligate the
student to take any two courses
in the humanities, social sci
ences, and science.
Albert Hastorf, executive head
of the department, is very much
in favor of such a change, hop
ing it would decrease the num
ber of students in the basic psy
chology courses and would al
low the student to pursue a sub
ject in more depth. If the re
quirements were changed, more
specialized courses would also
be acceptable.
