# Napalm Priest Defends Deed
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
"Our trial excluded so much
of reality so as to be a pure
vacuum. It became the model
of the exclusion to truth and
reality from that of our own
society."
Father Dan Berrigan spoke
the words to a strongly sym
pathetic throng in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium yesterday after
noon.
Berrigan, a Catholic priest of
the Jesuit order, was found guil
ty last week of destroying gov
ernment property and related
acts. Specifically, the pr ie st,
along with nine others, was
convicted of napalming draft
records and files in Cantonville,
Maryland, last May.
Scheduled for Sentencing
Berrigan and the others, stand
to receive between ten to six

teen years imprisonment for
their actions. Sentencing is
scheduled Nov. 8.
"We were apprehended," said
Berrigan, "much against our
will for burning trash in pub
lic. We hadn't realized there
was a public ordinance against
this that was so severe."
The priest whose brother, al
so a priest, was convicted some
time ago for pouring blood on
draft files, said his act was a
gesture against "our death
dealing society." He said that
time had come to say no to
death.
Action Explained
Explaining what happened,
Berrigan said the group of nine
decided beforehand to carry the
fiiles outside and burn them in
a public lot across the street.
He explained that they de
cided not to run because they
wished to bring the question to
debate. "We had no thought of
saving our skin."
Berrigan called it a trial of
ironies.
"The legal game began to
crash in the first moments of
the trial. We abstained from se
lecting a jury. We took the first
twelve of those who walked
through that door."
"Purely American . . . Typical"
"They were purely American
. . . typical. They were twelve
bodies with one face. One
claimed he had not formed an
opinion on the war and yet
was a member of the American
Legion."
"The prosecution was done by
a black man and a Jew. This
was a twist of the knife of the
government. The black man
was the hangman," Berrigan
said.
"The black man was treated
like a nigger by the judge. He
acted like the plantation owner.
All the irony of the social in
stitution outside was being
acted out inside."
Berrigan at one point asked
the question, "Would the Jew
ish prosecutor have prosecuted
the nine of us in Germany dur
ing World War II for burning
one of Hitler's draft files?"

convicted of napalming draft
records and files in Cantonville,
Maryland, last May.
Scheduled for Sentencing
Berrigan and the others, stand
to receive between ten to six

teen years imprisonment for
their actions. Sentencing is
scheduled Nov. 8.
"We were apprehended," said
Berrigan, "much against our
will for burning trash in pub
lic. We hadn't realized there
was a public ordinance against
this that was so severe."
The priest whose brother, al
so a priest, was convicted some
time ago for pouring blood on
draft files, said his act was a
gesture against "our death
dealing society." He said that
time had come to say no to
death.
Action Explained
Explaining what happened,
Berrigan said the group of nine
decided beforehand to carry the
fiiles outside and burn them in
a public lot across the street.
He explained that they de
cided not to run because they
wished to bring the question to
debate. "We had no thought of
saving our skin."
Berrigan called it a trial of
ironies.
"The legal game began to
crash in the first moments of
the trial. We abstained from se
lecting a jury. We took the first
twelve of those who walked
through that door."
"Purely American . . . Typical"
"They were purely American
. . . typical. They were twelve
bodies with one face. One
claimed he had not formed an
opinion on the war and yet
was a member of the American
Legion."
"The prosecution was done by
a black man and a Jew. This
was a twist of the knife of the
government. The black man
was the hangman," Berrigan
said.
"The black man was treated
like a nigger by the judge. He
acted like the plantation owner.
All the irony of the social in
stitution outside was being
acted out inside."
Berrigan at one point asked
the question, "Would the Jew
ish prosecutor have prosecuted
the nine of us in Germany dur
ing World War II for burning
one of Hitler's draft files?"
