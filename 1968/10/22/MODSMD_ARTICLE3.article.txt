## ‘We Don’t Condone Strikes' 
### 
"The word 'union' has a bad
connotation for the white collar
worker. We don't condone
strikes; we believe in settling
differences through peaceful ne
gotiation."
This is the basic philosophy of
the newly-organized Stanford
Employees Association (SEA) as
expressed by its president, Mi
chael Fineo.
The group is aiming for the
standardization of labor policies
throughout the university. Ac
cording to Fineo, "many people
have worked here in fear" as a
result of "arbitrary" disciplinary
rules.
The organization is the first
attempt to organize Stanford's
4,000 non-faculty staff members.
So far, SEA has recruited about
500 members, and is actively
seeking more membership.
First Meeting
In April, a number of workers
in the physical plant, including
Fineo, a maintenance mechanic,
decided that representation of
workers was necessary to voice
employee grievances. In May, an
organizational meeting was held,
and officers were elected during
the summer. Joseph Scroggs,
Stanford's Director of Personnel,
reports that he has not yet had
dealings with the group as an
official organization.
Fineo recently replaced former
president Ken Croft who was
fired by Stanford for reasons not
related to his SEA activities.
SEA docs not dispute Croft's dis
missal.
Other officers include SEA sec
retary Mrs. Elizabeth McKenzie,
a secretary in the Medical Cen

ter, and treasurer Bud Meyer, an
electrician in the physical plant.
Committee chairman selected
were Henk van den Haak, a cabi
net maker in the physical plant,
Grievance Committee: Geoffrey
Jones, a technician at the Han
sen Laboratories, Membership
Committee: Daniel West, a prop
erty control assistant at Hansen
Laboratories, Public Relations;
and Robert Mills, a staff assis
tant at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center, Wages, Hours,
and Working Conditions Com
mittee.
Inconsistencies
According to SEA, wage
scales and fringe benefits are in
consistent. Robert Mills has been
researching the various wage
rates within the university, and
commented that some of them
are remarkably low. He also
added that it is quite difficult to
obtain wage information and
suggested that staff members
need not submit their names,
merely information on their
wages and their job to SEA. The
group's address is P.O. Box
6964, Stanford.
Mills is also compiling data
on the pay scales in other
schools and industries in an at
tempt to compare them with
Stanford's. "In some respects,
Stanford's pay scales compare
favorably with those of other
schools on the peninsula," he
said.
SEA complains that fringe
benefits arc not "up-to-date."
Fineo said that the group will
be striving for a wider choice
of health plans for university
employees, more equitable re

tirement and pension plans, and
a more clearly defined seniority
system.
Fineo emphasized, however,
that "it is not our positi\3rr to
tell the university how to run
its business." He added, "We
just want to be able to work in
dignity and be treated as human
beings."
"We want to create a cordial
climate on campus which will be
of mutual benefit to both Stan
ford and the employees. We are
definitely not trying to destroy
Stanford."
Business Conduct
Fineo said that SEA members
are careful not to conduct SEA
business on "company time." He
encourages employees to "obey
orders and let us handle griev
ances."
He said that there have been
"no problems at all" from the
various departments where
members work or from the uni
versity administration. Manage
ment of the physical plant "re
sponded immediately" to cooper
ate with the group, he said.
In turn, Personnel Director
Scroggs said, "It has been the
university's policy that em
ployees are free to join any
group. We have had no reason
to have a different attitude to
ward this group.
"We view any sort of organi
zation with such aims and atti
tudes as perfectly proper and
appropriate. So far, they have
been very cooperative and very
constructive."
No Threat
Scroggs said, "You won't find
any officers of the university

who consider the employees as
sociation a threat." He added
that the university is willing to
cooperate with the group.
As Director of Personnel,
Scroggs reports to Alf Brandin,
Vice President for Business.
SEA is currently considering
the possibility of affiliating with
the California School Employees
Association (CSEA). CSEA has
a membership of over 37,000,
and works to initiate legislation
to benefit California schools and
their employees.
An SEA group on Fair Em
ployment Practices is planning
to sponsor a discussion with a
panel representing many differ
ing points of view before formu
lating a group policy.
Fineo said that the organiza
tion is planning to hold its next
general meeting at the end of
the month.
