# Student Committee To Review Budget
## 
### 
Three students have been ap
pointed to a special review com
mittee on the University budget.
The students, appointed by
ASSU President Denis Hayes
will serve in a parallel position
to an all-faculty body to be se
lected by the Academic Senate.
University Vice-President for
Finance Kenneth Cuthbertson

told the Daily that he saw the
students as having "a review
role in priorities" such as health
care, library renovation and sal
aries. He said that the student
involvement will "not be as de
tailed" as many might think.
Cuthbertson pointed out that
"planning in the University is
decentralized" and the final re
view committees only examine
general priorities.
He emphasized, "I don't see
this as a potential joint student
faculty committee" though he
added that the students will hear
the "same presentation" as the
faculty group which has not yet
been formed.
In the past, the Committee on
University Policy has handled
the budget review, but with the
creation of the Academic Senate
a new committee will have to
be formed.
Hayes, in announcing the cre
ation of the committee, said "I
consider this to be a significant
step forward by the Administra
tion."
He listed three aims for the

members of the student commit
tee to: 1) Gain a broad un !er
standing of all that is involved
in the budget-making process,
which they (the students) will
then share with the student
body; 2) Participate with facul
ty representatives in a review
of the proposed budget guide
lines prior to the time these
guidelines are presented to the
trustees; and 3) Be available for
consultation on last-minute
budget problems whenever such
consultation is desired.
Students named to the review
committee by Hayes include
LASSU speaker Yale Braun
stein, graduate student in Eco
nomics, Mike Nolan, business
student and Tom Dawson, jun
ior in economics.
