### JOSHUA LEDERBERG 
The phrase "germ warfare"
evokes a moral revulsion which,
the ultra-rationalist can com
plain, is not strictly justified.
War is already awful; how nice
it would be to bypass its blood
and guts and evoke some clean,
almost symptomless disease in
stead.
From a military standpoint,

the ideal agent for BW (biologi
cal warfare) would be a com
pletely nonlethal but highly con
tagious virus that merely stupe
fied Its victims for a few hours
or days and for which the good
guys had a reliable antidote or
preventive antibody. This hypno
virus is a logically plausible
ideal, just as is the thought of
using mind-altering drugs as
chemical warfare agents. (LSD
was in fact studied by the U.S.
Army long before the hippies
discovered it.)
For the moment, however,
hypnovirus is a misleading pipe
dream. Most BW research is
claimed to be defensive. That is

it seeks to anticipate the worst
horrors an enemy might devel
op, then beat him to it so as to
know how to defend the popula
tion.
Needless to say, there is no
more ingenious device to ensure
the rapid escalation of offensive
capabilities.
Whether work is actively pro
ceeding in BW laboratories on
producing a hypnovirus, I do
not know. On the other hand
abundant reports have been
published showing researchers'
preoccupation with plague, an
thrax, rickettsia, tularemia, en
cephalitis virus and other equal

ly unpleasant and highly lethal
disease agents.
The most chilling thought is
that BW research has only just
begun to tap the potential of
fered by chemical genetics for
the systematic construction of
new disease agents. The an
nouncement of the artificial rep
lication of a virus DNA last De
cember was followed by some
rather premature talk about the
moral problems of replicating,
and altering, human DNA.
We have a much more imme
diate concern for the moral
problems of the engineering of
virus DNA for military pur
poses.
These anxieties have provoked
considerable bitterness in the
scientific community and even
demonstrations pointlessly mis
directed at the Army's biological
research laboratories at Ft. De
trick, Md.
In recent years, this installa
tion has concentrated on the
technology of handling danger
ous, infectious materials for re
search purposes. Its experience
is quite valuable for public
health work and has been open
ly published. (Exactly the oppo
site might be said for field test
ing operations.)
As we develop and publicize
this technology, we make easier
the proliferation of the darkest
arts throughout the world.
The makers of policy in Wash
ington, not the technicians at Ft.
Detrick, are the just targets of
criticism. And they should be
chastised less for any malevo
lent motives in this field than
for mere inertia, for technical
unfamiliarity, for blindness to
the pace of biological advance
and its accessibility to the most
perilous genocidal experimenta
tion.
The U.N. has had a long his
tory of abortive attempts to
start discussions on the control
of BW. These have been con
founded with issues of general
disarmament, with all-or-noth
ing demands about inspection
and with fears of confusion of
BW with tear gas, which might
make Unfavorable propaganda
for the United States.
Now, the British delegation
has introduced new initiatives
for BW controls and, evidently
with some reluctance, the U.S.
State Department has for the
first time agreed to substantial
technical studies. Time is run
ning out, and too little is left
to let BW remain merely an
other minor pawn whose dispo
sition is incidental to other set
tlements.

We have a much more imme

These anxieties have provoked
considerable bitterness in the
scientific community and even
demonstrations pointlessly mis

research laboratories at Ft. De
trick, Md.
In recent years, this installa

technology of handling danger
ous, infectious materials for re
search purposes. Its experience
is quite valuable for public
health work and has been open

site might be said for field test
ing operations.)
As we develop and publicize
this technology, we make easier
the proliferation of the darkest
arts throughout the world.
The makers of policy in Wash
ington, not the technicians at Ft.
Detrick, are the just targets of
criticism. And they should be
chastised less for any malevo
lent motives in this field than
for mere inertia, for technical
unfamiliarity, for blindness to
the pace of biological advance
and its accessibility to the most
perilous genocidal experimenta
tion.
The U.N. has had a long his
tory of abortive attempts to
start discussions on the control
of BW. These have been con
founded with issues of general
disarmament, with all-or-noth
ing demands about inspection
and with fears of confusion of
BW with tear gas, which might
make Unfavorable propaganda
for the United States.
Now, the British delegation
has introduced new initiatives
for BW controls and, evidently
with some reluctance, the U.S.
State Department has for the
first time agreed to substantial
technical studies. Time is run
ning out, and too little is left
to let BW remain merely an
other minor pawn whose dispo
sition is incidental to other set

The phrase "germ warfare"
evokes a moral revulsion which,
the ultra-rationalist can com
plain, is not strictly justified.
War is already awful; how nice
it would be to bypass its blood
and guts and evoke some clean,
almost symptomless disease in
stead.
From a military standpoint,

the ideal agent for BW (biologi
cal warfare) would be a com
pletely nonlethal but highly con
tagious virus that merely stupe
fied Its victims for a few hours
or days and for which the good
guys had a reliable antidote or
preventive antibody. This hypno
virus is a logically plausible
ideal, just as is the thought of
using mind-altering drugs as
chemical warfare agents. (LSD
was in fact studied by the U.S.
Army long before the hippies
discovered it.)
For the moment, however,
hypnovirus is a misleading pipe
dream. Most BW research is
claimed to be defensive. That is

it seeks to anticipate the worst
horrors an enemy might devel
op, then beat him to it so as to
know how to defend the popula
tion.
Needless to say, there is no
more ingenious device to ensure
the rapid escalation of offensive
capabilities.
Whether work is actively pro
ceeding in BW laboratories on
producing a hypnovirus, I do
not know. On the other hand
abundant reports have been
published showing researchers'
preoccupation with plague, an
thrax, rickettsia, tularemia, en
cephalitis virus and other equal

ly unpleasant and highly lethal
disease agents.

that BW research has only just
