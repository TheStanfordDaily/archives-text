Glenn Campbell has done it again.
At last week's meeting of the University of California Regents,
Governor Reagan introduced a resolution that would have re
moved virtually all powers delegated to the faculty or the nine
campuses of the UC system. These powers include the
right to govern, appoint professors, and authorize courses.
The Reagan resolution was defeated 14 to 7, but Hoover Insti
tution director and Regent Glenn Campbell, a Reagan appointee,
was one of the seven blind followers of the blind governor.
We believe in academic freedom and the fundamental rights
and primary responsibility of faculty in decisions of appointment
and government. If modification is due, it is the direction of more
student decision-making, not Regent or Trustee decision-making.
Glenn Campbell has, in less than one year as Regent, labored
to destroy the University of California under the direction of
education's Don Quixote, Ronald Reagan. Campbell's inane
actions only confirm our worst suspicions about his handling of
the Hoover Institution, already a blight on the Stanford name.

We have been informed by SDS that yesterday's editorial
misrepresented their demands to the University and Stanford
Research Institute. The October 14 deadline, they say, applied
only to the publication of information about SRI funding and
projects —not to the cessation of military and economic projects
in Southeast Asia. The SDS position was clarified in a letter to
the Daily published on October 18.
