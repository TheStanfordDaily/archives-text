## Bay Of Pigs Revisited 
### ART BUCHWALD 
The announcement of Mrs.
Jacqueline Kennedy's marriage
to Greek ship owner Aristotle
Onassis caught most people by
surprise. The Jackie-watchers
had been so intent on keeping
tabs on Lord Harlech that on
ly a skeleton force had been
watching the Greek coast. And
apparently these watchers had
gotten fat

so utterly failed in having any
intelligence available on the
Jackie-Onassis romance.
"There was a breakdown be
tween ourselves and the Greek
intelligence sources. They re
ported that there was absolute
ly no action on the Island of
Scorpios, which Onassis owns.
The Christina, Onassis' yacht,
has been on a good-will mission
to Venim and Maria fai'ac

Didn't Marry Lord Harlech'?"
the JKIA director said.
"Gentlemen," said the presi
dent of the Gossip Columnists
Union, "There is no sense cry
ing over spilled milk. The ques
tion is, what do we do now?"
"I say invade the Island of
Scorpios," said a TV executive
who was a retired general. "We
can't let the honeymoon take
place without us being there."
