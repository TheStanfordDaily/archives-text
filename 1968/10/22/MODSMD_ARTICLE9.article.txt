• Peace Hopes Rise
WASHINGTON (AP) — Com
munist leaders in Hanoi are be
lieved by Washington officials to
be in the final stages of debate
on whether and how to accept
U.S. terms for an end to the
bombing of North Vietnam.
Agreement between Washing
ton and Hanoi on a 36-hour lo
cal ceasefire around the North
Vietnamese city of Vinh to per
mit the safe return of 14 North
Vietnamese seamen could be a
hopeful sign of some broader
understanding to come.
U.S. officials discount any di
rect connection between the
Vinh ceasefire deal and the far
greater issues involved in a
bombing halt. But diplomats in
Hanoi very likely intended some
significance in its agreement to
the Vinh suspension of hostili
ties at just this time.
A far more important reason
advanced for cautious optimism
about a de-escalation accord be-
North Vietnam is that North
Vietnam has made such heavy
cutbacks in its forces in the
South.
• Ronnie Attacks UC
SANTA BARBARA (AP)
Gov. Reagan included the ma
jority of his fellow University
of California regents Monday
in a bitter attack on "the sorry
campus environment" he says
exists in the UC system.
The Republican governor ac
cused fellow regents of failing
even to maintain order at their
own meetings, referring in par
ticular to a session at Santa

Cruz last Thursday and Fri
day.
"Even in a third-rate saloon
a modicum of order is main
tained," the angry governor, an
ex-officio regent himself, said.
"The people are alarmed . . .
They are angry . . . They are
demanding that the university
be governed by regents . .
Reagan, in a speech to a
Santa Barbara club, said, "The
people have not turned this in
stitution over to the faculty to
rule by insubordination, or to
administrators to rule through
appeasement and capitulation,
or to students to rule by coer
cion," Reagan said. He said
the Santa Cruz meeting was
"characterized by coercion, ag
gression and ugly efforts to dis
rupt."
• Grape Suit Filed
SAN JOSE (AP) — Three
Stanford law students filed a
suit in U.S. District Court here
Monday asking that Safeway
Stores be enjoined against any
further sale of table grapes
grown in California.
Alan Rador, Ronald Bominen
and Martin Richner filed the
suit in Judge Robert F. Peck
ham's court, charging that
grapes are picked in fields
where no toilet facilities are
provided and no drinking wa
ter provided. The lack of toi
lets, said the suit, means that
grapes could become contami
nated and spread disease.
The general consumer class
suit was filed in federal court,
the plaintiffs said, because of a
diversity of citizenship since

Safeway is incorporated in
damages.
• Olympics Continue
MEXICO CITY (AP)—United
States swimmers continued to
dominate their specialties in
Olympic competition Monday,
collecting six more medals in
cluding two gold and scoring
their fourth 1-2-3 sweep of the
Games.
Doug Russell of Midland,
Tex., started the American
swimming sweep with a 55.0
clocking for the gold medal in
the men's 100-meter butterfly,
whipping across the finish line
just ahead of teammates Mark
Spitz and Ross Wales.
Spitz, of Santa Clara, Calif., a
bronze medalist in the 100-meter
freestyle, took the silver award
and Wales, of Youngstown,
Ohio, captured the bronze.
• Political Roundup
Vice President Hubert H.
Humphrey and Richard M.
Nixon continued to hack at one
another on the issues of law
and war in Monday's presiden
tial campaigning, while third
party candidate George C. Wal
lace spelled out a farm program
in lowa.
He charged Humphrey is
the "do-nothing candidate on
law and order."
The vice president, in New
York, presented himself as a
man of peace who has "not sup
ported massive escalation" and
has sought "de-escalation and
bombing pauses." Humphrey
also said Nixon "has not the
foresight of a man of peace."
• Jackie & Tellis
SCORPIOS ISLAND, Greece
(AP) — Practically alone at
last, Jacqueline Kennedy Onas
sis and her wealthy Greek bride
groom may start their honey
moon cruise Tuesday. The word
from the 62-year-old bride
groom, Aristotle Onassis, was:
j "Perhaps."

The decision apparently de
pended on some break in the
foul weather that started roiling
this section of the lonian Sea a
few hours before Onassis mar
ried the 39-year-old Roman
Catholic widow of President
John F. Kennedy in a Greek Or
thodox ceremony Sunday.
The yacht Christina rocked
the couple in snug luxury at her
dock on this private paradise
Monday night after they sped

departing wedding guests by
speedboats through wind, rain,
sleet and uncommon cold to the
nearby island of Levkas for
flights to the mainland.
Among those departing was
an American Secret Service man
wearing the PTIO9 tieclasp that
President Kennedy enjoyed giv
ing to his friends. Henceforth,
Jacqueline apparently will be
free of such bodyguards, pro
vided by Congress.
