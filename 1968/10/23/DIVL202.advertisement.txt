the "something good"

X^^^wkingfo^*^^
When you go shopping for "something really good" In sterMt
equipment, you usually have to pay more than you expected,
or settle for something less than you expected.
The KLH'ModelTwenty-Four changes that situation radically.
The Model Twenty-Four is a complete stereo music system.
Its performance and sound quality are close—very close—to
that of the best equipment that KLH, or anyone else, makes.
But it costs only a fraction of what it sounds like. And It fits
gracefully into any living room,
There's nothing missing from the Model Twenty-Four. It
has a sensitive, drift-free FM stereo tuner, a custom-made
Garrard record changer with Pickering cartridge and diamond
stylus, plus jacks for external equipment and for making tape
recordings. The solid-state circuitry Is powerful enough for
any living room, and the unobtrusive speaker cabinet* contain
a pair of full-range, two-speaker systems.
The modest size and price of the Twenty-Four are the rewlt
of advanced engineering instead of corner-cutting. Everything
from its components to its oiled-walnut cabinetry Is designed
to provide a genuine surprise rather than that "nice for th*
money" feeling.
