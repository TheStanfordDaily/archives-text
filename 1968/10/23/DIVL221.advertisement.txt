Who says the law
is always right?
Draft cards are burning. Riots
ignite our cities. "Protest!" is the
cry of the day. The fast-grow
ing attitude is: If you think the
law is wrong—break it!
What's your stand? Is this a
national outrage ... or is the old
"patriotism" obsolete?
Our country was founded on
rebellion—on the right to pro
test. But can open defiance be
defended?
Many dissenters justify their
stand on the issue of personal
creed. "The Vietnam war is im
moral!" is their cry. This dual
loyalty to state and convictions
has been a dilemma for centuries.
But how often are men governed
by emotion or human opinion—
instead of spiritual facts?
What are these facts? Our
booklet "The Christian and His
Country" discusses the current
ferment from a Christian point
of view. It offers yardsticks for
measuring unquestioned loyalty
—and valid dissension.lt reminds
citizens how especially in an
election year they can—in fact
MUST—act to create laws within
which they can live. Send for it!
