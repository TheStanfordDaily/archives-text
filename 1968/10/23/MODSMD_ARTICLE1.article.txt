# Pro-Cleaver Sit-In At Berkeley Ends With 120 Student Arrests
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
The realization of more than
a half decade of dreams will
come to fruition within a few
days in Tresidder Union as the
Stanford Community Coffee
House opens its doors to the
public.
The establishment of a coffee
house has faced obstacles of
false starts, temporary sites, and
administrative accusations in its
struggle for existence, in the
past.
But with the assistance of
Fred Saas and twenty students
who have lent their support as
well as the aid of Tresidder
Union in supplying space and
necessary finances the experi
ment was finally undertaken.
The exact location is the old
billiard room which has been
revamped with redwood panel
ing, carpets, boat hatch cover
tabletops, stage and sound
equipment, and over 150 wooden
captains chairs. The billiard tab
les have been moved to the ping
pong room.
This past spring lent substan
tial impetus to the coffee house
with a student referendum tak
ing reaction to its creation. More
than 90 per cent voted for the
creation of a permanent coffee
house.
But since, according to Saas,
there has been very little help
offered from the community.
Various departments and indi
viduals which had shown inter
est in helping have since con
tributed little support.
The official opening of the
house, which has yet to receive a
name other than the Stanford
Community Coffee house, has
been set for November 1, but
the opportunity to try things out
and put things in operating or
der encouraged operators to
open early "unofficially."
It is expected a contest of
sorts will be held shortly to give
the house a name.
The coffee house will be equip
ped with a new expresso ma
chine, and will offer a pickle
barrel and sandwiches as well.
The House claims the food

will be the "finest attainable,"
and wili offer a menu quite un
like that of the Tresidder cafe
teria.
According to Saas the menu
will be open to change or sug
gestions from any of the coffee
house patrons at any time. The
menu is expected to change
periodically in order to appeal
to the entire community.
"We will change," remarked
Saas, "according to demand.
This is Stanford's coffee house,
and it is up to the Stanford
students and faculty to make it."
The price range is expected
to be comparable with the var
ious local coffee houses.
Saas thinks that restaurants
are on the way out.
"Restaurants today are simply
a replacement for the old pub.
We have gone from what a res
taurant should be. The coffee
house is an answer to this. It
takes away the cold cafeteria at
mosphere."
"We emphasize that the coffee
house will be extremely versa
tile. It will not be dominated by
any particular group."
The coffee house has set tenta
tive hours at 11:30 a.m. to 5:00
p.m. and 7 p.m. to 2 a.m.
It is expected it will help to
relieve crowded conditions in the
Tresidder food service during
the lunch hours.
Presently the coffee house is
engaged in a search to find em
ployees to work in three hour
shifts. The work will be re
munerative.
Entertainment will be much a
part of the coffee house with
poets, folk singers, and so forth
being the offering. But Saas em
phasizes that the coffee house
is a place for communication
and for this reason entertain
ment will not be a substitute for
conversation and dialogue.
Saas says that the house may
be open for artists to exhibit as
one outlet for showing their
work.
As of yet entertainment for
opening day, that is the "official"
opening of November 1 has not

been confirmed and volunteers
are needed to perform. The
House is in need of musicians,
poets and others. Anyone inter
ested is urged to sign-up at Tre
sidder desk for auditions, which
will take place Sunday after
noon from 1:00 till 5:00 in the
Coffee House.

A sit-in on the troubled Ber
keley campus was broken up
late last night when campus po
lice moved in and arrested near
ly 120 demonstrators in Sproul
Hall.
They were protesting the de
nial of credit in the racism
course, Social Analysis 139 X, in
which Black Panther leader Eld
ridge Cleaver was a guest lec
turer.
The demonstrators, many of
whom were students in the con
troversial Cleaver course, had
defied Administration warnings
to leave the Berkeley Admini
stration building by the 7 p.m.
closing time.
More than 2,500 onlookers
were massed outside, at times
blocking traffic on Bancroft Ave
nue, which runs past the build
ing.
Rocks Thrown
There were reports of rocks
thrown at an Alameda County
sheriff's department bus and
that one small bus owned by
the university police had been
overturned twice.

University authorities said the
arrested students would be
booked by university police for
unlawful assembly and then
turned over to sheriff's depu
ties for transfer to the county
prison farm at Santa Rita.
Among the first arrests was
Dr. Edward Sampson, sociology
professor who is one of the
faculty sponsors of the course,
Social Analysis 139 x.
Do Your Thing
The sit-in began shortly after
Cleaver gave his third lecture
in Dwinelle Hall. In it Cleaver
said "If you think this is worth
while, then do your thing."
A statement distributed by stu
dents taking the course read:
"We will remain at the regist
rar's office until credit is grant
ed."
Before the building was closed
at 7 p.m. vice chancellor R. L.
Johnson told the demonstrators
they faced arrest if they did not
leave.
They stayed and voted that if
arrested they would refuse bail

until their arraignment and fast
while in jail.
Outside the hall some 300 to
400 students, sympathizers of
those inside as well as curious
spectators looked on. Police had
hoped the crowd would disperse
but at the time the arrests were
finally made at 11 p.m. a hostile
mob estimated at 2,000 students
milled around outside.
On Sept. 20 the UC Board of
Regents voted that a guest lec
turer could make only one ap
pearance in a course for credits.
Sponsors of the student-initi
ated course then decided to con
duct it on a non-credit basis so
that Cleaver, a convict on parole,
could give 10 lectures. But they
pushed a fight for credit.
Governor Reagan said last
night the people "shouldn't have
to put up with" demonstrations
such as occurred at the Univer
sitv last night.
The Republican governor
called for firm deaing with those
involved in the sit-in.
"I don't think the administra
tion should negotiate with them,"

Reagan told reporters when he
arrived at the Sacramento Mu
nicipal Airport. Reagan called
the demonstration the "inevita
ble result of appeasement and
appeasement in the policy fol
lowed by the university adminis
tration for too long a time."
Assembly Speaker Jesse Un
ruh, who will be on campus to
day at noon in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium, said that if Cleaver
provoked or counseled the sit
in he should be "permanently
barred from future appearances
as a lecturer at the university."
A bomb threat was received
around 9 p.m. in the student un
ion building and the building
was cleared temporarily but not
before some 200 of those out
side Sproul Hall managed to
push their way in. The students
were protesting the closing of
the student union which nor
mally closes at 12:00.
The students were told of the
threat and were evacuated. The
Union was opened again soon
after the threat was diagnosed
a hoax.

A bomb threat was received
around 9 p.m. in the student un
ion building and the building
was cleared temporarily but not
before some 200 of those out
side Sproul Hall managed to
push their way in. The students
were protesting the closing of
the student union which nor
mally closes at 12:00.
The students were told of the
threat and were evacuated. The
Union was opened again soon
after the threat was diagnosed
a hoax.

The realization of more than
a half decade of dreams will
come to fruition within a few
days in Tresidder Union as the
Stanford Community Coffee
House opens its doors to the
public.
The establishment of a coffee
house has faced obstacles of
false starts, temporary sites, and
administrative accusations in its
struggle for existence, in the
past.
But with the assistance of
Fred Saas and twenty students
who have lent their support as
well as the aid of Tresidder
Union in supplying space and
necessary finances the experi
ment was finally undertaken.
The exact location is the old
billiard room which has been
revamped with redwood panel
ing, carpets, boat hatch cover
tabletops, stage and sound
equipment, and over 150 wooden
captains chairs. The billiard tab
les have been moved to the ping
pong room.
This past spring lent substan
tial impetus to the coffee house
with a student referendum tak
ing reaction to its creation. More
than 90 per cent voted for the
creation of a permanent coffee
house.
But since, according to Saas,
there has been very little help
offered from the community.
Various departments and indi
viduals which had shown inter
est in helping have since con
tributed little support.
The official opening of the
house, which has yet to receive a
name other than the Stanford
Community Coffee house, has
been set for November 1, but
the opportunity to try things out
and put things in operating or
der encouraged operators to
open early "unofficially."
It is expected a contest of
sorts will be held shortly to give
the house a name.
The coffee house will be equip
ped with a new expresso ma
chine, and will offer a pickle
barrel and sandwiches as well.
The House claims the food

will be the "finest attainable,"
and wili offer a menu quite un
like that of the Tresidder cafe
teria.
According to Saas the menu
will be open to change or sug
gestions from any of the coffee
house patrons at any time. The
menu is expected to change
periodically in order to appeal
to the entire community.
"We will change," remarked
Saas, "according to demand.
This is Stanford's coffee house,
and it is up to the Stanford
students and faculty to make it."
The price range is expected
to be comparable with the var
ious local coffee houses.
Saas thinks that restaurants
are on the way out.
"Restaurants today are simply
a replacement for the old pub.
We have gone from what a res
taurant should be. The coffee
house is an answer to this. It
takes away the cold cafeteria at
mosphere."
"We emphasize that the coffee
house will be extremely versa
tile. It will not be dominated by
any particular group."
The coffee house has set tenta
tive hours at 11:30 a.m. to 5:00
p.m. and 7 p.m. to 2 a.m.
It is expected it will help to
relieve crowded conditions in the
Tresidder food service during
the lunch hours.
Presently the coffee house is
engaged in a search to find em
ployees to work in three hour
shifts. The work will be re
munerative.
Entertainment will be much a
part of the coffee house with
poets, folk singers, and so forth
being the offering. But Saas em
phasizes that the coffee house
is a place for communication
and for this reason entertain
ment will not be a substitute for
conversation and dialogue.
Saas says that the house may
be open for artists to exhibit as
one outlet for showing their
work.
As of yet entertainment for
opening day, that is the "official"
opening of November 1 has not

been confirmed and volunteers
are needed to perform. The
House is in need of musicians,
poets and others. Anyone inter
ested is urged to sign-up at Tre
sidder desk for auditions, which
will take place Sunday after
noon from 1:00 till 5:00 in the
Coffee House.

A sit-in on the troubled Ber
keley campus was broken up
late last night when campus po
lice moved in and arrested near
ly 120 demonstrators in Sproul
Hall.
They were protesting the de
nial of credit in the racism
course, Social Analysis 139 X, in
which Black Panther leader Eld
ridge Cleaver was a guest lec
turer.
The demonstrators, many of
whom were students in the con
troversial Cleaver course, had
defied Administration warnings
to leave the Berkeley Admini
stration building by the 7 p.m.
closing time.
More than 2,500 onlookers
were massed outside, at times
blocking traffic on Bancroft Ave
nue, which runs past the build
ing.
Rocks Thrown
There were reports of rocks
thrown at an Alameda County
sheriff's department bus and
that one small bus owned by
the university police had been
overturned twice.

University authorities said the
arrested students would be
booked by university police for
unlawful assembly and then
turned over to sheriff's depu
ties for transfer to the county
prison farm at Santa Rita.
Among the first arrests was
Dr. Edward Sampson, sociology
professor who is one of the
faculty sponsors of the course,
Social Analysis 139 x.
Do Your Thing
The sit-in began shortly after
Cleaver gave his third lecture
in Dwinelle Hall. In it Cleaver
said "If you think this is worth
while, then do your thing."
A statement distributed by stu
dents taking the course read:
"We will remain at the regist
rar's office until credit is grant
ed."
Before the building was closed
at 7 p.m. vice chancellor R. L.
Johnson told the demonstrators
they faced arrest if they did not
leave.
They stayed and voted that if
arrested they would refuse bail

until their arraignment and fast
while in jail.
Outside the hall some 300 to
400 students, sympathizers of
those inside as well as curious
spectators looked on. Police had
hoped the crowd would disperse
but at the time the arrests were
finally made at 11 p.m. a hostile
mob estimated at 2,000 students
milled around outside.
On Sept. 20 the UC Board of
Regents voted that a guest lec
turer could make only one ap
pearance in a course for credits.
Sponsors of the student-initi
ated course then decided to con
duct it on a non-credit basis so
that Cleaver, a convict on parole,
could give 10 lectures. But they
pushed a fight for credit.
Governor Reagan said last
night the people "shouldn't have
to put up with" demonstrations
such as occurred at the Univer
sitv last night.
The Republican governor
called for firm deaing with those
involved in the sit-in.
"I don't think the administra
tion should negotiate with them,"

Reagan told reporters when he
arrived at the Sacramento Mu
nicipal Airport. Reagan called
the demonstration the "inevita
ble result of appeasement and
appeasement in the policy fol
lowed by the university adminis
tration for too long a time."
Assembly Speaker Jesse Un
ruh, who will be on campus to
day at noon in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium, said that if Cleaver
provoked or counseled the sit
in he should be "permanently
barred from future appearances
as a lecturer at the university."

provoked or counseled the sit

A bomb threat was received
around 9 p.m. in the student un
ion building and the building
was cleared temporarily but not
before some 200 of those out
side Sproul Hall managed to
push their way in. The students
were protesting the closing of
the student union which nor
mally closes at 12:00.
The students were told of the
threat and were evacuated. The
Union was opened again soon
after the threat was diagnosed
a hoax.

The realization of more than
a half decade of dreams will
come to fruition within a few
days in Tresidder Union as the
Stanford Community Coffee
House opens its doors to the
public.
The establishment of a coffee
house has faced obstacles of
false starts, temporary sites, and
administrative accusations in its
struggle for existence, in the
past.
But with the assistance of
Fred Saas and twenty students
who have lent their support as
well as the aid of Tresidder
Union in supplying space and
necessary finances the experi
ment was finally undertaken.
The exact location is the old
billiard room which has been
revamped with redwood panel
ing, carpets, boat hatch cover
tabletops, stage and sound
equipment, and over 150 wooden
captains chairs. The billiard tab
les have been moved to the ping
pong room.
This past spring lent substan
tial impetus to the coffee house
with a student referendum tak
ing reaction to its creation. More
than 90 per cent voted for the
creation of a permanent coffee
house.
But since, according to Saas,
there has been very little help
offered from the community.
Various departments and indi
viduals which had shown inter
est in helping have since con
tributed little support.
The official opening of the
house, which has yet to receive a
name other than the Stanford
Community Coffee house, has
been set for November 1, but
the opportunity to try things out
and put things in operating or
der encouraged operators to
open early "unofficially."
It is expected a contest of
sorts will be held shortly to give
the house a name.
The coffee house will be equip
ped with a new expresso ma
chine, and will offer a pickle
barrel and sandwiches as well.
The House claims the food

will be the "finest attainable,"
and wili offer a menu quite un
like that of the Tresidder cafe
teria.
According to Saas the menu
will be open to change or sug
gestions from any of the coffee
house patrons at any time. The
menu is expected to change
periodically in order to appeal
to the entire community.
"We will change," remarked
Saas, "according to demand.
This is Stanford's coffee house,
and it is up to the Stanford
students and faculty to make it."
The price range is expected
to be comparable with the var
ious local coffee houses.
Saas thinks that restaurants
are on the way out.
"Restaurants today are simply
a replacement for the old pub.
We have gone from what a res
taurant should be. The coffee
house is an answer to this. It
takes away the cold cafeteria at
mosphere."
"We emphasize that the coffee
house will be extremely versa
tile. It will not be dominated by
any particular group."
The coffee house has set tenta
tive hours at 11:30 a.m. to 5:00
p.m. and 7 p.m. to 2 a.m.
It is expected it will help to
relieve crowded conditions in the
Tresidder food service during
the lunch hours.
Presently the coffee house is
engaged in a search to find em
ployees to work in three hour
shifts. The work will be re
munerative.
Entertainment will be much a
part of the coffee house with
poets, folk singers, and so forth
being the offering. But Saas em
phasizes that the coffee house
is a place for communication
and for this reason entertain
ment will not be a substitute for
conversation and dialogue.
Saas says that the house may
be open for artists to exhibit as
one outlet for showing their
work.
As of yet entertainment for
opening day, that is the "official"
opening of November 1 has not

been confirmed and volunteers
are needed to perform. The
House is in need of musicians,
poets and others. Anyone inter
ested is urged to sign-up at Tre
sidder desk for auditions, which
will take place Sunday after
noon from 1:00 till 5:00 in the
Coffee House.

A sit-in on the troubled Ber
keley campus was broken up
late last night when campus po
lice moved in and arrested near
ly 120 demonstrators in Sproul
Hall.
They were protesting the de
nial of credit in the racism
course, Social Analysis 139 X, in
which Black Panther leader Eld
ridge Cleaver was a guest lec
turer.
The demonstrators, many of
whom were students in the con
troversial Cleaver course, had
defied Administration warnings
to leave the Berkeley Admini
stration building by the 7 p.m.
closing time.
More than 2,500 onlookers
were massed outside, at times
blocking traffic on Bancroft Ave
nue, which runs past the build
ing.
Rocks Thrown
There were reports of rocks
thrown at an Alameda County
sheriff's department bus and
that one small bus owned by
the university police had been
overturned twice.

University authorities said the
arrested students would be
booked by university police for
unlawful assembly and then
turned over to sheriff's depu
ties for transfer to the county
prison farm at Santa Rita.
Among the first arrests was
Dr. Edward Sampson, sociology
professor who is one of the
faculty sponsors of the course,
Social Analysis 139 x.
Do Your Thing
The sit-in began shortly after
Cleaver gave his third lecture
in Dwinelle Hall. In it Cleaver
said "If you think this is worth
while, then do your thing."
A statement distributed by stu
dents taking the course read:
"We will remain at the regist
rar's office until credit is grant
ed."
Before the building was closed
at 7 p.m. vice chancellor R. L.
Johnson told the demonstrators
they faced arrest if they did not
leave.
They stayed and voted that if
arrested they would refuse bail

until their arraignment and fast
while in jail.
Outside the hall some 300 to
400 students, sympathizers of
those inside as well as curious
spectators looked on. Police had
hoped the crowd would disperse
but at the time the arrests were
finally made at 11 p.m. a hostile
mob estimated at 2,000 students
milled around outside.
On Sept. 20 the UC Board of
Regents voted that a guest lec
turer could make only one ap
pearance in a course for credits.
Sponsors of the student-initi
ated course then decided to con
duct it on a non-credit basis so
that Cleaver, a convict on parole,
could give 10 lectures. But they
pushed a fight for credit.
Governor Reagan said last
night the people "shouldn't have
to put up with" demonstrations
such as occurred at the Univer
sitv last night.
The Republican governor
called for firm deaing with those
involved in the sit-in.
"I don't think the administra
tion should negotiate with them,"

Reagan told reporters when he
arrived at the Sacramento Mu
nicipal Airport. Reagan called
the demonstration the "inevita

night the people "shouldn't have
to put up with" demonstrations
such as occurred at the Univer
sitv last night.
The Republican governor
called for firm deaing with those
involved in the sit-in.
"I don't think the administra
tion should negotiate with them,"

Reagan told reporters when he
arrived at the Sacramento Mu
nicipal Airport. Reagan called
the demonstration the "inevita
ble result of appeasement and
appeasement in the policy fol
lowed by the university adminis
tration for too long a time."
Assembly Speaker Jesse Un
ruh, who will be on campus to
day at noon in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium, said that if Cleaver
provoked or counseled the sit
in he should be "permanently
barred from future appearances
as a lecturer at the university."
A bomb threat was received
around 9 p.m. in the student un
ion building and the building
was cleared temporarily but not
before some 200 of those out
side Sproul Hall managed to
push their way in. The students
were protesting the closing of
the student union which nor
mally closes at 12:00.
The students were told of the
threat and were evacuated. The
Union was opened again soon
after the threat was diagnosed
a hoax.

The realization of more than
a half decade of dreams will
come to fruition within a few
days in Tresidder Union as the
Stanford Community Coffee
House opens its doors to the
public.
The establishment of a coffee
house has faced obstacles of
false starts, temporary sites, and
administrative accusations in its
struggle for existence, in the
past.
But with the assistance of
Fred Saas and twenty students
who have lent their support as
well as the aid of Tresidder
Union in supplying space and
necessary finances the experi
ment was finally undertaken.
The exact location is the old
billiard room which has been
revamped with redwood panel
ing, carpets, boat hatch cover
tabletops, stage and sound
equipment, and over 150 wooden
captains chairs. The billiard tab
les have been moved to the ping
pong room.
This past spring lent substan
tial impetus to the coffee house
with a student referendum tak
ing reaction to its creation. More
than 90 per cent voted for the
creation of a permanent coffee
house.
But since, according to Saas,
there has been very little help
offered from the community.
Various departments and indi
viduals which had shown inter
est in helping have since con
tributed little support.
The official opening of the
house, which has yet to receive a
name other than the Stanford
Community Coffee house, has
been set for November 1, but
the opportunity to try things out
and put things in operating or
der encouraged operators to
open early "unofficially."
It is expected a contest of
sorts will be held shortly to give
the house a name.
The coffee house will be equip
ped with a new expresso ma
chine, and will offer a pickle
barrel and sandwiches as well.
The House claims the food

will be the "finest attainable,"
and wili offer a menu quite un
like that of the Tresidder cafe
teria.
According to Saas the menu
will be open to change or sug
gestions from any of the coffee
house patrons at any time. The
menu is expected to change
periodically in order to appeal
to the entire community.
"We will change," remarked
Saas, "according to demand.
This is Stanford's coffee house,
and it is up to the Stanford
students and faculty to make it."
The price range is expected
to be comparable with the var
ious local coffee houses.
Saas thinks that restaurants
are on the way out.
"Restaurants today are simply
a replacement for the old pub.
We have gone from what a res
taurant should be. The coffee
house is an answer to this. It
takes away the cold cafeteria at
mosphere."
"We emphasize that the coffee
house will be extremely versa
tile. It will not be dominated by
any particular group."
The coffee house has set tenta
tive hours at 11:30 a.m. to 5:00
p.m. and 7 p.m. to 2 a.m.
It is expected it will help to
relieve crowded conditions in the
Tresidder food service during
the lunch hours.
Presently the coffee house is
engaged in a search to find em
ployees to work in three hour
shifts. The work will be re
munerative.
Entertainment will be much a
part of the coffee house with
poets, folk singers, and so forth
being the offering. But Saas em
phasizes that the coffee house
is a place for communication
and for this reason entertain
ment will not be a substitute for
conversation and dialogue.
Saas says that the house may
be open for artists to exhibit as
one outlet for showing their
work.
As of yet entertainment for
opening day, that is the "official"
opening of November 1 has not

been confirmed and volunteers
are needed to perform. The
House is in need of musicians,
poets and others. Anyone inter
ested is urged to sign-up at Tre
sidder desk for auditions, which
will take place Sunday after
noon from 1:00 till 5:00 in the
Coffee House.

A sit-in on the troubled Ber
keley campus was broken up
late last night when campus po
lice moved in and arrested near
ly 120 demonstrators in Sproul
Hall.
They were protesting the de
nial of credit in the racism
course, Social Analysis 139 X, in
which Black Panther leader Eld
ridge Cleaver was a guest lec
turer.
The demonstrators, many of
whom were students in the con
troversial Cleaver course, had
defied Administration warnings
to leave the Berkeley Admini
stration building by the 7 p.m.
closing time.
More than 2,500 onlookers
were massed outside, at times
blocking traffic on Bancroft Ave
nue, which runs past the build
ing.
Rocks Thrown
There were reports of rocks
thrown at an Alameda County
sheriff's department bus and
that one small bus owned by
the university police had been
overturned twice.

University authorities said the
arrested students would be
booked by university police for
unlawful assembly and then
turned over to sheriff's depu
ties for transfer to the county
prison farm at Santa Rita.
Among the first arrests was
Dr. Edward Sampson, sociology
professor who is one of the
faculty sponsors of the course,
Social Analysis 139 x.
Do Your Thing
The sit-in began shortly after
Cleaver gave his third lecture
in Dwinelle Hall. In it Cleaver
said "If you think this is worth
while, then do your thing."
A statement distributed by stu
dents taking the course read:
"We will remain at the regist
rar's office until credit is grant
ed."
Before the building was closed
at 7 p.m. vice chancellor R. L.
Johnson told the demonstrators
they faced arrest if they did not
leave.
They stayed and voted that if
arrested they would refuse bail

until their arraignment and fast
while in jail.
Outside the hall some 300 to
400 students, sympathizers of
those inside as well as curious
spectators looked on. Police had
hoped the crowd would disperse
but at the time the arrests were
finally made at 11 p.m. a hostile
mob estimated at 2,000 students
milled around outside.
On Sept. 20 the UC Board of
Regents voted that a guest lec
turer could make only one ap
pearance in a course for credits.
Sponsors of the student-initi
ated course then decided to con
duct it on a non-credit basis so
that Cleaver, a convict on parole,
could give 10 lectures. But they
pushed a fight for credit.
