### JOHNIE SCOTT 
"If You hear any noise, it's just
me and the boys!"
A cultural Renaissance? At
Stanford? When? Who did it?
Why?
I didn't think anything hap
pened at that place (not just
linear accelerators in the night,
humming, the smell of burning
weeds above Campus Hill. Noth
ing that would ever get into the
papers, never the front page).
Thoughts, passing thru my
head, reading the (quote) re
sponses (endquote) from mem
bers of Ram's Head, associates
of said group (and the theater
sections of our newspapers). All
kinds, from the emetic wail at
Stanford, "We always intended
to do Johnie's play, we just
weren't organized!" Sincerity
oozing from their jaws, fear a
slow burn easing down a Trus
tee's backbone reading his San
Francisco Chronicle's report of
racism on the campus.
But, you people have been
lucky (so far). Nobody, outside
a reporter from the SF Exami
ner and a scribe for the San
Jose Mercury, has ever asked
me my opinions of what (is go

ing on) happened to me. Lord,
but when they do? Like, look at
what has transpired in the space
of only a few days here at Stan
ford, where we never lost our
composure before over culture,
a play, or whether it was ever
produced.
First, the white folk who
wanted to know from me why I
would "make such an issue out
of so small a thing, after all,
really, you know that Gaieties is
small-time stuff compared to
what is relevant."
When I say that I wrote Gaie
ties because no other black had
ever written one, I had "tradi
tion" and everything- else that
"the other America" holds dear
in my mind. I did not write it to
be "produced in the winter or
spring," certainly not by Ram's
Head, which has (or had, what
ever the case might or may be)"
financial problems.
Tradition is everything, to me
as well as to you. Tradition, as
a vehicle for moving up the so
cial totem pole (which, with its
delineations of power, black/the
bottom, describes where we, you
as well as I, have to live).
It is whatever these people

have been. As you, professors,
might have written and dreamed
of, could you ever dream and
not say so because you would
have been considered "corny,"
me with my name and my little
lightweight reputation (for
speaking up for myself, now
ain't that something?) aliena
ting all of these people because
I screamed "racism" when my
play wasn't done.
Yes, to an extent, an ego was
involved—my own, black. But
then, Stanford brought me here
from the ghetto, not a white one
like Russian Hill but a black
slum. Its housing projects, the
murders of black men by black
men. So long ago, enough to
traumatize the "average" child
—but I survived, came here, for
this.
Stanford, which is what I have
been given. To make of what I
can, when not busy (like every
body, this is how the rationali
zation goes) doing my lessons.
Listen, and listen good, white
folks, because you are going to
find out that an awful lot can
accumulate in the heart of a
black man given three years of
concentrated whitewashing. Tide
couldn't get you no whiter.
For this reason, there will
have to be action. Because what
is in Power, what it is that
makes Decisions, is not moved

because of Effort, but only be
cause of Influence, as Words be
gin to flow the hand goes to the
billfold (a checkbook).
Wait a minute, Whitey! I ain't
searching for no money! I ain't
nobody's Uncle Tom out looking
for gratuties or confessionals.
We all got our problems, our
separate tears, but this time the
Scandal is Yours—because you
professed to be so different, so
morally upright.
I say this—Why bring a black
to Stanford from the slums, a
true black man, burden him
down with your culture, run him
thru all the classic "identity"
problems, look at him strangely
when he doesn't get taken in by
the rhetoric of "Why Viet Nam
Is Or Is Not A Moral War, Come
to Cubbcrley Aud Tonite and
Hear the Great Debate." Hypoc
risies, the lowest form of lying
(and guilt, not at what you have
done, but what you have been
discovered at doing).
Again, GAIETIES — alumnus
here, at the Big Game (that
time of the Year to take the
wife out to the ole college for
a lookaround, see if anything
"done changed since I left"), go
to the old pre-game show, the
Gaieties, laugh a lot and the
game, leave for another empty
summer, another year of not
understanding why the world is
going to pot (pun intended).
Mr. and Mrs. White America,
so far from the campus. So
much farther from my world.
Far from the first, because
you've already been there, had

your chance. Ear from the sec
ond, because it is your child, a
bastard child, the ghetto, 30 mil
lion angry blacks, so many oth
er relevant things to talk about,
to do even.
Mr. and Mrs. White America,
I want to talk to you. About
how your children are not get
ting their "proper" education.
Which is what Ronald Reagan,
Max Rafferty, and so many,
others talk about but never of,
or into.
Your kids are culturally-de
prived. They cannot really share
my life-experience with me, and
I walk thru this campus, its fair
lawns, knowing that whatever I
say, whenever I raise my voice,
Somebody from somewhere will
downplay what I say.
I ask the following questions
of you, that you might first ask
yourselves, then your children,
then the Administration (go
thru all of the proper channels,
I, a black man, am not asking
for welfare or any of your prop
erty rights, only to be able to
share, not to scandalize).
YOU HAVE BEEN TAUGHT
WRONG! The emnations com
ing from here are . completely
false. They have taught you and
your children lies, lies about me,
my home, what it is, why we
hate. They have even held back,
would smother with obscurities,
what I mean (Black Power is a
Love Ethic, it is not flowers for
the white man, face floating
down the river.)
They have even taught you to
be afraid of words.

me and the boys!"

Mr. and Mrs. White America,
so far from the campus. So
much farther from my world.
Far from the first, because
you've already been there, had

your chance. Ear from the sec
ond, because it is your child, a
bastard child, the ghetto, 30 mil
lion angry blacks, so many oth
er relevant things to talk about,
to do even.
Mr. and Mrs. White America,
I want to talk to you. About
how your children are not get
ting their "proper" education.
Which is what Ronald Reagan,
Max Rafferty, and so many,
others talk about but never of,
or into.
Your kids are culturally-de
prived. They cannot really share
my life-experience with me, and
I walk thru this campus, its fair
lawns, knowing that whatever I
say, whenever I raise my voice,
Somebody from somewhere will
downplay what I say.
I ask the following questions
of you, that you might first ask
yourselves, then your children,
then the Administration (go
thru all of the proper channels,
I, a black man, am not asking
for welfare or any of your prop
erty rights, only to be able to
share, not to scandalize).
YOU HAVE BEEN TAUGHT
WRONG! The emnations com
ing from here are . completely
false. They have taught you and
your children lies, lies about me,
my home, what it is, why we
hate. They have even held back,
would smother with obscurities,
what I mean (Black Power is a
Love Ethic, it is not flowers for
the white man, face floating
down the river.)
They have even taught you to
be afraid of words.
"If You hear any noise, it's just
me and the boys!"
A cultural Renaissance? At
Stanford? When? Who did it?
Why?
I didn't think anything hap
pened at that place (not just
linear accelerators in the night,
humming, the smell of burning
weeds above Campus Hill. Noth
ing that would ever get into the
papers, never the front page).
Thoughts, passing thru my
head, reading the (quote) re
sponses (endquote) from mem
bers of Ram's Head, associates
of said group (and the theater
sections of our newspapers). All
kinds, from the emetic wail at
Stanford, "We always intended
to do Johnie's play, we just
weren't organized!" Sincerity
oozing from their jaws, fear a
slow burn easing down a Trus
tee's backbone reading his San
Francisco Chronicle's report of
racism on the campus.
But, you people have been
lucky (so far). Nobody, outside
a reporter from the SF Exami
ner and a scribe for the San
Jose Mercury, has ever asked
me my opinions of what (is go

ing on) happened to me. Lord,
but when they do? Like, look at
what has transpired in the space
of only a few days here at Stan
ford, where we never lost our
composure before over culture,
a play, or whether it was ever
produced.
First, the white folk who
wanted to know from me why I
would "make such an issue out
of so small a thing, after all,
really, you know that Gaieties is
small-time stuff compared to
what is relevant."
When I say that I wrote Gaie
ties because no other black had
ever written one, I had "tradi
tion" and everything- else that
"the other America" holds dear
in my mind. I did not write it to
be "produced in the winter or
spring," certainly not by Ram's
Head, which has (or had, what
ever the case might or may be)"
financial problems.
Tradition is everything, to me
as well as to you. Tradition, as
a vehicle for moving up the so
cial totem pole (which, with its
delineations of power, black/the
bottom, describes where we, you
as well as I, have to live).
It is whatever these people

have been. As you, professors,
might have written and dreamed
of, could you ever dream and
not say so because you would
have been considered "corny,"
me with my name and my little
lightweight reputation (for
speaking up for myself, now
ain't that something?) aliena
ting all of these people because
I screamed "racism" when my
play wasn't done.
Yes, to an extent, an ego was
involved—my own, black. But
then, Stanford brought me here
from the ghetto, not a white one
like Russian Hill but a black
slum. Its housing projects, the
murders of black men by black
men. So long ago, enough to
traumatize the "average" child
—but I survived, came here, for
this.
Stanford, which is what I have
been given. To make of what I
can, when not busy (like every
body, this is how the rationali
zation goes) doing my lessons.
Listen, and listen good, white
folks, because you are going to
find out that an awful lot can
accumulate in the heart of a
black man given three years of
concentrated whitewashing. Tide
couldn't get you no whiter.
For this reason, there will
have to be action. Because what
is in Power, what it is that
makes Decisions, is not moved

because of Effort, but only be
cause of Influence, as Words be
gin to flow the hand goes to the
billfold (a checkbook).
Wait a minute, Whitey! I ain't
searching for no money! I ain't
nobody's Uncle Tom out looking
for gratuties or confessionals.
We all got our problems, our
separate tears, but this time the
Scandal is Yours—because you
professed to be so different, so
morally upright.
I say this—Why bring a black
to Stanford from the slums, a
true black man, burden him
down with your culture, run him
thru all the classic "identity"
problems, look at him strangely
when he doesn't get taken in by
the rhetoric of "Why Viet Nam
Is Or Is Not A Moral War, Come
to Cubbcrley Aud Tonite and

Tradition is everything, to me
as well as to you. Tradition, as
a vehicle for moving up the so
cial totem pole (which, with its
delineations of power, black/the
bottom, describes where we, you
as well as I, have to live).
It is whatever these people

have been. As you, professors,
might have written and dreamed
of, could you ever dream and
not say so because you would
have been considered "corny,"
me with my name and my little
lightweight reputation (for
speaking up for myself, now
ain't that something?) aliena
ting all of these people because
I screamed "racism" when my
play wasn't done.
Yes, to an extent, an ego was
involved—my own, black. But
then, Stanford brought me here
from the ghetto, not a white one
like Russian Hill but a black
slum. Its housing projects, the
murders of black men by black
men. So long ago, enough to
traumatize the "average" child
—but I survived, came here, for
this.

Listen, and listen good, white
folks, because you are going to
find out that an awful lot can
accumulate in the heart of a
black man given three years of
concentrated whitewashing. Tide
couldn't get you no whiter.
For this reason, there will
have to be action. Because what
is in Power, what it is that
makes Decisions, is not moved

because of Effort, but only be
cause of Influence, as Words be

billfold (a checkbook).
Wait a minute, Whitey! I ain't
searching for no money! I ain't
nobody's Uncle Tom out looking
for gratuties or confessionals.
We all got our problems, our
separate tears, but this time the
Scandal is Yours—because you
professed to be so different, so
morally upright.
I say this—Why bring a black
to Stanford from the slums, a
true black man, burden him
down with your culture, run him
thru all the classic "identity"
problems, look at him strangely
when he doesn't get taken in by
the rhetoric of "Why Viet Nam
Is Or Is Not A Moral War, Come
to Cubbcrley Aud Tonite and
Hear the Great Debate." Hypoc
risies, the lowest form of lying
(and guilt, not at what you have
done, but what you have been
discovered at doing).

Mr. and Mrs. White America,
so far from the campus. So
much farther from my world.
Far from the first, because
you've already been there, had

your chance. Ear from the sec
ond, because it is your child, a
bastard child, the ghetto, 30 mil
lion angry blacks, so many oth
er relevant things to talk about,
to do even.
Mr. and Mrs. White America,
I want to talk to you. About
how your children are not get
ting their "proper" education.
Which is what Ronald Reagan,
Max Rafferty, and so many,
others talk about but never of,
or into.
Your kids are culturally-de
prived. They cannot really share
my life-experience with me, and
I walk thru this campus, its fair
lawns, knowing that whatever I
say, whenever I raise my voice,
Somebody from somewhere will
downplay what I say.
I ask the following questions
of you, that you might first ask
yourselves, then your children,
then the Administration (go
thru all of the proper channels,
I, a black man, am not asking
for welfare or any of your prop
erty rights, only to be able to
share, not to scandalize).
YOU HAVE BEEN TAUGHT
WRONG! The emnations com
ing from here are . completely
false. They have taught you and
your children lies, lies about me,
my home, what it is, why we
hate. They have even held back,
would smother with obscurities,
what I mean (Black Power is a
Love Ethic, it is not flowers for
the white man, face floating
down the river.)
They have even taught you to
be afraid of words.
"If You hear any noise, it's just
me and the boys!"
A cultural Renaissance? At
Stanford? When? Who did it?
Why?
I didn't think anything hap
pened at that place (not just
linear accelerators in the night,
humming, the smell of burning
weeds above Campus Hill. Noth
ing that would ever get into the
papers, never the front page).
Thoughts, passing thru my
head, reading the (quote) re
sponses (endquote) from mem
bers of Ram's Head, associates
of said group (and the theater
sections of our newspapers). All
kinds, from the emetic wail at
Stanford, "We always intended
to do Johnie's play, we just
weren't organized!" Sincerity
oozing from their jaws, fear a
slow burn easing down a Trus
tee's backbone reading his San
Francisco Chronicle's report of
racism on the campus.
But, you people have been
lucky (so far). Nobody, outside
a reporter from the SF Exami
ner and a scribe for the San
Jose Mercury, has ever asked
me my opinions of what (is go

ing on) happened to me. Lord,
but when they do? Like, look at
what has transpired in the space
of only a few days here at Stan
ford, where we never lost our
composure before over culture,
a play, or whether it was ever
produced.
First, the white folk who
wanted to know from me why I
would "make such an issue out
of so small a thing, after all,
really, you know that Gaieties is
small-time stuff compared to
what is relevant."
When I say that I wrote Gaie
ties because no other black had
ever written one, I had "tradi
tion" and everything- else that
"the other America" holds dear
in my mind. I did not write it to
be "produced in the winter or
spring," certainly not by Ram's
Head, which has (or had, what
ever the case might or may be)"
financial problems.

my home, what it is, why we
hate. They have even held back,
would smother with obscurities,
what I mean (Black Power is a
Love Ethic, it is not flowers for
the white man, face floating
down the river.)
They have even taught you to
be afraid of words.
"If You hear any noise, it's just
me and the boys!"
A cultural Renaissance? At
Stanford? When? Who did it?
Why?
I didn't think anything hap
pened at that place (not just
linear accelerators in the night,
humming, the smell of burning
weeds above Campus Hill. Noth
ing that would ever get into the
papers, never the front page).
Thoughts, passing thru my
head, reading the (quote) re
sponses (endquote) from mem
bers of Ram's Head, associates
of said group (and the theater
sections of our newspapers). All
kinds, from the emetic wail at
Stanford, "We always intended
to do Johnie's play, we just
weren't organized!" Sincerity
oozing from their jaws, fear a
slow burn easing down a Trus
tee's backbone reading his San
Francisco Chronicle's report of
racism on the campus.
But, you people have been
lucky (so far). Nobody, outside
a reporter from the SF Exami
ner and a scribe for the San
Jose Mercury, has ever asked
me my opinions of what (is go

ing on) happened to me. Lord,
but when they do? Like, look at
what has transpired in the space
of only a few days here at Stan
ford, where we never lost our
composure before over culture,
a play, or whether it was ever
produced.
First, the white folk who
wanted to know from me why I
would "make such an issue out
of so small a thing, after all,
really, you know that Gaieties is
small-time stuff compared to
what is relevant."
When I say that I wrote Gaie
ties because no other black had
ever written one, I had "tradi
tion" and everything- else that
"the other America" holds dear
in my mind. I did not write it to
be "produced in the winter or
spring," certainly not by Ram's
Head, which has (or had, what
ever the case might or may be)"
financial problems.
Tradition is everything, to me
as well as to you. Tradition, as
a vehicle for moving up the so
cial totem pole (which, with its
delineations of power, black/the
bottom, describes where we, you
as well as I, have to live).
It is whatever these people

have been. As you, professors,
might have written and dreamed
of, could you ever dream and
not say so because you would
have been considered "corny,"
me with my name and my little
lightweight reputation (for
speaking up for myself, now
ain't that something?) aliena
ting all of these people because
I screamed "racism" when my
play wasn't done.
Yes, to an extent, an ego was
involved—my own, black. But
then, Stanford brought me here
from the ghetto, not a white one
like Russian Hill but a black
slum. Its housing projects, the
murders of black men by black
men. So long ago, enough to
traumatize the "average" child
—but I survived, came here, for
this.
Stanford, which is what I have
been given. To make of what I
can, when not busy (like every
body, this is how the rationali
zation goes) doing my lessons.
Listen, and listen good, white
folks, because you are going to
find out that an awful lot can
accumulate in the heart of a
black man given three years of
concentrated whitewashing. Tide
couldn't get you no whiter.
For this reason, there will
have to be action. Because what
is in Power, what it is that
makes Decisions, is not moved

because of Effort, but only be
cause of Influence, as Words be
gin to flow the hand goes to the
billfold (a checkbook).
Wait a minute, Whitey! I ain't
searching for no money! I ain't
nobody's Uncle Tom out looking
for gratuties or confessionals.
We all got our problems, our
separate tears, but this time the
Scandal is Yours—because you
professed to be so different, so
morally upright.
I say this—Why bring a black
to Stanford from the slums, a
true black man, burden him
down with your culture, run him
thru all the classic "identity"
problems, look at him strangely
when he doesn't get taken in by
the rhetoric of "Why Viet Nam
Is Or Is Not A Moral War, Come
to Cubbcrley Aud Tonite and
Hear the Great Debate." Hypoc
risies, the lowest form of lying
(and guilt, not at what you have
done, but what you have been
discovered at doing).
Again, GAIETIES — alumnus
here, at the Big Game (that
time of the Year to take the
wife out to the ole college for
a lookaround, see if anything
"done changed since I left"), go
to the old pre-game show, the
Gaieties, laugh a lot and the
game, leave for another empty
summer, another year of not
understanding why the world is
going to pot (pun intended).
Mr. and Mrs. White America,
so far from the campus. So
much farther from my world.
Far from the first, because
you've already been there, had

your chance. Ear from the sec
ond, because it is your child, a
bastard child, the ghetto, 30 mil
lion angry blacks, so many oth
er relevant things to talk about,
to do even.
Mr. and Mrs. White America,
I want to talk to you. About
how your children are not get
ting their "proper" education.
Which is what Ronald Reagan,
Max Rafferty, and so many,
others talk about but never of,
or into.
Your kids are culturally-de
prived. They cannot really share
my life-experience with me, and
I walk thru this campus, its fair
lawns, knowing that whatever I
say, whenever I raise my voice,
Somebody from somewhere will
downplay what I say.
I ask the following questions
of you, that you might first ask
yourselves, then your children,
then the Administration (go
thru all of the proper channels,
I, a black man, am not asking
for welfare or any of your prop
erty rights, only to be able to
share, not to scandalize).
YOU HAVE BEEN TAUGHT
WRONG! The emnations com
ing from here are . completely
false. They have taught you and
your children lies, lies about me,
my home, what it is, why we
hate. They have even held back,
would smother with obscurities,
what I mean (Black Power is a
Love Ethic, it is not flowers for
the white man, face floating
down the river.)
They have even taught you to
be afraid of words.
