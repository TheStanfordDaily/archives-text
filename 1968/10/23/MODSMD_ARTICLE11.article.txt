## Support For AFT

Editor, The DAILY:
We, Teaching Assistants in the
Department of English, support
the demands made by Teaching
Assistants of the Political Sci
ence Department.
We concur in the following de
mands: (1) Each political sci
ence teaching assistant be paid
$3,000 per year; (2) This incre
ment in income not be accompa

nied by an increase in teaching
loads or reduction of existing
benefits; (3) This increase be ef
fective Winter Term, 1969.
We believe that these conces
sions should be made by the
University to all who assist in
teaching in any Stanford Uni
versity Department.
