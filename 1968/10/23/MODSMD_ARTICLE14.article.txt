# Rep. McCloskey
## More Birth Control Urged 
### LANG ATWOOD 
Congressman Paul N. Mc-
Closkey (R-Calif.) suggested
mandatory birth control in all
countries receiving U.S. foreign
aid and for all recipients of do
mestic urban assistance while
speaking at the Stanford Popu
lation and Environment Forum
Monday evening.
McCloskey said that our popu
lation is doubling every 35 years
and if this growth rate continues
our ability to enjoy the out-of
doors will be denied to our grand
children.
He cited the example of India,
where public officials stand in
train stations and encourage
males to be sterilized. They are
paid $1.35 for each person who
submits. McCloskey pointed out

that this type of approach would
not be accepted in the U.S.
McCloskey outlined three
areas of possible government
action. The first was control.
"I do not think the government
can or should enter into the
question of whether or not a
man can have sexual inter
course," he stated.
He indicated, however, that
this may change in the future.
"The greatest threat to conser
vation will come in the 1970'5.
There will be 20 million women
of child-bearing age and if each
one has three or four children
there will be no possibility of
supporting them."
"Education is the first step in
controlling our population," stat-

Ed McCloskey. He stated that an
intensive program through the
schools, health centers and tele
vision will be necessary if vol
untary use of birth control de
vices is to succeed. He pointed
out, however, that some people
in South San Mateo County to
day don't want their children
receiving sex education and
blacks in East Palo Alto reject
family planning as "genocide."
He stressed that if we don't
lay the groundwork now, "we
are opening the way for the
toppling of our civilization."
"We must create a new en
vironment whereby people ac
cept a limit on the number of
children they can have," Mc-
Closkey stated.
He suggested that paying each
girl of child-bearing age $500
a year for each year she had no
children after her second child
might be one answer. "Liberal
izing abortion laws has reduced
the birth rate in Japan and
might help here," he added.
The problem of church doc
trines conflicting with laws is a
problem that will have to be

worked out but "I don't know
the answer," said McCloskey.
Regarding foreign aid restric
tions, Paul Erlich, the author of
"The Population Bomb" said
that any foreign aid sent over
seas is wasted without restric
tions.
A young woman in the audi
ence asked about U.S. goals and
priorities in a question regard
ing strings on foreign aid.
McCloskey answered that his
priorities were: 1) national se
curity, 2) control of atomic en
ergy, 3) equal opportunity for
all races in the U.S. and 4)
preservation of our environment.
In response to a question con
cerning the destruction of our
natural resources by man, Mc-
Closkey proposed to tax all man
ufacturers who use non-dispos
able containers one cent per con
tainer. There would be a %
cent bounty for each one return
ed to disposal points.
"There is nothing more en
raging than to be fishing in the
Sierra and find a beer can star
ing at you," he concluded.

Monday evening.
McCloskey said that our popu
lation is doubling every 35 years
and if this growth rate continues
our ability to enjoy the out-of
doors will be denied to our grand
children.
He cited the example of India,
where public officials stand in
train stations and encourage
males to be sterilized. They are
paid $1.35 for each person who
submits. McCloskey pointed out

that this type of approach would
not be accepted in the U.S.
McCloskey outlined three
areas of possible government
action. The first was control.
"I do not think the government
can or should enter into the
question of whether or not a
man can have sexual inter
course," he stated.
He indicated, however, that
this may change in the future.
"The greatest threat to conser
vation will come in the 1970'5.
There will be 20 million women
of child-bearing age and if each
one has three or four children
there will be no possibility of
supporting them."
"Education is the first step in
controlling our population," stat-

Ed McCloskey. He stated that an
intensive program through the
schools, health centers and tele
vision will be necessary if vol
untary use of birth control de
vices is to succeed. He pointed
out, however, that some people
in South San Mateo County to
day don't want their children
receiving sex education and
blacks in East Palo Alto reject
family planning as "genocide."
He stressed that if we don't
lay the groundwork now, "we
are opening the way for the
toppling of our civilization."
"We must create a new en
vironment whereby people ac
cept a limit on the number of
children they can have," Mc-
Closkey stated.
He suggested that paying each
girl of child-bearing age $500
a year for each year she had no
children after her second child
might be one answer. "Liberal
izing abortion laws has reduced
the birth rate in Japan and
might help here," he added.
The problem of church doc
trines conflicting with laws is a
problem that will have to be

worked out but "I don't know
the answer," said McCloskey.
Regarding foreign aid restric
tions, Paul Erlich, the author of
"The Population Bomb" said
that any foreign aid sent over
seas is wasted without restric
tions.
A young woman in the audi
ence asked about U.S. goals and
priorities in a question regard
ing strings on foreign aid.
McCloskey answered that his
priorities were: 1) national se
curity, 2) control of atomic en
ergy, 3) equal opportunity for
all races in the U.S. and 4)
preservation of our environment.
In response to a question con
cerning the destruction of our
natural resources by man, Mc-
Closkey proposed to tax all man
ufacturers who use non-dispos
able containers one cent per con
tainer. There would be a %
cent bounty for each one return
ed to disposal points.
"There is nothing more en
raging than to be fishing in the
Sierra and find a beer can star
ing at you," he concluded.
Congressman Paul N. Mc-
Closkey (R-Calif.) suggested
mandatory birth control in all
countries receiving U.S. foreign
aid and for all recipients of do
mestic urban assistance while
speaking at the Stanford Popu
lation and Environment Forum
Monday evening.
