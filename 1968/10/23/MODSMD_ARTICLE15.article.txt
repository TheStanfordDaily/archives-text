# 'If God Is Dead Man Also Is'
## 
### ALLAN SMITH 
"If we say that God is dead,
then we must finally come to
the conclusion that man is dead
also." These were the words of
philosopher Francis Schaeffer in
a talk in the Toyon lounge Mon
day night. Schaeffer, who is from
L'Abri, Switzerland, is visting
Stanford this week.
"This is precisely what many
contemporary artists, authors
and philosophers are saying:
man is dead, man is meaning
less, man is absurd, because he
has discovered that he isnot ful
fillable by what is," Schaeffer
continued.
Schaeffer holds that in the
mechanistic, deterministic world
created by science, love is not
valid, and man's testimony con
cerning himself in art is not
valid. So it appears that we must
give up either the scientific view
point, our best rational result,
or the significance of man, love,
and beauty, according to the
philosopher.
Of course we are not willing
to do either, says Schaeffer, but
we are already beginning to hear
screams of anguish and despair
from those who have faced the
choice we have to make. We hear
them in the works of artists such
as Giocometti and Francis Ba
con, in the plays of lonesco, in
the films of Bergman and An
tonioni, in the philosophical
works of Sartre, he said.
Dilemma Of Modern Man
In his lecture Monday, Dr.
Schaeffer traced the development
of the dilemma of modern man

starting with the rise of modern
science in the Renaissance. Sci
ence would have been impossible,
he pointed out, without the
Christian presupposition that
the world is an orderly, harmon
ious system created by an intel
ligent God.
This idea was still strong at
the time science began, but it
has since disappeared. Now,
Schaeffer said, man is finding
that he himself doesn't fit into
the world he has discovered.
Philosophers have tried to re
solve the difficulty by introduc
ing a basic dictotomy between
the realm of determinism in the
"machine" of nature and the
realm of freedom in which man
finds the meaning of his life.
None Satisfactory
But none of the views of this
type proved satisfactory, and
now most philosophers have lost
the hope of achieving a unified
field of knowledge which will
encompass both our rationality
and our desire for significance,
freedom, love. The result, accord
ing to Schaeffer, is that "Mod
ern man is a mystic." This was
the title of his lecture Tuesday
night.
Tonight Dr. Schaeffer will pre
sent an alternative resolution to
the problem in a lecture entitled
"The God who is there," at 7:30
p.m. in the Toyon lounge. Fri
day Dr. Schaeffer will be speak
ing at 7:30 p.m. in the Tresidder
large lounge on "The basic phil
osophic issues and the Christian
answers."

Tonight Dr. Schaeffer will pre
sent an alternative resolution to
the problem in a lecture entitled
"The God who is there," at 7:30
p.m. in the Toyon lounge. Fri
day Dr. Schaeffer will be speak
ing at 7:30 p.m. in the Tresidder
large lounge on "The basic phil
osophic issues and the Christian
answers."
"If we say that God is dead,
then we must finally come to
the conclusion that man is dead
also." These were the words of
philosopher Francis Schaeffer in
a talk in the Toyon lounge Mon
day night. Schaeffer, who is from
L'Abri, Switzerland, is visting
Stanford this week.
"This is precisely what many
contemporary artists, authors
and philosophers are saying:
man is dead, man is meaning
less, man is absurd, because he
has discovered that he isnot ful
fillable by what is," Schaeffer
continued.
Schaeffer holds that in the
mechanistic, deterministic world
created by science, love is not
valid, and man's testimony con
cerning himself in art is not
valid. So it appears that we must
give up either the scientific view
point, our best rational result,
or the significance of man, love,
and beauty, according to the
philosopher.
Of course we are not willing
to do either, says Schaeffer, but
we are already beginning to hear
screams of anguish and despair
from those who have faced the
choice we have to make. We hear
them in the works of artists such
as Giocometti and Francis Ba
con, in the plays of lonesco, in
the films of Bergman and An
tonioni, in the philosophical
works of Sartre, he said.
Dilemma Of Modern Man
In his lecture Monday, Dr.
Schaeffer traced the development
of the dilemma of modern man

starting with the rise of modern
science in the Renaissance. Sci
ence would have been impossible,
he pointed out, without the
Christian presupposition that
the world is an orderly, harmon
ious system created by an intel
ligent God.
This idea was still strong at
the time science began, but it
has since disappeared. Now,
Schaeffer said, man is finding
that he himself doesn't fit into
the world he has discovered.
Philosophers have tried to re
solve the difficulty by introduc
ing a basic dictotomy between
the realm of determinism in the
"machine" of nature and the
realm of freedom in which man
finds the meaning of his life.
None Satisfactory
But none of the views of this
type proved satisfactory, and
now most philosophers have lost
the hope of achieving a unified
field of knowledge which will
encompass both our rationality
and our desire for significance,
freedom, love. The result, accord
ing to Schaeffer, is that "Mod
ern man is a mystic." This was
the title of his lecture Tuesday
night.
