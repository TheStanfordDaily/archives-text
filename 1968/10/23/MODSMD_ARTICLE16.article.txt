# The 						Inside Track
## A 						Matter Of Pride 
### Gary Cavalli 
Contrary to what you may have heard, the world didn't come to
an end for the Stanford football team Saturday afternoon in Spo
kane.
Despite a somewhat embarrassing tie with Washington State and
two crippling injuries, the Indians still feel they are in the race for
the Pacific-8 crown, and expect to bounce back this weekend in Los
Angeles against UCLA.
"We're not out of it yet," Coach John Ralston said yesterday.
"Now Cal, OSU and USC have to come up with a couple of losses.
Perhaps we'll be in a position to help them."
The team evidently feels the same way. Sunday morning, less
than 12 hours after stepping off the plane from Palouse country,
the Indians held an unscheduled workout, hoping to get back in
the winning groove before Saturday's encounter with UCLA in
Los Angeles.
"The morale has been surprisingly good," Ralston asserted. "The
team has a lot of pride, and they're anxious to atone for last week's
performance."
A letdown from the previous Saturday's heart-breaking loss to
USC may have had a hand in Stanford's disappointing tie with
WSU last weekend, but it was probably the team's weakest effort
of the year.
Turnovers Costly
In analyzing the game, Ralston placed the blame on two factors.
"We didn't make any big plays defensively, and we beat ourselves
offensively," Ralston commented. "I think we were a little flat, while
they took advantage of every break. The turnovers (four intercep
tions, one fumble) hurt us the most."
With 6:18 left in the game and Stanford trailing 21-20, Ralston
decided to go for a one-point conversion instead of two. Yesterday
the coach was asked if he would make the same move if he had
it to do over again.
"I think we made the right move," Ralston asserted. "It's sort
of an unwritten rule among coaches that you'll kick the extra
point if there are over six minutes left in the game," the Tribe men
tor elaborated. "We figured we'd handle the ball twice more. Our
defense was shutting them off pretty well, and we were confident
that we could move against them. Horowitz had missed his first
try, so we figured he'd make the second. On the other hand, we'd
made an earlier try at the two-pointer, so the odds were against
doing it again."
Compounding Stanford's Spokane miseries, starting ends Jack
Lasater and Bob Moore were both injured early in the WSU con
test. Lasater, victim of a severe shoulder separation, will be lost
for at least three weeks and possibly the season. Ralston indicated
that Moore, who suffered a pulled hamstring muscle is "doubtful for
Saturday, but his injury is not as bad as was originally thought."
Ralston feels he has able replacements for the two injured sopho
more receivers. Ron Kadziel, another sophomore who caught two
passes and a two-point conversion after taking over for Moore
in Washington, can do the job at tight end. "Ron is very capable,
and we feel h's ready for it," Ralston said Sunday.
The coach named Bruce Cass, Demea Washington, Mark Mar
quess and Jack Schultz as possible replacements for Lasater at
split end, but indicated that the man who will probably get the
call Saturday is Jim Cross — who had first claim to the job back
in spring practice last May.
Cross, Shoemaker Return
Cross, a senior who was seriously injured in an automobile acci
dent in mid-July, has made remarkable progress and may be ready
to go full-tilt in Los Angeles. Right now, Ralston lists Cross as
"hopeful, but we're not positive about him yet."
Cross is not the only Indian who has made a remarkable recov
ery. Senior placekicker Bill Shoemaker, who was declared out for
the year after tearing ligaments in his left knee during the season
opener with San Jose State, had his cast removed Monday and
may be ready to go Saturday.
"He's made great progress — it just goes to show you what clean
living can do for you," Ralston smiled.
When queried about using Shoemaker Saturday, Ralston was
indecisive. "It depends on how quickly he'll get enough strength
and flection in the knee. He definitely won't kick off. Somebody
could cut him down with a block and it would be all over. We'll
just have to see how he comesalong."
Just then a voice from the next room wafted over the partition.
"Don't sweat it, coach." The voice belonged to Bill Shoemaker.
