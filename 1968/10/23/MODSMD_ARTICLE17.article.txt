# National Champs Get Scare
## UCLA Edges Poloists, 7-5 
### FRED MANN 
Stanford fans were over
whelmingly outnumbered and
the Stanford water polo team
just barely outplayed Friday, as
the visiting NCAA Champions
from UCLA beat the Tribe, 7-5.
The Bruin rooters, in the Bay
Area for the All-Cal football
weekend, made their presence
known by leading cheers at the
beginning of every quarter.
They more than neutralized any
Stanford "home-pool advantage"
in a game that the Indians need
ed all the advantages they could
get
The difference in the water
was just as obvious as that in
the stands—UCLA goalie Jim
Slatten. Slatten was everywhere
for the Bruins, making 16 saves
during the course of the after
noon, many of them seemingly
impossible. Stanford net man
Banks Beasley saved nine.
Aside from a miserable second
quarter, the Cards proved that
they are very much in the Pa
cific Eight race this year. They
controlled the tempo of the
game and came up with 13 steals
against the slick national
champs.
During the first period Stan
ford showed a very tight de
fense and played ball control to
attempt to thwart the Bruin
scoring power.
Although unable to score
against Slatten, the Tribe kept
him busy, forcing him to block
seven shot attempts in the first
stanza alone. Jeff Andal of the
visitors managed to sneak one
past Beasley near the end of
the first period..
Second Quarter Collapse
UCLA opened the second quar
ter with a quick score from ten
feet out and continued their at
tack until the Tribe managed

to gain a short-lived offensive
half way through the period.
Dick Roth banged in the first
Stanford tally from short range
and was followed by a successful
penalty shot by Tom Hill.
The tie was quickly broken as
UCLA's Jim Ferguson con
nected on a penalty shot at the
other end of the pool with two
minutes left in the half. 40 sec
onds later, he had scored again.
Bob Anderson then scored for
the Bruins with only 35 seconds
remaining to send UCLA into
a halftime lead of 5-2.
The Indians were out for blood
in the third quarter. After only
eleven seconds of play, Jeff
Hammett fired in a half-court
goal to give new life to the
Tribe. Unfortunately for Stan
ford, UCLA also came out for
the second half with new spirit
and used some precision passing
to set up a score mid-way
through the period.
Roth narrowly missed two
over the head shots from in the
hole as Stanford pushed UCLA
into their defensive territory.
Bruin goalie Slatten then made
an unbelievable save against a
one man fast break by Roth.
Card passing again began to
lapse, but Tom Hill managed
to hit a three footer before the
end of the quarter.
The final eight minutes was an
even defensive battle with both
sides stealing numerous passes.
With only two minutes left in
the game, Tom Hill fouled out
for Stanford and committed the
tenth team foul. Again it was
Ferguson knocking in the pen
alty shot to give the Bruins a
commanding three goal lead.
Rob Jenson hit on an Indian
penalty shot with 40 seconds re
maining, but UCLA easily held
on for the victory.


WET AND WILD — There was plenty of action Friday at Encina
Pool, but UCLA got the better piece of it, 7-5.
