## Safeway Grapes Threaten Health, Law Students Claim 
### BRIAN McCAFFREY 
Three Stanford law students,
"on behalf of 20 million Califor
nians," are charging that con
sumption of California table
grapes sold in Safeway stores
may result in, "typhoid, paraty
phoid, amoebic dysentary, tu
berculosis, salmonella and gi
radia lablea." They assess the
value of the risk that Califor
nians are exposed to as more
than $10,000 each.
The law students are: Alan
Rader, Ronald F. Romines, and
Martin Eichner.
This charge is based on the
allegation that some of the
grapes are picked in vineyards
without toilet and hand-washing
facilities. This would constitute
a violation of the California
Health and Safety Code.
Presence of Urine
The suit, filed in the Federal
District Court of Northern Cali
fornia asserts that "the presence
of human urine and defecatory
matter on the fresh California
grapes being sold by . . . Safe
way . . ." is "inevitable".
Further charges by the law
students raise some broader
questions. They allege that some
of the grapes sold in Safeway
stores are picked by, "illegal im
migrants" to the United States
from Mexico.
Legal immigrants from Mexi

co are required to have a health
examination to insure that they
have no contagious diseases and
a small pox vaccination. The
plaintiffs charged that the il
legal immigrants received nei
ther the health examination nor
the vaccination. This would
mean that some of the grapes
are potential carriers of small
pox and any other such disease
that the immigrant might have.
Risk of Epidemic
The law students charged that
they, "are continually exposed
to the risk and threat of living
in a city beset and disrupted,
economically and physically by
an epidemic started by a .pur
chaser of grapes from defendant
Safeway Stores Inc."
Other risks listed due to the
possibility of such an epidemic
are, "mental anguish and suf
fering" and possibly having to
move "from Santa Clara County
or the State of California."
According to the suit the sale
of such grapes as consumable
constitutes a deception and is
enjoinable under California Ci
vil Code. The alleged risks and
dangers presented are not com
pensible at law.
The suit requests a permanent
injunction to prevent Safeway
from selling grapes that are
picked in vineyards without
proper toilet and hand-washing

facilities, or, that are picked by
illegal immigrants. The law stu
dents also request the cost of the
suit and "such other >elief as is
fair and just."
