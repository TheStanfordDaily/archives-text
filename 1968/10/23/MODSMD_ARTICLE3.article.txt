# Ira Hall: New Head
## Of Urban Coalition 
### GREG WHITE 
"The whole peninsula area is
a somewhat artificial environ
ment," according to Ira Hall,
newly named acting executive
director of the Stanford-Mid
peninsula Urban Coalition.
In an interview with The
Daily, Hall explained that this
environment makes it hard for
urban problems to be faced up
to. "People don't actually see a
problem and run away from it;
it is possible to just not see it,"
he said.
Hall, a blacK, is enthusiastic
about his job, and is "really
concerned about the long range
effects of programs in this ur
ban area," especially since he is
both a resident of East Palo Alto

and a former Stanford student
(Senior Class President in 1965-
66). He hopes the Urban Coali
tion will be an effective means
of communication between sep
arated communities — the afflu
ent and the poor.
"It is easy to live in Portola
Valley, work in Palo Alto, free
way to the City, and take Em
barcadero to the Yacht harbor
without ever seeing the more
disadvantaged areas such as
East Palo Alto, East Menlo
Park, or the similar Mexican-
American and white communi
ties between San Jose and San
Francisco."
Hall hopes that the Urban
Coalition can tell the people
with the "inclination and po
tency to help" what conditions
are really like in these disaf
fected areas. In fact, the Coali
tion came about partly because
such people—leaders in industry,
government, and community—
have indeed come to realize how
serious conditions are.
These leaders have now be
come part of the coalition. They
are at last together in a group
that can get something done—

or, as Hall says, "with these peo
ple involved in task forces, they
don't have to be persuaded what
to do.
The coalition itself is a diverse
group. It's large steering com
mittee is made up of business
leaders—from Hewlett Packard,
Lockheed, etc.; mayors and rep
resentatives mid-peninsula area
cities (San Mateo, Sunnyvale,
East Palo Alto . . .); and mem
bers from the community at
large who have been vocal and
active in community problems.
Also involved are Stanford pro
fessors, the Black Student Un
ion, and ASSU President Dennis
Hayes.
Hall comments that it would
be "ideal if communities could
elect representatives to the coal
ition" but at present this can't
be done.
"Action-Oriented" Forces
The coalition also has a num
ber of "action-oriented" task
forces, as opposed to study
groups. Where possible they
work with existing organizations
in setting up and implementing
programs. Hall says the coali
tion wants to work with these

organizations without them "re
linquishing their control or iden
tity."
Hall points out "there are hun
dreds of people already working
in every concern to the urban
coalition, but the coalition is
beautiful. It brings together
people who collectively have the
power to make things change."
Don't Know Who Can Help
The trouble has been that
there has been so much duplica
tion of effort and yet "many
people who are unemployed or
trying to set up a business still
don't know who can help them."
This is where the Urban coali
tion hopes to come in—as a co
ordinating agency that is still
action oriented.
The coalition is the only one
of its type that is organized on
a university campus. This con
venience, it is hoped, will lead to
an exchange of ideas with and
participation by the Stanford
community. Hall is "open to
ideas" and welcomes "people to
drop by with constructive criti
cism at his office in 592K of the
Old Union.
