# TA Salary Discussions Open Today
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Discussions open today be
tween administrators and teach
ing assistants (TA's) demanding
salary increases.
Political science graduate stu
dents and a representative of
graduate student union will
meet with University officials to
discuss political science TA de

mands issued last week that call
for immediate salary increases
of $700 per year, an allowance
of $300 per dependent, and no
increase in teaching load for the
department's TA's.
Today's first meeting will be
held at 2 p.m. in the Humanities
and Sciences conference room.
The Administration will be rep
resented by Vice Provost E.
Howard Brooks, Graduate Dean
Virgil Whitaker, and Assistant
Provost Ray Bacchetti.
At a meeting last night of the
graduate union, Local 1816 of
the American Federation of
Teachers (AFT), union mem
bers "unanimously and vigor
ously" endorsed the political sci
ence students' demands, accord
ing to union President Andrew
Moss.
Demands At Stake
Political science TA "steward"
Richard Young sought yester
day to clarify his group's nego
tiating position. "We have no ob
jection to background discus
sions to our specific demands,
but Mr. Brooks is certainly
aware that we're addressing

ourselves to specific demands.
Young was referring to a let
ter sent last Friday from
Brooks to the political science
TA's asking that TA-Adminis
tration not be limited to a salary
debate, but also "deal with a
wider range of issues relevant
to the teaching responsibilities
of advanced graduate students."
In the letter, Brooks listed
four broad-scoped questions that
deal with the role of teaching in
graduate education and with al
ternative forms of financing.
Brooks expressed the hope that
"an initial discussion will lead

to actions which can encompass
questions of salary as well as
questions of University finan
cing and the nature of career
preparation."
Young is more interested in
"negotiations rather than a long
term study." He asked for a
swift response to the specific de
mands. "A study group like SES
would be more suited to deal
with broader studies," he said.
For that reason, Young re
quested yesterday in a letter to
Brooks a "formal response" as
the result of discussions no later
than Nov. 30.

The political science students
have received support from an
thropology and English TA's
and the Stanford Students for a
Democratic Society, as well as
the graduate union. Young ex
pects further undergraduate and
graduate student endorsements,
in addition to support from sev
eral faculty groups.

tiating position. "We have no ob
jection to background discus
sions to our specific demands,
but Mr. Brooks is certainly
aware that we're addressing

ourselves to specific demands.
Young was referring to a let
ter sent last Friday from
Brooks to the political science
TA's asking that TA-Adminis
tration not be limited to a salary
debate, but also "deal with a
wider range of issues relevant
to the teaching responsibilities
of advanced graduate students."
In the letter, Brooks listed
four broad-scoped questions that
deal with the role of teaching in
graduate education and with al
ternative forms of financing.
Brooks expressed the hope that
"an initial discussion will lead

to actions which can encompass
questions of salary as well as
questions of University finan
cing and the nature of career
preparation."
Young is more interested in
"negotiations rather than a long
term study." He asked for a
swift response to the specific de
mands. "A study group like SES
would be more suited to deal
with broader studies," he said.
For that reason, Young re
quested yesterday in a letter to
Brooks a "formal response" as
the result of discussions no later
than Nov. 30.

The political science students
have received support from an
thropology and English TA's
and the Stanford Students for a
Democratic Society, as well as
the graduate union. Young ex
pects further undergraduate and
graduate student endorsements,
in addition to support from sev
eral faculty groups.
Representatives from the AFT
local, English and anthropology
graduate departments and The
Daily will be present at today's
meeting with University offi
cials.
Discussions open today be
tween administrators and teach
ing assistants (TA's) demanding
salary increases.
Political science graduate stu
dents and a representative of
graduate student union will
meet with University officials to
discuss political science TA de

mands issued last week that call
for immediate salary increases
of $700 per year, an allowance
of $300 per dependent, and no
increase in teaching load for the
department's TA's.
Today's first meeting will be
held at 2 p.m. in the Humanities
and Sciences conference room.
The Administration will be rep
resented by Vice Provost E.
Howard Brooks, Graduate Dean
Virgil Whitaker, and Assistant
Provost Ray Bacchetti.
At a meeting last night of the
graduate union, Local 1816 of
the American Federation of
Teachers (AFT), union mem
bers "unanimously and vigor
ously" endorsed the political sci
ence students' demands, accord
ing to union President Andrew
Moss.
Demands At Stake
