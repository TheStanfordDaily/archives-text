# Work With Professionals
## Students Participate In SRT 
### BETTY NISHIOKA 
A graduate student's thesis
project can become the source
of public enjoyment and cultural
experience. It's done through
the work of the Stanford Reper
tory Theater (SRT), the produc
ing bianch of tne Speech and
Drama Department.
The SRT, which began four
years ago as an independent
professional resident theater, is
now an integral part of the Uni
versity's School of Humanities
and Sciences. The bulk of the
Theater's active members con
sist of students working for
their Master of Fine Arts
(M.F.A.) degree in the fields

of directing, acting, and design
and technical theater.
The professional staff is com
posed of actors and directors in
residence who also serve as fac
ulty members of the Speech and
Drama Department.
Undergraduate students in the
department, volunteers from the
community, and acting fellows
constitute the remainder of the
approximately one hundred
members of SRT. Acting fellows
are outstanding graduates of
the M.F.A. acting program who
have received post-graduate
scholarships to continue their
work in drama.
This year the Theater will pro

duce four major plays, "Andro
mache" by Jean Racine, "the
Queen and the Rebels" by Ugo
Betti, "Blood Wedding" by Fred
erico Garcia Lorca, and"The
Jew of Malta" by Christopher
Marlowe.
While the first three plays
will largely be the work of
M.F.A. students, "The Jew of
Malta" will be an undergraduate
production.
In addition, undergraduate stu
dents will produce "The Birth
day Party" by Harold Pinter
this quarter and "Cuchulain" by
W. B. Yeats during winter quar
ter. These plays provide an op
portunity for all interested

members of the University com
munity to participate.
A variety of factors are con
sidered in deciding which specif
ic plays will be produced by the
Theater. In most cases, the di
rector suggests a number of pos
sibilities on which SRT members
speculate in view of the cultural
academic contributions of the
plays to the University and the
availability of appropriate actors
and producing materials.
For example, this season's
first production, "Andromache,"
was chosen for its unusual qual
ities. Racine's plays are rarely
produced, and the verse and act-
ing style of a 17th Century
French play set in ancient
Greece create a unique challenge
for the actors appearing before
a contemporary audience.
"Andromache" will be directed
by Michael Barry, head of the
8.8.C. drama department for ten
years. The leading role will be
played by Maidie Norman whose
film and television credits in
clude "Whatever Happened to
Baby Jane" and"The Man From
U.N.C.L.E.".
Workshop
The public will be able to take
part in discussion groups with
Mr. Barry and Miss Norman in
a drama workshop on Nov. 2 at
9 a.m. All those who buy a ticket
for the matinee performance
that afternoon will be admitted
to the workshop, which will in
clude demonstrations of how the
play is produced.
Although university-sponsored

resident theaters are becoming
more common, Stanford is one
of the first schools to assume
support of an independent thea
ter company. SRT, when it was
still separate from the Univers
ity, was reduced in size two
years ago because of financial
difficulties.
The need for more stage pro
duction opportunities for M.F.A.
students, combined with the fi
nancial problems of the com
pany, led to the incorporation of
SRT into the University curricu
lum. This is the first time that
SRT cannot be distinguished as
a separate unit from the Speech
and Drama Department.
As a division under the School
of Humanities and Sciences,
SRT receives much of its fi
nancial support from the Uni
versity. Admission, however, is
charged for all of its perform
ances, and ticket sales provide
for part of its costs.
