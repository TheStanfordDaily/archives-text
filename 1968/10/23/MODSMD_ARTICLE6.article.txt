Students will have an oppor
tunity to hear both Democratic
and Republican speakers on
campus today. Democrat Jesse
Unruh, Speaker of the Califor
nia State Assembly, will speak
at noon in Dinkelspiel Auditori

Charles S. Gubser, 10th Congres
sional District, will talk at 4:30
this afternoon at Tressider,
room 270.
In addition, students will be
able to make individual three

minute tape recordings on any
aspect of the campaign at noon
on White Plaza. Every tape will
be sent to Richard M. Nixon
and questions posed will be an
swered in writing as soon as
possible, according to Eddie An
derson, head of the Stanford
Youth for Nixon.
Jesse Unruh, chairman of the
California delegation to the
Democratic National Conven
tion, will discuss state politics
and the building of a liberal co
alition for new politics.
The controversial Unruh, one
time nemesis of the issues
oriented California Democratic
Council, is now recognized as
the leader of the liberal wing of
the state's Democratic Party.
He is currently campaigning for
assembly candidates in his ef
fort to keep an anti-Reagan,
Democratic majority in the state
assembly.
Congressman Gubser, a veter
an of 16 years in the House of
Representatives, is a member of
the House Armed Services Com
mittee and ranking Republican
on its Special Investigations
Subcommittee.
Gubser sharply criticized the
division of American opinion be
tween the hawks and the doves
in a press conference last spring.
He said that "the thoughtful, de
liberate, and most logical policy
lies between the two extremes."
