between them and the student
movement—fall by the wayside
as we learn more about Ameri
can labor, from history of the
Wobblies to our own experiences
with today's striking farm work
ers.

Students and workers are get
ting together. Several of us join
every week in a study-action
group on American Labor, a
Free U class sponsored jointly
by A.F.T. Local 1816 and Stan
ford S.D.S.
Easy generalizations — about
working people, or about links

combined action and study in a
way seldom, if ever, achieved in
university courses.
Our demand is simple. Grapes
are being sold for a profit by
companies who will not even let
their workers vote on union rep
resentation. They must stop sell
ing them.
Their response is just as clear.
Store owners will not act unless
their profits are threatened.
Militant tactics in any strug
gle are usually frowned upon
by liberals who claim to support
the cause involved. Yet we've
already learned why militancy is
needed. We've learned who must
be convinced in any labor strug
gle. The owners who finally
make the decisions.
Store employees are almost
unanimous in feeling the grapes
should not be sold—indicating
that worker control of the work
ing place would mean a radical
change in the economy, if work
ers used it to support other
working people.
But the men who make deci
sions care only how much it will
cost them not to comply with
the demand.
We are beginning to learn
something about rationality too.
The farm workers, even if orga
nized, face continuing automa
tion of their industry.
Machines that can replace un
pleasant human labor should be
welcomed by everybody. Yet
machines in this economy mean
loss of jobs and income, & more
unpleasant prospect than the
work.

Farm workers, many of whose
families have worked the same
set of farms for many years,
will not benefit from these ma
chines. They will be forced to
enter a labor market for which
they lack skills and training.
What is rational? Is it sensi
ble to let the growers reap the
benefits of machines, or would
it be better for the farm work
ers to take over the farms and
run them, with or without the
machines?
We're learning some political
lessons as well. Humphrey has
bestowed his blessings on
UFWOC. Yet the government he
represents is unable to solve the
longer-range problems faced by
farm workers. And it is unwill
ing now to produce a victory in
the struggle with the growers.
Such "support" as Humphrey
represents has a price. The farm
workers are to ignore imperial
ism's tendency to export the en
tire problem by moving business
to the Third World. A trend ac
celerating in agri-business, the
transfer of capital to cheap la
bor markets not only jeopar
dizes the jobs of farm workers
here, but also deepens exploita
tion of their brothers around the
world.
Labor struggles are protract
ed, as are any struggles by peo
ple who have not fully organized
their potential power. Student
involvement, it seems, is more
than helpful. It is our only way
of understanding change in this
society and the obstacles to
change.
