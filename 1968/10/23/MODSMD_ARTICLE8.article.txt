When Baron de Coubertin revived the Olympics more than 70
years ago, he hoped the new version of an ancient athletic spec
tacular would provide a meeting ground where all men could
compete in a spirit of sportsmanship and brotherhood.
In his day, athletics were not used for political purposes. To
day, things are different. In international events an athlete no
longer competes for the joy of the sport but strives to maintain
his country's image.
This has been true at least since 1936 when Hitler tried to use
the games to prove Aryan superiority but failed because of Jesse
Owens.
America's black athletes came close to boycotting the 1968
games entirely. But, for a multitude of reasons, they decided to
attend and leave each competitor free to protest the situation of
his race in his own way.
In this spirit Jimmy Hines and Charlie Greene refused to ac
cept their medals from Avery Brundage—whom they consider to
be a racist.
Tommy Smith and John Carlos felt the same way. But they
decided to carry the move one step further. As they stood on the
victory stand with the Star Spangled Banner being played, each
raised a black-gloved fist and looked at the ground.
The Olympic games should be an individual rather than a na
tionalistic competition. But as long as the United States is going
to count medals, black people should be allowed to demonstrate
their involvement in their own political struggle.
We believe that the black fist has just as much right to a place
in the symbolism of the Olympics as the Stars and Stripes.
The International Olympic Committee showed itself to be both
biased and short-sighted in dismissing Smith and Carlos.
