# Philophohia: half way to thanksgiving
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
To the dismay of some, the
surprise of many, and the relief
of most, we are half way to
Thanksgiving, and Stanford is
still in one piece.

Stanford is not alone. Across
the nation, the predictions of
a "Fall of confrontation and dis
ruption" at universities appear
sensationally incorrect. Many
days remain before Christmas,
and beyond, before June, but the
first weeks of the academic year
may not have been a placid,
quiet, peaceful fluke.
Several forces have emerged
at Stanford this fall which, held
in a somewhat odd and shakey
balance, have established a mood

of reason, cooperation, and crea
tive energy. They are the ad
ministration, the faculty, the
student body. And more speci
fically, they are Robert Glaser,
the academic senate, Denis
Hayes, the Students for a Dem
ocratic Society (SDS).
This mixed bag has produced
some exciting leadership, a re
strained, yet serious, use of pow
er, and a great deal of finesse.
For many years it was ab

sent at Stanford. But finesse
need not only imply maneuver
ing at the expense of basic is
sues and questions.
Maneuvering and political
strategy are not new at Stan
ford, but their history here is
marked by heavy - handed
schemes and attempts to dull a
legitimate confrontation by out
finessing one's antagonist, and
the hell with the issue.
Creative finesse can avoid a
crisis while confronting an issue.
It can remove the heated emo
tions from issues and discuss
the substantive problems.
People in power can use fi
nesse most effectively and fairly,
as Acting President Glaser
proved with the SDS-SRI issue.

SRI, in fact, used sensible fi
nesse by agreeing to talk with
SDS and cooperate with a re
view of SRI activities.
In less dramatic fashion, the
academic senate has finessed the
ROTC issue and Denis Hayes is
beginning to finesse the Board of
of Trustees.
The senate and Hayes will per
haps look uncharitably on the
word finesse, considering its per
jorative connotations. In one
sense of finesse, however, they
have moved toward settlement
of some serious concerns while
avoiding tense confrontations
and demands. They have out
finessed the politics of their con
cerns.
The one group seemingly in
capable of using either respon
sible or irresponsible finesse is
SDS. They persist in making the
cliche demand, using the cliche
tactic, and, increasingly, ending
in a cliche of failure.
Very seriously, this is a pity.
SDS is the one group at Stan
ford intensely aware and acute
ly concerned about the state of
the University, nation, and
world.ln many ways, the mem
bers of SDS are the most sensi
tive people at Stanford. They do
not look at problems and turn
their backs; they are wounded
when other human beings are
hurt in Vietnam, Chicago, or
Oakland. They feel, unlike many
of their contemporaries.
They fail miserably, however,
when they translate their feel
ings into demands, tactics, and
action. They seek the wider sup
port of students, but do not ap
preciate the mood of students.
Nor do they frame demands in a
sensible, appealing manner. It
is always SRl's imperialism or
Stanford's imperialism or the na
tion's imperialism. Imperialism
exists in all three, but SDS
beats the word into mediocrity.
SDS members should stop
talking to themselves and begin
discussing issues and ideas with
less radical students. Only then
can their movement gain some
broad based support as they
gain a wider perspective on the
people they need.

tive people at Stanford. They do
not look at problems and turn
their backs; they are wounded
when other human beings are
hurt in Vietnam, Chicago, or
Oakland. They feel, unlike many
of their contemporaries.
They fail miserably, however,
when they translate their feel
ings into demands, tactics, and
action. They seek the wider sup
port of students, but do not ap
preciate the mood of students.
Nor do they frame demands in a
sensible, appealing manner. It
is always SRl's imperialism or
Stanford's imperialism or the na
tion's imperialism. Imperialism
exists in all three, but SDS
beats the word into mediocrity.
SDS members should stop
talking to themselves and begin
discussing issues and ideas with
less radical students. Only then
can their movement gain some
broad based support as they
gain a wider perspective on the
people they need.
To the dismay of some, the
surprise of many, and the relief
of most, we are half way to
Thanksgiving, and Stanford is
still in one piece.

Stanford is not alone. Across
the nation, the predictions of
a "Fall of confrontation and dis
ruption" at universities appear
sensationally incorrect. Many
days remain before Christmas,
and beyond, before June, but the
first weeks of the academic year
may not have been a placid,
quiet, peaceful fluke.
Several forces have emerged
at Stanford this fall which, held
in a somewhat odd and shakey
balance, have established a mood

of reason, cooperation, and crea
tive energy. They are the ad
ministration, the faculty, the
student body. And more speci
fically, they are Robert Glaser,
the academic senate, Denis
Hayes, the Students for a Dem
ocratic Society (SDS).
This mixed bag has produced
some exciting leadership, a re
strained, yet serious, use of pow
er, and a great deal of finesse.
For many years it was ab

sent at Stanford. But finesse
need not only imply maneuver
ing at the expense of basic is
sues and questions.
Maneuvering and political
strategy are not new at Stan
ford, but their history here is
marked by heavy - handed
schemes and attempts to dull a
legitimate confrontation by out
finessing one's antagonist, and
the hell with the issue.
Creative finesse can avoid a
crisis while confronting an issue.
It can remove the heated emo
tions from issues and discuss
the substantive problems.
People in power can use fi
nesse most effectively and fairly,
as Acting President Glaser
proved with the SDS-SRI issue.

SRI, in fact, used sensible fi
nesse by agreeing to talk with
SDS and cooperate with a re
view of SRI activities.
In less dramatic fashion, the
academic senate has finessed the
ROTC issue and Denis Hayes is
beginning to finesse the Board of
of Trustees.
The senate and Hayes will per
haps look uncharitably on the
word finesse, considering its per
jorative connotations. In one
sense of finesse, however, they
have moved toward settlement
of some serious concerns while
avoiding tense confrontations
and demands. They have out
finessed the politics of their con
cerns.
The one group seemingly in
capable of using either respon
sible or irresponsible finesse is
SDS. They persist in making the
cliche demand, using the cliche
tactic, and, increasingly, ending
in a cliche of failure.
Very seriously, this is a pity.
SDS is the one group at Stan
ford intensely aware and acute
ly concerned about the state of
the University, nation, and
world.ln many ways, the mem
bers of SDS are the most sensi
