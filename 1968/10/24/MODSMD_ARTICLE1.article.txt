# Gubser Urges Federal Techonological Build-Up
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
The question of research spon
sored by the federal government
is "the most important thing
facing the country today" and
the main theme of his cam
paign, stated Congressman
Charles S. Gubser yesterday.
Gubser, who is the Republican
incumbent from the 10th dis
trict, referred to Eldridge Clea
ver as being "just plain damn
dumb" in a meeting with the
Daily edit board.
In related Republican cam
paign activities, members of the
Youth for Nixon group on cam
pus recorded the questions of
about 30 students for the Re
publican standard bearer.
Stanford comments ranged
from questioning Nixon's pro
posal for a voluntary Army to
discouragement over his selec
tion of a running mate to gen
eral statements of support.
Gubser insisted that election
of Max Rafferty is essential for
"restoration of balanced think
ing" to the Senate. He renewed
his call for the eventual removal
of combatant troops from Viet
nam, saying tliat it is no longer
possible for the United States
to score a military victory in
that country.
18 Years In Politics
"I have learned from 18 years
in politics that it is the appli
cations of wisdom to alterna

tives," Gubser said in regards
to Rafferty. "And the alternative
here, though they may not be
entirely to my liking, indicate to
me that we should have a Re
publican."
Current fluctuations in re
search appropriations, because
it lacks "political sex appeal,"
could seriously destroy this
country's attempts to reach a
detente with the Communists,
Gubser warned.
"They may, and probably will,
come up with a technological
death grip at some future time-
And we will be sitting there at
the conference table technolog
icalyl naked," he said.
"I hope that I am wrong in
this regard," Gubser said. But
he pointed to the Russian policy
of a "research and development
program with a steady upward
trend, and not with interrup
tions" as preliminary indica
tions that he wasn't wrong.
Gubser spent a great deal of
time discussing his role on the
Special Investigations Subcom
mittee of the House Armed
Services Committee, which he
would chair should the Republi
cans take control of the 91st
Congress.
Procurement Policy
In addition to his concern over
research, Gubser said that he
would have the committee,
which is the only Armed Serv
ices subcommittee with sub

peonna power, look into the de
fense procurement process.
Insisting that he is not "the
darling of the Defense Depart
ment," Gubser took note of col
umnist Drew Pearson's reports.
"Mr. Pearson will undoubtedly
come around. He always does
about one week before my elec
tion," he said.
Gubser also took exception
with his opponent's charges that
repealing the Renegotiation Act
of 1945 would leave taxpayers
without an adequate check on
defense industries.
He charged Grayson Taketa
with distorting the fact that it
did save the country $2 billion
in the first five years of opera
tion. Since that time, Gubser
said, it has cost American tax
payers close to $60 million a
year.
The Truth in Negotiations Act
and the Defense Procurement
Act have replaced the need for
the older act, Gubser said.
Hotbed of Freedom
Gubser defended the univer
sity as a "hotbed of intellectual
freedom." But he went on to say
that the "small minority of stu
dents who claim to be intellec
tual liberals are some of the
worst reactionaries I have ever
seen."
H called on his audience to "go
out and tell these liberals to open
their minds and become true lib
erals."
