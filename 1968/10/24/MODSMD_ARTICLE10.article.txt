# Letters To The Editor
## Working Classes 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
As a teaching assistant (in
English), I am appalled at the
recent statements of some of
my colleagues demanding more
money from the University. The
rhetoric of this clique smacks of
the thirties and seems just one
more attempt by those of this
generation to emulate, vicar
iously, the vapid pieties of that
naive era.
It would be fine if salaries
were raised $700 or perhaps
doubled, but one realizes that
the University faces more im
portant priorities than the satis
faction of the creature comforts
of some graduate students who
seem bent on creating a "cause."
Let us examine this "brother
hood of the working classes"
and its own morality, since un
ionists are so very quick to de
ride the University's immorality.
First, the local here is part
of the AFT, the same white
racist union which has been
denying thousands of black chil
dren a meaningful education in
New York City. Instead of more
money for the teaching assist
ant's selfish interests, why not
more money for the still largely
token black students whom
Stanford has seen fit to bring
here?
Stanford has always been a
master at giving the illusion
that all are equal. For most
blacks here, the illusion is pretty
transparent.
Then, too, part of the dues
which the union collects is be
ing diverted (through the AFL
CIO) to support a war criminal
like Humphrey. How do our
good liberal humanists recon
cile this with their belief in a
new politics, a participatory
democracy?
Lastly, the unionists fail to
see the consequences of their
demands in terms of the Uni
versity itself.
Wc ire in a period of political
repression and things will get
much worse before they get bet
ter. Reactionaries like Nixon
and Reagan will be running the
show for the foreseeable future
and Stanford, like most schools,
will be forced to scrimp in many
areas if it is to retain its posi
tion as a first-rate university.
This is certainly not the time
for a few students to let per
sonal interest obscure the wider
perspective of education.
Unlike the union which mono
lithically claims to speak for
a group (I had been under the
impression that education
makes people responsible indi
viduals. not part of a homogen
ized mass), I speak only for my
self.
But, as long as I do speak, I
can guarantee the union will fall
short of unanimity of support
for its demands.

Editor, The DAILY
Those of us who were moved
and disturbed by the quiet in
tegrity and utter authenticity of
Fr. Daniel Berrigan, S.J., are left
wondering what kind of response
we can make to his own act of
protest against the war in Viet
nam.
The option of napalming draft
board records, as he did, may
not be open to many or even at
tractive to many, and he would
be the last to say that what he
had to do is what another person
should do.
But there is a way in which
those who wish to involve them
selves can do so. For since Fr.
Berrigan's arrest, another group
of Roman Catholic priests and

laymen—the Milwaukee Four
teen —has burned draft records
in Milwaukee.
There is desperate need to
raise bail money for them, and
to provide for their legal de
fense. Even those who disagree
with this tactic can surely back
the right of such persons to be
at liberty until the time of trial,
and to ensure attorneys' fees for
their defense.
Bail currently comes to $415,-
000, and attorneys' fees will be
at least $70,000. Those who can
not give sums of money are en
couraged to make loans for the
raising of bail, and such sums
will be returned once the trial
has been completed. (No one
nef>d fear that these particular
individuals are going to jump
bail.)
Cash, checks or money orders
can be sent directly to Milwau
kee 14 Defense Fund, General
Delivery Box 5405, Milwaukee,
Wisconsin.
Support of this group is sure
ly called for on the part of all
who disavow the grotesque set
of moral priorities our country
has established, in which one
man is convicted as a criminal
for burning paper while another
man is acclaimed as a hero for
burning children.

For those who spent some
time last week picketing at lo
cal supermarkets for the grape
boycott, the tone of the letter
in Monday's Daily responding to
my article on the San Joaquin
Valley must have been very fa
miliar.
Confronting our middle-class
community last week meant be
ing told that "your facts are
wrong" by people who refused to
listen to those facts.
It meant people bowing their
heads as they went by and peo
ple entering the store by squirm
ing past the "out" electric door.
It meant people asking the clerk
to put the grapes they bought in
a plastic bag (to wave in our
faces.)
It meant people asking who
really paid you and people tell
ing us to "get a job and stop
wasting your time;" and it
meant learning that there really
are people who believe that all
students are Communists. (The
man who got me mad enough to
respond to his question with,
"Yeah, I'm a Communist," was
equal to it: "You look like one.")
But above all it meant learn
ing that just our presence in the
supermarket parking-lot was
found threatening (we had in
vaded their temple and looked
like we might pray); the con
trolling emotion those sifter
noons was fear.
The United Farm Workers is
a statement by the farm-work
ers of California that there
must be a change in the feudal
society created by the agricul
tural interests. They are not
willing to play serf to the grow
er's lord-master.
This is the explanation of the
intransigence of the growers,
who would have settled long ago
if it were just a business deci
sion: "I'll flood my fields before
I deal with the union," one said
recently (in private.)
The whole system of values on
which these men build their lives
is being challenged as rotten and
corrupt and that is a hard thing
for a man to accept. If I hadn't
seen the human cost of that sys
tem of values, I might almost
feel sorry for them.

As a teaching assistant (in
English), I am appalled at the
recent statements of some of
my colleagues demanding more
money from the University. The
rhetoric of this clique smacks of
the thirties and seems just one
more attempt by those of this
generation to emulate, vicar
iously, the vapid pieties of that
naive era.
It would be fine if salaries
were raised $700 or perhaps
doubled, but one realizes that
the University faces more im
portant priorities than the satis
faction of the creature comforts
of some graduate students who
seem bent on creating a "cause."
Let us examine this "brother
hood of the working classes"
and its own morality, since un
ionists are so very quick to de
ride the University's immorality.
First, the local here is part
of the AFT, the same white
racist union which has been
denying thousands of black chil
dren a meaningful education in
New York City. Instead of more
money for the teaching assist
ant's selfish interests, why not
more money for the still largely
token black students whom
Stanford has seen fit to bring
here?
Stanford has always been a
master at giving the illusion
that all are equal. For most
blacks here, the illusion is pretty
transparent.
Then, too, part of the dues
which the union collects is be
ing diverted (through the AFL
CIO) to support a war criminal
like Humphrey. How do our
good liberal humanists recon
cile this with their belief in a
new politics, a participatory
democracy?
Lastly, the unionists fail to
see the consequences of their
demands in terms of the Uni
versity itself.
Wc ire in a period of political
repression and things will get
much worse before they get bet
ter. Reactionaries like Nixon
and Reagan will be running the
show for the foreseeable future
and Stanford, like most schools,
will be forced to scrimp in many
areas if it is to retain its posi
tion as a first-rate university.
This is certainly not the time
for a few students to let per
sonal interest obscure the wider
perspective of education.
Unlike the union which mono
lithically claims to speak for
a group (I had been under the
impression that education
makes people responsible indi
viduals. not part of a homogen
ized mass), I speak only for my
self.
But, as long as I do speak, I
can guarantee the union will fall
short of unanimity of support
for its demands.

Those of us who were moved
and disturbed by the quiet in
tegrity and utter authenticity of
Fr. Daniel Berrigan, S.J., are left
wondering what kind of response
we can make to his own act of
protest against the war in Viet
nam.
The option of napalming draft
board records, as he did, may
not be open to many or even at
tractive to many, and he would
be the last to say that what he
had to do is what another person
should do.
But there is a way in which
those who wish to involve them
selves can do so. For since Fr.
Berrigan's arrest, another group
of Roman Catholic priests and

laymen—the Milwaukee Four
teen —has burned draft records
in Milwaukee.
There is desperate need to
raise bail money for them, and
to provide for their legal de
fense. Even those who disagree
with this tactic can surely back
the right of such persons to be
at liberty until the time of trial,
and to ensure attorneys' fees for
their defense.
Bail currently comes to $415,-
000, and attorneys' fees will be
at least $70,000. Those who can
not give sums of money are en
couraged to make loans for the
raising of bail, and such sums
will be returned once the trial
has been completed. (No one
nef>d fear that these particular
individuals are going to jump
bail.)
Cash, checks or money orders
can be sent directly to Milwau
kee 14 Defense Fund, General
Delivery Box 5405, Milwaukee,
Wisconsin.
Support of this group is sure
ly called for on the part of all
who disavow the grotesque set
of moral priorities our country
has established, in which one
man is convicted as a criminal
for burning paper while another
man is acclaimed as a hero for
burning children.

For those who spent some
time last week picketing at lo
cal supermarkets for the grape
boycott, the tone of the letter
in Monday's Daily responding to
my article on the San Joaquin
Valley must have been very fa
miliar.
Confronting our middle-class
community last week meant be
ing told that "your facts are
wrong" by people who refused to
listen to those facts.
It meant people bowing their
heads as they went by and peo
ple entering the store by squirm
ing past the "out" electric door.
It meant people asking the clerk
to put the grapes they bought in
a plastic bag (to wave in our
faces.)
It meant people asking who
really paid you and people tell
ing us to "get a job and stop
wasting your time;" and it
meant learning that there really
are people who believe that all
students are Communists. (The
man who got me mad enough to
respond to his question with,
"Yeah, I'm a Communist," was
equal to it: "You look like one.")
But above all it meant learn
ing that just our presence in the
supermarket parking-lot was
found threatening (we had in
vaded their temple and looked
like we might pray); the con
trolling emotion those sifter
noons was fear.
The United Farm Workers is
a statement by the farm-work
ers of California that there
must be a change in the feudal
society created by the agricul
tural interests. They are not
willing to play serf to the grow
er's lord-master.
This is the explanation of the
intransigence of the growers,
who would have settled long ago
if it were just a business deci
sion: "I'll flood my fields before
I deal with the union," one said
recently (in private.)
The whole system of values on
which these men build their lives
is being challenged as rotten and
corrupt and that is a hard thing
for a man to accept. If I hadn't
seen the human cost of that sys
tem of values, I might almost
feel sorry for them.

Editor, The Daily:
As a teaching assistant (in
English), I am appalled at the
recent statements of some of
my colleagues demanding more
money from the University. The
rhetoric of this clique smacks of
the thirties and seems just one
more attempt by those of this
generation to emulate, vicar
iously, the vapid pieties of that
naive era.
It would be fine if salaries
were raised $700 or perhaps
doubled, but one realizes that
the University faces more im
portant priorities than the satis
faction of the creature comforts
of some graduate students who
seem bent on creating a "cause."
Let us examine this "brother
hood of the working classes"
and its own morality, since un
ionists are so very quick to de
ride the University's immorality.
First, the local here is part
of the AFT, the same white
racist union which has been
denying thousands of black chil
dren a meaningful education in
New York City. Instead of more
money for the teaching assist
ant's selfish interests, why not
more money for the still largely
token black students whom
Stanford has seen fit to bring
here?
Stanford has always been a
master at giving the illusion
that all are equal. For most
blacks here, the illusion is pretty
transparent.
Then, too, part of the dues
which the union collects is be
ing diverted (through the AFL
CIO) to support a war criminal
like Humphrey. How do our
good liberal humanists recon
cile this with their belief in a
new politics, a participatory
democracy?
Lastly, the unionists fail to
see the consequences of their
demands in terms of the Uni
versity itself.
Wc ire in a period of political
repression and things will get
much worse before they get bet
ter. Reactionaries like Nixon
and Reagan will be running the
show for the foreseeable future
and Stanford, like most schools,
will be forced to scrimp in many
areas if it is to retain its posi
tion as a first-rate university.
This is certainly not the time
for a few students to let per
sonal interest obscure the wider
perspective of education.
Unlike the union which mono
lithically claims to speak for
a group (I had been under the
impression that education
makes people responsible indi
viduals. not part of a homogen
ized mass), I speak only for my
self.
But, as long as I do speak, I
can guarantee the union will fall
short of unanimity of support
for its demands.

Those of us who were moved
and disturbed by the quiet in
tegrity and utter authenticity of
Fr. Daniel Berrigan, S.J., are left
wondering what kind of response
we can make to his own act of
protest against the war in Viet
nam.
The option of napalming draft
board records, as he did, may
not be open to many or even at
tractive to many, and he would
be the last to say that what he
had to do is what another person
should do.
But there is a way in which
those who wish to involve them
selves can do so. For since Fr.
Berrigan's arrest, another group
of Roman Catholic priests and

laymen—the Milwaukee Four
teen —has burned draft records
in Milwaukee.
There is desperate need to
raise bail money for them, and
to provide for their legal de
fense. Even those who disagree
with this tactic can surely back
the right of such persons to be

will be forced to scrimp in many
areas if it is to retain its posi
tion as a first-rate university.
This is certainly not the time
for a few students to let per
sonal interest obscure the wider
perspective of education.
Unlike the union which mono
lithically claims to speak for
a group (I had been under the
impression that education
makes people responsible indi
viduals. not part of a homogen
ized mass), I speak only for my
self.
But, as long as I do speak, I
can guarantee the union will fall
short of unanimity of support
for its demands.

• Aid To Priests
Editor, The DAILY
Those of us who were moved
and disturbed by the quiet in
tegrity and utter authenticity of
Fr. Daniel Berrigan, S.J., are left
wondering what kind of response
we can make to his own act of
protest against the war in Viet
nam.
The option of napalming draft
board records, as he did, may
not be open to many or even at
tractive to many, and he would
be the last to say that what he
had to do is what another person
should do.
But there is a way in which
those who wish to involve them
selves can do so. For since Fr.
Berrigan's arrest, another group
of Roman Catholic priests and

laymen—the Milwaukee Four
teen —has burned draft records
in Milwaukee.
There is desperate need to
raise bail money for them, and
to provide for their legal de
fense. Even those who disagree
with this tactic can surely back
the right of such persons to be
at liberty until the time of trial,
and to ensure attorneys' fees for
their defense.
Bail currently comes to $415,-
000, and attorneys' fees will be
at least $70,000. Those who can
not give sums of money are en
couraged to make loans for the
raising of bail, and such sums
will be returned once the trial
has been completed. (No one
nef>d fear that these particular
individuals are going to jump
bail.)
Cash, checks or money orders
can be sent directly to Milwau
kee 14 Defense Fund, General
Delivery Box 5405, Milwaukee,
Wisconsin.
Support of this group is sure
ly called for on the part of all
who disavow the grotesque set
of moral priorities our country
has established, in which one
man is convicted as a criminal
for burning paper while another
man is acclaimed as a hero for
burning children.

• Right To Strike
Editor, The DAILY:
For those who spent some
time last week picketing at lo
cal supermarkets for the grape
boycott, the tone of the letter
in Monday's Daily responding to
my article on the San Joaquin
Valley must have been very fa
miliar.
Confronting our middle-class
community last week meant be
ing told that "your facts are
wrong" by people who refused to
listen to those facts.
It meant people bowing their
heads as they went by and peo
ple entering the store by squirm
ing past the "out" electric door.
It meant people asking the clerk
to put the grapes they bought in
a plastic bag (to wave in our
faces.)
It meant people asking who
really paid you and people tell
ing us to "get a job and stop
wasting your time;" and it
meant learning that there really
are people who believe that all
students are Communists. (The
man who got me mad enough to
respond to his question with,
"Yeah, I'm a Communist," was
equal to it: "You look like one.")
But above all it meant learn
ing that just our presence in the
supermarket parking-lot was
found threatening (we had in
vaded their temple and looked
like we might pray); the con
trolling emotion those sifter
noons was fear.
The United Farm Workers is
a statement by the farm-work
ers of California that there
must be a change in the feudal
society created by the agricul
tural interests. They are not
willing to play serf to the grow
er's lord-master.
This is the explanation of the
intransigence of the growers,
who would have settled long ago
if it were just a business deci
sion: "I'll flood my fields before
I deal with the union," one said
recently (in private.)
The whole system of values on
which these men build their lives
is being challenged as rotten and
corrupt and that is a hard thing
for a man to accept. If I hadn't
seen the human cost of that sys
tem of values, I might almost
feel sorry for them.
