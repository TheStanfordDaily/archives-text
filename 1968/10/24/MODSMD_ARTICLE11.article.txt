## Psych Dept: 'Too Many Students' 
### ALAN GLAROS 
"The psychology department
has too many students," said Dr.
Albert Hastorf, executive head
of the psychology department in
a recent interview.
Dr. Hastorf also indicated that
the department suffers from a
lack of facilities and student
misunderstanding of the depart
ment's theoretical orientation.
Dr. Hastorf noted that the de
partment has approximately 400
undergraduate majors and sug
gested that the university not
allow sophomores to declare a
major. The problem, he stated,
was "too many people pick a
major too early."
Hastorf felt that not allowing
students to declare a major un
til the junior year would result
in students making a more per
manent commitment to a field
of study and would, as a result,
take some of the pressure off
the psychology department.
Enrollment Down
But these measures would
have little effect on the intro
ductory Psychology I course. Dr.
J. Merrill C'arlsmith, assistant
professor of psychology, stated
that approximately 340 students
are currently enrolled in Psy
chology I. This figure, said Dr.
Carlsmith, was down from last
year's high of 450 students.

Carlsmith, one of the two lec
turers for this quarter's Psy
chology I class, indicated that
very few students take the
course merely to satisfy the
General Studies requirements.
Quoting a study done by un
dergraduate student Jeff Blum
for the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES), Carlsmith
showed that 8 of 183 students
were taking 'Psychology I pri
marily to satisfy the General
Studies requirements. In con
trast, 58 of 89 Geology I stu
dents were taking the course
primarily for General Studies.
Contrast
When the students were asked
if they would have taken the
course even if it did not satisfy
General Studies,f 163 of 183 stu
dents in Psychology I said yes,
while only 20 of 97 students in
Geology I said yes.
The crunch in the classroom
is not limited to the Psychology
department. The Sociology I
class has approximately 250 stu
dents enrolled, while Anthropol
ogy I has about 400 students.
But sociology and anthropology
can only claim a total of 130 un
dergraduate majors, while psy
chology has at least 350 majors.
When asked why psychology
was so popular with the stu
dents, Dr. Carlsm|th stated, "We

have more to say that's of In
terest."
Other Problems
Dr. Hastorf also indicated oth
er problem areas in the depart
ment. Calling the present facili
ties "terrible," Hastorf stated,
"this instittuion has built re
markably few facilities." He
said psychology's offices and
laboratories are spread all over
campus, from Ventura Hall to
Alvarado Row.
He also noted that classrooms,
offices and laboratories will be
centralized in Jordan Hall when
the renovation is completed in
1970.
But student opinion still per
sists that the department is "be
havioralistic." This, says Has
torf, is "a complete mis-state
ment of facts." He called the de
partment "data-oriented, not ex
istential" or behavioral.
Research Changing
Hastorf said while the re
search orientation of the depart
ment is not changing, the kinds
of research being done is chang
ing. He stated that the ma
jority of the department is do
ing research on interaction
between adults and between
adults and children. According
to Hastorf, only "2Vfe" members
of the department are engaged
in purely physiological research.

Dr. Carlsmith felt the stu
dent's opinions about the psy
chology department were "quite
true. Anybody in his right mind
is a behavioralist."
Carlsmith suggested the opin
ion may have arisen because of
students' "naive conception of
psychology as a combination of
Freud, Maslow, and Franz
Perls" when psychology actual

ly is a discipline based on the
scientific method.
If psychology were not a dis
cipline, said Dr. Hastorf, the de
partment would "give up its
soul."

ogy I has about 400 students.
But sociology and anthropology
can only claim a total of 130 un
dergraduate majors, while psy
chology has at least 350 majors.
When asked why psychology
was so popular with the stu
dents, Dr. Carlsm|th stated, "We

have more to say that's of In
terest."
Other Problems
Dr. Hastorf also indicated oth
er problem areas in the depart
ment. Calling the present facili
ties "terrible," Hastorf stated,
"this instittuion has built re
markably few facilities." He
said psychology's offices and
laboratories are spread all over
campus, from Ventura Hall to
Alvarado Row.
He also noted that classrooms,
offices and laboratories will be
centralized in Jordan Hall when
the renovation is completed in
1970.
But student opinion still per
sists that the department is "be
havioralistic." This, says Has
torf, is "a complete mis-state
ment of facts." He called the de
partment "data-oriented, not ex
istential" or behavioral.
Research Changing
Hastorf said while the re
search orientation of the depart
ment is not changing, the kinds
of research being done is chang
ing. He stated that the ma
jority of the department is do
ing research on interaction
between adults and between
adults and children. According
to Hastorf, only "2Vfe" members
of the department are engaged
in purely physiological research.

Dr. Carlsmith felt the stu
dent's opinions about the psy
chology department were "quite
true. Anybody in his right mind
is a behavioralist."
Carlsmith suggested the opin
ion may have arisen because of
students' "naive conception of
psychology as a combination of
Freud, Maslow, and Franz
Perls" when psychology actual

ly is a discipline based on the
scientific method.
If psychology were not a dis
cipline, said Dr. Hastorf, the de
partment would "give up its
soul."
"The psychology department
has too many students," said Dr.
Albert Hastorf, executive head
of the psychology department in
a recent interview.
Dr. Hastorf also indicated that
the department suffers from a
lack of facilities and student
misunderstanding of the depart
ment's theoretical orientation.
Dr. Hastorf noted that the de
partment has approximately 400
undergraduate majors and sug
gested that the university not
allow sophomores to declare a
major. The problem, he stated,
was "too many people pick a
major too early."
Hastorf felt that not allowing
students to declare a major un
til the junior year would result
in students making a more per
manent commitment to a field
of study and would, as a result,
take some of the pressure off
the psychology department.
Enrollment Down
But these measures would
have little effect on the intro
ductory Psychology I course. Dr.
J. Merrill C'arlsmith, assistant
professor of psychology, stated
that approximately 340 students
are currently enrolled in Psy
chology I. This figure, said Dr.
Carlsmith, was down from last
year's high of 450 students.

Carlsmith, one of the two lec
turers for this quarter's Psy
chology I class, indicated that
very few students take the
course merely to satisfy the
General Studies requirements.
Quoting a study done by un
dergraduate student Jeff Blum
for the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES), Carlsmith
showed that 8 of 183 students
were taking 'Psychology I pri
marily to satisfy the General
Studies requirements. In con
trast, 58 of 89 Geology I stu
dents were taking the course
primarily for General Studies.
Contrast
When the students were asked
if they would have taken the
course even if it did not satisfy
General Studies,f 163 of 183 stu
dents in Psychology I said yes,
while only 20 of 97 students in
Geology I said yes.
