## Opera's Triple Bill 
### PIERCE McNALLY 
The San Francisco Opera is
presenting a triple-bill perform
ance this season of Sehoenberg's
Erwartunjj, Weill's Royal I'aliu e,
and Milhauds's Christopher Col
iimhus. All of the operas are
twentieth century attempts to
revitalize the operatic art form.
The attempts are bold, at times
original, and sincere, but often
not successful.
Schoenberg wrote Erwartung,
or Exportation, in 1909 and
termed it "ntono-drama." It is
a thirty-minme npusic drama in
which the dramatic action con
sists of an anguished and im
passioned woman searching fur
tively through a forest for her
lover, who was to meet her
there, and eventually stumbling
over his cadavre. She then ques
tions the reasons for her search
for her lover and she is unable
to find an adequate answer.
The highly demanding role of
the woman was admirably exe
cuted by Marie Collier. The
young soprano showed consider
able acting ability and she car
ried the entire opera very suc
■essfully on her shoulders.
Mediocre Opera
Kurt Weill's Royal Palace,
vritten in the 1920'5, is a medi
>cre opera and the production
of the work in no way compen
sated for its lack of musical
opera is a forty

five minute ballet, punctuated
occasionally with voices from
the wings. The ballet itself was
sloppy at times and even the
principal ballerina. Christine
Mehl, made some mistakes in
fundamental ballet movement
which were manifest to the un
trained eye. The voices of Steph
en Janzen and Clifford Grant,
emanating from off-stage, were
effective, however Alan Crofeet
and tenor Vahan Khanzadian
seemed muffled and weak.
The production crew made ef
fective use of front and back
scrims, which gave the perform
ance a fascinating three-dimen
sional flavor, and at one point
some colorfully-lighted smoke
appeared behind the back scrim.
Poly-rhythie Patterns
Darius Milhaud, who spends a
considerable amount of time in
the Bay Area at Mills College
in Oakland, is one of the most
significant composers of the cen
tury. His orchestration of Chris
topher Columbus, is highly im
pressive. He makes use of broad
poly-rhythmic patterns under
lined by patterns of exquisite
tonal clarity and balance.
Milhaud and librettist Paul
Claudel, working in the early
1920's at the height of the Wag
nerian reaction, innovated many
techniques in an effort to make
the opera seem less staged.
Each of the fifteen scenes repre
sent a segment of Columbus's
life.
The story is about Columbus
and his trials in his search for
the wherewithall to journey to
America and the tribulations of
the voyage. The two Columbus'
were well played by Thomas
Tiption and Allan Monk, both
from a dramatic and musical
viewpoint.
The clarity and resonance of

Tipton's voice, especially, is re
markable. The narrator, how
ever. played hy William Wilser
mann, has a raspy, heavy voice
that sounds so very sinister. Un
duly so, it might be added. The
chorus is huge and not very
good, often unsynchronized and
cubersome.
The costumes are very color
ful and the scenes with large
numbers of people are handled
efficiently. The frequ-nt scene
changes are accomplished with
the minimum of noise and time
elapsed.
For all its innovations, how
ever. there is a rather slow qual
ity about each scene. For in
stance, when the mutinous sail
ors confront Columbus, demand
ing a return to Spain, during
Columbus' response, ther n is
■-oinMhing very static about the
atmosphere, in nearly every
scne, there is a point at which
it focuses on one person and
'hnn the opera begins to sink.
It is, however, a significant and
njoyablc work, magnificently
orchestrated and successfully
executed.
The San Francisco Opera is
to be congratulated for staging
these difficult undertakings.
Their production shows imagin
ation and a considerable degree
of taste. Although some tech
niques were less successful than
others, they were all well
thought out and. for the most
part, well done. The San Fran
cisco Opera is one company
which is willing to try new pro
ductions such as these and last
year's performance of The Vis
itation, by Gunther Sehuller. If
the operatic aesthetic can be re
vitalized, it will be in San Fran
cisco where the new aesthetic
will emerge and get adequate
attention.
