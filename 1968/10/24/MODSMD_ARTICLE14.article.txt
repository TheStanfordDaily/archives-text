# Murder Steals Heart

### DAN MELLINKOFF 
The Stanford heart transplant
team has lost a potential donor.
Robert Bush, originally thought
a suicide victim, lost his donor's
status late Monday night be
cause it is now believed he may
have actually been murdered.
The 18-year-old Oroville youth
was admitted to the Stanford
Hospital Sunday allegedly suf
fering from a self-inflicted gun
wound. His heart was donated
for a transplant when death was
determined to be inevitable.
Tests were being conducted to
determine compatibility of a po
tential recipient. The Santa
Clara County Coroner had
cleared the use of the heart. This
clearance is needed in any case
of possible homicide. In spite of

these preliminaries no plans or
arrangements had been made
for an operation.
On Monday at 11 p.m. Butte
County authorities notified Coro
ner John Hauser that murder
was suspected. All tests were
halted.
Bush died Tuesday afternoon
at 4:40. The body was trans
ferred to the Coroner's Office.
It was origina'ly thought
Bush shot himself after an argu
ment with his girl friend. How
ever, the Butte County Sheriff's
Office is now holding Calvin Cur
tis Carter, another 18-year-old
Oroville youth, in connection
with the Bush slaying. He is also
the suspected murderer of
Howard R. Stanley, an Oroville
man who was murdered in July.
An important moral question

has been raised by the Bush
case. If the operation had been
begun, what action would have
been taken?
Hospital official Spiros Andre
opoulus stated that the question
was too problematic but that the
Hospital had operated under
guidelines established by the
Coroner's Office.
He felt that the operation
would have boon continued once
bogun. He said, "We need only
tho heart." Tho purpose of an
autopsy is only to find the cause
of death. This would not involve
tho heart."
Although Andreopoulus con
sidered it an unlikely case, he
said once the operation was be
gun the heart would be used and
the body would be returned.
