# Bowlers Edge UCD, Await Strong Bears
## 
### 
The Stanford men's bowling
team opened its 1968-69 season
last Sunday with a 7-3 victory
over UC Davis at Tresidder
Union.
The Northern California Inter
collegiate Masters League, with
teams from Stanford, Santa
Clara, UC Berkeley, UC Davis,
and Chico State, is operating un
der a new format this year.
Instead of the traditional four
point scoring, one for each of
three games and one for total
pins, the NCIML's new format
includes two team games, two
doubles games, and a final single
game between the top bowler
from each team.
Each team game is worth two
points, the three doubles and one
singles match one point each,
and a ninth point for total pins.
Bonus points are also awarded
for high individual games.
The Indian keglers split Sun

day's team games, losing the
first by 54 pins, but taking the
second by a slim two-pin mar
gin.
The doubles teams of John
Steele - Rich Nielsen and Doug
Pirnie - John Wright were both
victorious while Jeff Bonzon and
Ralph Kimball were defeated.
In the singles match, Steele
edged Tom Compton of Davis,
180-171. Compton had rolled 822
for the first four games.
Stanford accumulated 72 more
total pins than Davis, 4213-4141,
and picked up the day's only
bonus point on Steele's 233 in
the second team game.
The Indian bowlers' next
match will be away against a
powerhouse UC Berkeley team
the Friday night before Big
Game.
Stanford's women bowlers also
had their first match Sunday,
losing to the UC Davis women,
8-1.
