# Meet With Administrators
## TA's Discuss Salary Rise 
### 
University officials countered
teaching assistant (TA) de
mands for a $700 per year salary
increases with claims that satis
faction of the demands would
cost Stanford almost a quarter
of a million dollars per year.
Vice Provost E. Howard
Brooks told negotiators from
the political science and English
departments and the American
Federation of Teachers (AFT)
local graduate student union
that any salary increases would
be extended to all eligible TA's,
and that this would add up to
an additional $245,000 per year.
But Brooks expressed no op
timism that funds could be
found for such an increase by
the start of winter quarter, as
requested by 11 political science
and 30 English TA's.
Cutbacks in federal research
expenditures, now estimated at
$7 million for Stanford this year,
have changed a projected sur
plus of $250,000 to a deficit of
around $700,000 for the current
year, he said.
Empty Pockets
This leaves "not even a nickel"
for possible salary increases this
year and very little incremental
funds to be distributed to all
areas next year, Brooks claimed.
Budget cuts in some other area,
such as administrative or fac
ulty salaries or library appro
priations, would be necessary in
order to finance a salary in
crease for all 350 Stanford TA's.

Brooks agreed with political
science TA steward Richard
Young that the University faces
"very serious" problems in TA
salaries and is "substantially be
hind our competition" at other
universities. He agreed heartily
with Young's analysis of the
high cost of living in this area.
Young and outgoing AFT
President Andrew Moss pointed
out that TA's "are salaried em
ployees providing a professional
service," and as such deserve
proper compensation.
"Even at $3000 per year we'd
be poorly paid," Young com
mented.
Poverty Living
Young explained that TA's are
living under extreme hardship
with the current $2300 salary
plus nine units' free tuition to
ward a graduate degree. He list
ed housing, automobile costs,
hospitalization and doctor care,
and food costs as reasons for
forcing most TA's into large
debts.
Young also claimed that
teaching assistantships keep
graduate students from achiev
ing normal progress toward de
grees. "It's a counter-productive
operation; TA's fall behind one
quarter of work for each year
as a TA," Young stated.
Young warned that a strike
would be the logical outcome if
the University could find no
funds for TA salary increases
before the Nov. 30 deadline

promulgated by the TA's, but
that such an action would be
beneficial to no one.
Brooks replied that the salary
increase would amount to $182,-
000 for the remaining two quar
ters of the current academic
year. "The only way I can see
this (increase) is by dropping
something else," he dec'arod.
Major reductions would prob
ably involve cutbacks in person
nel, since payroll accounts for
three-fourths of the University's
operating budget.
Next: Renegotiation
Young asked that the two
groups meet again soon, at
which time Brooks would pre
sent the TA's a counter-proposal.
Another meeting was scheduled
for two weeks hence.
Afterward. Young commented
that Administrators view TA
salaries as stipends that aid
graduate students in financing
their education, rather than as
a salary for services performed
for undergraduate teaching.
"It's our concern that under
graduate education be made a
higher priority budget item. We
want the trustees and Adminis
tration to rethink their alloca
tion priorities," Young stated.
Brooks added that his next
step would be to contact deans
and department heads. "We will
look into this problem, and it is
a problem, on a University-wide
basis," he said.

and department heads. "We will
look into this problem, and it is
a problem, on a University-wide
basis," he said.
University officials countered
teaching assistant (TA) de
mands for a $700 per year salary
increases with claims that satis
faction of the demands would
cost Stanford almost a quarter
of a million dollars per year.
Vice Provost E. Howard
Brooks told negotiators from
the political science and English
departments and the American
Federation of Teachers (AFT)
local graduate student union
that any salary increases would
be extended to all eligible TA's,
and that this would add up to
an additional $245,000 per year.
But Brooks expressed no op
timism that funds could be
found for such an increase by
the start of winter quarter, as
requested by 11 political science
and 30 English TA's.
Cutbacks in federal research
expenditures, now estimated at
$7 million for Stanford this year,
have changed a projected sur
plus of $250,000 to a deficit of
around $700,000 for the current
year, he said.
Empty Pockets
This leaves "not even a nickel"
for possible salary increases this
year and very little incremental
funds to be distributed to all
areas next year, Brooks claimed.
Budget cuts in some other area,
such as administrative or fac
ulty salaries or library appro
priations, would be necessary in
order to finance a salary in
crease for all 350 Stanford TA's.

Brooks agreed with political
science TA steward Richard
Young that the University faces
"very serious" problems in TA
salaries and is "substantially be
hind our competition" at other
universities. He agreed heartily
with Young's analysis of the
high cost of living in this area.
Young and outgoing AFT
President Andrew Moss pointed
out that TA's "are salaried em
ployees providing a professional
service," and as such deserve
proper compensation.
"Even at $3000 per year we'd
be poorly paid," Young com
mented.
Poverty Living
Young explained that TA's are
living under extreme hardship
with the current $2300 salary
plus nine units' free tuition to
ward a graduate degree. He list
ed housing, automobile costs,
hospitalization and doctor care,
and food costs as reasons for
forcing most TA's into large
debts.
Young also claimed that
teaching assistantships keep
graduate students from achiev
ing normal progress toward de
grees. "It's a counter-productive
operation; TA's fall behind one
quarter of work for each year
as a TA," Young stated.
Young warned that a strike
would be the logical outcome if
the University could find no
funds for TA salary increases
before the Nov. 30 deadline

promulgated by the TA's, but
that such an action would be
beneficial to no one.
Brooks replied that the salary
increase would amount to $182,-
000 for the remaining two quar
ters of the current academic
year. "The only way I can see
this (increase) is by dropping
something else," he dec'arod.
Major reductions would prob
ably involve cutbacks in person
nel, since payroll accounts for
three-fourths of the University's
operating budget.
Next: Renegotiation
Young asked that the two
groups meet again soon, at
which time Brooks would pre
sent the TA's a counter-proposal.
Another meeting was scheduled
for two weeks hence.
Afterward. Young commented
that Administrators view TA
salaries as stipends that aid
graduate students in financing
their education, rather than as
a salary for services performed
for undergraduate teaching.
"It's our concern that under
graduate education be made a
higher priority budget item. We
want the trustees and Adminis
tration to rethink their alloca
tion priorities," Young stated.
Brooks added that his next
step would be to contact deans
and department heads. "We will
look into this problem, and it is
