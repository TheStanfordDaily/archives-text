# Lecture Series Creates Critic-Artist Exchange
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
An innovation is taking place
at Stanford on Thursday eve
nings in Tresidder Memorial
Union's Large Lounge.
In the past the University has
taken an academic approach in
its position on such things as
the performing arts according
to Dean Nielson, Cultural Arts
Division Chairman at Tresidder.
Nielson has undertaken to do
something about it with the es
tablishment of a criticism lec
ture series, a program which
brings together Bay Area critics
in various fields every Thursday
night at 8 p.m.
"We want," said Nielson, "to
try through this to bring about
more of an open free creative
environment instead of an aca
demic dissecting approach we
find here."
Nielson said that the current
approach has been to study and

analyze rather than to peruse.
Art has become more art his
tory while music is more of a
course in musieology.
'There is a tremendous amount
of material here that needs to
be exposed but isn't. Our com
mittee as an organization seeks
to bring into the spotlight peo
ple who really have talent."
"This is an attempt to bring
together artists and critics and
to set up an interchange. It is a
rare opportunity. Artists usual
ly present themselves to the
public but only receive feedback
from what is in the morning's
paper."
Exchange Between Artists and
Critics
"We feel that it would be
quite interesting to have public
exchange between exponents of
performing arts and critics."
The series, which began last
week with the appearance of

David Littlejohn of the Univer
sity of California, Dale Harris
of Stanford University, and Ani
ta Mostley, former managing
editor of the Arts magazine, will
try to answer such basic ques
tions as the function, use, and
relevance of criticism.
In its presentations such noted
Bay Area critics as John Was
serman, Stanley Eichelbaum,
Pain Knickerbocker, Alfred
Frankenstein of the San Fran
cisco Chronicle, and Rolfe Peter
son of the Oakland Tribune have
confirmed their appearances.
This week Paul Hertelendy of
the Oakland Tribune will give a
talk on musical criticism.
The purpose of the program,
is basically to achieve a more
cultural atmosphere for the
area. "That is what our series
has in mind. We want to create
a more dynamic area for the arts
to thrive," said Nielson.

demic dissecting approach we
find here."
Nielson said that the current
approach has been to study and

analyze rather than to peruse.
Art has become more art his
tory while music is more of a
course in musieology.
'There is a tremendous amount
of material here that needs to
be exposed but isn't. Our com
mittee as an organization seeks
to bring into the spotlight peo
ple who really have talent."
"This is an attempt to bring
together artists and critics and
to set up an interchange. It is a
rare opportunity. Artists usual
ly present themselves to the
public but only receive feedback
from what is in the morning's
paper."
Exchange Between Artists and
Critics
"We feel that it would be
quite interesting to have public
exchange between exponents of
performing arts and critics."
The series, which began last
week with the appearance of

David Littlejohn of the Univer
sity of California, Dale Harris
of Stanford University, and Ani
ta Mostley, former managing
editor of the Arts magazine, will
try to answer such basic ques
tions as the function, use, and
relevance of criticism.
In its presentations such noted
Bay Area critics as John Was
serman, Stanley Eichelbaum,
Pain Knickerbocker, Alfred
Frankenstein of the San Fran
cisco Chronicle, and Rolfe Peter
son of the Oakland Tribune have
confirmed their appearances.
This week Paul Hertelendy of
the Oakland Tribune will give a
talk on musical criticism.
The purpose of the program,
is basically to achieve a more
cultural atmosphere for the
area. "That is what our series
has in mind. We want to create
a more dynamic area for the arts
to thrive," said Nielson.
An innovation is taking place
at Stanford on Thursday eve
nings in Tresidder Memorial
Union's Large Lounge.
In the past the University has
taken an academic approach in
its position on such things as
the performing arts according
to Dean Nielson, Cultural Arts
Division Chairman at Tresidder.
Nielson has undertaken to do
something about it with the es
tablishment of a criticism lec
ture series, a program which
brings together Bay Area critics
in various fields every Thursday
night at 8 p.m.
"We want," said Nielson, "to
try through this to bring about
more of an open free creative
environment instead of an aca
demic dissecting approach we
find here."
