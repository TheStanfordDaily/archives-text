# Speaker Unruh
## A 						Different Liberal 
### DIARMUID McGUIRE 
What do you do with a guy
like Jesse Unruh?
He comes down here from
Sacramento where he spends his
days fiddling around with the
wing flaps and throttle pitch of
our society, leaves the cockpit of
California bourgeoisedom and
comes down with the usual lib
eral b.s. about how people should
listen to each other and then
flabergasts everybody by actual
ly listening.
He walks into Dink in his ir
ridescent green suit (Italian
cut), alligator shoes, emerald
and diamond cuff links, L.A.
backsweep haircut and tieclip
(albeit A Kennedy '60 PT boat
tie clip) and comes upon a sign
that says You, Jesse" (we
will leave that word "****" to
your feverish imaginations this
week) and, of all the lowdown
underhanded political tricks, re
fuses to consider it an insult.
Not only that but the scoun
drel asks for the sign so he can
take it home.
Old Ladies, Too
Most of the trappings of po
litical power are there: political
supplicants (Assembly candi
dates Gorfinkel, Vasconcellos

and Poche came to sit in the
leader's shadow), ivy league ad
vance men and old ladies who,
introduced, say "I'v heard ye on
tv quite a few times . .
But where is pomposity?
Riding back to the San Fran
cisco airport with the Speaker,
we found ourselves unable to
ask him why he was not more
pompous. We attempted to make
up for it by not addressing him
as "Mr. Speaker" (a couple

Analysis

"Sir's" slipped out, though) and
getting at him on Cleaver.
"My position has been that it
is all right for him to appear on
campus," Unruh says. "What I
object to is giving his academ
ic status. If he had gone through
with the course, for no credit,
and handled it successfully, the
Regents would have had to look
at it differently."
Political Sense
This made political sense to

us, but no emotional sense. How
long do you toady around with
your celluloid governor and his
pre-talky philosophy? But we
were talking to a politician, and
he was getting through to us.
We tried to depoliticize him.
"When you were talking to
the SDS kids after your speech,
you said in passing that you find
California's political prospects
rather depressing. Do you un
derstand the real despair that
most of us feel when we con
template Nixon and Humphrey
or one more day of Vietnam?"
"I think I understand it, and
share it in many ways. It's one
thing for those who have a few
bucks and are afraid that some
one is going to take it away,
and another when those who are
really concerned are turning
off . . ."
A politician who does not try
to explain away despair, who
talks of saying the hell with it
and going to Panama. Resorting
to some vaguely positive ques
tion, we heard him run through
a long speech about the good
things that could be done to
eliminate smog, train police in
perception and reason, provide
humane care for the mentally
ill, rationalize drug penalties.
Impossible Canyons
We examined the impossible
canyons and jagged angles of
the Speaker's face. There
seemed to be a kid in there
somewhere, a kid who remem

bered when that hint of a lisp
was the real thing.
We asked about the old image
—the cigar-chomping political
boss we half-remember as arch
foe of the good liberal Pat
Brown. He recalled old battles,
pointed out that most of the
"classical liberals" have either

disappeared or realized that
there are more effective tools
than open housing legislation
for rationalizing society.
"But the weight made a differ
ence, too," he said. "It's hard to
pin the Big Daddy label on me
now."
We chuckled in a reporterly
fashion, and realized that he had
not laughed. The Big Daddy
thing must have hurt.
"You know, the SDS people
make a lot of sense in their crit
icisms of society," he said. "But
it reminds me of a quote from
Camus that Kennedy often
used." He gave the quote about
all the starving children in the
world and how the best that one
can do is make sure that fewer
of them starve.
Which is logical, except that
many of them never have a
chance to starve because they
die from our napalm in Viet
nam.
But we knew that Unruh does
not like that any better than we
do. And that we knew that, poli
tics being what they are, he has
just about as much power to
stop it.

things that could be done to
eliminate smog, train police in
perception and reason, provide
humane care for the mentally
ill, rationalize drug penalties.
Impossible Canyons
We examined the impossible
canyons and jagged angles of
the Speaker's face. There
seemed to be a kid in there
somewhere, a kid who remem

bered when that hint of a lisp
was the real thing.
We asked about the old image
—the cigar-chomping political
boss we half-remember as arch
foe of the good liberal Pat
Brown. He recalled old battles,
pointed out that most of the
"classical liberals" have either

disappeared or realized that
there are more effective tools
than open housing legislation
for rationalizing society.
"But the weight made a differ
ence, too," he said. "It's hard to
pin the Big Daddy label on me
now."
We chuckled in a reporterly
fashion, and realized that he had
not laughed. The Big Daddy
thing must have hurt.
"You know, the SDS people
make a lot of sense in their crit
icisms of society," he said. "But
it reminds me of a quote from
Camus that Kennedy often
used." He gave the quote about
all the starving children in the
world and how the best that one
can do is make sure that fewer
of them starve.
Which is logical, except that
many of them never have a
chance to starve because they
die from our napalm in Viet
nam.
But we knew that Unruh does
not like that any better than we
do. And that we knew that, poli
tics being what they are, he has
just about as much power to
stop it.
What do you do with a guy
like Jesse Unruh?
He comes down here from
Sacramento where he spends his
days fiddling around with the
wing flaps and throttle pitch of
our society, leaves the cockpit of
California bourgeoisedom and
comes down with the usual lib
eral b.s. about how people should
listen to each other and then
flabergasts everybody by actual
ly listening.
He walks into Dink in his ir
ridescent green suit (Italian
cut), alligator shoes, emerald
and diamond cuff links, L.A.
backsweep haircut and tieclip
(albeit A Kennedy '60 PT boat
tie clip) and comes upon a sign
that says You, Jesse" (we
will leave that word "****" to
your feverish imaginations this
week) and, of all the lowdown
underhanded political tricks, re
fuses to consider it an insult.
Not only that but the scoun
drel asks for the sign so he can
take it home.
Old Ladies, Too
Most of the trappings of po
litical power are there: political
supplicants (Assembly candi
dates Gorfinkel, Vasconcellos

and Poche came to sit in the
leader's shadow), ivy league ad
vance men and old ladies who,
introduced, say "I'v heard ye on
tv quite a few times . .
But where is pomposity?
Riding back to the San Fran
cisco airport with the Speaker,
we found ourselves unable to
ask him why he was not more
pompous. We attempted to make
up for it by not addressing him
as "Mr. Speaker" (a couple

Analysis

"Sir's" slipped out, though) and
getting at him on Cleaver.
"My position has been that it
is all right for him to appear on
campus," Unruh says. "What I
object to is giving his academ
ic status. If he had gone through
with the course, for no credit,
and handled it successfully, the
Regents would have had to look
at it differently."
Political Sense
This made political sense to

us, but no emotional sense. How
long do you toady around with
your celluloid governor and his
pre-talky philosophy? But we
were talking to a politician, and
he was getting through to us.
We tried to depoliticize him.
"When you were talking to
the SDS kids after your speech,
you said in passing that you find
California's political prospects
rather depressing. Do you un
derstand the real despair that
most of us feel when we con
template Nixon and Humphrey
or one more day of Vietnam?"
"I think I understand it, and
share it in many ways. It's one
thing for those who have a few
bucks and are afraid that some
one is going to take it away,
and another when those who are
really concerned are turning
off . . ."
A politician who does not try
to explain away despair, who
talks of saying the hell with it
and going to Panama. Resorting
to some vaguely positive ques
tion, we heard him run through
a long speech about the good
things that could be done to
eliminate smog, train police in
perception and reason, provide
humane care for the mentally

we found ourselves unable to
ask him why he was not more
pompous. We attempted to make
up for it by not addressing him
as "Mr. Speaker" (a couple

Analysis

"Sir's" slipped out, though) and
getting at him on Cleaver.
"My position has been that it
is all right for him to appear on
campus," Unruh says. "What I
object to is giving his academ
ic status. If he had gone through
with the course, for no credit,
and handled it successfully, the
Regents would have had to look
at it differently."
Political Sense
This made political sense to

us, but no emotional sense. How
long do you toady around with
your celluloid governor and his
pre-talky philosophy? But we
were talking to a politician, and
he was getting through to us.
We tried to depoliticize him.
"When you were talking to
the SDS kids after your speech,
you said in passing that you find
California's political prospects
rather depressing. Do you un
derstand the real despair that
most of us feel when we con
template Nixon and Humphrey
or one more day of Vietnam?"
"I think I understand it, and
share it in many ways. It's one
thing for those who have a few
bucks and are afraid that some
one is going to take it away,
and another when those who are
really concerned are turning
off . . ."
A politician who does not try
to explain away despair, who
talks of saying the hell with it
and going to Panama. Resorting
to some vaguely positive ques
tion, we heard him run through
a long speech about the good
things that could be done to
eliminate smog, train police in
perception and reason, provide
humane care for the mentally
ill, rationalize drug penalties.
Impossible Canyons
We examined the impossible
canyons and jagged angles of
the Speaker's face. There
seemed to be a kid in there
somewhere, a kid who remem

bered when that hint of a lisp
was the real thing.
We asked about the old image
—the cigar-chomping political
boss we half-remember as arch
foe of the good liberal Pat
Brown. He recalled old battles,
pointed out that most of the
"classical liberals" have either

disappeared or realized that
there are more effective tools
than open housing legislation
for rationalizing society.
"But the weight made a differ
ence, too," he said. "It's hard to
pin the Big Daddy label on me
now."
We chuckled in a reporterly
fashion, and realized that he had
not laughed. The Big Daddy
thing must have hurt.
"You know, the SDS people
make a lot of sense in their crit
icisms of society," he said. "But
it reminds me of a quote from
Camus that Kennedy often
used." He gave the quote about
all the starving children in the
world and how the best that one
can do is make sure that fewer
of them starve.
Which is logical, except that
many of them never have a
chance to starve because they
die from our napalm in Viet
nam.
But we knew that Unruh does
not like that any better than we
do. And that we knew that, poli
tics being what they are, he has
just about as much power to
stop it.
What do you do with a guy
like Jesse Unruh?
He comes down here from
Sacramento where he spends his
days fiddling around with the
wing flaps and throttle pitch of
our society, leaves the cockpit of
California bourgeoisedom and
comes down with the usual lib
eral b.s. about how people should
listen to each other and then
flabergasts everybody by actual
ly listening.
He walks into Dink in his ir
ridescent green suit (Italian
cut), alligator shoes, emerald
and diamond cuff links, L.A.
backsweep haircut and tieclip
(albeit A Kennedy '60 PT boat
tie clip) and comes upon a sign
that says You, Jesse" (we
will leave that word "****" to
your feverish imaginations this
week) and, of all the lowdown
underhanded political tricks, re
fuses to consider it an insult.
Not only that but the scoun
drel asks for the sign so he can
take it home.
Old Ladies, Too
Most of the trappings of po
litical power are there: political
supplicants (Assembly candi
dates Gorfinkel, Vasconcellos

and Poche came to sit in the
leader's shadow), ivy league ad
vance men and old ladies who,
introduced, say "I'v heard ye on
tv quite a few times . .
But where is pomposity?
