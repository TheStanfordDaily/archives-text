# Cal Students Hold Building As Confrontation Develops
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
A Columbia-like confrontation
was developing late last night at
Berkeley as control of the cam
pus was reportedly turned over
to police to deal with students
occupying a campus Administra
tion building.
As The Daily went to press,
nearly 100 students were occupy
ing Moses Hall, protesting the
Board of Regents action against
Eldridge Cleaver and the arrest
of 120 students in Sproul Hall
Tuesday night.
It appeared likely that police
forces would move in to arrest
the sit-inners and disperse the
nearly 2,000 people gathered out
side.
The students inside the hall
voted down a resolution that
would have asked the demon
strators outside to remain non
violent.
The dissident students, led by
Peter Came jo who was suspend
ed last year for anti-administra
tion activities, have barricaded
themselves into the building
which houses the administrative
offices of the School of Letters
and Sciences.
They moved into the building
at 2:30 this afternoon after hold
ing sit-ins at both Dwinelle Hall,
which houses the Chancellor's
Office, and at Campbell Hall, the
computer center.
Meanwhile Republiean Sena
torial hopeful Max Rafferty had
some strong words for the dem
onstrators.
"I used to think the commu
nists didn't run these demon
strations . . . but now I think
they are."

He based this on a news re
lease from the U.S. Communist
party taking credit for running
some protests, and what he saw
as a total lack of protest by
student activists over the So
viet Union's invasion of Czech
oslovakia.
Rafferty also said the news
media aren't telling the full
story of campus demonstra
tions. "The papers won't tell
you, the tv news media won't
tell you, but I'm telling you . . .
you've got revolution on the
campuses."
At a series of meetings this
evening the sit-in group decided
to defend the barricades as long
as possible in case police move
in, but to engage in only self

defense after the police have
entered.
"The students occupying Mo
ses Hall have voted to avoid vio
lence and violent confrontation
with the police, and to attempt
to avoid property damage to
both the building and its con
tents," the group declared in a
statement released early this
evening.
At present the protestors are
waiting for the University or
the police to take some action.
Camejo said that the longer ac
tion is delayed and the longer
the students hold the building
the bigger the victory the occu
pation is.
"This becomes a symbol," he
said. "Every student in the coun

try will know about it. Right
now the issues (in the Cleaver
controversy) aren't clear. This
forces the issues out."
The group, supported by near
ly 500 students outside the hall,
has made four demands, stating
they will not consider leaving
the building before the demands
are met.
The demands are:
"Full credit for Social Anal
ysis 139 X (the course for which
Eldridge Cleaver was supposed
to deliver 10 lectures), amnesty
for the 120 students arrested
Tuesday evening and for those
students presently occupying
Moses Hall, that the regents re
scind their resolution of Septem
ber 20 which 'sanctioned their
arbitrary interference into the
structure and content of cour
ses,' and that the University ad
ministration meet the campus
union demands on minority ad
missions and hiring."
In the same statement the
group claimed the main issue in
the dispute is racism. "The Re
gents wish to prevent the ideas
of Eldridge Cleaver . . . from
reaching white students. The
Regents wish to keep white and
black from fighting togther; this
is racism."
"Likewise the Regents have a
racist hiring policy for campus
employees, and a racist admis
sions policy using the excuse
that black, brown and red peo
ple are not 'qualified'."
Threatened action against the
sit-inners included implementa
tion of the Wyman Amendment,
prohibiting giving federal funds
to students who disrupt the
functioning of the University.
