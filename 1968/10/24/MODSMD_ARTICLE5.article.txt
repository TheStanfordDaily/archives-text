# From Outside Sponsors
## $65 Million For Research 
### 
Expenditures for outside-spon
sored research, training, and
education programs at Stanford
topped the $65 million mark last
year, excluding the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC).
Of the 1600 research projects
performed, 16 involved classifi
cation, according to the defini
tion of this term used by the
University. Their total dollar
value was $3 million—compared
with $4 million for some two
dozen projects the preceding
year.
These highlights are drawn
from a new report on research
here, prepared under the super
vision of Provost Richard W.
Lyman and Prof. William Bax
ter, law chairman of the Aca
demic Council Committee on
Research Policy.
Now being circulated to all
Academic Council members, the
report summarizes existing pol
icies on research and relevant
data published in the Univers
ity's financial report and other
sources.
The new report notes that "all

sponsored projects which are
undertaken at Stanford with ex
ternal financial support begin
with faculty initiative. . . ."
"Proposals for research pro
jects are expected to be con
cerned with investigations
which promise to make an ap
plication of or a contribution to
fundamental knowledge.
"They also should provide an
education component through
the inclusion of opportunities
for students to be actively in
volved in the work in a way
which will hopefully lead to the
basis for a dissertation," as well
as financial support to students
for work they do on the project.
If a proposal involves the use
of human subjects, it is referred
to one of two standing commit
tees, established to insure that
the rights of the individuals in
volved are protected under the
Helsinki Declaration. One com
mittee covers research projects
involving medical patients, while
the other is concerned with psy
chological and sociological
studies.
During the past year, the fac

ulty developed 1,250 proposals to
90 different foundations and gov
ernment agencies in accord with
these procedures. Twenty of
these involved the possibility of
classification, of which 16 re
sulted in contracts or grants.
Stanford regards a research
proposal as classified if any one
researcher involved requires se
curity clearance from the fed
eral government, even though
findings of the project may be
public.
The report shows that two
government agencies—Defense
and the Public Health Service—
accounted for more than half
the total externally-sponsored

activities at the University dur
ing 1967-68.
By agency, the dollar expedi
tures last year were as follows:
Defense, $17,839,300; Public
Health Service, $16,646,200; Na
tional Science Foundation, $9,-
979,800; Office of Education,
$5,751,900; NASA, $5,724,000;
AEC, $524,000, excluding SLAC;
and other agencies (Interior,
Peace Corps, etc.), $2,439,000.
Support for SLAC totaled
$28,617,000.
Non - government agencies,
such as the Ford Foundation
and the American Cancer Soci
ety, provided a total of $6,466,-
000 for research, training and
education programs at Stanford.

here, prepared under the super
vision of Provost Richard W.
Lyman and Prof. William Bax
ter, law chairman of the Aca
demic Council Committee on
Research Policy.
Now being circulated to all
Academic Council members, the
report summarizes existing pol
icies on research and relevant
data published in the Univers
ity's financial report and other
sources.
The new report notes that "all

sponsored projects which are
undertaken at Stanford with ex
ternal financial support begin
with faculty initiative. . . ."
"Proposals for research pro
jects are expected to be con
cerned with investigations
which promise to make an ap
plication of or a contribution to
fundamental knowledge.
"They also should provide an
education component through
the inclusion of opportunities
for students to be actively in
volved in the work in a way
which will hopefully lead to the
basis for a dissertation," as well
as financial support to students
for work they do on the project.
If a proposal involves the use
of human subjects, it is referred
to one of two standing commit
tees, established to insure that
the rights of the individuals in
volved are protected under the
Helsinki Declaration. One com
mittee covers research projects
involving medical patients, while
the other is concerned with psy
chological and sociological
studies.
During the past year, the fac

ulty developed 1,250 proposals to
90 different foundations and gov
ernment agencies in accord with
these procedures. Twenty of
these involved the possibility of
classification, of which 16 re
sulted in contracts or grants.
Stanford regards a research
proposal as classified if any one
researcher involved requires se
curity clearance from the fed
eral government, even though
findings of the project may be
public.
The report shows that two
government agencies—Defense
and the Public Health Service—
accounted for more than half
the total externally-sponsored

activities at the University dur
ing 1967-68.
By agency, the dollar expedi
tures last year were as follows:
Defense, $17,839,300; Public
Health Service, $16,646,200; Na
tional Science Foundation, $9,-
979,800; Office of Education,
$5,751,900; NASA, $5,724,000;
AEC, $524,000, excluding SLAC;
and other agencies (Interior,
Peace Corps, etc.), $2,439,000.
Support for SLAC totaled
$28,617,000.
Non - government agencies,
such as the Ford Foundation
and the American Cancer Soci
ety, provided a total of $6,466,-
000 for research, training and
education programs at Stanford.

Expenditures for outside-spon
sored research, training, and
education programs at Stanford
topped the $65 million mark last
year, excluding the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC).
Of the 1600 research projects
performed, 16 involved classifi
cation, according to the defini
tion of this term used by the
University. Their total dollar
value was $3 million—compared
with $4 million for some two
dozen projects the preceding
year.
