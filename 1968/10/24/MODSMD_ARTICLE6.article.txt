# Unruh Attacks Cleaver Uproar
## 
### MARGARET McGAUGHEY 
Jesse Unruh, Speaker of the
California State Assembly, at
tacked senatorial candidate Max
Rafferty and Gov. Ronald Rea
gan for turning Eldridge Clea
ver's expulsion from the Univer
sity of California campuses into
the major issue of this year's
campaign.
In a speech before a capacity
audience in Dinkelspiel Audito
rium, the last in Unruh's month
long tour of fourteen university
campuses, the Speaker criticized
his Republican opponents for
consistently showing poor judg
ment in their emphasis on "mis
placed priorities" in this and
other issues.
Logically, he insisted, the
Cleaver issue should be deferred
until after the election. Four
seats on the UC Board of Re
gents are subject to the out
come of the election, and, Un
ruh felt, the decision should be
enforced by the men who made
it.
Even more significant, Unruh
said, was the fact that his Re
publican opponents had com
pletely by-passed such crucial
issues as Vietnam, the ghettos,
and poverty to settle on a "con
spiracy designed to inflame pub
lic passions over Cleaver even
if it means destroying the Uni
versity of California in the pro
cess."
He termed the emphasis on
Cleaver an all out effort "to sal
vage Max Rafferty's fading cam
paign," and said that this cam
paign was a covert referendum
on Reagan's own administration.
Unruh considered the academ
ic freedom to be crucial and
was, in general, sympathetic to

the more basic goals of the cur
rent demonstrations at UC San
ta Cruz and at Berkeley. Where
he disagreed with students was
when they brought into play
physical violence, destruction of
private property, or disruption
of the educational processes.
One of the primary snags in
the settlement of the university
problem Unruh saw as a lack of
communications.
Referring to the demonstra
tions at Santa Cruz, he said, "It's
a two-sided monologue. Some of
the people are screaming at the
Regents and the Regents are
screaming back at some of the
people."
Unruh felt that some of the
proposals of the Santa Cruz stu
dents were quite valuable. He
approved of the idea that a Mal
colm X College of black studies
be constructed on the campus.
But, he insisted, "this is some
thing we should have been
thinking about on the Regent
level."
Unruh felt that the "highly
explosive situation" on the UC
campuses attests to the fact that
"the university is no longer a
cloistered enclave which can
pick and choose when it wants
to be a part of the larger com
munity."
The problem must be solved,
he said, but it cannot be allowed
to overshadow larger issues. The
emphasis placed on Eldridge
Cleaver by Gov. Reagan and the
present Assembly in Sacramento
is indicative of an habitual mis
calculation of priorities.
For example, Unruh stated
that the California legislature is
again spending $2 million on
state fairs, yet insists it is too
expensive to spend the same
amount on a program to ui<l
young people in search of sum
mer employment. Similarly,
while spending $20 million on
agricultural research, the legis
lature refuses to increase old
age benefits, or education pro
grams.
"That's the kind of thing we
do in Sacramento which r ikes
us highly unbelievable outside
Sacramento."
Unruh ended his talk on a note
of optimism. On a national scale,
he said, certain changes have
come about which would have
seemed impossible a year ago.
"It is true that McCarthy
didn't win the nomination, but it
is also true that Lyndon John
son isn't running. Now it is not
considered unpatriotic to be
against the war in Vietnam."
Unruh considered this change
vital to the American system,
lie claimed an active part in
bringing it about, citing his role
in the credentials fights at the
Chicago convention as proof of
his concern.
"Recent years have produced
some young people who are free
of the economic fears that I faced
and who can be concerned with
something more than being
Number One. They want to
bring about change in the po
litical system. On that basis I
hope we can help each other."
