### BILL LELAND ALAN STRAIN 
The military Selective Service
Act recognizes that there are
moral aspects to participating
in the military. It acknowledges
that some men will find it a vio
lation of conscience to perform
combatant duty, and others, to
take any part whatsoever in the
military.
The present law, as previous
ones, places significant limita
tions on the nature of the objec
tions.
The law states that a man will
be recognized as a conscientious
objector if he is "by reason of
religious training and belief con
scientiously opposed to partici
pation in war in any form." At
first reading this seems to limit
such recognition to the man
who satisfies the conditions.

First, that he has grown up in
some recognized religious group
which explicitly teaches either
that men should not take part
in war or that they should not
take part in the military. Sec
ond, that as a result of his train
ing, he has become an absolute
pacifist. While some local boards
do interpret the law in this way,
this interpretation would dis
qualify many individuals who in
fact have been recognized as
conscientious objectors.
In clarifying the meaning of
"religious training and belief"
a federal court ruled that "so
far as Congress was thinking of
training, it regarded it as mean
ing no more than individual ex
perience supporting belief; a
mere background against which
sincerity could be tested." The
Central Committee for Consci

entious Objectors advises "Reli
gious training and belief should
be viewed as a single concept
with emphasis clearly on belief.
(It) includes any belief, ortho
dox or unorthodox. Beliefs
which are religious at their root
are covered by the law."
Further clarification came in
1965 when the Supreme Court
found humanist Dan Seeger en
titled to recognition as a con
scientious objector. The court
held that "the test of belief in
relation to a Supreme Being is
whether a given belief that is
sincere and meaningful occupies
a place in the life of its posses
sor parallel to that filled by the
orthodox belief in God of one
who clearly qualifies for the ex
emption." While all reference to
belief in a Supreme Being has
now been eliminated from both
the law and the recently revised
Selective Service form for con
scientious objectors, the Seeger
decision still serves to broaden
the range of beliefs which are
acceptable as a basis for con
scientious objection.
