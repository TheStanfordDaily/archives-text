# BERKELEY OCT. 22 BONFIRE THAT FIZZLE
## 
### DANIEL SNELL 
The Loft at Berkeley is not
as it was.
The cohesion of sentiment
that welled up in 1964 around
the issue of free speech was
nowhere in sight Tuesday as a
crowd grew outside the sit-in at
Sproul Hall protesting the He
gent's refusal of credit to Social
Analysis 139 X, in which Black
Panther Eldridge Cleaver is a
guest lecturer.
Some students were talking
confidently of a "militant pos
ture" with which to meet the
expected paddy wagons. Anoth
er group proposed taking
another building, but this idea
was ignored.
No votes were taken, no lead
ers emerged. You voted with
your body, whether you stayed
or not.
And the police, in a bit of
stupidity that wasted a couple
of hours, thought they could
bring in the big yellow Alameda
County Department of Trans
portation buses with only 12
officers leading the way. Mem
bers of the crowd, however, let
air out of the buses' tires as
they were executing a turn, and
the buses were sent away.
Creative Tactic
The tire-puncturing was about
the most creative tactic exe
cuted that night. Some people
built a bonfire in the street at

Telegraph and Bancroft, in front
of the campus, using local trash
cans for fuel. And as the crowd
swelled, to what the Associated
Press described as 2000 and
what I describe as KMX), the
flames shot up into the night
sky
Hut the police were eminently
in control, in spite of minor
blunders.
A row of reinforced Alameda
County Sheriff's Deputies moved
forward from Sproul Hall, and
the crowd backed off in near
panic, some cooler heads chant
ing, "Walk, Walk." But the
policemen had not so much as
touched a demonstrator; the
crowd was fleeing from the
thought.
The gutsy people, the ones
who had been talking earlier
about throwing themselves
around the pc!;je buses, seemed
to be stoking the bonefire. And
the more timid manned the line
between the crowd and police.
Only the sit-inners them
selves, locked in the building
for hours, were irrevocably in
volved. They finally emerged
making V-signs with their fin
gers and romping to the buses.
The crowd cheered, but even
tually dwindled away.
An element of incohesion is
the splintering of the leftist
groups at Berkeley, none of
whom seem to be willing to co

operate with each other any
more.
Tendencies
But there are definite tenden
cies towards unity at Berkeley.
The demonstration failed to co
alesce for lack of a public ad
dress system and for lack of a
leader.
The question of personal lead
ership is heresy to many left
ists; they point at the personal
leadership of Lyndon Johnson
and the possibilities of demo
goguery available in any demon
stration. They prefer to be lead
erless. And I concur with them
in their fears.
But people need someone, per
haps not an ideologist, but rath
er a moderator for mass dis
cussions, someone committed to
action but open to suggestions.
And though a few radicals tried
to cut such a figure, other fac
tions yelled them down. All we
had left was incoherent unen
thusiasm through the autumn
night.
If the New Left really means
what it says—and it seems to
me that it has a right to mean
it— it has got to learn to rely
on cohesive organization, not
centered either on personality
or ideology but on the tenden
cies toward personal freedom
from corporate oppression that
can be agreed on.

selves, locked in the building
for hours, were irrevocably in
volved. They finally emerged
making V-signs with their fin
gers and romping to the buses.
The crowd cheered, but even
tually dwindled away.
An element of incohesion is
the splintering of the leftist
groups at Berkeley, none of
whom seem to be willing to co

operate with each other any
more.
Tendencies
But there are definite tenden
cies towards unity at Berkeley.
The demonstration failed to co
alesce for lack of a public ad
dress system and for lack of a
leader.
The question of personal lead
ership is heresy to many left
ists; they point at the personal
leadership of Lyndon Johnson
and the possibilities of demo
goguery available in any demon
stration. They prefer to be lead
erless. And I concur with them
in their fears.
But people need someone, per
haps not an ideologist, but rath
er a moderator for mass dis
cussions, someone committed to
action but open to suggestions.
And though a few radicals tried
to cut such a figure, other fac
tions yelled them down. All we
had left was incoherent unen
thusiasm through the autumn
night.
If the New Left really means
what it says—and it seems to
me that it has a right to mean
it— it has got to learn to rely
on cohesive organization, not
centered either on personality
or ideology but on the tenden
cies toward personal freedom
from corporate oppression that
can be agreed on.
The Loft at Berkeley is not
as it was.
The cohesion of sentiment
that welled up in 1964 around
the issue of free speech was
nowhere in sight Tuesday as a
crowd grew outside the sit-in at
Sproul Hall protesting the He
gent's refusal of credit to Social
Analysis 139 X, in which Black
Panther Eldridge Cleaver is a
guest lecturer.
Some students were talking
confidently of a "militant pos
ture" with which to meet the
expected paddy wagons. Anoth
er group proposed taking
another building, but this idea
was ignored.
No votes were taken, no lead
ers emerged. You voted with
your body, whether you stayed
or not.
And the police, in a bit of
stupidity that wasted a couple
of hours, thought they could
bring in the big yellow Alameda
County Department of Trans
portation buses with only 12
officers leading the way. Mem
bers of the crowd, however, let
air out of the buses' tires as
they were executing a turn, and
the buses were sent away.
Creative Tactic
The tire-puncturing was about
the most creative tactic exe
cuted that night. Some people
built a bonfire in the street at

Telegraph and Bancroft, in front
of the campus, using local trash
cans for fuel. And as the crowd
swelled, to what the Associated
Press described as 2000 and
what I describe as KMX), the
flames shot up into the night
sky
Hut the police were eminently
in control, in spite of minor
blunders.
A row of reinforced Alameda
County Sheriff's Deputies moved
forward from Sproul Hall, and
the crowd backed off in near
panic, some cooler heads chant
ing, "Walk, Walk." But the
policemen had not so much as
touched a demonstrator; the
crowd was fleeing from the
thought.
The gutsy people, the ones
who had been talking earlier
about throwing themselves
around the pc!;je buses, seemed
to be stoking the bonefire. And
the more timid manned the line
between the crowd and police.
Only the sit-inners them
selves, locked in the building
for hours, were irrevocably in
volved. They finally emerged
making V-signs with their fin
gers and romping to the buses.
