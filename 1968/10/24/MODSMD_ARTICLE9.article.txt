## The 						Low-Down On Onassis 
### 
On Nov. 14, 1963, this column
carried a news item regarding
the ambition of Greek ship
owner Aristotle Onassis "to be
the brother-in-law of President
Kennedy."
Eight days later President
Kennedy was dead, and now five
years later Onassis has become
the husband of President Ken
nedy's widow.
Prior to this, during the fatal
fall of 1963, Jacqueline Kennedy
had gone to Greece for a cruise
on the ornate Onassis yacht to
dissuade her sister, Princess Lee
Radziwill, from marrying Onas
sis. She had returned from
Greece only a short time before
the tragedy of Dallas.
There were several reasons
why President Kennedy was not
enthusiastic about having his
sister-in-law marry the big,
brusque shipowner, one of them
being the fact that Onassis had
been embroiled in a passionate
love affair with Maria Callas,
the Greek opera singer. When
she was discovered on the Onas
sis yacht, Onassis had made the
remark: "I'm a sailor, and a

sailor has a girl in every port."
The romance with Madame
Callas had got nowhere, partly
because her Italian husband had
refused to give her a divorce.
So Onassis turned his affections
to Princess Radziwill.
Lee Radziwill had been on the
Onassis yacht most of the sum
mer when Jackie joined her in
the late summer of 1963 for a
cruise through the Aegean. On
the yacht at the time was Jon
Agnelli, head of the Italian Fiat
motor empire and Jackie's
escort on previous Mediterran
ean cruises—a fact which had
caused comment in the
European press and consider
able eyebrow lifting among the
jet set in Nice and Rome.
There were other reasons why
President Kennedy could not
have been enthusiastic about
having Onassis as a brother-in
law. He had once been crim
inally indicted by the Justice De
partment for deceiving the Un
ited States with a phony ship
ping deal and had paid the Un
ited States $7 million in settle
ment.

Furthermore, Onassis had
made much of his vast shipping
fortune at the expense of the
United States.
A former stevedore who mar
ried the daughter of Stavros G.
Livanos, one of the great ship
ping tycoons of Greece, Onassis
got his start first from his
father-in-law, second from buy
ing up surplus American ships
after the war.
A kindly Uncle Sam with too
many ships on his hands wanted
to rehabilitate the merchant
marine of European nations and
as a result Greek merchants
bought 98 liberty ships for a
paltry down payment of $21,780
per ship plus a Greek govern
ment loan guarantee and Greek
certificates extended under the
Marshall Plan.
Greek shippers did not carry
Marshall Plan goods to Greece
free, as did French, and Italian
government steamers. On the
contrary, some of the ships pur
chased privately from the
United States were transferred
to Panamanian, Liberian or
Honduran registry. They paid

almost no taxes in Greece, and
as Greek citizens with income
from Panama or Liberia, they
were not required to pay taxes
in the United States.
Onassis has come a long way
from the young Greek refugee
who in 1922 barely escaped from
Smyrna with his life. The Greek
population of Smyrna laced the
alternative of being butchered
by the Turkish army or throw
ing themselves into the sea.
Onassis's father was killed, but
he and his mother and sisters
were picked up by relief boats
in Smyrna harbor as the city
burned behind them.
He became a small fisherman,
operated his own schooner and
gradually rose to be one of the
most powerful businessmen in
Greece, as well as the owner of
the Olympic Airways.
It was former Prime Minister
Constantine Caramanlis who put
Onassis in the airplane business
by giving him a government
monopoly. Later when Cara
manlis learned that Onassis was
supporting his political opposi
tion, Caramanlis seized the big
shipowner by his coat lapels and
exclaimed: "I hear you are sup
porting the opposition after all
the things I have done for you."
Onassis's reply, now famous
in Athens, was, "Take your
hands off the lapels of my coat.
I started as a stevedore, and my
arms are strong enough to re
duce you to ashes."

nedy's widow.
Prior to this, during the fatal
fall of 1963, Jacqueline Kennedy
had gone to Greece for a cruise
on the ornate Onassis yacht to
dissuade her sister, Princess Lee
Radziwill, from marrying Onas
sis. She had returned from
Greece only a short time before
the tragedy of Dallas.
There were several reasons
why President Kennedy was not
enthusiastic about having his
sister-in-law marry the big,
brusque shipowner, one of them
being the fact that Onassis had
been embroiled in a passionate
love affair with Maria Callas,
the Greek opera singer. When
she was discovered on the Onas
sis yacht, Onassis had made the
remark: "I'm a sailor, and a

sailor has a girl in every port."
The romance with Madame
Callas had got nowhere, partly
because her Italian husband had
refused to give her a divorce.
So Onassis turned his affections
to Princess Radziwill.
Lee Radziwill had been on the
Onassis yacht most of the sum
mer when Jackie joined her in
the late summer of 1963 for a
cruise through the Aegean. On
the yacht at the time was Jon
Agnelli, head of the Italian Fiat
motor empire and Jackie's
escort on previous Mediterran
ean cruises—a fact which had
caused comment in the
European press and consider
able eyebrow lifting among the
jet set in Nice and Rome.
There were other reasons why
President Kennedy could not
have been enthusiastic about
having Onassis as a brother-in
law. He had once been crim
inally indicted by the Justice De
partment for deceiving the Un
ited States with a phony ship
ping deal and had paid the Un
ited States $7 million in settle
ment.

Furthermore, Onassis had
made much of his vast shipping
fortune at the expense of the
United States.
A former stevedore who mar
ried the daughter of Stavros G.
Livanos, one of the great ship
ping tycoons of Greece, Onassis
got his start first from his
father-in-law, second from buy
ing up surplus American ships
after the war.
A kindly Uncle Sam with too
many ships on his hands wanted
to rehabilitate the merchant
marine of European nations and
as a result Greek merchants
bought 98 liberty ships for a
paltry down payment of $21,780
per ship plus a Greek govern
ment loan guarantee and Greek
certificates extended under the
Marshall Plan.
Greek shippers did not carry
Marshall Plan goods to Greece
free, as did French, and Italian
government steamers. On the
contrary, some of the ships pur
chased privately from the
United States were transferred
to Panamanian, Liberian or
Honduran registry. They paid

almost no taxes in Greece, and
as Greek citizens with income
from Panama or Liberia, they
were not required to pay taxes
in the United States.
Onassis has come a long way
from the young Greek refugee
who in 1922 barely escaped from
Smyrna with his life. The Greek
population of Smyrna laced the
alternative of being butchered
by the Turkish army or throw
ing themselves into the sea.
Onassis's father was killed, but
he and his mother and sisters
were picked up by relief boats
in Smyrna harbor as the city
burned behind them.
He became a small fisherman,
operated his own schooner and
gradually rose to be one of the
most powerful businessmen in
Greece, as well as the owner of
the Olympic Airways.
It was former Prime Minister
Constantine Caramanlis who put
Onassis in the airplane business
by giving him a government
monopoly. Later when Cara
manlis learned that Onassis was
supporting his political opposi
tion, Caramanlis seized the big
shipowner by his coat lapels and
exclaimed: "I hear you are sup
porting the opposition after all
the things I have done for you."
Onassis's reply, now famous
in Athens, was, "Take your
hands off the lapels of my coat.
I started as a stevedore, and my
arms are strong enough to re
duce you to ashes."
On Nov. 14, 1963, this column
carried a news item regarding
the ambition of Greek ship
owner Aristotle Onassis "to be
the brother-in-law of President
Kennedy."

why President Kennedy was not
enthusiastic about having his
sister-in-law marry the big,
brusque shipowner, one of them
being the fact that Onassis had
been embroiled in a passionate
love affair with Maria Callas,
the Greek opera singer. When
she was discovered on the Onas
sis yacht, Onassis had made the
remark: "I'm a sailor, and a

sailor has a girl in every port."
The romance with Madame
Callas had got nowhere, partly
because her Italian husband had
refused to give her a divorce.
So Onassis turned his affections
to Princess Radziwill.
Lee Radziwill had been on the
Onassis yacht most of the sum
mer when Jackie joined her in
the late summer of 1963 for a
cruise through the Aegean. On
the yacht at the time was Jon
Agnelli, head of the Italian Fiat
motor empire and Jackie's
escort on previous Mediterran
ean cruises—a fact which had
caused comment in the
European press and consider
able eyebrow lifting among the
jet set in Nice and Rome.
There were other reasons why
President Kennedy could not
have been enthusiastic about
having Onassis as a brother-in
law. He had once been crim
inally indicted by the Justice De
partment for deceiving the Un
ited States with a phony ship
ping deal and had paid the Un
ited States $7 million in settle
ment.

Furthermore, Onassis had
made much of his vast shipping
fortune at the expense of the
United States.
A former stevedore who mar
ried the daughter of Stavros G.
Livanos, one of the great ship
ping tycoons of Greece, Onassis
got his start first from his
father-in-law, second from buy
ing up surplus American ships
after the war.
A kindly Uncle Sam with too
many ships on his hands wanted
to rehabilitate the merchant
marine of European nations and
as a result Greek merchants
bought 98 liberty ships for a
paltry down payment of $21,780
per ship plus a Greek govern
ment loan guarantee and Greek
certificates extended under the
Marshall Plan.
Greek shippers did not carry
Marshall Plan goods to Greece
free, as did French, and Italian
government steamers. On the
contrary, some of the ships pur
chased privately from the
United States were transferred
to Panamanian, Liberian or
Honduran registry. They paid

almost no taxes in Greece, and
as Greek citizens with income
from Panama or Liberia, they
were not required to pay taxes
in the United States.
Onassis has come a long way
from the young Greek refugee
who in 1922 barely escaped from
Smyrna with his life. The Greek
population of Smyrna laced the
alternative of being butchered
by the Turkish army or throw
ing themselves into the sea.
Onassis's father was killed, but
he and his mother and sisters
were picked up by relief boats
in Smyrna harbor as the city
burned behind them.
He became a small fisherman,
operated his own schooner and
gradually rose to be one of the
most powerful businessmen in
Greece, as well as the owner of
the Olympic Airways.
It was former Prime Minister
Constantine Caramanlis who put
Onassis in the airplane business
by giving him a government
monopoly. Later when Cara
manlis learned that Onassis was
supporting his political opposi
tion, Caramanlis seized the big
shipowner by his coat lapels and
exclaimed: "I hear you are sup
porting the opposition after all
the things I have done for you."
Onassis's reply, now famous
in Athens, was, "Take your
hands off the lapels of my coat.
I started as a stevedore, and my
arms are strong enough to re
duce you to ashes."
