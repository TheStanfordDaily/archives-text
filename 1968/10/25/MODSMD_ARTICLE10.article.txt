# Stegner's lively things
## 
### Adrienne Harris ALL THE LITTLE LIVE THINGS by Wallace Stegner 
Because attempts to grapple with such
traditional literary pairs as Life and Death
or Good and Evil so often result in embar
rassing cliches, it is exciting to discover in
Wallace Stegner's latest book a microcosm
of subtle conflict and simple growth rather
than contrived shuttlings between overly
delineated realms of Good and Evil or mas
sive statements of "What Life Is All
About." No bellows of blatant allegory
pound the reader's consciousness, for

All The Little Live Things by Wallace
Stegner.
Viking Press 1967 $5.75 345 pp.
Also in New American Library
paperback

Stegner refuses to exploit his intimate rap
port witb nature by forcing symbols or
human analogies.
The dirty, arrogant hippie Jim Peek
could easily have slipped into the embodi
ment of evil, and the doomed Marian, with
her passionate but fragile tie to life, could
just as easily have personified all that is
good, but through the profoundly human
eye of a sixty-four-year-old narrator, no
symbols are necessary. Meanings grow in
the human context of conflicting values
and finally hover in uncertainty in the ex
quisite and cruel climax which is a moving
refusal to understand death.
Good and evil are equally present in
Paradise. "1 am a Manichee," insists narra
tor Joseph Allston, thereby preventing ru
ral California from being a safe refuge from
ugly memories of a rebellious son who died
a surfing bum. A hippie intrudes into his
refuge and Allston can neither turn him

away nor accept him. Through his respon
ses to the hippie, Allston becomes to the
"over thirty" group what Salinger's Holden
Caulfield has become to alienated youth,
an often irrational and unaccepting but
touchingly real spokesman.
Enter Marian who staunchly insists,
"There isn't good life and bad life, there
only life," while facing her own imminei
death. Even more threatening to Allston
because of the fatherly devotion she in
spires, she pushes him farther toward the
acceptance of pain: "Love, not sin, costs us
Eden. Love is a carrier of death--the only
thing, in fact, that makes death signifi
cant." But what is that significance? The
book skilfully poses the problem but under
Stegner's subtle control refuses weighty
ponderings.
If there is any philosophizing, it is in
herent in the life process which Stegner is
particularly adept at portraying. His style
bypasses Wordsworthian raptures in favor
of a more earthy eloquence which often
hints at the violence inherent in nature, a
violence reverberating in human actions.
Some of the most moving passages in the
book are those describing events in nature:
the effect of the images evoked is almost
physical, often humorous, frequently poig
nant, and never dull. Man often emerges a
brute as he rips into the side of a hill with a
bulldozer, kills gophers, or stabs a snake
with a pitchfork.
The human events which mirror such
deaths of "little live things" are what
Stegner is quietly writing about, all the
more effectively because of the absence of
fanfare. The emotional energy the author
increasingly demands throughout the book
and fully controls in the absorbing climax
can move the reader to agree with Allston
that lie is "richer . . . for this sorrow."

book skilfully poses the problem but under
Stegner's subtle control refuses weighty
ponderings.
If there is any philosophizing, it is in
herent in the life process which Stegner is
particularly adept at portraying. His style
bypasses Wordsworthian raptures in favor
of a more earthy eloquence which often
hints at the violence inherent in nature, a
violence reverberating in human actions.
Some of the most moving passages in the
book are those describing events in nature:
the effect of the images evoked is almost
physical, often humorous, frequently poig
nant, and never dull. Man often emerges a
brute as he rips into the side of a hill with a
bulldozer, kills gophers, or stabs a snake
with a pitchfork.
The human events which mirror such
deaths of "little live things" are what
Stegner is quietly writing about, all the
more effectively because of the absence of
fanfare. The emotional energy the author
increasingly demands throughout the book
and fully controls in the absorbing climax
can move the reader to agree with Allston
that lie is "richer . . . for this sorrow."

ADRIENNE HARRIS is a senior in political
science.
Because attempts to grapple with such
traditional literary pairs as Life and Death
or Good and Evil so often result in embar
rassing cliches, it is exciting to discover in
Wallace Stegner's latest book a microcosm
of subtle conflict and simple growth rather
than contrived shuttlings between overly
delineated realms of Good and Evil or mas
sive statements of "What Life Is All
About." No bellows of blatant allegory
pound the reader's consciousness, for

All The Little Live Things by Wallace
Stegner.
Viking Press 1967 $5.75 345 pp.
Also in New American Library
paperback

Stegner refuses to exploit his intimate rap
port witb nature by forcing symbols or
human analogies.
The dirty, arrogant hippie Jim Peek
could easily have slipped into the embodi
ment of evil, and the doomed Marian, with
her passionate but fragile tie to life, could
just as easily have personified all that is
good, but through the profoundly human
eye of a sixty-four-year-old narrator, no
symbols are necessary. Meanings grow in
the human context of conflicting values
and finally hover in uncertainty in the ex
quisite and cruel climax which is a moving
refusal to understand death.
Good and evil are equally present in
Paradise. "1 am a Manichee," insists narra
tor Joseph Allston, thereby preventing ru
ral California from being a safe refuge from
ugly memories of a rebellious son who died
a surfing bum. A hippie intrudes into his
refuge and Allston can neither turn him

away nor accept him. Through his respon
ses to the hippie, Allston becomes to the
"over thirty" group what Salinger's Holden
Caulfield has become to alienated youth,
an often irrational and unaccepting but
touchingly real spokesman.
Enter Marian who staunchly insists,
"There isn't good life and bad life, there
only life," while facing her own imminei
death. Even more threatening to Allston
because of the fatherly devotion she in
spires, she pushes him farther toward the
acceptance of pain: "Love, not sin, costs us
Eden. Love is a carrier of death--the only
thing, in fact, that makes death signifi
cant." But what is that significance? The
book skilfully poses the problem but under
