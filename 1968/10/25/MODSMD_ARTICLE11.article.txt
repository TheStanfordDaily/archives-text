# passion & protest

### Gary A. Patton 
PATTON is a student in the Law School.

"I initiated the conversations' witli
some few opinions of my own which, to
indulge an oxymoron, I held with a
measure of passion." A very measured pas
sion indeed! Finn and the contributors
have ladled out passionate life into this
book by coffee spoons-and what passion is
remaining here is to white, refined and
sweet it seems to have disappeared inside
the recipe. What the book tastes of is pithy,
that is to say juiceless, sugarless discussions,
objective and objectionable.
Finn is the editor of Worldview, and
Director of Publications for the Council on
Religion and International Affairs: it would
seem thus, that Finn is a "religious journal-

ist" (and I suppose that in this day one
ought not to wonder at the adhesive power
of inconsistency). The fact that Finn is as
sociated with organized religion accounts
for his bow toward passion, suggesting the
Cross, and sacrifice, prophetic ardor at the
least—but that he is a journalist, a "report
er," explains why Finn would venture out
"to provide a topography of contemporary
protest," and how he can see that as "an
emotionally neutral undertaking."
It is perhaps not well-recognized how
diseased we are with all the journalistic vir
tues, specifically "objectivity," or how in
fected we are in our own souls with
"opinion." But for those acute to moral
pathology, this book is enraging: the
doctor summoned, he comes not to save,
but to salve us with the sight of his own
sores. Finn records here, by verbatim trans
cript and paraphrase, conversations with
some 38 people, each one of whom is in
some way notorious within the peace
movement. Once of twice, or five times is
discovered a measure of the personal, the
subjective, the genuine-some word from
the heart. For the rest of it, it is the same
stuff we read in the newspapers; and isn't
tha«t what's made us sick?
William V. O'Brien, who is the Presi

dent of the Catholic Association for Inter
national Peace, has this to tell use: "I know
that torture is a universal practice in all
such wars. Everybody does it . . . After all
what is torture? . . . One could probably, if
he confronted the thing honestly, list some
broad outlines for types of torture which in
terms of the reason, the cause and the re
sults would be considered to be, if
unpleasant, morally defensible." This sort
of "view on war and nonviolence" is obvi
ously not surprising to Finn; Finn himself
finds it "difficult to conceive of any war,
certainly the limited wars that are most
likely in modern times, taking place with
out the torture of individual prisoners who
are captured."
Well, what is revolting about this is
not only the barbarism of it; it is not even
mainly the deception that labels such
opinions "views on . . . nonviolence." What
is truly sickening about this is the objectiv
ity and impersonality of these remarks.
There is no need to tell us that "everybody
does it." This we know. There is no pur
pose in informing us that "one could
, probably list some outlines." This we realize
is within the realm of the possible-but
why have you not done it, Mr. William V.
O'Brien? If you wish to speak of these
things, why haven't you thought- about
them; why haven't you pondered them?
Or, if you have indeed pondered them, and
searched your soul, then why not tell us
what you think? This is not even an opin
ion you give to us-you can see that. This is
a statement that an opinion is possible!
(And yet one feels that Mr. O'Brien does
justify torture, if vaguely, if without really
confronting the question. He never says so.
This is hardly passion. This is a dishonesty
so fundamental and radical that it has in
fected the very core of his person: he has
lost grip on himself; he does not really
know what he thinks, and therefore doesn't
really think at all. This in fact is the very
sickness of our time: *ve are not honest
with ourselves, and our dishonesty has in
fected even what we do; it is virulent).
It is possible for each of us, as moral
beings, to decide what we will do. To speak
about these decisions, and to give reasons
for them, is necessarily to speak personally,
and it is to speak to others in a way
that can aid them in confronting them
selves. There is value in that. There is little
value in description: we can all see with our
own eyes what is going on around us, and it
is not really that, ultimately, that concerns
us most. Since Finn's book is description
and is dispassionate, in fact-it need not
concern the serious.

William V. O'Brien, who is the Presi

dent of the Catholic Association for Inter
national Peace, has this to tell use: "I know
that torture is a universal practice in all
such wars. Everybody does it . . . After all
what is torture? . . . One could probably, if
he confronted the thing honestly, list some
broad outlines for types of torture which in
terms of the reason, the cause and the re
sults would be considered to be, if
unpleasant, morally defensible." This sort
of "view on war and nonviolence" is obvi
ously not surprising to Finn; Finn himself
finds it "difficult to conceive of any war,
certainly the limited wars that are most
likely in modern times, taking place with
out the torture of individual prisoners who
are captured."
Well, what is revolting about this is
not only the barbarism of it; it is not even
mainly the deception that labels such
opinions "views on . . . nonviolence." What
is truly sickening about this is the objectiv
ity and impersonality of these remarks.
There is no need to tell us that "everybody
does it." This we know. There is no pur
pose in informing us that "one could
, probably list some outlines." This we realize
is within the realm of the possible-but
why have you not done it, Mr. William V.
O'Brien? If you wish to speak of these
things, why haven't you thought- about
them; why haven't you pondered them?
Or, if you have indeed pondered them, and
searched your soul, then why not tell us
what you think? This is not even an opin
ion you give to us-you can see that. This is
a statement that an opinion is possible!
(And yet one feels that Mr. O'Brien does
justify torture, if vaguely, if without really
confronting the question. He never says so.
This is hardly passion. This is a dishonesty
so fundamental and radical that it has in
fected the very core of his person: he has
lost grip on himself; he does not really
know what he thinks, and therefore doesn't
really think at all. This in fact is the very
sickness of our time: *ve are not honest
with ourselves, and our dishonesty has in
fected even what we do; it is virulent).
It is possible for each of us, as moral
beings, to decide what we will do. To speak
about these decisions, and to give reasons
for them, is necessarily to speak personally,
and it is to speak to others in a way
that can aid them in confronting them
selves. There is value in that. There is little
value in description: we can all see with our
own eyes what is going on around us, and it
is not really that, ultimately, that concerns
us most. Since Finn's book is description
and is dispassionate, in fact-it need not
concern the serious.
PATTON is a student in the Law School.

"I initiated the conversations' witli
some few opinions of my own which, to
indulge an oxymoron, I held with a
measure of passion." A very measured pas
sion indeed! Finn and the contributors
have ladled out passionate life into this
book by coffee spoons-and what passion is
remaining here is to white, refined and
sweet it seems to have disappeared inside
the recipe. What the book tastes of is pithy,
that is to say juiceless, sugarless discussions,
objective and objectionable.
Finn is the editor of Worldview, and
Director of Publications for the Council on
Religion and International Affairs: it would
seem thus, that Finn is a "religious journal-

ist" (and I suppose that in this day one
ought not to wonder at the adhesive power
of inconsistency). The fact that Finn is as
sociated with organized religion accounts
for his bow toward passion, suggesting the
Cross, and sacrifice, prophetic ardor at the
least—but that he is a journalist, a "report
er," explains why Finn would venture out
"to provide a topography of contemporary
protest," and how he can see that as "an
emotionally neutral undertaking."
It is perhaps not well-recognized how
diseased we are with all the journalistic vir
tues, specifically "objectivity," or how in
fected we are in our own souls with
"opinion." But for those acute to moral
pathology, this book is enraging: the
doctor summoned, he comes not to save,
but to salve us with the sight of his own
sores. Finn records here, by verbatim trans
cript and paraphrase, conversations with
some 38 people, each one of whom is in
some way notorious within the peace
movement. Once of twice, or five times is
discovered a measure of the personal, the
subjective, the genuine-some word from
the heart. For the rest of it, it is the same
stuff we read in the newspapers; and isn't

with ourselves, and our dishonesty has in

It is possible for each of us, as moral
beings, to decide what we will do. To speak
about these decisions, and to give reasons
for them, is necessarily to speak personally,
and it is to speak to others in a way
that can aid them in confronting them
selves. There is value in that. There is little
value in description: we can all see with our
own eyes what is going on around us, and it
is not really that, ultimately, that concerns
us most. Since Finn's book is description
and is dispassionate, in fact-it need not
concern the serious.

"I initiated the conversations' witli
some few opinions of my own which, to
indulge an oxymoron, I held with a
measure of passion." A very measured pas
sion indeed! Finn and the contributors
have ladled out passionate life into this
book by coffee spoons-and what passion is
remaining here is to white, refined and
sweet it seems to have disappeared inside
the recipe. What the book tastes of is pithy,
that is to say juiceless, sugarless discussions,
objective and objectionable.

Religion and International Affairs: it would

ist" (and I suppose that in this day one
ought not to wonder at the adhesive power
of inconsistency). The fact that Finn is as
sociated with organized religion accounts
for his bow toward passion, suggesting the
Cross, and sacrifice, prophetic ardor at the
least—but that he is a journalist, a "report
er," explains why Finn would venture out
"to provide a topography of contemporary
protest," and how he can see that as "an
emotionally neutral undertaking."
It is perhaps not well-recognized how
diseased we are with all the journalistic vir
tues, specifically "objectivity," or how in
fected we are in our own souls with
"opinion." But for those acute to moral
pathology, this book is enraging: the
doctor summoned, he comes not to save,
but to salve us with the sight of his own
sores. Finn records here, by verbatim trans
cript and paraphrase, conversations with
some 38 people, each one of whom is in
some way notorious within the peace
movement. Once of twice, or five times is
discovered a measure of the personal, the
subjective, the genuine-some word from
the heart. For the rest of it, it is the same
stuff we read in the newspapers; and isn't
tha«t what's made us sick?
William V. O'Brien, who is the Presi

dent of the Catholic Association for Inter
national Peace, has this to tell use: "I know
that torture is a universal practice in all
such wars. Everybody does it . . . After all
what is torture? . . . One could probably, if
he confronted the thing honestly, list some
broad outlines for types of torture which in
terms of the reason, the cause and the re
sults would be considered to be, if
unpleasant, morally defensible." This sort
of "view on war and nonviolence" is obvi
ously not surprising to Finn; Finn himself
finds it "difficult to conceive of any war,
certainly the limited wars that are most
likely in modern times, taking place with
out the torture of individual prisoners who
are captured."
Well, what is revolting about this is
not only the barbarism of it; it is not even
mainly the deception that labels such
opinions "views on . . . nonviolence." What
is truly sickening about this is the objectiv
ity and impersonality of these remarks.
There is no need to tell us that "everybody
does it." This we know. There is no pur
pose in informing us that "one could
, probably list some outlines." This we realize
is within the realm of the possible-but
why have you not done it, Mr. William V.
O'Brien? If you wish to speak of these
things, why haven't you thought- about
them; why haven't you pondered them?
Or, if you have indeed pondered them, and
searched your soul, then why not tell us
what you think? This is not even an opin
ion you give to us-you can see that. This is
a statement that an opinion is possible!
(And yet one feels that Mr. O'Brien does
justify torture, if vaguely, if without really
confronting the question. He never says so.
This is hardly passion. This is a dishonesty
so fundamental and radical that it has in
fected the very core of his person: he has
lost grip on himself; he does not really
know what he thinks, and therefore doesn't
really think at all. This in fact is the very
sickness of our time: *ve are not honest
with ourselves, and our dishonesty has in
fected even what we do; it is virulent).
