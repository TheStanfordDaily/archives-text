# MAFIA midnight (11:30 ?)

### Robin Lake 
Last Saturday night and Sunday
morning in the Nitery, the MaFiA opened
their new season to an overflowing, enthu
siastic audience with a couple of one-act
duets, Murray Schisgal's The Tiger and
Home Free! by Lanford Wilson.
The Tiger is the second half of
Schisgal's The Typists and The Tiger, writ
ten over five years ago for off-Broadway as
an evening of two one-act plays, starring hli
Wallach and Anne Jackson. The same two
actors appear in each play. The Typists is a
poignant parable about the struggle to break
through loneliness and frustration, and the
happenings of a single working day in a
small office are transformed into a matter
of universal bearing. It is the more difficult
and the more challenging play. Related in
theme but utterly different in tone, The
Tiger is a barrel of laughs. In fact, it is such
a deceptively funny play that it all too
often suffers the fate of a divorce from
The Typists, and in so doing loses a consid
erable part of its original punch.
Under the steady, comedic hand of
director Stephen Jay Book, actors
Gretchen Grant and Gene Parseghian un
fold the Thursday evening adventure of a
bored suburban housewife and a thirty
two-year-old milkman. Date, kidnap, pick
up, rape or fantasy? the switch deserves to
remain a surprise. Schisgal's satirical bit
makes fresh use of the old cliches re con
form it y and lack of communication.
Working under the major disadvantage of
their youth and good-looks (the script
screams for thirtyish plainness) the two
players triumphed in an hour of hilarity.
Home Free! presents a different prob
lem. Thirty-year-old playwright, Lanford
Wilson, (better known for The Madness of
Ladv bright) arrived in New York in 1962
and has since become a leading figure in the
off-off-Broadway movement. He has had
over fifteen productions at the Caffee
Chino and Cafe La Mama. Theatre 1965
presented his Home Free! at The Cherry
Lane Theater on the first bill of their New

Playwrights' Series. The play has since been
translated into eight languages.
Under the direction of Robert Walter,
actors Dennis Johnson (Lawrence Brown)
and Lynn Dusenberry (Joanna Brown
sister/wife?) create an enigmatic situation
and a group of characters such as Prune
face, Fishface, Ldna, and a forty-three year
old imbecile named Claypone. Again, the
action is confined to a one-room apartment
from which the Browns are in imminent
danger of being evicted since Joanna is
pregnant. Bringing to mind such parallels as
Games People Flay, Ldward Albee, the class
room and the nursery, the play presumably
has something to say to us about us. The
performances are competent and the
occasion provides a rare opportunity to see
the work of a major playwright from the

Eastern scene. However, there is no
guarantee that when you exit at 2:00 a.m.
you will be any the wiser.
The MaFiA was created to provide an
extra outlet for the insatiable "doers" and
at the same time to allow us the chance to
see how. why and what it is they do. It is
invaluable for the artists as a true repertory
experience, since most of them are busily
engaged in one or more other major pro
ductions as the same time hence the late
hour.
If the opening night is an indication of
the standard we may expect, we are in for a
worthwhile season that deserves our partic
ipation.
The Tiger and Home Free! will be
repeated next Saturday, October 26th at
1 1:30 p.m. in the Nitery.

ROBIN LAKE is a third year Ph.D. candidate in
dramatic literature and criticism.

a deceptively funny play that it all too
often suffers the fate of a divorce from
The Typists, and in so doing loses a consid
erable part of its original punch.
Under the steady, comedic hand of
director Stephen Jay Book, actors
Gretchen Grant and Gene Parseghian un
fold the Thursday evening adventure of a
bored suburban housewife and a thirty
two-year-old milkman. Date, kidnap, pick
up, rape or fantasy? the switch deserves to
remain a surprise. Schisgal's satirical bit
makes fresh use of the old cliches re con
form it y and lack of communication.
Working under the major disadvantage of
their youth and good-looks (the script
screams for thirtyish plainness) the two
players triumphed in an hour of hilarity.
Home Free! presents a different prob
lem. Thirty-year-old playwright, Lanford
Wilson, (better known for The Madness of
Ladv bright) arrived in New York in 1962
and has since become a leading figure in the
off-off-Broadway movement. He has had
over fifteen productions at the Caffee
Chino and Cafe La Mama. Theatre 1965
presented his Home Free! at The Cherry
Lane Theater on the first bill of their New

Playwrights' Series. The play has since been
translated into eight languages.
Under the direction of Robert Walter,
actors Dennis Johnson (Lawrence Brown)
and Lynn Dusenberry (Joanna Brown
sister/wife?) create an enigmatic situation
and a group of characters such as Prune
face, Fishface, Ldna, and a forty-three year
old imbecile named Claypone. Again, the
action is confined to a one-room apartment
from which the Browns are in imminent
danger of being evicted since Joanna is
pregnant. Bringing to mind such parallels as
Games People Flay, Ldward Albee, the class
room and the nursery, the play presumably
has something to say to us about us. The
performances are competent and the
occasion provides a rare opportunity to see
the work of a major playwright from the

Eastern scene. However, there is no
guarantee that when you exit at 2:00 a.m.
you will be any the wiser.
The MaFiA was created to provide an
extra outlet for the insatiable "doers" and
at the same time to allow us the chance to
see how. why and what it is they do. It is
invaluable for the artists as a true repertory
experience, since most of them are busily
engaged in one or more other major pro
ductions as the same time hence the late
hour.
If the opening night is an indication of
the standard we may expect, we are in for a
worthwhile season that deserves our partic
ipation.
The Tiger and Home Free! will be
repeated next Saturday, October 26th at
1 1:30 p.m. in the Nitery.

Last Saturday night and Sunday
morning in the Nitery, the MaFiA opened
their new season to an overflowing, enthu
siastic audience with a couple of one-act
duets, Murray Schisgal's The Tiger and
Home Free! by Lanford Wilson.
The Tiger is the second half of
Schisgal's The Typists and The Tiger, writ
ten over five years ago for off-Broadway as
an evening of two one-act plays, starring hli
Wallach and Anne Jackson. The same two
actors appear in each play. The Typists is a
poignant parable about the struggle to break
through loneliness and frustration, and the
happenings of a single working day in a
small office are transformed into a matter
of universal bearing. It is the more difficult
and the more challenging play. Related in
theme but utterly different in tone, The
Tiger is a barrel of laughs. In fact, it is such
a deceptively funny play that it all too
often suffers the fate of a divorce from
The Typists, and in so doing loses a consid
erable part of its original punch.
