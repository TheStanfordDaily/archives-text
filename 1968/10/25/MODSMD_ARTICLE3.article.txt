Editor, The Daily: I
Thank you, Mr. Editor, thank you! After a
good many years of decent but hard-working I
obscurity, I suddenly find the Hebrew language (
placarded in the titles of the local press. It is a '

heady wine. I purvey no longer a dead language
but the very lingo of modern mass
communication. My fantasies involve no mere full
professorship some day before I retire, but
millions of paperback sales of the answer to
McLuhan: From Right to Left, and its smash
sequel, Reading Backwards is a Drag.
Thank you, Mr. Editor, for making Stanford
safer for Hebrew, for doing my public relations
work for me gratis, for demonstrating to a heedless
world the relevance of the gloriously antique. I
worry only about the fund-raising entailed by thjs
new status. If the private few are to become many,
the ten dauntless in a first-year class a thousand,
how can we pay for the 75 TA's of whom I shall
have to be executive head?
There is one other thing. Your script is swell,
but you're a lousy speller.
