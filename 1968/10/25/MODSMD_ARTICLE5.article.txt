# Dada At the Stanford Museum: a contemporary view
## 
### CHARLES KATZ, JR 
: october 7-november 27

Dada is a word that is much in vogue
today among revolutionary students and
the various liberators of society who seek
to use the tools and symbols of culture to
subvert it. It is a word that is heard in
guerrilla theater and is implicit behind ef
forts to elect a pig (and I mean the farm
animal) President of the iJnited States. 1 he
word itself, with its ironic smirk and the
amusing way that it trips from the tongue

is a spiritual link these contemporary
groups have established with the inter
national movement that originated during
the First World War. Their antics and the
increasing interest in the Dada movement
suggest that its influences are still very
much alive.
The present Dada exhibition in the
Stanford Museum is one of many that has
been organized in the past few years, and
although it is really nothing more than the
enlarged pages of a book constituting a
who's who of Dada, it provides an oppor
tunity for reflection on the great days of
the movement. In some ways those times
were similar to these, and the frustrations

and actions of the Dada groups are mir
rored, to an extent, by the revolutionaries
in contemporary American society.
Dada existed long before a group of
writers and artists gave it a name in a
Zurich bar called the Cabaret Voltaire in
the spring of 1916. Such factual
ascriptions, although helpful in establishing
historical associations, fail to unveil the real
nature of Dada which cannot be contained
in the dates and places of a chronology.
Dada was above all a state of mind
with origins from many sources in a time of
intellectual upheaval. Werner Haftmann
links it to a culmination of the probings of
the real mystery of life brought about
largely through the impact of Nietzsche
upon accepted social values. Darwinism
also played a part in disrupting man's
placid view of himself with respect to na
ture. The nineteenth-century academic con
cepts of beauty and harmony had been
increasingly altered by radically new ideas
about art.
There was an uncertainty among
many about growing machine technology
and production. Traditional values were
questioned more arduously because of the
First World War which exemplified the con
sequences of outdated political systems and
social ideals. The artist, whether he writes
or paints, is more acutely aware of the
nostras and pathos of existence than most
others. The men who gathered in neutral
Zurich shared remarkably similar views on
the events of their day. Their art and
writing was the result of the particular frus
trations, emotions, and anguish of their
lives which had been caught in a war they

hated and deemed absurd, coupled with the
new spirit of invention and innovation in
the forms of art.
Dada gained its early notoriety largely
because of the attacks that it made on
the war and the society that created it.
Richard Huelsenbeck, a German poet,
writing in 1920 said:
None of us had much appreci
ation for the kind of courage it
takes to get shot for the idea of a
nation which is at best a cartel of
pelt merchants and profiteers in
leather, at worst a cultural associ
ation of psychopaths who, like
the Germans, marched off with a
volume of Goethe in their knap
sacks, to skewer Frenchmen and
Russians on their bayonets.
Perhaps because of their mutual feeling of
exile from an absurd society the Dadaists
viewed the world as divided between two
groups the artists and the bourgeoisie
They abhored the traditional ideas of
honor, country, morality, family, art, reli
gion, liberty, fraternity, and brotherhood.
They quoted Descartes' famous phrase, "je
nc veux meme pas savior s'il y a eu des
hommes avant moi," as a motto for their
activities and took a childish pleasure in
raging against the system they regarded as
stupid. Huelsenbeck also said that:
We did not neglect from time to
time to tell the fat and utterly
uncomprehending Zurich
philistines that we regarded them
as pigs and the German Kaiser as
the initiator of the war.
