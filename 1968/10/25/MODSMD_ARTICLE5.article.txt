# Dada At the Stanford Museum: a contemporary view
## 
### CHARLES KATZ, JR 
: october 7-november 27

Dada is a word that is much in vogue
today among revolutionary students and
the various liberators of society who seek
to use the tools and symbols of culture to
subvert it. It is a word that is heard in
guerrilla theater and is implicit behind ef
forts to elect a pig (and I mean the farm
animal) President of the iJnited States. 1 he
word itself, with its ironic smirk and the
amusing way that it trips from the tongue

is a spiritual link these contemporary
groups have established with the inter
national movement that originated during
the First World War. Their antics and the
increasing interest in the Dada movement
suggest that its influences are still very
much alive.
The present Dada exhibition in the
Stanford Museum is one of many that has
been organized in the past few years, and
although it is really nothing more than the
enlarged pages of a book constituting a
who's who of Dada, it provides an oppor
tunity for reflection on the great days of
the movement. In some ways those times
were similar to these, and the frustrations

and actions of the Dada groups are mir
rored, to an extent, by the revolutionaries
in contemporary American society.
Dada existed long before a group of
writers and artists gave it a name in a
Zurich bar called the Cabaret Voltaire in
the spring of 1916. Such factual
ascriptions, although helpful in establishing
historical associations, fail to unveil the real
nature of Dada which cannot be contained
in the dates and places of a chronology.
Dada was above all a state of mind
with origins from many sources in a time of
intellectual upheaval. Werner Haftmann
links it to a culmination of the probings of
the real mystery of life brought about
largely through the impact of Nietzsche
upon accepted social values. Darwinism
also played a part in disrupting man's
placid view of himself with respect to na
ture. The nineteenth-century academic con
cepts of beauty and harmony had been
increasingly altered by radically new ideas
about art.
There was an uncertainty among
many about growing machine technology
and production. Traditional values were
questioned more arduously because of the
First World War which exemplified the con
sequences of outdated political systems and
social ideals. The artist, whether he writes
or paints, is more acutely aware of the
nostras and pathos of existence than most
others. The men who gathered in neutral
Zurich shared remarkably similar views on
the events of their day. Their art and
writing was the result of the particular frus
trations, emotions, and anguish of their
lives which had been caught in a war they

hated and deemed absurd, coupled with the
new spirit of invention and innovation in
the forms of art.
Dada gained its early notoriety largely
because of the attacks that it made on
the war and the society that created it.
Richard Huelsenbeck, a German poet,
writing in 1920 said:
None of us had much appreci
ation for the kind of courage it
takes to get shot for the idea of a
nation which is at best a cartel of
pelt merchants and profiteers in
leather, at worst a cultural associ
ation of psychopaths who, like
the Germans, marched off with a
volume of Goethe in their knap
sacks, to skewer Frenchmen and
Russians on their bayonets.
Perhaps because of their mutual feeling of
exile from an absurd society the Dadaists
viewed the world as divided between two
groups the artists and the bourgeoisie
They abhored the traditional ideas of
honor, country, morality, family, art, reli
gion, liberty, fraternity, and brotherhood.
They quoted Descartes' famous phrase, "je
nc veux meme pas savior s'il y a eu des
hommes avant moi," as a motto for their
activities and took a childish pleasure in
raging against the system they regarded as
stupid. Huelsenbeck also said that:
We did not neglect from time to
time to tell the fat and utterly
uncomprehending Zurich
philistines that we regarded them
as pigs and the German Kaiser as
the initiator of the war.
On the question of love the Dadaists
were of mixed opinions, although most
tended to value the traditional idea of love
as Hans Arp did when he wrote:
all bosom friendship and love is a
lot of apple sauce, like water off
the duck's back so love runs off
the human bacon.
The idea of religion was completely
fraudulent for the Dadaists, and Tristan
Tzara felt it was false to try to assign a
broad base or character of universality to
mankind. In his second Dada Manifesto he
wrote:
The attempt of Jesus and Bible
covers with their broad
benevolent wings: shit, animals,
days. How can one expect to put
order into chaos that constitutes
that infinite and shapeless
variation: man?
Hans Arp summarizes the Dadaists'
abhorrence for money and the means for
jgaining it.
was there ever a bigger swine
than the man who invented the
expression time in money.time
and space no longer exist for
modern man.with a can of gaso
line under his behind man whizzes
faster and faster around the earth
so that soon he will be back
again before he leaves.
The Dadaists so hated the bourgeoisie
that they went out of their way to play
tricks like announcing that Charlie Chaplin
would be present at one of their demon
strations and that two Dadaists would pub
licly shave each other's heads, without the
least intention of fulfilling either claim.
They sent reports to newspapers claiming
that beloved popular writers had been
killed. All this, as Arp put it, was "to rob
the bourgeois of his sleep."
Dada occupies a special place in the
history of art. In the first instance, it was
heavily weighted toward a literary and ver
bal side rather than a visual one. Poets and
writers played as large a part in the forma
tion of the movement as the artists, and
sometimes suggested literary techniques
that could be incorporated into art. Col
lage, which the Dadaists were among the
first to fully explore, made great use of
word plays and were read more as verbal
messages of ideas than as visual or aesthetic
ones.
The literary nature of Dada was noted
by the numerous manifestoes published by
its practitioners. In one manifesto Francis
Picabia explained the movement this
way:
You do not understand, of course,
what we are doing! Well, my dear
friends, we understand it still
less. How wonderful, isn't it,
that you are right! .... You
don't understand? Neither do
I; how sad!

Tristan Tzara published seven Dada
manifestoes between 1916 and 1920 in
which he assaulted the reader with
expressions of the very paradox of Dada as
anti-art. The manifestoes were important
for setting forth the basic ideas of the
movement and its definitions, but by being
against systems, Dada became something of
a system itself in Tzara's theorizing. He
wrote, for example,
A work of art should not be
beauty in itself, for beauty is
dead; it should be neither gay
nor sad, neither light nor dark to
rejoice or torture the individual
by serving him the cakes of
sacred aureoles or the sweets of a
vaulted race through the atmos
pheres.
The literary nature of Dada is further noted
in the many public readings and demon
strations created by the members. These
occasions were often sprinkled with ob
scenities solely for a verbal impact and
attack upon the sensibilities of the bour
geoisie.
A second characteristic of Dada as art
is the reliance upon chance. This was not a
new occurence unknown to previous artists.
Change had often been exploited for its
spontaneous and innovative character by
sculptors and painters alike, but for the
Dadaists, chance took on special mental
associations they held crucial in their art.
Chance was a destructive and constructive
element, an anti-logic and yet a formula. In
a manifesto, Tzara wrote:
Logic is a complication. Logic is
always wrong .... Married to
logic, art would live in
incest....
Dada turned away from reason and
logic believing that these were limiting
qualities of everyday life. They strove for

spontaneous expression coming from the
artist's unconscious nature. Hans Richter
write:
The absence of any ulterior mo
tive enabled us to listen to the
voice of the 'Unknown'â€”and to
draw knowledge from the realm
of the unknown.
At the same time that the Dadaists
were concerning themselves with chance, it
was also a subject of much discussion for
psychologists and philosophers. Paul
Kammerer was working on the problem of
laws governing subconscious relationships
and the effect they had on daily life. Freud
had found chance to be an important un
conscious element within man's nature.
Hans Richter believed chance had a secret
magical purpose and that the demise of rea
son might lead back to a "primeval magic
power" found only in the unconscious
mind. It would be through this type of
action that art would achieve the ultimate
honesty.
By reliance upon chance and the com
binations produced by random selection,
the Dadaists invented new art techniques
and freedoms. Tristan Tzara often said that
the poem should be made in the mouth and
not have creativity submitted to the
controls of logical arrangement. The
thoughts were thus to arrange themselves
without a guiding intelligence. To achieve
such randomness, he would cut up news
papers or magazines and drop the words
into a container. A poem would be created
by the order in which he drew them out.
Frederick Hoffman describes Dadaist
poetry as a series of effects rather than a
form or pattern and offers the following
example:

Concerning the Dadaist use of chance,
however, William Rubin points out in the
catalogue for the large exhibition entitled
Dada, Surrealism, and Their Heritage, that
Hans Arp's technique of dropping cut
pieces of paper onto a board and then
pasting them according to the way in which
they had fallen should not be taken at face
value. In a conversation with Arp, the artist
confirmed the fact that he had just used
the chance fall of the paper as a starting

point for his imagination and had
rearranged the pieces consciously with an
eye to their visual personality. Other
Dadaists relied to a greater or lesser degree
upon chance; one even painted pictures in
the dark emphasizing the importance of the
creative act rather than the result of it.
The Dadaists, largely through the in
ventiveness of Marcel Duchamp, established
the "readymade" as potential sculpture.
Duchamp was neither for art nor against it,
holding to an ambivalent position that art
could not really be defined but consisted of
what the viewer of the artist wished to call
by that name. Thus he could select any ob
ject at random and by the mere choosing or
labelling of that object with the word "art"
could, as Richter wrote, lift it"from the
limbo of unregarded objects into the living
world of works of art: looking at it made it
into art."
The subversive aspect of this defi
nition for the history of art is all too ob
vious. The selection of certain objects by
Duchamp shows the imaginative and ca
pricious side of his character. Once he
took an urinal, mounted it on a pedestal,
and signed it "R. Mutt." Duchamp's
objects, when seen on display in the
present Stanford exhibition, take on a cer
tain precociousness and self-consciousness.
They seem infinitely aware of their
purpose-like a virgin in a whorehouse.
The Dadaists were really the first to

make wide use of the idea of public demon
strations or exhibitions and often these
controversial meetings were characterized
by public violence and outrage resulting in
mob action. The Dadaists relished such
occasions to attack the absurdity and fool
ishness of the bourgeois world, and to
present a destructive assault on art itself.
David Gascoyne describes one such sensa
tional occurrence in Cologne:
In order to enter the gallery one
had to pass through a public lava
tory. Inside, the public was pro
vided with hatchets with which,
if they wanted to, they could
attack the objects and paintings
exhibited. At the end of the gal
lery a young girl, dressed in
white for her first communion,
stood reciting obscene poems.
These demonstrations are related only
in form to the current Happenings. The
Happening is an extension of the idea of
action painting, whereby the gesture of the
artist is a more important part of the crea
tive act than the result, which might end up
in a museum of a retrospective show sixty
years later. The Happening has also bor
rowed largely from the ideas of Gestalt
psychology and encounter situations, and is
viewed as an important artistic exercise to
increase self-awareness.
The Dada demonstrations, on the
other hand, were characterized by a mali
cious frivolity and were meant to insult and
enrage the audience, much in the same way
that Dada art did. There was little differ
ence to the Dadaists between the created
objects, the poems, the demonstrations,
and the publications. All were meant to
overthrow traditionally held notions of art;
all were meant to liberate the artist from
constraint.

The Dada movement was not limited
to artistie and intellectual upheaval. In its
perfect state Dada was pure revolt and was
anti-everything to the point of being anti-
Dada. With this mental approach, it is easy
to understand why political revolution was
particularly appealing to the Dadaists.
Some of the group had known Lenin in
Zurich and were exposed to his revolution
ary ideas, but it was the Berlin Dadaists
who were in the forefront of political
activism. Richter wrote that "the flirtation
with communism was solely the product of
this anti-everything mentality, not of any
devotion to the doctrines of Karl Marx."
Huclscnhcck was the leader of the
Dada communists and during the week of
revolution in Berlin in November, 1917. he
became Commissar of Fine Arts. Along
with Raoul Hausmann, another German
Dadaist, he wrote a public paper called
What is Dadaism and What Docs It Want in
Germany? in which they demanded a
radical regulation and communist division
of life. Such things as the "Introduction of
the simultaneist poem as a Communist
state prayer" and the "Establishment of a
Dadaist advisory council for the
remodelling of life" were proposed. The
Berlin wing of the old anti-everything
movement became a system.
The question of whether Dada is dead
invariably comes up in discussion of the
movement and is particularly relevant
because of its present popularity.
Huelsenbcck, at the height of the Dada ac
tivity, prophesied:
But if Dada dies here, it will
some day appear on another
planet with rattles and kettle
drums, pot covers and simultane
ous poems, and remind the old
God that there are still people
who are very well aware of the
complete idiocy of the world.
In spite of the fertility of the Dada
movement, it is incorrect to assume that
the movement is still alive. It is an error to
title an exhibition "Dada, 1916-1966"
because the movement itself did not live
that long, although some of its many for

mulations arc still influential with modern
artists. The Dadaists demolished the idea
that only certain mediums were
appropriate for art. They subverted the
notion that there were specific canons for
the good and beautiful in art. They
propagated the theories of chance, random
ness, and the creative impulse of the artist.
They did much to destroy the imposed bar
riers between the various types of artistic
expression. Many of the Dadaists became
leading personalities in other movements,
like Surrealism, and continued teaching
artistic concepts formulated in their Dada
upbringing.
The present exhibition in the Stanford
Museum inaccurately attempts to en
compass within the heading of Dada cur
rent works of Pop and Op art. Pop art
approaches life with an entirely different
mentality than Dada. It is not trying to
shock the public, but rather objectively cel
ebrates the aesthetic qualities (or lack of
them) in common objects of everyday use.
Pop is similar to Dada in that the most
important qualification for art lies in the
artist's choosing of the object. Op art is
even further removed from the personal
humanistic concerns of the Dadaists. Its
only link to the group is through a series of
roto-reliefs or optical disks done by Marcel
Duchamp which can be seen in the present
exhibition. Op is a cool art of the scientific
properties of color and form. It is an
experiment with the eye and is consider
ably distinct from Dada which was
interested less in formal properties than in
the emotional and intellectual content of
the subject matter.
There are certain similarities between
American culture today and that of World
War I Europe which make Dada more per
sonally relevant to us. We, too, are involved
in an absurd and seemingly endless war
which represents the result of old ways of
thinking about political and social systems
that have changed. We, too, are hearing
charges of imperialism and selfish national
interest in ;i critical period of history. As
in European intellectual circles of sixty
years ago, the rapid revolutions in social

and scientific thought today call into ques
tion any stable system of values or world
view. The more we learn the more anxious
we get.
Yet it would be difficult to find a true
Dada art today and not one that has
adopted certain Dadaistic traits. For one
thing, there are fewer traditional values in
the United States, and an attack upon
American culture is a normal occurrence
that seems harmless in art.
As a culture, we are used to avant
garde art and although it may seem inexpli
cable, it is not for the most part shocking
in the way the Armory Show proved a
scandal. Marcuse's idea of absorption into
the system of that which seems different
and subversive to it is followed into the
acceptance of contemporary art.
The great expansion in availability of
posters or lithographs makes contemporary
art accessible and popular. The avant-garde
is not collected solely by the elite, although
they may be the only ones who can afford
the original paintings, but is demanded by
many. Guerrilla theater is an accepted
mode of entertainment." Its participants
may be dismissed as "kooks and radicals"
but few are shocked by their behavior in
the same way that the Dadaists scandalized
Europe. A play such as Hair involving
nudity that was meant to shock and "liber
ate" the American public may raise eye
brows and irritate the Wallace supporters
enough to call for repression but becomes a
New York success anyway.
Art that wants to defy the label of art
is quickly bought by collectors and
museums. When Jimi Hendrix destroys a
guitar on stage of a concert, his destructive
act, unlike that of the Dadaists, is no more
offensive than a goo'd saloon brawl in a
Western starring Ronald Reagan.
