## John Gardner: On participation 
### Patrick McMahon 
J. PATRICK McMAHON is editor of the Stanford
daily magazine. He is a senior and lives in Roble.

Former Secretary of Health,
Education and Welfare John Gardner left
his Cabinet post last spring because the
American people and their congressional
representatives seemed unconcerned with
the vast and critical problems confronting
America's cities. American universities in
which intellectual excellence seemed often
to mean political torpor, were doing no
better. The characteristic sluggishness of
these institutions caused Gardner to resign
from the former and refuse the presi
dency of several of the latter. Eager to be
in a position of greater influence, John
Gardner started the Urban Coalition.
"And I'm just caught up in the cities/'
he said in an interview last month at San
Francisco International Airport.
The aim of Gardner's Coalition is to
bring different segments of a community
together as a group to solve that commun
ity's problems.
"You go into, a city and you find that
the city hall is isolated from almost every
thing else," reports Gardner. "We try to get
the mayor to bring in other people,
including the black community, as allies,
and they begin to be aware of the problems
in building codes, state legislatures, and so
on.
"Who ever thinks about the planning
of the cities?"
Reflecting on his choice to set up the
program, he said, "The Urban Coalition is a
great old gamble."
This gamble, says Gardner, will
preclude his accepting either the Columbia
presidency or a post in the next Cabinet.
Gardner feels that universities also
should assume much of the blame for
urban conditions. "American universities
can be indicted for their failure to tackle

this problem, and Stanford University is
not clear of this indictment," he said. The
reason for this, says Gardner, "is not ill
will. Universities are very ponderous
institutions that resist change. In fact, you
can get to businessmen possibly better than
to professors. There's a pretty large seg
ment you can reach. In our liveliest
coalitions, black businessmen often lead
the way."
Gardner sees the role of universities
and specifically of Stanford as "helping to
figure out how to redesign the institutions
of this country. Institutions are complex
and resistant to change, but "the health of
government demands that young people and
faculty be turned loose in a civic role.
Every university has a state capitol or a
city hall nearby, and every one needs lots of
needling and lots of criticism."
From student power and faculty
power to black power, Gardner strongly
advocates participation in policy-making:
"I am a very firm believer in participation,
any time, any place, but especially now.
This is a period when people are with
drawing confidence from their institutions."
56 years old and balding, Gardner dis
cusses the structure of decision-making at
Stanford. His keynote is communication. "If
you get beyond communication, you're in
considerable danger of eroding the presi
dency and getting the trustees involved in
day-to-day decision-making. We have to be
careful we are not devising by-paths around
the executive.
"The role of the Board of Trustees is to
deal with questions of top policy. Trustees
should be concerned with long range
issues."
Gardner mentioned that one of his
standard speeches to faculty members was to
suggest forming advisory committees for
presidential selection and similar searches.
On student involvement in the selection of
President-designate Kenneth S. Pitzer,
Gardner said there is "very little in
established custom to say that the Stanford
trustees were wrong, but you can be rea-

sonably certain that a student advisory
committee will be involved in the next
selection process."
Criticism of the University as a
"military-industrial complex" is not wholly
accepted by the former Cabinet member.
"I believe universities must be active in
their times. As long as we have an Army, a
Navy, or an Air Force, 1 hope they won't
be left solely to the military mind. I think
the university ought to be part of what's
going on." To separate the two spheres com
pletely, he says, would be "the path of im
potence for the university and mindlessness
for society."
But he sees dangers also. "If you ride
with the forces, you can easily make the
university something it was never intended
to be. We need a surveillance mechanism to
monitor this relation in terms of retaining
autonomy. We need not only active partic
ipators, but active critics. Many
universities, including some departments at
Stanford are not aggressive about that
relationship and the policies involved."
Concerning the 1968 elections,
Gardner said "McCarthy was almost the
political story of 1968," especially con
sidering the abolition of the unit rule and
the opening up of methods of selecting del
egates.
Gardner added that the
"non-partisan" nature of the Coalition
would rule out an endorsement of candi
dates for political office, including the
Presidency.
He said students "should have pride in
what happened, stay in it and work for
local candidates, and set to the task of fur
ther electoral reform."
Enlarging on the idea of university
contribution to government reform, he sug
gested students, law schools, and political
science associations "should work to
develop model state legislatures and other
governmental bodies. The average state leg
islature is a festival of conflicts of interest."
