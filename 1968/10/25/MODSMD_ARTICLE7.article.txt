# Biafra a student looks at his homeland

### HYPOLITE AMUZIE 
HYPOLITE AMUZIE is a junior in chemistry from
Biafra. He came to the United States in January
1967, having to travel through the Camerouns
because no one from the then Eastern Nigeria
could travel through Nigerian territory without
being shot. He intends to return to Biafra afttr
completing medical school.

One of the factors which contributed
to the creation of the Independent and
Sovereign State of Biafra was the inability
of the different ethnic groups within the
defunct Nigerian Federation to get along
together. Nigeria, one of the West African
countries, was until May 1967 about four
and a half times the size of Great Britain.
Her population, according to the controver
sial census of 1963, was about 55 million.
The country encompassed more than 50
ethnic groups, each with its own distinctive
culture, language and religion. The three
largest of these ethnic groups were the
Yorubas in the West (partly Moslems and
partly Christians), the Moslem Hausas in
the North, and the Ibos, most of whom are
Christians, in what was then Eastern
Nigeria.
Until May 30, 1967, to a casual ob
server, Nigeria retained much ot the pro
gressive, constructive, enlightened aura that
had surrounded it since it won its inde
pendence from Great Britain. To many, it
not only exemplified the promise ot re
sponsible government in Africa but also
retained the image of a showpiece ol
African democracy. But in reality, Nigeria
had been on the brink of disintegration
ever since May 1966, when political up
heaval, anarchy, rioting and pogrom made
of Nigeria a house divided by dissension
and suspicion.
Ever since the North and South of
Nigeria were amalgamated by the British in
1914 for administrative purposes, the fact
of the existence of widely diverging intra
national cultures has been as obvious as the
events of May 196*7 demonstrated. It is sig
nificant however, that the Northern
political leaders insisted on emphasizing
these differences during the fifty years

when Nigeria apparently existed as a polit
ical entity.
This attitude of the North is sum
marized by James Coleman in his book
Nigeria,- Background to Nationalism:
"Until 1950 Northern Nigeria was largely
unaffected by the growing forces of nation
alism then centered in the cities of
Southern Nigeria. As Southern Nationalists
cast their recruiting nets ever wider and
sought an alliance with incipient
nationalists in the North, the Fulani Aris
tocracy, aided by the British
administration, organized a counter
nationalist party into which Northerners
were inducted to defend gradualism and
the emigrant system."
Small wonder then that Southerners
who genuinely accepted amalgamation and
took its implications seriously by
emigrating to and investing their resources
in the North, were looked upon by North
erners as "native foreigners," who had
come to dominate the indigenous people
and exploit their resources. A sort of
"apartheid" policy was in vogue in North
ern Nigeria against these "native
foreigners" as they were kept in
"Sabongaris" (Stranger Settlements) quite
distinct from the Birni (walled towns) of
the indigenes.
Consequently, separate institutions
schools, colleges, police and courts-were
established and developed for the North
erners on the one hand and their "foreign"
countrymen on the other. 1 his practice
helped to worsen and prolong the uneven
educational and economic development of
the North and South-a process which
began in the mid-nineteenth century when
European Christian missions started to op
erate in the South but were debarred by
Northern Moslems from operating in the
North.
The Northerners' unfair treatment of
Southerners as foreigners and the persistent
disinclination of Northerners to identify
themselves with the rest of the country ac
counted in great measure for the unequal
vote of development evident in the social
and economic as well as the political life of

the North and the South. Mallam (after
wards Alhaji) Abubakar Tafawa Balewa,
late Prime Minister of Nigeria, summarized
the Northern position vis-a-vis the rest of
Nigeria in a speech before the new Legis
lative Council in April 1947: "1 think 1947
will always stand as a very important year
in the history of Nigeria. Since the amalga
mation of the Southern and Northern
Provinces in 1914, Nigeria has existed as
one country only on paper. "
It is clear that Northern Nigeria never
wanted a United Nigeria, even under con
ditions guaranteeing her domination over
the rest of the country. Consequently,
Northern domination over the political life
of the federation could offer no leadership
committed to a united Nigeria.
By January 1966, many Nigerians had
become highly dissatisfied with the state of
affairs in the country. The already existing
tension was worsened by the arrangement
whereby the North had a constitutional
stranglehold on the South-East, Mid-West
and West. The North had a built-in 50%
representation at the centre and was
assured of permanent control of the federal
government.
On January 21, 1966, a columnist of
the New Statesman of London aptly
referred to the late Head of the Nigeria gov
ernment, Sir Abubakar as "Prime-Minister
in-Apparent-Perpetuity." While Abubakar
was in Lagos enjoying the fruits of self gov
ernment for which he scarcely worked, his
people in the North were fettered by the
chains of tradition. They preferred Arabic
laws and courts to the Nigerian legal sys
tem. And while Northernization was the
policy in the North, Nigerianization was be
ing pursued in the South.
Consequently, in the first five years
following independence, one political crisis
followed another in rapid succession. Each
crisis presaged a final disintegration of the
country. As each was eventually patched
up through compromise, Nigeria became
notorious for her giddy brinkmanship. In
1964-65 there were 195 strikes involving
68,000 workers and the loss of 205,000

man days. One needs only to recall the
Action Group (a Western Nigeria Political
Party) Schism of 1962, the National Census
Controversy of 1962-63, and the Federal
Election Crisis of 1964-65. Rigging became
the order of the day, and politicians be
came demi-gods. Mediocrity was enthroned
in high places.
Even the foreign policy of the country
was sometimes confused and frustrated by
the statements and actions of politicians. In
September 1965, the late Premier of North
ern Nigeria, Alhaji Sir Ahmadu Bello, was
asked by reporters what he thought about
Nigeria reciprocating the gesture of Israel
which had established a diplomatic mission
in the country soon after independence. An
Arab-oriented Moslem, Sir Ahmadu
reported: "What is Israel? To me Israel
does not exist."
The survival of the nation seemed to
have become a matter for speculation. And
it had become clear that the destiny of
Nigeria was, in many cases, in the wrong
hands. Meanwhile dispatches from Lagos
continued to broadcast the "One Nigeria"
myth to the world.
January 1966, brought the collapse of
this particular illusion. A group of young
army officers from various sections of the
Nigerian community overthrew the govern
ment in January 1966. Some of the officers
and four politicians who tried to resist ar
rest died in the ensuing exchange of fire.
Declaration of support came from political
parties, student organizations and trade
unions, who believed the coup would aid in
the struggle against economic and social in
justice, political fraud, tribalism, nepotism
and the excesses of a few power-drunken
politicians. Major General Aguiyi Ironsi,
who became the head of the National Mili
tary government, tried to build a Utopian
Nigeria; but he did more by building it
upon the dead bodies of his fellow East
erners and finally sacrificing his own life.
He was kidnapped on July 29th and mur
dered because he was not Northerner. He
was killed because he 1 • tited a united
Nigeria. As the military Governor of Biafra,

Lt. Col. Ojukwu later remarked, "Ironsi
was the last Nigerian."
The experience of three harrowing
waves of remorseless genocide in 1945,
1953 and especially in 1966, which left a
total of nearly 40,000 people dead and
countless others maimed or destitute, pro
vided an object lesson which could not but
be taken seriously.
On May 29 1966, Northern Nigerians
invaded churches in the North and carried
out a celebrated slaughter of people from
Eastern Nigeria. The bloodshed increased
when the Ironsi government was toppled
on July 29 by the same persons holding
power in Nigeria today. The well planned
and efficiently executed massacres involved
innocent civilians. Men, women and chil
dren were taken from their beds and
slaughtered in cold blood; they were mur
dered in the hospitals, where not even
women in labor were spared; they were
massacred in places of worship, in the
streets, in the market places and in vehicles
as they tried to escape to safety. The full
story of these organized and brutal
massacres the pogrom of then Eastern
Nigerians in other parts of Nigeria,
especially in the North will never be told
in our lifetime. These gruesome murders
and other acts of barbarism read like a
story from the dark ages, but they have
happened in our twentieth century.
What is significant about those con
cerned with Nigeria's territorial integrity
today is that they said or did nothing as
innocent Biafran blood tlowed along the
streets of Nigeria.
On August Ist Lt. Col. Yakubu
Gowon announced to the nation that
Northern Nigerian rebels had overthrown
the legal government of the day, and that
he as their leader had assumed respon
sibility as Head of the National govern
ment. In his first broadcast to the nation,
he had this to say: "I have come to the
most difficult but most important part of
this statement. I am doing it conscious of
the great disappointment and heartbreak it
will cause all true and sincere lovers of

Nigeria and Nigerian unity, both at home
and abroad, especially our brothers in the
Commonwealth. Suffice to say that putting
all considerations to test- political, eco
nomic as well as social-the base for unity
is not there. " This same man today speaks
of unity in Nigeria.
The killing of Eastern Nigerians con
tinued and in his message to the military
Governor of Eastern Nigeria, Col. Ojukwu,
Gowon gave the conditions for cease fire
by the rebels as 1) that the Republic of
Nigeria be split into its component parts
2) that all Southerners resident in the
North be repatriated to the South and all
Northerners resident in the South repa
triated to the North.
In spite of the fact that the only rep
resentations made at these ceasefire
negotiations were those of the rebels and
their supporters in the North, it was agreed
to accept these proposals and stop further
bloodshed. Referring to the tragic events of
the recent past, His Excellency, the mili
tary Governor of the then East said: "It
must, therefore be our prayer that the in
nocent blood thus shed will be accepted as
the supreme purchase price for the solid
and everlasting unity of this country, and
that the events which led to this situation
will forever be the worst that this country
should experience." But the killings con
tinued and the country was in anarchy.
When pressure was brought to bear on him
by Western diplomats and his British ad
visers, Gowon changed his original plans to
take the North out of the Nigerian Feder
ation.
Under this situation, the Nigerian
army could no longer exist as a body
under a unified command. Nor did it exist
to protect all the citizens of Nigeria. There
was an atmosphere of suspicion and dis
trust. It was against this background that
the governors of the country's four regions
were invited to Accra, Ghana by Lt. Gen
Ankrali in January 1967. The use of force
in settling the Nigerian problems was de
nounced; but Gowon afterwards ignored
the decisions reached at the conference,
stating that he had gone to Ghana un
prepared, and that he had not understood
the implications of some of the decisions.
It seemed that Gowon was not
prepared to find a peaceful solution to
problems in which he himself was
implicated. Subsequent events showed this
to be correct. After refusing to honor the
Aburi agreements, he proceeded to black
mail the East. He made it clear that he had
abandoned faith in the joint declaration to
eschew the use of force in the settlement of
problems.
In April 1967 Gowon began his eco
nomic blockade of the East: all flights to
East Nigeria were prohibited by decree,

ships were forbidden from visiting Eastern
harbors and all communications to the out
side world cut off. He diverted funds which
could have been used for resettlement and
payment of compensation for property de
stroyed in order to purchase arms from
Moscow, Britain, and Egypt. Meanwhile he
was amassing his soldiers in preparation for
war against the people he had already
begun to exterminate.
By May 30, 1967, 30,000 Eastern
Nigerians had been slaughtered. Two mil
lion had been driven away from other parts
of Nigeria where they had made their
homes as Nigerians. Children came back
without fathers and mothers, mothers with
out children and husbands, and fathers
stripped of their children and wives. It was
the darkest page in the annals of the coun
try. Suffering and travail racked nearly
every family in Eastern Nigeria.
For years, Eastern Nigerians had
spearheaded the movement for Nigerian
unity. Many had moved to less developed
areas of the country and contributed to
their growth, even to the neglect of their
own region. To opt out of a federation in
which they had invested so much seemed
unthinkable; but they had no real choice.
On May 29, 1967, the joint session of
the enlarged Consultative Assembly and the
Advisory Committee of Chiefs and Elders,
passed a resolution mandating his Excel
lency Lt. Col. Chukwuemeke Odumegwu
Ojukwu to declare Eastern Nigeria a free,
sovereign and independent State. On May
30 he proclaimed: "The birth of the Re
public of Biafra-Africa's Rising Sun."
The majority of Biafra's 14 million
people are Ibos. "Biafra," writes Lloyd
Garrison of the New York Times, "is no
ministate." It is bigger than Bulgaria, more
populous than Sweden. Within Africa itself,
it embraces more people than Algeria,
Morocco, Ghana or the Congo. It has

untapped quantities of sulphur free oil.
Biafra also exports palm oil and timber,
and has a growing number of fledgling in
dustries. But any nation's greatest asset is
the quality of its people, and Biafra's Ibos
are a more important—and controversial
resource. It has been estimated that in all
black Africa, Biafra has the greatest
amount of trained manpower.
On July 6, Nigeria carried her war of
aggression into Biafran territory in what
she described as police action to crush the
"rebellion" in 48 hours. For 15 months
now, the war has raged on. infiltrated and
encircled, bombed and strafed, cut off by
land and sea and with only a hazardous air
link to the outside world, the Biafrans con
tinue to fight for survival. The Anglo-
Russian-Nigerian Air Force, manned by
Egyptian and South African mercenary
soldiers, has napalmed hospitals, schools,
market places and civilian populations in a
war of genocide against an already injured
people. The story and pictures of starving
Biafran children are no longer strange to
the American people.
In areas that have fallen to the
Nigerians, towns and houses were pillaged
and what could not be stolen was de
stroyed. Men were tortured and shot and
women defiled. If the Nigerian military
campaign has achieved anything, it seems
only a confirmation that the Biafrans have
nothing to expect but slaughter and de
struction.
The sudden international concern for
Biafran lives is yet another example of Big
Power Hypocrisy: "The Biafrans must com
promise so that investments and political
influence in Nigeria will be secure." In the
complex diplomatic negotiations, the pos
ture of the oil companies emerged as criti
cal.
Behind the oil companies' diplomacy

lay not only billions of dollars in assets and
hundreds of millions of dollars in liquid
capital in company treasuries, but also the
combined power of the Dutch and British
Governments, who, with their substantial
stock in Shell and British Petroleum, sus
tained a lively and intimate interest in
Nigerian affairs. Shell and British
Petroleum directors tend to be well con
nected indeed in the circles where British
diplomacy is formulated. These luminaries
of Shell and BP may not run Great Britain,
but when it comes to oil, their counsel is
heeded with scrupulous attention in the
Foreign Office. Moreover, from their per
spective, it must seem that as with General
Motors and the U.S.A., what is good for
the oil companies is good for the country.
Little wonder then that British
bombs, motors, rockets, armored cars,
ships, planes and army officers have found
their way into a foreign land, thousands of
miles away, in search of someone else's oil.
Now Biafra is all theirs—the oil, the land,
destroyed institutions, starving children,
broken families and the dead.
Biafra's real enemies are not only
Nigeria and the international opportunists,
Britain, Russia and Egypt- an unholy al
liance of vested interests- but the civilized
international community which condones
genocide at this period of the twentieth
century.
What is probably no less shocking
than this genocide by the Nigerians is the
insensitivity of the African states to
Biafra's sufferings. The excuse that it might
encourage secession in other parts of Africa
is unfounded, as the examples of Malaysia,
India and Pakistan, Britain and Ireland and,
in Africa, the Mali Federation and Central
African Federation have shown that these
breakups have often been for the better.

In this area, particular mention should
be made of the role of Emperor Haile
Selassie of Ethiopia and President Tubman
of Liberia, the neo-colonialist stooges in
Africa who have spent decade after decade
in office, lavishly spending money from the
Western world for their personal ends, and
offering nothing to the forgotten African.
The International Red Cross, presum
ably a world organization, has achieved
nothing but to prove its gross inefficiency
in handling the Biafran situation. Taking its
cues from Britain, who in turn follows the
policy maneuvers of the Nigerian govern
ment, it has spent more time and money on
cocktail parties than on the challenge
facing it in Biafra. It is only fair to state
her that if white children in this part of the
world had been exposed to one hundredth
of the starvation situation in Biafra, the
Red Cross could have devised a way to
meet the emergency at all costs.

As for the United Nations, it is high
time they seriously considered disbanding.
1 hat a war of genocide was declared might
be understandable, but that today, it
should be allowed to continue and in fact
be encouraged is beyond imagination. It
becomes even more frustrating when we
consider that in South Africa and
Rhodesia, where the white minority is in
power, the British government and others
concerned have not considered it appro
priate to drop an atom of explosive.
The almost-direct Greek-Cypriot mili
tary confrontation was averted when the
Security Council had to meet twenty hours
a day. The Russian occupancy of
Czechoslovakia brought the Security Coun
cil to a round-the-clock meeting. As for the
Biafrans' comrades in suffering, the Israelis,
moral and military assistance have always
been offered them.
What then is different with the Biafran
situation? The language is simple. Who cares
about those "wild"Africans? Who cares
about the dying Biafran child as long as
Britain gets the oil? The facts may someday
shock some people into caring. In the
meantime, Biafra must be prepared to face
the world's insensitivity to her sufferings
and take refuge in the words of that great
American son. Abraham Lincoln, "The pos
sibility that we may fail in the struggle
ought not to deter us from the support of a
cause we believe to be just."
The main point of argument built up
by the Nigerian government is that Nigeria
is a single interdependent economic unit
and that its disintegration will disrupt
established market trends and leave the sep
arate economy that much poorer. It is true
that the economic trend among the regions
of the former Nigerian federation was one
of interdependence; this is equally true of
all world economies which are complemen
tary. But is should not make us try to
force unworkable political patterns on an
unwilling people in order to create a large
market.


THE REPUBLIC OF BIAFRA

It would be sufficient for both sides
to enter into trade and technical
agreements. With more efficient planning,
these separate units could even be made
economically more viable. Perhaps Nigeria
may be poorer for it, and it should have
occurred to its leaders to be more tolerant
of people who they now admit constituted
their wealth. But the rest of Nigeria has the
potential to remain a great and united
African state if its leaders will show realism
and imagination in harnessing their vast
resources.
The Nigerians appear not to realize
that by unleashing a war of genocide to add
to past injustices, they have aroused a
whole people against them. Self
preservation is probably the strongest hu
man instinct, and it is this that compelled
the harassed and persecuted people of the
then Eastern Nigeria to seek refuge in their
own home and among their kindred. It is a
people's war for freedom and the fact of
their independence is irreversible.
As for those individuals who see the
present military situation as victory for
Nigeria, the war is just about to start. It is
unfortunate that no one has taken the time
to tell the American people that for the
Biafrans hunger and starvation, as much as
mortars and tanks, have been weapons
from the beginning of the war; that the
Biafrans have refused to see how people
who have condemned and ignored their
cause from the start, people responsible for
the slaughter of over 500,000 of their
people, starvation of 100,000 people (in
cluding children) a day, destruction of all
institutions, and the breaking up of their
families should suddenly want to save
them; that the British-styled Nigerian lead
ership is and will always be a rickety affair
and that the so-called Nigerian leaders
know as much of neutral unity as baboons
do of atomic nuclear physics; that since the

reason for the genocide was that the
Biafrans always dominated the rest of
Nigeria, they should be left alone to dom
inate themselves; that also concentration
camps have been completed in Northern
Nigeria for the Biafran leaders and intellec
tuals.
Biafrans had a better claim to Nigeria
than any other so-called Nigerians. Biafrans
were the only true Nigerians that ever lived.
They sincerely believed in the unity of
Nigeria and met the challenge of nation
building in the most realistic and effective
manner. Biafrans were expelled from
Nigeria by the very people who were
scarcely Nigerians. That was the excru
ciating but irredeemable tragedy of the
Nigerian predicament. In the circumstances
in which Biafrans recently found them
selves, platitudinous, political, economic
and moral arguments were of no avail. The
instinct of self-preservation had super
vened. Despite the odds of fighting the un
holy Anglo-Russian-Egyptian-Nigerian mar
riage, the evidence is that Biafra has come
to stay.
She has a proud heritage to defend
and preserve. She wants to preserve her
democratic and free institutions as a pro
gressive society unhampered in its progress
and development by the feudalistic and re
actionary forces with which it has been
her misfortune to contend all these years.
While African states are desirous of
belonging to a larger association, they are
at the same time anxious to maintain their
distinctive traditions and interests as well as
their individual political personalities. In
keeping with their decades-old traditions,
the poeple of the Republic of Biafra will
strive to promote the emergence of the
supranational institutions and agencies nec
essary for the realization of these
aspirations and ideals.
