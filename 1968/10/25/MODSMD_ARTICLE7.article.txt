### HYPOLITE AMUZIE 
HYPOLITE AMUZIE is a junior in chemistry from
Biafra. He came to the United States in January
1967, having to travel through the Camerouns
because no one from the then Eastern Nigeria
could travel through Nigerian territory without
being shot. He intends to return to Biafra afttr
completing medical school.

One of the factors which contributed
to the creation of the Independent and
Sovereign State of Biafra was the inability
of the different ethnic groups within the
defunct Nigerian Federation to get along
together. Nigeria, one of the West African
countries, was until May 1967 about four
and a half times the size of Great Britain.
Her population, according to the controver
sial census of 1963, was about 55 million.
The country encompassed more than 50
ethnic groups, each with its own distinctive
culture, language and religion. The three
largest of these ethnic groups were the
Yorubas in the West (partly Moslems and
partly Christians), the Moslem Hausas in
the North, and the Ibos, most of whom are
Christians, in what was then Eastern
Nigeria.
Until May 30, 1967, to a casual ob
server, Nigeria retained much ot the pro
gressive, constructive, enlightened aura that
had surrounded it since it won its inde
pendence from Great Britain. To many, it
not only exemplified the promise ot re
sponsible government in Africa but also
retained the image of a showpiece ol
African democracy. But in reality, Nigeria
had been on the brink of disintegration
ever since May 1966, when political up
heaval, anarchy, rioting and pogrom made
of Nigeria a house divided by dissension
and suspicion.
Ever since the North and South of
Nigeria were amalgamated by the British in
1914 for administrative purposes, the fact
of the existence of widely diverging intra
national cultures has been as obvious as the
events of May 196*7 demonstrated. It is sig
nificant however, that the Northern
political leaders insisted on emphasizing
these differences during the fifty years

when Nigeria apparently existed as a polit
ical entity.
This attitude of the North is sum
marized by James Coleman in his book
Nigeria,- Background to Nationalism:
"Until 1950 Northern Nigeria was largely
unaffected by the growing forces of nation
alism then centered in the cities of
Southern Nigeria. As Southern Nationalists
cast their recruiting nets ever wider and
sought an alliance with incipient
nationalists in the North, the Fulani Aris
tocracy, aided by the British
administration, organized a counter
nationalist party into which Northerners
were inducted to defend gradualism and
the emigrant system."
Small wonder then that Southerners
who genuinely accepted amalgamation and
took its implications seriously by
emigrating to and investing their resources
in the North, were looked upon by North
erners as "native foreigners," who had
come to dominate the indigenous people
and exploit their resources. A sort of
"apartheid" policy was in vogue in North
ern Nigeria against these "native
foreigners" as they were kept in
"Sabongaris" (Stranger Settlements) quite
distinct from the Birni (walled towns) of
the indigenes.
Consequently, separate institutions
schools, colleges, police and courts-were
established and developed for the North
erners on the one hand and their "foreign"
countrymen on the other. 1 his practice
helped to worsen and prolong the uneven
educational and economic development of
the North and South-a process which
began in the mid-nineteenth century when
European Christian missions started to op
erate in the South but were debarred by
Northern Moslems from operating in the
North.
The Northerners' unfair treatment of
Southerners as foreigners and the persistent
disinclination of Northerners to identify
themselves with the rest of the country ac
counted in great measure for the unequal
vote of development evident in the social
and economic as well as the political life of

the North and the South. Mallam (after
wards Alhaji) Abubakar Tafawa Balewa,
late Prime Minister of Nigeria, summarized
the Northern position vis-a-vis the rest of
Nigeria in a speech before the new Legis
lative Council in April 1947: "1 think 1947
will always stand as a very important year
in the history of Nigeria. Since the amalga
mation of the Southern and Northern
Provinces in 1914, Nigeria has existed as
one country only on paper. "
It is clear that Northern Nigeria never
wanted a United Nigeria, even under con
ditions guaranteeing her domination over
the rest of the country. Consequently,
Northern domination over the political life
of the federation could offer no leadership
committed to a united Nigeria.
By January 1966, many Nigerians had
become highly dissatisfied with the state of
affairs in the country. The already existing
tension was worsened by the arrangement
whereby the North had a constitutional
stranglehold on the South-East, Mid-West
and West. The North had a built-in 50%
representation at the centre and was
assured of permanent control of the federal
government.
On January 21, 1966, a columnist of
the New Statesman of London aptly
referred to the late Head of the Nigeria gov
ernment, Sir Abubakar as "Prime-Minister
in-Apparent-Perpetuity." While Abubakar
was in Lagos enjoying the fruits of self gov
ernment for which he scarcely worked, his
people in the North were fettered by the
chains of tradition. They preferred Arabic
laws and courts to the Nigerian legal sys
tem. And while Northernization was the
policy in the North, Nigerianization was be
ing pursued in the South.
Consequently, in the first five years
following independence, one political crisis
followed another in rapid succession. Each
crisis presaged a final disintegration of the
country. As each was eventually patched
up through compromise, Nigeria became
notorious for her giddy brinkmanship. In
1964-65 there were 195 strikes involving
68,000 workers and the loss of 205,000
