# Falstaff's Welles
## 
### Chris Morris 
Let me set down a few of my basic
biases. First: that I believe that Orson
Welles is the greatest filmmaker of the
sound period America has ever produced.
Second: that Citizen Kane is one of the
most exhilirating Films I have ever seen.
Third: that Welles, while he has suffered no
depreciation in talent, has met an industrial
downfall that forces him to make Films for
peanuts in Europe. Fourth: that Falstaff
amazingly enough considering the condi
tions the director had to work under, is one
of the few masterpieces that the screen has
produced in the 1960'5, decade of The
Sound of Music.
From these four premises (opinions?)
a kind of obscure perspective can be gained
on Orson Welles' career up to this point.
An understanding of Citizen Kane and
Tinseltown is necessary if one is to realize
the accomplishment of Falstaff in 1968.

"Charles Fostef Kane was a man who got
everything he wanted, and then lost

it."-Thompson (William Alland) in Citizen
Kane, 1941.
Orson Welles had almost nothing more
to gain when he came to Hollywood in
1940. He had successfully scared the
bejeezus out of the populace of New Jersey
and New York. He had a popular radio
series. He had put on startling dramatic
productions. He was only 24.
He made Citizen Kane.
Kane knocked Hollywood for a loop.
Having a story line rather blatantly analo
gous to the career of publisher William
Randolph Hearst, the film was, as Peter
Bogdanovitch says, "a treasure chest of the
screen-language." It collected the best of
Murnau, Renoir, Teutonic expressionism,
and threw in a large portion of American
zap! Great indelible scenes .are crowded
into the film. To refresh the memory: the
raucous party in the newspaper office,
replete with chorines; the marriage breakup
montage, Susan's opera debut, the mock
"March of Time."
The only problem with Citizen Kane
was that its material somewhat stood in the

way of its release. The film took a bitter
;v look at an industrial titan.
The titans looked back.
Welles, at the hands of Louis B.
Mayer, William Randolph Hearst, and
Lollie Parsons, suffered a set-back as great
as the celluloid fall of Charles Foster Kane.
Citizen Kane made a country-wide thud at
the boxoffice that was loud enough to be
heard with clarity at the RKO front office.
Welles, humbled somewhat, tried to
forge another masterwork. The Magnificent
Ambersons was taken out of his hands and
edited by studio hacks. It contains charac
teristic Welles brilliance, but it is half a
film, having been left impotent by a cutting
room splicer.
Welles was to make other films in the
Movie Capitol, but they suffer from the
same studio-enforced anemia that
Ambersons does.
Welles, after many years, did as the
wise man should do. He fled.

"Welles didn't need to choose the role of
Falstaff: it chose him."-Pauline Kael
Welles' career as a director has been
somewhat overshadowed since the halcyon
days of the '40's by his career as an actor,
playing his roles in private and public.
He has worked in such uniquely
horrendous films as The Black Rose, David
and Goliath, and that blockbuster bomb
Casino Royale. He recently made an ap
pearance on Dean Martin's TV show, re
citing Shakespeare and shaking a phony
mop of hair in a lowbrow parody of hippie
dom.
This trashy work is directed toward
good works, as a Lutheran would put it.
Shunned by the Hollywood powers-that-be
25 years ago, Welles is forced to work in a
hand-to-mouth fashion. He capitalizes on
Hollywood's demands for his talents as an
actor to get enough money to shoot fims
on the continent, which is now the scene of
all his directorial ventures.
Films such as Falstaff.
The director's poverty pocket style of
filmmaking comes into focus in this produc
tion. Sir John Gielgud, Sir Ralph
Richardson, Jeanne Moreau and Margaret
Rutherford all agreed to work for salaries
usually reserved for grips or wardrobe mis
tresses. The production was filmed in

Spain, an economical country for film
making. From time to time the filming was
broken off so that Welles could chase away
to act in order to raise capital for further
shooting.
Yet the film is brilliant. Welles returns
to freedom of production once more and
displays the genius present in Citizen Kane
again. Pauline Kael beefs about the poor
sound track and the director's penchant for
false noses, but she has always been a bit of
a kvetch.
The film is a loose digestion of scenes
from Henry IV and The Merry Wives of
Windsor which centers around the
boisterous title character and his exploits in
taverns, in battle and with the King of
England. Welles, in his conceit, chose his
part well (or rather the part chose him
well); he plays the old ruffian marvelously.
There are scenes in Falstaff which
rank among the best any filmmaker has yet
conceived. There is a short pre-credit scene,
a walk in the cold morning, which is un
equaled in its serenity. There are raucous
drinking scenes and a robbery bursting with
comedy. There is a battle, stark in black
and white, which must rank as one of the
most stunning scenes since the climactic
foray in Seven Samurai. And there is a final
renunciation scene in which Welles acts
with more sensitivity than he ever has be
fore.
Here is Shakespeare at his liveliest, in
the best screen translation since Olivier
took up the banner.
Weaker men than Orson Welles have
been raped by Hollywood.
Welles has found his element in
Europe and has the will to work. His rejec
tion by Hollywood makes no difference to
him. His ever-lengthening list of unfinished
project bespeaks his continuing fascination
for the medium. He will continue to film,
despite instability, insolvency, and sporad
ically.
Orson Welles is only 53. His career is
far from over, although it has already been
full and turbulent.
There's life in the old kid yet.
"ORSON WELLES is a giant with
birds and shadows, a dog who has broken
loose from his chains and gone to sleep
on the flower bed. Ho is an active loafer,
a wise madman, a solitude surrounded by
humanity."
- Jean Cocteau, poet and filmmaker

comedy. There is a battle, stark in black

"ORSON WELLES is a giant with

loose from his chains and gone to sleep
on the flower bed. Ho is an active loafer,
a wise madman, a solitude surrounded by
humanity."
- Jean Cocteau, poet and filmmaker
Let me set down a few of my basic
biases. First: that I believe that Orson
Welles is the greatest filmmaker of the
sound period America has ever produced.
Second: that Citizen Kane is one of the
most exhilirating Films I have ever seen.
Third: that Welles, while he has suffered no
depreciation in talent, has met an industrial
downfall that forces him to make Films for
peanuts in Europe. Fourth: that Falstaff
amazingly enough considering the condi
tions the director had to work under, is one
of the few masterpieces that the screen has
produced in the 1960'5, decade of The
Sound of Music.
From these four premises (opinions?)
a kind of obscure perspective can be gained
on Orson Welles' career up to this point.
An understanding of Citizen Kane and
Tinseltown is necessary if one is to realize
the accomplishment of Falstaff in 1968.

Orson Welles had almost nothing more
to gain when he came to Hollywood in
1940. He had successfully scared the
bejeezus out of the populace of New Jersey
and New York. He had a popular radio
series. He had put on startling dramatic
productions. He was only 24.
He made Citizen Kane.
Kane knocked Hollywood for a loop.
Having a story line rather blatantly analo

Randolph Hearst, the film was, as Peter
Bogdanovitch says, "a treasure chest of the
screen-language." It collected the best of

Welles, at the hands of Louis B.

Lollie Parsons, suffered a set-back as great

Citizen Kane made a country-wide thud at
the boxoffice that was loud enough to be

Welles, humbled somewhat, tried to
forge another masterwork. The Magnificent
Ambersons was taken out of his hands and
edited by studio hacks. It contains charac

film, having been left impotent by a cutting

"Welles didn't need to choose the role of
Falstaff: it chose him."-Pauline Kael
Welles' career as a director has been
somewhat overshadowed since the halcyon
days of the '40's by his career as an actor,
playing his roles in private and public.
He has worked in such uniquely
horrendous films as The Black Rose, David
and Goliath, and that blockbuster bomb
Casino Royale. He recently made an ap
pearance on Dean Martin's TV show, re
citing Shakespeare and shaking a phony
mop of hair in a lowbrow parody of hippie
dom.
This trashy work is directed toward
good works, as a Lutheran would put it.
Shunned by the Hollywood powers-that-be
25 years ago, Welles is forced to work in a
hand-to-mouth fashion. He capitalizes on
Hollywood's demands for his talents as an
actor to get enough money to shoot fims
on the continent, which is now the scene of
all his directorial ventures.
Films such as Falstaff.
The director's poverty pocket style of
filmmaking comes into focus in this produc
tion. Sir John Gielgud, Sir Ralph
Richardson, Jeanne Moreau and Margaret
Rutherford all agreed to work for salaries
usually reserved for grips or wardrobe mis
tresses. The production was filmed in

Spain, an economical country for film
making. From time to time the filming was
broken off so that Welles could chase away
to act in order to raise capital for further
shooting.
Yet the film is brilliant. Welles returns
to freedom of production once more and
displays the genius present in Citizen Kane
again. Pauline Kael beefs about the poor
sound track and the director's penchant for
false noses, but she has always been a bit of
a kvetch.
The film is a loose digestion of scenes
from Henry IV and The Merry Wives of
Windsor which centers around the
boisterous title character and his exploits in
taverns, in battle and with the King of
England. Welles, in his conceit, chose his
part well (or rather the part chose him

Spain, an economical country for film
making. From time to time the filming was
broken off so that Welles could chase away
to act in order to raise capital for further
shooting.
Yet the film is brilliant. Welles returns
to freedom of production once more and
displays the genius present in Citizen Kane
again. Pauline Kael beefs about the poor
sound track and the director's penchant for
false noses, but she has always been a bit of
a kvetch.
The film is a loose digestion of scenes
from Henry IV and The Merry Wives of
Windsor which centers around the
boisterous title character and his exploits in
taverns, in battle and with the King of
England. Welles, in his conceit, chose his
part well (or rather the part chose him
well); he plays the old ruffian marvelously.
There are scenes in Falstaff which
rank among the best any filmmaker has yet
conceived. There is a short pre-credit scene,
a walk in the cold morning, which is un
equaled in its serenity. There are raucous
drinking scenes and a robbery bursting with
comedy. There is a battle, stark in black
and white, which must rank as one of the
most stunning scenes since the climactic
foray in Seven Samurai. And there is a final
renunciation scene in which Welles acts
with more sensitivity than he ever has be

"ORSON WELLES is a giant with

loose from his chains and gone to sleep
on the flower bed. Ho is an active loafer,
a wise madman, a solitude surrounded by
humanity."
- Jean Cocteau, poet and filmmaker
Let me set down a few of my basic
biases. First: that I believe that Orson
Welles is the greatest filmmaker of the
sound period America has ever produced.
Second: that Citizen Kane is one of the
most exhilirating Films I have ever seen.
Third: that Welles, while he has suffered no
depreciation in talent, has met an industrial
downfall that forces him to make Films for
peanuts in Europe. Fourth: that Falstaff
amazingly enough considering the condi
tions the director had to work under, is one
of the few masterpieces that the screen has
produced in the 1960'5, decade of The
Sound of Music.
From these four premises (opinions?)
a kind of obscure perspective can be gained
on Orson Welles' career up to this point.
An understanding of Citizen Kane and
Tinseltown is necessary if one is to realize
the accomplishment of Falstaff in 1968.

Orson Welles had almost nothing more

He made Citizen Kane.

Welles, humbled somewhat, tried to

Citizen Kane made a country-wide thud at
the boxoffice that was loud enough to be
heard with clarity at the RKO front office.
Welles, humbled somewhat, tried to
forge another masterwork. The Magnificent
Ambersons was taken out of his hands and
edited by studio hacks. It contains charac
teristic Welles brilliance, but it is half a
film, having been left impotent by a cutting
room splicer.
Welles was to make other films in the
Movie Capitol, but they suffer from the
same studio-enforced anemia that
Ambersons does.
Welles, after many years, did as the
wise man should do. He fled.

Orson Welles' FALSTAFF will be shown at

"Welles didn't need to choose the role of
Falstaff: it chose him."-Pauline Kael
Welles' career as a director has been
somewhat overshadowed since the halcyon
days of the '40's by his career as an actor,
playing his roles in private and public.
He has worked in such uniquely
horrendous films as The Black Rose, David
and Goliath, and that blockbuster bomb
Casino Royale. He recently made an ap
pearance on Dean Martin's TV show, re
citing Shakespeare and shaking a phony
mop of hair in a lowbrow parody of hippie
dom.
This trashy work is directed toward
good works, as a Lutheran would put it.
Shunned by the Hollywood powers-that-be
25 years ago, Welles is forced to work in a
hand-to-mouth fashion. He capitalizes on
Hollywood's demands for his talents as an
actor to get enough money to shoot fims
on the continent, which is now the scene of
all his directorial ventures.
Films such as Falstaff.
The director's poverty pocket style of
filmmaking comes into focus in this produc
tion. Sir John Gielgud, Sir Ralph
Richardson, Jeanne Moreau and Margaret
Rutherford all agreed to work for salaries
usually reserved for grips or wardrobe mis
tresses. The production was filmed in

Spain, an economical country for film
making. From time to time the filming was
broken off so that Welles could chase away
to act in order to raise capital for further
shooting.
Yet the film is brilliant. Welles returns
to freedom of production once more and
displays the genius present in Citizen Kane
again. Pauline Kael beefs about the poor
sound track and the director's penchant for
false noses, but she has always been a bit of
a kvetch.
The film is a loose digestion of scenes
from Henry IV and The Merry Wives of
Windsor which centers around the
boisterous title character and his exploits in
taverns, in battle and with the King of
England. Welles, in his conceit, chose his
part well (or rather the part chose him
well); he plays the old ruffian marvelously.
There are scenes in Falstaff which
rank among the best any filmmaker has yet
conceived. There is a short pre-credit scene,
a walk in the cold morning, which is un
equaled in its serenity. There are raucous
drinking scenes and a robbery bursting with
comedy. There is a battle, stark in black
and white, which must rank as one of the
most stunning scenes since the climactic
foray in Seven Samurai. And there is a final
renunciation scene in which Welles acts
with more sensitivity than he ever has be
fore.
Here is Shakespeare at his liveliest, in
the best screen translation since Olivier
took up the banner.
Weaker men than Orson Welles have
been raped by Hollywood.
Welles has found his element in
Europe and has the will to work. His rejec
tion by Hollywood makes no difference to
him. His ever-lengthening list of unfinished
project bespeaks his continuing fascination
for the medium. He will continue to film,
despite instability, insolvency, and sporad
ically.
Orson Welles is only 53. His career is
far from over, although it has already been
full and turbulent.
There's life in the old kid yet.
"ORSON WELLES is a giant with
birds and shadows, a dog who has broken
loose from his chains and gone to sleep
on the flower bed. Ho is an active loafer,
a wise madman, a solitude surrounded by
humanity."
- Jean Cocteau, poet and filmmaker
