# Falstaff's Welles

### Chris Morris 
Let me set down a few of my basic
biases. First: that I believe that Orson
Welles is the greatest filmmaker of the
sound period America has ever produced.
Second: that Citizen Kane is one of the
most exhilirating Films I have ever seen.
Third: that Welles, while he has suffered no
depreciation in talent, has met an industrial
downfall that forces him to make Films for
peanuts in Europe. Fourth: that Falstaff
amazingly enough considering the condi
tions the director had to work under, is one
of the few masterpieces that the screen has
produced in the 1960'5, decade of The
Sound of Music.
From these four premises (opinions?)
a kind of obscure perspective can be gained
on Orson Welles' career up to this point.
An understanding of Citizen Kane and
Tinseltown is necessary if one is to realize
the accomplishment of Falstaff in 1968.

Orson Welles had almost nothing more
to gain when he came to Hollywood in
1940. He had successfully scared the
bejeezus out of the populace of New Jersey
and New York. He had a popular radio
series. He had put on startling dramatic
productions. He was only 24.
He made Citizen Kane.
Kane knocked Hollywood for a loop.
Having a story line rather blatantly analo
gous to the career of publisher William
Randolph Hearst, the film was, as Peter
Bogdanovitch says, "a treasure chest of the
screen-language." It collected the best of
Murnau, Renoir, Teutonic expressionism,
and threw in a large portion of American
zap! Great indelible scenes .are crowded
into the film. To refresh the memory: the
raucous party in the newspaper office,
replete with chorines; the marriage breakup
montage, Susan's opera debut, the mock
"March of Time."
The only problem with Citizen Kane
was that its material somewhat stood in the
