Graduates from the Graduate School of Business Admin
istration at UCLA have become involved in a multitude of
interesting activities—working with the governments of de
veloping countries, with organizations attempting to deal with
urban problems, in administrative positions in various educa
tional and governmental institutions, and in a wide range of
positions with business organizations. The students and faculty
of the School, who have backgrounds ranging from anthro
pology to engineering to literature, have come together around
the study of the functioning and administration of complex
organizations. Although one of the central concerns of the
School is the study of business organizations, we are also
interested in the management of all types of complex organi
zations.
The programs offered by the School reflect this breadth of
interest. We have relatively specialized programs of study
(M.S., Ph.D.) in each of the major sub-fields and supporting
disciplines of administration such as operation management,
behavioral science, urban land economics, finance, quantita
tive methods, international and comparative management,
and marketing.
We also have a two-year professional program in admin
istration (MBA) which is intended to provide individuals with
a broad understanding of organizations to enable them to
take postions of leadership, whatever the organizational set
ting. All these programs are available for people from any
undergraduate field.
If you are a senior or a graduate students and would like
to discusss the relevance of any of these programs or graduate
business education in general to your background and expec
tations for the future, we would like to meet with you on
campus on Tuesday, October 29. You can make an appoint
ment at the Placement Office.
