# New Politics Committee
## 'Elect Cranston' 
### DAVID DAVENPORT 
Faced With what they con
sider a disappointing presiden
tial choice, many students have
turned to the Stanford Com
mittee for a New Democratic
Politics for involvement in the
fall election.
"Our number one priority,"
according to Dave Jones, leader
of the committee, "is to elect
Alan Cranston." Jones claims to
have three times more campus
workers than the Democratic
presidential ticket.
The Stanford Committee for a
New Democratic Politics is a
reworking of many of the old
McCarthy supporters. After the
Democratic National Conven
tion, the organization decided to
follow McCarthy's example and
campaign for local candidates
than support the presidential
slate.
The committee is now organ
ized to work in two roles. One
aspect of the work includes pre
cinct campaigning and distribu
tion of literature. The other
function is sponsoring educa
tional projects, such as guest
lectures, to promote the commit
tee's views on political issues.
Committee Approval
Three candidates have re
ceived the approval of the com
mittee: Alan Cranston, Demo
cratic candidate for the U.S.
Senate; Don Edwards, incum
bent Democratic candidate for
Congress, from San Jose; and
Martin Gorfinkel, Democratic
candidate for the State Assem
bly, from Santa Clara County.
On two successive Sunday after
noons, the committee has sent
thirty-five workers into areas

precincts to distribute literature
and talk to voters about these
candidates.
However the committee claims
to have approximately 130 "ac
tive" members. Not all of them
are involved in the precinct
work. Some do office work,
which entails preparing litera
ture for distribution and mailing
information to students and fac
ulty to promote the New Demo
cratic Politics Committee.
Recently the committee has
started to work in a new area
of campaigning. Under the di
rection of Bob Stern, a graduate
student in Law, about twenty
students from the Law School
have been campaigning in shop
ping centers. Not bowing to the
traditional balloons and buttons
approach in shopping centers,
these students distribute litera
ture, exchange bumper stickers
for "contributions", and try to
talk to the voters.
Good Response
So far this aspect of the work
has been done inside Mayfield
Mall and outside other area
shopping centers. According to
Stern, the campaigners have
met with "very good response."
This style of campaigning will
probably be expanded to include
most Santa Clara County shop
ping centers on the remaining
pre-election weekends.
Will Cranston beat Rafferty?
"Definitely," most committee
members resound. But the con
census on victory may be pro
ducing one of Cranston's great
est problems. Jones, however,
feels that overconfidence is not
a factor affecting the committee
members.

"We are very conscious of the
fact that Rafferty has three mil
lion dollars in the kitty, and
will be presenting a TV blitz in
the last week of the campaign,"
he notes. But this attitude
doesn't seem to spread to the
rest of the campus.
Mobilize Workers
Many Stanford students cite
Cranston's certain victory as a
reason for not campaigning. But
Jones still hopes to mobilize
some of these potential workers
before November. Rafferty, in
his final week blitz, will try to
come over "as the kind, soft
spoken friend of the voter," he
warns.
Concerning the second role,
education, it's difficult to deter
mine precisely what political
philosophies the committee em
braces. Their primary interests
are peace in Vietnam and racial
justice. It could probably be
said that their philosophy runs
parallel to McCarthy's views.
This role in education is ex
pected to expand considerably
after the November elections.
The committee has already spon
sored the appearances of Eld
ridge Cleaver, Terry Francois,
and Eugene McCarthy.
They refuse to endorse "just
anything the Democratic ma
chine throws out." Among the
machine products they won't
support is Hubert Humphrey.

steering committee cannot in

Faced With what they con

tial choice, many students have
turned to the Stanford Com
mittee for a New Democratic
Politics for involvement in the
fall election.
"Our number one priority,"
according to Dave Jones, leader
of the committee, "is to elect
Alan Cranston." Jones claims to
have three times more campus
workers than the Democratic
presidential ticket.
The Stanford Committee for a
New Democratic Politics is a
reworking of many of the old
McCarthy supporters. After the
Democratic National Conven
tion, the organization decided to
follow McCarthy's example and
campaign for local candidates
than support the presidential
slate.
The committee is now organ
ized to work in two roles. One
aspect of the work includes pre
cinct campaigning and distribu
tion of literature. The other
function is sponsoring educa
tional projects, such as guest
lectures, to promote the commit
tee's views on political issues.
Committee Approval
Three candidates have re
ceived the approval of the com
mittee: Alan Cranston, Demo
cratic candidate for the U.S.
Senate; Don Edwards, incum
bent Democratic candidate for
Congress, from San Jose; and
Martin Gorfinkel, Democratic
candidate for the State Assem
bly, from Santa Clara County.
On two successive Sunday after
noons, the committee has sent
thirty-five workers into areas

precincts to distribute literature
and talk to voters about these
candidates.
However the committee claims
to have approximately 130 "ac
tive" members. Not all of them
are involved in the precinct
work. Some do office work,
which entails preparing litera
ture for distribution and mailing
information to students and fac
ulty to promote the New Demo
cratic Politics Committee.
Recently the committee has
started to work in a new area
of campaigning. Under the di
rection of Bob Stern, a graduate
student in Law, about twenty
students from the Law School
have been campaigning in shop
ping centers. Not bowing to the
traditional balloons and buttons
approach in shopping centers,
these students distribute litera
ture, exchange bumper stickers
for "contributions", and try to
talk to the voters.
Good Response
So far this aspect of the work
has been done inside Mayfield
Mall and outside other area
shopping centers. According to
Stern, the campaigners have
met with "very good response."
This style of campaigning will
probably be expanded to include
most Santa Clara County shop
ping centers on the remaining
pre-election weekends.
Will Cranston beat Rafferty?
"Definitely," most committee
members resound. But the con
census on victory may be pro
ducing one of Cranston's great
est problems. Jones, however,
feels that overconfidence is not

they're not all college students.
Everyone has a right to live.
Change should come about
through educating and convinc
ing these Americans of the
needs that are present. You
might say we want to propagate
constructive radicalism."
Faced With what they con
sider a disappointing presiden
tial choice, many students have
turned to the Stanford Com
mittee for a New Democratic
Politics for involvement in the
fall election.
"Our number one priority,"
according to Dave Jones, leader
of the committee, "is to elect
Alan Cranston." Jones claims to
have three times more campus
workers than the Democratic
presidential ticket.
The Stanford Committee for a
New Democratic Politics is a
reworking of many of the old
McCarthy supporters. After the
Democratic National Conven
tion, the organization decided to
follow McCarthy's example and
campaign for local candidates
than support the presidential
slate.
The committee is now organ
ized to work in two roles. One
aspect of the work includes pre
cinct campaigning and distribu
tion of literature. The other
function is sponsoring educa
tional projects, such as guest
lectures, to promote the commit
tee's views on political issues.
Committee Approval
Three candidates have re
ceived the approval of the com
mittee: Alan Cranston, Demo
cratic candidate for the U.S.
Senate; Don Edwards, incum
bent Democratic candidate for
Congress, from San Jose; and
Martin Gorfinkel, Democratic
candidate for the State Assem
bly, from Santa Clara County.
On two successive Sunday after
noons, the committee has sent
thirty-five workers into areas

precincts to distribute literature
and talk to voters about these
candidates.
However the committee claims
to have approximately 130 "ac
tive" members. Not all of them
are involved in the precinct
work. Some do office work,
which entails preparing litera
ture for distribution and mailing
information to students and fac
ulty to promote the New Demo
cratic Politics Committee.
Recently the committee has
started to work in a new area
of campaigning. Under the di
rection of Bob Stern, a graduate
student in Law, about twenty
students from the Law School
have been campaigning in shop
ping centers. Not bowing to the
traditional balloons and buttons
approach in shopping centers,
these students distribute litera
ture, exchange bumper stickers
for "contributions", and try to
talk to the voters.
Good Response
So far this aspect of the work
has been done inside Mayfield
Mall and outside other area
shopping centers. According to
Stern, the campaigners have
met with "very good response."
This style of campaigning will
probably be expanded to include
most Santa Clara County shop
ping centers on the remaining
pre-election weekends.
Will Cranston beat Rafferty?
"Definitely," most committee
members resound. But the con
census on victory may be pro
ducing one of Cranston's great
est problems. Jones, however,
feels that overconfidence is not
a factor affecting the committee
members.

"We are very conscious of the
fact that Rafferty has three mil
lion dollars in the kitty, and
will be presenting a TV blitz in
the last week of the campaign,"
he notes. But this attitude
doesn't seem to spread to the
rest of the campus.
Mobilize Workers
Many Stanford students cite
Cranston's certain victory as a
reason for not campaigning. But
Jones still hopes to mobilize
some of these potential workers
before November. Rafferty, in
his final week blitz, will try to
come over "as the kind, soft
spoken friend of the voter," he
warns.
Concerning the second role,
education, it's difficult to deter
mine precisely what political
philosophies the committee em
braces. Their primary interests
are peace in Vietnam and racial
justice. It could probably be
said that their philosophy runs
parallel to McCarthy's views.
This role in education is ex
pected to expand considerably
after the November elections.
The committee has already spon
sored the appearances of Eld
ridge Cleaver, Terry Francois,
and Eugene McCarthy.
They refuse to endorse "just
anything the Democratic ma
chine throws out." Among the
machine products they won't
support is Hubert Humphrey.
