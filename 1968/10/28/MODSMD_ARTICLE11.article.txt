# Grape Boycott Activity
## Shop-In Disrupts Safeway 
### 
Over 30 shopping carts full of
groceries were left in the aisles
of the Safeway food store, 525 El
Camino Real, Menlo Park, Fri
day afternoon, as the "park-in"
sponsored by the Stanford Grape
Boycott Committee turned into
a "shop-in".
Unlike last week's action
against the Safeway store in
Palo Alto, officials Friday knew
in advance of the committee's
plans and requested Menlo Park
police to stay away from the
store, preferring to handle the
situation themselves.
David Mitchell, a Safeway pub
lic relations man from the divi
sion office in San Francisco, was
at the store to explain and de
fend Safeway's position in the
grape controversy.
Up To The Consumer
He stated that Safeway was
"leaving it up to the consumer.
If the consumer wants to boy
cott, OK, this is why we are not
against an informational picket
line, but when people destroy
property, this is not permissi
ble."
Mitchell was referring to the
alleged damage to some food
stuffs in the Safeway store in

Palo Alto last week by boycott
supporters.
Alan Pick, a Stanford law stu
dent and committee spokesman,
stated the committee's position.
"We are asking simply that the
grape workers have the same
rights as other unions. Right
now all they want is an election
to decide if they want a union."
Mitchell replied that Safeway
was union-oriented and they han
dle union products. He said,
"You're assuming that these are
non-union grapes. We are get
ting them through channels and
they are handled by union peo
ple."
The committee did not have
enough cars to fill the lot and
shoppers were able to park and
enter the store.
Once, the air was let out of a
tire on a white Volkswagen and
it was driven to the middle of
a traffic lane in the parking lot
where several people, who ap
peared to be boycott supporters,
began changing the "flat". Sev
eral other people driving trucks
stopped to "help", thus com
pletely blocking the lane. A con
frontation deve'oped, and a store
official said, "Move it before the

police get here." The tire-chang
ing operation, which took 45
minutes and attracted much at
tention, was completed just be
fore the arrival of a Menlo Park
police car.
Who Called Police?
Safeway officials denied call
ing the police and said they did
n't know who did. After talking
with store officials for several
minutes, the officer left.
After the "park-in" ended at
six, Mitchell was upset over the
condition of the store. Regarding
the abandoned shopping carts,
he said, "It will cost a consider
able amount to re-shelve these
goods. Some of it is damaged
or destroyed and will have to
be thrown out."

A woman shopper in the store
commented, "I think it's terrible.
They load the carts and leave
them all over the store. They
take ice cream and put it in the
dry goods to melt all over the
cereal. I don't see that."
Orie L. Meridith, the store
manager, commented, "I've been
a friend of Stanford for 37 years.
This isn't Stanford."
He stated that a Stanford stu
dent had come up to him and
said, "We hate this and I want
to apologize for it."
Another shopper looked at the
store and the people outside and
said, "Just for selling grapes?
You've got to be kidding."

them all over the store. They
take ice cream and put it in the
dry goods to melt all over the
cereal. I don't see that."
Orie L. Meridith, the store
manager, commented, "I've been
a friend of Stanford for 37 years.
This isn't Stanford."
He stated that a Stanford stu
dent had come up to him and
said, "We hate this and I want
to apologize for it."
Another shopper looked at the
store and the people outside and
said, "Just for selling grapes?
You've got to be kidding."
Over 30 shopping carts full of
groceries were left in the aisles
of the Safeway food store, 525 El
Camino Real, Menlo Park, Fri
day afternoon, as the "park-in"
sponsored by the Stanford Grape
Boycott Committee turned into
a "shop-in".
Unlike last week's action
against the Safeway store in
Palo Alto, officials Friday knew
in advance of the committee's
plans and requested Menlo Park
police to stay away from the
store, preferring to handle the
situation themselves.
David Mitchell, a Safeway pub
lic relations man from the divi
sion office in San Francisco, was
at the store to explain and de
fend Safeway's position in the
grape controversy.
Up To The Consumer
He stated that Safeway was
"leaving it up to the consumer.
If the consumer wants to boy
cott, OK, this is why we are not
against an informational picket
line, but when people destroy
property, this is not permissi
ble."
Mitchell was referring to the
alleged damage to some food
stuffs in the Safeway store in

Palo Alto last week by boycott
supporters.
Alan Pick, a Stanford law stu
dent and committee spokesman,
stated the committee's position.
"We are asking simply that the
grape workers have the same
rights as other unions. Right
now all they want is an election
to decide if they want a union."
Mitchell replied that Safeway
was union-oriented and they han
dle union products. He said,
"You're assuming that these are
non-union grapes. We are get
ting them through channels and
they are handled by union peo
ple."
The committee did not have
enough cars to fill the lot and
shoppers were able to park and
enter the store.
Once, the air was let out of a
tire on a white Volkswagen and
it was driven to the middle of
a traffic lane in the parking lot
where several people, who ap
peared to be boycott supporters,
began changing the "flat". Sev
eral other people driving trucks
stopped to "help", thus com
pletely blocking the lane. A con
frontation deve'oped, and a store
official said, "Move it before the

police get here." The tire-chang
ing operation, which took 45
minutes and attracted much at
tention, was completed just be
fore the arrival of a Menlo Park
police car.
Who Called Police?
Safeway officials denied call
ing the police and said they did
n't know who did. After talking
with store officials for several
minutes, the officer left.
After the "park-in" ended at
six, Mitchell was upset over the
condition of the store. Regarding
the abandoned shopping carts,
he said, "It will cost a consider
able amount to re-shelve these
goods. Some of it is damaged
or destroyed and will have to
be thrown out."

A woman shopper in the store
commented, "I think it's terrible.
They load the carts and leave
them all over the store. They
take ice cream and put it in the
dry goods to melt all over the
cereal. I don't see that."
Orie L. Meridith, the store
