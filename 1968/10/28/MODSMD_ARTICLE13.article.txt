# Profs Bach, Gurley Debate Merits Of Galbraith Theory
## 
### HUGH WONG 
Corporate power in the United
States is undergoing a shift in
its power structure, observes
John Kenneth Galbraith in his
book, The New Industrial State.
The decisions of private indus
try are no longer in the hands
of the "entrepeneurial capital
ists", as in the days of J. P. Mor
gan, but now are invested in the
experts—engineers, business and
law school graduates, mathema
ticians, and scientists, who make
up what Galbraith calls the
"technostructure".
The implications of this power
shift for American society were
discussed last Friday by two
Stanford professors, John Gur
ley of the Economics Dept., and
George L. Bach of the Business
School, in a debate sponsored by
the Graduate Student Associa
tion.
Prof. Gurley basically agrees
with Galbraith's assertion that
the technostructure, in order to
maintain its power within socie
ty, must impose its own values
upon the members of that so
ciety. In order to stabilize the

demand for the products of pri
vate industry, for example, the
technostructure must propagate
the idea that more money,
goods, and high consumption
are goals to be strived for.
'Prostitution of Education'
This power structure, says
Gurley, has ramifications for
such interests as educational in
stitutions, military spending and
government research. Institu
tions of higher education supply
the scientists, mathematicians,
and businessmen which com
prise the technostructure itself.
This has led to a "prostitution
of education" which channels its
endeavors into areas useful to
business and industry.
Military expenditures promote
the high aggregate demand and
economic stability necessary for
the survival of the technostruc
ture, and government coopera
tion is needed to finance re
search projects which would be
too costly for private industry.
The technostructure, then, has
shaped social values and institu
tions to perpetuate itself and en
hance its power.
Prof. Bach disagrees with most
of Galbraith's conclusions. In
deed, his opinion of Galbraith is
less than glittering. "We need
him badly, but he's a terrible
economist", the business school
professor said.
He repudiated Galbraith's be
lief that business and industry
are too closely tied to the mili
tary complex, citing the A & P
grocery chain as one of many
proofs to the contrary. Bach is
also unconvinced that the tech
nostructure is able to manage
consumer demand through ad
vertising, which, he believes, has
"no influence on the aggregate
propensity to consume."
Nor does Bach subscribe to
the belief that private enterprise
imposes its values upon society,
particularly in regard to univer
sities. A former business school
dean, Bach declared that private
industry has never dictated to
him how research gifts should
be allocated.
He concluded his address by
calling Galbraith a "moralist"
who not only "wants to tell peo

pie to lead better lives" but also
how to do it.
Prof. Gurley finds that the in
fluence of the technostructure is
more pervasive, even with re
gard to foreign policy. In order
to sell the ideas of its enormous
military spending to the Ameri
can public, he feels, the power
structure must "present an
image of the world at large",
that Communism is "repugnant
because it's anti-democratic." He
dismisses this as a myth. "We're
not defending the Free World on
a "Freedom-slavery basis," he
asserted. American aid to the
dictatorship in Greece, he feels,
is not an example of our de
fense of the "free" world.
Gurley, however, disagrees
with Galbraith's portrayal of the
technostructure as essentially
classless, to which everyone has
equal opportunity. If that were
true, a mere redistribution of in
come would solve the poverty
problem. Because, he feels, the
poor are in fact made inferior
by the power system, a redistri
bution of power rather than
money is a pre-requisite for an
adequate solution.

the laughs coming: in waves,
with pauses in between so
people can catch their breath."
