# Bruin Comeback Scuttles Tribe
## 
### GARY CAVALLI 
Whatever faint hopes Stanford
had of going to the Rose Bowl
died at the Los Angeles Colise
um Saturday afternoon.
Battling back brilliantly from
a 14-0 defiicit, and aided by
timely breaks and questionable
officiating, UCLA's Bruins
scored three times in the second
half to knock Stanford out of
Pacific-8 title contention with a
dramatic 20-17 upset.
"I don't know how far we're
going from here," a jubilant
Coach Tommy Prothro told re
porters after the game, "but we
sure came back from dead to
day."
Indian coach John Ralston,
both stunned and dejected after
Stanford's second heart-break
ing loss of the '68 campaign,
agreed that UCLA did, in fact,
"come back from dead."
The Tribe moved at will in
the first half, and eased to a
14-0 lead halfway through the
second stanza.
Jim Kauffman's electrifying
49-yard punt return set up the
first Indian tally. Kauffman took
Zenon Andrusyshyn's punt at
the Stanford 32, and exhibited
great balance and speed in slip
ping by several Bruin tacklers
before being tripped up on the
UCLA 19.
Stanford took it from there
in six plays, with quarterback
Jim Plunkett rolling out for the
score from the one. Bill Shoe
maker's PAT, his first since be
ing injured on Sept. 21, made it
7-0 Stanford.
Tom Massey intercepted a Bill
Bolden aerial on the Tribe 23
early in the second quarter, and
Plunkett promptly directed the
Indians to their second score.
Air Attack Awesome
Five passes to Gene Washing
ton provided 50 yards, but it
was rookie split end Mark Mar
quess who scored on a 10-yard
strike from Plunkett. The TD
marked the 12th touchdown pass
thrown by Plunkett this year.
The Indians threatened again
just before halftime when Plun
kett aerials to Washington,
Bruce Cass, and sophomore De
mea Washington, plus a five
yard penalty against UCLA for
holding, gave Stanford a first
and goal from the eight.
But on second down Gene
Washington was called for offen
sive pass interference in the end
zone, the referee ruled a touch
back, and UCLA was awarded
possession on the 20. It may
have been the most important
play of the game, but to many
(especially Washington) it
looked as though the interfer
ence call should have been made
on Bruin defensive back Danny
Graham.
"It was a terrible call," said
the man who tied the Pac-8 re
ceiving record with his 13 recep
tions. "That guy (Graham) was
running into me," Washington
explained. "He almost had his
arms around me. Am I sup
posed to let him knock me
down?"
UCLA wasted no time in get
ting on the scoreboard after
taking the second half kickoff.
On the third play from scrim
mage Bolden hit flanker Gwen
Cooper at midfield. Cooper
slipped from the grasp of defen
sive back Massey, cut to his left
as tight end Mike Garratt cut

down Rich Keller with a beauti
ful block, and went all the way
for a 65-yd TD.
A fumble by tailback Bubba
Brown, who otherwise had a
great day for Stanford with 114
yards on 18 carries, set up the
second Bruin tally.
Fumble Costly
Defensive end Wes Grant
pounced on Brown's fumble at
the Tribe 24, and from there it
took UCLA only four plays to
score. Fullback Rick Purdy bur
rowed in from the one for the
six-pointer.
Another try for the two-point
conversion failed when John
Haygood made a great stop on
Bolden at the one. So it re
mained 14-12 Stanford.
Stanford came right back,
moving 86 yards on 18 plays be
fore bogging down at the UCLA
2. Brown gained 28 yards on the
drive, and Plunkett hit Wash
ington twice for 38 yards, giv
ing the Tribe a first and goal at
the seven.
After two plays failed to gain
a yard, Washington got to the
two on a flanker reverse. That
made it fourth and two on the
two. Ralston elected to go for a
field goal, but Shoemaker's kick
was wide to the right from the
nine-yard line.
One minute later Pat Preston
recovered a fumble at the Bruin

32. Brown gained 17 on three
carries, then Plunkett hit Wash
ington at the six, bringing up
another fourth and two situa
tion. This time Shoemaker's
ing Stanford a 17-12 lead with
kick was good from the 24, giv
nearly 14 minutes left to play.
Seconds later, Dick Oliver
picked off a Bolden pass on the
41 and returned it all the way
to the UCLA 12 before being
run out of bounds.
After two one-yard gains on
flare passes, Plunkett got nine
yards on a keeper, giving Stan
ford a first and goal at the
one. But Plunkett was trapped
for a four-yard loss by Grant on
first down, then his pitchout to
Brown was behind Bubba and
rolled to the 17 before Brown
fell on it. A 15-yard holding
penalty gave Stanford a third
and-35 at the 35.
At this point Plunkett came
up with a truly remarkable
play. Off balance, running back
wards, and fighting off UCLA's
Griffin, Plunkett fired to tight j
end Bob Moore at the seven.
Moore fought his way to the
one before being hauled down by
safety Dennis Spurling.
This time Ralston disdained
the field goal attempt, which
would have made it 20-12 Stan
ford, and decided to go for the ,

touchdown on fourth down at
the one. Fullback Greg Brough
ton was stacked up for no gain
and UCLA took over.
.Muffed Opportunities
In the space of 13 minutes,
Stanford had driven to inside the
UCLA 6 yard line three times.
And all the Indians got out of
it was 3 points.
With sophomore Jim Nader
operating at quarterback and
Garrat making a key 35-yard
reception, UCLA drove 97 yards
in 11 plays before Preston in
tercepted Nader's pass in the
end zone for a touchback.
Stanford was forced to punt,
and the Bruins got the ball back
on their own 47. This time Na
der went right to work. On
third down he uncorked a bomb
to Ron Copeland, who wrestled
the ball away from Tribe de
fenders Massey and Keller at
the Stanford three.
Greg Jones, who played a fine
game for UCLA at halfback,

punched over for the touch
down Jones also scored the
crucial two-point conversion
(making it after a pass
interference call against Stan
lord gave the Bruins a second
try at it from the 1 '2.
Last Gasp KfTort
Down 20-17 with 3:43 remain
ing, Stanford had to go for a
touchdown. Plunkett, who com
pleted 25 of 43 passes for 272
yards on the day, threw 11
straight aerials as Stanford
marched downfield, earning a
first-and-10 at the UCLA 25.
It was fourth-and-two from
the 17 with 1:18 left to play, as
Marquess ran a look-in pattern
near the left hash mark at the
11 yard line. Plunkett's pass
was a little high, and Bruin
Dennis Gustavson jarred Mar
quess as he leaped for the pig
skin. Glancing off Marquess' fin
gers, the ball, along with Stan
ford's hopes, fell harmlessly to
the turf.
