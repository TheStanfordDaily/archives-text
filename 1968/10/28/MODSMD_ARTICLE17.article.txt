# Secrets Of A Music Critic
## 'Reviewers Role Is To Stimulate' 
### 
"The role of the critic," stated
Paul Hertelendy, reviewer of
the Oakland Tribune, "is to stim
ulate." In his lecture, "Secrets
of a Music Critic," last Thurs
day at Tresidder, Mr. Hertelendy
explained that a critic should
stimulate the "cultural aware
ness" of the community by "ar
tistic reporting."
The critics, he continued, who
simply restates in reviews "what
everyone who attended should
assert for himself" will bore his
audience and present useless in
formation.
Mr. Hertelendy, who has been
chosen to participate in Stan
ford's winter Program of Pro
fessional Journalism, condemned
the music critic who is primarily
trained in journalism and not
in music.
"Contemporary music," he ex
plained, "is becoming more com
plex, and the music scene has
more activity" today. Music cri
tics, therefore, need guideposts,
in the form of a solid musical
background, in order to produce
a satisfactory review. Effective
criticism of classical music re
quires extensive knowledge of
the works performed as well as
close scrutiny of the performer.
Mr. Hertelendy believes that
even the most knowledgeable cri
tic should attend a performance
with the "score in his lap." One
can't "just listen."
Objectivity
A critic should be concerned
primarily with objectivity, Mr.
Hertelendy emphasized. He
blasted the myth that a critic,
who could by any means suc
cessfully interest the reader who
had not attended the perfor

mance could "call it a day." Al
though the critic is concerned
primarily with the reader and
not the artist he is reviewing, he
should be concerned with open
minded analysis and not with
"emotional appeal" and shocking
statements.
An appropriate background
for a music critic, continued Mr.
Hertelendy, is difficult to define.
Although he should be a spe
cialist in the field, a composer or
a performer is usually not a
suitable critic because he often
becomes too wrapped up in his
own style to be able to appreci
ate the style of others. Similarly,
a musicologist usually can't com
municate as a journalist to the
layman reader. His criticism be
comes too specialized.
Mr. Hertelendy firmly believes
that the academic community
should take a more increased
role in the training of music
critics.
In addition to requiring a
specific training program, he ad
vocates a licensing system in
all areas that the critic will be
reviewing. According to one ex
pert Mr. Hertelendy referred to,
the critic too often is a journalist
whose only qualification is that
he can write 500 words in less
than an hour in order to meet
a rushed deadline. This expert
condemned the "permiscuous so
ciety" in which sports writers
are encouraged to go into the
criticism of music and drama.
Deadlines Hurt Reporting
Mr. Hertelendy emphasized
that a few critics can "make" a
performer, but a bad review can
seldom ruin the career of an
established artist. He did, how

ever, stress the responsibility
that a critic is given, and con
demned the current "morning
paper syndrome." The reviewer
of a concert ending at 10:30 p.m.,
Mr. Hertelendy explained, usual
ly has a deadline that gives him
about twenty minutes to finish
his critique for the next morn
ing's paper. This pressure is
an "impeding factor to good re
porting."
The music scene in general is
faced with numerous problems,
Mr. Hendelendy continued. In
addition to the limitations spon
sors put on musical presenta
tions on television and radio,
"the death of the recital" is
diminishing the opportunity of
the public to hear new perform
ers. The symphony orchestra
is faced with serious financial
problems, and communities of
ten can't shoulder the expense.
Emphasis On New York
Another problem with the na

tional music scene is the prece
dence that cultural events in
New York City take over per
formances in other cities. An ex
ample of this "centralization
syndrome" is Life magazine's
eleven page story on the open
ing of the New York Opera
House when compared to a two
page coverage of the new Los
Angeles Music Pavilion.
In closing, Mr. Hertelendy ex
pressed the hope that his audi
ence had gained "a heightened
awareness in the area of criti
cism." One musician in the au
dience was irate with the lack
of attendance of more perform
ers. She criticized the Music De
partment for not having pub
licized the lecture enough and
stated "this was the kind of dis
cussion that young musicians
should attend.
'They should have been here
to ask questions," she continued,
"and find out what the music

critics are going to expect from
them."
Mr. Hertlendy's talk was the
second in a series of criticism
lectures, sponsored by the Cul
tural Arts Division at Tresid
der. The program brings to
gether Bay Area critics in vari
ous fields every Thursday night
at 8:00 for the purpose of dis
cussing the function, use and
relevance of criticism.

everyone who attended should
assert for himself" will bore his
audience and present useless in
formation.
Mr. Hertelendy, who has been
chosen to participate in Stan
ford's winter Program of Pro
fessional Journalism, condemned
the music critic who is primarily
trained in journalism and not
in music.
"Contemporary music," he ex
plained, "is becoming more com
plex, and the music scene has
more activity" today. Music cri
tics, therefore, need guideposts,
in the form of a solid musical
background, in order to produce
a satisfactory review. Effective
criticism of classical music re
quires extensive knowledge of
the works performed as well as
close scrutiny of the performer.
Mr. Hertelendy believes that
even the most knowledgeable cri
tic should attend a performance
with the "score in his lap." One
can't "just listen."
Objectivity
A critic should be concerned
primarily with objectivity, Mr.
Hertelendy emphasized. He
blasted the myth that a critic,
who could by any means suc
cessfully interest the reader who
had not attended the perfor

mance could "call it a day." Al
though the critic is concerned
primarily with the reader and
not the artist he is reviewing, he
should be concerned with open
minded analysis and not with
"emotional appeal" and shocking
statements.
An appropriate background
for a music critic, continued Mr.
Hertelendy, is difficult to define.
Although he should be a spe
cialist in the field, a composer or
a performer is usually not a
suitable critic because he often
becomes too wrapped up in his
own style to be able to appreci
ate the style of others. Similarly,
a musicologist usually can't com
municate as a journalist to the
layman reader. His criticism be
comes too specialized.
Mr. Hertelendy firmly believes
that the academic community
should take a more increased
role in the training of music
critics.
In addition to requiring a
specific training program, he ad
vocates a licensing system in
all areas that the critic will be
reviewing. According to one ex
pert Mr. Hertelendy referred to,
the critic too often is a journalist
whose only qualification is that
he can write 500 words in less
than an hour in order to meet
a rushed deadline. This expert
condemned the "permiscuous so
ciety" in which sports writers
are encouraged to go into the
criticism of music and drama.
Deadlines Hurt Reporting
Mr. Hertelendy emphasized
that a few critics can "make" a
performer, but a bad review can
seldom ruin the career of an
established artist. He did, how

ever, stress the responsibility
that a critic is given, and con
demned the current "morning
paper syndrome." The reviewer
of a concert ending at 10:30 p.m.,
Mr. Hertelendy explained, usual
ly has a deadline that gives him
about twenty minutes to finish
his critique for the next morn
ing's paper. This pressure is
an "impeding factor to good re
porting."
The music scene in general is
faced with numerous problems,
Mr. Hendelendy continued. In
addition to the limitations spon
sors put on musical presenta
tions on television and radio,
"the death of the recital" is
diminishing the opportunity of
the public to hear new perform
ers. The symphony orchestra
is faced with serious financial
problems, and communities of
ten can't shoulder the expense.
Emphasis On New York
Another problem with the na

tional music scene is the prece
dence that cultural events in
New York City take over per
formances in other cities. An ex
ample of this "centralization
syndrome" is Life magazine's
eleven page story on the open
ing of the New York Opera
House when compared to a two
page coverage of the new Los
Angeles Music Pavilion.
In closing, Mr. Hertelendy ex
pressed the hope that his audi
ence had gained "a heightened
awareness in the area of criti
cism." One musician in the au
dience was irate with the lack
of attendance of more perform
ers. She criticized the Music De
partment for not having pub
licized the lecture enough and
stated "this was the kind of dis
cussion that young musicians
should attend.
'They should have been here
to ask questions," she continued,
"and find out what the music

critics are going to expect from
them."
Mr. Hertlendy's talk was the
second in a series of criticism
lectures, sponsored by the Cul
tural Arts Division at Tresid
der. The program brings to
gether Bay Area critics in vari
ous fields every Thursday night
at 8:00 for the purpose of dis
cussing the function, use and
relevance of criticism.
"The role of the critic," stated
Paul Hertelendy, reviewer of
the Oakland Tribune, "is to stim
ulate." In his lecture, "Secrets
of a Music Critic," last Thurs
day at Tresidder, Mr. Hertelendy
explained that a critic should
stimulate the "cultural aware
ness" of the community by "ar
tistic reporting."

tics, therefore, need guideposts,
in the form of a solid musical
background, in order to produce
a satisfactory review. Effective
criticism of classical music re
quires extensive knowledge of
the works performed as well as
close scrutiny of the performer.
Mr. Hertelendy believes that
even the most knowledgeable cri
tic should attend a performance
with the "score in his lap." One
can't "just listen."
Objectivity
A critic should be concerned
primarily with objectivity, Mr.
Hertelendy emphasized. He
blasted the myth that a critic,
who could by any means suc
cessfully interest the reader who
had not attended the perfor

mance could "call it a day." Al
though the critic is concerned
primarily with the reader and
not the artist he is reviewing, he
should be concerned with open
minded analysis and not with
"emotional appeal" and shocking
statements.
An appropriate background
for a music critic, continued Mr.
Hertelendy, is difficult to define.
Although he should be a spe
cialist in the field, a composer or
a performer is usually not a
suitable critic because he often
becomes too wrapped up in his
own style to be able to appreci
ate the style of others. Similarly,
a musicologist usually can't com
municate as a journalist to the
layman reader. His criticism be
comes too specialized.
Mr. Hertelendy firmly believes
that the academic community
should take a more increased
role in the training of music
critics.
In addition to requiring a
specific training program, he ad
vocates a licensing system in
all areas that the critic will be
reviewing. According to one ex
pert Mr. Hertelendy referred to,
the critic too often is a journalist
whose only qualification is that
he can write 500 words in less
than an hour in order to meet
a rushed deadline. This expert
condemned the "permiscuous so
ciety" in which sports writers
are encouraged to go into the
criticism of music and drama.
Deadlines Hurt Reporting
Mr. Hertelendy emphasized
that a few critics can "make" a
performer, but a bad review can
seldom ruin the career of an
established artist. He did, how

ever, stress the responsibility
that a critic is given, and con
demned the current "morning
paper syndrome." The reviewer
of a concert ending at 10:30 p.m.,
Mr. Hertelendy explained, usual
ly has a deadline that gives him
about twenty minutes to finish
his critique for the next morn
ing's paper. This pressure is
an "impeding factor to good re
porting."
The music scene in general is
faced with numerous problems,
Mr. Hendelendy continued. In
addition to the limitations spon
sors put on musical presenta
tions on television and radio,
"the death of the recital" is
diminishing the opportunity of
the public to hear new perform
ers. The symphony orchestra
is faced with serious financial
problems, and communities of
ten can't shoulder the expense.
Emphasis On New York
Another problem with the na

tional music scene is the prece
dence that cultural events in
New York City take over per
formances in other cities. An ex
ample of this "centralization
syndrome" is Life magazine's
eleven page story on the open
ing of the New York Opera
House when compared to a two
page coverage of the new Los
Angeles Music Pavilion.
In closing, Mr. Hertelendy ex
pressed the hope that his audi
ence had gained "a heightened
awareness in the area of criti
cism." One musician in the au
dience was irate with the lack
of attendance of more perform
ers. She criticized the Music De
partment for not having pub
licized the lecture enough and
stated "this was the kind of dis
cussion that young musicians
should attend.
'They should have been here
to ask questions," she continued,
"and find out what the music

critics are going to expect from
them."
Mr. Hertlendy's talk was the
second in a series of criticism
lectures, sponsored by the Cul
tural Arts Division at Tresid
der. The program brings to
gether Bay Area critics in vari
ous fields every Thursday night
at 8:00 for the purpose of dis
cussing the function, use and
relevance of criticism.
"The role of the critic," stated
Paul Hertelendy, reviewer of
the Oakland Tribune, "is to stim
ulate." In his lecture, "Secrets
of a Music Critic," last Thurs
day at Tresidder, Mr. Hertelendy
explained that a critic should
stimulate the "cultural aware
ness" of the community by "ar
tistic reporting."
The critics, he continued, who
simply restates in reviews "what
everyone who attended should
assert for himself" will bore his
audience and present useless in
formation.
Mr. Hertelendy, who has been
chosen to participate in Stan
ford's winter Program of Pro
fessional Journalism, condemned
the music critic who is primarily
trained in journalism and not
in music.
"Contemporary music," he ex
plained, "is becoming more com
plex, and the music scene has
more activity" today. Music cri
tics, therefore, need guideposts,
in the form of a solid musical
background, in order to produce
