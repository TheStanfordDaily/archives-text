# SRT Opens Wednesday With 'Andromache' Classic
## 
### 
Stanford Repertory Theater's
first production of the 1968-69
season Androniachr by Jean Ra
cine, has entered the final stages
of rehearsal. The 17th century

classic is scheduled to open a
two-week run Wednesday, Octo
ber 30, in Memorial Auditorium
on the Stanford campus.
The play, in a recent transla

tion from the French by John
Cairncross, is a tale of passion
and intrigue. It is set in the
Greek court of Pyrrhus fo'lowing
the Trojan War. Andromache,
the widow of the Trojan hero,
Hector, is made captive of the
young king who adores her to
the point of madness. Pvrrhus's
neglected fiance, Hermione, and
her suitor, Orestes, plot the
king's death and also the death
of Andromache's son, the last
prince of Troy.
Andromache is directed by Mi
chael Barry, former head of the
British Broadcasting Company's
drama department. Appearing in
the title role is Miss Maidie Nor
man, an award-winning actress.
Others playing principle roles
are Roger KO7OI, Stenhen D.
Newman, and Mary Staton. Set
design and costume design are
by Master of Fine Arts students
Don and Regina Cate.
While researching the original
production of "Andromache," di
rector Barry and stage directors
Don and Regina Cate found that
Racine's ideas about Greek ar
chitecture and costume were dif
ferent than the styles modern
audiences now hold to be au
thentic. They had to decide to
produce a drama which mir
rored Racine's neo-classical in
terpretation or one which was
historically accurate. The cur
rent "Andromache" is a com
promise. The sets and costumes
are Greek in design but French
in detail.
Andromache will play Wed
nesdays through Saturdays at 8
p.m. beginning October 30 and
continuing through November
9. A matinee performance is
slated for November 2. Tickets
are available at the SRT Memo
rial Hall box office or by calling
321-2300, ext. 2934. Season sub
scriptions are also available.
