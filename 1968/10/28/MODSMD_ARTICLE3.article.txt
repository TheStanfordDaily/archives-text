TEXT OF QUESTION
"Are you a registered voter?"
From here, the conversation
proceeded in one of two ways.
If the person being questioned
was of voting age, he was ques
tioned about his party affiliation,
his choice of candidates in the
presidential and California sen
atorial elections and his state
of residency.
Those who were not registered
voters were asked the same
questions, preceeded by the
phrase, "assuming that you
could vote . "
The questions asked of the
registered voters were:
1) For whom are you going
to vote for President on Novem
ber fifth?
2) For whom are you going
to vote for senator from Cali
fornia?
3) Are you a resident of Cali
fornia?
