A "reorientation program" for
students going to Stanford's
Vienna campus in the spring and
summer of next year begins this
afternoon. It is sponsored by
some members of Stanford in
Austria's Group VI (spring
summer 1968) who believe, as
one put it, that "someone should
tell students what the adminis
trators don't."
The "reorientation" begins at
Cubberley Auditorium half an
hour before the regularly sched
uled 4:15 Overseas Campuses
meeting. The example of the
"constitution" and "counter-ori
entation" of some members of
Germany XX has apparently set
off a chain reaction of criticism
of Overseas Campuses.
The students from Austria VI
believe that Group VIII may be
an important force for changing

the Overseas Campuses. One
adds, "The Overseas Campuses
system has yet to be affected by
student power. It is still a be
nevolent despotism ruled by
Robert Walker."
Topics of discussions in the
course of the "reorientation"
program are expected to in
clude: sports facilities for an ur
ban campus; student govern
ment overseas, with emphasis on
"students bearing the onus of
enforcing the administration's
rules"; the uses of a social
budget and alternative methods
of financing group activities;
"groupiness or community";
strategies of bargaining with
Dr. Robert Walker and his as
sistant, George Hamrdla; and
creating an aesthetically satisfy
ing environment "despite the
architectural sterility" of the
Vienna campus building.
