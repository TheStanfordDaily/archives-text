# Cal Demonstrators Reconsider Strike
## 
### 
Student leaders of last week's
demonstrations at Berkeley have
apparently had second thoughts
about a possible student strike.

Over the weekend students ar
rested in last week's demonstra
tions met other concerned stu
dents and made the decision for
a re-vote of Thursday evening's
move to strike. A certain re
luctance on the part of the stu
dents present for the original
vote is cited as a reason for the
revote.
A meeting is scheduled today
on the Sproul Hall steps at noon
where reconsideration of last
weeks decision will be made.
Later this afternoon the Am
erican Federation of Teachers
(AFT) local will also consider
the strike issue. The Union's
members number roughly one
half of the Teaching Assistants
at the school. The vote on the
strike issue by the TA's is con
sidered critical.
In other developments Chan
cellor Roger Heyns announced
his endorsement of discussion
groups which are scheduled for
this morning on lawns outside
the classrooms.
Students, faculty and adminis
tration will break up into small
groups and discuss the issue
which has thrown the campus
into turmoil. Classes are to be
held but those wishing to take
part have been encouraged to
attend the discussions.

when not enough ears arrived for the scheduled park-in on Friday.
