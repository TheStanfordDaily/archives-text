• LBJ's Staff Accused
NEW YORK (AP) — Republi
can Richard M. Nixon suggested
Sunday night that "insiders on
the White House staff" are at
tempting to work out some sort
of Vietnam peace maneuver —
with an eye on Hubert H. Hum
phrey's prospects in the coming
presidential election.
The GOP presidential nomi
nee said once again that he does
not believe President Johnson
has any political motives in the
current flurry of peace efforts.
He would not name the "insid
ers" to whom he referred.
Nixon appeared on tho CBS
TV program "Face the Nation,"
taking part in a network inter
view show for the first time in
two years.
He spoke out for his running
mate. Gov. Spiro T. Agnew of
Maryland, against what Nixon
said was a charge by The N°w
York Times that Agnew's in
volvement in land speculations
and his position as director of a
Maryland bank presented "clear
and repeated conflicts of inter
est."
"This is the lowest kind of
gutter politics that a great news
paper could possibly engage in,"
Nixon said. "These charges are
stale. They were made two years
ago. They were answered then
. . . A retraction will be de
manded legally tomorrow and 1

think it will speak for itself."
The questioning quickly
turned to Nixon's statement Fri
day that he had learned the ad
ministration is driving for a
Vietnam bombing halt and possi
bly a cease-fire.
In that statement, Nixon re
ported, and denied, what he said
was speculation that Johnson
was politically motivated.
"It seemed to me that I was
being quite responsible in nail
ing that," Nixon said. "... I
would think the President would
be thanking me rather than at
tacking me."
• Anti-ILS. March
LONDON (AP) — A sea of
yelling demonstrators surged
through downtown London with
Viet Cong flags Sunday in a
massive anti-American demon
stration that broke up in violent
scenes around the U.S. Embas
sy -
About 7,000 protest marchers
thronged Grosvenor Square and
hurled firecrackers, smoke
bombs and other missiles. Most
were cleared from in front of
the embassy after a siege lasting
nearly three hours.
It was a major victory for the
London police, who kept their
tempers under a shower of mis
siles and abuse. After easing all
but a hard core of about 200

Mao-style Communists from the
square, they began running
down "hooligans" who headed
into the bright lights of the
capital's West End, throwing
bricks and smashing windows.
T we nt y-four demonstrators
were reported under arrest by
early evening, some for carrying
knives, paint sprays and weighed
chains. Five policemen were
among 30 persons needing hospi
tal attention. Hundreds of dem
onstrators and policemen suf
fered bruises and other minor
injuries.
• HHH And Rocky?
NEW YORK (AP) — News
week magazine said Sunday that
on two separate ocrasions Hu
bert H. Humphrey asked Re
publican Gov. Nelson A. Rocke
feller of New York to be his
running mate, but that Rocke
feller said no.
Newsweek said Humphrey
first made the offer after Rocke
feller lost the Republican pres
idential nomination to Richard
M. Nixon and again during the
Democratic national convention.
The governor, however, told
the Democratic presidential
nominee he was not interested
in switching parties, Newsweek
said.
Rockefeller was not available
immediately for comment.

However, Humphrey said Sun
day he did not offer or consider
offering the nomination to Rock
efeller.
"I must say that Gov. Rocke
feller is a fine man and one of
my good friends and I admire
him greatly," Humphrey said.
"I hope that he will be willing
to serve in any government po
sition if he should be called up
on, but I have no recollection
of, and I don't recall that I ever
did" offer him the nomination,
Humphrey said.
