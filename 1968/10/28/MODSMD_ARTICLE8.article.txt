• In Re Morley
Editor, The Daily:
Let me begin by saying that
I find it quite difficult to answer
Mr. Morley's letter to you of Oc
tober 24, for it is difficult to
decide what his position is.
There are, however, several
points which I can answer. The
first concerns just how many
that I, as Shop Steward in the
English Department, represent.
Presently, thirty-three Teaching
Assistants and three Acting In
structors (who also teach Fresh
man English at only a slightly
higher salary than the Teaching
Assistants do) are members of
the AFT Union.
In addition, four Teaching As
sistants have written letters to
Provost Lyman supporting us
In this matter of higher salaries.
As a result, we can say that I
represent forty (out of a pos

sible fifty-three) members of the
English Department staff in this
issue.
Secondly, I am glad that Mr.
Morley used the phrase "crea
ture comforts," for this is ex
actly what we are asking for:
enough money to live on in the
Bay Area. At present, we earn
$2,300 minus taxes ($200). We
are not asking for an exorbitant
amount of money (or to be able
to live in "style"), only enough
to raise our incomes to some
thing very slightly above the
poverty level.
As it stands now, we have to
borrow money for dental care,
for hospitalization insurance, for
car upkeep (and everyone would
agree that a car is a necessity
in this area), occasionally even
for food.
Also, I might point out that
we are people with the equiva
lents of M.A. degrees who per
form a valuable service for the
University, not only in terms of
leading class meetings but also
in the time we spend outside of
class with each student (in some
cases, this is more valuable than
contact in the classroom).
We are asking for a more
reasonable compensation for the
service we perform, and the Ad
ministration has acknowledged
that we deserve more. The ques
tion is where the money will
come from, and the present ne
gotiations are an attempt to de
cide not only where the money
will come from and if it avail

able, but also what priorities the
Administration uses when it dis
tributes money.
Thirdly, as to the political af
filiates of our Union. Mr. Mor
ley raised two points. As to the
first, our inherent support of
the A.F.T. in New York, I know
of no Union member who sup
ports their action; and our con
vention delegate is at present
working with the New Caucus
(a coalition of "radicals" and
blacks), which is going so far as
to counter-picket and to teach
freedom schools while the regu
lar schools are closed.
As to the second point, the
National A.F.T.'s support of
Humphrey, our local's dues are
not used as contributions to his
campaign (a separate founda
tion, COPE, which asks that
each local join it, makes the con
tributions). I would also ask Mr.
Morley who he would have the
National support. Nixon or Wal
lace?
Finally, let me say that we
will be glad to inform the Ad
ministration that Mr. Morley
does not wish to be considered
for a pay raise and is perhaps
even willing to take a cut in
salary.

• Racism In Union?
Editor, The Daily:
I take exception to Mr. Ed
ward F. Morley's off-the-cuff

attack of the members of New
York City's United Federation
of Teachers as members of a
"white racist union which has
been denying thousands of black
children a meaningful educa
tion in New York City."
I do not wish to enter into an
exhaustive analysis of that sad
dispute at this time, but I would
suggest that a further investi
gation of the facts would shed
more light on the subject. There
are many more things at stake
right now in New York City
than the school system.
President Shanker of the UFT
has accused Mayor Lindsay of
attempting to destroy the union.
The financial support of the
secessionist Ocean Hill-Browns
ville district is coming from
sources whose motives are ques
tionable. The future of labor
unions might very well be at
stake in New York City.
Can all unions remain strong
after one is destroyed? And to
call a union "racist" because it
is fighting for its very existence,
when that fight is not directed
against any minority, is com
pletely ridiculous.
Furthermore, if any act was
"racist" it was that of the school
district's governing board in
summarily dismissing instruc
tors (when they had no such
power) not on the basis of com
petence but merely because they
were white. This, and only this,
was the original cause of the
strike. Now it seems that the
issues have become far more in
volved and important. But does
such a history deserve Mr. Mor
ley's epithet "racist"?
In his all-encompassing state
ment Mr. Morley completely dis
misses these central issues in
the conflict, with an appeal to
unjustified and completely un
called-for smear tactics!
What I wish to address myself
to is just that smear. It seems
that many people are allowing
themselves the luxury of adding
flowery, parenthetical phrases to
their arguments in the hope that
such smears will support the
rest of their shaky position. It
has gotten to the point that no

discussion of any topic is com
plete without such empty words.
The phrases "low and order,"
"anarchists and nihilists," "im
perialism," and "white racism"
are choking communication to
the point that one cannot under
stand what anyone is saying.
How can anyone unite or get to
gether when all that one is asked
to unite under is a bag of cliches,
which mean little or nothing?
Lastly, to link the students in
the Stanford group with any oth
er union is absurd, since each
local has its own separate prob
lems. And to attempt to defame
the Stanford group by associat
ing them with another group
which has been foully and
wrongfully smeared is the very
height of irresponsibility!!

• TA Demand Unwise
Editor, The Daily:
Without commenting on the
other demands of the Political
Science TA's (the Daily, 17 Oc
tober), I wish to point out that
the demand of payment of $300
for each dependent of a TA is
extremely unwise. If Stanford
were to pay TA's some fixed
salary and in addition pay $300
for each dependent, the Univer
sity would in effect be reward
ing those TA's foolish enough to
have children that they could
not afford.
The folly of indiscriminate re
production is being realized by
an increasing number of in
formed people, due in part to the
presence of such excellent books
as Dr. Paul Ehrlich's The Pop
ulation Bomb (95c in paper
back). One has only to compare
the Peninsula of five years ago
with the Peninsula today to note
increased smog and traffic con
gestion and a decline in open
space and in park area per per
son.
Since the TA's seem content to
live under the archaic paternal
istic university system, they
should act responsibly and de
mand that Stanford SUBTRACT
$300 for each dependent ( exclud
ing a spouse, which seems rea
sonable). The University should
not be put in the position of
making the population bomb tick
faster.

• Park-in Rejected
Editor, The Daily:
While I support the Grape
Boycott, I find the recent "park
in" unacceptable. To legislate
morality or the "recognition of
social responsibility" is difficult
enough. Nonlegislative coercion
of morality or recognition of so
cial responsibility can easily be
going too far.
Whatever the decision or jus
tification, such action becomes
the will of a minority impressed
upon the general public. If a
student objects to grape sales
and feels therefore he has the
right and obligation to physic
ally obstruct their sale, then the
Blue Max could find it within his
right and responsibility to phy
sically obstruct "communist"
book sales at Kepler's.
So many people have cooper
ated voluntarily with the Grape
Boycott. Why lose support from
those people who believe in free
dom of choice, choice to estab
lish a union and choice to buy
grapes, by making "Safeway

recognize their social responsi
bility"?

History
• Grape Myths
Editor, The Dally:
I wonder how many Stanford
students bothered to inform
themselves of the facts before
they voted to support the United
Farm Workers in the so-called
grape dispute. My husband and
I spent half the summer in De
lano to learn firsthand what is
happening. Here are the facts:
1. The grape worker portray
ed as a struggling, poor, and ex
ploited group is a myth. The
workers who are presently in
the fields have been harvesting
the crops formany years. Many
of the families live in and
around Delano, and for some of
them picking grapes is a sec
ond job within the family. For
the past two years these work
ers have endured insults, threats,
and general harrassment from
outsiders — demonstrators who
have never been in the fields.
2. Field workers have declared
they want no part of Chavez or
his union, so students who vote
to support the United Farm
Workers are not supporting
grape pickers at all.
3. The union wants "to get"
$1.65 for the workers. Grape
pickers are already receiving an
hourly wage of $1.50 plus a 25
cent bonus per box (three boxes
per hour minimum). I missed
out on the "new math," but that
adds up to a $2.25 minimum in
my book.
4. The farmer hires through a
crew boss, and the workers make
their demands of the farmer
through that same crew boss.
When the crop is ripe on the
vine, the crew has all the bar
gaining power in the world.
5. If the students are well
meaning, then certainly they are
misinformed, or are they merely
expousing a Cause — real or
myth — for the sake of "getting
involved." They are supporting
a boycott which has been de
clared illegal. If the boycott is
successful and grape growers
are forced to turn to mechanized
crops, what will become of the
workers? Whom will the union
attempt to organize then?

• Campbell & Hoover
Editor, THE DAILY
Certainly your stand on the
UC faculty's right to and re
sponsibility in decisions of ap
pointment and government can
not be disputed. But one must
take issue with the last sentence
of your Tuesday editorial. Your
redoubtable passion for academ
ic freedom has seemingly re
sulted in that same blindness
that you state cripples the Gov
ernor and his followers.
Whatever may be your view
of the Director of the Hoover
Institution as a UC Regent, you
show a blind and incredibly
prejudiced attitude in condemn
ing the Institution in toto by as
serting that it is "already a
blight on the Stanford name."
The Hoover Institution is inter
nationally acknowledged as one
of the world's most outstanding
research libraries.
Your complete (and deliber
ate?) disregard of its nopoliti
cal contributions, of its funda
mental value to students and
scholars the world over, mani
fests an intellectual blindness
that is unworthy of you. Do
you know what resoruces the
Hoover Institution houses?
The Hoover Institution is un
doubtedly resigned to the Daily's
periodic anti-Hoover Institution
binge. But your edtiorial also
makes an assault that is, I be
lieve, new to its pages by label
ing Reagan a Don Quixote. This
is an unwarranted and shocking
affront to the name of Miguel
de Cervantes and to his most

famous creation. Reagan roman
tic, idealistic, chivalrous! Have
you ever read Don Quixote?

• Erroneous Parallels
Editor, The DAILY:
In reading the account of Fa
ther Berrigan's talk, my eye was
caught by his question as quot
ed by your reporter: "Would the
Jewish prosecutor have prose
cuted the nine of us in Germany
during World War II for burn
ing one of Hitler's draft files?"
This question it seems to me
is selfdefeating since no Jews
occupied responsible positions in
Hitler's Germany during World
War 11. They were either dead,
in concentration camps, in hid
ing, or refugees. It seems to me
that Father Berrigan weakens
his case by drawing erroneous
historical parallels.

• Errors On May field
Editor, THE DAILY
In the article "Mayfield Resur
rected for Housing" four struc
tural deficiencies were incorrect
ly reported:
1. Poor heating system—four
new 4,000 watt fan forced ther
mostatically controlled electrical
heaters were installed on the
third floor of Mayfield House
and the existing heating system
is being thoroughly checked and
repaired.
2. Condemned kitchen—the old
ATO kitchen was not con
demned by the County of Santa
Clara Health Department. The
kitchen was not opened because
of the large renovation cost to
raise the kitchen to a standard
equivalent to other university
residences and because of the
large operating losses incurred
when operating a kitchen serv
ing 40 residents. Instead, a food
service program was initiated
with Roth and Guthrie Houses.
3. Faulty wiring—all wiring,
fixtures and appliances are in
stalled in accordance with the
State of California Electrical
Safety Orders and certified to
the county of Santa Clara Fire
Marshal's office by a licensed
electrical contractor.
4. Wooden fire escape — the
fire escape was constructed in
accordance with the State of
California Administration Code,
Title 19 (State Fire Marshal's
Regulations).

• Olympic Protest
Editor, The Dally:
I wish to reply to the support
you gave Tommy Smith and
John Carlos in the recent pro
test during the Olympic award
ceremonies. It is difficult to de
termine from the article "Track
Power" whether you justify the
protest on grounds that Hitler
oriented the Games correctly,
that they should be used for po
litical demonstration, or that
such use, although deplorable,
exists in some forms, and that,
therefore, the Olympic Commit
tees should allow it in any form.
The former attitude would, I
believe, be the demise of the
Olympic Games — the athletic
competition would dissolve amid
the acidity of the countless num
ber of bitter political struggles
which continually seethe; such
an attitude would condone Czech
demonstrations against the So
viets, Biaffran against Federalist
Nigeria, Pakistani against India,
Arab against Jew. The Olympic
Games in such an atmosphere
would no longer exist as an
athletic competition.
True, that underlying the
Games is a quite discernable
current of political rivalry, but
to support a perpetration of
wrong simply on the grounds of
its existence has no rational
basis whatsoever and would con
demn any human institution re
gardless of the amount of posi
tive good it was accomplishing.
The simple fact that one
agrees with the cause being
furthered has no bearing on the
legitimacy of its expression, and
support of Tommy Smith and
John Carlos would also affirm
the right to raise a white glove
and demonstrate hideously for
an all-white America. I despise
the latter and because of it, do
not wish to see the former; I
think the Olympic Games are
worth saving from the political
beast which constantly tries to
devour them.

• Reg Packets
Editor, The Daily:
In a recent Dally Miss Marta
Mahoney objected to some ma
terials which were handed out
at the doors of Memorial Audi
torium at registration time.
I think it is appropriate for
me to clarify what our practice
is in this regard. In Memorial
Auditorium the official registra
tion materials and nothing but
official registration materials are
distributed to new students and
continuing students. Official stu
dent organizations and depart
ments of the University are per
mitted to insert materials in a
packet which is distributed to
students as they enter Memorial
Auditorium.
The Student Financial Man
ager is in general charge of
seeing to it that only official or
ganizations do insert materials,
and Alpha Phi Omega coordi
nates putting the packets togeth
er. This practice was inaugurat
ed six to eight years ago, sup
erseding an earlier situation in
which from fifteen to thirty
representatives or organizations
would be handing out things
separately.
This arrangement was orgin
ally worked out with the then
responsible student representa
tives. Our office is ready to have
this practice reviewed with rep
resentatives of students, faculty,
and members of the administra
tion at any time.

• KZSU Policy
Editor, The Dally:
In reference to a recent front
page article, "Cleaver's Speech
Sparks New KZSU Liberaliza
tion," there are several mis-lead
ing statements which, I believe,
require immediate clarification.
1) The "new" policy can hard
ly be termed a liberalization over
KZSU's past policy. Since 1964,
KZSU has permitted and en
couraged the broadcasting of all
shades of opinion, from George
Lincoln Rockwell's speech on
Negro inferiority to last spring's
series on Racism in America.
2) Having authored this
"new" policy, J. can assure you
that the statement "any pro
gram, regardless of content, will
be permitted on the air" is quite
false. There are a number of
restrictions on profanity, libel,
slander, and most importantly,
on requiring responsible spokes
men.
KZSU will censor no one for
his views, but neither will the
station become the mouthpiece
of every student, faculty or staff
member who wants to hear his
own voice. KZSU's "new" policy
is an improvement, if for no
other reason than the fact that
it puts in writing what has been
verbally "accepted" for years.
The station will have complete
copies of this policy available
soon for those interested. I
would hope that before anyone
"demands" a show on KZSU,
they take the time to read the
requirements they must meet.

• Health History
Editor, THE DAILY:
As the architect of the Stan

ford Student Health Service, I
am interested in the comments
in the box in the Daily. It might
help to "look at the record." It
might also help to correct some
mis-apprehensions which are in
the mind of the writer of the
editorial.
In 1946 when the health ser
vice was started, Stanford was
faced with a crisis. The health
service—one man only — was
swamped. The return of the sol
diers skyrocketed enrollments.
The shortage of doctors was
acute. Up to this time a sick
student found a doctor —if he
could—got treatment —good or
bad (the student could not judge
which) and paid whatever this
doctor chose to charge.
Stanford approached me in
some desperation to see if the
Palo Alto Clinic could help. We
worked out the details of the
health service—simply that the
University would pay the Clinic
a capitation fee (i.e. so much
per head) and the Clinic would
maintain an infirmary and give
the students complete compre
hensive care. The University
undertook to self insure for the
hospital bills.
I can say positively that for
twenty-two years the students
of Stanford have had superb
care under this arrangement.
There has been a doctor or doc
tors available every hour, day
and night, Sundays and holi
days, school days and vacations.
And during this whole period
there have been no medical ca
tastrophes except the regretta
ble, inevitable, and unprevent
able suicides. There has been no
instance of serious neglect or
lack of skill. The price the Uni
versity has paid by all insurance
standards has been ridiculously
low — particularly when there
are no deductibles, no co-insur
ance, and no reservations except
pregnancy and long time psy
chosis.
During this period the cost to
the Clinic of the services ren
dered has exceeded the amount
paid by an average of $44,621 a
year or a total for the twenty
one years ending in 1967 of
$936,441. Almost a million dol
lars in supplies and services
have been contributed by the
Clinic to the Stanford Student
Body. This fact is not mentioned.
The proposal that the medical
school take over the health ser
vice is not original with you. It
has been discussed and exam
ined in great detail. The answer
is simply that with their present
personnel whose time is com
pletely taken up with teaching
and research they cannot do it.
It is possible that the health
service might be staffed with
medical students and interns.
I do not believe the Stanford
students who have had free ac
cess to all the mature specialists
in one of the greatest medical
clinics in the country would like
this. If the medical school takes
on this task, they would have
to hire doctors hopefully of the
competence of the clinic doctors
to do the work.
The faculty can't do it in their
spare time. And the situation of

shortage of doctors is such that
they simply cannot get such
men. The privilege of Clinic as
sociation which is highly valued
makes it possible for the health
service to be staffed by highly
skilled men. And, of course, all
the one hundred thirty doctors
in the Clinic are available to
students who need them.
Apparently the writer of the
editorial does not understand
that the Clinic does not profit
when more students are referred
to it. The idea of stationing a
fulltime orthopedist at Cowell is
silly. No orthopedist of sufficient
competence to be worthy to care
for the students would accept
such an assignment.
In summary — the Stanford
students have had superb care
for twenty-one years under the
present arrangement. The price
is very low as attested by the
million dollar deficit the Clinic
has incurred in the twenty years
it has been involved. No alterna
tive arrangement would make
available such competence at
such a price. The withdrawal of
the University from furnishing
hospital care has nothing to do
with the Clinic agreement but
is a matter between the students
and the school.
As a matter of fact it was
found that many of the students
were already covered (as are al
most seventy-five percent of all
people) by private insurance for
hospitalization and the Univer
sity's coverage just gave double
coverage and helped the insur
ance companies.
A great single group coverage
for all students deserves some
consideration. In closing it
would be in the interests of good
journalism if the editor had con
sulted with people who know
the facts and the background.

• Scott On Gaieties
Editor, The Daily:
Johnie Scotts' column, like any
other great piece of propoganda,
has, on a quick reading, at least
one each of: grains of truth, un
truths, half-truths, and distor
tions.
1. Grain of truth: We are not
producing the show.
2. Untruth: "Among the state
ments floating around the room
— 'Why, this play is racist and
immoral,' 'Uh, uh, you know we
can't have a play with more
blacks than whites in it!' " Those
statements were uttered at a
meeting with erstwhile director
Bob Fletcher early in August,
with clear sarcasm, by a design
er. It was Fletcher, Johnie's
White Sidekick, who reported
the remarks, removed the sar
casm, and placed them at the
September 23 meeting, where
the subject was never mentioned
by anybody.
3. Untruth: "... the deci
sion by the Board not to do the
script." At the September 23
meeting, Bob Fletcher proposed
a set of physically impossible
requirements for doing the show,
proceeded to admit that they
were impossible, and went on to

say that he would not do the
show anyway.
4. Distortion: "Black art . . .
cannot enter the System normal
ly ... " Black art probably
could have entered "the Sys
tem" normally. Unfortunately, as
Johnie admitted to me when I
discussed the play with him in
August, his play "sounded as if
it had been written by a white
middle-class liberal college stu
dent."
5. Half-truth: The "censors"
did indeed keep Johnie from us
ing any profanity. Unfortunate
ly, the, censor was, as Johnie also
told me in August, Bob Fletcher,
who never was or will be a
Ram's Head Board Member.
KARL ERICK BURTON
• Sex Course Dropped
Editor, The Daily:
Last spring quarter Dr. B.
Otis Cobb of the Health Educa
tion Department taught his last
course at Stanford. The course
was "Marriage and the Family."
Now it seems that Stanford
is "streamlining" *its curricu
lum and that the course will dis
appear from Stanford after this
year, along with the phasing out
of the rest of the Health Educa
tion Department.
Dr. Cobb was a controversial
teacher. Many students thought
he delighted in flaunting "ob
scene" four-letter words. Some
students have called him a "dirty
old man" and a "pervert." But
he was not.
He was an interesting teacher
who made students think about
the quirks of sexual taboos in
our culture and who broadened
our viewpoints.
"Marriage and the Family,"
too, has been much maligned.
Just mention to your friends
that you're taking "Marriage
and the Family" and watch
their reactions, such as "Oh,
taking a mick" or "Looking for
3 easy units of A, huh?"
The Administration shares
this lack of regard for the course
as evidenced by its planning to
drop the course as well as the
department that offers it.
"Marriage and the Family,"
however, is a worthwhile course,
and most students would admit
they got something besides a
grade out of it. Students ask for
courses that are relevant to
relevant to them, and "Marriage
and the Family" is one of the
most relevant courses at Stan
ford.
The course awakes students
to the realities of an interper
sonal relationship such as mar
riage and discusses the family,
perhaps the most important
group in our tradition-lacking
and restless society. Probably no
other course approximates this
coverage.
But the University feels it
must move "forward," leaving

such a course behind. Perhaps
Stanford should ask itself "Quo
vadis?"

• Hitler
Editor, The DAILY:
In light of the heated cam
paign that we have witnessed
during the past months, and of
one of the major campaign is
sues that have been thrown
around, I thought the following
would be of interest:
"The streets of our coun
try are in turmoil. The univer
sities are filled with students
rebelling and rioting. Commu
nists are seeking to destroy
our country. Russia Is threat
ening us with her might, and
the Republic is in danger.
"Yes, danger from within
and from without. We need
law and order.
"Yes, without law and or
der, our nation cannot survive.
We are laughed at by other
nations because of the disor
der in our streets caused by
the students and the Commu
nists.
"Elect us, and we, we shall
restore law and order. We
shall by law and order be re
spected among the nations of
the world. Without law and or
der, our Republic shall fail."

TIMOTHY GILL
• In Re Morley
Editor, The Daily:
Let me begin by saying that
I find it quite difficult to answer
Mr. Morley's letter to you of Oc
tober 24, for it is difficult to
decide what his position is.
There are, however, several
points which I can answer. The
first concerns just how many
that I, as Shop Steward in the
English Department, represent.
Presently, thirty-three Teaching
Assistants and three Acting In
structors (who also teach Fresh
man English at only a slightly
higher salary than the Teaching
Assistants do) are members of
the AFT Union.
In addition, four Teaching As
sistants have written letters to
Provost Lyman supporting us
In this matter of higher salaries.
As a result, we can say that I
represent forty (out of a pos

sible fifty-three) members of the
English Department staff in this
issue.
Secondly, I am glad that Mr.
Morley used the phrase "crea
ture comforts," for this is ex
actly what we are asking for:
enough money to live on in the
Bay Area. At present, we earn
$2,300 minus taxes ($200). We
are not asking for an exorbitant
amount of money (or to be able
to live in "style"), only enough
to raise our incomes to some
thing very slightly above the
poverty level.
As it stands now, we have to
borrow money for dental care,
for hospitalization insurance, for
car upkeep (and everyone would
agree that a car is a necessity
in this area), occasionally even
for food.
Also, I might point out that
we are people with the equiva
lents of M.A. degrees who per
form a valuable service for the
University, not only in terms of
leading class meetings but also
in the time we spend outside of
class with each student (in some
cases, this is more valuable than
contact in the classroom).
We are asking for a more
reasonable compensation for the
service we perform, and the Ad
ministration has acknowledged
that we deserve more. The ques
tion is where the money will
come from, and the present ne
gotiations are an attempt to de
cide not only where the money
will come from and if it avail

able, but also what priorities the
Administration uses when it dis
tributes money.
Thirdly, as to the political af
filiates of our Union. Mr. Mor
ley raised two points. As to the
first, our inherent support of
the A.F.T. in New York, I know
of no Union member who sup
ports their action; and our con
vention delegate is at present
working with the New Caucus
(a coalition of "radicals" and
blacks), which is going so far as
to counter-picket and to teach
freedom schools while the regu
lar schools are closed.
As to the second point, the
National A.F.T.'s support of
Humphrey, our local's dues are
not used as contributions to his
campaign (a separate founda
tion, COPE, which asks that
each local join it, makes the con
tributions). I would also ask Mr.
Morley who he would have the
National support. Nixon or Wal
lace?
Finally, let me say that we
will be glad to inform the Ad
ministration that Mr. Morley
does not wish to be considered
for a pay raise and is perhaps
even willing to take a cut in
salary.

• Racism In Union?
Editor, The Daily:
I take exception to Mr. Ed
ward F. Morley's off-the-cuff

attack of the members of New
York City's United Federation
of Teachers as members of a
"white racist union which has
been denying thousands of black
children a meaningful educa
tion in New York City."
I do not wish to enter into an
exhaustive analysis of that sad
dispute at this time, but I would
suggest that a further investi
gation of the facts would shed
more light on the subject. There
are many more things at stake
right now in New York City
than the school system.
President Shanker of the UFT
has accused Mayor Lindsay of
attempting to destroy the union.
The financial support of the
secessionist Ocean Hill-Browns
ville district is coming from
sources whose motives are ques
tionable. The future of labor
unions might very well be at
stake in New York City.
Can all unions remain strong
after one is destroyed? And to
call a union "racist" because it
is fighting for its very existence,
when that fight is not directed
against any minority, is com
pletely ridiculous.
Furthermore, if any act was
"racist" it was that of the school
district's governing board in
summarily dismissing instruc
tors (when they had no such
power) not on the basis of com
petence but merely because they
were white. This, and only this,
was the original cause of the
strike. Now it seems that the
issues have become far more in
volved and important. But does
such a history deserve Mr. Mor
ley's epithet "racist"?
In his all-encompassing state
ment Mr. Morley completely dis
misses these central issues in
the conflict, with an appeal to
unjustified and completely un
called-for smear tactics!
What I wish to address myself
to is just that smear. It seems
that many people are allowing
themselves the luxury of adding
flowery, parenthetical phrases to
their arguments in the hope that
such smears will support the
rest of their shaky position. It
has gotten to the point that no

discussion of any topic is com
plete without such empty words.
The phrases "low and order,"
"anarchists and nihilists," "im
perialism," and "white racism"
are choking communication to
the point that one cannot under
stand what anyone is saying.
How can anyone unite or get to
gether when all that one is asked
to unite under is a bag of cliches,
which mean little or nothing?
Lastly, to link the students in
the Stanford group with any oth
er union is absurd, since each
local has its own separate prob
lems. And to attempt to defame
the Stanford group by associat
ing them with another group
which has been foully and
wrongfully smeared is the very
height of irresponsibility!!

• TA Demand Unwise
Editor, The Daily:
Without commenting on the
other demands of the Political
Science TA's (the Daily, 17 Oc
tober), I wish to point out that
the demand of payment of $300
for each dependent of a TA is
extremely unwise. If Stanford
were to pay TA's some fixed
salary and in addition pay $300
for each dependent, the Univer
sity would in effect be reward
ing those TA's foolish enough to
have children that they could
not afford.
The folly of indiscriminate re
production is being realized by
an increasing number of in
formed people, due in part to the
presence of such excellent books
as Dr. Paul Ehrlich's The Pop
ulation Bomb (95c in paper
back). One has only to compare
the Peninsula of five years ago
with the Peninsula today to note
increased smog and traffic con
gestion and a decline in open
space and in park area per per
son.
Since the TA's seem content to
live under the archaic paternal
istic university system, they
should act responsibly and de
mand that Stanford SUBTRACT
$300 for each dependent ( exclud
ing a spouse, which seems rea
sonable). The University should
not be put in the position of
making the population bomb tick
faster.

• Park-in Rejected
Editor, The Daily:
While I support the Grape
Boycott, I find the recent "park
in" unacceptable. To legislate
morality or the "recognition of
social responsibility" is difficult
enough. Nonlegislative coercion
of morality or recognition of so
cial responsibility can easily be
going too far.
Whatever the decision or jus
tification, such action becomes
the will of a minority impressed
upon the general public. If a
student objects to grape sales
and feels therefore he has the
right and obligation to physic
ally obstruct their sale, then the
Blue Max could find it within his
right and responsibility to phy
sically obstruct "communist"
book sales at Kepler's.
So many people have cooper
ated voluntarily with the Grape
Boycott. Why lose support from
those people who believe in free
dom of choice, choice to estab
lish a union and choice to buy
grapes, by making "Safeway

recognize their social responsi
bility"?

History
• Grape Myths
Editor, The Dally:
I wonder how many Stanford
students bothered to inform
themselves of the facts before
they voted to support the United
Farm Workers in the so-called
grape dispute. My husband and
I spent half the summer in De
lano to learn firsthand what is
happening. Here are the facts:
1. The grape worker portray
ed as a struggling, poor, and ex
ploited group is a myth. The
workers who are presently in
the fields have been harvesting
the crops formany years. Many
of the families live in and
around Delano, and for some of
them picking grapes is a sec
ond job within the family. For
the past two years these work
ers have endured insults, threats,
and general harrassment from
outsiders — demonstrators who
have never been in the fields.
2. Field workers have declared
they want no part of Chavez or
his union, so students who vote
to support the United Farm
Workers are not supporting
grape pickers at all.
3. The union wants "to get"
$1.65 for the workers. Grape
pickers are already receiving an
hourly wage of $1.50 plus a 25
cent bonus per box (three boxes
per hour minimum). I missed
out on the "new math," but that
adds up to a $2.25 minimum in
my book.
4. The farmer hires through a
crew boss, and the workers make
their demands of the farmer
through that same crew boss.
When the crop is ripe on the
vine, the crew has all the bar
gaining power in the world.
5. If the students are well
meaning, then certainly they are
misinformed, or are they merely
expousing a Cause — real or
myth — for the sake of "getting
involved." They are supporting
a boycott which has been de
clared illegal. If the boycott is
successful and grape growers
are forced to turn to mechanized
crops, what will become of the
workers? Whom will the union
attempt to organize then?

Certainly your stand on the

Whatever may be your view

• Erroneous Parallels
Editor, The DAILY:
In reading the account of Fa

caught by his question as quot
ed by your reporter: "Would the
Jewish prosecutor have prose
cuted the nine of us in Germany
during World War II for burn
ing one of Hitler's draft files?"
This question it seems to me
is selfdefeating since no Jews
occupied responsible positions in
Hitler's Germany during World

that Father Berrigan weakens
his case by drawing erroneous

In the article "Mayfield Resur

tural deficiencies were incorrect

1. Poor heating system—four
new 4,000 watt fan forced ther
mostatically controlled electrical
heaters were installed on the
third floor of Mayfield House
and the existing heating system
is being thoroughly checked and
repaired.
2. Condemned kitchen—the old
ATO kitchen was not con
demned by the County of Santa
Clara Health Department. The
kitchen was not opened because
of the large renovation cost to
raise the kitchen to a standard
equivalent to other university
residences and because of the
large operating losses incurred
when operating a kitchen serv
ing 40 residents. Instead, a food
service program was initiated
with Roth and Guthrie Houses.
3. Faulty wiring—all wiring,

• Olympic Protest
Editor, The Dally:
I wish to reply to the support
you gave Tommy Smith and
John Carlos in the recent pro
test during the Olympic award
ceremonies. It is difficult to de
termine from the article "Track
Power" whether you justify the
protest on grounds that Hitler
oriented the Games correctly,
that they should be used for po
litical demonstration, or that
such use, although deplorable,
exists in some forms, and that,
therefore, the Olympic Commit
tees should allow it in any form.
The former attitude would, I
believe, be the demise of the
Olympic Games — the athletic
competition would dissolve amid
the acidity of the countless num
ber of bitter political struggles
which continually seethe; such
an attitude would condone Czech
demonstrations against the So
viets, Biaffran against Federalist
Nigeria, Pakistani against India,
Arab against Jew. The Olympic
Games in such an atmosphere
would no longer exist as an
athletic competition.
True, that underlying the
Games is a quite discernable
current of political rivalry, but
to support a perpetration of
wrong simply on the grounds of
its existence has no rational
basis whatsoever and would con
demn any human institution re
gardless of the amount of posi
tive good it was accomplishing.
The simple fact that one
agrees with the cause being
furthered has no bearing on the
legitimacy of its expression, and
support of Tommy Smith and
John Carlos would also affirm
the right to raise a white glove
and demonstrate hideously for
an all-white America. I despise
the latter and because of it, do
not wish to see the former; I
think the Olympic Games are
worth saving from the political
beast which constantly tries to
devour them.

In a recent Dally Miss Marta

I think it is appropriate for
me to clarify what our practice
is in this regard. In Memorial

official registration materials are
distributed to new students and
continuing students. Official stu
dent organizations and depart

mitted to insert materials in a

seeing to it that only official or

and Alpha Phi Omega coordi
nates putting the packets togeth

erseding an earlier situation in
which from fifteen to thirty

would be handing out things
separately.
This arrangement was orgin

this practice reviewed with rep

• KZSU Policy
Editor, The Dally:
In reference to a recent front
page article, "Cleaver's Speech
Sparks New KZSU Liberaliza
tion," there are several mis-lead
ing statements which, I believe,
require immediate clarification.
1) The "new" policy can hard
ly be termed a liberalization over
KZSU's past policy. Since 1964,
KZSU has permitted and en
couraged the broadcasting of all
shades of opinion, from George
Lincoln Rockwell's speech on
Negro inferiority to last spring's
series on Racism in America.
2) Having authored this
"new" policy, J. can assure you
that the statement "any pro
gram, regardless of content, will
be permitted on the air" is quite
false. There are a number of
restrictions on profanity, libel,
slander, and most importantly,
on requiring responsible spokes
men.
KZSU will censor no one for
his views, but neither will the
station become the mouthpiece
of every student, faculty or staff
member who wants to hear his
own voice. KZSU's "new" policy
is an improvement, if for no
other reason than the fact that
it puts in writing what has been
verbally "accepted" for years.
The station will have complete
copies of this policy available
soon for those interested. I
would hope that before anyone
"demands" a show on KZSU,
they take the time to read the
requirements they must meet.

KZSU Prog. Director
• Health History
Editor, THE DAILY:
As the architect of the Stan

ford Student Health Service, I
am interested in the comments
in the box in the Daily. It might
help to "look at the record." It
might also help to correct some
mis-apprehensions which are in
the mind of the writer of the
editorial.
In 1946 when the health ser
vice was started, Stanford was
faced with a crisis. The health
service—one man only — was
swamped. The return of the sol
diers skyrocketed enrollments.
The shortage of doctors was
acute. Up to this time a sick
student found a doctor —if he
could—got treatment —good or
bad (the student could not judge
which) and paid whatever this
doctor chose to charge.
Stanford approached me in
some desperation to see if the
Palo Alto Clinic could help. We
worked out the details of the
health service—simply that the
University would pay the Clinic
a capitation fee (i.e. so much
per head) and the Clinic would
maintain an infirmary and give
the students complete compre
hensive care. The University
undertook to self insure for the
hospital bills.
I can say positively that for
twenty-two years the students
of Stanford have had superb
care under this arrangement.
There has been a doctor or doc
tors available every hour, day
and night, Sundays and holi
days, school days and vacations.
And during this whole period
there have been no medical ca
tastrophes except the regretta
ble, inevitable, and unprevent
able suicides. There has been no
instance of serious neglect or
lack of skill. The price the Uni
versity has paid by all insurance
standards has been ridiculously
low — particularly when there
are no deductibles, no co-insur
ance, and no reservations except
pregnancy and long time psy
chosis.
During this period the cost to
the Clinic of the services ren
dered has exceeded the amount
paid by an average of $44,621 a
year or a total for the twenty
one years ending in 1967 of
$936,441. Almost a million dol
lars in supplies and services
have been contributed by the
Clinic to the Stanford Student
Body. This fact is not mentioned.
The proposal that the medical
school take over the health ser
vice is not original with you. It
has been discussed and exam
ined in great detail. The answer
is simply that with their present
personnel whose time is com
pletely taken up with teaching
and research they cannot do it.
It is possible that the health
service might be staffed with
medical students and interns.
I do not believe the Stanford
students who have had free ac
cess to all the mature specialists
in one of the greatest medical
clinics in the country would like
this. If the medical school takes
on this task, they would have
to hire doctors hopefully of the
competence of the clinic doctors
to do the work.
The faculty can't do it in their
spare time. And the situation of

shortage of doctors is such that
they simply cannot get such
men. The privilege of Clinic as
sociation which is highly valued
makes it possible for the health
service to be staffed by highly
skilled men. And, of course, all
the one hundred thirty doctors
in the Clinic are available to
students who need them.
Apparently the writer of the
editorial does not understand
that the Clinic does not profit
when more students are referred
to it. The idea of stationing a
fulltime orthopedist at Cowell is
silly. No orthopedist of sufficient
competence to be worthy to care
for the students would accept
such an assignment.
In summary — the Stanford
students have had superb care
for twenty-one years under the
present arrangement. The price
is very low as attested by the
million dollar deficit the Clinic
has incurred in the twenty years
it has been involved. No alterna
tive arrangement would make
available such competence at
such a price. The withdrawal of
the University from furnishing
hospital care has nothing to do
with the Clinic agreement but
is a matter between the students
and the school.
As a matter of fact it was
found that many of the students
were already covered (as are al
most seventy-five percent of all
people) by private insurance for
hospitalization and the Univer
sity's coverage just gave double
coverage and helped the insur
ance companies.
A great single group coverage
for all students deserves some
consideration. In closing it
would be in the interests of good
journalism if the editor had con
sulted with people who know
the facts and the background.

• Scott On Gaieties
Editor, The Daily:
Johnie Scotts' column, like any
other great piece of propoganda,
has, on a quick reading, at least
one each of: grains of truth, un
truths, half-truths, and distor
tions.
1. Grain of truth: We are not
producing the show.
2. Untruth: "Among the state
ments floating around the room
— 'Why, this play is racist and
immoral,' 'Uh, uh, you know we
can't have a play with more
blacks than whites in it!' " Those
statements were uttered at a
meeting with erstwhile director
Bob Fletcher early in August,
with clear sarcasm, by a design
er. It was Fletcher, Johnie's
White Sidekick, who reported
the remarks, removed the sar
casm, and placed them at the
September 23 meeting, where
the subject was never mentioned
by anybody.
3. Untruth: "... the deci
sion by the Board not to do the
script." At the September 23
meeting, Bob Fletcher proposed
a set of physically impossible
requirements for doing the show,
proceeded to admit that they
were impossible, and went on to

say that he would not do the
show anyway.
4. Distortion: "Black art . . .
cannot enter the System normal
ly ... " Black art probably
could have entered "the Sys
tem" normally. Unfortunately, as
Johnie admitted to me when I
discussed the play with him in
August, his play "sounded as if
it had been written by a white
middle-class liberal college stu
dent."
5. Half-truth: The "censors"
did indeed keep Johnie from us
ing any profanity. Unfortunate
ly, the, censor was, as Johnie also
told me in August, Bob Fletcher,
who never was or will be a
Ram's Head Board Member.

• Sex Course Dropped
Editor, The Daily:
Last spring quarter Dr. B.
Otis Cobb of the Health Educa
tion Department taught his last
course at Stanford. The course
was "Marriage and the Family."
Now it seems that Stanford
is "streamlining" *its curricu
lum and that the course will dis
appear from Stanford after this
year, along with the phasing out
of the rest of the Health Educa
tion Department.
Dr. Cobb was a controversial
teacher. Many students thought
he delighted in flaunting "ob
scene" four-letter words. Some
students have called him a "dirty
old man" and a "pervert." But
he was not.
He was an interesting teacher
who made students think about
the quirks of sexual taboos in
our culture and who broadened
our viewpoints.
"Marriage and the Family,"
too, has been much maligned.
Just mention to your friends
that you're taking "Marriage
and the Family" and watch
their reactions, such as "Oh,
taking a mick" or "Looking for
3 easy units of A, huh?"
The Administration shares
this lack of regard for the course
as evidenced by its planning to
drop the course as well as the
department that offers it.
"Marriage and the Family,"
however, is a worthwhile course,
and most students would admit
they got something besides a
grade out of it. Students ask for
courses that are relevant to
relevant to them, and "Marriage
and the Family" is one of the
most relevant courses at Stan
ford.
The course awakes students
to the realities of an interper
sonal relationship such as mar
riage and discusses the family,
perhaps the most important
group in our tradition-lacking
and restless society. Probably no
other course approximates this
coverage.
But the University feels it
must move "forward," leaving

such a course behind. Perhaps
Stanford should ask itself "Quo
vadis?"

In light of the heated cam

would be of interest:

TIMOTHY GILL
• In Re Morley
Editor, The Daily:
Let me begin by saying that
I find it quite difficult to answer
Mr. Morley's letter to you of Oc
tober 24, for it is difficult to
decide what his position is.
There are, however, several
points which I can answer. The
first concerns just how many
that I, as Shop Steward in the
English Department, represent.
Presently, thirty-three Teaching
Assistants and three Acting In
structors (who also teach Fresh
man English at only a slightly
higher salary than the Teaching
Assistants do) are members of
the AFT Union.
In addition, four Teaching As
sistants have written letters to
Provost Lyman supporting us
In this matter of higher salaries.
As a result, we can say that I
represent forty (out of a pos

sible fifty-three) members of the
English Department staff in this
issue.
Secondly, I am glad that Mr.
Morley used the phrase "crea
ture comforts," for this is ex
actly what we are asking for:
enough money to live on in the
Bay Area. At present, we earn
$2,300 minus taxes ($200). We
are not asking for an exorbitant
amount of money (or to be able
to live in "style"), only enough
to raise our incomes to some
thing very slightly above the
poverty level.
As it stands now, we have to
borrow money for dental care,
for hospitalization insurance, for
car upkeep (and everyone would
agree that a car is a necessity
in this area), occasionally even
for food.
Also, I might point out that
we are people with the equiva
lents of M.A. degrees who per
form a valuable service for the
University, not only in terms of
leading class meetings but also
in the time we spend outside of
class with each student (in some
cases, this is more valuable than
contact in the classroom).
We are asking for a more
reasonable compensation for the
service we perform, and the Ad
ministration has acknowledged
that we deserve more. The ques
tion is where the money will
come from, and the present ne
gotiations are an attempt to de
cide not only where the money
will come from and if it avail

able, but also what priorities the
Administration uses when it dis
tributes money.
Thirdly, as to the political af
filiates of our Union. Mr. Mor
ley raised two points. As to the
first, our inherent support of
the A.F.T. in New York, I know
of no Union member who sup
ports their action; and our con
vention delegate is at present
working with the New Caucus
(a coalition of "radicals" and
blacks), which is going so far as
to counter-picket and to teach
freedom schools while the regu
lar schools are closed.
As to the second point, the
National A.F.T.'s support of
Humphrey, our local's dues are
not used as contributions to his
campaign (a separate founda
tion, COPE, which asks that
each local join it, makes the con
tributions). I would also ask Mr.
Morley who he would have the
National support. Nixon or Wal
lace?
Finally, let me say that we
will be glad to inform the Ad
ministration that Mr. Morley
does not wish to be considered
for a pay raise and is perhaps
even willing to take a cut in
salary.

• Racism In Union?
Editor, The Daily:
I take exception to Mr. Ed
ward F. Morley's off-the-cuff

attack of the members of New
York City's United Federation
of Teachers as members of a
"white racist union which has
been denying thousands of black
children a meaningful educa
tion in New York City."
I do not wish to enter into an
exhaustive analysis of that sad
dispute at this time, but I would
suggest that a further investi
gation of the facts would shed
more light on the subject. There
are many more things at stake
right now in New York City
than the school system.
President Shanker of the UFT
has accused Mayor Lindsay of
attempting to destroy the union.
The financial support of the
secessionist Ocean Hill-Browns
ville district is coming from
sources whose motives are ques
tionable. The future of labor
unions might very well be at
stake in New York City.
Can all unions remain strong
after one is destroyed? And to
call a union "racist" because it
is fighting for its very existence,
when that fight is not directed
against any minority, is com
pletely ridiculous.
Furthermore, if any act was
"racist" it was that of the school
district's governing board in
summarily dismissing instruc
tors (when they had no such
power) not on the basis of com
petence but merely because they
were white. This, and only this,
was the original cause of the
strike. Now it seems that the
issues have become far more in
volved and important. But does
such a history deserve Mr. Mor
ley's epithet "racist"?
In his all-encompassing state
ment Mr. Morley completely dis
misses these central issues in
the conflict, with an appeal to
unjustified and completely un
called-for smear tactics!
What I wish to address myself
to is just that smear. It seems
that many people are allowing
themselves the luxury of adding
flowery, parenthetical phrases to
their arguments in the hope that
such smears will support the
rest of their shaky position. It
has gotten to the point that no

discussion of any topic is com
plete without such empty words.
The phrases "low and order,"
"anarchists and nihilists," "im
perialism," and "white racism"
are choking communication to
the point that one cannot under
stand what anyone is saying.
How can anyone unite or get to
gether when all that one is asked
to unite under is a bag of cliches,
which mean little or nothing?
Lastly, to link the students in
the Stanford group with any oth
er union is absurd, since each
local has its own separate prob
lems. And to attempt to defame
the Stanford group by associat
ing them with another group
which has been foully and
wrongfully smeared is the very
height of irresponsibility!!

• TA Demand Unwise
Editor, The Daily:
Without commenting on the
other demands of the Political
Science TA's (the Daily, 17 Oc
tober), I wish to point out that
the demand of payment of $300
for each dependent of a TA is
extremely unwise. If Stanford
were to pay TA's some fixed
salary and in addition pay $300
for each dependent, the Univer
sity would in effect be reward
ing those TA's foolish enough to
have children that they could
not afford.
The folly of indiscriminate re
production is being realized by
an increasing number of in
formed people, due in part to the
presence of such excellent books
as Dr. Paul Ehrlich's The Pop
ulation Bomb (95c in paper
back). One has only to compare
the Peninsula of five years ago
with the Peninsula today to note
increased smog and traffic con
gestion and a decline in open
space and in park area per per
son.
Since the TA's seem content to
live under the archaic paternal
istic university system, they
should act responsibly and de
mand that Stanford SUBTRACT
$300 for each dependent ( exclud
ing a spouse, which seems rea
sonable). The University should
not be put in the position of
making the population bomb tick
faster.

• Park-in Rejected
Editor, The Daily:
While I support the Grape
Boycott, I find the recent "park
in" unacceptable. To legislate
morality or the "recognition of
social responsibility" is difficult
enough. Nonlegislative coercion
of morality or recognition of so
cial responsibility can easily be
going too far.
Whatever the decision or jus
tification, such action becomes
the will of a minority impressed
upon the general public. If a
student objects to grape sales
and feels therefore he has the
right and obligation to physic
ally obstruct their sale, then the
Blue Max could find it within his
right and responsibility to phy
sically obstruct "communist"
book sales at Kepler's.
So many people have cooper
ated voluntarily with the Grape
Boycott. Why lose support from
those people who believe in free
dom of choice, choice to estab
lish a union and choice to buy
grapes, by making "Safeway

recognize their social responsi
bility"?

• Grape Myths
Editor, The Dally:
I wonder how many Stanford
students bothered to inform
themselves of the facts before
they voted to support the United
Farm Workers in the so-called
grape dispute. My husband and
I spent half the summer in De
lano to learn firsthand what is
happening. Here are the facts:
1. The grape worker portray
ed as a struggling, poor, and ex
ploited group is a myth. The
workers who are presently in
the fields have been harvesting
the crops formany years. Many
of the families live in and
around Delano, and for some of
them picking grapes is a sec
ond job within the family. For
the past two years these work
ers have endured insults, threats,
and general harrassment from
outsiders — demonstrators who
have never been in the fields.
2. Field workers have declared
they want no part of Chavez or
his union, so students who vote
to support the United Farm
Workers are not supporting
grape pickers at all.
3. The union wants "to get"
$1.65 for the workers. Grape
pickers are already receiving an
hourly wage of $1.50 plus a 25
cent bonus per box (three boxes
per hour minimum). I missed
out on the "new math," but that
adds up to a $2.25 minimum in
my book.
4. The farmer hires through a
crew boss, and the workers make
their demands of the farmer
through that same crew boss.
When the crop is ripe on the
vine, the crew has all the bar
gaining power in the world.
5. If the students are well
meaning, then certainly they are
misinformed, or are they merely
expousing a Cause — real or
myth — for the sake of "getting
involved." They are supporting
a boycott which has been de
clared illegal. If the boycott is
successful and grape growers
are forced to turn to mechanized
crops, what will become of the
workers? Whom will the union
attempt to organize then?

In the article "Mayfield Resur

mostatically controlled electrical
heaters were installed on the
third floor of Mayfield House
and the existing heating system
is being thoroughly checked and
repaired.
2. Condemned kitchen—the old
ATO kitchen was not con
demned by the County of Santa
Clara Health Department. The
kitchen was not opened because
of the large renovation cost to
raise the kitchen to a standard
equivalent to other university
residences and because of the
large operating losses incurred

with Roth and Guthrie Houses.

• Olympic Protest
Editor, The Dally:
I wish to reply to the support
you gave Tommy Smith and
John Carlos in the recent pro
test during the Olympic award
ceremonies. It is difficult to de
termine from the article "Track
Power" whether you justify the
protest on grounds that Hitler
oriented the Games correctly,
that they should be used for po
litical demonstration, or that
such use, although deplorable,
exists in some forms, and that,
therefore, the Olympic Commit
tees should allow it in any form.
The former attitude would, I
believe, be the demise of the
Olympic Games — the athletic
competition would dissolve amid
the acidity of the countless num
ber of bitter political struggles
which continually seethe; such
an attitude would condone Czech
demonstrations against the So
viets, Biaffran against Federalist
Nigeria, Pakistani against India,
Arab against Jew. The Olympic
Games in such an atmosphere
would no longer exist as an
athletic competition.
True, that underlying the
Games is a quite discernable
current of political rivalry, but
to support a perpetration of
wrong simply on the grounds of
its existence has no rational
basis whatsoever and would con
demn any human institution re
gardless of the amount of posi
tive good it was accomplishing.
The simple fact that one
agrees with the cause being
furthered has no bearing on the
legitimacy of its expression, and
support of Tommy Smith and
John Carlos would also affirm
the right to raise a white glove
and demonstrate hideously for
an all-white America. I despise
the latter and because of it, do
not wish to see the former; I
think the Olympic Games are
worth saving from the political
beast which constantly tries to
devour them.

• KZSU Policy
Editor, The Dally:
In reference to a recent front
page article, "Cleaver's Speech
Sparks New KZSU Liberaliza
tion," there are several mis-lead
ing statements which, I believe,
require immediate clarification.
1) The "new" policy can hard
ly be termed a liberalization over
KZSU's past policy. Since 1964,
KZSU has permitted and en
couraged the broadcasting of all
shades of opinion, from George
Lincoln Rockwell's speech on
Negro inferiority to last spring's
series on Racism in America.
2) Having authored this
"new" policy, J. can assure you
that the statement "any pro
gram, regardless of content, will
be permitted on the air" is quite
false. There are a number of
restrictions on profanity, libel,
slander, and most importantly,
on requiring responsible spokes
men.
KZSU will censor no one for
his views, but neither will the
station become the mouthpiece
of every student, faculty or staff
member who wants to hear his
own voice. KZSU's "new" policy
is an improvement, if for no
other reason than the fact that
it puts in writing what has been
verbally "accepted" for years.
The station will have complete
copies of this policy available
soon for those interested. I
would hope that before anyone
"demands" a show on KZSU,
they take the time to read the
requirements they must meet.

KZSU Prog. Director
• Health History
Editor, THE DAILY:
As the architect of the Stan

ford Student Health Service, I
am interested in the comments
in the box in the Daily. It might
help to "look at the record." It
might also help to correct some
mis-apprehensions which are in
the mind of the writer of the
editorial.
In 1946 when the health ser
vice was started, Stanford was
faced with a crisis. The health
service—one man only — was
swamped. The return of the sol
diers skyrocketed enrollments.
The shortage of doctors was
acute. Up to this time a sick
student found a doctor —if he
could—got treatment —good or
bad (the student could not judge
which) and paid whatever this
doctor chose to charge.
Stanford approached me in
some desperation to see if the
Palo Alto Clinic could help. We
worked out the details of the
health service—simply that the
University would pay the Clinic
a capitation fee (i.e. so much
per head) and the Clinic would
maintain an infirmary and give
the students complete compre
hensive care. The University
undertook to self insure for the
hospital bills.
I can say positively that for
twenty-two years the students
of Stanford have had superb
care under this arrangement.
There has been a doctor or doc
tors available every hour, day
and night, Sundays and holi
days, school days and vacations.
And during this whole period
there have been no medical ca
tastrophes except the regretta
ble, inevitable, and unprevent
able suicides. There has been no
instance of serious neglect or
lack of skill. The price the Uni
versity has paid by all insurance
standards has been ridiculously
low — particularly when there
are no deductibles, no co-insur
ance, and no reservations except
pregnancy and long time psy
chosis.
During this period the cost to
the Clinic of the services ren
dered has exceeded the amount
paid by an average of $44,621 a
year or a total for the twenty
one years ending in 1967 of
$936,441. Almost a million dol
lars in supplies and services
have been contributed by the
Clinic to the Stanford Student
Body. This fact is not mentioned.
The proposal that the medical
school take over the health ser
vice is not original with you. It
has been discussed and exam
ined in great detail. The answer
is simply that with their present
personnel whose time is com
pletely taken up with teaching
and research they cannot do it.
It is possible that the health
service might be staffed with
medical students and interns.
I do not believe the Stanford
students who have had free ac
cess to all the mature specialists
in one of the greatest medical
clinics in the country would like
this. If the medical school takes
on this task, they would have
to hire doctors hopefully of the
competence of the clinic doctors
to do the work.
The faculty can't do it in their
spare time. And the situation of

shortage of doctors is such that
they simply cannot get such
men. The privilege of Clinic as
sociation which is highly valued
makes it possible for the health
service to be staffed by highly
skilled men. And, of course, all
the one hundred thirty doctors
in the Clinic are available to
students who need them.
Apparently the writer of the
editorial does not understand
that the Clinic does not profit
when more students are referred
to it. The idea of stationing a
fulltime orthopedist at Cowell is
silly. No orthopedist of sufficient
competence to be worthy to care
for the students would accept
such an assignment.
In summary — the Stanford
students have had superb care
for twenty-one years under the
present arrangement. The price
is very low as attested by the
million dollar deficit the Clinic
has incurred in the twenty years
it has been involved. No alterna
tive arrangement would make
available such competence at
such a price. The withdrawal of
the University from furnishing
hospital care has nothing to do
with the Clinic agreement but
is a matter between the students
and the school.
As a matter of fact it was
found that many of the students
were already covered (as are al
most seventy-five percent of all
people) by private insurance for
hospitalization and the Univer
sity's coverage just gave double
coverage and helped the insur
ance companies.
A great single group coverage
for all students deserves some
consideration. In closing it
would be in the interests of good
journalism if the editor had con
sulted with people who know
the facts and the background.

• Scott On Gaieties
Editor, The Daily:
Johnie Scotts' column, like any
other great piece of propoganda,
has, on a quick reading, at least
one each of: grains of truth, un
truths, half-truths, and distor
tions.
1. Grain of truth: We are not
producing the show.
2. Untruth: "Among the state
ments floating around the room
— 'Why, this play is racist and
immoral,' 'Uh, uh, you know we
can't have a play with more
blacks than whites in it!' " Those
statements were uttered at a
meeting with erstwhile director
Bob Fletcher early in August,
with clear sarcasm, by a design
er. It was Fletcher, Johnie's
White Sidekick, who reported
the remarks, removed the sar
casm, and placed them at the
September 23 meeting, where
the subject was never mentioned
by anybody.
3. Untruth: "... the deci
sion by the Board not to do the
script." At the September 23
meeting, Bob Fletcher proposed
a set of physically impossible
requirements for doing the show,
proceeded to admit that they
were impossible, and went on to

say that he would not do the
show anyway.
4. Distortion: "Black art . . .
cannot enter the System normal
ly ... " Black art probably
could have entered "the Sys
tem" normally. Unfortunately, as
Johnie admitted to me when I
discussed the play with him in
August, his play "sounded as if
it had been written by a white
middle-class liberal college stu
dent."
5. Half-truth: The "censors"
did indeed keep Johnie from us
ing any profanity. Unfortunate
ly, the, censor was, as Johnie also
told me in August, Bob Fletcher,
who never was or will be a
Ram's Head Board Member.

• Sex Course Dropped
Editor, The Daily:
Last spring quarter Dr. B.
Otis Cobb of the Health Educa
tion Department taught his last
course at Stanford. The course
was "Marriage and the Family."
Now it seems that Stanford
is "streamlining" *its curricu
lum and that the course will dis
appear from Stanford after this
year, along with the phasing out
of the rest of the Health Educa
tion Department.
Dr. Cobb was a controversial
teacher. Many students thought
he delighted in flaunting "ob
scene" four-letter words. Some
students have called him a "dirty
old man" and a "pervert." But
he was not.
He was an interesting teacher
who made students think about
the quirks of sexual taboos in
our culture and who broadened
our viewpoints.
"Marriage and the Family,"
too, has been much maligned.
Just mention to your friends
that you're taking "Marriage
and the Family" and watch
their reactions, such as "Oh,
taking a mick" or "Looking for
3 easy units of A, huh?"
The Administration shares
this lack of regard for the course
as evidenced by its planning to
drop the course as well as the
department that offers it.
"Marriage and the Family,"
however, is a worthwhile course,
and most students would admit
they got something besides a
grade out of it. Students ask for
courses that are relevant to
relevant to them, and "Marriage
and the Family" is one of the
most relevant courses at Stan
ford.
The course awakes students
to the realities of an interper
sonal relationship such as mar
riage and discusses the family,
perhaps the most important
group in our tradition-lacking
and restless society. Probably no
other course approximates this
coverage.
But the University feels it
must move "forward," leaving

such a course behind. Perhaps
Stanford should ask itself "Quo
vadis?"

In light of the heated cam

would be of interest:

ening us with her might, and

TIMOTHY GILL
• In Re Morley
Editor, The Daily:
Let me begin by saying that
I find it quite difficult to answer
Mr. Morley's letter to you of Oc
tober 24, for it is difficult to
decide what his position is.
There are, however, several
points which I can answer. The
first concerns just how many
that I, as Shop Steward in the
English Department, represent.
Presently, thirty-three Teaching
Assistants and three Acting In
structors (who also teach Fresh
man English at only a slightly
higher salary than the Teaching
Assistants do) are members of
the AFT Union.
In addition, four Teaching As
sistants have written letters to
Provost Lyman supporting us
In this matter of higher salaries.
As a result, we can say that I
represent forty (out of a pos

sible fifty-three) members of the
English Department staff in this
issue.
Secondly, I am glad that Mr.
Morley used the phrase "crea
ture comforts," for this is ex
actly what we are asking for:
enough money to live on in the
Bay Area. At present, we earn
$2,300 minus taxes ($200). We
are not asking for an exorbitant
amount of money (or to be able
to live in "style"), only enough
to raise our incomes to some
thing very slightly above the
poverty level.
As it stands now, we have to
borrow money for dental care,
for hospitalization insurance, for
car upkeep (and everyone would
agree that a car is a necessity
in this area), occasionally even
for food.
Also, I might point out that
we are people with the equiva
lents of M.A. degrees who per
form a valuable service for the
University, not only in terms of
leading class meetings but also
in the time we spend outside of
class with each student (in some
cases, this is more valuable than
contact in the classroom).
We are asking for a more
reasonable compensation for the
service we perform, and the Ad
ministration has acknowledged
that we deserve more. The ques
tion is where the money will
come from, and the present ne
gotiations are an attempt to de
cide not only where the money
will come from and if it avail

able, but also what priorities the
Administration uses when it dis
tributes money.
Thirdly, as to the political af
filiates of our Union. Mr. Mor
ley raised two points. As to the
first, our inherent support of
the A.F.T. in New York, I know
of no Union member who sup
ports their action; and our con
vention delegate is at present
working with the New Caucus
(a coalition of "radicals" and
blacks), which is going so far as
to counter-picket and to teach
freedom schools while the regu
lar schools are closed.
As to the second point, the
National A.F.T.'s support of
Humphrey, our local's dues are
not used as contributions to his
campaign (a separate founda
tion, COPE, which asks that
each local join it, makes the con
tributions). I would also ask Mr.
Morley who he would have the
National support. Nixon or Wal
lace?
Finally, let me say that we
will be glad to inform the Ad
ministration that Mr. Morley
does not wish to be considered
for a pay raise and is perhaps
even willing to take a cut in
salary.

• Racism In Union?
Editor, The Daily:
I take exception to Mr. Ed
ward F. Morley's off-the-cuff

attack of the members of New
York City's United Federation
of Teachers as members of a
"white racist union which has
been denying thousands of black
children a meaningful educa
tion in New York City."
I do not wish to enter into an
exhaustive analysis of that sad
dispute at this time, but I would
suggest that a further investi
gation of the facts would shed
more light on the subject. There
are many more things at stake
right now in New York City
than the school system.
President Shanker of the UFT
has accused Mayor Lindsay of
attempting to destroy the union.
The financial support of the
secessionist Ocean Hill-Browns
ville district is coming from
sources whose motives are ques
tionable. The future of labor
unions might very well be at
stake in New York City.
Can all unions remain strong
after one is destroyed? And to
call a union "racist" because it
is fighting for its very existence,
when that fight is not directed
against any minority, is com
pletely ridiculous.
Furthermore, if any act was
"racist" it was that of the school
district's governing board in
summarily dismissing instruc
tors (when they had no such
power) not on the basis of com
petence but merely because they
were white. This, and only this,
was the original cause of the
strike. Now it seems that the
issues have become far more in
volved and important. But does
such a history deserve Mr. Mor
ley's epithet "racist"?
In his all-encompassing state
ment Mr. Morley completely dis
misses these central issues in
the conflict, with an appeal to
unjustified and completely un
called-for smear tactics!
What I wish to address myself
to is just that smear. It seems
that many people are allowing
themselves the luxury of adding
flowery, parenthetical phrases to
their arguments in the hope that
such smears will support the
rest of their shaky position. It
has gotten to the point that no

discussion of any topic is com
plete without such empty words.
The phrases "low and order,"
"anarchists and nihilists," "im
perialism," and "white racism"
are choking communication to
the point that one cannot under
stand what anyone is saying.
How can anyone unite or get to
gether when all that one is asked
to unite under is a bag of cliches,
which mean little or nothing?
Lastly, to link the students in
the Stanford group with any oth
er union is absurd, since each
local has its own separate prob
lems. And to attempt to defame
the Stanford group by associat
ing them with another group
which has been foully and
wrongfully smeared is the very
height of irresponsibility!!

• TA Demand Unwise
Editor, The Daily:
Without commenting on the
other demands of the Political
Science TA's (the Daily, 17 Oc
tober), I wish to point out that
the demand of payment of $300
for each dependent of a TA is
extremely unwise. If Stanford
were to pay TA's some fixed
salary and in addition pay $300
for each dependent, the Univer
sity would in effect be reward
ing those TA's foolish enough to
have children that they could
not afford.
The folly of indiscriminate re
production is being realized by
an increasing number of in
formed people, due in part to the
presence of such excellent books
as Dr. Paul Ehrlich's The Pop
ulation Bomb (95c in paper
back). One has only to compare
the Peninsula of five years ago
with the Peninsula today to note
increased smog and traffic con
gestion and a decline in open
space and in park area per per
son.
Since the TA's seem content to
live under the archaic paternal
istic university system, they
should act responsibly and de
mand that Stanford SUBTRACT
$300 for each dependent ( exclud
ing a spouse, which seems rea
sonable). The University should
not be put in the position of
making the population bomb tick
faster.

lano to learn firsthand what is
happening. Here are the facts:
1. The grape worker portray
ed as a struggling, poor, and ex
ploited group is a myth. The
workers who are presently in
the fields have been harvesting
the crops formany years. Many
of the families live in and
around Delano, and for some of
them picking grapes is a sec
ond job within the family. For
the past two years these work
ers have endured insults, threats,
and general harrassment from
outsiders — demonstrators who
have never been in the fields.
2. Field workers have declared
they want no part of Chavez or
his union, so students who vote
to support the United Farm
Workers are not supporting
grape pickers at all.
3. The union wants "to get"
$1.65 for the workers. Grape
pickers are already receiving an
hourly wage of $1.50 plus a 25
cent bonus per box (three boxes
per hour minimum). I missed
out on the "new math," but that
adds up to a $2.25 minimum in
my book.
4. The farmer hires through a
crew boss, and the workers make
their demands of the farmer
through that same crew boss.
When the crop is ripe on the
vine, the crew has all the bar
gaining power in the world.
5. If the students are well
meaning, then certainly they are
misinformed, or are they merely
expousing a Cause — real or
myth — for the sake of "getting
involved." They are supporting
a boycott which has been de
clared illegal. If the boycott is
successful and grape growers
are forced to turn to mechanized
crops, what will become of the
workers? Whom will the union
attempt to organize then?

Certainly your stand on the

not be disputed. But one must
take issue with the last sentence

redoubtable passion for academ

Whatever may be your view
of the Director of the Hoover

The Hoover Institution is inter

Your complete (and deliber

that is unworthy of you. Do

The Hoover Institution is un

• Erroneous Parallels
Editor, The DAILY:
In reading the account of Fa
ther Berrigan's talk, my eye was
caught by his question as quot
ed by your reporter: "Would the
Jewish prosecutor have prose
cuted the nine of us in Germany
during World War II for burn
ing one of Hitler's draft files?"
This question it seems to me
is selfdefeating since no Jews
occupied responsible positions in
Hitler's Germany during World
War 11. They were either dead,
in concentration camps, in hid
ing, or refugees. It seems to me
that Father Berrigan weakens
his case by drawing erroneous
historical parallels.

• Errors On May field
Editor, THE DAILY
In the article "Mayfield Resur
rected for Housing" four struc
tural deficiencies were incorrect
ly reported:
1. Poor heating system—four
new 4,000 watt fan forced ther
mostatically controlled electrical
heaters were installed on the
third floor of Mayfield House
and the existing heating system
is being thoroughly checked and
repaired.
2. Condemned kitchen—the old
ATO kitchen was not con
demned by the County of Santa
Clara Health Department. The
kitchen was not opened because
of the large renovation cost to
raise the kitchen to a standard
equivalent to other university
residences and because of the
large operating losses incurred
when operating a kitchen serv
ing 40 residents. Instead, a food
service program was initiated
with Roth and Guthrie Houses.
3. Faulty wiring—all wiring,
fixtures and appliances are in
stalled in accordance with the
State of California Electrical
Safety Orders and certified to
the county of Santa Clara Fire
Marshal's office by a licensed

4. Wooden fire escape — the

• Olympic Protest
Editor, The Dally:
I wish to reply to the support
you gave Tommy Smith and
John Carlos in the recent pro
test during the Olympic award
ceremonies. It is difficult to de
termine from the article "Track
Power" whether you justify the
protest on grounds that Hitler
oriented the Games correctly,
that they should be used for po
litical demonstration, or that
such use, although deplorable,
exists in some forms, and that,
therefore, the Olympic Commit
tees should allow it in any form.
The former attitude would, I
believe, be the demise of the
Olympic Games — the athletic
competition would dissolve amid
the acidity of the countless num
ber of bitter political struggles
which continually seethe; such
an attitude would condone Czech
demonstrations against the So
viets, Biaffran against Federalist
Nigeria, Pakistani against India,
Arab against Jew. The Olympic
Games in such an atmosphere
would no longer exist as an
athletic competition.
True, that underlying the
Games is a quite discernable
current of political rivalry, but
to support a perpetration of
wrong simply on the grounds of
its existence has no rational
basis whatsoever and would con
demn any human institution re
gardless of the amount of posi
tive good it was accomplishing.
The simple fact that one
agrees with the cause being
furthered has no bearing on the
legitimacy of its expression, and
support of Tommy Smith and
John Carlos would also affirm
the right to raise a white glove
and demonstrate hideously for
an all-white America. I despise
the latter and because of it, do
not wish to see the former; I
think the Olympic Games are
worth saving from the political
beast which constantly tries to
devour them.

In a recent Dally Miss Marta

I think it is appropriate for
me to clarify what our practice

official registration materials are
distributed to new students and
continuing students. Official stu
dent organizations and depart

ed six to eight years ago, sup
erseding an earlier situation in
which from fifteen to thirty

would be handing out things
separately.
This arrangement was orgin

this practice reviewed with rep

• KZSU Policy
Editor, The Dally:
In reference to a recent front
page article, "Cleaver's Speech
Sparks New KZSU Liberaliza
tion," there are several mis-lead
ing statements which, I believe,
require immediate clarification.
1) The "new" policy can hard
ly be termed a liberalization over
KZSU's past policy. Since 1964,
KZSU has permitted and en
couraged the broadcasting of all
shades of opinion, from George
Lincoln Rockwell's speech on
Negro inferiority to last spring's
series on Racism in America.
2) Having authored this
"new" policy, J. can assure you
that the statement "any pro
gram, regardless of content, will
be permitted on the air" is quite
false. There are a number of
restrictions on profanity, libel,
slander, and most importantly,
on requiring responsible spokes
men.
KZSU will censor no one for
his views, but neither will the
station become the mouthpiece
of every student, faculty or staff
member who wants to hear his
own voice. KZSU's "new" policy
is an improvement, if for no
other reason than the fact that
it puts in writing what has been
verbally "accepted" for years.
The station will have complete
copies of this policy available
soon for those interested. I
would hope that before anyone
"demands" a show on KZSU,
they take the time to read the
requirements they must meet.

• Health History
Editor, THE DAILY:
As the architect of the Stan

ford Student Health Service, I
am interested in the comments
in the box in the Daily. It might
help to "look at the record." It
might also help to correct some
mis-apprehensions which are in
the mind of the writer of the
editorial.
In 1946 when the health ser
vice was started, Stanford was
faced with a crisis. The health
service—one man only — was
swamped. The return of the sol
diers skyrocketed enrollments.
The shortage of doctors was
acute. Up to this time a sick
student found a doctor —if he
could—got treatment —good or
bad (the student could not judge
which) and paid whatever this
doctor chose to charge.
Stanford approached me in
some desperation to see if the
Palo Alto Clinic could help. We
worked out the details of the
health service—simply that the
University would pay the Clinic
a capitation fee (i.e. so much
per head) and the Clinic would
maintain an infirmary and give
the students complete compre
hensive care. The University
undertook to self insure for the
hospital bills.
I can say positively that for
twenty-two years the students
of Stanford have had superb
care under this arrangement.
There has been a doctor or doc
tors available every hour, day
and night, Sundays and holi
days, school days and vacations.
And during this whole period
there have been no medical ca
tastrophes except the regretta
ble, inevitable, and unprevent
able suicides. There has been no
instance of serious neglect or
lack of skill. The price the Uni
versity has paid by all insurance
standards has been ridiculously
low — particularly when there
are no deductibles, no co-insur
ance, and no reservations except
pregnancy and long time psy
chosis.
During this period the cost to
the Clinic of the services ren
dered has exceeded the amount
paid by an average of $44,621 a
year or a total for the twenty
one years ending in 1967 of
$936,441. Almost a million dol
lars in supplies and services
have been contributed by the
Clinic to the Stanford Student
Body. This fact is not mentioned.
The proposal that the medical
school take over the health ser
vice is not original with you. It
has been discussed and exam
ined in great detail. The answer
is simply that with their present
personnel whose time is com
pletely taken up with teaching
and research they cannot do it.
It is possible that the health
service might be staffed with
medical students and interns.
I do not believe the Stanford
students who have had free ac
cess to all the mature specialists
in one of the greatest medical
clinics in the country would like
this. If the medical school takes
on this task, they would have
to hire doctors hopefully of the
competence of the clinic doctors
to do the work.
The faculty can't do it in their
spare time. And the situation of

shortage of doctors is such that
they simply cannot get such
men. The privilege of Clinic as
sociation which is highly valued
makes it possible for the health
service to be staffed by highly
skilled men. And, of course, all
the one hundred thirty doctors
in the Clinic are available to
students who need them.
Apparently the writer of the
editorial does not understand
that the Clinic does not profit
when more students are referred
to it. The idea of stationing a
fulltime orthopedist at Cowell is
silly. No orthopedist of sufficient
competence to be worthy to care
for the students would accept
such an assignment.
In summary — the Stanford
students have had superb care
for twenty-one years under the
present arrangement. The price
is very low as attested by the
million dollar deficit the Clinic
has incurred in the twenty years
it has been involved. No alterna
tive arrangement would make
available such competence at
such a price. The withdrawal of
the University from furnishing
hospital care has nothing to do
with the Clinic agreement but
is a matter between the students
and the school.
As a matter of fact it was
found that many of the students
were already covered (as are al
most seventy-five percent of all
people) by private insurance for
hospitalization and the Univer
sity's coverage just gave double
coverage and helped the insur
ance companies.
A great single group coverage
for all students deserves some
consideration. In closing it
would be in the interests of good
journalism if the editor had con
sulted with people who know
the facts and the background.

• Scott On Gaieties
Editor, The Daily:
Johnie Scotts' column, like any
other great piece of propoganda,
has, on a quick reading, at least
one each of: grains of truth, un
truths, half-truths, and distor
tions.
1. Grain of truth: We are not
producing the show.
2. Untruth: "Among the state
ments floating around the room
— 'Why, this play is racist and
immoral,' 'Uh, uh, you know we
can't have a play with more
blacks than whites in it!' " Those
statements were uttered at a
meeting with erstwhile director
Bob Fletcher early in August,
with clear sarcasm, by a design
er. It was Fletcher, Johnie's
White Sidekick, who reported
the remarks, removed the sar
casm, and placed them at the
September 23 meeting, where
the subject was never mentioned
by anybody.
3. Untruth: "... the deci
sion by the Board not to do the
script." At the September 23
meeting, Bob Fletcher proposed
a set of physically impossible
requirements for doing the show,
proceeded to admit that they
were impossible, and went on to

say that he would not do the
show anyway.
4. Distortion: "Black art . . .
cannot enter the System normal
ly ... " Black art probably
could have entered "the Sys
tem" normally. Unfortunately, as
Johnie admitted to me when I
discussed the play with him in
August, his play "sounded as if
it had been written by a white
middle-class liberal college stu
dent."
5. Half-truth: The "censors"
did indeed keep Johnie from us
ing any profanity. Unfortunate
ly, the, censor was, as Johnie also
told me in August, Bob Fletcher,
who never was or will be a
Ram's Head Board Member.

• Sex Course Dropped
Editor, The Daily:
Last spring quarter Dr. B.
Otis Cobb of the Health Educa
tion Department taught his last
course at Stanford. The course
was "Marriage and the Family."
Now it seems that Stanford
is "streamlining" *its curricu
lum and that the course will dis
appear from Stanford after this
year, along with the phasing out
of the rest of the Health Educa
tion Department.
Dr. Cobb was a controversial
teacher. Many students thought
he delighted in flaunting "ob
scene" four-letter words. Some
students have called him a "dirty
old man" and a "pervert." But
he was not.
He was an interesting teacher
who made students think about
the quirks of sexual taboos in
our culture and who broadened
our viewpoints.
"Marriage and the Family,"
too, has been much maligned.
Just mention to your friends
that you're taking "Marriage
and the Family" and watch
their reactions, such as "Oh,
taking a mick" or "Looking for
3 easy units of A, huh?"
The Administration shares
this lack of regard for the course
as evidenced by its planning to
drop the course as well as the
department that offers it.
"Marriage and the Family,"
however, is a worthwhile course,
and most students would admit
they got something besides a
grade out of it. Students ask for
courses that are relevant to
relevant to them, and "Marriage
and the Family" is one of the
most relevant courses at Stan
ford.
The course awakes students
to the realities of an interper
sonal relationship such as mar
riage and discusses the family,
perhaps the most important
group in our tradition-lacking
and restless society. Probably no
other course approximates this
coverage.
But the University feels it
must move "forward," leaving

such a course behind. Perhaps
Stanford should ask itself "Quo
vadis?"

• Hitler
Editor, The DAILY:
In light of the heated cam
paign that we have witnessed
during the past months, and of
one of the major campaign is
sues that have been thrown
around, I thought the following
would be of interest:
"The streets of our coun
try are in turmoil. The univer
sities are filled with students
rebelling and rioting. Commu
nists are seeking to destroy
our country. Russia Is threat
ening us with her might, and
the Republic is in danger.
"Yes, danger from within
and from without. We need
law and order.
"Yes, without law and or
der, our nation cannot survive.
We are laughed at by other
nations because of the disor
der in our streets caused by
the students and the Commu
nists.
"Elect us, and we, we shall
restore law and order. We
shall by law and order be re
spected among the nations of

TIMOTHY GILL
• In Re Morley
Editor, The Daily:
Let me begin by saying that
I find it quite difficult to answer
Mr. Morley's letter to you of Oc
tober 24, for it is difficult to
decide what his position is.
There are, however, several
points which I can answer. The
first concerns just how many
that I, as Shop Steward in the
English Department, represent.
Presently, thirty-three Teaching
Assistants and three Acting In
structors (who also teach Fresh
man English at only a slightly
higher salary than the Teaching
Assistants do) are members of
the AFT Union.
In addition, four Teaching As
sistants have written letters to
Provost Lyman supporting us
In this matter of higher salaries.
As a result, we can say that I
represent forty (out of a pos

sible fifty-three) members of the
English Department staff in this
issue.
Secondly, I am glad that Mr.
Morley used the phrase "crea
ture comforts," for this is ex
actly what we are asking for:
enough money to live on in the
Bay Area. At present, we earn
$2,300 minus taxes ($200). We
are not asking for an exorbitant
amount of money (or to be able
to live in "style"), only enough
to raise our incomes to some
thing very slightly above the
poverty level.
As it stands now, we have to
borrow money for dental care,
for hospitalization insurance, for
car upkeep (and everyone would
agree that a car is a necessity
in this area), occasionally even
for food.
Also, I might point out that
we are people with the equiva
lents of M.A. degrees who per
form a valuable service for the
University, not only in terms of
leading class meetings but also
in the time we spend outside of
class with each student (in some
cases, this is more valuable than
contact in the classroom).
We are asking for a more
reasonable compensation for the
service we perform, and the Ad
ministration has acknowledged
that we deserve more. The ques
tion is where the money will
come from, and the present ne
gotiations are an attempt to de
cide not only where the money
will come from and if it avail

able, but also what priorities the
Administration uses when it dis
tributes money.
Thirdly, as to the political af
filiates of our Union. Mr. Mor
ley raised two points. As to the
first, our inherent support of
the A.F.T. in New York, I know
of no Union member who sup
ports their action; and our con
vention delegate is at present
working with the New Caucus
(a coalition of "radicals" and
blacks), which is going so far as
to counter-picket and to teach
freedom schools while the regu
lar schools are closed.
As to the second point, the
National A.F.T.'s support of
Humphrey, our local's dues are
not used as contributions to his
campaign (a separate founda
tion, COPE, which asks that
each local join it, makes the con
tributions). I would also ask Mr.
Morley who he would have the
National support. Nixon or Wal
lace?
Finally, let me say that we
will be glad to inform the Ad
ministration that Mr. Morley
does not wish to be considered
for a pay raise and is perhaps
even willing to take a cut in
salary.

• Racism In Union?
Editor, The Daily:
I take exception to Mr. Ed
ward F. Morley's off-the-cuff

attack of the members of New
York City's United Federation
of Teachers as members of a
"white racist union which has
been denying thousands of black
children a meaningful educa
tion in New York City."
I do not wish to enter into an
exhaustive analysis of that sad
dispute at this time, but I would
suggest that a further investi
gation of the facts would shed
more light on the subject. There
are many more things at stake
right now in New York City
than the school system.
President Shanker of the UFT
has accused Mayor Lindsay of
attempting to destroy the union.
The financial support of the
secessionist Ocean Hill-Browns
ville district is coming from
sources whose motives are ques
tionable. The future of labor
unions might very well be at
stake in New York City.
Can all unions remain strong
after one is destroyed? And to
call a union "racist" because it
is fighting for its very existence,
when that fight is not directed
against any minority, is com
pletely ridiculous.
Furthermore, if any act was
"racist" it was that of the school
district's governing board in
summarily dismissing instruc
tors (when they had no such
power) not on the basis of com
petence but merely because they
were white. This, and only this,
was the original cause of the
strike. Now it seems that the
issues have become far more in
volved and important. But does
such a history deserve Mr. Mor
ley's epithet "racist"?
In his all-encompassing state
ment Mr. Morley completely dis
misses these central issues in
the conflict, with an appeal to
unjustified and completely un
called-for smear tactics!
What I wish to address myself
to is just that smear. It seems
that many people are allowing
themselves the luxury of adding
flowery, parenthetical phrases to
their arguments in the hope that
such smears will support the
rest of their shaky position. It
has gotten to the point that no

discussion of any topic is com
plete without such empty words.
The phrases "low and order,"
"anarchists and nihilists," "im
perialism," and "white racism"
are choking communication to
the point that one cannot under
stand what anyone is saying.
How can anyone unite or get to
gether when all that one is asked
to unite under is a bag of cliches,
which mean little or nothing?
Lastly, to link the students in
the Stanford group with any oth
er union is absurd, since each
local has its own separate prob
lems. And to attempt to defame
the Stanford group by associat
ing them with another group
which has been foully and
wrongfully smeared is the very
height of irresponsibility!!

• TA Demand Unwise
Editor, The Daily:
Without commenting on the
other demands of the Political
Science TA's (the Daily, 17 Oc
tober), I wish to point out that
the demand of payment of $300
for each dependent of a TA is
extremely unwise. If Stanford
were to pay TA's some fixed
salary and in addition pay $300
for each dependent, the Univer
sity would in effect be reward
ing those TA's foolish enough to
have children that they could
not afford.
The folly of indiscriminate re
production is being realized by
an increasing number of in
formed people, due in part to the
presence of such excellent books
as Dr. Paul Ehrlich's The Pop
ulation Bomb (95c in paper
back). One has only to compare
the Peninsula of five years ago
with the Peninsula today to note
increased smog and traffic con
gestion and a decline in open
space and in park area per per
son.
Since the TA's seem content to
live under the archaic paternal
istic university system, they
should act responsibly and de
mand that Stanford SUBTRACT
$300 for each dependent ( exclud
ing a spouse, which seems rea
sonable). The University should
not be put in the position of
making the population bomb tick
faster.

• Park-in Rejected
Editor, The Daily:
While I support the Grape
Boycott, I find the recent "park
in" unacceptable. To legislate
morality or the "recognition of
social responsibility" is difficult
enough. Nonlegislative coercion
of morality or recognition of so
cial responsibility can easily be
going too far.
Whatever the decision or jus
tification, such action becomes
the will of a minority impressed
upon the general public. If a
student objects to grape sales
and feels therefore he has the
right and obligation to physic
ally obstruct their sale, then the
Blue Max could find it within his
right and responsibility to phy
sically obstruct "communist"
book sales at Kepler's.
So many people have cooper
ated voluntarily with the Grape
Boycott. Why lose support from
those people who believe in free
dom of choice, choice to estab
lish a union and choice to buy
grapes, by making "Safeway

recognize their social responsi
bility"?

History
• Grape Myths
Editor, The Dally:
I wonder how many Stanford
students bothered to inform
themselves of the facts before
they voted to support the United
Farm Workers in the so-called
grape dispute. My husband and
I spent half the summer in De
lano to learn firsthand what is
happening. Here are the facts:
1. The grape worker portray
ed as a struggling, poor, and ex
ploited group is a myth. The
workers who are presently in
the fields have been harvesting
the crops formany years. Many
of the families live in and
around Delano, and for some of
them picking grapes is a sec
ond job within the family. For
the past two years these work
ers have endured insults, threats,
and general harrassment from
outsiders — demonstrators who
have never been in the fields.
2. Field workers have declared
they want no part of Chavez or
his union, so students who vote
to support the United Farm
Workers are not supporting
grape pickers at all.
3. The union wants "to get"
$1.65 for the workers. Grape
pickers are already receiving an
hourly wage of $1.50 plus a 25
cent bonus per box (three boxes
per hour minimum). I missed
out on the "new math," but that
adds up to a $2.25 minimum in
my book.
4. The farmer hires through a
crew boss, and the workers make
their demands of the farmer
through that same crew boss.
When the crop is ripe on the
vine, the crew has all the bar
gaining power in the world.
5. If the students are well
meaning, then certainly they are
misinformed, or are they merely
expousing a Cause — real or
myth — for the sake of "getting
involved." They are supporting
a boycott which has been de
clared illegal. If the boycott is
successful and grape growers
are forced to turn to mechanized
crops, what will become of the
workers? Whom will the union
attempt to organize then?

Editor, THE DAILY
In the article "Mayfield Resur

and the existing heating system
is being thoroughly checked and
repaired.
2. Condemned kitchen—the old
ATO kitchen was not con

kitchen was not opened because
of the large renovation cost to
raise the kitchen to a standard
equivalent to other university

• Olympic Protest
Editor, The Dally:
I wish to reply to the support
you gave Tommy Smith and
John Carlos in the recent pro
test during the Olympic award
ceremonies. It is difficult to de
termine from the article "Track
Power" whether you justify the
protest on grounds that Hitler
oriented the Games correctly,
that they should be used for po
litical demonstration, or that
such use, although deplorable,
exists in some forms, and that,
therefore, the Olympic Commit
tees should allow it in any form.
The former attitude would, I
believe, be the demise of the
Olympic Games — the athletic
competition would dissolve amid
the acidity of the countless num
ber of bitter political struggles
which continually seethe; such
an attitude would condone Czech
demonstrations against the So
viets, Biaffran against Federalist
Nigeria, Pakistani against India,
Arab against Jew. The Olympic
Games in such an atmosphere
would no longer exist as an
athletic competition.
True, that underlying the
Games is a quite discernable
current of political rivalry, but
to support a perpetration of
wrong simply on the grounds of
its existence has no rational
basis whatsoever and would con
demn any human institution re
gardless of the amount of posi
tive good it was accomplishing.
The simple fact that one
agrees with the cause being
furthered has no bearing on the
legitimacy of its expression, and
support of Tommy Smith and
John Carlos would also affirm
the right to raise a white glove
and demonstrate hideously for
an all-white America. I despise
the latter and because of it, do
not wish to see the former; I
think the Olympic Games are
worth saving from the political
beast which constantly tries to
devour them.

• KZSU Policy
Editor, The Dally:
In reference to a recent front
page article, "Cleaver's Speech
Sparks New KZSU Liberaliza
tion," there are several mis-lead
ing statements which, I believe,
require immediate clarification.
1) The "new" policy can hard
ly be termed a liberalization over
KZSU's past policy. Since 1964,
KZSU has permitted and en
couraged the broadcasting of all
shades of opinion, from George
Lincoln Rockwell's speech on
Negro inferiority to last spring's
series on Racism in America.
2) Having authored this
"new" policy, J. can assure you
that the statement "any pro
gram, regardless of content, will
be permitted on the air" is quite
false. There are a number of
restrictions on profanity, libel,
slander, and most importantly,
on requiring responsible spokes
men.
KZSU will censor no one for
his views, but neither will the
station become the mouthpiece
of every student, faculty or staff
member who wants to hear his
own voice. KZSU's "new" policy
is an improvement, if for no
other reason than the fact that
it puts in writing what has been
verbally "accepted" for years.
The station will have complete
copies of this policy available
soon for those interested. I
would hope that before anyone
"demands" a show on KZSU,
they take the time to read the
requirements they must meet.

• Health History
Editor, THE DAILY:
As the architect of the Stan

ford Student Health Service, I
am interested in the comments
in the box in the Daily. It might
help to "look at the record." It
might also help to correct some
mis-apprehensions which are in
the mind of the writer of the
editorial.
In 1946 when the health ser
vice was started, Stanford was
faced with a crisis. The health
service—one man only — was
swamped. The return of the sol
diers skyrocketed enrollments.
The shortage of doctors was
acute. Up to this time a sick
student found a doctor —if he
could—got treatment —good or
bad (the student could not judge
which) and paid whatever this
doctor chose to charge.
Stanford approached me in
some desperation to see if the
Palo Alto Clinic could help. We
worked out the details of the
health service—simply that the
University would pay the Clinic
a capitation fee (i.e. so much
per head) and the Clinic would
maintain an infirmary and give
the students complete compre
hensive care. The University
undertook to self insure for the
hospital bills.
I can say positively that for
twenty-two years the students
of Stanford have had superb
care under this arrangement.
There has been a doctor or doc
tors available every hour, day
and night, Sundays and holi
days, school days and vacations.
And during this whole period
there have been no medical ca
tastrophes except the regretta
ble, inevitable, and unprevent
able suicides. There has been no
instance of serious neglect or
lack of skill. The price the Uni
versity has paid by all insurance
standards has been ridiculously
low — particularly when there
are no deductibles, no co-insur
ance, and no reservations except
pregnancy and long time psy
chosis.
During this period the cost to
the Clinic of the services ren
dered has exceeded the amount
paid by an average of $44,621 a
year or a total for the twenty
one years ending in 1967 of
$936,441. Almost a million dol
lars in supplies and services
have been contributed by the
Clinic to the Stanford Student
Body. This fact is not mentioned.
The proposal that the medical
school take over the health ser
vice is not original with you. It
has been discussed and exam
ined in great detail. The answer
is simply that with their present
personnel whose time is com
pletely taken up with teaching
and research they cannot do it.
It is possible that the health
service might be staffed with
medical students and interns.
I do not believe the Stanford
students who have had free ac
cess to all the mature specialists
in one of the greatest medical
clinics in the country would like
this. If the medical school takes
on this task, they would have
to hire doctors hopefully of the
competence of the clinic doctors
to do the work.
The faculty can't do it in their
spare time. And the situation of

shortage of doctors is such that
they simply cannot get such
men. The privilege of Clinic as
sociation which is highly valued
makes it possible for the health
service to be staffed by highly
skilled men. And, of course, all
the one hundred thirty doctors
in the Clinic are available to
students who need them.
Apparently the writer of the
editorial does not understand
that the Clinic does not profit
when more students are referred
to it. The idea of stationing a
fulltime orthopedist at Cowell is
silly. No orthopedist of sufficient
competence to be worthy to care
for the students would accept
such an assignment.
In summary — the Stanford
students have had superb care
for twenty-one years under the
present arrangement. The price
is very low as attested by the
million dollar deficit the Clinic
has incurred in the twenty years
it has been involved. No alterna
tive arrangement would make
available such competence at
such a price. The withdrawal of
the University from furnishing
hospital care has nothing to do
with the Clinic agreement but
is a matter between the students
and the school.
As a matter of fact it was
found that many of the students
were already covered (as are al
most seventy-five percent of all
people) by private insurance for
hospitalization and the Univer
sity's coverage just gave double
coverage and helped the insur
ance companies.
A great single group coverage
for all students deserves some
consideration. In closing it
would be in the interests of good
journalism if the editor had con
sulted with people who know
the facts and the background.

• Scott On Gaieties
Editor, The Daily:
Johnie Scotts' column, like any
other great piece of propoganda,
has, on a quick reading, at least
one each of: grains of truth, un
truths, half-truths, and distor
tions.
1. Grain of truth: We are not
producing the show.
2. Untruth: "Among the state
ments floating around the room
— 'Why, this play is racist and
immoral,' 'Uh, uh, you know we
can't have a play with more
blacks than whites in it!' " Those
statements were uttered at a
meeting with erstwhile director
Bob Fletcher early in August,
with clear sarcasm, by a design
er. It was Fletcher, Johnie's
White Sidekick, who reported
the remarks, removed the sar
casm, and placed them at the
September 23 meeting, where
the subject was never mentioned
by anybody.
3. Untruth: "... the deci
sion by the Board not to do the
script." At the September 23
meeting, Bob Fletcher proposed
a set of physically impossible
requirements for doing the show,
proceeded to admit that they
were impossible, and went on to

say that he would not do the
show anyway.
4. Distortion: "Black art . . .
cannot enter the System normal
ly ... " Black art probably
could have entered "the Sys
tem" normally. Unfortunately, as
Johnie admitted to me when I
discussed the play with him in
August, his play "sounded as if
it had been written by a white
middle-class liberal college stu
dent."
5. Half-truth: The "censors"
did indeed keep Johnie from us
ing any profanity. Unfortunate
ly, the, censor was, as Johnie also
told me in August, Bob Fletcher,
who never was or will be a
Ram's Head Board Member.
KARL ERICK BURTON
• Sex Course Dropped
Editor, The Daily:
Last spring quarter Dr. B.
Otis Cobb of the Health Educa
tion Department taught his last
course at Stanford. The course
was "Marriage and the Family."
Now it seems that Stanford
is "streamlining" *its curricu
lum and that the course will dis
appear from Stanford after this
year, along with the phasing out
of the rest of the Health Educa
tion Department.
Dr. Cobb was a controversial
teacher. Many students thought
he delighted in flaunting "ob
scene" four-letter words. Some
students have called him a "dirty
old man" and a "pervert." But
he was not.
He was an interesting teacher
who made students think about
the quirks of sexual taboos in
our culture and who broadened
our viewpoints.
"Marriage and the Family,"
too, has been much maligned.
Just mention to your friends
that you're taking "Marriage
and the Family" and watch
their reactions, such as "Oh,
taking a mick" or "Looking for
3 easy units of A, huh?"
The Administration shares
this lack of regard for the course
as evidenced by its planning to
drop the course as well as the
department that offers it.
"Marriage and the Family,"
however, is a worthwhile course,
and most students would admit
they got something besides a
grade out of it. Students ask for
courses that are relevant to
relevant to them, and "Marriage
and the Family" is one of the
most relevant courses at Stan
ford.
The course awakes students
to the realities of an interper
sonal relationship such as mar
riage and discusses the family,
perhaps the most important
group in our tradition-lacking
and restless society. Probably no
other course approximates this
coverage.
But the University feels it
must move "forward," leaving

such a course behind. Perhaps
Stanford should ask itself "Quo
vadis?"

Editor, The DAILY:
In light of the heated cam

one of the major campaign is
sues that have been thrown

would be of interest:
"The streets of our coun

rebelling and rioting. Commu

ening us with her might, and

"Yes, danger from within

"Yes, without law and or

TIMOTHY GILL
• In Re Morley
Editor, The Daily:
Let me begin by saying that
I find it quite difficult to answer
Mr. Morley's letter to you of Oc
tober 24, for it is difficult to
decide what his position is.
There are, however, several
points which I can answer. The
first concerns just how many
that I, as Shop Steward in the
English Department, represent.
Presently, thirty-three Teaching
Assistants and three Acting In
structors (who also teach Fresh
man English at only a slightly
higher salary than the Teaching
Assistants do) are members of
the AFT Union.
In addition, four Teaching As
sistants have written letters to
Provost Lyman supporting us
In this matter of higher salaries.
As a result, we can say that I
represent forty (out of a pos

sible fifty-three) members of the
English Department staff in this
issue.
Secondly, I am glad that Mr.
Morley used the phrase "crea
ture comforts," for this is ex
actly what we are asking for:
enough money to live on in the
Bay Area. At present, we earn
$2,300 minus taxes ($200). We
are not asking for an exorbitant
amount of money (or to be able
to live in "style"), only enough
to raise our incomes to some
thing very slightly above the
poverty level.
As it stands now, we have to
borrow money for dental care,
for hospitalization insurance, for
car upkeep (and everyone would
agree that a car is a necessity
in this area), occasionally even
for food.
Also, I might point out that
we are people with the equiva
lents of M.A. degrees who per
form a valuable service for the
University, not only in terms of
leading class meetings but also
in the time we spend outside of
class with each student (in some
cases, this is more valuable than
contact in the classroom).
We are asking for a more
reasonable compensation for the
service we perform, and the Ad
ministration has acknowledged
that we deserve more. The ques
tion is where the money will
come from, and the present ne
gotiations are an attempt to de
cide not only where the money
will come from and if it avail

able, but also what priorities the
Administration uses when it dis
tributes money.
Thirdly, as to the political af
filiates of our Union. Mr. Mor
ley raised two points. As to the
first, our inherent support of
the A.F.T. in New York, I know
of no Union member who sup
ports their action; and our con
vention delegate is at present
working with the New Caucus
(a coalition of "radicals" and
blacks), which is going so far as
to counter-picket and to teach
freedom schools while the regu
lar schools are closed.
As to the second point, the
National A.F.T.'s support of
Humphrey, our local's dues are
not used as contributions to his
campaign (a separate founda
tion, COPE, which asks that
each local join it, makes the con
tributions). I would also ask Mr.
Morley who he would have the
National support. Nixon or Wal
lace?
Finally, let me say that we
will be glad to inform the Ad
ministration that Mr. Morley
does not wish to be considered
for a pay raise and is perhaps
even willing to take a cut in
salary.

• Racism In Union?
Editor, The Daily:
I take exception to Mr. Ed
ward F. Morley's off-the-cuff

attack of the members of New
York City's United Federation
of Teachers as members of a
"white racist union which has
been denying thousands of black
children a meaningful educa
tion in New York City."
I do not wish to enter into an
exhaustive analysis of that sad
dispute at this time, but I would
suggest that a further investi
gation of the facts would shed
more light on the subject. There
are many more things at stake
right now in New York City
than the school system.
President Shanker of the UFT
has accused Mayor Lindsay of
attempting to destroy the union.
The financial support of the
secessionist Ocean Hill-Browns
ville district is coming from
sources whose motives are ques
tionable. The future of labor
unions might very well be at
stake in New York City.
Can all unions remain strong
after one is destroyed? And to
call a union "racist" because it
is fighting for its very existence,
when that fight is not directed
against any minority, is com
pletely ridiculous.
Furthermore, if any act was
"racist" it was that of the school
district's governing board in
summarily dismissing instruc
tors (when they had no such
power) not on the basis of com
petence but merely because they
were white. This, and only this,
was the original cause of the
strike. Now it seems that the
issues have become far more in
volved and important. But does
such a history deserve Mr. Mor
ley's epithet "racist"?
In his all-encompassing state
ment Mr. Morley completely dis
misses these central issues in
the conflict, with an appeal to
unjustified and completely un
called-for smear tactics!
What I wish to address myself
to is just that smear. It seems
that many people are allowing
themselves the luxury of adding
flowery, parenthetical phrases to
their arguments in the hope that
such smears will support the
rest of their shaky position. It
has gotten to the point that no

discussion of any topic is com
plete without such empty words.
The phrases "low and order,"
"anarchists and nihilists," "im
perialism," and "white racism"
are choking communication to
the point that one cannot under
stand what anyone is saying.
How can anyone unite or get to
gether when all that one is asked
to unite under is a bag of cliches,
which mean little or nothing?
Lastly, to link the students in
the Stanford group with any oth
er union is absurd, since each
local has its own separate prob
lems. And to attempt to defame
the Stanford group by associat
ing them with another group
which has been foully and
wrongfully smeared is the very
height of irresponsibility!!

• TA Demand Unwise
Editor, The Daily:
Without commenting on the
other demands of the Political
Science TA's (the Daily, 17 Oc
tober), I wish to point out that
the demand of payment of $300
for each dependent of a TA is
extremely unwise. If Stanford
were to pay TA's some fixed
salary and in addition pay $300
for each dependent, the Univer
sity would in effect be reward
ing those TA's foolish enough to
have children that they could
not afford.
The folly of indiscriminate re
production is being realized by
an increasing number of in
formed people, due in part to the
presence of such excellent books
as Dr. Paul Ehrlich's The Pop
ulation Bomb (95c in paper
back). One has only to compare
the Peninsula of five years ago
with the Peninsula today to note
increased smog and traffic con
gestion and a decline in open
space and in park area per per
son.
Since the TA's seem content to
live under the archaic paternal
istic university system, they
should act responsibly and de
mand that Stanford SUBTRACT
$300 for each dependent ( exclud
ing a spouse, which seems rea
sonable). The University should
not be put in the position of
making the population bomb tick
faster.

• Park-in Rejected
Editor, The Daily:
While I support the Grape
Boycott, I find the recent "park
in" unacceptable. To legislate
morality or the "recognition of
social responsibility" is difficult
enough. Nonlegislative coercion
of morality or recognition of so
cial responsibility can easily be
going too far.
Whatever the decision or jus
tification, such action becomes
the will of a minority impressed
upon the general public. If a
student objects to grape sales
and feels therefore he has the
right and obligation to physic
ally obstruct their sale, then the
Blue Max could find it within his
right and responsibility to phy
sically obstruct "communist"
book sales at Kepler's.
So many people have cooper
ated voluntarily with the Grape
Boycott. Why lose support from
those people who believe in free
dom of choice, choice to estab
lish a union and choice to buy
grapes, by making "Safeway

recognize their social responsi
bility"?
MARK Zl. EDWARDS, Jr.
History
• Grape Myths
Editor, The Dally:
I wonder how many Stanford
students bothered to inform
themselves of the facts before
they voted to support the United
Farm Workers in the so-called
grape dispute. My husband and
I spent half the summer in De
lano to learn firsthand what is
happening. Here are the facts:
1. The grape worker portray
ed as a struggling, poor, and ex
ploited group is a myth. The
workers who are presently in
the fields have been harvesting
the crops formany years. Many
of the families live in and
around Delano, and for some of
them picking grapes is a sec
ond job within the family. For
the past two years these work
ers have endured insults, threats,
and general harrassment from
outsiders — demonstrators who
have never been in the fields.
2. Field workers have declared
they want no part of Chavez or
his union, so students who vote
to support the United Farm
Workers are not supporting
grape pickers at all.
3. The union wants "to get"
$1.65 for the workers. Grape
pickers are already receiving an
hourly wage of $1.50 plus a 25
cent bonus per box (three boxes
per hour minimum). I missed
out on the "new math," but that
adds up to a $2.25 minimum in
my book.
4. The farmer hires through a
crew boss, and the workers make
their demands of the farmer
through that same crew boss.
When the crop is ripe on the
vine, the crew has all the bar
gaining power in the world.
5. If the students are well
meaning, then certainly they are
misinformed, or are they merely
expousing a Cause — real or
myth — for the sake of "getting
involved." They are supporting
a boycott which has been de
clared illegal. If the boycott is
successful and grape growers
are forced to turn to mechanized
crops, what will become of the
workers? Whom will the union
attempt to organize then?

• Olympic Protest
Editor, The Dally:
I wish to reply to the support
you gave Tommy Smith and
John Carlos in the recent pro
test during the Olympic award
ceremonies. It is difficult to de
termine from the article "Track
Power" whether you justify the
protest on grounds that Hitler
oriented the Games correctly,
that they should be used for po
litical demonstration, or that
such use, although deplorable,
exists in some forms, and that,
therefore, the Olympic Commit
tees should allow it in any form.
The former attitude would, I
believe, be the demise of the
Olympic Games — the athletic
competition would dissolve amid
the acidity of the countless num
ber of bitter political struggles
which continually seethe; such
an attitude would condone Czech
demonstrations against the So
viets, Biaffran against Federalist
Nigeria, Pakistani against India,
Arab against Jew. The Olympic
Games in such an atmosphere
would no longer exist as an
athletic competition.
True, that underlying the
Games is a quite discernable
current of political rivalry, but
to support a perpetration of
wrong simply on the grounds of
its existence has no rational
basis whatsoever and would con
demn any human institution re
gardless of the amount of posi
tive good it was accomplishing.
The simple fact that one
agrees with the cause being
furthered has no bearing on the
legitimacy of its expression, and
support of Tommy Smith and
John Carlos would also affirm
the right to raise a white glove
and demonstrate hideously for
an all-white America. I despise
the latter and because of it, do
not wish to see the former; I
think the Olympic Games are
worth saving from the political
beast which constantly tries to
devour them.

In a recent Dally Miss Marta

at the doors of Memorial Audi

I think it is appropriate for
me to clarify what our practice
is in this regard. In Memorial
Auditorium the official registra
tion materials and nothing but
official registration materials are
distributed to new students and
continuing students. Official stu
dent organizations and depart
ments of the University are per
mitted to insert materials in a
packet which is distributed to
students as they enter Memorial
Auditorium.
The Student Financial Man
ager is in general charge of
seeing to it that only official or
ganizations do insert materials,
and Alpha Phi Omega coordi
nates putting the packets togeth
er. This practice was inaugurat
ed six to eight years ago, sup
erseding an earlier situation in
which from fifteen to thirty
representatives or organizations
would be handing out things
separately.
This arrangement was orgin
ally worked out with the then

• KZSU Policy
Editor, The Dally:
In reference to a recent front
page article, "Cleaver's Speech
Sparks New KZSU Liberaliza
tion," there are several mis-lead
ing statements which, I believe,
require immediate clarification.
1) The "new" policy can hard
ly be termed a liberalization over
KZSU's past policy. Since 1964,
KZSU has permitted and en
couraged the broadcasting of all
shades of opinion, from George
Lincoln Rockwell's speech on
Negro inferiority to last spring's
series on Racism in America.
2) Having authored this
"new" policy, J. can assure you
that the statement "any pro
gram, regardless of content, will
be permitted on the air" is quite
false. There are a number of
restrictions on profanity, libel,
slander, and most importantly,
on requiring responsible spokes
men.
KZSU will censor no one for
his views, but neither will the
station become the mouthpiece
of every student, faculty or staff
member who wants to hear his
own voice. KZSU's "new" policy
is an improvement, if for no
other reason than the fact that
it puts in writing what has been
verbally "accepted" for years.
The station will have complete
copies of this policy available
soon for those interested. I
would hope that before anyone
"demands" a show on KZSU,
they take the time to read the
requirements they must meet.

• Health History
Editor, THE DAILY:
As the architect of the Stan

ford Student Health Service, I
am interested in the comments
in the box in the Daily. It might
help to "look at the record." It
might also help to correct some
mis-apprehensions which are in
the mind of the writer of the
editorial.
In 1946 when the health ser
vice was started, Stanford was
faced with a crisis. The health
service—one man only — was
swamped. The return of the sol
diers skyrocketed enrollments.
The shortage of doctors was
acute. Up to this time a sick
student found a doctor —if he
could—got treatment —good or
bad (the student could not judge
which) and paid whatever this
doctor chose to charge.
Stanford approached me in
some desperation to see if the
Palo Alto Clinic could help. We
worked out the details of the
health service—simply that the
University would pay the Clinic
a capitation fee (i.e. so much
per head) and the Clinic would
maintain an infirmary and give
the students complete compre
hensive care. The University
undertook to self insure for the
hospital bills.
I can say positively that for
twenty-two years the students
of Stanford have had superb
care under this arrangement.
There has been a doctor or doc
tors available every hour, day
and night, Sundays and holi
days, school days and vacations.
And during this whole period
there have been no medical ca
tastrophes except the regretta
ble, inevitable, and unprevent
able suicides. There has been no
instance of serious neglect or
lack of skill. The price the Uni
versity has paid by all insurance
standards has been ridiculously
low — particularly when there
are no deductibles, no co-insur
ance, and no reservations except
pregnancy and long time psy
chosis.
During this period the cost to
the Clinic of the services ren
dered has exceeded the amount
paid by an average of $44,621 a
year or a total for the twenty
one years ending in 1967 of
$936,441. Almost a million dol
lars in supplies and services
have been contributed by the
Clinic to the Stanford Student
Body. This fact is not mentioned.
The proposal that the medical
school take over the health ser
vice is not original with you. It
has been discussed and exam
ined in great detail. The answer
is simply that with their present
personnel whose time is com
pletely taken up with teaching
and research they cannot do it.
It is possible that the health
service might be staffed with
medical students and interns.
I do not believe the Stanford
students who have had free ac
cess to all the mature specialists
in one of the greatest medical
clinics in the country would like
this. If the medical school takes
on this task, they would have
to hire doctors hopefully of the
competence of the clinic doctors
to do the work.
The faculty can't do it in their
spare time. And the situation of

shortage of doctors is such that
they simply cannot get such
men. The privilege of Clinic as
sociation which is highly valued
makes it possible for the health
service to be staffed by highly
skilled men. And, of course, all
the one hundred thirty doctors
in the Clinic are available to
students who need them.
Apparently the writer of the
editorial does not understand
that the Clinic does not profit
when more students are referred
to it. The idea of stationing a
fulltime orthopedist at Cowell is
silly. No orthopedist of sufficient
competence to be worthy to care
for the students would accept
such an assignment.
In summary — the Stanford
students have had superb care
for twenty-one years under the
present arrangement. The price
is very low as attested by the
million dollar deficit the Clinic
has incurred in the twenty years
it has been involved. No alterna
tive arrangement would make
available such competence at
such a price. The withdrawal of
the University from furnishing
hospital care has nothing to do
with the Clinic agreement but
is a matter between the students
and the school.
As a matter of fact it was
found that many of the students
were already covered (as are al
most seventy-five percent of all
people) by private insurance for
hospitalization and the Univer
sity's coverage just gave double
coverage and helped the insur
ance companies.
A great single group coverage
for all students deserves some
consideration. In closing it
would be in the interests of good
journalism if the editor had con
sulted with people who know
the facts and the background.

• Scott On Gaieties
Editor, The Daily:
Johnie Scotts' column, like any
other great piece of propoganda,
has, on a quick reading, at least
one each of: grains of truth, un
truths, half-truths, and distor
tions.
1. Grain of truth: We are not
producing the show.
2. Untruth: "Among the state
ments floating around the room
— 'Why, this play is racist and
immoral,' 'Uh, uh, you know we
can't have a play with more
blacks than whites in it!' " Those
statements were uttered at a
meeting with erstwhile director
Bob Fletcher early in August,
with clear sarcasm, by a design
er. It was Fletcher, Johnie's
White Sidekick, who reported
the remarks, removed the sar
casm, and placed them at the
September 23 meeting, where
the subject was never mentioned
by anybody.
3. Untruth: "... the deci
sion by the Board not to do the
script." At the September 23
meeting, Bob Fletcher proposed
a set of physically impossible
requirements for doing the show,
proceeded to admit that they
were impossible, and went on to

say that he would not do the
show anyway.
4. Distortion: "Black art . . .
cannot enter the System normal
ly ... " Black art probably
could have entered "the Sys
tem" normally. Unfortunately, as
Johnie admitted to me when I
discussed the play with him in
August, his play "sounded as if
it had been written by a white
middle-class liberal college stu
dent."
5. Half-truth: The "censors"
did indeed keep Johnie from us
ing any profanity. Unfortunate
ly, the, censor was, as Johnie also
told me in August, Bob Fletcher,
who never was or will be a
Ram's Head Board Member.
KARL ERICK BURTON
• Sex Course Dropped
Editor, The Daily:
Last spring quarter Dr. B.
Otis Cobb of the Health Educa
tion Department taught his last
course at Stanford. The course
was "Marriage and the Family."
Now it seems that Stanford
is "streamlining" *its curricu
lum and that the course will dis
appear from Stanford after this
year, along with the phasing out
of the rest of the Health Educa
tion Department.
Dr. Cobb was a controversial
teacher. Many students thought
he delighted in flaunting "ob
scene" four-letter words. Some
students have called him a "dirty
old man" and a "pervert." But
he was not.
He was an interesting teacher
who made students think about
the quirks of sexual taboos in
our culture and who broadened
our viewpoints.
"Marriage and the Family,"
too, has been much maligned.
Just mention to your friends
that you're taking "Marriage
and the Family" and watch
their reactions, such as "Oh,
taking a mick" or "Looking for
3 easy units of A, huh?"
The Administration shares
this lack of regard for the course
as evidenced by its planning to
drop the course as well as the
department that offers it.
"Marriage and the Family,"
however, is a worthwhile course,
and most students would admit
they got something besides a
grade out of it. Students ask for
courses that are relevant to
relevant to them, and "Marriage
and the Family" is one of the
most relevant courses at Stan
ford.
The course awakes students
to the realities of an interper
sonal relationship such as mar
riage and discusses the family,
perhaps the most important
group in our tradition-lacking
and restless society. Probably no
other course approximates this
coverage.
But the University feels it
must move "forward," leaving

such a course behind. Perhaps
Stanford should ask itself "Quo
vadis?"

Editor, The DAILY:
In light of the heated cam
paign that we have witnessed
during the past months, and of
one of the major campaign is
sues that have been thrown

would be of interest:
"The streets of our coun
try are in turmoil. The univer
sities are filled with students
rebelling and rioting. Commu
nists are seeking to destroy
our country. Russia Is threat
ening us with her might, and
the Republic is in danger.
"Yes, danger from within
and from without. We need

"Yes, without law and or
der, our nation cannot survive.
We are laughed at by other
nations because of the disor
der in our streets caused by
the students and the Commu
nists.
"Elect us, and we, we shall
restore law and order. We
shall by law and order be re

TIMOTHY GILL
• In Re Morley
Editor, The Daily:
Let me begin by saying that
I find it quite difficult to answer
Mr. Morley's letter to you of Oc
tober 24, for it is difficult to
decide what his position is.
There are, however, several
points which I can answer. The
first concerns just how many
that I, as Shop Steward in the
English Department, represent.
Presently, thirty-three Teaching
Assistants and three Acting In
structors (who also teach Fresh
man English at only a slightly
higher salary than the Teaching
Assistants do) are members of
the AFT Union.
In addition, four Teaching As
sistants have written letters to
Provost Lyman supporting us
In this matter of higher salaries.
As a result, we can say that I
represent forty (out of a pos

sible fifty-three) members of the
English Department staff in this
issue.
Secondly, I am glad that Mr.
Morley used the phrase "crea
ture comforts," for this is ex
actly what we are asking for:
enough money to live on in the
Bay Area. At present, we earn
$2,300 minus taxes ($200). We
are not asking for an exorbitant
amount of money (or to be able
to live in "style"), only enough
to raise our incomes to some
thing very slightly above the
poverty level.
As it stands now, we have to
borrow money for dental care,
for hospitalization insurance, for
car upkeep (and everyone would
agree that a car is a necessity
in this area), occasionally even
for food.
Also, I might point out that
we are people with the equiva
lents of M.A. degrees who per
form a valuable service for the
University, not only in terms of
leading class meetings but also
in the time we spend outside of
class with each student (in some
cases, this is more valuable than
contact in the classroom).
We are asking for a more
reasonable compensation for the
service we perform, and the Ad
ministration has acknowledged
that we deserve more. The ques
tion is where the money will
come from, and the present ne
gotiations are an attempt to de
cide not only where the money
will come from and if it avail

able, but also what priorities the
Administration uses when it dis
tributes money.
Thirdly, as to the political af
filiates of our Union. Mr. Mor
ley raised two points. As to the
first, our inherent support of
the A.F.T. in New York, I know
of no Union member who sup
ports their action; and our con
vention delegate is at present
working with the New Caucus
(a coalition of "radicals" and
blacks), which is going so far as
to counter-picket and to teach
freedom schools while the regu
lar schools are closed.
As to the second point, the
National A.F.T.'s support of
Humphrey, our local's dues are
not used as contributions to his
campaign (a separate founda
tion, COPE, which asks that
each local join it, makes the con
tributions). I would also ask Mr.
Morley who he would have the
National support. Nixon or Wal
lace?
Finally, let me say that we
will be glad to inform the Ad
ministration that Mr. Morley
does not wish to be considered
for a pay raise and is perhaps
even willing to take a cut in
salary.

• Racism In Union?
Editor, The Daily:
I take exception to Mr. Ed
ward F. Morley's off-the-cuff

attack of the members of New
York City's United Federation
of Teachers as members of a
"white racist union which has
been denying thousands of black
children a meaningful educa
tion in New York City."
I do not wish to enter into an
exhaustive analysis of that sad
dispute at this time, but I would
suggest that a further investi
gation of the facts would shed
more light on the subject. There
are many more things at stake
right now in New York City
than the school system.
President Shanker of the UFT
has accused Mayor Lindsay of
attempting to destroy the union.
The financial support of the
secessionist Ocean Hill-Browns
ville district is coming from
sources whose motives are ques
tionable. The future of labor
unions might very well be at
stake in New York City.
Can all unions remain strong
after one is destroyed? And to
call a union "racist" because it
is fighting for its very existence,
when that fight is not directed
against any minority, is com
pletely ridiculous.
Furthermore, if any act was
"racist" it was that of the school
district's governing board in
summarily dismissing instruc
tors (when they had no such
power) not on the basis of com
petence but merely because they
were white. This, and only this,
was the original cause of the
strike. Now it seems that the
issues have become far more in
volved and important. But does
such a history deserve Mr. Mor
ley's epithet "racist"?
In his all-encompassing state
ment Mr. Morley completely dis
misses these central issues in
the conflict, with an appeal to
unjustified and completely un
called-for smear tactics!
What I wish to address myself
to is just that smear. It seems
that many people are allowing
themselves the luxury of adding
flowery, parenthetical phrases to
their arguments in the hope that
such smears will support the
rest of their shaky position. It
has gotten to the point that no

discussion of any topic is com
plete without such empty words.
The phrases "low and order,"
"anarchists and nihilists," "im
perialism," and "white racism"
are choking communication to
the point that one cannot under
stand what anyone is saying.
How can anyone unite or get to
gether when all that one is asked
to unite under is a bag of cliches,
which mean little or nothing?
Lastly, to link the students in
the Stanford group with any oth
er union is absurd, since each
local has its own separate prob
lems. And to attempt to defame
the Stanford group by associat
ing them with another group
which has been foully and
wrongfully smeared is the very
height of irresponsibility!!

• TA Demand Unwise
Editor, The Daily:
Without commenting on the
other demands of the Political
Science TA's (the Daily, 17 Oc
tober), I wish to point out that
the demand of payment of $300
for each dependent of a TA is
extremely unwise. If Stanford
were to pay TA's some fixed
salary and in addition pay $300
for each dependent, the Univer
sity would in effect be reward
ing those TA's foolish enough to
have children that they could
not afford.
The folly of indiscriminate re
production is being realized by
an increasing number of in
formed people, due in part to the
presence of such excellent books
as Dr. Paul Ehrlich's The Pop
ulation Bomb (95c in paper
back). One has only to compare
the Peninsula of five years ago
with the Peninsula today to note
increased smog and traffic con
gestion and a decline in open
space and in park area per per
son.
Since the TA's seem content to
live under the archaic paternal
istic university system, they
should act responsibly and de
mand that Stanford SUBTRACT
$300 for each dependent ( exclud
ing a spouse, which seems rea
sonable). The University should
not be put in the position of
making the population bomb tick
faster.

• Park-in Rejected
Editor, The Daily:
While I support the Grape
Boycott, I find the recent "park
in" unacceptable. To legislate
morality or the "recognition of
social responsibility" is difficult
enough. Nonlegislative coercion
of morality or recognition of so
cial responsibility can easily be
going too far.
Whatever the decision or jus
tification, such action becomes
the will of a minority impressed
upon the general public. If a
student objects to grape sales
and feels therefore he has the
right and obligation to physic
ally obstruct their sale, then the
Blue Max could find it within his
right and responsibility to phy
sically obstruct "communist"
book sales at Kepler's.
So many people have cooper
ated voluntarily with the Grape
Boycott. Why lose support from
those people who believe in free
dom of choice, choice to estab
lish a union and choice to buy
grapes, by making "Safeway

recognize their social responsi
bility"?
MARK Zl. EDWARDS, Jr.
History
• Grape Myths
Editor, The Dally:
I wonder how many Stanford
students bothered to inform
themselves of the facts before
they voted to support the United
Farm Workers in the so-called
grape dispute. My husband and
I spent half the summer in De
lano to learn firsthand what is
happening. Here are the facts:
1. The grape worker portray
ed as a struggling, poor, and ex
ploited group is a myth. The
workers who are presently in
the fields have been harvesting
the crops formany years. Many
of the families live in and
around Delano, and for some of
them picking grapes is a sec
ond job within the family. For
the past two years these work
ers have endured insults, threats,
and general harrassment from
outsiders — demonstrators who
have never been in the fields.
2. Field workers have declared
they want no part of Chavez or
his union, so students who vote
to support the United Farm
Workers are not supporting
grape pickers at all.
3. The union wants "to get"
$1.65 for the workers. Grape
pickers are already receiving an
hourly wage of $1.50 plus a 25
cent bonus per box (three boxes
per hour minimum). I missed
out on the "new math," but that
adds up to a $2.25 minimum in
my book.
4. The farmer hires through a
crew boss, and the workers make
their demands of the farmer
through that same crew boss.
When the crop is ripe on the
vine, the crew has all the bar
gaining power in the world.
5. If the students are well
meaning, then certainly they are
misinformed, or are they merely
expousing a Cause — real or
myth — for the sake of "getting
involved." They are supporting
a boycott which has been de
clared illegal. If the boycott is
successful and grape growers
are forced to turn to mechanized
crops, what will become of the
workers? Whom will the union
attempt to organize then?

Certainly your stand on the

not be disputed. But one must
take issue with the last sentence

Whatever may be your view

Editor, The DAILY:
In reading the account of Fa

caught by his question as quot
ed by your reporter: "Would the
Jewish prosecutor have prose
cuted the nine of us in Germany
during World War II for burn
ing one of Hitler's draft files?"
This question it seems to me
is selfdefeating since no Jews
occupied responsible positions in
Hitler's Germany during World
War 11. They were either dead,

that Father Berrigan weakens

• Errors On May field
Editor, THE DAILY
In the article "Mayfield Resur

tural deficiencies were incorrect
ly reported:
1. Poor heating system—four
new 4,000 watt fan forced ther
mostatically controlled electrical
heaters were installed on the
third floor of Mayfield House
and the existing heating system
is being thoroughly checked and
repaired.
2. Condemned kitchen—the old
ATO kitchen was not con
demned by the County of Santa
Clara Health Department. The
kitchen was not opened because
of the large renovation cost to
raise the kitchen to a standard
equivalent to other university
residences and because of the
large operating losses incurred
when operating a kitchen serv
ing 40 residents. Instead, a food
service program was initiated
with Roth and Guthrie Houses.
3. Faulty wiring—all wiring,
fixtures and appliances are in
stalled in accordance with the
State of California Electrical
Safety Orders and certified to
the county of Santa Clara Fire
Marshal's office by a licensed

4. Wooden fire escape — the

• Olympic Protest
Editor, The Dally:
I wish to reply to the support
you gave Tommy Smith and
John Carlos in the recent pro
test during the Olympic award
ceremonies. It is difficult to de
termine from the article "Track
Power" whether you justify the
protest on grounds that Hitler
oriented the Games correctly,
that they should be used for po
litical demonstration, or that
such use, although deplorable,
exists in some forms, and that,
therefore, the Olympic Commit
tees should allow it in any form.
The former attitude would, I
believe, be the demise of the
Olympic Games — the athletic
competition would dissolve amid
the acidity of the countless num
ber of bitter political struggles
which continually seethe; such
an attitude would condone Czech
demonstrations against the So
viets, Biaffran against Federalist
Nigeria, Pakistani against India,
Arab against Jew. The Olympic
Games in such an atmosphere
would no longer exist as an
athletic competition.
True, that underlying the
Games is a quite discernable
current of political rivalry, but
to support a perpetration of
wrong simply on the grounds of
its existence has no rational
basis whatsoever and would con
demn any human institution re
gardless of the amount of posi
tive good it was accomplishing.
The simple fact that one
agrees with the cause being
furthered has no bearing on the
legitimacy of its expression, and
support of Tommy Smith and
John Carlos would also affirm
the right to raise a white glove
and demonstrate hideously for
an all-white America. I despise
the latter and because of it, do
not wish to see the former; I
think the Olympic Games are
worth saving from the political
beast which constantly tries to
devour them.

gram, regardless of content, will
be permitted on the air" is quite
false. There are a number of
restrictions on profanity, libel,
slander, and most importantly,
on requiring responsible spokes
men.
KZSU will censor no one for
his views, but neither will the
station become the mouthpiece
of every student, faculty or staff
member who wants to hear his
own voice. KZSU's "new" policy
is an improvement, if for no
other reason than the fact that
it puts in writing what has been
verbally "accepted" for years.
The station will have complete
copies of this policy available
soon for those interested. I
would hope that before anyone
"demands" a show on KZSU,
they take the time to read the
requirements they must meet.

• Health History
Editor, THE DAILY:
As the architect of the Stan

ford Student Health Service, I
am interested in the comments
in the box in the Daily. It might
help to "look at the record." It
might also help to correct some
mis-apprehensions which are in
the mind of the writer of the
editorial.
In 1946 when the health ser
vice was started, Stanford was
faced with a crisis. The health
service—one man only — was
swamped. The return of the sol
diers skyrocketed enrollments.
The shortage of doctors was
acute. Up to this time a sick
student found a doctor —if he
could—got treatment —good or
bad (the student could not judge
which) and paid whatever this
doctor chose to charge.
Stanford approached me in
some desperation to see if the
Palo Alto Clinic could help. We
worked out the details of the
health service—simply that the
University would pay the Clinic
a capitation fee (i.e. so much
per head) and the Clinic would
maintain an infirmary and give
the students complete compre
hensive care. The University
undertook to self insure for the
hospital bills.
I can say positively that for
twenty-two years the students
of Stanford have had superb
care under this arrangement.
There has been a doctor or doc
tors available every hour, day
and night, Sundays and holi
days, school days and vacations.
And during this whole period
there have been no medical ca
tastrophes except the regretta
ble, inevitable, and unprevent
able suicides. There has been no
instance of serious neglect or
lack of skill. The price the Uni
versity has paid by all insurance
standards has been ridiculously
low — particularly when there
are no deductibles, no co-insur
ance, and no reservations except
pregnancy and long time psy
chosis.
During this period the cost to
the Clinic of the services ren
dered has exceeded the amount
paid by an average of $44,621 a
year or a total for the twenty
one years ending in 1967 of
$936,441. Almost a million dol
lars in supplies and services
have been contributed by the
Clinic to the Stanford Student
Body. This fact is not mentioned.
The proposal that the medical
school take over the health ser
vice is not original with you. It
has been discussed and exam
ined in great detail. The answer
is simply that with their present
personnel whose time is com
pletely taken up with teaching
and research they cannot do it.
It is possible that the health
service might be staffed with
medical students and interns.
I do not believe the Stanford
students who have had free ac
cess to all the mature specialists
in one of the greatest medical
clinics in the country would like
this. If the medical school takes
on this task, they would have
to hire doctors hopefully of the
competence of the clinic doctors
to do the work.
The faculty can't do it in their
spare time. And the situation of

shortage of doctors is such that
they simply cannot get such
men. The privilege of Clinic as
sociation which is highly valued
makes it possible for the health
service to be staffed by highly
skilled men. And, of course, all
the one hundred thirty doctors
in the Clinic are available to
students who need them.
Apparently the writer of the
editorial does not understand
that the Clinic does not profit
when more students are referred
to it. The idea of stationing a
fulltime orthopedist at Cowell is
silly. No orthopedist of sufficient
competence to be worthy to care
for the students would accept
such an assignment.
In summary — the Stanford
students have had superb care
for twenty-one years under the
present arrangement. The price
is very low as attested by the
million dollar deficit the Clinic
has incurred in the twenty years
it has been involved. No alterna
tive arrangement would make
available such competence at
such a price. The withdrawal of
the University from furnishing
hospital care has nothing to do
with the Clinic agreement but
is a matter between the students
and the school.
As a matter of fact it was
found that many of the students
were already covered (as are al
most seventy-five percent of all
people) by private insurance for
hospitalization and the Univer
sity's coverage just gave double
coverage and helped the insur
ance companies.
A great single group coverage
for all students deserves some
consideration. In closing it
would be in the interests of good
journalism if the editor had con
sulted with people who know
the facts and the background.

• Scott On Gaieties
Editor, The Daily:
Johnie Scotts' column, like any
other great piece of propoganda,
has, on a quick reading, at least
one each of: grains of truth, un
truths, half-truths, and distor
tions.
1. Grain of truth: We are not
producing the show.
2. Untruth: "Among the state
ments floating around the room
— 'Why, this play is racist and
immoral,' 'Uh, uh, you know we
can't have a play with more
blacks than whites in it!' " Those
statements were uttered at a
meeting with erstwhile director
Bob Fletcher early in August,
with clear sarcasm, by a design
er. It was Fletcher, Johnie's
White Sidekick, who reported
the remarks, removed the sar
casm, and placed them at the
September 23 meeting, where
the subject was never mentioned
by anybody.
3. Untruth: "... the deci
sion by the Board not to do the
script." At the September 23
meeting, Bob Fletcher proposed
a set of physically impossible
requirements for doing the show,
proceeded to admit that they
were impossible, and went on to

say that he would not do the
show anyway.
4. Distortion: "Black art . . .
cannot enter the System normal
ly ... " Black art probably
could have entered "the Sys
tem" normally. Unfortunately, as
Johnie admitted to me when I
discussed the play with him in
August, his play "sounded as if
it had been written by a white
middle-class liberal college stu
dent."
5. Half-truth: The "censors"
did indeed keep Johnie from us
ing any profanity. Unfortunate
ly, the, censor was, as Johnie also
told me in August, Bob Fletcher,
who never was or will be a
Ram's Head Board Member.

• Sex Course Dropped
Editor, The Daily:
Last spring quarter Dr. B.
Otis Cobb of the Health Educa
tion Department taught his last
course at Stanford. The course
was "Marriage and the Family."
Now it seems that Stanford
is "streamlining" *its curricu
lum and that the course will dis
appear from Stanford after this
year, along with the phasing out
of the rest of the Health Educa
tion Department.
Dr. Cobb was a controversial
teacher. Many students thought
he delighted in flaunting "ob
scene" four-letter words. Some
students have called him a "dirty
old man" and a "pervert." But
he was not.
He was an interesting teacher
who made students think about
the quirks of sexual taboos in
our culture and who broadened
our viewpoints.
"Marriage and the Family,"
too, has been much maligned.
Just mention to your friends
that you're taking "Marriage
and the Family" and watch
their reactions, such as "Oh,
taking a mick" or "Looking for
3 easy units of A, huh?"
The Administration shares
this lack of regard for the course
as evidenced by its planning to
drop the course as well as the
department that offers it.
"Marriage and the Family,"
however, is a worthwhile course,
and most students would admit
they got something besides a
grade out of it. Students ask for
courses that are relevant to
relevant to them, and "Marriage
and the Family" is one of the
most relevant courses at Stan
ford.
The course awakes students
to the realities of an interper
sonal relationship such as mar
riage and discusses the family,
perhaps the most important
group in our tradition-lacking
and restless society. Probably no
other course approximates this
coverage.
But the University feels it
must move "forward," leaving

such a course behind. Perhaps
Stanford should ask itself "Quo
vadis?"

Editor, The DAILY:
In light of the heated cam
paign that we have witnessed
during the past months, and of
one of the major campaign is
sues that have been thrown
around, I thought the following
would be of interest:
"The streets of our coun
try are in turmoil. The univer
sities are filled with students
rebelling and rioting. Commu
nists are seeking to destroy
our country. Russia Is threat
ening us with her might, and
the Republic is in danger.
"Yes, danger from within
and from without. We need

"Yes, without law and or
der, our nation cannot survive.
We are laughed at by other
nations because of the disor
der in our streets caused by
the students and the Commu
nists.
"Elect us, and we, we shall
restore law and order. We
shall by law and order be re

TIMOTHY GILL
• In Re Morley
Editor, The Daily:
Let me begin by saying that
I find it quite difficult to answer
Mr. Morley's letter to you of Oc
tober 24, for it is difficult to
decide what his position is.
There are, however, several
points which I can answer. The
first concerns just how many
that I, as Shop Steward in the
English Department, represent.
Presently, thirty-three Teaching
Assistants and three Acting In
structors (who also teach Fresh
man English at only a slightly
higher salary than the Teaching
Assistants do) are members of
the AFT Union.
In addition, four Teaching As
sistants have written letters to
Provost Lyman supporting us
In this matter of higher salaries.
As a result, we can say that I
represent forty (out of a pos

sible fifty-three) members of the
English Department staff in this
issue.
Secondly, I am glad that Mr.
Morley used the phrase "crea
ture comforts," for this is ex
actly what we are asking for:
enough money to live on in the
Bay Area. At present, we earn
$2,300 minus taxes ($200). We
are not asking for an exorbitant
amount of money (or to be able
to live in "style"), only enough
to raise our incomes to some
thing very slightly above the
poverty level.
As it stands now, we have to
borrow money for dental care,
for hospitalization insurance, for
car upkeep (and everyone would
agree that a car is a necessity
in this area), occasionally even
for food.
Also, I might point out that
we are people with the equiva
lents of M.A. degrees who per
form a valuable service for the
University, not only in terms of
leading class meetings but also
in the time we spend outside of
class with each student (in some
cases, this is more valuable than
contact in the classroom).
We are asking for a more
reasonable compensation for the
service we perform, and the Ad
ministration has acknowledged
that we deserve more. The ques
tion is where the money will
come from, and the present ne
gotiations are an attempt to de
cide not only where the money
will come from and if it avail

able, but also what priorities the
Administration uses when it dis
tributes money.
Thirdly, as to the political af
filiates of our Union. Mr. Mor
ley raised two points. As to the
first, our inherent support of
the A.F.T. in New York, I know
of no Union member who sup
ports their action; and our con
vention delegate is at present
working with the New Caucus
(a coalition of "radicals" and
blacks), which is going so far as
to counter-picket and to teach
freedom schools while the regu
lar schools are closed.
As to the second point, the
National A.F.T.'s support of
Humphrey, our local's dues are
not used as contributions to his
campaign (a separate founda
tion, COPE, which asks that
each local join it, makes the con
tributions). I would also ask Mr.
Morley who he would have the
National support. Nixon or Wal
lace?
Finally, let me say that we
will be glad to inform the Ad
ministration that Mr. Morley
does not wish to be considered
for a pay raise and is perhaps
even willing to take a cut in
salary.

• Racism In Union?
Editor, The Daily:
I take exception to Mr. Ed
ward F. Morley's off-the-cuff

attack of the members of New
York City's United Federation
of Teachers as members of a
"white racist union which has
been denying thousands of black
children a meaningful educa
tion in New York City."
I do not wish to enter into an
exhaustive analysis of that sad
dispute at this time, but I would
suggest that a further investi
gation of the facts would shed
more light on the subject. There
are many more things at stake
right now in New York City
than the school system.
President Shanker of the UFT
has accused Mayor Lindsay of
attempting to destroy the union.
The financial support of the
secessionist Ocean Hill-Browns
ville district is coming from
sources whose motives are ques
tionable. The future of labor
unions might very well be at
stake in New York City.
Can all unions remain strong
after one is destroyed? And to
call a union "racist" because it
is fighting for its very existence,
when that fight is not directed
against any minority, is com
pletely ridiculous.
Furthermore, if any act was
"racist" it was that of the school
district's governing board in
summarily dismissing instruc
tors (when they had no such
power) not on the basis of com
petence but merely because they
were white. This, and only this,
was the original cause of the
strike. Now it seems that the
issues have become far more in
volved and important. But does
such a history deserve Mr. Mor
ley's epithet "racist"?
In his all-encompassing state
ment Mr. Morley completely dis
misses these central issues in
the conflict, with an appeal to
unjustified and completely un
called-for smear tactics!
What I wish to address myself
to is just that smear. It seems
that many people are allowing
themselves the luxury of adding
flowery, parenthetical phrases to
their arguments in the hope that
such smears will support the
rest of their shaky position. It
has gotten to the point that no

discussion of any topic is com
plete without such empty words.
The phrases "low and order,"
"anarchists and nihilists," "im
perialism," and "white racism"
are choking communication to
the point that one cannot under
stand what anyone is saying.
How can anyone unite or get to
gether when all that one is asked
to unite under is a bag of cliches,
which mean little or nothing?
Lastly, to link the students in
the Stanford group with any oth
er union is absurd, since each
local has its own separate prob
lems. And to attempt to defame
the Stanford group by associat
ing them with another group
which has been foully and
wrongfully smeared is the very
height of irresponsibility!!

• TA Demand Unwise
Editor, The Daily:
Without commenting on the
other demands of the Political
Science TA's (the Daily, 17 Oc
tober), I wish to point out that
the demand of payment of $300
for each dependent of a TA is
extremely unwise. If Stanford
were to pay TA's some fixed
salary and in addition pay $300
for each dependent, the Univer
sity would in effect be reward
ing those TA's foolish enough to
have children that they could
not afford.
The folly of indiscriminate re
production is being realized by
an increasing number of in
formed people, due in part to the
presence of such excellent books
as Dr. Paul Ehrlich's The Pop
ulation Bomb (95c in paper
back). One has only to compare
the Peninsula of five years ago
with the Peninsula today to note
increased smog and traffic con
gestion and a decline in open
space and in park area per per
son.
Since the TA's seem content to
live under the archaic paternal
istic university system, they
should act responsibly and de
mand that Stanford SUBTRACT
$300 for each dependent ( exclud
ing a spouse, which seems rea
sonable). The University should
not be put in the position of
making the population bomb tick
faster.

• Park-in Rejected
Editor, The Daily:
While I support the Grape
Boycott, I find the recent "park
in" unacceptable. To legislate
morality or the "recognition of
social responsibility" is difficult
enough. Nonlegislative coercion
of morality or recognition of so
cial responsibility can easily be
going too far.
Whatever the decision or jus
tification, such action becomes
the will of a minority impressed
upon the general public. If a
student objects to grape sales
and feels therefore he has the
right and obligation to physic
ally obstruct their sale, then the
Blue Max could find it within his
right and responsibility to phy
sically obstruct "communist"
book sales at Kepler's.
So many people have cooper
ated voluntarily with the Grape
Boycott. Why lose support from
those people who believe in free
dom of choice, choice to estab
lish a union and choice to buy
grapes, by making "Safeway

recognize their social responsi
bility"?

History
• Grape Myths
Editor, The Dally:
I wonder how many Stanford
students bothered to inform
themselves of the facts before
they voted to support the United
Farm Workers in the so-called
grape dispute. My husband and
I spent half the summer in De
lano to learn firsthand what is
happening. Here are the facts:
1. The grape worker portray
ed as a struggling, poor, and ex
ploited group is a myth. The
workers who are presently in
the fields have been harvesting
the crops formany years. Many
of the families live in and
around Delano, and for some of
them picking grapes is a sec
ond job within the family. For
the past two years these work
ers have endured insults, threats,
and general harrassment from
outsiders — demonstrators who
have never been in the fields.
2. Field workers have declared
they want no part of Chavez or
his union, so students who vote
to support the United Farm
Workers are not supporting
grape pickers at all.
3. The union wants "to get"
$1.65 for the workers. Grape
pickers are already receiving an
hourly wage of $1.50 plus a 25
cent bonus per box (three boxes
per hour minimum). I missed
out on the "new math," but that
adds up to a $2.25 minimum in
my book.
4. The farmer hires through a
crew boss, and the workers make
their demands of the farmer
through that same crew boss.
When the crop is ripe on the
vine, the crew has all the bar
gaining power in the world.
5. If the students are well
meaning, then certainly they are
misinformed, or are they merely
expousing a Cause — real or
myth — for the sake of "getting
involved." They are supporting
a boycott which has been de
clared illegal. If the boycott is
successful and grape growers
are forced to turn to mechanized
crops, what will become of the
workers? Whom will the union
attempt to organize then?

Editor, THE DAILY
Certainly your stand on the
UC faculty's right to and re
sponsibility in decisions of ap

not be disputed. But one must
take issue with the last sentence
of your Tuesday editorial. Your
redoubtable passion for academ

sulted in that same blindness
that you state cripples the Gov

Whatever may be your view
of the Director of the Hoover

show a blind and incredibly

ing the Institution in toto by as
serting that it is "already a

caught by his question as quot
ed by your reporter: "Would the

cuted the nine of us in Germany

This question it seems to me
is selfdefeating since no Jews
occupied responsible positions in
Hitler's Germany during World

that Father Berrigan weakens

• Errors On May field
Editor, THE DAILY
In the article "Mayfield Resur

tural deficiencies were incorrect
ly reported:
1. Poor heating system—four
new 4,000 watt fan forced ther
mostatically controlled electrical
heaters were installed on the
third floor of Mayfield House
and the existing heating system
is being thoroughly checked and
repaired.
2. Condemned kitchen—the old
ATO kitchen was not con
demned by the County of Santa
Clara Health Department. The
kitchen was not opened because
of the large renovation cost to
raise the kitchen to a standard
equivalent to other university
residences and because of the
large operating losses incurred
when operating a kitchen serv
ing 40 residents. Instead, a food
service program was initiated
with Roth and Guthrie Houses.
3. Faulty wiring—all wiring,
fixtures and appliances are in
stalled in accordance with the

4. Wooden fire escape — the

• Olympic Protest
Editor, The Dally:
I wish to reply to the support
you gave Tommy Smith and
John Carlos in the recent pro
test during the Olympic award
ceremonies. It is difficult to de
termine from the article "Track
Power" whether you justify the
protest on grounds that Hitler
oriented the Games correctly,
that they should be used for po
litical demonstration, or that
such use, although deplorable,
exists in some forms, and that,
therefore, the Olympic Commit
tees should allow it in any form.
The former attitude would, I
believe, be the demise of the
Olympic Games — the athletic
competition would dissolve amid
the acidity of the countless num
ber of bitter political struggles
which continually seethe; such
an attitude would condone Czech
demonstrations against the So
viets, Biaffran against Federalist
Nigeria, Pakistani against India,
Arab against Jew. The Olympic
Games in such an atmosphere
would no longer exist as an
athletic competition.
True, that underlying the
Games is a quite discernable
current of political rivalry, but
to support a perpetration of
wrong simply on the grounds of
its existence has no rational
basis whatsoever and would con
demn any human institution re
gardless of the amount of posi
tive good it was accomplishing.
The simple fact that one
agrees with the cause being
furthered has no bearing on the
legitimacy of its expression, and
support of Tommy Smith and
John Carlos would also affirm
the right to raise a white glove
and demonstrate hideously for
an all-white America. I despise
the latter and because of it, do
not wish to see the former; I
think the Olympic Games are
worth saving from the political
beast which constantly tries to
devour them.

In a recent Dally Miss Marta

I think it is appropriate for
me to clarify what our practice
is in this regard. In Memorial

official registration materials are
distributed to new students and
continuing students. Official stu
dent organizations and depart

mitted to insert materials in a

The Student Financial Man
ager is in general charge of
seeing to it that only official or

and Alpha Phi Omega coordi
nates putting the packets togeth

ed six to eight years ago, sup
erseding an earlier situation in
which from fifteen to thirty
representatives or organizations
would be handing out things
separately.
This arrangement was orgin

this practice reviewed with rep

• KZSU Policy
Editor, The Dally:
In reference to a recent front
page article, "Cleaver's Speech
Sparks New KZSU Liberaliza
tion," there are several mis-lead
ing statements which, I believe,
require immediate clarification.
1) The "new" policy can hard
ly be termed a liberalization over
KZSU's past policy. Since 1964,
KZSU has permitted and en
couraged the broadcasting of all
shades of opinion, from George
Lincoln Rockwell's speech on
Negro inferiority to last spring's
series on Racism in America.
2) Having authored this
"new" policy, J. can assure you
that the statement "any pro
gram, regardless of content, will
be permitted on the air" is quite
false. There are a number of
restrictions on profanity, libel,
slander, and most importantly,
on requiring responsible spokes
men.
KZSU will censor no one for
his views, but neither will the
station become the mouthpiece
of every student, faculty or staff
member who wants to hear his
own voice. KZSU's "new" policy
is an improvement, if for no
other reason than the fact that
it puts in writing what has been
verbally "accepted" for years.
The station will have complete
copies of this policy available
soon for those interested. I
would hope that before anyone
"demands" a show on KZSU,
they take the time to read the
requirements they must meet.

• Health History
Editor, THE DAILY:
As the architect of the Stan

ford Student Health Service, I
am interested in the comments
in the box in the Daily. It might
help to "look at the record." It
might also help to correct some
mis-apprehensions which are in
the mind of the writer of the
editorial.
In 1946 when the health ser
vice was started, Stanford was
faced with a crisis. The health
service—one man only — was
swamped. The return of the sol
diers skyrocketed enrollments.
The shortage of doctors was
acute. Up to this time a sick
student found a doctor —if he
could—got treatment —good or
bad (the student could not judge
which) and paid whatever this
doctor chose to charge.
Stanford approached me in
some desperation to see if the
Palo Alto Clinic could help. We
worked out the details of the
health service—simply that the
University would pay the Clinic
a capitation fee (i.e. so much
per head) and the Clinic would
maintain an infirmary and give
the students complete compre
hensive care. The University
undertook to self insure for the
hospital bills.
I can say positively that for
twenty-two years the students
of Stanford have had superb
care under this arrangement.
There has been a doctor or doc
tors available every hour, day
and night, Sundays and holi
days, school days and vacations.
And during this whole period
there have been no medical ca
tastrophes except the regretta
ble, inevitable, and unprevent
able suicides. There has been no
instance of serious neglect or
lack of skill. The price the Uni
versity has paid by all insurance
standards has been ridiculously
low — particularly when there
are no deductibles, no co-insur
ance, and no reservations except
pregnancy and long time psy
chosis.
During this period the cost to
the Clinic of the services ren
dered has exceeded the amount
paid by an average of $44,621 a
year or a total for the twenty
one years ending in 1967 of
$936,441. Almost a million dol
lars in supplies and services
have been contributed by the
Clinic to the Stanford Student
Body. This fact is not mentioned.
The proposal that the medical
school take over the health ser
vice is not original with you. It
has been discussed and exam
ined in great detail. The answer
is simply that with their present
personnel whose time is com
pletely taken up with teaching
and research they cannot do it.
It is possible that the health
service might be staffed with
medical students and interns.
I do not believe the Stanford
students who have had free ac
cess to all the mature specialists
in one of the greatest medical
clinics in the country would like
this. If the medical school takes
on this task, they would have
to hire doctors hopefully of the
competence of the clinic doctors
to do the work.
The faculty can't do it in their
spare time. And the situation of

shortage of doctors is such that
they simply cannot get such
men. The privilege of Clinic as
sociation which is highly valued
makes it possible for the health
service to be staffed by highly
skilled men. And, of course, all
the one hundred thirty doctors
in the Clinic are available to
students who need them.
Apparently the writer of the
editorial does not understand
that the Clinic does not profit
when more students are referred
to it. The idea of stationing a
fulltime orthopedist at Cowell is
silly. No orthopedist of sufficient
competence to be worthy to care
for the students would accept
such an assignment.
In summary — the Stanford
students have had superb care
for twenty-one years under the
present arrangement. The price
is very low as attested by the
million dollar deficit the Clinic
has incurred in the twenty years
it has been involved. No alterna
tive arrangement would make
available such competence at
such a price. The withdrawal of
the University from furnishing
hospital care has nothing to do
with the Clinic agreement but
is a matter between the students
and the school.
As a matter of fact it was
found that many of the students
were already covered (as are al
most seventy-five percent of all
people) by private insurance for
hospitalization and the Univer
sity's coverage just gave double
coverage and helped the insur
ance companies.
A great single group coverage
for all students deserves some
consideration. In closing it
would be in the interests of good
journalism if the editor had con
sulted with people who know
the facts and the background.

• Scott On Gaieties
Editor, The Daily:
Johnie Scotts' column, like any
other great piece of propoganda,
has, on a quick reading, at least
one each of: grains of truth, un
truths, half-truths, and distor
tions.
1. Grain of truth: We are not
producing the show.
2. Untruth: "Among the state
ments floating around the room
— 'Why, this play is racist and
immoral,' 'Uh, uh, you know we
can't have a play with more
blacks than whites in it!' " Those
statements were uttered at a
meeting with erstwhile director
Bob Fletcher early in August,
with clear sarcasm, by a design
er. It was Fletcher, Johnie's
White Sidekick, who reported
the remarks, removed the sar
casm, and placed them at the
September 23 meeting, where
the subject was never mentioned
by anybody.
3. Untruth: "... the deci
sion by the Board not to do the
script." At the September 23
meeting, Bob Fletcher proposed
a set of physically impossible
requirements for doing the show,
proceeded to admit that they
were impossible, and went on to

say that he would not do the
show anyway.
4. Distortion: "Black art . . .
cannot enter the System normal
ly ... " Black art probably
could have entered "the Sys
tem" normally. Unfortunately, as
Johnie admitted to me when I
discussed the play with him in
August, his play "sounded as if
it had been written by a white
middle-class liberal college stu
dent."
5. Half-truth: The "censors"
did indeed keep Johnie from us
ing any profanity. Unfortunate
ly, the, censor was, as Johnie also
told me in August, Bob Fletcher,
who never was or will be a
Ram's Head Board Member.

• Sex Course Dropped
Editor, The Daily:
Last spring quarter Dr. B.
Otis Cobb of the Health Educa
tion Department taught his last
course at Stanford. The course
was "Marriage and the Family."
Now it seems that Stanford
is "streamlining" *its curricu
lum and that the course will dis
appear from Stanford after this
year, along with the phasing out
of the rest of the Health Educa
tion Department.
Dr. Cobb was a controversial
teacher. Many students thought
he delighted in flaunting "ob
scene" four-letter words. Some
students have called him a "dirty
old man" and a "pervert." But
he was not.
He was an interesting teacher
who made students think about
the quirks of sexual taboos in
our culture and who broadened
our viewpoints.
"Marriage and the Family,"
too, has been much maligned.
Just mention to your friends
that you're taking "Marriage
and the Family" and watch
their reactions, such as "Oh,
taking a mick" or "Looking for
3 easy units of A, huh?"
The Administration shares
this lack of regard for the course
as evidenced by its planning to
drop the course as well as the
department that offers it.
"Marriage and the Family,"
however, is a worthwhile course,
and most students would admit
they got something besides a
grade out of it. Students ask for
courses that are relevant to
relevant to them, and "Marriage
and the Family" is one of the
most relevant courses at Stan
ford.
The course awakes students
to the realities of an interper
sonal relationship such as mar
riage and discusses the family,
perhaps the most important
group in our tradition-lacking
and restless society. Probably no
other course approximates this
coverage.
But the University feels it
must move "forward," leaving

such a course behind. Perhaps
Stanford should ask itself "Quo
vadis?"

In light of the heated cam
paign that we have witnessed
during the past months, and of
one of the major campaign is
sues that have been thrown
around, I thought the following
would be of interest:
"The streets of our coun

rebelling and rioting. Commu

ening us with her might, and

"Yes, without law and or

We are laughed at by other

TIMOTHY GILL
• In Re Morley
Editor, The Daily:
Let me begin by saying that
I find it quite difficult to answer
Mr. Morley's letter to you of Oc
tober 24, for it is difficult to
decide what his position is.
There are, however, several
points which I can answer. The
first concerns just how many
that I, as Shop Steward in the
English Department, represent.
Presently, thirty-three Teaching
Assistants and three Acting In
structors (who also teach Fresh
man English at only a slightly
higher salary than the Teaching
Assistants do) are members of
the AFT Union.
In addition, four Teaching As
sistants have written letters to
Provost Lyman supporting us
In this matter of higher salaries.
As a result, we can say that I
represent forty (out of a pos

sible fifty-three) members of the
English Department staff in this
issue.
Secondly, I am glad that Mr.
Morley used the phrase "crea
ture comforts," for this is ex
actly what we are asking for:
enough money to live on in the
Bay Area. At present, we earn
$2,300 minus taxes ($200). We
are not asking for an exorbitant
amount of money (or to be able
to live in "style"), only enough
to raise our incomes to some
thing very slightly above the
poverty level.
As it stands now, we have to
borrow money for dental care,
for hospitalization insurance, for
car upkeep (and everyone would
agree that a car is a necessity
in this area), occasionally even
for food.
Also, I might point out that
we are people with the equiva
lents of M.A. degrees who per
form a valuable service for the
University, not only in terms of
leading class meetings but also
in the time we spend outside of
class with each student (in some
cases, this is more valuable than
contact in the classroom).
We are asking for a more
reasonable compensation for the
service we perform, and the Ad
ministration has acknowledged
that we deserve more. The ques
tion is where the money will
come from, and the present ne
gotiations are an attempt to de
cide not only where the money
will come from and if it avail

able, but also what priorities the
Administration uses when it dis
tributes money.
Thirdly, as to the political af
filiates of our Union. Mr. Mor
ley raised two points. As to the
first, our inherent support of
the A.F.T. in New York, I know
of no Union member who sup
ports their action; and our con
vention delegate is at present
working with the New Caucus
(a coalition of "radicals" and
blacks), which is going so far as
to counter-picket and to teach
freedom schools while the regu
lar schools are closed.
As to the second point, the
National A.F.T.'s support of
Humphrey, our local's dues are
not used as contributions to his
campaign (a separate founda
tion, COPE, which asks that
each local join it, makes the con
tributions). I would also ask Mr.
Morley who he would have the
National support. Nixon or Wal
lace?
Finally, let me say that we
will be glad to inform the Ad
ministration that Mr. Morley
does not wish to be considered
for a pay raise and is perhaps
even willing to take a cut in
salary.

• Racism In Union?
Editor, The Daily:
I take exception to Mr. Ed
ward F. Morley's off-the-cuff

attack of the members of New
York City's United Federation
of Teachers as members of a
"white racist union which has
been denying thousands of black
children a meaningful educa
tion in New York City."
I do not wish to enter into an
exhaustive analysis of that sad
dispute at this time, but I would
suggest that a further investi
gation of the facts would shed
more light on the subject. There
are many more things at stake
right now in New York City
than the school system.
President Shanker of the UFT
has accused Mayor Lindsay of
attempting to destroy the union.
The financial support of the
secessionist Ocean Hill-Browns
ville district is coming from
sources whose motives are ques
tionable. The future of labor
unions might very well be at
stake in New York City.
Can all unions remain strong
after one is destroyed? And to
call a union "racist" because it
is fighting for its very existence,
when that fight is not directed
against any minority, is com
pletely ridiculous.
Furthermore, if any act was
"racist" it was that of the school
district's governing board in
summarily dismissing instruc
tors (when they had no such
power) not on the basis of com
petence but merely because they
were white. This, and only this,
was the original cause of the
strike. Now it seems that the
issues have become far more in
volved and important. But does
such a history deserve Mr. Mor
ley's epithet "racist"?
In his all-encompassing state
ment Mr. Morley completely dis
misses these central issues in
the conflict, with an appeal to
unjustified and completely un
called-for smear tactics!
What I wish to address myself
to is just that smear. It seems
that many people are allowing
themselves the luxury of adding
flowery, parenthetical phrases to
their arguments in the hope that
such smears will support the
rest of their shaky position. It
has gotten to the point that no

discussion of any topic is com
plete without such empty words.
The phrases "low and order,"
"anarchists and nihilists," "im
perialism," and "white racism"
are choking communication to
the point that one cannot under
stand what anyone is saying.
How can anyone unite or get to
gether when all that one is asked
to unite under is a bag of cliches,
which mean little or nothing?
Lastly, to link the students in
the Stanford group with any oth
er union is absurd, since each
local has its own separate prob
lems. And to attempt to defame
the Stanford group by associat
ing them with another group
which has been foully and
wrongfully smeared is the very
height of irresponsibility!!

• TA Demand Unwise
Editor, The Daily:
Without commenting on the
other demands of the Political
Science TA's (the Daily, 17 Oc
tober), I wish to point out that
the demand of payment of $300
for each dependent of a TA is
extremely unwise. If Stanford
were to pay TA's some fixed
salary and in addition pay $300
for each dependent, the Univer
sity would in effect be reward
ing those TA's foolish enough to
have children that they could
not afford.
The folly of indiscriminate re
production is being realized by
an increasing number of in
formed people, due in part to the
presence of such excellent books
as Dr. Paul Ehrlich's The Pop
ulation Bomb (95c in paper
back). One has only to compare
the Peninsula of five years ago
with the Peninsula today to note
increased smog and traffic con
gestion and a decline in open
space and in park area per per
son.
Since the TA's seem content to
live under the archaic paternal
istic university system, they
should act responsibly and de
mand that Stanford SUBTRACT
$300 for each dependent ( exclud
ing a spouse, which seems rea
sonable). The University should
not be put in the position of
making the population bomb tick
faster.

• Park-in Rejected
Editor, The Daily:
While I support the Grape
Boycott, I find the recent "park
in" unacceptable. To legislate
morality or the "recognition of
social responsibility" is difficult
enough. Nonlegislative coercion
of morality or recognition of so
cial responsibility can easily be
going too far.
Whatever the decision or jus
tification, such action becomes
the will of a minority impressed
upon the general public. If a
student objects to grape sales
and feels therefore he has the
right and obligation to physic
ally obstruct their sale, then the
Blue Max could find it within his
right and responsibility to phy
sically obstruct "communist"
book sales at Kepler's.
So many people have cooper
ated voluntarily with the Grape
Boycott. Why lose support from
those people who believe in free
dom of choice, choice to estab
lish a union and choice to buy
grapes, by making "Safeway

recognize their social responsi
bility"?
MARK Zl. EDWARDS, Jr.
History
• Grape Myths
Editor, The Dally:
I wonder how many Stanford
students bothered to inform
themselves of the facts before
they voted to support the United
Farm Workers in the so-called
grape dispute. My husband and
I spent half the summer in De
lano to learn firsthand what is
happening. Here are the facts:
1. The grape worker portray
ed as a struggling, poor, and ex
ploited group is a myth. The
workers who are presently in
the fields have been harvesting
the crops formany years. Many
of the families live in and
around Delano, and for some of
them picking grapes is a sec
ond job within the family. For
the past two years these work
ers have endured insults, threats,
and general harrassment from
outsiders — demonstrators who
have never been in the fields.
2. Field workers have declared
they want no part of Chavez or
his union, so students who vote
to support the United Farm
Workers are not supporting
grape pickers at all.
3. The union wants "to get"
$1.65 for the workers. Grape
pickers are already receiving an
hourly wage of $1.50 plus a 25
cent bonus per box (three boxes
per hour minimum). I missed
out on the "new math," but that
adds up to a $2.25 minimum in
my book.
4. The farmer hires through a
crew boss, and the workers make
their demands of the farmer
through that same crew boss.
When the crop is ripe on the
vine, the crew has all the bar
gaining power in the world.
5. If the students are well
meaning, then certainly they are
misinformed, or are they merely
expousing a Cause — real or
myth — for the sake of "getting
involved." They are supporting
a boycott which has been de
clared illegal. If the boycott is
successful and grape growers
are forced to turn to mechanized
crops, what will become of the
workers? Whom will the union
attempt to organize then?

Certainly your stand on the

sponsibility in decisions of ap

not be disputed. But one must
take issue with the last sentence
of your Tuesday editorial. Your
redoubtable passion for academ

sulted in that same blindness
that you state cripples the Gov

Whatever may be your view
of the Director of the Hoover

show a blind and incredibly

ing the Institution in toto by as
serting that it is "already a

ed by your reporter: "Would the

cuted the nine of us in Germany

This question it seems to me
is selfdefeating since no Jews
occupied responsible positions in
Hitler's Germany during World

that Father Berrigan weakens

• Errors On May field
Editor, THE DAILY
In the article "Mayfield Resur

tural deficiencies were incorrect
ly reported:
1. Poor heating system—four
new 4,000 watt fan forced ther
mostatically controlled electrical
heaters were installed on the
third floor of Mayfield House
and the existing heating system
is being thoroughly checked and
repaired.
2. Condemned kitchen—the old
ATO kitchen was not con
demned by the County of Santa
Clara Health Department. The
kitchen was not opened because
of the large renovation cost to
raise the kitchen to a standard
equivalent to other university
residences and because of the
large operating losses incurred
when operating a kitchen serv
ing 40 residents. Instead, a food
service program was initiated
with Roth and Guthrie Houses.
3. Faulty wiring—all wiring,
fixtures and appliances are in
stalled in accordance with the
State of California Electrical
Safety Orders and certified to

4. Wooden fire escape — the

• Olympic Protest
Editor, The Dally:
I wish to reply to the support
you gave Tommy Smith and
John Carlos in the recent pro
test during the Olympic award
ceremonies. It is difficult to de
termine from the article "Track
Power" whether you justify the
protest on grounds that Hitler
oriented the Games correctly,
that they should be used for po
litical demonstration, or that
such use, although deplorable,
exists in some forms, and that,
therefore, the Olympic Commit
tees should allow it in any form.
The former attitude would, I
believe, be the demise of the
Olympic Games — the athletic
competition would dissolve amid
the acidity of the countless num
ber of bitter political struggles
which continually seethe; such
an attitude would condone Czech
demonstrations against the So
viets, Biaffran against Federalist
Nigeria, Pakistani against India,
Arab against Jew. The Olympic
Games in such an atmosphere
would no longer exist as an
athletic competition.
True, that underlying the
Games is a quite discernable
current of political rivalry, but
to support a perpetration of
wrong simply on the grounds of
its existence has no rational
basis whatsoever and would con
demn any human institution re
gardless of the amount of posi
tive good it was accomplishing.
The simple fact that one
agrees with the cause being
furthered has no bearing on the
legitimacy of its expression, and
support of Tommy Smith and
John Carlos would also affirm
the right to raise a white glove
and demonstrate hideously for
an all-white America. I despise
the latter and because of it, do
not wish to see the former; I
think the Olympic Games are
worth saving from the political
beast which constantly tries to
devour them.

I think it is appropriate for

• KZSU Policy
Editor, The Dally:
In reference to a recent front
page article, "Cleaver's Speech
Sparks New KZSU Liberaliza
tion," there are several mis-lead
ing statements which, I believe,
require immediate clarification.
1) The "new" policy can hard
ly be termed a liberalization over
KZSU's past policy. Since 1964,
KZSU has permitted and en
couraged the broadcasting of all
shades of opinion, from George
Lincoln Rockwell's speech on
Negro inferiority to last spring's
series on Racism in America.
2) Having authored this
"new" policy, J. can assure you
that the statement "any pro
gram, regardless of content, will
be permitted on the air" is quite
false. There are a number of
restrictions on profanity, libel,
slander, and most importantly,
on requiring responsible spokes
men.
KZSU will censor no one for
his views, but neither will the
station become the mouthpiece
of every student, faculty or staff
member who wants to hear his
own voice. KZSU's "new" policy
is an improvement, if for no
other reason than the fact that
it puts in writing what has been
verbally "accepted" for years.
The station will have complete
copies of this policy available
soon for those interested. I
would hope that before anyone
"demands" a show on KZSU,
they take the time to read the
requirements they must meet.

KZSU Prog. Director
• Health History
Editor, THE DAILY:
As the architect of the Stan

ford Student Health Service, I
am interested in the comments
in the box in the Daily. It might
help to "look at the record." It
might also help to correct some
mis-apprehensions which are in
the mind of the writer of the
editorial.
In 1946 when the health ser
vice was started, Stanford was
faced with a crisis. The health
service—one man only — was
swamped. The return of the sol
diers skyrocketed enrollments.
The shortage of doctors was
acute. Up to this time a sick
student found a doctor —if he
could—got treatment —good or
bad (the student could not judge
which) and paid whatever this
doctor chose to charge.
Stanford approached me in
some desperation to see if the
Palo Alto Clinic could help. We
worked out the details of the
health service—simply that the
University would pay the Clinic
a capitation fee (i.e. so much
per head) and the Clinic would
maintain an infirmary and give
the students complete compre
hensive care. The University
undertook to self insure for the
hospital bills.
I can say positively that for
twenty-two years the students
of Stanford have had superb
care under this arrangement.
There has been a doctor or doc
tors available every hour, day
and night, Sundays and holi
days, school days and vacations.
And during this whole period
there have been no medical ca
tastrophes except the regretta
ble, inevitable, and unprevent
able suicides. There has been no
instance of serious neglect or
lack of skill. The price the Uni
versity has paid by all insurance
standards has been ridiculously
low — particularly when there
are no deductibles, no co-insur
ance, and no reservations except
pregnancy and long time psy
chosis.
During this period the cost to
the Clinic of the services ren
dered has exceeded the amount
paid by an average of $44,621 a
year or a total for the twenty
one years ending in 1967 of
$936,441. Almost a million dol
lars in supplies and services
have been contributed by the
Clinic to the Stanford Student
Body. This fact is not mentioned.
The proposal that the medical
school take over the health ser
vice is not original with you. It
has been discussed and exam
ined in great detail. The answer
is simply that with their present
personnel whose time is com
pletely taken up with teaching
and research they cannot do it.
It is possible that the health
service might be staffed with
medical students and interns.
I do not believe the Stanford
students who have had free ac
cess to all the mature specialists
in one of the greatest medical
clinics in the country would like
this. If the medical school takes
on this task, they would have
to hire doctors hopefully of the
competence of the clinic doctors
to do the work.
The faculty can't do it in their
spare time. And the situation of

shortage of doctors is such that
they simply cannot get such
men. The privilege of Clinic as
sociation which is highly valued
makes it possible for the health
service to be staffed by highly
skilled men. And, of course, all
the one hundred thirty doctors
in the Clinic are available to
students who need them.
Apparently the writer of the
editorial does not understand
that the Clinic does not profit
when more students are referred
to it. The idea of stationing a
fulltime orthopedist at Cowell is
silly. No orthopedist of sufficient
competence to be worthy to care
for the students would accept
such an assignment.
In summary — the Stanford
students have had superb care
for twenty-one years under the
present arrangement. The price
is very low as attested by the
million dollar deficit the Clinic
has incurred in the twenty years
it has been involved. No alterna
tive arrangement would make
available such competence at
such a price. The withdrawal of
the University from furnishing
hospital care has nothing to do
with the Clinic agreement but
is a matter between the students
and the school.
As a matter of fact it was
found that many of the students
were already covered (as are al
most seventy-five percent of all
people) by private insurance for
hospitalization and the Univer
sity's coverage just gave double
coverage and helped the insur
ance companies.
A great single group coverage
for all students deserves some
consideration. In closing it
would be in the interests of good
journalism if the editor had con
sulted with people who know
the facts and the background.

immoral,' 'Uh, uh, you know we
can't have a play with more
blacks than whites in it!' " Those
statements were uttered at a
meeting with erstwhile director
Bob Fletcher early in August,
with clear sarcasm, by a design

the subject was never mentioned

• Sex Course Dropped
Editor, The Daily:
Last spring quarter Dr. B.
Otis Cobb of the Health Educa
tion Department taught his last
course at Stanford. The course
was "Marriage and the Family."
Now it seems that Stanford
is "streamlining" *its curricu
lum and that the course will dis
appear from Stanford after this
year, along with the phasing out
of the rest of the Health Educa
tion Department.
Dr. Cobb was a controversial
teacher. Many students thought
he delighted in flaunting "ob
scene" four-letter words. Some
students have called him a "dirty
old man" and a "pervert." But
he was not.
He was an interesting teacher
who made students think about
the quirks of sexual taboos in
our culture and who broadened
our viewpoints.
"Marriage and the Family,"
too, has been much maligned.
Just mention to your friends
that you're taking "Marriage
and the Family" and watch
their reactions, such as "Oh,
taking a mick" or "Looking for
3 easy units of A, huh?"
The Administration shares
this lack of regard for the course
as evidenced by its planning to
drop the course as well as the
department that offers it.
"Marriage and the Family,"
however, is a worthwhile course,
and most students would admit
they got something besides a
grade out of it. Students ask for
courses that are relevant to
relevant to them, and "Marriage
and the Family" is one of the
most relevant courses at Stan
ford.
The course awakes students
to the realities of an interper
sonal relationship such as mar
riage and discusses the family,
perhaps the most important
group in our tradition-lacking
and restless society. Probably no
other course approximates this
coverage.
But the University feels it
must move "forward," leaving

such a course behind. Perhaps
Stanford should ask itself "Quo
vadis?"

In light of the heated cam
paign that we have witnessed
during the past months, and of
one of the major campaign is
sues that have been thrown
around, I thought the following
would be of interest:
"The streets of our coun
try are in turmoil. The univer

rebelling and rioting. Commu
nists are seeking to destroy
our country. Russia Is threat
ening us with her might, and
the Republic is in danger.
"Yes, danger from within
and from without. We need

"Yes, without law and or
der, our nation cannot survive.
We are laughed at by other
nations because of the disor
der in our streets caused by
the students and the Commu

• In Re Morley
Editor, The Daily:
Let me begin by saying that
I find it quite difficult to answer
Mr. Morley's letter to you of Oc
tober 24, for it is difficult to
decide what his position is.
There are, however, several
points which I can answer. The
first concerns just how many
that I, as Shop Steward in the
English Department, represent.
Presently, thirty-three Teaching
Assistants and three Acting In
structors (who also teach Fresh
man English at only a slightly
higher salary than the Teaching
Assistants do) are members of
the AFT Union.
In addition, four Teaching As
sistants have written letters to
Provost Lyman supporting us
In this matter of higher salaries.
As a result, we can say that I
represent forty (out of a pos

sible fifty-three) members of the
English Department staff in this
issue.
Secondly, I am glad that Mr.
Morley used the phrase "crea
ture comforts," for this is ex
actly what we are asking for:
enough money to live on in the
Bay Area. At present, we earn
$2,300 minus taxes ($200). We
are not asking for an exorbitant
amount of money (or to be able
to live in "style"), only enough
to raise our incomes to some
thing very slightly above the
poverty level.
As it stands now, we have to
borrow money for dental care,
for hospitalization insurance, for
car upkeep (and everyone would
agree that a car is a necessity
in this area), occasionally even
for food.
Also, I might point out that
we are people with the equiva
lents of M.A. degrees who per
form a valuable service for the
University, not only in terms of
leading class meetings but also
in the time we spend outside of
class with each student (in some
cases, this is more valuable than
contact in the classroom).
We are asking for a more
reasonable compensation for the
service we perform, and the Ad
ministration has acknowledged
that we deserve more. The ques
tion is where the money will
come from, and the present ne
gotiations are an attempt to de
cide not only where the money
will come from and if it avail

able, but also what priorities the
Administration uses when it dis
tributes money.
Thirdly, as to the political af
filiates of our Union. Mr. Mor
ley raised two points. As to the
first, our inherent support of
the A.F.T. in New York, I know
of no Union member who sup
ports their action; and our con
vention delegate is at present
working with the New Caucus
(a coalition of "radicals" and
blacks), which is going so far as
to counter-picket and to teach
freedom schools while the regu
lar schools are closed.
As to the second point, the
National A.F.T.'s support of
Humphrey, our local's dues are
not used as contributions to his
campaign (a separate founda
tion, COPE, which asks that
each local join it, makes the con
tributions). I would also ask Mr.
Morley who he would have the
National support. Nixon or Wal
lace?
Finally, let me say that we
will be glad to inform the Ad
ministration that Mr. Morley
does not wish to be considered
for a pay raise and is perhaps
even willing to take a cut in
salary.

• Racism In Union?
Editor, The Daily:
I take exception to Mr. Ed
ward F. Morley's off-the-cuff

attack of the members of New
York City's United Federation
of Teachers as members of a
"white racist union which has
been denying thousands of black
children a meaningful educa
tion in New York City."
I do not wish to enter into an
exhaustive analysis of that sad
dispute at this time, but I would
suggest that a further investi
gation of the facts would shed
more light on the subject. There
are many more things at stake
right now in New York City
than the school system.
President Shanker of the UFT
has accused Mayor Lindsay of
attempting to destroy the union.
The financial support of the
secessionist Ocean Hill-Browns
ville district is coming from
sources whose motives are ques
tionable. The future of labor
unions might very well be at
stake in New York City.
Can all unions remain strong
after one is destroyed? And to
call a union "racist" because it
is fighting for its very existence,
when that fight is not directed
against any minority, is com
pletely ridiculous.
Furthermore, if any act was
"racist" it was that of the school
district's governing board in
summarily dismissing instruc
tors (when they had no such
power) not on the basis of com
petence but merely because they
were white. This, and only this,
was the original cause of the
strike. Now it seems that the
issues have become far more in
volved and important. But does
such a history deserve Mr. Mor
ley's epithet "racist"?
In his all-encompassing state
ment Mr. Morley completely dis
misses these central issues in
the conflict, with an appeal to
unjustified and completely un
called-for smear tactics!
What I wish to address myself
to is just that smear. It seems
that many people are allowing
themselves the luxury of adding
flowery, parenthetical phrases to
their arguments in the hope that
such smears will support the
rest of their shaky position. It
has gotten to the point that no

discussion of any topic is com
plete without such empty words.
The phrases "low and order,"
"anarchists and nihilists," "im
perialism," and "white racism"
are choking communication to
the point that one cannot under
stand what anyone is saying.
How can anyone unite or get to
gether when all that one is asked
to unite under is a bag of cliches,
which mean little or nothing?
Lastly, to link the students in
the Stanford group with any oth
er union is absurd, since each
local has its own separate prob
lems. And to attempt to defame
the Stanford group by associat
ing them with another group
which has been foully and
wrongfully smeared is the very
height of irresponsibility!!

• TA Demand Unwise
Editor, The Daily:
Without commenting on the
other demands of the Political
Science TA's (the Daily, 17 Oc
tober), I wish to point out that
the demand of payment of $300
for each dependent of a TA is
extremely unwise. If Stanford
were to pay TA's some fixed
salary and in addition pay $300
for each dependent, the Univer
sity would in effect be reward
ing those TA's foolish enough to
have children that they could
not afford.
The folly of indiscriminate re
production is being realized by
an increasing number of in
formed people, due in part to the
presence of such excellent books
as Dr. Paul Ehrlich's The Pop
ulation Bomb (95c in paper
back). One has only to compare
the Peninsula of five years ago
with the Peninsula today to note
increased smog and traffic con
gestion and a decline in open
space and in park area per per
son.
Since the TA's seem content to
live under the archaic paternal
istic university system, they
should act responsibly and de
mand that Stanford SUBTRACT
$300 for each dependent ( exclud
ing a spouse, which seems rea
sonable). The University should
not be put in the position of
making the population bomb tick
faster.

• Park-in Rejected
Editor, The Daily:
While I support the Grape
Boycott, I find the recent "park
in" unacceptable. To legislate
morality or the "recognition of
social responsibility" is difficult
enough. Nonlegislative coercion
of morality or recognition of so
cial responsibility can easily be
going too far.
Whatever the decision or jus
tification, such action becomes
the will of a minority impressed
upon the general public. If a
student objects to grape sales
and feels therefore he has the
right and obligation to physic
ally obstruct their sale, then the
Blue Max could find it within his
right and responsibility to phy
sically obstruct "communist"
book sales at Kepler's.
So many people have cooper
ated voluntarily with the Grape
Boycott. Why lose support from
those people who believe in free
dom of choice, choice to estab
lish a union and choice to buy
grapes, by making "Safeway

recognize their social responsi
bility"?
MARK Zl. EDWARDS, Jr.
History
• Grape Myths
Editor, The Dally:
I wonder how many Stanford
students bothered to inform
themselves of the facts before
they voted to support the United
Farm Workers in the so-called
grape dispute. My husband and
I spent half the summer in De
lano to learn firsthand what is
happening. Here are the facts:
1. The grape worker portray
ed as a struggling, poor, and ex
ploited group is a myth. The
workers who are presently in
the fields have been harvesting
the crops formany years. Many
of the families live in and
around Delano, and for some of
them picking grapes is a sec
ond job within the family. For
the past two years these work
ers have endured insults, threats,
and general harrassment from
outsiders — demonstrators who
have never been in the fields.
2. Field workers have declared
they want no part of Chavez or
his union, so students who vote
to support the United Farm
Workers are not supporting
grape pickers at all.
3. The union wants "to get"
$1.65 for the workers. Grape
pickers are already receiving an
hourly wage of $1.50 plus a 25
cent bonus per box (three boxes
per hour minimum). I missed
out on the "new math," but that
adds up to a $2.25 minimum in
my book.
4. The farmer hires through a
crew boss, and the workers make
their demands of the farmer
through that same crew boss.
When the crop is ripe on the
vine, the crew has all the bar
gaining power in the world.
5. If the students are well
meaning, then certainly they are
misinformed, or are they merely
expousing a Cause — real or
myth — for the sake of "getting
involved." They are supporting
a boycott which has been de
clared illegal. If the boycott is
successful and grape growers
are forced to turn to mechanized
crops, what will become of the
workers? Whom will the union
attempt to organize then?

Editor, THE DAILY
Certainly your stand on the
UC faculty's right to and re
sponsibility in decisions of ap

not be disputed. But one must
take issue with the last sentence
of your Tuesday editorial. Your
redoubtable passion for academ

Whatever may be your view
of the Director of the Hoover

In reading the account of Fa

ed by your reporter: "Would the

cuted the nine of us in Germany

This question it seems to me
is selfdefeating since no Jews
occupied responsible positions in
Hitler's Germany during World

that Father Berrigan weakens

• Errors On May field
Editor, THE DAILY
In the article "Mayfield Resur
rected for Housing" four struc
tural deficiencies were incorrect
ly reported:
1. Poor heating system—four
new 4,000 watt fan forced ther
mostatically controlled electrical
heaters were installed on the
third floor of Mayfield House
and the existing heating system
is being thoroughly checked and
repaired.
2. Condemned kitchen—the old
ATO kitchen was not con
demned by the County of Santa
Clara Health Department. The
kitchen was not opened because
of the large renovation cost to
raise the kitchen to a standard
equivalent to other university
residences and because of the
large operating losses incurred
when operating a kitchen serv
ing 40 residents. Instead, a food
service program was initiated
with Roth and Guthrie Houses.
3. Faulty wiring—all wiring,
fixtures and appliances are in
stalled in accordance with the
State of California Electrical
Safety Orders and certified to
the county of Santa Clara Fire
Marshal's office by a licensed
electrical contractor.
4. Wooden fire escape — the
fire escape was constructed in

• Olympic Protest
Editor, The Dally:
I wish to reply to the support
you gave Tommy Smith and
John Carlos in the recent pro
test during the Olympic award
ceremonies. It is difficult to de
termine from the article "Track
Power" whether you justify the
protest on grounds that Hitler
oriented the Games correctly,
that they should be used for po
litical demonstration, or that
such use, although deplorable,
exists in some forms, and that,
therefore, the Olympic Commit
tees should allow it in any form.
The former attitude would, I
believe, be the demise of the
Olympic Games — the athletic
competition would dissolve amid
the acidity of the countless num
ber of bitter political struggles
which continually seethe; such
an attitude would condone Czech
demonstrations against the So
viets, Biaffran against Federalist
Nigeria, Pakistani against India,
Arab against Jew. The Olympic
Games in such an atmosphere
would no longer exist as an
athletic competition.
True, that underlying the
Games is a quite discernable
current of political rivalry, but
to support a perpetration of
wrong simply on the grounds of
its existence has no rational
basis whatsoever and would con
demn any human institution re
gardless of the amount of posi
tive good it was accomplishing.
The simple fact that one
agrees with the cause being
furthered has no bearing on the
legitimacy of its expression, and
support of Tommy Smith and
John Carlos would also affirm
the right to raise a white glove
and demonstrate hideously for
an all-white America. I despise
the latter and because of it, do
not wish to see the former; I
think the Olympic Games are
worth saving from the political
beast which constantly tries to
devour them.

In a recent Dally Miss Marta

I think it is appropriate for
me to clarify what our practice
is in this regard. In Memorial
Auditorium the official registra
tion materials and nothing but
official registration materials are
distributed to new students and
continuing students. Official stu
dent organizations and depart
ments of the University are per
mitted to insert materials in a
packet which is distributed to
students as they enter Memorial

The Student Financial Man
ager is in general charge of
seeing to it that only official or
ganizations do insert materials,
and Alpha Phi Omega coordi
nates putting the packets togeth
er. This practice was inaugurat
ed six to eight years ago, sup
erseding an earlier situation in
which from fifteen to thirty
representatives or organizations
would be handing out things
separately.
This arrangement was orgin
ally worked out with the then
responsible student representa

this practice reviewed with rep
resentatives of students, faculty,

• KZSU Policy
Editor, The Dally:
In reference to a recent front
page article, "Cleaver's Speech
Sparks New KZSU Liberaliza
tion," there are several mis-lead
ing statements which, I believe,
require immediate clarification.
1) The "new" policy can hard
ly be termed a liberalization over
KZSU's past policy. Since 1964,
KZSU has permitted and en
couraged the broadcasting of all
shades of opinion, from George
Lincoln Rockwell's speech on
Negro inferiority to last spring's
series on Racism in America.
2) Having authored this
"new" policy, J. can assure you
that the statement "any pro
gram, regardless of content, will
be permitted on the air" is quite
false. There are a number of
restrictions on profanity, libel,
slander, and most importantly,
on requiring responsible spokes
men.
KZSU will censor no one for
his views, but neither will the
station become the mouthpiece
of every student, faculty or staff
member who wants to hear his
own voice. KZSU's "new" policy
is an improvement, if for no
other reason than the fact that
it puts in writing what has been
verbally "accepted" for years.
The station will have complete
copies of this policy available
soon for those interested. I
would hope that before anyone
"demands" a show on KZSU,
they take the time to read the
requirements they must meet.

KZSU Prog. Director
• Health History
Editor, THE DAILY:
As the architect of the Stan

ford Student Health Service, I
am interested in the comments
in the box in the Daily. It might
help to "look at the record." It
might also help to correct some
mis-apprehensions which are in
the mind of the writer of the
editorial.
In 1946 when the health ser
vice was started, Stanford was
faced with a crisis. The health
service—one man only — was
swamped. The return of the sol
diers skyrocketed enrollments.
The shortage of doctors was
acute. Up to this time a sick
student found a doctor —if he
could—got treatment —good or
bad (the student could not judge
which) and paid whatever this
doctor chose to charge.
Stanford approached me in
some desperation to see if the
Palo Alto Clinic could help. We
worked out the details of the
health service—simply that the
University would pay the Clinic
a capitation fee (i.e. so much
per head) and the Clinic would
maintain an infirmary and give
the students complete compre
hensive care. The University
undertook to self insure for the
hospital bills.
I can say positively that for
twenty-two years the students
of Stanford have had superb
care under this arrangement.
There has been a doctor or doc
tors available every hour, day
and night, Sundays and holi
days, school days and vacations.
And during this whole period
there have been no medical ca
tastrophes except the regretta
ble, inevitable, and unprevent
able suicides. There has been no
instance of serious neglect or
lack of skill. The price the Uni
versity has paid by all insurance
standards has been ridiculously
low — particularly when there
are no deductibles, no co-insur
ance, and no reservations except
pregnancy and long time psy
chosis.
During this period the cost to
the Clinic of the services ren
dered has exceeded the amount
paid by an average of $44,621 a
year or a total for the twenty
one years ending in 1967 of
$936,441. Almost a million dol
lars in supplies and services
have been contributed by the
Clinic to the Stanford Student
Body. This fact is not mentioned.
The proposal that the medical
school take over the health ser
vice is not original with you. It
has been discussed and exam
ined in great detail. The answer
is simply that with their present
personnel whose time is com
pletely taken up with teaching
and research they cannot do it.
It is possible that the health
service might be staffed with
medical students and interns.
I do not believe the Stanford
students who have had free ac
cess to all the mature specialists
in one of the greatest medical
clinics in the country would like
this. If the medical school takes
on this task, they would have
to hire doctors hopefully of the
competence of the clinic doctors
to do the work.
The faculty can't do it in their
spare time. And the situation of

shortage of doctors is such that
they simply cannot get such
men. The privilege of Clinic as
sociation which is highly valued
makes it possible for the health
service to be staffed by highly
skilled men. And, of course, all
the one hundred thirty doctors
in the Clinic are available to
students who need them.
Apparently the writer of the
editorial does not understand
that the Clinic does not profit
when more students are referred
to it. The idea of stationing a
fulltime orthopedist at Cowell is
silly. No orthopedist of sufficient
competence to be worthy to care
for the students would accept
such an assignment.
In summary — the Stanford
students have had superb care
for twenty-one years under the
present arrangement. The price
is very low as attested by the
million dollar deficit the Clinic
has incurred in the twenty years
it has been involved. No alterna
tive arrangement would make
available such competence at
such a price. The withdrawal of
the University from furnishing
hospital care has nothing to do
with the Clinic agreement but
is a matter between the students
and the school.
As a matter of fact it was
found that many of the students
were already covered (as are al
most seventy-five percent of all
people) by private insurance for
hospitalization and the Univer
sity's coverage just gave double
coverage and helped the insur
ance companies.
A great single group coverage
for all students deserves some
consideration. In closing it
would be in the interests of good
journalism if the editor had con
sulted with people who know
the facts and the background.

• Scott On Gaieties
Editor, The Daily:
Johnie Scotts' column, like any
other great piece of propoganda,
has, on a quick reading, at least
one each of: grains of truth, un
truths, half-truths, and distor
tions.
1. Grain of truth: We are not
producing the show.
2. Untruth: "Among the state
ments floating around the room
— 'Why, this play is racist and
immoral,' 'Uh, uh, you know we
can't have a play with more
blacks than whites in it!' " Those
statements were uttered at a
meeting with erstwhile director
Bob Fletcher early in August,
with clear sarcasm, by a design
er. It was Fletcher, Johnie's
White Sidekick, who reported
the remarks, removed the sar
casm, and placed them at the
September 23 meeting, where
the subject was never mentioned
by anybody.
3. Untruth: "... the deci
sion by the Board not to do the
script." At the September 23
meeting, Bob Fletcher proposed
a set of physically impossible
requirements for doing the show,
proceeded to admit that they
were impossible, and went on to

say that he would not do the

4. Distortion: "Black art . . .

could have entered "the Sys

Johnie admitted to me when I
discussed the play with him in
August, his play "sounded as if
it had been written by a white
middle-class liberal college stu
dent."
5. Half-truth: The "censors"
did indeed keep Johnie from us
ing any profanity. Unfortunate
ly, the, censor was, as Johnie also
told me in August, Bob Fletcher,
who never was or will be a

• Sex Course Dropped
Editor, The Daily:
Last spring quarter Dr. B.
Otis Cobb of the Health Educa
tion Department taught his last
course at Stanford. The course
was "Marriage and the Family."
Now it seems that Stanford
is "streamlining" *its curricu
lum and that the course will dis
appear from Stanford after this
year, along with the phasing out
of the rest of the Health Educa
tion Department.
Dr. Cobb was a controversial
teacher. Many students thought
he delighted in flaunting "ob
scene" four-letter words. Some
students have called him a "dirty
old man" and a "pervert." But
he was not.
He was an interesting teacher
who made students think about
the quirks of sexual taboos in
our culture and who broadened
our viewpoints.
"Marriage and the Family,"
too, has been much maligned.
Just mention to your friends
that you're taking "Marriage
and the Family" and watch
their reactions, such as "Oh,
taking a mick" or "Looking for
3 easy units of A, huh?"
The Administration shares
this lack of regard for the course
as evidenced by its planning to
drop the course as well as the
department that offers it.
"Marriage and the Family,"
however, is a worthwhile course,
and most students would admit
they got something besides a
grade out of it. Students ask for
courses that are relevant to
relevant to them, and "Marriage
and the Family" is one of the
most relevant courses at Stan
ford.
The course awakes students
to the realities of an interper
sonal relationship such as mar
riage and discusses the family,
perhaps the most important
group in our tradition-lacking
and restless society. Probably no
other course approximates this
coverage.
But the University feels it
must move "forward," leaving

such a course behind. Perhaps
Stanford should ask itself "Quo
vadis?"

In light of the heated cam

one of the major campaign is
sues that have been thrown
around, I thought the following
would be of interest:
"The streets of our coun

ening us with her might, and

"Yes, danger from within

"Yes, without law and or

We are laughed at by other

• In Re Morley
Editor, The Daily:
Let me begin by saying that
I find it quite difficult to answer
Mr. Morley's letter to you of Oc
tober 24, for it is difficult to
decide what his position is.
There are, however, several
points which I can answer. The
first concerns just how many
that I, as Shop Steward in the
English Department, represent.
Presently, thirty-three Teaching
Assistants and three Acting In
structors (who also teach Fresh
man English at only a slightly
higher salary than the Teaching
Assistants do) are members of
the AFT Union.
In addition, four Teaching As
sistants have written letters to
Provost Lyman supporting us
In this matter of higher salaries.
As a result, we can say that I
represent forty (out of a pos

sible fifty-three) members of the
English Department staff in this
issue.
Secondly, I am glad that Mr.
Morley used the phrase "crea
ture comforts," for this is ex
actly what we are asking for:
enough money to live on in the
Bay Area. At present, we earn
$2,300 minus taxes ($200). We
are not asking for an exorbitant
amount of money (or to be able
to live in "style"), only enough
to raise our incomes to some
thing very slightly above the
poverty level.
As it stands now, we have to
borrow money for dental care,
for hospitalization insurance, for
car upkeep (and everyone would
agree that a car is a necessity
in this area), occasionally even
for food.
Also, I might point out that
we are people with the equiva
lents of M.A. degrees who per
form a valuable service for the
University, not only in terms of
leading class meetings but also
in the time we spend outside of
class with each student (in some
cases, this is more valuable than
contact in the classroom).
We are asking for a more
reasonable compensation for the
service we perform, and the Ad
ministration has acknowledged
that we deserve more. The ques
tion is where the money will
come from, and the present ne
gotiations are an attempt to de
cide not only where the money
will come from and if it avail

able, but also what priorities the
Administration uses when it dis
tributes money.
Thirdly, as to the political af
filiates of our Union. Mr. Mor
ley raised two points. As to the
first, our inherent support of
the A.F.T. in New York, I know
of no Union member who sup
ports their action; and our con
vention delegate is at present
working with the New Caucus
(a coalition of "radicals" and
blacks), which is going so far as
to counter-picket and to teach
freedom schools while the regu
lar schools are closed.
As to the second point, the
National A.F.T.'s support of
Humphrey, our local's dues are
not used as contributions to his
campaign (a separate founda
tion, COPE, which asks that
each local join it, makes the con
tributions). I would also ask Mr.
Morley who he would have the
National support. Nixon or Wal
lace?
Finally, let me say that we
will be glad to inform the Ad
ministration that Mr. Morley
does not wish to be considered
for a pay raise and is perhaps
even willing to take a cut in
salary.

• Racism In Union?
Editor, The Daily:
I take exception to Mr. Ed
ward F. Morley's off-the-cuff

attack of the members of New
York City's United Federation
of Teachers as members of a
"white racist union which has
been denying thousands of black
children a meaningful educa
tion in New York City."
I do not wish to enter into an
exhaustive analysis of that sad
dispute at this time, but I would
suggest that a further investi
gation of the facts would shed
more light on the subject. There
are many more things at stake
right now in New York City
than the school system.
President Shanker of the UFT
has accused Mayor Lindsay of
attempting to destroy the union.
The financial support of the
secessionist Ocean Hill-Browns
ville district is coming from
sources whose motives are ques
tionable. The future of labor
unions might very well be at
stake in New York City.
Can all unions remain strong
after one is destroyed? And to
call a union "racist" because it
is fighting for its very existence,
when that fight is not directed
against any minority, is com
pletely ridiculous.
Furthermore, if any act was
"racist" it was that of the school
district's governing board in
summarily dismissing instruc
tors (when they had no such
power) not on the basis of com
petence but merely because they
were white. This, and only this,
was the original cause of the
strike. Now it seems that the
issues have become far more in
volved and important. But does
such a history deserve Mr. Mor
ley's epithet "racist"?
In his all-encompassing state
ment Mr. Morley completely dis
misses these central issues in
the conflict, with an appeal to
unjustified and completely un
called-for smear tactics!
What I wish to address myself
to is just that smear. It seems
that many people are allowing
themselves the luxury of adding
flowery, parenthetical phrases to
their arguments in the hope that
such smears will support the
rest of their shaky position. It
has gotten to the point that no

discussion of any topic is com
plete without such empty words.
The phrases "low and order,"
"anarchists and nihilists," "im
perialism," and "white racism"
are choking communication to
the point that one cannot under
stand what anyone is saying.
How can anyone unite or get to
gether when all that one is asked
to unite under is a bag of cliches,
which mean little or nothing?
Lastly, to link the students in
the Stanford group with any oth
er union is absurd, since each
local has its own separate prob
lems. And to attempt to defame
the Stanford group by associat
ing them with another group
which has been foully and
wrongfully smeared is the very
height of irresponsibility!!

• TA Demand Unwise
Editor, The Daily:
Without commenting on the
other demands of the Political
Science TA's (the Daily, 17 Oc
tober), I wish to point out that
the demand of payment of $300
for each dependent of a TA is
extremely unwise. If Stanford
were to pay TA's some fixed
salary and in addition pay $300
for each dependent, the Univer
sity would in effect be reward
ing those TA's foolish enough to
have children that they could
not afford.
The folly of indiscriminate re
production is being realized by
an increasing number of in
formed people, due in part to the
presence of such excellent books
as Dr. Paul Ehrlich's The Pop
ulation Bomb (95c in paper
back). One has only to compare
the Peninsula of five years ago
with the Peninsula today to note
increased smog and traffic con
gestion and a decline in open
space and in park area per per
son.
Since the TA's seem content to
live under the archaic paternal
istic university system, they
should act responsibly and de
mand that Stanford SUBTRACT
$300 for each dependent ( exclud
ing a spouse, which seems rea
sonable). The University should
not be put in the position of
making the population bomb tick
faster.

• Park-in Rejected
Editor, The Daily:
While I support the Grape
Boycott, I find the recent "park
in" unacceptable. To legislate
morality or the "recognition of
social responsibility" is difficult
enough. Nonlegislative coercion
of morality or recognition of so
cial responsibility can easily be
going too far.
Whatever the decision or jus
tification, such action becomes
the will of a minority impressed
upon the general public. If a
student objects to grape sales
and feels therefore he has the
right and obligation to physic
ally obstruct their sale, then the
Blue Max could find it within his
right and responsibility to phy
sically obstruct "communist"
book sales at Kepler's.
So many people have cooper
ated voluntarily with the Grape
Boycott. Why lose support from
those people who believe in free
dom of choice, choice to estab
lish a union and choice to buy
grapes, by making "Safeway

recognize their social responsi
bility"?

History
• Grape Myths
Editor, The Dally:
I wonder how many Stanford
students bothered to inform
themselves of the facts before
they voted to support the United
Farm Workers in the so-called
grape dispute. My husband and
I spent half the summer in De
lano to learn firsthand what is
happening. Here are the facts:
1. The grape worker portray
ed as a struggling, poor, and ex
ploited group is a myth. The
workers who are presently in
the fields have been harvesting
the crops formany years. Many
of the families live in and
around Delano, and for some of
them picking grapes is a sec
ond job within the family. For
the past two years these work
ers have endured insults, threats,
and general harrassment from
outsiders — demonstrators who
have never been in the fields.
2. Field workers have declared
they want no part of Chavez or
his union, so students who vote
to support the United Farm
Workers are not supporting
grape pickers at all.
3. The union wants "to get"
$1.65 for the workers. Grape
pickers are already receiving an
hourly wage of $1.50 plus a 25
cent bonus per box (three boxes
per hour minimum). I missed
out on the "new math," but that
adds up to a $2.25 minimum in
my book.
4. The farmer hires through a
crew boss, and the workers make
their demands of the farmer
through that same crew boss.
When the crop is ripe on the
vine, the crew has all the bar
gaining power in the world.
5. If the students are well
meaning, then certainly they are
misinformed, or are they merely
expousing a Cause — real or
myth — for the sake of "getting
involved." They are supporting
a boycott which has been de
clared illegal. If the boycott is
successful and grape growers
are forced to turn to mechanized
crops, what will become of the
workers? Whom will the union
attempt to organize then?

Editor, THE DAILY
Certainly your stand on the
UC faculty's right to and re
sponsibility in decisions of ap
pointment and government can
not be disputed. But one must
take issue with the last sentence
of your Tuesday editorial. Your
redoubtable passion for academ
ic freedom has seemingly re
sulted in that same blindness
that you state cripples the Gov
ernor and his followers.
Whatever may be your view
of the Director of the Hoover
Institution as a UC Regent, you
show a blind and incredibly
prejudiced attitude in condemn
ing the Institution in toto by as
serting that it is "already a
blight on the Stanford name."
The Hoover Institution is inter

Your complete (and deliber

that is unworthy of you. Do

The Hoover Institution is un

• Erroneous Parallels
Editor, The DAILY:
In reading the account of Fa

caught by his question as quot
ed by your reporter: "Would the
Jewish prosecutor have prose
cuted the nine of us in Germany
during World War II for burn
ing one of Hitler's draft files?"
This question it seems to me
is selfdefeating since no Jews
occupied responsible positions in
Hitler's Germany during World
War 11. They were either dead,
in concentration camps, in hid

that Father Berrigan weakens
his case by drawing erroneous
historical parallels.

• Errors On May field
Editor, THE DAILY
In the article "Mayfield Resur
rected for Housing" four struc
tural deficiencies were incorrect
ly reported:
1. Poor heating system—four
new 4,000 watt fan forced ther
mostatically controlled electrical
heaters were installed on the
third floor of Mayfield House
and the existing heating system
is being thoroughly checked and
repaired.
2. Condemned kitchen—the old
ATO kitchen was not con
demned by the County of Santa
Clara Health Department. The
kitchen was not opened because
of the large renovation cost to
raise the kitchen to a standard
equivalent to other university
residences and because of the
large operating losses incurred
when operating a kitchen serv
ing 40 residents. Instead, a food
service program was initiated
with Roth and Guthrie Houses.
3. Faulty wiring—all wiring,
fixtures and appliances are in
stalled in accordance with the
State of California Electrical
Safety Orders and certified to
the county of Santa Clara Fire
Marshal's office by a licensed
electrical contractor.
4. Wooden fire escape — the
fire escape was constructed in

California Administration Code,

• Olympic Protest
Editor, The Dally:
I wish to reply to the support
you gave Tommy Smith and
John Carlos in the recent pro
test during the Olympic award
ceremonies. It is difficult to de
termine from the article "Track
Power" whether you justify the
protest on grounds that Hitler
oriented the Games correctly,
that they should be used for po
litical demonstration, or that
such use, although deplorable,
exists in some forms, and that,
therefore, the Olympic Commit
tees should allow it in any form.
The former attitude would, I
believe, be the demise of the
Olympic Games — the athletic
competition would dissolve amid
the acidity of the countless num
ber of bitter political struggles
which continually seethe; such
an attitude would condone Czech
demonstrations against the So
viets, Biaffran against Federalist
Nigeria, Pakistani against India,
Arab against Jew. The Olympic
Games in such an atmosphere
would no longer exist as an
athletic competition.
True, that underlying the
Games is a quite discernable
current of political rivalry, but
to support a perpetration of
wrong simply on the grounds of
its existence has no rational
basis whatsoever and would con
demn any human institution re
gardless of the amount of posi
tive good it was accomplishing.
The simple fact that one
agrees with the cause being
furthered has no bearing on the
legitimacy of its expression, and
support of Tommy Smith and
John Carlos would also affirm
the right to raise a white glove
and demonstrate hideously for
an all-white America. I despise
the latter and because of it, do
not wish to see the former; I
think the Olympic Games are
worth saving from the political
beast which constantly tries to
devour them.

Editor, The Daily:
In a recent Dally Miss Marta
Mahoney objected to some ma
terials which were handed out
at the doors of Memorial Audi
torium at registration time.
I think it is appropriate for
me to clarify what our practice
is in this regard. In Memorial
Auditorium the official registra
tion materials and nothing but
official registration materials are
distributed to new students and
continuing students. Official stu
dent organizations and depart
ments of the University are per
mitted to insert materials in a
packet which is distributed to
students as they enter Memorial
Auditorium.
The Student Financial Man
ager is in general charge of
seeing to it that only official or
ganizations do insert materials,
and Alpha Phi Omega coordi
nates putting the packets togeth
er. This practice was inaugurat
ed six to eight years ago, sup
erseding an earlier situation in
which from fifteen to thirty
representatives or organizations
would be handing out things
separately.
This arrangement was orgin
ally worked out with the then
responsible student representa
tives. Our office is ready to have
this practice reviewed with rep
resentatives of students, faculty,
and members of the administra

• KZSU Policy
Editor, The Dally:
In reference to a recent front
page article, "Cleaver's Speech
Sparks New KZSU Liberaliza
tion," there are several mis-lead
ing statements which, I believe,
require immediate clarification.
1) The "new" policy can hard
ly be termed a liberalization over
KZSU's past policy. Since 1964,
KZSU has permitted and en
couraged the broadcasting of all
shades of opinion, from George
Lincoln Rockwell's speech on
Negro inferiority to last spring's
series on Racism in America.
2) Having authored this
"new" policy, J. can assure you
that the statement "any pro
gram, regardless of content, will
be permitted on the air" is quite
false. There are a number of
restrictions on profanity, libel,
slander, and most importantly,
on requiring responsible spokes
men.
KZSU will censor no one for
his views, but neither will the
station become the mouthpiece
of every student, faculty or staff
member who wants to hear his
own voice. KZSU's "new" policy
is an improvement, if for no
other reason than the fact that
it puts in writing what has been
verbally "accepted" for years.
The station will have complete
copies of this policy available
soon for those interested. I
would hope that before anyone
"demands" a show on KZSU,
they take the time to read the
requirements they must meet.

KZSU Prog. Director
• Health History
Editor, THE DAILY:
As the architect of the Stan

ford Student Health Service, I
am interested in the comments
in the box in the Daily. It might
help to "look at the record." It
might also help to correct some
mis-apprehensions which are in
the mind of the writer of the
editorial.
In 1946 when the health ser
vice was started, Stanford was
faced with a crisis. The health
service—one man only — was
swamped. The return of the sol
diers skyrocketed enrollments.
The shortage of doctors was
acute. Up to this time a sick
student found a doctor —if he
could—got treatment —good or
bad (the student could not judge
which) and paid whatever this
doctor chose to charge.
Stanford approached me in
some desperation to see if the
Palo Alto Clinic could help. We
worked out the details of the
health service—simply that the
University would pay the Clinic
a capitation fee (i.e. so much
per head) and the Clinic would
maintain an infirmary and give
the students complete compre
hensive care. The University
undertook to self insure for the
hospital bills.
I can say positively that for
twenty-two years the students
of Stanford have had superb
care under this arrangement.
There has been a doctor or doc
tors available every hour, day
and night, Sundays and holi
days, school days and vacations.
And during this whole period
there have been no medical ca
tastrophes except the regretta
ble, inevitable, and unprevent
able suicides. There has been no
instance of serious neglect or
lack of skill. The price the Uni
versity has paid by all insurance
standards has been ridiculously
low — particularly when there
are no deductibles, no co-insur
ance, and no reservations except
pregnancy and long time psy
chosis.
During this period the cost to
the Clinic of the services ren
dered has exceeded the amount
paid by an average of $44,621 a
year or a total for the twenty
one years ending in 1967 of
$936,441. Almost a million dol
lars in supplies and services
have been contributed by the
Clinic to the Stanford Student
Body. This fact is not mentioned.
The proposal that the medical
school take over the health ser
vice is not original with you. It
has been discussed and exam
ined in great detail. The answer
is simply that with their present
personnel whose time is com
pletely taken up with teaching
and research they cannot do it.
It is possible that the health
service might be staffed with
medical students and interns.
I do not believe the Stanford
students who have had free ac
cess to all the mature specialists
in one of the greatest medical
clinics in the country would like
this. If the medical school takes
on this task, they would have
to hire doctors hopefully of the
competence of the clinic doctors
to do the work.
The faculty can't do it in their
spare time. And the situation of

shortage of doctors is such that
they simply cannot get such
men. The privilege of Clinic as
sociation which is highly valued
makes it possible for the health
service to be staffed by highly
skilled men. And, of course, all
the one hundred thirty doctors
in the Clinic are available to
students who need them.
Apparently the writer of the
editorial does not understand
that the Clinic does not profit
when more students are referred
to it. The idea of stationing a
fulltime orthopedist at Cowell is
silly. No orthopedist of sufficient
competence to be worthy to care
for the students would accept
such an assignment.
In summary — the Stanford
students have had superb care
for twenty-one years under the
present arrangement. The price
is very low as attested by the
million dollar deficit the Clinic
has incurred in the twenty years
it has been involved. No alterna
tive arrangement would make
available such competence at
such a price. The withdrawal of
the University from furnishing
hospital care has nothing to do
with the Clinic agreement but
is a matter between the students
and the school.
As a matter of fact it was
found that many of the students
were already covered (as are al
most seventy-five percent of all
people) by private insurance for
hospitalization and the Univer
sity's coverage just gave double
coverage and helped the insur
ance companies.
A great single group coverage
for all students deserves some
consideration. In closing it
would be in the interests of good
journalism if the editor had con
sulted with people who know
the facts and the background.

• Scott On Gaieties
Editor, The Daily:
Johnie Scotts' column, like any
other great piece of propoganda,
has, on a quick reading, at least
one each of: grains of truth, un
truths, half-truths, and distor
tions.
1. Grain of truth: We are not
producing the show.
2. Untruth: "Among the state
ments floating around the room
— 'Why, this play is racist and
immoral,' 'Uh, uh, you know we
can't have a play with more
blacks than whites in it!' " Those
statements were uttered at a
meeting with erstwhile director
Bob Fletcher early in August,
with clear sarcasm, by a design
er. It was Fletcher, Johnie's
White Sidekick, who reported
the remarks, removed the sar
casm, and placed them at the
September 23 meeting, where
the subject was never mentioned
by anybody.
3. Untruth: "... the deci
sion by the Board not to do the
script." At the September 23
meeting, Bob Fletcher proposed
a set of physically impossible
requirements for doing the show,
proceeded to admit that they
were impossible, and went on to

say that he would not do the
show anyway.
4. Distortion: "Black art . . .
cannot enter the System normal
ly ... " Black art probably
could have entered "the Sys
tem" normally. Unfortunately, as
Johnie admitted to me when I
discussed the play with him in
August, his play "sounded as if
it had been written by a white
middle-class liberal college stu
dent."
5. Half-truth: The "censors"
did indeed keep Johnie from us
ing any profanity. Unfortunate
ly, the, censor was, as Johnie also
told me in August, Bob Fletcher,
who never was or will be a
Ram's Head Board Member.

• Sex Course Dropped
Editor, The Daily:
Last spring quarter Dr. B.
Otis Cobb of the Health Educa
tion Department taught his last
course at Stanford. The course
was "Marriage and the Family."
Now it seems that Stanford
is "streamlining" *its curricu
lum and that the course will dis
appear from Stanford after this
year, along with the phasing out
of the rest of the Health Educa
tion Department.
Dr. Cobb was a controversial
teacher. Many students thought
he delighted in flaunting "ob
scene" four-letter words. Some
students have called him a "dirty
old man" and a "pervert." But
he was not.
He was an interesting teacher
who made students think about
the quirks of sexual taboos in
our culture and who broadened
our viewpoints.
"Marriage and the Family,"
too, has been much maligned.
Just mention to your friends
that you're taking "Marriage
and the Family" and watch
their reactions, such as "Oh,
taking a mick" or "Looking for
3 easy units of A, huh?"
The Administration shares
this lack of regard for the course
as evidenced by its planning to
drop the course as well as the
department that offers it.
"Marriage and the Family,"
however, is a worthwhile course,
and most students would admit
they got something besides a
grade out of it. Students ask for
courses that are relevant to
relevant to them, and "Marriage
and the Family" is one of the
most relevant courses at Stan
ford.
The course awakes students
to the realities of an interper
sonal relationship such as mar
riage and discusses the family,
perhaps the most important
group in our tradition-lacking
and restless society. Probably no
other course approximates this
coverage.
But the University feels it
must move "forward," leaving

such a course behind. Perhaps
Stanford should ask itself "Quo
vadis?"

• In Re Morley
Editor, The Daily:
Let me begin by saying that
I find it quite difficult to answer
Mr. Morley's letter to you of Oc
tober 24, for it is difficult to
decide what his position is.
There are, however, several
points which I can answer. The
first concerns just how many
that I, as Shop Steward in the
English Department, represent.
Presently, thirty-three Teaching
Assistants and three Acting In
structors (who also teach Fresh
man English at only a slightly
higher salary than the Teaching
Assistants do) are members of
the AFT Union.
In addition, four Teaching As
sistants have written letters to
Provost Lyman supporting us
In this matter of higher salaries.
As a result, we can say that I
represent forty (out of a pos

sible fifty-three) members of the
English Department staff in this
issue.
Secondly, I am glad that Mr.
Morley used the phrase "crea
ture comforts," for this is ex
actly what we are asking for:
enough money to live on in the
Bay Area. At present, we earn
$2,300 minus taxes ($200). We
are not asking for an exorbitant
amount of money (or to be able
to live in "style"), only enough
to raise our incomes to some
thing very slightly above the
poverty level.
As it stands now, we have to
borrow money for dental care,
for hospitalization insurance, for
car upkeep (and everyone would
agree that a car is a necessity
in this area), occasionally even
for food.
Also, I might point out that
we are people with the equiva
lents of M.A. degrees who per
form a valuable service for the
University, not only in terms of
leading class meetings but also
in the time we spend outside of
class with each student (in some
cases, this is more valuable than
contact in the classroom).
We are asking for a more
reasonable compensation for the
service we perform, and the Ad
ministration has acknowledged
that we deserve more. The ques
tion is where the money will
come from, and the present ne
gotiations are an attempt to de
cide not only where the money
will come from and if it avail

able, but also what priorities the
Administration uses when it dis
tributes money.
Thirdly, as to the political af
filiates of our Union. Mr. Mor
ley raised two points. As to the
first, our inherent support of
the A.F.T. in New York, I know
of no Union member who sup
ports their action; and our con
vention delegate is at present
working with the New Caucus
(a coalition of "radicals" and
blacks), which is going so far as
to counter-picket and to teach
freedom schools while the regu
lar schools are closed.
As to the second point, the
National A.F.T.'s support of
Humphrey, our local's dues are
not used as contributions to his
campaign (a separate founda
tion, COPE, which asks that
each local join it, makes the con
tributions). I would also ask Mr.
Morley who he would have the
National support. Nixon or Wal
lace?
Finally, let me say that we
will be glad to inform the Ad
ministration that Mr. Morley
does not wish to be considered
for a pay raise and is perhaps
even willing to take a cut in
salary.

• Racism In Union?
Editor, The Daily:
I take exception to Mr. Ed
ward F. Morley's off-the-cuff

attack of the members of New
York City's United Federation
of Teachers as members of a
"white racist union which has
been denying thousands of black
children a meaningful educa
tion in New York City."
I do not wish to enter into an
exhaustive analysis of that sad
dispute at this time, but I would
suggest that a further investi
gation of the facts would shed
more light on the subject. There
are many more things at stake
right now in New York City
than the school system.
President Shanker of the UFT
has accused Mayor Lindsay of
attempting to destroy the union.
The financial support of the
secessionist Ocean Hill-Browns
ville district is coming from
sources whose motives are ques
tionable. The future of labor
unions might very well be at
stake in New York City.
Can all unions remain strong
after one is destroyed? And to
call a union "racist" because it
is fighting for its very existence,
when that fight is not directed
against any minority, is com
pletely ridiculous.
Furthermore, if any act was
"racist" it was that of the school
district's governing board in
summarily dismissing instruc
tors (when they had no such
power) not on the basis of com
petence but merely because they
were white. This, and only this,
was the original cause of the
strike. Now it seems that the
issues have become far more in
volved and important. But does
such a history deserve Mr. Mor
ley's epithet "racist"?
In his all-encompassing state
ment Mr. Morley completely dis
misses these central issues in
the conflict, with an appeal to
unjustified and completely un
called-for smear tactics!
What I wish to address myself
to is just that smear. It seems
that many people are allowing
themselves the luxury of adding
flowery, parenthetical phrases to
their arguments in the hope that
such smears will support the
rest of their shaky position. It
has gotten to the point that no

discussion of any topic is com
plete without such empty words.
The phrases "low and order,"
"anarchists and nihilists," "im
perialism," and "white racism"
are choking communication to
the point that one cannot under
stand what anyone is saying.
How can anyone unite or get to
gether when all that one is asked
to unite under is a bag of cliches,
which mean little or nothing?
Lastly, to link the students in
the Stanford group with any oth
er union is absurd, since each
local has its own separate prob
lems. And to attempt to defame
the Stanford group by associat
ing them with another group
which has been foully and
wrongfully smeared is the very
height of irresponsibility!!

• TA Demand Unwise
Editor, The Daily:
Without commenting on the
other demands of the Political
Science TA's (the Daily, 17 Oc
tober), I wish to point out that
the demand of payment of $300
for each dependent of a TA is
extremely unwise. If Stanford
were to pay TA's some fixed
salary and in addition pay $300
for each dependent, the Univer
sity would in effect be reward
ing those TA's foolish enough to
have children that they could
not afford.
The folly of indiscriminate re
production is being realized by
an increasing number of in
formed people, due in part to the
presence of such excellent books
as Dr. Paul Ehrlich's The Pop
ulation Bomb (95c in paper
back). One has only to compare
the Peninsula of five years ago
with the Peninsula today to note
increased smog and traffic con
gestion and a decline in open
space and in park area per per
son.
Since the TA's seem content to
live under the archaic paternal
istic university system, they
should act responsibly and de
mand that Stanford SUBTRACT
$300 for each dependent ( exclud
ing a spouse, which seems rea
sonable). The University should
not be put in the position of
making the population bomb tick
faster.

• Park-in Rejected
Editor, The Daily:
While I support the Grape
Boycott, I find the recent "park
in" unacceptable. To legislate
morality or the "recognition of
social responsibility" is difficult
enough. Nonlegislative coercion
of morality or recognition of so
cial responsibility can easily be
going too far.
Whatever the decision or jus
tification, such action becomes
the will of a minority impressed
upon the general public. If a
student objects to grape sales
and feels therefore he has the
right and obligation to physic
ally obstruct their sale, then the
Blue Max could find it within his
right and responsibility to phy
sically obstruct "communist"
book sales at Kepler's.
So many people have cooper
ated voluntarily with the Grape
Boycott. Why lose support from
those people who believe in free
dom of choice, choice to estab
lish a union and choice to buy
grapes, by making "Safeway

recognize their social responsi
bility"?

History
• Grape Myths
Editor, The Dally:
I wonder how many Stanford
students bothered to inform
themselves of the facts before
they voted to support the United
Farm Workers in the so-called
grape dispute. My husband and
I spent half the summer in De
lano to learn firsthand what is
happening. Here are the facts:
1. The grape worker portray
ed as a struggling, poor, and ex
ploited group is a myth. The
workers who are presently in
the fields have been harvesting
the crops formany years. Many
of the families live in and
around Delano, and for some of
them picking grapes is a sec
ond job within the family. For
the past two years these work
ers have endured insults, threats,
and general harrassment from
outsiders — demonstrators who
have never been in the fields.
2. Field workers have declared
they want no part of Chavez or
his union, so students who vote
to support the United Farm
Workers are not supporting
grape pickers at all.
3. The union wants "to get"
$1.65 for the workers. Grape
pickers are already receiving an
hourly wage of $1.50 plus a 25
cent bonus per box (three boxes
per hour minimum). I missed
out on the "new math," but that
adds up to a $2.25 minimum in
my book.
4. The farmer hires through a
crew boss, and the workers make
their demands of the farmer
through that same crew boss.
When the crop is ripe on the
vine, the crew has all the bar
gaining power in the world.
5. If the students are well
meaning, then certainly they are
misinformed, or are they merely
expousing a Cause — real or
myth — for the sake of "getting
involved." They are supporting
a boycott which has been de
clared illegal. If the boycott is
successful and grape growers
are forced to turn to mechanized
crops, what will become of the
workers? Whom will the union
attempt to organize then?

Certainly your stand on the

Editor, The DAILY:
In reading the account of Fa

caught by his question as quot
ed by your reporter: "Would the
Jewish prosecutor have prose
cuted the nine of us in Germany
during World War II for burn
ing one of Hitler's draft files?"
This question it seems to me
is selfdefeating since no Jews
occupied responsible positions in
Hitler's Germany during World

that Father Berrigan weakens
his case by drawing erroneous

In the article "Mayfield Resur

tural deficiencies were incorrect

1. Poor heating system—four
new 4,000 watt fan forced ther
mostatically controlled electrical
heaters were installed on the
third floor of Mayfield House
and the existing heating system
is being thoroughly checked and
repaired.
2. Condemned kitchen—the old
ATO kitchen was not con
demned by the County of Santa
Clara Health Department. The
kitchen was not opened because
of the large renovation cost to
raise the kitchen to a standard
equivalent to other university
residences and because of the
large operating losses incurred
when operating a kitchen serv

service program was initiated
with Roth and Guthrie Houses.
3. Faulty wiring—all wiring,

• Olympic Protest
Editor, The Dally:
I wish to reply to the support
you gave Tommy Smith and
John Carlos in the recent pro
test during the Olympic award
ceremonies. It is difficult to de
termine from the article "Track
Power" whether you justify the
protest on grounds that Hitler
oriented the Games correctly,
that they should be used for po
litical demonstration, or that
such use, although deplorable,
exists in some forms, and that,
therefore, the Olympic Commit
tees should allow it in any form.
The former attitude would, I
believe, be the demise of the
Olympic Games — the athletic
competition would dissolve amid
the acidity of the countless num
ber of bitter political struggles
which continually seethe; such
an attitude would condone Czech
demonstrations against the So
viets, Biaffran against Federalist
Nigeria, Pakistani against India,
Arab against Jew. The Olympic
Games in such an atmosphere
would no longer exist as an
athletic competition.
True, that underlying the
Games is a quite discernable
current of political rivalry, but
to support a perpetration of
wrong simply on the grounds of
its existence has no rational
basis whatsoever and would con
demn any human institution re
gardless of the amount of posi
tive good it was accomplishing.
The simple fact that one
agrees with the cause being
furthered has no bearing on the
legitimacy of its expression, and
support of Tommy Smith and
John Carlos would also affirm
the right to raise a white glove
and demonstrate hideously for
an all-white America. I despise
the latter and because of it, do
not wish to see the former; I
think the Olympic Games are
worth saving from the political
beast which constantly tries to
devour them.

In a recent Dally Miss Marta

I think it is appropriate for
me to clarify what our practice
is in this regard. In Memorial
Auditorium the official registra
tion materials and nothing but
official registration materials are
distributed to new students and
continuing students. Official stu
dent organizations and depart
ments of the University are per
mitted to insert materials in a

The Student Financial Man
ager is in general charge of
seeing to it that only official or

and Alpha Phi Omega coordi
nates putting the packets togeth

ed six to eight years ago, sup
erseding an earlier situation in
which from fifteen to thirty
representatives or organizations
would be handing out things
separately.
This arrangement was orgin

this practice reviewed with rep

• KZSU Policy
Editor, The Dally:
In reference to a recent front
page article, "Cleaver's Speech
Sparks New KZSU Liberaliza
tion," there are several mis-lead
ing statements which, I believe,
require immediate clarification.
1) The "new" policy can hard
ly be termed a liberalization over
KZSU's past policy. Since 1964,
KZSU has permitted and en
couraged the broadcasting of all
shades of opinion, from George
Lincoln Rockwell's speech on
Negro inferiority to last spring's
series on Racism in America.
2) Having authored this
"new" policy, J. can assure you
that the statement "any pro
gram, regardless of content, will
be permitted on the air" is quite
false. There are a number of
restrictions on profanity, libel,
slander, and most importantly,
on requiring responsible spokes
men.
KZSU will censor no one for
his views, but neither will the
station become the mouthpiece
of every student, faculty or staff
member who wants to hear his
own voice. KZSU's "new" policy
is an improvement, if for no
other reason than the fact that
it puts in writing what has been
verbally "accepted" for years.
The station will have complete
copies of this policy available
soon for those interested. I
would hope that before anyone
"demands" a show on KZSU,
they take the time to read the
requirements they must meet.

KZSU Prog. Director
• Health History
Editor, THE DAILY:
As the architect of the Stan

ford Student Health Service, I
am interested in the comments
in the box in the Daily. It might
help to "look at the record." It
might also help to correct some
mis-apprehensions which are in
the mind of the writer of the
editorial.
In 1946 when the health ser
vice was started, Stanford was
faced with a crisis. The health
service—one man only — was
swamped. The return of the sol
diers skyrocketed enrollments.
The shortage of doctors was
acute. Up to this time a sick
student found a doctor —if he
could—got treatment —good or
bad (the student could not judge
which) and paid whatever this
doctor chose to charge.
Stanford approached me in
some desperation to see if the
Palo Alto Clinic could help. We
worked out the details of the
health service—simply that the
University would pay the Clinic
a capitation fee (i.e. so much
per head) and the Clinic would
maintain an infirmary and give
the students complete compre
hensive care. The University
undertook to self insure for the
hospital bills.
I can say positively that for
twenty-two years the students
of Stanford have had superb
care under this arrangement.
There has been a doctor or doc
tors available every hour, day
and night, Sundays and holi
days, school days and vacations.
And during this whole period
there have been no medical ca
tastrophes except the regretta
ble, inevitable, and unprevent
able suicides. There has been no
instance of serious neglect or
lack of skill. The price the Uni
versity has paid by all insurance
standards has been ridiculously
low — particularly when there
are no deductibles, no co-insur
ance, and no reservations except
pregnancy and long time psy
chosis.
During this period the cost to
the Clinic of the services ren
dered has exceeded the amount
paid by an average of $44,621 a
year or a total for the twenty
one years ending in 1967 of
$936,441. Almost a million dol
lars in supplies and services
have been contributed by the
Clinic to the Stanford Student
Body. This fact is not mentioned.
The proposal that the medical
school take over the health ser
vice is not original with you. It
has been discussed and exam
ined in great detail. The answer
is simply that with their present
personnel whose time is com
pletely taken up with teaching
and research they cannot do it.
It is possible that the health
service might be staffed with
medical students and interns.
I do not believe the Stanford
students who have had free ac
cess to all the mature specialists
in one of the greatest medical
clinics in the country would like
this. If the medical school takes
on this task, they would have
to hire doctors hopefully of the
competence of the clinic doctors
to do the work.
The faculty can't do it in their
spare time. And the situation of

shortage of doctors is such that
they simply cannot get such
men. The privilege of Clinic as
sociation which is highly valued
makes it possible for the health
service to be staffed by highly
skilled men. And, of course, all
the one hundred thirty doctors
in the Clinic are available to
students who need them.
Apparently the writer of the
editorial does not understand
that the Clinic does not profit
when more students are referred
to it. The idea of stationing a
fulltime orthopedist at Cowell is
silly. No orthopedist of sufficient
competence to be worthy to care
for the students would accept
such an assignment.
In summary — the Stanford
students have had superb care
for twenty-one years under the
present arrangement. The price
is very low as attested by the
million dollar deficit the Clinic
has incurred in the twenty years
it has been involved. No alterna
tive arrangement would make
available such competence at
such a price. The withdrawal of
the University from furnishing
hospital care has nothing to do
with the Clinic agreement but
is a matter between the students
and the school.
As a matter of fact it was
found that many of the students
were already covered (as are al
most seventy-five percent of all
people) by private insurance for
hospitalization and the Univer
sity's coverage just gave double
coverage and helped the insur
ance companies.
A great single group coverage
for all students deserves some
consideration. In closing it
would be in the interests of good
journalism if the editor had con
sulted with people who know
the facts and the background.

• Scott On Gaieties
Editor, The Daily:
Johnie Scotts' column, like any
other great piece of propoganda,
has, on a quick reading, at least
one each of: grains of truth, un
truths, half-truths, and distor
tions.
1. Grain of truth: We are not
producing the show.
2. Untruth: "Among the state
ments floating around the room
— 'Why, this play is racist and
immoral,' 'Uh, uh, you know we
can't have a play with more
blacks than whites in it!' " Those
statements were uttered at a
meeting with erstwhile director
Bob Fletcher early in August,
with clear sarcasm, by a design
er. It was Fletcher, Johnie's
White Sidekick, who reported
the remarks, removed the sar
casm, and placed them at the
September 23 meeting, where
the subject was never mentioned
by anybody.
3. Untruth: "... the deci
sion by the Board not to do the
script." At the September 23
meeting, Bob Fletcher proposed
a set of physically impossible
requirements for doing the show,
proceeded to admit that they
were impossible, and went on to

say that he would not do the
show anyway.
4. Distortion: "Black art . . .
cannot enter the System normal
ly ... " Black art probably
could have entered "the Sys
tem" normally. Unfortunately, as
Johnie admitted to me when I
discussed the play with him in
August, his play "sounded as if
it had been written by a white
middle-class liberal college stu
dent."
5. Half-truth: The "censors"
did indeed keep Johnie from us
ing any profanity. Unfortunate
ly, the, censor was, as Johnie also
told me in August, Bob Fletcher,
who never was or will be a
Ram's Head Board Member.

• Sex Course Dropped
Editor, The Daily:
Last spring quarter Dr. B.
Otis Cobb of the Health Educa
tion Department taught his last
course at Stanford. The course
was "Marriage and the Family."
Now it seems that Stanford
is "streamlining" *its curricu
lum and that the course will dis
appear from Stanford after this
year, along with the phasing out
of the rest of the Health Educa
tion Department.
Dr. Cobb was a controversial
teacher. Many students thought
he delighted in flaunting "ob
scene" four-letter words. Some
students have called him a "dirty
old man" and a "pervert." But
he was not.
He was an interesting teacher
who made students think about
the quirks of sexual taboos in
our culture and who broadened
our viewpoints.
"Marriage and the Family,"
too, has been much maligned.
Just mention to your friends
that you're taking "Marriage
and the Family" and watch
their reactions, such as "Oh,
taking a mick" or "Looking for
3 easy units of A, huh?"
The Administration shares
this lack of regard for the course
as evidenced by its planning to
drop the course as well as the
department that offers it.
"Marriage and the Family,"
however, is a worthwhile course,
and most students would admit
they got something besides a
grade out of it. Students ask for
courses that are relevant to
relevant to them, and "Marriage
and the Family" is one of the
most relevant courses at Stan
ford.
The course awakes students
to the realities of an interper
sonal relationship such as mar
riage and discusses the family,
perhaps the most important
group in our tradition-lacking
and restless society. Probably no
other course approximates this
coverage.
But the University feels it
must move "forward," leaving

such a course behind. Perhaps
Stanford should ask itself "Quo
vadis?"

Editor, The DAILY:
In light of the heated cam

one of the major campaign is

would be of interest:
"The streets of our coun

rebelling and rioting. Commu

our country. Russia Is threat
ening us with her might, and

"Yes, without law and or

TIMOTHY GILL
• In Re Morley
Editor, The Daily:
Let me begin by saying that
I find it quite difficult to answer
Mr. Morley's letter to you of Oc
tober 24, for it is difficult to
decide what his position is.
There are, however, several
points which I can answer. The
first concerns just how many
that I, as Shop Steward in the
English Department, represent.
Presently, thirty-three Teaching
Assistants and three Acting In
structors (who also teach Fresh
man English at only a slightly
higher salary than the Teaching
Assistants do) are members of
the AFT Union.
In addition, four Teaching As
sistants have written letters to
Provost Lyman supporting us
In this matter of higher salaries.
As a result, we can say that I
represent forty (out of a pos

sible fifty-three) members of the
English Department staff in this
issue.
Secondly, I am glad that Mr.
Morley used the phrase "crea
ture comforts," for this is ex
actly what we are asking for:
enough money to live on in the
Bay Area. At present, we earn
$2,300 minus taxes ($200). We
are not asking for an exorbitant
amount of money (or to be able
to live in "style"), only enough
to raise our incomes to some
thing very slightly above the
poverty level.
As it stands now, we have to
borrow money for dental care,
for hospitalization insurance, for
car upkeep (and everyone would
agree that a car is a necessity
in this area), occasionally even
for food.
Also, I might point out that
we are people with the equiva
lents of M.A. degrees who per
form a valuable service for the
University, not only in terms of
leading class meetings but also
in the time we spend outside of
class with each student (in some
cases, this is more valuable than
contact in the classroom).
We are asking for a more
reasonable compensation for the
service we perform, and the Ad
ministration has acknowledged
that we deserve more. The ques
tion is where the money will
come from, and the present ne
gotiations are an attempt to de
cide not only where the money
will come from and if it avail

able, but also what priorities the
Administration uses when it dis
tributes money.
Thirdly, as to the political af
filiates of our Union. Mr. Mor
ley raised two points. As to the
first, our inherent support of
the A.F.T. in New York, I know
of no Union member who sup
ports their action; and our con
vention delegate is at present
working with the New Caucus
(a coalition of "radicals" and
blacks), which is going so far as
to counter-picket and to teach
freedom schools while the regu
lar schools are closed.
As to the second point, the
National A.F.T.'s support of
Humphrey, our local's dues are
not used as contributions to his
campaign (a separate founda
tion, COPE, which asks that
each local join it, makes the con
tributions). I would also ask Mr.
Morley who he would have the
National support. Nixon or Wal
lace?
Finally, let me say that we
will be glad to inform the Ad
ministration that Mr. Morley
does not wish to be considered
for a pay raise and is perhaps
even willing to take a cut in
salary.

• Racism In Union?
Editor, The Daily:
I take exception to Mr. Ed
ward F. Morley's off-the-cuff

attack of the members of New
York City's United Federation
of Teachers as members of a
"white racist union which has
been denying thousands of black
children a meaningful educa
tion in New York City."
I do not wish to enter into an
exhaustive analysis of that sad
dispute at this time, but I would
suggest that a further investi
gation of the facts would shed
more light on the subject. There
are many more things at stake
right now in New York City
than the school system.
President Shanker of the UFT
has accused Mayor Lindsay of
attempting to destroy the union.
The financial support of the
secessionist Ocean Hill-Browns
ville district is coming from
sources whose motives are ques
tionable. The future of labor
unions might very well be at
stake in New York City.
Can all unions remain strong
after one is destroyed? And to
call a union "racist" because it
is fighting for its very existence,
when that fight is not directed
against any minority, is com
pletely ridiculous.
Furthermore, if any act was
"racist" it was that of the school
district's governing board in
summarily dismissing instruc
tors (when they had no such
power) not on the basis of com
petence but merely because they
were white. This, and only this,
was the original cause of the
strike. Now it seems that the
issues have become far more in
volved and important. But does
such a history deserve Mr. Mor
ley's epithet "racist"?
In his all-encompassing state
ment Mr. Morley completely dis
misses these central issues in
the conflict, with an appeal to
unjustified and completely un
called-for smear tactics!
What I wish to address myself
to is just that smear. It seems
that many people are allowing
themselves the luxury of adding
flowery, parenthetical phrases to
their arguments in the hope that
such smears will support the
rest of their shaky position. It
has gotten to the point that no

discussion of any topic is com
plete without such empty words.
The phrases "low and order,"
"anarchists and nihilists," "im
perialism," and "white racism"
are choking communication to
the point that one cannot under
stand what anyone is saying.
How can anyone unite or get to
gether when all that one is asked
to unite under is a bag of cliches,
which mean little or nothing?
Lastly, to link the students in
the Stanford group with any oth
er union is absurd, since each
local has its own separate prob
lems. And to attempt to defame
the Stanford group by associat
ing them with another group
which has been foully and
wrongfully smeared is the very
height of irresponsibility!!

• TA Demand Unwise
Editor, The Daily:
Without commenting on the
other demands of the Political
Science TA's (the Daily, 17 Oc
tober), I wish to point out that
the demand of payment of $300
for each dependent of a TA is
extremely unwise. If Stanford
were to pay TA's some fixed
salary and in addition pay $300
for each dependent, the Univer
sity would in effect be reward
ing those TA's foolish enough to
have children that they could
not afford.
The folly of indiscriminate re
production is being realized by
an increasing number of in
formed people, due in part to the
presence of such excellent books
as Dr. Paul Ehrlich's The Pop
ulation Bomb (95c in paper
back). One has only to compare
the Peninsula of five years ago
with the Peninsula today to note
increased smog and traffic con
gestion and a decline in open
space and in park area per per
son.
Since the TA's seem content to
live under the archaic paternal
istic university system, they
should act responsibly and de
mand that Stanford SUBTRACT
$300 for each dependent ( exclud
ing a spouse, which seems rea
sonable). The University should
not be put in the position of
making the population bomb tick
faster.

• Park-in Rejected
Editor, The Daily:
While I support the Grape
Boycott, I find the recent "park
in" unacceptable. To legislate
morality or the "recognition of
social responsibility" is difficult
enough. Nonlegislative coercion
of morality or recognition of so
cial responsibility can easily be
going too far.
Whatever the decision or jus
tification, such action becomes
the will of a minority impressed
upon the general public. If a
student objects to grape sales
and feels therefore he has the
right and obligation to physic
ally obstruct their sale, then the
Blue Max could find it within his
right and responsibility to phy
sically obstruct "communist"
book sales at Kepler's.
So many people have cooper
ated voluntarily with the Grape
Boycott. Why lose support from
those people who believe in free
dom of choice, choice to estab
lish a union and choice to buy
grapes, by making "Safeway

recognize their social responsi
bility"?

History
• Grape Myths
Editor, The Dally:
I wonder how many Stanford
students bothered to inform
themselves of the facts before
they voted to support the United
Farm Workers in the so-called
grape dispute. My husband and
I spent half the summer in De
lano to learn firsthand what is
happening. Here are the facts:
1. The grape worker portray
ed as a struggling, poor, and ex
ploited group is a myth. The
workers who are presently in
the fields have been harvesting
the crops formany years. Many
of the families live in and
around Delano, and for some of
them picking grapes is a sec
ond job within the family. For
the past two years these work
ers have endured insults, threats,
and general harrassment from
outsiders — demonstrators who
have never been in the fields.
2. Field workers have declared
they want no part of Chavez or
his union, so students who vote
to support the United Farm
Workers are not supporting
grape pickers at all.
3. The union wants "to get"
$1.65 for the workers. Grape
pickers are already receiving an
hourly wage of $1.50 plus a 25
cent bonus per box (three boxes
per hour minimum). I missed
out on the "new math," but that
adds up to a $2.25 minimum in
my book.
4. The farmer hires through a
crew boss, and the workers make
their demands of the farmer
through that same crew boss.
When the crop is ripe on the
vine, the crew has all the bar
gaining power in the world.
5. If the students are well
meaning, then certainly they are
misinformed, or are they merely
expousing a Cause — real or
myth — for the sake of "getting
involved." They are supporting
a boycott which has been de
clared illegal. If the boycott is
successful and grape growers
are forced to turn to mechanized
crops, what will become of the
workers? Whom will the union
attempt to organize then?

Certainly your stand on the

This question it seems to me
is selfdefeating since no Jews

In the article "Mayfield Resur

mostatically controlled electrical
heaters were installed on the
third floor of Mayfield House
and the existing heating system
is being thoroughly checked and
repaired.
2. Condemned kitchen—the old
ATO kitchen was not con
demned by the County of Santa
Clara Health Department. The
kitchen was not opened because
of the large renovation cost to
raise the kitchen to a standard
equivalent to other university
residences and because of the
large operating losses incurred

• Olympic Protest
Editor, The Dally:
I wish to reply to the support
you gave Tommy Smith and
John Carlos in the recent pro
test during the Olympic award
ceremonies. It is difficult to de
termine from the article "Track
Power" whether you justify the
protest on grounds that Hitler
oriented the Games correctly,
that they should be used for po
litical demonstration, or that
such use, although deplorable,
exists in some forms, and that,
therefore, the Olympic Commit
tees should allow it in any form.
The former attitude would, I
believe, be the demise of the
Olympic Games — the athletic
competition would dissolve amid
the acidity of the countless num
ber of bitter political struggles
which continually seethe; such
an attitude would condone Czech
demonstrations against the So
viets, Biaffran against Federalist
Nigeria, Pakistani against India,
Arab against Jew. The Olympic
Games in such an atmosphere
would no longer exist as an
athletic competition.
True, that underlying the
Games is a quite discernable
current of political rivalry, but
to support a perpetration of
wrong simply on the grounds of
its existence has no rational
basis whatsoever and would con
demn any human institution re
gardless of the amount of posi
tive good it was accomplishing.
The simple fact that one
agrees with the cause being
furthered has no bearing on the
legitimacy of its expression, and
support of Tommy Smith and
John Carlos would also affirm
the right to raise a white glove
and demonstrate hideously for
an all-white America. I despise
the latter and because of it, do
not wish to see the former; I
think the Olympic Games are
worth saving from the political
beast which constantly tries to
devour them.

• KZSU Policy
Editor, The Dally:
In reference to a recent front
page article, "Cleaver's Speech
Sparks New KZSU Liberaliza
tion," there are several mis-lead
ing statements which, I believe,
require immediate clarification.
1) The "new" policy can hard
ly be termed a liberalization over
KZSU's past policy. Since 1964,
KZSU has permitted and en
couraged the broadcasting of all
shades of opinion, from George
Lincoln Rockwell's speech on
Negro inferiority to last spring's
series on Racism in America.
2) Having authored this
"new" policy, J. can assure you
that the statement "any pro
gram, regardless of content, will
be permitted on the air" is quite
false. There are a number of
restrictions on profanity, libel,
slander, and most importantly,
on requiring responsible spokes
men.
KZSU will censor no one for
his views, but neither will the
station become the mouthpiece
of every student, faculty or staff
member who wants to hear his
own voice. KZSU's "new" policy
is an improvement, if for no
other reason than the fact that
it puts in writing what has been
verbally "accepted" for years.
The station will have complete
copies of this policy available
soon for those interested. I
would hope that before anyone
"demands" a show on KZSU,
they take the time to read the
requirements they must meet.

KZSU Prog. Director
• Health History
Editor, THE DAILY:
As the architect of the Stan

ford Student Health Service, I
am interested in the comments
in the box in the Daily. It might
help to "look at the record." It
might also help to correct some
mis-apprehensions which are in
the mind of the writer of the
editorial.
In 1946 when the health ser
vice was started, Stanford was
faced with a crisis. The health
service—one man only — was
swamped. The return of the sol
diers skyrocketed enrollments.
The shortage of doctors was
acute. Up to this time a sick
student found a doctor —if he
could—got treatment —good or
bad (the student could not judge
which) and paid whatever this
doctor chose to charge.
Stanford approached me in
some desperation to see if the
Palo Alto Clinic could help. We
worked out the details of the
health service—simply that the
University would pay the Clinic
a capitation fee (i.e. so much
per head) and the Clinic would
maintain an infirmary and give
the students complete compre
hensive care. The University
undertook to self insure for the
hospital bills.
I can say positively that for
twenty-two years the students
of Stanford have had superb
care under this arrangement.
There has been a doctor or doc
tors available every hour, day
and night, Sundays and holi
days, school days and vacations.
And during this whole period
there have been no medical ca
tastrophes except the regretta
ble, inevitable, and unprevent
able suicides. There has been no
instance of serious neglect or
lack of skill. The price the Uni
versity has paid by all insurance
standards has been ridiculously
low — particularly when there
are no deductibles, no co-insur
ance, and no reservations except
pregnancy and long time psy
chosis.
During this period the cost to
the Clinic of the services ren
dered has exceeded the amount
paid by an average of $44,621 a
year or a total for the twenty
one years ending in 1967 of
$936,441. Almost a million dol
lars in supplies and services
have been contributed by the
Clinic to the Stanford Student
Body. This fact is not mentioned.
The proposal that the medical
school take over the health ser
vice is not original with you. It
has been discussed and exam
ined in great detail. The answer
is simply that with their present
personnel whose time is com
pletely taken up with teaching
and research they cannot do it.
It is possible that the health
service might be staffed with
medical students and interns.
I do not believe the Stanford
students who have had free ac
cess to all the mature specialists
in one of the greatest medical
clinics in the country would like
this. If the medical school takes
on this task, they would have
to hire doctors hopefully of the
competence of the clinic doctors
to do the work.
The faculty can't do it in their
spare time. And the situation of

shortage of doctors is such that
they simply cannot get such
men. The privilege of Clinic as
sociation which is highly valued
makes it possible for the health
service to be staffed by highly
skilled men. And, of course, all
the one hundred thirty doctors
in the Clinic are available to
students who need them.
Apparently the writer of the
editorial does not understand
that the Clinic does not profit
when more students are referred
to it. The idea of stationing a
fulltime orthopedist at Cowell is
silly. No orthopedist of sufficient
competence to be worthy to care
for the students would accept
such an assignment.
In summary — the Stanford
students have had superb care
for twenty-one years under the
present arrangement. The price
is very low as attested by the
million dollar deficit the Clinic
has incurred in the twenty years
it has been involved. No alterna
tive arrangement would make
available such competence at
such a price. The withdrawal of
the University from furnishing
hospital care has nothing to do
with the Clinic agreement but
is a matter between the students
and the school.
As a matter of fact it was
found that many of the students
were already covered (as are al
most seventy-five percent of all
people) by private insurance for
hospitalization and the Univer
sity's coverage just gave double
coverage and helped the insur
ance companies.
A great single group coverage
for all students deserves some
consideration. In closing it
would be in the interests of good
journalism if the editor had con
sulted with people who know
the facts and the background.

• Scott On Gaieties
Editor, The Daily:
Johnie Scotts' column, like any
other great piece of propoganda,
has, on a quick reading, at least
one each of: grains of truth, un
truths, half-truths, and distor
tions.
1. Grain of truth: We are not
producing the show.
2. Untruth: "Among the state
ments floating around the room
— 'Why, this play is racist and
immoral,' 'Uh, uh, you know we
can't have a play with more
blacks than whites in it!' " Those
statements were uttered at a
meeting with erstwhile director
Bob Fletcher early in August,
with clear sarcasm, by a design
er. It was Fletcher, Johnie's
White Sidekick, who reported
the remarks, removed the sar
casm, and placed them at the
September 23 meeting, where
the subject was never mentioned
by anybody.
3. Untruth: "... the deci
sion by the Board not to do the
script." At the September 23
meeting, Bob Fletcher proposed
a set of physically impossible
requirements for doing the show,
proceeded to admit that they
were impossible, and went on to

say that he would not do the
show anyway.
4. Distortion: "Black art . . .
cannot enter the System normal
ly ... " Black art probably
could have entered "the Sys
tem" normally. Unfortunately, as
Johnie admitted to me when I
discussed the play with him in
August, his play "sounded as if
it had been written by a white
middle-class liberal college stu
dent."
5. Half-truth: The "censors"
did indeed keep Johnie from us
ing any profanity. Unfortunate
ly, the, censor was, as Johnie also
told me in August, Bob Fletcher,
who never was or will be a
Ram's Head Board Member.

• Sex Course Dropped
Editor, The Daily:
Last spring quarter Dr. B.
Otis Cobb of the Health Educa
tion Department taught his last
course at Stanford. The course
was "Marriage and the Family."
Now it seems that Stanford
is "streamlining" *its curricu
lum and that the course will dis
appear from Stanford after this
year, along with the phasing out
of the rest of the Health Educa
tion Department.
Dr. Cobb was a controversial
teacher. Many students thought
he delighted in flaunting "ob
scene" four-letter words. Some
students have called him a "dirty
old man" and a "pervert." But
he was not.
He was an interesting teacher
who made students think about
the quirks of sexual taboos in
our culture and who broadened
our viewpoints.
"Marriage and the Family,"
too, has been much maligned.
Just mention to your friends
that you're taking "Marriage
and the Family" and watch
their reactions, such as "Oh,
taking a mick" or "Looking for
3 easy units of A, huh?"
The Administration shares
this lack of regard for the course
as evidenced by its planning to
drop the course as well as the
department that offers it.
"Marriage and the Family,"
however, is a worthwhile course,
and most students would admit
they got something besides a
grade out of it. Students ask for
courses that are relevant to
relevant to them, and "Marriage
and the Family" is one of the
most relevant courses at Stan
ford.
The course awakes students
to the realities of an interper
sonal relationship such as mar
riage and discusses the family,
perhaps the most important
group in our tradition-lacking
and restless society. Probably no
other course approximates this
coverage.
But the University feels it
must move "forward," leaving

such a course behind. Perhaps
Stanford should ask itself "Quo
vadis?"

In light of the heated cam

would be of interest:

TIMOTHY GILL
• In Re Morley
Editor, The Daily:
Let me begin by saying that
I find it quite difficult to answer
Mr. Morley's letter to you of Oc
tober 24, for it is difficult to
decide what his position is.
There are, however, several
points which I can answer. The
first concerns just how many
that I, as Shop Steward in the
English Department, represent.
Presently, thirty-three Teaching
Assistants and three Acting In
structors (who also teach Fresh
man English at only a slightly
higher salary than the Teaching
Assistants do) are members of
the AFT Union.
In addition, four Teaching As
sistants have written letters to
Provost Lyman supporting us
In this matter of higher salaries.
As a result, we can say that I
represent forty (out of a pos

sible fifty-three) members of the
English Department staff in this
issue.
Secondly, I am glad that Mr.
Morley used the phrase "crea
ture comforts," for this is ex
actly what we are asking for:
enough money to live on in the
Bay Area. At present, we earn
$2,300 minus taxes ($200). We
are not asking for an exorbitant
amount of money (or to be able
to live in "style"), only enough
to raise our incomes to some
thing very slightly above the
poverty level.
As it stands now, we have to
borrow money for dental care,
for hospitalization insurance, for
car upkeep (and everyone would
agree that a car is a necessity
in this area), occasionally even
for food.
Also, I might point out that
we are people with the equiva
lents of M.A. degrees who per
form a valuable service for the
University, not only in terms of
leading class meetings but also
in the time we spend outside of
class with each student (in some
cases, this is more valuable than
contact in the classroom).
We are asking for a more
reasonable compensation for the
service we perform, and the Ad
ministration has acknowledged
that we deserve more. The ques
tion is where the money will
come from, and the present ne
gotiations are an attempt to de
cide not only where the money
will come from and if it avail

able, but also what priorities the
Administration uses when it dis
tributes money.
Thirdly, as to the political af
filiates of our Union. Mr. Mor
ley raised two points. As to the
first, our inherent support of
the A.F.T. in New York, I know
of no Union member who sup
ports their action; and our con
vention delegate is at present
working with the New Caucus
(a coalition of "radicals" and
blacks), which is going so far as
to counter-picket and to teach
freedom schools while the regu
lar schools are closed.
As to the second point, the
National A.F.T.'s support of
Humphrey, our local's dues are
not used as contributions to his
campaign (a separate founda
tion, COPE, which asks that
each local join it, makes the con
tributions). I would also ask Mr.
Morley who he would have the
National support. Nixon or Wal
lace?
Finally, let me say that we
will be glad to inform the Ad
ministration that Mr. Morley
does not wish to be considered
for a pay raise and is perhaps
even willing to take a cut in
salary.

• Racism In Union?
Editor, The Daily:
I take exception to Mr. Ed
ward F. Morley's off-the-cuff

attack of the members of New
York City's United Federation
of Teachers as members of a
"white racist union which has
been denying thousands of black
children a meaningful educa
tion in New York City."
I do not wish to enter into an
exhaustive analysis of that sad
dispute at this time, but I would
suggest that a further investi
gation of the facts would shed
more light on the subject. There
are many more things at stake
right now in New York City
than the school system.
President Shanker of the UFT
has accused Mayor Lindsay of
attempting to destroy the union.
The financial support of the
secessionist Ocean Hill-Browns
ville district is coming from
sources whose motives are ques
tionable. The future of labor
unions might very well be at
stake in New York City.
Can all unions remain strong
after one is destroyed? And to
call a union "racist" because it
is fighting for its very existence,
when that fight is not directed
against any minority, is com
pletely ridiculous.
Furthermore, if any act was
"racist" it was that of the school
district's governing board in
summarily dismissing instruc
tors (when they had no such
power) not on the basis of com
petence but merely because they
were white. This, and only this,
was the original cause of the
strike. Now it seems that the
issues have become far more in
volved and important. But does
such a history deserve Mr. Mor
ley's epithet "racist"?
In his all-encompassing state
ment Mr. Morley completely dis
misses these central issues in
the conflict, with an appeal to
unjustified and completely un
called-for smear tactics!
What I wish to address myself
to is just that smear. It seems
that many people are allowing
themselves the luxury of adding
flowery, parenthetical phrases to
their arguments in the hope that
such smears will support the
rest of their shaky position. It
has gotten to the point that no

discussion of any topic is com
plete without such empty words.
The phrases "low and order,"
"anarchists and nihilists," "im
perialism," and "white racism"
are choking communication to
the point that one cannot under
stand what anyone is saying.
How can anyone unite or get to
gether when all that one is asked
to unite under is a bag of cliches,
which mean little or nothing?
Lastly, to link the students in
the Stanford group with any oth
er union is absurd, since each
local has its own separate prob
lems. And to attempt to defame
the Stanford group by associat
ing them with another group
which has been foully and
wrongfully smeared is the very
height of irresponsibility!!

• TA Demand Unwise
Editor, The Daily:
Without commenting on the
other demands of the Political
Science TA's (the Daily, 17 Oc
tober), I wish to point out that
the demand of payment of $300
for each dependent of a TA is
extremely unwise. If Stanford
were to pay TA's some fixed
salary and in addition pay $300
for each dependent, the Univer
sity would in effect be reward
ing those TA's foolish enough to
have children that they could
not afford.
The folly of indiscriminate re
production is being realized by
an increasing number of in
formed people, due in part to the
presence of such excellent books
as Dr. Paul Ehrlich's The Pop
ulation Bomb (95c in paper
back). One has only to compare
the Peninsula of five years ago
with the Peninsula today to note
increased smog and traffic con
gestion and a decline in open
space and in park area per per
son.
Since the TA's seem content to
live under the archaic paternal
istic university system, they

mand that Stanford SUBTRACT
$300 for each dependent ( exclud
ing a spouse, which seems rea
sonable). The University should
not be put in the position of
making the population bomb tick

• Park-in Rejected
Editor, The Daily:
While I support the Grape
Boycott, I find the recent "park
in" unacceptable. To legislate
morality or the "recognition of
social responsibility" is difficult
enough. Nonlegislative coercion
of morality or recognition of so
cial responsibility can easily be
going too far.
Whatever the decision or jus
tification, such action becomes
the will of a minority impressed
upon the general public. If a
student objects to grape sales
and feels therefore he has the
right and obligation to physic
ally obstruct their sale, then the
Blue Max could find it within his
right and responsibility to phy
sically obstruct "communist"
book sales at Kepler's.
So many people have cooper
ated voluntarily with the Grape
Boycott. Why lose support from
those people who believe in free
dom of choice, choice to estab
lish a union and choice to buy
grapes, by making "Safeway

recognize their social responsi
bility"?

History
• Grape Myths
Editor, The Dally:
I wonder how many Stanford
students bothered to inform
themselves of the facts before
they voted to support the United
Farm Workers in the so-called
grape dispute. My husband and
I spent half the summer in De
lano to learn firsthand what is
happening. Here are the facts:
1. The grape worker portray
ed as a struggling, poor, and ex
ploited group is a myth. The
workers who are presently in
the fields have been harvesting
the crops formany years. Many
of the families live in and
around Delano, and for some of
them picking grapes is a sec
ond job within the family. For
the past two years these work
ers have endured insults, threats,
and general harrassment from
outsiders — demonstrators who
have never been in the fields.
2. Field workers have declared
they want no part of Chavez or
his union, so students who vote
to support the United Farm
Workers are not supporting
grape pickers at all.
3. The union wants "to get"
$1.65 for the workers. Grape
pickers are already receiving an
hourly wage of $1.50 plus a 25
cent bonus per box (three boxes
per hour minimum). I missed
out on the "new math," but that
adds up to a $2.25 minimum in
my book.
4. The farmer hires through a
crew boss, and the workers make
their demands of the farmer
through that same crew boss.
When the crop is ripe on the
vine, the crew has all the bar
gaining power in the world.
5. If the students are well
meaning, then certainly they are
misinformed, or are they merely
expousing a Cause — real or
myth — for the sake of "getting
involved." They are supporting
a boycott which has been de
clared illegal. If the boycott is
successful and grape growers
are forced to turn to mechanized
crops, what will become of the
workers? Whom will the union
attempt to organize then?

Certainly your stand on the

sponsibility in decisions of ap

not be disputed. But one must
take issue with the last sentence
of your Tuesday editorial. Your
redoubtable passion for academ

sulted in that same blindness
that you state cripples the Gov

Whatever may be your view
of the Director of the Hoover

show a blind and incredibly
prejudiced attitude in condemn
ing the Institution in toto by as
serting that it is "already a
blight on the Stanford name."
The Hoover Institution is inter

Your complete (and deliber

Editor, The DAILY:
In reading the account of Fa

caught by his question as quot
ed by your reporter: "Would the
Jewish prosecutor have prose
cuted the nine of us in Germany
during World War II for burn
ing one of Hitler's draft files?"
This question it seems to me
is selfdefeating since no Jews
occupied responsible positions in
Hitler's Germany during World
War 11. They were either dead,
in concentration camps, in hid

that Father Berrigan weakens
his case by drawing erroneous

• Errors On May field
Editor, THE DAILY
In the article "Mayfield Resur
rected for Housing" four struc
tural deficiencies were incorrect
ly reported:
1. Poor heating system—four
new 4,000 watt fan forced ther
mostatically controlled electrical
heaters were installed on the
third floor of Mayfield House
and the existing heating system
is being thoroughly checked and
repaired.
2. Condemned kitchen—the old
ATO kitchen was not con
demned by the County of Santa
Clara Health Department. The
kitchen was not opened because
of the large renovation cost to
raise the kitchen to a standard
equivalent to other university
residences and because of the
large operating losses incurred
when operating a kitchen serv
ing 40 residents. Instead, a food
service program was initiated
with Roth and Guthrie Houses.
3. Faulty wiring—all wiring,
fixtures and appliances are in
stalled in accordance with the
State of California Electrical
Safety Orders and certified to
the county of Santa Clara Fire
Marshal's office by a licensed

4. Wooden fire escape — the

• Olympic Protest
Editor, The Dally:
I wish to reply to the support
you gave Tommy Smith and
John Carlos in the recent pro
test during the Olympic award
ceremonies. It is difficult to de
termine from the article "Track
Power" whether you justify the
protest on grounds that Hitler
oriented the Games correctly,
that they should be used for po
litical demonstration, or that
such use, although deplorable,
exists in some forms, and that,
therefore, the Olympic Commit
tees should allow it in any form.
The former attitude would, I
believe, be the demise of the
Olympic Games — the athletic
competition would dissolve amid
the acidity of the countless num
ber of bitter political struggles
which continually seethe; such
an attitude would condone Czech
demonstrations against the So
viets, Biaffran against Federalist
Nigeria, Pakistani against India,
Arab against Jew. The Olympic
Games in such an atmosphere
would no longer exist as an
athletic competition.
True, that underlying the
Games is a quite discernable
current of political rivalry, but
to support a perpetration of
wrong simply on the grounds of
its existence has no rational
basis whatsoever and would con
demn any human institution re
gardless of the amount of posi
tive good it was accomplishing.
The simple fact that one
agrees with the cause being
furthered has no bearing on the
legitimacy of its expression, and
support of Tommy Smith and
John Carlos would also affirm
the right to raise a white glove
and demonstrate hideously for
an all-white America. I despise
the latter and because of it, do
not wish to see the former; I
think the Olympic Games are
worth saving from the political
beast which constantly tries to
devour them.

In a recent Dally Miss Marta

I think it is appropriate for
me to clarify what our practice
is in this regard. In Memorial

official registration materials are
distributed to new students and
continuing students. Official stu
dent organizations and depart

seeing to it that only official or

ed six to eight years ago, sup
erseding an earlier situation in
which from fifteen to thirty
representatives or organizations
would be handing out things
separately.
This arrangement was orgin

this practice reviewed with rep

• KZSU Policy
Editor, The Dally:
In reference to a recent front
page article, "Cleaver's Speech
Sparks New KZSU Liberaliza
tion," there are several mis-lead
ing statements which, I believe,
require immediate clarification.
1) The "new" policy can hard
ly be termed a liberalization over
KZSU's past policy. Since 1964,
KZSU has permitted and en
couraged the broadcasting of all
shades of opinion, from George
Lincoln Rockwell's speech on
Negro inferiority to last spring's
series on Racism in America.
2) Having authored this
"new" policy, J. can assure you
that the statement "any pro
gram, regardless of content, will
be permitted on the air" is quite
false. There are a number of
restrictions on profanity, libel,
slander, and most importantly,
on requiring responsible spokes
men.
KZSU will censor no one for
his views, but neither will the
station become the mouthpiece
of every student, faculty or staff
member who wants to hear his
own voice. KZSU's "new" policy
is an improvement, if for no
other reason than the fact that
it puts in writing what has been
verbally "accepted" for years.
The station will have complete
copies of this policy available
soon for those interested. I
would hope that before anyone
"demands" a show on KZSU,
they take the time to read the
requirements they must meet.

KZSU Prog. Director
• Health History
Editor, THE DAILY:
As the architect of the Stan

ford Student Health Service, I
am interested in the comments
in the box in the Daily. It might
help to "look at the record." It
might also help to correct some
mis-apprehensions which are in
the mind of the writer of the
editorial.
In 1946 when the health ser
vice was started, Stanford was
faced with a crisis. The health
service—one man only — was
swamped. The return of the sol
diers skyrocketed enrollments.
The shortage of doctors was
acute. Up to this time a sick
student found a doctor —if he
could—got treatment —good or
bad (the student could not judge
which) and paid whatever this
doctor chose to charge.
Stanford approached me in
some desperation to see if the
Palo Alto Clinic could help. We
worked out the details of the
health service—simply that the
University would pay the Clinic
a capitation fee (i.e. so much
per head) and the Clinic would
maintain an infirmary and give
the students complete compre
hensive care. The University
undertook to self insure for the
hospital bills.
I can say positively that for
twenty-two years the students
of Stanford have had superb
care under this arrangement.
There has been a doctor or doc
tors available every hour, day
and night, Sundays and holi
days, school days and vacations.
And during this whole period
there have been no medical ca
tastrophes except the regretta
ble, inevitable, and unprevent
able suicides. There has been no
instance of serious neglect or
lack of skill. The price the Uni
versity has paid by all insurance
standards has been ridiculously
low — particularly when there
are no deductibles, no co-insur
ance, and no reservations except
pregnancy and long time psy
chosis.
During this period the cost to
the Clinic of the services ren
dered has exceeded the amount
paid by an average of $44,621 a
year or a total for the twenty
one years ending in 1967 of
$936,441. Almost a million dol
lars in supplies and services
have been contributed by the
Clinic to the Stanford Student
Body. This fact is not mentioned.
The proposal that the medical
school take over the health ser
vice is not original with you. It
has been discussed and exam
ined in great detail. The answer
is simply that with their present
personnel whose time is com
pletely taken up with teaching
and research they cannot do it.
It is possible that the health
service might be staffed with
medical students and interns.
I do not believe the Stanford
students who have had free ac
cess to all the mature specialists
in one of the greatest medical
clinics in the country would like
this. If the medical school takes
on this task, they would have
to hire doctors hopefully of the
competence of the clinic doctors
to do the work.
The faculty can't do it in their
spare time. And the situation of

shortage of doctors is such that
they simply cannot get such
men. The privilege of Clinic as
sociation which is highly valued
makes it possible for the health
service to be staffed by highly
skilled men. And, of course, all
the one hundred thirty doctors
in the Clinic are available to
students who need them.
Apparently the writer of the
editorial does not understand
that the Clinic does not profit
when more students are referred
to it. The idea of stationing a
fulltime orthopedist at Cowell is
silly. No orthopedist of sufficient
competence to be worthy to care
for the students would accept
such an assignment.
In summary — the Stanford
students have had superb care
for twenty-one years under the
present arrangement. The price
is very low as attested by the
million dollar deficit the Clinic
has incurred in the twenty years
it has been involved. No alterna
tive arrangement would make
available such competence at
such a price. The withdrawal of
the University from furnishing
hospital care has nothing to do
with the Clinic agreement but
is a matter between the students
and the school.
As a matter of fact it was
found that many of the students
were already covered (as are al
most seventy-five percent of all
people) by private insurance for
hospitalization and the Univer
sity's coverage just gave double
coverage and helped the insur
ance companies.
A great single group coverage
for all students deserves some
consideration. In closing it
would be in the interests of good
journalism if the editor had con
sulted with people who know
the facts and the background.

• Scott On Gaieties
Editor, The Daily:
Johnie Scotts' column, like any
other great piece of propoganda,
has, on a quick reading, at least
one each of: grains of truth, un
truths, half-truths, and distor
tions.
1. Grain of truth: We are not
producing the show.
2. Untruth: "Among the state
ments floating around the room
— 'Why, this play is racist and
immoral,' 'Uh, uh, you know we
can't have a play with more
blacks than whites in it!' " Those
statements were uttered at a
meeting with erstwhile director
Bob Fletcher early in August,
with clear sarcasm, by a design
er. It was Fletcher, Johnie's
White Sidekick, who reported
the remarks, removed the sar
casm, and placed them at the
September 23 meeting, where
the subject was never mentioned
by anybody.
3. Untruth: "... the deci
sion by the Board not to do the
script." At the September 23
meeting, Bob Fletcher proposed
a set of physically impossible
requirements for doing the show,
proceeded to admit that they
were impossible, and went on to

say that he would not do the
show anyway.
4. Distortion: "Black art . . .
cannot enter the System normal
ly ... " Black art probably
could have entered "the Sys
tem" normally. Unfortunately, as
Johnie admitted to me when I
discussed the play with him in
August, his play "sounded as if
it had been written by a white
middle-class liberal college stu
dent."
5. Half-truth: The "censors"
did indeed keep Johnie from us
ing any profanity. Unfortunate
ly, the, censor was, as Johnie also
told me in August, Bob Fletcher,
who never was or will be a
Ram's Head Board Member.

• Sex Course Dropped
Editor, The Daily:
Last spring quarter Dr. B.
Otis Cobb of the Health Educa
tion Department taught his last
course at Stanford. The course
was "Marriage and the Family."
Now it seems that Stanford
is "streamlining" *its curricu
lum and that the course will dis
appear from Stanford after this
year, along with the phasing out
of the rest of the Health Educa
tion Department.
Dr. Cobb was a controversial
teacher. Many students thought
he delighted in flaunting "ob
scene" four-letter words. Some
students have called him a "dirty
old man" and a "pervert." But
he was not.
He was an interesting teacher
who made students think about
the quirks of sexual taboos in
our culture and who broadened
our viewpoints.
"Marriage and the Family,"
too, has been much maligned.
Just mention to your friends
that you're taking "Marriage
and the Family" and watch
their reactions, such as "Oh,
taking a mick" or "Looking for
3 easy units of A, huh?"
The Administration shares
this lack of regard for the course
as evidenced by its planning to
drop the course as well as the
department that offers it.
"Marriage and the Family,"
however, is a worthwhile course,
and most students would admit
they got something besides a
grade out of it. Students ask for
courses that are relevant to
relevant to them, and "Marriage
and the Family" is one of the
most relevant courses at Stan
ford.
The course awakes students
to the realities of an interper
sonal relationship such as mar
riage and discusses the family,
perhaps the most important
group in our tradition-lacking
and restless society. Probably no
other course approximates this
coverage.
But the University feels it
must move "forward," leaving

such a course behind. Perhaps
Stanford should ask itself "Quo
vadis?"

In light of the heated cam

one of the major campaign is

would be of interest:
"The streets of our coun

rebelling and rioting. Commu
nists are seeking to destroy
our country. Russia Is threat
ening us with her might, and

"Yes, without law and or

TIMOTHY GILL
• In Re Morley
Editor, The Daily:
Let me begin by saying that
I find it quite difficult to answer
Mr. Morley's letter to you of Oc
tober 24, for it is difficult to
decide what his position is.
There are, however, several
points which I can answer. The
first concerns just how many
that I, as Shop Steward in the
English Department, represent.
Presently, thirty-three Teaching
Assistants and three Acting In
structors (who also teach Fresh
man English at only a slightly
higher salary than the Teaching
Assistants do) are members of
the AFT Union.
In addition, four Teaching As
sistants have written letters to
Provost Lyman supporting us
In this matter of higher salaries.
As a result, we can say that I
represent forty (out of a pos

sible fifty-three) members of the
English Department staff in this
issue.
Secondly, I am glad that Mr.
Morley used the phrase "crea
ture comforts," for this is ex
actly what we are asking for:
enough money to live on in the
Bay Area. At present, we earn
$2,300 minus taxes ($200). We
are not asking for an exorbitant
amount of money (or to be able
to live in "style"), only enough
to raise our incomes to some
thing very slightly above the
poverty level.
As it stands now, we have to
borrow money for dental care,
for hospitalization insurance, for
car upkeep (and everyone would
agree that a car is a necessity
in this area), occasionally even
for food.
Also, I might point out that
we are people with the equiva
lents of M.A. degrees who per
form a valuable service for the
University, not only in terms of
leading class meetings but also
in the time we spend outside of
class with each student (in some
cases, this is more valuable than
contact in the classroom).
We are asking for a more
reasonable compensation for the
service we perform, and the Ad
ministration has acknowledged
that we deserve more. The ques
tion is where the money will
come from, and the present ne
gotiations are an attempt to de
cide not only where the money
will come from and if it avail

able, but also what priorities the
Administration uses when it dis
tributes money.
Thirdly, as to the political af
filiates of our Union. Mr. Mor
ley raised two points. As to the
first, our inherent support of
the A.F.T. in New York, I know
of no Union member who sup
ports their action; and our con
vention delegate is at present
working with the New Caucus
(a coalition of "radicals" and
blacks), which is going so far as
to counter-picket and to teach
freedom schools while the regu
lar schools are closed.
As to the second point, the
National A.F.T.'s support of
Humphrey, our local's dues are
not used as contributions to his
campaign (a separate founda
tion, COPE, which asks that
each local join it, makes the con
tributions). I would also ask Mr.
Morley who he would have the
National support. Nixon or Wal
lace?
Finally, let me say that we
will be glad to inform the Ad
ministration that Mr. Morley
does not wish to be considered
for a pay raise and is perhaps
even willing to take a cut in
salary.

• Racism In Union?
Editor, The Daily:
I take exception to Mr. Ed
ward F. Morley's off-the-cuff

attack of the members of New
York City's United Federation
of Teachers as members of a
"white racist union which has
been denying thousands of black
children a meaningful educa
tion in New York City."
I do not wish to enter into an
exhaustive analysis of that sad
dispute at this time, but I would
suggest that a further investi
gation of the facts would shed
more light on the subject. There
are many more things at stake
right now in New York City
than the school system.
President Shanker of the UFT
has accused Mayor Lindsay of
attempting to destroy the union.
The financial support of the
secessionist Ocean Hill-Browns
ville district is coming from
sources whose motives are ques
tionable. The future of labor
unions might very well be at
stake in New York City.
Can all unions remain strong
after one is destroyed? And to
call a union "racist" because it
is fighting for its very existence,
when that fight is not directed
against any minority, is com
pletely ridiculous.
Furthermore, if any act was
"racist" it was that of the school
district's governing board in
summarily dismissing instruc
tors (when they had no such
power) not on the basis of com
petence but merely because they
were white. This, and only this,
was the original cause of the
strike. Now it seems that the
issues have become far more in
volved and important. But does
such a history deserve Mr. Mor
ley's epithet "racist"?
In his all-encompassing state
ment Mr. Morley completely dis
misses these central issues in
the conflict, with an appeal to
unjustified and completely un
called-for smear tactics!
What I wish to address myself
to is just that smear. It seems
that many people are allowing
themselves the luxury of adding
flowery, parenthetical phrases to
their arguments in the hope that
such smears will support the
rest of their shaky position. It
has gotten to the point that no

discussion of any topic is com
plete without such empty words.
The phrases "low and order,"
"anarchists and nihilists," "im
perialism," and "white racism"
are choking communication to
the point that one cannot under
stand what anyone is saying.
How can anyone unite or get to
gether when all that one is asked
to unite under is a bag of cliches,
which mean little or nothing?
Lastly, to link the students in
the Stanford group with any oth
er union is absurd, since each
local has its own separate prob
lems. And to attempt to defame
the Stanford group by associat
ing them with another group
which has been foully and
wrongfully smeared is the very
height of irresponsibility!!

• TA Demand Unwise
Editor, The Daily:
Without commenting on the
other demands of the Political
Science TA's (the Daily, 17 Oc
tober), I wish to point out that
the demand of payment of $300
for each dependent of a TA is
extremely unwise. If Stanford
were to pay TA's some fixed
salary and in addition pay $300
for each dependent, the Univer
sity would in effect be reward
ing those TA's foolish enough to
have children that they could
not afford.
The folly of indiscriminate re
production is being realized by
an increasing number of in
formed people, due in part to the
presence of such excellent books
as Dr. Paul Ehrlich's The Pop
ulation Bomb (95c in paper
back). One has only to compare
the Peninsula of five years ago
with the Peninsula today to note
increased smog and traffic con
gestion and a decline in open
space and in park area per per
son.
Since the TA's seem content to
live under the archaic paternal
istic university system, they
should act responsibly and de
mand that Stanford SUBTRACT
$300 for each dependent ( exclud
ing a spouse, which seems rea
sonable). The University should
not be put in the position of
making the population bomb tick
faster.

History
• Grape Myths
Editor, The Dally:
I wonder how many Stanford
students bothered to inform
themselves of the facts before
they voted to support the United
Farm Workers in the so-called
grape dispute. My husband and
I spent half the summer in De
lano to learn firsthand what is
happening. Here are the facts:
1. The grape worker portray
ed as a struggling, poor, and ex
ploited group is a myth. The
workers who are presently in
the fields have been harvesting
the crops formany years. Many
of the families live in and
around Delano, and for some of
them picking grapes is a sec
ond job within the family. For
the past two years these work
ers have endured insults, threats,
and general harrassment from
outsiders — demonstrators who
have never been in the fields.
2. Field workers have declared
they want no part of Chavez or
his union, so students who vote
to support the United Farm
Workers are not supporting
grape pickers at all.
3. The union wants "to get"
$1.65 for the workers. Grape
pickers are already receiving an
hourly wage of $1.50 plus a 25
cent bonus per box (three boxes
per hour minimum). I missed
out on the "new math," but that
adds up to a $2.25 minimum in
my book.
4. The farmer hires through a
crew boss, and the workers make
their demands of the farmer
through that same crew boss.
When the crop is ripe on the
vine, the crew has all the bar
gaining power in the world.
5. If the students are well
meaning, then certainly they are
misinformed, or are they merely
expousing a Cause — real or
myth — for the sake of "getting
involved." They are supporting
a boycott which has been de
clared illegal. If the boycott is
successful and grape growers
are forced to turn to mechanized
crops, what will become of the
workers? Whom will the union
attempt to organize then?

• Campbell & Hoover
Editor, THE DAILY
Certainly your stand on the
UC faculty's right to and re
sponsibility in decisions of ap
pointment and government can
not be disputed. But one must
take issue with the last sentence
of your Tuesday editorial. Your
redoubtable passion for academ
ic freedom has seemingly re
sulted in that same blindness
that you state cripples the Gov
ernor and his followers.
Whatever may be your view
of the Director of the Hoover
Institution as a UC Regent, you
show a blind and incredibly
prejudiced attitude in condemn
ing the Institution in toto by as
serting that it is "already a
blight on the Stanford name."
The Hoover Institution is inter
nationally acknowledged as one
of the world's most outstanding
research libraries.
Your complete (and deliber
ate?) disregard of its nopoliti
cal contributions, of its funda
mental value to students and
scholars the world over, mani
fests an intellectual blindness
that is unworthy of you. Do
you know what resoruces the
Hoover Institution houses?
The Hoover Institution is un
doubtedly resigned to the Daily's
periodic anti-Hoover Institution
binge. But your edtiorial also
makes an assault that is, I be
lieve, new to its pages by label
ing Reagan a Don Quixote. This
is an unwarranted and shocking
affront to the name of Miguel
de Cervantes and to his most

famous creation. Reagan roman
tic, idealistic, chivalrous! Have
you ever read Don Quixote?

• Erroneous Parallels
Editor, The DAILY:
In reading the account of Fa
ther Berrigan's talk, my eye was
caught by his question as quot
ed by your reporter: "Would the
Jewish prosecutor have prose
cuted the nine of us in Germany
during World War II for burn
ing one of Hitler's draft files?"
This question it seems to me
is selfdefeating since no Jews
occupied responsible positions in
Hitler's Germany during World
War 11. They were either dead,
in concentration camps, in hid
ing, or refugees. It seems to me
that Father Berrigan weakens
his case by drawing erroneous
historical parallels.

• Errors On May field
Editor, THE DAILY
In the article "Mayfield Resur
rected for Housing" four struc
tural deficiencies were incorrect
ly reported:
1. Poor heating system—four
new 4,000 watt fan forced ther
mostatically controlled electrical
heaters were installed on the
third floor of Mayfield House
and the existing heating system
is being thoroughly checked and
repaired.
2. Condemned kitchen—the old
ATO kitchen was not con
demned by the County of Santa
Clara Health Department. The
kitchen was not opened because
of the large renovation cost to
raise the kitchen to a standard
equivalent to other university
residences and because of the
large operating losses incurred
when operating a kitchen serv
ing 40 residents. Instead, a food
service program was initiated
with Roth and Guthrie Houses.
3. Faulty wiring—all wiring,
fixtures and appliances are in
stalled in accordance with the
State of California Electrical
Safety Orders and certified to
the county of Santa Clara Fire
Marshal's office by a licensed
electrical contractor.
4. Wooden fire escape — the
fire escape was constructed in
accordance with the State of
California Administration Code,
Title 19 (State Fire Marshal's
Regulations).

• Olympic Protest
Editor, The Dally:
I wish to reply to the support
you gave Tommy Smith and
John Carlos in the recent pro
test during the Olympic award
ceremonies. It is difficult to de
termine from the article "Track
Power" whether you justify the
protest on grounds that Hitler
oriented the Games correctly,
that they should be used for po
litical demonstration, or that
such use, although deplorable,
exists in some forms, and that,
therefore, the Olympic Commit
tees should allow it in any form.
The former attitude would, I
believe, be the demise of the
Olympic Games — the athletic
competition would dissolve amid
the acidity of the countless num
ber of bitter political struggles
which continually seethe; such
an attitude would condone Czech
demonstrations against the So
viets, Biaffran against Federalist
Nigeria, Pakistani against India,
Arab against Jew. The Olympic
Games in such an atmosphere
would no longer exist as an
athletic competition.
True, that underlying the
Games is a quite discernable
current of political rivalry, but
to support a perpetration of
wrong simply on the grounds of
its existence has no rational
basis whatsoever and would con
demn any human institution re
gardless of the amount of posi
tive good it was accomplishing.
The simple fact that one
agrees with the cause being
furthered has no bearing on the
legitimacy of its expression, and
support of Tommy Smith and
John Carlos would also affirm
the right to raise a white glove
and demonstrate hideously for
an all-white America. I despise
the latter and because of it, do
not wish to see the former; I
think the Olympic Games are
worth saving from the political
beast which constantly tries to
devour them.

Editor, The Daily:
In a recent Dally Miss Marta
Mahoney objected to some ma
terials which were handed out
at the doors of Memorial Audi
torium at registration time.
I think it is appropriate for
me to clarify what our practice
is in this regard. In Memorial
Auditorium the official registra
tion materials and nothing but
official registration materials are
distributed to new students and
continuing students. Official stu
dent organizations and depart
ments of the University are per
mitted to insert materials in a
packet which is distributed to
students as they enter Memorial
Auditorium.
The Student Financial Man
ager is in general charge of
seeing to it that only official or
ganizations do insert materials,
and Alpha Phi Omega coordi
nates putting the packets togeth
er. This practice was inaugurat
ed six to eight years ago, sup
erseding an earlier situation in
which from fifteen to thirty
representatives or organizations
would be handing out things
separately.
This arrangement was orgin
ally worked out with the then
responsible student representa
tives. Our office is ready to have
this practice reviewed with rep
resentatives of students, faculty,
and members of the administra
tion at any time.

• KZSU Policy
Editor, The Dally:
In reference to a recent front
page article, "Cleaver's Speech
Sparks New KZSU Liberaliza
tion," there are several mis-lead
ing statements which, I believe,
require immediate clarification.
1) The "new" policy can hard
ly be termed a liberalization over
KZSU's past policy. Since 1964,
KZSU has permitted and en
couraged the broadcasting of all
shades of opinion, from George
Lincoln Rockwell's speech on
Negro inferiority to last spring's
series on Racism in America.
2) Having authored this
"new" policy, J. can assure you
that the statement "any pro
gram, regardless of content, will
be permitted on the air" is quite
false. There are a number of
restrictions on profanity, libel,
slander, and most importantly,
on requiring responsible spokes
men.
KZSU will censor no one for
his views, but neither will the
station become the mouthpiece
of every student, faculty or staff
member who wants to hear his
own voice. KZSU's "new" policy
is an improvement, if for no
other reason than the fact that
it puts in writing what has been
verbally "accepted" for years.
The station will have complete
copies of this policy available
soon for those interested. I
would hope that before anyone
"demands" a show on KZSU,
they take the time to read the
requirements they must meet.

• Health History
Editor, THE DAILY:
As the architect of the Stan

ford Student Health Service, I
am interested in the comments
in the box in the Daily. It might
help to "look at the record." It
might also help to correct some
mis-apprehensions which are in
the mind of the writer of the
editorial.
In 1946 when the health ser
vice was started, Stanford was
faced with a crisis. The health
service—one man only — was
swamped. The return of the sol
diers skyrocketed enrollments.
The shortage of doctors was
acute. Up to this time a sick
student found a doctor —if he
could—got treatment —good or
bad (the student could not judge
which) and paid whatever this
doctor chose to charge.
Stanford approached me in
some desperation to see if the
Palo Alto Clinic could help. We
worked out the details of the
health service—simply that the
University would pay the Clinic
a capitation fee (i.e. so much
per head) and the Clinic would
maintain an infirmary and give
the students complete compre
hensive care. The University
undertook to self insure for the
hospital bills.
I can say positively that for
twenty-two years the students
of Stanford have had superb
care under this arrangement.
There has been a doctor or doc
tors available every hour, day
and night, Sundays and holi
days, school days and vacations.
And during this whole period
there have been no medical ca
tastrophes except the regretta
ble, inevitable, and unprevent
able suicides. There has been no
instance of serious neglect or
lack of skill. The price the Uni
versity has paid by all insurance
standards has been ridiculously
low — particularly when there
are no deductibles, no co-insur
ance, and no reservations except
pregnancy and long time psy
chosis.
During this period the cost to
the Clinic of the services ren
dered has exceeded the amount
paid by an average of $44,621 a
year or a total for the twenty
one years ending in 1967 of
$936,441. Almost a million dol
lars in supplies and services
have been contributed by the
Clinic to the Stanford Student
Body. This fact is not mentioned.
The proposal that the medical
school take over the health ser
vice is not original with you. It
has been discussed and exam
ined in great detail. The answer
is simply that with their present
personnel whose time is com
pletely taken up with teaching
and research they cannot do it.
It is possible that the health
service might be staffed with
medical students and interns.
I do not believe the Stanford
students who have had free ac
cess to all the mature specialists
in one of the greatest medical
clinics in the country would like
this. If the medical school takes
on this task, they would have
to hire doctors hopefully of the
competence of the clinic doctors
to do the work.
The faculty can't do it in their
spare time. And the situation of

shortage of doctors is such that
they simply cannot get such
men. The privilege of Clinic as
sociation which is highly valued
makes it possible for the health
service to be staffed by highly
skilled men. And, of course, all
the one hundred thirty doctors
in the Clinic are available to
students who need them.
Apparently the writer of the
editorial does not understand
that the Clinic does not profit
when more students are referred
to it. The idea of stationing a
fulltime orthopedist at Cowell is
silly. No orthopedist of sufficient
competence to be worthy to care
for the students would accept
such an assignment.
In summary — the Stanford
students have had superb care
for twenty-one years under the
present arrangement. The price
is very low as attested by the
million dollar deficit the Clinic
has incurred in the twenty years
it has been involved. No alterna
tive arrangement would make
available such competence at
such a price. The withdrawal of
the University from furnishing
hospital care has nothing to do
with the Clinic agreement but
is a matter between the students
and the school.
As a matter of fact it was
found that many of the students
were already covered (as are al
most seventy-five percent of all
people) by private insurance for
hospitalization and the Univer
sity's coverage just gave double
coverage and helped the insur
ance companies.
A great single group coverage
for all students deserves some
consideration. In closing it
would be in the interests of good
journalism if the editor had con
sulted with people who know
the facts and the background.

• Scott On Gaieties
Editor, The Daily:
Johnie Scotts' column, like any
other great piece of propoganda,
has, on a quick reading, at least
one each of: grains of truth, un
truths, half-truths, and distor
tions.
1. Grain of truth: We are not
producing the show.
2. Untruth: "Among the state
ments floating around the room
— 'Why, this play is racist and
immoral,' 'Uh, uh, you know we
can't have a play with more
blacks than whites in it!' " Those
statements were uttered at a
meeting with erstwhile director
Bob Fletcher early in August,
with clear sarcasm, by a design
er. It was Fletcher, Johnie's
White Sidekick, who reported
the remarks, removed the sar
casm, and placed them at the
September 23 meeting, where
the subject was never mentioned
by anybody.
3. Untruth: "... the deci
sion by the Board not to do the
script." At the September 23
meeting, Bob Fletcher proposed
a set of physically impossible
requirements for doing the show,
proceeded to admit that they
were impossible, and went on to

say that he would not do the
show anyway.
4. Distortion: "Black art . . .
cannot enter the System normal
ly ... " Black art probably
could have entered "the Sys
tem" normally. Unfortunately, as
Johnie admitted to me when I
discussed the play with him in
August, his play "sounded as if
it had been written by a white
middle-class liberal college stu
dent."
5. Half-truth: The "censors"
did indeed keep Johnie from us
ing any profanity. Unfortunate
ly, the, censor was, as Johnie also
told me in August, Bob Fletcher,
who never was or will be a
Ram's Head Board Member.

• Sex Course Dropped
Editor, The Daily:
Last spring quarter Dr. B.
Otis Cobb of the Health Educa
tion Department taught his last
course at Stanford. The course
was "Marriage and the Family."
Now it seems that Stanford
is "streamlining" *its curricu
lum and that the course will dis
appear from Stanford after this
year, along with the phasing out
of the rest of the Health Educa
tion Department.
Dr. Cobb was a controversial
teacher. Many students thought
he delighted in flaunting "ob
scene" four-letter words. Some
students have called him a "dirty
old man" and a "pervert." But
he was not.
He was an interesting teacher
who made students think about
the quirks of sexual taboos in
our culture and who broadened
our viewpoints.
"Marriage and the Family,"
too, has been much maligned.
Just mention to your friends
that you're taking "Marriage
and the Family" and watch
their reactions, such as "Oh,
taking a mick" or "Looking for
3 easy units of A, huh?"
The Administration shares
this lack of regard for the course
as evidenced by its planning to
drop the course as well as the
department that offers it.
"Marriage and the Family,"
however, is a worthwhile course,
and most students would admit
they got something besides a
grade out of it. Students ask for
courses that are relevant to
relevant to them, and "Marriage
and the Family" is one of the
most relevant courses at Stan
ford.
The course awakes students
to the realities of an interper
sonal relationship such as mar
riage and discusses the family,
perhaps the most important
group in our tradition-lacking
and restless society. Probably no
other course approximates this
coverage.
But the University feels it
must move "forward," leaving

such a course behind. Perhaps
Stanford should ask itself "Quo
vadis?"

Editor, The DAILY:
In light of the heated cam
paign that we have witnessed
during the past months, and of
one of the major campaign is
sues that have been thrown
around, I thought the following
would be of interest:
"The streets of our coun
try are in turmoil. The univer
sities are filled with students
rebelling and rioting. Commu
nists are seeking to destroy
our country. Russia Is threat
ening us with her might, and
the Republic is in danger.
"Yes, danger from within
and from without. We need
law and order.
"Yes, without law and or
der, our nation cannot survive.
We are laughed at by other
nations because of the disor
der in our streets caused by
the students and the Commu

"Elect us, and we, we shall

shall by law and order be re
