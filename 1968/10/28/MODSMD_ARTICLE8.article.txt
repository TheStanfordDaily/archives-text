• In Re Morley
Editor, The Daily:
Let me begin by saying that
I find it quite difficult to answer
Mr. Morley's letter to you of Oc
tober 24, for it is difficult to
decide what his position is.
There are, however, several
points which I can answer. The
first concerns just how many
that I, as Shop Steward in the
English Department, represent.
Presently, thirty-three Teaching
Assistants and three Acting In
structors (who also teach Fresh
man English at only a slightly
higher salary than the Teaching
Assistants do) are members of
the AFT Union.
In addition, four Teaching As
sistants have written letters to
Provost Lyman supporting us
In this matter of higher salaries.
As a result, we can say that I
represent forty (out of a pos

sible fifty-three) members of the
English Department staff in this
issue.
Secondly, I am glad that Mr.
Morley used the phrase "crea
ture comforts," for this is ex
actly what we are asking for:
enough money to live on in the
Bay Area. At present, we earn
$2,300 minus taxes ($200). We
are not asking for an exorbitant
amount of money (or to be able
to live in "style"), only enough
to raise our incomes to some
thing very slightly above the
poverty level.
As it stands now, we have to
borrow money for dental care,
for hospitalization insurance, for
car upkeep (and everyone would
agree that a car is a necessity
in this area), occasionally even
for food.
Also, I might point out that
we are people with the equiva
lents of M.A. degrees who per
form a valuable service for the
University, not only in terms of
leading class meetings but also
in the time we spend outside of
class with each student (in some
cases, this is more valuable than
contact in the classroom).
We are asking for a more
reasonable compensation for the
service we perform, and the Ad
ministration has acknowledged
that we deserve more. The ques
tion is where the money will
come from, and the present ne
gotiations are an attempt to de
cide not only where the money
will come from and if it avail

able, but also what priorities the
Administration uses when it dis
tributes money.
Thirdly, as to the political af
filiates of our Union. Mr. Mor
ley raised two points. As to the
first, our inherent support of
the A.F.T. in New York, I know
of no Union member who sup
ports their action; and our con
vention delegate is at present
working with the New Caucus
(a coalition of "radicals" and
blacks), which is going so far as
to counter-picket and to teach
freedom schools while the regu
lar schools are closed.
As to the second point, the
National A.F.T.'s support of
Humphrey, our local's dues are
not used as contributions to his
campaign (a separate founda
tion, COPE, which asks that
each local join it, makes the con
tributions). I would also ask Mr.
Morley who he would have the
National support. Nixon or Wal
lace?
Finally, let me say that we
will be glad to inform the Ad
ministration that Mr. Morley
does not wish to be considered
for a pay raise and is perhaps
even willing to take a cut in
salary.

• Racism In Union?
Editor, The Daily:
I take exception to Mr. Ed
ward F. Morley's off-the-cuff

attack of the members of New
York City's United Federation
of Teachers as members of a
"white racist union which has
been denying thousands of black
children a meaningful educa
tion in New York City."
I do not wish to enter into an
exhaustive analysis of that sad
dispute at this time, but I would
suggest that a further investi
gation of the facts would shed
more light on the subject. There
are many more things at stake
right now in New York City
than the school system.
President Shanker of the UFT
has accused Mayor Lindsay of
attempting to destroy the union.
The financial support of the
secessionist Ocean Hill-Browns
ville district is coming from
sources whose motives are ques
tionable. The future of labor
unions might very well be at
stake in New York City.
Can all unions remain strong
after one is destroyed? And to
call a union "racist" because it
is fighting for its very existence,
when that fight is not directed
against any minority, is com
pletely ridiculous.
Furthermore, if any act was
"racist" it was that of the school
district's governing board in
summarily dismissing instruc
tors (when they had no such
power) not on the basis of com
petence but merely because they
were white. This, and only this,
was the original cause of the
strike. Now it seems that the
issues have become far more in
volved and important. But does
such a history deserve Mr. Mor
ley's epithet "racist"?
In his all-encompassing state
ment Mr. Morley completely dis
misses these central issues in
the conflict, with an appeal to
unjustified and completely un
called-for smear tactics!
What I wish to address myself
to is just that smear. It seems
that many people are allowing
themselves the luxury of adding
flowery, parenthetical phrases to
their arguments in the hope that
such smears will support the
rest of their shaky position. It
has gotten to the point that no

discussion of any topic is com
plete without such empty words.
The phrases "low and order,"
"anarchists and nihilists," "im
perialism," and "white racism"
are choking communication to
the point that one cannot under
stand what anyone is saying.
How can anyone unite or get to
gether when all that one is asked
to unite under is a bag of cliches,
which mean little or nothing?
Lastly, to link the students in
the Stanford group with any oth
er union is absurd, since each
local has its own separate prob
lems. And to attempt to defame
the Stanford group by associat
ing them with another group
which has been foully and
wrongfully smeared is the very
height of irresponsibility!!

• TA Demand Unwise
Editor, The Daily:
Without commenting on the
other demands of the Political
Science TA's (the Daily, 17 Oc
tober), I wish to point out that
the demand of payment of $300
for each dependent of a TA is
extremely unwise. If Stanford
were to pay TA's some fixed
salary and in addition pay $300
for each dependent, the Univer
sity would in effect be reward
ing those TA's foolish enough to
have children that they could
not afford.
The folly of indiscriminate re
production is being realized by
an increasing number of in
formed people, due in part to the
presence of such excellent books
as Dr. Paul Ehrlich's The Pop
ulation Bomb (95c in paper
back). One has only to compare
the Peninsula of five years ago
with the Peninsula today to note
increased smog and traffic con
gestion and a decline in open
space and in park area per per
son.
Since the TA's seem content to
live under the archaic paternal
istic university system, they
should act responsibly and de
mand that Stanford SUBTRACT
$300 for each dependent ( exclud
ing a spouse, which seems rea
sonable). The University should
not be put in the position of
making the population bomb tick
faster.

• Park-in Rejected
Editor, The Daily:
While I support the Grape
Boycott, I find the recent "park
in" unacceptable. To legislate
morality or the "recognition of
social responsibility" is difficult
enough. Nonlegislative coercion
of morality or recognition of so
cial responsibility can easily be
going too far.
Whatever the decision or jus
tification, such action becomes
the will of a minority impressed
upon the general public. If a
student objects to grape sales
and feels therefore he has the
right and obligation to physic
ally obstruct their sale, then the
Blue Max could find it within his
right and responsibility to phy
sically obstruct "communist"
book sales at Kepler's.
So many people have cooper
ated voluntarily with the Grape
Boycott. Why lose support from
those people who believe in free
dom of choice, choice to estab
lish a union and choice to buy
grapes, by making "Safeway

recognize their social responsi
bility"?

History
• Grape Myths
Editor, The Dally:
I wonder how many Stanford
students bothered to inform
themselves of the facts before
they voted to support the United
Farm Workers in the so-called
grape dispute. My husband and
I spent half the summer in De
lano to learn firsthand what is
happening. Here are the facts:
1. The grape worker portray
ed as a struggling, poor, and ex
ploited group is a myth. The
workers who are presently in
the fields have been harvesting
the crops formany years. Many
of the families live in and
around Delano, and for some of
them picking grapes is a sec
ond job within the family. For
the past two years these work
ers have endured insults, threats,
and general harrassment from
outsiders — demonstrators who
have never been in the fields.
2. Field workers have declared
they want no part of Chavez or
his union, so students who vote
to support the United Farm
Workers are not supporting
grape pickers at all.
3. The union wants "to get"
$1.65 for the workers. Grape
pickers are already receiving an
hourly wage of $1.50 plus a 25
cent bonus per box (three boxes
per hour minimum). I missed
out on the "new math," but that
adds up to a $2.25 minimum in
my book.
4. The farmer hires through a
crew boss, and the workers make
their demands of the farmer
through that same crew boss.
When the crop is ripe on the
vine, the crew has all the bar
gaining power in the world.
5. If the students are well
meaning, then certainly they are
misinformed, or are they merely
expousing a Cause — real or
myth — for the sake of "getting
involved." They are supporting
a boycott which has been de
clared illegal. If the boycott is
successful and grape growers
are forced to turn to mechanized
crops, what will become of the
workers? Whom will the union
attempt to organize then?

• Campbell & Hoover
Editor, THE DAILY
Certainly your stand on the
UC faculty's right to and re
sponsibility in decisions of ap
pointment and government can
not be disputed. But one must
take issue with the last sentence
of your Tuesday editorial. Your
redoubtable passion for academ
ic freedom has seemingly re
sulted in that same blindness
that you state cripples the Gov
ernor and his followers.
Whatever may be your view
of the Director of the Hoover
Institution as a UC Regent, you
show a blind and incredibly
prejudiced attitude in condemn
ing the Institution in toto by as
serting that it is "already a
blight on the Stanford name."
The Hoover Institution is inter
nationally acknowledged as one
of the world's most outstanding
research libraries.
Your complete (and deliber
ate?) disregard of its nopoliti
cal contributions, of its funda
mental value to students and
scholars the world over, mani
fests an intellectual blindness
that is unworthy of you. Do
you know what resoruces the
Hoover Institution houses?
The Hoover Institution is un
doubtedly resigned to the Daily's
periodic anti-Hoover Institution
binge. But your edtiorial also
makes an assault that is, I be
lieve, new to its pages by label
ing Reagan a Don Quixote. This
is an unwarranted and shocking
affront to the name of Miguel
de Cervantes and to his most

famous creation. Reagan roman
tic, idealistic, chivalrous! Have
you ever read Don Quixote?

• Erroneous Parallels
Editor, The DAILY:
In reading the account of Fa
ther Berrigan's talk, my eye was
caught by his question as quot
ed by your reporter: "Would the
Jewish prosecutor have prose
cuted the nine of us in Germany
during World War II for burn
ing one of Hitler's draft files?"
This question it seems to me
is selfdefeating since no Jews
occupied responsible positions in
Hitler's Germany during World
War 11. They were either dead,
in concentration camps, in hid
ing, or refugees. It seems to me
that Father Berrigan weakens
his case by drawing erroneous
historical parallels.

• Errors On May field
Editor, THE DAILY
In the article "Mayfield Resur
rected for Housing" four struc
tural deficiencies were incorrect
ly reported:
1. Poor heating system—four
new 4,000 watt fan forced ther
mostatically controlled electrical
heaters were installed on the
third floor of Mayfield House
and the existing heating system
is being thoroughly checked and
repaired.
2. Condemned kitchen—the old
ATO kitchen was not con
demned by the County of Santa
Clara Health Department. The
kitchen was not opened because
of the large renovation cost to
raise the kitchen to a standard
equivalent to other university
residences and because of the
large operating losses incurred
when operating a kitchen serv
ing 40 residents. Instead, a food
service program was initiated
with Roth and Guthrie Houses.
3. Faulty wiring—all wiring,
fixtures and appliances are in
stalled in accordance with the
State of California Electrical
Safety Orders and certified to
the county of Santa Clara Fire
Marshal's office by a licensed
electrical contractor.
4. Wooden fire escape — the
fire escape was constructed in
accordance with the State of
California Administration Code,
Title 19 (State Fire Marshal's
Regulations).

• Olympic Protest
Editor, The Dally:
I wish to reply to the support
you gave Tommy Smith and
John Carlos in the recent pro
test during the Olympic award
ceremonies. It is difficult to de
termine from the article "Track
Power" whether you justify the
protest on grounds that Hitler
oriented the Games correctly,
that they should be used for po
litical demonstration, or that
such use, although deplorable,
exists in some forms, and that,
therefore, the Olympic Commit
tees should allow it in any form.
The former attitude would, I
believe, be the demise of the
Olympic Games — the athletic
competition would dissolve amid
the acidity of the countless num
ber of bitter political struggles
which continually seethe; such
an attitude would condone Czech
demonstrations against the So
viets, Biaffran against Federalist
Nigeria, Pakistani against India,
Arab against Jew. The Olympic
Games in such an atmosphere
would no longer exist as an
athletic competition.
True, that underlying the
Games is a quite discernable
current of political rivalry, but
to support a perpetration of
wrong simply on the grounds of
