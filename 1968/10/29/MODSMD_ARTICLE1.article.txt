# U.C. Student Strike Begins, AFT Local Votes Support
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Berkeley students began a
strike yesterday after 3,500 stu
dents at a noon rally voted over
whelmingly in favor of an im
mediate boycott of classes.
The effectiveness of the strike,
called to protest the Board of
Regents' action against the Eld
ridge Cleaver course on racism
and the arrest of 197 demon
strators last week, has not ac
curately been gauged as yet.
Many classes were cancelled
and others reported only 50 per
cent attendance, however.
The striking students received
the support of the Berkeley
local of the American Federa
tion of Teachers (AFT, the grad
uate student union). But the
AFT members voted down a
proposal that they go out on
strike at an afternoon meet
ing.

Earlier in the day, Konstantin
Berlandt, editor of the Daily Cali
fornian, and Charles Palmer,
president of the Associated Stu
dents of the University of Cali
fornia, began a hunger strike,
pledging to fast until student
demands were met.
These demands were echoed
by the AFT in a resolution
passed at their meeting.
"We support the student
strike and urge members not to
attend classes," they declared.
"We urge members not to cross
picket lines. . . . We issue to the
administration and faculty the
following demands. Failure to
adequately meet them will be
considered a strikable issue by
our local:
"1) Recission or massive nul
lification of the Regential ban
on guest lecturers (aimed
against Cleaver); 2) No punitive
action against any employee's
employment status for any ac
tivities in protest of the Regent
ial resolution. . .
"3) Full credit for course
Social Analysis 139 X (for which
Cleaver is delivering ten lec
tures)); 4) No academic punish
ment for non-academic crimes
in the current crisis (such as
suspension of the protesters ar
rested last Tuesday and Wednes
day); 5) A campus administra
tion commitment to promptly

begin negotiations with campus
unions on the union proposals
on minority employment and en
rollment."
While many students spent
the afternoon in discussion
groups across the campus, Chan
cellor Roger Heyns set aside
his morning for sessions with
students.
Heyns argued against the boy
cott, and said he felt there was
a possibility that the Regents
would rescind its earlier resolu
tion.
William J. Bouwsma, vice
chancellor for academic affairs,
took stronger action against the
strike.
In a letter to deans and de
partment chairmen, he declared
that the administration "rejects
the use of a strike to settle the
issues of concern to the cam
pus."
He said a strike would "ser
iously infringe on the academic
freedom of both students and
faculty members."
Threat Of Discipline
In another letter, which ap
peared in the Daily Californian
yesterday, Bouwsma warned
faculty members and teaching
assistants they would be sub
ject to disciplinary action if they
participated in the strike.
He quoted from Regent's reg
ulations forbidding faculty

members, including TA's from
participating in a boycott.
Responding to the crisis, the
Educational Policy Committee
of the Board of Regents met in
secret session at UCLA yester
day afternoon.
W. Glenn Campbell, head of
the Hoover Institution and a
member of the committee, told
the Daily that the meeting con
cerned the Regent's resolution
which affected Cleaver's course,
and faculty response to the
move.
Campbell refused to comment
further.
Teaeh-In
Plans for today include a teach
in at the Student Union from
10 a.m. to 4 p.m., sponsored by
the Center for Participant Edu
cation. This group also sponsors
the Cleaver course. Berlandt and
Palmer plan to continue their
fast.
"We want to do something
which will arouse the concern
of the people of the state, in
stead of alienating them," Ber
landt said. "Through an over
concern with our methods of
protest . . . the media and the
majority of the state and na
tion have failed to consider the
primary moral issues involved
with the war in Vietnam, a free
state, and a free university."

The effectiveness of the strike,
called to protest the Board of
Regents' action against the Eld
ridge Cleaver course on racism
and the arrest of 197 demon
strators last week, has not ac
curately been gauged as yet.
Many classes were cancelled
and others reported only 50 per
cent attendance, however.
The striking students received
the support of the Berkeley
local of the American Federa
tion of Teachers (AFT, the grad
uate student union). But the
AFT members voted down a
proposal that they go out on
strike at an afternoon meet
ing.

Earlier in the day, Konstantin
Berlandt, editor of the Daily Cali
fornian, and Charles Palmer,
president of the Associated Stu
dents of the University of Cali
fornia, began a hunger strike,
pledging to fast until student
demands were met.
These demands were echoed
by the AFT in a resolution
passed at their meeting.
"We support the student
strike and urge members not to
attend classes," they declared.
"We urge members not to cross
picket lines. . . . We issue to the
administration and faculty the
following demands. Failure to
adequately meet them will be
considered a strikable issue by
our local:
"1) Recission or massive nul
lification of the Regential ban
on guest lecturers (aimed
against Cleaver); 2) No punitive
action against any employee's
employment status for any ac
tivities in protest of the Regent
ial resolution. . .
"3) Full credit for course
Social Analysis 139 X (for which
Cleaver is delivering ten lec
tures)); 4) No academic punish
ment for non-academic crimes
in the current crisis (such as
suspension of the protesters ar
rested last Tuesday and Wednes
day); 5) A campus administra
tion commitment to promptly

begin negotiations with campus
unions on the union proposals
on minority employment and en
rollment."
While many students spent
the afternoon in discussion
groups across the campus, Chan
cellor Roger Heyns set aside
his morning for sessions with
students.
Heyns argued against the boy
cott, and said he felt there was
a possibility that the Regents
would rescind its earlier resolu
tion.
William J. Bouwsma, vice
chancellor for academic affairs,
took stronger action against the
strike.
In a letter to deans and de
partment chairmen, he declared
that the administration "rejects
the use of a strike to settle the
issues of concern to the cam
pus."
He said a strike would "ser
iously infringe on the academic
freedom of both students and
faculty members."
Threat Of Discipline
In another letter, which ap
peared in the Daily Californian
yesterday, Bouwsma warned
faculty members and teaching
assistants they would be sub
ject to disciplinary action if they
participated in the strike.
He quoted from Regent's reg
ulations forbidding faculty

members, including TA's from
participating in a boycott.
Responding to the crisis, the
Educational Policy Committee
of the Board of Regents met in
secret session at UCLA yester
day afternoon.
W. Glenn Campbell, head of
the Hoover Institution and a
member of the committee, told
the Daily that the meeting con
cerned the Regent's resolution
which affected Cleaver's course,
and faculty response to the
move.
Campbell refused to comment
further.
Teaeh-In
Plans for today include a teach
in at the Student Union from
10 a.m. to 4 p.m., sponsored by
the Center for Participant Edu
cation. This group also sponsors
the Cleaver course. Berlandt and
Palmer plan to continue their
fast.
"We want to do something
which will arouse the concern
of the people of the state, in
stead of alienating them," Ber
landt said. "Through an over
concern with our methods of
protest . . . the media and the
majority of the state and na
tion have failed to consider the
primary moral issues involved
with the war in Vietnam, a free
state, and a free university."

curately been gauged as yet.
Many classes were cancelled
and others reported only 50 per
cent attendance, however.
The striking students received
the support of the Berkeley
local of the American Federa
tion of Teachers (AFT, the grad
uate student union). But the
AFT members voted down a
proposal that they go out on
strike at an afternoon meet
ing.

Earlier in the day, Konstantin
Berlandt, editor of the Daily Cali
fornian, and Charles Palmer,
president of the Associated Stu
dents of the University of Cali
fornia, began a hunger strike,
pledging to fast until student
demands were met.
These demands were echoed
by the AFT in a resolution
passed at their meeting.
"We support the student
strike and urge members not to
attend classes," they declared.
"We urge members not to cross
picket lines. . . . We issue to the
administration and faculty the
following demands. Failure to
adequately meet them will be
considered a strikable issue by
our local:
"1) Recission or massive nul
lification of the Regential ban
on guest lecturers (aimed
against Cleaver); 2) No punitive
action against any employee's
employment status for any ac
tivities in protest of the Regent
ial resolution. . .
"3) Full credit for course
Social Analysis 139 X (for which
Cleaver is delivering ten lec
tures)); 4) No academic punish
ment for non-academic crimes
in the current crisis (such as
suspension of the protesters ar
rested last Tuesday and Wednes
day); 5) A campus administra
tion commitment to promptly

begin negotiations with campus
unions on the union proposals
on minority employment and en
rollment."
While many students spent
the afternoon in discussion
groups across the campus, Chan
cellor Roger Heyns set aside
his morning for sessions with
students.
Heyns argued against the boy
cott, and said he felt there was
a possibility that the Regents
would rescind its earlier resolu
tion.
William J. Bouwsma, vice
chancellor for academic affairs,
took stronger action against the
strike.
In a letter to deans and de
partment chairmen, he declared
that the administration "rejects
the use of a strike to settle the
issues of concern to the cam
pus."
He said a strike would "ser
iously infringe on the academic
freedom of both students and
faculty members."
Threat Of Discipline
In another letter, which ap
peared in the Daily Californian
yesterday, Bouwsma warned
faculty members and teaching
assistants they would be sub
ject to disciplinary action if they
participated in the strike.
He quoted from Regent's reg
ulations forbidding faculty

members, including TA's from
participating in a boycott.
Responding to the crisis, the
Educational Policy Committee
of the Board of Regents met in
secret session at UCLA yester
day afternoon.
W. Glenn Campbell, head of
the Hoover Institution and a
member of the committee, told
the Daily that the meeting con
cerned the Regent's resolution
which affected Cleaver's course,
and faculty response to the
move.
Campbell refused to comment
further.
Teaeh-In
Plans for today include a teach
in at the Student Union from
10 a.m. to 4 p.m., sponsored by
the Center for Participant Edu
cation. This group also sponsors
the Cleaver course. Berlandt and
Palmer plan to continue their
fast.
"We want to do something
which will arouse the concern
of the people of the state, in
stead of alienating them," Ber
landt said. "Through an over
concern with our methods of
protest . . . the media and the
majority of the state and na
tion have failed to consider the
primary moral issues involved
with the war in Vietnam, a free
state, and a free university."


SLAC TOUR — The public recently toured SLAC facilities. The upper tunnel (above) is 20 feet
above the accelerator tul»e itself. SLAC has been forced to cancel plans to expand its operating
schedule due to federal budget cutbacks.
