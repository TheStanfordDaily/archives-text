## Engineering Education 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
This is a reply to the feature
article in The Daily of Tuesday,
October 15, by Michael Sweeney.
In this article Mr. Sweeney
not only condemns undergrad
uate education at Stanford in
general, but includes the follow
ing statement about engineer
ing, . . graduate study and
research grew magnificently
while undergraduate education
went to hell." I feel strongly
that the last c'ause of this state
ment is both wrong and in
sulting.
In the first place, it is specious
to conclude that because im
provements are planned, things
had to be in a hell of a state
to begin with. It is decidedly
possible to make good better,
and this was and is the state
in undergraduate engineering
education at Stanford.
I have known the Stanford
Engineering School intimately
since 1939 as an undergraduate,
a graduate student, and faculty
member. I can assure you that
the Stanford engineering under
graduate receives a far better
education today both absolutely
and relative to other schools
than he did twenty or thirty
years ago. Our undergraduate
courses are not taught by teach
ing assistants as Mr. Sweeney
implies, but by regular full-time
faculty, frequently the most
senior faculty. Often there are
men with international reputa
tions and wide experience.
Our counseling system is not
perfect, but we work at it very
hard; it occupies a large frac
tion of the time of one of our

most senior professors and best
teachers, J. K. Vennard. The ma
terials presented in undergrad
uate courses are in general rig
orous and up-to-date.
We have maintained relatively
strong laboratory sequences and
these are also often taught by
senior professors. Such labora
tory sequences are very expens
ive and time-consuming for sen
ior faculty, but we teach them
anyway, because for engineers
this is one of the most relevant
parts of their education. Many
other schools have not done
this in the face of rising costs
and faculty shortages.
As a comment on our teach
ing effectiveness, perhaps the
best single measure is the pro
duction of widely accepted text
books. As a consulting editor
for a decade for McGraw-Hill
(the world's largest publisher of
technical books except for the
Russian government.) I can as
sure you that good textbooks
nearly always grow from well
taught courses—not the other
way around. For two decades
Stanford has been the prime
single source for leading under
graduate texts in engineering.
Some of the fields in which
books written by Stanford fac
ulty have held a major fraction
of the national market are:
circuit theory, electromagnet
ism, thermodynamics, fluid me
chanics, statics, dynamics, vibra
tions, and strength of materials.
In short, we have produced lead
ing texts, indicating outstanding
teaching, in nearly every area
of the basic engineering sciences
which are the foundation stone

of undergraduate engineering
education.
I have personally visited about
half the 200 engineering schools
in the United States and from
a variety of professional con
tacts over the past two decades
know a good bit about the oth
ers. I can assure you that Stan
ford ranks very high or at the
top in all of rigor of materials,
teaching standards, flexibility of
programming, and variety of
curricula and courses offered to
undergraduates. This opinion is
shared by many of my col
leagues across the country and
internationally.
I would like to make one
other important point here.
There is much current con
demnation of research on the
grounds that it detracts from
teaching. This is simply a false
conclusion. In the first place,
technical fields like engineering
move so fast today that a fac
ulty that is not doing research
will inevitably be teaching out
moded stuff—a true disservice
to the student.
There are of course big in
dividual variations in teaching
ability among both researchers
and non-researchers, but on the
average the researchers came
out as clearly better teachers
from the student point of view.
Stanford's undergraduate edu
cation in engineering is not per
fect. Many improvements are
possible, and some important
one are embodied in the current
report of the SES Committee.
This report was a joint faculty
student effort which occupied
most of the 1967-68 school year.
Implementation of various as
pects is now under study.
This kind of self-improvement
is hardly new at Stanford; it has
been going on nearly contin
uously for the 30 years I have
known the school. We have had
no real revolutions in our en
gineering curriculum at Stan
ford simply because we have
made the evolutionary changes
nearly continuously.
I hope that in the future Mr.
Sweeney and The Daily will take
the time to discuss the situation
with some of us who have na
tional bases for comparison and
data on actual effects before
making sweeping condemna
tions about undergraduate edu
cation.
The long, hard work by many
students and faculty in prepar
ing the SEES report on engi
neering education at Stanford
will, I am convinced, lead to bet
ter education. Sweeping, and un
true statements about our pro
gram, devoid of constructive
suggestions certainly will not.
S. J. KLINE, Professor
Mechanical Engineering
