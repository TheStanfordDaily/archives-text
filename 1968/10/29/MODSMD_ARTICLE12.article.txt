# OH, CHRIST! A COLUMN
## 
### PAUL RUPERT 
A few friends once had a
brief, perhaps tragic conversa
tion with an Oakland policeman
while serving time for their part
in Stop-the-Draft-Week street
disturbances. He said he was not
happy having to beat people's
heads during the week, and that
being a cop was sometimes very
unpleasant. So they asked why
he didn't do something else.
He said he wasn't sure what
else he could do: "I mean, what
do you do after twenty years in
the Marine Corps?" At first they
were shocked, thought maybe
he was kidding; then they real
ized he was being perfectly hon
est. They were about to ask him
something else when he stared
off into the compound for a mo
ment, and said, "Besides, I guess
I just enjoy working with peo
ple."
The salvation of the world may
lie in its plethora of good inten
tions; so may its destruction.
The good cop's logic reminds me
of last Spring's classic quote
from Vietnam: the officer who
had ordered the levelling of a
Delta village said in explanation,
"We had to destroy the village
in order to save it."
Each of you reading this col
umn will have a different reac
tion to the beauty or absurdity of
these statements, depending on
how many abstractions you
share with the cop and the colo
nel. Either man and each of us
will say unequivocally that the
beating or killing of men and
the elimination of cities is at
least undesirable, if not wrong.
But there enters, after that
statement, an eternal "8ut..."
•Working With'
When you ask the cop how he
conceives of beating people as
"working with" them, he might
explain that he means that in
the long run he is working for
the good of the people. Ditto the
colonel. And President Johnson.
And Premier Kosygin.
And all the Stanford students
who—on behalf of "the national
interest"—enlist, or are inducted
joyfully or reluctantly. And all
the SRI researchers and Trus
tees and Pitzers who look after
the world's peasants in a grow
ing complex of think tanks.
Thus far this century there
are fifty million war dead who
rest in blessed peace, thankful
that their death was in some
one's interest, the fruit of many
peoples just working together.
These have gotten by with a lit
tle help from their friends.
Tortured Logic
I DroDose that we abandoned

tortured logic on behalf of a
simple statement about our ac
tions: when you kill someone,
however worthy your intentions,
you end up with at least one
dead man. When you decide that
on behalf of the free world or
perhaps in the name of the revo
lution—both motivated by a real
desire to see a free world—that
the people with whom you work
are dispensable in the search for
their long-term good, you may
just be wrong.
I should say here that I am
most interested in bringing a
genuine social revolution to this
country, which hopefully will re
turn power to our people and to
millions of people around the
"free world" who suffer in our
agents' bondage.
I am not so sure of how that
should occur that I am willing
to make categorical statements
about the means. But I wonder
if I will ever be so sure of my
intentions that I will be ready
to kill for them? (Incidentally, I
don't think property destruction
is necessarily a form of vio
lence; we can debate that one
later, however.)
Two Reactions
Now there are two strong re
actions occurring in the minds
of my readers: my so-called
"violent" revolutionary friends

are dismissing me as just an
other naive pacifist who doesn't
understand the nature of power
and the need for humane, revo
lutionary violence to secure the
new world; but the great ma
jority of readers are probably
glad that I think social change
can occur without violence, and
sort of dig that idea themselves.
To resolve these differences,
and to get on with the revolu
tion, I suggest the medium of
work. The "violent revolution
aries" of Guatemala consider
themselves hard-working educa
tors who carry guns, and sel
dom use them; so I urge my si
milarly inclined friends to join
me in work here. In fact, I find
that many of them do, and in
most cases we work well to
gether.
But what about the vast ma
jority of Stanford students and
faculty who valiantly struggle
with the knotty abstraction of
violence and non-violence, who
speak and write eloquent attacks
on those who advocate violence.
It seems to me that those who
sit back and prefer sniping at
one or another "misguided" rev
olutionary could best spend
their time figuring out where
they want to work, and begin
ning it.

We are fast approaching a po
litical reign that understands
abstracted, but all too real vio
lence, as a way of life. John
Kennedy, who understood it bet
ter than most, said "Those who
make peaceful change impossi
ble, make violent change inevita
ble."
The time is at hand for choos
ing sides, and you can introduce
all the complexity and fudging
and blurring you wish into an

either/or situation: that doesn't
change the situation. I suggest
you look hard and clearly at
what you are doing, and join us
in an attempt to live out a new
logic, under the Banner of Eter
nal Measure: "If you do shit for
ten years, what you have left at
the end of ten years is a pile of
shit."
Somebody's got to carry the
idea to the colonel and the cop:
If not you, who?

country, which hopefully will re
turn power to our people and to
millions of people around the
"free world" who suffer in our
agents' bondage.
I am not so sure of how that
should occur that I am willing
to make categorical statements
about the means. But I wonder
if I will ever be so sure of my
intentions that I will be ready
to kill for them? (Incidentally, I
don't think property destruction
is necessarily a form of vio
lence; we can debate that one
later, however.)
Two Reactions
Now there are two strong re
actions occurring in the minds
of my readers: my so-called
"violent" revolutionary friends

are dismissing me as just an
other naive pacifist who doesn't
understand the nature of power
and the need for humane, revo
lutionary violence to secure the
new world; but the great ma
jority of readers are probably
glad that I think social change
can occur without violence, and
sort of dig that idea themselves.
To resolve these differences,
and to get on with the revolu
tion, I suggest the medium of
work. The "violent revolution
aries" of Guatemala consider
themselves hard-working educa
tors who carry guns, and sel
dom use them; so I urge my si
milarly inclined friends to join
me in work here. In fact, I find
that many of them do, and in
most cases we work well to
gether.
But what about the vast ma
jority of Stanford students and
faculty who valiantly struggle
with the knotty abstraction of
violence and non-violence, who
speak and write eloquent attacks
on those who advocate violence.
It seems to me that those who
sit back and prefer sniping at
one or another "misguided" rev
olutionary could best spend
their time figuring out where
they want to work, and begin
ning it.

We are fast approaching a po
litical reign that understands
abstracted, but all too real vio
lence, as a way of life. John
Kennedy, who understood it bet
ter than most, said "Those who
make peaceful change impossi
ble, make violent change inevita
ble."
The time is at hand for choos
ing sides, and you can introduce
all the complexity and fudging
and blurring you wish into an

either/or situation: that doesn't
change the situation. I suggest
you look hard and clearly at
what you are doing, and join us
in an attempt to live out a new
logic, under the Banner of Eter
nal Measure: "If you do shit for
ten years, what you have left at
the end of ten years is a pile of
shit."
Somebody's got to carry the
idea to the colonel and the cop:
If not you, who?
A few friends once had a
brief, perhaps tragic conversa
tion with an Oakland policeman
while serving time for their part
in Stop-the-Draft-Week street
disturbances. He said he was not
happy having to beat people's
heads during the week, and that
being a cop was sometimes very
unpleasant. So they asked why
he didn't do something else.
He said he wasn't sure what
else he could do: "I mean, what
do you do after twenty years in
the Marine Corps?" At first they
were shocked, thought maybe
he was kidding; then they real
ized he was being perfectly hon
est. They were about to ask him
something else when he stared
off into the compound for a mo
ment, and said, "Besides, I guess
I just enjoy working with peo
ple."
The salvation of the world may
lie in its plethora of good inten
tions; so may its destruction.
The good cop's logic reminds me
of last Spring's classic quote
from Vietnam: the officer who
had ordered the levelling of a
Delta village said in explanation,
"We had to destroy the village
in order to save it."
Each of you reading this col
umn will have a different reac
tion to the beauty or absurdity of
these statements, depending on
how many abstractions you
share with the cop and the colo
nel. Either man and each of us
will say unequivocally that the
beating or killing of men and
the elimination of cities is at
least undesirable, if not wrong.
But there enters, after that
statement, an eternal "8ut..."
•Working With'
When you ask the cop how he
conceives of beating people as
"working with" them, he might
explain that he means that in
the long run he is working for
the good of the people. Ditto the
colonel. And President Johnson.
And Premier Kosygin.
And all the Stanford students
who—on behalf of "the national
interest"—enlist, or are inducted
joyfully or reluctantly. And all
the SRI researchers and Trus
tees and Pitzers who look after
the world's peasants in a grow
ing complex of think tanks.
Thus far this century there
are fifty million war dead who
rest in blessed peace, thankful
that their death was in some
one's interest, the fruit of many
peoples just working together.
These have gotten by with a lit
tle help from their friends.
Tortured Logic
I DroDose that we abandoned

tortured logic on behalf of a
simple statement about our ac

however worthy your intentions,
you end up with at least one
dead man. When you decide that
on behalf of the free world or
perhaps in the name of the revo
lution—both motivated by a real
desire to see a free world—that
the people with whom you work
are dispensable in the search for
their long-term good, you may
just be wrong.

being a cop was sometimes very
unpleasant. So they asked why
he didn't do something else.
He said he wasn't sure what
else he could do: "I mean, what
do you do after twenty years in
the Marine Corps?" At first they
were shocked, thought maybe
he was kidding; then they real
ized he was being perfectly hon
est. They were about to ask him
something else when he stared
off into the compound for a mo
ment, and said, "Besides, I guess
I just enjoy working with peo
ple."
The salvation of the world may
lie in its plethora of good inten
tions; so may its destruction.
The good cop's logic reminds me
of last Spring's classic quote
from Vietnam: the officer who
had ordered the levelling of a
Delta village said in explanation,
"We had to destroy the village
in order to save it."
Each of you reading this col
umn will have a different reac
tion to the beauty or absurdity of
these statements, depending on
how many abstractions you
share with the cop and the colo
nel. Either man and each of us
will say unequivocally that the
beating or killing of men and
the elimination of cities is at
least undesirable, if not wrong.
But there enters, after that
statement, an eternal "8ut..."
•Working With'
When you ask the cop how he
conceives of beating people as
"working with" them, he might
explain that he means that in
the long run he is working for
the good of the people. Ditto the
colonel. And President Johnson.
And Premier Kosygin.
And all the Stanford students
who—on behalf of "the national
interest"—enlist, or are inducted
joyfully or reluctantly. And all
the SRI researchers and Trus
tees and Pitzers who look after
the world's peasants in a grow
ing complex of think tanks.
Thus far this century there
are fifty million war dead who
rest in blessed peace, thankful
that their death was in some
one's interest, the fruit of many
peoples just working together.
These have gotten by with a lit
tle help from their friends.
Tortured Logic
I DroDose that we abandoned

tortured logic on behalf of a
simple statement about our ac
tions: when you kill someone,
however worthy your intentions,
you end up with at least one
dead man. When you decide that
on behalf of the free world or
perhaps in the name of the revo
lution—both motivated by a real
desire to see a free world—that
the people with whom you work
are dispensable in the search for
their long-term good, you may
just be wrong.
I should say here that I am
most interested in bringing a
genuine social revolution to this
country, which hopefully will re
turn power to our people and to
millions of people around the
"free world" who suffer in our
agents' bondage.
I am not so sure of how that
should occur that I am willing
to make categorical statements
about the means. But I wonder
if I will ever be so sure of my
intentions that I will be ready
to kill for them? (Incidentally, I
don't think property destruction
is necessarily a form of vio
lence; we can debate that one
later, however.)
Two Reactions
Now there are two strong re
actions occurring in the minds
of my readers: my so-called
"violent" revolutionary friends

are dismissing me as just an
other naive pacifist who doesn't
understand the nature of power
and the need for humane, revo
lutionary violence to secure the
new world; but the great ma
jority of readers are probably
glad that I think social change
can occur without violence, and
sort of dig that idea themselves.
To resolve these differences,
and to get on with the revolu
tion, I suggest the medium of
work. The "violent revolution
aries" of Guatemala consider
themselves hard-working educa
tors who carry guns, and sel
dom use them; so I urge my si
milarly inclined friends to join
me in work here. In fact, I find
that many of them do, and in
most cases we work well to
gether.
But what about the vast ma
jority of Stanford students and
faculty who valiantly struggle
with the knotty abstraction of
violence and non-violence, who
speak and write eloquent attacks
on those who advocate violence.
It seems to me that those who
sit back and prefer sniping at
one or another "misguided" rev
olutionary could best spend
their time figuring out where
they want to work, and begin
ning it.

We are fast approaching a po
litical reign that understands
abstracted, but all too real vio
lence, as a way of life. John
Kennedy, who understood it bet
ter than most, said "Those who
make peaceful change impossi
ble, make violent change inevita
ble."
The time is at hand for choos
ing sides, and you can introduce
all the complexity and fudging
and blurring you wish into an

either/or situation: that doesn't
change the situation. I suggest
you look hard and clearly at
what you are doing, and join us
in an attempt to live out a new
logic, under the Banner of Eter
nal Measure: "If you do shit for
ten years, what you have left at
the end of ten years is a pile of
shit."
Somebody's got to carry the
idea to the colonel and the cop:
If not you, who?
A few friends once had a
brief, perhaps tragic conversa
tion with an Oakland policeman
while serving time for their part
in Stop-the-Draft-Week street
disturbances. He said he was not
