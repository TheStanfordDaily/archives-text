• Agnew Vs The Times
NEW YORK (AP) — The New
York Times reprinted Monday
night an editorial in which it ac
cused Spiro T. Agnew, Republi
can vice presidential candidate,
of being involved in "clear and
repeated conflicts of interest."
The newspaper acted after
Richard M. Nixon, GOP presi
dential nominee, said he would
demand a retraction from the
Times of the contents of the edi
torial, which first appeared Sat
urday.
Agnew issued a four-page
statement denying every charge

made in a Times editorial of
Saturday morning and said "the
fact that the Times waited until
a week before the election to
distort the facts and made its in
accurate charges against me
compounds the libel."
At the same time, Agnew's at
torney and campaign manager,
George White, said he would

recommend that Agnew sue the
newspaper for libel unless the
Times retracted its editorial.
The Saturday Times editorial
said that Agnew bought land on
the probable approach route of
a new Chesapeake Bay bridge
and disposed of it only after he
had become governor and in re
sponse to public criticism.
In his statement, Agnew said
"The Times charged or inferred
that because of favorable treat
ment given friends of mine while
I was in office that my financial
worth has risen sharply. This is
a completely false statement."
• Czechs Defy Soviets
PRAGUE (AP) — Defying So
viet occupation forces, tens of
thousands of young Czechoslo
vaks marched through Prague's
downtown streets for 12 hours
Monday and, waving the flag of
their nation, demanded a Rus
sian troop withdrawal. Some
thunderously chorused: "Rus
sians go home!"
The outpouring, on Czechoslo
vakia's 50th anniversary as a
nation, placed in jeopardy the
Moscow-Prague agreements for
a partial troop pullout and the

very future of the liberal regime
of Alexander Dubcek.
It was the first mass demon
stration since last August, the
month of the Soviet-led invasion
to halt the nation's liberalization
drive.

ting male students in Septem
ber. 1970, and eventually to have
a student body comprising 50
per cent of each sex.
• Gene With HHH
NEW YORK (AP) — Jerry
Eller, administrative assistant
to Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy,
said Monday night that Mc-
Carthy would issue a statement
Tuesday endorsing Hubert H.
Humphrey for president.
Eller told newsmen the state
ment would be issued at a
Washington news conference,
and asked if the Minnesota sen
ator would support the vice
president, Eller replied: "Of
course. It's just a matter of de
gree and extent."
E'ler made the statement in
an interview following a Mc-
Carthy speech at Madison
Square Garden in which the sen

ator rejected again attempts to
get him to announce his support
for Humphrey.
• An Added Treat
PALM DESERT (AP) — It
must have been a television
first.
Regular programming was
over, but before viewers could
turn otf the set, it happened.
On to the home scrsens in this
staid and fashionable commun
ity — and three neighboring
towns — flashed a stag movie.
Viewers said the film, which
showed naked men and women
in uninhibited activities, contin
ued for about 15 minutes early
Sunday before it stopped. The
reason for it still baffles author
ities.
TV owners in this part of
the Coachella Valley are served
by cable. The cable brings in
stations from Los Angeles as
well as two local stations. The
stag movie came over one of
the latter.
Yet both stations reported
their transmitters had been shut
down.
