# Daily Poll Finds Election Apathy
## 
### 
Summarizing the results of
this week's Daily poll shows
that only 59.4 per cent of the
Stanford student body support
the three major Presidential
candidates.
One of the most significant
findings of the poll is that
Eugene McCarthy still holds on
to 18 per cent of the student
body as their choice for the
Presidency. Another 11 per cent
of the students do not support
any candidate at all.
The remainder of the student
body was divided with 33 per
cent for Vice President Humph
rey, 24 per cent favoring Rich
ard Nixon, and 2.4 per cent
leaning to George Wallace. Dick
Gregory, Eldridge Cleaver and
Nelson Rockefeller are favored
by small segments of the one
per cent of the student body that
was contacted.
In the Senatorial race Demo
crat Alan Cranston, supported
by 81 per cent of the students,

is heavily favored over his op
ponent Max Rafferty. Rafferty
garnered the support of only
5.6 per cent of the students,
mostly graduates studying en
gineering, law and business.
The poll showed little differ
ence in opinion between stu
dents over and under 21 and no
significant difference between
California and out-of-state resi
dents.
More than 55 per cent of the
students contacted were regis
tered voters. Among this group,
54 per cent were Democrats, 25
percent Republicans and 21 per
cent were independents. There
were no significant differences
between registered and unregis
tered voters in their preferences.
Polling was done over the
phone by Daily staffers Ann
Denton and Mimi Passett under
the supervision of Associate
Editor Marshall Schwartz.
