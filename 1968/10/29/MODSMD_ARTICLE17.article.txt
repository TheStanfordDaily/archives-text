# Education Computerized
## 
### 
The future of computer-assist
ed instruction (CAI) was dis
cussed yesterday morning at a
symposium of the National
Academy of Sciences now meet
ing at Caltech.
Psychology Prof. Ernest R.
Hilgard and Psychology-Educa
tion Prof. Richard C. Atkinson
of Stanford were members of a
panel discussing CAI. UCLA

Dean of Education John I. Good
lad and Dean Ralph W. Gerard
of the UC-Irvine Graduate Divi
sion completed the panel.
Teacher training will be great
ly affected by computerization
as the role of the future teacher
is altered. When teachers are
freed from what are now rou
tine tasks, the quality of teach
ing should be raised.

The development of CAI, said
Prof. Atkinson, is slowed not
only by technical problems and
high cost, but also awaits a bet
ter understanding of the learn
ing process. He is optimistic,
however, because, "The heavy,
long-range financial commit
ment of both publishers and
manufacturers is an index of the
present reality and future de
velopment."
Prof. Hilgard stressed CAl's
flexibility. "Instruction is not
limited to fixed answers, he said.
"It is possible to teach poetry
or creativity, as well." The ulti
mate CAI would understand and
reply to questions "in free form."
He went on to say, however,
that CAI must be combined with
other learning activities. The
teacher must still see that the
student learns to initiate inquiry
on his own, and help him to gain
a favorable image of himself. He
can also direct the student to
ward effective cooperation with
others.
