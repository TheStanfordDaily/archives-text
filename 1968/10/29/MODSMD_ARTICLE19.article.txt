# New Art Building Nears Completion
## 
### 
The Nathan Cummings Art
Building, a project conceived of
four years ago to aid in the de
velopment of a better ail de
partment at Stanford, is going
through the final stages of con
struction.
"The building is only one
manifestation in the long, labori
ous job of building a first-rate
art department," said Dr. Lo
renze Eitner, department head.
"Faculty, students, and an art
library are others. We are doing
everything at once here."
Until recently, according to
Eitner, Stanford's art depart
ment has been "under-staffed,
under-equipped, and under -
housed." But since 1963, the Uni
versity has made a great effort
to upgrade the overall quality
of the department.
"We had to tackle the prob
lem from all sides," continued
Eitner. "It was a case of every
body agreeing that this thing
had to be done. There were
strong student and social pres
sures to upgrade the art de
partment."
The new building will play an
integral part in the entire con
cept of the revamped depart
ment. Previously, the depart
ment was scattered over several
acres of the University. "Some
students," said Eitner, "were
working with poor lighting and
in over-crowded conditions."
The intent of the new build
ing is to combine all the diverse
elements involved in the study
of art. In one building will be
housed artistic exploration and
interpretation ranging from pro
duction, to the studio, to the
study of art history.
To achieve such a goal, some
hard-to-reconcile aspects of art
had to be accommodated. "How
do you fit a welding shop and a
library together?" asked Eitner.
"It's like packing a suitcase
where you have to put dirty
shoes in with clean shirts."
To put the "dirty shoes in with
clean shirts" in a manner that
will not disturb anyone, the
building has been designed as a
cluster of elements. Lobbies con
necting the diverse parts of the
building will be used for exhibi
tions.
The building will house a 350-
seat auditorium, classrooms, a
slide library, studios, and li
brary stacks on the lower floor,
below grade level. On the main
floor will be the main reading
room of the planned 100,000-vol
ume art library, studios, seminar
and conference rooms, and of

flees. The partial third level will
have additional studio space.
Eitner hopes that by including
all facets of art in the new build
ing, students will develop an in
terest in areas outside their own
concentration. The student of
history will begin to create,
while the artist will study the
artistic trends of the past and
relate them to his own work.
After years of planning, de
signing, compromising over
styles, raising money, a reality
can be seen that, Eitner says,
"will visibly affect the cultural
geography of the nation."
