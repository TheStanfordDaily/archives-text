# Social Conscience
## A 						New Businessman 
### JANET SAGLIO 
The Stanford Graduate School
of Business is producing a new
brand of businessman, an execu
tive with a strong social con
science. The average business
student at Stanford is not as
mercenary as his outdated ste
reotype. Under the guidance of
a concerned faculty, and on their
own, the business students are

involving themselves in the
problems of our society.
Some professors in the busi
ness school believe that busi
nesses should be more involved
in solving social problems, and
that individual businessmen
should give of their time. These
faculty members hope to instill
their dedication in their stu
dents, but according to Assistant
Professor of Business Adminis
tration Gerald C. Leader, the
students have the interest, and
they need only show these stu
dents what opportunities there
are for them to help.
Many of these faculty mem
bers are involved in a training
program for MBA's joining the
Peace Corps held at Stanford in
the summer. In past summers,
the program trained Peace
Corps workers who are now in
Peru and Colombia.
A course dealing with the re
lationship of business to society
entitled "Business and its En
vironment" will be changed
from an elective to a required
course next year in order that
all students become aware of
what the professors see their
future responsibilities to be.
Reject Traditional
A comparative survey of busi
ness responsibility made last
year at Stanford by Research
Assistant Paul Huard, Assistant
Professor Gerald C. Leader, and
Research Associate Karlene H.
Roberts, shows that the Stan
ford MBA's accept a much
larger role for business in help
ing to solve society's problems
than the business executives
surveyed. They disagree with
the traditional businessman's
view that they should be con
cerned only with profit and leave
the social work to other orga
nizations. Some feel that busi
ness's responsibility is great
enough to justify reductions in
profits if necessary.
The MBA's at Stanford, how
ever, are not postponing their
responsibility until the time
when they can influence corpo

rate policy. Individuals are be
coming involved now.
A student organization headed
by Hoff Stauffer and John Os
terweis, two second year stu
dents, was started last spring to
direct interested students to the
areas where they can most help.
Clearinghouse
The Business Aid (Society)
acts as a clearinghouse. It co
operates with organizations like
the Small Business Investment
Corporation in East Palo Alto.
The SBIC puts the individual
graduate students in touch witl>
a small business owner who is
interested in the advisory aid
which the students give.
The students give the owners
— usually from minority groups
—the benefit of their training.
The program has been suc
cessful with an average of one
request for counseling a day.
Last spring when the project
began, fifty first and second
year students participated. This
year there are already forty sec
ond year students participating,
and first year students will be
admitted in the spring.
Present Counseling
At present, most of the coun
seling is done in Palo Alto, but
some work has been done in
San Francisco and San Jose.
Mr. Nathaniel N. Pugh, Jr.,
Associate Director of Admis
sions, will be leaving on a trip
soon to "recruit" a minimum of
ten minority group students for
the business school class of
1971.
Mr. Pugh is the director of a
new program in the graduate
school established on the recom
mendation of the "ad hoc Com
mittee on Racial and Urban
Problems" set up last spring af
ter the assassination of Martin
Luther King.
The ten or more students will
be college graduates who might
not have otherwise passed the
requirements for admission.
They will be given full scholar
ships covering tuition, housing,

and living expenses. The cost of
at least $10,000 per student will
be contributed by public and pri
vate organizations.
The program will make all ef
forts to make the students' ex
periences here successful. A
"head start" program will be
offered in the summer preceding
their entrance, and a formal tu
torial program will be set up.
The program will try to show
Negroes and other minority
groups that there is opportunity
for them in management, an
area in which, according to Mr.
Pugh, they do not easily visual
ize themselves.

Mr. Pugh also hopes to con
vince them that there is a place
for business in the ghetto, and
to point out the benefits of their
presence in the corporate struc
ture—both for the organization
and for them.
The students in the Graduate
School of Business see a greater
obligation for business to help
solve social problems, and are
becoming more active in solving
these problems now as individ
uals. The fact that out of last
year's class, seven people joined
the Peace Corps, and four went
into Vista is evidence of the
presence of strong conviction
about an MBA's role in society.

presence of strong conviction
about an MBA's role in society.
The Stanford Graduate School
of Business is producing a new
brand of businessman, an execu
tive with a strong social con
science. The average business
student at Stanford is not as
mercenary as his outdated ste
reotype. Under the guidance of
a concerned faculty, and on their
own, the business students are

involving themselves in the
problems of our society.
Some professors in the busi
ness school believe that busi
nesses should be more involved
in solving social problems, and
that individual businessmen
should give of their time. These
faculty members hope to instill
their dedication in their stu
dents, but according to Assistant
Professor of Business Adminis
tration Gerald C. Leader, the
students have the interest, and
they need only show these stu
dents what opportunities there
are for them to help.
Many of these faculty mem
bers are involved in a training
program for MBA's joining the
Peace Corps held at Stanford in
the summer. In past summers,
the program trained Peace
Corps workers who are now in
Peru and Colombia.
A course dealing with the re
lationship of business to society
entitled "Business and its En
vironment" will be changed
from an elective to a required
course next year in order that
all students become aware of
what the professors see their
future responsibilities to be.

A comparative survey of busi
ness responsibility made last
year at Stanford by Research
Assistant Paul Huard, Assistant
Professor Gerald C. Leader, and
Research Associate Karlene H.
Roberts, shows that the Stan
ford MBA's accept a much
larger role for business in help
ing to solve society's problems
than the business executives
surveyed. They disagree with
the traditional businessman's
view that they should be con
cerned only with profit and leave
the social work to other orga
nizations. Some feel that busi
ness's responsibility is great
enough to justify reductions in
profits if necessary.
The MBA's at Stanford, how
ever, are not postponing their
responsibility until the time
when they can influence corpo

rate policy. Individuals are be
coming involved now.
A student organization headed
by Hoff Stauffer and John Os
terweis, two second year stu
dents, was started last spring to
direct interested students to the
areas where they can most help.
Clearinghouse
The Business Aid (Society)
acts as a clearinghouse. It co
operates with organizations like
the Small Business Investment
Corporation in East Palo Alto.
The SBIC puts the individual
graduate students in touch witl>
a small business owner who is
interested in the advisory aid
which the students give.
The students give the owners
— usually from minority groups
—the benefit of their training.
The program has been suc
cessful with an average of one
request for counseling a day.
Last spring when the project
began, fifty first and second
year students participated. This
year there are already forty sec
ond year students participating,
and first year students will be
admitted in the spring.
Present Counseling
At present, most of the coun
seling is done in Palo Alto, but
some work has been done in
San Francisco and San Jose.
Mr. Nathaniel N. Pugh, Jr.,
Associate Director of Admis

Mr. Pugh is the director of a
new program in the graduate
school established on the recom
mendation of the "ad hoc Com

Problems" set up last spring af
ter the assassination of Martin

obligation for business to help
solve social problems, and are
becoming more active in solving
these problems now as individ
uals. The fact that out of last
year's class, seven people joined
the Peace Corps, and four went
into Vista is evidence of the
presence of strong conviction
about an MBA's role in society.
The Stanford Graduate School
of Business is producing a new
brand of businessman, an execu
tive with a strong social con
science. The average business
student at Stanford is not as
mercenary as his outdated ste
reotype. Under the guidance of
a concerned faculty, and on their
own, the business students are

involving themselves in the
problems of our society.
Some professors in the busi
ness school believe that busi
nesses should be more involved
in solving social problems, and
that individual businessmen
should give of their time. These
faculty members hope to instill
their dedication in their stu
dents, but according to Assistant
Professor of Business Adminis
tration Gerald C. Leader, the
students have the interest, and
they need only show these stu
dents what opportunities there
are for them to help.
Many of these faculty mem
bers are involved in a training
program for MBA's joining the
Peace Corps held at Stanford in
the summer. In past summers,
the program trained Peace
Corps workers who are now in
Peru and Colombia.
A course dealing with the re
lationship of business to society
entitled "Business and its En
vironment" will be changed
from an elective to a required
course next year in order that
all students become aware of
what the professors see their
future responsibilities to be.
Reject Traditional
A comparative survey of busi
ness responsibility made last
year at Stanford by Research
Assistant Paul Huard, Assistant
Professor Gerald C. Leader, and
Research Associate Karlene H.
Roberts, shows that the Stan
ford MBA's accept a much
larger role for business in help
ing to solve society's problems
than the business executives
surveyed. They disagree with
the traditional businessman's
view that they should be con
cerned only with profit and leave
the social work to other orga
nizations. Some feel that busi
ness's responsibility is great
enough to justify reductions in
profits if necessary.
The MBA's at Stanford, how
ever, are not postponing their
responsibility until the time
when they can influence corpo

rate policy. Individuals are be
coming involved now.
A student organization headed
by Hoff Stauffer and John Os
terweis, two second year stu
dents, was started last spring to
direct interested students to the
areas where they can most help.
Clearinghouse
The Business Aid (Society)
acts as a clearinghouse. It co
operates with organizations like
the Small Business Investment
Corporation in East Palo Alto.
The SBIC puts the individual
graduate students in touch witl>
a small business owner who is
interested in the advisory aid
which the students give.
The students give the owners
— usually from minority groups
—the benefit of their training.
The program has been suc
cessful with an average of one
request for counseling a day.
Last spring when the project
began, fifty first and second
year students participated. This
year there are already forty sec
ond year students participating,
and first year students will be
admitted in the spring.
Present Counseling
At present, most of the coun
seling is done in Palo Alto, but
some work has been done in
San Francisco and San Jose.
Mr. Nathaniel N. Pugh, Jr.,
Associate Director of Admis
sions, will be leaving on a trip
soon to "recruit" a minimum of
ten minority group students for
the business school class of
1971.
Mr. Pugh is the director of a
new program in the graduate
school established on the recom
mendation of the "ad hoc Com
mittee on Racial and Urban
Problems" set up last spring af
ter the assassination of Martin
Luther King.
The ten or more students will
be college graduates who might
not have otherwise passed the
requirements for admission.
They will be given full scholar
ships covering tuition, housing,

at least $10,000 per student will
be contributed by public and pri

The program will make all ef
forts to make the students' ex

"head start" program will be
offered in the summer preceding
their entrance, and a formal tu

The program will try to show
Negroes and other minority
groups that there is opportunity
for them in management, an
area in which, according to Mr.
Pugh, they do not easily visual
ize themselves.

Mr. Pugh also hopes to con
vince them that there is a place
for business in the ghetto, and
to point out the benefits of their
presence in the corporate struc

and for them.
