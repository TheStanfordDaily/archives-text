# Panel Weighs Czech Plight
## 
### 
To celebrate the founding of
Czechoslovakia, discuss its his
tory and show sympathy for its
plight, seven prominent students
and professors addressed a
crowd of over a hundred at Me
morial Church Sunday night.
B. Davie Napier, Dean of the
Chapel, opened the discussion by
stating that acts of the United
States in Latin America and
Southeast Asia "tarnish Ameri
can support for Czech freedom."
Dr. Harry B. Friedgood, then
said the program was not in
tended to voice anger over the
Russian invasion. "No nation has
ever had the moral stature to
condemn another for any kind
of aggression," he declared.
Rather, the convocation was

called to celebrate the 50th anni
versary of the formation of the
Czechoslovak Republic and to
provide a historical background
against which to examine the
recent events in that nation.
Dr. Jan Triska, of the Politi
cal Science Department, sketched
a short history of the Czech na
tion since its conception in 1918.
Triska sees the democratiza
tion of Czechoslovakia as having
its beginning in the failure of
the Stalinist economic organi
zation of 1948 to 1963. In 1963,
a reexamination of the system
led in part to the idea of de
centralization of planning, a step
away from strict Stalinist eco
nomics. This led to the idea that
it was possible to challenge the
system.

Consequently, new social
groups emerged. In the summer
of 1967, Czech writers organized
and demanded freedom of as
sembly and speech. Students fol
lowed in the fall with similar
demands. Both groups were sup
pressed by the harsh Novotny
regime.
But some communists in gov
ernment recognized that sup
pression was not the answer to
critical analysis. By January of
this year pressure for reform
was so great that Novotny was
forced to resign. The liberal
Alexander Dubcek took over
leadership.
Three major issues were un
der examination in the short
democratization period, feels
Triska. These were economic re
form, the possibility of having
democracy within the frame
work of a one-party system, and
the issue of federalism.
What should be recognized,
stated Dr. Gabriel Almond of
Political Science is that "the sur
vival of the spirit of democracy
is possible in a nation where it
has been denied." KQED (Chan
nel 9) General Manager James
Day added in this age of instant
communications "indifference is
a luxury we cannot afford."
ASSU President Denis Hayes
suggested the "Czechs now
know what Curtis LeMay means
by the term 'law and order.'"
The invasion has given a tre
mendous lift to the conservative,
anti-Soviet elements in this
country, he added and could lead
only to heightened international
tension and increased militarism
in the U.S.
David Riesman, professor of
Social Science at Harvard
warned that a cultural boycott
of the Soviet Union would not
help the Czech nation, but direct
declaration of our support is
necessary.

a short history of the Czech na
tion since its conception in 1918.
Triska sees the democratiza
tion of Czechoslovakia as having
its beginning in the failure of
the Stalinist economic organi
zation of 1948 to 1963. In 1963,
a reexamination of the system
led in part to the idea of de
centralization of planning, a step
away from strict Stalinist eco
nomics. This led to the idea that
it was possible to challenge the
system.

Consequently, new social
groups emerged. In the summer
of 1967, Czech writers organized
and demanded freedom of as
sembly and speech. Students fol
lowed in the fall with similar
demands. Both groups were sup
pressed by the harsh Novotny
regime.
But some communists in gov
ernment recognized that sup
pression was not the answer to
critical analysis. By January of
this year pressure for reform
was so great that Novotny was
forced to resign. The liberal
Alexander Dubcek took over
leadership.
Three major issues were un
der examination in the short
democratization period, feels
Triska. These were economic re
form, the possibility of having
democracy within the frame
work of a one-party system, and
the issue of federalism.
What should be recognized,
stated Dr. Gabriel Almond of
Political Science is that "the sur
vival of the spirit of democracy
is possible in a nation where it
has been denied." KQED (Chan
nel 9) General Manager James
Day added in this age of instant
communications "indifference is
a luxury we cannot afford."
ASSU President Denis Hayes
suggested the "Czechs now
know what Curtis LeMay means
by the term 'law and order.'"
The invasion has given a tre
mendous lift to the conservative,
anti-Soviet elements in this
country, he added and could lead
only to heightened international
tension and increased militarism
in the U.S.
David Riesman, professor of
Social Science at Harvard
warned that a cultural boycott
of the Soviet Union would not
help the Czech nation, but direct
declaration of our support is
necessary.
To celebrate the founding of
Czechoslovakia, discuss its his
tory and show sympathy for its
plight, seven prominent students
and professors addressed a
crowd of over a hundred at Me
morial Church Sunday night.
B. Davie Napier, Dean of the
Chapel, opened the discussion by
stating that acts of the United
States in Latin America and
Southeast Asia "tarnish Ameri
can support for Czech freedom."
Dr. Harry B. Friedgood, then
said the program was not in
tended to voice anger over the
Russian invasion. "No nation has
ever had the moral stature to
condemn another for any kind
of aggression," he declared.
Rather, the convocation was

called to celebrate the 50th anni
versary of the formation of the
Czechoslovak Republic and to
provide a historical background
against which to examine the
recent events in that nation.
