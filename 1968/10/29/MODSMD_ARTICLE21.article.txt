# History Reviewing Courses, Will Expand Black Studies
## 
### 
An expanded African history
and culture program and a
course review of the entire his
tory program are currently un
derway in the history depart
ment.
Selected history majors and
graduate students will work with
history professors and have an
equal vote in all committee de
cisions.
"African Civilization," a new
course taught by black Prof.
Kennel Johnson, will begin
spring quarter. Johnson is cur
rently in Africa and is sched
uled to join the Stanford faculty
at the close of winter quarter.
Assistant Prof. G. Wesley
Johnson, who is beginning his
third year at Stanford, requested
the addition of the course. For
merly visiting professor in Afri
can history at UCLA, he felt
that the Afro-American section
of the history department needed
significant improvement.

Two separate committees have
been established to evaluate the
entire history program, accord
ing to department head George
H. Knoles. Each group will con
sist of three professors and
three students.
Presently only the graduate
committee is conducting its
study. The undergraduate group
of professors are trying to de
cide how students should be cho
sen to serve on the committee.
"The review is not the result
of a confrontation," Knowles
said. He added that since the
students are the ones taking the
courses, they should be able to
help decide what courses there
are to take.
The review of both the grad
uate and undergraduate pro
grams should be completed by
the beginning of the winter
quarter, and changes will be
implemented at that time.
The undergraduate courses

were last reviewed in 1966. At
that time, the number of rigid
requirements for history majors
was reduced, and an independent
study and reading course was in
troduced.
The department now offers on
ly six courses in African history.
The most recent course, "The
History of North Africa," is be
ing taught by Prof. Patrick Man
ning.
This quarter the department
is offering an undergraduate col
loquim entitled, "The Negro in
America," which deals with the
problems of race relations and
the ghetto.
"Racism and Prejudice," a
much-publicized course, was
both organized and taught by
members of the history depart
ment.
