# Fund Cutback
## SLAC Shutdowns Continue 
### LANG ATWOOD 
Recent cutbacks in the Atomic
Energy Commission's (AEC)
budget by Congress have forced
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) to cancel plans
for extending its operating
schedule.
SLAC presently operates 24-
hours a day for eleven days then
shuts down for three days. Plans
called for operations to be ex
panded to a continuous schedule
with no shut-downs.
SLAC is comprised of a two
mile long travelling-wave elec
tron accelerator, two laboratory
areas and support facilities. It is
located on 480-acres of Stanford
land, about two miles from the
campus.
The Center was built and is
operated by Stanford for the
purpose of studying the proper
ties and behavior of matter in its
most fundamental forms. This
work is carried out under the
sponsorship of AEC, which fi
nances SLAC's operations.
Open Facilities
SLAC is known as a National
Facility for particle-physics re
search. It's facilities are open to
qualified scientists from any
where in the world.
Research has been carried out
by scientists from as far as the
Weisman Institute of Israel, as
well as physicists from 17 U.S.
universities and Stanford's own
SLAC staff.
Last week, Dr. O. V. Sorokin,
Senior Research Associate at the
Laboratory of Thermoelectricity
of the Institute of Semiconduct
ors at Leningrad, USSR, and Dr.
K. Takashita, Head of the Phys
ics Department at the University

of Hiroshima, Japan, toured the
facilities. Their tours of the U.S.
are sponsored by the National
Academy of Sciences (NAS).
Sorokin was in the company of
several men from the Stanford
Electronics Laboratories (SEL).
Although completely financed
by SEC, operating control is
vested in the Scientific Policy
Committee and the Program Ad
visory Committee. The policy
committee is composed of scien
tists from various institutions
hired by the President of Stan
ford University to supervise
SLAC. The committee reports
directly to the president who
has the final authority over all
SLAC operations. The program
committee screens proposals for
use of the accelerator and rec
ommends time allotments. SLAC
Director W.K.H. Panofsky heads
the committee. He is responsible
to the university president.
Proposal Approval
Scientific merit and time need
ed are the only criteria used to
determine who may use the ac
celerator. Everyone, including
SLAC staff, must submit a pro
posal to the program committee
for approval.
Stanford operates the accele
rator on contract from the AEC.
The contract, signed in April,
1962 is a "no gain—no loss" con
tract. The AEC provides all
funds for the operation of the
center while Stanford has leased
the land for 50 years and re
ceives some money to meet ex
penses that are incurred by the
accelerators existence.
No classified research has or
is being carried out, and accord
ing to the contract, any proposal

would have to be approved by
the Stanford Board of Trustees.
All work in the accelerator
labs is "pure science" and has
no practical application. Because
of this, none of the research is
classified and there are no se
curity restrictions on staff, em
ployees or visitors.
Speed Increase
At the beginning of the accele
rator, an electron gun injects
short bursts of electrons 360
times a second. After traveling
only 20 feet from the two-mile
tube, the electrons have reached
.999 the speed of light. There
after the power from the kly
stons adds little to their speed
but increases their mass. When
at full power (20 billion-electron
volts) the mass of an electron
has increased 40,000 times when
it reaches the laboratory area.
The accelerated electrons are
diverted by means of powerful
electromagnets into one of two
buildings where analyses are
made of the resulting creation
of new particles.
In 1947, a 12-foot accelerator
was built at Stanford by Pro
fessor William Hansen. This ma
chine produced 6 million elec
tron volts (MeV) and was known
as the Mark I.
In 1948, with support from the
Office of Naval Research (ONR)
work was begun on the Mark
11. In 1949, it had a peak power
output of almost 40 MeV.
Mark 111
Hansen died and his responsi
bilities were assumed by E. L.
Ginzton in 1949. A contract be
tween Stanford and ONR led
to the first billion-electron-volt
accelerator (BeV) the Mark 111.

By March, 1964 the Mark 111
was producing 1.2 BeV and was
the longest linear accelerator in
the world, 130 feet.
On April 18, 1957 a proposal
for the construction of a two
mile accelerator was submitted
by President Sterling to the
AEC. In 1960, Congress approved
funds for a study of SLAC. In
1961, Congress authorized $114
million for the project and con
struction began the following
year.
The site for the accelerator
was questioned initially because
the San Andreas fault lies only
500 yards from its west end.
Geologists determined, however,
that the accelerator tunnel would
be cut through one solid piece
of bedrock with no faults across
it. Since the completion of the
center, two major earthquakes
have occurred without affecting
the site. It is expected that a
serious earthquake would move
the entire rock and not break-up
the accelerator tunnel.
The accelerator was finished
and operated in July, 1966 four
years after groundbreaking. It
cost $114 million, exactly the
amount budgeted. This is be
lieved to be the first federal proj
ect in recent times to stay within
its authorized budget.
During construction a contro
versy arose over the installation
of the 220,000 volt power lines
the center needed. Woodside
township refused to give Pacific
Gas and Electric Company per
mission to bring the lines over
head through the township.
SLAC and AEC contended that
underground lines would be pro
hibitively expensive and unde
sirable from a maintenance
standpoint.

Reaching an impasse, it be
came necesary for Congress to
pass a special act condemning
the land for the right-of-way.
Special efforts were made so as
not to destroy the woods under
the lines. A helicopter was used
to install both the poles and
lines to minimize the destruction
of shrubbery.
SLAC employs 1200 people and
is toured each year by over 30,-
000 visitors. The public is wel
come. SLAC asks only that in
terested people call before they
come out.

times a second. After traveling
only 20 feet from the two-mile
tube, the electrons have reached
.999 the speed of light. There
after the power from the kly
stons adds little to their speed
but increases their mass. When
at full power (20 billion-electron
volts) the mass of an electron
has increased 40,000 times when
it reaches the laboratory area.
The accelerated electrons are
diverted by means of powerful
electromagnets into one of two
buildings where analyses are
made of the resulting creation
of new particles.
In 1947, a 12-foot accelerator
was built at Stanford by Pro
fessor William Hansen. This ma
chine produced 6 million elec
tron volts (MeV) and was known
as the Mark I.
In 1948, with support from the
Office of Naval Research (ONR)
work was begun on the Mark
11. In 1949, it had a peak power
output of almost 40 MeV.
Mark 111
Hansen died and his responsi
bilities were assumed by E. L.
Ginzton in 1949. A contract be
tween Stanford and ONR led
to the first billion-electron-volt
accelerator (BeV) the Mark 111.

By March, 1964 the Mark 111
was producing 1.2 BeV and was
the longest linear accelerator in
the world, 130 feet.
On April 18, 1957 a proposal
for the construction of a two
mile accelerator was submitted
by President Sterling to the
AEC. In 1960, Congress approved
funds for a study of SLAC. In
1961, Congress authorized $114
million for the project and con
struction began the following
year.
The site for the accelerator
was questioned initially because
the San Andreas fault lies only
500 yards from its west end.
Geologists determined, however,
that the accelerator tunnel would
be cut through one solid piece
of bedrock with no faults across
it. Since the completion of the
center, two major earthquakes
have occurred without affecting
the site. It is expected that a
serious earthquake would move
the entire rock and not break-up
the accelerator tunnel.
The accelerator was finished
and operated in July, 1966 four
years after groundbreaking. It
cost $114 million, exactly the
amount budgeted. This is be
lieved to be the first federal proj
ect in recent times to stay within
its authorized budget.
During construction a contro
versy arose over the installation
of the 220,000 volt power lines
the center needed. Woodside
township refused to give Pacific
Gas and Electric Company per
mission to bring the lines over
head through the township.
SLAC and AEC contended that
underground lines would be pro
hibitively expensive and unde
sirable from a maintenance
standpoint.

Reaching an impasse, it be
came necesary for Congress to
pass a special act condemning
the land for the right-of-way.
Special efforts were made so as
not to destroy the woods under
the lines. A helicopter was used
to install both the poles and
lines to minimize the destruction
of shrubbery.
SLAC employs 1200 people and
is toured each year by over 30,-
000 visitors. The public is wel
come. SLAC asks only that in
terested people call before they
come out.

Recent cutbacks in the Atomic
Energy Commission's (AEC)
budget by Congress have forced
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) to cancel plans
for extending its operating
schedule.
SLAC presently operates 24-
hours a day for eleven days then
shuts down for three days. Plans
called for operations to be ex
panded to a continuous schedule
with no shut-downs.
SLAC is comprised of a two
mile long travelling-wave elec
tron accelerator, two laboratory
areas and support facilities. It is
located on 480-acres of Stanford
land, about two miles from the
campus.
The Center was built and is
operated by Stanford for the
purpose of studying the proper
ties and behavior of matter in its
most fundamental forms. This
work is carried out under the
sponsorship of AEC, which fi
nances SLAC's operations.
Open Facilities
SLAC is known as a National
Facility for particle-physics re
search. It's facilities are open to
qualified scientists from any
where in the world.
Research has been carried out
by scientists from as far as the
Weisman Institute of Israel, as
well as physicists from 17 U.S.
universities and Stanford's own
SLAC staff.
Last week, Dr. O. V. Sorokin,
Senior Research Associate at the
Laboratory of Thermoelectricity
of the Institute of Semiconduct
ors at Leningrad, USSR, and Dr.
K. Takashita, Head of the Phys
ics Department at the University

of Hiroshima, Japan, toured the
facilities. Their tours of the U.S.
are sponsored by the National
Academy of Sciences (NAS).
Sorokin was in the company of
several men from the Stanford
Electronics Laboratories (SEL).
Although completely financed
by SEC, operating control is
vested in the Scientific Policy
Committee and the Program Ad
visory Committee. The policy
committee is composed of scien
tists from various institutions
hired by the President of Stan
ford University to supervise
SLAC. The committee reports
directly to the president who
has the final authority over all
SLAC operations. The program
committee screens proposals for
use of the accelerator and rec
ommends time allotments. SLAC
Director W.K.H. Panofsky heads
the committee. He is responsible
to the university president.
Proposal Approval
Scientific merit and time need
ed are the only criteria used to
determine who may use the ac
celerator. Everyone, including
SLAC staff, must submit a pro
posal to the program committee
for approval.
Stanford operates the accele
rator on contract from the AEC.
The contract, signed in April,
1962 is a "no gain—no loss" con
tract. The AEC provides all
funds for the operation of the
center while Stanford has leased
the land for 50 years and re
ceives some money to meet ex
penses that are incurred by the
accelerators existence.
No classified research has or
is being carried out, and accord
ing to the contract, any proposal

would have to be approved by
the Stanford Board of Trustees.
All work in the accelerator
labs is "pure science" and has
no practical application. Because
of this, none of the research is
classified and there are no se
curity restrictions on staff, em
ployees or visitors.

ALUMNUS HONORED—
ick Sietz, president of Rockefel
ler University, has been awarded
the Herbert Hoover Medal.
Recent cutbacks in the Atomic
Energy Commission's (AEC)
budget by Congress have forced
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) to cancel plans
for extending its operating
schedule.
SLAC presently operates 24-
hours a day for eleven days then
shuts down for three days. Plans
called for operations to be ex
panded to a continuous schedule
with no shut-downs.
SLAC is comprised of a two
mile long travelling-wave elec
tron accelerator, two laboratory
areas and support facilities. It is
located on 480-acres of Stanford
land, about two miles from the
campus.
The Center was built and is
operated by Stanford for the
purpose of studying the proper
ties and behavior of matter in its
most fundamental forms. This
work is carried out under the
sponsorship of AEC, which fi
nances SLAC's operations.
Open Facilities
SLAC is known as a National
Facility for particle-physics re
search. It's facilities are open to
qualified scientists from any
where in the world.
Research has been carried out
by scientists from as far as the
Weisman Institute of Israel, as
well as physicists from 17 U.S.
universities and Stanford's own
SLAC staff.
Last week, Dr. O. V. Sorokin,
Senior Research Associate at the
Laboratory of Thermoelectricity
of the Institute of Semiconduct
ors at Leningrad, USSR, and Dr.
K. Takashita, Head of the Phys
ics Department at the University

of Hiroshima, Japan, toured the
facilities. Their tours of the U.S.
are sponsored by the National
Academy of Sciences (NAS).
Sorokin was in the company of
several men from the Stanford
Electronics Laboratories (SEL).
Although completely financed
by SEC, operating control is
vested in the Scientific Policy
Committee and the Program Ad
visory Committee. The policy
committee is composed of scien
tists from various institutions
hired by the President of Stan
ford University to supervise
SLAC. The committee reports
directly to the president who
has the final authority over all
SLAC operations. The program
committee screens proposals for
use of the accelerator and rec
ommends time allotments. SLAC
Director W.K.H. Panofsky heads
the committee. He is responsible
to the university president.
Proposal Approval
Scientific merit and time need
ed are the only criteria used to
determine who may use the ac
celerator. Everyone, including
SLAC staff, must submit a pro
posal to the program committee
for approval.
Stanford operates the accele
rator on contract from the AEC.
The contract, signed in April,
1962 is a "no gain—no loss" con
tract. The AEC provides all
funds for the operation of the
center while Stanford has leased
the land for 50 years and re
ceives some money to meet ex
penses that are incurred by the
accelerators existence.
No classified research has or
is being carried out, and accord
ing to the contract, any proposal

would have to be approved by
the Stanford Board of Trustees.
All work in the accelerator
labs is "pure science" and has
no practical application. Because
of this, none of the research is
classified and there are no se
curity restrictions on staff, em
ployees or visitors.
Speed Increase
At the beginning of the accele
rator, an electron gun injects
short bursts of electrons 360
times a second. After traveling
only 20 feet from the two-mile
tube, the electrons have reached
.999 the speed of light. There
after the power from the kly
stons adds little to their speed
but increases their mass. When
at full power (20 billion-electron
volts) the mass of an electron
has increased 40,000 times when
it reaches the laboratory area.
The accelerated electrons are
diverted by means of powerful
electromagnets into one of two
buildings where analyses are
made of the resulting creation
of new particles.
In 1947, a 12-foot accelerator
was built at Stanford by Pro
fessor William Hansen. This ma
chine produced 6 million elec
tron volts (MeV) and was known
as the Mark I.
In 1948, with support from the
Office of Naval Research (ONR)
work was begun on the Mark
11. In 1949, it had a peak power
output of almost 40 MeV.
Mark 111
Hansen died and his responsi
bilities were assumed by E. L.
Ginzton in 1949. A contract be
tween Stanford and ONR led
to the first billion-electron-volt
accelerator (BeV) the Mark 111.

By March, 1964 the Mark 111
was producing 1.2 BeV and was
the longest linear accelerator in
the world, 130 feet.
On April 18, 1957 a proposal
for the construction of a two
mile accelerator was submitted
by President Sterling to the
AEC. In 1960, Congress approved
funds for a study of SLAC. In
1961, Congress authorized $114
million for the project and con
struction began the following
year.
The site for the accelerator
was questioned initially because
the San Andreas fault lies only
500 yards from its west end.
Geologists determined, however,
that the accelerator tunnel would
be cut through one solid piece
of bedrock with no faults across
it. Since the completion of the
center, two major earthquakes
have occurred without affecting
the site. It is expected that a
serious earthquake would move
the entire rock and not break-up
the accelerator tunnel.
The accelerator was finished
and operated in July, 1966 four
years after groundbreaking. It
cost $114 million, exactly the
amount budgeted. This is be
lieved to be the first federal proj
ect in recent times to stay within
its authorized budget.
During construction a contro
versy arose over the installation
of the 220,000 volt power lines
the center needed. Woodside
township refused to give Pacific
Gas and Electric Company per
mission to bring the lines over
head through the township.
SLAC and AEC contended that
underground lines would be pro
hibitively expensive and unde
sirable from a maintenance
standpoint.

Reaching an impasse, it be
came necesary for Congress to
pass a special act condemning
the land for the right-of-way.
Special efforts were made so as
not to destroy the woods under
the lines. A helicopter was used
to install both the poles and
lines to minimize the destruction
of shrubbery.
SLAC employs 1200 people and
is toured each year by over 30,-
000 visitors. The public is wel
come. SLAC asks only that in
terested people call before they
come out.

Speed Increase
At the beginning of the accele
rator, an electron gun injects
short bursts of electrons 360
times a second. After traveling
only 20 feet from the two-mile
tube, the electrons have reached
.999 the speed of light. There
after the power from the kly
stons adds little to their speed
but increases their mass. When
at full power (20 billion-electron
volts) the mass of an electron
has increased 40,000 times when
it reaches the laboratory area.
The accelerated electrons are
diverted by means of powerful
electromagnets into one of two
buildings where analyses are
made of the resulting creation
of new particles.
In 1947, a 12-foot accelerator
was built at Stanford by Pro
fessor William Hansen. This ma
chine produced 6 million elec
tron volts (MeV) and was known
as the Mark I.
In 1948, with support from the
Office of Naval Research (ONR)
work was begun on the Mark
11. In 1949, it had a peak power
output of almost 40 MeV.
Mark 111
Hansen died and his responsi
bilities were assumed by E. L.
Ginzton in 1949. A contract be
tween Stanford and ONR led
to the first billion-electron-volt
accelerator (BeV) the Mark 111.

By March, 1964 the Mark 111
was producing 1.2 BeV and was
the longest linear accelerator in
the world, 130 feet.
On April 18, 1957 a proposal
for the construction of a two
mile accelerator was submitted
by President Sterling to the
AEC. In 1960, Congress approved
funds for a study of SLAC. In
1961, Congress authorized $114
million for the project and con
struction began the following
year.
The site for the accelerator
was questioned initially because
the San Andreas fault lies only
500 yards from its west end.
Geologists determined, however,
that the accelerator tunnel would
be cut through one solid piece
of bedrock with no faults across
it. Since the completion of the
center, two major earthquakes
have occurred without affecting
the site. It is expected that a
serious earthquake would move
the entire rock and not break-up
the accelerator tunnel.
The accelerator was finished
and operated in July, 1966 four
years after groundbreaking. It
cost $114 million, exactly the
amount budgeted. This is be
lieved to be the first federal proj
ect in recent times to stay within
its authorized budget.
During construction a contro
versy arose over the installation
of the 220,000 volt power lines
the center needed. Woodside
township refused to give Pacific
Gas and Electric Company per
mission to bring the lines over
head through the township.
SLAC and AEC contended that
underground lines would be pro
hibitively expensive and unde
sirable from a maintenance
standpoint.

Reaching an impasse, it be
came necesary for Congress to
pass a special act condemning
the land for the right-of-way.
Special efforts were made so as
not to destroy the woods under
the lines. A helicopter was used
to install both the poles and
lines to minimize the destruction
of shrubbery.
SLAC employs 1200 people and
is toured each year by over 30,-
000 visitors. The public is wel
come. SLAC asks only that in
terested people call before they
come out.

Recent cutbacks in the Atomic
Energy Commission's (AEC)
budget by Congress have forced
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) to cancel plans
for extending its operating
schedule.
SLAC presently operates 24-
hours a day for eleven days then
shuts down for three days. Plans
called for operations to be ex
panded to a continuous schedule
with no shut-downs.
SLAC is comprised of a two
mile long travelling-wave elec
tron accelerator, two laboratory
areas and support facilities. It is
located on 480-acres of Stanford
land, about two miles from the
campus.
The Center was built and is
operated by Stanford for the
purpose of studying the proper
ties and behavior of matter in its
most fundamental forms. This
work is carried out under the
sponsorship of AEC, which fi
nances SLAC's operations.
Open Facilities
SLAC is known as a National
Facility for particle-physics re
search. It's facilities are open to
qualified scientists from any
where in the world.
Research has been carried out
by scientists from as far as the
Weisman Institute of Israel, as
well as physicists from 17 U.S.
universities and Stanford's own
SLAC staff.
Last week, Dr. O. V. Sorokin,
Senior Research Associate at the
Laboratory of Thermoelectricity
of the Institute of Semiconduct
ors at Leningrad, USSR, and Dr.
K. Takashita, Head of the Phys
ics Department at the University

of Hiroshima, Japan, toured the
facilities. Their tours of the U.S.
are sponsored by the National
Academy of Sciences (NAS).
Sorokin was in the company of
several men from the Stanford
Electronics Laboratories (SEL).
Although completely financed
by SEC, operating control is
vested in the Scientific Policy
Committee and the Program Ad
visory Committee. The policy
committee is composed of scien
tists from various institutions
hired by the President of Stan
ford University to supervise
SLAC. The committee reports
directly to the president who
has the final authority over all
SLAC operations. The program
committee screens proposals for
use of the accelerator and rec
ommends time allotments. SLAC
Director W.K.H. Panofsky heads
the committee. He is responsible
to the university president.
Proposal Approval
Scientific merit and time need
ed are the only criteria used to
determine who may use the ac
celerator. Everyone, including
SLAC staff, must submit a pro
posal to the program committee
for approval.
Stanford operates the accele
rator on contract from the AEC.
The contract, signed in April,
1962 is a "no gain—no loss" con
tract. The AEC provides all
funds for the operation of the
center while Stanford has leased
the land for 50 years and re
ceives some money to meet ex
penses that are incurred by the
accelerators existence.
No classified research has or
is being carried out, and accord
ing to the contract, any proposal

would have to be approved by
the Stanford Board of Trustees.
All work in the accelerator
labs is "pure science" and has
no practical application. Because
of this, none of the research is
classified and there are no se
curity restrictions on staff, em
ployees or visitors.
