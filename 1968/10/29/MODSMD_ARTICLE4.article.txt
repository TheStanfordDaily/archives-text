## Student Evaluations 
### BARBARA RITZ 
As a result of accelerated stu
dent and faculty incentive, uni
versity departments are incorpo
rating more students in their
decision-making processes.
Departmental committees com
prised of faculty, graduate, and
undergraduate students are be
ing formed, or are currently in
the planning stage, to review
such areas as undergraduate and
graduate curriculum, faculty ap
pointments, the advisory sys
tem, and graduate admissions
policy.
The biology department has
organized 4 standing commit
tees: a departmental policy com
mittee, a committee on under
graduate studies, a committee
on graduate studies, and a com
mittee on facilities in charge of
the library and operational as
pects of the biology building.
Professor Donald Kennedy,
head of the biology department
explained that the departmental
policy committee will review new
appointments to the department
and also major policy changes.
The other two committees in
clude reviewing the curriculum
and advising on both the under
graduate and graduate levels.
History Students Organize
The history department will
hold an organizational meeting
today at noon in the faculty club
to discuss its "standing liason
committee." The committee will
consist of 4 graduate students, 4

undergraduate students, and 3
faculty members. Its purpose
will be to discuss the academic
program in the history depart
ment as well as related matters.
Professor George Knoles, act
ing executive head of the depart
ment, commented that he want
ed to leave the committee as un
structured as possible in order
to utilize student suggestion as
to the possible areas for review
in the department.
The graduate student history
club last year organized them
selves to elect representatives to
the liason committee, he said.
In addition, a newly formed un
dergradaute history forum has
mado several student appoint
ments to the committee.
The English department has
organized five committees com
posed of graduate students and
faculty: a committee to review
the freshmen English program;
a departmental advisory com
mittee; a curriculum committee;
a committee to discuss honor
code violations; and a commit
tee in charge of the library.
According to Simpson, the or
ganization of these committees
is still in process. Although all
five committees consist only of
graduate students, the curricu
lum committee will be structured
to include a number of under
graduate students as well.
"Ad Hoe" Committees
Paul W. Berg, head of the
mathematics department, ex

plained that the department has
no formal committee of faculty
and students. He indicated that
various "ad hoc" committees are
set up whenever necessary to
discuss areas in the department,
like the honors program or the
departmental qualifying exam.
The math department's com
mittees do not include admis
sions and faculty appointments.
Professor Berg stressed individ
ual consultation of students with
faculty members rather than
formal student membership on
committees.
The music department will
hold a meeting Thursday to dis
cuss an election of new members
to its student-faculty advisory
committee. Professor William
Crosten, department, head, ex
plained that the committee of 4
undergraduate students, 3 grad
uate students, and 3 faculty
members had already been in
existence for several years.
Professor Walter Meyerhof of
the physics department indi
cated that proposals have been
made by the faculty to incorpo
rate students on faculty commit
tees.
The department has no struc
tured committee of student-fac
ulty members as of the present.
However, he explained that sev
eral of the ideas for reviewing
the department's curriculum
have been spurred by the SES
reports, rather than from stu
dent demand for revision.
