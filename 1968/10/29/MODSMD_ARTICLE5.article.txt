# Election Results
## 
### 
Last remaining hopes for the
possible reversal of the ASSU
election results were dashed yes
terday as the overseas campus
balloting finally was received.
Composite totals of all five
campuses revealed that no
changes in any results were
made and that the voting only
intensified an earlier sampling.
In specific issues both pro
posed Constitutions fell to de
feat as they had in the previous
home campus vote.
The ASSU constitution Propo
sal A, which drew from last
Spring's Constitutional Conven
tion and the Summer Legisla
ture under the leadership of
president Denis Hayes proposed
streamlining the present organi
zation and student control in as
sessing fees.
Constitution B, proposed by
the Committee for Student Re
sponsibility (CSR), calls for a
voluntary student union which
would enter into contractual
agreements with the faculty and
administration.
A two-thirds vote was re
quired for either Constitution.
Results show that the former
failed with 1028 students voting
in favor with 603 opposed. The
second proposal also failed to
get the necessary two-thirds
with a margin of 826 in favor
and 546 against.
Constitutional Proposition C
which would have established
the Hare System of proportion
representation fell with 477 in
favor and 1033 opposed.
Election returns were marked
ly different on the two remain
ing propositions, however, with

proposition 2 which encompassed
the recommendations of the
Committee of Fifteen receiving
approval by an overwhelming
margin of 1277 to 251.
Proposition 3 proposed that
"the students of Stanford Uni
versity support the boycott of
California table grapes and the
struggle of the United Farm
Workers for better working and
living conditions." The vote of
the proposal was 1191 for and
470 opposed.
