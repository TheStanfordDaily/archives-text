teachers thing their job security

Here at Stanford, Students for
a Democratic Society has mis
takenly addressed its demand
that Stanford get out of south
east Asia basically to "the Uni
versity," i.e., the administration.
But it is not administrators'
hands which are on the levers of
power.
Contracts for research are the
concern of the departments and
the faculty members 1 them
selves. And while some faculty
members may occasionally be
willing to back up the students
in an effort to decrease the
power of the administration,
they are less likely to take
power out of their own hands.
Faculty Conservatism
Last spring during the sit-in,
the closeness of the faculty's
vote on the issue of the student
judicial process was indicative
of the strength of faculty con
servatism. And that was on a
merely procedural issue, not a
substantive question about the
quality of education.
The example of Berkeley
should be kept in mind. In 1964,
the Academic Senate voted to
support the Free Speech Move
ment. But since that time the
UC faculty has not supported
student strikes or demonstra
tions.
The Study of Education at
Stanford suggests changes
which threaten to subvert the
faculty's feudal baronies and to
contaminate its hemetically
sealed departments. We have
already witnessed the beginning
of the machinations and power
plays as some faculty members
try to protect the status quo.
Neglect of Teaching
There are many good reasons
why undergraduate education at
Stanford is not as good as it
should be, and why teaching is
neglected for research.
Faculty members have a pay,
promotion, seniority, and job
security set-up that protects
them. Adequate faculty review
of teaching is impossible be
cause faculty members as a

Who is the enemy of change
here? The administration of this
university is usually the conven
ient enemy. Denunciation of the
administration is a touchstone
of the campus politics of both
students and faculty.
But while the administration
is certainly culpable, the bureau
cratic mentality, which sees any
alteration of the existing pattern
as a threat, can also be found
among the faculty.
Right now in New York City
the teachers' union is on strike.
The union thinks its power is
threatened by decentralization
of the educational system. The

matter of professional courtesy
do not sit in on each others'
classes. There is no mechanism
at Stanford whereby the stu
dents have a say in determining
who teaches.
As someone commented about
the New York teachers' strike,
no one is talking about due
process for the students.
If students can choose the
kind of education they expect
to receive by choosing to go to
a reputedly high quality, de
manding school like Stanford,
there should be, at the very
least, a way they can encourage
the kind of teaching which ful
fills their expectations.
Academic Freedom has be
come a catch phrase used to
justify a system of privilege and
petty interest group politics.
Governmental Structure
Student anger often focuses
on the Board of Trustees. People
look at charts depicting the gov
ernmental structure of the uni
versity and see a cabal of cor
porate executive at the top. But
the charts do not tell the whole
story. â€¢
Authority in the university is
derived from the complicity of
many, including faculty mem
bers. Viewing the American so
cial system as a whole, the resil
ience of state monopoly capital
ism seems to come from a
broadly based consensus about
hierarchical decision-making and
the uses of power. It is a con
sensus to which many faculty
members contribute.
There was a faculty search
committee which excluded stu
dents and which had a lot to do
with bringing Kenneth Pitzer to
Stanford. Many Stanford faculty
members are being seduced by
the military-industrial complex,
and they are loving it.
In sixteenth and seventeenth
century Europe, guilds were an
integral part of the repressive
social system of status and priv
ilege. Today conservatives and
corporate liberals in our own
guild of academicians have the
capability to fulfill the same
function.
