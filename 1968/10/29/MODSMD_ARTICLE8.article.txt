## Cranston For Senator 
### 
Alan Cranston is not a god.
But compared to Max Hafferty, lie almost is.
We do not wish to counsel voting for the lesser of two evils,
but in spite of his shortcomings, Cranston seems to us to escape
from being evil.
A journalist in his youth, Cranston covered the beginnings of
World War II in Europe and later served as head of the Army's
language office. Since the war he has been active in United World
Federalists, an organization dedicated to making the United Na
tions a more decisive force for peace. And his first book, "The
Killing of Peace," was a study of the U.S. Senate fight over the
League of Nations after World War I.
As State Controller from 1958 to 1967 Cranston reportedly
streamlined the running of the controller's office, and was active
in the California Democratic Council through 1965, though he
did not always agree with what the Council did.
Cranston has called for a bombing halt in Vietnam and home
rule for South Vietnam. And among the usual cant against riots
that politicians like to sing, Cranston points out that only by
solving the social and economic problems that breed unrest can
a permanent cure for violence be found. He supports gun control
and the right of farm workers to organize into unions.
Rafferty, on the other hand, has said that he would turn the
war in Vietnam over to the military men to let them end it as

quickly as possible, presumably with any sort of weapons they
thought they needed. On the problems of the cities and minority
groups Rafferty is especially insensitive to the needs of the times.
"We've got to start appointing Supreme Court Judges who are
more concerned about the innocent victims of violence than they
arc about the criminal," Rafferty says, placing himself on a par
with political thinkers like George Wallace.
In the face of a changing moral climate in which many Amer
icans are re-thinking their values, Rafferty says, "Our rapidly re
laxing moral fiber is affording modern muck merchants a not-to
be-missed opportunity to make a fast and filthy buck. I would
outlaw pornography, smutty films, dope . . ."
Rafferty was elected Superintendent of Public Instruction in
1962 and was reelected in 1966. A long-time teacher and admin
istrator, Rafferty renovated the school system of Needles, Califor
nia, during his tenure as superintendent there, though in earlier
positions he had been accused of laziness. Rafferty first gained
national prominence because of a 1961 speech delivered to a
meeting sponsored by La Canada School Board on, of all things,
patriotism.
Rafferty has sputtered elusively on the joys of being an Ameri
can iii this age. He seems not to know what America really
means.
We endorse Alan Cranston for U.S. Senator.

World War II in Europe and later served as head of the Army's
language office. Since the war he has been active in United World
Federalists, an organization dedicated to making the United Na
tions a more decisive force for peace. And his first book, "The
Killing of Peace," was a study of the U.S. Senate fight over the
League of Nations after World War I.
As State Controller from 1958 to 1967 Cranston reportedly
streamlined the running of the controller's office, and was active
in the California Democratic Council through 1965, though he
did not always agree with what the Council did.
Cranston has called for a bombing halt in Vietnam and home
rule for South Vietnam. And among the usual cant against riots
that politicians like to sing, Cranston points out that only by
solving the social and economic problems that breed unrest can
a permanent cure for violence be found. He supports gun control
and the right of farm workers to organize into unions.
Rafferty, on the other hand, has said that he would turn the
war in Vietnam over to the military men to let them end it as

quickly as possible, presumably with any sort of weapons they
thought they needed. On the problems of the cities and minority
groups Rafferty is especially insensitive to the needs of the times.
"We've got to start appointing Supreme Court Judges who are
more concerned about the innocent victims of violence than they
arc about the criminal," Rafferty says, placing himself on a par
with political thinkers like George Wallace.
In the face of a changing moral climate in which many Amer
icans are re-thinking their values, Rafferty says, "Our rapidly re
laxing moral fiber is affording modern muck merchants a not-to
be-missed opportunity to make a fast and filthy buck. I would
outlaw pornography, smutty films, dope . . ."
Rafferty was elected Superintendent of Public Instruction in
1962 and was reelected in 1966. A long-time teacher and admin
istrator, Rafferty renovated the school system of Needles, Califor
nia, during his tenure as superintendent there, though in earlier
positions he had been accused of laziness. Rafferty first gained
national prominence because of a 1961 speech delivered to a
meeting sponsored by La Canada School Board on, of all things,
patriotism.
Rafferty has sputtered elusively on the joys of being an Ameri
can iii this age. He seems not to know what America really
means.
We endorse Alan Cranston for U.S. Senator.
Alan Cranston is not a god.
But compared to Max Hafferty, lie almost is.
We do not wish to counsel voting for the lesser of two evils,
but in spite of his shortcomings, Cranston seems to us to escape
from being evil.
