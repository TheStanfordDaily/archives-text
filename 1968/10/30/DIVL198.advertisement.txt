"We are not yet satisfied with Hubert Humphrey's position on Vietnam, although we believe i
he is moving in the right direction. However, although Vietnam is a crucial issue, it is not the |
only issue.
We must not overlook the problem of social justice in America. Responsible black leaders tell
us that this nation can't afford four years of Nixon-type "law and order." We think they are I
right and we believe that Humphrey is the only candidate who offers an alternative to do
mestic violence and or repression.
If we are to survive, we must also consider the questions of nuclear proliferation and disarm

phrey has continually stressed the need for other solutions.
We do not believe a write-in vote will be effective, or that failure to vote is a meaningful pro- I
test.
We urge our fellow McCarthy voters to support Hubert Humphrey."
