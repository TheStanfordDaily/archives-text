# Berkeley Pair
## Fast Motivated By Strife 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Through the window you
could see tall banks of grey
clouds shrouding the Berkeley
hills in the midday gloom. The
rain continued to come and go
in cycles, lending a dull, dead
feeling to the scene.
Charles Palmer sat in his clut
tered office with several associ
ates, politely answering the im
polite question of the host of a
radio talk show, an oil painting
of the Golden Gate Bridge at
right on the wall behind him.
"Everybody agrees with us,"
he said sadly, "but they don't see
how we can win."
The President of the Associ
ated Students of the University
of California was several hours
into the second day of the hun
ger strike he and Konstantin
Beralndt,, Editor of the Daily
Callfomi'an, had begun Monday
to dramatize their concern over
the present situation at Berke
ley.
"The areas of participation of
of the students have been cut
off," Palmer continued. "We
have pursued every administra
tive channel available without
success. We just want them to
recognize us as human beings
and open up some area in which
we can participate."
'Nothing Left'
"There isn't anything left."
Palmer, obviously depressed,
was disappointed at the failure
of the strike called for Tuesday,
but felt no animosity toward
those who did not participate.
The purpose of his and Ber
landt's fast, he noted, was "to
have the outside community look
at what is going on here on the
basis of the issues and not the

tactics," to try to gain support
where the sit-ins in Sproul and
Moses Halls last week had lost
it.
He sympathized with those un
able to take action in support
of the various demands — credit
for Social Analysis 139 X, the
course in which Eldridge Cleaver
is scheduled to give ten lec
tures; no double jeopardy for
the students arrested in the sit
ins; and the review of University
Policy on admissions and em
ployment of minority group
members.
"They're looking around for
some alternative. There are
hardly any areas left for them to
participate in. They can drop out
or turn to violence, or they can
do the kind of thing we are do
ing.
"It's just a very nihilistic
thing. They just don't know how.
If we had a path which had any
chance of success we'd take it."
Some Action
But despite the ambivalence
of most of the student body, he
and Berlandt felt they had to
take some action.
"It's just something we've got
to do," Palmer added. "Who
knows what can have an effect
now. We're really not speaking
to the students. We're speaking
to the people of the state, the
people in power, and we're say
ing, 'goddamn it, we feel strong
ly enough to make this personal
sacrifice.' "
But to Palmer, the situation is
not good. "It's pretty hard to
be optimistic right now."

Four stories up, on the sixth
floor of Eshelman Hall, Berlandt
had just gotten up from a nap.

He took a stack of 45 rpm
records from his collection of
several hundred pop songs which
filled one cabinet and turned on
his stereo. With the music blast
ing away, Berlandt sat down at
his desk and began to type.
The late afternoon sun shown
through a window, San Francis
co Bay a sparkling orange sheet
in the distance.
On the walls were psychedelic
posters — including one of each
of the Beatles — as well as sev
eral dozen empty Marlboro
packs, stuck on with tape. A
telephone sat at the editor's feet
as he pounded away.
"The stereo cheers me up,"
Berlandt smiled, singing along
with the tunes every now and
then. "I think we all need cheer
ing up at this point."
"I feel a lot better after a
nap," he added, and immediately
picked up the phone and called
his partner in hunger suggesting
that he, too, catch some sleep.
"I think it's very difficult to es
timate how effective the strike
is, and I think it very unimport
ant. "The students and fac
ulty are united in their stand
against the Regents' resolution,
and the form of the protest is
unimportant."
Ineffectual
He, like Palmer, felt students
were justified in not joining the
strike at the present time. "Why
waste your life engaging in in
effectual political action?" he
said.
But he also noted that the
present conflict was a compli
cated one.
"It's not as simple a question
as it used to be — you just go
out and protest," Berlandt said.

"Todav, the University may col
lapse in the process, and most
people who protest do so because
they are concerned for the Uni
versity."
OIT Tactics
Bcrlandt had hopes the fast
would affect the Regents. "I
think this act will take their
minds off tactics and back to
the issues," he added.


MENLO COLLEGE —"A prep school with ashtrays" sent one seventh of its students to Stanford last
year. Operating on the theory that students' marks will improve if they are kept "under control on
campus," it's notorious for strict social rules.
"I think we're being optimistic
to say we can get what we want
out of this," he concluded. "But
I'm not interested in political
games — how many we can get
on the Board of Regents. I'm
interested in working toward a
humanistic society. I think we
all should be, because we've
moved too far away from it."

The Editorial Board of The
Stanford Daily has forwarded a
letter to the Regents of the Uni
versity of California voicing sup
port for the fast that Berlandt
and Palmer have begun. The let
ter read in part:
"This seems to us to be a posi
tive non-violent act to try to
get those parties of the Univer
sity who are involved talking
about the real issue at hand
academic freedom. Too much of
the recent talk centering around
Social Analysis 139 X has been
about the character of Eldridge
Cleaver and not enough about
the effects of outside influences
on the University.
"Please listen to these two
young men who fast . . ."

academic freedom. Too much of

on the University.

Through the window you

Charles Palmer sat in his clut
tered office with several associ
ates, politely answering the im
polite question of the host of a
radio talk show, an oil painting
of the Golden Gate Bridge at
right on the wall behind him.
"Everybody agrees with us,"
he said sadly, "but they don't see
how we can win."
The President of the Associ
ated Students of the University
of California was several hours
into the second day of the hun
ger strike he and Konstantin
Beralndt,, Editor of the Daily
Callfomi'an, had begun Monday
to dramatize their concern over
the present situation at Berke
ley.
"The areas of participation of
of the students have been cut
off," Palmer continued. "We
have pursued every administra
tive channel available without
success. We just want them to
recognize us as human beings
and open up some area in which
we can participate."
'Nothing Left'
"There isn't anything left."
Palmer, obviously depressed,
was disappointed at the failure
of the strike called for Tuesday,
but felt no animosity toward
those who did not participate.
The purpose of his and Ber
landt's fast, he noted, was "to
have the outside community look
at what is going on here on the
basis of the issues and not the

tactics," to try to gain support
where the sit-ins in Sproul and
Moses Halls last week had lost
it.
He sympathized with those un
able to take action in support
of the various demands — credit
for Social Analysis 139 X, the
course in which Eldridge Cleaver
is scheduled to give ten lec
tures; no double jeopardy for
the students arrested in the sit
ins; and the review of University
Policy on admissions and em
ployment of minority group
members.
"They're looking around for
some alternative. There are
hardly any areas left for them to
participate in. They can drop out
or turn to violence, or they can
do the kind of thing we are do
ing.
"It's just a very nihilistic
thing. They just don't know how.
If we had a path which had any
chance of success we'd take it."
Some Action
But despite the ambivalence
of most of the student body, he
and Berlandt felt they had to
take some action.
"It's just something we've got
to do," Palmer added. "Who
knows what can have an effect
now. We're really not speaking
to the students. We're speaking
to the people of the state, the
people in power, and we're say
ing, 'goddamn it, we feel strong
ly enough to make this personal
sacrifice.' "
But to Palmer, the situation is
not good. "It's pretty hard to
be optimistic right now."

Four stories up, on the sixth
floor of Eshelman Hall, Berlandt
had just gotten up from a nap.

He took a stack of 45 rpm
records from his collection of
several hundred pop songs which
filled one cabinet and turned on
his stereo. With the music blast
ing away, Berlandt sat down at
his desk and began to type.
The late afternoon sun shown
through a window, San Francis
co Bay a sparkling orange sheet
in the distance.
On the walls were psychedelic
posters — including one of each
of the Beatles — as well as sev
eral dozen empty Marlboro
packs, stuck on with tape. A
telephone sat at the editor's feet
as he pounded away.
"The stereo cheers me up,"
Berlandt smiled, singing along
with the tunes every now and
then. "I think we all need cheer
ing up at this point."
"I feel a lot better after a
nap," he added, and immediately
picked up the phone and called
his partner in hunger suggesting
that he, too, catch some sleep.
"I think it's very difficult to es
timate how effective the strike
is, and I think it very unimport
ant. "The students and fac
ulty are united in their stand
against the Regents' resolution,
and the form of the protest is
unimportant."
Ineffectual
He, like Palmer, felt students
were justified in not joining the
strike at the present time. "Why
waste your life engaging in in
effectual political action?" he
said.
But he also noted that the
present conflict was a compli
cated one.
"It's not as simple a question
as it used to be — you just go
out and protest," Berlandt said.

"Todav, the University may col
lapse in the process, and most
people who protest do so because
they are concerned for the Uni
versity."
OIT Tactics
Bcrlandt had hopes the fast
would affect the Regents. "I
think this act will take their
minds off tactics and back to
the issues," he added.


MENLO COLLEGE —"A prep school with ashtrays" sent one seventh of its students to Stanford last
year. Operating on the theory that students' marks will improve if they are kept "under control on
campus," it's notorious for strict social rules.
"I think we're being optimistic
to say we can get what we want
out of this," he concluded. "But
I'm not interested in political
games — how many we can get
on the Board of Regents. I'm
interested in working toward a
humanistic society. I think we
all should be, because we've
moved too far away from it."

and Palmer have begun. The let
ter read in part:
"This seems to us to be a posi

get those parties of the Univer
sity who are involved talking
about the real issue at hand
academic freedom. Too much of
the recent talk centering around
Social Analysis 139 X has been
about the character of Eldridge

Through the window you
could see tall banks of grey

Charles Palmer sat in his clut
tered office with several associ
ates, politely answering the im
polite question of the host of a
radio talk show, an oil painting
of the Golden Gate Bridge at
right on the wall behind him.
"Everybody agrees with us,"
he said sadly, "but they don't see
how we can win."
The President of the Associ
ated Students of the University
of California was several hours
into the second day of the hun
ger strike he and Konstantin
Beralndt,, Editor of the Daily
Callfomi'an, had begun Monday
to dramatize their concern over
the present situation at Berke
ley.
"The areas of participation of
of the students have been cut
off," Palmer continued. "We
have pursued every administra
tive channel available without
success. We just want them to
recognize us as human beings
and open up some area in which
we can participate."
'Nothing Left'
"There isn't anything left."
Palmer, obviously depressed,
was disappointed at the failure
of the strike called for Tuesday,
but felt no animosity toward
those who did not participate.
The purpose of his and Ber
landt's fast, he noted, was "to
have the outside community look
at what is going on here on the
basis of the issues and not the

tactics," to try to gain support
where the sit-ins in Sproul and
Moses Halls last week had lost
it.
He sympathized with those un
able to take action in support
of the various demands — credit
for Social Analysis 139 X, the
course in which Eldridge Cleaver
is scheduled to give ten lec
tures; no double jeopardy for
the students arrested in the sit
ins; and the review of University
Policy on admissions and em
ployment of minority group
members.
"They're looking around for
some alternative. There are
hardly any areas left for them to
participate in. They can drop out
or turn to violence, or they can
do the kind of thing we are do
ing.
"It's just a very nihilistic
thing. They just don't know how.
If we had a path which had any
chance of success we'd take it."
Some Action
But despite the ambivalence
of most of the student body, he
and Berlandt felt they had to
take some action.
"It's just something we've got
to do," Palmer added. "Who
knows what can have an effect
now. We're really not speaking
to the students. We're speaking
to the people of the state, the
people in power, and we're say
ing, 'goddamn it, we feel strong
ly enough to make this personal
sacrifice.' "
But to Palmer, the situation is
not good. "It's pretty hard to
be optimistic right now."

Four stories up, on the sixth
floor of Eshelman Hall, Berlandt
had just gotten up from a nap.

He took a stack of 45 rpm
records from his collection of
several hundred pop songs which
filled one cabinet and turned on
his stereo. With the music blast
ing away, Berlandt sat down at
his desk and began to type.
The late afternoon sun shown
through a window, San Francis
co Bay a sparkling orange sheet
in the distance.
On the walls were psychedelic
posters — including one of each
of the Beatles — as well as sev
eral dozen empty Marlboro
packs, stuck on with tape. A
telephone sat at the editor's feet
as he pounded away.
"The stereo cheers me up,"
Berlandt smiled, singing along
with the tunes every now and
then. "I think we all need cheer
ing up at this point."
"I feel a lot better after a
nap," he added, and immediately
picked up the phone and called
his partner in hunger suggesting
that he, too, catch some sleep.
"I think it's very difficult to es
timate how effective the strike
is, and I think it very unimport
ant. "The students and fac
ulty are united in their stand
against the Regents' resolution,
and the form of the protest is
unimportant."
Ineffectual
He, like Palmer, felt students
were justified in not joining the
strike at the present time. "Why
waste your life engaging in in
effectual political action?" he
said.
But he also noted that the
present conflict was a compli
cated one.
"It's not as simple a question
as it used to be — you just go
out and protest," Berlandt said.

"Todav, the University may col
lapse in the process, and most
people who protest do so because
they are concerned for the Uni
versity."
OIT Tactics
Bcrlandt had hopes the fast
would affect the Regents. "I
think this act will take their
minds off tactics and back to
the issues," he added.


MENLO COLLEGE —"A prep school with ashtrays" sent one seventh of its students to Stanford last
year. Operating on the theory that students' marks will improve if they are kept "under control on
campus," it's notorious for strict social rules.
"I think we're being optimistic
to say we can get what we want
out of this," he concluded. "But
I'm not interested in political
games — how many we can get
on the Board of Regents. I'm
interested in working toward a
humanistic society. I think we
all should be, because we've
moved too far away from it."
