# Feed Your Head
## Conservatives Viewed As Niggers 
### HARVEY H. HUKARI, JR 
During the past two weeks, a
whole new world of intellectual
masochism has opened up for
white liberals at Stanford. John
ie Scott, our very own black
militant, has started to write a
column for The Daily. Since
Ram's Head was unable to pro
vide enough money for the pro
duction of the play he wrote for
(laities, Mr. Scott has decided to
turn his attention and talents
to the task of exposing racism
wherever he can find it.
It is my prediction that his ef
forts will be met with over
whelming praise and enthusi
asm, not because Mr. Scott is a
very fine and interesting writer
or because his charges and reve
lations may be accurate but sim
ply because he is a black man
telling all those white liberals
and radicals how bigoted, preju
diced, morally corrupt and racist
they really are.
Naturally, they'll love it. To
understand the nature of the
white liberal's response to John
ie Scott or Eldridge Cleaver is
1o understand their curious need
to feel guilty. The vast bulk of
the Stanford student body comes
from that great morass of white
suburban ghettos circling our
major cities which are charac
terized by affluence, comfort and
sterility. After a few quarters
at the big university some stu
dents start becoming self con
sciously alienated and begin to
reject only the more crass as
pects of the cult of materialism
which spawned them.
Down The Row
They drive down the Row or
past Branner in their shiny Mus
tangs just like they used to
drive down the main street of
Winnetka or West Covina only
now they wear un-ironed blue
work shirts instead of stylish
turtlenecks. There aren't too
many pressing social problems
at Stanford but they soon learn
that if one wants to, one can be
concerned about social injustice
and it won't hurt a bit.
Every week some speaker
from the outside world will come
to Dinkelspiel or Cubberley and
share with them the vicarious
thrill of being an exploited grape
worker, in Delano, a downtrod
den peasant in Guatamala or a
black person living in poverty
and despair in East Oakland. Un
derstandibly, the average great

white hope for the future of
America becomes concerned. He
puts a Cranston sticker on the
back of his Pontiac and decides
not to eat grapes for an entire
week. Committment.
Yet with all of that there still
might be something missing,
something which can provide
that pleasant feeling of guilt on
a regular basis, and then along
comes Mr. Scott with his col
umn. Yessuh, good ol' Johnie
Scott is sure an expert at whip
ping the consciences of all those
liberal white folks at Stanford
who need to feel guilty about
th fact that they're white and
Johnie Scott is not. Why, on the
days when his column appears
in the paper, you can hear the
screams of ecstasy from all over
campus, "Oh, hit me again John
ie, it feels so good."
Disquieting
What is so disquieting about
this phenomenon is that there
are many here among us who
are perfectly willing to accept
Mr. Scott's charge that Stanford
is a racist institution which is
committing cultural genocide
against black people. No thought
is given to the possibility that
the real discrimination which
exists at this university is
against creativity, free thinking
and those who refuse to accept
the intellectual dictums handed
down by a liberal academic es
tablishment.
Listen, Johnie Scott, as far as
Stanford is concerned, you are
one of the chosen few. Those
liberal white administrators and
professors are going to do every
thing they can to make life beau
tiful for you. They're going to
give scholarships to your black
brothers and sisters, offer them
employment, listen to your com
plaints and demands and point
to you proudly as fine examples
of how liberal they really are.
And the only thing you have to
do is make them feel guilty.
You, Johnie Scott may be sick
of all those stereotyped visions
in which blacks eat watermelons,
lust after white women, tap
dance and pick cotton. Well I'm
sick of all those stereotypes of
Conservatives in which they are
portrayed as greedy, sexually
obsessed businessmen, puritani
cal little old ladies with hair
growing out of their ears and
trigger-happy Army generals

who arc paranoid about Commu
nism.
No Longer Black
The niggers at Stanford are
no longer black students, they're
conservatives. The administra
tion doesn't give a damn about
the moderates or the conserva
tives on campus because they
know that we're not going to sit
in the Old Union or try to burn
down Encina Hall. You're sick
of racism and I'm sick of having
to be exposed to the intellectual
hypocrisy vomited forth daily in
classrooms all around the Quad
by professors who make snide
references to Ronald Reagan,
misrepresent the meaning of
conservatism, allow their T.A.'s
to make appeals for the Peace
and Freedom Party in class and
treat students who may profess
a certain affinity for free enter
prise and individual responsibili
ty with the condescending atti
tude which one reserves for the
mentally retarded.
I'm sick of being taught by
those refugees from reality,
whose only saving grace is that
they have tenure, and then being
told that I'm receiving a liberal
education. I'm sick of seeing po
litical work for liberal candi
dates being done by University
employees on University time
and with University facilities.
Richard Nixon is supposed to be

selling out to the racists because
he chose Spiro Agnew as his
running mate, but no liberal pro
fessor ever bothered to explain
to me why that great liberal Ad
lai Stevenson wasn't being a
racist when he took John Spark
man of Alabama as his vice
presidential candidate in 1952.
I'm tired of professors who
speak strongly about academic
freedom and then assign a read
ing list which does not contain
one author whose political phi
losophy is to the right of Rani
parts magazine. The Black Stu
dent Union wants to know how
many black people are in teach
ing positions at Stanford. I want
to know how many Republicans
there are on the faculty of the
political science department.

You think having black skin
is some kind of a drawback here,
try wearing a Nixon button to
class. If you try to point out
that Barry Goldwater had some
valid programs for ending the
draft and curtailing the growth
of government power, your fel
low students smile and shake
their heads in mock pity. If you
acknowledge in class that you
are a conservative, immediately
you are marked as a Bircher, a
racist, an advocate of nuclear
bombing and as a fundamental
ist Baptist.
You think that black people,
are the only ones who have
trouble with discrimination and
stereotypes in an academic com
munity? Pass that watermelon
over this wav, Johnie.

Listen, Johnie Scott, as far as
Stanford is concerned, you are
one of the chosen few. Those
liberal white administrators and
professors are going to do every
thing they can to make life beau
tiful for you. They're going to
give scholarships to your black
brothers and sisters, offer them
employment, listen to your com
plaints and demands and point
to you proudly as fine examples
of how liberal they really are.
And the only thing you have to
do is make them feel guilty.
You, Johnie Scott may be sick
of all those stereotyped visions
in which blacks eat watermelons,
lust after white women, tap
dance and pick cotton. Well I'm
sick of all those stereotypes of
Conservatives in which they are
portrayed as greedy, sexually
obsessed businessmen, puritani
cal little old ladies with hair
growing out of their ears and
trigger-happy Army generals

who arc paranoid about Commu
nism.
No Longer Black
The niggers at Stanford are
no longer black students, they're
conservatives. The administra
tion doesn't give a damn about
the moderates or the conserva
tives on campus because they
know that we're not going to sit
in the Old Union or try to burn
down Encina Hall. You're sick
of racism and I'm sick of having
to be exposed to the intellectual
hypocrisy vomited forth daily in
classrooms all around the Quad
by professors who make snide
references to Ronald Reagan,
misrepresent the meaning of
conservatism, allow their T.A.'s
to make appeals for the Peace
and Freedom Party in class and
treat students who may profess
a certain affinity for free enter
prise and individual responsibili
ty with the condescending atti
tude which one reserves for the
mentally retarded.
I'm sick of being taught by
those refugees from reality,
whose only saving grace is that
they have tenure, and then being
told that I'm receiving a liberal
education. I'm sick of seeing po
litical work for liberal candi
dates being done by University
employees on University time
and with University facilities.
Richard Nixon is supposed to be

selling out to the racists because
he chose Spiro Agnew as his
running mate, but no liberal pro
fessor ever bothered to explain
to me why that great liberal Ad
lai Stevenson wasn't being a
racist when he took John Spark
man of Alabama as his vice
presidential candidate in 1952.
I'm tired of professors who
speak strongly about academic
freedom and then assign a read
ing list which does not contain
one author whose political phi
losophy is to the right of Rani
parts magazine. The Black Stu
dent Union wants to know how
many black people are in teach
ing positions at Stanford. I want
to know how many Republicans
there are on the faculty of the
political science department.

You think having black skin
is some kind of a drawback here,
try wearing a Nixon button to
class. If you try to point out
that Barry Goldwater had some
valid programs for ending the
draft and curtailing the growth
of government power, your fel
low students smile and shake
their heads in mock pity. If you
acknowledge in class that you
are a conservative, immediately
you are marked as a Bircher, a
racist, an advocate of nuclear
bombing and as a fundamental
ist Baptist.
You think that black people,
are the only ones who have
trouble with discrimination and
stereotypes in an academic com
munity? Pass that watermelon
over this wav, Johnie.
During the past two weeks, a
whole new world of intellectual
masochism has opened up for
white liberals at Stanford. John
ie Scott, our very own black
militant, has started to write a
column for The Daily. Since
Ram's Head was unable to pro
vide enough money for the pro
duction of the play he wrote for
(laities, Mr. Scott has decided to
turn his attention and talents
to the task of exposing racism
wherever he can find it.
It is my prediction that his ef
forts will be met with over
whelming praise and enthusi
asm, not because Mr. Scott is a
very fine and interesting writer
or because his charges and reve
lations may be accurate but sim
ply because he is a black man
telling all those white liberals
and radicals how bigoted, preju
diced, morally corrupt and racist
they really are.
Naturally, they'll love it. To
understand the nature of the
white liberal's response to John
ie Scott or Eldridge Cleaver is
1o understand their curious need
to feel guilty. The vast bulk of
the Stanford student body comes
from that great morass of white
suburban ghettos circling our
major cities which are charac
terized by affluence, comfort and
sterility. After a few quarters
at the big university some stu
dents start becoming self con
sciously alienated and begin to
reject only the more crass as
pects of the cult of materialism
which spawned them.
Down The Row
They drive down the Row or
past Branner in their shiny Mus
tangs just like they used to
drive down the main street of
Winnetka or West Covina only
now they wear un-ironed blue
work shirts instead of stylish
turtlenecks. There aren't too
many pressing social problems
at Stanford but they soon learn
that if one wants to, one can be
concerned about social injustice
and it won't hurt a bit.
Every week some speaker
from the outside world will come
to Dinkelspiel or Cubberley and
share with them the vicarious
thrill of being an exploited grape
worker, in Delano, a downtrod
den peasant in Guatamala or a
black person living in poverty
and despair in East Oakland. Un
derstandibly, the average great

white hope for the future of
America becomes concerned. He
puts a Cranston sticker on the
back of his Pontiac and decides
not to eat grapes for an entire
week. Committment.
Yet with all of that there still
might be something missing,
something which can provide
that pleasant feeling of guilt on
a regular basis, and then along
comes Mr. Scott with his col
umn. Yessuh, good ol' Johnie
Scott is sure an expert at whip
ping the consciences of all those
liberal white folks at Stanford
who need to feel guilty about
th fact that they're white and
Johnie Scott is not. Why, on the
days when his column appears
in the paper, you can hear the
screams of ecstasy from all over
campus, "Oh, hit me again John
ie, it feels so good."
Disquieting
What is so disquieting about
this phenomenon is that there
are many here among us who
are perfectly willing to accept
Mr. Scott's charge that Stanford
is a racist institution which is
committing cultural genocide
against black people. No thought
is given to the possibility that
the real discrimination which
exists at this university is
against creativity, free thinking
and those who refuse to accept
the intellectual dictums handed
down by a liberal academic es
tablishment.

white liberals at Stanford. John
ie Scott, our very own black
militant, has started to write a
column for The Daily. Since
Ram's Head was unable to pro
vide enough money for the pro
duction of the play he wrote for
(laities, Mr. Scott has decided to
turn his attention and talents
to the task of exposing racism
wherever he can find it.
It is my prediction that his ef
forts will be met with over
whelming praise and enthusi
asm, not because Mr. Scott is a
very fine and interesting writer
or because his charges and reve
lations may be accurate but sim
ply because he is a black man
telling all those white liberals
and radicals how bigoted, preju
diced, morally corrupt and racist
they really are.
Naturally, they'll love it. To
understand the nature of the
white liberal's response to John
ie Scott or Eldridge Cleaver is
1o understand their curious need
to feel guilty. The vast bulk of
the Stanford student body comes
from that great morass of white
suburban ghettos circling our
major cities which are charac
terized by affluence, comfort and
sterility. After a few quarters
at the big university some stu
dents start becoming self con
sciously alienated and begin to
reject only the more crass as
pects of the cult of materialism
which spawned them.
Down The Row
They drive down the Row or
past Branner in their shiny Mus
tangs just like they used to
drive down the main street of
Winnetka or West Covina only
now they wear un-ironed blue
work shirts instead of stylish
turtlenecks. There aren't too
many pressing social problems
at Stanford but they soon learn
that if one wants to, one can be
concerned about social injustice
and it won't hurt a bit.
Every week some speaker
from the outside world will come
to Dinkelspiel or Cubberley and
share with them the vicarious
thrill of being an exploited grape
worker, in Delano, a downtrod
den peasant in Guatamala or a
black person living in poverty
and despair in East Oakland. Un
derstandibly, the average great

white hope for the future of
America becomes concerned. He
puts a Cranston sticker on the
back of his Pontiac and decides
not to eat grapes for an entire
week. Committment.
Yet with all of that there still
might be something missing,
something which can provide
that pleasant feeling of guilt on
a regular basis, and then along
comes Mr. Scott with his col
umn. Yessuh, good ol' Johnie
Scott is sure an expert at whip
ping the consciences of all those
liberal white folks at Stanford
who need to feel guilty about
th fact that they're white and
Johnie Scott is not. Why, on the
days when his column appears
in the paper, you can hear the
screams of ecstasy from all over
campus, "Oh, hit me again John
ie, it feels so good."
Disquieting
What is so disquieting about
this phenomenon is that there
are many here among us who
are perfectly willing to accept
Mr. Scott's charge that Stanford
is a racist institution which is
committing cultural genocide
against black people. No thought
is given to the possibility that
the real discrimination which
exists at this university is
against creativity, free thinking
and those who refuse to accept
the intellectual dictums handed
down by a liberal academic es
tablishment.
Listen, Johnie Scott, as far as
Stanford is concerned, you are
one of the chosen few. Those
liberal white administrators and
professors are going to do every
thing they can to make life beau
tiful for you. They're going to
give scholarships to your black
brothers and sisters, offer them
employment, listen to your com
plaints and demands and point
to you proudly as fine examples
of how liberal they really are.
And the only thing you have to
do is make them feel guilty.
You, Johnie Scott may be sick
of all those stereotyped visions
in which blacks eat watermelons,
lust after white women, tap
dance and pick cotton. Well I'm
sick of all those stereotypes of
Conservatives in which they are
portrayed as greedy, sexually
obsessed businessmen, puritani
cal little old ladies with hair
growing out of their ears and
trigger-happy Army generals

who arc paranoid about Commu
nism.
No Longer Black
The niggers at Stanford are
no longer black students, they're
conservatives. The administra
tion doesn't give a damn about
the moderates or the conserva
tives on campus because they
know that we're not going to sit
in the Old Union or try to burn
down Encina Hall. You're sick
of racism and I'm sick of having
to be exposed to the intellectual
hypocrisy vomited forth daily in
classrooms all around the Quad
by professors who make snide
references to Ronald Reagan,
misrepresent the meaning of
conservatism, allow their T.A.'s
to make appeals for the Peace
and Freedom Party in class and
treat students who may profess
a certain affinity for free enter
prise and individual responsibili
ty with the condescending atti
tude which one reserves for the
mentally retarded.
I'm sick of being taught by
those refugees from reality,
whose only saving grace is that
they have tenure, and then being
told that I'm receiving a liberal
education. I'm sick of seeing po
litical work for liberal candi
dates being done by University
employees on University time
and with University facilities.
Richard Nixon is supposed to be

selling out to the racists because
he chose Spiro Agnew as his
running mate, but no liberal pro
fessor ever bothered to explain
to me why that great liberal Ad
lai Stevenson wasn't being a
racist when he took John Spark
man of Alabama as his vice
presidential candidate in 1952.
I'm tired of professors who
speak strongly about academic
freedom and then assign a read
ing list which does not contain
one author whose political phi
losophy is to the right of Rani
parts magazine. The Black Stu
dent Union wants to know how
many black people are in teach
ing positions at Stanford. I want
to know how many Republicans
there are on the faculty of the
political science department.

You think having black skin
is some kind of a drawback here,
try wearing a Nixon button to
class. If you try to point out
that Barry Goldwater had some
valid programs for ending the
draft and curtailing the growth
of government power, your fel
low students smile and shake
their heads in mock pity. If you
acknowledge in class that you
are a conservative, immediately
you are marked as a Bircher, a
racist, an advocate of nuclear
bombing and as a fundamental
ist Baptist.
You think that black people,
are the only ones who have
trouble with discrimination and
stereotypes in an academic com
munity? Pass that watermelon
over this wav, Johnie.

professors are going to do every
thing they can to make life beau
tiful for you. They're going to
give scholarships to your black
brothers and sisters, offer them
employment, listen to your com
plaints and demands and point
to you proudly as fine examples
of how liberal they really are.
And the only thing you have to
do is make them feel guilty.
You, Johnie Scott may be sick
of all those stereotyped visions
in which blacks eat watermelons,
lust after white women, tap
dance and pick cotton. Well I'm
sick of all those stereotypes of
Conservatives in which they are
portrayed as greedy, sexually
obsessed businessmen, puritani
cal little old ladies with hair
growing out of their ears and
trigger-happy Army generals

who arc paranoid about Commu
nism.
No Longer Black
The niggers at Stanford are
no longer black students, they're
conservatives. The administra
tion doesn't give a damn about
the moderates or the conserva
tives on campus because they
know that we're not going to sit
in the Old Union or try to burn
down Encina Hall. You're sick
of racism and I'm sick of having
to be exposed to the intellectual
hypocrisy vomited forth daily in
classrooms all around the Quad
by professors who make snide
references to Ronald Reagan,
misrepresent the meaning of
conservatism, allow their T.A.'s
to make appeals for the Peace
and Freedom Party in class and
treat students who may profess
a certain affinity for free enter
prise and individual responsibili
ty with the condescending atti
tude which one reserves for the
mentally retarded.
I'm sick of being taught by
those refugees from reality,
whose only saving grace is that
they have tenure, and then being
told that I'm receiving a liberal
education. I'm sick of seeing po
litical work for liberal candi
dates being done by University
employees on University time
and with University facilities.
Richard Nixon is supposed to be

selling out to the racists because
he chose Spiro Agnew as his
running mate, but no liberal pro
fessor ever bothered to explain
to me why that great liberal Ad
lai Stevenson wasn't being a
racist when he took John Spark
man of Alabama as his vice
presidential candidate in 1952.
I'm tired of professors who
speak strongly about academic
freedom and then assign a read
ing list which does not contain
one author whose political phi
losophy is to the right of Rani
parts magazine. The Black Stu
dent Union wants to know how
many black people are in teach
ing positions at Stanford. I want
to know how many Republicans
there are on the faculty of the
political science department.

You think having black skin
is some kind of a drawback here,
try wearing a Nixon button to
class. If you try to point out
that Barry Goldwater had some
valid programs for ending the
draft and curtailing the growth
of government power, your fel
low students smile and shake
their heads in mock pity. If you
acknowledge in class that you
are a conservative, immediately
you are marked as a Bircher, a
racist, an advocate of nuclear
bombing and as a fundamental
ist Baptist.
You think that black people,
are the only ones who have
trouble with discrimination and
stereotypes in an academic com
munity? Pass that watermelon
over this wav, Johnie.
During the past two weeks, a
whole new world of intellectual
masochism has opened up for
white liberals at Stanford. John
ie Scott, our very own black
militant, has started to write a
column for The Daily. Since
Ram's Head was unable to pro
vide enough money for the pro
duction of the play he wrote for
(laities, Mr. Scott has decided to
turn his attention and talents
to the task of exposing racism
wherever he can find it.
It is my prediction that his ef
forts will be met with over
whelming praise and enthusi
asm, not because Mr. Scott is a
very fine and interesting writer
or because his charges and reve
lations may be accurate but sim
ply because he is a black man
telling all those white liberals
and radicals how bigoted, preju
diced, morally corrupt and racist
they really are.
Naturally, they'll love it. To
understand the nature of the
white liberal's response to John
ie Scott or Eldridge Cleaver is
1o understand their curious need
to feel guilty. The vast bulk of
the Stanford student body comes
from that great morass of white
suburban ghettos circling our
major cities which are charac
terized by affluence, comfort and
sterility. After a few quarters
at the big university some stu
dents start becoming self con
sciously alienated and begin to
reject only the more crass as
pects of the cult of materialism
which spawned them.
Down The Row
They drive down the Row or
past Branner in their shiny Mus
tangs just like they used to
drive down the main street of
Winnetka or West Covina only
now they wear un-ironed blue
work shirts instead of stylish
turtlenecks. There aren't too
many pressing social problems
at Stanford but they soon learn
that if one wants to, one can be
concerned about social injustice
and it won't hurt a bit.
Every week some speaker
from the outside world will come
to Dinkelspiel or Cubberley and
share with them the vicarious
thrill of being an exploited grape
worker, in Delano, a downtrod
den peasant in Guatamala or a
black person living in poverty
and despair in East Oakland. Un
derstandibly, the average great

white hope for the future of
America becomes concerned. He
puts a Cranston sticker on the
back of his Pontiac and decides
not to eat grapes for an entire
week. Committment.
Yet with all of that there still
might be something missing,
something which can provide
that pleasant feeling of guilt on
a regular basis, and then along
comes Mr. Scott with his col
umn. Yessuh, good ol' Johnie
Scott is sure an expert at whip
ping the consciences of all those
liberal white folks at Stanford
who need to feel guilty about
th fact that they're white and
Johnie Scott is not. Why, on the
days when his column appears
in the paper, you can hear the
screams of ecstasy from all over
campus, "Oh, hit me again John
ie, it feels so good."
Disquieting
What is so disquieting about
this phenomenon is that there
are many here among us who
are perfectly willing to accept
Mr. Scott's charge that Stanford
is a racist institution which is
committing cultural genocide
against black people. No thought
is given to the possibility that
the real discrimination which
exists at this university is
against creativity, free thinking
and those who refuse to accept
the intellectual dictums handed
down by a liberal academic es
tablishment.
Listen, Johnie Scott, as far as
Stanford is concerned, you are
one of the chosen few. Those
liberal white administrators and
professors are going to do every
thing they can to make life beau
tiful for you. They're going to
give scholarships to your black
brothers and sisters, offer them
employment, listen to your com
plaints and demands and point
to you proudly as fine examples
of how liberal they really are.
