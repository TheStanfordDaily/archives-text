# THE 						FRESH EYE

### DAN MELLINKOFF 
Every Tuesday night the
wretches of Stanford University
made the painful trek to the Un
dergraduate Library, settling
into chairs, striving to stay
awake. One Tuesday — Oct. 15,
1968 in the year of our Lord —
they revolted.
Lulled by the air conditioner,
the sound of little hands turn
ing pages, and the meallic-brown
walls, the students labored.
Turning the pages — pausing,
marking down all significant de
tails with their yellow pen, they
worked into the evening. Fasti
diously immersed in tedious
work, they submerged any
thoughts.
Students were not created to
sit — ratiocinating trivalities —
irrelevant and poorly written
necessities. Students were never
suited to study as such. Yet
there they sat; driven to the li
brary because any other place
would prove too much a distrac
tion for such uninteresting read
ing.
Doldrums settled in the li
brary. A calm before the unex
pected storm. As the silence be
came deepest, a scratching, rat
tling sound was heard within
(he groin of the library. Ears
awoke. A few trailed off from
reading in anticipation. And
then it came. . . . (the voice of
God, booming.)
"WILL JACK GOKEN COME
TO THE RESERVE DESK."
One student, perhaps reading
a passage of Spinoza's, stood up
— abandoning his work — and
peered over the railing down to
the main floor. Then another, a
freshman reading his Western
Civ., put down his book. The mo
ment was long awaited. For

with feverish haste other stu
dents stood up to spite their
books and glanced below. The
insurgency began.
The rebels, spying each other
and discerning friends, shouted
down the sterile quiet. Others
sitting close to the fringes be
came alerted, rose and walked
to the ledges, viewing the stu
dents below — greeting their
comrades in revolution. The air
swirled with a rare sound of
laughter, wild applause, and
frenzied singing. Glancing up
from their work, safe in their
womb, a few curious ones open
ed the glass doors. Seven min
utes later the library ceased to
be a library — a place of dusty
books, silent reading, and quiet.
The rabble increased as stu
dents forgot for a moment that
they were there to study, becom
ing human again. Wild applause
greeted Jack Goken's entrance
onto the scene. He was, in fact,
their inadvertant savior.
As the minutes wore on, the
idealism that so often greets a
revolt began to fade. The re
membrance of their purpose be
gan to creep back; reseated a
few began to begin again. Medi
ocrity crept back. The strings,
bourgeosie reverance of order
and pattern, proved too strong.
The tumult died.
I am sure that for a few this
phenomenaum lasted. Some left
the library, intent to junk it all
and read something fertile, or do
something even more fertile.
More Tuesdays will come, and
this night will fade into dust:
But the cry of the name, Jack
Goken, shall rest in eternity in
the spirits of the souls, freed
for a moment from suffering.

few began to begin again. Medi
ocrity crept back. The strings,
bourgeosie reverance of order
and pattern, proved too strong.
The tumult died.
I am sure that for a few this
phenomenaum lasted. Some left
the library, intent to junk it all
and read something fertile, or do
something even more fertile.

But the cry of the name, Jack
Goken, shall rest in eternity in

Every Tuesday night the
wretches of Stanford University
made the painful trek to the Un
dergraduate Library, settling
into chairs, striving to stay
awake. One Tuesday — Oct. 15,
1968 in the year of our Lord —
they revolted.
Lulled by the air conditioner,
the sound of little hands turn
ing pages, and the meallic-brown
walls, the students labored.
Turning the pages — pausing,
marking down all significant de
tails with their yellow pen, they
worked into the evening. Fasti
diously immersed in tedious
work, they submerged any
thoughts.
Students were not created to
sit — ratiocinating trivalities —
irrelevant and poorly written
necessities. Students were never
suited to study as such. Yet
there they sat; driven to the li
brary because any other place
would prove too much a distrac
tion for such uninteresting read
ing.
Doldrums settled in the li
brary. A calm before the unex
pected storm. As the silence be
came deepest, a scratching, rat
tling sound was heard within
(he groin of the library. Ears
awoke. A few trailed off from
reading in anticipation. And
then it came. . . . (the voice of
God, booming.)
"WILL JACK GOKEN COME
TO THE RESERVE DESK."
One student, perhaps reading
a passage of Spinoza's, stood up
— abandoning his work — and
peered over the railing down to
the main floor. Then another, a
freshman reading his Western
Civ., put down his book. The mo
ment was long awaited. For

with feverish haste other stu
dents stood up to spite their
books and glanced below. The
insurgency began.
The rebels, spying each other
and discerning friends, shouted
down the sterile quiet. Others
sitting close to the fringes be
came alerted, rose and walked
to the ledges, viewing the stu
dents below — greeting their
comrades in revolution. The air
swirled with a rare sound of
laughter, wild applause, and
frenzied singing. Glancing up
from their work, safe in their
womb, a few curious ones open
ed the glass doors. Seven min
utes later the library ceased to
be a library — a place of dusty
books, silent reading, and quiet.
The rabble increased as stu
dents forgot for a moment that
they were there to study, becom
ing human again. Wild applause
greeted Jack Goken's entrance
onto the scene. He was, in fact,
their inadvertant savior.
As the minutes wore on, the
idealism that so often greets a
revolt began to fade. The re
membrance of their purpose be
gan to creep back; reseated a
few began to begin again. Medi
ocrity crept back. The strings,
bourgeosie reverance of order
and pattern, proved too strong.
