# Communist Party Candidate Raps 'Capitalist University'
## 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
Mrs. Charlene Mitchell, Com
munist Party candidate for
President, said yesterday that
the Party's goal in running a
Presidential candidate is "to ex
pose the relationship between
private ownership of productive
property and the immense gulf
between the way people do live
in the United States and the way
that they could live."
Mrs. Mitchell hit the current
student demonstrations as being
aimed at the wrong traget. She

claimed that they are aimed at
"the democratization of higher
education." She said this this is
an important struggle if coupled
with a "challenge to the role of
the university in a capitalist so
ciety. The student movement
must move beyond the bounds
and limits of a capitalist univer
sity. It must begin to raise the
sorts of demands and issues
which will make the university
dysfunctional in the overall so
ciety."

She then hit the current goals
of the university: "job-training,
socializing research and develop
ment, further militarization of
the rabid aspects of social de
velopment."
"All of these functions are de
termined by the corporate elite,"
she continued "and they all must
be challenged by a movement
with a different conception of
the role of the university in so
ciety, a conception based on a
different set of principles, prio
rities, and premises than those
which flow from the private
ownership of productive prop
erty."
Speaking before a crowd of 75
students in Dinkelspiel Audito
rium, Mrs. Mitchell went on to
say that "the university should
be a self-governing community,"
where students study in their
own discipline and not for the
Department of Defense.
The 38-year old Mrs. Mitchell
favored black power and courses
in black history. "It is impossible
to convey the history of black
people in this country without
immediately challenging a num
ber of ideas of what this coun
try is all about. A nation built
on racism hardly deserves the
title of 'Defender of Freedom'."
Mrs. Mitchell herself is black.
"The interest of the students
is to learn how to think; the in
terest of a capitalist university is
to teach them how to behave,"
she asserted.
"The goal of education is the
creation of docile people, the es
sence of general society is the
subordination of people to
things, commodities and the
production of commodities.
When the goal of self-determi
nation is pressed, this contradic
tion inherent in private property
becomes clear," she said.
