# Perrenial Winner Losing For A Change
## Gaughran Stumbles Into Unknown 
### FRED MANN 
It has been an interesting sea
son for Stanford water polo
coach Jim Gaughran. For the
first time in seven years, he is
losing.
The often-honored Gaughran,
who built Stanford into a na
tional powerhouse in both water
polo and swimming and has kept
it there for nearly a decade, has
been having his sleepless nights
this year. The varsity squad is
4-7 on the year and just com
pleted a disastrous trip to Los
Angeles last weekend. The Tribe
dropped a 9-5 decision to league
leading USC on Friday after
noon, and followed It up by get
ting clobbered by defending na
toional champions UCLA, 7-2.
Although the Cards are having

their troubles, the problems are
not unexpected. "The kids are
playing well considering that
they are almost all spoho
mores," commented Gaughran.
"They are inexperienced and in
a real tough league," he con
tinued. "What we need more
than anything is someone who
can just throw the ball in the
goal."
Scoring Punch Needed
Lack of scoring power has
been the number one problem
for the team. They don't have
a good big man that can carry
a team like all the others in the
conference seem to have. Tom
Hill has been the most consistent
scorer thus far, but can not do
it alone. Outstanding swimmer
Dick Roth has been having his

troubles adjusting to water polo.
Sick all week, Roth appeared
only briefly in the weekend
series.
The defense has improved
steadily throughout the season.
The Indians are usually over
powered in a man-to-man cover
age, so they have concentrated
on a zone defense that seems to
get better with each game.
Banks Beaseley has also come
through with fine performances
in the goal for Stanford. Op
ponents have averaged only five
goals per game from the field,
an average which could be
easily overcome by a strong
shooting team.
"We can match strength on a
team basis with any school in
the country," remarked Gaugh

ran, "but the good teams seem
to have one or two nationally
acclaimed players to make their
team go. This we don't have."
"But amazingly enough the
boys do have great spirit and are
to win some."
Although Gaughran's frosh
therefore fun to coach," he con

tinued. "It sure would be nice
team is constantly providing him
with plenty of victories, he has
far from given up on the varsity.
"I still believe we have a good
chance to surprise SC or Cal in
a rematch," said the coach with
a gleem in his eye. "Then it
would be a good season."

It has been an interesting sea
son for Stanford water polo
coach Jim Gaughran. For the
first time in seven years, he is
losing.
The often-honored Gaughran,
who built Stanford into a na
tional powerhouse in both water
polo and swimming and has kept
it there for nearly a decade, has
been having his sleepless nights
this year. The varsity squad is
4-7 on the year and just com
pleted a disastrous trip to Los
Angeles last weekend. The Tribe
dropped a 9-5 decision to league
leading USC on Friday after
noon, and followed It up by get
ting clobbered by defending na
toional champions UCLA, 7-2.
Although the Cards are having

their troubles, the problems are
not unexpected. "The kids are
playing well considering that
they are almost all spoho
mores," commented Gaughran.
"They are inexperienced and in
a real tough league," he con
tinued. "What we need more
than anything is someone who
can just throw the ball in the
goal."
Scoring Punch Needed
Lack of scoring power has
been the number one problem
for the team. They don't have
a good big man that can carry
a team like all the others in the
conference seem to have. Tom
Hill has been the most consistent
scorer thus far, but can not do
it alone. Outstanding swimmer
Dick Roth has been having his

troubles adjusting to water polo.
Sick all week, Roth appeared
only briefly in the weekend
series.
The defense has improved
steadily throughout the season.
The Indians are usually over
powered in a man-to-man cover
age, so they have concentrated
on a zone defense that seems to
get better with each game.
Banks Beaseley has also come
through with fine performances
in the goal for Stanford. Op
ponents have averaged only five
goals per game from the field,
an average which could be
easily overcome by a strong
shooting team.
"We can match strength on a
team basis with any school in
the country," remarked Gaugh
