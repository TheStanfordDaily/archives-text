## Indians Endure LA Marathon 
### GARY CAVALLI 
Stanford's sensational cross
country team overcame the
smog of Los Angeles and an
extra-long 5.7 mile course Sat
urday morning to outlast a
strong UCLA squad 26-30.
Despite being accustomed to
the 4.2 mile Stanford course, the
Indians experienced little diffi
culty in handling the extra mile
and-a-half. Whatever difficulty
the Tribe suffered came in ne
gotiating turns on the fogged-in
Bruin course.
Another outstanding perfor
mance by Brook Thomas spark
ed Coach Marshall Clark's con
tingent to their third straight
win, the first two coming over
highly-touted USC. Thomas nav
igated the UCLA course in an
excellent time of 30:09, nipping
Bruin Dan Preston at the finish
by four seconds.
Juniors Chuck Menz and Greg
Brock also finished strongly for
Stanford, checking in with 30:17
and 30:23 clockings to claim
third and fourth places.
Brock Regains Form
Brock gave every indication
of having overcome a chest cold
which had limited his effective
ness in the team's first two out
ings. "Greg looked a lot better,"

Coach Clark concurred. "I think
the extra-distance may have
helped him."
Sophomore Don Kar d on g ,
looking better each week, blazed
to a seventh-place finish, timing
30:58. An ailing Allen Sanford
came through with a courageous
llth-place effort, covering the
course in 31:59 despite suffering
from severe stomach cramps
which forced him to stop once
during the race.
Finishing out of the money,
but running very well, were Bob
Achondo (13th with a time of
32:53) and sophomore Duncan
Mac Donald (15th with a 33:02
clocking).
The Indians will be idle until

Nov. 8, when they entertain a
strong San Jose State squad on a
lengthened Stanford course. The
course will be stretched to six
miles, since both teams wish to
get used to longer distances in
preparation for the Nationals.
Both the Spartans (who finished
seventh last year) and the In
dians have hopes of going to
the Nationals, held Nov. 25 on
a six-mile course in New York.

course in 31:59 despite suffering
from severe stomach cramps

Finishing out of the money,
but running very well, were Bob
Achondo (13th with a time of
32:53) and sophomore Duncan
Mac Donald (15th with a 33:02
clocking).
The Indians will be idle until

Nov. 8, when they entertain a
strong San Jose State squad on a

Both the Spartans (who finished
seventh last year) and the In

Stanford's sensational cross
country team overcame the
smog of Los Angeles and an
extra-long 5.7 mile course Sat
urday morning to outlast a
strong UCLA squad 26-30.
Despite being accustomed to
the 4.2 mile Stanford course, the
Indians experienced little diffi
culty in handling the extra mile
and-a-half. Whatever difficulty
the Tribe suffered came in ne
gotiating turns on the fogged-in
Bruin course.

Brock also finished strongly for
Stanford, checking in with 30:17
and 30:23 clockings to claim
third and fourth places.

Brock gave every indication
of having overcome a chest cold
which had limited his effective
ness in the team's first two out
ings. "Greg looked a lot better,"

Coach Clark concurred. "I think
the extra-distance may have
helped him."
Sophomore Don Kar d on g ,
