# Transfers Use Menlo College As Stanford's 'Back Door'
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
Every April 15 nearly 6400
high school applicants receive
thin rejection envelopes in the
mail from the Admissions De
partment. "Isn't there any other
way into Stanford?" many of
them moan.
Maybe there is, but few have
heard of Menlo College, an un
usual two-year transfer college
that last year sent 50 of its 350
students to Stanford. Students
there describe it as "a prep
school with ashtrays," transfers
here call it"the back door to
Stanford," and the Menlo cata
logue declares "Here, in a word,
the boy becomes a man."
Comparable Tuition
The college charges $2750, for
room, board, and tuition, ap
proximately the same as Stan

ford and enforces a strict set of
social rules. But in return Men
lo can practically guarantee that
students will transfer into better
colleges as sophomores and jun
iors than they could have en
tered straight out of high school.
The all-male, private college is
located along El Camino where
the neon string of liquor stores
and car dealers gives way to the
quiet green of Atherton. The
campus consists of a series of
pleasant one and two story
buildings that include a small
prop school and a college of
business administration.
Nearly half of the students
are from private schools, and
only a few need scholarships.
Registrar William Moser euphe
mistically describes the student
body as having "the capacity to
be mobile" in choosing their col
leges.
Forgotten Plan to Join
Menlo and Stanford
Menlo was founded in 1915
as a military academy and re
organized as a two year college
in the early 1920'5. For a few
years during this period Stan
ford President Rayman Wilbur
toyed with the idea of establish
ing Menlo as part of Stanford
to handle the first two under
graduate years. Stanford itself
would consist of junior, senior,
and graduate divisions.
However the depression killed
these hopes. Stanford dropped
expansion programs and long
ranged plans in an effort to
make ends meet. The proposed
merge, never very popular with
alumni, was forgotten. Today

there are no formal ties or ar
rangements between the two
schools.
"Late Bloomer" Type
Moser prefers to call the typi
cal Menlo student the "late
bloomer." This type has good
test scores but, for reasons such
as poor studying skills or out
side interests, has not done well
in high school. Menlo hopes that
through close academic and so
cial supervision, the students
will improve enough to transfer
out to another college.
Menlo offers courses that are
standardized to fit freshman and
sophomore requirements at most
universities. In particular, the
school is geared to the Univer
sity of California system and
Stanford since many students
hope to transfer to these schools.
Same Level Of Work ?
For example, Moser admits
that the required "History of
Western Civilization" at Menlo
"parallels almost exactly the
Stanford course."
Menlo graduates now here say
that even the Western Civ books
are identical.
Some say that the work both
h re and there is on the same
evel. Another student disagrees,
At Menlo there was emphasis
on facts, but here the emphasis
lies on thought."
Segregation
There is one black student at
" "enlo. "This is de facto segre
gation though," says Moser.
Menlo cannot compete with
3'anford or Harvard for the
qualified Negro." Menlo offers
no remedial courses as Stanford

does for disadvantaged students.
Director of the college John
Russell estimates that there are
"10 or 12" scholarship students
and another 10 are on athletic
scholarships. "We simply can
not afford any more. Our endow
ment is very small." Stanford
has a $194 million fund, and
Menlo has only $21,000. The col
lege must pay for all scholar
ships out of other students' tui
tion fees.
Rigid Social Rules
Part of a Menlo education is
the pervasive social rules. The
student handbook has references
to nearly every situation a stu
dent can be in. Campus driving
regulations forbid "power take
offs" and " 'burning rubber'
The student is allowed only one
car on campus at a time. Dress
rules declare that socks must be
worn with sandals, and students
should wear ties to dinner.
The most unpopular rules are
the flat prohibitions against
girls. They are banned from the
campus except for the small stu
dent union building. One sopho
more called the rules "pretty
Victorian and really stupid." But
Russell says that the rules have
liberalized quite a bit. "For
many years there were lights
out rules for freshmen and
sophomores."
Why all these rules for twenty
year olds? Moser explains that
"parents don't want to pay
money to have their son live in
an apartment in Menlo Park and
get C's." He feels that many
students at Menlc simply aren't
