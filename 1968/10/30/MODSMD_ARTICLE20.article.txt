icy in Middle Europe for the for
seeable future to keep national
ism in check, History Professor
Wayne Vucineh told the Stan
ford Mothers Club in Los Ange
les yesterday.
And the USSR has a lot more

"One may safely say that the
communist regimes will find it
risky to make serious conces
sions to democracy, for if they
do, they will bring on their own

destruction," he told the meet

In spite of Marxist - Lenin -
Stalinst oratory and literature on
the superiority of "socialist na
tionalism" over the "middle-class
nationalism" of capitalist so

vigorously persecuted all nation
alistic manifestations considered
obnoxious to socialist national
ism as defined by Moscow lead
ers," he said.

"In some cases, they have re
sorted to drastic measures
abolishing, then restoring na
tional territory, creating new na
