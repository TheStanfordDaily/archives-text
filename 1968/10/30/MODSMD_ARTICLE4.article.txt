# Cat Students Vote: Suspend Strike
## 
### 
At a mass meeting of 800 peo
ple held last night on the trou
bled Berkeley campus, students
voted overwhelmingly to sus
pend the current class boycott.
After organizing for a week they
will meet again next Wednesday
when another strike vote will be
taken.
Yesterday's strike was appar
ently a failure with absenteeism
up only a small percentage over
normal.
Only 300 attended a teach-in
held at the student union from
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eldridge Clea
ver spoke at the teach-in instead
of giving his normal course lec
ture for the day.
Legal action against the sus
pension of students arrested in
last week's sit-in is being con
templated.
Chancellor Roger Heyns
stated, "It is now clear that the
strike, like the class boycott of

last week, has been a failure.
C'asses throughout the campus
proceeded normally. The fact
that the strike did not win gen
eral faculty or student support
does not mean that there is not
widespread concern on the cam
pus with the Regents' resolution
of September 20. It does mean
that students and faculty reject
campus disruptions as a means
of conflict resolution.
"The meetings of Regents, fac
ulty and administration now un
der way, on the other hand, give
promise of being productive. . . .
The Regents committee is sched
uled to meet within ten days
with the committees of the Ber
keley division of the Academic
Senate to carry on further dis
cussions."
According to John Dreyfuss of
The Los Angeles Times most of
the classes cut were in the hu
manities, rather than in sciences
and engineering.
