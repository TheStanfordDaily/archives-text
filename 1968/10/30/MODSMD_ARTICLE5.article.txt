# San Mateo Congress Candidates Discuss Issues
## 
### 
Pete McCloskey
The Daily: Congressman, who are you supporting in the presi
dential race?
Paul McCloskey: I have worked for Nelson Rockefeller in Miami,
but I am now supporting Richard Nixon. We need a change in
administration. We can't have a continuation of the policies of
Rusk and Rostow.
The Daily: And in the California senatorial race?
McCloskey: I'm not endorsing Max Raffcrty or supporting him.
I don't endorse Cranston either.
We do need to replace I he Democratic leadership in Congress.
Congress now does not work effectively; it won't cope with urban
problems. The leadership is old, with the seniority system still in
force. The committee chairman of my committee (House Govern
ment Operations Committee) is 82 years old.
We need more of an identity between young Republicans and
young Democrats. Wo need rapid change, and this Is not a par
tisan matter. But the elderly leadership we have now would be
perpetuated by the election of more Democrats.
The Daily: Do you have doubts about Richard Nixon?
McCloskey: No one has doubted the experience or maturity of
Richard Nixon. The question is whether or not he is a man of
principle and integrity. Now the Johnson Administration can be
indicted for a lack of trust, lack of faith. Richard Nixon has the
ability and competence to effect a complete change in the national
administration. This possibility is worth any doubts that people
may have about him. A new Republican Administration is not
bound by all the mistakes, failures of the past. It is not bound by
the 30,000 American dead in Vietnam.
The Daily: How do you view the student's right to dissent and
how does this relate to your stand on the Wyman Amendment?
McCloskey: It Is my belief that students have the choice to come
or not to come to a university. Once they have decided to attend,
it should be made clear that the right of attendance does not in
clude the right to wilfully disrupt operation of the university.
Disruption is not a permissible part of dissent..
At Columbia, people thought that the university was so bad that
it should be shut down, at the expense of others' right to continue
obtaining their education. That is going too far. When this point
is reached, I think federal grant funds should be withheld from the
offending student. It is for that reason that I voted for the Wyman
amendment. The Wyman amendment protects the American peo
ple so that their money isn't used to thwart education.
The Daily: What is your position on the draft?

Urban Whitaker
The Daily: What do you consider to be the most important issue
in your campaign?
Urban Whitaker: I consider race relations and racial tensions to
be the most crucial issue. The Vietnam war may end within a few
years, but the racial problems in America will be with us for many
years.
The Daily: What is your solution to the problem?
Whitaker: A change in attitude is most important. Outright rac
ism is being ended, but American liberals must have a basic change
of attitude. We must go the extra step to help people break out of
the repression that is life for them today. Simple equality won't be
enough. Massive doses of federal aid is important to make a begin
ning, in order to get programs in housing, education, and employ
ment started.
Mr. McCloskey sees a "new" concept of private enterprise and
businesses working with the problem. But I think that government
aid can do the job the quickest, and that is what's important here.
The Daily: How do you stand on the Presidential election?
Whitaker: Hubert Humphrey is a better man for the job than
Richard Nixon, but that does not mean that I am satisfied with
Humphrey. I continue to be a Kennedy-McCarthy Democrat. Hum
phrey has not made a clear indication that he realizes the American
people's disenchantment with the present Administration's poli
cies.
On the surtax and draft I am closer to Nixon. But it does make
a difference, and Mr. Humphrey is a much better candidate than
Mr. Nixon. I have urged Mr. Humphrey to ask Gene McCarthy to
be his Secretary of State, and I think it is possible.
The Daily: What is your major area of disagreement with Hum
phrey?
Whitaker: I have urged an immediate unconditional cessation of
the bombing of North Vietnam. The war is my main area of dis
agreement with the Vice President, I have urged him to resign his
position of the Vice Presidency; he couldn't say he wanted to stop
the bombing unconditionally in his present position.
The Daily: How do you view your opponent's stands on Vietnam?
Whitaker: I don't think Pete McCloskey is a militarist. Rather,
he is a legalist, distinct from me. He is concerned about the Geneva
Accords on Vietnam, with its definition of one instead of two Viet
nams. Actually, it ought to be up to the Vietnamese to decide.
The Daily: How do you classify yourself?
Whitaker: I see McCloskey as a legalist, David Ransom as an
activist, and myself as a democratic humanist. Unlike Ransom, I
don't want to tear down society at the moment. Rather, a new mea
sure of socialism is needed to reorder society.

terviews are presented here, as com
piled by Managing Editor Mark
Weinberger.)
The Daily: How do you view the role of the University in society?
Whitaker: It is important to have students and faculty involved
in the community. The university is a place for learning, not as a
staging ground for revolution. Students should study the relevant
problems of the day, which can then lead to action on social prob
lems.
The Daily: How is the campaign progressing?
Whitaker: San Mateo County will vote three or four to one for
Cranston over Rafferty, and that should give me some help, since
I support Cranston. San Mateo County is a Democratic county, I
think we will discover; the registration is 53-42 with a Democratic
edge. And many of McCloskey's votes last year were anti-Shirley.
The Daily: Do you or Mr. McCloskey appeal more to youth?
Whitaker: McCloskey only has his age (41) and physical appear
ance. He's only 41 and he has those dimples. I am an old man I
guess (44), although I do have my sideburns going for me. Ac
tually, McCloskey has shown that his program is definitely not
youth-oriented. He thinks that kids need military training and there
fore conscription in peacetime is necessary. He voted to deny fed
eral funds to demonstrators and he also voted to cut peace corps
appropriations.
The Daily: What about the influences of George Wallace in the
national campaign?
Whitaker: The moral issues aside, there is a strong possibility
that Wallace will have a strong voice in the next administration.
I wouldn't be surprised at a Wallace-Nixon deal if no one receives
a majority: Wallace would give his votes to Nixon in exchange
for the first two nominees to the supreme court.

McCloskey: My position is that as long as we are confronted by
Communism around the world, the draft is a necessity. After the
Vietnam war is ended, the situation will be different. Under these
circumstances, out military forces would require a level of 3.5
million men. In that way we would protect the peace around the
world; we could protect against a war being started by Israel, the
Arab countries, the Koreas, any number of places . . .
We must remain in a state of readiness. We must resist the
choices of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; for that reason I favor the
citizen-soldier concept. I favor a force of all young people filling a
military force, a teacher corps, peace corps, and domestic workers
corps. A lottery would determine who would make up the armed
forces. I don't anticipate the possibility of ending the draft in the
forseeable future; the draft has stood up well in providing man
power for our armed forces.
Young people are committed to peace in the world and in chang
ing the world. Since they are so committed, I don't think it's too
much to ask that each 19-year-old give his country 18 months of
duty. Youth is committed, dedicated, willing.
The Daily: How do you reconcile your view of yourself as a
young liberal with your local control philosophy?
McCloskey: Local government is the best unit to attack the
problem of education, for instance; the national government has
failed miserably. The federal government hasn't been able to get
federal money back to the local areas; it is all lost in administrative
costs before it gets to the schools. The cost of administering fed
eral funds is too high. I am a liberal but I say that you can't edu
cate kids under 34 different federal agencies.
