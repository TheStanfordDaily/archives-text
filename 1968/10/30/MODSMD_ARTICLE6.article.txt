# The
						SRI Question
## 
### PAUL WITT 
Living alone in East Palo Alto
this quarter is giving me a lot
more time — time to think, time
to see the relationships between
some things.
Like I don't spend time every
day waiting in line to have a
hole punched in a card called
a meal ticket. (I don't waste
so much money on overhead
food costs either — like more
than 65 per cent of your $230 per
quarter board bill at Roble goes
for non-food expenditures.)
As the days get shorter I
spend more time indoors read
ing. The Stanford Daily has pro
vided a jumping-off place for
provocative, stimulating

thought.
Traditionally Stanford has
been a conservative school. That
would qualify us for having a
"silent majority," an apathetic
student body waiting to be mo
bilized. But they will be attract
ed to the left, not the right.
Why?
Why are these people, young
people, students, my friends, tak
ing to the streets, to the plazas?
What is wrong with the tradi
tional established channels for
change?
To begin with, since it is fresh
in everyone's mind, let's look
briefly at the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI).
Students for a Democratic So
ciety (SDS) has initiated a dis
cussion worthy of the attention
of the academic community.
Should we, or any of our affli
ates, produce any weapon or
participate in any activity that
is designed to kill people?
That diverse — but perccived
as monolithic — block called the
administration felt threatened.
So they reasoned that SRI was
going to be the focus of the SDS
attack.
Determined (as usual) not to
blow it (as usual), the admini
stration responded (as usual) ...
in what I'm rapidly beginning
to believe is the only way they
know how. They set up a com
mittee.

But was that the point? Did
the administration confront the
issue, or merely put down the
petitioners?
The administration found they
did not have to answer those
questions, for praises soon be
gan to heap upon the acting
President. For example, a Daily
headline proclaimed, "SRI-SDS
Encounter Fizzles." Even Assoc.
Editor Phil Taubman applauded:
"Robert J. Glaser socks it to
'em."
Moreover SRI offered to talk
between the hours of 3 and
4:30 in the afternoon from Oc
tober 17 to October 31. As many
as fifteen (15) students could
participate at a time. Call ahead
for reservations. It got to be
like the 1964 March on Wash
ington — a real panic.
But I think Geoffrey Stevens
zeroed in on the target best in
his open letter to the acting
President: "If the committee...
decided that much of the SRl's
work was in support of the op
pressive American intervention
in Southeast Asia, would the ad
ministration and trustees... be
willing to terminate the work,
instead of merely disassociating
SRI from Stanford?" If they
wouldn't, is there any point in
waiting six months for a trans
fer in name only of SRI?
