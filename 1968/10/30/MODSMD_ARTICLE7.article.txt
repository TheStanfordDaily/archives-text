# An Editorial
## For The Congress... 
### 
The grinding of the national political gears has come up with
three major candidates that leave a significant number of con
cerned Amerieans with no real alternatives.
However, the corruption and bankruptcy of the established po
litical system has not always extended to the smaller units of the
local elections, where there still remains a spectrum of choice and
a divergence of opinion.
The national campaign rhetoric calling for the limitation of
dissent, "law and order," the blind use of American military
power—in short, the fascist trend breeding today in the American
mind—must be combated, and the first and only line of defense
is the Congressional, state, and local elections that accompany
next Tuesday's presidential ballot.
For that reason, it is imperative that candidates be elected who
resist that trend, who have stood clearly for a true democratiza
tion of the political process, who have rejected the old notion of
the need for United States world military might to stem the tide
of a unified Communist threat, and who understand the meaning
of academic freedom and responsible dissent on the university
campus.
Several area candidates deserve specific mention.
Don Edwards
Incumbent Congressman Don Edwards from San Jose has stood
consistently for rechanneling of American efforts and capabili
ties. He stood up in Congress last year for Eugene McCarthy
when such an action was a most unfashionable effrontery to the
then-inviolate war policies of Lyndon Johnson. Edwards stood
firm as the wave of reaction swept Congress, cowing other Con
gressmen into lashing out at college demonstrators with an anti
flag burning act.
Don Edwards understands the need for a rearrangement of
national priorities to attack urban problems with the same zeal
we now attack North Vietnam. He has and will continue to battle
for aid to education and the rights of all citizens.
Gubser—Taketa
A choice is not as clear in the tenth congressional district,
which includes Stanford in its constituency. The incumbent,
Charles Gubser, is a chameleon, shifting his stance as often as a
fighter in the ring in order to match his views to his audience or
current poll. He has opposed poverty appropriations, the 1968
fair housing bill, and most education appropriations, for example.
He undercut support of Stanford by his stand on the Wyman
Amendment, supporting the witholding of federal funds to col
lege demonstrators.
As a long-time member of the House Armed Services Commit
tee, Gubser has long served the military as one of the loudest

advocates of enlarged nuclear armament and military supremacy.
Unfortunately, the alternative to two more years of Charles
Gubser is less than attractive. Democrat Grayson Taketa is a man
who "wholeheartedly" supports Hubert Humphrey and all the
misconceptions about society that Humphrey retains. Taketa is a
very recent war-hawk-turned-dove who sees no more necessity
than an end to the seniority system as sufficing for a rehaul of the
political system.
Taketa is a man of few ideas, whose campaign is geared as a
stop Gubser measure. As such, Grayson Taketa merits support.
Hut as a dynamic young man in the electoral scene, he falls far
short.
McCloskey—Whitaker
The eleventh district has the opposite problem: it has two
highly credible candidates. Both incumbent Pete McCloskey and
challenger Urban Whitaker present themselves as concerned
young men with definite ideas of what this country needs.
McCloskey has done an admirable job in his first year in Con
gress, although his statement that the seizing of the Pueblo re
quired swift retribution was unfortunate. McCloskey has ex
pressed willingness to join other Congress "Young Turks" of both
parties to overthrow the hardened-arteries approach of the Capi
tol Hill establishment. And McCloskey has shown a keen aware
ness of the urban agonies awaiting us as soon as our resources
can be redirected.
The Democrat Whitaker voices similar doubts about the wis
dom of present leadership, but has come up with better solutions.
While McCloskey continues to support the present military sta
ture outside of Vietnam, Whitaker has called for a sweeping re
appraisal of the worldwide posture of this country. Whitaker
supports a modernization of the political process, including the
establishment of nationwide political primaries and an end to the
electoral college; McCloskey has said little. Whitaker calls for
an end to peacetime conscription, while McCloskey advocates
retention of the draft "as long as we are confronted by Commu
nism around the world.'
We support Urban Whitaker for election to the House of Rep
resentatives for his bold and forthright stands on the issues that
threaten to rip the nation apart. Pete McCloskey also stands well
as a congressional candidate, although his conviction to revalua
tion and change seems not to run as deep.
It is men like Don Edwards, Urban Whitaker, and also his
opponent Pete McCloskey that this nation so sorely requires in
positions of leadership. Democrats and Republicans, McCarthy
and Kennedy dissidents, Humphrey and Nixon supporters must
work together to rescue this reeling nation. Local elections are
still avenues that remain open.

We support Urban Whitaker for election to the House of Rep
resentatives for his bold and forthright stands on the issues that
threaten to rip the nation apart. Pete McCloskey also stands well
as a congressional candidate, although his conviction to revalua
tion and change seems not to run as deep.
It is men like Don Edwards, Urban Whitaker, and also his
opponent Pete McCloskey that this nation so sorely requires in
positions of leadership. Democrats and Republicans, McCarthy
and Kennedy dissidents, Humphrey and Nixon supporters must
work together to rescue this reeling nation. Local elections are
still avenues that remain open.
The grinding of the national political gears has come up with
three major candidates that leave a significant number of con
cerned Amerieans with no real alternatives.
However, the corruption and bankruptcy of the established po
litical system has not always extended to the smaller units of the
local elections, where there still remains a spectrum of choice and
a divergence of opinion.
The national campaign rhetoric calling for the limitation of
dissent, "law and order," the blind use of American military
power—in short, the fascist trend breeding today in the American
mind—must be combated, and the first and only line of defense
is the Congressional, state, and local elections that accompany
next Tuesday's presidential ballot.
For that reason, it is imperative that candidates be elected who
resist that trend, who have stood clearly for a true democratiza
tion of the political process, who have rejected the old notion of
the need for United States world military might to stem the tide
of a unified Communist threat, and who understand the meaning
of academic freedom and responsible dissent on the university
campus.
Several area candidates deserve specific mention.
Don Edwards
Incumbent Congressman Don Edwards from San Jose has stood
consistently for rechanneling of American efforts and capabili
ties. He stood up in Congress last year for Eugene McCarthy
when such an action was a most unfashionable effrontery to the
then-inviolate war policies of Lyndon Johnson. Edwards stood
firm as the wave of reaction swept Congress, cowing other Con
gressmen into lashing out at college demonstrators with an anti
flag burning act.
Don Edwards understands the need for a rearrangement of
national priorities to attack urban problems with the same zeal
we now attack North Vietnam. He has and will continue to battle
for aid to education and the rights of all citizens.
Gubser—Taketa
A choice is not as clear in the tenth congressional district,
which includes Stanford in its constituency. The incumbent,
Charles Gubser, is a chameleon, shifting his stance as often as a
fighter in the ring in order to match his views to his audience or
current poll. He has opposed poverty appropriations, the 1968
fair housing bill, and most education appropriations, for example.
He undercut support of Stanford by his stand on the Wyman
Amendment, supporting the witholding of federal funds to col
lege demonstrators.
As a long-time member of the House Armed Services Commit
tee, Gubser has long served the military as one of the loudest

advocates of enlarged nuclear armament and military supremacy.
Unfortunately, the alternative to two more years of Charles
Gubser is less than attractive. Democrat Grayson Taketa is a man
who "wholeheartedly" supports Hubert Humphrey and all the
misconceptions about society that Humphrey retains. Taketa is a
very recent war-hawk-turned-dove who sees no more necessity
than an end to the seniority system as sufficing for a rehaul of the
political system.
Taketa is a man of few ideas, whose campaign is geared as a
stop Gubser measure. As such, Grayson Taketa merits support.
Hut as a dynamic young man in the electoral scene, he falls far
short.
McCloskey—Whitaker
The eleventh district has the opposite problem: it has two
highly credible candidates. Both incumbent Pete McCloskey and
challenger Urban Whitaker present themselves as concerned
young men with definite ideas of what this country needs.
McCloskey has done an admirable job in his first year in Con
gress, although his statement that the seizing of the Pueblo re
quired swift retribution was unfortunate. McCloskey has ex
pressed willingness to join other Congress "Young Turks" of both
parties to overthrow the hardened-arteries approach of the Capi
tol Hill establishment. And McCloskey has shown a keen aware
ness of the urban agonies awaiting us as soon as our resources
can be redirected.
The Democrat Whitaker voices similar doubts about the wis
dom of present leadership, but has come up with better solutions.
While McCloskey continues to support the present military sta
ture outside of Vietnam, Whitaker has called for a sweeping re
appraisal of the worldwide posture of this country. Whitaker
supports a modernization of the political process, including the
establishment of nationwide political primaries and an end to the
electoral college; McCloskey has said little. Whitaker calls for
an end to peacetime conscription, while McCloskey advocates
retention of the draft "as long as we are confronted by Commu
nism around the world.'
We support Urban Whitaker for election to the House of Rep

ness of the urban agonies awaiting us as soon as our resources
can be redirected.
The Democrat Whitaker voices similar doubts about the wis
dom of present leadership, but has come up with better solutions.
While McCloskey continues to support the present military sta
ture outside of Vietnam, Whitaker has called for a sweeping re
appraisal of the worldwide posture of this country. Whitaker
supports a modernization of the political process, including the
establishment of nationwide political primaries and an end to the
electoral college; McCloskey has said little. Whitaker calls for
an end to peacetime conscription, while McCloskey advocates
retention of the draft "as long as we are confronted by Commu
nism around the world.'
We support Urban Whitaker for election to the House of Rep
resentatives for his bold and forthright stands on the issues that
threaten to rip the nation apart. Pete McCloskey also stands well
as a congressional candidate, although his conviction to revalua
tion and change seems not to run as deep.
It is men like Don Edwards, Urban Whitaker, and also his
opponent Pete McCloskey that this nation so sorely requires in
positions of leadership. Democrats and Republicans, McCarthy
and Kennedy dissidents, Humphrey and Nixon supporters must
work together to rescue this reeling nation. Local elections are
still avenues that remain open.
The grinding of the national political gears has come up with
three major candidates that leave a significant number of con
cerned Amerieans with no real alternatives.
However, the corruption and bankruptcy of the established po
litical system has not always extended to the smaller units of the
local elections, where there still remains a spectrum of choice and
a divergence of opinion.
The national campaign rhetoric calling for the limitation of
dissent, "law and order," the blind use of American military
power—in short, the fascist trend breeding today in the American
mind—must be combated, and the first and only line of defense
is the Congressional, state, and local elections that accompany
next Tuesday's presidential ballot.
For that reason, it is imperative that candidates be elected who
resist that trend, who have stood clearly for a true democratiza
tion of the political process, who have rejected the old notion of
the need for United States world military might to stem the tide
of a unified Communist threat, and who understand the meaning
of academic freedom and responsible dissent on the university
campus.
Several area candidates deserve specific mention.
Don Edwards
Incumbent Congressman Don Edwards from San Jose has stood
consistently for rechanneling of American efforts and capabili
ties. He stood up in Congress last year for Eugene McCarthy
when such an action was a most unfashionable effrontery to the
then-inviolate war policies of Lyndon Johnson. Edwards stood
firm as the wave of reaction swept Congress, cowing other Con
gressmen into lashing out at college demonstrators with an anti
flag burning act.
Don Edwards understands the need for a rearrangement of
national priorities to attack urban problems with the same zeal
we now attack North Vietnam. He has and will continue to battle
for aid to education and the rights of all citizens.
Gubser—Taketa
A choice is not as clear in the tenth congressional district,
which includes Stanford in its constituency. The incumbent,
Charles Gubser, is a chameleon, shifting his stance as often as a
fighter in the ring in order to match his views to his audience or
current poll. He has opposed poverty appropriations, the 1968
fair housing bill, and most education appropriations, for example.
He undercut support of Stanford by his stand on the Wyman
Amendment, supporting the witholding of federal funds to col
lege demonstrators.
As a long-time member of the House Armed Services Commit
tee, Gubser has long served the military as one of the loudest

advocates of enlarged nuclear armament and military supremacy.
Unfortunately, the alternative to two more years of Charles
Gubser is less than attractive. Democrat Grayson Taketa is a man
who "wholeheartedly" supports Hubert Humphrey and all the
misconceptions about society that Humphrey retains. Taketa is a
very recent war-hawk-turned-dove who sees no more necessity
than an end to the seniority system as sufficing for a rehaul of the
political system.
Taketa is a man of few ideas, whose campaign is geared as a
stop Gubser measure. As such, Grayson Taketa merits support.
Hut as a dynamic young man in the electoral scene, he falls far
short.
McCloskey—Whitaker
The eleventh district has the opposite problem: it has two
highly credible candidates. Both incumbent Pete McCloskey and
challenger Urban Whitaker present themselves as concerned
young men with definite ideas of what this country needs.
McCloskey has done an admirable job in his first year in Con
gress, although his statement that the seizing of the Pueblo re
quired swift retribution was unfortunate. McCloskey has ex
pressed willingness to join other Congress "Young Turks" of both
parties to overthrow the hardened-arteries approach of the Capi
tol Hill establishment. And McCloskey has shown a keen aware
ness of the urban agonies awaiting us as soon as our resources
can be redirected.
The Democrat Whitaker voices similar doubts about the wis
dom of present leadership, but has come up with better solutions.
While McCloskey continues to support the present military sta
ture outside of Vietnam, Whitaker has called for a sweeping re
appraisal of the worldwide posture of this country. Whitaker
