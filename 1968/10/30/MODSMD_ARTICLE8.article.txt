• Daily 'Shocking'
Editor, THE DAILY:
This is a painful note to have
to write, but out of personal and
professional conscience it must
be done. The objective, of course,
is not censorship; it is con
structive censureship.
In simolest terms, this Fall's
Daily has been a shocking dis
appointment. The problem has
nothing to do with ideologies ex
pressed in editorials or editor
ial-page columns nor even with

the recent preoccupation with
four-letter words. The problem
is much more serious: excessive
subjectivity, distortion and omis
sion in news coverage.
Especially offending in recent
weeks have been some of the
so-called "news analyses" and
"analyses" on such as SES, the
Gaieties, SRI, Cleaver, Mc-
Carthy and Unruh. Many of
these have certainly not been
written as "news" and several
have not even been "analyses."
Why not be honest and label
I

these (and other also subjective
and incomplete news stories)
what they really are: "opinion"
or "commentary"? Or, better
yet, turn them into true news
analyses of value?
The greatest disappointment
so far may not be what The
Daily has done but what it has
not done specifically: failing to
provide a full dialogue and bal
anced coverage on University
issues. Part of your mandate
is to provide an open forum for
the entire University commu
nity through news, editorials,
columns and letters to the editor.
Although it is encouraging to
see The Daily play catch-up re
cently with the letters, the
paper's full fairness and respon
sibility in coverage are still miss
ing. Thus, The Daily must re
gain its perspective before it can
regain the trust of the commu
nity.

• Bad Language
Editor, THE DAILY:
The language which you al
lowed to creep onto your front
page in the Oct. 21 issue was in
bad taste. It is my personal opin
ion that it was also ridiculous in
a trivial sort of way, but it's ob
vious that it was in bad taste.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Reflections on voting in No
vember:
A vote for Humphrey is a
vote against Nixon (good), but
a vote for Democratic party boss
control of the Johnson-Daley va
riety (bad). Vote for Humphrey
because he is the lesser evil?
Those of us who did that four
years ago found out that John
son was certainly less honest
than his opponent and probably
a greater evil.
A vote for Nixon is a vote
against Democratic party boss
ism (good), but a vote for Nix
on (bad). After twenty years of

watching him both in and out
of public office any explanation
of that judgement is superflu
ous.
A vote for Wallace is a vote
against the leadership of both
major parties (good), but a vote
for a man whose mental stabili
ty is at least questionable and
whose proposed policies are vi
ciously irresponsible.
Conclusion: Vote for a write
in candidate or leave that part
of the ballot as blank as a list
of the merits and qualifications
of all three candidates.

subjectivity, distortion and omis
sion in news coverage.
Especially offending in recent
weeks have been some of the
so-called "news analyses" and
"analyses" on such as SES, the
Gaieties, SRI, Cleaver, Mc-
Carthy and Unruh. Many of
these have certainly not been
written as "news" and several
have not even been "analyses."
Why not be honest and label
I

these (and other also subjective
and incomplete news stories)
what they really are: "opinion"
or "commentary"? Or, better
yet, turn them into true news
analyses of value?
The greatest disappointment
so far may not be what The
Daily has done but what it has
not done specifically: failing to
provide a full dialogue and bal
anced coverage on University
issues. Part of your mandate
is to provide an open forum for
the entire University commu
nity through news, editorials,
columns and letters to the editor.
Although it is encouraging to
see The Daily play catch-up re
cently with the letters, the
paper's full fairness and respon
sibility in coverage are still miss
ing. Thus, The Daily must re
gain its perspective before it can
regain the trust of the commu
nity.

• Bad Language
Editor, THE DAILY:
The language which you al
lowed to creep onto your front
page in the Oct. 21 issue was in
bad taste. It is my personal opin
ion that it was also ridiculous in
a trivial sort of way, but it's ob
vious that it was in bad taste.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Reflections on voting in No
vember:
A vote for Humphrey is a
vote against Nixon (good), but
a vote for Democratic party boss
control of the Johnson-Daley va
riety (bad). Vote for Humphrey
because he is the lesser evil?
Those of us who did that four
years ago found out that John
son was certainly less honest
than his opponent and probably
a greater evil.
A vote for Nixon is a vote
against Democratic party boss
ism (good), but a vote for Nix
on (bad). After twenty years of

watching him both in and out
of public office any explanation
of that judgement is superflu
ous.
A vote for Wallace is a vote
against the leadership of both
major parties (good), but a vote
for a man whose mental stabili
ty is at least questionable and
whose proposed policies are vi
ciously irresponsible.
Conclusion: Vote for a write
in candidate or leave that part
of the ballot as blank as a list
of the merits and qualifications
of all three candidates.

• Daily 'Shocking'
Editor, THE DAILY:
This is a painful note to have
to write, but out of personal and
professional conscience it must
be done. The objective, of course,
is not censorship; it is con
structive censureship.
In simolest terms, this Fall's
Daily has been a shocking dis
appointment. The problem has
nothing to do with ideologies ex
pressed in editorials or editor
ial-page columns nor even with

the recent preoccupation with
four-letter words. The problem
is much more serious: excessive
subjectivity, distortion and omis
sion in news coverage.
