# Economist Decries Population Worries

### CRAIG WILSON 
"At the moment we are doing
very little to close the popula
tion production gap . . . but I
refuse to share the despair of
the prophets of gloom."
There seemed to be a confi
dent optimism in the words of
Kenneth R. Hansen, former As
sistant Director of the U.S. Bu
reau of the Budget last night in
Tresidder Memorial Union be
fore a large audience.
Hansen spoke as a part of the
Stanford Population and En
vironment Forum which has
concentrated heavily on the
needs and solutions to overpopu
lation and overcrowding with a
continuing series of lectures and
discussions.
"I believe we have the capa
bility and the technology and
the time to solve the population
problem before we begin to
control the birth rate by the
death rate."
Resigns Post
One of the first of the Ken
nedy men to resign after the
Johnson administration took of
fice, Hansen had had consider
able experience in the area of
economic growth and its rela
tion to population control par
ticularly in the area of foreign
aid.
After his resignation he be
came vice-president of the Syn
tex corporation, the largest
manufacturer of oral contracep
tives in the world.
"We have hardly begun to
utilize the educational facilities
needed to influence" population
growth and have noi performed

"the behavioral and social re
search necessary."
Not In Mood
He emphasized the fact that
Congress has not been in the
mood to pursue the problem.
This is shown in the reduction
of foreign aid which has en
deavored in the past to deal with
problems brought about by over
population.
According to Hansen we are
spending less than .6 per cent of
our gross national product on
foreign assistance.
But he was quick to add that
with the moneys poured into
necessary areas countries can
be rejuvenated and the popula
tion problem can be controlled.
Hansen said that the alarmists
who warn us today of the grave
dangers we are facing unless
something is done soon, all use
the assumption we will not take
any action. They cast doubt on
our ability as a nation to solve
our problems.
He said that we should con
cern ourselves with the world
as one community and when
questioned later about the fact
that American foreign aid was
a form of coercion with the
strings often attached he said
that we must face our problems
together.
But "our physical environ
ment is just a reflection of our
social values. We are wasting
human resources."
"We possess an abundance of
abilities to accomplish our goals.
We have to redistribute and re
vitalize our system and become
more efficient more responsive
and more knowing."
