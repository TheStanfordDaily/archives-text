# Letters To The Editor
## "Brilliant!" DAILY 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
Congratulations—you've done
it at last! Under the "New Look"
the Stanford Daily has finally
begun to approach in profession
al quality and readership reac
tion that great newspaper of the
north — The San Francisco
Chronicle.
Your "Letters to the Editor"
section of Oct. 10 was unques
tionably the best written, most
interesting and most informative
part of the issue — and that's
been a idstinguishing character
istic of the Chronicle for years.

• TA Demands
Editor, THE DAILY:
We graduate students in the
department of History, wish to
express their support for the
demands of the T.A.'s in Political
Science and English in their up
coming negotiations with the ad
ministration. We ourselves are
in the progress of organizing
graduate students in History
with a view toward formulating
our own economic and academic
goals. We further join with the
campus AFT in calling on all
other departments to organize
and work for whatever they con
sider their interests to be, and

we will support such depart
ments in whatever ways we can.

• View Of Austria
Eitor, THE DAILY:
As an alumnus of Austria V, I
feel the Daily article of October
8 concerning the Austrian cam
pus was misleading in its neglect
of many opportunities which the
campus affords. By stating that
no families are associated with
the Vienna campus, I think Mr.
Evers must have been unaware
of the activities that went on
in the last Fall-Winter group.

Several families in Vienna be
came very close to Stanford stu
dents, inviting them to sports
events, classes at the University
of Vienna, or even to spend
Christmas vacation in their
homes.
There was constant contact
with families in Semmering, a
mountain community and the old
location of the Stanford cam
pus. Students spent many week
ends there hiking, skiing, work
ing with the kindergarten, or
just visiting with their adopted
families.
I think it is folly to assume
that people in a world capital
will make an effort to get to
know someone simply because
he is an American. In many Eu
ropean cities the case is quite
contrary. That is why an at
tempt should be made to meet
citizens of a host country as peo
ple, rather than quaint German
speaking novelties.

• Western Civ As TV
Editor, THE DAILY:
Please give your reporter Mr.
Sweeney a gold star for his
news analysis of Tuesday, Oct.
15.
Yes indeed, Mr. Sweeney,
Western Civ is Stanford's an
swer to television.
TV, unfortunately, is boring.
It fails to amuse and delight as
it instructs, and for the fees that
