# Letters To The Editor
## "Brilliant!" DAILY 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
Congratulations—you've done
it at last! Under the "New Look"
the Stanford Daily has finally
begun to approach in profession
al quality and readership reac
tion that great newspaper of the
north — The San Francisco
Chronicle.
Your "Letters to the Editor"
section of Oct. 10 was unques
tionably the best written, most
interesting and most informative
part of the issue — and that's
been a idstinguishing character
istic of the Chronicle for years.

• TA Demands
Editor, THE DAILY:
We graduate students in the
department of History, wish to
express their support for the
demands of the T.A.'s in Political
Science and English in their up
coming negotiations with the ad
ministration. We ourselves are
in the progress of organizing
graduate students in History
with a view toward formulating
our own economic and academic
goals. We further join with the
campus AFT in calling on all
other departments to organize
and work for whatever they con
sider their interests to be, and

we will support such depart
ments in whatever ways we can.

• View Of Austria
Eitor, THE DAILY:
As an alumnus of Austria V, I
feel the Daily article of October
8 concerning the Austrian cam
pus was misleading in its neglect
of many opportunities which the
campus affords. By stating that
no families are associated with
the Vienna campus, I think Mr.
Evers must have been unaware
of the activities that went on
in the last Fall-Winter group.

Several families in Vienna be
came very close to Stanford stu
dents, inviting them to sports
events, classes at the University
of Vienna, or even to spend
Christmas vacation in their
homes.
There was constant contact
with families in Semmering, a
mountain community and the old
location of the Stanford cam
pus. Students spent many week
ends there hiking, skiing, work
ing with the kindergarten, or
just visiting with their adopted
families.
I think it is folly to assume
that people in a world capital
will make an effort to get to
know someone simply because
he is an American. In many Eu
ropean cities the case is quite
contrary. That is why an at
tempt should be made to meet
citizens of a host country as peo
ple, rather than quaint German
speaking novelties.

• Western Civ As TV
Editor, THE DAILY:
Please give your reporter Mr.
Sweeney a gold star for his
news analysis of Tuesday, Oct.
15.
Yes indeed, Mr. Sweeney,
Western Civ is Stanford's an
swer to television.
TV, unfortunately, is boring.
It fails to amuse and delight as
it instructs, and for the fees that
Stanford freshmen pay they
have a right to something better
than television. They have a
right to the kind of top quality
programs that Civ offers.
Take the show offered in my
class on Tuesday. Admittedly
the plot wasn't too much better
than Peyton Plaee. Antigone, a
small town Greek coed, gets up
tight about her brother's fu
neral. Her future father-in-law
his this thing about law and
order. When it's all over, Anti
gone gets hers, although she's
never sure why; her fiance and
her future mother-in-law both
commit suicide; her future fa
ther-in-law comes to realize that
somewhere he's gone wrong.
But where?
If you can't figure it out for
yourself, Civ, under the genial
guidance of your Ivy League or
Be r k e 1 e y-educated instructor,

provides the answers. You are
even encouraged to talk back
which is hard to do with the
Tube.
Yes, Mr. Sweeney, Civ, the
course that never fails to delight
and amuse as it instructs, is
Stanford's answer to television
—and a good answer it is.
[By the way, I think that the
SES proposal to add some new
channels to the Civ network
(Asian and African Civ) is an
excellent one, provided the stu
dent can first make some sense
out of our local civilization.]
[As for the dreams of small
freshman seminars taught by
senior professors, each offering
his own speciality, I think I will
try an experiment. Although I
am not a senior professor, I will
try offering a Super Civ semi
nar in my speciality, late 19th
century Italian colonial policy.
I can hardly wait for the rush.]

• Attacks Obscenities
Editor, THE DAILY:
I strongly object to the ob
scenities that fill the columns
of the Daily this year. It seems
to me that those who are in
telligent enough to be admitted
to Stanford ought to have a
vocabulary that would permit
meaningful discourse without
resorting to such vulgarities.
Further, I want to register an
even more emphatic protest to
the use of the name Christ as a
heading for columns. When I
opened the Daily this morning
and the big black letters "OH.
CHRIST" stood out in such bold
relief I felt that I just had to
write or I would be denying my
Savior.
As one who has a strong per
sonal faith in Jesus Christ as
Savior and Lord I ask that, you
desist from using His name in
vain so flagrantly. The Ten
Commandments are still in ef
fect. They cannot really be

broken. Men break themselves
on them. All will one day stand
before Christ and give an ac
count to Him.
I am confident there are many
others in the Stanford commu
nity who share my views.

• Attacks Bridge Toll
Editor, THE DAILY:
As I was caught going the 50-
cent direction on the Golden
Gate Bridge with only 25 cents
change last Sunday afternoon,

I thought of a way to make traf
fic movement over the bridge
even more efficient than under
the present experimental sys
tem.
It is well known that the
bridge operates at a substantial
profit. Is it not reasonable,
therefore, to balance the bridge
budget while further facilitating
flow of traffic? Why has no one
proposed that bridge tolls be
collected under the present ex
perimental system only one day
per week? I suspect that the re
maining six days could be toll
holidays.
