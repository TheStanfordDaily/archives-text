## The
						Facts Behind SRI Study 
### 
"Every gun that is made,
every warship launched, every
rocket fired signifies, in the fi
nal sense, a theft from those
who hunger and are not fed,
those who are cold and are not
clothed.
"This world in arms is not
spending money alone.
"It is spending the sweat of its
laborers, the genius of its scien
tists, the hopes of its chil
dren . . ."
Dwight David Eisenhower
By DENIS HAYES
I begin with a quotation of
Dwight Eisenhower, not out of
any great love or admiration for
the man, but rather to try to
convince a rather conservative
campus that there is nothing
which smacks of the bogeyman,
"radicalism", in the article which
follows. I am going to try to
clear up some popular miscon
ceptions both about the nature
of the present University Com
mittee on 5.R.1., and about the
substance of my suggestions for
a CBW-Vietnam contract mora
torium until that Committee
completes its report.
The present University Com
mittee to Investigate SRI was in
no sense a "response" to SDS

demands. The committee was set
up, and both its form and role
were determined, more than a
week before the SDS posted its
demands.
The immediate impetus for
the committee was the concern
demonstrated by the sponsors in
Wilbur. They felt SRI was a
legitimate issue, and they sug
gested it would be wise to seize
the initiative. I talked to Eric
Larson (the head Wilbur spon
sor) the morning of Oct. 1; I
conveyed his sense of urgency
to Glaser that same afternoon.
Within three days a decision had
been made to establish the com
mittee. This was formally stated
in a memo on Oct. 4, well before
the SDS demands of Oct. 9.
To consider the Acting Presi
dent's role in this affair as ei
ther a cynical act of "conflict
castration" or as "caving in to
coercive tactics" is simply to ig
nore the fact that he was out on
the platform a week ahead of the
train.
The charge given the commit
tee is to explore the Institute's
relationships with Stanford Uni
versity. This certainly does not
mean that the committee is to
ascertain what that relationship

is. That could be done in a cou
ple of hours, simply by reading
the relevant documents.
I interpret this charge to
mean that the committee is to
thoroughly investigate SRI to
learn and be able to document
exactly what the Institute does.
It will then seek to determine
whether such activities are ap
propriate to a university-owned
enterprise.
I recently recommended to the
Board of Trustees that it make
some humanitarian use of its in
fluence over the Stanford Re
search Institute. This "influ
ence" is quite substantial.
SRI, as all Daily readers must
be aware by now, is a wholly
ownfd subsidiary of the Univer
sity. If viewed on the corporate
model, this means that all the
"stock" in SRI is held by the
Stanford trustees. As "stock
holders" our trustees elect the
SRI Board of Directors, and, in
deed, several of our trustees
moonlight as directors of SRI.
If it should prove necessary in
order to effect a decision, the
Stanford trustees could legaUy
"fire" all the SRI Directors in
one fell swoop and get a new
board. However such drastic ac

tion is a little unlikely; more
over, it would be entirely unnec
essary, for the "persuasive"
powers of the Stanford trustees
are quite enormous.
My recommendation is that
SRI be "persuaded" to decline
all new contract in the realms
of biological, gas, and counter
insurgency warfare, and all new
research regarding U.S. military
involvement in Southeast Asia.
This moratorium on new proj
ects would last until the recent
ly-established committee makes
its report. We have been assured
that this period will be less than
six months.
It is possible that the Com
mittee may recommend any
thing from a continuation of the
status quo to a complete cur
tailment of all military re
search. Yet if SRI accepts a
three-year contract tomorrow to
do research on nerve gas or on
a particularly contagious strain
of anthrax, the Institute will be
obliged to continue that research
2V2 years after the committee
report is completed, regardless
of what the committee may rec
ommend.
It is only a gesture of good
faith not to accept new contracts

in the interim which could obli
gate the Institute to long-term
research of a type which may be
opposed in the committee's re
port.
I did not seek before the Trus
tees to explore the subtleties of
this topic. I did not distinguish,
for example, between research
on Mace and research on poison
ous gas; I did not distinguish
between Bolivian miners and
American Blacks; I did not dis
tinguish between "offensive" re
search and "defensive" research.
The recommendations were of
a "blanket" nature, not because
of a simplistic view of the prob
lem, but rather because it
seemed desirable to anticipate
and encompass the entire broad
realm concerning which the
committee is likely to be making
recommendations.
I would hope that these rec
ommendations will be found
sufficiently restrained to deserve
the support of the bulk of the
faculty and student body. Any
thing less is a return to an old
model: important long-term de
cisions are made by executives
while students and faculty sit
around in an advisory commit
tee discussing things.
