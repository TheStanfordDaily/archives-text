# Med School Starts Framing Program
## 
### 
A new program for training
workers from racial minorities
as laboratory assistants and
technicians has been inaugur
ated by the School of Medicine.
The program, which will pro
vide intensified training in lab
oratory procedures for four
months, began in October with
seven students. The students'
backgrounds range from 7 to 12
years of formal education.
Trainees enrolled in the pro
gram receive a salary during
their training. For the first six
weeks, they will be exposed to
formal lectures, films and lab
oratory exercises. For the re
mainder of their training, the
students will work in selected
laboratories in the Medical
School while attending classes
one afternoon a week. After
their training is over, the train
ees will become regular em
ployees at the Medical Center.
The new program is the brain
child of Moses A. Thomas, 30-
year-old laboratory cooidinator
in the Department of Genetics
of the Medical School.
He is also past executive chair
man of the East Palo Alto
NAACP branch.
Thomas found that most be
ginning laboratory technicians
with a college degree in biology
and no experience in a research
laboratory are at once over
trained and undertrained.
"They are overtrained," he
said, "in the sense that they

have been given a great deal of
theoretical knowledge out of
context and they are generally
not able to apply very much of
it to the specific research prob
lems of the laboratory. They are
undertrained in that they have
not been rigorously schooled in
handling even the simplest lab
oratory tools such as pipets, and
modern balances."
He concluded that a person
with less theoretical experience,
but well grounded in laboratory
techniques would be a desirable
laboratory assistant, especially
in laboratories which require
several assistants.
Thomas had plans for a more
ambitious program for minori
ties which would accomodate 20
instead of seven students. "Un
fortunately," he explained, "it
had to be limited because of
recent cuts in federal research
support which have affected the
University budget."
Students are taught how to
handle data, read and construct
graphs, and to utilize common
mathematical equations. They
are getting a thorough knowl
edge of exponential notation
along with a reasonable under
standing of the slide rule.
Students are also acquiring
practical experience in the use
of the chemical balance and a
variety of volumetric techni
ques. Special emphasis is placed
on accuracy and critical analy
ses of data.

mathematical equations. They
are getting a thorough knowl
edge of exponential notation
along with a reasonable under
standing of the slide rule.
Students are also acquiring
practical experience in the use
of the chemical balance and a
variety of volumetric techni
ques. Special emphasis is placed
on accuracy and critical analy
ses of data.
A new program for training
workers from racial minorities
as laboratory assistants and
technicians has been inaugur
ated by the School of Medicine.
The program, which will pro
vide intensified training in lab
oratory procedures for four
months, began in October with
seven students. The students'
backgrounds range from 7 to 12
years of formal education.
Trainees enrolled in the pro
gram receive a salary during
their training. For the first six
weeks, they will be exposed to
formal lectures, films and lab
oratory exercises. For the re
mainder of their training, the
students will work in selected
laboratories in the Medical
School while attending classes
one afternoon a week. After
their training is over, the train
ees will become regular em
ployees at the Medical Center.
The new program is the brain
child of Moses A. Thomas, 30-
year-old laboratory cooidinator
in the Department of Genetics
of the Medical School.
He is also past executive chair
man of the East Palo Alto
NAACP branch.
Thomas found that most be
ginning laboratory technicians
with a college degree in biology
and no experience in a research
laboratory are at once over
trained and undertrained.
"They are overtrained," he
said, "in the sense that they

have been given a great deal of
theoretical knowledge out of
context and they are generally
not able to apply very much of
it to the specific research prob
lems of the laboratory. They are
undertrained in that they have
not been rigorously schooled in
handling even the simplest lab
oratory tools such as pipets, and
modern balances."
He concluded that a person
with less theoretical experience,
but well grounded in laboratory
techniques would be a desirable
laboratory assistant, especially
in laboratories which require
several assistants.
Thomas had plans for a more
ambitious program for minori
ties which would accomodate 20
instead of seven students. "Un
fortunately," he explained, "it
had to be limited because of
recent cuts in federal research
support which have affected the
University budget."
Students are taught how to
handle data, read and construct
graphs, and to utilize common
mathematical equations. They
are getting a thorough knowl
edge of exponential notation
along with a reasonable under
standing of the slide rule.
