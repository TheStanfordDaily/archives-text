# Stanford Law Prof Writes Of Ghetto Police Problem
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
Giving ghetto resident control
over police in their areas is the
best method of law enforcement
available according to Professor
Michael Wald of the Stanford
School of Law.
In the summer/autumn issue
of Stanford Today, a quarterly
university publication, Wald de
scribed the antagonism toward
police by minority residents as
the fault of the white political
community.
In an interview with The
Daily, Wald explained that the
police structure should be de
centralized putting the control
of ghetto police in the hands
of local residents.
He stated that this would be
unpopular with the officers and
the politicians such as mayors
who control the police. Wald
also felt that the idea of separ
ate black police forces would be

resented by the general public
but defended the concept on the
basis of its effectiveness.
"Black police would command
respect, which is vital in a law
ful society, whereas the pres
ence of white police is an in
centive to commit crime," said
Wald.
While better training, recruit
ment and grievance procedures
may help alleviate conflict, "they
will not insure that the police
will act justly in ghetto areas,"
he adds.
A police department reflects
the attitudes of the white major
ity, stated Wald, and will only
be just if the community de
mands that it be just.
"We could cut down 80 per
cent of all police abuses if the
white community wouldn't tol
erate them," said Wald.
"A black police force, con
trolled by ghetto residents,
would be responsive to the

ghetto area, making it more ef
fective as well as more demo
cratic," he explained in the
article.
According to Wald, the na
tional trend toward "law and
order" tends to give the police
man a mandate "to keep public
order at all costs and, more
particularly, don't let the blacjk
man get out of his place or Jottd
him to think he is equayl to
whites."
Police Seen As Colonizers
Police are hated by ghetto
residents because they are view
ed as colonizers and an occupy
ing force of the white commu
nity placed in the ghetto to
make sure its residents do not
become a threat to the larger
community, he commented.
Wald wrote the article as an
attempt to educate the public as
to the problems within our pres
ent police system rather than to
propose a practical solution.
