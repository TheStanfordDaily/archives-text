Condemn Suspension
In addition to the resolution
condemning suspension of Tom
my Smith and John Carlos, two
additional initiatives have re
ceived sufficient signatures to

appear on Wednesday and
Thursday's ballot.
SCLC, as outlined in the Com
mittee of 15 proposal, consists
of six faculty members and five
students. The ASSU president
and speaker of LASSU serve as
ex-officio members, while the
other three students are elected
by the student body.
LASSU ruled at its last meet
ing that the three students fi
nally elected must include at
least one graduate student and
one undergraduate.
The four student members of
the Student Judicial Council
(SJC) are appointed by a stu
dent selection committee con
sisting of two faculty members,
one student from the SJC, and
three students chosen by LA
SSU.
Majority Opinion Of Students
The two initiatives sponsored
by Students for Constructive Ac
tion call on the University ad

ministration to consider major
ity opinion of students in its
actions and suggests the forma
tion of a representative body of
students, faculty, and adminis
tration.
"The administration of Stan
ford University shall not accede
to any demands or vir>lcl to any
coercive tactics made by any
group or organization of stu
dents," the first initiative reads.
The second suggests as a
"constructive alternative to co
ercive tactics" a tripartite body
to "develop procedures for the
determination and communica
tion of facts associated with im
portant issues." This body
would also "establish a legal
procedure for the effective ex
pression of opinion, grievances,
and suggested policy changes."
The Head Yell Leader takes
office at the beginning of winter
quarter.

In addition to the resolution
condemning suspension of Tom
my Smith and John Carlos, two
additional initiatives have re
ceived sufficient signatures to

appear on Wednesday and
Thursday's ballot.
SCLC, as outlined in the Com
mittee of 15 proposal, consists
of six faculty members and five
students. The ASSU president
and speaker of LASSU serve as
ex-officio members, while the
other three students are elected
by the student body.
LASSU ruled at its last meet
ing that the three students fi
nally elected must include at
least one graduate student and
one undergraduate.
The four student members of
the Student Judicial Council
(SJC) are appointed by a stu
dent selection committee con
sisting of two faculty members,
one student from the SJC, and
three students chosen by LA
SSU.
Majority Opinion Of Students
The two initiatives sponsored
by Students for Constructive Ac
tion call on the University ad

ministration to consider major
ity opinion of students in its
actions and suggests the forma
tion of a representative body of
students, faculty, and adminis
tration.
"The administration of Stan
ford University shall not accede
to any demands or vir>lcl to any
coercive tactics made by any
group or organization of stu
dents," the first initiative reads.
The second suggests as a
"constructive alternative to co
ercive tactics" a tripartite body
to "develop procedures for the
determination and communica
tion of facts associated with im
portant issues." This body
would also "establish a legal
procedure for the effective ex
pression of opinion, grievances,
and suggested policy changes."
The Head Yell Leader takes
office at the beginning of winter
quarter.
