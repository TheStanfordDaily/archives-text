## A 						Lovely War 
### HENRY HARRINGTON 
In the bitter, witty post-World War I musical "Oh What a Lovely
War," performed by the Menlo Players Guild, scene after scene
swirls chaotically by as clowns, in multiple roles, "perform the ever
popular war game." Flashing on and off a large screen in the back
stage, punctuating the acted scenes, are statistics and memorabilia
relating to the years of World War I. The disjunct quality, effected
by the juxtaposition of the two mediums, by the clowns acting the
parts of diplomats, generals, and patriotic women, and by the har
mony of the musical score interrupted by ear-shattering explosions
from backstage, lends an air of incongruity to the inherent grue
someness of war.
Wounded soldiers, just returned to England from the front, sing
in a listless monotone, "We're here because we're here," over and
over again in a solipsistic declaration of the absurdity of war.
Scenes like this are effective but the lack of subtlety and the repe
titious insistence on the single point of war's unreal senselessness
make any response to the play beyond nervous laughter difficult.
"A spectator's intellect," said Brecht, whose influence is heavily
felt in this play, "must be left free and highly mobile" by the actor.
L. T. Jordan, as the Master of Ceremonies, is the one performer who
rises above the play, and who is not swept up by the limited topical
ity of the World War I drama. With a loose conversational style,
he is able at points to strike a sympathetic chord between actors
and audience—a chord necessary to a production that is relying on
the Vietnam war for much of its negative appeal.
The director, Eugene Coy, keeps the action lively but, despite a
few quiet scenes, fails to modulate the frantic tone of hysteria that
runs through the musical. He injects several parallels between to
day's war and the far more violent one of the first part of the cen
tury. But finally, these attempts seem strained in a production al
ready loaded with an imbalance of social commentary.
It takes a great deal of entertainment to offset the play's statis
tics —ten million dead, twenty-one million wounded, seven million
missing at the end of the war—projected on the screen at the end
of the production. To the present generation the nostalgia of songs
like "Keep the Home Fires Burning" is insufficient entertainment
to lift the sardonic shroud from "Oh What a Lovely War."

by the juxtaposition of the two mediums, by the clowns acting the
parts of diplomats, generals, and patriotic women, and by the har
mony of the musical score interrupted by ear-shattering explosions
from backstage, lends an air of incongruity to the inherent grue
someness of war.
Wounded soldiers, just returned to England from the front, sing
in a listless monotone, "We're here because we're here," over and
over again in a solipsistic declaration of the absurdity of war.
Scenes like this are effective but the lack of subtlety and the repe
titious insistence on the single point of war's unreal senselessness
make any response to the play beyond nervous laughter difficult.
"A spectator's intellect," said Brecht, whose influence is heavily
felt in this play, "must be left free and highly mobile" by the actor.
L. T. Jordan, as the Master of Ceremonies, is the one performer who
rises above the play, and who is not swept up by the limited topical
ity of the World War I drama. With a loose conversational style,
he is able at points to strike a sympathetic chord between actors
and audience—a chord necessary to a production that is relying on
the Vietnam war for much of its negative appeal.
The director, Eugene Coy, keeps the action lively but, despite a
few quiet scenes, fails to modulate the frantic tone of hysteria that
runs through the musical. He injects several parallels between to
day's war and the far more violent one of the first part of the cen
tury. But finally, these attempts seem strained in a production al
ready loaded with an imbalance of social commentary.
It takes a great deal of entertainment to offset the play's statis
tics —ten million dead, twenty-one million wounded, seven million
missing at the end of the war—projected on the screen at the end
of the production. To the present generation the nostalgia of songs
like "Keep the Home Fires Burning" is insufficient entertainment
to lift the sardonic shroud from "Oh What a Lovely War."
