# Illegitimate Theater

### TODD McCARTHY 
In most of America's larger
cities, there is at least one estab
lished "improvisational" theatre
(The Committee in San Fran
cisco, Second City in Chicago,
etc.) but, due to the select aud
iences that such troupes appeal
to, this type of group has gen
erally not sprung up in smaller
communities. We are indeed for
tunate, then, to have such a
talented and enthusiastic com
pany, The Illegitimate Theatre,
right at our doorstep in Palo
Alto.
Writing a review of an impro
vised show is somewhat difficult
and meaningless, since no two
shows are the same and since
there is no way of knowing if
they are actually bad and you
happened to catch a good show
or vice versa. Judgment can be
made, however, on the basic
format of the theatre. No intro
duction or explanation is offered
at the beginning of the evening,
so when the first (apparently
rehearsed) skit begins, there is
some doubt in the audience's
mind as to just what the eve
ning will consist of.
Despite these criticisms, there
is one fact that is undeniable:
these people are genuinely and
honestly funny. The program

states that most of the cast
members had never been on
stage before joining the troupe
and in this situation, that is an
attribute, not a fault. There is
no pretention and no attempt on
the part of the cast to put any
thing over on the audience.
The code of the company
states:
"The Illegitimate Theatre
hopes to entertain you in as
many ways as it can. We make
only one promise: That we will
be who we are at all times
with as much sincerity and
love as is possible to bring to
the immediate situation. To see
us and be with us is all we ask
of you; and, in turn, we shall
flourish happily together."
This promise is well upheld,
even three years after the for
mation of the company. Such
dedication to purpose and con
tinued realization of their innate
responsibility to the audience as
performers is to be admired. As
the advertisements say, "Sup
port Your Illegitimate Theatre!"
It deserves it.
The Illegitimate Theatre is
located at 117 University Ave.
in Palo Alto. Performances are
on Friday and Saturday nights
at 9 and 11 p.m.
