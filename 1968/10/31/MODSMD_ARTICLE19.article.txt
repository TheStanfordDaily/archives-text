# Rachel â€” Rachel A Cinema Review
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
In the world of film, the sixties has been the decade of the direc
tor, in which the director has emerged the most important factor
in the making of a film. It has also been a time when many leading
ictors (Marlon Brando, Albert Finney, Warren Beatty) have
>witched their interests to the behind-the-scenes aspect of movies.
In his directional debut, Paul Newman demonstrates a fine eye
'or detail, in tune with the modern techniques being used today.
3ut the poignant little story called "Rachel, Rachel," is a throwback
to the drama of the 1950's where the two inoder clash.
Though Newman evokes a perfect color tone from the redbrick
school house, the young children and the emptiness of Rachel's
world, he should have filmed his story in black and white. If he
really wanted his style to fit his material he should have deempha
sized stylish focus changes and hallucinatory scenes.
Unfortunately, however, this is 1968, when no movies are made
in black and white. Considering the limitations of the times, New
man probably did as best he could. One can certainly look forward
to his future films.
Effective Acting
The film is not the classic it would have been ten years ago, but
it is still quite effective. The acting is nothing short of superb.
Newman has chosen unknowns to play the inhabitants of the small
town, and they are all completely natural.
Joanne Woodward, Newman's real-life wife, is a great actress
but not a star. Yet here she gives a performance that tops any
given by a "star" in quite sometime. She achieves the proper re
sponse at evry momnt, even when the script falters.
There are several structural mistakes made along the way. A
small town revival meeting (with a jarringly out of place h'ppie
in attendance) is much too long and insignificant. Also, there are
several irrelevant flashbacks to Rachel's youth. These scenes, how
ever, afford us a look at the Newmans' real-life daughter who
could easily be as prominent a screen personality as either of her
parents.
