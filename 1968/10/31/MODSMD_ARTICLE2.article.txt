• l\o End To Strike
NEW YORK (AP) — A strik
ing teachers union rejected
Wednesday a state-advanced
plan to end the tieup of the 1.1-
million-pupil New York City
public school system, a bitter
racial as well as educational
crisis.
Albert Shanker, president of
the predominantly white AFL
CIO United Federation of Teach
ers, called the state's proposal
a "step backward."
By its action, the union of
55,000 members doomed a vast
majority of the city's children
to continued exile from class
rooms. They already have lost
24 days of schooling in the new
fall term.
A peace plan proposed Tues
day by State Education Com
missioner James E. Allen al
ready had been accepted by the
Negro and Puerto Rican Ocean
Hill-Brownsville school district
in Brooklyn.
Allen's plan provided for the
reinstatement in Ocean Hill
classrooms of 79 white,teachers
whose ouster by the local gov
erning board originally brought
on the UFT strike.
But Shanker widened the
range of the union's demands to
include teacher security in two
other experimental school dis
tricts, set up with Ocean Hill
last year to test the theory of
community control.
Allen's plan had called for a
state takeover and trusteeship
for Ocean Hill's eight schools,
with the continued suspension
of the 19-member local govern
ing body until order was fully
restored.
• Nobel Prizes To U.S.
STOCKHOLM (AP) — Ameri
cans completed a clean sweep
Wednesday of the 1968 Nobel
prizes in science, getting the
awards in physics and chemis
try.
Luis W. Alvarez, 57, of the
University of California at
Berkeley won the prize in phys
ics and Norwegian-born Lars
Onsager, 6*l, of Yale University
was given the one in chemistry.
They join three Americans
who earlier this month shared
the prize for medicine and phys
iology. The peace prize went to
a Frenchman and the literature
prize to a Japanese. Each prize
this year is worth a record
$70,000.
The Swedish Academy of Sci
ence cited both men for work so
technical it is difficult for lay
men to understand.
The academy said that Alvar
ez's discovery of hitherto unsus
pected particles in the atom was
one of "the decisive contribu
tions to elementary particle
physics."
Onsager was cited for his
theory of "reciprocal relations"
which the academy said "laid
the foundation for the thermo
dynamics of irreversible pro
cesses."
Thermodynamics plays a vital
role in the entire chemical in
dustry, ranging through drugs
and synthetics to oil refineries.

Onsager's work primarily is
an analysis of the change in the
structure of molecules—a com
bination of atoms —when the
heat of the molecules is raised
or lowered.

• iVo Suspension End
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A
federal judge in San Francisco
Wednesday turned down a re
quest from 50 University of Cali
fornia students to lift the in

their arrest during a sit-in at
UC's Moses Hall Oct. 23.
U.S. District Judge Albert C.
Wollenberg refused to issue an
injunction voiding the suspen
sions or to stop the university
from conducting hearings which
could bring formal suspension
of the students.
Attorney Leo Paoli cor tended
in the petition that the students'
rights to due process and equal
protection of laws were denied
them. He also argued that some
male students might suffer "ir
reparable injury", such as loss
of draft exemptions should the
suspensions become permanent.
The students were among 76
persons arrested after barricad

for 15 hours to demand credit
be given for a course on racism
which featured 10 lectures by

Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver.

• Down To Earth
MOSCOW (AP) — Soviet Cos

brought his gleaming white So

back to earth Wednesday after
nearly four days of relatively
routine orbiting.
Parachutes landed the craft in
snow on steppes of Kazakhstan.
There was wide speculation
that Beregovoy's flight was the
final test needed to prove the
multiseat Soyuz capable of or

test 18 months ago ended in dis
aster as Soyuz 1 crashed and
killed its pilot, Col. Vladimir
Komarov.
Signs of failure persisted
through Beregovoy's flight, how

of his approach in orbit to an un
manned Soyuz 2 craft, but failed
to confirm they linked up. The
Russians have never duplicated

the U.S. feat of manned dock

In a speech to the Knesset, Is

He gave these other figures:

NEW YORK (AP) — A strik

Wednesday a state-advanced

public school system, a bitter
racial as well as educational
crisis.
Albert Shanker, president of
the predominantly white AFL
CIO United Federation of Teach

a "step backward."
By its action, the union of
55,000 members doomed a vast
majority of the city's children
to continued exile from class
rooms. They already have lost
24 days of schooling in the new
fall term.
A peace plan proposed Tues
day by State Education Com
missioner James E. Allen al

Hill-Brownsville school district

Allen's plan provided for the

on the UFT strike.

Albert Shanker, president of

By its action, the union of

• l\o End To Strike
NEW YORK (AP) — A strik

Wednesday a state-advanced
plan to end the tieup of the 1.1-
million-pupil New York City
public school system, a bitter
racial as well as educational
crisis.
Albert Shanker, president of
the predominantly white AFL
CIO United Federation of Teach
ers, called the state's proposal
a "step backward."
By its action, the union of
55,000 members doomed a vast
majority of the city's children
to continued exile from class
rooms. They already have lost
24 days of schooling in the new
fall term.
A peace plan proposed Tues
day by State Education Com
missioner James E. Allen al
ready had been accepted by the
Negro and Puerto Rican Ocean
Hill-Brownsville school district
in Brooklyn.
Allen's plan provided for the
reinstatement in Ocean Hill
classrooms of 79 white,teachers
whose ouster by the local gov

on the UFT strike.
But Shanker widened the
range of the union's demands to
include teacher security in two
other experimental school dis
tricts, set up with Ocean Hill
last year to test the theory of
community control.
Allen's plan had called for a
state takeover and trusteeship

• Nobel Prizes To U.S.
STOCKHOLM (AP) — Ameri
cans completed a clean sweep
Wednesday of the 1968 Nobel
prizes in science, getting the
awards in physics and chemis
try.
Luis W. Alvarez, 57, of the
University of California at
Berkeley won the prize in phys
ics and Norwegian-born Lars
Onsager, 6*l, of Yale University
was given the one in chemistry.
They join three Americans
who earlier this month shared
the prize for medicine and phys
iology. The peace prize went to
a Frenchman and the literature
prize to a Japanese. Each prize
this year is worth a record
$70,000.
The Swedish Academy of Sci
ence cited both men for work so
technical it is difficult for lay
men to understand.
The academy said that Alvar
ez's discovery of hitherto unsus
pected particles in the atom was
one of "the decisive contribu
tions to elementary particle
physics."
Onsager was cited for his
theory of "reciprocal relations"
which the academy said "laid
the foundation for the thermo
dynamics of irreversible pro
cesses."
Thermodynamics plays a vital
role in the entire chemical in
dustry, ranging through drugs
and synthetics to oil refineries.

Onsager's work primarily is
an analysis of the change in the
structure of molecules—a com
bination of atoms —when the
heat of the molecules is raised
