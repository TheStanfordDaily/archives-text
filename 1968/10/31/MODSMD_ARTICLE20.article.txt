In 1960 many independent voters could not see
much difference between John F. Kennedy and Richard
M. Nixon, two seemingly cool, calculating, ambitious
young politicians. However, this newspaper believed
that there were significant differences in conviction
and outlook. We endorsed Mr. Kennedy.
In 1968 many voters assert that they cannot see
much difference between Mr. Nixon and Hubert H.
Humphrey, but, again, this newspaper believes that
there are significant differences in conviction and
outlook. We endorse Mr. Humphrey.
it it it
Mr. Humphrey has superior claims to the Presidency
in three critical areas. The first of these is foreign
affairs, specifically arms control and the search for
peace. The most important international issue t day is
a slowing of the nuclear arms race. The competition in
these deadly weapons is once more spiraling upward
and threatens to slip out of human control. No subject
will be more important for the next President. For
nearly twenty years Mr. Humphrey has devoted him
self tirelessly to this problem. He was the author of
the bill establishing an independent Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency in 1961. In season and out he
worked to stop the nuclear tests which were poisoning
the atmosphere, efforts that finally resulted in the
limited Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. President Kennedy
was indulging in no exaggeration when he said to
Mr. Humphrey: "This is youi treaty:"
Mr. Humphrey is now actively working for the
ratification of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty,
which would commit the existing nuclear nations not
to distribute nuclear weapons to other countries. He
would, we believe, dedicate himself wholeheartedly
to the search for practical ways of lessening the over
whelming nuclear danger. As the original proponent
of the Peace Corps and of the Food-for-Peace Pro
gram, he has the talent and the active concern needed
to strengthen the United Nations and to build new
international institutions.
In contrast, Mr. Nixon took no initiative on disarma
ment when he was Vice President and showed much
less interest in the subject. He is now urging a delay
in the ratification of the Nonproliferation Treaty. Even
worse, he has resurrected the "missile gap" argument
misused by President Kennedy and insists that he will
not enter into arms negotiations with the Soviet Union
until sometime in the future when this country has
reached new and unspecified superiority in nuclear
strength. He is busily promising to outstrip the Rus
sians in space and to build a nuclear Navy "second to
none." The United States does not need a President
intent on speeding up both the arms race and the
space race.

In addition to being an internationalist with a broad
and imaginative outlook in foreign affairs, Mr. Hum
phrey is a proven activist in domestic affairs. He was
the original sponsor of Medicare and the skillful parlia
mentary manager for much of the social reform legisla
tion enacted during the Kennedy-Johnson Administra
tions. He fully understands that the desperately urgent
needs of the nation's cities for better housing, higher
quality education, cleaner air, improved hospitals and
mass transit facilities can only be met if there is vig
orous Presidential leadership and coherent public
planning.
While Mr. Humphrey attempts to get to the root
of urban problems, Mr. Nixon is promising, in effect,
to attack the surface signs of social unrest by more
energetic use of police measures. His modest proposals
for encouraging "black capitalism through tax incen
tives are all right as far as they go, but they do not
go very far. His is an essentially conservative eco
nomic strategy involving deferment of costly new
domestic programs for years. This strategy is full of
danger, threatening decay and congestion for the
nation's hard-pressed cities.

The third area in which Mr. Humphrey is unques
tionably preferable to his opponent lies in the quality
of his political leadership and in the character of his
political support. Mr. Humphrey is the only candidate
in this election who has substantial backing in both
the white and the Negro communities. He has earned

Negro trust because no man in public life has worked
harder or longer to achieve equality of opportunity for
all citizens. It is a matter for considerable concern
whether the next President will be able to communicate
effectively with black as well as white citizens and
whether in his capacity as a national party leader he
sees himself primarily competing with George C.
Wallace for reactionary segregationist votes or as
heading a liberal-and-moderate coalition drawn from
both races.
An endorsement of a candidate is in this instance
also a favorable judgment on the personality and
character of one man and an adverse judgment on
his rival. Mr. Humphrey is a warm, generous, idealistic,
open man. Mr. Nixon has gradually ' risen above the
personal abuse and the narrow partisanship of his
early campaigns, but he remains slick and evasive on
some of the central issues.
★ ★ ★
We have lett until last the perplexing question of
Vietnam. As we have made clear in many previous
editorials, The Times does not find the statements
of either candidate satisfactory on the war issue. But
Mr. Humphrey has given unmistakable signals that
he intends, if elected, to move away from the errors
of the past. It is our judgment, based on an appraisal
of the character and public record of the two candi
dates, that Mr. Humphrey would be more inclined
than his opponent to seize the initiative for peace.
It must be borne in mind that the Vice-Presidency
is a uniquely awkward office. No man has ever been
seen at his best in it. A Vice President is in a weak
position because he has no personal mandate from
the people separate from that of the President 011
whose ticket he was elected. Yet he has a constitu
tional responsibility to serve as the President's stand
in, a responsibility which he cannot relinquish as
easily as a Cabinet officer or lesser official can resign
an appointive office.
Like most of his predecessors, Mr. Humphrey has
resolved the ambiguities of his office in favor of de
fending the President's policies in public and trying
to influence them in private. Not until the memoirs
of the Johnson Administration have been written will
it be possible to assess Mr. Humphrey's role in the
international policy struggles of this Administration
over the "bombing pauses" and other Vietnam deci
sions. But it is significant that the former members
of the Johnson Administration who are rallying to Mr.
Humphrey's support include its best-known doves.
Looked at in the perspective of his 23 years in
public life, Hubert Humphrey is a humanitarian, an
authentic and effective liberal, and a man of proved
character, courage and judgment who can be depended
upon to lead the nation in the ways of peace.
In the span of the present campaign, proof that his
judgment is superior to that of Mr. Nixon has been
provided by their respective choices for Vice President.
Senator Edmund S. Muskie has experience, dignity
and moral force. He is in himself a cogent argument
for preferring the Democratic ticket, especially when
it is recalled that four Vice Presidents in this century
have succeeded to the Presidency on the death of the
incumbent.
In the brief period since nomination, Gov. Spiro T.
Agnew has already proved from his injudicious, intem
perate remarks that he is utterly inadequate.
★ ★ ★
The sole persuasive argument offered for Mr. Nixon's
election is that he might produce a period of calm
and consolidation. But this presupposes that he is a
popular and widely trusted figure like General Eisen
hower, which he manifestly is not, as his divisive and
partisan record over the years makes clear. Moreover,
the strenuous demands upon America's leadership both
at home and abroad do not permit four years of rest
and passivity. This critical era calls for a leader with
ideas, enthusiasm, energy and a clear moral commit
ment.
This newspaper believes that Hubert 11. Humphrey
is such a leader, and in the truly critical situation —
foreign and domestic—in which this country finds
itself, we strongly urge his election to the Presidency
of the United States.
