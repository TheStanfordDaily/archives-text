## Pogo Stick On The Moon? 
### 
A pogo stick that will enable
astronauts to hop across the
rugged lunar landscape in 50-
foot jumps is on the drafting
boards of an engineering re
search group.
It is to be no ordinary pogo

stick, however. It will have a
seat for the astronaut, gyro
scopes to keep him upright, and
rocket jets to help him steer
to safe landings. Guidance may
even be computerized.
"The moon has no air to fly

in, no water to float on, no road
to roll over," said project leader
Dr. Howard S. Seifert, professor
of aeronautical engineering.
"But hopping," he added, "is
well adapted to the weak lunar
gravity—only one-sixth of the

earth's."
Working under support from
the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, his re
search group consists of five
graduate students. The current
design is a refinement of a heav
ier, longer-range pogo trans
porter proposed last year by Sei
fert.
The plans call for a 1200-pound
vehicle that will bounce on a
piston operated by compressed
gas. Because most of the gas
will be re-compressed by land
ing, very little will be used in
each leap. The pogo should go
feet straight up. Taking off at a
45-degree angle would carry it
to a landing fifty feet away.
Figures indicate that the pogo
stick vehicle could jump thirty
ten miles to the gallon; rockets
require about ten gallons per
mile.
At this rate the lunar pogo
stick should able to go about
10 miles in 1000 leaps. Average
speed would be about seven
miles per hour, but this would
vary greatly depending on
pauses and the terrain.
Among the project's "un
knowns" now being studied is
the human being's ability to
stand repeated bounces at great
pressure. The group's next ma
jor step will be to build a dem
onstration model of the lunar
pogo for tests in sand beds.

even be computerized.
"The moon has no air to fly

in, no water to float on, no road
to roll over," said project leader
Dr. Howard S. Seifert, professor
of aeronautical engineering.
"But hopping," he added, "is
well adapted to the weak lunar
gravity—only one-sixth of the

earth's."
Working under support from
the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, his re
search group consists of five
graduate students. The current
design is a refinement of a heav
ier, longer-range pogo trans
porter proposed last year by Sei
fert.
The plans call for a 1200-pound
vehicle that will bounce on a
piston operated by compressed
gas. Because most of the gas
will be re-compressed by land
ing, very little will be used in
each leap. The pogo should go
feet straight up. Taking off at a
45-degree angle would carry it
to a landing fifty feet away.
Figures indicate that the pogo
stick vehicle could jump thirty
ten miles to the gallon; rockets
require about ten gallons per
mile.
At this rate the lunar pogo
stick should able to go about
10 miles in 1000 leaps. Average
speed would be about seven
miles per hour, but this would
vary greatly depending on
pauses and the terrain.
Among the project's "un
knowns" now being studied is
the human being's ability to
stand repeated bounces at great
pressure. The group's next ma
jor step will be to build a dem
onstration model of the lunar
pogo for tests in sand beds.


POGO STICK —A lunar travel device that will enable astronauts to
hop across the moon's surface in 50-foot jumps is on the drafting
boards of an engineering research group here. Unlike ordinary pogo
sticks, this one will have a seat for the astronaut, gyroscopes to
keep him upright, and rocket jets to help him steer to safe land
ings. The vehicle will weight 1200 pounds and will bounce on a
piston operated by compressed gas.
A pogo stick that will enable
astronauts to hop across the
rugged lunar landscape in 50-
foot jumps is on the drafting
boards of an engineering re

It is to be no ordinary pogo

stick, however. It will have a
seat for the astronaut, gyro
scopes to keep him upright, and
rocket jets to help him steer
to safe landings. Guidance may
even be computerized.
