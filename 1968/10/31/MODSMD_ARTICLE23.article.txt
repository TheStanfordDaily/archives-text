# Have Humanities Failed Man?
## 
### 
"We have conquered the phy
sical universe, but we fail to con
quer ourselves," Professor John
W. Dodds writes in Stanford To
day, the University quarterly.
The former director of Special
Programs in the Humanities
states, "We suffer the tragic
flaw of being embedded in hu
manity. It is bootless to com
plain that science as such has
failed us, or to indulge in the
easy accusation that it is science
which has brought us to the
edge of global disaster.
"Science has not failed us; the
futility is that of men unable
to reconcile their advance in
knowledge with their humanity.
"If we are hunting scapegoats
we must be prepared to admit
the possibility that it is the hu
manities, full of talk about the
good life and the dignity of man,
which have failed. Wasn't it Po
go who said: 'We have met the
enemy and he is—us!' "
Deplores Cult of Despair
The emeritus professor of En
glish and founder of the Stan
ford Religious Studies program
deplores some of today's au
thors and their cult of despair.
"Eden has disappeared; the
snake remains. Although there
is some evidence to support this
point of view, I would suggest
it is over-universalized. Despair

can become a habit—even a fash
ion."
Dodds declares, "The wise hu
manist is reluctant to substitute
the part for the whole. He tries
to see life steadily, to admire the
good in human nature as well
as to deplore the evil, to be an
gry about injustice but not to
think that justice itself is a
phantom, to be compassionate,
but not to destroy the value of
his compassion by wearing it as
a self-conscious virtue."
Teachers in the humanities
must stress the relevance of the
humanities in today's world and
furnish guidelines for the stu
dent to construct his scale of
values.
Humanities As Moral Agents
"The humanities are in their
very nature moral agents. They
don't solve all the mysteries, but
they do help us to organize our
world so that we can accept the
mysteries with equanimity . . .
"The great problem facing the
humanities is not to preach . . .
but to show, through the rich
ness and relevance of our cul
tural heritage how these (ideals
of tolerance, understanding,
faith, justice, freedom, dignity
and honor) are possible of at
tainment by individual human
beings—and possible today," he
believes.

Humanities As Moral Agents
"The humanities are in their
very nature moral agents. They
don't solve all the mysteries, but
they do help us to organize our
world so that we can accept the
mysteries with equanimity . . .
"The great problem facing the
humanities is not to preach . . .
but to show, through the rich
ness and relevance of our cul
tural heritage how these (ideals
of tolerance, understanding,
faith, justice, freedom, dignity
and honor) are possible of at
tainment by individual human
beings—and possible today," he
believes.
"We have conquered the phy
sical universe, but we fail to con
quer ourselves," Professor John
W. Dodds writes in Stanford To
day, the University quarterly.
The former director of Special
Programs in the Humanities
states, "We suffer the tragic
flaw of being embedded in hu
manity. It is bootless to com
plain that science as such has
failed us, or to indulge in the
easy accusation that it is science
which has brought us to the
edge of global disaster.
"Science has not failed us; the
futility is that of men unable
to reconcile their advance in
knowledge with their humanity.
"If we are hunting scapegoats
we must be prepared to admit
the possibility that it is the hu
manities, full of talk about the
good life and the dignity of man,
which have failed. Wasn't it Po
go who said: 'We have met the
enemy and he is—us!' "
Deplores Cult of Despair
The emeritus professor of En
glish and founder of the Stan
ford Religious Studies program
deplores some of today's au
thors and their cult of despair.
"Eden has disappeared; the
snake remains. Although there
is some evidence to support this
point of view, I would suggest
it is over-universalized. Despair

can become a habit—even a fash
ion."
Dodds declares, "The wise hu
manist is reluctant to substitute
the part for the whole. He tries
to see life steadily, to admire the
good in human nature as well
as to deplore the evil, to be an
gry about injustice but not to
think that justice itself is a
phantom, to be compassionate,
but not to destroy the value of
his compassion by wearing it as
a self-conscious virtue."
Teachers in the humanities
must stress the relevance of the
humanities in today's world and
furnish guidelines for the stu
dent to construct his scale of
values.
