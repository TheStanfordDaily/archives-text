# Man On The Move -- Mark Marquess
## 
### ART SNYDER 
"The Man On The Move" is
a more apt title for Stanford's
Mark Marquess. And the reason
for this title is the amazing
versatility that is contained in
this 5 foot 11 inch, 179 pound
dynamo from Stockton, Cali
fornia.
Mark was the starting split
end for Saturday's game against
U.C.L.A. in the Los Angeles
Coliseum. This may not be uni
que, but it is interesting that
this was the fifth position for
Mark this year.
During the pre-season Mark
tried out for the quarterback
position he played last year, and
was also used as a flanker and
split end. When the season be
gan, Mark was moved to his old
safety position, which was not
totally foreign since he played
safety when he was a sopho

more. The season progressed
and saw Marquess alternating
between defensive halfback and
safety, depending on the injury
situation.
Then catastrophe struck the
Tribe in Palouse country, and
the Indian's starting split end,
Jack Lasater, suffered a shoul
der separation and was out for
the rest of the season after he
underwent surgery. Marquess
was again called on for duty,
this time as split end.
Throughout all this time Mark
has been attending chalk talks
and meetings for quarterbacks,
ends, flankers, and defensive
backs. Thus one can appreciate
the time that is really involved.
Now most people would think
that the story ends right here,
but it doesn't. Immediately fol
lowing the U.C.L.A. game, Mark
flew to Tucson, Arizona, where

he joined 17 other teammates
and a staff of four coaches to
practice for a week before trav
eling on to Mexico City, Mexico,
for the Mexico Invitational Base
ball Tournament. Marquess was
selected to this team following
his performance on the Ist U.S.
Baseball Team to ever win the
Pan Am Championship last
summer in Winnipeg, Canada.
Mark was also selected to the
Team Ail-American squad at
first base his sophomore year,
and batted .409 for the season.
As a junior last year Marquess
was 2nd Team Ail-American at
first base. The tournament in
Mexico will he played from No
vember 2—November 12, thus
Mark will miss the O.S.U. and
University of Washington foot
ball games. But he will return
to play the remaining games
against U.O.P. and Cal.

When asked to make some
statement about Mark Mar
quess. "Dutch" Fehring, past
Stanford baseball coach, and
President of the U.S. Baseball
Federation (also Chairman of
the U.S. Olympic Baseball
Games Committee) said tin* fol
lowing: "Mark Marquess is one
of tlr 1 finest athletes and young
men I've ever been associated
with in over 30 years of coach
ing. He has excellent abilities
and hustles 150 percent all the
time."
"A lot of boys that would
com: 1 out of the middle of foot
ba'l seasn like Mark wuldn't
be in baseball shape," Fehring
continued. "But Mark has been
hitting and catching with some
of his buddies here at tSanford
for over a month, besides play
ing football every day. Mark's
leadership qualities will mean a
great deal to our U.S. team, just
as it did for our U.S. team in the
Pan Am Games last summer in
Winnipeg, Canada."
In a time where to be disci
plined in anything is far from
the public eye and spirit, Mark
Marquess stands out as a young
man who meets great chal
lenges. Besides all his work in
the world of athletics, he is also
a 2.9 student majoring in politi
cal science.

this 5 foot 11 inch, 179 pound
dynamo from Stockton, Cali
fornia.
Mark was the starting split
end for Saturday's game against
U.C.L.A. in the Los Angeles
Coliseum. This may not be uni
que, but it is interesting that
this was the fifth position for
Mark this year.
During the pre-season Mark
tried out for the quarterback
position he played last year, and
was also used as a flanker and
split end. When the season be
gan, Mark was moved to his old
safety position, which was not
totally foreign since he played
safety when he was a sopho

more. The season progressed
and saw Marquess alternating
between defensive halfback and
safety, depending on the injury
situation.
Then catastrophe struck the
Tribe in Palouse country, and
the Indian's starting split end,
Jack Lasater, suffered a shoul
der separation and was out for
the rest of the season after he
underwent surgery. Marquess
was again called on for duty,
this time as split end.
Throughout all this time Mark
has been attending chalk talks
and meetings for quarterbacks,
ends, flankers, and defensive
backs. Thus one can appreciate
the time that is really involved.
Now most people would think
that the story ends right here,
but it doesn't. Immediately fol
lowing the U.C.L.A. game, Mark
flew to Tucson, Arizona, where

he joined 17 other teammates
and a staff of four coaches to
practice for a week before trav
eling on to Mexico City, Mexico,
for the Mexico Invitational Base
ball Tournament. Marquess was
selected to this team following
his performance on the Ist U.S.
Baseball Team to ever win the
Pan Am Championship last
summer in Winnipeg, Canada.
Mark was also selected to the
Team Ail-American squad at
first base his sophomore year,
and batted .409 for the season.
As a junior last year Marquess
was 2nd Team Ail-American at
first base. The tournament in
Mexico will he played from No
vember 2—November 12, thus
Mark will miss the O.S.U. and
University of Washington foot
ball games. But he will return
to play the remaining games
against U.O.P. and Cal.

When asked to make some
statement about Mark Mar
quess. "Dutch" Fehring, past
Stanford baseball coach, and
President of the U.S. Baseball
Federation (also Chairman of
the U.S. Olympic Baseball
Games Committee) said tin* fol
lowing: "Mark Marquess is one
of tlr 1 finest athletes and young
men I've ever been associated
with in over 30 years of coach
ing. He has excellent abilities
and hustles 150 percent all the
time."
"A lot of boys that would
com: 1 out of the middle of foot
ba'l seasn like Mark wuldn't
be in baseball shape," Fehring
continued. "But Mark has been
hitting and catching with some
of his buddies here at tSanford
for over a month, besides play
ing football every day. Mark's
leadership qualities will mean a
great deal to our U.S. team, just
as it did for our U.S. team in the
Pan Am Games last summer in
Winnipeg, Canada."
In a time where to be disci
plined in anything is far from
the public eye and spirit, Mark
Marquess stands out as a young
man who meets great chal
lenges. Besides all his work in
the world of athletics, he is also
a 2.9 student majoring in politi
cal science.

U.C.L.A. in the Los Angeles
Coliseum. This may not be uni
que, but it is interesting that
this was the fifth position for
Mark this year.
During the pre-season Mark
tried out for the quarterback
position he played last year, and
was also used as a flanker and
split end. When the season be
gan, Mark was moved to his old
safety position, which was not
totally foreign since he played
safety when he was a sopho

more. The season progressed
and saw Marquess alternating
between defensive halfback and
safety, depending on the injury
situation.
Then catastrophe struck the
Tribe in Palouse country, and
the Indian's starting split end,
Jack Lasater, suffered a shoul
der separation and was out for
the rest of the season after he
underwent surgery. Marquess
was again called on for duty,
this time as split end.
Throughout all this time Mark
has been attending chalk talks
and meetings for quarterbacks,
ends, flankers, and defensive
backs. Thus one can appreciate
the time that is really involved.
Now most people would think
that the story ends right here,
but it doesn't. Immediately fol
lowing the U.C.L.A. game, Mark
flew to Tucson, Arizona, where

he joined 17 other teammates
and a staff of four coaches to
practice for a week before trav
eling on to Mexico City, Mexico,
for the Mexico Invitational Base
ball Tournament. Marquess was
selected to this team following
his performance on the Ist U.S.
Baseball Team to ever win the
Pan Am Championship last
summer in Winnipeg, Canada.
Mark was also selected to the
Team Ail-American squad at
first base his sophomore year,
and batted .409 for the season.
As a junior last year Marquess
was 2nd Team Ail-American at
first base. The tournament in
Mexico will he played from No
vember 2—November 12, thus
Mark will miss the O.S.U. and
University of Washington foot
ball games. But he will return
to play the remaining games
against U.O.P. and Cal.

When asked to make some
statement about Mark Mar
quess. "Dutch" Fehring, past
Stanford baseball coach, and
President of the U.S. Baseball
Federation (also Chairman of
the U.S. Olympic Baseball
Games Committee) said tin* fol
lowing: "Mark Marquess is one
of tlr 1 finest athletes and young
men I've ever been associated
with in over 30 years of coach
ing. He has excellent abilities
and hustles 150 percent all the
time."
"A lot of boys that would
com: 1 out of the middle of foot
ba'l seasn like Mark wuldn't
be in baseball shape," Fehring
continued. "But Mark has been
hitting and catching with some
of his buddies here at tSanford
for over a month, besides play
ing football every day. Mark's
leadership qualities will mean a
great deal to our U.S. team, just
as it did for our U.S. team in the
Pan Am Games last summer in
Winnipeg, Canada."
In a time where to be disci
plined in anything is far from
the public eye and spirit, Mark
Marquess stands out as a young
man who meets great chal
lenges. Besides all his work in
the world of athletics, he is also
a 2.9 student majoring in politi
cal science.
