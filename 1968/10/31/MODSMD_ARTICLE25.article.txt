# Indian Athletes Reap Rich Olympic Harvest
## 
### GARY CAVALLI 
The 19th edition of the Olym
pic games concluded a few days
ago in Mexico, with American
athletes taking home an amaz
ing 106 medals. Stanford ath
letes made a substantial contri
bution to the American effort,
winning seven medals and play
ing a part in the garnering of
three others.
The following is a sport-by
sport breakdown of Stanford
athletes' performances in the
1968 Olympiad.
SWIMMING
Stanford swimmers Brent
Berk, Greg Buckingham, John
Ferris, Mitch Ivey, Luis Nicolao
and Mike Wall competed in the
Olympics this year, and all six
swam excellently. Buckingham,
Ferris and Ivey took home med
als, Wall contributed to two
American golds in relay events,
while Berk and Nicolao were
victimized by fite in their quest
for Olympic medals.
Buckingham, one of Stanford's
most valuable swimmers on the
1967 NCAA championship team,
finished a close second to In
diana's Charlie Hickok in the
200 Individual Medley, then cor
raled a fourth in the 400 IM,
winding up three seconds back
of Hickok's winning time of
4:48.1 in that one.
Ferris was right behind Buck
ingham in the 200 IM for his
first bronze medal. The Indian
sophomore, bothered like so
many other athletes by the high
altitude, fainted on the victory
stand. But Ferris came back a
few days later to claim another
third in the 200 butterfly with
an eqcellent time of 2:09.3.
Stanford swimming coach Jim
Gaughran felt Ferris may have
been able to win the race had
tie been assigned a lane next to
Pennsylvania's Carl Robie (the
eventual winner) rather than
next to Santa Clara's great
Mark Spitz, who finished a sur
prising last.

"John might have won if he'd
been put next to Robie," Gaugh
ran expalined. "Instead, he was
over next to Spitz, and figured
all he'd have to do was stay
even with him. But Spitz did
nothing."
Another Stanford sophomore,
Mitch Ivey, took home a silver
medal in the 200 backstroke.
Ivey had the fastest qualifying
time, but East Germany's Rolan
Matthes broke an Olympic rec
ord to edge Ivey in the finals.
IMatthes clocked 2:09 flat to
Ivey's 2:10.
'68 graduate Mike Wall made
the Olympic team as an alter
nate in the 800 and 1500 free
style relays, but was given a
chance to swim in the trials in
both events because of his great
performances in practice.
"Mike worked real hard,"
Coach Gaughran remarked. "He
put out a full effort, and got
to swim in the relay trials. It's
a great tribute to him."
Sophomore Brent Berk had
the fifth fastest qualifying time
in the 400 freestyle, 4:20.2, but
was sick the day of the finals
and finished far off the pace.
"The altitude must have gotten
to him," Gaughran conjectured.
"He was sick and just went
through the motions in the fi
nals."
Another victim of bad luck
was senior Luis Nicolao, swim
ming for his native Argentina.
After Nicolao finished seventh
in the 100 freestyle, clocking
53.9, he qualified for the semi
finals in the 100 butterfly, his
best event.
But when the semi-final race
began, Nicolao was nowhere in
sight—he'd gotten caught in a
marathon race and was unable
to reach the Olympic pool.
"It must have been a tremen
dous blow to Luey," Gaughran
said sadly. "He's held the world
record in that event, and had a
good chance to win it. He's been
living for that race."

TRACK
Bill Toomey, a Stanford stu
dent during the school year
1962-63, won the doeatholon, giv
ing him a legitimate claim to be
ing the world's greatest athlete.
Toomey, a native of Palo Alio,
won the 10-event, 2-day endur
ance test with an incredible
blend of speed, strength and
stamina. An exhausted, but ju
bilant Toomey won the doeath
olon with a record-setting 8193
points.
Senior Peter Boyce, compet
ing for his Australian homeland,
was off form and failed to qual
ify for the finals in the high
jump.
Sprinter Larry Questad failed
to qualify for the finals in the
200 meter dash, but ran a leg on
the 400 meter tandem in the
semi-finals.
WATER POLO
'68 graduate Gary Sheerer,
perhaps the world's greatest
water polo player, sparked the
American team to two victories
and a 6-6 tie with Cuba before
suffering a shoulder separation.
Another '68 grad, defensive spe
cialist John Parker, earned a
starting berth on the U.S. squad
and played very well.
Without Sheerer, their lead
ing scorer, the Americans had
to be content with a fifth place
in the Olympics.
ROWING
Larry Hough, a Stanford grad
uate currently in the Navy,
teamed with Tony Johnson to
win a silver medal in the pairs
without coxswain event. Hough
and Johnson lost only their sec
ond race in two years, but
nearly caught the winning tan
dem of Jorg Lucke and Heittz-
Jurgen Bothe of Germany. The
Germans were timed in 7:26.56,
while Hought and Johnson
clocked 7:26.71 in the slight
wind.

IMatthes clocked 2:09 flat to
Ivey's 2:10.
'68 graduate Mike Wall made
the Olympic team as an alter
nate in the 800 and 1500 free
style relays, but was given a
chance to swim in the trials in
both events because of his great
performances in practice.
"Mike worked real hard,"
Coach Gaughran remarked. "He
put out a full effort, and got
to swim in the relay trials. It's
a great tribute to him."
Sophomore Brent Berk had
the fifth fastest qualifying time
in the 400 freestyle, 4:20.2, but
was sick the day of the finals
and finished far off the pace.
"The altitude must have gotten
to him," Gaughran conjectured.
"He was sick and just went
through the motions in the fi
nals."
Another victim of bad luck
was senior Luis Nicolao, swim
ming for his native Argentina.
After Nicolao finished seventh
in the 100 freestyle, clocking
53.9, he qualified for the semi
finals in the 100 butterfly, his
best event.
But when the semi-final race
began, Nicolao was nowhere in
sight—he'd gotten caught in a
marathon race and was unable
to reach the Olympic pool.
"It must have been a tremen
dous blow to Luey," Gaughran
said sadly. "He's held the world
record in that event, and had a
good chance to win it. He's been
living for that race."

TRACK
Bill Toomey, a Stanford stu

1962-63, won the doeatholon, giv

Toomey, a native of Palo Alio,
won the 10-event, 2-day endur
ance test with an incredible
blend of speed, strength and
stamina. An exhausted, but ju
bilant Toomey won the doeath
olon with a record-setting 8193
points.
Senior Peter Boyce, compet

Sprinter Larry Questad failed
to qualify for the finals in the
200 meter dash, but ran a leg on
the 400 meter tandem in the
semi-finals.
WATER POLO
'68 graduate Gary Sheerer,
perhaps the world's greatest
water polo player, sparked the
American team to two victories
and a 6-6 tie with Cuba before
suffering a shoulder separation.
Another '68 grad, defensive spe

starting berth on the U.S. squad
and played very well.
Without Sheerer, their lead

to be content with a fifth place
in the Olympics.
ROWING
Larry Hough, a Stanford grad
uate currently in the Navy,
teamed with Tony Johnson to
win a silver medal in the pairs
without coxswain event. Hough
and Johnson lost only their sec
ond race in two years, but
nearly caught the winning tan
dem of Jorg Lucke and Heittz-
Jurgen Bothe of Germany. The
Germans were timed in 7:26.56,
while Hought and Johnson
clocked 7:26.71 in the slight
wind.
The 19th edition of the Olym
pic games concluded a few days
ago in Mexico, with American
athletes taking home an amaz
ing 106 medals. Stanford ath
letes made a substantial contri
bution to the American effort,
winning seven medals and play
ing a part in the garnering of
three others.
The following is a sport-by
sport breakdown of Stanford
athletes' performances in the
1968 Olympiad.
SWIMMING
Stanford swimmers Brent
Berk, Greg Buckingham, John
Ferris, Mitch Ivey, Luis Nicolao
and Mike Wall competed in the
Olympics this year, and all six
swam excellently. Buckingham,
Ferris and Ivey took home med
als, Wall contributed to two
American golds in relay events,
while Berk and Nicolao were
victimized by fite in their quest
for Olympic medals.
Buckingham, one of Stanford's
most valuable swimmers on the
1967 NCAA championship team,
finished a close second to In
diana's Charlie Hickok in the
200 Individual Medley, then cor
raled a fourth in the 400 IM,
winding up three seconds back
of Hickok's winning time of
4:48.1 in that one.
Ferris was right behind Buck
ingham in the 200 IM for his
first bronze medal. The Indian
sophomore, bothered like so
many other athletes by the high
altitude, fainted on the victory
stand. But Ferris came back a
few days later to claim another
third in the 200 butterfly with
an eqcellent time of 2:09.3.
Stanford swimming coach Jim
Gaughran felt Ferris may have
been able to win the race had
tie been assigned a lane next to
Pennsylvania's Carl Robie (the
eventual winner) rather than
next to Santa Clara's great
Mark Spitz, who finished a sur
prising last.

"John might have won if he'd
been put next to Robie," Gaugh
ran expalined. "Instead, he was
over next to Spitz, and figured
all he'd have to do was stay
even with him. But Spitz did
nothing."
Another Stanford sophomore,

WATER POLO
'68 graduate Gary Sheerer,
perhaps the world's greatest
water polo player, sparked the
American team to two victories
and a 6-6 tie with Cuba before
suffering a shoulder separation.
Another '68 grad, defensive spe
cialist John Parker, earned a
starting berth on the U.S. squad
and played very well.
Without Sheerer, their lead
ing scorer, the Americans had
to be content with a fifth place
in the Olympics.
ROWING
Larry Hough, a Stanford grad
uate currently in the Navy,
teamed with Tony Johnson to
win a silver medal in the pairs
without coxswain event. Hough
and Johnson lost only their sec
ond race in two years, but
nearly caught the winning tan
dem of Jorg Lucke and Heittz-
Jurgen Bothe of Germany. The
Germans were timed in 7:26.56,
while Hought and Johnson
clocked 7:26.71 in the slight
wind.
The 19th edition of the Olym
pic games concluded a few days
ago in Mexico, with American
athletes taking home an amaz
ing 106 medals. Stanford ath
letes made a substantial contri
bution to the American effort,
winning seven medals and play
ing a part in the garnering of
three others.
The following is a sport-by
sport breakdown of Stanford
athletes' performances in the
1968 Olympiad.
SWIMMING
Stanford swimmers Brent
Berk, Greg Buckingham, John
Ferris, Mitch Ivey, Luis Nicolao
and Mike Wall competed in the
Olympics this year, and all six
swam excellently. Buckingham,
Ferris and Ivey took home med
als, Wall contributed to two
American golds in relay events,
while Berk and Nicolao were
victimized by fite in their quest
for Olympic medals.
Buckingham, one of Stanford's
most valuable swimmers on the
1967 NCAA championship team,
finished a close second to In
diana's Charlie Hickok in the
200 Individual Medley, then cor
raled a fourth in the 400 IM,
winding up three seconds back
of Hickok's winning time of
4:48.1 in that one.
Ferris was right behind Buck
ingham in the 200 IM for his
first bronze medal. The Indian
sophomore, bothered like so
many other athletes by the high
altitude, fainted on the victory
stand. But Ferris came back a
few days later to claim another
third in the 200 butterfly with
an eqcellent time of 2:09.3.
Stanford swimming coach Jim
Gaughran felt Ferris may have
been able to win the race had
tie been assigned a lane next to
Pennsylvania's Carl Robie (the
eventual winner) rather than
next to Santa Clara's great
Mark Spitz, who finished a sur
prising last.

"John might have won if he'd
been put next to Robie," Gaugh
ran expalined. "Instead, he was
over next to Spitz, and figured
all he'd have to do was stay
even with him. But Spitz did
nothing."
Another Stanford sophomore,
Mitch Ivey, took home a silver
medal in the 200 backstroke.
Ivey had the fastest qualifying
time, but East Germany's Rolan
Matthes broke an Olympic rec
ord to edge Ivey in the finals.
IMatthes clocked 2:09 flat to
Ivey's 2:10.
'68 graduate Mike Wall made
the Olympic team as an alter
nate in the 800 and 1500 free
style relays, but was given a
chance to swim in the trials in
both events because of his great
performances in practice.
"Mike worked real hard,"
Coach Gaughran remarked. "He
put out a full effort, and got
to swim in the relay trials. It's
a great tribute to him."
Sophomore Brent Berk had
the fifth fastest qualifying time
in the 400 freestyle, 4:20.2, but
was sick the day of the finals
and finished far off the pace.
"The altitude must have gotten
to him," Gaughran conjectured.
"He was sick and just went
through the motions in the fi
nals."
Another victim of bad luck
was senior Luis Nicolao, swim
ming for his native Argentina.
After Nicolao finished seventh
in the 100 freestyle, clocking
53.9, he qualified for the semi
finals in the 100 butterfly, his
best event.
But when the semi-final race
began, Nicolao was nowhere in
sight—he'd gotten caught in a
marathon race and was unable
to reach the Olympic pool.
"It must have been a tremen
dous blow to Luey," Gaughran
said sadly. "He's held the world
record in that event, and had a
good chance to win it. He's been
living for that race."

TRACK
Bill Toomey, a Stanford stu
dent during the school year
1962-63, won the doeatholon, giv
ing him a legitimate claim to be
ing the world's greatest athlete.
Toomey, a native of Palo Alio,
won the 10-event, 2-day endur
ance test with an incredible
blend of speed, strength and
stamina. An exhausted, but ju
bilant Toomey won the doeath
olon with a record-setting 8193
points.
Senior Peter Boyce, compet
ing for his Australian homeland,
was off form and failed to qual
ify for the finals in the high
jump.
Sprinter Larry Questad failed
to qualify for the finals in the
200 meter dash, but ran a leg on
the 400 meter tandem in the
semi-finals.
