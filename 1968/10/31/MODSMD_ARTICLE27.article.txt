# Critics To Discuss Popular Media
## 
### 
Tresidder's critics' lecture se
ries continues this Thursday
night with a panel discussion of
Popular Criticism. Included on
the panel will be John Wasser
man, Rolfe Peterson, and Phil
Elwood. The program, which
will be moderated by Elwood, is
largely unstructured, in the
hope that the audience will feel
free to participate.
Wasserman and Peterson are
among the more colorful figures
in the local media. Wasserman,
who has been writing for the
Chronicle for five years, gave a
refreshing pause to television
viewers when the reviewed the
atre and films on the air during
the newspaper strike. He cur
rently has his own local televi
sion program, "Pow!"
Peterson is presently acting as
satirical news commentator for
television station KGO, where he
also reviews theatre and music,
He reviews movies and books

for various Bay Area periodicals,
and writes a theatre column for
"Bay Guardian" magazine. This
versatile critic was also seen as
daytime movie host on KGO-TV
for four years. He has been an
English professor at Brigham
Young University and University
of Utah.
Phil Elwood is a well-known
jazz critic, now with the San
Francisco Examiner. His work
as head of jazz programing for
KPFA-FM for the last fifteen
years and his cholarly broad

casts out of San Francisco, Los
Angeles and New York have
made him one of the most highly
respected disc jockeys. This past
summer he opened the Summer
Festival series of jazz events
with a lecture entitled "Four
Stages of Jazz: New Orleans to
New Thing."
The program will begin at
8:00 in the Large Lounge. Ad
mission is free. Next week the
Cultural Arts Division will pre
sent the respected art critic Mr.
Alfred Frankenstein.
