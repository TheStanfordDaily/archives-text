Faced by the now nearly pro
hibitive cost of private legal
counsel, indigent and low in
come families often find them
selves functioning without an
adequate knowledge of their
legal rights and responsibilities.
After actually becoming one of
the parties in a legal action,
such people are frequently rep
resented in criminal actions by
the competent but usually young
and badly overworked staff of a
public defender's office or a
court-appointed attorney.
In civil cases a large number
of poor people never gain legal
representation. Others use either
an Office of Economic Oppor
tunities Legal Services attorney
or perhaps private counsel will
ing to serve without fee.
The Legal Aid Society of the
Stanford Law School attempts to
alleviate this inequality while
simultaneously providing im
portant educational and practi
cal experience for participating
students.
Although prohibiteed by Cali
fornia State law from giving
legal advice without having first
passed the State Bar Examina
tion, Legal Aid students readily
refer poor people in need of
help to places where they can
receive free or inexpensive legal
counsel.
Lighten Loads
The Legal Aid Society more
importantly works to relieve the
ever-increasing case loads of
the Office of Economic Oppoi
tunities attorneys and the pub
lic and private, criminal offices
in San Mateo and Santa Clara
Counties that serve those who
cannot afford counsel. Stanford
law students give their time to

these attorneys to aid in factual
investigation, legal research, and
depending on the case and the
attorney, in preparation of briefs
and pleadings.
Another facet of the Legal
Aid Society's approach to help
ing the poor found expression in
a lecture program in Cubberly
High School last year. A'though
the lecture series met with only
moderate success, [* attempted
to give high school students
from minority and economically
deprived families some acquaint
ance with juvenile, drug, and
consumer law.
Speaker's Bureau
It is currently unc ear whether
or not this program will con
tinue, but plans are being formu
lated for the establishment of a
Speaker's Bureau to supply law
students to lecture to various
white middle-class groups on the
legal problems and handicaps
that face ghetto-dwellers and
other low income individuals.
The Legal Aid Society also aids
poverty area residents by giving
technical assistance to minority
businesses.
The educational benefits that
law students derive from par
ticipation in these programs,
particularly when involved with
researching and helping to draft
briefs, were stressed by Society
president Jan Pauw as consti
tuting an important side-effect
of helping the poor achieve some
justice.
Real Learning
Whereas work in the law
school itself consists mainly of
learning how to read appelate 1
opinions, work in the Legal Aid
Socicty gives the students the
opportunity to learn how to be

a lawyer â€” something that can
not be taught in a classroom.
Such practical benefits would
be greatly expandeed, Pauw ex
plained, if the state legislature
passes a Student Practice Sta
tute, a proposal currently being
studied by tho Board of Gover
nors of the California Bar As

sociation. Such a statute would
allow selected students to ap
pear in a representational capac
ity in certain cases, something
which is absolutely prohibited
today.
The Legal Aid Society cur
rently has between 90 and 100
members.
