# Speculation Rises On Bombing Halt
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — A
fresh spurt of mysterious diplo
matic activity triggered specu
'ation Wednesday that President
Johnson was on the brink of de
ciding whether to halt the bomb
ing of North Vietnam.
But there were sharply con
flicting reports from foreign
capitals on whether a major an
nouncement was imminent.
And the White House and
other official sources maintained
an rnusually tight lid of silence.
Observers speculated that the
President probably would want
to have a hand in making any
announcement on the question
of bombing, considered central
to movement in peace talks on
the war.
High Level Talks
Speculation raged through
this capital after a secret meet
ing at the White House Tuesday
between President Johnson and
Gen. Creghton W. Abrams, the
U.S. commander in Vietnam.
Meanwhile, widely varying re
ports elsewhere contributed to
the suspense:
• In Saigon, South Vietnamese
President Nguyen Van Thieu
said Thursday the bombing of
North Vietnam could not be
halted until Hanoi agreed to de
escalate the war and to talk di

rectly with South Vietnam at
the peace table.
Despite Thieu's statement, an
other South Vietnamese leader,
Premier Tran Van Huong, said
the question of a bombing halt
was up to Washington.
No Compromise
Huong's off- the - cuff state
ment and Thieu's continued hard
line could be indications that
Saigori is trying to maintain as
much pressure on Washington
as possible not to compromise
any major points in its original
bomb halt offer.
• But in Tokyo, an official
spokesman for Japanese Prime
Minister Eisaku Sato said he ex
pected the United States to an
nounce suspension of the bomb
ing "within several hours."
• In Bangkok Foreign Minis
ter Thanat Kohman told news
men upon returning from a U.S.
visit that the United States and
North Vietnam had entered "fi
nal stages" of bargaining about
a bombing halt and the start of
full scale peace talks. The main
point still to be settled is reci
procity by Hanoi for an end to
the U.S. air attacks, he said.
• In Paris, U.S. negotiator W.
Averell Harriman and North
Vietnam's Xuan Thuy held their
weekly meeting without visible
progress. However, Cyrus ft.

Vance, No. 2 man in the U.S.
delegation, did not show up for
the session.
Informed sources said Vance
had worked most of the night
at his Paris office and that there
had been several secret U.S.-
North Vietnamese contacts re
cently.
Though neither side would di
rectly confirm persistent re
ports of imminent agreement on
a halt in U.S. bombing of the
North, one allied diplomat, who
requested anonymity, told a
newsman:
"Everything is settled."
• In Saigon, where U.S. Am
bassador Ellsworth G. Bunker
was continuing an unusual se
ries of meetings with President
Thieu, there were unconfirmed
accounts that the two were pre
paring a joint statement in
which South Vietnam would at
least accept a cessation of the
bombing.
• Vice President Hubert H.
Humphrey, campaigning for the
presidency, said in Philadelphia
a "new level of diplomatic ac
tivity" on Vietnam is under way
and"the next move is up to Ha
noi." He said he did not know
whether there might be a new
peace move befor next Tuesday's
election "and I'm not really in
a position to tell you if I knew."
