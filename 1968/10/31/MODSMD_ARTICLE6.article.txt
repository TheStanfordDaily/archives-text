## Agnew Advised To Sue 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Gov.
Spiro T. Agnew's campaign
manager said Wednesday night
he will recommend that the Re
publican vice presidential nomi
nee file suit against the New
York Times for editorials in
which the paper charged Agnew
with conflict of interest.
The Times had been asked
again Wednesday, and again re
fused, to retract its charges
against the Maryland governor,
which have been called libel by
Agnew and by Republican presi
dential candidate Richard M.
Nixon.
In a statement, Agnew's man
ager—and lawyer—George W.
White Jr., said, "I have been
asked whether Gov. Agnew will
file suit. It will be my recom
mendation, in view of the arbi
trary action of the Times, that
suit be instituted."
Earlier, Harding F. Bancroft,
Times executive vice president,
described White as saying at a
meeting that he felt Agnew had
been libeled and the Times had
taken a "dishonest action."
Bancroft said he told White

he disagreed. Bancroft said
White did not threaten to file a
libel suit.
The Times published one edi
torial Saturday, a second Tues
day and a third Wednesday crit
icizing Agnew in connection
with a real estate purchase and
with directorship of a bank
while holding office in Mary
land. The Times said Agnew's
activities presented conflicts of
interest and made him unfit to
be vice president.
In its Wednesday editorial,
the paper said, "The Times un
equivocally rejects the charge of
libel." It said Agnew's denial of
conflict-of-interest charges "un
derscore his inability to per
ceive the ethical judgments de
manded of persons in high posi
tions of public trust."
• Blast At Max's Ad
LOS ANGELES (AP)—Dem
ocratic Senate candidate Alan
Cranston told radio and televi
sion stations Wednesday night
they will be subject to legal ac
tion if they broadcast a new
advertisement by his Republi
can opponent, Max Rafferty.
Cranston issued the statement
to news media after hearing a
Rafferty commercial over a Los
Angeles radio station. The Cran
ston office said the ad declared:
"Do you want Eldridge Cleav
er and his four-letter obscenities
speaking to your children? Alan
Cranston does. Eldridge Cleav
er advocates mass murder of
white people. Eldridge Cleaver
calls policemen pigs. Yet Alan
Cranston admits he would not
have interfered with efforts to
let Eldridge Cleaver teach at

the University of California.
Max Rafferty voted against
Cleaver. Only one U.S. Senate
candidate demands an end to
violence and obscenity on cam
pus—Max Rafferty."
Cranston said the commercial
"is totally false in linking me
with Eldridge Cleaver. I dis
agree with Eldridge Cleaver, and
I would not approve of him as
a lecturer, and I again am be
ing smeared by Max Rafferty."
Rafferty has made Cleaver his
No. 1 target in the campaign's
final days, and has accused
Cranston of being wishy-washy
on the matter.
Cranston has consistently said
as he did in San Diego Wednes
day afternoon, that Cleaver is
the wrong choice to lecture
about black power.
Also in San Diego, Cranston
told university students the Uni
ted States should begin a grad
ual withdrawal of troops from
South Vietnam right now.
Cranston escalated his fre
quent criticism of the South
Vietnamese government. "Our
commitment was never to fight
their war for them. It was not
in our national interest to do so
at the outset. It is not in our na
tional interest to do so now," he
said in direct contradiction of
official policy of the Johnson ad
ministration.
