## Agnew Advised To Sue 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Gov.
Spiro T. Agnew's campaign
manager said Wednesday night
he will recommend that the Re
publican vice presidential nomi
nee file suit against the New
York Times for editorials in
which the paper charged Agnew
with conflict of interest.
The Times had been asked
again Wednesday, and again re
fused, to retract its charges
against the Maryland governor,
which have been called libel by
Agnew and by Republican presi
dential candidate Richard M.
Nixon.
In a statement, Agnew's man
ager—and lawyer—George W.
White Jr., said, "I have been
asked whether Gov. Agnew will
file suit. It will be my recom
mendation, in view of the arbi
trary action of the Times, that
suit be instituted."
Earlier, Harding F. Bancroft,
Times executive vice president,
described White as saying at a
meeting that he felt Agnew had
been libeled and the Times had
taken a "dishonest action."
Bancroft said he told White

he disagreed. Bancroft said
White did not threaten to file a
libel suit.
The Times published one edi
torial Saturday, a second Tues
day and a third Wednesday crit
icizing Agnew in connection
with a real estate purchase and
with directorship of a bank
while holding office in Mary
land. The Times said Agnew's
activities presented conflicts of
interest and made him unfit to
be vice president.
In its Wednesday editorial,
the paper said, "The Times un
equivocally rejects the charge of
libel." It said Agnew's denial of
conflict-of-interest charges "un
derscore his inability to per
ceive the ethical judgments de
manded of persons in high posi
tions of public trust."
• Blast At Max's Ad
LOS ANGELES (AP)—Dem
ocratic Senate candidate Alan
Cranston told radio and televi
sion stations Wednesday night
they will be subject to legal ac
tion if they broadcast a new
advertisement by his Republi
can opponent, Max Rafferty.
Cranston issued the statement
to news media after hearing a
Rafferty commercial over a Los
Angeles radio station. The Cran
ston office said the ad declared:
"Do you want Eldridge Cleav
er and his four-letter obscenities
speaking to your children? Alan
Cranston does. Eldridge Cleav
er advocates mass murder of
white people. Eldridge Cleaver
calls policemen pigs. Yet Alan
Cranston admits he would not
have interfered with efforts to
let Eldridge Cleaver teach at

the University of California.
Max Rafferty voted against
Cleaver. Only one U.S. Senate
candidate demands an end to
violence and obscenity on cam
pus—Max Rafferty."
Cranston said the commercial
"is totally false in linking me
with Eldridge Cleaver. I dis
agree with Eldridge Cleaver, and
I would not approve of him as
a lecturer, and I again am be
ing smeared by Max Rafferty."
Rafferty has made Cleaver his
No. 1 target in the campaign's
final days, and has accused
Cranston of being wishy-washy
on the matter.
Cranston has consistently said
as he did in San Diego Wednes
day afternoon, that Cleaver is
the wrong choice to lecture
about black power.
Also in San Diego, Cranston
told university students the Uni
ted States should begin a grad
ual withdrawal of troops from
South Vietnam right now.
Cranston escalated his fre
quent criticism of the South
Vietnamese government. "Our
commitment was never to fight
their war for them. It was not
in our national interest to do so
at the outset. It is not in our na
tional interest to do so now," he
said in direct contradiction of
official policy of the Johnson ad
ministration.
• Gene Sees HH Rise
LOS ANGELES (AP)— Sen.
Eugene J. McCarthy, D-Minn.,
said Wednesday that Vice Presi
dent Hubert H. Humphrey is
"closing the gap" with Richard
M. Nixon, his Republican presi
dential opponent.
"I think his chances are im
proving a bit," said McCarthy,
who endorsed Humphrey Tues
day.
He refused to assess the im
pact of his endorsement, leav
ing that, as well as speculation
about his own political future,
"to the columnists."

He also declined to make any
predictions about the presiden
tial election.
Asked whether his Humphrey
endorsement was "lukewarm,"
McCarthy said: "It's not a ques
tion of what I think. But I think
Mr. Humphrey feels it was
warm enough."
• The Hump Stumps
NEW YORK (AP)—With time
growing short Hubert H. Hum
phrey campaigned Wednesday
on the sidewalks of New York,
appealing to thousands at a
street corner rally to prod
friends, relatives and neighbors
to the ballot box.
"I need every vote we can
get," the Democratic presiden

tial candidate declared in mak
ing a traditional election year
appearance in Manhattan's gar
ment district before a crowd
that filled about three blocks.
Humphrey recalled that Harry
S. Truman and John F. Kennedy
two other presidential candi
dates waging uphill campaigns
—had appeared "at this same
spot" to seek help and then had
gone on to victory.
"Now," said Humphrey," I ask
for your help as I never asked
for it before."
It was Humphrey's fifth cam
paign visit to New York City
and he returns once more Satur
day.
Humphrey's top political aide,
William Connell, said that Hum
phrey has an excellent chance
of winning without the election
being forccd into the House of
Representatives.
He predicted that Humphrey
—"if the momentum continues"
—had a good chance of carrying
seven of the biggest states, ex
cluding California, which he
termed "wildly unpredictable,"
and Illinois.
However, Connell expressed
belief that the election would be
won or lost in such border
states as Kentucky, Tennessee,
Maryland and such Southern
states as Arkansas, North and
South Carolina, and Virginia.

• Nixon In Minn.
ROCHESTER, Minn. (AP)
Richard M. Nixon journeyed to
Hubert H. Humphrey's Minne
sota Wednesday and called the
Democratic presidential nominee
"a man who has trotted meekly
along behind his master" —Lyn-
don B. Johnson—and cannot
now be expected to lead.
The Republican nominee for
the White House took a calcu
lated campaign detour to put in
an appearance in Humphrey's
home state, and declared that
his rival's "failure to exercise
his intellectual courage has been
his most serious failure."
Nixon flew from Syracuse,
N.Y., to Rochester for an air
port rally which drew a crowd
police estimated at some 7,500.
"The issue has been made by
the other party; they made it
when they nominated the man
they did," the GOP campaigner
said.
"For four years we've had a
doctor in the White House and
he's been giving the country
the wrong prescription . . . What
the American people want is a
new doctor — we're not going to
hire a pharmacist."
"I don't want a government
of yes-men," Nixon said. "The
next administration must be
one in which the virtue of loyal
ty is balanced by the voice of
conscience, in which the duty to
advise the president does not
necessarily mean the obligation
to consent to his ideas."
• Hecklers Everywhere
WHEELING, W. Va. (AP)
Third party candidate George
C. Wallace told a campaign
crowd at Wheeling Wednesday
that the United States will "be
relegated to a second class pow
er" unless law and order are re
stored in the nation.
Wallace swung southward in
to the Appalachian foothills of
West Virginia after a tumultous
reception at Detroit Tuesday
night which began with frenzied
jeers and wound up in a fist
swinging, chair-throwing, free
for-all touched off by the ap
pearance of noisy hecklers.
The former Alabama governor
encountered some hecklers at
Wheeling, as he does now at al
most every appearance; but
many of them stood in silent
protest while holding aloft black
cardboard signs and black
gloved fists in a salute to black
power.
Wheeling is the industrial cen
ter of West Virginia, notable for
its coal fields and steel mills;
and Wallace took the opportuni
ty to appeal once again for la
bor support.
• In Flu A Virus
ATLANTA, Ga. (AP) — The
world may be on the threshold
of an international epidemic of
Hong Kong influenza, the chief
of the U.S. Public Health Ser
vice's Communicable Disease
Center said here Wednesday.
The influenza virus can now
move with the speed of a jet
airliner, said Dr. David J. Sen
cer, adding that the first case of
the disease identified outside of
Asia was found in Atlanta a
few weeks ago.
A traveler came down with the

appealing to thousands at a
street corner rally to prod

to the ballot box.
"I need every vote we can
get," the Democratic presiden

tial candidate declared in mak
ing a traditional election year
appearance in Manhattan's gar

that filled about three blocks.
Humphrey recalled that Harry
S. Truman and John F. Kennedy
two other presidential candi
dates waging uphill campaigns
—had appeared "at this same

gone on to victory.
"Now," said Humphrey," I ask

It was Humphrey's fifth cam

and he returns once more Satur
day.
Humphrey's top political aide,
William Connell, said that Hum
phrey has an excellent chance
of winning without the election

He predicted that Humphrey
—"if the momentum continues"
—had a good chance of carrying
seven of the biggest states, ex
cluding California, which he
termed "wildly unpredictable,"
and Illinois.
However, Connell expressed
belief that the election would be
won or lost in such border

Maryland and such Southern

South Carolina, and Virginia.

• Nixon In Minn.
ROCHESTER, Minn. (AP)
Richard M. Nixon journeyed to
Hubert H. Humphrey's Minne

Democratic presidential nominee
"a man who has trotted meekly
along behind his master" —Lyn-
don B. Johnson—and cannot
now be expected to lead.
The Republican nominee for
the White House took a calcu
lated campaign detour to put in
an appearance in Humphrey's
home state, and declared that
his rival's "failure to exercise
his intellectual courage has been
his most serious failure."
Nixon flew from Syracuse,
N.Y., to Rochester for an air
port rally which drew a crowd
police estimated at some 7,500.
"The issue has been made by
the other party; they made it
when they nominated the man
they did," the GOP campaigner
said.
"For four years we've had a
doctor in the White House and
he's been giving the country
the wrong prescription . . . What
the American people want is a

"I don't want a government
of yes-men," Nixon said. "The

that the United States will "be
relegated to a second class pow

ATLANTA, Ga. (AP) — The
world may be on the threshold
of an international epidemic of
Hong Kong influenza, the chief
of the U.S. Public Health Ser

Center said here Wednesday.
The influenza virus can now
move with the speed of a jet
airliner, said Dr. David J. Sen
cer, adding that the first case of
the disease identified outside of
Asia was found in Atlanta a
few weeks ago.
A traveler came down with the
disease just three days after a
visit to Hong Kong, Dr. Sencer
said.
NEW YORK (AP) — Gov.
Spiro T. Agnew's campaign
manager said Wednesday night
he will recommend that the Re
publican vice presidential nomi
nee file suit against the New
York Times for editorials in
which the paper charged Agnew
with conflict of interest.
The Times had been asked
again Wednesday, and again re
fused, to retract its charges
against the Maryland governor,
which have been called libel by
Agnew and by Republican presi
dential candidate Richard M.
Nixon.
In a statement, Agnew's man
ager—and lawyer—George W.
White Jr., said, "I have been
asked whether Gov. Agnew will
file suit. It will be my recom
mendation, in view of the arbi
trary action of the Times, that
suit be instituted."
Earlier, Harding F. Bancroft,
Times executive vice president,
described White as saying at a
meeting that he felt Agnew had
been libeled and the Times had
taken a "dishonest action."
Bancroft said he told White

he disagreed. Bancroft said
White did not threaten to file a
libel suit.
The Times published one edi
torial Saturday, a second Tues
day and a third Wednesday crit
icizing Agnew in connection
with a real estate purchase and
with directorship of a bank
while holding office in Mary
land. The Times said Agnew's
activities presented conflicts of
interest and made him unfit to
be vice president.
In its Wednesday editorial,
the paper said, "The Times un
equivocally rejects the charge of
libel." It said Agnew's denial of
conflict-of-interest charges "un
derscore his inability to per
ceive the ethical judgments de
manded of persons in high posi
tions of public trust."
• Blast At Max's Ad
LOS ANGELES (AP)—Dem
ocratic Senate candidate Alan
Cranston told radio and televi
sion stations Wednesday night
they will be subject to legal ac
tion if they broadcast a new
advertisement by his Republi
can opponent, Max Rafferty.
Cranston issued the statement
to news media after hearing a
Rafferty commercial over a Los
Angeles radio station. The Cran
ston office said the ad declared:
"Do you want Eldridge Cleav
er and his four-letter obscenities
speaking to your children? Alan
Cranston does. Eldridge Cleav
er advocates mass murder of
white people. Eldridge Cleaver
calls policemen pigs. Yet Alan
Cranston admits he would not
have interfered with efforts to
let Eldridge Cleaver teach at

the University of California.
Max Rafferty voted against
Cleaver. Only one U.S. Senate
candidate demands an end to
violence and obscenity on cam
pus—Max Rafferty."
Cranston said the commercial
"is totally false in linking me
with Eldridge Cleaver. I dis
agree with Eldridge Cleaver, and
I would not approve of him as
a lecturer, and I again am be
ing smeared by Max Rafferty."
Rafferty has made Cleaver his
No. 1 target in the campaign's
final days, and has accused
Cranston of being wishy-washy
on the matter.
Cranston has consistently said
as he did in San Diego Wednes
day afternoon, that Cleaver is
the wrong choice to lecture
about black power.
Also in San Diego, Cranston
told university students the Uni
ted States should begin a grad
ual withdrawal of troops from
South Vietnam right now.
Cranston escalated his fre
quent criticism of the South
Vietnamese government. "Our
commitment was never to fight
their war for them. It was not
in our national interest to do so
at the outset. It is not in our na
tional interest to do so now," he
said in direct contradiction of
official policy of the Johnson ad

again Wednesday, and again re
fused, to retract its charges
against the Maryland governor,
which have been called libel by
Agnew and by Republican presi
dential candidate Richard M.
Nixon.
In a statement, Agnew's man
ager—and lawyer—George W.
White Jr., said, "I have been
asked whether Gov. Agnew will
file suit. It will be my recom
mendation, in view of the arbi
trary action of the Times, that
suit be instituted."
Earlier, Harding F. Bancroft,
Times executive vice president,
described White as saying at a
meeting that he felt Agnew had
been libeled and the Times had
taken a "dishonest action."
Bancroft said he told White

he disagreed. Bancroft said
White did not threaten to file a
libel suit.
The Times published one edi
torial Saturday, a second Tues
day and a third Wednesday crit
icizing Agnew in connection
with a real estate purchase and
with directorship of a bank
while holding office in Mary
land. The Times said Agnew's
activities presented conflicts of
interest and made him unfit to
be vice president.
In its Wednesday editorial,
the paper said, "The Times un
equivocally rejects the charge of
libel." It said Agnew's denial of
conflict-of-interest charges "un
derscore his inability to per
ceive the ethical judgments de
manded of persons in high posi
tions of public trust."
• Blast At Max's Ad
LOS ANGELES (AP)—Dem
ocratic Senate candidate Alan
Cranston told radio and televi
sion stations Wednesday night
they will be subject to legal ac
tion if they broadcast a new
advertisement by his Republi
can opponent, Max Rafferty.
Cranston issued the statement
to news media after hearing a
Rafferty commercial over a Los
Angeles radio station. The Cran
ston office said the ad declared:
"Do you want Eldridge Cleav
er and his four-letter obscenities
speaking to your children? Alan
Cranston does. Eldridge Cleav
er advocates mass murder of
white people. Eldridge Cleaver
calls policemen pigs. Yet Alan
Cranston admits he would not
have interfered with efforts to
let Eldridge Cleaver teach at

the University of California.
Max Rafferty voted against
Cleaver. Only one U.S. Senate
candidate demands an end to
violence and obscenity on cam
pus—Max Rafferty."
Cranston said the commercial
"is totally false in linking me
with Eldridge Cleaver. I dis
agree with Eldridge Cleaver, and
I would not approve of him as
a lecturer, and I again am be
ing smeared by Max Rafferty."
Rafferty has made Cleaver his
No. 1 target in the campaign's
final days, and has accused
Cranston of being wishy-washy
on the matter.
Cranston has consistently said
as he did in San Diego Wednes
day afternoon, that Cleaver is
the wrong choice to lecture
about black power.
Also in San Diego, Cranston
told university students the Uni
ted States should begin a grad
ual withdrawal of troops from
South Vietnam right now.
Cranston escalated his fre
quent criticism of the South
Vietnamese government. "Our
commitment was never to fight
their war for them. It was not
in our national interest to do so
at the outset. It is not in our na
tional interest to do so now," he
said in direct contradiction of
official policy of the Johnson ad

LOS ANGELES (AP)— Sen.

"I think his chances are im

• The Hump Stumps
NEW YORK (AP)—With time
growing short Hubert H. Hum
phrey campaigned Wednesday
on the sidewalks of New York,
appealing to thousands at a
street corner rally to prod
friends, relatives and neighbors
to the ballot box.
"I need every vote we can
get," the Democratic presiden

tial candidate declared in mak
ing a traditional election year
appearance in Manhattan's gar

that filled about three blocks.
Humphrey recalled that Harry
S. Truman and John F. Kennedy
two other presidential candi
dates waging uphill campaigns
—had appeared "at this same
spot" to seek help and then had
gone on to victory.
"Now," said Humphrey," I ask
for your help as I never asked
for it before."
It was Humphrey's fifth cam
paign visit to New York City
and he returns once more Satur
day.
Humphrey's top political aide,
William Connell, said that Hum
phrey has an excellent chance
of winning without the election
being forccd into the House of
Representatives.
He predicted that Humphrey
—"if the momentum continues"
—had a good chance of carrying
seven of the biggest states, ex
cluding California, which he
termed "wildly unpredictable,"
and Illinois.
However, Connell expressed
belief that the election would be
won or lost in such border

Maryland and such Southern

South Carolina, and Virginia.

• Nixon In Minn.
ROCHESTER, Minn. (AP)
Richard M. Nixon journeyed to
Hubert H. Humphrey's Minne

Democratic presidential nominee
"a man who has trotted meekly
along behind his master" —Lyn-
don B. Johnson—and cannot
now be expected to lead.
The Republican nominee for
the White House took a calcu
lated campaign detour to put in
an appearance in Humphrey's
home state, and declared that
his rival's "failure to exercise
his intellectual courage has been
his most serious failure."
Nixon flew from Syracuse,
N.Y., to Rochester for an air
port rally which drew a crowd
police estimated at some 7,500.
"The issue has been made by
the other party; they made it
when they nominated the man
they did," the GOP campaigner
said.
"For four years we've had a
doctor in the White House and
he's been giving the country
the wrong prescription . . . What
the American people want is a
new doctor — we're not going to
hire a pharmacist."
"I don't want a government
of yes-men," Nixon said. "The
next administration must be
one in which the virtue of loyal
ty is balanced by the voice of
conscience, in which the duty to
advise the president does not
necessarily mean the obligation
to consent to his ideas."

Third party candidate George

that the United States will "be

Wallace swung southward in

West Virginia after a tumultous
reception at Detroit Tuesday
night which began with frenzied

The former Alabama governor
encountered some hecklers at
Wheeling, as he does now at al

many of them stood in silent

Wheeling is the industrial cen

• Nixon In Minn.
ROCHESTER, Minn. (AP)
Richard M. Nixon journeyed to
Hubert H. Humphrey's Minne

Democratic presidential nominee
"a man who has trotted meekly
along behind his master" —Lyn-
don B. Johnson—and cannot
now be expected to lead.
The Republican nominee for
the White House took a calcu

an appearance in Humphrey's
home state, and declared that
his rival's "failure to exercise
his intellectual courage has been
his most serious failure."
Nixon flew from Syracuse,
N.Y., to Rochester for an air
port rally which drew a crowd
police estimated at some 7,500.
"The issue has been made by
the other party; they made it
when they nominated the man
they did," the GOP campaigner
said.
"For four years we've had a
doctor in the White House and
he's been giving the country
the wrong prescription . . . What
the American people want is a

"I don't want a government

ATLANTA, Ga. (AP) — The
world may be on the threshold
of an international epidemic of
Hong Kong influenza, the chief
of the U.S. Public Health Ser

Center said here Wednesday.
The influenza virus can now
move with the speed of a jet
airliner, said Dr. David J. Sen

the disease identified outside of
Asia was found in Atlanta a
few weeks ago.
A traveler came down with the
disease just three days after a
visit to Hong Kong, Dr. Sencer
said.
NEW YORK (AP) — Gov.
Spiro T. Agnew's campaign
manager said Wednesday night
he will recommend that the Re
publican vice presidential nomi
nee file suit against the New
York Times for editorials in
which the paper charged Agnew
with conflict of interest.
The Times had been asked
again Wednesday, and again re
fused, to retract its charges
against the Maryland governor,
which have been called libel by
Agnew and by Republican presi
dential candidate Richard M.
Nixon.
In a statement, Agnew's man
ager—and lawyer—George W.
White Jr., said, "I have been
asked whether Gov. Agnew will
file suit. It will be my recom
mendation, in view of the arbi
trary action of the Times, that
suit be instituted."
Earlier, Harding F. Bancroft,
Times executive vice president,
described White as saying at a
meeting that he felt Agnew had
been libeled and the Times had
taken a "dishonest action."
Bancroft said he told White

he disagreed. Bancroft said
White did not threaten to file a
libel suit.
The Times published one edi
torial Saturday, a second Tues
day and a third Wednesday crit
icizing Agnew in connection
with a real estate purchase and
with directorship of a bank
while holding office in Mary
land. The Times said Agnew's
activities presented conflicts of
interest and made him unfit to
be vice president.
In its Wednesday editorial,
the paper said, "The Times un
equivocally rejects the charge of
libel." It said Agnew's denial of
conflict-of-interest charges "un
derscore his inability to per
ceive the ethical judgments de
manded of persons in high posi
tions of public trust."
• Blast At Max's Ad
LOS ANGELES (AP)—Dem
ocratic Senate candidate Alan
Cranston told radio and televi
sion stations Wednesday night
they will be subject to legal ac
tion if they broadcast a new
advertisement by his Republi
can opponent, Max Rafferty.
Cranston issued the statement
to news media after hearing a
Rafferty commercial over a Los
Angeles radio station. The Cran
ston office said the ad declared:
"Do you want Eldridge Cleav
er and his four-letter obscenities
speaking to your children? Alan
Cranston does. Eldridge Cleav
er advocates mass murder of
white people. Eldridge Cleaver
calls policemen pigs. Yet Alan
Cranston admits he would not
have interfered with efforts to
let Eldridge Cleaver teach at

the University of California.
Max Rafferty voted against
Cleaver. Only one U.S. Senate
candidate demands an end to
violence and obscenity on cam
pus—Max Rafferty."
Cranston said the commercial
"is totally false in linking me
with Eldridge Cleaver. I dis
agree with Eldridge Cleaver, and
I would not approve of him as
a lecturer, and I again am be
ing smeared by Max Rafferty."
Rafferty has made Cleaver his
No. 1 target in the campaign's
final days, and has accused
Cranston of being wishy-washy
on the matter.
Cranston has consistently said
as he did in San Diego Wednes
day afternoon, that Cleaver is
the wrong choice to lecture
about black power.
Also in San Diego, Cranston
told university students the Uni
ted States should begin a grad
ual withdrawal of troops from
South Vietnam right now.
Cranston escalated his fre
quent criticism of the South
Vietnamese government. "Our
commitment was never to fight
their war for them. It was not
in our national interest to do so
at the outset. It is not in our na
tional interest to do so now," he
said in direct contradiction of
official policy of the Johnson ad

asked whether Gov. Agnew will
file suit. It will be my recom
mendation, in view of the arbi
trary action of the Times, that
suit be instituted."
Earlier, Harding F. Bancroft,
Times executive vice president,
described White as saying at a
meeting that he felt Agnew had
been libeled and the Times had
taken a "dishonest action."
Bancroft said he told White

he disagreed. Bancroft said
White did not threaten to file a
libel suit.
The Times published one edi
torial Saturday, a second Tues
day and a third Wednesday crit
icizing Agnew in connection
with a real estate purchase and
with directorship of a bank
while holding office in Mary
land. The Times said Agnew's
activities presented conflicts of
interest and made him unfit to
be vice president.
In its Wednesday editorial,
the paper said, "The Times un
equivocally rejects the charge of
libel." It said Agnew's denial of
conflict-of-interest charges "un
derscore his inability to per
ceive the ethical judgments de
manded of persons in high posi
tions of public trust."
• Blast At Max's Ad
LOS ANGELES (AP)—Dem
ocratic Senate candidate Alan
Cranston told radio and televi
sion stations Wednesday night
they will be subject to legal ac
tion if they broadcast a new
advertisement by his Republi
can opponent, Max Rafferty.
Cranston issued the statement
to news media after hearing a
Rafferty commercial over a Los
Angeles radio station. The Cran
ston office said the ad declared:
"Do you want Eldridge Cleav
er and his four-letter obscenities
speaking to your children? Alan
Cranston does. Eldridge Cleav
er advocates mass murder of
white people. Eldridge Cleaver
calls policemen pigs. Yet Alan
Cranston admits he would not
have interfered with efforts to
let Eldridge Cleaver teach at

the University of California.
Max Rafferty voted against
Cleaver. Only one U.S. Senate
candidate demands an end to
violence and obscenity on cam
pus—Max Rafferty."
Cranston said the commercial
"is totally false in linking me
with Eldridge Cleaver. I dis
agree with Eldridge Cleaver, and
I would not approve of him as
a lecturer, and I again am be
ing smeared by Max Rafferty."
Rafferty has made Cleaver his
No. 1 target in the campaign's
final days, and has accused
Cranston of being wishy-washy
on the matter.
Cranston has consistently said
as he did in San Diego Wednes
day afternoon, that Cleaver is
the wrong choice to lecture
about black power.
Also in San Diego, Cranston
told university students the Uni
ted States should begin a grad
ual withdrawal of troops from
South Vietnam right now.
Cranston escalated his fre
quent criticism of the South
Vietnamese government. "Our
commitment was never to fight
their war for them. It was not
in our national interest to do so
at the outset. It is not in our na
tional interest to do so now," he
said in direct contradiction of
official policy of the Johnson ad
ministration.
• Gene Sees HH Rise
LOS ANGELES (AP)— Sen.
Eugene J. McCarthy, D-Minn.,
said Wednesday that Vice Presi
dent Hubert H. Humphrey is
"closing the gap" with Richard
M. Nixon, his Republican presi
dential opponent.
"I think his chances are im
proving a bit," said McCarthy,
who endorsed Humphrey Tues
day.
He refused to assess the im
pact of his endorsement, leav
ing that, as well as speculation
about his own political future,
"to the columnists."

He also declined to make any
predictions about the presiden
tial election.
Asked whether his Humphrey
endorsement was "lukewarm,"
McCarthy said: "It's not a ques
tion of what I think. But I think
Mr. Humphrey feels it was
warm enough."
• The Hump Stumps
NEW YORK (AP)—With time
growing short Hubert H. Hum
phrey campaigned Wednesday
on the sidewalks of New York,
appealing to thousands at a
street corner rally to prod
friends, relatives and neighbors
to the ballot box.
"I need every vote we can
get," the Democratic presiden

tial candidate declared in mak
ing a traditional election year
appearance in Manhattan's gar
ment district before a crowd
that filled about three blocks.
Humphrey recalled that Harry
S. Truman and John F. Kennedy
two other presidential candi
dates waging uphill campaigns
—had appeared "at this same
spot" to seek help and then had
gone on to victory.
"Now," said Humphrey," I ask
for your help as I never asked
for it before."
It was Humphrey's fifth cam
paign visit to New York City
and he returns once more Satur
day.
Humphrey's top political aide,
William Connell, said that Hum
phrey has an excellent chance
of winning without the election
being forccd into the House of
Representatives.
He predicted that Humphrey
—"if the momentum continues"
—had a good chance of carrying
seven of the biggest states, ex
cluding California, which he
termed "wildly unpredictable,"
and Illinois.
However, Connell expressed
belief that the election would be
won or lost in such border
states as Kentucky, Tennessee,
Maryland and such Southern
states as Arkansas, North and
South Carolina, and Virginia.

• Nixon In Minn.
ROCHESTER, Minn. (AP)
Richard M. Nixon journeyed to
Hubert H. Humphrey's Minne
sota Wednesday and called the
Democratic presidential nominee
"a man who has trotted meekly
along behind his master" —Lyn-
don B. Johnson—and cannot
now be expected to lead.
The Republican nominee for
the White House took a calcu
lated campaign detour to put in
an appearance in Humphrey's
home state, and declared that
his rival's "failure to exercise
his intellectual courage has been
his most serious failure."
Nixon flew from Syracuse,
N.Y., to Rochester for an air
port rally which drew a crowd
police estimated at some 7,500.
"The issue has been made by
the other party; they made it
when they nominated the man
they did," the GOP campaigner
said.
"For four years we've had a
doctor in the White House and
he's been giving the country
the wrong prescription . . . What
the American people want is a
new doctor — we're not going to
hire a pharmacist."
"I don't want a government
of yes-men," Nixon said. "The
next administration must be
one in which the virtue of loyal
ty is balanced by the voice of
conscience, in which the duty to
advise the president does not
necessarily mean the obligation
to consent to his ideas."
• Hecklers Everywhere
WHEELING, W. Va. (AP)
Third party candidate George
C. Wallace told a campaign
crowd at Wheeling Wednesday
that the United States will "be
relegated to a second class pow
er" unless law and order are re
stored in the nation.
Wallace swung southward in
to the Appalachian foothills of
West Virginia after a tumultous
reception at Detroit Tuesday
night which began with frenzied
jeers and wound up in a fist
swinging, chair-throwing, free
for-all touched off by the ap
pearance of noisy hecklers.
The former Alabama governor
encountered some hecklers at
Wheeling, as he does now at al
most every appearance; but
many of them stood in silent
protest while holding aloft black
cardboard signs and black
gloved fists in a salute to black
power.
Wheeling is the industrial cen
ter of West Virginia, notable for
its coal fields and steel mills;
and Wallace took the opportuni
ty to appeal once again for la
bor support.
• In Flu A Virus
ATLANTA, Ga. (AP) — The
world may be on the threshold
of an international epidemic of
Hong Kong influenza, the chief
of the U.S. Public Health Ser
vice's Communicable Disease
Center said here Wednesday.
The influenza virus can now
move with the speed of a jet
airliner, said Dr. David J. Sen
cer, adding that the first case of
the disease identified outside of
Asia was found in Atlanta a
few weeks ago.
A traveler came down with the
disease just three days after a
visit to Hong Kong, Dr. Sencer
said.
