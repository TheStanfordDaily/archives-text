# Police To Protect
## Chief Seeks New Image 
### GREG WHITE 
Stanford's new police chief,
Tom Bell Jr., believes that the
hardest part of his job is keep
ing police actions "total'y un
biased". Replacing Gordon Da
vis, who retired after serving as
chief for the past thirty-seven
years, Bell stated that he would
rather "work with" students,
"not against them."
Protection
Bell emphasizes that the po
liceman's major job is the pro
tection of life and property. He
thinks it's unfortuante that a
traffic ticket is often the only
link between Stanford students
and their police.
In fact, although 22,000 such
tickets are given yearly, the big
gest "crime" problem on campus
is burglary and petty theft,
ranging from loss of bicycles to
dorm furniture. However, Chief
Bell attributes most of this to
"borrowing" or to off campus
theives.
The new chief suggests, "Stu

dent assistants are needed in
dorms to secure the doors at
night and to question unfamiliar
people—those disappearing with
furniture."
Bell himself has a long rec
ord of police work. A former
Stanford student and Korean
War veteran, he never dreamed
of a police career until a neigh
bor suggested he take the Oak
land force's test. He served with
them for ten years, rising to the
rank of sergeant. He was hired
by Stanford in 1963.
Lack of Blacks
He says that at the time of
his service the Oakland force
had some of the "finest leader
ship in the United States" but
that a serious problem was
communication with the resi
dents. The lack of blacks on the
force was due to their "inability
to pass the tests," although Bell
says tests may unconsciously
exclude blacks because of their
design.
His biggest worry about Stan

ford's force is that it is under
mannnd —only 29 officers in all.
Sometimes the department must
call on the Santa Clara Police
Officers Reserve for help—such
as the protection given to Sen.
McCarthy when he was here re
cently. Fortunately, more offi
cers have been authorized. This
and the new police-fire facilities
on East Serra should ease the
situation.
Bell approaches a number of
camnus problems with tact and
flexibility. The department has
no standing "order" dealing
with student demonstrations, but
tries to prevent fights and dam
age to University property. Dur
ing last May's sit-in at the Old
Union, 8 men were stationed to
keep order, sometimes acting as
a buffer between demonstrators
and hostile groups.
Outnumbered
In fact, the police couldn't af
ford to muscle in because they
were outnumbered. As impor
tant, it was their feeling that

"people react the way you treat
them" that prevented any seri
ous trouble.
Bell doesn't think there is any
"crucial" drug problem on cam
pus and says campus police
have no connection with state or
federal narcotics officers. In fact
Bell has at times met with stu
dents and RAs to keep the drug
situation from getting out of
hand. He doesn't want to "build
a big problem out of practically
nothing."
Although the University is of
ficially subject to the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's office, the
Stanford police are allowed a
great deal of flexibility. A 1
though they legally have to re
port major misdemeanors and
felonies to the Sheriff's office, a
good deal of discretion is used
on many minor complaints.
Bell hopes students will feel
free to come in and discuss any
problems with him. He also oc
casionally speaks to living
groups around campus.
