# Have I Ever Lied To You? Healthier Economy

### ART BUCHWALD 
One of the lines that has been
'getting Richard Nixon a big
hand in his campaigning around
f the country is "Rather than
Jmore people on welfare rolls,
!we want more people on pay
rolls."
No one can argue with this
statement —except possibly Nix
ion's economic advisers. While
'the Republican candidate is
more jobs for the
(people, his economic advisers
'keep insisting we're going to
have to have a lot more unem
ployment if we're going to pre
•vent inflation and a recession.

I talked to an independent
economist the other day, Prof.
Ulrich Upgraph, who runs the
nonprofit Economic Health In
stitute:
"Professor, Richard Nixon
says that we have to get people
off the welfare rolls and onto the
payrolls if we want a healthy
economy. How do you feel about
this?"
"Terrible," Prof. Upgraph
said. "Everyone knows that
when you have full employment,
you have inflation, which causes
a recession, which causes more
unemployment in the end."
'Then what you're saying is

you need a healthy unemploy
ment rate to have a healthy
economy."
"Of course. Any fool knows
that. When the unemployment
rate goes below 4%, then the in
flation rate goes up 5%. The
only way to stop the economy
from overheating is to slow it
down, and the best way to slow
an economy down is to have 4 or
5 million people out of work."
"That seems hard to believe."
"Look, stupid, if you have full
employment, then you have a
shortage of labor, and that
means labor demands pay raises.
This causes prices to go up and
naturally causes inflation."
"I know I'm dense about eco
nomic affairs, Professor, but
what I don't understand is how
you can get people off the wel
fare rolls onto the payrolls if
you have to increase the rate of
unemployment."
"You raise a very interesting
question," Upgraph said, "par
ticularly when everyone is so
mad at so many people being
on welfare. The answer is that
you have to find jobs for people
and then lay them ofF so that
you don't have a booming econ
omy running away from itself.
My solution is to change the
name 'welfare' to something
else, like 'economic health insur
ance.' Nobody will get angry if
someone else is collecting eco
nomic health insurance.
"You must think of this in
agricultural terms. We pay
farmers not to grow crops to
keep down the surplus, and no
one is too upset by that. If we
pay people not to work to keep
down inflation, it will be the
same thing."
"That's true," I said. "But
what are the people who aren't
working going to do during the
day with their time?"
"That's not an economist's
problem. The sociologists have
to wrestle with that one. We
only deal in statistics."
"You make a strong case for
unemployment, Professor, and
heaven knows we need some, if
we don't want more unemploy
ment later on. But it seems to
me that the more unemploy
ment you have, the more money
the government will have to
spend to take care of the people.
And the more debt w get into,
the more unhealthy the econ
omy will be."
Prof. Upgraph said angrily,
"Nobody's perfect."
