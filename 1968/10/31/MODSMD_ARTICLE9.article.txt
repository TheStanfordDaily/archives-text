### DICK GREGORY 
Mexico City is increasingly becoming the symbol of the emerging
new spirit which is gaining momentum throughout the world. Stu
dent revolts have far surpassed anythng seen on a campus in this
country and indicate the courageous and determined spirit of Latin
American youth. Recently, victorious American black athletes
shocked a sizeable segment of public opinion in the United States
by raising their hands in the clenched fist salute while accepting
their gold medals at the Olympic Games. As a result they were
expelled from the Games.
Personally, I never have been able to understand why the
clenched fist salute produces white outrage. Black folks learned
the clenched fist salute from white folks. We have been using
baking soda just as much as white folks and we saw the clenched
fist on the box.
Americans were proud to win the gold medals but outraged to see
the clenched fist. Yet the Olympic Games themselves are supposed
to aid the development of a spirit of cooperation and unity in th n
world population. It is entirely consistent with that spirit for black
American athletes to offer a salute which will be immediately
recognized by black people in all other participating countries.
To criticize or penalize black American athletes for recognizing
a common bond of unity is inconsistent with America's supposed
desire for world cooperation.
Not For Politics
The black athletes were expelled because the rules of the Olympic
Games state that they are not supposed to be political. The clenched
fist salute was interpreted as injecting a note of political propa
gandizing into the cooperative spirit of the Games. To be consistent
with that sentiment, both America and Russia should be expelled
from competition. Both countries make political hay of Olympic
Game competition by keeping close score and publicizing their
comparative accomplishments in the national mass media.
But America has always been consistent in displaying inconsisten
cies. Many Americans currently support the candidacy of George
Wallace for President because he has promised to give them "law
and order." Such Wallace supporters do not seem to realize (or
are unwilling to admit) that they are championing the cause of
the same man who stood in the school house door to block law and
order.
Many Americans severely criticize the welfare system in this
country. "Relief" has become a dirty word in America. An atmo
sphere has been created where people are ashamed to be on relief.
If relief embarrasses or shames America, let it be called foreign
aid. America is never embarrassed to send money all over Europe
for health projects and the like, and it is nothing but relief. Those
who criticize welfare do not seem to mind farm subsidies. America's

inconsistency sanctions paying farmers not to plant but resents
providing financial assistance after she plants.
Inability
America's most pronounced inconsistency is illustrated by her
inability to solve basic problems at home while presuming to be
able to solve everyone else's problems abroad.
The inconsistency is magnified by the ludicrous spectacle ol
American troops in Vietnam attempting to force democracy upon
people at gun-point. If America's performance of democracy at
home were consistent with what we say about the democratic way
of life, it would never be necessary to take up arms to enforce it.
People all over the world would be demanding democracy for them
selves.
America's most crucial battle has yet to be waged at home. I
would rather see domestic strife between Americans than to see
Americans engaging in foreign turmoil.
During the Democratic Convention in Chicago thousands of
troops were brought into the city to keep the peace. It is unfortun
ate that there were not 100 more Chicagos occuring simultaneously
throughout the country. Perhaps then it would have been necessary
to bring American troops back from Vietnam to keep the domestic
peace.
Morally Committed
If there had been a really morally committed people's army of
German youth in the 1930'5, creating domestic disorder as American
and Latin American students are doing today, millions of Jews
and other people the world over would have been spared senseless
slaughter. And until America gets her own house in order, she
cannot justify the presumption of dictating solutions to foreign
problems.
We will begin to bring order to every American household
when the capitalistic system is brought into proper perspective in
this country. I do not advocate destroying the capitalistic system,
but I do insist that it be put in its proper place behind the United
States Constitution. Today the Constitution has become the servant
of capitalism rather than the capitalistic system serving the best
interests of all Americans within the framework of the Consti
tution.
The recent inability to produce meaningful gun control legisla
tion was a fine example. The vast majority of the American people
favored a strong gun control. But the firearms industry, a powerful
voice in the capitalistic system said "No" to firm gun control
measures. The bill was defeated, disregarding the will of the people.
When life in America is truly defined and conducted by the Con
stitution of the United States a major step will have been taken to
control the use of all guns, at home and abroad.

Mexico City is increasingly becoming the symbol of the emerging
new spirit which is gaining momentum throughout the world. Stu
dent revolts have far surpassed anythng seen on a campus in this
country and indicate the courageous and determined spirit of Latin
American youth. Recently, victorious American black athletes
shocked a sizeable segment of public opinion in the United States
by raising their hands in the clenched fist salute while accepting
their gold medals at the Olympic Games. As a result they were
expelled from the Games.
Personally, I never have been able to understand why the
clenched fist salute produces white outrage. Black folks learned
the clenched fist salute from white folks. We have been using
baking soda just as much as white folks and we saw the clenched
fist on the box.
Americans were proud to win the gold medals but outraged to see
the clenched fist. Yet the Olympic Games themselves are supposed
to aid the development of a spirit of cooperation and unity in th n
world population. It is entirely consistent with that spirit for black
American athletes to offer a salute which will be immediately
recognized by black people in all other participating countries.
To criticize or penalize black American athletes for recognizing
a common bond of unity is inconsistent with America's supposed
desire for world cooperation.
Not For Politics
The black athletes were expelled because the rules of the Olympic
Games state that they are not supposed to be political. The clenched
fist salute was interpreted as injecting a note of political propa
gandizing into the cooperative spirit of the Games. To be consistent
with that sentiment, both America and Russia should be expelled
from competition. Both countries make political hay of Olympic
Game competition by keeping close score and publicizing their
comparative accomplishments in the national mass media.
But America has always been consistent in displaying inconsisten
cies. Many Americans currently support the candidacy of George
Wallace for President because he has promised to give them "law
and order." Such Wallace supporters do not seem to realize (or
are unwilling to admit) that they are championing the cause of
the same man who stood in the school house door to block law and
order.
Many Americans severely criticize the welfare system in this
country. "Relief" has become a dirty word in America. An atmo
sphere has been created where people are ashamed to be on relief.
If relief embarrasses or shames America, let it be called foreign
aid. America is never embarrassed to send money all over Europe
for health projects and the like, and it is nothing but relief. Those
who criticize welfare do not seem to mind farm subsidies. America's

inconsistency sanctions paying farmers not to plant but resents
providing financial assistance after she plants.
Inability
America's most pronounced inconsistency is illustrated by her
inability to solve basic problems at home while presuming to be
able to solve everyone else's problems abroad.
The inconsistency is magnified by the ludicrous spectacle ol
American troops in Vietnam attempting to force democracy upon
people at gun-point. If America's performance of democracy at
home were consistent with what we say about the democratic way
of life, it would never be necessary to take up arms to enforce it.
People all over the world would be demanding democracy for them
selves.
America's most crucial battle has yet to be waged at home. I
would rather see domestic strife between Americans than to see
Americans engaging in foreign turmoil.
During the Democratic Convention in Chicago thousands of
troops were brought into the city to keep the peace. It is unfortun
ate that there were not 100 more Chicagos occuring simultaneously
throughout the country. Perhaps then it would have been necessary
to bring American troops back from Vietnam to keep the domestic
peace.
Morally Committed
If there had been a really morally committed people's army of
German youth in the 1930'5, creating domestic disorder as American
and Latin American students are doing today, millions of Jews
and other people the world over would have been spared senseless
slaughter. And until America gets her own house in order, she
cannot justify the presumption of dictating solutions to foreign
problems.
We will begin to bring order to every American household
when the capitalistic system is brought into proper perspective in
this country. I do not advocate destroying the capitalistic system,
but I do insist that it be put in its proper place behind the United
States Constitution. Today the Constitution has become the servant
of capitalism rather than the capitalistic system serving the best
interests of all Americans within the framework of the Consti
tution.
The recent inability to produce meaningful gun control legisla
tion was a fine example. The vast majority of the American people
favored a strong gun control. But the firearms industry, a powerful
voice in the capitalistic system said "No" to firm gun control
measures. The bill was defeated, disregarding the will of the people.
When life in America is truly defined and conducted by the Con
stitution of the United States a major step will have been taken to
control the use of all guns, at home and abroad.

control the use of all guns, at home and abroad.
Mexico City is increasingly becoming the symbol of the emerging
new spirit which is gaining momentum throughout the world. Stu
dent revolts have far surpassed anythng seen on a campus in this
country and indicate the courageous and determined spirit of Latin
American youth. Recently, victorious American black athletes
shocked a sizeable segment of public opinion in the United States
by raising their hands in the clenched fist salute while accepting
their gold medals at the Olympic Games. As a result they were
expelled from the Games.
Personally, I never have been able to understand why the
clenched fist salute produces white outrage. Black folks learned
the clenched fist salute from white folks. We have been using
baking soda just as much as white folks and we saw the clenched
fist on the box.
Americans were proud to win the gold medals but outraged to see
the clenched fist. Yet the Olympic Games themselves are supposed
to aid the development of a spirit of cooperation and unity in th n
world population. It is entirely consistent with that spirit for black
American athletes to offer a salute which will be immediately
recognized by black people in all other participating countries.
To criticize or penalize black American athletes for recognizing
a common bond of unity is inconsistent with America's supposed
desire for world cooperation.
Not For Politics
The black athletes were expelled because the rules of the Olympic
Games state that they are not supposed to be political. The clenched
fist salute was interpreted as injecting a note of political propa
gandizing into the cooperative spirit of the Games. To be consistent
with that sentiment, both America and Russia should be expelled
from competition. Both countries make political hay of Olympic
Game competition by keeping close score and publicizing their
comparative accomplishments in the national mass media.
But America has always been consistent in displaying inconsisten
cies. Many Americans currently support the candidacy of George
Wallace for President because he has promised to give them "law
and order." Such Wallace supporters do not seem to realize (or
are unwilling to admit) that they are championing the cause of
the same man who stood in the school house door to block law and
order.
Many Americans severely criticize the welfare system in this
country. "Relief" has become a dirty word in America. An atmo
sphere has been created where people are ashamed to be on relief.
If relief embarrasses or shames America, let it be called foreign
aid. America is never embarrassed to send money all over Europe
for health projects and the like, and it is nothing but relief. Those
who criticize welfare do not seem to mind farm subsidies. America's

inconsistency sanctions paying farmers not to plant but resents
providing financial assistance after she plants.
Inability
America's most pronounced inconsistency is illustrated by her
inability to solve basic problems at home while presuming to be
able to solve everyone else's problems abroad.
The inconsistency is magnified by the ludicrous spectacle ol
American troops in Vietnam attempting to force democracy upon
people at gun-point. If America's performance of democracy at
home were consistent with what we say about the democratic way
of life, it would never be necessary to take up arms to enforce it.
People all over the world would be demanding democracy for them
selves.
America's most crucial battle has yet to be waged at home. I
would rather see domestic strife between Americans than to see
Americans engaging in foreign turmoil.
During the Democratic Convention in Chicago thousands of
troops were brought into the city to keep the peace. It is unfortun
ate that there were not 100 more Chicagos occuring simultaneously
throughout the country. Perhaps then it would have been necessary
to bring American troops back from Vietnam to keep the domestic
peace.
Morally Committed
If there had been a really morally committed people's army of
German youth in the 1930'5, creating domestic disorder as American
and Latin American students are doing today, millions of Jews
and other people the world over would have been spared senseless
slaughter. And until America gets her own house in order, she
cannot justify the presumption of dictating solutions to foreign
problems.
We will begin to bring order to every American household
when the capitalistic system is brought into proper perspective in
this country. I do not advocate destroying the capitalistic system,
but I do insist that it be put in its proper place behind the United
States Constitution. Today the Constitution has become the servant
of capitalism rather than the capitalistic system serving the best
interests of all Americans within the framework of the Consti
tution.
The recent inability to produce meaningful gun control legisla
tion was a fine example. The vast majority of the American people
favored a strong gun control. But the firearms industry, a powerful
voice in the capitalistic system said "No" to firm gun control
measures. The bill was defeated, disregarding the will of the people.
When life in America is truly defined and conducted by the Con
stitution of the United States a major step will have been taken to
control the use of all guns, at home and abroad.
