The interdisciplinary environment at IBM helps
you keep up to date technologically. As Nick
puts it, "You're constantly exposed to what's
happening in other fields."
IBM needs technical graduates to work in
research, design and development, manufactur
ing, product test, field engineering, and space
and defense projects. We also need technical ■ N '
people in programming and marketing.

The interdisciplinary environment at IBM helps
you keep up to date technologically. As Nick
puts it, "You're constantly exposed to what's
happening in other fields."
IBM needs technical graduates to work in
research, design and development, manufactur
