Whats
necessary
about
religion?
Sometimes deeply
thoughtful people ask, "If
God exists, why hasn't He
eliminated war?"
But would one ever
seriously ask, "Why haven't
traffic laws eliminated
accidents?" Could it be that
God does, in fact, provide
peace, order, and protection
... and these come into our
lives as we understand and
obey God's divine laws?
Neil H. Bowles, C.5.8., a
member of The Christian
Science Board of Lectureship,
will discuss the necessity for
religion and its practical
application in our modern age.
Admission to this one-hour
lecture is free and everyone
is welcome.
