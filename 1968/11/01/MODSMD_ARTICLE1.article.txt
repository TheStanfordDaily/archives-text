# Johnson Announces Complete Bomb Halt
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —Pres
ident Johnson announced last
night that a complete halt to
all bombardment of North Viet
nam will begin at 8 a.m. this
morning, Washington time.
The President, addressing the
nation, said he had decided to
take this step- with the concur
rence of his top military advis
ers and the governments of all
the allied powers fighting in
Vietnam —"in the belief that this
action can lead to progress to
ward a peaceful settlement of
the Vietnamese war."
And negotiations on the basis
of it will begin in Paris on Nov.
6, with the government of South
Vietnam repmsented at the con
ference table. The latter was a
key bone of contention.
The National Liberation Front
also will be entitled to sit in on
the new-terms maneuvering for
peace in the long, costly war on
the other side of the world. I he

NLF is the political arm of the
Viet Cong.
Expectations
"What we now expect—what
we have a right to expect—are
prompt, productive, serious and
intensive negotiations in an at
mosphere that is conducive to
progress," Johnson said.
In Paris, a Hanoi delegate to
the long-winded peace talks said
the President's action "removes
a tremendous obstacle to peace
—but now the political struggle
for our country begins."
Richard Nixon, Republican
presidential candidate, said
he trusts that President John
son's orders halting the bomb
ing "may bring some progerss"
in the peace negotiations.
Humphrey Comments
Hubert H. Humphrey, the
Democratic presidential candi
date, said the President has tak
en the decision in the hope that
it will reduce the killing and

that this is going to help the
cause of peace."
Third party candidate George
C. Wallace said "I hope and
pray" the president's action will
bring an early and "honorable
peace in Southeast Asia."
Most observers seemed to
think the bombardment halt—
and any heightened hopes for
peace accompanying it —would
be bound to help Humphrey in
his uphill fight to overtake Nix
on, credited as front runner in
most polls.
Halts Bombardment
The President said that he is
halting all air, naval and artil
lery bombardment of North
Vietnam, under his current de
cision, but officials said this ap
plies to all acts involving use of
force, including trooo activity in
the North. It does exempt, how
ever, unarmed reconnaissance.
The President made it clear
that he considers some risks
still are involved, and said the

North Vietnamese have been
put on notice that any violation
of the U.S. conditions will bring
immediate retaliation.
Hanoi was told pointedly in
advance that any cessation of
bombing in the North —if fol
lowed by abuse of the Demili
tarized Zone, attacks on cities
or provincial capitals, or refusal
by North Vietnam to enter
promptly into serious political
discussions--could not be sus
tained. An a condition also was
laid down that the discussions
would have to include the elect
ed government of South Viet
nam.
Just what the form of repre
sentation of the Viet Cong will
be on Hanoi's side of the bar
gaining table will be is not
clear, except that this govern
ment is not recognizing the NLF
as an equal, participating gov
ernment.

progress," Johnson said.
In Paris, a Hanoi delegate to
the long-winded peace talks said
the President's action "removes
a tremendous obstacle to peace
—but now the political struggle
for our country begins."
Richard Nixon, Republican
presidential candidate, said
he trusts that President John
son's orders halting the bomb
ing "may bring some progerss"
in the peace negotiations.
Humphrey Comments
Hubert H. Humphrey, the
Democratic presidential candi
date, said the President has tak
en the decision in the hope that
it will reduce the killing and

that this is going to help the
cause of peace."
Third party candidate George
C. Wallace said "I hope and
pray" the president's action will
bring an early and "honorable
peace in Southeast Asia."
Most observers seemed to
think the bombardment halt—
and any heightened hopes for
peace accompanying it —would
be bound to help Humphrey in
his uphill fight to overtake Nix
on, credited as front runner in
most polls.
Halts Bombardment
The President said that he is
halting all air, naval and artil
lery bombardment of North
Vietnam, under his current de
cision, but officials said this ap
plies to all acts involving use of
force, including trooo activity in
the North. It does exempt, how
ever, unarmed reconnaissance.
The President made it clear
that he considers some risks
still are involved, and said the

North Vietnamese have been
put on notice that any violation
of the U.S. conditions will bring
immediate retaliation.
Hanoi was told pointedly in
advance that any cessation of
bombing in the North —if fol
lowed by abuse of the Demili
tarized Zone, attacks on cities
or provincial capitals, or refusal
by North Vietnam to enter
promptly into serious political
discussions--could not be sus
tained. An a condition also was
laid down that the discussions
would have to include the elect
ed government of South Viet
nam.
Just what the form of repre
sentation of the Viet Cong will
be on Hanoi's side of the bar
gaining table will be is not
clear, except that this govern
ment is not recognizing the NLF
as an equal, participating gov
ernment.

WASHINGTON (AP) —Pres
ident Johnson announced last
night that a complete halt to
all bombardment of North Viet
nam will begin at 8 a.m. this
morning, Washington time.
The President, addressing the
nation, said he had decided to
take this step- with the concur
rence of his top military advis
ers and the governments of all
the allied powers fighting in
Vietnam —"in the belief that this
action can lead to progress to
ward a peaceful settlement of
the Vietnamese war."
And negotiations on the basis
of it will begin in Paris on Nov.
6, with the government of South
Vietnam repmsented at the con
ference table. The latter was a
key bone of contention.
The National Liberation Front
also will be entitled to sit in on
the new-terms maneuvering for
peace in the long, costly war on
the other side of the world. I he

NLF is the political arm of the
Viet Cong.
Expectations
"What we now expect—what
we have a right to expect—are
prompt, productive, serious and
intensive negotiations in an at
mosphere that is conducive to
progress," Johnson said.
