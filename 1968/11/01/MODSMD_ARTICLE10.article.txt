## Voting Choices 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
Many of us who supported Eu
gene McCarthy have been in tur
moil about how to vote on No
vember 5. I offer the following
theses in the hope of eliciting
further discussion in The Daily
before Election Day.
1. Not to vote at all, out of
anger or disappointment, is irre
sponsible. Congressional nomi
nees such as Alan Cranston need
support. A citizen who by default
helps Max Rafferty is contribut
ing to the downfall of the nation.
2. A write-in vote for McCar
thy (which has been my inclina
tion) can be justified in at least
three ways: (a) It continues to
build momentum for a new style
in politics, (b) It serves notice
on whoever wins that he must
contend not only with the Wal
lace protest vote, but also with a
significant protest vote at the
other end of the spectrum, (c)
Particularly in California, it fur
nishes the start of a new power
base for rebuilding the Demo
cratic party. The cumulative
weight of these three points is
impressive.
3. A write-in vote for McCar
thy can be challenged in at least

three ways: (a) It helps elect
Nixon, (b) It helps elect Nixon,
(c) It helps elect Nixon. The cu
mulative weight of these three
points is impressive.
4. A vote for Humphrey can
not be justified on positive
grounds. His actions at Chicago
and since give no assurance that
he will disassociate himself from
discredited administration poli
cies. The best thing he has going
for him is Richard Nixon. The
next best thing is Spiro T. Ag
new.
5. A vote for Humphrey might
be justified on negative grounds.
To vote for "the least of three
evils" is not a moral cop-out if
it is clear that minority groups
(such as blacks and draftees)
would suffer less under Hum
phrey than under either of his
opponents. Middle-class whites
might survive four years of Nix
on; blacks in the ghettoes might
not. Men of conscience who will
not fight in Vietnam might get
minimally fair treatment from
Humphrey's judicial appointees
(even if not from Humphrey);
they could expect no such treat
ment from Strom Thurmond's
appointees.

6. An ideal solution would be
for Republicans and Democrats
unhappy with their respective
candidates to "pair" their votes
on a write-in for, say, McCarthy
and Lindsay. Any takers?
7. If a Democrat-for-McCarthy
finally votes for Humphrey, he
has an obligation (a) to serve
public notice that he does so in
desperation only because the
electoral process has so badly
failed him, and (b) to begin
working, no later than Novem
ber 6, to create a new national
party machinery that will re
place the discredited politicians
who gave the voters no option
this time but the discredited
Johnson - Humphrey - Vietnam -
Chicago-Daley machine.
