# A 						Conspiracy Of One
## Fear Of Confrontation 
### DANIEL SNELL 
Irving Howe, editor of Dissent,
writes in the New York Times
Magazine for Oct. 20 that "con
frontation politics" is a strategy
which "can lead only to disaster
and a backlash of terrifying pro
portions."
"The signs of it,"he says, "are
everywhere about us."
His message to those upset
with things as they are is to cool
it, to work through channels.
But Mr. Howe does not under
stand the motives that would
prompt me to protest and may
be affecting others across the
nation.
Howe looks around him and
sees George Wallace seriously
running for the Presidency, and
the most popular figures in both
the major political parties pass
ed over in favor of unimagina
tive hacks. He sees injustice in
the cities and senseless pain in
Vietnam; yet he concludes that
the forces for change must work
quietly in order to accomplish
what they can; that they must
conform to the traditional ways
of changing things if they do not
wish to court a surge of fascism
in America.
To Prod and Incite
And he believes that the pur
pose of the confrontation poli
tics he deplores is "to prod and
incite a dormant, insensitive so
ciety into recognizing its moral
failures."
But it seems to me that con
frontation tactics, originated in
America in the hopes of mobiliz
ing public opinion against South

ern race oppression, has become
the means to express the feeling
that chaos of any sort is better
than the society we now have.
Howe still views the tactics of
confrontation as public relations
tools. And for some persons they
may represent ways of influenc
ing the rest of the world toward
constructive change. But for me
they rather are the tactic of des
peration, of the lack of any hope
at all that our society can really
be changed.
Caution or Disgust
The same fascist trends that
instill caution in Mr. Howe in
still disgust in me. And it seems
to me that the only reasonable
response at this time is to try to
bring about the utter destruction
of our society, acting in accor
dance with principles of non
violence that I have made my
own. Others may not be so dedi
cated to the sparing of human
life in this effort, and others
like Howe may point at the

glimmers of excellence that may
in fact still flare forth.
They can point to the good in
tentions of University Acting
President Robert Glaser. But be
hind those intentions I see the
past associations and seeming
lack of flair in President-Desig
nate Kenneth Pitzer.
They can point to the calm ef
forts of Sen. Eugene McCarthy,
who is talking in terms of real
political change in four years.
But Curtis LeMay has said he
wants to regard the hydrogen
bomb as just another weapon
in the arsenal of our nation
state.
War-on-Vietnam
And they can point to the ef
forts of the Urban Coalition to
improve the lot of minority
group members. But the 90th
Congress has quashed much
war-on-poverty legislation to
make way for the war on the
Vietnamese.
Perhaps if I were more ideo-

logically doctrinaire I would be
more optimistic, either as a capi
talist or as a Marxist. But set
ting out on my adult life in this
weird year of 1968 I see very
little reason to be optimistic.
And the progress that may be
coming is too distant for me
not to welcome Eldridge Clea
ver's statement that "We are
living in the time of the last
go-round."
If our civilizationâ€”that mixed
bag of tricks, some clever, some
harmful, some ugly, some beau
tiful cannot live by its avowed
principles of self-determination
and a once - Judeao - Christian
love, then let us begin to find
out what deep modification of
that civilization will bring.
Perhaps there are temporary
measures to be taken, perhaps
Mr. Howe and his friends can
do something to change things.
But fear to resist oppression
will gain us only more repres
sion.
