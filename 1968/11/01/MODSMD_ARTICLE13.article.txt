# ROUCH DRAFT
## 
### BILL LELAND ALAN STRAIN 
Today's column will conclude
the discussion of the provision
in the law for conscientious ob
jection and then begin discus
sion of the procedure for claim
ing CO status.
There is much confusion
about the meaning of the stipu
lation that objection must be to
"participation to war in any
form." It is clear that the law
does not require that an individ
ual be a pacifist to be a con
scientious objector. The objec
tion required is to participation
in war and not in something
else, such as personal self-de
fense, for example. It is also
questionable that this language
means all wars.
Arlo Tatum, national head of
Central Committee for Consci
entious Objectors, notes that "to
obtain recognition as a consci
entious objector, one is not re
quired to say 'I am a conscien
tious objector, and I swear I
would have been, at every point
in human history, had I been of

draft age then instead of now'.
The statement reads: 'I am . . "
It is no longer unknown for Se
lective Service to recognize men
who can make no absolute dis
claimer and even men who argue
openly that they cannot take
part in this war because it does
not meet the requiremetns of a
just war as defined by their re
ligious faith.
Of course no provision can be
made within the draft for the
individual who objects to con
scription itself, nor can any rec
ognition be given the man who
objects to the draft because it is
unjust or inequitable. These in
dividuals face special problems
in responding to the draft.
"The Special Form for Con

scientious Objector" was recent
ly revised to conform with the
1967 Military Service Act. The
registrant is now permitted 30
days in which to complete and
return this form to his local
board.
On Form 150 the registrant is
first asked to sign one of two
claims for exemption from mili
tary duty, depending upon
whether he can accept noncom
batant duty in the armed forces,
or can take no part whatever in
the military. If the first claim is
made and recognized, the man
will be classified I-A-O and will
be inducted for non-combatant
duty when his name comes up
in the order of call. The second
claim, if recognized, will result

in a I-O classification and assign
ment to 2 years of alternative
civilian service when the man's
name reaches the top of the or
der of call.
The major part of Form 150
is devoted to four questions
which inquire into the nature of
the belief which is the basis of
the Conscientious Objector claim,
the source and development of
this belief, the extent to which
this belief restricts the regis
trant from performing noncom
batant duty in the armed forces.
