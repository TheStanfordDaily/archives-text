## Nixon: Gamblers Found In His Past 
### Drew Pearson 
WASHINGTON — Because
Richard Nixon has been harping
so much on crime in the streets,
the question has been asked as
to why he has been seen at Las
Vegas gambling resorts and at
tended the opening of the fam
ous Paradise Island gambling
casino in the Bahamas. Later,
at the Miami convention, Nixon
accepted the use of the yacht
Cosa Grande owned by the
Paradise Island Casino.
Probably Mr. Nixon will call
it "gutter politics," as he ac
cused the New York Times, if
this column investigates the
whys and wherefores of Nixon's
affinitey with gamblers. Never

theless, since the public is very
much concerned over crime in
the streets, it has a right to know
something of Mr. Nixon's rela
tions with the gambling frater
nity before passing on his quali
fications to be President.
There is no evidence that we
can find that Mr. Nixon is a
gambler, but there is definite
evidence that he has consorted
with and defended gamblers and
received political funds from
them. In fact, part of his first
campaign funds was raised from
the underworld in Los Angeles.
When this column reported
the source of these funds, Mur
ray Chotiner, Nixon's first cam

paign manager, threatened a li
bel suit. Chotiner is a criminal
lawyer who has defended many
underworld characters, has been
Nixon's political pilot for years
and is now active in his cam
paign for President.
In view of Chotiner's libel
threat, we secured a statement
from Mickey Cohen, former
king of the Los Angeles gam
bling world, who had raised the
money for Nixon and who was
serving time in Alcatraz when
he furnished the statement. In
view of Mr. Nixon's vigorous
and repeated speeches on crime
in the streets, his affinity with
the underworld is important. It
is published herewith as given
to Richard R. Rogan, former
Deputy Attorney General of
California.
"I am presently serving a sen
tence in the federal prison at
Alcatraz. At my request, I asked
for a meeting with a state law
enforcement officer and on Oct.
9, 1962, Richard R. Rogan met
me in the visitor's room at Alca
traz.
"I informed Mr. Rogan that I
wished to discuss with him a
question concerning the influ
ence of persons engaged in gam
bling and bookmaking on the
early political career of Richard
Nixon.
"I first met Richard Nixon at
a luncheon in the Goodfellow's
Fisherman's Grotto on South

Main Street in 1946. The meet
ing was arranged by Murray
Chotiner, who asked me to meet
Mr. Nixon who was about to
start his first campaign as a
Representative in Congress that
year. I was asked by Nixon and
Chotiner to raise some money
for Nixon's campaign.
"In either 1948 during Nixon's
second race for Congress or
1950 in his campaign for the
Senate, I was again asked by
Murray Chotiner to raise funds
for Nixon's campaign. During
that time I was running most
of the gambling and bookmaking
in Los Angeles County. I re
served the banquet room in the
Hollywood Knickerbocker Hotel
on Ivar Street in Hollywood for
a dinner meeting to which I in
vited approximately 250 persons
who were working with me in
the gambling fraternity. Among
those who were present, whose
names are well known to law
enforcement officers, were Joe
and Fred Sica, Jack Dragna and
George Capri. Also present was
Hy Goldbaum, who is one of the
pit bosses at the Stardust Hotel
in Las Vegas, who also served
a term of imprisonment at the
federal prison at McNeil Island.
Capri was one of the owners of
the Flamingo hotel in Las Veg
as.
"Murray Chotiner told me I
should have a quota of $25,000
for the campaign. During the

course of the evening Nixon
spoke for approximately 10 min
utes; Chotiner spoke about half
an hour.
"At this meeting my group
pledged between $17,00 Oand $19,-
000 but this did not meet the
quota set by Nixon and Choti
ner and the group was informed
they would have to stay until
the quota was met."
Note: That sentence, "the
group was informed (by Nixon
and Chotiner) that they would
have to stay until the quota was
set," is especially important. In
brief, Nixon and Chotiner were
putting the squeeze on the
leading gamblers of Southern
California and telling them to
meet a quota. Obviously the
gamblers had a right to expect
something in return.
"In addition to helping Mr.
Nixon financially," continued
Cohen, "I made arrangements to
rent a headquarters for Nixon
in the Pacific Finance building
at Eight and Olive streets in Los
Angeles, which was the same
building occupied by attorney
Sam Rummel. We posted Nixon
signs and literature, and I paid
for the headquarters for three
or four weeks in that building.
During the period that I ran
this Nixon headquarters, I con
tacted most of the gambling fra
ternity in Los Angeles County
to tell them what their share of
the contribution to the Nixon

campaign would be.
"I have been asked by several
newspaper persons and televi
sion employees of NBC during
the 1956 presidential campaign
to make these facts known,"
continued Mickey Cohen, "but
until now I have refused to do
so.
"In view of the fact that Mr.
Nixon is now making speeches
in his campaign for governor
and stating that organized crime
is active in California and that
Eastern hoodlums were seeking
a foothold in California to orga
nize bookmaking, I have decided
that the people of California
should know the true facts with
Nixon's entry into politics being
based upon money raised by me
and my associates in the gam
bling fraternity who started him
off with $26,000.
"There have been no promises
made to me of any kind or na
ture and the above statement has
been given by me freely and
voluntarily." Signed: "Michael
Cohen."
What the gamblers got in re
turn is spelled out in the records
of the Los Angeles County court
between 1949 and 1952, which
show that Nixon's campaign
manager, Murray Chotiner, and
his brother acted as attorney in
221 bookmaking and underworld
cases. In almost all instances
their clients got off with light
fines or suspended sentences.

WASHINGTON — Because
Richard Nixon has been harping
so much on crime in the streets,
the question has been asked as
to why he has been seen at Las
Vegas gambling resorts and at
tended the opening of the fam
ous Paradise Island gambling
casino in the Bahamas. Later,
at the Miami convention, Nixon
accepted the use of the yacht
Cosa Grande owned by the
Paradise Island Casino.
Probably Mr. Nixon will call
it "gutter politics," as he ac
cused the New York Times, if
this column investigates the
whys and wherefores of Nixon's
affinitey with gamblers. Never

theless, since the public is very
much concerned over crime in
the streets, it has a right to know
something of Mr. Nixon's rela
tions with the gambling frater
nity before passing on his quali
fications to be President.
There is no evidence that we
can find that Mr. Nixon is a
gambler, but there is definite
evidence that he has consorted
with and defended gamblers and
received political funds from
them. In fact, part of his first
campaign funds was raised from
the underworld in Los Angeles.
When this column reported
the source of these funds, Mur
ray Chotiner, Nixon's first cam

paign manager, threatened a li
bel suit. Chotiner is a criminal
lawyer who has defended many
underworld characters, has been
Nixon's political pilot for years
and is now active in his cam
paign for President.
In view of Chotiner's libel
threat, we secured a statement
from Mickey Cohen, former
king of the Los Angeles gam
bling world, who had raised the
money for Nixon and who was
serving time in Alcatraz when
he furnished the statement. In
view of Mr. Nixon's vigorous
and repeated speeches on crime
in the streets, his affinity with
the underworld is important. It
is published herewith as given
to Richard R. Rogan, former
Deputy Attorney General of
California.
"I am presently serving a sen
tence in the federal prison at
Alcatraz. At my request, I asked
for a meeting with a state law
enforcement officer and on Oct.
9, 1962, Richard R. Rogan met
me in the visitor's room at Alca
traz.
"I informed Mr. Rogan that I
wished to discuss with him a
question concerning the influ
ence of persons engaged in gam
bling and bookmaking on the
early political career of Richard
Nixon.
"I first met Richard Nixon at
a luncheon in the Goodfellow's
Fisherman's Grotto on South

Main Street in 1946. The meet
ing was arranged by Murray
Chotiner, who asked me to meet
Mr. Nixon who was about to
start his first campaign as a
Representative in Congress that
year. I was asked by Nixon and
Chotiner to raise some money
for Nixon's campaign.
"In either 1948 during Nixon's
second race for Congress or
1950 in his campaign for the
Senate, I was again asked by
Murray Chotiner to raise funds
for Nixon's campaign. During
that time I was running most
of the gambling and bookmaking
in Los Angeles County. I re
served the banquet room in the
Hollywood Knickerbocker Hotel
on Ivar Street in Hollywood for
a dinner meeting to which I in
vited approximately 250 persons
who were working with me in
the gambling fraternity. Among
those who were present, whose
names are well known to law
enforcement officers, were Joe
and Fred Sica, Jack Dragna and
George Capri. Also present was
Hy Goldbaum, who is one of the
pit bosses at the Stardust Hotel
in Las Vegas, who also served
a term of imprisonment at the
federal prison at McNeil Island.
Capri was one of the owners of
the Flamingo hotel in Las Veg
as.
"Murray Chotiner told me I
should have a quota of $25,000
for the campaign. During the

course of the evening Nixon
spoke for approximately 10 min
utes; Chotiner spoke about half
an hour.
"At this meeting my group
pledged between $17,00 Oand $19,-
000 but this did not meet the
quota set by Nixon and Choti
ner and the group was informed
they would have to stay until
the quota was met."
Note: That sentence, "the
group was informed (by Nixon
and Chotiner) that they would
have to stay until the quota was
set," is especially important. In
brief, Nixon and Chotiner were
putting the squeeze on the
leading gamblers of Southern
California and telling them to
meet a quota. Obviously the
gamblers had a right to expect
something in return.
"In addition to helping Mr.
Nixon financially," continued
Cohen, "I made arrangements to
rent a headquarters for Nixon
in the Pacific Finance building
at Eight and Olive streets in Los
Angeles, which was the same
building occupied by attorney
Sam Rummel. We posted Nixon
signs and literature, and I paid
for the headquarters for three
or four weeks in that building.
During the period that I ran

spoke for approximately 10 min

pledged between $17,00 Oand $19,-

Note: That sentence, "the
group was informed (by Nixon

brief, Nixon and Chotiner were
putting the squeeze on the
leading gamblers of Southern
California and telling them to
meet a quota. Obviously the
gamblers had a right to expect
something in return.

Nixon financially," continued
Cohen, "I made arrangements to

During the period that I ran
this Nixon headquarters, I con
tacted most of the gambling fra

to tell them what their share of
the contribution to the Nixon

campaign would be.
"I have been asked by several
newspaper persons and televi

the 1956 presidential campaign
to make these facts known,"
continued Mickey Cohen, "but

What the gamblers got in re

show that Nixon's campaign
manager, Murray Chotiner, and
his brother acted as attorney in
221 bookmaking and underworld

WASHINGTON — Because
Richard Nixon has been harping
so much on crime in the streets,
the question has been asked as
to why he has been seen at Las
Vegas gambling resorts and at
tended the opening of the fam
ous Paradise Island gambling
casino in the Bahamas. Later,
at the Miami convention, Nixon
accepted the use of the yacht
Cosa Grande owned by the
Paradise Island Casino.
Probably Mr. Nixon will call
it "gutter politics," as he ac
cused the New York Times, if
this column investigates the
whys and wherefores of Nixon's
affinitey with gamblers. Never

theless, since the public is very
much concerned over crime in
the streets, it has a right to know
something of Mr. Nixon's rela
tions with the gambling frater
nity before passing on his quali
fications to be President.
There is no evidence that we
can find that Mr. Nixon is a
gambler, but there is definite
evidence that he has consorted
with and defended gamblers and
received political funds from
them. In fact, part of his first
campaign funds was raised from
the underworld in Los Angeles.
When this column reported
the source of these funds, Mur
ray Chotiner, Nixon's first cam

paign manager, threatened a li
bel suit. Chotiner is a criminal
lawyer who has defended many
underworld characters, has been
Nixon's political pilot for years
and is now active in his cam
paign for President.
In view of Chotiner's libel
threat, we secured a statement
from Mickey Cohen, former
king of the Los Angeles gam
bling world, who had raised the
money for Nixon and who was
serving time in Alcatraz when
he furnished the statement. In
view of Mr. Nixon's vigorous
and repeated speeches on crime
in the streets, his affinity with
the underworld is important. It
is published herewith as given
to Richard R. Rogan, former
Deputy Attorney General of
California.
"I am presently serving a sen
tence in the federal prison at
Alcatraz. At my request, I asked
for a meeting with a state law
enforcement officer and on Oct.
9, 1962, Richard R. Rogan met
me in the visitor's room at Alca

"I informed Mr. Rogan that I
wished to discuss with him a
question concerning the influ
ence of persons engaged in gam

early political career of Richard
Nixon.
"I first met Richard Nixon at
a luncheon in the Goodfellow's
Fisherman's Grotto on South

Main Street in 1946. The meet
ing was arranged by Murray
Chotiner, who asked me to meet
Mr. Nixon who was about to
start his first campaign as a
Representative in Congress that
year. I was asked by Nixon and
Chotiner to raise some money
for Nixon's campaign.
"In either 1948 during Nixon's
second race for Congress or
1950 in his campaign for the
Senate, I was again asked by
Murray Chotiner to raise funds
for Nixon's campaign. During
that time I was running most
of the gambling and bookmaking
in Los Angeles County. I re
served the banquet room in the
Hollywood Knickerbocker Hotel
on Ivar Street in Hollywood for
a dinner meeting to which I in
vited approximately 250 persons
who were working with me in
the gambling fraternity. Among
those who were present, whose
names are well known to law
enforcement officers, were Joe
and Fred Sica, Jack Dragna and
George Capri. Also present was
Hy Goldbaum, who is one of the
pit bosses at the Stardust Hotel
in Las Vegas, who also served
a term of imprisonment at the
federal prison at McNeil Island.

Main Street in 1946. The meet
ing was arranged by Murray
Chotiner, who asked me to meet
Mr. Nixon who was about to
start his first campaign as a
Representative in Congress that
year. I was asked by Nixon and
Chotiner to raise some money
for Nixon's campaign.
"In either 1948 during Nixon's
second race for Congress or
1950 in his campaign for the
Senate, I was again asked by
Murray Chotiner to raise funds
for Nixon's campaign. During
that time I was running most
of the gambling and bookmaking
in Los Angeles County. I re
served the banquet room in the
Hollywood Knickerbocker Hotel
on Ivar Street in Hollywood for
a dinner meeting to which I in
vited approximately 250 persons
who were working with me in
the gambling fraternity. Among
those who were present, whose
names are well known to law
enforcement officers, were Joe
and Fred Sica, Jack Dragna and
George Capri. Also present was
Hy Goldbaum, who is one of the
pit bosses at the Stardust Hotel
in Las Vegas, who also served
a term of imprisonment at the
federal prison at McNeil Island.
Capri was one of the owners of
the Flamingo hotel in Las Veg
as.
"Murray Chotiner told me I
should have a quota of $25,000
for the campaign. During the

course of the evening Nixon
spoke for approximately 10 min
utes; Chotiner spoke about half
an hour.
"At this meeting my group
pledged between $17,00 Oand $19,-
000 but this did not meet the
quota set by Nixon and Choti
ner and the group was informed
they would have to stay until
the quota was met."
Note: That sentence, "the
group was informed (by Nixon
and Chotiner) that they would
have to stay until the quota was
set," is especially important. In
brief, Nixon and Chotiner were
putting the squeeze on the
leading gamblers of Southern
California and telling them to
meet a quota. Obviously the
gamblers had a right to expect
something in return.
"In addition to helping Mr.
Nixon financially," continued
Cohen, "I made arrangements to
rent a headquarters for Nixon
in the Pacific Finance building
at Eight and Olive streets in Los
Angeles, which was the same
building occupied by attorney
Sam Rummel. We posted Nixon
signs and literature, and I paid
for the headquarters for three
or four weeks in that building.
During the period that I ran
this Nixon headquarters, I con
tacted most of the gambling fra
ternity in Los Angeles County
to tell them what their share of
the contribution to the Nixon

campaign would be.
"I have been asked by several
newspaper persons and televi
sion employees of NBC during
the 1956 presidential campaign
to make these facts known,"
continued Mickey Cohen, "but
until now I have refused to do
so.
"In view of the fact that Mr.
Nixon is now making speeches
in his campaign for governor
and stating that organized crime
is active in California and that
Eastern hoodlums were seeking
a foothold in California to orga
nize bookmaking, I have decided
that the people of California
should know the true facts with
Nixon's entry into politics being
based upon money raised by me
and my associates in the gam
bling fraternity who started him
off with $26,000.
"There have been no promises
made to me of any kind or na
ture and the above statement has
been given by me freely and
voluntarily." Signed: "Michael
Cohen."
What the gamblers got in re
turn is spelled out in the records
of the Los Angeles County court
between 1949 and 1952, which
show that Nixon's campaign
manager, Murray Chotiner, and
his brother acted as attorney in
221 bookmaking and underworld
cases. In almost all instances
their clients got off with light
fines or suspended sentences.
