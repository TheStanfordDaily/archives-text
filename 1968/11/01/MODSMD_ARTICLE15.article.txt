• Retain ROTC
Editor, THE DAILY:
I was seriously disturbed to
hear of the motion now before
the Academic Senate to abolish
academic credit for ROTC. Al
though not an ROTC student
myself, I still object to this mo
tion on grounds of principle, in
that it is contrary to the pur
pose of the University.
One of the few unassailable
goals of a university is the
transmission of past and present
knowledge. Regardless of any
and all protestations, military
history and practice are and
have been a fact of human exis
tence. We cannot afford to ig
nore the structure or psychology
of the military establishment.
We must not, as this motion
recommends, literally "discredit"
the ROTC program. If the in
struction is judged to be below
Stanford standards, let the teach
ing be upgraded.
But once a precedent has been
set of one department proscrib
ing or discrediting another, there

is no logical end to the process
of excluding various areas of
knowledge from free inquiry.
Thus, to "encourage the free
intellectual development of all
students," I would suggest that
ROTC retain its accreditation
on the condition that it be com
pletely opened to all students, for
otherwise it cannot serve the
Stanford community.

• For Taketa
Editor, THE DAILY:
In its endorsement of Grayson
S. Taketa, Democratic candidate
for Congress in the 10th District,
the Stanford Daily Editorial
Board failed to take into account
the endorsement by Cesar Cha
vez and the United Farm Work
ers of Taketa as "a good friend
of the farm worker." It failed to
consider that the local NAACP
chapter defied national NAACP
policy of no endorsement of can
didates in order to endorse Ta
keta because of his strong posi
tion on civil rights and social
needs.
The Editorial Board took no
recognition of the fact that Ta
keta has been endorsed by his
opponent in the primary, Robert
K. Arnold, and by Congressman
Don Edwards. When Eugene Mc-
Carthy appeared at Stanford re

cently, he wore a Taketa button.
Robert Kennedy's county co
chairmen have 1 both endorsed
Taketa. Taketa supports Hubert
Humphrey, as do many of the
most active Kennedy and Mc-
Carthy workers in this county.
Did this detract from his en
dorsement by the Editorial
Board?
Did they know that in 1966
Taketa went to Mississippi as a
volunteer attorney for civil
rights at great personal risk?
Did they know that this summer
he inspected living and working
conditions among farm workers
in our county even when con
fronted by rock-throwing fore
men? Did they know he has
given many hours of service to
the California Rural Legal As
sistance League and the county
Legal Aid Society? Did they
know he waited four hours at a
hearing to speak on behalf of
adoption of the Bay Conserva
tion and Development Commis
sion report?
Did they know that Taketa
has urged reform of our elec
toral system to make it more re
sponsive to the voters and has
urged reform of Congress to
make it more responsive to its
constituents? Did the Board
know that Taketa has repeated
ly argued that we must halt the

arms race and redirect our econ
omy and skills to peacetime pro
ductivity?
We regret that the Editorial
Board gave such a lukewarm en
dorsement to a man who de
serves wholehearted support.

• Austrian Families?
Editor, THE DAILY:
There seems to be a contro
versy about whether there are
families attached to the Aus
trian campus. There were no
families linked to the campus
that carried over from Austria V
to our group as far as we know
or have heard. We heard of no
list of families until we came
back here. The list is apparently
lost. Our group never saw it.
Of course, some students in
Austria VI met Austrian fami
lies on their own. For the group
as a whole, students assembled
a list of those students who
wanted families. Instructors and
administrators who were Aus
trians were asked to help ar
range a family program. But no
program was set up.
The blame which Bill Evers
assigned at the Austria counter
orientation was not to "some
one" for not having provided the
students with families, but rath
er to the persons constituting
the "Austria night" discussion
at the beginning of fall quar
ter. The problem lies in the
general expectation of students
going overseas that there are
families linked to the campuses.
What needs to be made clear is
that students who want to meet
families in Austria have to go
out and work hard to find some,
if any.
