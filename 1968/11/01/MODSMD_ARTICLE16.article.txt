# Bomb Halt Aids Humphrey Campaign
## 
### JACK BELL AP News Analysis 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Hu
bert H. Humphrey got his big
gest contribution of the presi
dential campaign Thursday
night with President Johnson's
decision to halt all bombard
ment of North Vietnam.
But the haze left hanging over
Hanoi's reciprocal intentions
clouded the impact of the Presi
dent's action on Tuesday's bal
loting.
Republican and Democratic
strategists agreed privately that
Humphrey, as the Democratic
presidential nominee, would
benefit psychologically by even
a belated presidential decision

to take an action that has be
come a symbol of the cataclys
mic dissention within the Demo
cratic party.
Highly placed Democrats said
Johnson's decision to test Ha
noi's reciprocal intentions could
only act to cut the ground from
under Democratic antiwar pro
testers who have been inclined
not to vote at all Tuesday.
On the other hand, Republi
can strategists suggested that
the President's action, only five
days before the election, would
be considered by the voters as a
cynical attempted coup to swing
the election.
Some of them said that, for all
outward purposes, Johnson had

accepted Hanoi's terms for an
unconditional halt in the bomb
ing before any real peace talks
could start.
But above all of this political
bickering stood the towering de
mand of the voters —as regis
tered by response to both ma
jor candidates when they have
talked of peace in the campaign
—to get the Vietnam war over
with.
Johnson stressed in his na
tional broadcast talk that "pro
gress has come" in the search
for peace. He called the devel
opments a major step toward "a
firm and honorable peace" in
Southeast Asia.
This is what politicians say is

the inate demand of the voters.
Significantly. Humphrey said
in Newark, N.J.. that Johnson's
decision would "help the cause
of peace." He did not mention
that he himself had put recipro
cal conditions around a bombing
halt that were only implied in
Johnson's statement
His Republican opponent,
Richard M. Nixon, had no op
tion but to accept the decision.
He has said he would accept the
decision of the President to halt
the bombing if that would result
in the loss of fewer American
lives. He hardly seemed in any
position to challenge Johnson's
action directly.
Former Gov. George C. Wal
lace of Alabama, the third party
contender, seemed to have been
left out on a limb by the Presi
dent's action.
Wallace has been demanding
that Hanoi publish its reciprocal
intentions before any bombing
halt. Johnson had no concrete
intentions of that sort to dis
close. Wallace's running mate,
retired Gen. Curtis LeMay, re
cently has been advocating more
intensive bombing of North
Vietnam.

In the last two weeks Nixon
has been trying to mitigate the
political impact of a bombing
halt.
He lias reported that he had
heard that Johnson might make
some "cynical" political move
o1" this sort, saying promptly
that he didn't believe it.

His Republican opponent,

WASHINGTON (AP) — Hu
bert H. Humphrey got his big
gest contribution of the presi
dential campaign Thursday
night with President Johnson's
decision to halt all bombard
ment of North Vietnam.
But the haze left hanging over
Hanoi's reciprocal intentions
clouded the impact of the Presi
dent's action on Tuesday's bal
loting.
Republican and Democratic
strategists agreed privately that
Humphrey, as the Democratic
presidential nominee, would
benefit psychologically by even
a belated presidential decision

to take an action that has be
come a symbol of the cataclys
mic dissention within the Demo
cratic party.
Highly placed Democrats said
Johnson's decision to test Ha
noi's reciprocal intentions could
only act to cut the ground from
under Democratic antiwar pro
testers who have been inclined
not to vote at all Tuesday.
On the other hand, Republi
can strategists suggested that
the President's action, only five
days before the election, would
be considered by the voters as a
cynical attempted coup to swing
the election.
