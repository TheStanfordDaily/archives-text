# Election Disruptions?
## Demonstrations Set 
### 
(AP) — Militant war protest
ers and radical students are
planning election day demonstra
tions in several American cities,
but some of the leaders say they
do not intend to disrupt voting.
The plans include:
• A strike Monday and Tues
day by high school and college
students across the country "to
protest university military and
racist policies."
• A day-long demonstration of
thousands of students on elec
tion day, ending with a protest
gathering at the national head
quarters of Richard M. Nixon in
New York.
• A demonstration by draft
resisters at Hubert H. Hum
phrey's lakeshore home in Wa
verly, Minn., to burn draft cards.
• An "antielection people's fes
tival" at Chicago's Lincoln Park,
the staging ground for the bitter
battles between protesters and
police at the Democratic Nation
al Convention.
• Similar demonstrations in
such cities as Washington, Bos
ton, Baltimore, Los Angeles, San
Francisco, Seattle, Hartford,
Conn., and in Colorado.
Key movers behind the plans
are the radical Students for a
Democratic Society, which led
the protests that crippled the
Columbia University campus last
spring, and the National Mo
bilization Committee to End the
War in Vietnam, which helped
organize the August demonstra
tions in Chicago.
"We are not seeking any kind

of disruption," said Rennis Dav
is, national coordinator of the
mobilization committee. "We
only want to demonstrate our
repudiation of the alternatives
in this election."
"We will encourage write-in
voting and votes for any peace
candidates," Davis says.
But Michael Klonsky of New
York, SDS national secretary,
said: "It depends on the peo
ple. We are going to have Chi
cago-style street demonstrations

—and that means power con
frontations."
And Jerry Rubin, leader of
the Youth International Party
the Yippies—said in Chicago
recently that the demonstrations
"will be so bad that the govern
ment will have to bring out the
National Guard all over the
country."
Thomas Hayden, former SDS
leader, said, however, that he
doesn't expect the demonstra
tions to be very effective.


DISCOTHEQUE —Stanford's new Discotheque happened last Fri
day, and the patio of the Bechtel International Center was the scene.
Bright colored images flashed on suspended parachutes, and beer
and Sangria were served at the bar. The Discotheque will be the
scene every Friday night at 8:30 in the International Center. Indi
vidual (contributions will help to make the event better and better.

such cities as Washington, Bos
ton, Baltimore, Los Angeles, San
Francisco, Seattle, Hartford,
Conn., and in Colorado.
Key movers behind the plans
are the radical Students for a
Democratic Society, which led
the protests that crippled the
Columbia University campus last
spring, and the National Mo
bilization Committee to End the
War in Vietnam, which helped
organize the August demonstra
tions in Chicago.
"We are not seeking any kind

of disruption," said Rennis Dav
is, national coordinator of the
mobilization committee. "We
only want to demonstrate our
repudiation of the alternatives
in this election."
"We will encourage write-in
voting and votes for any peace
candidates," Davis says.
But Michael Klonsky of New
York, SDS national secretary,
said: "It depends on the peo
ple. We are going to have Chi
cago-style street demonstrations

—and that means power con
frontations."
And Jerry Rubin, leader of
the Youth International Party
the Yippies—said in Chicago
recently that the demonstrations
"will be so bad that the govern
ment will have to bring out the
National Guard all over the
country."
Thomas Hayden, former SDS
leader, said, however, that he
doesn't expect the demonstra
tions to be very effective.
