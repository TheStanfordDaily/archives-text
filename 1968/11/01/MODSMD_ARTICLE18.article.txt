# Congressional Play To Open
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
Tuesday the United States
will choose its President for (he
next four years. Or will it? Ex
perts on the political situation
are all talking about the possi
bility that no candidate will re
ceive a majority of electoral
votes and the election of the
President may be left up to the
House of Representatives. If this
happens, what will the House
do?
This question may be an
swered Saturday evening at 8
p.m. in Dinkolspiel Auditorium
when the Theater of the Con
gressional Record presents "The
House Elects A President â€”
1825."
The production, will be an ac
tual presentation of the edited
speeches given in the House of
Representatives in 1825 when
the House elected John Quincy
Adams Prsident after no candi
date (Adams, Henry Clay, or
Andrew Jackson) received a ma
jority of the votes of the elec
toral college. The speeches are
taken directly from the Congres
sional Record and will be de
livered in an atmosphere remi
niscent of Congress.
According to John Kulsar,
Professor of speech in the Grad
uate School of Business and un
dergraduate Speech and Drama
Department and director of the
production, "The possibility pre
sents itself (that the presidential
election on Tuesday will be
thrown into the House of Rep
resentatives) and this produc

tion sheds light and understand
ing on that past movement. It is
a full dimensional look. In this
production in a relatively lim
ited space of time the public is
given a full spectrum of as
many arguments as could be
found on the issue. This is a

rare opportunity."
Kulsar distinguishes the The
ater of the Congressional Rec
ord from the theater of illusion.
He explained that the theater
is "not trying to create an illu
sion. We are rather trying to re
enact deliberations of Congress."
