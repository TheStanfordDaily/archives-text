# After 20 Years
## New Science Complex 
### BARBARA HYLAND 
The gaping chasm near Lo
mita Drive is the site for a new

Earth Sciences building to be
completed in early 1970. This 4-
story structure, with a basement

and sub-basement, will supple
ment the inadequate facilities of
the Geology Corner.
The old building, with its 39,-
300 square feet of floor space,
has housed the School of Earth
Sciences for GO years. Dr. Ben
jamin Page, Chairman of the
Geology Department, said his de
partment has needed a new
building "ever since the war" for
"at least 20 years." The new
building will provide 94,540
square feet of floor space.
Since 1940 the gfaduate stu
dent body of the School of Earth
Science has increased by 500 per
cent. For several years, the
school used old pre-war wooden
buildings which were part of
the women's gym. When these
were torn down, lack of space
became crucial.
Equipment, such as X-Ray in
struments, is presently scattered
throughout the campus. The 50,-
000 volume Earth Science Li
brary, one of the world's finest,
is "poorly housed" according to
Page. Books are now stored in
"the attic, the law building, here
and there."
The new building will central
ize the equipment and consoli
date the activities of Mineral
Engineering, Petroleum Engi
neering, Geophysics, and Geolo
gy. Page pointed out that one
of the benefits of the new build
ing is that "parts of each de
partment will be housed there."
This facilitates "favorable inter
action." There are already sev
eral interdepartmental appoint
ments among the staff.
The plans for the structure in
clude two floors below ground.
The sub-basement will be for
central analytical facilities, such
as X-Ray and spectroscopic in
struments, an electron micro
scope, and an electron micro
probe.
The basement will contain lab
oratories and offices. Classrooms
and administrative offices will be
on the ground floor. The second
floor and mezzanine will be de
voted to the library. The third
and fourth floors are for more
labs and offices.
The approximate construction
cost is $3.2 million. Financial
problems had delayed the con
struction for many years. Page
said, "We'd had quasi-promises
from individuals," but nothing
definite.

Stanford applied for federal
assistance, but "at a bad time."
A National Science Foundation
team examined Stanford's needs
and sent in a favorable report.
However, the request for more
than a million dollars is still
pending.
The late Mrs. Shepard Mitchell
of Beverly Hills then donated
the needed $1,026,000. She con
tributed it in memory of her
parents, Mr. and Mrs. Edmund
O. Wattis. Wattis, as co-founder
of Utah Mining and Construc
tion Co. and president of The
Six Companies, builders of Hoo
ver Dam, was closely connected
with the earth sciences field.
Three days after participating
in the August 22 groundbreak
ing ceremonies, Mrs. Mitchell
died. The building will be named
the Ruth Wattis Mitchell Earth
Sciences Building in her honor.
The new building will mainly
be used by those doing ad
vanced research. The Geophysics
Department is investigating seis
mic behavior, gravity, magne
tism, and also movements of the
ocean floor.
The research of the Geology
Department overlaps the Geo
physics Department's programs.
It is studying the effects of high
temperature and pressure. The
biological side of geology, the
"development of an organism as
seen in the geologic record," is
also being explored.
Mineral Engineering is pio
neering in a new subfield, the
use of indirect means for remote
sensing of the earth and other
planets. These means include in
frared rays, electromagnetic
waves, and satellites.
Petroleum Engineering is de
veloping uses for geothermal
power. At present, parts of Cali
fornia are getting electricity
from natural thermal power. In
Italy, a forerunner in this area,
80 percent of the electricity for
its trains comes from geother
mal energy.
The research equipment and
laboratories in the new building
will therefore benefit mainly
graduates. Undergraduates will
still have their general classes
in the Geology Corner, which
is convenient to the Quad. Page
hopes this building will be mod
ernized, but that unfortunately
may be "much, much later."


EARTH SCIENCES â€” Construction for the new Earth Sciences
building is due to he completed in the spring of 1970. The building
will centralize the analytical equipment for all of the science de
partments and house the Earth Science Library.
