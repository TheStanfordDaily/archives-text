# Mayor Stokes Urges Blacks 'Don't Sit Out The Election'
## 
### 
"It never works to sit out an
election," declared Carl Stokes,
Cleveland's first black mayor,
yesterday to an overflow crowd
in Tresidder's large lounge.
"Once those fellows get in they
do things which sometimes you
can never recover from."
In an off-the-cuff talk spon
sored by the Black Student Un
ion, Stokes insisted that blacks
must use their votes to keep
Republican advocates out of the
White House. He also urged
blacks to "cease to reflect the
climate that has led both presi
dential candidates to talk about
law and order."
Stokes reiterated his belief in
the democratic system. "My own
life has been one which has dem
onstrated the efficacy of the po
litical system.
"I am in City Hall because I
believed that if I got enough
votes the system would put me
there. I didn't listen when the
political prognosticators told me,
'Stokes, not one white person is
going to vote for you'."
In a question and answer peri
od following the talk, a black
student asked the mayor if he
was campaigning for the Vice-
President as the lesser of three
evils. The student pressed Stokes
to "tell me something Humphrey
has done for the blacks to de
serve my vote."
In reply, Stokes pointed to sev
eral civil rights proposals for
which Humphrey had worked.
Some members of the audience
expressed concern that Hum
phrey appeared to be adopting

Nixon's theme of law and or
der. Stokes defended the Vice-
President by saying that Hum
phrey's position was *he result
of "having to pander to the low
intellect of the American voter."
The mayor closed by saying
that simply the fact that "I could
come and we could exchange our

views demonstrates the value of
the system."
On the plight of the American
Negro. Stokes said, "I accept the
fact of what the American Ne
gro is being subjected to as op
posed to other ethnic counter
parts. But that doesn't mean the
system cant' work."

CARL STOKES—"The day I got elected I had to be made mayor.
Why? Because of the system. Since then there has been a certain
concert of action to try to get me out. But they can't take me bodily
and put me out of office because of the system. That's one of the
reasons I believe in it."

"I am in City Hall because I
believed that if I got enough
votes the system would put me
there. I didn't listen when the
political prognosticators told me,
'Stokes, not one white person is
going to vote for you'."
In a question and answer peri
od following the talk, a black
student asked the mayor if he
was campaigning for the Vice-
President as the lesser of three
evils. The student pressed Stokes
to "tell me something Humphrey
has done for the blacks to de
serve my vote."
In reply, Stokes pointed to sev
eral civil rights proposals for
which Humphrey had worked.
Some members of the audience
expressed concern that Hum
phrey appeared to be adopting

Nixon's theme of law and or
der. Stokes defended the Vice-
President by saying that Hum
phrey's position was *he result
of "having to pander to the low
intellect of the American voter."
The mayor closed by saying
that simply the fact that "I could
come and we could exchange our

views demonstrates the value of
the system."
On the plight of the American
Negro. Stokes said, "I accept the
fact of what the American Ne
gro is being subjected to as op
posed to other ethnic counter
parts. But that doesn't mean the
system cant' work."

CARL STOKES—"The day I got elected I had to be made mayor.
Why? Because of the system. Since then there has been a certain
concert of action to try to get me out. But they can't take me bodily
and put me out of office because of the system. That's one of the
reasons I believe in it."
"It never works to sit out an
election," declared Carl Stokes,
Cleveland's first black mayor,
yesterday to an overflow crowd
in Tresidder's large lounge.
"Once those fellows get in they
do things which sometimes you
can never recover from."
In an off-the-cuff talk spon
sored by the Black Student Un
ion, Stokes insisted that blacks
must use their votes to keep
Republican advocates out of the
White House. He also urged
blacks to "cease to reflect the
climate that has led both presi
dential candidates to talk about
law and order."
Stokes reiterated his belief in
the democratic system. "My own
life has been one which has dem
onstrated the efficacy of the po
litical system.
