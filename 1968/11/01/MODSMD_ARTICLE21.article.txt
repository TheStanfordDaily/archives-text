# Presidential Candidates Discuss Campaign Issues
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: As a service to
its readers, THE DAILY pre
sents excerpts from recent As
sociated Press interviews with
the three major candidates for
president. Democrat H a be r t
Humphrey, Republican Richard
Nixon, and George Wallace,
American Independent party,
were asked to state their posi
tions on major issues of the cur
rent electoray campaign.)
Q. What would you do about
student demonstrations, some of
which have been overt opposi
tion to the war in Vietnam?
Humphrey: When a demon
stration gets to a point where it
affects the physical well-being
of others, or where it becomes
destructive of property or in
jurious of person, then it is un
lawful. At that point the police
or law enforcement officials
must take action.
When you start to throw
chairs, break up the furniture,
injure people, break up a peace
ful assembly, then you have vio
lated the law. And you are sub
ject to penalties.
NixOn: I think that the uni
versity and college officials
should take an uncompromising
line and it is this: That in a so
ciety like ours, which provides a
method of peacefully changing
those things we do not like, there
is no cause that justifies break
ing the law or indulging in vio
lence.
The very definition of college
means that the rule of reason
shall prevail over the rule of
force.
Any individual, whether he is
a student or a member of the
college faculty, who does not ac
cept that proposition and who
breaks the law and engages in
violence, doesn't belong in col
lege and should be expelled im
mediately. That would be my
advice. That would be the na
tional tone I would set. And I
would hope that some of the
leaders of our colleges and uni
versities would get the spine and
backbone to do exactly that.
Wallace: You have a right to
demonstrate against the war,
but when you march on a city
street, you ought not to march
for three straight weeks and tie
up trade and commerce and im
peril the safety of people as a
result of continuous demonstra
tion.
_To make a speech saying I

want the Communists to win
and they print that speech in
the Communist capitals, that's
not legitimate dissent. That's an
overt act of treason because it
aids and abets the enemies of our
country and if you apply a little
common sense you can tell a
legitimate dissenter from one
who's not a legitimate dissenter.
★ ★ ★
Q. How would you end the war
in Vietnam? On what terms?
What should have been done
earlier ?-
Humphrey: I think the best
way to protect our troops in
the South is to see that the war
is shortened and to de-escalate
the struggle if it can be done.
Then I also outlined in my pro
gram the reduction of American
forces.
I believe that with the im
provement of the army of South
Vietnam in its combat effective-

ness, with its weapons, modern
weapons, with good training and
combat experience, with over
800,000 men now in it he army
of South Vietnam, it will be pos
sible for the next president of
the U.S. to meet with the lead
ers of South Vietnam to work
out a schedule of American troop
reduction — a de-Americaniza
tion of this struggle as the
ARVN is more capable of its
own self-defense.
I have said I am opposed to
any government that is imposed
from either Hanoi or Washing
ton, that I believe in free elec
tions and always have. Now if
the South Vietnamese in a free
election should bring in some
elements of the NLF Vietcong
that were elected, that would be
their business. I wouldn't like
it but that is their business.
..Nixon: First, I would never
have used more military force
and, particularly, I would never
have used bombing in a gradual
way. I would not have used it at
all until I used it diplomatically.
The application of force grad
ually is a mistake. We have
wasted our military advantage
by applying it gradually.
Second, the perhaps most fun
damental error the administra
tion has made in Vietnam is due
to its failure to understand the
character of the war. This is a
guerrilla war, which means that
it is a war for people rather
than territory. Therefore, your
primary emphasis must be on
developing programs which en
list the people of South Vietnam
economically, politically and mil
itarilv in their own defense.
Recently there has been some
movement, but until very re
cently we have not trained the
South Vietnamese. We have not
had an adequate program in

the countryside to develop the
political and other institutions so
that the South Vietnamese, once
we left, would be strong enough
to contain these guerrilla ac
tivities.
Wallace: If I were president
and peace talks hadn't concluded,
and we don't have an honorable
stettlement by the time of the
new administration, then I think
we ought to set some time limit
in the matter of negotiations.
And then if they don't solve and
settle the matter honorably, then
we ought to win a military vic
tory with conventional weapons
and get out of Vietnam.
We shouldn't have gone there

by ourselves in the first place. I
hear one of the other candidates
say what I've said for a long
time — it is just as much to
Western Europe and non-Com
munist Asia's interests to be
there as it is for us to be there.
Q. How would you deal with
racial disorders such as rioting
and looting?
★ ★ ★
Humphrey: When a riot oc
curs, there must be rapid intro
duction of sufficient manpower
into the area for quick and
prompt action, including if nec
essary augmentation of the po
lice force by adequate numbers
military—National Guard or
regular Army. The emphasis
must be on additional men rath
er than on guns.
NLxon: Rioting in the first in
stance must be dealt with ... by
swift action at the beginning.
W need an early warning sys
tem in all the communities in the
event that a riot begins, a mas
sive display of adequate police
force. And in the event there
are not adequate local forces,
that means of course, supple
menting the local forces, on re
quest, with federal forces.
Wallace: "I think the police
ought to be allowed to enforce
the law. I think they have to be
allowed to use whatever meth
ods are necessary to prevent the
breakdown of law and order.

And then if it does break down,
they ought to be allowed to use
whatever measures are neces
sary to stop it.
★ ★ ★
Q. What would you consider
the most important issue of the
campaign?
Humphrey: Well, I would have
to put them together. I think it
it the reduction of tensions
abroad, and the reduction of ten
sions here at home. Or to put it
another way, to bring this war
in Vietnam to an end and to put
a halt to the arms race, and
here at home to try to find ways
and means of bringing into th.
mainstream of American life
people who have been somewhat
excluded . . .to try to minimize
and do away with the racial ten
sion and bitterness which is evi
dent in some areas of our na
tional life.
In other words, to unify our
people as best we can. It is the
biggest task that any man is
ever going to have.
Nixon: The one that universal
ly disturbs people more than any
other, and this is true of black
Americans as well as white
Americans, is the question of the
safety of Americans in their
homes, or the streets of their
cities. In other words, it is the
law and order question.
The question of peace abroad,
of course, is predominant, be

cause if we don't get peace
abroad, it isn't going to make
any difference if we have the
best Social Security, medical
carecare, lowest taxes in history,
if we aren't around to enjoy it.
Therefore, people are predomi
nantly concerned with that.
But right now the subject
which 5s uppermost in their
minds is the fact that they see
crime going up nine times
as fast as population. This
key fact, I think, is getting
through when you have a poll
showing that 43 per cent of the
American people today are
afraid to walk in the streets of
their cities at night.
Wallace: I think the most im
portant issue involved it Viet
nam coupled with the breakdown
of law and order.

by ourselves in the first place. I
hear one of the other candidates
say what I've said for a long
time — it is just as much to
Western Europe and non-Com
munist Asia's interests to be
there as it is for us to be there.
Q. How would you deal with
racial disorders such as rioting
and looting?
★ ★ ★
Humphrey: When a riot oc
curs, there must be rapid intro
duction of sufficient manpower
into the area for quick and
prompt action, including if nec
essary augmentation of the po
lice force by adequate numbers
military—National Guard or
regular Army. The emphasis
must be on additional men rath
er than on guns.
NLxon: Rioting in the first in
stance must be dealt with ... by
swift action at the beginning.
W need an early warning sys
tem in all the communities in the
event that a riot begins, a mas
sive display of adequate police
force. And in the event there
are not adequate local forces,
that means of course, supple
menting the local forces, on re
quest, with federal forces.
Wallace: "I think the police
ought to be allowed to enforce
the law. I think they have to be
allowed to use whatever meth
ods are necessary to prevent the
breakdown of law and order.

And then if it does break down,
they ought to be allowed to use
whatever measures are neces
sary to stop it.
★ ★ ★
Q. What would you consider
the most important issue of the
campaign?
Humphrey: Well, I would have
to put them together. I think it
it the reduction of tensions
abroad, and the reduction of ten
sions here at home. Or to put it
another way, to bring this war
in Vietnam to an end and to put
a halt to the arms race, and
here at home to try to find ways
and means of bringing into th.
mainstream of American life
people who have been somewhat
excluded . . .to try to minimize
and do away with the racial ten
sion and bitterness which is evi
dent in some areas of our na
tional life.
In other words, to unify our
people as best we can. It is the
biggest task that any man is
ever going to have.
Nixon: The one that universal
ly disturbs people more than any
other, and this is true of black
Americans as well as white
Americans, is the question of the
safety of Americans in their
homes, or the streets of their
cities. In other words, it is the
law and order question.
The question of peace abroad,
of course, is predominant, be

cause if we don't get peace
abroad, it isn't going to make
any difference if we have the
best Social Security, medical
carecare, lowest taxes in history,
if we aren't around to enjoy it.
Therefore, people are predomi
nantly concerned with that.
But right now the subject
which 5s uppermost in their
minds is the fact that they see
crime going up nine times
as fast as population. This
key fact, I think, is getting
through when you have a poll
showing that 43 per cent of the
American people today are
afraid to walk in the streets of
their cities at night.
Wallace: I think the most im
portant issue involved it Viet
nam coupled with the breakdown
of law and order.

(Editor's Note: As a service to
its readers, THE DAILY pre
sents excerpts from recent As
sociated Press interviews with
the three major candidates for
president. Democrat H a be r t
Humphrey, Republican Richard
Nixon, and George Wallace,
American Independent party,
were asked to state their posi
tions on major issues of the cur
rent electoray campaign.)
Q. What would you do about
student demonstrations, some of
which have been overt opposi
tion to the war in Vietnam?
Humphrey: When a demon
stration gets to a point where it
affects the physical well-being
of others, or where it becomes
destructive of property or in
jurious of person, then it is un
lawful. At that point the police
or law enforcement officials
must take action.
When you start to throw
chairs, break up the furniture,
injure people, break up a peace
ful assembly, then you have vio
lated the law. And you are sub
ject to penalties.
NixOn: I think that the uni
versity and college officials
should take an uncompromising
line and it is this: That in a so
ciety like ours, which provides a
method of peacefully changing
those things we do not like, there
is no cause that justifies break
ing the law or indulging in vio
lence.
The very definition of college
means that the rule of reason
shall prevail over the rule of
force.
Any individual, whether he is
a student or a member of the
college faculty, who does not ac
cept that proposition and who
breaks the law and engages in
violence, doesn't belong in col
lege and should be expelled im
mediately. That would be my
advice. That would be the na
tional tone I would set. And I
would hope that some of the
leaders of our colleges and uni
versities would get the spine and
backbone to do exactly that.
Wallace: You have a right to
demonstrate against the war,
but when you march on a city
street, you ought not to march
for three straight weeks and tie
up trade and commerce and im
peril the safety of people as a
result of continuous demonstra
tion.
_To make a speech saying I

want the Communists to win
and they print that speech in
the Communist capitals, that's
not legitimate dissent. That's an
overt act of treason because it
aids and abets the enemies of our
country and if you apply a little
common sense you can tell a
legitimate dissenter from one
who's not a legitimate dissenter.
★ ★ ★
Q. How would you end the war
in Vietnam? On what terms?
What should have been done
earlier ?-
Humphrey: I think the best
way to protect our troops in
the South is to see that the war
is shortened and to de-escalate
the struggle if it can be done.
Then I also outlined in my pro
gram the reduction of American
forces.
I believe that with the im
provement of the army of South
Vietnam in its combat effective-

ness, with its weapons, modern
weapons, with good training and
combat experience, with over
800,000 men now in it he army
of South Vietnam, it will be pos
sible for the next president of
the U.S. to meet with the lead
ers of South Vietnam to work
out a schedule of American troop
reduction — a de-Americaniza
tion of this struggle as the
ARVN is more capable of its
own self-defense.
I have said I am opposed to
any government that is imposed
from either Hanoi or Washing
ton, that I believe in free elec
tions and always have. Now if
the South Vietnamese in a free
election should bring in some
elements of the NLF Vietcong
that were elected, that would be
their business. I wouldn't like
it but that is their business.
..Nixon: First, I would never
have used more military force
and, particularly, I would never
have used bombing in a gradual
way. I would not have used it at
all until I used it diplomatically.
The application of force grad
ually is a mistake. We have
wasted our military advantage
by applying it gradually.
Second, the perhaps most fun
damental error the administra
tion has made in Vietnam is due
to its failure to understand the
character of the war. This is a
guerrilla war, which means that
it is a war for people rather
than territory. Therefore, your
primary emphasis must be on
developing programs which en
list the people of South Vietnam
economically, politically and mil
itarilv in their own defense.
Recently there has been some
movement, but until very re
cently we have not trained the
South Vietnamese. We have not
had an adequate program in

the countryside to develop the
political and other institutions so
that the South Vietnamese, once
we left, would be strong enough
to contain these guerrilla ac
tivities.
Wallace: If I were president
and peace talks hadn't concluded,
and we don't have an honorable
stettlement by the time of the
new administration, then I think
we ought to set some time limit
in the matter of negotiations.
And then if they don't solve and
settle the matter honorably, then
we ought to win a military vic
tory with conventional weapons
and get out of Vietnam.
We shouldn't have gone there

by ourselves in the first place. I
hear one of the other candidates
say what I've said for a long
time — it is just as much to
Western Europe and non-Com
munist Asia's interests to be
there as it is for us to be there.

demonstrate against the war,
but when you march on a city
street, you ought not to march
for three straight weeks and tie
up trade and commerce and im
peril the safety of people as a
result of continuous demonstra
tion.
_To make a speech saying I

want the Communists to win
and they print that speech in
the Communist capitals, that's
not legitimate dissent. That's an
overt act of treason because it
aids and abets the enemies of our
country and if you apply a little
common sense you can tell a
legitimate dissenter from one
who's not a legitimate dissenter.
★ ★ ★
Q. How would you end the war
in Vietnam? On what terms?
What should have been done
earlier ?-
Humphrey: I think the best
way to protect our troops in
the South is to see that the war
is shortened and to de-escalate
the struggle if it can be done.
Then I also outlined in my pro
gram the reduction of American
forces.
I believe that with the im
provement of the army of South
Vietnam in its combat effective-

ness, with its weapons, modern
weapons, with good training and
combat experience, with over
800,000 men now in it he army
of South Vietnam, it will be pos
sible for the next president of
the U.S. to meet with the lead
ers of South Vietnam to work
out a schedule of American troop
reduction — a de-Americaniza
tion of this struggle as the
ARVN is more capable of its
own self-defense.
I have said I am opposed to
any government that is imposed
from either Hanoi or Washing
ton, that I believe in free elec
tions and always have. Now if
the South Vietnamese in a free
election should bring in some
elements of the NLF Vietcong
that were elected, that would be
their business. I wouldn't like
it but that is their business.
..Nixon: First, I would never
have used more military force
and, particularly, I would never
have used bombing in a gradual
way. I would not have used it at
all until I used it diplomatically.
The application of force grad
ually is a mistake. We have
wasted our military advantage
by applying it gradually.
Second, the perhaps most fun
damental error the administra
tion has made in Vietnam is due
to its failure to understand the
character of the war. This is a
guerrilla war, which means that
it is a war for people rather
than territory. Therefore, your
primary emphasis must be on
developing programs which en
list the people of South Vietnam
economically, politically and mil
itarilv in their own defense.
Recently there has been some
movement, but until very re
cently we have not trained the
South Vietnamese. We have not
had an adequate program in

the countryside to develop the
political and other institutions so
that the South Vietnamese, once
we left, would be strong enough
to contain these guerrilla ac
tivities.
Wallace: If I were president
and peace talks hadn't concluded,
and we don't have an honorable
stettlement by the time of the
new administration, then I think
we ought to set some time limit
in the matter of negotiations.
And then if they don't solve and
settle the matter honorably, then
we ought to win a military vic
tory with conventional weapons
and get out of Vietnam.
We shouldn't have gone there

by ourselves in the first place. I
hear one of the other candidates
say what I've said for a long
time — it is just as much to
Western Europe and non-Com
munist Asia's interests to be
there as it is for us to be there.
Q. How would you deal with
racial disorders such as rioting
and looting?
★ ★ ★
Humphrey: When a riot oc
curs, there must be rapid intro
duction of sufficient manpower
into the area for quick and
prompt action, including if nec
essary augmentation of the po
lice force by adequate numbers
military—National Guard or
regular Army. The emphasis
must be on additional men rath
er than on guns.
NLxon: Rioting in the first in
stance must be dealt with ... by
swift action at the beginning.
W need an early warning sys
tem in all the communities in the
event that a riot begins, a mas
sive display of adequate police
force. And in the event there
are not adequate local forces,
that means of course, supple
menting the local forces, on re
quest, with federal forces.
Wallace: "I think the police
ought to be allowed to enforce
the law. I think they have to be
allowed to use whatever meth
ods are necessary to prevent the
breakdown of law and order.

And then if it does break down,
they ought to be allowed to use
whatever measures are neces
sary to stop it.
★ ★ ★
Q. What would you consider
the most important issue of the
campaign?
Humphrey: Well, I would have
to put them together. I think it
it the reduction of tensions
abroad, and the reduction of ten
sions here at home. Or to put it
another way, to bring this war
in Vietnam to an end and to put
a halt to the arms race, and
here at home to try to find ways
and means of bringing into th.
mainstream of American life
people who have been somewhat
excluded . . .to try to minimize
and do away with the racial ten
sion and bitterness which is evi
dent in some areas of our na
tional life.
In other words, to unify our
people as best we can. It is the
biggest task that any man is
ever going to have.
Nixon: The one that universal
ly disturbs people more than any
other, and this is true of black
Americans as well as white
Americans, is the question of the
safety of Americans in their
homes, or the streets of their
cities. In other words, it is the
law and order question.
The question of peace abroad,
of course, is predominant, be

cause if we don't get peace
abroad, it isn't going to make
any difference if we have the
best Social Security, medical
carecare, lowest taxes in history,
if we aren't around to enjoy it.
Therefore, people are predomi
nantly concerned with that.
But right now the subject
which 5s uppermost in their
minds is the fact that they see
crime going up nine times
as fast as population. This
key fact, I think, is getting
through when you have a poll
showing that 43 per cent of the
American people today are
afraid to walk in the streets of
their cities at night.
Wallace: I think the most im
portant issue involved it Viet
nam coupled with the breakdown
of law and order.

GEORGE WALLACE
(Editor's Note: As a service to
its readers, THE DAILY pre
sents excerpts from recent As
sociated Press interviews with
the three major candidates for
president. Democrat H a be r t
Humphrey, Republican Richard
Nixon, and George Wallace,
American Independent party,
were asked to state their posi
tions on major issues of the cur
rent electoray campaign.)
Q. What would you do about
student demonstrations, some of
which have been overt opposi
tion to the war in Vietnam?
Humphrey: When a demon
stration gets to a point where it
affects the physical well-being
of others, or where it becomes
destructive of property or in
jurious of person, then it is un
lawful. At that point the police
or law enforcement officials
must take action.
When you start to throw
chairs, break up the furniture,
injure people, break up a peace
ful assembly, then you have vio
lated the law. And you are sub
ject to penalties.
NixOn: I think that the uni
versity and college officials
should take an uncompromising
line and it is this: That in a so
ciety like ours, which provides a
method of peacefully changing
those things we do not like, there
is no cause that justifies break
ing the law or indulging in vio
lence.
The very definition of college
means that the rule of reason
shall prevail over the rule of
force.
Any individual, whether he is
a student or a member of the
college faculty, who does not ac
cept that proposition and who
breaks the law and engages in
violence, doesn't belong in col
lege and should be expelled im
mediately. That would be my
advice. That would be the na
tional tone I would set. And I
would hope that some of the
leaders of our colleges and uni
versities would get the spine and
backbone to do exactly that.
Wallace: You have a right to
demonstrate against the war,
but when you march on a city
street, you ought not to march
for three straight weeks and tie
up trade and commerce and im

people who have been somewhat
excluded . . .to try to minimize
and do away with the racial ten
sion and bitterness which is evi
dent in some areas of our na

In other words, to unify our
people as best we can. It is the
biggest task that any man is
ever going to have.
Nixon: The one that universal
ly disturbs people more than any
other, and this is true of black
Americans as well as white
Americans, is the question of the
safety of Americans in their
homes, or the streets of their
cities. In other words, it is the
law and order question.
The question of peace abroad,
of course, is predominant, be

cause if we don't get peace
abroad, it isn't going to make
any difference if we have the
best Social Security, medical
carecare, lowest taxes in history,
if we aren't around to enjoy it.
Therefore, people are predomi
nantly concerned with that.
But right now the subject
which 5s uppermost in their
minds is the fact that they see
crime going up nine times
as fast as population. This
key fact, I think, is getting
through when you have a poll
showing that 43 per cent of the
American people today are

(Editor's Note: As a service to
its readers, THE DAILY pre
sents excerpts from recent As
sociated Press interviews with
the three major candidates for
president. Democrat H a be r t
Humphrey, Republican Richard
Nixon, and George Wallace,
American Independent party,
were asked to state their posi
tions on major issues of the cur
rent electoray campaign.)
Q. What would you do about
student demonstrations, some of
which have been overt opposi
tion to the war in Vietnam?
Humphrey: When a demon
stration gets to a point where it
affects the physical well-being
of others, or where it becomes
destructive of property or in
jurious of person, then it is un
lawful. At that point the police
or law enforcement officials
must take action.
When you start to throw
chairs, break up the furniture,
injure people, break up a peace
ful assembly, then you have vio
lated the law. And you are sub
ject to penalties.
NixOn: I think that the uni
versity and college officials
should take an uncompromising
line and it is this: That in a so
ciety like ours, which provides a
method of peacefully changing
those things we do not like, there
is no cause that justifies break
ing the law or indulging in vio
lence.
The very definition of college
means that the rule of reason
shall prevail over the rule of
force.
Any individual, whether he is
a student or a member of the
college faculty, who does not ac
cept that proposition and who
breaks the law and engages in
violence, doesn't belong in col
lege and should be expelled im
mediately. That would be my
advice. That would be the na
tional tone I would set. And I
would hope that some of the
leaders of our colleges and uni
versities would get the spine and
backbone to do exactly that.
Wallace: You have a right to
demonstrate against the war,
but when you march on a city
street, you ought not to march
for three straight weeks and tie
up trade and commerce and im
peril the safety of people as a
result of continuous demonstra
tion.
_To make a speech saying I

want the Communists to win
and they print that speech in
the Communist capitals, that's
not legitimate dissent. That's an
overt act of treason because it
aids and abets the enemies of our
country and if you apply a little
common sense you can tell a
legitimate dissenter from one
who's not a legitimate dissenter.
★ ★ ★
Q. How would you end the war
in Vietnam? On what terms?
What should have been done
earlier ?-
Humphrey: I think the best
way to protect our troops in
the South is to see that the war
is shortened and to de-escalate
the struggle if it can be done.
Then I also outlined in my pro
gram the reduction of American
forces.
I believe that with the im
provement of the army of South
Vietnam in its combat effective-

ness, with its weapons, modern
weapons, with good training and
combat experience, with over
800,000 men now in it he army
of South Vietnam, it will be pos
sible for the next president of
the U.S. to meet with the lead
ers of South Vietnam to work
out a schedule of American troop
reduction — a de-Americaniza
tion of this struggle as the
ARVN is more capable of its
own self-defense.
I have said I am opposed to
any government that is imposed
from either Hanoi or Washing
ton, that I believe in free elec
tions and always have. Now if
the South Vietnamese in a free
election should bring in some
elements of the NLF Vietcong
that were elected, that would be
their business. I wouldn't like
it but that is their business.
..Nixon: First, I would never
have used more military force
and, particularly, I would never
have used bombing in a gradual
way. I would not have used it at
all until I used it diplomatically.
The application of force grad
ually is a mistake. We have
wasted our military advantage
by applying it gradually.
Second, the perhaps most fun
damental error the administra
tion has made in Vietnam is due
to its failure to understand the
character of the war. This is a
guerrilla war, which means that
it is a war for people rather
than territory. Therefore, your
primary emphasis must be on
developing programs which en
list the people of South Vietnam
economically, politically and mil
itarilv in their own defense.
Recently there has been some
movement, but until very re
cently we have not trained the
South Vietnamese. We have not
had an adequate program in

the countryside to develop the
political and other institutions so
that the South Vietnamese, once
we left, would be strong enough
to contain these guerrilla ac
tivities.
Wallace: If I were president
and peace talks hadn't concluded,
and we don't have an honorable
stettlement by the time of the
new administration, then I think
we ought to set some time limit
in the matter of negotiations.
And then if they don't solve and
settle the matter honorably, then
we ought to win a military vic
tory with conventional weapons
and get out of Vietnam.
We shouldn't have gone there

by ourselves in the first place. I
hear one of the other candidates
say what I've said for a long
time — it is just as much to
Western Europe and non-Com
munist Asia's interests to be
there as it is for us to be there.
Q. How would you deal with
racial disorders such as rioting
and looting?
★ ★ ★
Humphrey: When a riot oc
curs, there must be rapid intro
duction of sufficient manpower
into the area for quick and
prompt action, including if nec
essary augmentation of the po
lice force by adequate numbers
military—National Guard or
regular Army. The emphasis
must be on additional men rath
er than on guns.
NLxon: Rioting in the first in
stance must be dealt with ... by
swift action at the beginning.
W need an early warning sys
tem in all the communities in the
event that a riot begins, a mas
sive display of adequate police
force. And in the event there
are not adequate local forces,
that means of course, supple
menting the local forces, on re
quest, with federal forces.
Wallace: "I think the police
ought to be allowed to enforce
the law. I think they have to be
allowed to use whatever meth
ods are necessary to prevent the
breakdown of law and order.

And then if it does break down,
they ought to be allowed to use
whatever measures are neces
sary to stop it.
★ ★ ★
Q. What would you consider
the most important issue of the
campaign?
Humphrey: Well, I would have
to put them together. I think it
it the reduction of tensions
abroad, and the reduction of ten
sions here at home. Or to put it
another way, to bring this war
in Vietnam to an end and to put
a halt to the arms race, and
here at home to try to find ways
and means of bringing into th.
mainstream of American life
people who have been somewhat
excluded . . .to try to minimize
and do away with the racial ten
sion and bitterness which is evi
dent in some areas of our na
tional life.
In other words, to unify our

..Nixon: First, I would never
have used more military force
and, particularly, I would never
have used bombing in a gradual
way. I would not have used it at
all until I used it diplomatically.
The application of force grad
ually is a mistake. We have
wasted our military advantage
by applying it gradually.
Second, the perhaps most fun
damental error the administra
tion has made in Vietnam is due
to its failure to understand the
character of the war. This is a
guerrilla war, which means that
it is a war for people rather
than territory. Therefore, your
primary emphasis must be on
developing programs which en
list the people of South Vietnam
economically, politically and mil
itarilv in their own defense.
Recently there has been some
movement, but until very re
cently we have not trained the
South Vietnamese. We have not
had an adequate program in

the countryside to develop the
political and other institutions so
that the South Vietnamese, once
we left, would be strong enough
to contain these guerrilla ac
tivities.
Wallace: If I were president
and peace talks hadn't concluded,
and we don't have an honorable
stettlement by the time of the
new administration, then I think
we ought to set some time limit
in the matter of negotiations.
And then if they don't solve and
settle the matter honorably, then
we ought to win a military vic
tory with conventional weapons
and get out of Vietnam.
We shouldn't have gone there

by ourselves in the first place. I
hear one of the other candidates
say what I've said for a long
time — it is just as much to
Western Europe and non-Com
munist Asia's interests to be
there as it is for us to be there.
Q. How would you deal with
racial disorders such as rioting
and looting?

Humphrey: When a riot oc
curs, there must be rapid intro
duction of sufficient manpower
into the area for quick and
prompt action, including if nec
essary augmentation of the po
lice force by adequate numbers
military—National Guard or
regular Army. The emphasis
must be on additional men rath
er than on guns.
NLxon: Rioting in the first in
stance must be dealt with ... by
swift action at the beginning.
W need an early warning sys
tem in all the communities in the
event that a riot begins, a mas
sive display of adequate police
force. And in the event there
are not adequate local forces,
that means of course, supple
menting the local forces, on re
quest, with federal forces.
Wallace: "I think the police
ought to be allowed to enforce
the law. I think they have to be
allowed to use whatever meth
ods are necessary to prevent the
breakdown of law and order.

And then if it does break down,
they ought to be allowed to use
whatever measures are neces
sary to stop it.

Q. What would you consider
the most important issue of the
campaign?
Humphrey: Well, I would have
to put them together. I think it
it the reduction of tensions
abroad, and the reduction of ten
sions here at home. Or to put it
another way, to bring this war
in Vietnam to an end and to put
a halt to the arms race, and
here at home to try to find ways
and means of bringing into th.
mainstream of American life
people who have been somewhat
excluded . . .to try to minimize
and do away with the racial ten
sion and bitterness which is evi
dent in some areas of our na
tional life.
In other words, to unify our
people as best we can. It is the
biggest task that any man is
ever going to have.
Nixon: The one that universal
ly disturbs people more than any
other, and this is true of black
Americans as well as white
Americans, is the question of the
safety of Americans in their
homes, or the streets of their
cities. In other words, it is the
law and order question.
The question of peace abroad,
of course, is predominant, be

cause if we don't get peace
abroad, it isn't going to make
any difference if we have the
best Social Security, medical
carecare, lowest taxes in history,
if we aren't around to enjoy it.
Therefore, people are predomi
nantly concerned with that.
But right now the subject
which 5s uppermost in their
minds is the fact that they see
crime going up nine times
as fast as population. This
key fact, I think, is getting
through when you have a poll
showing that 43 per cent of the
American people today are
afraid to walk in the streets of
their cities at night.
Wallace: I think the most im
portant issue involved it Viet
nam coupled with the breakdown
of law and order.
