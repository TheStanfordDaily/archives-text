# Tribe Hopes To Halt Skid Tomorrow
## 
### GARY CAVALLI 
Having left their Pacific-8 title
hopes in the smog of the Los
Angeles Coliseum, a disappoint
ed Stanford football team will
try to pick up the pieces tomor
row afternoon at 1:30 when
powerful Oregon State visits
Stanford Stadium.
Leading 14-0 and seemingly
en route to a long-awaited fourth
victory last Saturday, the In
dians somehow came out of the
Coliseum on the short end of a
20-17 tally. A controversial pass
interference call against Stan
ford, a costly fumble, and two
long UCLA passes turned the
game around.
But the Indians hurt them
selves most, as they had against
USC and Washington State, by
not taking advantage of scoring
opportunities. Five different
drives—reaching the 1, 2, 6, 7,
and 17 yard lines of UCLA—re
sulted in only three Stanford
points. So despite the fact that
the Indians outgained the oppo
sition for the sixth consecutive
time, their record fell to 3-2-1,
eliminating them from Rose
Bowl contention.
Oregon State's Beavers (4-2)
meanwhile, have been steadily
improving since the early part
of the season. Both of their loss
es have come in intersectional
games, so the Beavers still pos
sess a 2-0 ledger in Pac-8 play.
6-3, 235 pound full Bill En
yard, known as "Buffalo" to his
teammates but dubbed "Earth
quake" by the press, is the
workhorse of the Beavers' rush
oriented offense. Enyart has al
ready carried the ball 173 times
this season for 753 yards and 11
touchdowns. In an incredible

record-setting effort against
Utah, last yoar's All-Coast full
back lugged the pigskin 50 times
for 299 yards.
But Enyart is not the whole
show. Wingback Billy Main,
quarterback Steve Preece and
halfback Donnie Summers have
all gained over 200 yards rush

ing this year. In running yard
age the Beavers lead the con
ference by over 400 yards, hav
ing netted 1630 on the ground
to 1213 for (). J. Simpson and
company. Much of the credit
should go to the massive OSU
line which averages 236 pounds.
The OSU offense may be

slowed a little this week by the
loss of Summers, who severely
sprained an ankle last Saturday
and will be out for 10 days.
Stanford coach John Ralston
feels that Preece, very danger
ous on option plays, is the key
man in tomorrow's game rated
a tossup.
"Preece is the guy who beats
you," Ralston remarked early
this week. "He's the most under
rated quarterback in the Pacific
8. Enyard lulls you to sleep, they
control the ball, and then Preece
comes up with the big play."
A 6-1, 188 pounds senior who
is not an exceptionally good
thrower, Preece does not go to
the air too often. He has thrown
only 74 times this year, com
pleting 33 for 477 yards and 4
touchdowns. Three of the scor
ing passes have been caught by
Main.
Beaver Bobbles
The biggest problem for the
OSU offense so far in '68 has
been an inability to hold onto
the ball. The Beavers have fum
bled the ball 28 times and have
had 8 passes intercepted in only
six games.
Defensively, Coach Dee An
dros' crew has been steadily im
proving since the start of the
campaign. After giving up 35
points to Kentucky three weeks
ago, the OSU defense stiffened
in the last two games against
Arizona State and Washington
State, yielding only 9 points to
the high-scoring Sun Devils and

8 to the hard-nosed Cougars.
"Their defense is really com
ing along," Ralston commented.
"They've got real good defen
sive ends (Mike Foote and Ter
ry Belcher) and they have an
All American guard in John
Marquess. Marquess, who snared
six passes for 56 yards and a TD
last week in his first game as a
split end, is currently in Mexico
playing on the United States
baseball team in the Interna
tional Baseball Tournament.
Sandstrom. The secondary is
very good—they're leading the
league in pass defense."
Tenacious Pa.ss Defense
OSU has yielded only 120.2
yards per game passing and has
allowed only three touchdowns
through the air so far this sea
son. Halfback Charlie Olds, with
six interceptions, and safety
Larry Rich, with four, are the
leading thiefs in the Beaver sec
ondary.
The Indians will counter with
the league's top passing attack,
engineered by sophomore quar
terback Jim Plunkett. The Tribe
is averaging 271 aerial yards per
game, with Plunkett responsible
for 89 completions, 1437 yards
and 12 touchdowns.
Plunkett's top receiver, flanker
Gene Washington, moved into a
comfortable lead for the Pac-8
pass-catching title with 13 re
ceptions last week in LA. He
now has 41 catches, with Wayne
Stewart of Cal running second
with 33.

Tight end Bob Moore, both
ered by a pulled hamstring mus
cle last Saturday, "will be at full
strength" tomorrow, according
to Ralston.
Stanford will be without the
services of split end-safety Mark
Cass Gets Nod
Ralston indicated that senior
Bruce Cass would get the start
ing nod at split end, backed up
by sophomores Demea Washing
ton and Jack Schultz, while
sophomore quarterback Don
Bunce will take Marquess' place
as the holder on Stanford's ex
tra-point and field goal attempts.
The Tribe mentor announced
that John Haygood, who did an
excellent job in the UCLA game,
will start at defensive end and
alternate with Tom Weingartner
tomorrow. Haygood also proved
a pleasant surprise on kickofTs
last week, averaging 55 yards a
boot.

CAT BALLOU ON THE PROWL—Tribe halfback Bubba Brown
(21) tri«*s the right side in the first quarter of the Stanford-UCLA
gani«>, but Bruin linebacker Mike Ballon (57) moves up to hold him
to a short gain. Ballon was voted "Lineman of The Game"; Brown
has gained 322 yards in his last three games. i.
Having left their Pacific-8 title
hopes in the smog of the Los
Angeles Coliseum, a disappoint
ed Stanford football team will
try to pick up the pieces tomor
row afternoon at 1:30 when
powerful Oregon State visits
Stanford Stadium.
Leading 14-0 and seemingly
en route to a long-awaited fourth
victory last Saturday, the In
dians somehow came out of the
Coliseum on the short end of a
20-17 tally. A controversial pass
interference call against Stan
ford, a costly fumble, and two
long UCLA passes turned the
game around.
But the Indians hurt them
selves most, as they had against
USC and Washington State, by
not taking advantage of scoring
opportunities. Five different
drives—reaching the 1, 2, 6, 7,
and 17 yard lines of UCLA—re
sulted in only three Stanford
points. So despite the fact that
the Indians outgained the oppo
sition for the sixth consecutive
time, their record fell to 3-2-1,
eliminating them from Rose
Bowl contention.
Oregon State's Beavers (4-2)
meanwhile, have been steadily
improving since the early part
of the season. Both of their loss
es have come in intersectional
games, so the Beavers still pos
sess a 2-0 ledger in Pac-8 play.
6-3, 235 pound full Bill En
yard, known as "Buffalo" to his
teammates but dubbed "Earth
quake" by the press, is the
workhorse of the Beavers' rush
oriented offense. Enyart has al
ready carried the ball 173 times
this season for 753 yards and 11
touchdowns. In an incredible

record-setting effort against
Utah, last yoar's All-Coast full
back lugged the pigskin 50 times
for 299 yards.
But Enyart is not the whole
show. Wingback Billy Main,
quarterback Steve Preece and
halfback Donnie Summers have
all gained over 200 yards rush

ing this year. In running yard
age the Beavers lead the con
ference by over 400 yards, hav
ing netted 1630 on the ground
to 1213 for (). J. Simpson and
company. Much of the credit
should go to the massive OSU
line which averages 236 pounds.
The OSU offense may be

slowed a little this week by the
loss of Summers, who severely
sprained an ankle last Saturday
and will be out for 10 days.
Stanford coach John Ralston
feels that Preece, very danger
ous on option plays, is the key
man in tomorrow's game rated
a tossup.
"Preece is the guy who beats
you," Ralston remarked early
this week. "He's the most under
rated quarterback in the Pacific
8. Enyard lulls you to sleep, they
control the ball, and then Preece
comes up with the big play."
A 6-1, 188 pounds senior who
is not an exceptionally good
thrower, Preece does not go to
the air too often. He has thrown
only 74 times this year, com
pleting 33 for 477 yards and 4
touchdowns. Three of the scor
ing passes have been caught by
Main.
Beaver Bobbles
The biggest problem for the
OSU offense so far in '68 has
been an inability to hold onto
the ball. The Beavers have fum
bled the ball 28 times and have
had 8 passes intercepted in only
six games.
Defensively, Coach Dee An
dros' crew has been steadily im
proving since the start of the
campaign. After giving up 35
points to Kentucky three weeks
ago, the OSU defense stiffened
in the last two games against
Arizona State and Washington
State, yielding only 9 points to
the high-scoring Sun Devils and

8 to the hard-nosed Cougars.
"Their defense is really com
ing along," Ralston commented.
"They've got real good defen
sive ends (Mike Foote and Ter
ry Belcher) and they have an
All American guard in John
Marquess. Marquess, who snared
six passes for 56 yards and a TD
last week in his first game as a
split end, is currently in Mexico
playing on the United States
baseball team in the Interna
tional Baseball Tournament.
Sandstrom. The secondary is
very good—they're leading the
league in pass defense."
Tenacious Pa.ss Defense
OSU has yielded only 120.2
yards per game passing and has
allowed only three touchdowns
through the air so far this sea
son. Halfback Charlie Olds, with
six interceptions, and safety
Larry Rich, with four, are the
leading thiefs in the Beaver sec
ondary.
The Indians will counter with
the league's top passing attack,
engineered by sophomore quar
terback Jim Plunkett. The Tribe
is averaging 271 aerial yards per
game, with Plunkett responsible
for 89 completions, 1437 yards
and 12 touchdowns.
Plunkett's top receiver, flanker
Gene Washington, moved into a
comfortable lead for the Pac-8
pass-catching title with 13 re
ceptions last week in LA. He
now has 41 catches, with Wayne

Tenacious Pa.ss Defense
OSU has yielded only 120.2
yards per game passing and has
allowed only three touchdowns
through the air so far this sea
son. Halfback Charlie Olds, with
six interceptions, and safety
Larry Rich, with four, are the
leading thiefs in the Beaver sec
ondary.
The Indians will counter with
the league's top passing attack,
engineered by sophomore quar
terback Jim Plunkett. The Tribe
is averaging 271 aerial yards per
game, with Plunkett responsible
for 89 completions, 1437 yards
and 12 touchdowns.
Plunkett's top receiver, flanker
Gene Washington, moved into a
comfortable lead for the Pac-8
pass-catching title with 13 re
ceptions last week in LA. He
now has 41 catches, with Wayne
Stewart of Cal running second
with 33.

Tight end Bob Moore, both
ered by a pulled hamstring mus

strength" tomorrow, according
to Ralston.

Ralston indicated that senior

sophomore quarterback Don
Bunce will take Marquess' place
as the holder on Stanford's ex

The Tribe mentor announced

CAT BALLOU ON THE PROWL—Tribe halfback Bubba Brown
(21) tri«*s the right side in the first quarter of the Stanford-UCLA
gani«>, but Bruin linebacker Mike Ballon (57) moves up to hold him
to a short gain. Ballon was voted "Lineman of The Game"; Brown
has gained 322 yards in his last three games. i.
Having left their Pacific-8 title
hopes in the smog of the Los
Angeles Coliseum, a disappoint
ed Stanford football team will
try to pick up the pieces tomor
row afternoon at 1:30 when
powerful Oregon State visits
Stanford Stadium.
Leading 14-0 and seemingly
en route to a long-awaited fourth
victory last Saturday, the In
dians somehow came out of the
Coliseum on the short end of a
20-17 tally. A controversial pass
interference call against Stan
ford, a costly fumble, and two
long UCLA passes turned the
game around.
But the Indians hurt them
selves most, as they had against
USC and Washington State, by
not taking advantage of scoring
opportunities. Five different
drives—reaching the 1, 2, 6, 7,
and 17 yard lines of UCLA—re
sulted in only three Stanford
points. So despite the fact that
the Indians outgained the oppo
sition for the sixth consecutive
time, their record fell to 3-2-1,
eliminating them from Rose
Bowl contention.
Oregon State's Beavers (4-2)
meanwhile, have been steadily
improving since the early part
of the season. Both of their loss
es have come in intersectional
games, so the Beavers still pos
sess a 2-0 ledger in Pac-8 play.
6-3, 235 pound full Bill En
yard, known as "Buffalo" to his
teammates but dubbed "Earth
quake" by the press, is the
workhorse of the Beavers' rush
oriented offense. Enyart has al
ready carried the ball 173 times
this season for 753 yards and 11
touchdowns. In an incredible

record-setting effort against
Utah, last yoar's All-Coast full
back lugged the pigskin 50 times
for 299 yards.
But Enyart is not the whole
show. Wingback Billy Main,
quarterback Steve Preece and
halfback Donnie Summers have
all gained over 200 yards rush

ing this year. In running yard
age the Beavers lead the con
ference by over 400 yards, hav
ing netted 1630 on the ground
to 1213 for (). J. Simpson and
company. Much of the credit
should go to the massive OSU
line which averages 236 pounds.
The OSU offense may be

slowed a little this week by the
loss of Summers, who severely
sprained an ankle last Saturday
and will be out for 10 days.
Stanford coach John Ralston
feels that Preece, very danger
ous on option plays, is the key
man in tomorrow's game rated
a tossup.
"Preece is the guy who beats
you," Ralston remarked early
this week. "He's the most under
rated quarterback in the Pacific
8. Enyard lulls you to sleep, they
control the ball, and then Preece
comes up with the big play."
A 6-1, 188 pounds senior who
is not an exceptionally good
thrower, Preece does not go to
the air too often. He has thrown
only 74 times this year, com
pleting 33 for 477 yards and 4
touchdowns. Three of the scor
ing passes have been caught by
Main.
Beaver Bobbles
The biggest problem for the
OSU offense so far in '68 has
been an inability to hold onto
the ball. The Beavers have fum
bled the ball 28 times and have
had 8 passes intercepted in only
six games.
Defensively, Coach Dee An
dros' crew has been steadily im
proving since the start of the
campaign. After giving up 35
points to Kentucky three weeks
ago, the OSU defense stiffened
in the last two games against
Arizona State and Washington
State, yielding only 9 points to
the high-scoring Sun Devils and

8 to the hard-nosed Cougars.

ous on option plays, is the key
man in tomorrow's game rated
a tossup.
"Preece is the guy who beats
you," Ralston remarked early
this week. "He's the most under
rated quarterback in the Pacific
8. Enyard lulls you to sleep, they
control the ball, and then Preece
comes up with the big play."
A 6-1, 188 pounds senior who
is not an exceptionally good
thrower, Preece does not go to
the air too often. He has thrown
only 74 times this year, com
pleting 33 for 477 yards and 4
touchdowns. Three of the scor
ing passes have been caught by
Main.
Beaver Bobbles
The biggest problem for the
OSU offense so far in '68 has
been an inability to hold onto
the ball. The Beavers have fum
bled the ball 28 times and have
had 8 passes intercepted in only
six games.
Defensively, Coach Dee An
dros' crew has been steadily im
proving since the start of the
campaign. After giving up 35
points to Kentucky three weeks
ago, the OSU defense stiffened
in the last two games against
Arizona State and Washington
State, yielding only 9 points to
the high-scoring Sun Devils and

8 to the hard-nosed Cougars.
"Their defense is really com
ing along," Ralston commented.
"They've got real good defen
sive ends (Mike Foote and Ter
ry Belcher) and they have an
All American guard in John
Marquess. Marquess, who snared
six passes for 56 yards and a TD
last week in his first game as a
split end, is currently in Mexico
playing on the United States
baseball team in the Interna
tional Baseball Tournament.
Sandstrom. The secondary is
very good—they're leading the
league in pass defense."
Tenacious Pa.ss Defense
OSU has yielded only 120.2
yards per game passing and has
allowed only three touchdowns
through the air so far this sea
son. Halfback Charlie Olds, with
six interceptions, and safety
Larry Rich, with four, are the
leading thiefs in the Beaver sec
ondary.
The Indians will counter with
the league's top passing attack,
engineered by sophomore quar
terback Jim Plunkett. The Tribe
is averaging 271 aerial yards per
game, with Plunkett responsible
for 89 completions, 1437 yards
and 12 touchdowns.
Plunkett's top receiver, flanker
Gene Washington, moved into a
comfortable lead for the Pac-8
pass-catching title with 13 re
ceptions last week in LA. He
now has 41 catches, with Wayne
Stewart of Cal running second
with 33.

Tight end Bob Moore, both
ered by a pulled hamstring mus
cle last Saturday, "will be at full
strength" tomorrow, according
to Ralston.
Stanford will be without the
services of split end-safety Mark
Cass Gets Nod
Ralston indicated that senior
Bruce Cass would get the start
ing nod at split end, backed up
by sophomores Demea Washing
ton and Jack Schultz, while
sophomore quarterback Don
Bunce will take Marquess' place
as the holder on Stanford's ex
tra-point and field goal attempts.
The Tribe mentor announced
that John Haygood, who did an
excellent job in the UCLA game,
will start at defensive end and
alternate with Tom Weingartner
tomorrow. Haygood also proved
a pleasant surprise on kickofTs
last week, averaging 55 yards a
boot.
