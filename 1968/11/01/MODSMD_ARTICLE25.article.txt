# 'Little' Big Game Tomorrow
## Ailing Papooses Host Cal 
### BOB FEDUNIAK 
Their hopes for an undefeated
season having been crushed by
UCLA, Coach Jim Troppman's
ifrosh footballers will try to
preserve their chance for a win
ning campaign when they host
the California frosh in the little-
Big Game Saturday morning at
10:00 A.M.
Last weekend in Los Angeles,
the Papooses ran into what
Troppman called a "buzz saw,"
as the Brubabes held the strong

Indian runners to minus-8 yards
on the ground enroute to a 34-6
victory.
Running backs Hilary Shock
ley and Jackie Brown were able
to muster only 84 yards between
them, while porous pass pro
tection led to 92 yards lost at
tempting to pass. Only the arm
of QB Ted Bleymaier, filling
in for injured Miles Moore, res
cued the Stanford offense from
total impotence.
Bleymaier completed 15 of 25
attempts for 161 yards and the
only Papoose TD, after Moore
suffered a leg injury on the
opening play. The score came in
the second quarter on a 10-yard
pass to split end Dave Magruder.
Seimon Lost
In addition to the score, Stan
ford suffered a number of physi
cal injuries, the most serious
being linebacker and co-captain
Jeff Siemon's torn hamstring
muscle.Siemon underwent sur
gery earlier this week and will
be lost for the season.
Troppman is undecided as to
whether Moore of Bleymaier
will get the starting call Satur
day. Both will probably see
some action. But Troppman
feels that the outcome will rest
on what he calls "character"—
the team's ability to bounce
back from defeat with an all
out effort.
Both teams will enter the con
test with identical 1-1 records,
with both defeats having been
at the hands of UCLA. The
game should be evenly matched
and hard-fought, with both tra
ditional rivalry and the fear of
a loosing record resting on the
shoulders of both teams.

FROSH PHANTOM — Papoose fullback Hilary Shockley cuts
through a hole off right tackle for a substantial gain in the Stan
ford-USC game, during which he rambled for 131 yards in 23 car
ries. Last week Shockley was held in check at UCLA, as Stanford
was pumelled 34-6 by the powerful Brubabes.
