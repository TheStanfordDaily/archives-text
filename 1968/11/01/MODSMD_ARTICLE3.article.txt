# Candidate David Ransom
## 
### 
(EDITOR'S NOTE: David Ran
som is the Peace and Freedom
Party's candidate for the Elev
enth Congressional district seat
now held by Pete McCloskey.
Interviews with Congressman
>IcCloskey and his Democratic
opponent, Urban Whitaker, ap
peared Wednesday. This inter
view was prepared by James
I'erloff.)

The Daily: Why are you run
ning for Congress, given that
you may have almost no chance
to win?
David Ransom: The campaign
gives me a platform to discuss
New Left politics and policies.
A second reason is that we are
using the campaign as a way
of talking about what we are
doing and to get people involved
in what we are doing. That
really hasn't come to pass
though. I think we would have
done better if we had run on
a more local platform, running
candidates for state assembly
or senate.
The Daily: What is the major
issue in the campaign?
Ransom: I think the major
issue is corporate capitalism.
This can be subdivided into
three major areas: American
imperialism, racism and higher
taxes,
I think there is no question
but that the economic dynamics
of corporate capitalism has got
ten us involved in Vietnam and
the rest of the Third World in
imperialist ways, and that this
has created the contradiction in
our own county between the
need for low cost housing, which
has not been met, the need for

higher education, which can not
be met any more by small tax
payers, and the need for things
like medical care.
There is a contradiction be
tween these things and the
great wealth of the county.
There is a tremendous amount
of government spending in the
county but it is for war indus
tries rather than for people's
needs.
The Daily: Where do you
stand on gun control?
Ransom: Across the board
gun control isn't going to hap
pen, even though in my view
this is the ideal situation. We
should disarm police.
The Daily: What is the pur
pose of the Peace and Freedom
Party?
Ransom: The Peace and Free
dom Party is merely the elec
toral ai m of the Peace and Free
dom movement, which is not
solely or even primarily con
cerned with electoral politics.
We are concerned that corpor
ate capitalism must be over
thrown. The only system under
which there can be democracy is
socialism.
I don't see how you can have
a democratic country in which
great concentrations of power

are not responsible formally to
the people. Presently corporate
capitalism is a great concen
tration of power which is
neither responsible nor respon
sive to the people. I don't see
how in the present state of tech
nology and media you could
have a democratic election, be
cause money means so much in
elections. Look at the hundreds
of thousands of dollars that
went into the primary contest
between McCloskey and Shirley
Temple Black. I can spend only
$500. This is fairly big money
McCloskey spent: if wealth is
concentrated you can't even
have a democratic election.
The Daily: Where do you
stand on strict enforcement of
the laws?

Ransom: Not only strict law
enforcement, but the laws them
selves are a barrier to creating
a human society. In America
the increasing economic and
political power of the corporate
elite forces people into lives
about which they have little say.
The Daily: What do you think
about the draft?
Ransom: To combat repressive
violence at home and abroad and
allow lor a free flow of change,
conscription must be abolished
altogether. The nation is split
into three or four parties of dis
agreement. Conscription serves
only those in power and is qual
itatively more authoritian than
conscription in a society at peace
with itself and agreed on its
eoals.
