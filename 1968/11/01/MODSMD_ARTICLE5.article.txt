# Campus Reaction: Relief
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
If there was one feeling pre
vading the Stanford campus last
night after President Johnson's
statement, it was one of relief—
—relief that the rumors of the
past few weeks about the Paris
peace talks were indeed true.
Underneath it all, there was
the ever present lack of emo
tion. It seemed to be Halloween
as usual. A Wilbur tutor ascrib
ed it more to the "traditional
college cynicism."
Thirty freshmen crowded
around the television in the
Trancos faculty resident's house,

but only to "see what it was all
about," as one freshman ex
plained it.
President Johnson may have
convinced a lot of Stanford stu
donts, faculty, and administra
tors that he is sincerely search
ing for the end to the Vietnam
war. But the immediateness to
the election did little to dispel
notions of Johnson as a crafty
politician.
"The reactions are twofold."
explained one student. First, we
are glad that the bombing is
stopped. Second, we recognize it
as an obvious political move."
Napier 'Elated'
Dean of the Chapel Davie
Napier said that he was "elated"
that Johnson had finally taken
this step. "If it is a step in the
direction of peace, ultimate
peace, then I am all for it,"he
said.
Political Science Prof. Charles
Drekmeier said that "it's about
time" that Johnson made such
an announcement. He added, "It
should have been three years
ago."
One Nixon supporter insisted

that it will only "accelerate the
trend already under way of
some Wallace voters to Hum
phrey and the Democratic left
to Humphrey."
No Nixon Switch
This same student insisted
that Nixon's support, which re
mained fairly steady through
most of the campaign, would not
switch. "But it will make it a
closer race," he added.
Prof. Robert McAfee Brown
called the action "another cru
cial step towards peace "and a
chance to turn to the long ne
glected priorities, such as urban
blight."
Janet Coson, a research asso
ciate at Hoover Institution
studying the Vietnamese situa
tion, pointed out that North
Vietnamese situation, pointed
out that North Vietnam from
early 1967 has "definitely wanted
to use the election year to
change Vietnam policy."
"The North Vietnamese re
jected the idea that there was
a new Humphrey who could car
ry out a new policy," Miss Coson
said.
