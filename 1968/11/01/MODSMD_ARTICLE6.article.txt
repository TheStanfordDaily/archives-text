# Students, Faculty Appointed To Committee Studying SRI
## 
### 
Five faculty members and five
students have been appointed to
the 12-man ad hoc Presidential
committee to study
between Stanford and SRI, it
was learned yesterday.
The five student members,
nominated by student body pres
ident Denis Hayes, are Anne C.
Bauer, Victor Hori, Harry Cleav
er, Nick Falk, and Pat Mc-
Mahon.
Faculty nominees, appointed
by the Committee on Commit
tees of the Academic Council, in
clude: Barton J. Bernstein, asso
ciate professor of history; Wil
liam K. LinviP. professor of
engineering economic systems
and of electrical engineering;
David S. Nivison, professor of
Chinese and of philosophy; Ken
neth F. Scott, associate profes
sor of law; and Ezra Solomon,
the Dean Witter professor of
finance in the Graduate School
of Business.
The two remaining members,
whose "names have not been
made public, have been appoint
ed by Acting President Robert
J. Glaser.
According to professor G. L.
Bach of the Business School,
chairman of the Committee on
Committees, the faculty nomina
tions were designed to provide
a range in perspectives regard
ing the substance of the review,
an awareness of the concept of
contact research, awareness of
legal implications of the study,
and familiarity with the broad
areas of SRI activity.
At their regular meeting
Thursday (Oct. 31), the Senate
of the Academic Council dis
cussed the study briefly while
meeting as a committee of the
whole, but adopted no motions.
Cl 5 Changes
The faculty representatives
approved a recommendation
from the Committee on Com
mittees calling for a shift in
composition of the Committee
of Fifteen to include six faculty,
six students, and three adminis

trators. Previously, this group
was evenly divided among these
three constituencies.
They also endorsed a proced
ural change permitting the
Committee of Fifteen to add
agenda items by majority vote,
and referred a recommendation
that the committee hold open
hearings to faculty representa
tives on the group.
All three changes were orig
inated by the Committee of Fif
teen last spring. Formed in
September, 1965, the commit
tee's major concern last year
was the development of new ju
dicial procedures.
After hearing a report from
Prof. Robert Walker, chairman
of the Committee on General
Studies, the faculty representa
tives overwhelmingly voted to
eliminate a general studies re
quirement that students who
have not taken biology or physi
cal science in high school must
complete an approved course
sequence in these fields at Stan
ford. This change refers only to
high school courses and does not

diminish the University's pres
ent science requirements.
Ami More Committees
They also received a report
from the Committee on Com
mittees nominating four faculty
each to new ad hoc Presidential
committees on parking regula
tions and low cost housing. >
Those nominated to the park
ing regulatins group were:
Hugo A. DiGiulio, assistant pro
fessor of industrial engineering;
Grayton E. Germane, 1907 Foun
dation professor of logistics in
the Graduate School of Busi
ness; Rbert M. Polhemus, asso
ciate professor of English; and
Douglas A. Skoog, professor of
chemistry.
Thse nominated to the com
mittee to study possible Uni
versity sponsorship of low cost
housing on Stanford land were:
Jerome A. Feldman, assistant
prfessor of computer science;
of education and director of the
School Planning Laboratory;
Victor K. Thompson, professor
of architecture; and Chapman

Young 111, assistant professor
of geophysics.
A memorandum concerning
cost of living increases and the
tuition benefit plan was discus
sed with Prof. Herman Chernoff,
professor of statistics, during
"For the Good of the Univers
ity."
In his memorandum, Prof.
Chernoff said: "From the little
informatin available to me, it
seems natural to conjecture that
an attitude of poverty and re
straint has kept (faculty) sal
aries lower than they should be.
James D. MacConnell, professor
He suggested appointing a
committee to investigate a 10
per cent cost-of-living salary in
crease for the faculty and a
separate group to study a new
tuition benefit plan for faculty
families.
Prof. Leonard Schiff, chair
man of the Senate, noted that
Kenneth M. Cuthbertson, vice
president for finance, was sched
uled to discuss 1969-70 budget
objectives with the Senate and
answer questions at its
meeting Nov. 14.
