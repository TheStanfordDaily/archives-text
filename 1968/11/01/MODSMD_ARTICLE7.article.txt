### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€”
Chancellor Glenn S. Dumke of
the State Colleges ordered
Thursday that Black Panther
George Murray be suspended
as a teacher and graduate stu
dent at San Francisco State Col
lege.
But the college president re
fused. and called the order "un
precedented."
The order, said President Ro
bert S. Smith, is "contrary to
strong representations by com-

munity leaders in San Fran
cisco and against recommenda
tions my staff and I made."
Smith said he was delaying
action.
Murray, who teaches two En
glish courses, on Monday urged
Negro students to carry arms
"to protect themselves against
racists."
Alioto Takes Action
In addition to Dumke's sus
pension order, this campus
speech by Murray prompted
Mayor Joseph Alioto to tell his
police chief to arrest and pro
secute anyone who follows the
23-year-old Black Panther's ad
vice.
"Persons who bring firearms
on a state college campus are
guilty of a felony," Mayor Ali
oto wrote Police Chief Thomas
J. Cahill.
"The California Penal Code
is clear and firm in its prohibi
tion against guns on campus.
Section ITIC, Subdivision 2, of
Penal Code flatly states that
anyone who brings or possesses
a firearm and ammunition on
the grounds of a state college
is guilty of a felony and I ex
pect that law to be rigidly en
forced."
President Smith said he sent
a telegram to Chancellor Dum
ke late Thursday after confer
ring "with administrative and
faculty advisers and community
leadership." In the wire he ask
ed for a meeting here Friday
with Dumke, the chairman of
the board of trustees and the
general counsel of the California
state colleges.
Meeting A 'Review'
The meeting, Smith's tele
gram added, would be to "allow
the review of your order
to take place in the context
of the local situation with the
participation of both campus
and community officials who will
bear the impact of this action."
Chancellor Dumke was in Chi
cago Thursday night and un
available for comment on

Smith's suggestion of a Friday
meeting.
Earlier Mayor Alioto had in
terceded in Murray's behalf aft
er Dumke's order that Murray
be suspended pending the bring
ing of unspecified charges and
a hearing. The mayor conferred
Wednesday with Smith, U.S.
Atty. Cecil Poole, Atty. Gen.
Thomas C. Lynch and Dist.
Atty. John Jay Ferdon.
At that conference the mayor
urged action against Murray be
delayed until it was determined
whether the exhortation to car
ry guns was in itself a law vio
lation. Alioto expressed concern
precipitant action might bring
violence at a time when police
had their hands full because of
Halloween.
Refused Request
Last month Smith refused a
request from college trustees to
assign Murray to nonteaching
duties. The college president
said any reassignment without
due process of law would de
prive Murray of his rights.
At their October meeting, the
trustees took no further action
against Murray. Chairman The
odore Meriam of Chico asked
the trustees to await results of
an investigation of Murray be
ing conducted by the school's
administration and faculty.
Gov. Reagan and Max Raf
ferty, state superintendent of
public instruction, have advo
cated Murray's dismissal.
Rafferty, now campaigning as
a Republican for U.S. Senator,
told a San Francisco audience
Wednesday t hat Murray had
voiced aloud the hope someone
would kill Rafferty.
Rafferty told his audience he
would work with college trus
tees "to get the bum kicked
out."
Last year Murray as a Black
Student Union militant, partici
pated in an attack on the cam
pus newspaper editor. Murray
was suspended and later rein
stated.
