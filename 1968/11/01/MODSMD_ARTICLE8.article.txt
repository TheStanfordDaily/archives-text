# Studio Watts Head Talks On Art
## 
### CHARLIE JONAS 
The recognition of every in
dividual's basic need for self
awareness through self-explora
tion is the principle concept be
hind Studio Watts School for the
Arts, according to its director.
"What we are trying to do,"
says Director James M. Wood,
"is bring art education back into
its proper relationship with oth
er fields of education. Art educa
tion is not used today as a
means to stimulate interest in
other areas of life.
"We are using art as a means
of getting people to understand
who they are, where they are,
and where they are going; that
is, to help them find themselves
in their total environment."
Studio Watts apprentices work
intensively for three years in ei
ther music, dance, drama, writ
ing, or design. But each appren
tice is encouraged to explore
some of those areas outside his
principle field.
Anne Halprin, of the San
Francisco-based Dancer's Work
shop, is presently working with
fifteen students on the creation
of a dance concert for the Los-
Angeles Festival of the Perform
ing Arts. The theme of the
dance has developed as the re
hearsals progress.
"It's a total concept idea," ex
plains Woods. "Everything is go
ing on. The theme developed so
far is Man's flight; his running
to or from something."
Most graduates of Studio
Watts do not go into fields re
lated to their studies. Rather,
they apply to different fields
that which they have learned
about themselves through artis
tic self-examination.
To aid those students who
wish to further explore the arts,
Studio Watts has its Tutor Arts
Program. In the program, stu
dents study with qualified pro
fessional people in several uni
versities.
Last summer, two students
studied at Stanford, with one at
both Harvard and UCLA. Thirty
slots are available next summer.
Twelve of those openings are at
Stanford or in San Francisco.
"In the program," explains
Woods, "we take individuals who
want to go on and place them
with a qualified professional
during the summer. The student
lives in the home of the artist

and is with him every day of the
summer."
Not only does the student
learn a great deal from the
teacher-artist by attending his
classes, but also the teacher can,
by continuous contact with the
student, better understand and
improve his teaching methods.
The arrangement is character
ized by Woods as a "constant
improvement structure."
The theory of master-appren
tice is thus put to use as it is in
Studio Watts classes. Learning
and teaching become a two-way
process.
"Initiative is the keynote in
the master-apprentice structure.
If one person is interested in
what another is doing, the first
hurdle is jumped. There is a
basis for meaningful dialogue,"
he said.
"You transcend racism in this
situation," continues Woods.
"Imbedded in the relationship is
the desire to do a particular
thing better." There is no place
for irrational hostilities, accord
ing to Woods.
Financial support comes pri
marily from private sources.
Woods indicated that "we don't
want government support under
the poverty program. We are
not a poverty program." Indeed,
Studio Watts is an enrichment
program in the deepest humanis
tic sense of the word.
Woods feels that government
tends to smother well thought
out plans with its paternal atti
tude and aged institutions. "Now
is the time to look inside our
selves and develop new institu
tions that will answer the needs
of today. That's what 'Black
Girl' is all about."
"Stanford was the first institu
tion to recognize that Studio
Watts was a new concept, and
accepted it as such," added
Woods. The Studio Watts De
velopment Board, which is plan
ning financial expansion for the
next ten years, is headed by fi
Stanford graduate, John Pike.
The Ultimate goal of Woods
and the Studio Watts people is
the expansion of the program to
every major ghetto area in the
country. The studio would bear
the name of its ghetto location.
To prove that the programs of
Studio Watts are exportable,
Studio Fillmore is being orga
nized.
