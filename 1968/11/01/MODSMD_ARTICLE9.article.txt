# Summer Program
## Stanford Aids Its Workers 
### DENNIS PERLUSS 
The summer program design
ed to supplement and enrich the
job experience gained by young
people working at Stanford
through the Youth Opportun
ities faced problems from its
very inception. Nevertheless, the
sessions provided invaluable ex
perience for those involved in
leading the program while of
fering something worthwhile to
those students who attended.
Beginning in early July and
lasting for about six weeks, ap
proximately 30 to 35 young peo
ple from low-income, minority
families attended three lectures
a week as a cultural-academic
supplement to their work at the
University.
The enrichment program
sprang from a much more am
bitious project for a full-time
educational program at Stan
ford using the dormitory facil
ities on campus and the volun
teer services of Stanford per
sonnel.
Lack Of Funds
A nearly complete lack of
funds meant that the progran
had to be drastiaclly revised. It
consisted primarily of lectures
by people such as Professors
Kaplan and Wald of the Stan
ford Law School on topics
ranging from minority relation
ships with people in positions of
authority to consumer rights
and responsibilities. Cultural
sessions included poetry read
ings and a jazz performance.
The shortage of money also
meant that to exist at all the
program had to work with
Youth Opportunities people.

This created a problem that
plagued the program for the en
tire summer.
Despite the fact that letters
were distributed explaining the
entirely voluntary nature of the
enrichment program, the various
work supervisors at Stanford
received requests to release
their young employees for three
one hour sessions a week, gen
erally assumed that the pro
gram was both required and
actually run by the Youth Op
portunities office.
Misunderstanding
This misunderstanding caus
ed some resentment among the
supervisors, who were uncertain
as to whether iheir employees
should be paid for this time and
as to whether or not the time
actually had to be given. As con
ceived (and explained to super
visors on several occasions) the
program was totally separate
from Youth Opportunities. It
merely involved the same under
privileged youngsters.
Lack of funds also meant that
no program director or paid staff
could be employed to guide the
program. Coupled with the fact
that the black Stanford students
most involved with the planning
of the enrichment program, Fred
Barry and Frank Satterwhite,
found their time increasingly
committed to a variety of other
projects, this meant that most
of the actual running of the pro
gram was carried on by white
volunteers.
Bruce Bush, Chris Hoover,
Warren Lyons, and Norton
Tooby constituted \rlwt < ;.
be called an executive board to

administer the enrichment ses
sions. Satterwhite considers the
work done by these four and
other white students, many from
the law school, as "the kind of
commitment that too few white
people are willing to make to
assist blacks."
White Domination
The apparent domination of
the program by white students,
however, added to the problems
to be faced. The black students
who were initially involved in
setting up the program and who
handled some of the sessions
were members of the Black Stu
dents Union (BSU), but this was
not a BSU project. Consequently
many of the young people who
attended the sessions felt con
fronted with the standard lib
eral concept of whites doing for
instead of with blacks.
Both the white and black stu
dents in charge of the program
agree that much of the teacher
learner problem could have been
avoided with earlier planning.
Concrete ideas for the sessions
iiid not begin to take shape un
<il early June; at that late date
'he young people who were to
participate in the program
Oi Id not be included in the
planning.
Earlier planning would have
also allowed the development of
informal talk situations between
the teachers and the young
workers. Such sessions would
have given the young blacks and
Mexican-Americans an oppor
tunity for meaningful participa
tion and exchange of ideas, rath
er than having to be continually
talked to.

Earlier planning would have

The summer program design
ed to supplement and enrich the
job experience gained by young
people working at Stanford
through the Youth Opportun

sessions provided invaluable ex

leading the program while of
fering something worthwhile to
those students who attended.
Beginning in early July and
lasting for about six weeks, ap
proximately 30 to 35 young peo

families attended three lectures
a week as a cultural-academic
supplement to their work at the
University.
The enrichment program
sprang from a much more am
bitious project for a full-time
educational program at Stan
ford using the dormitory facil
ities on campus and the volun

Lack Of Funds
A nearly complete lack of
funds meant that the progran
had to be drastiaclly revised. It
consisted primarily of lectures
by people such as Professors
Kaplan and Wald of the Stan
ford Law School on topics
ranging from minority relation
ships with people in positions of
authority to consumer rights
and responsibilities. Cultural
sessions included poetry read
ings and a jazz performance.
The shortage of money also
meant that to exist at all the
program had to work with
Youth Opportunities people.

This created a problem that
plagued the program for the en
tire summer.
Despite the fact that letters
were distributed explaining the
entirely voluntary nature of the
enrichment program, the various
work supervisors at Stanford
received requests to release
their young employees for three
one hour sessions a week, gen
erally assumed that the pro
gram was both required and
actually run by the Youth Op
portunities office.
Misunderstanding
This misunderstanding caus
ed some resentment among the
supervisors, who were uncertain
as to whether iheir employees
should be paid for this time and
as to whether or not the time
actually had to be given. As con
ceived (and explained to super
visors on several occasions) the
program was totally separate
from Youth Opportunities. It
merely involved the same under
privileged youngsters.
Lack of funds also meant that
no program director or paid staff
could be employed to guide the
program. Coupled with the fact
that the black Stanford students
most involved with the planning
of the enrichment program, Fred
Barry and Frank Satterwhite,
found their time increasingly
committed to a variety of other
projects, this meant that most
of the actual running of the pro
gram was carried on by white
volunteers.

The apparent domination of
the program by white students,
