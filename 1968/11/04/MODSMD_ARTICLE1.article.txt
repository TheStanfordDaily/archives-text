# Election Protests: Wake, Skits, Film
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
Two full days of student pro
test culminating with what is
billed as an "electoral wake," a
Tuesday evening march into
Palo Alto's Lytton Plaza, will be
gin today as the local chapters
of the Resistance and the Stu
dents for a Democratic Society
(SDS) demonstrate opposition
to the election and the war.
The focal point of activity will
begin Tuesday at 6:45 p.m. as the
Resistance sponsors a march led
by Joan Baez and the Resistance
Truck from the Stanford cam
pus to downtown Palo Alto.
The march, which concludes in
Lytton Plaza, will have a draft
card turn-in, followed by a rock
festival and dance celebration
featuring bands such as the Mad
River, Allmen Joy, and Notes
from the Underground."
The "wake" will assemble
marchers at the Palm Drive Oval
fronting Stanford and will pro
ceed down Palm Drive to High
Street. It will then wind its way
to the All Saints Episcopal
Church at Waverley Street. The
Church is being used as a polling
place and plans call for students
to turn in draft cards. The march
will then continue to Lytton Pla
za where the rock dance and ral
ly will be held.
Lack of Choice
According to Paul Rupert of
the Resistance, the "wake" will
be an expression of those "hun
dreds of friends of the Resist
ance who mourn the lack of any
meaningful choice in this partic
ular election."
Marchers will carry black can
dles and sing Gregorian chants
along the route. Four thousand
candles have been acquired by
the organization in anticipation
of a large gathering.
Rupert said that nine persons
have already pledged to turn in
their draft cards, four of them
Stanford students.
Preceding Tuesday night's
demonstrations a full schedule
of additional activity will take

place, x'oday at noon, the San
Francisco Mime Troupe will per
form on White Plaza.
Today's Activities
The SDS has reserved Cubber
ley Auditorium for the showing
of two films Monday evening at
8:00. The first is "Hanoi, Tues
day the 13th," which is said to
depict life in North Vietnam
amidst the war. The second fea
ture, "No-Game," describes last
fall's demonstrations at the Pen
tagon.
The films will be followed by
a panel discussion about the elec
tion with each of the panelists
making short statements fol
lowed by open discussion and
comment from the audience.
Panelists will include Robert
McAfee Brown, professor of re
ligion and a former McCarthy
supporter; Dr. Elliott Levinthal
from the Stanford Medical

statement endorsing Humphrey;
Jeff Hatch of the Stanford Com

Politics; Dave Ransom, editor of
the Peninsula Observer and
Peace and Freedom Party Con
gressional candidate; and Lin

SDS Plans
Preceding Tuesday evening's
wake the SDS has announced
plans to "make Stanford educa
tion more relevant on Election
Day" by going to classes and en
gaging instructors in discussion
about the elections, foreign pol
icy, and the University."
Following a noon rally in
White Plaza, SDS will lead a
"festive procession" to the Sys
tems Techniques Laboratory. "A
sit-down is planned . . . but the
chief function of the demonstra
tion is educational, . . . one step
in a campaign to get Stanford
and Stanford Research Institute
out of Southeast Asia," accord
ing to a statement from Leonard
Siegel of SDS.
