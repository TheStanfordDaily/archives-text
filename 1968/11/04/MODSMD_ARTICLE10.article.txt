# The 						Presidential Election: An Editorial
## 
### 
This strange political year began with Lyndon Johnson firmly
President, with the war in Vietnam firmly ours, and with the
collective mind of the nation fairly at ease.
Since then Sen. Eugene McCarthy decided to run for Presi
dent. McCarthy's success in the New Hampshire primary led Sen.
Robert Kennedy to join in the race for the White House. And
the combination of massive support for the two peace candi
dates and the vagaries of war led Lyndon Johnson to proclaim
himself a lame duck.
But in the spring the vast unconscious of America struck down
Dr. Martin Luther King, who had always tried to heal, and
Robert Kennedy, who was trying to understand how. Our con
sciences were slightly bent, and schools were renamed.
In the summer of our impotence Republicans ignored both
California Gov. Ronald Reagan and New York Gov. Nelson Rock
efeller, while Democrats (their Mayor protecting them with
might against crowds who allegedly did not bathe) ignored Mc-
Carthy and his La Mancha campaign which seemed to have en
listed the support of the party majority but not the convention.
And a man from Alabama went around telling people that law
and order should make them forget injustice.
Who are the heirs of this unusual year?
Richard Nixon, nominated because for many years he made
speeches on behalf of little-known candidates while he himself
sank into obscurity, is a man who has not wanted to talk about
the issues. He has tried instead to present a united front to the
North Vietnamese, to support the hopeless foreign policy of Mr.
Johnson.
If we cannot be sure what the politically astute Mr. Nixon will
be like as President, we can at least parse his laconic jargon and
determine that he is not speaking to the roots of the American
problem.
"What we need is not more people on welfare rolls but more
people on payrolls," he tells us, a little uncomfortable at having
started his speech out by saying, "Sock it to me." He wants a no
issue campaign which he can win by having been a household
word so long. He hopes that his familiarity can lift the dead
weight of Spiro Agnew, the vice presidential candidate chosen
by the South.
George Wallace is another case. If he is not stupid, at least
he is simplistic. If he is honest, at least he is very, very wrong
in his outdated campaign to return power to the states.
Although we would agree with him that local autonomy is
absolutely essential in the long run if America is to remain one
nation, we cannot see that rights of autonomy should transcend

considerations of justice. The former governor of Alabama is
appealing to elements in the nation who are frightened by the
complex conflicts that characterize modern life, who want a re
turn to the white, the common, the simple. He illogically attacks
hippies and "pseudo-intellectual" professors, conjuring up images
of an American repression surpassing Joe McCarthy's.
And then there is Hubert Humphrey, a man once in the fore
front of liberal causes, a long-time supporter of civil rights and
increased aid to those in need. But there is also the Hubert
Humphrey who has supported Mr. Johnson's viciously stupid war
in Southeast Asia for the purpose of containing something we
do not quite understand.
And there is the Hubert Humphrey who allowed himself to
be nominated, flaunting the wishes of the people (as expressed
in the primaries) for Eugene McCarthy or some other peace
candidate, who moreover was nominated in the city of Chicago,
feif of Richard Daley, whose porcine police radicalized more
people than radicals themselves ever could. He is a student of
the old political assumptions, a drugstore liberal, a man without
the foresight desperately needed in these times.
But these three men are the only ones who have a real chance
this funny year to be President. They are men few people want
but most will vote for, men playing for personal power when the
reign of Lyndon Johnson has shown the very great flaws of per
sonal power, men seeking to give the nation much, much more of
the same.
We believe it is too late in our country's life for these men,
and no sudden bids for partial peace in Vietnam can change
our minds.
What America needs is national leaders who perceive that the
way we go about governing ourselves has to be drastically
revised, leaders who are aware that they must never let concern
for their own personal fortune as measured in history books
affect what thejl do. And these leaders must be dedicated, as we
see it, to the following principles:
• That persons must be free to act in their own areas of com
petence, whether the persons be professors in their universities,
black men and women in their communities, or workers in their
factories.
• That the violence inherent in American life must be under
stood and controlled without resort to more violence.
• That the economic success of the United States places upon
us a responsibility to help feed and clothe the rest of the world,
as well as we can, but that our economic position does not entitle
no tn inffrfprp. in anv wav with the political and social affairs of

other countries.
• That nuclear weapons must be controlled by treaty and dis
armament must l>egm immediately.
• That the ravages of the phony economic system, increased
by large-scale advertising, must be ended, and our resources must
be reallocated, perhaps through the use of the negative income
tax or some similar device, to assure that all Americans share
equally in the national wealth.
• That the draft and any demand for compulsory service to
the state be alxilished and that the military itself eventually be
eliminated.
• That the Electoral College and the seniority system in Con
gress be abolished, and that the illogical puzzle of primaries and
conventions be replaced by a rational system of selecting presi
dential candidates.
• That governmental problems be recognized as moral prob
lems and dealt with on a moral plane.
Where have we leaders who approach problems in these ways
or in ways like them? Certainly they are not visible in the two
(or three) major parties.
As we pointed out in an earlier editorial, some of them may
be found in Congressional races in this area. Some of them may
be lurking elsewhere in the major parties, kept silent by the hacks
who now rule. But the nation needs many others with similarly
open minds if violent disruption is not to grip the country soon.
Essential to our view of a new America is the minimization
of political leadership. In order to make America truly human
and our national policy truly moral, we need mechanisms like
those being developed in black communities for constant feed
back and constant reevaluation of governmental programs. And
we need citizens who realize that they can and must fight city
hall whenever city hall hurts them or their fellows.

On the billboards along the Bayshore are pictures of Nixon,
Wallace, and Humphrey. They are the candidates. We find it
impossible to urge members of the Stanford community to vote
for any of them in tomorrow's Presidential election.
From the depths of our conviction that the people have been
ignored in this election, we urge a vote for Eugene McCarthy,
Dick Gregory, your mother, Pigasus, or "No."
It is too late to accept the least of the three evils. It happened
in 1964. It has happened in 1968. We cannot let it happen again.
A vote of protest linked to each voter's personal struggle for
social change can help force the political system to respond to the
needs of the people for once in its long and shoddy life.

see it, to the following principles:
• That persons must be free to act in their own areas of com
petence, whether the persons be professors in their universities,
black men and women in their communities, or workers in their
factories.
• That the violence inherent in American life must be under
stood and controlled without resort to more violence.
• That the economic success of the United States places upon
us a responsibility to help feed and clothe the rest of the world,
as well as we can, but that our economic position does not entitle
no tn inffrfprp. in anv wav with the political and social affairs of

other countries.
• That nuclear weapons must be controlled by treaty and dis
armament must l>egm immediately.
• That the ravages of the phony economic system, increased
by large-scale advertising, must be ended, and our resources must
be reallocated, perhaps through the use of the negative income
tax or some similar device, to assure that all Americans share
equally in the national wealth.
• That the draft and any demand for compulsory service to
the state be alxilished and that the military itself eventually be
eliminated.
• That the Electoral College and the seniority system in Con
gress be abolished, and that the illogical puzzle of primaries and
conventions be replaced by a rational system of selecting presi
dential candidates.
• That governmental problems be recognized as moral prob
lems and dealt with on a moral plane.
Where have we leaders who approach problems in these ways
or in ways like them? Certainly they are not visible in the two
(or three) major parties.
As we pointed out in an earlier editorial, some of them may
be found in Congressional races in this area. Some of them may
be lurking elsewhere in the major parties, kept silent by the hacks
who now rule. But the nation needs many others with similarly
open minds if violent disruption is not to grip the country soon.
Essential to our view of a new America is the minimization
of political leadership. In order to make America truly human
and our national policy truly moral, we need mechanisms like
those being developed in black communities for constant feed
back and constant reevaluation of governmental programs. And
we need citizens who realize that they can and must fight city
hall whenever city hall hurts them or their fellows.

On the billboards along the Bayshore are pictures of Nixon,
Wallace, and Humphrey. They are the candidates. We find it
impossible to urge members of the Stanford community to vote
for any of them in tomorrow's Presidential election.
From the depths of our conviction that the people have been
ignored in this election, we urge a vote for Eugene McCarthy,
Dick Gregory, your mother, Pigasus, or "No."
It is too late to accept the least of the three evils. It happened
in 1964. It has happened in 1968. We cannot let it happen again.
A vote of protest linked to each voter's personal struggle for
social change can help force the political system to respond to the
needs of the people for once in its long and shoddy life.
This strange political year began with Lyndon Johnson firmly
President, with the war in Vietnam firmly ours, and with the
collective mind of the nation fairly at ease.
Since then Sen. Eugene McCarthy decided to run for Presi
dent. McCarthy's success in the New Hampshire primary led Sen.
Robert Kennedy to join in the race for the White House. And
the combination of massive support for the two peace candi
dates and the vagaries of war led Lyndon Johnson to proclaim
himself a lame duck.
But in the spring the vast unconscious of America struck down
Dr. Martin Luther King, who had always tried to heal, and
Robert Kennedy, who was trying to understand how. Our con
sciences were slightly bent, and schools were renamed.
In the summer of our impotence Republicans ignored both
California Gov. Ronald Reagan and New York Gov. Nelson Rock
efeller, while Democrats (their Mayor protecting them with
might against crowds who allegedly did not bathe) ignored Mc-
Carthy and his La Mancha campaign which seemed to have en
listed the support of the party majority but not the convention.
And a man from Alabama went around telling people that law
and order should make them forget injustice.
Who are the heirs of this unusual year?
Richard Nixon, nominated because for many years he made
speeches on behalf of little-known candidates while he himself
sank into obscurity, is a man who has not wanted to talk about
the issues. He has tried instead to present a united front to the
North Vietnamese, to support the hopeless foreign policy of Mr.
Johnson.
If we cannot be sure what the politically astute Mr. Nixon will
be like as President, we can at least parse his laconic jargon and
determine that he is not speaking to the roots of the American
problem.
"What we need is not more people on welfare rolls but more
people on payrolls," he tells us, a little uncomfortable at having
started his speech out by saying, "Sock it to me." He wants a no
issue campaign which he can win by having been a household
word so long. He hopes that his familiarity can lift the dead
weight of Spiro Agnew, the vice presidential candidate chosen
by the South.
George Wallace is another case. If he is not stupid, at least
he is simplistic. If he is honest, at least he is very, very wrong
in his outdated campaign to return power to the states.
Although we would agree with him that local autonomy is
absolutely essential in the long run if America is to remain one
nation, we cannot see that rights of autonomy should transcend

considerations of justice. The former governor of Alabama is
appealing to elements in the nation who are frightened by the
complex conflicts that characterize modern life, who want a re
turn to the white, the common, the simple. He illogically attacks
hippies and "pseudo-intellectual" professors, conjuring up images
of an American repression surpassing Joe McCarthy's.
And then there is Hubert Humphrey, a man once in the fore
front of liberal causes, a long-time supporter of civil rights and
increased aid to those in need. But there is also the Hubert
Humphrey who has supported Mr. Johnson's viciously stupid war
in Southeast Asia for the purpose of containing something we
do not quite understand.
And there is the Hubert Humphrey who allowed himself to
be nominated, flaunting the wishes of the people (as expressed
in the primaries) for Eugene McCarthy or some other peace
candidate, who moreover was nominated in the city of Chicago,
feif of Richard Daley, whose porcine police radicalized more
people than radicals themselves ever could. He is a student of
the old political assumptions, a drugstore liberal, a man without
the foresight desperately needed in these times.
But these three men are the only ones who have a real chance
this funny year to be President. They are men few people want
but most will vote for, men playing for personal power when the
reign of Lyndon Johnson has shown the very great flaws of per
sonal power, men seeking to give the nation much, much more of
the same.
We believe it is too late in our country's life for these men,
and no sudden bids for partial peace in Vietnam can change
our minds.
What America needs is national leaders who perceive that the
way we go about governing ourselves has to be drastically
revised, leaders who are aware that they must never let concern
for their own personal fortune as measured in history books
affect what thejl do. And these leaders must be dedicated, as we
see it, to the following principles:
• That persons must be free to act in their own areas of com
petence, whether the persons be professors in their universities,
black men and women in their communities, or workers in their

sank into obscurity, is a man who has not wanted to talk about
the issues. He has tried instead to present a united front to the
North Vietnamese, to support the hopeless foreign policy of Mr.
Johnson.
If we cannot be sure what the politically astute Mr. Nixon will
be like as President, we can at least parse his laconic jargon and
determine that he is not speaking to the roots of the American
problem.
"What we need is not more people on welfare rolls but more
people on payrolls," he tells us, a little uncomfortable at having
started his speech out by saying, "Sock it to me." He wants a no
issue campaign which he can win by having been a household
word so long. He hopes that his familiarity can lift the dead
weight of Spiro Agnew, the vice presidential candidate chosen
by the South.
George Wallace is another case. If he is not stupid, at least
he is simplistic. If he is honest, at least he is very, very wrong
in his outdated campaign to return power to the states.
Although we would agree with him that local autonomy is
absolutely essential in the long run if America is to remain one
nation, we cannot see that rights of autonomy should transcend

considerations of justice. The former governor of Alabama is
appealing to elements in the nation who are frightened by the
complex conflicts that characterize modern life, who want a re
turn to the white, the common, the simple. He illogically attacks
hippies and "pseudo-intellectual" professors, conjuring up images
of an American repression surpassing Joe McCarthy's.
And then there is Hubert Humphrey, a man once in the fore
front of liberal causes, a long-time supporter of civil rights and
increased aid to those in need. But there is also the Hubert
Humphrey who has supported Mr. Johnson's viciously stupid war
in Southeast Asia for the purpose of containing something we
do not quite understand.
And there is the Hubert Humphrey who allowed himself to
be nominated, flaunting the wishes of the people (as expressed
in the primaries) for Eugene McCarthy or some other peace
candidate, who moreover was nominated in the city of Chicago,
feif of Richard Daley, whose porcine police radicalized more
people than radicals themselves ever could. He is a student of
the old political assumptions, a drugstore liberal, a man without
the foresight desperately needed in these times.
But these three men are the only ones who have a real chance
this funny year to be President. They are men few people want
but most will vote for, men playing for personal power when the
reign of Lyndon Johnson has shown the very great flaws of per
sonal power, men seeking to give the nation much, much more of
the same.
We believe it is too late in our country's life for these men,
and no sudden bids for partial peace in Vietnam can change
our minds.
What America needs is national leaders who perceive that the
way we go about governing ourselves has to be drastically
revised, leaders who are aware that they must never let concern
for their own personal fortune as measured in history books
affect what thejl do. And these leaders must be dedicated, as we
see it, to the following principles:
• That persons must be free to act in their own areas of com
petence, whether the persons be professors in their universities,
black men and women in their communities, or workers in their
factories.
• That the violence inherent in American life must be under
stood and controlled without resort to more violence.
• That the economic success of the United States places upon
us a responsibility to help feed and clothe the rest of the world,
as well as we can, but that our economic position does not entitle
no tn inffrfprp. in anv wav with the political and social affairs of

other countries.
• That nuclear weapons must be controlled by treaty and dis
armament must l>egm immediately.
• That the ravages of the phony economic system, increased
by large-scale advertising, must be ended, and our resources must
be reallocated, perhaps through the use of the negative income
tax or some similar device, to assure that all Americans share
equally in the national wealth.
• That the draft and any demand for compulsory service to
the state be alxilished and that the military itself eventually be
eliminated.
• That the Electoral College and the seniority system in Con
gress be abolished, and that the illogical puzzle of primaries and
conventions be replaced by a rational system of selecting presi
dential candidates.
• That governmental problems be recognized as moral prob
lems and dealt with on a moral plane.
Where have we leaders who approach problems in these ways
or in ways like them? Certainly they are not visible in the two
(or three) major parties.
As we pointed out in an earlier editorial, some of them may
be found in Congressional races in this area. Some of them may
be lurking elsewhere in the major parties, kept silent by the hacks
who now rule. But the nation needs many others with similarly
open minds if violent disruption is not to grip the country soon.
Essential to our view of a new America is the minimization
of political leadership. In order to make America truly human
and our national policy truly moral, we need mechanisms like
those being developed in black communities for constant feed
back and constant reevaluation of governmental programs. And
we need citizens who realize that they can and must fight city
hall whenever city hall hurts them or their fellows.

On the billboards along the Bayshore are pictures of Nixon,
Wallace, and Humphrey. They are the candidates. We find it
impossible to urge members of the Stanford community to vote
for any of them in tomorrow's Presidential election.
From the depths of our conviction that the people have been
ignored in this election, we urge a vote for Eugene McCarthy,
Dick Gregory, your mother, Pigasus, or "No."
It is too late to accept the least of the three evils. It happened
in 1964. It has happened in 1968. We cannot let it happen again.
A vote of protest linked to each voter's personal struggle for
social change can help force the political system to respond to the
needs of the people for once in its long and shoddy life.
This strange political year began with Lyndon Johnson firmly
President, with the war in Vietnam firmly ours, and with the
collective mind of the nation fairly at ease.
Since then Sen. Eugene McCarthy decided to run for Presi
dent. McCarthy's success in the New Hampshire primary led Sen.
Robert Kennedy to join in the race for the White House. And
the combination of massive support for the two peace candi
dates and the vagaries of war led Lyndon Johnson to proclaim
himself a lame duck.
But in the spring the vast unconscious of America struck down
Dr. Martin Luther King, who had always tried to heal, and
Robert Kennedy, who was trying to understand how. Our con
sciences were slightly bent, and schools were renamed.
In the summer of our impotence Republicans ignored both
California Gov. Ronald Reagan and New York Gov. Nelson Rock
efeller, while Democrats (their Mayor protecting them with
might against crowds who allegedly did not bathe) ignored Mc-
Carthy and his La Mancha campaign which seemed to have en
listed the support of the party majority but not the convention.
And a man from Alabama went around telling people that law
and order should make them forget injustice.

conventions be replaced by a rational system of selecting presi
dential candidates.
• That governmental problems be recognized as moral prob
lems and dealt with on a moral plane.
Where have we leaders who approach problems in these ways
or in ways like them? Certainly they are not visible in the two
(or three) major parties.
As we pointed out in an earlier editorial, some of them may
be found in Congressional races in this area. Some of them may
be lurking elsewhere in the major parties, kept silent by the hacks
who now rule. But the nation needs many others with similarly
open minds if violent disruption is not to grip the country soon.
Essential to our view of a new America is the minimization
of political leadership. In order to make America truly human
and our national policy truly moral, we need mechanisms like
those being developed in black communities for constant feed
back and constant reevaluation of governmental programs. And
we need citizens who realize that they can and must fight city
hall whenever city hall hurts them or their fellows.

On the billboards along the Bayshore are pictures of Nixon,
Wallace, and Humphrey. They are the candidates. We find it
impossible to urge members of the Stanford community to vote
for any of them in tomorrow's Presidential election.
From the depths of our conviction that the people have been
ignored in this election, we urge a vote for Eugene McCarthy,
Dick Gregory, your mother, Pigasus, or "No."
It is too late to accept the least of the three evils. It happened
in 1964. It has happened in 1968. We cannot let it happen again.
A vote of protest linked to each voter's personal struggle for
social change can help force the political system to respond to the
needs of the people for once in its long and shoddy life.
This strange political year began with Lyndon Johnson firmly
President, with the war in Vietnam firmly ours, and with the
collective mind of the nation fairly at ease.
Since then Sen. Eugene McCarthy decided to run for Presi
dent. McCarthy's success in the New Hampshire primary led Sen.
Robert Kennedy to join in the race for the White House. And
the combination of massive support for the two peace candi
dates and the vagaries of war led Lyndon Johnson to proclaim
himself a lame duck.
But in the spring the vast unconscious of America struck down
Dr. Martin Luther King, who had always tried to heal, and
Robert Kennedy, who was trying to understand how. Our con
sciences were slightly bent, and schools were renamed.
In the summer of our impotence Republicans ignored both
California Gov. Ronald Reagan and New York Gov. Nelson Rock
efeller, while Democrats (their Mayor protecting them with
might against crowds who allegedly did not bathe) ignored Mc-
Carthy and his La Mancha campaign which seemed to have en
listed the support of the party majority but not the convention.
And a man from Alabama went around telling people that law
and order should make them forget injustice.
Who are the heirs of this unusual year?
Richard Nixon, nominated because for many years he made
speeches on behalf of little-known candidates while he himself
sank into obscurity, is a man who has not wanted to talk about
the issues. He has tried instead to present a united front to the
North Vietnamese, to support the hopeless foreign policy of Mr.
Johnson.
If we cannot be sure what the politically astute Mr. Nixon will
be like as President, we can at least parse his laconic jargon and
determine that he is not speaking to the roots of the American
problem.
"What we need is not more people on welfare rolls but more
people on payrolls," he tells us, a little uncomfortable at having
started his speech out by saying, "Sock it to me." He wants a no
issue campaign which he can win by having been a household
word so long. He hopes that his familiarity can lift the dead
weight of Spiro Agnew, the vice presidential candidate chosen
by the South.
George Wallace is another case. If he is not stupid, at least
he is simplistic. If he is honest, at least he is very, very wrong
in his outdated campaign to return power to the states.
Although we would agree with him that local autonomy is
absolutely essential in the long run if America is to remain one
nation, we cannot see that rights of autonomy should transcend

considerations of justice. The former governor of Alabama is
appealing to elements in the nation who are frightened by the
complex conflicts that characterize modern life, who want a re
turn to the white, the common, the simple. He illogically attacks
hippies and "pseudo-intellectual" professors, conjuring up images
of an American repression surpassing Joe McCarthy's.
And then there is Hubert Humphrey, a man once in the fore
front of liberal causes, a long-time supporter of civil rights and
increased aid to those in need. But there is also the Hubert
Humphrey who has supported Mr. Johnson's viciously stupid war
in Southeast Asia for the purpose of containing something we
do not quite understand.
And there is the Hubert Humphrey who allowed himself to
be nominated, flaunting the wishes of the people (as expressed
in the primaries) for Eugene McCarthy or some other peace
candidate, who moreover was nominated in the city of Chicago,
feif of Richard Daley, whose porcine police radicalized more
people than radicals themselves ever could. He is a student of
the old political assumptions, a drugstore liberal, a man without
the foresight desperately needed in these times.
But these three men are the only ones who have a real chance
this funny year to be President. They are men few people want
but most will vote for, men playing for personal power when the
reign of Lyndon Johnson has shown the very great flaws of per
sonal power, men seeking to give the nation much, much more of
the same.
We believe it is too late in our country's life for these men,
and no sudden bids for partial peace in Vietnam can change
our minds.
What America needs is national leaders who perceive that the
way we go about governing ourselves has to be drastically
revised, leaders who are aware that they must never let concern
for their own personal fortune as measured in history books
affect what thejl do. And these leaders must be dedicated, as we
see it, to the following principles:
• That persons must be free to act in their own areas of com
petence, whether the persons be professors in their universities,
black men and women in their communities, or workers in their
factories.
• That the violence inherent in American life must be under
stood and controlled without resort to more violence.
• That the economic success of the United States places upon
us a responsibility to help feed and clothe the rest of the world,
as well as we can, but that our economic position does not entitle
no tn inffrfprp. in anv wav with the political and social affairs of

other countries.
• That nuclear weapons must be controlled by treaty and dis
armament must l>egm immediately.
• That the ravages of the phony economic system, increased
by large-scale advertising, must be ended, and our resources must
be reallocated, perhaps through the use of the negative income
tax or some similar device, to assure that all Americans share
equally in the national wealth.
• That the draft and any demand for compulsory service to
the state be alxilished and that the military itself eventually be
eliminated.
• That the Electoral College and the seniority system in Con
gress be abolished, and that the illogical puzzle of primaries and
conventions be replaced by a rational system of selecting presi
dential candidates.
• That governmental problems be recognized as moral prob
lems and dealt with on a moral plane.

or in ways like them? Certainly they are not visible in the two
(or three) major parties.
