### PAUL RUPERT 
Imagine a monstrous bomb
strapped to a railway carriage,
hurtling through the night. Em
blazoned on its side are the
words "Western Civilization".
Perched on top are two little
men: one sits in front of his TV
set, drinking a can of beer, glar
ing at a hippie who sits at the
other end looking infinitely im
potent. The glowering chap is
saying: "Get a haircut!"
As with all Ron Cobb cartoons,
one can say no more. Being ar
rogant, I'll try to add a little.
My response to that cartoon
was at first a cynical smile, a
thought about how trivial bigots
are: long hair really is their
pre-occupation, blacks do threat
en the hell out of them.
But perhaps that's reasonable.
Hippies and lazy anarchists up
set people's self-definitions, vie
for the loyalty of their children.
Certainly blacks threaten their
jobs and status. They've worked
hard, earned a TV set and Paul
Harvey's news — they should
have a parochial vision.
But a longer look at the car
toon suggests that the bigot is
not the central element. What is
far more important is the con
sumer-spectator who is hippie,
liberal, radical, bigot or what
ever superficial label you prefer.
Hell-bent for nuclear destruction,
over-population, air pollution or
your particular cschatological
horror, there sits a cat drinking
beer, watching his world wipe
itself out on the tube — perhaps
watching a documentary on
himself.
It all becomes more intriguing
when we realize that tomorrow
is Election Day. I needn't dwell
on the failure of any of the can
didates to rise above the trivial.
Every commentator has. What
seems most intriguing to me is
precisely that fact.
The entire country is sitting
back watching itself get screwed,
and commenting endlessly on the
fact: "Well, Chet, We certainly
are in for a meaningless election,
aren't we?" "Yes, David, we cer
tainly are." (They chuckle, dul
ly.)

It's convenient that a number
of symbolically-inclined folks
have decided to rid themselves
of their draft cards on election
night. They have chosen to do
a full-fledged wake, with candles,
chants and all for the electoral

process which — although im
portant — is trivial at best in
the face of our problems.
I urge you all to join us in
the march which is not designed
to beg anyone for anything.
Rather, it is to serve notice on

the new president ana nis peo
ple that we are serious about cre
ating a place for human life in
this country.
Don't watch us, join us: Tues
day evening is bound to be bad
TV on any channel.

liberal, radical, bigot or what
ever superficial label you prefer.
Hell-bent for nuclear destruction,
over-population, air pollution or
your particular cschatological
horror, there sits a cat drinking
beer, watching his world wipe
itself out on the tube — perhaps
watching a documentary on
himself.
It all becomes more intriguing
when we realize that tomorrow
is Election Day. I needn't dwell
on the failure of any of the can
didates to rise above the trivial.
Every commentator has. What
seems most intriguing to me is
precisely that fact.
The entire country is sitting
back watching itself get screwed,
and commenting endlessly on the
fact: "Well, Chet, We certainly
are in for a meaningless election,
aren't we?" "Yes, David, we cer
tainly are." (They chuckle, dul
ly.)

It's convenient that a number
of symbolically-inclined folks
have decided to rid themselves
of their draft cards on election
night. They have chosen to do
a full-fledged wake, with candles,
chants and all for the electoral

process which — although im
portant — is trivial at best in
the face of our problems.
I urge you all to join us in
the march which is not designed
to beg anyone for anything.
Rather, it is to serve notice on

the new president ana nis peo
ple that we are serious about cre
ating a place for human life in
this country.
Don't watch us, join us: Tues
day evening is bound to be bad
TV on any channel.


Imagine a monstrous bomb
strapped to a railway carriage,
hurtling through the night. Em
blazoned on its side are the
words "Western Civilization".
Perched on top are two little
men: one sits in front of his TV
set, drinking a can of beer, glar
ing at a hippie who sits at the
other end looking infinitely im
potent. The glowering chap is
saying: "Get a haircut!"
As with all Ron Cobb cartoons,
one can say no more. Being ar
rogant, I'll try to add a little.
My response to that cartoon
was at first a cynical smile, a
thought about how trivial bigots
are: long hair really is their
pre-occupation, blacks do threat
en the hell out of them.
But perhaps that's reasonable.
Hippies and lazy anarchists up
set people's self-definitions, vie
for the loyalty of their children.
Certainly blacks threaten their
jobs and status. They've worked
hard, earned a TV set and Paul
Harvey's news — they should
have a parochial vision.
But a longer look at the car
toon suggests that the bigot is
not the central element. What is
far more important is the con
sumer-spectator who is hippie,
liberal, radical, bigot or what
ever superficial label you prefer.
