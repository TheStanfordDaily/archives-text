## Stanford's War Effort 
### DAVID PUGH 
While Stanford people have
staged teach-ins, signed news
paper ads, and petitioned their
Congressmen in opposition to
the war, the Systems Techniques
Laboratory (STL) of the Stan
ford Electronics Labs has been
steadily churning out electronics
warfare research that will both
help prosecute colonial wars
and "deter" war-to-end-all-wars
in the 1970'5. Right under our
noses.
Centered in the Applied Elec
tronics Labs, which is nestled be
hind the new Space Engineering
Building, STL is handling $1 mil
lion in defense contracts this
year.
Six of the eight current De
partment of Defense contracts
are classified and around 40 per
cent of the projects generate
classified quarterly reports to
the Pentagon.
STL also has a $125,000 con
tract from the National Insti
tutes of Health systems for early
drug diagnosis and for control
ling the artificial heart. But the
lab's principal thrust is toward
theoretical and design work in
the field of military electronics.
A publication of the Electrical
Engineering Department ex
plains that STL is "an on-cam
pus research program whose ob
jective is to offer a close and
immediate coupling between the
results of academic research pro
grams and the most advanced
needs of military electronics in
such areas as countermeasures.
Pentagonese
In Pentagonese, electronics
warfare (EW) protects our elec
tronics from the incursions of
the enemy and in turn messes
up the enemy's electronics.

In laymen's terms, EW opera
tions jam Radio Havana, moni
tor guerilla communications, and
foil surface-to-air missiles and
radar directed anti-aircraft fire
in the skies of North Vietnam.
Professor William Rambo, di
rector of the Stanford Electron
ics Labs, explains that the roots
of Stanford's military electronics
program were laid in the Second
World War. "Before the war,
there was almost no interaction
between Stanford and the fed
eral government. The war start
ed a whole new concern of uni
versity people with solving mili
tary problems."
Professor Rambo confided that
"if the EW research hadn't had
some military impact over the
past 16 years, it wouldn't be re
funded." Thus STL's work in
the middle and late 50's has con
tributed to the present genera
tion of weapons being used in
Vietnam.
For instance, Rambo did clas
sified work for the Air Force on
the Travelling Wave Tube, which
is presently used in military re
ceivers that monitor North Viet
namese transmissions. But it is
highly probable that this re
search has been put to use by
the Federal Communications
Commission in its monitoring
work. Military research always
generates spin-offs that find ci
vilian uses.
STL director Charles Schoens
emphasizes that the laboratory
isn't in the business of produc
ing electronics equipment. Com
mercial companies pick up STL's
techniques and then manufac
ture electronics hardware for the
Army of the FCC. The equip
ment- nnrmallv annpars some 8-

10 years after STL's work.
Defense
It is hardly surprising, then, to
find several Stanford faculty
members sitting both on the
boards of companies that spe
cialize in EW equipment and on
Defense Department EW advi
sory committees.
Professor Rambo was until
recently a director of Applied
Technology Inc., a resident of
the Stanford Industrial Park.
According to ATl's 1967 pros
pectus, "Most of the company's
products are used to gather in
formation concerning an adver
sary's electronic capabilities or
to impair the operational effect
iveness of certain enemy weap
ons. A major portion of ATl's
business is classified."
Though he is opposed to the
Vietnam War, Rambo feels an
obligation to maintain America's
basic military posture. He is con
cerned about "the loss of civilian
control of government â€” the
way to maintain it is to partici
pate in government." He was a
strong McCarthy supporter.
Likewise, goateed Charles
Schoens is anti-War, but he feels
that "we should protect our
planes over North Vietnam.
The debate and the action
should center on the function of
the U.S. military in the world
today, on the support furnished
to the modern merchants of
death by Stanford professors,
and on the freedom of Univer
sity scientists to do research,
advise, and consult on weaponry
that takes away the freedom of
other human beings who have no
means of redress at Stanford
University.
