## Andro-mâché 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
"Racine's Andromache," the
program notes inform us, "ex
ploded upon the French theater
in 1667." Three centuries later,
the Stanford Repertory Thea
ter's production seems to have
backfired.
A tale of political and emo
tional involvements in the wake
of the Trojan War, the play
more or less centers around the
fate of Andromache, the widow
of Hector and a prisoner of
Achilles' son, Pyrrhus — or vice
versa, as the whims of love
would have it. But Pyrrhus, to
secure peace between Greece
and Epirus, has agreed to mar
ry Hermione, Helen's daughter.
She is willing enough, but
Orestes, Agamemnon's son, is
not. He arrives in Epirus, full
of anti-Trojan and pro-Hermione
sentiments; kills Pyrrhus for
Hermione, only to find that re
venge was far from her heart
when she kills herself over her
love's dead body.
The classical French play
wrights transformed the roles
of the gods in Greek mythology
into the forces of passion and
deception, in accordance with
their revised views of fate. Thus,
Andromache requires a sensi
tive and cohesive direction com
bined with powerful and convin
cing acting. This production
manifests no sign of either.
The play is handicapped from
the start by John Cairncross's

translation. The subtle, flowing
couplets of the original become
a strong-beat blank verse almost
without variation in its scan
sion. Any nuances of wording
and content are stultified by the
stiff poetic form; and the ac
tors, apparently unaware of the
difference between poetry and
poetic form, speak — or rather
recite — their lines as if they
were trying to convey the strict
ness of the iambic line rather
than its content. In addition, the
language of the play switches
rapidly from obsolescent vocabu
lary and phrasing to modern
slang and clich£.
But given this bad start, a
company of SRT's reputed qual
ity should have been able to
redeem the play, had director
Michael Barry enforced some
consistency of style. As it is, the
actors seem torn between two
styles of acting: the three-wall,
pre-Stanislavsky concept of dec
lamation of the 17th century, in
which the actors address them
selves to the audience and con
trol the action through their
speaking alone; and the mod
ern, four-wall concept in which
SRT actors are obviously in
grained. This constant struggle
is evidenced by the uncertain at
titude of the actors toward each
other and the audience. Embar
rassment characterizes every
thing from the blocking of the
scenes to the awkward shifting
of the actors' eyes. Stephen D.

Newman, as Orestes, vacillates
between attempts at Shakespear
ian force of declamation and
aristocratic superciliousness; the
minor characters are not sure
where they are supposed to be
looking, and soon have the
audience wondering the same
thing.
The set of the play is a hapc
lessly amateurish representation
of Greek architecture perhaps a
thousand years after the action
of the play (though this is, per
haps, how the 17th century saw
it — if that is a dramatically
valid excuse). The costuming
shows a defective sense of color
and design, and the makeup is
careless. The actors' movements
show a poor sense of pacing. In
short, visually the play is a
failure as audially it is a nui
sance.
The one spark of hope in the
play is Maidie Norman's perfor
mance as Andromache. She, at
least, is a presence on the stage;
her voice is at times impressive,
her movement somewhat majes
tic, her personality submerged
in the character she is creating.
But alas, good acting seems in
congruous and unnatural in this
production, and one good per
formance can only shed a devas
tating light on the stage. No one
but Miss Norman is even less
than petty, let alone majestic;
one has no illusions that the ac
tors are the great characters
they portray. And the illusion if
the size is an absolute requisite
of this play. Without the sense
of fate impending on the lives
of great persons, the play be
comes a petty working out of
irrational jealousies and artifi
cial passions. An intellectual ex
ercise becomes the only possible

response; and the incoherence of
presentation makes that nearly
impossible.
There are doubtless reasons
inherent in the nature of 17th
century drama and the limita
tions of a company such as
SRT which could soften the fine
edges of a critic's sensibilities;
but, as Hermione says, "My an
ger balks at all this reasoning."
