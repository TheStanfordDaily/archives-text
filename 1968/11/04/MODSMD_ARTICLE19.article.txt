# History Professor Mancall Receives Teaching Award
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
In typically colorful and exotic
fashion, Mark Mancall, associate
professor of history, is spending
the fall in Paris, nearly broke, he

writes, from purchasing 17th
Century tapestries.
Last night in St. Louis, Mis
souri, the Danforth foundation
put Mancall back in the black
with a $10,000 award for distin
guished teaching.
The E. Harris Harbison Award,
the most prestigious teaching
honor in the nation, was pre
sented to 20 faculty members
from U.S. colleges and univer
sities this year. Selection is
based on "excellence in the art
of teaching, significance of schol
arly research and concern for
students as individuals."
Year of Travel
Mancall, present at a dinner
meeting yesterday evening in St.
Louis, is spending this academic
year on leave. Now in Paris, he
later plans to travel across the
Soviet Union to Mongolia, even
tually visiting Southeast Asia.
After a decade of exotic travel
and study, Mancall came to
Stanford in 1965 as a specialist
in Asian history. In December,
1966, he became founder and di
rector of Grove House, Stan
ford's first coeducational living
residence.
A 1953 UCLA graduate, Man
call receivsd advance degrees
from Harvard in 1955 and 1963.
During this period he spent a

year at the University of Hel
sinki, as a Fulbright scholar,
and did post-graduate work at
the universities of Tokyo, Lenin
grad, and the National Univer
sity of Taiwan. He speaks fluent
Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Fin
nish, and French.
At Stanford, Mancall has be
come a close friend for many
students in serious study and re
laxed pastimes such as analyti
cally watching "Star Trek". He
constantly mixes serious aca
demics with sagacious anecdotes
and jokes. His seminar on "Rev
olution" comes close to a cult on
campus.
Whether it be television or
scholarship, Mancall's mind is
always restless as he observes
socialist commentary in "Star
Trek" or stays awake all night
totally engrossed in an elemen
tary text of Turkish he has just
purchased,
In late 1966, shortly after the
University agreed to establish
an experimental living group in
the empty Phi Delta Theta fra
ternity house, the administration
asked Mancall if he cared to di
rect the "all male house." Man
call, intrigued by the possibili
ties of an experimental situation,
argued for "a coed residence"
and Grove was the result.

MARK MANCALL
In typically colorful and exotic
fashion, Mark Mancall, associate
professor of history, is spending
the fall in Paris, nearly broke, he

writes, from purchasing 17th
Century tapestries.
Last night in St. Louis, Mis
souri, the Danforth foundation
put Mancall back in the black
with a $10,000 award for distin
guished teaching.
The E. Harris Harbison Award,
the most prestigious teaching
honor in the nation, was pre
sented to 20 faculty members
from U.S. colleges and univer
sities this year. Selection is
based on "excellence in the art
of teaching, significance of schol
arly research and concern for
students as individuals."
Year of Travel
Mancall, present at a dinner
meeting yesterday evening in St.
Louis, is spending this academic
year on leave. Now in Paris, he
later plans to travel across the
Soviet Union to Mongolia, even
tually visiting Southeast Asia.
After a decade of exotic travel
and study, Mancall came to
Stanford in 1965 as a specialist
in Asian history. In December,
1966, he became founder and di
rector of Grove House, Stan
ford's first coeducational living
residence.
A 1953 UCLA graduate, Man
call receivsd advance degrees
from Harvard in 1955 and 1963.
During this period he spent a

year at the University of Hel
sinki, as a Fulbright scholar,
and did post-graduate work at
the universities of Tokyo, Lenin
grad, and the National Univer
sity of Taiwan. He speaks fluent
Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Fin
nish, and French.
At Stanford, Mancall has be
come a close friend for many
students in serious study and re
laxed pastimes such as analyti
cally watching "Star Trek". He
constantly mixes serious aca
demics with sagacious anecdotes
and jokes. His seminar on "Rev
olution" comes close to a cult on
campus.
Whether it be television or
scholarship, Mancall's mind is
always restless as he observes
socialist commentary in "Star
Trek" or stays awake all night
totally engrossed in an elemen
tary text of Turkish he has just
purchased,
In late 1966, shortly after the
University agreed to establish
an experimental living group in
the empty Phi Delta Theta fra
ternity house, the administration
asked Mancall if he cared to di
rect the "all male house." Man
call, intrigued by the possibili
ties of an experimental situation,
argued for "a coed residence"
and Grove was the result.
