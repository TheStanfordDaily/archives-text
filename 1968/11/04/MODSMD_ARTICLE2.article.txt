# Work Continues On Minority Plan
## 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON 
The School of Medicine last
week moved closer to implemen
tation of a plan to increase radi
cally the number of minority
medical students.
Following up on an earlier de
cision, the faculty senate of the
medical school established a
nine-member Search Committee
for Minority Students. There is,
however, some question as to
what role the search committee
will take in recruitment of new
minority students.
The faculty senate last month
decided to implement a special
program under which at least
ten minority students would be
admitted to the school. The move
came after presentation of de
mands by the Black Student Un
ion (BSU) for increased minori
ty enrollment.
Role Defined
In its meeting last week the
faculty senate defined the role
of the search committee to in
clude recruiting applicants, par
ticipating in interviews and eval
uations and recommending spe
cific applicants. As defined by
the senate resolution, the com
mittee would not have the power
to select applicants for admis
sion.
The make-up of the committee
is as follows: three members se
lected by the Black Student Un
ion, three by the Mexican-Ameri
can Student's Confederation and
three by the Committee of Five,
a faculty group selected by the
faculty senate.
The resolution passed by the
senate further stated that the
minority program would be in
effect for a minimum of five
years. Also stipulated is that
students admitted under the pro
gram will have to meet the same
course and graduation require
ments as regular students.
Disagreement?
Some disagreement has ap
parently arisen in the faculty
senate over the exast relation
ship of the search committee to
the admissions committee. They
were unable to agree on how the
two committees "could interact
to their mutual advantage."
According to a memo circu
lated among the faculty of the
medical school, "details" of how
the two committees will work
together "have been referred to
a Subcommittee for prompt ac
tion."

The original demands pre
sented by the Black Student Un
ion specified that admission of
minority students would be de
cided by a committee with only
a minority of faculty members.
The regular admissions commit
tee is composed entirely of medi
cal faculty and administration.
While the faculty senate unan
imously supported the program
"in principle," there was some
opposition to other specific parts
of the plan. In particular, the
composition of the search com
mittee was adopted by a split
vote.

lated among the faculty of the
medical school, "details" of how
the two committees will work
together "have been referred to
a Subcommittee for prompt ac
tion."

The original demands pre
sented by the Black Student Un
ion specified that admission of
minority students would be de
cided by a committee with only
a minority of faculty members.
The regular admissions commit
tee is composed entirely of medi
cal faculty and administration.
While the faculty senate unan
imously supported the program
"in principle," there was some
opposition to other specific parts
of the plan. In particular, the
composition of the search com
mittee was adopted by a split
vote.
The School of Medicine last
week moved closer to implemen
tation of a plan to increase radi
cally the number of minority
medical students.
Following up on an earlier de
cision, the faculty senate of the
medical school established a
nine-member Search Committee
for Minority Students. There is,
however, some question as to
what role the search committee
will take in recruitment of new
minority students.
The faculty senate last month
decided to implement a special
program under which at least
ten minority students would be
admitted to the school. The move
came after presentation of de
mands by the Black Student Un
ion (BSU) for increased minori
ty enrollment.
Role Defined
In its meeting last week the
faculty senate defined the role
of the search committee to in
clude recruiting applicants, par
ticipating in interviews and eval
uations and recommending spe
cific applicants. As defined by
the senate resolution, the com
mittee would not have the power
to select applicants for admis
sion.
The make-up of the committee
is as follows: three members se
lected by the Black Student Un
ion, three by the Mexican-Ameri
can Student's Confederation and
three by the Committee of Five,
a faculty group selected by the
faculty senate.
The resolution passed by the
senate further stated that the
minority program would be in
effect for a minimum of five
years. Also stipulated is that
students admitted under the pro
gram will have to meet the same
course and graduation require
ments as regular students.
Disagreement?
Some disagreement has ap
parently arisen in the faculty
senate over the exast relation
ship of the search committee to
the admissions committee. They
were unable to agree on how the
two committees "could interact
to their mutual advantage."
According to a memo circu
lated among the faculty of the
medical school, "details" of how
the two committees will work
together "have been referred to
