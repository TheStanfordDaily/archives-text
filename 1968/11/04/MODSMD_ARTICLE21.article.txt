# Beavers Blast Indians 29-7
## 
### GARY CAVALLI 
The format was different but
the result vvas the same Satur
day afternoon, as Stanford's
downtrodden and downhearted
Indians absorbed their third loss
in four games, succumbing to a
relentless Oregon State ground
attack 29-7.
Appearing lifeless and dis
spirited after having been elim
inated from the Rose Bowl
derby, Stanford fell behind early
and couldn't catch the ball-con
trolling Beavers. With fullback
"Buffalo" Bill Enyart totting the
pigskin 34 times for 164 yards
and tailback Billy Main ("Back
of the Game") scoring two TD's
and gaining 126 yards on 18
carries, the OSU eleven held the
whip hand for the entire con
test.
The loss, dropping Stanford's
record to 3-3-1 overall and 1-3-1
in Pac-8 play, marked several
firsts for John Ralston's crew.
It was the first time in seven
games that the Tribe had been
outgained by an opponent—3B6
to 361. Actually those statistics
are deceiving. The game wasn't
that close.
Shutout String Ends
The rain-drenched affair also
marked the first time the In
dians had been scored upon in
the opening quarter of play.
Main took a pitchout from
poised quarterback Steve Preece
—delivered just as Preece was
about to be nailed—and sprinted
20 yards for the touchdown with
4:15 gone in the period.
But, most significantly, Satur
day's game was the first this
year in which Stanford got legit
imately and convincingly beaten.
In both the 27-24 heartbreaker
with USC and the 20-17 give
away to UCLA last week in Los
Angeles, not to mention the
21-21 tie with WSU, the Indians
had outplayed their opponents
but fallen prey to bad breaks,
muffed opportunities and ques
tionable officiating. This time
things were different.
The Beavers took Coach Dee
Andros' game plan and executed
it to perfection.
"Our game plan was to con
trol the ball and get to Plun
kett," a proud Andros revealed
after the game. "We mixed up

our rush. We used both a four
man rush and an outside rush."
"This was a real team vic
tory," Andros went on. "I'm real
proud of our defense, and the
offiense took advantage of the
breaks—especially in the second
half."
The Indians agreed with An
dros' analysis.
"They were big, strong, physi
cal, and wouldn't let us have the
football," Tribe coach John Ral
ston affirmed. "They beat us in
every way you can get beat."
Quarterback Jim Plunkett,
who "just didn't have it today,"
completed 18 of 34 passes for
314 yards, but had trouble find
ing open receivers and was
dropped behind the line five
times for losses totalling 47
yards in the second half.
"They had our receivers cov
ered well," Plunkett said, "so
the line could really put the
pressure on." The Tribe sopho
more also thought that a failure
to establish the running game
enabled OSU to concentrate on
a fierce pass rush. Stanford
managed 90 yards rushing for
the ball game.
OSU "Best By Far"
"That's the best defense we've
faced—by far," asserted tailback
Bubba Brown, who was held to
25 yards in 7 carries. The All-
American JC transfer from Ven
tura readily admitted that this
was the first time Stanford had
actually been beaten this year.
"The other games we lost,
but today we were beaten," the
good-natured Brown said. "To
day no one could beat OSU.
They did everything right. They
couldn't do anything wrong."
The Beavers completely con
trolled the ball in the first quar
ter, running 27 plays to only 7
for Stanford. They got on the
scoreboard with 10:45 left in the
stanza when Preece rolled
around the left side for three
yards, then pitched to Main, who
shifted gears and outraced the
Tribe defense into the end zone.
6-0 Oregon State.
Stanford threatened to tie it
up late in the quarter when a
22-yard deep reverse to flanker
Gene Washington gave the Tribe
a first down on the Beaver 22.
But Plunkett was blind-sided on
a bootleg and the ball was jarred
loose at the 18. Terry Belcher
recovered for OSU.
With Enyart carrying seven
times for 33 yards, the Beavers
drove 71 yards in 16 plays be

fore Kent Scott booted a 27 yard
field goal to make it 9-0.
Andro's rush-oriented crew
made it 15-0 minutes later when
four running plays covered 80
yards. Main gained seven, two
thrusts by Enyart netted 18,
and then quarterback-turned
halfback Bob Mayes sped 55
yards for the score. Mayes
barely slipped past Stu Kellner
in the backfield, but utilized his
9.7 speed to leave the entire
Tribe defense clutching at his
heels.
Fumbles Fatal
Two fumbles by Stanford set
up easy touchdowns for OSU in
the water-logged third quarter.
Plunkett lost the snap from
center at the Tribe 23, and
OSU's "Lineman of the Game"
John Sandstrom fell on it at the
20. Five plays later, from the
three, Enyart slammed into the
Indian line but lost the handle
on the pigskin. The ball bounced
twice as if guided by some in
visible Beaver fan in the sky
before Preece picked it up and
jogged untouched into the end
zone. Scott kicked the convers
ion to make it 22-0 with 2:16
gone in the period.
Nineteen seconds later the
Beavers made it 29-0. After
Brown returned the kickoff to
the 15, fullback Greg Broughton
fumbled on first down, with
Tom Greerty recovering at the
20.
On first down Main took a
pitch from Preece, broke three
tackles and faked out another
man enroute to a 20-yard TD
gallop. Scott's PAT made it
29-0.
Aside from allowing the two
fumble - manufactured touch
downs, the Tribe defense played
excellent ball in the second half,
holding the Beavers to only 97
yards. Linebackers Don Parish
and Pat Preston were particu
larly outstanding for Stanford.
OSU quarterback Preece called
Parish, who made an amazing
23 tackles, "the best linebacker
we've faced all year. He's an
outstanding football player."
Stanford averted a whitewash
when Plunkett hooked up with
Washington on a 34-yard scor
ing play. The 6-2 senior from
Long Beach hauled in Plunkett's
aerial at the 18 and broke three
tackles on the way to his sixth
TD of the year. A legitimate All-
American candidate, Washing
ton now has 50 receptions in
seven games.
