# Czech Liberalization Subject To Soviet Will
## 
### 
A Czech-born research associ
ate at the Hoover Institution re
cently told the World Affairs
Council in Sacramento that
Czechoslovakia was at the mercy
of the Soviet Union.
Mrs. Lida Urbanek said, "The
further development of liberal
ization or democratization in
Czechoslovakia is subject to the
Soviet will and is determined by

Soviet national interest. Any
other view is simply illusory."
She predicted that "whereas
the Soviet Union will try to ac
commodate Czech demands for
more equitable economic rela
tions, in political and military
relations the Soviet Union will
give Czechoslovakia no conces
sions.
"Along with the other Soviet
bloc countries, Czechoslovakia
will be unable to contradict the
Soviet will."
Urbanek was not completely
pessimistic. "Only recently the
Soviet Union itself admitted that
it could not find even one man
in that country to declare that
he had invited the aid of the
Soviet brothers. This despite the
fact that one of every 17 adults
is a member of the Communist
Party, and despite the fact that
the party had broken away from
Stalinism so recently that it
hadn't had time to purge the
diehard practitioners."
Until August, Urbanek sug
gested that Czechoslovakia was
"a natural and willing partner
to an alliance of friendship with
the Soviet Union."
