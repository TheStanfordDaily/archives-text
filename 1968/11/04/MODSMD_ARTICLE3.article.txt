# The 						dream of many, the realization of few

"The Perfect

Crime" was almost committed
at Stanford this Fall. In true
Robin Hood fashion, with the
cause of studenthood as their
ideal, the heroes tried to finagle
the grading in Psychology 1 so
that no one failed.
Their racket consisted of tak
ing midterms and quizzes under
fictitious names. By doing poor
ly, they could bring down the
curve. They even handed in
computer cards and blue cards
so that the fictitious names
would be placed on all of the
computerized class lists.

"If we get enough people to
do it, no one can fail," enthusi
astically explained one uniden
tified member of the class. Only
fake people would get F's.
However, they forgot the in
vincible Registrar's Office, which
makes up class lists according to
the cards each student hands in
with his student number. These
lists are then sent to each de
partment.
Acting on a hot tip-off, J. Mer
rill Carlsmith, one of the instruc
tors of Psych 1, compared the
Registrar's list with the list of
people who had taken tests. Even
if he had not checked over the
lists now, he said the discrepan
cies would definitely have been
discovered when the final marks
were recorded.
Carlsmith said that the fake
grades were included in calculat
ing the mean for the midterm
and some quizzes. He said, how
ever, that there were "so few, it
isn't having effect at all." De
spite the grade conspirators op
timistic force of 20 cohorts, their

force was small. Only thre? fic
titious people took the midterm.
They got two F's and one D.
Five nonexistent people took the
recent quiz. One, who took both
the midterm and the quiz, wrote
Carlsmith a note asking if he
could switch to Pass-Fail grad
ing.
Since Psych 1 has an enroll
ment of approximately 300, they
barely lowered the mean. In the
case of the midterm, the true
mean should have been about
two hundredths of a point high
er.
If there had been a signficant
number taking phony tests, thus
altering the mean, Carlsmith ex
plained that he would have just
"pulled the cards and rerun
them" through the computer. He
remarked that it would be "an
awful nuisance" if it had been
done in a class that didn't have
computerized grading.
So students took another loss
in their struggle to outfool the
authorities. But the dream still
lives . . .
