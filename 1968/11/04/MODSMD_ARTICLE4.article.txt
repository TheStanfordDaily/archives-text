# Nixon Men Concerned

### ANN DENTON 
The feeling among members
of the Young Republicans (YR's)
who are supporting Richard
Nixon for President is one of
uncertainty.
Plagued by the effect of Eu
gene McCarthy's endorsement of
Vice President Humphrey and
by the effect of the bombing
halt, YR President Michael Kuhl
stated, "On the national scene
I can only say that it's going to
be a very, very close race. I
hate to venture an opinion. With
three parties in the running, who
knows what the outcome will
be?"
Questioned about the accuracy
of polls showing Nixon still lead
ing in the home stretch, Kuhl
replied that "the polls can give
a prediction, but in terms of
giving a really accurate picture,
only the voting booth will tell."
The emotional level of the last
"The emotional level of the
last few days with its charges
and counter-charges will be vory
important in deciding the win
ner. It's just really very, very
hard to predict any true voting
picture."
Ramon Buhler, membership
chairman, thinks Nixon will
eventually win, "but there's a
chance that between Humphrey
and Wallace it could be thrown
into the House. I think the
states to watch will be Pennsyl
vania and Texas."
Eddie Anderson, Northern
California chairman of Youth
for Nixon, adds Michigan to the
list of states on which the elec
tion hinges. He believes, "If
Nixon can take any of those
three, he'll have the election. He
already has Ohio, Illinois, and
New Jersey. He will certainly
carry California and the rest of
the west."
Kuhl, Buhler, and Anderson
agreed that Nixon will carry
California. Buhler stated, "No
doubt about it. I'm sure he'll
carry California." He expressed
concern, however, that Hum
phrey will carry the nation's
second largest state. "Hum
phrey's over the hump in New
York."
It is in the East where Nixon
students fear the effect of Mc-
Carthy's endorsement and John
son's bombing halt, although
although most thought that nei
ther action would influence
many voters.
In relation to the bombing
halt, Kuhl stated, "I don't think
that it is going to have any
effect on those people who have
been supporting Nixon all along.
I don't think there will be an
erosion of strength in that sense.
"I do thing that for those peo
ple who have come to regard a
bombing halt as a speedy end
for the war in Vietnam, Presi
dent Johnson's actions can only
help Vice President Humphrey.
"It will possibly sway some
votes, but the political impli
cations of the move will do lit
tle to strengthen either Mr.
Humphrey's or Mr. Johnson's

credibility and their ability to
obtain final resolution to the
Vietnam conflict."
Buhler agreed that the bomb
ing halt is not significant in it
self. He feels that in the past
three weeks Humphrey has been
gaining momentum while Nixon
has been losing it. Buhler stated,
"The bombing halt is significant
in that it continues Humphrey's
gain. Ho is still gaining momen
tum. The question is will it be
enough to overtake Nixon's long
lead."
The YR's felt the same about
the influence of McCarthy's en
dorsement. Anderson summar
ized their opinion, "On the whole,
I think it was too late and too
qualified."
Buhler expressed the feoling
of the club as the campaign
neared its climax. doesn't
have a large enough lead that he
can throw away votes. I'm afraid
it's going to be too close for
comfort."
