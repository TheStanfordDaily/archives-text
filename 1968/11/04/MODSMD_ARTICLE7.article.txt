## McCarthyites Split 
### 
Reactions to Senator Eugene
McCarthy's recent endorsement
of Vice - President Humphrey
among McCarthy's supporters
are anything but uniform.
Opinions among various facul
ty and administrators have been
varying. An ad was published in
The Daily by some members of
the University community which
emphasized their initial support
for McCarthy but their switch
to Hubert Humphrey last we6k.
When questioned on the rea
sons for this switch a number
of views were articulated.
Prof. Eliot Levinthal of the
Genetics Department said, "It
wasn't immediately obvious to
me after the convention that
voting for Humphrey was the
optimum choice. At that time I
didn't know what the alterna
tives would be and what the dif
ferences between Humphrey and
Nixon would be."
The Man
Mrs. Kenneth Cuthbertson
commented that her support for
Humphrey comes in part
through observing his past rec
ord, and that she would "rather
vote for the man, Humphrey,
than vote for the man, Nixon."
Vice-Provost Packer, when
asked if he thought he was com
promising his values because of
the switch, said that he was a
McCarthy supporter up and un

til the convention but changed
immediately following.
Mrs. Packer of the Depart
ment of English said she thought
it important not to support Nix
on. Asked if she considered her
vote a negative vote she said
no, that Humphrey was not per
fect, "but that I am prepared to
go along with his stands."
Best Man
According to Wallace Stegner
of the Department of English it
was absolutely essential to cast
the vote for the best man possi
ble and as much as he was sorry
that the vote for McCarthy was
not there he considered his vote
only a somewhat less enthusias
tic vote.
The active campus group of
student McCarthy supporters,
the Committee for a new Demo
cratic Politics, who have since
pledged themselves to work for
local candidates, has shown in a
pair of instances a particular di
vision in view.
Bob Stern of the Committee,
told The Daily "I am voting for
Hubert Humphrey, but haven't

worked for him. He is the least
of three evils, and I hope he
wins. I would rather see us work
from within the Democratic
Party than have to form a fourth
party movement."
"I feel that whites can live
with Nixon for four years but
blacks cannot."
Stern felt that staying within
the party was all that remained.
A much different view was
elicited from Dave Jones the
chairman of the Committee.
"It was significant that Mc-
Carthy endorsed Hubert Hum
phrey but said he would not run
within the Democratic Party
again."
"I will vote for Nixon," said
Jones. "A vote for Nixon stops
Hubert Humphrey in the Demo
cratic Party, and this is good."
"In California if Humphrey
wins it means Mayor Alioto will
have control of the party rather
than Jesse Unruh. Therefore if
Nixon wins, Unruh's position
will be stronger, and I'd rather
see him at the head of the Cali
fornia party.

commented that her support for
Humphrey comes in part
through observing his past rec
ord, and that she would "rather
vote for the man, Humphrey,
than vote for the man, Nixon."
Vice-Provost Packer, when
asked if he thought he was com
promising his values because of
the switch, said that he was a
McCarthy supporter up and un

til the convention but changed
immediately following.
Mrs. Packer of the Depart
ment of English said she thought
it important not to support Nix
on. Asked if she considered her
vote a negative vote she said
no, that Humphrey was not per
fect, "but that I am prepared to
go along with his stands."
Best Man
According to Wallace Stegner
of the Department of English it
was absolutely essential to cast
the vote for the best man possi
ble and as much as he was sorry
that the vote for McCarthy was
not there he considered his vote
only a somewhat less enthusias
tic vote.
The active campus group of
student McCarthy supporters,
the Committee for a new Demo
cratic Politics, who have since
pledged themselves to work for
local candidates, has shown in a
pair of instances a particular di
vision in view.
Bob Stern of the Committee,
told The Daily "I am voting for
Hubert Humphrey, but haven't

worked for him. He is the least
of three evils, and I hope he
wins. I would rather see us work
from within the Democratic
Party than have to form a fourth
party movement."
"I feel that whites can live
with Nixon for four years but
blacks cannot."
Stern felt that staying within
the party was all that remained.
A much different view was
elicited from Dave Jones the
chairman of the Committee.
"It was significant that Mc-
Carthy endorsed Hubert Hum
phrey but said he would not run
within the Democratic Party
again."
"I will vote for Nixon," said
Jones. "A vote for Nixon stops
Hubert Humphrey in the Demo
cratic Party, and this is good."
"In California if Humphrey
wins it means Mayor Alioto will
have control of the party rather
than Jesse Unruh. Therefore if
Nixon wins, Unruh's position
will be stronger, and I'd rather
see him at the head of the Cali
fornia party.
Reactions to Senator Eugene
McCarthy's recent endorsement
of Vice - President Humphrey
among McCarthy's supporters
are anything but uniform.
Opinions among various facul
ty and administrators have been
varying. An ad was published in
The Daily by some members of
the University community which
emphasized their initial support
for McCarthy but their switch
to Hubert Humphrey last we6k.
When questioned on the rea
sons for this switch a number
of views were articulated.
Prof. Eliot Levinthal of the
Genetics Department said, "It
wasn't immediately obvious to
me after the convention that
voting for Humphrey was the
optimum choice. At that time I
didn't know what the alterna
tives would be and what the dif
ferences between Humphrey and
Nixon would be."

commented that her support for
Humphrey comes in part
through observing his past rec

vote for the man, Humphrey,
