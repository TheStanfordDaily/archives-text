# HHH Support Minimal Here

### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Hubert Horatio Humphrey
may get more votes from the
Stanford community than any
other candidate for the presi
dency, but his supporters are
generally far from enthusiastic.
Only 50 Stanford students
have been working for the vice
president's campaign this quar
ter, despite the fact that last
week's Daily poll showed Hum
phrey leading the race among
students, with one-third of those
questioned supporting him.
Organized by John Endriz, a
graduate student in electrical
engineering, the small coterie
has been busy doing precinct
work, mainly in Santa Clara
County, for the past several
weeks.
Doing most of their work on
weekends, they have also can
vassed East Palo Alto, which is
in San Mateo County, and will
concentrate their work there
Tuesday afternoon in a get-out
the-vote-drive.
The group is not especially
optimistic about Humphrey's
chances of winning California,
but the prospects are better now
than when they started.
Optimism Lacking
"The first couple of weekends
looked damned dismal," accord
ing to Dale Hattis, a graduate
student in genetics. "But I think
things have been more friendly
recently. There's a chance—not
a big one, but a chance—that

Humphrey can win if everybody
gets out and works."
Jim Early, a graduate student
in aeronautics and astronautics,
agrees.
"Unless there is a strong re
action to McCarthy's statement
and the bombing halt, and a
large voter turnout, Humphrey's
chances in the state are slim,"
he says.
Figures on voter response to
the events of the week are
unavailable to the group, since
their precinct work this past
weekend was all in East Palo
Alto, where they have not can
vassed before.
The group was organized
shortly before the start of the
quarter, and held an organiza
tional meeting during the first
week of classes.
About 100 students expressed
an interest in working at that
time, but the number of active
members dropped quickly to its
present level.
Most of the people involved
are former supporters of the
late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy,
but some are also ex-McCarthy
ites.
Working out of the local
Humphrey-for-President office at
542 University Avenue, they
conducted a telephone poll the
first week, and since then have
been working the precincts.
So far, "our results tend to
confirm pretty much what the
California polls have been show
ing," Early said.
Humphrey Gains Noted
After early canvassing, which
showed Humphrey receiving the
support of as little as 40 per
cent of registered Democrats,
the responses have been improv
ing.
Recent figures for Democrats
contacted, early estimates show,
65 to 70 per cent for the vice
president, ten per cent for Rich
ard Nixon, four per cent for
Wallace, and a few write-in
voters.
But there is also a large unde
cided vote, he rtotes, on the or
der of 15 or 20 per cent. This
has been dropping from a high
of 30 per cent with Humphrey
picking up almost all the sup
port.
Why are these former Ken
nedy and McCarthy supporters
now working for Humphrey?
Dennis Perluss, a junior history
major, is fairly representative of
the group.
"I'd hesitate to use the ex
pression 'least of three evils,' "
he says."I still think it's a posi
tive choice. There are a lot of
things about Humphrey I like,
but I can't say this about the
other two.
"But it could have been a lot
more positive if I had been
working for another Democratic
nominee."

he says.
Figures on voter response to
the events of the week are
unavailable to the group, since
their precinct work this past
weekend was all in East Palo
Alto, where they have not can
vassed before.
The group was organized
shortly before the start of the
quarter, and held an organiza
tional meeting during the first
week of classes.
About 100 students expressed
an interest in working at that
time, but the number of active
members dropped quickly to its
present level.
Most of the people involved
are former supporters of the
late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy,
but some are also ex-McCarthy
ites.
Working out of the local
Humphrey-for-President office at
542 University Avenue, they
conducted a telephone poll the
first week, and since then have
been working the precincts.
So far, "our results tend to
confirm pretty much what the
California polls have been show
ing," Early said.
Humphrey Gains Noted
After early canvassing, which
showed Humphrey receiving the
support of as little as 40 per
cent of registered Democrats,
the responses have been improv
ing.
Recent figures for Democrats
contacted, early estimates show,
65 to 70 per cent for the vice
president, ten per cent for Rich
ard Nixon, four per cent for
Wallace, and a few write-in
voters.
But there is also a large unde
cided vote, he rtotes, on the or
der of 15 or 20 per cent. This
has been dropping from a high
of 30 per cent with Humphrey
picking up almost all the sup
port.
Why are these former Ken
nedy and McCarthy supporters
now working for Humphrey?
Dennis Perluss, a junior history
major, is fairly representative of
the group.
"I'd hesitate to use the ex
pression 'least of three evils,' "
he says."I still think it's a posi
tive choice. There are a lot of
things about Humphrey I like,
but I can't say this about the
other two.
"But it could have been a lot
more positive if I had been
working for another Democratic
nominee."
Hubert Horatio Humphrey
may get more votes from the
Stanford community than any
other candidate for the presi
dency, but his supporters are
generally far from enthusiastic.
Only 50 Stanford students
have been working for the vice
president's campaign this quar
ter, despite the fact that last
week's Daily poll showed Hum
phrey leading the race among
students, with one-third of those
questioned supporting him.
Organized by John Endriz, a
graduate student in electrical
engineering, the small coterie
has been busy doing precinct
work, mainly in Santa Clara
County, for the past several
weeks.
Doing most of their work on
weekends, they have also can
vassed East Palo Alto, which is
in San Mateo County, and will
concentrate their work there
Tuesday afternoon in a get-out
the-vote-drive.
The group is not especially
optimistic about Humphrey's
chances of winning California,
but the prospects are better now
than when they started.
Optimism Lacking
"The first couple of weekends
looked damned dismal," accord
ing to Dale Hattis, a graduate
student in genetics. "But I think
things have been more friendly
recently. There's a chance—not
a big one, but a chance—that

Humphrey can win if everybody
gets out and works."
Jim Early, a graduate student
in aeronautics and astronautics,
agrees.
"Unless there is a strong re
action to McCarthy's statement
and the bombing halt, and a
large voter turnout, Humphrey's
chances in the state are slim,"
he says.
