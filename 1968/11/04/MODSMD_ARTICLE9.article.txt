# 'Fills Educational Need'
## Free U's Diversity 
### PETE SELBY 
The Midpeninsula Free Uni
versity exists because it meets
an educational need that the
other educational institutions
in the San Francisco area, Stan
ford for one, fail to recognize,
according to Robb Crist, the
executive director of the Free
U.
"And the only thing respon
sible for the Free U's existence
is the people who participate in
it," Crist continued. The Free
U started in the spring of 1967
as a direct result of a free
speech movement at Berkeley.
A similar organization, The Ex
periment, was already estab
lished on the Stanford campus,
and the Free U's success was
not initially great.
In fact, whether the Free U
would survive the first year
was a hard-felt question. Dur
ing this period, the Experiment,
ousted from the building they
occupied on the Stanford cam
pus after accusing Dr. Sterling
and the Board of Trustees for
being connected with various
war atrocities, combined with
the Free U.
Barry Greenberg, who had
headed the Experiment, became
the Executive Director of the
Free U, but later quit, criticiz
ing the organization for not
being politically radical enough.
It was at this point, Crist re
ported, that the Free U stood
its greatest test.
I>ost Enthusiasm
The coordinating committee
had lost a lot of the enthusi
asm that first characterized it,

and was considering giving up
the whole idea. Crist became
the Executive Director, the co
ordinating committee decided to
stay together. With this 'de
cision came a renewed enthu
siasm, and a great deal of new
courses were offered.
The enrollment increased
from the first quarter total of
80 to 350 in the 1967 summer
quarter, and then continued its
upward trend to last quarter's
enrollment of 1150.
It is estimated that 50 per
cent of this total was com
prised by the 'Stanford Com
munity'. "This is, however, an
arbitrary figure," Crist ex
plained. "What, exactly, com
prises a member of the Stan
ford community — a student's
brother, an Alumni, a Stanford
drop-out?"
The Free U makes no distinc
tion between the leader of the
course and those attending. The
figures, for instance, of 1150 in
cluded those 'teaching' the
courses. No reliable statistics
are available on how many of
the courses offered—there were
254 this fall quarter—material
ize. Many are intended for only
one meeting.
Courses Offered
The diversity of the Free U,
one of its main attributes, is
witnessed by the 254 courses
offered. From auto eroticism, a
course to teach people about
the mechanics of their automo
bile, to a study of the "aims and
techniques of guerrilla warfare
in an urban setting", to an "I
don't know much, but neither

do you — come over for a lit
tle while and we'll both learn"
class, the Free U has it.
"Obviously, in an environment
where there are no require
ments to teach a course, there
are going to be good courses
and bad courses," said one Free
U student. "I enrolled in this
beginning guitar course that
•was just a flop, a real wipe-out,
tout then, on the other hand, a
•crafts course I took was really
•great." It is this principle of
(no course screening that makes
•the Free U what it is. Everyone
can do his own 'thing'.
Though the Free U started
out with an emphasis on
courses concerning radical poli
tics and sensory awareness, it
experienced a trend to more
practical courses — sandalmak
ing, wine making, electronics,
and practical house wiring, etc.
Crist, who is also the curricu
lum coordinator (and an on
again, off-again graduate stu
dent in philosophy at Stanford)
reported a recent counter-trend
to this.
Radical Trend
With the recent events in the
United States, the political
courses are becoming very im
portant to people. The courses
dealing with candlemaking, etc.,
are still popular, but the radical
courses are coming back strong
er than ever.
The Free U is looking for a
building to operate out of. But
Stanford isn't supplying one,
and neither is Palo Alto. As it
ptands now, the courses are
given at individuals' homes, or
ofi the beach, or in the moun
tains.
