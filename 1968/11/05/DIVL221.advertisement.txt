This is a copy
of a copy
of an invitation
to interview
a company
you may not know
well enough.
Making copies is only part of the story.
You can get the other part straight from the source. Talk to
our representative and ask him about R&D looking ahead to
major advances in education... in areas like color xerography
and 3-D imaging...about refinements in combined xerography
and EDP systems to process and graphically reproduce any
theory or fact available...at any distance.
Ask anything imaginable and you'll discover you're probing
a company that's involved with every phase of the information
and education explosion.
We place great emphasis on individual initiative. Additional
schooling aimed at advanced degrees. Brainstorming. A
variety of short-term project groups. And benefits. In short,
your career, not simply a job for you to fill.
So while you're looking us over for career opportunities, we'll
be looking you over for career potential. Fair enough?
Why not make an appointment with your Placement Director.
A half hour of your time could be the start of a great future in
fundamental and applied research, developmental and manu
facturing engineering, or programming.
