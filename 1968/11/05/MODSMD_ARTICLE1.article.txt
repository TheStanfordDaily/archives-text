# Lederberg Talks
## Man May Design Next Generation 
### BARBARA RITZ 
(EDITOR'S NOTE: Joshua Lederberg is professor of
genetics and biology at Stanford, and is also the execu
tive head of the genetics department and director of
the Kennedy Laboratories for Molecular Medicine,
Stanford University Medical School. He was awarded
the Nobel Prize in 19">8 for his research concerning
heredity-transmitting mechanisms in bacteria.)
Imagine there is an individual whom you admire and
whose genetic traits interest you. Within the near fu
ture it is not inconceivable that you may endow your
own child with those particular genetic traits.
With such possibilities for human genetic interven
tion, Dr. Joshua Lederberg raised the question of
"what role should man play in determining his own
future?"
Dr. Lederberg believes that a key issue is deciding
how much "control" other individuals, the community,
the federal government, and various religious organs
should exercise over the way an individual can alter
his biological make-up.
Because many people are unfamiliar with genetic
engineering, Dr. Lederberg stated that some of them
react in horror to the thought of interfering with the
genetic biology of an individual; yet, paradoxically,
they have no objection as to how that same individual
is educated. He feels that often a person's education
is far more deterministic than any kind of biological
tampering could be.
Role of Environment
Culture, language, religion, life styles are in all
societies regenerated and reinforced to the degree
that, as Lederberg stated, "You are more like any av
erage member of your class at Stanford than you would
be like your identical twin if your identical twin were
reared in China."
Environment plays as great a role in determining
the characteristics of a human being as does the genetic
make-up of that person.
"This may seem deterministic," he said, "and you
may rebel against the idea of being determined by
your education. However, should you have been set
adrift in a boat on the Atlantic Ocean during the first

ten years of your life, left free to develop as you wish,
you wouldn't have survived five minutes."
'Genetic Engineering'
Despite the fact that education and culture play
such a major role in the character development of an
individual, genetic engineering can still play an im
portant role in shaping him.
Dr. Lederberg outlined some theories of genetic en
gineering which may be realized within the next five
to twenty years.
As an extension to the concept of vaccination, sci
entists are in the process of applying "genetic engineer
ing" to viruses, he said. He gave as proto-type example
the production of a virus that restored the capacity
to make enzymes that are missing in some genetic
diseases of mental retardation like PKU.
As another example, he commented that fetal diag
noses of genetic diseases have already been done within
the first trimester of the pregnancy. He projected one
course of action for a couple who knew themselves
to be carriers of a hereditary disease like cystic fi
brosis.
Possibility of Abortion
Cystic fibrosis is a generalized disease of the exo
crine glands affecting primarily the digestive tract
and the lungs. It carries a high mortality rate in in
fants.
"If a couple knew that they were both carriers of
the disease, and there was a one-in-four chance of
cystic fibrosis in the offspring, this possibility could
be investigated (fetal diagnosis), and if found to be
true, the couple could weigh the possibilities of an
abortion."
Dr. Lederberg said that he was not necessarily advo
cating this type of action, but that it could become an
important development within five to ten years.
The possibility of applying ,such techniques now is
limited by the existing abortion laws in this country
as well as the attitudes of the Catholic Church.
Boundaries of Life
Traditional Catholic doctrine has been to define life
from the moment of conception. Dr. Lederberg stressed
the importance of having some concensus about the

boundaries of lite, but he doubted that the community
would insist on placing it so early in the pregnancy.
He termed a l'etus a part of a woman's body, and up
to some stage in the pregnancy has about as much
right to independent existence as does the tip of her
finger.
Dr. Lederberg said that the most cogent objection
to the present law is that it is unenforceable. There
are many illegal abortions performed on a "class dis
criminatory basis," and he feels that the practice ought
to be rationalized by the law.
He believes that the government ought to be limited
in exercising its jurisdiction over questions concerning
a moral or individual choice, and raised the possibility
that such laws could be over-policed.
He asks why the state has to be involved when there
are other factors. Our moral sense is determined by
ourselves, by our interactions with other people, and
by our religious and ethical codes, and he feels that the
ultimate decisions should be left up to the individual.
Need for Restriction
However, in keeping with the whole process of indi
vidual liberty, Dr. Lederberg recognized the need for
certain restrictions. As one example, he stressed that
heart transplantation involves the rights of at least
three individuals â€” the recipient, the donor, and the
doctor.
Yet, in view of the sudden demand for more hearts
than can be supplied, he acknowledged the possibility
of some form of regulation. Lederberg believes he may
have been the first person to raise the questions of
the availablity of hearts for transplant at a symposium
in London six years ago. The first heart transplants
were actually made last year.
"I don't think that there is an answer to that ques
tion, and 1 think it will have to be evaded, rather than
solved," He has made two specific recommendations to
Congress since that time: that we concentrate not on
heart transplants, but on mechanical hearts; and that
we consider that kind of scientific effort that would
make it possible to use animal hearts instead of hu
man hearts. He stated a reluctance of many people to
readily accept such techniques.
"The tirst heart transplant
could not have been done in this
country, although Dr. Norman
Shumway was technically ready
to do it long ago." He feels that
the reason the first transplant
was performed in South Africa
was that Barnard was able to
act independently, and that the
social pressure in South Africa
against such an operation was
less than in the U.S.
Gradual Acceptance
"Any kind of technical advance
requires a gradual process for
its acceptance," Dr. Lederberg
said. "Part of the same progress
of biological science that pro
vides heart transplants and nu
clear transplantation encompass
very special procedures, and

some of them can be life saving
in a way that no one denies," he
added.
"We have to make very care
fully thought out decisions with
regard to each of these," he
said, "and not label them all
together in some fuzzy category
of new-fangled tampering with
people."
In regard to studies on genet
ic differences, Dr. Lederberg was
asked to comment on Dr. Wil
liam Shockley's recent state
ments on race and intelligence.
Lederberg feels that the psy
cho - social parameters are so
many that at present we cannot
make any useful observations
concerning the genetics of racial
differences in people. He stated
that there is possibly a misun

derstanding of the substance of
Shockley's proposals.
Dr. Lederberg, however, de
nounced "loose talk intended to
humiliate Blacks when we have
no scientific basis to attribute
their difficult social and econom
ic status to genetic factors other
than their skin color."
Specific Potentialities
"I don't quarrel with the con
ception that one ought to do sci
entific investigation of the dif
ferences among people," he com
mented. He pointed out that you
have to understand the specific
potentialities of people in order
to give them equal opportunity.
Dr. Lederberg gave an example
concerning congenital deafness.
"If you did not know that
some children were congenitally

deaf, and you said that the re
sponsibility for equal oppor
tunity was simply to give them
all equal access to the same form
of classrooms, and the same
form of eduaction, would you
really be giving deaf children
equal opportunities?" he asks.
"You have to know what it is
they are suffering from in order
to give them the special train
ing that is required for the prob
lem."
Whereas we know something
about the neurology of deafness,
we know very little about the
neurology of intelligence, he
commented.
Dr. Lederberg proposed that
the way an individual can ex
press his feelings about the con
trol of his environment and its

forces of indoctrination is
through forms of social protest.
"If there are ways in which
you have been over-determined,
if your personality has been
warped or thwarted by the kind
of milieu in which you live, then
say so." He stressed that an in
dividual should try to utilize
whatever resources he has left
to understand how he came into
his present situation, and how to
reach a better one.

"The tirst heart transplant
could not have been done in this
country, although Dr. Norman
Shumway was technically ready
to do it long ago." He feels that
the reason the first transplant
was performed in South Africa
was that Barnard was able to
act independently, and that the
social pressure in South Africa
against such an operation was
less than in the U.S.
Gradual Acceptance
"Any kind of technical advance
requires a gradual process for
its acceptance," Dr. Lederberg
said. "Part of the same progress
of biological science that pro
vides heart transplants and nu
clear transplantation encompass
very special procedures, and

some of them can be life saving
in a way that no one denies," he
added.
"We have to make very care
fully thought out decisions with
regard to each of these," he
said, "and not label them all
together in some fuzzy category
of new-fangled tampering with
people."
In regard to studies on genet
ic differences, Dr. Lederberg was
asked to comment on Dr. Wil
liam Shockley's recent state
ments on race and intelligence.
Lederberg feels that the psy
cho - social parameters are so
many that at present we cannot
make any useful observations
concerning the genetics of racial
differences in people. He stated
that there is possibly a misun

derstanding of the substance of
Shockley's proposals.
Dr. Lederberg, however, de
nounced "loose talk intended to
humiliate Blacks when we have
no scientific basis to attribute
their difficult social and econom
ic status to genetic factors other
than their skin color."
Specific Potentialities
"I don't quarrel with the con
ception that one ought to do sci
entific investigation of the dif
ferences among people," he com
mented. He pointed out that you
have to understand the specific
potentialities of people in order
to give them equal opportunity.
Dr. Lederberg gave an example
concerning congenital deafness.
"If you did not know that
some children were congenitally

deaf, and you said that the re
sponsibility for equal oppor
tunity was simply to give them
all equal access to the same form
of classrooms, and the same
form of eduaction, would you
really be giving deaf children
equal opportunities?" he asks.
"You have to know what it is
they are suffering from in order
to give them the special train
ing that is required for the prob
lem."
Whereas we know something
about the neurology of deafness,
we know very little about the
neurology of intelligence, he
commented.
Dr. Lederberg proposed that
the way an individual can ex
press his feelings about the con
trol of his environment and its

forces of indoctrination is
through forms of social protest.
"If there are ways in which
you have been over-determined,
if your personality has been
warped or thwarted by the kind
of milieu in which you live, then
say so." He stressed that an in
dividual should try to utilize
whatever resources he has left
to understand how he came into
his present situation, and how to
reach a better one.

genetics and biology at Stanford, and is also the execu
tive head of the genetics department and director of

heredity-transmitting mechanisms in bacteria.)
Imagine there is an individual whom you admire and
whose genetic traits interest you. Within the near fu
ture it is not inconceivable that you may endow your
own child with those particular genetic traits.
With such possibilities for human genetic interven
tion, Dr. Joshua Lederberg raised the question of
"what role should man play in determining his own
future?"
Dr. Lederberg believes that a key issue is deciding
how much "control" other individuals, the community,
the federal government, and various religious organs
should exercise over the way an individual can alter
his biological make-up.
Because many people are unfamiliar with genetic
engineering, Dr. Lederberg stated that some of them
react in horror to the thought of interfering with the
genetic biology of an individual; yet, paradoxically,
they have no objection as to how that same individual
is educated. He feels that often a person's education
is far more deterministic than any kind of biological
tampering could be.
Role of Environment
Culture, language, religion, life styles are in all
societies regenerated and reinforced to the degree
that, as Lederberg stated, "You are more like any av
erage member of your class at Stanford than you would
be like your identical twin if your identical twin were
reared in China."
Environment plays as great a role in determining
the characteristics of a human being as does the genetic
make-up of that person.
"This may seem deterministic," he said, "and you
may rebel against the idea of being determined by
your education. However, should you have been set
adrift in a boat on the Atlantic Ocean during the first

ten years of your life, left free to develop as you wish,
you wouldn't have survived five minutes."
'Genetic Engineering'
Despite the fact that education and culture play
such a major role in the character development of an
individual, genetic engineering can still play an im
portant role in shaping him.
Dr. Lederberg outlined some theories of genetic en
gineering which may be realized within the next five
to twenty years.
As an extension to the concept of vaccination, sci
entists are in the process of applying "genetic engineer
ing" to viruses, he said. He gave as proto-type example
the production of a virus that restored the capacity
to make enzymes that are missing in some genetic
diseases of mental retardation like PKU.
As another example, he commented that fetal diag
noses of genetic diseases have already been done within
the first trimester of the pregnancy. He projected one
course of action for a couple who knew themselves
to be carriers of a hereditary disease like cystic fi
brosis.
Possibility of Abortion
Cystic fibrosis is a generalized disease of the exo
crine glands affecting primarily the digestive tract
and the lungs. It carries a high mortality rate in in
fants.
"If a couple knew that they were both carriers of
the disease, and there was a one-in-four chance of
cystic fibrosis in the offspring, this possibility could
be investigated (fetal diagnosis), and if found to be
true, the couple could weigh the possibilities of an
abortion."
Dr. Lederberg said that he was not necessarily advo
cating this type of action, but that it could become an
important development within five to ten years.
The possibility of applying ,such techniques now is
limited by the existing abortion laws in this country
as well as the attitudes of the Catholic Church.
Boundaries of Life
Traditional Catholic doctrine has been to define life
from the moment of conception. Dr. Lederberg stressed
the importance of having some concensus about the

boundaries of lite, but he doubted that the community
would insist on placing it so early in the pregnancy.
He termed a l'etus a part of a woman's body, and up
to some stage in the pregnancy has about as much
right to independent existence as does the tip of her
finger.
Dr. Lederberg said that the most cogent objection
to the present law is that it is unenforceable. There
are many illegal abortions performed on a "class dis
criminatory basis," and he feels that the practice ought
to be rationalized by the law.
He believes that the government ought to be limited
in exercising its jurisdiction over questions concerning
a moral or individual choice, and raised the possibility
that such laws could be over-policed.
He asks why the state has to be involved when there
are other factors. Our moral sense is determined by
ourselves, by our interactions with other people, and
by our religious and ethical codes, and he feels that the
ultimate decisions should be left up to the individual.
Need for Restriction
However, in keeping with the whole process of indi
vidual liberty, Dr. Lederberg recognized the need for
certain restrictions. As one example, he stressed that
heart transplantation involves the rights of at least
three individuals â€” the recipient, the donor, and the
doctor.
Yet, in view of the sudden demand for more hearts
than can be supplied, he acknowledged the possibility
of some form of regulation. Lederberg believes he may
have been the first person to raise the questions of
the availablity of hearts for transplant at a symposium
in London six years ago. The first heart transplants
were actually made last year.
"I don't think that there is an answer to that ques
tion, and 1 think it will have to be evaded, rather than
solved," He has made two specific recommendations to
Congress since that time: that we concentrate not on
heart transplants, but on mechanical hearts; and that
we consider that kind of scientific effort that would
make it possible to use animal hearts instead of hu
man hearts. He stated a reluctance of many people to
readily accept such techniques.
"The tirst heart transplant
could not have been done in this
country, although Dr. Norman
Shumway was technically ready
to do it long ago." He feels that
the reason the first transplant

As another example, he commented that fetal diag
noses of genetic diseases have already been done within
the first trimester of the pregnancy. He projected one
course of action for a couple who knew themselves
to be carriers of a hereditary disease like cystic fi
brosis.
Possibility of Abortion
Cystic fibrosis is a generalized disease of the exo
crine glands affecting primarily the digestive tract
and the lungs. It carries a high mortality rate in in
fants.
"If a couple knew that they were both carriers of
the disease, and there was a one-in-four chance of
cystic fibrosis in the offspring, this possibility could
be investigated (fetal diagnosis), and if found to be
true, the couple could weigh the possibilities of an
abortion."
Dr. Lederberg said that he was not necessarily advo
cating this type of action, but that it could become an
important development within five to ten years.
The possibility of applying ,such techniques now is
limited by the existing abortion laws in this country
as well as the attitudes of the Catholic Church.
Boundaries of Life
Traditional Catholic doctrine has been to define life
from the moment of conception. Dr. Lederberg stressed
the importance of having some concensus about the

boundaries of lite, but he doubted that the community
would insist on placing it so early in the pregnancy.
He termed a l'etus a part of a woman's body, and up
to some stage in the pregnancy has about as much
right to independent existence as does the tip of her
finger.
Dr. Lederberg said that the most cogent objection
to the present law is that it is unenforceable. There
are many illegal abortions performed on a "class dis
criminatory basis," and he feels that the practice ought
to be rationalized by the law.
He believes that the government ought to be limited
in exercising its jurisdiction over questions concerning
a moral or individual choice, and raised the possibility
that such laws could be over-policed.
He asks why the state has to be involved when there
are other factors. Our moral sense is determined by
ourselves, by our interactions with other people, and
by our religious and ethical codes, and he feels that the
ultimate decisions should be left up to the individual.
Need for Restriction
However, in keeping with the whole process of indi
vidual liberty, Dr. Lederberg recognized the need for
certain restrictions. As one example, he stressed that
heart transplantation involves the rights of at least
three individuals â€” the recipient, the donor, and the
doctor.
Yet, in view of the sudden demand for more hearts
than can be supplied, he acknowledged the possibility
of some form of regulation. Lederberg believes he may
have been the first person to raise the questions of
the availablity of hearts for transplant at a symposium
in London six years ago. The first heart transplants
were actually made last year.
"I don't think that there is an answer to that ques
tion, and 1 think it will have to be evaded, rather than
solved," He has made two specific recommendations to
Congress since that time: that we concentrate not on
heart transplants, but on mechanical hearts; and that
we consider that kind of scientific effort that would
make it possible to use animal hearts instead of hu
man hearts. He stated a reluctance of many people to
readily accept such techniques.
"The tirst heart transplant
could not have been done in this
country, although Dr. Norman
Shumway was technically ready
to do it long ago." He feels that
the reason the first transplant
was performed in South Africa
was that Barnard was able to
act independently, and that the
social pressure in South Africa
against such an operation was
less than in the U.S.
Gradual Acceptance
"Any kind of technical advance
requires a gradual process for
its acceptance," Dr. Lederberg
said. "Part of the same progress
of biological science that pro
vides heart transplants and nu
clear transplantation encompass
very special procedures, and

some of them can be life saving
in a way that no one denies," he
added.
"We have to make very care
fully thought out decisions with
regard to each of these," he
said, "and not label them all
together in some fuzzy category
of new-fangled tampering with
people."
In regard to studies on genet
ic differences, Dr. Lederberg was
asked to comment on Dr. Wil
liam Shockley's recent state
ments on race and intelligence.
Lederberg feels that the psy
cho - social parameters are so
many that at present we cannot
make any useful observations
concerning the genetics of racial
differences in people. He stated
that there is possibly a misun

derstanding of the substance of
Shockley's proposals.
Dr. Lederberg, however, de
nounced "loose talk intended to
humiliate Blacks when we have
no scientific basis to attribute
their difficult social and econom
ic status to genetic factors other
than their skin color."
Specific Potentialities
"I don't quarrel with the con
ception that one ought to do sci
entific investigation of the dif
ferences among people," he com
mented. He pointed out that you
have to understand the specific
potentialities of people in order
to give them equal opportunity.
Dr. Lederberg gave an example
concerning congenital deafness.
"If you did not know that
some children were congenitally

deaf, and you said that the re
sponsibility for equal oppor
tunity was simply to give them
all equal access to the same form
of classrooms, and the same
form of eduaction, would you
really be giving deaf children
equal opportunities?" he asks.
"You have to know what it is
they are suffering from in order
to give them the special train
ing that is required for the prob
lem."
Whereas we know something
about the neurology of deafness,
we know very little about the
neurology of intelligence, he
commented.
Dr. Lederberg proposed that
the way an individual can ex
press his feelings about the con
trol of his environment and its

forces of indoctrination is
through forms of social protest.
"If there are ways in which
you have been over-determined,
if your personality has been
warped or thwarted by the kind
of milieu in which you live, then
say so." He stressed that an in
dividual should try to utilize
whatever resources he has left
to understand how he came into
his present situation, and how to
reach a better one.

genetics and biology at Stanford, and is also the execu
tive head of the genetics department and director of
the Kennedy Laboratories for Molecular Medicine,
Stanford University Medical School. He was awarded
the Nobel Prize in 19">8 for his research concerning
heredity-transmitting mechanisms in bacteria.)
Imagine there is an individual whom you admire and
whose genetic traits interest you. Within the near fu
ture it is not inconceivable that you may endow your
own child with those particular genetic traits.
With such possibilities for human genetic interven
tion, Dr. Joshua Lederberg raised the question of
"what role should man play in determining his own
future?"
Dr. Lederberg believes that a key issue is deciding
how much "control" other individuals, the community,
the federal government, and various religious organs
should exercise over the way an individual can alter
his biological make-up.
Because many people are unfamiliar with genetic
engineering, Dr. Lederberg stated that some of them
react in horror to the thought of interfering with the
genetic biology of an individual; yet, paradoxically,
they have no objection as to how that same individual
is educated. He feels that often a person's education
is far more deterministic than any kind of biological
tampering could be.
Role of Environment
Culture, language, religion, life styles are in all
societies regenerated and reinforced to the degree
that, as Lederberg stated, "You are more like any av
erage member of your class at Stanford than you would
be like your identical twin if your identical twin were
reared in China."
Environment plays as great a role in determining
the characteristics of a human being as does the genetic
make-up of that person.
"This may seem deterministic," he said, "and you
may rebel against the idea of being determined by
your education. However, should you have been set
adrift in a boat on the Atlantic Ocean during the first

ten years of your life, left free to develop as you wish,
you wouldn't have survived five minutes."
'Genetic Engineering'
Despite the fact that education and culture play
such a major role in the character development of an
individual, genetic engineering can still play an im
portant role in shaping him.
Dr. Lederberg outlined some theories of genetic en
gineering which may be realized within the next five
to twenty years.
As an extension to the concept of vaccination, sci
entists are in the process of applying "genetic engineer
ing" to viruses, he said. He gave as proto-type example
the production of a virus that restored the capacity
to make enzymes that are missing in some genetic
diseases of mental retardation like PKU.
As another example, he commented that fetal diag
noses of genetic diseases have already been done within
the first trimester of the pregnancy. He projected one
course of action for a couple who knew themselves
to be carriers of a hereditary disease like cystic fi
brosis.

we know very little about the
neurology of intelligence, he
commented.
Dr. Lederberg proposed that
the way an individual can ex
press his feelings about the con
trol of his environment and its

forces of indoctrination is
through forms of social protest.
"If there are ways in which
you have been over-determined,
if your personality has been
warped or thwarted by the kind
of milieu in which you live, then
say so." He stressed that an in
dividual should try to utilize
whatever resources he has left
to understand how he came into
his present situation, and how to
reach a better one.

Imagine there is an individual whom you admire and
whose genetic traits interest you. Within the near fu
ture it is not inconceivable that you may endow your
own child with those particular genetic traits.
With such possibilities for human genetic interven
tion, Dr. Joshua Lederberg raised the question of
"what role should man play in determining his own
future?"
Dr. Lederberg believes that a key issue is deciding
how much "control" other individuals, the community,
the federal government, and various religious organs
should exercise over the way an individual can alter
his biological make-up.
Because many people are unfamiliar with genetic
engineering, Dr. Lederberg stated that some of them
react in horror to the thought of interfering with the
genetic biology of an individual; yet, paradoxically,
they have no objection as to how that same individual
is educated. He feels that often a person's education
is far more deterministic than any kind of biological
tampering could be.
Role of Environment
Culture, language, religion, life styles are in all
societies regenerated and reinforced to the degree
that, as Lederberg stated, "You are more like any av
erage member of your class at Stanford than you would
be like your identical twin if your identical twin were
reared in China."
Environment plays as great a role in determining
the characteristics of a human being as does the genetic
make-up of that person.
"This may seem deterministic," he said, "and you
may rebel against the idea of being determined by
your education. However, should you have been set
adrift in a boat on the Atlantic Ocean during the first

ten years of your life, left free to develop as you wish,
you wouldn't have survived five minutes."
'Genetic Engineering'
Despite the fact that education and culture play
such a major role in the character development of an
individual, genetic engineering can still play an im
portant role in shaping him.
Dr. Lederberg outlined some theories of genetic en
gineering which may be realized within the next five
to twenty years.
As an extension to the concept of vaccination, sci
entists are in the process of applying "genetic engineer
ing" to viruses, he said. He gave as proto-type example
the production of a virus that restored the capacity
to make enzymes that are missing in some genetic
diseases of mental retardation like PKU.
As another example, he commented that fetal diag
noses of genetic diseases have already been done within
the first trimester of the pregnancy. He projected one
course of action for a couple who knew themselves
to be carriers of a hereditary disease like cystic fi
brosis.
Possibility of Abortion
Cystic fibrosis is a generalized disease of the exo
crine glands affecting primarily the digestive tract
and the lungs. It carries a high mortality rate in in
fants.
"If a couple knew that they were both carriers of
the disease, and there was a one-in-four chance of
cystic fibrosis in the offspring, this possibility could
be investigated (fetal diagnosis), and if found to be
true, the couple could weigh the possibilities of an
abortion."
Dr. Lederberg said that he was not necessarily advo
cating this type of action, but that it could become an
important development within five to ten years.
The possibility of applying ,such techniques now is
limited by the existing abortion laws in this country
as well as the attitudes of the Catholic Church.
Boundaries of Life
Traditional Catholic doctrine has been to define life
from the moment of conception. Dr. Lederberg stressed
the importance of having some concensus about the

boundaries of lite, but he doubted that the community
would insist on placing it so early in the pregnancy.
He termed a l'etus a part of a woman's body, and up
to some stage in the pregnancy has about as much
right to independent existence as does the tip of her
finger.
Dr. Lederberg said that the most cogent objection
to the present law is that it is unenforceable. There
are many illegal abortions performed on a "class dis
criminatory basis," and he feels that the practice ought
to be rationalized by the law.
He believes that the government ought to be limited
in exercising its jurisdiction over questions concerning
a moral or individual choice, and raised the possibility
that such laws could be over-policed.
He asks why the state has to be involved when there
are other factors. Our moral sense is determined by
ourselves, by our interactions with other people, and
by our religious and ethical codes, and he feels that the
ultimate decisions should be left up to the individual.
Need for Restriction
However, in keeping with the whole process of indi
vidual liberty, Dr. Lederberg recognized the need for
certain restrictions. As one example, he stressed that
heart transplantation involves the rights of at least
three individuals â€” the recipient, the donor, and the
doctor.
Yet, in view of the sudden demand for more hearts
than can be supplied, he acknowledged the possibility
of some form of regulation. Lederberg believes he may
have been the first person to raise the questions of
the availablity of hearts for transplant at a symposium
in London six years ago. The first heart transplants
were actually made last year.
"I don't think that there is an answer to that ques
tion, and 1 think it will have to be evaded, rather than
solved," He has made two specific recommendations to
Congress since that time: that we concentrate not on
heart transplants, but on mechanical hearts; and that
we consider that kind of scientific effort that would
make it possible to use animal hearts instead of hu
man hearts. He stated a reluctance of many people to
readily accept such techniques.
"The tirst heart transplant
could not have been done in this
country, although Dr. Norman
Shumway was technically ready
to do it long ago." He feels that
the reason the first transplant
was performed in South Africa
was that Barnard was able to
act independently, and that the
social pressure in South Africa
against such an operation was
less than in the U.S.
Gradual Acceptance
"Any kind of technical advance
requires a gradual process for
its acceptance," Dr. Lederberg
said. "Part of the same progress
of biological science that pro
vides heart transplants and nu
clear transplantation encompass
very special procedures, and

some of them can be life saving
in a way that no one denies," he
added.
"We have to make very care
fully thought out decisions with
regard to each of these," he
said, "and not label them all
together in some fuzzy category
of new-fangled tampering with
people."
In regard to studies on genet
ic differences, Dr. Lederberg was
asked to comment on Dr. Wil
liam Shockley's recent state
ments on race and intelligence.
Lederberg feels that the psy
cho - social parameters are so
many that at present we cannot
make any useful observations
concerning the genetics of racial
differences in people. He stated
that there is possibly a misun

derstanding of the substance of
Shockley's proposals.
Dr. Lederberg, however, de
nounced "loose talk intended to
humiliate Blacks when we have
no scientific basis to attribute
their difficult social and econom
ic status to genetic factors other
than their skin color."
Specific Potentialities
"I don't quarrel with the con
ception that one ought to do sci
entific investigation of the dif
ferences among people," he com
mented. He pointed out that you
have to understand the specific
potentialities of people in order
to give them equal opportunity.
Dr. Lederberg gave an example
concerning congenital deafness.
"If you did not know that
some children were congenitally

deaf, and you said that the re
sponsibility for equal oppor
tunity was simply to give them
all equal access to the same form
of classrooms, and the same
form of eduaction, would you
really be giving deaf children
equal opportunities?" he asks.
"You have to know what it is
they are suffering from in order
to give them the special train
ing that is required for the prob
lem."
Whereas we know something
about the neurology of deafness,
we know very little about the
neurology of intelligence, he
commented.
Dr. Lederberg proposed that
the way an individual can ex
press his feelings about the con
trol of his environment and its

forces of indoctrination is

"If there are ways in which

have been the first person to raise the questions of
the availablity of hearts for transplant at a symposium
in London six years ago. The first heart transplants
were actually made last year.
"I don't think that there is an answer to that ques
tion, and 1 think it will have to be evaded, rather than
solved," He has made two specific recommendations to
Congress since that time: that we concentrate not on
heart transplants, but on mechanical hearts; and that
we consider that kind of scientific effort that would
make it possible to use animal hearts instead of hu
man hearts. He stated a reluctance of many people to
readily accept such techniques.
"The tirst heart transplant
could not have been done in this
country, although Dr. Norman
Shumway was technically ready
to do it long ago." He feels that
the reason the first transplant
was performed in South Africa
was that Barnard was able to
act independently, and that the
social pressure in South Africa
against such an operation was
less than in the U.S.
Gradual Acceptance
"Any kind of technical advance
requires a gradual process for
its acceptance," Dr. Lederberg
said. "Part of the same progress
of biological science that pro
vides heart transplants and nu
clear transplantation encompass
very special procedures, and

some of them can be life saving
in a way that no one denies," he
added.
"We have to make very care
fully thought out decisions with
regard to each of these," he
said, "and not label them all
together in some fuzzy category
of new-fangled tampering with
people."
In regard to studies on genet
ic differences, Dr. Lederberg was
asked to comment on Dr. Wil
liam Shockley's recent state
ments on race and intelligence.
Lederberg feels that the psy
cho - social parameters are so
many that at present we cannot
make any useful observations
concerning the genetics of racial
differences in people. He stated
that there is possibly a misun

derstanding of the substance of
Shockley's proposals.
Dr. Lederberg, however, de
nounced "loose talk intended to
humiliate Blacks when we have
no scientific basis to attribute
their difficult social and econom
ic status to genetic factors other
than their skin color."
Specific Potentialities
"I don't quarrel with the con
ception that one ought to do sci
entific investigation of the dif
ferences among people," he com
mented. He pointed out that you
have to understand the specific
potentialities of people in order
to give them equal opportunity.
Dr. Lederberg gave an example
concerning congenital deafness.
"If you did not know that
some children were congenitally

deaf, and you said that the re
sponsibility for equal oppor
tunity was simply to give them
all equal access to the same form
of classrooms, and the same
form of eduaction, would you
really be giving deaf children
equal opportunities?" he asks.
"You have to know what it is
they are suffering from in order
to give them the special train
ing that is required for the prob
lem."
Whereas we know something
about the neurology of deafness,
we know very little about the
neurology of intelligence, he
commented.
Dr. Lederberg proposed that
the way an individual can ex
press his feelings about the con
trol of his environment and its

forces of indoctrination is
through forms of social protest.
"If there are ways in which
you have been over-determined,
if your personality has been
warped or thwarted by the kind
of milieu in which you live, then
say so." He stressed that an in
dividual should try to utilize
whatever resources he has left
to understand how he came into
his present situation, and how to
reach a better one.
