• Fote Humphrey
Editor, The Daily:
Perhaps it is not now too late
to make an appeal to action in
today's election. I only ask that
all of those fretful, petulant lib
erals vote for Humphrey.
I speak now as a liberal. There
is a difference between Hum
phrey and Nixon and if you
can't see it then your radicalism
has blinded you.
Humphrey may not be as lib
eral as you may like. (Remem
ber, he is as old as your parents
and you know about them.) But
he was once very liberal and
still has a liberal attitude. I feel
that he will be more amenable
to seeing and solving the prob
lems that plague our country
than Nixon will.
I speak now as a black per
son. White middle-class liberals
can afford the luxury of put
ting up with Nixon for four or
eight years. Black people can
not. Where are the near-maso
chistic liberals now that we need
them? If you REALLY want to
help black people then get out
and vote.
Think not only of how this
election will affect you, but con
sider its repercussions. Having
the courage of your convictions
is a virtue; being plain stub
born is a vice. Virtue may not
yet be outmoded. Please get out
and vote.

• Dismayed By Brown
Editor, The Daily:
I was dismayed by Robert Mc-
Afee Brown's letter to the Daily
on Friday, November 1, outlin
ing his views of the alternatives
open to McCarthy liberals on
November 5.
It is tragic when the ideals of
men of such persuasive moral
force prevent them from accept
ing the final realities through
which their ideals must work in
order to achieve any measure of
realization.

A vote for Mr. Humphrey on
November 5 is an obvious com
promise for many, the necessity
of which should have been rec
ognized immediately after Chi
cago, if not before.
That it "cannot be justified on
positive grounds" is a ludicrous
conclusion, given Humphrey's
outstanding liberal record of
the past twenty years and the
broad hints that he has given as
to what his future policies will
be, if elected president.
By indulging in 'bleeding
heart' liberalism, Mr. Brown
seemingly refuses to face these
realities squarely and encour
ages the futile gesture of a
write-in vote for McCarthy —
a gesture which could only lead
to the doubtless election of
Richard Nixon.
I am reminded of the words of
Reinhold Niebuhr, brought to
my attention recently in this
same context, which may be of
some relevance to Mr. Brown's
dilemma: "choosing the lesser
of two evils may be the most
important choice of all."

• Election Reality
Editor, The Daily:
Could the Harvard Crimson
and The Stanford Daily both be
wrong? Both have refused to en
dorse a presidential candidate,
because, as The Daily put it,"It
is too late to accept the least of
three evils."
Perhaps the statement should
be rephrased to read, "It is not
too late to give your support to
the worst or second worst of
three evils."
Is that what The Daily urges?
Many of us who will vote to
day have also felt the anguish
of war, the bestiality of Chicago,
the absurdity of the current hier
archy of national priorities, and
the ugly face of racism still pres
ent in our society and our insti
tutions. But does all of this add
up to "Count me out"?
For students, today is a time
of aesthetic politics. Like oth
ers, I, too, feel revulsion in the
pit of my stomach when I see
Humphrey on TV. It would be
so simple not to vote; I could,
after all, preserve my "purity."
But what of the realities?

It is easy for Stanford stu
dents to say it will make no dif
ference who is President. For
them, it might not. But for the
black schoolchildren in the
South, for the poor in the ghet
to, for those dependent on food
stamp programs for food, is
there really no difference be
tween the candidates?
How many black children must
be denied a decent education for
us to preserve our moral purity?
Even Stanford students might
be affected by the foreign poli
cy of our next President. Cer
tainly those in Latin America
will be. (Nixon urges not more
foreign aid, but greater "free
dom of trade." Ponder what free
dom of trade means to United
Fruit, or the oil companies.)
How unimportant, really, is
the Non - Proliferation Treaty?
What will be the social cost (as
well as the effect on our se
curity) of a renewed arms race
for nuclear superiority?
Should we really vote "No" in
the Presidential election today?
Perhaps it would be worthwhile
to reflect on the words of Camus,
to the effect that though there
will always be starving children
in the world, one can work to re
duce their number.
In fact, there is no way to
avoid voting. If you stay home,
you will be casting an indirect

vote for two of the candidates.
To sacrifice the real difference
the election of Humphrey instead
of Nixon would make to millions
of living, breathing human be
ings is a high price to pay for
moral purity.
Someone once wrote that all
it takes for evil to triumph is
for good men to remain silent.
When considering whether or
not to vote "No" today, look in
to your heart and ask yourself
in all honesty, "Is there really
no difference?"
The lives of millions of people,
not just in the U.S., will be vi
tally affected bv your answer.

• Timmy Haight
Editor, The Dally:
Re: Haight
Golly, gee, Timmy. These ex
pletives have served you so well
and now you want to make them
shockless.
You'll just have to get a sub
stitute. How about "haight" for
a starter? Come to think of it,
that has already become jaded.
ROBERT BENTLEY

This may be election day, but it is not too late to add a
few words for an important local candidate.
Martin Gorfinkel was a McCarthy supporter who sub
scribes to the "new politics" notion that men in public of
fice must be responsive to people and public opinion. Gor
finkel's campaign reflects that interest in openness and re
sponsiveness.
Gorfinkel stands clearly for academic freedom. He has
spoken out against "interference" on the part of elected
officials. He favors the 18-year-old vote, legalization of mari
juana, restriction on gun usage by citizens and police, an
extension of educational opportunities for all young people.
Because of his forthright stands on the issues, we en
courage a vote for Martin Gorfinkel for Assembly from the
22nd District. Besides, we like his sideburns.
