# GOD'S COUNTRY
## 
### Philip Taubman 
Getting away from campus
for a day can put things in per
spective, particularly if one trav
els to "God's country."
As the ranger said, "Yup
folks, this here's God's country.
You won't find any nicer. Lot
o' folks coming up here from
San Jose and Palo Alto to
breathe the fresh air and settle
down."
"God's country" was discov
ered by Sir Francis Drake in
1579 as he paused off the Cali
fornia coast on his way around
the globe. He left behind a
bronze plaque claiming the land
for "Her Royal Majesty, Queen
Elizabeth I."
Unfortunately for the English
empire and Sir Francis, the
plaque lay buried in the sand
until 1933. But "God's country"
was yet to have its day. In 1967
a second bronze plaque was
mounted by no less an historical
figure than Mrs. Lyndon Baines
Johnson.
The earthy object of such ex
tensive kudos and bronze work,
and the subject of such an acci
dental and unfortunate history
is Point Reyes National Sea
shore.
The Point Reyes peninsula
juts into the Pacific 32 miles
north of San Francisco. It can
be easily and most scenically
reached via California Highway
1. The drive in early November,
however, is quite out of the or
dinary, even for the dramatic
coast road. The extra attractions
come from a mixture of what
has been left behind in Palo
Alto and what one finds along
the coast.
Leaving Stanford these days
can be a pleasure, if not a neces
sity. Studying history, for ex
ample, becomes an entirely con
fused, complex, and somewhat
embarrassing proposition when
one's exams in German history
begin sprouting rushed mistakes
such as "SDS" in place of "SPD"
(Social Democratic Party), or
"SES" finds its misdirected way
into a Second Reich constitution
al crisis.
The Bayshore Freeway, for all
its lopsided seams, uneven sur
face, and dashing cowboy driv
ers, is an effective way of get
ting Stanford out of one's mind,
even if the treatment, at times,

involves near accident and total
fright. Once across the Golden
Gate, with the pleasure of no
Northbound toll, a new world
enters the eye and eventually
the mind.
It is a green world. Palo Alto,
for all its magnificent sunshine,
often appears to border on a
desert environment. From May
until December the grass, most
evident in the foothills, wilts in
to what local natives describe as
"gold" but what appears awfully
brown to a cynical New Yorker.
The Stanford campus is an
oasis in green, and, after a walk
in the foothills, often appears
strikingly similar to false eye
lashes. The green hills and val
leys bordering Route 1 have
no such pretentiousness. The
healthy and thriving chlorophyll
is not nourished by man's
sprinklers. For some meteor
logical reason, undoubtedly be
yond even the comprehension
of television's weather sages, it
has been raining along the coast
north of San Francisco, or at
least there has been heavy fog.
Having the eye engulfed by
green in all directions consti

tutes a leap in time. A month
or more must pass before Stan
ford's hills glow an iridescent,
kelly green. For a transplanted
easterner, the normal wait is
until May, so with only a little
imagination, and a good deal
more hope, one can mentally by
pass many weeks, if just for a
mile or two.
Point Reyes is a magnificent
combination of endless empty
beaches, rolling hills occasion
ally dotted with dairy farms, and
broad vistas untouched by the
hand of man. It is truly a wilder
ness seashore.
Gazing through the mist at
Drake's Bay, one can be alone
in a way the word "alone" does
not exist at Stanford. It is pos
sible, for an evanescent moment,
to seriously scan the bay in
search of Sir Francis's ship, the
Golden Hinde.
Reality, Stanford, and auto
matic sprinklers insist the
search is in vain. Standing silent
ly amid wind, surf, and empty
space at Point Reyes, one can
wonder.
The Twentieth Century af
fords few such times and places.

Leaving Stanford these days
can be a pleasure, if not a neces

The Bayshore Freeway, for all
its lopsided seams, uneven sur

even if the treatment, at times,

fright. Once across the Golden
Gate, with the pleasure of no
Northbound toll, a new world
enters the eye and eventually
the mind.
It is a green world. Palo Alto,
for all its magnificent sunshine,
often appears to border on a
desert environment. From May
until December the grass, most
evident in the foothills, wilts in
to what local natives describe as
"gold" but what appears awfully
brown to a cynical New Yorker.
The Stanford campus is an
oasis in green, and, after a walk
in the foothills, often appears
strikingly similar to false eye
lashes. The green hills and val
leys bordering Route 1 have
no such pretentiousness. The
healthy and thriving chlorophyll
is not nourished by man's
sprinklers. For some meteor
logical reason, undoubtedly be
yond even the comprehension
of television's weather sages, it
has been raining along the coast
north of San Francisco, or at
least there has been heavy fog.
Having the eye engulfed by
green in all directions consti

tutes a leap in time. A month
or more must pass before Stan
ford's hills glow an iridescent,
kelly green. For a transplanted
easterner, the normal wait is
until May, so with only a little
imagination, and a good deal
more hope, one can mentally by
pass many weeks, if just for a
mile or two.
Point Reyes is a magnificent
combination of endless empty
beaches, rolling hills occasion

broad vistas untouched by the

Gazing through the mist at
Drake's Bay, one can be alone
in a way the word "alone" does
not exist at Stanford. It is pos
sible, for an evanescent moment,
to seriously scan the bay in
search of Sir Francis's ship, the
Golden Hinde.
Reality, Stanford, and auto

search is in vain. Standing silent

for a day can put things in per

As the ranger said, "Yup

"God's country" was discov

1579 as he paused off the Cali
fornia coast on his way around
the globe. He left behind a
bronze plaque claiming the land
for "Her Royal Majesty, Queen
Elizabeth I."
Unfortunately for the English
empire and Sir Francis, the
plaque lay buried in the sand
until 1933. But "God's country"
was yet to have its day. In 1967
a second bronze plaque was
mounted by no less an historical

Johnson.

healthy and thriving chlorophyll
is not nourished by man's
sprinklers. For some meteor
logical reason, undoubtedly be
yond even the comprehension
of television's weather sages, it
has been raining along the coast
north of San Francisco, or at
least there has been heavy fog.
Having the eye engulfed by
green in all directions consti

tutes a leap in time. A month
or more must pass before Stan
ford's hills glow an iridescent,
kelly green. For a transplanted
easterner, the normal wait is
until May, so with only a little
imagination, and a good deal
more hope, one can mentally by
pass many weeks, if just for a
mile or two.
Point Reyes is a magnificent
combination of endless empty
beaches, rolling hills occasion
ally dotted with dairy farms, and
broad vistas untouched by the
hand of man. It is truly a wilder
ness seashore.
Gazing through the mist at
Drake's Bay, one can be alone
in a way the word "alone" does
not exist at Stanford. It is pos
sible, for an evanescent moment,
to seriously scan the bay in
search of Sir Francis's ship, the
Golden Hinde.
Reality, Stanford, and auto
matic sprinklers insist the
search is in vain. Standing silent
ly amid wind, surf, and empty
space at Point Reyes, one can
wonder.
The Twentieth Century af
fords few such times and places.
