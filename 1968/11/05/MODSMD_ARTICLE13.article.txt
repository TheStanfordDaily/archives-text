## Boycotters Meet Opponents 
### LANG ATWOOD 
Members and supporters of
the Stanford Grape Boycott
Committee held a "park-in" at a
local Safeway supermarket Fri
day afternoon and were met by a
counter group of anti-boycott
students.
The anti-boycott students were
led by John Manoogian, a Stan
ford economics major. His
father, a grape grower, recently
charged Alan Rader of the Stan
ford group with distorting the
grape issue in a letter published
by The Daily.
The anti-boycott group came
"to buy grapes and stand around
and watch," according to an un
identified grape supporter.
Their appearance came as a
surprise to many boycotters, but
provided no cause for alarm.
"I'm glad they came. They didn't
identify themselves; they're just
standing out in front with the
rest of us. If they came with
picket signs, I'd be worried,"
stated Doron Weinberg, a Stan
ford law student and an organiz
er of the boycott.
"All of these short-hairs make
us look like a very dignified
movement," he added.
Boycott Successes
The boycott, organized and
supported primarily by Stanford
law school students, has suc
ceeded in having grapes removed
from the shelves of several local
stores.
The previously boycotted Safe
way stores in Palo Alto and
Menlo Park no longer have
grapes for sale. Officially they
are "out-of-season" and no long
er available. A check with a pro
duce distribution center in San
Francisco revealed, however,
that there are enough grapes in

cold storage for "several
months."
The "park-in" tactic used Fri
day failed to affect shoppers ar
riving at the store, who were
able to locate parking places at
all times.
More than a dozen shopping
carts full of groceries were left
in the aisles of the store as the
result of a "shop-in."
More Controversy
Colin Gain, manager of the
store at 1980 O'Conner St. in
Palo Alto observed the actions of
the boycott and anti-boycott
groups but had no comment.

A San Mateo County Sheriff's
car also observed the store but
took no action during the "park
in."
Each side defended its posi
tions against arguments from
the other group. A boycott sup
porter repeated that the union
just wants to hold elections to
see if the workers want to be
organized.
Martin Taylor, a Stanford stu
dent, charged that "Chavez (a
union organizer) is another
Wallace, or worse. He's a man
out for his own power. I find it
hard to believe he is working for
the benefit of all grape workers."
