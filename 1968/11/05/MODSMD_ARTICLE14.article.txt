### 
The results of the first day of
voting in the Red Hot Prof Con
test shows Eva Augsberger, a
former German instructor, in
the lead with 525 votes. Second
and third places are held by
Catholic chaplain Fr. James Dur
yea with 470 and former Presi
dent Wallace Sterling with 347
votes.
Last place is claimed by Coach
John Ralston. Perhaps his nega
tive 38 votes reflect the unsuc
cessful attempts of the last two
weekends to lead his favored
team to victory. The daughter
of the executive head of the eco
nomics department, Lorie Tars
his, holds the second to the last
place with negative 12 votes.
Trailing close behind with nega
tive 10 votes is Robert Walker,
Director of Overseas Campuses
and General Studies.
The polls will be open from
9 to 3:30 p.m. daily until Thurs
day. A positive vote costs a
penny, a negative vote a nickel,
and a quarter pays for a nomi
nation. Proceeds of the contest,
sponsored by the International
Student Fund, will aid students
in Asia.
