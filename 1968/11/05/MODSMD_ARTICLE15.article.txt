# Cranston Leads
## State Poll: HHH-Nixon Tied 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Vice
President Hubert Humphrey has
climbed within one percentage
point of his Republican oppon
ent, Richard M. Nixon, in the
race for California's presidential
vote, the State Poll reported
yesterday.
The poll also found Democrat
Alan Cranston with a command
ing 14-point lead over Max Raf
ferty, his Republican opponent
for the U.S. Senate.
It said voters intend to reject
one property tax relief measure,
Prop. 9, and adopt the other,
Prop. 1-A.
The poll, conducted by Don
M. Muchmore and published in
the Los Angeles Times, was
based on interviews with 1,007
voters Friday and Saturday —
after Thursday's announcement
of the U.S. bombing halt in
North Vietnam.
Almost Equal
The poll gave Nixon 43 per
cent of the vote, Humphrey 42
per cent and third-party candi
date George Wallace 4 per cent.
Thus, Humphrey has gained
nine points since Oct. 12, when
the poll showed him with 35

per cent of the vote and Nixon
with 45 per cent. The standard
deviation in a three-way race is
4 per cent.
Two per cent of the voters in
the latest poll said they would
vote for none of the three candi
dates, and 9 per cent was unde
cided.
Cranston Thoughtful
Cranston ended his U.S. Sen
ate campaign in a thoughtful
mood, talking about peace and
how to achieve it, the draft and
how to end it and the arms race
and how to stop it.
Cranston said he found Vice
President Hubert Humphrey
similarly reflective as they rode
under a shower of shredded pa
per thrown on their motorcade
from the tops and windows of
downtown buildings.
Their thoughts turned from
what they might have done bet
ter in the Democratic campaigns
to "what can be done in office
if it's won." Cranston said.
Rafferty
Rafferty, in an election eve bid
for support, wound up a bitterly
contested race by predicting he
would beat Democrat Alan

Cranston by a landslide 250,000
votes.
In each of the five cities he
visited Monday in a whirlwind
aerial stumping tour, Rafferty
denounced polls showing him
trailing and predicted that con
fidence in local polls is being
destroyed.
He also blasted Cranston as a
man who would stifle free
speech and one who supports an
advocate of violence.
Expressing confidence that
GOP Presidential candidate
Richard M. Nixon would win
California, Rafferty said it
would "make no sense" for the
state voters not to send Rafferty
to Washington to aid a Republi
can administration.
Welcome At Ontario
Rafferty got his biggest wel
come at smog-bound Ontario
airport, where about 150 sup
porters cheered and serenaded
him.
Conspicuous at the greeting
site were many uniformed and
plainclothes police, who stood
every few feet on roofs and at
doors.
Rafferty had begun the day
attacking the polls that have
shown him trailing Cranston.
"We no longer have any ques
tion about the election," he told
a Chico news conference on the
first stop of a last-day aerial
tour of the state.
Cleaver Issue
The Republican, who is state
superintendent of public instruc
tion, said one purpose of hi s
tour was to discuss the refusal
of some radio stations and news
papers to carry an advertise
ment that stated Rafferty's op
ponent favored the University
of California lectures of Black
Panther Eldridge Cleaver.
Cranston denied he favored
the lectures.
Rafferty told an Oakland air
port conference that the news
media were guilty of stifling
free speech and that if elected
to the Senate he would call for
an investigation.
He added that the media had
been "terrorized" by Cranston's
threat to sue them if they ran
the ad.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Vice
President Hubert Humphrey has
climbed within one percentage
point of his Republican oppon
ent, Richard M. Nixon, in the
race for California's presidential
vote, the State Poll reported
yesterday.
The poll also found Democrat
Alan Cranston with a command
ing 14-point lead over Max Raf
ferty, his Republican opponent
for the U.S. Senate.
It said voters intend to reject
one property tax relief measure,
Prop. 9, and adopt the other,
Prop. 1-A.
The poll, conducted by Don
M. Muchmore and published in
the Los Angeles Times, was
based on interviews with 1,007
voters Friday and Saturday —
after Thursday's announcement
of the U.S. bombing halt in
North Vietnam.
Almost Equal
The poll gave Nixon 43 per
cent of the vote, Humphrey 42
per cent and third-party candi
date George Wallace 4 per cent.
Thus, Humphrey has gained
nine points since Oct. 12, when
the poll showed him with 35

per cent of the vote and Nixon
with 45 per cent. The standard
deviation in a three-way race is
4 per cent.
Two per cent of the voters in
the latest poll said they would
vote for none of the three candi
dates, and 9 per cent was unde
cided.
Cranston Thoughtful
Cranston ended his U.S. Sen
ate campaign in a thoughtful
mood, talking about peace and
how to achieve it, the draft and
how to end it and the arms race
and how to stop it.
Cranston said he found Vice
President Hubert Humphrey
similarly reflective as they rode
under a shower of shredded pa
per thrown on their motorcade
from the tops and windows of
downtown buildings.
Their thoughts turned from
what they might have done bet
ter in the Democratic campaigns
to "what can be done in office
if it's won." Cranston said.
Rafferty
Rafferty, in an election eve bid
for support, wound up a bitterly
contested race by predicting he
would beat Democrat Alan

Cranston by a landslide 250,000
votes.
In each of the five cities he
visited Monday in a whirlwind
aerial stumping tour, Rafferty
denounced polls showing him
trailing and predicted that con
fidence in local polls is being
destroyed.
He also blasted Cranston as a
man who would stifle free
speech and one who supports an
advocate of violence.
Expressing confidence that
GOP Presidential candidate
Richard M. Nixon would win
California, Rafferty said it
would "make no sense" for the
state voters not to send Rafferty
to Washington to aid a Republi
can administration.
Welcome At Ontario
Rafferty got his biggest wel
come at smog-bound Ontario
airport, where about 150 sup
porters cheered and serenaded
him.
Conspicuous at the greeting
site were many uniformed and
plainclothes police, who stood
every few feet on roofs and at
doors.
Rafferty had begun the day
attacking the polls that have
shown him trailing Cranston.
"We no longer have any ques
tion about the election," he told
a Chico news conference on the
first stop of a last-day aerial
tour of the state.
Cleaver Issue
The Republican, who is state
superintendent of public instruc
tion, said one purpose of hi s
tour was to discuss the refusal
of some radio stations and news
papers to carry an advertise
ment that stated Rafferty's op
ponent favored the University
of California lectures of Black
Panther Eldridge Cleaver.
Cranston denied he favored
the lectures.
Rafferty told an Oakland air
port conference that the news
media were guilty of stifling
free speech and that if elected
to the Senate he would call for
an investigation.
He added that the media had
been "terrorized" by Cranston's
threat to sue them if they ran
the ad.
