# Opportunistic Cal Frosh Squeak By Papooses, 12-9
## 
### BOB FEDUNIAK 
Timely errors proved fatal
yesterday as the Stanford fresh
man football team blew a 9-0
halftime lead en route to a 12-9
defeat at the hands of the Cali
fornia Frosh.
Stanford seemed to have the
game under control in the open
ing half, despite being unable
to move the ball consistently.
The Indians got on the score
board early when Greg Sampson
booted an impressive 42-yard
field goal just four minutes after
the opening kickoff.
91-Yard Score
Then with :56 left in the first
period and Stanford seemingly
bottled up deep in their own
territory, QB Ted Bleymaier un
corked a 91-yard touchdown pass
to split end Dave Magruder, who
easily outdistanced the Cal sec
ondary to complete the Pa
poose's longest play from scrim
mage in recent years.
Meanwhile, the Indian defense
was doing a creditable job of
holding the Bears in check. Play
ing with their third and fourth
string quarterbacks, the Cal
aerial attack worried only the
Cal coach, as Stanford concen
trated effectively on containing
the run.

But midway through the third
period the complexion of the
game changed abruptly. Cal
picked up over hall of their to
tal passing yardage on a 46-yard
toss from Sam Garamendi to
end Jim Reed which put the ball
on the Indian 26. Eight plays
later, halfback Tim Todd scored
on a one foot plunge, narrowing
the gap to 9-6.
Cal TD Nullified
Five minutes later the Indians
were rescued from another dis
aster, but narrowly failed in
their attempt to convert their
good fortune into points. Mo
ments after having a 51-yard
touchdown pass called back by
a penalty, Cal punted to Stan
ford's Mike Kloos, who made a
beautiful runback to the Bear
Eight.
The Indians then ran four
straight power plays, gained
only six yards, and gave the ball
to the Bears on their own two.
Likewise unable to move the
ball, Cal was forced to punt
from deep in their own terri
tory.
The ball travelled only to the
Bear 35, but it bounced off a
Stanford player and was recov
ered by Cal. Five plays later,
Todd scored his second TD of
the morning on a beautiful half
back reverse with 10:55 left to
play.
Last Gasp
Shortly thereafter, the
Papooses put together their best
drive of the day and almost
pulled out the victory. Bleyma
ier, who was responsible for 220
yards with 11 completions, hit
flanker Don Alvarado with two
passes for 41 yards to put the
ball on the Cal 19.
Then Magruder made his sec
ond spectacular grab of the
game to give Stanford a first
and goal at the four. But two
plays later, Bleymaier's throw
was stolen at the goal line to
kill the Indian's final threat.

OOF! — Stanford goalie Banks Beasley grimaces as he bats away
a shot by an unidentified SC Trojan near the end of the first half
of Saturday's conference match.
Beasley was hot and cold, making several brilliant saves as the
Tribe took a 1-0 first quarter lead. The roof caved in in the second
and third quarters, however, as SC notched 8 goals. His shutout
effort in the final period was in vain as the Tribe lost 8-7.
