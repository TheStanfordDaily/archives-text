# Bad Passes Hurt
## USC Poloists Hold Off Indians, 8-7 
### FRED MANN 
The league leading USC water
polo team got its biggest scare
of the season Saturday from a
fired up Stanford Varsity. The
Trojans took an early 8-3 lead
and held on through a torrid fi
nal quarter to win 8-7 in the
most exciting finish of the year.
Again the Tribe suffered from
not being able to put a complete
game together. Weak defense
and poor passing in the second
and third quarters gave USC an
insurmountable advantage.
But when Coach Jim Gaugh
ran's squad comes alive and con
quers these problems, they are
an amazing group. In the fourth
period the Cards banged in four
goals, shut out the TYojans, in
tercepted nine USC passes and
were close to the tying tally
three other times.
Tribe Strikes First
The contest started with a
quick goal by Stanford's Rob
Jensen and remained relatively
even for the rest of the first
quarter. The Trojans settled
down in their ball control style
of play and the Indians immedi
ately started pressing all over
the pool.
The first stanza ended with
Stanford in the lead thanks to
the brilliant play of goalie Banks

Beasley. Constantly pressured
by the big Trojans, he made
numerous fine saves, taking
away at least two all-but-certain
goals for the visitors.
The second quarter was a dif
ferent story. The extremely phy
sical Trojans came alive and
started dumping in goals. Bob
Watson had put the visitors on
the scoreboard after only one
minute had elapsed with a tricky
delay shot from five feet out.
Stanford drives into scoring
territory were stopped by the
alert SC defense. With the Tro
jans controlling the tempo of
the game, they scored three
quick goals half way through
the period, from close, middle,
and long range. The inept In

dian passing gave SC constant
scoring opportunities of which
they gladly took advantage. Just
before half time, the Cards' Tom
Hill finally connected on a long
shot to keep Stanford in the ball
game.
SC Spree
A questionable SC goal opened
the second half and started the
leaders off on another scoring
spree. It was ruled that Wat
son's lob shot did hit in the goal
for a point and gave his team a
5-2 advantage.
Although the Tribe's defense
did tighten up, the passing was
still sloppy and hurt the offen
sive drives. Dick Fink rammed
in two goals in a row for the
visitors and then followed it up

by hitting a penalty shot to give
Troy a commanding six goal
lead.
Stanford was unable to move
the ball past half court and
seemed doomed to suffer a huge
defeat. The only third quarter
score for the Indians came when
Hill connected on a penalty shot.
Band Arrives
The fourth quarter was
marked by the arrival of the
Stanford band and their off-key
music and cheering seemed to
spark the Varsity. The final pe
riod belonged only to Stanford.

Ken Terry scored for the Tribe,
then intercepted to set up a Hill
goal. After two more Stanford
steals, Terry hit again to close
the gap to two. Still another
Card interception set up a goal
by Rick Eagleston with 1:25 re
maining.
With SC trying desperately to
hold on to the ball, they fouled,
giving Stanford one more
chance to tie the game. But a
lob pass near the goal was
picked off by the Trojans who
ran out the remaining 30 sec
onds of play and left the pool—
thankful to be alive.

Trojans took an early 8-3 lead
and held on through a torrid fi
nal quarter to win 8-7 in the
most exciting finish of the year.
Again the Tribe suffered from
not being able to put a complete
game together. Weak defense
and poor passing in the second
and third quarters gave USC an
insurmountable advantage.
But when Coach Jim Gaugh
ran's squad comes alive and con
quers these problems, they are
an amazing group. In the fourth
period the Cards banged in four
goals, shut out the TYojans, in
tercepted nine USC passes and
were close to the tying tally
three other times.
Tribe Strikes First
The contest started with a
quick goal by Stanford's Rob
Jensen and remained relatively
even for the rest of the first
quarter. The Trojans settled
down in their ball control style
of play and the Indians immedi
ately started pressing all over
the pool.
The first stanza ended with
Stanford in the lead thanks to
the brilliant play of goalie Banks

Beasley. Constantly pressured
by the big Trojans, he made
numerous fine saves, taking
away at least two all-but-certain
goals for the visitors.
The second quarter was a dif
ferent story. The extremely phy
sical Trojans came alive and
started dumping in goals. Bob
Watson had put the visitors on
the scoreboard after only one
minute had elapsed with a tricky
delay shot from five feet out.
Stanford drives into scoring
territory were stopped by the
alert SC defense. With the Tro
jans controlling the tempo of
the game, they scored three
quick goals half way through
the period, from close, middle,
and long range. The inept In

dian passing gave SC constant
scoring opportunities of which
they gladly took advantage. Just
before half time, the Cards' Tom
Hill finally connected on a long
shot to keep Stanford in the ball
game.
SC Spree
A questionable SC goal opened
the second half and started the
leaders off on another scoring
spree. It was ruled that Wat
son's lob shot did hit in the goal
for a point and gave his team a
5-2 advantage.
Although the Tribe's defense
did tighten up, the passing was
still sloppy and hurt the offen
sive drives. Dick Fink rammed
in two goals in a row for the
visitors and then followed it up

by hitting a penalty shot to give
Troy a commanding six goal
lead.
Stanford was unable to move
the ball past half court and
seemed doomed to suffer a huge
defeat. The only third quarter
score for the Indians came when
Hill connected on a penalty shot.
Band Arrives
The fourth quarter was
marked by the arrival of the
Stanford band and their off-key
music and cheering seemed to
spark the Varsity. The final pe
riod belonged only to Stanford.

Ken Terry scored for the Tribe,
then intercepted to set up a Hill
goal. After two more Stanford
steals, Terry hit again to close
the gap to two. Still another
Card interception set up a goal
by Rick Eagleston with 1:25 re
maining.
With SC trying desperately to
hold on to the ball, they fouled,
giving Stanford one more
chance to tie the game. But a
lob pass near the goal was
picked off by the Trojans who
ran out the remaining 30 sec
onds of play and left the pool—
thankful to be alive.
The league leading USC water
polo team got its biggest scare
of the season Saturday from a
fired up Stanford Varsity. The
Trojans took an early 8-3 lead
and held on through a torrid fi

most exciting finish of the year.
