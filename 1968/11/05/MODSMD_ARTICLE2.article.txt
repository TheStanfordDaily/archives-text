# HH Gains; Nixon Cites North Viet Infiltration
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
tumultuous 1968 presidential
campaign neared an end last
night with Republican Richard
M. Nixon citing a report of pos
sible new enemy infiltration of
South Vietnam and Democrat
Hubert H. Humphrey declaring
the report was an attempt to
"frighten the American people."
The political crossfire, cen
tered on President Johnson's de
cision to halt the bombing of
North Vietnam, came as Nixon,
Humphrey and third-party can
didate George C. Wallace fired
election eve broadsides at the
nation's divided electorate.
All three presidential contend
ers appeared in national net
work telecasts only a few hours
after a new poll boosted Hum
phrey into the load for the first
time in the campaign.
Citing an unidentified Air
Force general as his source,
Nixon declared he had a "very
disturbing report" that "thou
sands of tons of supplies are
being moved over the Ho Chi
Minh Trail" into South Vietnam.
He did not elaborate.
The GOP candidate also im
plied criticism of the President's
bombing halt order by saying
Johnson acted on the advice of a
"tired" team of diplomats. If the

war isn't ended by Jan. 20, Nix
on said. "I am going to bring
in a new diplomatic team and
they will end the war."
'Irresponsible'
Questioned later about the
Nixon statement, Humphrey
said it was a "totally irresponsi
ble charge' 'and "totally unsub
stantiated."
Nixon made his first criticism
of Johnson's bombing halt deci
sion only a few hours after for
mer President Dwight D. Eisen
hower praised the GOP nominee
for "statesman'ike conduct" in
supporting the President.
Even with the last-gast) politi
cal flurries, the possibility re
mained that Tuesday's voting
would be inconclusive — that
no candidate would emerge with
the 270 electoral votes needed to
become the 37th president of the
United States.
The final Harris survey dis
closed by the New York Post,
gives Humphrey 43 per cent of
the vote to 40 per cent for Nix
on, a swing of 5 per cent to the
Democratic nominee in 24 hours.
Running Third
Both the Harris and Gallup
polls showed Wallace, the for
mer A ] abama governor, running
third with about 15 per cent.
As victory predictions flowed

from their camps, Nixon and
Humphrey were in Los Angeles
for two-hour telecasts on com
peting networks Monday night.
Wallace, winding up his cam
paign d.ep in Dixie, scheduled
half-hour appearances on each
of the three national television
radio networks on election eve.
A turnout of nearly 73 million
voters is forecast for Tuesday.
This would be about 81 per cent
of the nation's registered voters
and would top the record of 71
million votes cast in 1964 when
President Johnson swept to a
landslide victory.
Besides the presidency and
vice presidency, all seats in the
House of Representatives plus
34 Senate seats are up for elec
tion. Voters in 21 states also will
elect governors.
Demonstrations
While the polls are open, radi
cal students promise demonstra
tions in big cities across the
country.
Some of these same students
were responsible for the relent
less heckling of candidates dur
ing a campaign that revolved
around the emotion-charged is
sues of the war in Vietnam and
law and order at home.
An Associated Press survey
made before President Johnson
halted all bombardment of North
Vietnam showed Nixon ahead
in 24 states with 216 electoral
votes. Humphrey had the lead
for 21 electoral votes but was
gaining ground in many of the
20 states with 262 electoral votes
that were rated as toss-ups. Wal
lace was leading in a 39 electorial
votes.
A New York Times survey,
meanwhile, listed Nixon as lead
ing <n 30 states with 299 elector
al votes, Humphrey ahead in
eight states and the District of
Columbia with 77 electoral votes
and Wallace leading in five
states with 45 electoral votes.
Seven states with 117 electoral
votes were rated by the Times
as too close to call.
