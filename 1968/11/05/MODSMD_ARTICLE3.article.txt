# New Approach
## 'Unobtrusive' Polls Taken 
### LYNNE McCALLISTER 
New ways of measuring public
opinion are being explored at
Stanford in what was called "the
world's largest unfunded re
search project." Water pressure
charts for example, are one way
of determining interest in politi
cal broadcasts.
Three assistant professors,
Michael Ray of the Business
School's marketing department,
William Paisley of Communica
tion Research, and David Grey
of the communication depart
ment originated this study. The
workers are "almost totally vol
unteer."
Its purpose is to find ways
other than the traditional inter
view to evaluate public opinion.
Its focus has been today's elec
tions.
Although he does not deny the
validity of the interview techni
que, Prof. Ray explained that it
tends to "elicit opinions and atti
tudes." People may play a role,
when interviewed, or form an
opinion which they did not have
before.
As many as eighteen different
methods are being used to sup
plement interviews to find the
most precise and practical com
bination. These methods include
TV ratings, measuring water
pressure, "expert informant"
studies, counting bumper stick

ers, and the "lost letter" tech
nique.
TV ratings determine interest
in political broadcasts, as do
water pressure measurements.
When people leave the television
set in the evening, Ray said,
they use water about 90 per cent
of the time.
For example, during the Dem
ocratic and Republican conven
tions an area's political affilia
tion could be verified by this
method. If many people went to
bed after the returns came in,
the water pressure went down.
The "lost letter" technique in
volves leaving letters with the
return address of a political or
ganization on the ground near
mailboxes. The percentage of re
turn is found.
This has not been very effec
tive, Ray said. There is probably
a conflict between the social
desirability of mailing the letter,
and political beliefs. The method
does work for extreme cases,
however, when the candidate or
organization is very contro
versial.
The political leaders of com
munities are being interviewed.
The studies have shown that
these men do not know as much
about their precincts as they
profess. These "expert inform
ants" also tend to be "biased
by their own political opinions."

Ray has been annoyed by tne
recent publicity given to his
bumper sticker polls, which in
one area showed Snoopy leading
Nixon and Humphrey 2 to 1. He
feels that this detracts from the
seriousness of the studies, on
which, he said, many people
have worked so hard.
These bumper sticker polls
have had another interesting re
sult. They show the lack of pub
lic involvement in this election.
This is in contrast to the high
interest in the spring primaries
in which McCarthy and Kennedy
were running.
Only 1 per cent of all cars
have bumper stickers, 5 per cent
on campus. Conservative areas
now have more stickers than
liberal areas. Wallace, RafTerty,
gun control, and "law and order"
are popular there. Liberal areas
seem to have few causes now.
Ray said that these polls ap
pear to agree with more conven
tional polls, with Nixon and
Cranston leading. However they
do not plan to evaluate their re
sults fully until after the elec
tions.
"We started out with naive
enthusiasm," he said. "We still
have enthusiasm, but we are
no longer naive. We now know
more and are planning a tight
study" of "multiple un
obtrusive methods."
