SENATORIAL CANDIDATE —Democrat Alan Cranston lambasted
opponent Max RafTerty declaring' "Rafferty is not a true conserva
tive. His values would destroy rather than preserve this country."
Cranston spoke to a crowd of 450 in Dinkelspiel yesterday in his
last formal campaign appearance.
The second clay of anti-election
festivities by the Stanford S.D.S.

Plaza. The rally will feature
several speakers who will
parody George Wallace. Richard
Nixon, Hubert Humphrey, and
"D. Candidate de la Kutur."
After the speeches, King Cong
and the Roving Goiilla Band will
play songs and lead a march to
the Applied Electronics Labora
tory to protest war research be
ing conducted there for the De
fense Department.
A sit-down outside one of the
building entrances will follow,
accompanied by skits and an
"exorcism of demons." The
S.D.S. will also attempt to en
gage Lab researchers in discus
sion. S.D.S. leaders say that the
sit-in will block one entrance of
the building only. The other en
trances will be left open.
Today's S.D.S. activities are
designed to "dramatize the re
jection of the American electoral
system and the policies it helps
to perpetuate."
In addition SDS has an
nounced plans to "make Stan
ford education more relevant on

Election Day" by going to
classes and engaging instructors
in discussion about the elections,
foreign policy, and the Univers

Night Headquarters of the
People: Lytton Plaza." There
