# 'Plan For Peace'
## Cranston Attacks Rafferty 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON 
"We must plan for peace,"
rather than for war said Cali
fornia Senatorial hopeful Alan
Cranston yesterday afternoon in
Dinkelspiel auditorium.
Speaking before 450 people at
a rally sponsored by the Com
mittee for a New Democratic
Politics, Cranston repeatedly at
tacked his Republican opponent,
state schools chief Max Rafferty.
Cranston drew a mixed reac
tion from the crowd when, an
swering a question, he said
Black Panther leader Eldridge
Cleaver should not have been
al'owed to lecture on the Ber
keley campus. He said that he
favored a black power spokes
man on campus but that a
"more responsible one" than
Cleaver should have been
chosen.
"Rafferty is not a true con
servative. His values would de
stroy rather than preserve this
country," Cranston said. "He
has failed totally in the one field
in which he has had experience,
education."
Cranston said it was "interest
ing" that "Rafferty's first choice
as president of the University of
California after Clark Kerr was
Curtis LeMay."
"Ignorance In Motion"
'The people of California have
a heavy responsibility to prevent
him from inflicting on other
children in America what he has
on children in California," Cran
ston said. "What would he do in
fields in which he has no experi
ence?" Cranston asked the
crowd. "There is nothing so
frightful as ignorance in mo
tion," he continued.
Cranston urged everyone to
vote for their candidate. "F or
those of you who are under 21,
I ask you to remember how New
Hampshire turned things around
and made the chance for peace
greater."
"The main issue is peace and
tranquility in the world. Here
Rafferty and I are the farthest
apart," Cranston said. "The
United States is now in the
fourth of a series of wars in
the twentieth century and we
must learn to plan for peace."
Meanwhile yesterday, the State
Poll, copyrighted by the Los An
geles Times, showed Republican
Senate candidate Max Rafferty
moving up six percentage points
while his Democratic opponent,

Cranston, dropped by three.
The latest standing was 51 per
cent for Cranston, and 37 pel
cent for Rafferty with 12 per
cent undecided.
Peace Talks
In his last formal campaign
appearance, Cranston gave an
informal address to the Dinkel
spiel audience for about thirty
minutes and then fielded ques
tions.
Cranston said he advocated
"every possible measure to get
peace." He reiterated his call for
a phased withdrawal of Ameri
can troops from Vietnam even
if the South Vietnamese do not
agree to it. Answering a ques
tion from the audience, Cran
ston attacked Saigon's refusal to
go to the Paris peace talks and
said the U.S. would "carry on
negotiations ourselves."
He said that the Saigon re
gime was not a duly elected gov
ernment supported by the Viet
namese people.
"The greatest hope for peace
in the world today lies in the
United Nations. We need the
rule of law in the world as well
as in the streets of America,"
the Democratic candidate said.

"Here the gap between Nixon
and Humphrey is clear. The
United States can kill all the
Russians three times over (with
nuclear weapons) and the Rus
sians can kill us twice over and
Nixon wants to widen the gap,"
Cranston said.
Asked what changes he fa
vored in the Selective Service

System, he said he would fire
Gen. Hershey and work for the
creation of an all-volunteer
army "with better pay and in
centives."
The current draft is "a terri
ble system of compelling men to
kill against their consciences.
Mankind must have peace," he
concluded.


WALLACE SUPPORTERS? â€”After an Intensive search the Daily has finally uncovered two Stanford
students for Wallace. The supporters stormed the Daily office yesterday shouting "register Commu
nists, not guns," and "after Nov. 5 you don't need to worry about publishing the DAILY because
there won't l>e none." The obviously wholesome homespun duo articulated their support for the Stan
ford police and the fire department and said flatly "we're proud to be rednecks. Our hair is not hang
ing down our backs. Those nni necks come from an honest day's work in the sun. You anarchists and
pseudo-intellectuals are through in this country." The pair ixisiml unwillingly for this rare photograph
and left in a huff exclaiming, "don't you all smear us or we'll come back and blow you up."
