In his column "The Price
of Grapes" in the Oct. 7
edition of The Daily, Alan
Rader stated that last June
a woman and her newborn
baby died when she did not
receive medical attention
for eight hours after enter
ing the Kern County Gen
eral Hospital.
It has been brought to
The Daily's attention that
there are no facts to sub
stantiate this statement,
and that the statement is,
in fact, untrue.
The Daily regrets this er
ror and apologizes to the
County of Kern and the of
ficials, employees, and med
ical staff of the Kern Coun
ty General Hospital.
