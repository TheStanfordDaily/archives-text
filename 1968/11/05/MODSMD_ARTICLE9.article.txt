## Pitzer, Role Of University 
### CHARLES GIBBS 
Kenneth Pitzer's article on "University Integrity",
in a recent issue of Science magazine, places him
squarely in the forefront of educational thought 20
years ago.
He begins by recognizing that "deep student con
cern" exists over issues such as racial relations and
war in Vietnam. His concern is that illegitimate pro
test actions will destroy the "integrity" of the uni
versity.
The bulk of the article is devoted to methods of
"dealing with" such actions, rather than with the
conditions which prompt them. Indeed, Pitzer is
quite explicit in his belief that "the university does
not and should not have the authority to deal with
matters of this type."
Though it has not national legal authority over
these questions, it does do research related to them,
make curriculum decisions, create, evaluate, and
purvey ideas on them; in short, the university most
certainly does deal with these questions every day.
Pitzer feels that educational calm will best be
maintained by a knowledge of "the proper role of
the university," which he proceeds to define. His
concept of the university is based on two assump
tions.
First, that there is a distinct class of knowledge
("the intellectual treasure of mankind") which the
university ought to transmit, to the exclusion of
other kinds of knowledge. He recognizes that val
uable things can be learned outside the university,
"in hospitals, in the ghetto, in artists' studios," but
believes that it "is not the purpose of our colleges
to duplicate these forms of learning."
Few students today would share that assumption.

In spite of the university, students have learned
that (a) the world is in deep trouble, and (b) that
this trouble will be on their backs in a few short
years.
This generation does in fact face some new reali
ties which did not exist even 20 years ago: three and
one-half million people starving to death in 1968,
the rapid and increasing destruction of our natural
environment, the possibility of racial war in this
country, the capacity to eliminate human life on
Earth.
Students want an education which will be rele
vant to the life they must face on leaving the uni
versity, and they are increasingly reluctant to sit
through courses which they feel to be irrelevant to
their self-education. "Relevance" in this context does
not mean a compulsory course in Solving The
World's Problems.
Nor does it mean the loss of freedom to evaluate
facts honestly, or to conduct nonutilitarian lines of
inquiry. It does mean the inclusion, in a student's
set of choices, of courses which bear some direct re
lation to the present world outside the university.
The concept of an "intellectual heritage" has two
other unfortunate implications: (1) it is generally
conceived in terms of a specific set of facts, and (2)
it tends to mask and perpetuate the hoard of con
ventions, fashions, and latent assumptions present
in every field. (For a treatment of implicit assump
tions in an academic field, see A. W. Gouldner's re
view in the same issue of Science).
Were the current courses on white racism and
black history part of the "intellectual treasure" of
Western mankind five years ago? No. The facts
existed, but it was not fashionable to consider that

racism might permeate beyond Mississippi or that
blacks had a culture worth studying.
It is, however, not the stagnation but the awful
provincialism of academic disciplines which turns
the pbsession with content into an anti-educational
force. "Every educated man must know (my field)."
Must he?
In practice, this attitude becomes embodied in
" , 1-2", that hoary collection of facts, as
sumptions, professional minutiae, and accumulated
navel-staring through which departments tradition
ally confer deliverance from darkness on the un
anointed masses. With the result that the student
gets his grade and promptly represses any surviving
desire to investigate .
It is simply true that students will learn, question
and think creatively in courses which are interesting
to them, i.e., those which they have freely chosen.
Pitzer's second assumption is that the transmis
sion of knowledge is achieved best within the hier
archical framework of superior teacher—inferior
student. Such an emphasis seems better designed
to promote the obedience mentality and preserve
adolescence than to foster critical thought, joy in
learning, and the concern for humanity which ought
to be the goals of education.
Moreover, no faculty can transmit to students
that capacity to govern self which comes from hav
ing power over one's own affairs: social, political,
moral, and of course, educational
It is not the proper role of the university to act
in loco parentis. Assisting students in their self
education is a proper role for t»ie university, and it
may do this in part by giving students the power to
implement tehir educational needs, as they see them.

It is not the proper role of the university to act

Kenneth Pitzer's article on "University Integrity",
in a recent issue of Science magazine, places him
squarely in the forefront of educational thought 20
years ago.
He begins by recognizing that "deep student con
cern" exists over issues such as racial relations and
war in Vietnam. His concern is that illegitimate pro
test actions will destroy the "integrity" of the uni
versity.
The bulk of the article is devoted to methods of
"dealing with" such actions, rather than with the
conditions which prompt them. Indeed, Pitzer is
quite explicit in his belief that "the university does
not and should not have the authority to deal with
matters of this type."
Though it has not national legal authority over
these questions, it does do research related to them,
make curriculum decisions, create, evaluate, and
purvey ideas on them; in short, the university most
certainly does deal with these questions every day.
Pitzer feels that educational calm will best be
maintained by a knowledge of "the proper role of
the university," which he proceeds to define. His
concept of the university is based on two assump
tions.
First, that there is a distinct class of knowledge
("the intellectual treasure of mankind") which the
university ought to transmit, to the exclusion of
other kinds of knowledge. He recognizes that val
uable things can be learned outside the university,
"in hospitals, in the ghetto, in artists' studios," but
believes that it "is not the purpose of our colleges
to duplicate these forms of learning."
Few students today would share that assumption.

In spite of the university, students have learned
that (a) the world is in deep trouble, and (b) that
this trouble will be on their backs in a few short
years.
This generation does in fact face some new reali
ties which did not exist even 20 years ago: three and
one-half million people starving to death in 1968,
the rapid and increasing destruction of our natural
environment, the possibility of racial war in this
country, the capacity to eliminate human life on
Earth.
Students want an education which will be rele
vant to the life they must face on leaving the uni
versity, and they are increasingly reluctant to sit
through courses which they feel to be irrelevant to
their self-education. "Relevance" in this context does
not mean a compulsory course in Solving The
World's Problems.
Nor does it mean the loss of freedom to evaluate
facts honestly, or to conduct nonutilitarian lines of
inquiry. It does mean the inclusion, in a student's
set of choices, of courses which bear some direct re
lation to the present world outside the university.
The concept of an "intellectual heritage" has two
other unfortunate implications: (1) it is generally
conceived in terms of a specific set of facts, and (2)
it tends to mask and perpetuate the hoard of con
ventions, fashions, and latent assumptions present
in every field. (For a treatment of implicit assump
tions in an academic field, see A. W. Gouldner's re
view in the same issue of Science).
Were the current courses on white racism and
black history part of the "intellectual treasure" of
Western mankind five years ago? No. The facts
existed, but it was not fashionable to consider that

racism might permeate beyond Mississippi or that
blacks had a culture worth studying.
It is, however, not the stagnation but the awful
provincialism of academic disciplines which turns
the pbsession with content into an anti-educational
force. "Every educated man must know (my field)."
Must he?
In practice, this attitude becomes embodied in
" , 1-2", that hoary collection of facts, as
sumptions, professional minutiae, and accumulated
navel-staring through which departments tradition
ally confer deliverance from darkness on the un
anointed masses. With the result that the student
gets his grade and promptly represses any surviving
desire to investigate .
It is simply true that students will learn, question
and think creatively in courses which are interesting
to them, i.e., those which they have freely chosen.
Pitzer's second assumption is that the transmis
sion of knowledge is achieved best within the hier
archical framework of superior teacher—inferior
student. Such an emphasis seems better designed

Kenneth Pitzer's article on "University Integrity",
in a recent issue of Science magazine, places him
squarely in the forefront of educational thought 20
years ago.
He begins by recognizing that "deep student con
cern" exists over issues such as racial relations and
war in Vietnam. His concern is that illegitimate pro
test actions will destroy the "integrity" of the uni
versity.
The bulk of the article is devoted to methods of
"dealing with" such actions, rather than with the
conditions which prompt them. Indeed, Pitzer is
quite explicit in his belief that "the university does
not and should not have the authority to deal with
matters of this type."
Though it has not national legal authority over
these questions, it does do research related to them,
make curriculum decisions, create, evaluate, and
purvey ideas on them; in short, the university most
certainly does deal with these questions every day.
Pitzer feels that educational calm will best be
maintained by a knowledge of "the proper role of
the university," which he proceeds to define. His
concept of the university is based on two assump
tions.
First, that there is a distinct class of knowledge
("the intellectual treasure of mankind") which the
university ought to transmit, to the exclusion of
other kinds of knowledge. He recognizes that val
uable things can be learned outside the university,
"in hospitals, in the ghetto, in artists' studios," but
believes that it "is not the purpose of our colleges
to duplicate these forms of learning."
Few students today would share that assumption.

In spite of the university, students have learned
that (a) the world is in deep trouble, and (b) that
this trouble will be on their backs in a few short
years.
This generation does in fact face some new reali
ties which did not exist even 20 years ago: three and
one-half million people starving to death in 1968,
the rapid and increasing destruction of our natural
environment, the possibility of racial war in this
country, the capacity to eliminate human life on
Earth.
Students want an education which will be rele
vant to the life they must face on leaving the uni
versity, and they are increasingly reluctant to sit
through courses which they feel to be irrelevant to
their self-education. "Relevance" in this context does
not mean a compulsory course in Solving The
World's Problems.
Nor does it mean the loss of freedom to evaluate
facts honestly, or to conduct nonutilitarian lines of
inquiry. It does mean the inclusion, in a student's
set of choices, of courses which bear some direct re
lation to the present world outside the university.
The concept of an "intellectual heritage" has two
other unfortunate implications: (1) it is generally
conceived in terms of a specific set of facts, and (2)
it tends to mask and perpetuate the hoard of con
ventions, fashions, and latent assumptions present
in every field. (For a treatment of implicit assump
tions in an academic field, see A. W. Gouldner's re
view in the same issue of Science).
Were the current courses on white racism and
black history part of the "intellectual treasure" of
Western mankind five years ago? No. The facts
existed, but it was not fashionable to consider that

racism might permeate beyond Mississippi or that
blacks had a culture worth studying.
It is, however, not the stagnation but the awful
provincialism of academic disciplines which turns
the pbsession with content into an anti-educational
force. "Every educated man must know (my field)."
