# Nixon, Humphrey Locked In Tight Contest Republican Edges Ahead In California Tal[illegible]
## 
### 
Republican Richard Nixon
seemed to be breaking an hours
long deadlock early this morn
ing and heading toward presi
dential victory over his oppo
nent, Democrat Hubert Hum
phrey.
The tide was turning toward
Nixon at the end of a monumen
tal struggle with Humphrey for
the electoral votes to become
37th president of the United
States.
As of 4 a.m. this morning Nix

on had won 27 states with 195
electoral votes while Humphrey
had carried 13 states with 166
votes. George Wallace had car
ried five states with 45 electoral
votes. Nixon needed 75 electoral
votes to put him over the top.
California, Ohio and Illinois
were among the undecided as
The Daily went to press. If Nix
on carries these states, he will
gain more than the necessary
270 electoral votes. Ohio and
California were leaning toward

Nixon while Illinois was up for
grabs.
In Senate races the forecast
was for a net Republican gain
of five seats. Gubernatorial races
seemed to indicate a net gain
for Republicans of four state
houses.
If neither Nixon or Humphrey
is able to muster a 270-vote ma
jority of the electoral college,
the outcome will remain in doubt
for at least 41 days, until that

body meets in the 50 state capi
tals to cast its vote.
To The House
And should it deadlock then,
at he choice would go to the
House of Representatives, for
the first time in 144 years.
Nixon and Humphrey ran far
ahead of George C. Wallace.
But the Deep South electoral
votes captured by the third par
ty candidate could prove crucial
in determining whether either

is able a fashion a clear victory
now.
Giant California, with 40 elec
toral votes; still-undecided Illi
nois, with 26, and a handful of
smaller states held the key to
victory for either of the major
party candidates
California Cliff-hanger
The battle for California's
votes turned into a cliff-hanger
early today, with Nixon still in
front but Hubert Humphrey
Humphrey closing the gap.
Nixon's lead, once nearly 70,-
000, dropped as new reports
came in from Los Angeles Coun
ty, where the late count of Tues
day's votes showed the Demo
cratic vice president closing
strong.
As returns from the state's 7
million-plus voters trickled in
from Tuesday's balloting, the
Los Angeles County—the state's
most populous — and Orange
and San Diego Counties, GOP
strongholds.
With 89% of the State's 21,590
precincts reporting, the count
gave Nixon 2,940,000 or 47% and
Humphrey 2,860,000 or 46% of
the vote.
For Nixon, the tension of elec
tion right could only recall an
other night, eight years ago,
when the choice was between
him and the late John F. Ken
nedy. He lost that ono, by the
narrowest of margins.
Voting Close
In electoral terms, Humphrey
had captured 11 states with 153
votes; Nixon had won 23 states
with 195 as The Daily went to
press.
Democrats kept their grip on
Congress, although Republicans
scored Senate gains. In the
House, which could become the
crucial arena, Democratic con
trol appeared unshaken.
• Popular Vote: Humphrey,
24,426,837 or 43 per cent; Nixon,
24,558,985 or 43 per cent; Wal
lace, 8,288,131 or 14 per cent.
• Electoral vote: Humphrey
carried nine states and the Dis
trict of Columbia with 147 elec
toral votes and led in eight
states with 100 electoral votes;
Nixon carried 21 states with 152
electoral votes and led in five
states with 87 electoral votes;
Wallace carried four states with
39 electoral votes and led in one
state with six. Needed to win
270.
• Senate: Elected, 12 Demo
crats, 12 Republicans; loading,
five Democrats, Four Republi
cans; holdovers, 40 Democrats,
26 Republicans. Needed for ma
jority 51.
• House: Elected, 184 Demo
crats, 129 Repub'icans; leading,
49 Democrats, 38 Republicans.

Needed for majority 218.
• Governors: Elected, 7 Dem
ocrats, 10 Republicans; leading,
1 Democrat, 3 Republicans; hold
overs, 11 Democrats, 18 Repub
licans.
Record Falls?
And there seemed little doubt
that the old record of 70,913,673
votes, set in 1964, would fall.
But there was doubt a-plenty
as to who was coming out ahead
in the race—a race that might
not be decided until January, in
the House of Representatives, if
no one captures a majority—27o
—of the Electoral College vote.
Pollsters threw up their hands
and refused to call the winner in
advance. They said it was just
too close between Humphrey and
Nixon.
Nixon voted Oct. 31 by absen
tee ballot in New York, saying
that he'd be flying from Califor-

nia to New York on e
and might not get b
the polls closed.
