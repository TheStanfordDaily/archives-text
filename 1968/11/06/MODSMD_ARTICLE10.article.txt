## 'Greatest Show On Earth' 
### BARBARA RITZ 
Yesterday's election premiere
was the longest running movie
in history, even better than "War
and Peace," stal l ing three cham
pions of the American Ideal, and
including a cast of millions.
Scenario: One Stanford ele
mentary school with a red, white,
and blue flag outside the door.
Inside are five old-fashioned

wooden booths. A card table is
in the center of the room. Time
is from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Cast: Four ladies (preferably
white-haired and grandmother
ly) are seated at the table. They
are busy scrutinizing the regis
tration books in front of them.
The "precinct runner" checks
to see who from his party hasn't
voted yet, and he runs to find

them. His one line is "get out
while you can."
The Action
Action: "With both hands put
the ballot very carefully into the
slot until the red buttons show.
Very good. Now with your spe
cial metal pencil find the name
of your candidate and his cor
responding number on the ballot.
Press down firmly."
By mid-afternoon yesterday
188 people out of a possible 474,
had cast their votes this way at
the Stanford Elementary School.
Mrs. Marie Sprague, one pre
cinct worker, said that in the 10
to 15 years she has worked at
the polls, this was the first
Presidential election that, she
would not tabulate by hand.
Voters at the elementary school
used the new "vote-a-matic" bal
lots. The results were to be ma
chine tabulated. The ballot looks
like an IBM card that psycholo
gists use in IQ tests. You are
told to punch holes in it.
Don't Run
People do not run to the polls,
observed another precinct work
er. She explained that spending
a day at the polls is a way for
her to see friends she hasn't
seen all year, except the last
time she voted. She described
most of the others as "very seri
ous" voters.
When a person comes into the
building, he finds his name in
the registration book in order to
prove himself legally qualified
to vote. One precinct worker de
scribes the "vote-a-matic" meth
od to him, then lets him try it
himself. On the practice ballot
he can vote for Mark Twain or
Leland Stanford for Railroad
Commissionr. Then she ushers
him into a booth in order to
vote for real.
One woman commented that
she wanted to be sure Hubert
Humphrey understood that her
vote for him included her lack
of total support. She regretted
that she couldn't find "Hubert
Humphrey" and "Hubert Hum
phrey with reservations" on the
ballot.
His Own Name
Another voter solved his di
lemma of choosing candidates
by writing his own name in, or
so he said.
By (>:3O that night, a total of
284 voters had come out to the
school, a little more than half of
the registered voters.
As voters trickled in, the pre
cinct ladies sat around the card
table, taking a little time for a
snack of doughnuts and coffee.
No dogs or other pets scurried
into the building. In fact, very
few people actually scurried in
to vote.

a possible 474 voters on Tuesday. It was the site for the incongru
ous combination of "votc-a-matic" ballots and grandmotherly wom
en working together.

few people actually scurried in
to vote.


POLLING PLACE—TIi.« Stanford Elementary School housed 188 of
a possible 474 voters on Tuesday. It was the site for the incongru
ous combination of "votc-a-matic" ballots and grandmotherly wom
en working together.
Yesterday's election premiere
was the longest running movie
in history, even better than "War
and Peace," stal l ing three cham
pions of the American Ideal, and
including a cast of millions.
Scenario: One Stanford ele
mentary school with a red, white,
and blue flag outside the door.
Inside are five old-fashioned

wooden booths. A card table is
in the center of the room. Time
is from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Cast: Four ladies (preferably
white-haired and grandmother
ly) are seated at the table. They
are busy scrutinizing the regis
tration books in front of them.
The "precinct runner" checks
to see who from his party hasn't
voted yet, and he runs to find

them. His one line is "get out
while you can."
The Action
Action: "With both hands put
the ballot very carefully into the
slot until the red buttons show.
Very good. Now with your spe
cial metal pencil find the name
of your candidate and his cor
responding number on the ballot.
Press down firmly."
By mid-afternoon yesterday
188 people out of a possible 474,
had cast their votes this way at
the Stanford Elementary School.
Mrs. Marie Sprague, one pre
cinct worker, said that in the 10
to 15 years she has worked at
the polls, this was the first
Presidential election that, she
would not tabulate by hand.
Voters at the elementary school
used the new "vote-a-matic" bal
lots. The results were to be ma
chine tabulated. The ballot looks
like an IBM card that psycholo
gists use in IQ tests. You are
told to punch holes in it.
Don't Run
People do not run to the polls,
observed another precinct work
er. She explained that spending
a day at the polls is a way for
her to see friends she hasn't
seen all year, except the last
time she voted. She described
most of the others as "very seri
ous" voters.
When a person comes into the
building, he finds his name in
the registration book in order to
prove himself legally qualified
to vote. One precinct worker de
scribes the "vote-a-matic" meth
od to him, then lets him try it
himself. On the practice ballot
he can vote for Mark Twain or
Leland Stanford for Railroad
Commissionr. Then she ushers
him into a booth in order to
vote for real.
One woman commented that
she wanted to be sure Hubert
Humphrey understood that her
vote for him included her lack
of total support. She regretted
that she couldn't find "Hubert
Humphrey" and "Hubert Hum
phrey with reservations" on the
ballot.
His Own Name
Another voter solved his di
lemma of choosing candidates
by writing his own name in, or
so he said.
By (>:3O that night, a total of
284 voters had come out to the
school, a little more than half of
the registered voters.
As voters trickled in, the pre
cinct ladies sat around the card
table, taking a little time for a
snack of doughnuts and coffee.
No dogs or other pets scurried
into the building. In fact, very
few people actually scurried in
to vote.
