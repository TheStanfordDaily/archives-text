# Against Elections
## SF Protest Tense But Mild 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
Nearly 1000 youthful demon
strators in San Francisco yester
day protested the election with
a festive flag burning rally in
Civic Center Plaza, a mild but
tense confrontation with police,
traffic, and businessmen on
Montgomery Street at rush
hour, and finally a long, appar
ently aimless walk to Humphrey
headquarters.
In a playful mood after their
Civic Center rally supporting
Presidential candidate Pigasus

111, a small black and white pig,
the protestors headed toward
Montgomery street to "play
monopoly for real." Monopoly
plans shattered however as two
policemen and several "yippies"
clashed, and for a tense moment,
the lighthearted parade threat
ened to become a full scale riot.
Police backed off quickly and
in moments received numerous
reinforcements.
Scattered
The demonstrators scattered
to the four corners of Sutter and
Montgomery. For more than
two hours they stood face to
face with police and 10-15 pro
testors were arrested as they
engaged police in small fisti
cuffs.
During the demonstration
traffic backed up for a dozen
blocks and there was a continu
ous stream of businessmen and
secretaries passing through the
crowd. Several well-dressed
businessmen began vigorous de
bate with the protestors and one
such hot dialogue burst into a
fight.
Demonstrators, however, were
leaderless, without a sound am
plifier, and minus a clear cause.
Restrained
Police were generally re
strained, and shortly after 6
p.m. the crowd suddenly broke
ranks and headed off down Mar
ket Street toward Humphrey
headquarters.
The 12-block walk concluded
with a short pause in front of
the headquarters, well secured
by police, and the greatly di
minished group of protestors
turned back toward the Civic
Center Plazr., clearly on the
verge of disillusion and disband
ment.
The early afternoon rally in
the plaza was highlighted by a

spontaneous burning of the Am
erican flag, a brief presentation
by Phil Ochs, a folksinger, and
a wild chase across the plaza

after Pigasus 111, who grunting
ly evaded 50 pursuers, ending
his race in the arms of an AS
PCA officer.
