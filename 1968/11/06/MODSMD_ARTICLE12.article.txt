### 
Following the prediction of mil
itant antiwar groups that dem
onstrations would break out "in
city streets all over the coun
try," antiwar pickets and elec
tion protesters marched in New
Jersey, New York, Ohio, Maine,
Illinois, Michigan, lowa, Califor
nia, and Washington, D.C. Al
though none developed into vio
lent police confrontations, there
were minor battles.
The most serious incident was
in Newark, N.J.
About 200 persons marched
through downtown Newark
streets, carrying signs object
ing to the election and the Viet
nam war. They were identified
mainly as supporters of the left
ist Students for a Democratic
Society, and the militant Black
Panthers.
About 50 of the demonstrators
became involved in a melee with
students from a community col
lege, who taunted the paraders.
Students for a Democratic So
ciety held a rally at New York
City's Union Square "for people
who don't find a meaningful
choice in the electroal process."
About 500 youthful demonstra
tors were held behind police bar
ricades. There were more than
70 arrests.
At Ohio State University in
Columbus, student extremists
paraded with an empty plywood
coffin, which they said symbol
ized the death of American poli
tics in Tuesday's election. They
later burned campaign posters
and nominated a black and
white spotted pig as their choice
for president.
In Chicago about 250 to 350
youths, protesting what leaders
called "the hoax of the elec
tion," marched in orderly fash
ion through the Loop, then dis
banded after a brief rally at the
Conrad Hilton Hotel.
A group of about 100 Univers
ity of Michigan students march
ed from a rally on their Ann
Arbor campus to the adminis
tration building, where they
milled about for a time.
In Washington D.C. National
Park Police broke up a demon
stration of young people Tues
day across the street from the
White House, arresting scores
for demonstrating without a pei
mit.
The arrests were made be
cause the young people were
"parading around, making
speeches, using a loud speaker
and things liktÂ«*that," in viola
tion of Park Service regulations.
About 700 young people
marched on the police head
quarters in downtown Los An
geles where they rallied for
more than an hour. Four divis
ions of police officers were alert
ed. No arrests were made.
