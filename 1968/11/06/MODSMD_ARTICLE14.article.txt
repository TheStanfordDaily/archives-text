# SDSers Chant At Lab, Talk With Researchers
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
Singing and chanting to the
music of a red- white- and blue
clad band flanked by a huge gold
styrofoam dollar sign, student
activists yesterday staged an or
derly march to the steps of the
Stanford Applied Electronics
Laboratory (AEL).
The demonstration was orga
nized by the Students for a Dem
ocratic Society (SDS) in protest
to alleged connections between
research work performed bv
the laboratory and the Vietnam
war.
The marchers were met with
cookies and punch on the patio
area bordering the entrance as
most researchers remained in
side apparently oblivious to what
was happening.
Outside, the demonsrators
numbering roughly one-hundred
in all engaged in animated dia
logue among themselves and
with various faculty members.
lengthy Chant
Soon after arrival several stu
dents mounted the small ledge
just outside the entrance and en
gaged in a lengthy chant which
they entitled the "Exorcise of
AEL."
The phrases rang out one after
another to the apparent delight
of the students.
"In the name of Richard Nix
on—alias Tricky Dick—who died
of exhaustion from screwing
the country . . .
"In the name of Ronnie Rea
gen who committed suicide by
throwing himself under the
hooves of a twenty-mule team
after losing an obscenity match
with Eldridge Cleaver . . .
From White Plaza
Point of the departure for
the march was White Plaza
where the SDS held a rally prior
to the march presenting several
speakers. Featured were stu
dents who did parodies of the
major presidential candidates,
along with an identity called "D.
Canidate de la Future."
A crowd estimated at 1 a r g e r
than 300 persons gathered for
the show but dwindled soon af
ter the march began.
Workers in construction areas
watched attentively high atop
unfinished buildings as the stu
dents equipped with pickets and

musical instruments paced past
them in an ordered procession
to the laboratory.
Girl Watching-
Asked for their reactions one
worker said he was watching
the girls.
But at the "sit-out" discussion
was more serious as SDS re
searcher David Pugh addressed
the participants telling them
that the Systems Techniques
Laboratory receives about $1
million from the Defense De
partment and 40 per cent of its
research projects are classified.
"The stuff they're doing now
will be used to prosecute colo
nial wars in the future," Pugh
said. "We're going to act as
proxies for the people of the
Third World ... to pillory pro
fessors who do work for the
government."
A fairly heated exchange en
sued when Mechanical Engineer
ing Prof. Stephen Kline took on
demonstrators.
Basic Knowledge Neutral
Kline said "Basic knowledge
is always neutral. If it weren't
for electronics, you wouldn't
have the devices you use on
White Plaza," he observed.
"I decide what I want to do—
and no one else. I get money

from wherever I can without
strings. I have no control over
how research is used."
Steve Weissman, former Stan
ford graduate student, said that
in today's world only the U.S.
and Russia are in a position to
"take basic research and use it.
You know in advance who'll use
it,"and it won't be guerilla
movements in Vietnam or Bo
livia. he told Kline.
"Research . . . has helped you
be rich enough to sit here and
talk with me," Kline replied. "If
it weren't for technology, you'd
be up in the trees hunting
squirrels. . . "
'Never Neutral'
Graduate student Eric Treis
man said: "Basic research is
never neutral . . . the people
who have access to basic re
search (in electronics) ire doing
evil things."
As the afternoon drew on the
students slowly began to drift
away.
The group soon dispersed after
Weissman suggested "we have
n't been doing our work" in or
ganizing students. He asked the
group to pledge to work for bet
ter participation "so when we
go against the trustees we have
1,000 people."

Basic Knowledge Neutral
Kline said "Basic knowledge
is always neutral. If it weren't

White Plaza," he observed.
"I decide what I want to do—

from wherever I can without
strings. I have no control over

Steve Weissman, former Stan

"take basic research and use it.
You know in advance who'll use
it,"and it won't be guerilla

SIJS RALLY — Sitting outside electronics labs at Stanford, SDS
members talk with students about the electronics laboratory and
American involvement in other countries.
Singing and chanting to the
music of a red- white- and blue
clad band flanked by a huge gold
styrofoam dollar sign, student
activists yesterday staged an or
derly march to the steps of the
Stanford Applied Electronics
Laboratory (AEL).
The demonstration was orga
nized by the Students for a Dem
ocratic Society (SDS) in protest
to alleged connections between
research work performed bv
the laboratory and the Vietnam
war.
The marchers were met with
cookies and punch on the patio
area bordering the entrance as
most researchers remained in
side apparently oblivious to what
was happening.
Outside, the demonsrators
numbering roughly one-hundred
in all engaged in animated dia
logue among themselves and
with various faculty members.
lengthy Chant
Soon after arrival several stu
dents mounted the small ledge
just outside the entrance and en
gaged in a lengthy chant which
they entitled the "Exorcise of
AEL."
The phrases rang out one after
another to the apparent delight
of the students.
"In the name of Richard Nix
on—alias Tricky Dick—who died
of exhaustion from screwing
the country . . .
"In the name of Ronnie Rea

throwing himself under the
hooves of a twenty-mule team
after losing an obscenity match
with Eldridge Cleaver . . .

Point of the departure for
the march was White Plaza
where the SDS held a rally prior
to the march presenting several
speakers. Featured were stu
