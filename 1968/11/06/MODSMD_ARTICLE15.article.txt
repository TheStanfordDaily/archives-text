## Pete McCloskey Triumphs 
### MARGIE WOLF 
A comfortably crowded gather
ing of predominantly student
workers applauded victorious
Republican Congressman Paul
N. (Pete) McCloskey last night
at the Thunderbolt Hotel in San
Mateo.
McCloskey praised "the enthu
siasm" of youth for his greater
than 4 to 1 trouncing of Demo
crat Urban Whitaker. But a

deeply wrinkled forehead coun
tered the candidate's victory grin
and betrayed his concern for fel
low Republicans in San Mateo
County.
General GOP district head
quarters, located above McClos
key's celebration, swallowed up
a comparatively small number
of enthusiasts in a ballroom
sized emptiness.
"Count the number of people

hero and the number of people
upstairs, and the number of
youth here and the number of
youth upstairs." McCloskey re
marked, explaining his success.
Through the early part of the
evening the candidate's mother
quietly thanked young cam
paigners.
Acknowledging victory less
than an hour after polls had
closed. McCloskey called his

sweep "just an incredible thing."
He promised to "live up to the
faith and confidence" of workers
and voters.
McCloskey emphasized ending
the Vietnam war and restoring
honest government, and favored
a lottery system draft in his lib
eral campaign. He did not sup
port his party's Senatorial hope
ful, Max Rafferty. His opponent,
San Francisco State Professor
Whitaker, named race relations
the prime issue.
Campaign workers recall door
bell-ringing for McCloskey.
'Got People Thinking'
"We got people thinking," one
Burlingame intermediate school
coed said.
Two Stanford students related
that one housewife wouldn't talk
to them until they cited McClos
key's AFL-CIO support. They
estimated about 20 Stanford stu
dents worked for McCloskey on
election day.
Thanked Workers
The candidate, dressed in a
dark suit and a blue shirt, had
arrived shortly after 8 o'clock.
He thanked workers and chatted
until his victory was assured.
Short-skirted hostesses pre
sented red roses to the candi
date's wife as she and her hus
band left for San Francisco tele
vision appearances.
The Congressman predicted he
would receive "respect from col
leagues" for his overwhelming
triumph. One campaign organiz
er cited the significance of Mc-
Closkey's widespread support
stating, "He might carry every
precinct."
