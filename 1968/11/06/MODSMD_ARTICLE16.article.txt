# Whitaker Concedes Defeat
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
Republican Pete McCloskey
had just defeated college Prof.
Urban Whitaker, but none of the
Democratic candidate's staff
looked upset. One precinct work
er declared of Whitaker, "He's
something to be proud of wheth
er lie wins or loses."
Most of the people in the San
Mateo Democratic headquarters
noticed the thin, meek Whitaker,
44, sipping coffee in a corner.
The campaign began the night
before the deadline for entering
the Congressional race when
Whitaker received a phone call
from a friend who bluntly told
him, "We're down to you." With
no money, little backing, and
hardly a prospect oi winning,
Whitaker decided to run.
Before New Hampshire
Roger Hamilton, a Stanford
graduate and campaign coordi
nator, recalled the start. "Urban
was a McCarthy supporter be
fore New Hampshire and the
Tot offensive."
The candidate scraped up bare
ly $12,000 while his incumbent
Republican opponent McCloskey
hired a public relations firm and
paid staffers, spending five
times as much.
Like Accountant
Whitaker, who looks more like
an accountant than an ambitious
challenger of a popular Con
gressman, drew up a strong
platform calling for an end to
the draft, an immediate bomb
halt, and repeal of the 10 per
cent surtax.
But the effort for Whitaker
was not enough. At 9:20 p.m.
last night Urban Whitaker, smil
ing thinly, passed out mimeo
graphed statements congratula
ting McCloskey on his victory.
