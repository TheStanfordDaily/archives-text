# Santa Clara Congressman
## Gubser Wins Again 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
Santa Clara County Republi
cans, like all voters and precinct
workers, crowded around TV
sets in McCabo Hall, San Jose,
last night for some indication of
the effectiveness of their work.

A youthful crowd of approxi
mately 150, encouraged by the
results of the get-out-the-vote
activities of the day, watched
and waited throughout the night.
Attention was constant while
hopes rose and fell.

The crowd's hopes rose signi
ficantly when it was announced
that Ohio had passed into Nix
on's camp. An equal feeling of
victory punctuated the silence
when the computers gave Dirk
sen the nod.
Throughout all speculation on
possible outcomes, there seemed
to be a constant confidence that
Nixon would win. To this end
one campaign worker remarked,
"Let the Senate elect Muskie
Vice-President, just as long as
Nixon's President."
Those people who had worked
on Victory Squad were at a loss
to explain Humphrey's wide
spread popularity in Santa Clara
County.
Bob Walker, executive direc
tor of the Santa Clara Republi
can Central Committee and for
mer Stanford Young Republican
president, pointed out in regard
to Humphrey's vote, "We have
held our own and that is what
we intended to do."
He speculated that although
Democrats hold a 47,000 voter
registration advantage, final re
sults in Santa Clara County
would be "very, very close."
Owing to a widespread Repub
lican turnout, voters seemed to
need little encouragement to
vote, most workers commented.
And yet there was an unprece
dented number of people turning
out to work.
More than 70 Stanford stu
dents were involved in Republi
can election activities yesterday
recording to Youth for Nixon
chairman Eddie Anderson.
Interest in the outcome of the
Rafferty -Cranston race was
short-lived. While there was no
open antagonism towards Raf
ferty, most people at the San
Jose party had written off any
chance of his victory long be
fore balloting began.
Stanford's Congressman
Charles Gubser was in obvious
high spirits noting his wide mar
gin of re-election. He expressed
his appreciation to all those pres
ent stating, "I am grateful to
all my friends for their help."
Gubser said that in the com
ing session of Congress he would
do "everything within my power
to restore the level of research in
our universities to the level re
quired for the national interest."
