WASHINGTON (AP) —Cam
paign oratory is likely to give
way to behind-the-scenes ma
neuvering on one or perhaps
two levels if the election fails
to produce a clear-cut Electoral
College winner.
There has been no agreement
among the three presidential
candidates about what should be
done if one of them fails to get
the needed 270 electoral votes.
Republican Richard M. Nixon
challenged Democrat Hubert H.
Humphrey to agree in advance
to support the popular vote win
ner if the election goes to the
House.
Humphrey said he has always
favored dirrct popular election
of the president—which would
require a constitutional amend
ment.
To House
Until one can be passed, he
has said he stands behind the
constitutional procedure that
provides for election by the
House if no candidate wins a
majority in the Electoral Col
lege.
George C. Wallace says the
matter will never go to the
House but will be settled, if nec
essary, by the electors them
selves who meet and vote Dec.
16 in their respective states.
The maneuvering, however,
that is likely to occur will in
volve first the Electoral College
itself whose 538 members won't
vote until Dec. 16. It will take
270 electoral votes—a simple
majority—for a presidential
candidate to win.
The next target of maneuver

Representatives, which will in-

herit the task of pickf

WASHINGTON (AP) —Cam
paign oratory is likely to give
way to behind-the-scenes ma
neuvering on one or perhaps
two levels if the election fails
to produce a clear-cut Electoral
College winner.
There has been no agreement
among the three presidential
candidates about what should be
done if one of them fails to get
the needed 270 electoral votes.
Republican Richard M. Nixon
challenged Democrat Hubert H.
Humphrey to agree in advance
to support the popular vote win
ner if the election goes to the
House.
Humphrey said he has always
favored dirrct popular election
of the president—which would
require a constitutional amend
ment.
To House
Until one can be passed, he
has said he stands behind the
constitutional procedure that
provides for election by the
House if no candidate wins a
majority in the Electoral Col
lege.
George C. Wallace says the
matter will never go to the
House but will be settled, if nec
essary, by the electors them
selves who meet and vote Dec.
16 in their respective states.
The maneuvering, however,
that is likely to occur will in
volve first the Electoral College
itself whose 538 members won't
vote until Dec. 16. It will take
270 electoral votes—a simple
majority—for a presidential
candidate to win.
The next target of maneuver
