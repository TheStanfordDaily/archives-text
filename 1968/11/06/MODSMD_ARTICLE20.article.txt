# Democrats Strangely Happy At Victory Party In San Jose
## 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
The crowd at the San Jose
County Democratic victory party
was happy, but in a strange way.
They felt that the results were
for the most part obvious.
Incumbent Congressman Don
Edwards, and sensational candi
date Alan Cranston would win
easily; Congressional candidate
Grayson Taketa would be over
whelmed, but make the best
showing a challenger has made
against incumbent Republican
Congressman Gubser.
The real happiness came main
ly from Vice President Hum
phrey's amazingly strong show
ing. People couldn't believe that
Humphrey could run such a good
race.
Former Kennedyites
But the strangest facet of the

crowd was its composition:
white, overwhelmingly former
Kennedy supporters. "I was for
Kennedy, but now that he's no
longer with us, I must support
Humphrey," said one high school
student.
Another Kennedy supporter
said that he had switched enthu
siastically to Humphrey. He was
bitter about the failure of some
McCarthy supporters to help the
Vice President.
A young Mexican-American, a
former Kennedy supporter and
one of the very few Chicanos at
the celebration said, "I had
to switch to Humphrey after
Kennedy was killed. He's the
least of three evils."
Too Many Others
But not all were so enthusi
astic. A San Jose State student

who worked actively for Hum
phrey felt that Humphrey would
lose because he would lose Cali
fornia. "There are too many
people who think like Rafferty
or Reagan for Humphrey to
win."
Candidate Taketa put on a
good show of optimism in the
face of his defeat. "I think that
when the results are tabulated I
will have made the best showing
that anyone has against this in
cumbent," he said. "I'm going to
be running again in two years in
anv case."
