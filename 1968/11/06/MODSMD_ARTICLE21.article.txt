# Ransom Views Vote
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
As expected, David Ransom
finished a dismal third in San
Mateo's congressional election.
But the Peace and Freedom
Party's candidate was far from
dismal himself last night as he
strolled around Lytton Plaza,
celebrating what he called "my
defeat party."
Standing across the street
from the offices of the Peninsula
Observer, which he edits, Ran
som smiled at friends and talked
with "my constitutents."
The defeat was expected, of
course, but Ransom wasn't even
interested in the number of
votes he received. "I'll be happy
with as many as I get," he
laughed.
Victory was not his aim in
running, but rather "education
and organization."
But even from this angle, "I
don't think the campaign was
successful," Ransom noted. "I
didn't get into as many places
as I wanted to."
'The majority of his appear
ances were in high schools and
at community-sponsored candi
dates' nights.
"The only reason I was in
vited was because my name was
listed as a candidate," he added.
High School Response
The response in high schools
was "heartwarming," he said.
The students "were much more
with me than any other group,"
Ransom said.
What about the future of the
Peace and Freedom Party? That
lies in "local organizing and lo
cal elections," he felt.
"There is a future for a pro
gressive coalition in the state,"
.Ransom concluded. "That's go
ing to happen no matter what
it's called."
