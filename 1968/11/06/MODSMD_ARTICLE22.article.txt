# Demos Retain House Control, Republicans Gain No Seats
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Dem
ocrats held Republicans to vir
tually no gain in races for House
seats yesterday.
It appeared that there would
be little change in the 245-187
lineup which now favors the
Democrats, with three vacancies.
Joined with the continued Demo
cratic majority in the Senate, the
91st Congress that convenes
next January will be the eighth
straight Democrat - controlled
Congress.
If the House elects a presi
dent, however, the states would
vote as units, each getting one
vote, and the big question is how
the states carried by third party
candidate George C. Wallace
would vote.
Democratic incumbents ran
strongly and the Republicans
were able to score only slight
gains.
In Doubt
Still in doubt was the number
of state delegations each party
will control in the event the

House has to pick the next Pres
ident.
The small number of turn
overs came as a surprise. In
cumbents generally had been
thought to be in trouble with the
widespread national dissatisfac
tion over the war in Vietnam and
riots in the cities.
Republicans also had counted
on redisricting to help them
gain seats in New Jersey, but
all three Democrats they had
picked as likely targets won re
election.
In New York City, Mrs. Shir
ley Chisholm, a Democrat, be
came the first Negro woman
ever elected to Congress when
she defeated James Farmer, for
mer head of the Congress of Ra
cial Equality in a new district.
Powell Returned
Adam Clayton Powell, the
Harlem Congressman who was
excluded from the 90th Congress
on charges of misusing federal
funds, was re-elected, setting up
another possible challenge to his

seating in the new Congress.
The possibility of the presiden
tial decision going to Congress
adds a new dimension to the
House races, since the states
vote as a unit in selecting a pres
ident and it is one state, one
vote, with an absolute majority
of 26 needed to elect. Thus con
trol of the state delegation be
comes of paramount importance.
Already In
Forty-five lucky congressmen
were assured of election as soon
as the polls opened Tuesday.
They were running without op
position. Two senators, Republi
can George D. Aiken of Ver
mont, and Russell B. Long of

Louisiana also won re-election
without opposition.
The unopposed congressmen
included 37 Democrats and eight
Republicans.
Six senators and 13 members
of the House chose retirement
at the end of the 90th Congress
rather than another term. Head
ing the list was Sen. Carl Hay
den, 91, of Arizona, who served
a record 56 years, 15 in the
House and 41 in the Senate.
Also bowing out after 33 years
in the House was Rep. Charles
A. Halleck (R., Ind.), who was
majority leader of the House
during two terms, and the mi
nority leader for three terms.

Harlem Congressman who was
excluded from the 90th Congress
on charges of misusing federal
funds, was re-elected, setting up
another possible challenge to his

seating in the new Congress.
The possibility of the presiden
tial decision going to Congress
adds a new dimension to the
House races, since the states
vote as a unit in selecting a pres
ident and it is one state, one
vote, with an absolute majority
of 26 needed to elect. Thus con
trol of the state delegation be
comes of paramount importance.
Already In
Forty-five lucky congressmen
were assured of election as soon
as the polls opened Tuesday.
They were running without op
position. Two senators, Republi
can George D. Aiken of Ver
mont, and Russell B. Long of

Louisiana also won re-election
without opposition.
The unopposed congressmen
included 37 Democrats and eight
Republicans.
Six senators and 13 members
of the House chose retirement
at the end of the 90th Congress
rather than another term. Head
ing the list was Sen. Carl Hay
den, 91, of Arizona, who served
a record 56 years, 15 in the
House and 41 in the Senate.
Also bowing out after 33 years
in the House was Rep. Charles
A. Halleck (R., Ind.), who was
majority leader of the House
during two terms, and the mi
nority leader for three terms.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Dem
ocrats held Republicans to vir
tually no gain in races for House
seats yesterday.
It appeared that there would
be little change in the 245-187
lineup which now favors the
Democrats, with three vacancies.
Joined with the continued Demo
cratic majority in the Senate, the
91st Congress that convenes
next January will be the eighth
straight Democrat - controlled
Congress.
If the House elects a presi
dent, however, the states would
vote as units, each getting one
vote, and the big question is how
the states carried by third party
candidate George C. Wallace
would vote.
Democratic incumbents ran
strongly and the Republicans
were able to score only slight
gains.
In Doubt
Still in doubt was the number
of state delegations each party
will control in the event the

House has to pick the next Pres
ident.
The small number of turn
overs came as a surprise. In
cumbents generally had been
thought to be in trouble with the
widespread national dissatisfac
tion over the war in Vietnam and
riots in the cities.
Republicans also had counted
on redisricting to help them
gain seats in New Jersey, but
all three Democrats they had
picked as likely targets won re
election.
In New York City, Mrs. Shir
ley Chisholm, a Democrat, be
came the first Negro woman
ever elected to Congress when
she defeated James Farmer, for
mer head of the Congress of Ra
cial Equality in a new district.
Powell Returned
Adam Clayton Powell, the
Harlem Congressman who was
excluded from the 90th Congress
on charges of misusing federal
funds, was re-elected, setting up
