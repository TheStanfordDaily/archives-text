# Senate Majority Remains In Democratic Hands
## 
### 
Although Republicans made a
strong showing in Senate races,
Democrats overrode the chal
lenge and easily assured them
selves a continued majority.
Republicans took away six
Democratic seats in Maryland,
Florida, Pennsylvainia, Arizona,
Oklahoma, and Ohio. But only
one-third of the Senate seats
seats were at stake and the big
holdover majority of the Demo
crats was too much to over
come.
Prospects were that the Sen
ate majority party would lose
a net of about six seats. Such
an outcome would mean a 57-43
Democratic majority in the Sen

ate of the 91st Congress.
But Republicans earlier had
captured Democratic posts in
Maryland and Florida.
