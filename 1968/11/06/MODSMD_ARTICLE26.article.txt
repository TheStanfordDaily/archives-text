## Draw System Cited For Future Change 
### ANN DENTON 
"I lucked out, got a high num
ber and ended up in Roble."
"Besides being a male and a
sophomore I got just about the
lowest number possible. So here
I am at Durand. It could have
been worseâ€”either Mayfield or
off campus."
These are two aspects of the
draw, a system described as
"who gets which place on cam
pus when." Less complimentary
descriptions are often heard
from unlucky participants.
Even the Dean of Students
Office, responsible for the draw,
describes it as "an historic
relic." Actually, the draw is the
method used up to this time
by students wanting to change
residence.
In the past the mechanics of
the draw included filling out a
complicated form indicating the
order of housing preference.
This was followed by thousands
drawing a number out of a
wastebasket.

The Dean of Students office
then had to match the students
to the spaces available. Accord
ing to Assistant Dean of Stu
dents Bob Rosch, this was done
through "an elaborate system of
priorities" and involved hun
dreds of hours.
ASSU vice-president Vic von
Schlegell spoke mockingly of the
priority system. "It was ridicu
lous. It got to be where a senior
girl who had lived five consecu
tive quarters in the same place
and had two eyes and six toes
on each of two feet had priority
over . . . People are just really
dissatisfied with the draw sys
tem and rightly so."
When both students and ad
ministration agreed on the need
for change, the Committee on
the Draw, headed by von Schle
gell, was set up.
Its purpose is to review the
housing situation in general and
the draw process in particular.
The committee now consists of
nine students. Anyone interested

in joining or contributing ideas
should contact von Schlegell.
Rosch stated that his office
has no vested interest in the old
system and will do whatever the
students want. "I'd like to see
them abolish them all (the pri
orities) and put it back on an
equal basis. . . . I'm willing to
have any kind of crazy system
the students want."
Both Rosch and von Schlegell
want to get rid of the "filling
the beds aspect" previously
characteristic of the draw.
Rosch pointed out, "The prob
lem of values is a more import
ant issue. The point is that this
affects peoples' well-being."
With this in mind, the com
mittee hopes to revamp the en
tire system by spring quarter,
hoping to have only two prior
ities remain: incoming freshmen
and students returning from
overseas.
