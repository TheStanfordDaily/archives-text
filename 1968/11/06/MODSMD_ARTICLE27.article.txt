# New Technology Hides In Tunnel
## 
### 
A "new technology" linear ac
celerator that physicists confi
dently predict will revolutionize
every aspect of accelerator
building will shortly begin to
take shape in a tunnel 30 feet
beneath the High Energy Phys
ics Laboratory.
The planned "linac" will be a
500-foot tube of the metal nio
bium, bathed in superfluid
helium to keep it at a tempera
ture of less than -475° F. (1.85°
Kelvin) , through which elec
trons will be accelerated close
to the speed of light.
In such a climate niobium be
comes superconducting, losing
practically all its resistance to
the flow of electric current. And
such a linear accelerator, in con
trast to comparable room-tem
perature linacs, will:
• Cut power losses in the ac
celerator tube's walls by a mil
lion—from one million watts per
foot to one watt per foot;
• Give a 1,000-fold improve
ment in "duty cycle" by acceler
ating a continuous beam of elec
trons instead of a pulsed beam
that is on only 1/I,oooth of the
time;
• Produce 10 times more elec
trons in the beam, or 100 micro
ampheres instead of 10;
• Keep the electron energies
100 times more homogenous—
stable within .01 percent rather
than within one percent;
• Increase the accelerator's
energy at least 50 percent (to
1.5 billion volts) and possibly
500 percent (to five billion
volts);
• Probably reduce the high
cost of all types of accelerators
significantly.
The Office of Naval Research
(ONR) is supporting this pro
gram with the objective of
achieving major advances in
cryogenic technology, which
would make it possible to oper
ate electronic systems, such as
aboard ship, at helium tempera
tures. The equipment would be
compact, highly reliable, more
efficient and require less power.
A cryogenic or superconduct
ing system might include low
noise receivers, magnetometers,
oscillators, gravity meters, ac
celerometers, Josephson junc
tion infrared detectors, and
other superconducting circuit
elements. Such a system would
provide components free from
thermal expansion and therefore
mechanically stable, supercon
ducting magnets, superconduct
ing magnetic shields, and even
electrical machinery.
The improved characteristics
of the superconducting acceler
ator will enable physicists to ex
tend high-accuracy, high-resolu
tion exploration of the nucleus
and the nucleon to much higher
energies.
In particular, the continuous
beam will open up a whole new
class of fundamental "coinci
dence" experiments in which the

experimenter tries to distin
guish an interesting "event"in
volving two interacting particles
from a much larger background
of particle interactions. When
the accelerator beam is pulsed
only 1/I,oooth of the time, the
background is essentially 1,000
times bigger.
Such stability in particle
beams has been available only
at much lower energies, as in
the Van de Graaff accelerators.
These can generate continuous
particle beams of about 30 mil
lion volts maximum.
Of almost equal importance,
in the opinion of the Stanford
physicists, will be the creation
of the world's first large-scale
cryogenic research laboratory.
This will be a tantalizing by
product of the accelerator's re
quired 15,000-iter (nearly 4,000-
gallon) reservoir of superfluid
helium, enabling scientists to
draw superfluid from spigots
throughout the laboratory for
low-temperature research on an
unprecedented scale.
This also will be the first
practical use of two unique
properties of superfluid helium
—its ability to flow uphill and
its remarkable thermal conduc
tivity.
The bulk of the superfluid will
necessarily remain in the under
ground reservoir surrounding
the accelerator tube. Because it
will flow vertically upward as
high as 100 feet, circulation be
tween the underground reser
voir and ground-level laboratory
outlets and refrigerator will not
require expensive cyogenic
pumps.
The thermal conductivity of
superfluid helium is essential to
the accelerator's success. The
superfluid conducts heat 10,000
times more efficiently than cop
per, so that heat absorbed by
the fluid is instantly distributed
throughout the liquid. This will
keep the niobium tube's tem
perature constant to one part in
10,000 even at full power.
The pioneering group of Stan
ford physicists, led by Profs.
William M. Fairbank and H.
Alan Schwettman, hopes to have
the 500-foot superconducting
linac in operation by 1971. Other
group members are Drs. Ed
ward E. Chambers, E. Jones,
Michael B. McAshan, Todd I.
Smith, Larry R. Suelzle, and
John P. Turneaure. The project
is actually a modernization of
Stanford's High Energy Physics
Laboratory and its 15-year-old,
billion-volt Mark 111 linac, the
physicists said.
