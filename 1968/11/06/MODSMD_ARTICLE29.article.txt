# The
						Resistance:
## 'The Draft Is Compulsion' 
### GREG WHITE 
The Resistance is preparing
for a national Resist the Draft
Day, Thursday, Nov. 14, when it
is hoped that thousands of draft
cards will come flowing back to
the Selective Service.
Resistance members do this in
the belief that "the draft exists
only because it makes a play on
fear — the draft is compulsion."
In a Daily interview, Resis
tance members Steve van Tiel,
Paul Rubert, Lyle Herbig, and
Peter Rand explained some of
the ideas and plans of the Re
sistance.
The local Resistance will par
ticipate in the nationwide Re
sist the Draft Day. Cards will be
turned in to local draft boards
or collected for a massive turn
in in San Francisco. It is esti
mated that almost 4,000 cards
have, in the past, been turned in
through efforts of the Resis
tance, with thousands more
turned in by objectors not even
aware of the Resistance's exis
tence.
Not A Monolith
The Resistance itself, far from
being a monolithic "subversive"
organization, is actually a very
loose coalition of groups of like
minded people throughout the
the country who have pledged to
resist the draft.
It was started in 1967 partly
through the efforts of former
ASSU President Dave Harris,
who found the idea on many peo
ple's minds.

Members "resist" by turning
in draft cards or refusing in
duction. Many are under FBI in
vestigation, under indictment, or
in jail — for an average of 32
months. Some have had their
phone capped.
The Palo Alto Resistance is
one of the more active groups.
Literature on the Selective ser
vice, on the mi?thods of draft re
fusal, on what prison is like, and
so on, is printed here and dis
tributed across the nation. Mem
bers also talk with college, and,
when possible, high school
groups — in fact, "our whole
function is an attempt to com
municate." Yet the Resistance
stands for much more.
A Personal Decision
"Membership" in the Resis
tance is a very personal decision
as "programs are useless unless
the people proposing them live
their idea first." Members don't
like to get hung up on the idea
they are moral — "every group
thinks it is moral" — but they
feel they must take an individ
ual stand on conditions they
can't conscientiously tolerate.
The Resistance recognizes that
political activity is needed for
changing society, but that that
"is not everything." Instead, the
"essential need is to make soci
ety appeal to people's moral cen
ters."
The Resistance feels that if
life is to be changed in America,
"we must change the springs of
motivation in ourselves." By
taking the step of resisting the

draft, one frees himself of the
fear of that system and declares
himself independent from its
compulsions in spirit, if not in
body.
Nothing To Hide
This is why those in the Re
sistance have "nothing to hide
— everything we do is up front
as we have made a straightfor
ward statement with our lives."
Thus members cooperate with
FBI investigations and keep
their local boards fully notified.
The Resistance calls on every
one to "be aware" of why they
react to things the way they do.
"People have theories about
what should be the case and
what is, but never see the degree
in which they are implicated in
what they are against." Resis
tance members feel they can't
be against the draft and still ac
cept deferments because that
way they are still yielding to

the system's compulsions. They
also can't accept the "channel
ing" of their lives by seeking out
government specified defer
ments.
Yet the draft is not the main
point — it is the type of thought
that spawned the draft that most
worries the Resistance. Just as
air pollution chokes the skies,
"for us in the Resistance the
same type of thought pollution
occurs — we can't breathe in a
society that thinks like the mili
tary." Thus the Resistance will
likely continue even if the draft
is done away with.
The Palo Alto Resistance will
be holding special movie-discus
sion groups at several on and
off campus living groups from
Nov. 3-10. Sunday, Nov. 10, Da
vid and Joan Baez Harris will
speak at Memorial Auditorium
in support of the draft card
turn-in.
