CYROGENIC GOOSE â€” This cool tunnel for a n)w supercold superconducting: linear accelerator is
60 feet long and lies 30 feet beneath the Stanford High Energy Physics Laboratory. Physics professor
Mason Yearian (left) and engineer Arthur Marcuni study the area where the 500-foot "new technol
ogy" linac will be installed in superfluid helium-filled dewars to keep it below -457 degrees Fahrenheit.
