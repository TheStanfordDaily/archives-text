You may not have noticed it, but there is an election taking
place today and tomorrow.
On the ballot are four propositions and the election of three
representatives for the Student Conduct Legislative Council as
well as for Head Yell Leader.
The first proposition deserves everyone's vote. It is simply an
amendment to the ASSU Constitution providing for a smaller
student legislature. The present setup provides us with an un
workable, oversize body that has proven itself impotent.
The second and third propositions are far different matters.
Proposition 2a would advise the administration not to give in
to any demands made by any student group if there are any
"coercive tactics." If adopted, it might encourage the Adminis
tration to reject all requests by student groups. The wording of
the proposition is too dangerous to deserve our support.
Proposition 2b is simply unnecessary as the Committee of Fif
teen and the Student Conduct Legislative Council serve arbitra
tive roles.
The final proposition condemns the U.S. Olympic Committee
for its suspension of the two black runners, Tommie Smith and
John Carlos. We support this position.
