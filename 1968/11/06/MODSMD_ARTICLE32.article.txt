# Amendment Called To Student Vote
## 
### BENNETT CULLUM 
In addition to several refer
endums, Stanford students will
cast votes today and tomorrow
supporting or rejecting the
ASSU constitutional amendment
printed in The Daily Monday
and Tuesday.
The amendment is a compro
mise proposal drafted by the
Coalition for Change, a group
of students that includes, among
others, the backers of the new
ASSU Constitution and the
members of the Committee for
Student Responsibility. The pur
pose of this amendment is to
institute immediately those

structural changes that are most
urgently needed.
The most significant modifica
tion to be made by the amend
ment provides for replacing an
ineffective and unwieldy Legis
lature with a Senate designed to
carry out with dispatch the basic
legislative functions of the As
sociation. Most members of the
Senate would be elected by pro
portional representation, which
effectively prevents any one
group of students from "pack
ing" the legislative body, a prac
tice not uncommon in the recent
history of LASSU. In addition,
the constitutional amendment
guarantees the election of at
least one first-term undergrad
uate student.
Another important reform
transfers the substantive control
of the ASSU finances from the
Dean of Students' office to the
Student Financial Manager and
to the elected Association offi
cers. Under the amendment, the
ASSU fee level, currently set
by the University, would be de
termined by a majority of those
students voting in a general
election. Part of the funds col
lected would be remitted directly
to graduate and undergraduate
associations on a per capita
basis.
The amendment attempts to
bring about changes in those
areas that have caused the
greatest amount of difficulty
since the adoption of the exist
ing ASSU Constitution in 1963.
Polling places, open from 9:30
to 4, are located in front of the
post office, at English Corner,
and at the Physics tank.
