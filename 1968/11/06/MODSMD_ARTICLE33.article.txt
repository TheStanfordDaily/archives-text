## 'Romeo And Juliet' Excellent 
### TODD MCCARTHY 
In analyzing films, one be
comes used to judging them on
the basis of the external or sur
face values of the product, such
as acting, camerawork, music,
direction, etc. Such ingredients
are, by virtue of the media, in
herent in any film and can be
considered standard criteria for
criticism.
Indeed, it is the rare film
which exudes something more
than these basics (even if all
these areas are competently
handled); a feeling within each
member of the audience which is
a direct response to the intellect
and emotions of the creators of
the film. Such a quality could be
called aura, mystique or even
charisma, but it is more than
that because this feeling exists
not only on screen but in the
viewer himself. Consequently,
one comes out of such films with
an emotional reaction (love or
hate) rather than an objective
response ("That was a good
movie, etc.").
Quasi-Intelleetuals dissent
Many quasi - intellectual film
critics try to submerge their
emotions even when it is im
possible to do so. In such con
troversial cases as 2001: A Space
Odyssey, or Bonnie and Clyde,
the dissenters objected on the
surface level, quibbling about
this and that so as not to have
to admit that the films had a
great deal of effect on them as
people.

In the current case of Romeo
and Juliet, some purists have
complained that this new pic
ture is not Shakespeare; that
unless the poetry is uttered by
40 - year - old mannequins, the
work must be condemned. Exact
ly the opposite is the case. Fran
co Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet
is the purest and most joyous
filmization of the Bard that has
ever existed and, furthermore,
ranks as a major achievement of
the modern cincma.
Adheres to Essence
Director Zeffirelli has achieved
his masterpiece by adhering not
to the structure but to the es
sence of the play. It is about
love and it is about hate and
deals with these matters as uni
versal subjects. This premise al
lows Zeffirelli to apply what are
considered "contemporary" atti
tudes and motivations to the ac
tion.
Some members of the audience
giggled when the lovers frantic
ally kissed and pawed each other
just as modern young people do
and as they had never seen
Shakespeare's characters do be
fore, but what else could be more
logical and essentially "right?"
These characters are, in their
own right, breathing, crying,
bleeding and living human be
ings, and I can think of nothing
more that even Shakespeare
himself would have asked.
Teenagers As Leads
Zeffirelli started out on the
right foot immediately by cast

ing 16-year old Olivia Hussey
and 17-year old Leonard Whiting
in the lead roles. These are two
extraordinarily attractive young
sters and they definitely under
stand the feelings and thoughts
that go along with being young
and in love.
However, no matter how com
petent the leads or any individ
ual parts of a film may be, a bad
director can always cause the
failure of a film. Fortunately,
Zefiirelli, who has directed opera
and many stage versions of
Shakespeare's work, has han
dled the property carefully but
also with great abandon and
spontaneity.
In the town square sequence,
he achieves the same vital and
bustling atmosphere of Renais
sance Italy that he did in last
year's Taming of the Shrew,
while the romantic scenes reach
a level of tenderness and com
passion unseen in his previous
work.
The director's most significant
accomplishment, especially con
sidering that the film was made
in 1968, a period of great tech
nical gimmickery, is that there
is no fleshy or obvious tech
nique and, while each shot is
beautifully composed and the
production is sumptiously
mounted, the effect is one of a
tapestry and not a montage.

All the parts are played to
perfection, at least in terms of
Zefflrelli's conception of the play.
John McEnry's Mercutio is at
once appealing and tragic, with
his Queen Mab speech being de
livered with agonizing hysteria
and torment. Michael York as
Tybalt is also quite effective and
their fatal dueling match is one
of the most exciting action se
quences ever filmed, the camera
man reportedly having been a
stride a horse in the middle of
the fight.
No Pat Answers
As stated earlier, a film like
Romeo and Juliet is very rare.
The point is that to technical
questions there are always an
swers ("well, we slung the cam
era under the fender three inches
above the ground using a Zoom
ar lens . . but to the effects
(human behavior) achieved in
films like Romeo and Juliet,
there are no pat answers as to
how things were done.
Such things happen, magically,
naturally or otherwise and thuse
create a quality that is, in words,
indescribable. It is a credit, not
to the technical expertise or in
tellectual genius of the film
makers, but to their humanity.
Frankly, anyone who cannot
react honestly and passionately
to this film has either never
lived or has forgotten how.
