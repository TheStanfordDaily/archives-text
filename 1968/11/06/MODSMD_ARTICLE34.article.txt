## Fourteen Predictions 
### MAURY TRAVIS THE NEXT EIGHTY DAYS 
Will see the following events:
1. LBJ unilateral sellout of
October 31 is a cheap shoddy po
litical trick endangering the
can lives of South Vietnamese
and the lives of over half million
American servicemen and their
fine allies from South Korea,
Australia, New Zealand and
Thailand. November 2nd news
dispatches indicate wholesale re
jection by South Vietnam and
majority of armed forces per
sonnel.
2. Soviet support of North
Vietnam is to pin down by de

laying action any hopes of mili
tary victory over North Vietnam
(which could have been accomp
lished by knockout blow at Hai
phong and Hanoi, sealing off
routes from Red China and
USSR), to bleed the U.S. and
thereby strengthen USSR am
bitions in Europe and Middle
East.
3. Domestic crises in race re
lations (black militants) and
radical movements will NOT
repeat NOT accept the vote
of the electorate November five.
Radicalism, nihilism, subversive
movements will continue to un
dermine the nation.
4. A state of martial law will
eventually have to be declared
to prevent anarchy and subdue
the subversion now rampant due
to permissive policies of the
LBJ administration.
5. Devaluation of the French
franc overseas by Christmas,
1968, will result in chain reac
tion among all world currencies
and a massive U.S. stock market

crash of the 1929 type due to
$387 billion public debt and mas
sive private debt structure.
6. The Second Major Depres
sion of the 20th Century is over
due by two years (August, 1966)
on the heels of the greatest mer
ger mania in human history.
7. This is a return, '.n reverse,
of the Hoover - FDR cycle of
1932 - 1933, as President - Elect
Nixon fights an uphill battle to
remedy the abuses of the Ken
nedy-Johnson administrations.
8. Soviet Union will take de
cisive advantage of preoccupa
tion with Vietnam situation and
vulnerability of lame duck hia
tus to clamp down on the Medi
terranean Sea, forcing opening
of Suez Canal to join up with
Russian domination of Red Sea
and Indian Ocean.
9. Only tiny Israel forces on
the east bank of the Suez Canal
represent the western world key
to block Soviet Aggression in
the Middle East.
