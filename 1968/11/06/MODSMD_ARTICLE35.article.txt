Mr
Editor, The Daily:
In a recent letter to The Daily,
Mr. Hoffman objects to the de
mands of the Political Science
TA's for payment of $300 for
each dependent on the ground
that the University would thus
be "making the population bomb
tick faster." The TA's "should
act responsibly and demand that
Stanford SUBTRACT $300 for
each dependent."
This reasoning is based on the
popular fallacy that smog, traf
fic congestion, and pollution are
chiefly due to "indiscriminate re
production."
To tack this label on Stanford
TA's is amusing, though hardly
accurate. TA's as a group post
pone marriage and childbearing
far beyond the U.S. norm and
are members of a group that
contributes far less than its
share to the U.S. birth rate.
The present bir th rate (the
lowest in our history) has little
to do with causing our environ
mental problems. Anyone who
makes even a casual study of

the situation realizes that popu
lation growth in California, and
especially in Los Angeles and
the Bay Region, has been caused
chiefly by migration, not by our
birth rates. In 1900 the Los An
geles metropolitan area had
189,000 people; at the national
growth rate since 1900 it would
now be a nice little smogless
place of 500,000. But it isn't; it
now has a population of about
7 million.
In any case it is our misused
affluence as well as our num
bers that causes pollution. Our
wastes and our smog grow much
faster than our population. One
can scarcely think of a slower,
less direct way to reduce smog,
traffic congestion, and pollution
than by reducing the birth rate
of Stanford TA's, or indeed of
any other group in California.
We have great resources for
tackling these environmental
problems directly now. Let's get
on with it!
