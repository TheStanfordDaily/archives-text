## New 'Swimming Pool' 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
It is with pleasure that I am
able to announce that the Escon
dido Village swimming pool is
now ready for use. It is located
near McFarland in the center of
the Village, close to the play area
for older children.
Do not be deterred by the light
plywood cover: children will es
pecially enjoy the challenge of
climbing down into the (unfortu
nately muddy) water.

• 6 Excellent Year 9
Editor, The Daily:
Congratulations to The Daily
on what I observe to be the be
ginning of an excellent year. You
are providing a valuable service
to the administration, faculty,
and students (perhaps in that
order).
A good administrator knows
that in order to most effectively
fulfill the requirements of his
office he needs information. The
economics of administrative op
eration ordinarily preclude the
possibility of retaining a re
search staff of eager and issue
hungry employees such as The
Daily maintains.
Divergent viewpoints assist in
balancing the outcome of all is
sues. The Daily may be biased
in some directions, but the deci
sion makers, whose actions real
ly affect the university commun
ity, may be overbalanced with
opposing views. While the two
factions will never totally agree,
optimum equity most certainly
lies in the middle ground after
all of the views have been con
sidered.

• There Is A Choice
Editor, THE DAILY:
During the closing weeks of
the presidential campaign I have
become increasingly disgruntled
by the prevailing apathetic atti
tude which pervades the campus
with regard to the presidential
candidates. This attitude is espe
cially exhibited by the many dis
illusioned McCarthy supporters
who somehow "cannot find it in
their hearts to support Hubert
Humphrey." The McCarthyites'
the New

Politics Committee, while per
haps favoring Humphrey, will do
nothing to help elect him.
The next four years are looked
upon with rather smug anticipa
tion as a time to recoup scat
tered forces and build strength
for a new crusade, even if that
means enduring Richard Nixon.
The possibility of Nixon winning
a second term has been conven
iently overlooked.
The choice we are left with
may seem unfortunate to many,
and it may require a sacrifice of
pride to make it, but there IS
a choice. Although Humphrey
lacks the qualifications for ready
student acceptance, much more
so admiration, he is certainly
preferable to Nixon, as anyone
can see who looks beyond Hum
phrey's relatively powerless po
sition as Vice-President. The
added possibility of an Agnew
presidency is too horrifying to
contemplate. It may already be
too late to salvage California,
but '72 is four years hence, and
we cannot wait that long.

• Down With Porcinity
Editor, THE DAILY:
As one of the—l believe —many
conservative Americans with a
clear conscience, I have listened,
mute, long enough to the more
radical activists' imputations of
porcinity. I am called a fascist
pig because I do not believe that
all policemen are Nazi automata.
In fact, some of the most human
individuals I have known are
policemen, including my late
grandfather. In other contexts, I
am referred to as a capitalist pig
because I do not support a sec
ondary boycott of grapes.
I am accused of deliberate
suppression of an American mi
nority group because I feel that
this boycott breeds ill will and
accomplishes nothing toward
solving the problems of the
grape pickers. I am called a
racist pig because I do not con
demn the notion that there can
be no distinction between so
called property rights and hu
man rights.
It seems a shame that Wil
liam Golding's apt portrayal of
frenzied chants of "kill the pig—
kill the pig" does undeniably re

fleet a sick society living in mor
tal fear of an imagined beast.
This brand of insanity exists on
both sides of the political spec
trum. Why can't we realize that
demagoguery at both ends can
only lead to conflagration of the
whole? Instead of kindling fires,
we should be searching for more
effective measures to inspire hu
manity to live in closer har
mony, with each individual do
ing his own part.

• Football Fans
Editor, The Daily:
What a bunch of weenie foot
ball fans. Support the team
when it wins, walk out on it
and try to disown it when it
loses. Keep it up, people.
