### JOHNIE SCOTT 
Dear Mr. President,
This letter comes to you from
a very strange sort of cat. I
know folk who, soon as I open
my mouth, are quick to holler
out, "Don't pay the dude no at
tention, he's on an ego-trip."
Some of them go a little bit fur
ther by adding, "The cat is out.
strictly for himself. He don't
care about who gets in his way,
and he uses that 'ghetto-line
jive' only to make himself
heard!"
My folks, but there are others.
Check this out, Mr. President,
because all of us, myself and the
people I am telling you about,
exist right here on one of your
more esteemed campuses. Not
only have we been called "Chil
dren of the Future," but we
have also set ourselves in the
front ranks, so to speak, of the
movement.
Now dig, cause what I got to
say is relevant not only to you,
Dear Sir, but to each one of us.
trying to make it thru this
place (these times) the best way
we can. Since I want to be short
and to the point, and don't want
to leave any impressions in any
body's mind that "This cat is
window-dressing, why don't he

come on to the point?," I want
you to hear these words.
They come from a man who
was an expatriate from this
country, America, for twenty
seven years, a man whose en
tire life would read as one of
our Horatio Alger tales save
that in the reality he knew, and
wrote of, he was literally a man
without a country. I refer to the
late Richard Wright, a man
whose vision (or was it afterall
only the reality) of America has
influenced the thinking of peo
ples the world over.
'Listen*
Said Wright, from his work
"WHITE MAN, LISTEN!," "Be
ware of those (black children)
to follow me, those among them
who can interpret and relate
your myths, your fairy tales. It
is they who shall tell you, in
more fierce movements than my
self, of what you have become,
of where you come from."
Now I could ramble on, and
point to those among the white
youth (Harvey Hukari, Tim
Haight, Steve Weissman, et al)
who cover all the poles of in
volved, cogent thinking as to the
freedoms we all should have, as
to the freedoms many of us
have shied away from.

I could, as well, put a so-called
"knocker" on the BSU—save
now I feel that they, as is hap
pening all across this country
of yours, are also coming in
those fringe areas of political
sophistication which will lead to
coa'itions between their West
ern, Third World, and African
peers that will have repercus
sions the profundity of which
can only be awaited.
Mr. President, I say these
things and mention these names
not because of any outstanding
qualities, or inherent dangers,
that they possess. No, it is for
other reasons, reasons now to
be spelled out, that I call your
attention not to the campuses
(your legions are already here),
but to your machinations.
Election
This election, for what it is
was worth, was the first in
which black people, or at l°ast,
the many many black people
I have spoken with, voted not
out of outstanding preferences
for the candidates, but simply
because the electoral process is
now in the hands of Our Own
World.
All future elections, all local
elections this time around, all
of these showed where, when

blacks voted, it was We who
held the balance of power. The
White Backlash, to be sure,
showed itself in the number of
votes garnered by George Wal
lace, but this was a backlash
as well against the hypocrisy of
both the GOP and the Demos.
We all understand that
changes will occur. Changes will
occur not only in the internal
structures of these parties, but
changes will take place as well
in the status of the war effort
in Viet Nam, in the status of
the Draft, in the status of the
Black Man in America, in the
concept of what "Law and Or
der" means.
Harvey Kukari was more than
right in what he said of the
political constituency (a term I
prefer to consciousness) of the
Stanford profs. But the elec
tions, the campaigning, all of
these have only demonstrated
that party tags are relevant only
insofar as you wish to quibble.
A point in example: My mother
never voted straight "Demo
cratic," or straight "Republi
can," only for those men she
felt concerned themselves with
what was/is happening here, in
this country, right now.
•Liberal Education'
The "Liberal Education" so
gloriously promenaded about,
not simply here but at all levels
of education in this country, is
an empty shibboleth—all you
need to do is call to your atten
tion an entire black high school
student body marching thru the
streets of San Francisco to de
mand simply that the truth
about what the Hell it is that
makes a ghetto-school a "Ghet
to-School" clear to the public.
They did this because they
felt that even if no one else
cared, They Did! But more than
Poly High in San Francisco, we
need to start talking about the
"Other Ghetto"—schools like
Beverly Hills High, where every
year fully 90 per cent of the
graduating class is expected to
move on to college.
It is at schools like that, not
simply the slum schools, that

you will find your drugs. But
forget the spectre of narcotics,
and talk about relevant educa
tion, talk about cultural ex
change, talk about the programs
these schools can put on for
their kids each year, and you
are talking in sentences, rhymes,
and riddles that will get your
ass kicked if you flaunt this
in the face of a black youth, on
the streets, and only on the
streets because school, and all
of your "Attitude Workshops,"
and all of the rest of your pro
grams are not going to do one
bit of good until this entire
social structure changes.
You don't need to be put off
by what I'm saying. I'm just
one voice and there are many
more. Not just here at Stanford,
but in the 12th, 11th, and 10th
grades, in the junior highs and
elementary schools, who are one
day going to be asking ques
tions and demanding answers
that no soft-spoken demeanor is
going to be able to assuage.
Genetic Theorems
An as for chaps like Bill
Shockley with his genetic theor
ems, later for him, and his
thinking, and his whole way of
life if he really believes in it.
Things are going to change, and
there ain't going to be one god
damn deceitful tear, not one
more shuck, or one more Hu
man Relations Committee, that's
going to be able to handle it.
The ghetto is more than just
poor black foil;It is more than
just the efforts of SCL.C, SNCC,
BPP, Operation Breadbasket,
more than anything like that.
You are going to have to clean
up your home, Mr. President.
Otherwise, no matter how
much you or anybody else,
might have hated Eldridge
Cleaver, Dick Gregory, Char
lene Mitchell, one truth is going
to become quite evident—"You
ain't gonna live forever cause
everybody got to die sometime.
And like the Brother said a lit
tle while ago, 'We are now liv
ing in The Time of the Last Go
'Round.' "
Overworked cliche or not.
