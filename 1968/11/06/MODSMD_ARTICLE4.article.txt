# Lytton Evening
## Police Clear Plaza 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Helmeted, club-wielding police
broke up a "Liberation Festival"
in Lytton Plaza last night, after
two bonfires were started on
University Avenue and the rear
window of a police car smashed
by a brick.
What began as an "Electoral
Wake" sponsored by the Resist
ance and featuring Joan Baez
Harris, moving from the Palm
Drive oval to downtown Paio
Alto, became a scene rcminscent
of last fall's protests in Oak
land.
After what has become a stan
dard scene on Lytton Plaza—a
rock band blasting away for
several hundred spectators—two
paper waste baskets were set
on fire in the middle of Uni
versity Avenue opposite the
plaza, and the window of a
police car was broken at the

corner of University and Ra- •
mona.
Palo Alto police them moved
in and blocked off the surround
ing streets. Police Chief William
Hydie then spoke to several
local activist leaders, including
Leno a r d Siegel, threatening
them with arrest if the Plaza
was not cleared.
People Remain
The people remained, and the
police merely surrounded th?
Plaza. But at 11 p.m., several
squads of reinforcements ar
rived—police from San Jose,
Sunnyvale, the city of Santa
Clara, and the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Office.
Twenty minutes later, the
Palo Alto police moved in on
those who remained in the Plaza
—now about 150—shoving aside
those who did not move away
fast enough.

Those remaining scattered,
and about 100 reassembled at
the corner of University and
Ramona, and the police moved
in again.
The crowd receded, the police
fol'owing them as far as Mid
dlefield Road.
Charles Kroger, a senior in
earth sciences, was arrested for
battery of a police officer—
throwing light bulbs off the roof
of the store next to Lytton
Plaza. He is now in North Coun
ty jail.
One other Stanford student,
Fred Cohen, a junior in philoso
phy, was arrested. He was
charged with failure to disperse
and resisting arrest. Bail for Co
hen was set at $630.
Others arrested include Paul
C. Beach, a member of one of
the bands, charged with failure
to disperse; Gary Singer, a stu
dent at Foothill College, failure
to disperse; Robert K. Shinkos
kiy, failure to disperse; Donald
Stuart, failure to disperse; Lar
ry Christiani, failure to disperse;
and a juvenile.
Chief William Hydie reported
that two policemen were injured
by rocks thrown during the me
lee.
There will be a noon rally in
White Plaza today to support
those arrested and raise legal
defense funds. Some bail money
was raised early this morning
in dorms from students up late
watching election returns.
After reaching a peak of
about 750 people, the crowd be
gan to thin out. Then the
trouble began.
Trouble Begins
Several newspaper dispensers
were moved into the street
blocking part of Emerson. A
Volkswagen bus was then
moved into the intersection of
University and Emerson, tem
porarily blocking traffic.
The Wake was concluded with
several songs, including one led
by Joan Harris. Paul Rupert,
one of the organizers of the
march, then urged the crowd to
join the Liberation Festival,
sponsored by the Students for a
Democratic Society, at Lytton
Plaza.

LYTTON PLAZA —"Mourners" arc shown being dispersed by the
Palo Alto police. They arrived there after an Electoral Wake pro
cession of black candies and Gregorian chants.
The fires were then set. A fire
truck came quickly and put out
the small blazes.
The Plaza was relatively quiet
for a while, with several speak
ers speaking to the crowd. But
at 11:20, the police moved in.

Associate Professor of Histor
Barton B.Tnstein was in t!i"
crowd when they were dis
persed. According to Bernstein,
he had arrived on the scene
only minutes before, and was
standing quietly as an observer.
Prof. Bernstein Hit
Bernstein complained that he
was hit and separated from his
wife. He told The Daily early
this morning that he plans to
file a complaint with the police
when he returns from a trip
next week.
Bernstein complained to Chief
Hydie, who told him he could
file his complaint later.
After clearing University, the
police moved over to Hamilton,
where a small group of people
were returning after previously
being dispersed, and cleared
th"<=r> others as well.
