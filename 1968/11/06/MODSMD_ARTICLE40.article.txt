# About A Nice Jewish Boy...

### CISSIE BONINI 
Diar Mom:
Philip Taubman is a nice
Jewish boy, I'm sure. But frank
ly, I'm telling you, what he
doesn't know about my son
Mark Mancall you could fill a
book (which my son, who is a
Doctor, is writing, you shouldn't
forget). A genius my Mark is—
such a nice boy (but what's
wrong with a nice profession
like a lawyer?) but languages,
you should learn a thing or two.
Who needs Finnish yet? You
should hear his Eskimo, it's a
pleasure. And Polynesian — I
wouldn't mention Yiddish (ho

should live so long, he hasn't
been in schule. . . ).
And Philip Taubman should
learn a little. My boy wouldn't
let a Grove, let alone a whole
forest in Palestine (the Arabs
could learn a little) mix together
such nice clean boys and girls.
And one thing more you should
hear yet. The money. With
SIO,OOO, such a nice dentist prac
tice he could establish. And what
is he doing? Paris, yet. Let me
tell you, you should have such
tsuris.
My heart is bleeding a little—
Mrs. Mancall

Dear Mrs. Mancall:
Oi! Mishegas.
Shalom,
Dear Mom, Mom

Dear Mom,
My Mother has a beautiful
Pucci dress with roses all over
it, and my Dad, to please her,
bought some white shoes and
painted matching roses on them.
They plan to go to a dance this
weekend and I feel embarrased.

Should I say something or is it
bettor not to hurt their feelings?

Dear .left',
I think it is lovely for people
who love each other to wear
matching sweaters or bracelets,
hut I think your father will look
foolish at the dance in white
shoes with roses painted on
them even if they do match your
mother's dress.
Deeoratively yours,
Mom
Dear Mom,
I am a black cocker spaniel
belonging to a Catholic family
in Pine Hill Two. (The faculty

housing section.) For years, I j
have been in love with a beauti- j
ful white Husky b longing to!
Prof. Robert MacAfee Brown.
Whenever I go over to see her, ,
I am chased out of the yard
with newspapers and roundly
insulted. Is this because I am '
black and a Catholic?

Dear Buddy,
No. But your problem does
have religious implications. Pro
testants believe in birth control.
Faithfully,
Mom
Dear Mom,
My father's favorite poem is
"If" by Rudyard Kipling. When
ever I approach him with any
sort of problem, he quotes parts
of it, like "If you can keep your
head when all about you, Are j
losing theirs and blaming it on
you. . . " This is driving me mad.
How can I combat it?
Frustrated
Dear Frustrated,
In theology, it is considered an
intellectual sin not to pursue an
argument to its just conclusion.
Applying this principle to your
case, you should complete your
father's quotation. For example,
"If you can keep your head
when all about you, Are losing
theirs and blaming it on you,
It's probably because you don't
understand the situation."
Poetically yours,
Mom
Dear Mom,
We know that Davie Napier
can perform weddings in Me
morial Church, but can his
young assistant minister marry
anyone?
Engaged Couple
Dear Engaged Couple,
I asked David Schilling about
this. He replied that yes, he can
marry anyone assuming they're
female and he likes them.
Engagingly,
Mom
