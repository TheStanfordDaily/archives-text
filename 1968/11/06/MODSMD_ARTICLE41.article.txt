## Revise Electoral College 
### Drew Pearson 
WASHINGTON Two things
should stand out as lessons to
the American people.
One is that they need a drastic
revision of the present extrava
gant system of raising money
whereby a candidate must either
be very wealthy or must go into
political hock to big business or
big labor to finance his cam
paign.
Second, we need a complete
revision of our complicated and
almost unworkable electoral col
lege system.
This system, inherited from
the days of George Washington,
lets the American people select
electors who are not bound to
vote for the candidates for whom
the American people vote and to
whom the electors are pledged —
except in a few states, and in
those states the penalties for not
doing so are minor. This makes
it possible, in theory at least,
for the electors to vote for any
candidate they choose, regard
less of the wishes of the people.
If the electors fail to cast a
majority vote for any candidate,
power to elect the President
then passes to the Mouse of Rep
resentatives, where the Con
gressmen from each state are
free to vote for any one of the
three top candidates selected by
the electoral college.
Yet the Constitution provides
that in the House each state
delegation has just one vote.
That vote would be determined
by a poll of the delegation. But
if a state delegation should be
evenly divided and unable to
agree on a candidate by a ma
jority vote, it would not have a
vote. Further, the Constitution
requires only that a quorum of
two-thirds of the states be repre
sented in the Mouse selection of
a President.
The Constitution provides in
Article II that if the electors re
port they have failed to elect a
President, then the Mouse shall
"immediately" vote on the Presi
dent. There is no definition of
what "immediately" means, be
yond the provision that if the
Mouse shall have failed to select

a President by Intuguration Day,
then the Vice President- who in
the meantime presumably has
been selected by the Senate—
"shall act as President, as in the
case of the death or other con
stitutional disability of the Pres
ident."
Vague Constitution
The Constitution does not say
that the Vice President shall be
come President. And it does not
state how long this situation
would continue.
The Senate, like the Mouse, is
not bound to vote for the Vice
Presidential candidate with the
highest popular vote, but can se
lect either of the two top candi
dates in the electoral college
vote. And again, since the elec
toral college is not bouni by
law to vote for the most popular
candidates, it theoretically could
give enough votes to a minority
candidate —such as George Wal
lace—to make him one of the
two top candidates.
The 25th Amendment to the
Constitution, adopted after the
assassination of President Ken
nedy, provides that if the Presi
dent is removed from office, re
signs, or dies, the Vice President
shall become President. It makes
no reference to a situation in
which no President has been
elected cither by the electors or
the Mouse of Representatives.
The same amendment provides
that whenever a vacancy exists
in the office of Vice President,
the then President shall nomi
nate a Vice President, who shall
take office upon confirmation by
a majority vote of both houses
of Congress. But this amend
ment does not state what shall
be the case when the Vice Presi
dent is "acting" as President.
This raises the question of
what would happen if the Vice
President were acting as Presi
dent, as provided in Article II of
the Constitution, when no Presi
dent has been elected by Inaugu
ration Day. Would he "act" as
President for two years? Or four
years? And would he have the
power to nominate his own Vice
President ?

Several attempts have been
made to rewrite the Constitu
tion, by amendments, to cover
potential crises. Unfortunately,
none of them has gone far
enough to take care of all the
questions raised in this year's
election.
The 20th amendment, ratified
in 1933, changed the date for
starting the terms of office of
the President and Vice President
from March 4 to Jan. 20 in the
years following Presidential elec
tion days. It also tried to solve
the problem of what happens if
a President-elect dies before he
takes office or if there has been
an election deadlock. It declared
that in the event of the death
of the President-elect, "the Vice
President-elect shall become
President."
It then goes on to say that if
a President has not been chosen

by the time he should take office,
or has failed to qualify for other
reasons, "The Vice President
elect shall act as President until
a President shall have quali
fied."
But again the amendment does
not spell out how long the Vice
President shall "act" as Presi
dent, whether he actually be
comes President if no Presiden
tial candidate does qualify, or
how such a candidate can quali
fy for the office if he has not
done so by Inauguration Day.
It's all most confusing. And it
will take some expert constitu
tional lawyers with perhaps an
appeal to the Supreme Court to
straighten out the question of
who is elected if neither Nixon
nor Humphrey gets the required
270 electoral votes to make him
President.
