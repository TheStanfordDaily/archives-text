## College Cookbook 
### HELEN SHANNON 
The lure of independence. The
intrepidity of crossing El Ca
mino into the "real" world. The
house off-campus where you can
come and go as you please.
These are some of the attrac
tions behind moving off-campus.
But that romantic aura can be
lost in the first week when you
discover- that you can't cook a
decent meal.
To those of you living off
campus. Are you becoming tired
of eating hamburgers, pizzas,
and TV dinners? Do you often
hear your mother's voice asking
if you've been eating well, get
ting your vitamins, etc.? And
then do you hear your own weak
voice responding in chagrin,
that you haven't?
Then here is the thing for
you â€” THE COLLEGE COOK
BOOK: After Hamburgers,
What?
It is a collection of over 90
pages of recipes culled by the
authors from their years of
cooking for Berkeley students.
The authors show a scomewhat
maternal interest in students'
eating habits. But this should
be expected since both are moth
ers of college-age children liv
ing off campus. After all, you
must admit that mothers do
know best, at least about food.
Wow, you can impress your

roommates with Chinese Egg-
Drop Soup, Herring in Sour
Cream or Veal a la Parmigiano.
Or if you are only a neophyte,
you can learn to cook a hard
boiled egg or make salad dress
ing.
The book's authors will ex
plain to you a few things that
not even your mother will tell
you, possibly because she does
n't know. For instance, did you
know that by adding oil to boil
ing water you can prevent pasta
from sticking together?
THE COLLEGE COOKBOOK
will be a great help for all
phases of the occult art of cook

ing from buying utensils to try
ing to do something imaginative
with that can of peas you just
opened. Your first endeavors
may not taste as good as Moth
er's, but I bet you'll have the
food service beat.
