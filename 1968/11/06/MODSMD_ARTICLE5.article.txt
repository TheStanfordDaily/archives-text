LOS ANGELES (AP) — Re
publicans won two Democratic
Assembly scats and threatened
other Democrats in close races
today in their drive to win con
trol of the Legislature.
Assembly Republican incum
bents meanwhile held out against

seats would give the GOP at
least a tie with Democrats in
the 80-mcmber house.
Republican Gov. Reagan and
Democratic Assembly Speaker
Jesse M. Unruh were featured
in the legislative election cam
paigns as prominently as any of
the 200 major party candidates.
Republican leaders have said
they were confident they could
win a net gain of three Assem
bly seats to break the Demo
crats' 42-38 lower house ed?e and
win control of the legislature to
push through Reagan's pro
grams. Unruh's speakership de
pended on Democratic Assembly
control.
Incumbents Republicans re
elected Tuesday include Assem
bly Minority Leader Robert T.
Monagan of Tracy and Assem
blymen Carl A. Britschgi of Red
wood City, Don Mulford of
Piedmont, John G. Veneman of
Modesto.
Democratic Assemblymen re
elected in early returns were
Robert W. Crown of Alameda,
John J. Miller of Berkeley, Car
los Bee of Hayward and March
Fong of Oakland.
In early returns, Republicans
were leading incumbent Assem
bly Democrats in the sth, 9th,
36th, 41st, 44th and 79th districts.
In the Senate, with a 20-20
party split, the closest races were

in the 9th, 11th and 15th dis
tricts with incumbents holding
early leads.
Unruh, in the 65th Assembly
district, gained an early lead
over his Republican challenger
with 44 of 201 precincts report

seats in the upper house will
be contested in the 1970 election.
Senators serve four-year terms
and assemblymen serve two
years.
Proposition 9, the Watson
amendment for property tax re
lief, appeared headed for a
sound defeat Tuesday night,
while an alternate program,
Prop. 1-A, held a growing lead.
Prop. 1-A was placed on the
ballot by the Legislature and had
strong support from Gov. Rea
gan.
Much of the vote against
Prop. 9 came from Los Angeles
County, home of Assessor Philip
E. Watson, sponsor of the propo
sal and the man for whom it
was named.
Voters seemed to be rejecting
Prop. 1, a measure to let the
Legislature determine whether
the state superintendent of pub
lic instruction should be elected
or appointed. He is presently
elected.
But they seemed to be support
ing Prop. 3, a $200 million bond
issue for higher education facili

or replace rundown urban ele
mentary and high schools built
before 1943.

With 2,357 of 21,590 precincts
