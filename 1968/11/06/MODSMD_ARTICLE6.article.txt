LOS ANGELES (AP) — Con
trol of California's 38-member
congressional delegation hung in
the balance today as most in
cumbents forged to victory in
the tally of Tuesday's ballots,
but close races developed in
areas whose Republicans hoped
to make gains.
Going into the election, Demo
crats controlled the delegation
21-17. Republicans particularly
hoped to win a majority this
year because of the chance the
choosing of a president would
go into the U.S. House of Repre
sentatives.
By early morning, six Repub
licans and seven incumbent
Democrats had clear victories.
Democrats and Republicans each
wer£ leading in eight districts
with the rest not reporting.
The balance would swing with
the outcome of half a dozen
slow-reporting Democratic dis
tricts where Republicans con
centrated for victory.
All but one of the incumbents
was up for re-election.
One of the first to breeze to
victory was Rep. Paul N. Me-
Closkey Jr. (R., Portola Valley),
