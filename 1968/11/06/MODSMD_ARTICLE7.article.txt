# Students Cheer Election As Social Event
## 
### BARBARA HYLAND 
Following the example of
Jimmy the Greek who had
placed odds on the election out
come, Stanford students last
night viewed the election re
turns almost as a sporting event.
During the day, discussion on
the candidates was limited to
quips like "Last night we'd lis
ten to Nixon put his foot in his
mouth, and then we'd turn the
channel and listen to Humphrey
put his foot in his mouth."
Phrases like "lesser of three
evils" and"I don't care who wins
as long as it isn't . . were

bantered around. Like scrabble,
the same remarks were made
with just the candidates' names
switched around.
Joking
A joking atmosphere seemed
to prevail. One religion profes
sor opened a discussion on the
problem of evil by saying "It
is particularly relevant today" - -
that drew laughter.
By dinner time students began
to get keyed for the night be
fore the TV. One could have mis
taken the election returns for the
World Series from the way stu
dents reacted.
Lounging on the floor in over
flowing rooms, students ate do
nuts and drank cider, which the
Food Service supplied. Cries of
"Good comeback," "Come on
Colorado," "Time for the big
state of New Jersey," "Bitchin',"
and "Yea, Goldwater" made them
sound like sports enthusiasts
rooting for their teams.
Wisecracks
Wisecracks and mimicking
brought laughter which added
to the gay mood. One student
said, "I'm getting drunk no mat
ter who wins." In the I-Center,

a jazz band nearly drowned out
the television.
Despite the joviality, a few
TV viewers remained silent and
looked concerned. In one row
house someone was marking fig
ures on a poll watchers' tally
sheet.
However, the feeling that this
was all some sort of a farce was
predominant. Unlike the involve
ment seen during last June's pri
maries, there was an undercur
rent of "I don't care" sentiment.
