STUDENT CONDUCT LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
Earlier this quarter, the student body voted to accept the
Committee of Fifteen proposal until March 1, 1969. This pro
posal calls for the formation of two student-faculty councils:

lative Council. Accordingly, "the SCLC is empowered to estab
lish an array of disciplinary sanctions for use by the Stanford
Judicial Council . . Its jurisdiction "shall extend to matters
of student conduct involving the Honor Code and to such non
academic conduct as may warrant disciplinary sanctions
against individual students or against membership organiza
tions of students."
