# RNA Fills The Heredity GAP
## 
### JOSHUA LEDERBERG 
Recent advances in fundamental biochemistry have
generated much speculation about genetic engineer
ing, the calculated modification or design of an or
ganism based on new knowledge of the genetic code.
Now the first factual example to illustrate such an
effort has been reported.
(The report in Nature magazine, by Drs. Stanfield
Rogers and Peter Pfuderer of the Oak Ridge (Tenn.)
National Laboratories, also indicates the broadening
functions of these laboratories, for the research was
sponsored jointly by the Atomic Energy Commission
and by the National Cancer Institute.)
In higher organisms, the genetic code is embodied
in the DNA of the chromosomes of each cell. This is
then translated into multiple copies of RWA "mes
senger" molecules and these in turn regulate the
formation of the various proteins that make up the
cell.
Some simple viruses, like the tobacco mosaic vir
us, have a simpler life cycle that bypasses the DNA.
Instead, their RNA functions both as the hereditary
material, being able to replicate as such, and as its
own messenger. The tobacco mosaic virus, a disease
of tobacco plants, has been much used for basic
studies of virus biochemistry.
Previous studies pioneered by Dr. Marshall Niren

berg had established that the triplet in messenger
RNA that reads "A-A-A-" (A standing for adenine)
is translated into the amino acid "ly<;inp" in th cor
responding protein chain. Rogers and Pfuderer used
a specific enzyme to add a chain of about 18 As to
the end of the natural tobacco mosaic virus mole
cule.
After purifying the product, they then used the
modified complex to infect tobacco plants. If the
dangling chain of AAA-triplets was translated ac
cording to modern theory, they reasoned, they
should find new substances in the infected leaves
namely strings of up to six lysines.
This is precisely what they report.
The most important point that remains to be in
vestigated is how the modified complex functions as
a virus—that is, whether it replicates itself accord
ing to expectation. This information should be avail
able very soon.
The result has mainly theoretical interest, by cor
roborating contemporary speculations about ways in
which modified viruses—and, by implication, genes
of higher organisms -can be artificially designed.
We can expect to hear soon of methods of grafting
two pre-existing sequences together, so that tobacco
mosaic virus could be extended with a more mean
ingful message than one for monotonous lysine
strings.

This could then lead, for example, to the produc
tion by virus-infected plants of precious and rare
products like human growth hormone.
Even monotonous sequences may have great eco
nomic significance. The AAA . . . modification the
oretically should exaggerate the amount of lysine
manufactured by the infected plant. Lysine is one
of the essential amino acids and many cases of mal
nutrition stem from a deficiency of lysine in the
locally available food crops.
We can readily visualize the engineering of tem
pered plant viruses that would augment the value
of the protein produced by conventional crops.
The extension of this approach to animal viruses,
furthermore, is one of the most promising approach
es to a fundamental attack on genetic defects in
man: the missing genes might be reintroduced into
afflicted children by vaccinating them with specially
engineered viruses.
There is, as always, another side to the coin. The
lead editorial in the same issue of Nature remarks
"It is hard to decide why discussion of chemical and
biological warfare has become so fashionable." But
the obvious application of this new science to mili
tary progress in anti-human, viral weapons certain
ly adds new substance to our anxieties about bio
logical warfare.

Instead, their RNA functions both as the hereditary
material, being able to replicate as such, and as its
own messenger. The tobacco mosaic virus, a disease
of tobacco plants, has been much used for basic
studies of virus biochemistry.
Previous studies pioneered by Dr. Marshall Niren

berg had established that the triplet in messenger
RNA that reads "A-A-A-" (A standing for adenine)
is translated into the amino acid "ly<;inp" in th cor
responding protein chain. Rogers and Pfuderer used
a specific enzyme to add a chain of about 18 As to
the end of the natural tobacco mosaic virus mole
cule.
After purifying the product, they then used the
modified complex to infect tobacco plants. If the
dangling chain of AAA-triplets was translated ac
cording to modern theory, they reasoned, they
should find new substances in the infected leaves
namely strings of up to six lysines.
This is precisely what they report.
The most important point that remains to be in
vestigated is how the modified complex functions as
a virus—that is, whether it replicates itself accord
ing to expectation. This information should be avail
able very soon.
The result has mainly theoretical interest, by cor
roborating contemporary speculations about ways in
which modified viruses—and, by implication, genes
of higher organisms -can be artificially designed.
We can expect to hear soon of methods of grafting
two pre-existing sequences together, so that tobacco
mosaic virus could be extended with a more mean
ingful message than one for monotonous lysine
strings.

This could then lead, for example, to the produc
tion by virus-infected plants of precious and rare
products like human growth hormone.
Even monotonous sequences may have great eco
nomic significance. The AAA . . . modification the
oretically should exaggerate the amount of lysine
manufactured by the infected plant. Lysine is one
of the essential amino acids and many cases of mal
nutrition stem from a deficiency of lysine in the
locally available food crops.
We can readily visualize the engineering of tem
pered plant viruses that would augment the value
of the protein produced by conventional crops.
The extension of this approach to animal viruses,
furthermore, is one of the most promising approach
es to a fundamental attack on genetic defects in
man: the missing genes might be reintroduced into
afflicted children by vaccinating them with specially
engineered viruses.
There is, as always, another side to the coin. The
lead editorial in the same issue of Nature remarks
"It is hard to decide why discussion of chemical and
biological warfare has become so fashionable." But
the obvious application of this new science to mili

logical warfare.
Recent advances in fundamental biochemistry have
generated much speculation about genetic engineer

In higher organisms, the genetic code is embodied
in the DNA of the chromosomes of each cell. This is
then translated into multiple copies of RWA "mes
