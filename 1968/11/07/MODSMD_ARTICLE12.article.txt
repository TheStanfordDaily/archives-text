It is only natural, as the John
son Administration nears its
end, that magazine and book
publishers should be descending
on the White House to sign up
everybody in sight for their
memoirs.
The sidewalk in front of the
White House is jammed these
days with editors carying satch
els of money that they have
been ordered to give out in ad
vances to anyone who can offer
insights into the Johnson years.
The competition for memoirs is
something fierce.
As I was leaving a White
House briefing the other after
noon, several editors ran up to
me at the gate and shoved con
tracts in front of my face.
"I don't work in the White
House,' 'I explained. "I don't
know any more about what
went on there in the last five
years than you do."
Disappointed, they turned
away from me and rushed up
to a man in overalls carrying
a bag of tools.
"What do you do in the Exec
utive Mansion?"
"I'm an electrician," he said.
"I'll give you $10,000 to write
the story of how you wired the
White House," an editor
shouted.
"Fifteen thousand," a book
publisher yelled, "if you tell us
the inside story of how Presi
dent Johnson made you change
all the bulbs."
The electrician shook his head.
"There are certain things be
tween me and the President thai
I can't talk about, even aftrr he
leaves office. They're in my

diary and that's where they're
going to stay."
"You kept a diary?" a pub
lisher asked.
"Sure. How else would I know
where all the plugs were? That's
a big house."
"I'll give you $50,000 for the
diary without reading it,"the
publisher said.
"Gosh," the electrician shook
his head. "I don't know what to
say. There's some stuff in there
that's very personal, like the
time I put in an extension cord
for the President's electric
blanket when Lynda Bird de
cided to tell her parents about
her engagement to Capt. Robb."
"What else is in the diary?"
the editor of the Ladies Home
Journal demanded.
"Well, there was the day when
Walt Rostow was briefing the
President on the Pueblo and he
got so excited he stuck his fin
ger in a socket and got a shock."
The Harper & Row editor
said, "I'll bid $100,000."
The electrician looked con
fused. "Is it worth that much?"
"Of course. You'd be the first
one to shed any light on the
Pueblo incident."
"I think I better talk this
over with my agent," the elec
trician said. "AH these offers are
bewildering. I knew my mem
oirs were worth something, but
I didn't think they would fetch
SI 00.000."
"Why not?" the Putnam pub
lisher said. "You controlled the
power in the White House,
didn't you?"
"Now that you mention it,"
the electrician said, "I guess I
did. What am I offered for the
movie rights?"

"Well, there was the day when
Walt Rostow was briefing the
President on the Pueblo and he
got so excited he stuck his fin
ger in a socket and got a shock."
The Harper & Row editor
said, "I'll bid $100,000."
The electrician looked con
fused. "Is it worth that much?"
"Of course. You'd be the first
one to shed any light on the
Pueblo incident."
"I think I better talk this
over with my agent," the elec
trician said. "AH these offers are
bewildering. I knew my mem
oirs were worth something, but
I didn't think they would fetch
SI 00.000."
"Why not?" the Putnam pub
lisher said. "You controlled the
power in the White House,
didn't you?"
"Now that you mention it,"
the electrician said, "I guess I
did. What am I offered for the
movie rights?"
It is only natural, as the John
son Administration nears its
end, that magazine and book
publishers should be descending
on the White House to sign up
everybody in sight for their
memoirs.
The sidewalk in front of the
White House is jammed these
days with editors carying satch
els of money that they have
been ordered to give out in ad
vances to anyone who can offer
insights into the Johnson years.
The competition for memoirs is
something fierce.
As I was leaving a White
House briefing the other after
noon, several editors ran up to
me at the gate and shoved con
tracts in front of my face.
"I don't work in the White
House,' 'I explained. "I don't
know any more about what
went on there in the last five
years than you do."
Disappointed, they turned
away from me and rushed up
to a man in overalls carrying
a bag of tools.
"What do you do in the Exec
utive Mansion?"
"I'm an electrician," he said.
"I'll give you $10,000 to write
the story of how you wired the
White House," an editor
shouted.
"Fifteen thousand," a book
publisher yelled, "if you tell us
the inside story of how Presi
dent Johnson made you change
all the bulbs."
The electrician shook his head.
"There are certain things be
tween me and the President thai
I can't talk about, even aftrr he
leaves office. They're in my

diary and that's where they're
going to stay."
"You kept a diary?" a pub
lisher asked.
"Sure. How else would I know
where all the plugs were? That's
a big house."
"I'll give you $50,000 for the
diary without reading it,"the
publisher said.
"Gosh," the electrician shook
his head. "I don't know what to
say. There's some stuff in there
that's very personal, like the
time I put in an extension cord
for the President's electric
blanket when Lynda Bird de
cided to tell her parents about
her engagement to Capt. Robb."
"What else is in the diary?"
the editor of the Ladies Home
Journal demanded.
