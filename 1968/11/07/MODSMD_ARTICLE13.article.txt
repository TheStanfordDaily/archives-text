• An Inhuman Farce
Editor, The Daily:
What began as a very mov
ing display of love and solidarity
was turned into a farcial game
Monday night in Palo Alto.
My feelings about the elec
tions were shared by many at
Stanford—we were presented
with no choice, or at best only
with a choice of the rate at
which injustice and death will
continue within and without
America. It had to be shown,
in our own tiny sphere, that this
was our feeling.
The candlelight procession
was, to me, a very beautiful ex
pression of these feelings. Peo
ple walking together, singing to
gether, supplying a bit of light
in a pretty dark world at par
ticularly dark times.
I felt that this was one of the
few times in my three years
here that students were moving
out of the womb of the uni
versity and creating a positive
alternative to the Richard
Daleys, Dick Nixons, and Hu
bert Humphreys.
This mood was destroyed in
the "confrontation" with the
Palo Alto police. And I blame
us, not them.
The Palo Alto authorities
clearly did not want trouble.
They did not want arrests, clear
ly they did not want any split
heads. The students did!
For those of us who unfortun
ately missed Chicago, there had
to be a miniature re-run. But
any comparison must reflect
poorly on us. Chicago—yes, con
frontation with Daley's cadres
who play a definite part in the
hate- and fear-mongering tactics
of that city was necessary, even
positive.
But the Palo Alto Safety Pa
trol! Thirty cops against seven
hundred kids! And who pro
voked whom? Bonfires, fire
works, obscenities were unnec
essary; the point I felt we were
trying to make was better made
without them.
Why has love and humanity
crept out of our struggle for a
more loving and humane soci
ety? Is it too much to remem
ber that a man in a blue uni
form (helmet and stick in
cluded)—though we may dis

agree with what he does with
his life—is still a man? Or are
the police to become merely our
sacrificial victims on some ob
scure altar of cathartic hatred?
Is this our answer to the dead
Vietnamese?
If the confrontation is to re
main a serious part of the New
Left program, why not reserve
this tactic for serious confronta
tions and not demean our strug
gle with the kind of inhuman
farce that took place Monday
night?

• Hell's Angels
Editor, THE DAILY:
My roommate and I, both stu
dious grad students, have been
repeatedly reminded in the last
few weeks of the fact that Es
condido Road is a thinly-dis
guised motorcycle dragstrip.
Throughout the day and often
far into the morning, the resi
dences along Escondido Road
are inundated with the ear-shat
tering blasts of these cycles as
they go screaming up through
the gears, reving each time to
what seems to be 15,000 RPM.
We are certainly disturbed by
this periodic high-decibel attack,
as normal conversation and
study in the dorms must simply
halt until these aspiring Hell's
Angels fade out into the distance
and their reverberations d ie
down to the extent that once
more one can hear oneself
scream. This is probably quite
bothersome to others in Stern,
Wilbur, Toyon, and the Crothers
Halls.
We would like to see the noise
levels of some of these cycles
checked for compliance with
California law, but mostly we
would like to see common cour
tesy exercised by the cycle rid
ers when they are in the resi
dence area.

• On Nature
Editor, THE DAILY:
Philip Taubman's article on
Point Reyes, which appeared in
The Daily, Tuesday, November
sth, is a perceptive reflection on
what that magnificent country,
so close at hand, can mean as
a constructive escape into nature
from the academic and suburban

pressures of Stanford and its
environs.
The open sweep of its beaches
and the starkness of its rolling
hills offer a uniquely encourag
ing backdrop for an honest con
frontation with oneself.
However, I wonder if Mr.
Ta'ubman shares my frustration
at not being allowed access by
the United States Navy to the
most impressive part of the pe
ninsula, the Point, itself.
Made for trivial reasons, ac
cording to a ranger, ("We just
don't have the facilities to han
dle tourists down there."), this
restriction limits the full flight
into freedom which a trip to the
peninsula could easily afford.
One shudders that "facilities"
are even contemplated at a place
where unparalleled beauty is de
fined by absolute rawness. None
theless, it would be consoling to
know that the National Parks
Commission planned to open the
point to the public as soon as
possible.

• "Dear Mom 99
Editor, THE DAILY:
As an unbiased observer, I
think you ought to run the
"Dear Mom" column more oft
en. Its constructive advice di
rected to real problems are of
great value to the Stanford com
munity. Its sober tone is a re
freshing contrast to the general
levity of The Daily.
It is also democratic—dealing
with faculty, staff, and students.
For example, my wife and I get
hysterical every time the column
appears.
