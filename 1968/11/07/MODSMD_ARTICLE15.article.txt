# It's No Joke

### DICK GREGORY 
Today it rained, and the people, slorping by on the street wish
ing they had their cars, have given up their summers to the recess
es of their minds. And they are intent on going on.
But the rain retains them. It hits them gently and causes a few
of them to look up and makes them think about moving through
the rain. About how the air is around each raindrop and the rain
drops are around each bit of air.
It does not thunder often in this part of California. Freshmen
should know that, in order to know how to proceed. I remember
once it thundered when I was coming home for lunch from grade
school, and the thunder-innocent girls ran off in fear. But if you
are familiar with thunder, you can wait and watch for the flash of
light before the next thunder.
Other weather can change your plans and make you stay home.
But warm and cold and wind do not seem to touch people like
rain—touch them and make them look sometimes and see exactly
where they are.
The Chinese philosopher Lao-tzu is not easy to parse. But I think
he was right in this: he said,
"In the world there is not anything more submissive and weak
than water. But for attacking what is hard and strong, no thing
can surpass it. That the weak overcomes the strong, and the sub
missive overcomes the hard, everyone in the world knows yet no
one has been able to put that knowledge into practice."
The example of the rain cannot solve all problems. But the rain
is sufficient for the rain.

The really insidious nature of
campaigning in a national elec
tion dominated by the two-party
system came into new focus for
me personally during the final
weeks of the campaign.
As an independent, write-in
candidate for President (thoiigh
my name appeared on the bal
lot in some states), I had been
circulating handbills which bore
some resemblance to a one dollar
bill. My picture appeared where
George Washington is placed on
legitimate currency. Since I
have not shaved for over a
year, any resemblance between
myself and our first President
is purely coincidental.
Federal agents entered my
campaign headquarters in Ten
nessee and in New York City
and confiscated my handbills. It
seems, according to official ex
planation, that some of my
handbills had been used in coin
changing machines. A complaint
was registered that my cam
paign literature was "bugging"
the machines.
One wonders how far ad
vanced our technology really is
if a machine cannot distinguish
between my handbills, with my
picture on them, and a legiti

mate dollar bill bearing the por
trait of George Washington! But
then again, if such confusion is
possible, perhaps the technologi
cal age holds unprecedented pos
sibilities for true integration.
It is curious and frightening
to my concept of true democ
racy to recognize that I was
only accepted by government of
ficials as a serious presidential
candidate when my literature
was "bugging" machines, both
political and economic. I was
an announced candidate for over
a year.
Yet I was never offered secur
ity protection for myself and my
family (a privilege accorded
even Harold Stassen during the
the primaries. Nor was I given
security briefings by the Presi
dent, another privelege accord
ed the preferred white candi
dates.
Once again the question must
be raised if the two-party sys
tem in America has not long
outlived its usefulness. At one
time in American history, party
conventions, and the political
platforms emerging from them,
were necessary. It was crucial
that two major party candidates
stump the country to get the
information about vital issues to
the people.
But the development of the
mass media has changed all
that. Information is so readily
available to every citizen in this
country that it is now impos
sible to get the major candi
dates to confront each other
face-to-face. The two-party can
didates seem to recognize the
danger to their personal image
of an American electorate that
is too informed.
It must also be asked who are
the real counterfeit campaigners
in this country. Is it an inde
pendent candidate who prints
his own literature and pays for
it out of his own pocket? Or
is democracy counterfeited by a

candidate who attempts to buy
his way into the White House
with the financial backing of one
of the two major parties?
It is true that I circulated a
few million pieces of campaign
literature which bore some re
semblance to a dollar bill. It
seems to me that is the only
legitimate "currency" which
should be used to "buy" votes
from the American electorate.

It is true that I circulated a
few million pieces of campaign
literature which bore some re
semblance to a dollar bill. It
seems to me that is the only
legitimate "currency" which
should be used to "buy" votes
from the American electorate.

Today it rained, and the people, slorping by on the street wish
ing they had their cars, have given up their summers to the recess
es of their minds. And they are intent on going on.
But the rain retains them. It hits them gently and causes a few
of them to look up and makes them think about moving through
the rain. About how the air is around each raindrop and the rain
drops are around each bit of air.
It does not thunder often in this part of California. Freshmen
should know that, in order to know how to proceed. I remember
once it thundered when I was coming home for lunch from grade
school, and the thunder-innocent girls ran off in fear. But if you
are familiar with thunder, you can wait and watch for the flash of
light before the next thunder.
Other weather can change your plans and make you stay home.
But warm and cold and wind do not seem to touch people like
rain—touch them and make them look sometimes and see exactly
where they are.
The Chinese philosopher Lao-tzu is not easy to parse. But I think
he was right in this: he said,
"In the world there is not anything more submissive and weak
than water. But for attacking what is hard and strong, no thing
can surpass it. That the weak overcomes the strong, and the sub
missive overcomes the hard, everyone in the world knows yet no
one has been able to put that knowledge into practice."
The example of the rain cannot solve all problems. But the rain
is sufficient for the rain.

The really insidious nature of
campaigning in a national elec
tion dominated by the two-party
system came into new focus for
me personally during the final
weeks of the campaign.
As an independent, write-in
candidate for President (thoiigh
my name appeared on the bal
lot in some states), I had been
circulating handbills which bore
some resemblance to a one dollar
bill. My picture appeared where
George Washington is placed on
legitimate currency. Since I
have not shaved for over a
year, any resemblance between
myself and our first President
is purely coincidental.
Federal agents entered my
campaign headquarters in Ten
nessee and in New York City
and confiscated my handbills. It
seems, according to official ex
planation, that some of my
handbills had been used in coin
changing machines. A complaint
was registered that my cam
paign literature was "bugging"
the machines.
One wonders how far ad
vanced our technology really is
if a machine cannot distinguish
between my handbills, with my
picture on them, and a legiti

mate dollar bill bearing the por
trait of George Washington! But
then again, if such confusion is
possible, perhaps the technologi
cal age holds unprecedented pos
sibilities for true integration.
It is curious and frightening
to my concept of true democ
racy to recognize that I was
only accepted by government of
ficials as a serious presidential
candidate when my literature
was "bugging" machines, both
political and economic. I was
an announced candidate for over
a year.
Yet I was never offered secur
ity protection for myself and my
family (a privilege accorded
even Harold Stassen during the
the primaries. Nor was I given
security briefings by the Presi
dent, another privelege accord
ed the preferred white candi
dates.
Once again the question must
be raised if the two-party sys
tem in America has not long
outlived its usefulness. At one
time in American history, party
conventions, and the political
platforms emerging from them,
were necessary. It was crucial
that two major party candidates
stump the country to get the
information about vital issues to
the people.
But the development of the
mass media has changed all
that. Information is so readily
available to every citizen in this
country that it is now impos
sible to get the major candi
dates to confront each other
face-to-face. The two-party can
didates seem to recognize the
danger to their personal image
of an American electorate that
is too informed.
It must also be asked who are
the real counterfeit campaigners
in this country. Is it an inde
pendent candidate who prints
his own literature and pays for
it out of his own pocket? Or
is democracy counterfeited by a

candidate who attempts to buy
his way into the White House

of the two major parties?

pendent candidate who prints
his own literature and pays for
it out of his own pocket? Or
is democracy counterfeited by a

candidate who attempts to buy
his way into the White House
with the financial backing of one
of the two major parties?
It is true that I circulated a
few million pieces of campaign
literature which bore some re
semblance to a dollar bill. It
seems to me that is the only
legitimate "currency" which
should be used to "buy" votes
from the American electorate.

Today it rained, and the people, slorping by on the street wish
ing they had their cars, have given up their summers to the recess
es of their minds. And they are intent on going on.
But the rain retains them. It hits them gently and causes a few
of them to look up and makes them think about moving through
the rain. About how the air is around each raindrop and the rain
drops are around each bit of air.
It does not thunder often in this part of California. Freshmen
should know that, in order to know how to proceed. I remember
once it thundered when I was coming home for lunch from grade
school, and the thunder-innocent girls ran off in fear. But if you
are familiar with thunder, you can wait and watch for the flash of
light before the next thunder.
Other weather can change your plans and make you stay home.
But warm and cold and wind do not seem to touch people like
rain—touch them and make them look sometimes and see exactly
where they are.
The Chinese philosopher Lao-tzu is not easy to parse. But I think
he was right in this: he said,
"In the world there is not anything more submissive and weak
than water. But for attacking what is hard and strong, no thing
can surpass it. That the weak overcomes the strong, and the sub
missive overcomes the hard, everyone in the world knows yet no
one has been able to put that knowledge into practice."
The example of the rain cannot solve all problems. But the rain
is sufficient for the rain.

The really insidious nature of
campaigning in a national elec
tion dominated by the two-party
system came into new focus for
me personally during the final
weeks of the campaign.
As an independent, write-in
candidate for President (thoiigh
my name appeared on the bal
lot in some states), I had been
circulating handbills which bore
some resemblance to a one dollar
bill. My picture appeared where
George Washington is placed on
legitimate currency. Since I
have not shaved for over a
year, any resemblance between
myself and our first President
is purely coincidental.
Federal agents entered my
campaign headquarters in Ten
nessee and in New York City
and confiscated my handbills. It
seems, according to official ex
planation, that some of my
handbills had been used in coin
changing machines. A complaint
was registered that my cam
paign literature was "bugging"
the machines.
One wonders how far ad
vanced our technology really is
if a machine cannot distinguish
between my handbills, with my
picture on them, and a legiti

mate dollar bill bearing the por
trait of George Washington! But
then again, if such confusion is
possible, perhaps the technologi
cal age holds unprecedented pos
sibilities for true integration.
It is curious and frightening
to my concept of true democ
racy to recognize that I was
only accepted by government of
ficials as a serious presidential
candidate when my literature
was "bugging" machines, both
political and economic. I was
an announced candidate for over
a year.
Yet I was never offered secur
ity protection for myself and my
family (a privilege accorded
even Harold Stassen during the
the primaries. Nor was I given
security briefings by the Presi
dent, another privelege accord
ed the preferred white candi
dates.
Once again the question must
be raised if the two-party sys
tem in America has not long
outlived its usefulness. At one
time in American history, party
conventions, and the political
platforms emerging from them,
were necessary. It was crucial
that two major party candidates
stump the country to get the
information about vital issues to
the people.
But the development of the
mass media has changed all
that. Information is so readily
available to every citizen in this
country that it is now impos
sible to get the major candi
dates to confront each other
face-to-face. The two-party can
didates seem to recognize the
danger to their personal image
of an American electorate that
is too informed.
It must also be asked who are
the real counterfeit campaigners
in this country. Is it an inde
pendent candidate who prints
his own literature and pays for
it out of his own pocket? Or
is democracy counterfeited by a

candidate who attempts to buy
his way into the White House
with the financial backing of one
of the two major parties?
It is true that I circulated a
few million pieces of campaign
literature which bore some re
semblance to a dollar bill. It
seems to me that is the only
