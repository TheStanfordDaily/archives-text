Filing as a Conscientious Objector. The first opportunity for a
Conscientious Objector to declare himself within the framework
of Selective Service occurs when he fills out the Classification Ques
tionnaire SSS Form 100 shortly after he registers at age 18. _
Series VIII of Form 100 is headed "Conscientious Objection, it
consists of an admonition in bold-faced capitals not to sign the
series "unless you claim to be a Conscientious Objector' and the
statement "I claim to be a Coscientious Objector by reason of my
religious training and belief and therefore request the local board
to furnish me with a Special Form For Conscientious Objector (SSS
Form 150).
It should be noted that any man who does consider himsell a
Conscientious Objector is required by Selective Service regulations
to sign this statement. Otherwise, he has not provided information
about his draft status which is "true and complete to the best of
my knowledge, information and belief." ,
If a man signs series VIII in the Classification Questionnaire he
will be sent the Form 150, generally within a few weeks. If a man
does not sign Series VIII but later decides he is a Conscientious
Objector he may at any time declare himself a Conscientious Ob
jector and request the SSS Form 150. Upon request, the form must
be sent to him, and provided that he has not yet been mailed an
induction order, his file must be reopened and his claim considered.
There is often confusion about the effect which filing as a Con
scientious Objector will have upon obtaining the 2-S or other de
ferments. Filing as a Conscientious Objector in no way affects a
student classification since the 2-S is a statutory deferment.
Neither should it in any way affect the board's consideration of
any other deferment to which a man is entitled. Since the I-A-O
and I-O classifications are basic "available-for-duty" classifications
and legally equivalent to the I-A classification, they should be
claimed just as soon as a man makes clear that he is a CO. The
seriousness and credibility of a man's claim may be questioned
if he delays in making his claim during the time he is entitled to
some deferment.
Sample copies of the revised SSS Form 150 may be obtained
from the Special Services Office, Room 324, Old Union. Men are
not advised to request a sample form from a local board since the
boards invariably respond with an official dated copy which must
then be completed and returned within 30 days.
Initial Written Claim Denied. It should be stressed that the in
dividual CO who finds himself in this position needs to see a
counselor who is thoroughly familiar with Selective Service pro
cedures in order to understand in detail those procedures which
are relevant to his particular situation.
Most local draft boards seem reluctant to make a judgment about
the sincerity of a man claiming conscientious objection without
first having seen and talked with him in person. Perhaps for this

reason, a conscientious objector is seldom recognized as a result
of merely filing SSS Form 150.
A recent memo from General Hershey advised local boards that
whenever they were unable to grant a I-A-0 or I-O classification
on the basis of the first written claim and supporting material, "the
local board should invite or request the registrant to meet with it
for an interview prior to classification ... to develop further the
facts on which the conscientious objector claim is based, and the
sincerity of such claim." Many, but not all, boards are now follow
ing this procedure.
After the first consideration of his claim, the conscientious ob
jector who receives a I-A classification card has thirty days in
which to make a written request for a personal appcarance before
his local board (or to file a written appeal if he is unable or does
not wish to appear before his board.) An appearance must be
granted if requested within the thirty day period.
Selective Service regulations state that at a personal appearance
a man "may discuss his classification, point out the class or classes
in which he thinks he should have been placed, and may direct
attention to any information in his file which he believes his local
board has overlooked or to which he believes it has not given suf
ficient weight." He may also present to the board new information
which supports his claim.
At the discretion of the board, the registrant may be permitted
to have a witness present at this appearance, but he is not per
mitted to be represented by an attorney or legal counsel. After he
has been before the board, it is advisable to submit to his file a
complete summary of what was presented and discussed at th"?
personal appearance.
Shortly after this appearance, the registrant should receive a
new classification card. If still not classified as he desires, he has
thirty days from the date on this card to file a written appeal from
the classification. His board will then forward his file to the State
Appeal Board for a decision. The registrant may request that his
appeal be sent either to the appeal board which normally takes
appeals from his local board, or if he has moved, to the appeal
board in the area \Vhere he presently lives.
There is no opportunity to appear in person before a State Appeal
Board, nor is it possible for the registrant to be represented by an
attorney. Consideration of a man's claim is based entirely upon the
contents of his file. At the time he appeals, therefore, he may sub
mit whatever additional written information and evidence he can
in support of his claim.
If the registrant is denied the classification he seeks by a unani
mous vote of the appeal board, there are no further formal appeals
open to him. If, as rarely happens, the appeal board is divided in
its decision, he has the right to a further written appeal, and his
local board will forward his file to the Presidential Appeal Board
in Washington, D.C.

personal appearance.
Shortly after this appearance, the registrant should receive a
new classification card. If still not classified as he desires, he has
thirty days from the date on this card to file a written appeal from
the classification. His board will then forward his file to the State
Appeal Board for a decision. The registrant may request that his
appeal be sent either to the appeal board which normally takes
appeals from his local board, or if he has moved, to the appeal
board in the area \Vhere he presently lives.
There is no opportunity to appear in person before a State Appeal
Board, nor is it possible for the registrant to be represented by an
attorney. Consideration of a man's claim is based entirely upon the
contents of his file. At the time he appeals, therefore, he may sub
mit whatever additional written information and evidence he can
in support of his claim.
If the registrant is denied the classification he seeks by a unani
mous vote of the appeal board, there are no further formal appeals
open to him. If, as rarely happens, the appeal board is divided in
its decision, he has the right to a further written appeal, and his
local board will forward his file to the Presidential Appeal Board
in Washington, D.C.
Filing as a Conscientious Objector. The first opportunity for a
Conscientious Objector to declare himself within the framework
of Selective Service occurs when he fills out the Classification Ques
tionnaire SSS Form 100 shortly after he registers at age 18. _
Series VIII of Form 100 is headed "Conscientious Objection, it
consists of an admonition in bold-faced capitals not to sign the
series "unless you claim to be a Conscientious Objector' and the
statement "I claim to be a Coscientious Objector by reason of my
religious training and belief and therefore request the local board
to furnish me with a Special Form For Conscientious Objector (SSS
Form 150).
It should be noted that any man who does consider himsell a
Conscientious Objector is required by Selective Service regulations
to sign this statement. Otherwise, he has not provided information
about his draft status which is "true and complete to the best of
my knowledge, information and belief." ,
If a man signs series VIII in the Classification Questionnaire he
will be sent the Form 150, generally within a few weeks. If a man
does not sign Series VIII but later decides he is a Conscientious
Objector he may at any time declare himself a Conscientious Ob
jector and request the SSS Form 150. Upon request, the form must
be sent to him, and provided that he has not yet been mailed an
induction order, his file must be reopened and his claim considered.
There is often confusion about the effect which filing as a Con
scientious Objector will have upon obtaining the 2-S or other de
ferments. Filing as a Conscientious Objector in no way affects a
student classification since the 2-S is a statutory deferment.
Neither should it in any way affect the board's consideration of
any other deferment to which a man is entitled. Since the I-A-O
and I-O classifications are basic "available-for-duty" classifications
and legally equivalent to the I-A classification, they should be
claimed just as soon as a man makes clear that he is a CO. The
seriousness and credibility of a man's claim may be questioned
if he delays in making his claim during the time he is entitled to
some deferment.
Sample copies of the revised SSS Form 150 may be obtained
from the Special Services Office, Room 324, Old Union. Men are
not advised to request a sample form from a local board since the
boards invariably respond with an official dated copy which must
then be completed and returned within 30 days.
Initial Written Claim Denied. It should be stressed that the in
dividual CO who finds himself in this position needs to see a
counselor who is thoroughly familiar with Selective Service pro
cedures in order to understand in detail those procedures which
are relevant to his particular situation.
Most local draft boards seem reluctant to make a judgment about
the sincerity of a man claiming conscientious objection without
first having seen and talked with him in person. Perhaps for this

reason, a conscientious objector is seldom recognized as a result
of merely filing SSS Form 150.
A recent memo from General Hershey advised local boards that
whenever they were unable to grant a I-A-0 or I-O classification
on the basis of the first written claim and supporting material, "the
local board should invite or request the registrant to meet with it
for an interview prior to classification ... to develop further the
facts on which the conscientious objector claim is based, and the
sincerity of such claim." Many, but not all, boards are now follow
ing this procedure.
After the first consideration of his claim, the conscientious ob
jector who receives a I-A classification card has thirty days in
which to make a written request for a personal appcarance before
his local board (or to file a written appeal if he is unable or does
not wish to appear before his board.) An appearance must be
granted if requested within the thirty day period.
Selective Service regulations state that at a personal appearance
a man "may discuss his classification, point out the class or classes
in which he thinks he should have been placed, and may direct
attention to any information in his file which he believes his local
board has overlooked or to which he believes it has not given suf
ficient weight." He may also present to the board new information
which supports his claim.
At the discretion of the board, the registrant may be permitted
to have a witness present at this appearance, but he is not per
mitted to be represented by an attorney or legal counsel. After he

for an interview prior to classification ... to develop further the
facts on which the conscientious objector claim is based, and the
sincerity of such claim." Many, but not all, boards are now follow
ing this procedure.
After the first consideration of his claim, the conscientious ob
jector who receives a I-A classification card has thirty days in
which to make a written request for a personal appcarance before
his local board (or to file a written appeal if he is unable or does
not wish to appear before his board.) An appearance must be
granted if requested within the thirty day period.
Selective Service regulations state that at a personal appearance
a man "may discuss his classification, point out the class or classes
in which he thinks he should have been placed, and may direct
attention to any information in his file which he believes his local
board has overlooked or to which he believes it has not given suf
ficient weight." He may also present to the board new information
which supports his claim.
At the discretion of the board, the registrant may be permitted
to have a witness present at this appearance, but he is not per
mitted to be represented by an attorney or legal counsel. After he
has been before the board, it is advisable to submit to his file a
complete summary of what was presented and discussed at th"?
personal appearance.
Shortly after this appearance, the registrant should receive a
new classification card. If still not classified as he desires, he has
thirty days from the date on this card to file a written appeal from
the classification. His board will then forward his file to the State
Appeal Board for a decision. The registrant may request that his
appeal be sent either to the appeal board which normally takes
appeals from his local board, or if he has moved, to the appeal
board in the area \Vhere he presently lives.
There is no opportunity to appear in person before a State Appeal
Board, nor is it possible for the registrant to be represented by an
attorney. Consideration of a man's claim is based entirely upon the
contents of his file. At the time he appeals, therefore, he may sub
mit whatever additional written information and evidence he can
in support of his claim.
If the registrant is denied the classification he seeks by a unani
mous vote of the appeal board, there are no further formal appeals
open to him. If, as rarely happens, the appeal board is divided in
its decision, he has the right to a further written appeal, and his
local board will forward his file to the Presidential Appeal Board
in Washington, D.C.
Filing as a Conscientious Objector. The first opportunity for a
Conscientious Objector to declare himself within the framework
of Selective Service occurs when he fills out the Classification Ques
tionnaire SSS Form 100 shortly after he registers at age 18. _
Series VIII of Form 100 is headed "Conscientious Objection, it
consists of an admonition in bold-faced capitals not to sign the
series "unless you claim to be a Conscientious Objector' and the
statement "I claim to be a Coscientious Objector by reason of my
religious training and belief and therefore request the local board
to furnish me with a Special Form For Conscientious Objector (SSS
Form 150).
It should be noted that any man who does consider himsell a
Conscientious Objector is required by Selective Service regulations
to sign this statement. Otherwise, he has not provided information
about his draft status which is "true and complete to the best of
my knowledge, information and belief." ,
If a man signs series VIII in the Classification Questionnaire he
will be sent the Form 150, generally within a few weeks. If a man
does not sign Series VIII but later decides he is a Conscientious
Objector he may at any time declare himself a Conscientious Ob
jector and request the SSS Form 150. Upon request, the form must
be sent to him, and provided that he has not yet been mailed an
induction order, his file must be reopened and his claim considered.
There is often confusion about the effect which filing as a Con
scientious Objector will have upon obtaining the 2-S or other de
ferments. Filing as a Conscientious Objector in no way affects a
student classification since the 2-S is a statutory deferment.
Neither should it in any way affect the board's consideration of
any other deferment to which a man is entitled. Since the I-A-O
and I-O classifications are basic "available-for-duty" classifications
and legally equivalent to the I-A classification, they should be
claimed just as soon as a man makes clear that he is a CO. The
seriousness and credibility of a man's claim may be questioned
if he delays in making his claim during the time he is entitled to
some deferment.
Sample copies of the revised SSS Form 150 may be obtained
from the Special Services Office, Room 324, Old Union. Men are
not advised to request a sample form from a local board since the
boards invariably respond with an official dated copy which must
then be completed and returned within 30 days.
Initial Written Claim Denied. It should be stressed that the in
dividual CO who finds himself in this position needs to see a
counselor who is thoroughly familiar with Selective Service pro
cedures in order to understand in detail those procedures which
are relevant to his particular situation.
Most local draft boards seem reluctant to make a judgment about
the sincerity of a man claiming conscientious objection without
first having seen and talked with him in person. Perhaps for this

reason, a conscientious objector is seldom recognized as a result
of merely filing SSS Form 150.
A recent memo from General Hershey advised local boards that
whenever they were unable to grant a I-A-0 or I-O classification
on the basis of the first written claim and supporting material, "the
local board should invite or request the registrant to meet with it
for an interview prior to classification ... to develop further the
facts on which the conscientious objector claim is based, and the
sincerity of such claim." Many, but not all, boards are now follow
