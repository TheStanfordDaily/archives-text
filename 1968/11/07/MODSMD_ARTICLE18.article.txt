# The 						37th President

### 
WASHINGTON (AP)—As the
37th President of the United
States, Richard M. Nixon takes
into office with him in January
a shaky mandate to end the war
in Vietnam and to restore order
in the streets.
The Republican nominee's thin
victory over Vice President Hu
bert H. Humphrey, his Demo
cratic opponent, emphasized the
deep division remaining among
the people over the course of
American affairs.
The voters wanted a change
in the White House but they did
not want it deeply enough to
turn the Democrats out of con
trol over either house of Con
gress.
Divided Government
Thus Nixon will face the kind
of divided government ho has
said is not good for the country.
He can anticipate Democrats
may try to expand some of his

legislative proposals beyond
what he wants and may bury
others in endless committee pro
cedures.
The prospect is that a Con
gress actually controlled by a
coalition of Republicans and
Southern conservative Demo
crats would cheer the economics
in government and the decen
tralization of Washington power
Nixon has promised.
But if he chooses to overmatch
domestic cutbacks with large in
creases in defense spending as
he has hinted he might do, he
can look for a minute examina
tion of his military proposals.
He obviously can get the Sen
ate to confirm the appointment
of any suitable conservative he
might name to the Supreme
Court if Chief Justice Earl War
ren should choose to reactivate
his aborted move for retire
ment.

But if the new Republican
President cuts the funds for pro
grams which he contends have
failed to deal adequately with
the crime and riot-beset slums,
he may have to find something
more than privately financed
"black capitalism" and tax-in
centive housing programs to
meet the problems of these
areas.
Future Of Protestors
The protesting students are
not likely to stop marching be
cause Nixon was elected. And if
he finds it as difficult as Presi
dent Johnson has to produce an
honorable peace in Vietnam, he
may find the Republican-occu
pied White House picketed.
If there was any doubt that
th? voters want the war ended,
it had to be dispelled by the re
election of most of the Demo
cratic dove senators while the
Republicans were making a net
gain of at least four seats in
that body.
Nixon's victory leaves him ii}
command of a Republican party
he says was never so unified.
His cabinet appointments will be
watched for a demonstration of
whether he will invite into his
inner circles the liberals who
fought against his nomination
but campaigned for him later.

in the streets.
The Republican nominee's thin
victory over Vice President Hu
bert H. Humphrey, his Demo
cratic opponent, emphasized the
deep division remaining among
the people over the course of
American affairs.
The voters wanted a change
in the White House but they did
not want it deeply enough to
turn the Democrats out of con
trol over either house of Con
gress.
Divided Government
Thus Nixon will face the kind
of divided government ho has
said is not good for the country.
He can anticipate Democrats
may try to expand some of his

legislative proposals beyond
what he wants and may bury
others in endless committee pro
cedures.
The prospect is that a Con
gress actually controlled by a
coalition of Republicans and
Southern conservative Demo
crats would cheer the economics
in government and the decen
tralization of Washington power
Nixon has promised.
But if he chooses to overmatch
domestic cutbacks with large in
creases in defense spending as
he has hinted he might do, he
can look for a minute examina
tion of his military proposals.
He obviously can get the Sen
ate to confirm the appointment
of any suitable conservative he
might name to the Supreme
Court if Chief Justice Earl War
ren should choose to reactivate
his aborted move for retire
ment.

But if the new Republican
President cuts the funds for pro
grams which he contends have
failed to deal adequately with
the crime and riot-beset slums,
he may have to find something
more than privately financed
"black capitalism" and tax-in
centive housing programs to
meet the problems of these
areas.
Future Of Protestors
The protesting students are
not likely to stop marching be
cause Nixon was elected. And if
he finds it as difficult as Presi
dent Johnson has to produce an
honorable peace in Vietnam, he
may find the Republican-occu
pied White House picketed.
If there was any doubt that
th? voters want the war ended,
it had to be dispelled by the re
election of most of the Demo
cratic dove senators while the
Republicans were making a net
gain of at least four seats in
that body.
Nixon's victory leaves him ii}
command of a Republican party
he says was never so unified.
His cabinet appointments will be
watched for a demonstration of
whether he will invite into his
inner circles the liberals who
fought against his nomination
but campaigned for him later.
WASHINGTON (AP)—As the
