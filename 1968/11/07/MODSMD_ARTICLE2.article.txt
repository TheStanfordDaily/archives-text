SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
President Robert Smith shut
down the 18,000-student campus
at San Francisco State College
Wednesday after tough squads
of city police broke up a black
protest.
Smith and his administrators
held a two hour meeting late
Wednesday and decided to re
open the campus as usual Thurs
day morning.
There were scattered injuries
none reported serious—as po
lice moved in to break up some
2,000 demonstrators who at
times broke windows and threat
ened non-demonstrators.
No arrests were made. Black
and white students left the cam
pus quietly as requested by the
Black Students Union, whose 10
demands culminating in a strike
Wednesday morning led to the
demonstration.
School authorities said the 10
demands centered around the
BSU goal of a bigger share of
educational funds at the campus
and more voice in how it is
spent.
The last of the demands was
for reinstatement of George Ma
son Murray, a black Panther
who is a part-time instructor.
Murray was suspended recently
on order of Chancellor Glenn

Dumke of the state college sys
tem after he advised Negro stu
dents to arm themselves against
what he called a "racist admin
istration."
Dr. Smith, who opposed sus
pending Murray, told a news
conference as the campus was
being cleared that it was being
done to "protect the safety of
people from various disruptive
activities that are scaring peo
ple."
He said the disturbance, al
though relatively non-violent,
was "more acute" than earlier
ones and "complicated by stu
dent frustrations."
In Los Angeles, the district
attorney's office filed criminal
complaints Wednesday against
11 students accused of helping
seize a building at San Fernando
Valley State College in which 34
persons were held hostage for
four hours.
Police said more complaints
were being prepared.
Valley State officials said 17
students would be suspended or
disciplined.
The complaints against the
students included kidnaping, as
sault with a deadly weapon and
assault with intent to commit
great bodily harm.
