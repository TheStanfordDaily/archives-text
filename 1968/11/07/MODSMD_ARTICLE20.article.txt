# World Traveler To Speak On Nonviolent Revolution
## 
### 
Dr. Hildegard Goss-Mayr, a
leader of the International Fel
lowship of Reconciliation, will
speak on "The Christian and
Revolution," today at 4:15 p.m.,
at Tresidder Union, Room 271.
Her talk, sponsored by the Uni
versity Christian Movement, is
open to the general public.
Dr. Goss-Mayr, now one of the
most active participants in the
for non-violent revolu
tion in the modern world, was
raised in Austria in the midst of
Fascism.
Since receiving doctorates in
languages and philosophy from
the University of Vienna, she
has worked as a Traveling Sec
retary of the International Fel
lowship of Reconciliation, an or
ganization which explores the
possibilities of achieving politi
cal, religious, social and racial
justice within the framework of
non-violence.
During the last six years, she
and her husband, Jean Goss,
have concentrated their efforts
within Latin America, studying
ways in which non-violent meth

ods and attitudes might further
revolutionary change.
"It became evident to us,"
she wrote, "that pacifism in a
traditional sense meant nothing
to these countries, where radi
cal structural changes have to
take place in order to achieve
justice for the poor. Therefore
the work to be undertaken was
to study how non violent revolu
tion could be developed in a sit
uation where revolution is al
ready taking place."
Dr. Goss-Mayr helped orga
nize a series of seminars on
training for non-violent action,
throughout Latin America.
During the Second Vatican
Council she led a theological
"lobby" which influenced the
formulation of the Constitution
on the Church in the Modern
World, particularly the sections
on war, peace, and conscientious
objection. More recently she has
organized conferences in East
ern and Western Europe pro
moting understanding between
Christians and Marxists.
