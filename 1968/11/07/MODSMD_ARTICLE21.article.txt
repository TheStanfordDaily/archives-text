# A 						Reflective View Of Men, Olympics

### FRED LEESON 
"Who knows, those who ruin,
jump and throw may ennoble
this world in some way."
—Payton Jordan, Nov. 4
To Payton Jordan, tb° beauty
of the Olympic Games is compe
tition and participation in excel
lence.
Tanned by the autumn Mexi
can sun which graced much of
the recently completed XIX
Olympiad, Jordan has just re>"-
turned to his coaching duties at
Stanford after heading the
American coaches for the U.S.
track and field team at the inter
national games.
In an office decked with awards
of the past and behind a desk
scattered with notes for the fu
ture, Jordan discjjssed the games
which were marked with athlet
ic brilliance and political protest.
He expressed pride in his team
and satisfaction with the results
it earned. "I was really gratified
by the way the men met the
champions and competed."
He was less inclined to com
ment on the political aspects of
the games, however, maintain
ing the no comment approach he
took in Mexico City.
When John Carlos and Tom
mie Smith raised panther salutes
on the victory stand signifying
black power, Jordan said, "I was
surprised. I hadn't anticipated
they would do that."
Later, the United States Olym
pic Committee dismissed the pair
from the team because of their
action. "I was told (by the
USOC) what the result would
be," Jordan stated. "I didn't feel
this was in my area. I didn't
want to sit in judgment or to
act in authority."
"I didn't have reason to make
a judgment ... I was coaching
in an Olympic games, period."
Any other feelings he has kept
to himself, not a characteristic
common to most associated with
the games.
The Carlos-Smith controversy
sparked further comment, spe
cifically that anthems, flags and
medals might all be inherantly
political. Jordan disagreed:
"They are not political unless
people make them political. The
games are basically competitive

and that's why we were there."
And out of that competition
came amazing accomplishments,
three of which were of particu
lar surprise to the American
head coach.
Among them was Bob Bea
mons's startling broad jump,
which superseded the old record
by a full 18 inches. "Everything
was just right," Jordan com
mented, pointing to the air den
sity, track conditions and wind
speed. "It was a magnificent
jump."
As equally impressive in Jor-

dan's view was Britain's David
Hemery in the 400 meter hur
dles, who bested the world rec
ord by an entire second at 48.1.
A 1 Oerter's fourth consecutive
gold medal in the discus also
won Jordan's hearty congratula
tions. Never in history has one
man dominated his event for 16
years. "It was an epic feat in
the Olympics," Jordon asserted.
Even with the remarkable pro
ficiency of athletes in Olympic
competition, coaches can serve
in a greater capacity than help
ing the athletes get prepared
psychologically.
"It's a misconception," Jordan
declared, "that great champions
don't need coaching. The cham
pions are more apt to seek
coaching than the average be
ginner. They seek help and ac
cept help, and that's why they
are champions."
And working in the Olympics
was a pleasurable experience for
the Stanford mentor. "I was
thrilled with the privilege and
honor of working with the great
est athletes in the world."
Further, he added, "I have a
deep love for the sport, the ath
lete and the country. It may be
old fashioned, but I think these
things are still important."

THE AGONY OF DEFEAT —
Stanford linebacker Don Parish
is the image of disappointment
as he sits dejectedly on the side
lines during the Tribe's loss to
Oregon State. Parish found little
solace in the fact that he played
one of the finest games of his
career, making a remarkable 23
tackles. After the game, OSU
quarterback Steve Preece called
Parish "the best linebacker we've
faced this year."

people make them political. The
games are basically competitive

and that's why we were there."
And out of that competition
came amazing accomplishments,
three of which were of particu
lar surprise to the American
head coach.
Among them was Bob Bea
mons's startling broad jump,
which superseded the old record
by a full 18 inches. "Everything
was just right," Jordan com
mented, pointing to the air den
sity, track conditions and wind
speed. "It was a magnificent
jump."
As equally impressive in Jor-

dan's view was Britain's David
Hemery in the 400 meter hur
dles, who bested the world rec
ord by an entire second at 48.1.
A 1 Oerter's fourth consecutive
gold medal in the discus also
won Jordan's hearty congratula
tions. Never in history has one
man dominated his event for 16
years. "It was an epic feat in
the Olympics," Jordon asserted.
Even with the remarkable pro
ficiency of athletes in Olympic
competition, coaches can serve
in a greater capacity than help
ing the athletes get prepared
psychologically.
"It's a misconception," Jordan
declared, "that great champions
don't need coaching. The cham
pions are more apt to seek
coaching than the average be
ginner. They seek help and ac
cept help, and that's why they
are champions."
And working in the Olympics
was a pleasurable experience for
the Stanford mentor. "I was
thrilled with the privilege and
honor of working with the great
est athletes in the world."
Further, he added, "I have a
deep love for the sport, the ath
lete and the country. It may be
old fashioned, but I think these
things are still important."

"Who knows, those who ruin,

—Payton Jordan, Nov. 4
To Payton Jordan, tb° beauty
of the Olympic Games is compe
tition and participation in excel
lence.
Tanned by the autumn Mexi
can sun which graced much of
the recently completed XIX
Olympiad, Jordan has just re>"-
turned to his coaching duties at
Stanford after heading the
American coaches for the U.S.
track and field team at the inter
national games.
In an office decked with awards
of the past and behind a desk
scattered with notes for the fu
ture, Jordan discjjssed the games
which were marked with athlet
ic brilliance and political protest.
He expressed pride in his team
and satisfaction with the results
it earned. "I was really gratified
by the way the men met the
champions and competed."
He was less inclined to com
ment on the political aspects of
the games, however, maintain
ing the no comment approach he
took in Mexico City.
When John Carlos and Tom
mie Smith raised panther salutes
on the victory stand signifying
black power, Jordan said, "I was
surprised. I hadn't anticipated
they would do that."
Later, the United States Olym
pic Committee dismissed the pair
from the team because of their
action. "I was told (by the
USOC) what the result would
be," Jordan stated. "I didn't feel
this was in my area. I didn't
want to sit in judgment or to
act in authority."
"I didn't have reason to make
a judgment ... I was coaching
in an Olympic games, period."
Any other feelings he has kept
to himself, not a characteristic
common to most associated with
the games.
The Carlos-Smith controversy
sparked further comment, spe
cifically that anthems, flags and
medals might all be inherantly
political. Jordan disagreed:
"They are not political unless
people make them political. The
games are basically competitive

and that's why we were there."
And out of that competition
