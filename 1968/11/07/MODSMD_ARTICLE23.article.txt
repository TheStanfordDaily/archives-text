# The 						Inside Track
## The 						Trouble With Losing 
### Gary Cavalli 
The football season that started so promisingly for Stanford is
turning into a nightmare. The Indians (3-3-1) have not won a game
since Oct. 5.
Three straight impressive victories gave rise to early speculation
that Stanford had a chance to go to the Rose Bowl, an impression
which remained intact after the Tribe nearly upset USC the follow
ing week in a 27-24 thriller before 80,000 fans.
But since then the rose which blossomed so hopefully in the early
season has wilted and died. Understandably let down after the USC
game, the Indians tied lowly Washington* State, then blew a ball
game in Los Angeles and took it on the chin last week from Oregon
State 29-7.
With the Tribe submerged in a prolonged losing streak, a certain
type of fan has once again asserted himself at the Stanford foot
ball games. This is the second-guesser, the armchair quarterback
who crawls out of the woodwork whenever the home team is losing.
The second-guesser, nestled snuggly in the bleachers far from the
field of play, can afford to be critical of the coaches, the players, and
the referees. He is not down there on the field, exposing his skills
(or lack of them) to 80,000 pairs of eyes.
He is oblivious to the physical punishment being absorbed by the
22 men on the field, the near-perfect execution of plays demanded
of each player, and the tremendous stamina, ability, determination
and fundamental knowledge required to play football. He knows
nothing of the tension, the pressure, the hopes, the dreams, the
sadness, the joy, and the despair.
Coach Under Fire
In his latest resurrection, the second-guesser has been concen
trating his criticism on Stanford head coach John Ralston. Pre
sumably seeking an outlet for his frustrations or a means of buck
ing the Establishment, the second-guesser seizes the opportunity
presented by a slumping ballclub and focuses his wrath on the
coach. Why, he screams, didn't Ralston go for the two-point con
version against WSU? Why, he balks, did Ralston go for a field
goal instead of a touchdown from the UCLA 2-yard line?
Unquestionably, all criticism is not unjustified. But to look back
on a close game from the convenient postgame vantage point of
knowing just which strategies proved successful and unsuccessful,
then trying to determine where a coach went wrong, is pointless.
As the saying goes, hindsight is always 20-20.
John Ralston's three-year contract runs out Feb. 1. Rumor has it
that alumni pressures have been extensive enough to bring about
his dismissal. But, like most rumors, there is little to back them up.
"People have a misconception about alumni pressure," Stanford
Athletic Director Chuck Taylor confided to us Tuesday. "Stanford
has practically no outside pressure, and never has had it. Of course,
there are always four, five, or a half-dozen red hots who complain
when the team isn't winning."
"The thing that bothers you is why do you tie WSU and lose to
UCLA when you outman them," Taylor went on. "And as soon as
you lose a couple of games you felt you should have won, every
body blames the coach. But we're not contemplating any changes."
"A coach at Stanford has to be the epitome of coaching ability,
because he has to make up the disadvantages of coaching at a
school which doesn't emphasize athletics," the personable Taylor
explained. "He often finds himself outmanned by athletic-oriented
schools like USC."
Taylor, Ralston Shun Excuses
Still, both Taylor and Ralston refuse to make any excuses for the
team's performance, though there are plenty of valid ones available.
"The game is awful tough to explain to yourself," said Ralston
after the unbelievable loss to UCLA in the Coliseum. "There was no
way we could lose that game. It makes me think I've been beating
my wife or doing something I'm getting punished for."
Ralston felt much the same way after OSU humbled Stanford last
Saturday. "For the first time in seven games we were fiat," he said
sadly. "I don't know why, but it's my fault. I feel badly about it."
It would have been easy for Ralston to point out the crippling
injuries Stanford has suffered to key men like Bill Shoemaker,
Bubba Brown, George Buehler, Bob Moore, and Jack Lasater. It
would have been easy for Ralston to blame the team's losses on
poor officiating and bad breaks, both of which have plagued Stan
ford for the past month. It would have been easy for Ralston to
mention the absence of versatile Mark Marquess, or to cite the
miserable weather and field conditions which contributed to the
tie with WSU and the loss to Oregon State.
But John Ralston mentioned none of these things, though they
have all been instrumental in Stanford's recent slump. John Ral
ston, a dedicated, sincere, and humble man, may not be able to
satisfy a grumbling group of second-guessing ! ,-j. But in a year
where a Spiro T. Agnew can be elected Vice-President, you can't
have everything.
