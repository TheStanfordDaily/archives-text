# Reactions To Election
## The
						Agony And The Ecstasy 
### ANN DENTON JENNY MATTHEWS 
Campus reaction to the elec
tion of Richard M. Nixon to the
Presidency ranges from agony
to apathy to ecstasy.
Administration reaction was
varied with H. Glenn Campbell,
Director of the Hoover Institute,

characterizing the election as a
"perfectly splendid thing for
our country. Mr. Nixon is a man
of great experience, abilities and
knowledge, both in the field of
foreign and domestic affairs. I
think he'll keep the country out
of wars internationally and will
bring the country back together
again domestically."
Jim Simmons, Assistant Pro
vost for Intergroup Relations,
stated he was extremely disap
pointed.
"The election was unfortunate
for those of us who are Demo
crats . . . especially since the
election slipped away through
the fingers of things such as
Chicago and Mayor Daley. . . .
We'll live through it though.
There's always '72.
Trustee David Packard opined,
"I think it's a good thing be
cause this country needs a
change right now. . . . New peo
ple and new ideas will be help
ful."
Catastrophe
Charles Drekmeier of the pol
itical science department leveled
the most severe faculty criticism
of the election saying, "It's a
catastrophe."
"The Nixon victory allows no
reason for hope on the part of
those who are disaffected and
alienated. The world is too com
plex a problem for a man of
such limited vision. Humphrey
appeared to me to be almost as
vanai, but one who had at least
some sense of his priorities.
"All I can see on the positive
side is the increased liklihood
of a Democratic Party reorgani
zation—or other coalitions more
attuned to the needs of the time.
And perhaps someday the miss
ing 40 million can be brought
back into the political system."
B. Davie Napier, Dean of the
Chapel, said, "I would not have
been elated by the victory of
any of the three candidates. The

democratic process, the system,
failed. In a nation possessed of
men of true stature, we have
elected to our highest office a
person of mediocre gifts, funda
mentally committed to the per
spectives and devices of the
past.
"It is my judgment that Am
erica has momentarily failed;
but we can redeem the failure,
if we will, in the next four
years, if we begin work immed
iately."
Democracy At Work
Milorad Drachkovitch of the
Hoover Institution had a differ
ent opinion, however, saying,
"As a Republican, I was very
pleased to see what happened.
We went through some tense
moments — it was so close. To
me, the election was a fine ex
ample of democracy at work—
the dignity of Humphrey as the
loser and the promise of Nixon
to try his best to reunify the na
tion."
In the student realm reactions
were equally divisive.
Dave Jones of the Committee
for a New Democratic Politics
quipped, "Ah Lord. I think we're
just going to have to wait and
see. What I'm upset about is
losing control of the Assembly.
We don't have any idea of how
Nixon's going to behave at all.
It doesn't look too good right
now."
Mike Kuhl, President of the
Young Republicans, called it a
"welcome conclusion to the cam
paign. In the process of deciding
just what the election meant I
would speculate that there is
going to be a great deal of dis
cussion on Republican philoso
phy."
Another student minced no
words in saying, "I think it's
repulsive. It shows the utter de
cadence of the American cap
italist political system."
