# Nixon Edges By Humphrey; Pledges To Bring American People Together
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Re
publican Richard M. Nixon, com
pleting an epic comeback from
political oblivion, narrowly won
election Wednesday as the 37th
president of the United States.
He immediately pledged full
efforts "to bring the American
people together."
Squeezing past Vice President
Hubert H. Humphrey in the crit
ical late-counting states of Illi
nois and California, Nixon har
vested 287 electoral votes—l 7
more than needed to succeed
Lyndon B. Johnson as president
and to return the White House
to Republican hands after eight
years of Democratic rule.
Democrats Control CongTess
But the Nixon victory was so
narrow—he received only 43 per
cent of the popular vote—that it
failed to generate a big enough
Republican resurgence to crack
Democratic control of Congress.
Republicans did, however, pick
up four House and five Senate
seats and five governor's chairs.
As tabulating of the avalanche
of nearly 70 million votes neared
an end, the popular vote lead
teetered between Nixon and
Humphrey.
With 93 per cent of the total
vote tabulated, the count in early
evening showed: Nixon 29,575,-
347, Humphrey 29,407,739 in

eluding votes from two slates
of electors in Alabama.
Third-party candidate George
C. Wallace received slightly
more than 9 million votes —
-\bout 13 per cent of the total.
The former Alabama governor's
emotion-charged campaign
threatened for a time to plunge
the election into the House, but
he carried only five states—all
in deepest Dixie.
Even as the last votes were
being counted, both Johnson and
Humphrey promised cooperation
and unity in the shift of execu
tive power to Nixon and his run
ning mate, Gov. Spiro T. Agnew
of Maryland. The change-over
will come with their inaugura
tion Jan. 20.
LBJ Wires Congratulations
From his Texas ranch, John
son wired congratulations to
Nixon and promised to "do ev
erything in my power to make
your burdens lighter."
"I hop? that our people will
turn now from the divisive con
tentions of the political cam
paign to a united search for
peace and social justice," John
son said.
Humphrey also sent a tele
gram to the president-elect, say
ing "you have my support in
unifying and leading the peo
ple."

"I am confident," Humphrey
said, "we shall be able to go on
with the business of building the
better America we all seek—in
a spirit of peace and harmony."
Conceding defeat, Humphrey
in a quavering voice told sev
eral hundred cheering support
ers in a Minneapolis hotel: "I've
done my best. I've lost. Mr. Nix
on has won. The democratic
process has worked its will, so
let's go on with the urgent task
of uniting this country."

A half-hour later, as the stock
market advanced with word of
his victory, a smiling Nixon
flashed the victory sign with
upraised hands and told a jubi
lant crowd in a New York City
hotel that "Bring us together"
will be the motto of his adminis
tration.
At the 55-year-old president
elect's side were his wife, Pat,
and their two daughters, Tricia,
22, and Julie, 19. They were
with him during most of the
50,000-mile campaign effort that

was beamed at "the forgotten
American . . . the nonshouter,
the nondemonstrator . . . the an
gry American with legitimate
grievances against his govern
ment."
And Nixon pounded away at
those grievances: "The longest
war in American history, the
highest taxes in American his
tory, the worst crime wave in
American history, the highest
increases in prices in a genera
tion, the lowest respect for
America we have ever had."

And Nixon pounded away at
those grievances: "The longest
war in American history, the
highest taxes in American his
tory, the worst crime wave in
American history, the highest
increases in prices in a genera
tion, the lowest respect for
America we have ever had."
WASHINGTON (AP) — Re
publican Richard M. Nixon, com
pleting an epic comeback from
political oblivion, narrowly won
election Wednesday as the 37th
president of the United States.
He immediately pledged full
efforts "to bring the American
people together."
Squeezing past Vice President
Hubert H. Humphrey in the crit
ical late-counting states of Illi
nois and California, Nixon har
vested 287 electoral votes—l 7
more than needed to succeed
Lyndon B. Johnson as president
and to return the White House
to Republican hands after eight
years of Democratic rule.
Democrats Control CongTess
But the Nixon victory was so
narrow—he received only 43 per
cent of the popular vote—that it
failed to generate a big enough
Republican resurgence to crack
Democratic control of Congress.
Republicans did, however, pick
up four House and five Senate
seats and five governor's chairs.
As tabulating of the avalanche
of nearly 70 million votes neared
an end, the popular vote lead
teetered between Nixon and
Humphrey.
With 93 per cent of the total
vote tabulated, the count in early
evening showed: Nixon 29,575,-
347, Humphrey 29,407,739 in

eluding votes from two slates
of electors in Alabama.
Third-party candidate George
C. Wallace received slightly
more than 9 million votes —
-\bout 13 per cent of the total.
The former Alabama governor's
emotion-charged campaign
threatened for a time to plunge
the election into the House, but
he carried only five states—all
in deepest Dixie.
Even as the last votes were
being counted, both Johnson and
Humphrey promised cooperation
and unity in the shift of execu
tive power to Nixon and his run
ning mate, Gov. Spiro T. Agnew
of Maryland. The change-over
will come with their inaugura
tion Jan. 20.
LBJ Wires Congratulations
From his Texas ranch, John
son wired congratulations to
Nixon and promised to "do ev
erything in my power to make
your burdens lighter."
"I hop? that our people will
turn now from the divisive con
tentions of the political cam
paign to a united search for
peace and social justice," John
son said.
Humphrey also sent a tele
gram to the president-elect, say
ing "you have my support in
unifying and leading the peo
ple."

"I am confident," Humphrey
said, "we shall be able to go on
with the business of building the
better America we all seek—in
a spirit of peace and harmony."
Conceding defeat, Humphrey
in a quavering voice told sev
eral hundred cheering support
ers in a Minneapolis hotel: "I've
done my best. I've lost. Mr. Nix
on has won. The democratic
process has worked its will, so
let's go on with the urgent task
of uniting this country."

A half-hour later, as the stock
market advanced with word of
his victory, a smiling Nixon
flashed the victory sign with
upraised hands and told a jubi
lant crowd in a New York City
hotel that "Bring us together"
will be the motto of his adminis
tration.
At the 55-year-old president
elect's side were his wife, Pat,
and their two daughters, Tricia,
22, and Julie, 19. They were
with him during most of the
50,000-mile campaign effort that

was beamed at "the forgotten
American . . . the nonshouter,
