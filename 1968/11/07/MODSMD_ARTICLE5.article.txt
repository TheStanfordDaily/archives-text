## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP)— Cali
fornia voters gave President
elect Richard Nixon the state's
40 electoral votes, sent Demo
crat Alan Cranston to the U.S.
Senate, replacing a Republican,
and ended 10-year Democratic
control of the State Assembly
in Tuesday's down-to-the-wire
election.
The state's Democratic mar
gin of 21-17 in the U.S. House
remained the same as did the
20-20 standoff in the State Sen
ate. The switch in the State As
sembly apparently meant the
state's most powerful Democrat
Jesse M. Unruh, would be forced
out of his decade of tenure as
Assembly Speaker.
Nixon, a native son, topped
Democrat Hubert Humphrey by
about 200,000, largely on his

strong showing in populous
Southern California. But the out
come did not become evident un
til 5 a.m. Wednesday, nine hours
after the polls closed.
Cranston, former state con
troller. won by more than 350,-
000 over Republican Max Raf
ferty, state superintendent of
public instruction, for the sen
ate seat of Thomas H. Kuchel.
Rafferty ended Kuchel's 15-
years in the Senate by beating
him in last June's Republican
primary, Kuchel withheld sup
port of Rafferty in Tuesday's
election.
Final complete but unofficial
returns from all 21,590 precincts
gave Nixon 3,407,851 or 48 per
cent, Humphrey 3,186,270 or 44.9
per cent and third party candi

date George C. Wallace 481,665
or 6.8 per cent.
The Senate vote for the 21,590
precincts was Cranston 3,615,261
or 51.8 per cent and Rafferty
3,275,679 or 46.9 per cent.
Voters decisively defeated a
proposition that would have
phased out property tax support
for schools and welfare. Gov.
Ronald Reagan had denounced
it as "fiscal idiocy." A counter
proposition, intiated by the leg
islature for property tax relief,
passed.
Eugene Wyman, former Dem
ocratic national committeeman
for California, said in Washing
ton that the 6.8 per cent Wallace
drew, particularly in blue collar
and suburban areas, hurt Hum
phrey.
But Leon Cooper, now Demo
cratic national committeeman,
and Humphrey's chairman in the
state, dismissed the Wallace
vote as "nuisance value." Coop
er put the blame instead on a
late start and trouble in healing
intraparty wounds.
Rafferty, who campaigned
against Cranston by depicting
him as a dove on Vietnam and
a politician of too leftist lean
ings, said Wednesday he was
"going back to my job as an
educator."

for schools and welfare. Gov.
Ronald Reagan had denounced
it as "fiscal idiocy." A counter
proposition, intiated by the leg
islature for property tax relief,
passed.
Eugene Wyman, former Dem
ocratic national committeeman
for California, said in Washing
ton that the 6.8 per cent Wallace
drew, particularly in blue collar
and suburban areas, hurt Hum
phrey.
But Leon Cooper, now Demo
cratic national committeeman,
and Humphrey's chairman in the
state, dismissed the Wallace
vote as "nuisance value." Coop
er put the blame instead on a
late start and trouble in healing
intraparty wounds.
Rafferty, who campaigned
against Cranston by depicting
him as a dove on Vietnam and
a politician of too leftist lean
ings, said Wednesday he was
"going back to my job as an
educator."
LOS ANGELES (AP)— Cali
fornia voters gave President
elect Richard Nixon the state's
40 electoral votes, sent Demo
crat Alan Cranston to the U.S.
Senate, replacing a Republican,
and ended 10-year Democratic
control of the State Assembly
in Tuesday's down-to-the-wire
election.
The state's Democratic mar
gin of 21-17 in the U.S. House
remained the same as did the
20-20 standoff in the State Sen
ate. The switch in the State As
sembly apparently meant the
state's most powerful Democrat
Jesse M. Unruh, would be forced
out of his decade of tenure as
Assembly Speaker.
Nixon, a native son, topped
Democrat Hubert Humphrey by
about 200,000, largely on his

strong showing in populous
Southern California. But the out
come did not become evident un
til 5 a.m. Wednesday, nine hours
after the polls closed.
Cranston, former state con
troller. won by more than 350,-
000 over Republican Max Raf
ferty, state superintendent of
public instruction, for the sen
ate seat of Thomas H. Kuchel.
Rafferty ended Kuchel's 15-
years in the Senate by beating
him in last June's Republican
primary, Kuchel withheld sup
port of Rafferty in Tuesday's
election.
Final complete but unofficial
returns from all 21,590 precincts
gave Nixon 3,407,851 or 48 per
cent, Humphrey 3,186,270 or 44.9
per cent and third party candi

date George C. Wallace 481,665
or 6.8 per cent.
The Senate vote for the 21,590
precincts was Cranston 3,615,261
or 51.8 per cent and Rafferty
3,275,679 or 46.9 per cent.
Voters decisively defeated a
proposition that would have
phased out property tax support
for schools and welfare. Gov.
Ronald Reagan had denounced
it as "fiscal idiocy." A counter
proposition, intiated by the leg
islature for property tax relief,
passed.
