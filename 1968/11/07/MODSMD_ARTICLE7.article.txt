# Admissions Head Snyder Resigning In June
## 
### 
Rixford Snyder, dean of ad
missions and author of more
than 22,000 letters of acceptance,
will leave his post in June to
work with the Stanford Alumni
Association.
A University search commit
tee for Dr. Snyder's, successor
will be appointed after consul
tation with appropriate faculty
groups, and will include mem

bers of the faculty, students,
and university officers.
Admission Standards
Snyder's departure will end
an era in the admissions de
partment which in recent years
has come increasingly under at
tack for "out-dated and irrelev
ant" procedures and standards.
Snyder has been the object of
much controversy for his ap
parent refusal to change with
the times, but most critics allow
that he has performed his ap
pointed tasks effectively, noting
one problem in the department
may be too strict an adherence
to rules.
In this regard, Snyder last
month announced the liberiza
tion of admissions standards.
Henceforth there will be no
fixed requirements for admis
sions as there were in the past.
New Position
Snyder will become director of
alumni attitude research and di
rector of alumni colleges abroad,
according to an announcement
by A. Crawford Cooley, retiring
Association president.
Snyder's career in the admis
sions office paralleled that of
Stanford's Chancellor J. E. Wal
lace Sterling, who served as
president from 1949 until he be
came chancellor this year.

"Dr. Snyder's 19 years of ser
vice covered a period of increas
ing national enrollment", Chan
cellor Sterling said. "For insti
tutions such as Stanford, this
has meant a greater attention
to selectivity in admissions.
This, in turn, has involved a
heavier work load, much more

travel and interviewing, and
more exacting judgment. Dr.
Snyder's record of achievement
is praiseworthy, and is recog
nized as such by his peers across
the nation."
Minority Students Recruited
As dean of admissions, Dr.
Snyder began actively recruiting
disadvantaged minority students
"on his own initiative before the
need to do so was nearly as
widely recognized as it is to
day," said Provost Richard E.
Lyman. In 1966 the proportion of
minority students in the fresh
man class was well ahead of the
national average for all insti
tutions.
In recent years, Snyder has
participated in two studies of
admissions policies and prac
tices at Stanford. The chairman
of the two study committess,
Prof. William Clebsch, said "I
gained the clear, unqualified im
pression that nobody more than
Rixford Snyder deserves credit
for the sharp upgrading of aca
demic quality and potential in
each year's incoming freshman
class. .
