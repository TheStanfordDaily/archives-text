# ASSU Postpones Student Elections
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
Elections Commissioner Bob
Debs called off the ASSU elec
tion yesterday at 1:30 on the
basis of at least three By-Laws
violations.
The ASSU Elections Violation
Committee, meeting last night
to consider the informal com
plaints, stated that in their opin
ion everyone connected with the
voting had performed their job
satisfactorily.
Elections have been resched
uled for Monday and Tuesday of
next week. Polling will be from
9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. both days in
front of the post office, the phys
ics tank, and engineering cor
ner.
"Looseness"
Central to the controversy is
a complaint of "looseness" in the
electoral procedures that has
been lodged by Tony Maran,
a candidate for the Student Con
duct Legislative Council.
Maran walked off with be
tween 25 and 50 ballots from the
polling table at the engineering
corner as apparent proof of his
charge. Debs' tally shows that,
in fact, there were 47 more
ballots handed out than there
were students who voted.
Maran admits that he was un
familiar with the election proce

dure, but said that "it looked
obvious to me that people were
taking ballots."
The Student policeman man
ning the poll at the time main
tains that he handed out only
one ballot per voter. In Maran's
case, although he made an at
tempt to keep all ballots on the
table, "He (Maran) said some
thing to make me believe that
he had something to do with
Debs."
Maran says that he stopped
by the engineering corner poll
to protest that there was no poll
ing place in front of the physics
tank. The By-Laws prescribe
that three polls must be open.
Debs said that problems in ob
taining enough student police to
man the polls prevented him
from having more than two bal
lot boxes present.
The By-Laws also require that
the Daily publish the times and
places of voting on the day be
fore and the day of the election.
Although the paper did carry
announcements of the election,
yesterday's article failed to
meet the specific requirements.
In other election activity, It
was announced that candidates
for Head Yell Leader will be
trying out for the position at
the game this Saturday.
