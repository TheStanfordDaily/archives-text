# Demos Control Congress, GOP Gains Governorships
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Democrats retained firm control
of Congress in Tuesday's elec
tion, making Richard M. Nixon
the first president since the
start of the two-party system
to take office without his party
in charge on Capitol Hill.
Although the Republicans
scored a net gain of at least four
Senate seats, it was not enough
to overcome the Democrats,
holdover margin from the 90th
Congress.
The seat of veteran Democrat
Wayne Morse hung in the bal
ance Wednesday and it appeared

that absentee ballots held the
answer to his re-election effort.
He trailed Republican Robert
Packwood, 36, a Portland law
yer, but the margin was thin.
Some 5,000 absentee ballots in
Lane County—Morse's home
were uncounted. The elections
registrar's office there said re
sults could not be expected be
fore Thursday.
Packwood's nip and tuck race
with Morse had been expected.
The campaign was a vigorous
one on both sides and Morse
came out of a narrow primary
victory with a divided party.
If Morse loses the new Sen
ate lineup will be 58 Democrats
and 42 Republicans.
Small GOP Gains
In the House, the GOP barely
dented the big Democratic ma
jority, picking up a net gain of
four seats, which left it on the
short end of a 243-192 lineup.
This was in amazing contrast
to pre-election claims by the
GOP of a gain of 20 to 30—and
to private Democratic expecta
tions of a loss of 10 or 12.
In the Senate lowa's Demo
cratic governor, Harold E.
Hughes, won the seat of retir
ing Sen. Bourke B. Hicken
looper.
Meanwhile Republicans seized
seven governorships from Dem
ocrats to capture their biggest
majority of the nation's state
houses in 15 years, mostly in
states where GOP President
elect Richard M. Nixon won big.
The victories put a total of 31
governors' chairs in Republican
hands to 19 for Democrats.
