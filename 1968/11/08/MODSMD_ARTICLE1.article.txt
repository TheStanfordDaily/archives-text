# Scholarly Serendipity
## 'Think Tank' Highly Selective 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
If you feel in the mood for
serendipity, head across Lake
Lagunita, turn into the Stanford
golf course driveway, take an
immediate left, and wind up a
steep rural road to the Center
for Advanced Study in the Be
havioral Sciences.
Pausing there on the verge of
serendipity is allowed and en
couraged for as long as a year,
but hospitality will be wanting
unless you are a brilliant, distin
guished scholar. If such require
ments are met, and 50 scholars
from the U.S. and abroad seem
to manage each year, the hos
pitality offered is extensive and
luxurious.
Only one demand is made on
Center fellows—they must think.
Since all fellows have achieved
distinction through thought, the
Center firmly believes in a lais
sez-faire approach of providing
studies, secretaries, and stipends,
leaving the direction and inten
sity of thought to individual
needs and desires.
The Center is a private orga
nization. It opened in 1954 and
is funded largely by the Ford
Foundation. It has no legal ties
with Stanford other than use of
University land which it occu
pies free of charge.
Think Tank
Commonly called the "think

tank", the Center differs in fun
damental philosophy and struc
tures from other think tanks
such as the Rand Co. O. Mere
dith Wilson, executive director
of the Center, describes Rand
activities as "missionary" and
emphatically states the Center
does not do contractual or proj
ect work.
Meredith, former president of
the Universities of Minnesota
and Oregon, notes the Center
was the "first true think tank in
the country. Scholars come here
independently to think indepen
dently."
The Center, however, does not
discourage exchanges and con
tacts among its fellows. Lunch is
served daily and fellows often
discuss and argue about their
theories and beliefs. A booklet
describing the Center states,
"The Center not only encompass
es a wide range and variety of
disciplines, but also facilities a
cross-pollination among them."
"For example," the paragraph
continues, "a professor of juris
prudence and international law
exchanged views with a geneti
cist and a psychiatrist 'on the
translatability of aggression no
tions from the animal biological
to the human individual, and
thence to the level of inter-group
and international relations."
The Center also specializes in

offering and encouraging "joint
explorations in depth," an en
vironment for the solitary schol
ar or for a scholar seeking "new
perspective and fresh direction,"
and finally, presents "the oppor
tunity for serendipity."
Though the word "serendi
pity" was coined by Horace Wol
per, (not a Center fellow), the
Center prefers to use the defini
tion by Robert K. Merton in its
booklet: "The discovery through
chance by a theoretically pre
pared mind of valid findings
which were not sought for."
Fellows are chosen from a
large pool of nominees. At pres
ent, the Center is selecting fel
lows for 1970 and is already
considering some applications
for 1973. Wilson estimates there
is a pool of more than 2000 dis
tinguished scholars around the
world who have indicated some
interest in spending a year at
the Center.
Selection is made by Center
trustees chiefly using guidelines
that preclude all but "the top
2V2 per cent of eminent schol
ars" says Wilson. Age is unim
portant, Wilson states, "but fel
lows must be the leaders in their
field." The Center tries to select
20 per cent of the fellows from
abroad.
Benefits to Fellows
Fellows normally spend a year

at the Center. Most come from
other colleges and universities
on a leave of absence or a sab
batical. The Center locates local
homes for fellows and their fam
ilies, pays their way roundtrip
to the Center, and gives them a
stipend equal to the fellow's sal
ary the previous year, (half sal
ary is provided for scholars on
sabbatical who receive half sal
ary from their home institu
tions).
The Center is a spacious clus
ter of administrative and secre
tarial offices surrounded on sev
eral levels by 50 studies. Each
study is equipped with a desk,
chairs, typewriter, and "no
phone." There is a buzzer sys
tem to alert fellows to phone
calls, but phones have carefully
been ignored to increase privacy.
Most offices have broad views
of the peninsula, bay, and foot
hills. The Center is on a hill sev
eral hundred feet above the
campus next to an old barn,
once part of the Leland Stanford
farm.
Though Stanford receives no
monetary remuneration for use
of its land, the University gar
ners large recompense in terms
of faculty contact with fellows,
and, in a not infrequent event,
luring fellows onto the faculty.
Hiring of Fellows
Wilson says, "Stanford often

fishes in these waters." The
usual "fishing" develops as fac
ulty members befriend fellows in
their fields, find them interest
ing and capable, and eventually
succeed in having Stanford offer
positions to them.
Wilson notes that, "There are
more Center alumni at Stanford
than original Stanford faculty

members who have spent a year
at the Center."
Harvard has sent the most
fellows to the Center. David
Riesman is here this year—but
Stanford has not been far be
hind. This year Gabriel Almond,
political science, Marc Franklin,
law, David Potter, history, Rob
ert Sears, psychology, and Mor

ris Zelditch, sociology, are at the
Center.
If publication in the New York
Times magazine is a measure of
success and distinction, the Cen
ter has cornered the market this
year in such scholars with Da
vid Riesman and Irving Howe
who authored articles in succes
sive issues last month.

ments are met, and 50 scholars
from the U.S. and abroad seem
to manage each year, the hos
pitality offered is extensive and
luxurious.
Only one demand is made on
Center fellows—they must think.
Since all fellows have achieved
distinction through thought, the
Center firmly believes in a lais
sez-faire approach of providing
studies, secretaries, and stipends,
leaving the direction and inten
sity of thought to individual
needs and desires.
The Center is a private orga
nization. It opened in 1954 and
is funded largely by the Ford
Foundation. It has no legal ties
with Stanford other than use of
University land which it occu
pies free of charge.
Think Tank
Commonly called the "think

tank", the Center differs in fun
damental philosophy and struc
tures from other think tanks
such as the Rand Co. O. Mere
dith Wilson, executive director
of the Center, describes Rand
activities as "missionary" and
emphatically states the Center
does not do contractual or proj
ect work.
Meredith, former president of
the Universities of Minnesota
and Oregon, notes the Center
was the "first true think tank in
the country. Scholars come here
independently to think indepen
dently."
The Center, however, does not
discourage exchanges and con
tacts among its fellows. Lunch is
served daily and fellows often
discuss and argue about their
theories and beliefs. A booklet
describing the Center states,
"The Center not only encompass
es a wide range and variety of
disciplines, but also facilities a
cross-pollination among them."
"For example," the paragraph
continues, "a professor of juris
prudence and international law
exchanged views with a geneti
cist and a psychiatrist 'on the
translatability of aggression no
tions from the animal biological
to the human individual, and
thence to the level of inter-group
and international relations."
The Center also specializes in

offering and encouraging "joint
explorations in depth," an en
vironment for the solitary schol
ar or for a scholar seeking "new
perspective and fresh direction,"
and finally, presents "the oppor
tunity for serendipity."
Though the word "serendi
pity" was coined by Horace Wol
per, (not a Center fellow), the
Center prefers to use the defini
tion by Robert K. Merton in its
booklet: "The discovery through
chance by a theoretically pre
pared mind of valid findings
which were not sought for."
Fellows are chosen from a
large pool of nominees. At pres
ent, the Center is selecting fel
lows for 1970 and is already
considering some applications
for 1973. Wilson estimates there
is a pool of more than 2000 dis
tinguished scholars around the
world who have indicated some
interest in spending a year at
the Center.
Selection is made by Center
trustees chiefly using guidelines
that preclude all but "the top
2V2 per cent of eminent schol
ars" says Wilson. Age is unim
portant, Wilson states, "but fel
lows must be the leaders in their
field." The Center tries to select
20 per cent of the fellows from
abroad.
Benefits to Fellows
Fellows normally spend a year

at the Center. Most come from
other colleges and universities
on a leave of absence or a sab
batical. The Center locates local
homes for fellows and their fam
ilies, pays their way roundtrip
to the Center, and gives them a
stipend equal to the fellow's sal
ary the previous year, (half sal
ary is provided for scholars on
sabbatical who receive half sal
ary from their home institu
tions).
The Center is a spacious clus
ter of administrative and secre
tarial offices surrounded on sev
eral levels by 50 studies. Each
study is equipped with a desk,
chairs, typewriter, and "no
phone." There is a buzzer sys
tem to alert fellows to phone
calls, but phones have carefully
been ignored to increase privacy.
Most offices have broad views
of the peninsula, bay, and foot
hills. The Center is on a hill sev
eral hundred feet above the
campus next to an old barn,
once part of the Leland Stanford
farm.
Though Stanford receives no
monetary remuneration for use
of its land, the University gar
ners large recompense in terms
of faculty contact with fellows,
and, in a not infrequent event,
luring fellows onto the faculty.
Hiring of Fellows
Wilson says, "Stanford often

fishes in these waters." The
usual "fishing" develops as fac
ulty members befriend fellows in
their fields, find them interest
ing and capable, and eventually
succeed in having Stanford offer
positions to them.
Wilson notes that, "There are
more Center alumni at Stanford
than original Stanford faculty

members who have spent a year
at the Center."
Harvard has sent the most
fellows to the Center. David
Riesman is here this year—but
Stanford has not been far be
hind. This year Gabriel Almond,
political science, Marc Franklin,
law, David Potter, history, Rob
ert Sears, psychology, and Mor

ris Zelditch, sociology, are at the
Center.
If publication in the New York
Times magazine is a measure of
success and distinction, the Cen

The Center is a private orga
nization. It opened in 1954 and
is funded largely by the Ford
Foundation. It has no legal ties
with Stanford other than use of
University land which it occu
pies free of charge.
Think Tank
Commonly called the "think

tank", the Center differs in fun
damental philosophy and struc
tures from other think tanks
such as the Rand Co. O. Mere
dith Wilson, executive director
of the Center, describes Rand
activities as "missionary" and
emphatically states the Center
does not do contractual or proj
ect work.
Meredith, former president of
the Universities of Minnesota
and Oregon, notes the Center
was the "first true think tank in
the country. Scholars come here
independently to think indepen
dently."
The Center, however, does not
discourage exchanges and con
tacts among its fellows. Lunch is
served daily and fellows often
discuss and argue about their
theories and beliefs. A booklet
describing the Center states,
"The Center not only encompass
es a wide range and variety of
disciplines, but also facilities a
cross-pollination among them."
"For example," the paragraph
continues, "a professor of juris
prudence and international law
exchanged views with a geneti
cist and a psychiatrist 'on the
translatability of aggression no
tions from the animal biological
to the human individual, and
thence to the level of inter-group
and international relations."
The Center also specializes in

offering and encouraging "joint
explorations in depth," an en
vironment for the solitary schol
ar or for a scholar seeking "new
perspective and fresh direction,"
and finally, presents "the oppor
tunity for serendipity."
Though the word "serendi
pity" was coined by Horace Wol
per, (not a Center fellow), the
Center prefers to use the defini
tion by Robert K. Merton in its
booklet: "The discovery through
chance by a theoretically pre
pared mind of valid findings
which were not sought for."
Fellows are chosen from a
large pool of nominees. At pres
ent, the Center is selecting fel
lows for 1970 and is already
considering some applications
for 1973. Wilson estimates there
is a pool of more than 2000 dis
tinguished scholars around the
world who have indicated some
interest in spending a year at
the Center.
Selection is made by Center
trustees chiefly using guidelines
that preclude all but "the top
2V2 per cent of eminent schol
ars" says Wilson. Age is unim
portant, Wilson states, "but fel
lows must be the leaders in their
field." The Center tries to select
20 per cent of the fellows from
abroad.
Benefits to Fellows
Fellows normally spend a year

at the Center. Most come from
other colleges and universities
on a leave of absence or a sab
batical. The Center locates local
homes for fellows and their fam
ilies, pays their way roundtrip
to the Center, and gives them a
stipend equal to the fellow's sal
ary the previous year, (half sal
ary is provided for scholars on
sabbatical who receive half sal
ary from their home institu
tions).
The Center is a spacious clus
ter of administrative and secre
tarial offices surrounded on sev
eral levels by 50 studies. Each
study is equipped with a desk,
chairs, typewriter, and "no
phone." There is a buzzer sys
tem to alert fellows to phone
calls, but phones have carefully
been ignored to increase privacy.
Most offices have broad views
of the peninsula, bay, and foot
hills. The Center is on a hill sev
eral hundred feet above the
campus next to an old barn,
once part of the Leland Stanford
farm.
Though Stanford receives no
monetary remuneration for use
of its land, the University gar
ners large recompense in terms
of faculty contact with fellows,
and, in a not infrequent event,
luring fellows onto the faculty.
Hiring of Fellows
Wilson says, "Stanford often

fishes in these waters." The
usual "fishing" develops as fac
ulty members befriend fellows in
their fields, find them interest
ing and capable, and eventually
succeed in having Stanford offer
positions to them.
Wilson notes that, "There are
more Center alumni at Stanford
than original Stanford faculty

members who have spent a year
at the Center."
Harvard has sent the most
fellows to the Center. David
Riesman is here this year—but
Stanford has not been far be
hind. This year Gabriel Almond,
political science, Marc Franklin,
law, David Potter, history, Rob
ert Sears, psychology, and Mor

ris Zelditch, sociology, are at the
Center.
If publication in the New York
Times magazine is a measure of
success and distinction, the Cen

year in such scholars with Da

who authored articles in succes

THE SERENDIPITY MOOD —From above the ffolf course, the C enter for Advanced Study in the Be
havioral Sciences overl<»oks the campus. Fifty scholars from all over the world study there each year.
Described as "the first true think tank in the country," the Center encourages fellows to do indepen
dent thinking. The direction and intensity of thought is left up to the individual.
If you feel in the mood for
serendipity, head across Lake
Lagunita, turn into the Stanford
golf course driveway, take an
immediate left, and wind up a
steep rural road to the Center
for Advanced Study in the Be
havioral Sciences.
Pausing there on the verge of
serendipity is allowed and en
couraged for as long as a year,
but hospitality will be wanting
unless you are a brilliant, distin
guished scholar. If such require

from the U.S. and abroad seem
to manage each year, the hos
pitality offered is extensive and
luxurious.
Only one demand is made on
Center fellows—they must think.
Since all fellows have achieved
distinction through thought, the
Center firmly believes in a lais
