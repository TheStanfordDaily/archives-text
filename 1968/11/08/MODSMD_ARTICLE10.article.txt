### SKIP HARRIS 
Dear Harvey,
It's certainly good to hear
from you. Where have you
been? Unfortunately it seems
that in all your eloquence you
have spent your enthusiasm.
Perhaps now you can go back
to class resenting all us "lib
erals" and secure in the knowl
edge that now we know you
don't give a damn what we
think.
Thanks for your contribution.
You can thank any of your con
servative friends for their con
tributions also. I've got to ac
knowledge that you certainly
raised some fine points and you
raised them well. It's good to

know that you really care about
the suffocating smog of "liberal
ism" that covers this campus.
It is good to know that you care
enough to write one article for
the Daily. Only one. Congrats on
a job well done. It's too bad
you don't want to take the time
to express your opinion on any
thing else.
One doesn't want to set dan
gerous precedents, Harvey (or
anyone else that might be read
ing). Nevertheless it would be
nice to see a meaningful dia
logue develop between the dif
ferent areas of the campus.
After all, this is also a learning
institution along with being a
university. Do you catch?
