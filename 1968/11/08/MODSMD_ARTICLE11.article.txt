# Nixon's The One
## 
### 
Nixon's the one — the one elected President
of the I nitcd States by the Electoral College
with less than half of the popular vote.
For most of us at Stanford the notion of
President Nixon is going to be a hard one to
adjust to.
A significant portion of the student body and
the faculty has already expressed its abhorrence
of his selection. Even those who supported the
president-elect during his campaign are un
certain about his ability to bring the divided
country together in the face of his narrow mar
gin of victory.
Election results underscore the importance
of Nixon following through with his campaign
pledge to appoint "only the best" to his cabinet.
His administration must indeed be "open to
new ideas, open to men and women of both
parties, open to the critics as well us those
who support us ' if the next four years are to
be at all productive.
If Spiro Agnew continues his campaign ora
tory', once in office, a great deal of Nixon's ac
tivity may well be spent in controlling his
errant Vice President. We hope Mr. Agnew will
learn self-control.
The support which Mr. Nixon attracted dur
ing his campaign was significantly widespread
to convince him that his appointments to the
Supreme Court need not have the personal en
dorsement of Stro niThurrnond. The unity of the
country demands that this be the case.
Several other issues, we feel, require Nixon's

support to bring them to a final resolution.
The uncertainty about world peace necessi
tates passage of the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty. Nixon should apply all appropriate pres
sure on Congress when it reconvenes to adopt
this treaty.
Higher defense spending, even in the care
fully drawn-up budget that Nixon discussed
during his campaign, equally jeopardizes the
possibility ol world peace. The social conditions
in this country further require that the large
sums of money now being expended for defense
be given to the ghettoes.
Because of the uncertain reflection of public
opinion shown in Mr. Nixon's election, the new
President should act quickly to reform the elec
toral process, eliminate the outmoded Electoral
College and institute a national primary. Ameri
cans have a way of accepting whatever choice
the political process brings to them, but the
Electoral College seems to us to have outlived
its usefulness. Also, the long stretch of cam
paigning from the February primaries to the
November finale should lx> considerably short
ened.
Whether Nixon, faced as he is with a Demo
cratic Congrt'ss, will be able to accomplish any
thing, only time will tell. But we believe that
unless he does liberalize his campaign positions,
get us out of Vietnam, and move swiftly to help
rennovate our cities, Nixon may have only the
remnants of a nation to turn over to his suc
cessor.

November finale should lx> considerably short

Whether Nixon, faced as he is with a Demo
cratic Congrt'ss, will be able to accomplish any
thing, only time will tell. But we believe that
unless he does liberalize his campaign positions,
get us out of Vietnam, and move swiftly to help
rennovate our cities, Nixon may have only the
remnants of a nation to turn over to his suc
cessor.
Nixon's the one — the one elected President
of the I nitcd States by the Electoral College
with less than half of the popular vote.
For most of us at Stanford the notion of
President Nixon is going to be a hard one to
adjust to.
A significant portion of the student body and
the faculty has already expressed its abhorrence
of his selection. Even those who supported the
president-elect during his campaign are un
certain about his ability to bring the divided
country together in the face of his narrow mar
gin of victory.
Election results underscore the importance
of Nixon following through with his campaign
pledge to appoint "only the best" to his cabinet.
His administration must indeed be "open to
new ideas, open to men and women of both
parties, open to the critics as well us those
who support us ' if the next four years are to
be at all productive.
If Spiro Agnew continues his campaign ora
tory', once in office, a great deal of Nixon's ac
tivity may well be spent in controlling his
errant Vice President. We hope Mr. Agnew will
learn self-control.
The support which Mr. Nixon attracted dur
ing his campaign was significantly widespread
to convince him that his appointments to the
Supreme Court need not have the personal en
dorsement of Stro niThurrnond. The unity of the
country demands that this be the case.
Several other issues, we feel, require Nixon's

support to bring them to a final resolution.
The uncertainty about world peace necessi
tates passage of the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty. Nixon should apply all appropriate pres
sure on Congress when it reconvenes to adopt
this treaty.
Higher defense spending, even in the care
fully drawn-up budget that Nixon discussed
during his campaign, equally jeopardizes the
possibility ol world peace. The social conditions
in this country further require that the large
sums of money now being expended for defense
be given to the ghettoes.
Because of the uncertain reflection of public
opinion shown in Mr. Nixon's election, the new
President should act quickly to reform the elec
toral process, eliminate the outmoded Electoral
College and institute a national primary. Ameri
cans have a way of accepting whatever choice
the political process brings to them, but the
Electoral College seems to us to have outlived
its usefulness. Also, the long stretch of cam
