# mom suspects VATICAN PLOT
## 
### CISSIE BONINI 
(Ed Note: The following is an
interview "Mom" Bonini had
with John Duryea, Stanford's
Catho!ic chaplain.)
Mom: "Father Duryea, you
have been the front-runner in
the Red Hot Prof contest for the
past two days. Many people are

suggesting that the Pope is sec
retly backing you with strong
financial support, and that the
Red Hot Prof contest is just the
beginning of a sinister Vatican
plat to take over the University.
Some very knowledgable people
see the Sunday, five o'clock
mass at Mem Chu as the open
ing wedge which is culminating
in the Red Hot Prof contest.
Th r se fears have been confirmed
by a recent survey by the John
Birch Society and the K.K.K.
which proved conclusively that
there is a Catholic in every
dormitory and living group on
campus. All this is exceedingly
suspicious. Have you any com
ment?"
Fr. D.: "There have been some
misunderstandings about voting
for me in the Red Hot Prof Con
test, but I don't believe they are
tied in with a Vatican Plot. I
would like to take this oppor
tunity to tell my supporters that
I cannot offer any indulgences
no matter how much money
they put on my name. Also, the
motto, "Each time a coin in the
coffer rings another Soul from
Purgatory springs" should not
be applied to this particular con

test. I would also like to make
clrar that, no matter how much
you spend, it will not—repeat
NOT affect your penance after
confession. The Church's policy
since Vatican II definitely rules
out the forgiving of mortal sins
for money. Venial sins now. . . ."
Mrs. Bonini: "Father, do vot
ers who contribute over 50c re
ceive a free Bingo card?"
Father D: "No, And there will
not be a car raffle this quarter."
Mrs. Bonini: "Is the Sunday
collection being used to buy
votes in the Contest?"
Father D: "No, As a matter of
fact, since the "new approach"
in the Church has taken place,
many Catholics have been re
moving money from the basket
rather than contributing. Which
reminds me, if any of the Daily
readers know where the basket
is, I would appreciate its return.
We have had conflicting rumors
that it's being used by the Wil
bur Food Service to disperse
loaves and fishes, and also that
it's being used by some Physics
grad students for dirty laundry.
While many students feel quite
possessive about their "bag," I
really miss my "basket."

Red Hot Prof contest is just the
beginning of a sinister Vatican
plat to take over the University.
Some very knowledgable people
see the Sunday, five o'clock
mass at Mem Chu as the open
ing wedge which is culminating
in the Red Hot Prof contest.
Th r se fears have been confirmed
by a recent survey by the John
Birch Society and the K.K.K.
which proved conclusively that
there is a Catholic in every
dormitory and living group on
campus. All this is exceedingly
suspicious. Have you any com

Fr. D.: "There have been some
misunderstandings about voting
for me in the Red Hot Prof Con
test, but I don't believe they are
tied in with a Vatican Plot. I
would like to take this oppor
tunity to tell my supporters that
I cannot offer any indulgences
no matter how much money
they put on my name. Also, the
motto, "Each time a coin in the
coffer rings another Soul from
Purgatory springs" should not
be applied to this particular con

test. I would also like to make
clrar that, no matter how much
you spend, it will not—repeat
NOT affect your penance after
confession. The Church's policy
since Vatican II definitely rules
out the forgiving of mortal sins
for money. Venial sins now. . . ."
Mrs. Bonini: "Father, do vot
ers who contribute over 50c re
ceive a free Bingo card?"
Father D: "No, And there will
not be a car raffle this quarter."
Mrs. Bonini: "Is the Sunday
collection being used to buy
votes in the Contest?"
Father D: "No, As a matter of
fact, since the "new approach"
in the Church has taken place,
many Catholics have been re
moving money from the basket
rather than contributing. Which
reminds me, if any of the Daily
readers know where the basket
is, I would appreciate its return.
We have had conflicting rumors
that it's being used by the Wil
bur Food Service to disperse
loaves and fishes, and also that
it's being used by some Physics
grad students for dirty laundry.
While many students feel quite
possessive about their "bag," I
really miss my "basket."

interview "Mom" Bonini had
with John Duryea, Stanford's
Catho!ic chaplain.)
Mom: "Father Duryea, you
have been the front-runner in
the Red Hot Prof contest for the
