# Letters
## More Mom 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
I strongly second Charles P.
Bonini's "unbiased" motion that
the Daily ought to run the "Dear
Mom" column more often. I am
someone who is a long way from
home and a mother's loving care
and I find that the "Dear Mom"
column is a valuable substitute
for numerous deep-seated depri
vations. Besides, my own sweet
little mother, never reached by
the benevolent tentacle of the
Great Society in the Ozark foot
hills, is illiterate. So, dear Mom,
keep those letters coming. There
are those of us who need your
expansive maternal instincts des
perately.

• Sour Grapes
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Stanford Grape Boycott
Committee seems to be making
a mistake in its moral stand. For
why may the Committee attempt
to enforce its decision in favor
of a boycott on the general pub
lic? Such a derision is certainly
a right, and perhaps an obliga

tion for the members of the
Committee. But if belief that one
is correct is grounds for forcing
one's opinion on others, then
why would it be wrong for the
grape growers, say, to use force
to win their point?

• Enticement
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to protest the ad
vertisement printed in Monday's
DAILY, enticing young men to
enter the Central Intelligence
Agency's employ.
Presenting this kind of adver
tisement to the masses is highly
dangerous. If the people learn
that most of the ClA's money is
spent in procuring young talent
(as is obvious from this ad) the
masses may rise up in anger
against the CIA. They would
take this action if they realized
that the money was not being
spent on important -things like
making the world safe for Stand
ard Oil and United Fruit.
