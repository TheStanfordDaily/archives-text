# Haight: Thy neighbor

### TIM HAIGHT 
Once upon a time, there was
a foolish Emperor, who kept
strutting around the streets
with no clothes on, thinking he
was finely dressed. All the peo
ple had to bow down to him or
be thought silly for not seeing
the sheer garments—or, worse,
be thought disloyal.
Then one day, a little boy, sit
ting on his father's shoulders
as the royal parade went by
said, "The Emperor isn't wear
ing any clothes!" Immediately,
the king's guards came and
clubbed the little boy and all
the people around him, while
the greater part of the crowd
cried, "Support your local yeo
man!"
When the little boy's head
healed he left Chicago. Although

his vision had been slightly im
paired by the beating, he still
saw straight enough to know
that the Emperor was continu
ing to trot around stark naked.
So he went to the University.
First, he wrote an essav in
his English class on "The Em
peror's New Clothes." It came
back with an A+-, and the com
ment, "Brilliant! Original, verg
ing on black humor." Encour
aged, he sought out his English
teacher and asked, "Since you
seem to see my point about the
Emperor's clothes, why don't
you help me get him dressed?"
"Well," the English teacher
said, "I was really commenting
on your style. You see, it doesn't
really matter what you say
here, as long as we teach you
how to think. And it was orig
inal. But now that you mention
it, it was pretty absurd. I'm
changing your grade to B—."
Still clinging to the idea that
it's not how you say it but what
you say, the little boy took a
course in philosophy. In seminar
one day, he brought up—as a
"hypothetical example"— the
question of the Emperor's not
wearing clothes.
"That is a very interesting
case," the philosopher said, "In
fact, I did an article for a jour
nal on that in my salad days.
First of all, how do you know
the Emperor is really there?
Next, what do you define as
clothes? Third, what difference
does it make, that is, does the
sight of what you might believe
is your definition of nudity elicit
an inherent positive or negative
response? Or does it relate sem
antically to something that
does?"
"I don't know," said the little
boy.
"Exactly," said the philosopher,
"Next question?"
Somehow feeling a vague de
sire to reenter the "real" world,
the little boy visited his ROTC
instructor. The instructor said,
"You know, some enemy propa
ganda to that effect has been
coming across. We monitor the
broadcasts. And it's very clever.
To an idealistic young person,
it might very well look like the
Emperor wasn't wearing any
clothes. But he is privy to in
formation that we don't have.
It's very possible he is wearing
a suit made of material which,
if revealed, would change the
world-security picture."
The little boy was beginning
to feel there was something
wrong with him. Apparently he
was a dupe of something, some
optical conspiracy aided by for
eign substances in the drinking
water. Dejected, he went to see
his advisor. After trying his of
fice hours for a week without
success, he ran across his ad
visor at a coffee hour in the
dorm.
"You know,"the advisor said,
"when I was your age I felt
the same way. Of course, the
issue then was not clothes
but that we saw the king

in silk and us in rags. I believe
every generation has its cause.
I admire you."
"Then will you help me?"
"Oh no," the advisor said, "I'm
too old for that. And I have so
many things to do. I must show
you my collection of brass rub
bing some day."
About this time, exams came
along, and the little boy had to
put the question out of his mind.
But a few months later he took
this pill and saw a lot of really
far out things. And one of them
was the Emperor without any
clothes on. At the time he
scrawled a note about it, which
read, "The Emperor wears no
clothes because he is completely
dressed." It had seemed to make
sense at the time, but later, he
forgot the meaning.
So he asked one of his hip
friends about it, who said, "Well,
that's his bag!"
"Yeah, man," the little boy
said, "But you can get popped
for not bowing down to his
bag!"
"Groove on it, baby. Bowing
down can be a trip. It's all in
your head. The aim is affection
ate detachment."
And so things went, until one

day a lot of people started get
ting upset. It seemed that
around the time of the lunar
new year, the king stepped on a
tack. While few went so far as
to admit that the king had not
been wearing clothes, a few
courageous professors signed a
petition humbly suggesting that
perhaps the king had forgotten
his shoes.
You know the rest, the an
atomy teach-ins, the blanket
parties, finally the poll showing
that 78 percent of the people
now thought that the king
should dress differently, what
ever he used to wear. And a
hero emerged. He said:
"I'm glad you asked me that.
The king's problem has two
parts: First, the weather is get
ting colder. Second, you can see
his scar. When I am elected,
although suggesting attire
would upset things now, you
can be sure I will change kingly
style."
The kingdom was overjoyed,
and peace reigned. Until one day
when a little boy said, "The
king is running around with no
clothes on painted green!"
Moral: "Even the President of
the United States must some
times have to stand naked."

teacher and asked, "Since you
seem to see my point about the
Emperor's clothes, why don't
you help me get him dressed?"
"Well," the English teacher
said, "I was really commenting
on your style. You see, it doesn't
really matter what you say
here, as long as we teach you
how to think. And it was orig
inal. But now that you mention
it, it was pretty absurd. I'm
changing your grade to B—."
Still clinging to the idea that
it's not how you say it but what
you say, the little boy took a
course in philosophy. In seminar
one day, he brought up—as a
"hypothetical example"— the
question of the Emperor's not
wearing clothes.
"That is a very interesting
case," the philosopher said, "In
fact, I did an article for a jour
nal on that in my salad days.
First of all, how do you know
the Emperor is really there?
Next, what do you define as
clothes? Third, what difference
does it make, that is, does the
sight of what you might believe
is your definition of nudity elicit
an inherent positive or negative
response? Or does it relate sem
antically to something that
does?"
"I don't know," said the little
boy.
"Exactly," said the philosopher,
"Next question?"
Somehow feeling a vague de
sire to reenter the "real" world,
the little boy visited his ROTC
instructor. The instructor said,
"You know, some enemy propa
ganda to that effect has been
coming across. We monitor the
broadcasts. And it's very clever.
To an idealistic young person,
it might very well look like the
Emperor wasn't wearing any
clothes. But he is privy to in
formation that we don't have.
It's very possible he is wearing
a suit made of material which,
if revealed, would change the
world-security picture."
The little boy was beginning
to feel there was something
wrong with him. Apparently he
was a dupe of something, some
optical conspiracy aided by for
eign substances in the drinking
water. Dejected, he went to see
his advisor. After trying his of
fice hours for a week without
success, he ran across his ad
visor at a coffee hour in the
dorm.
"You know,"the advisor said,
"when I was your age I felt
the same way. Of course, the
issue then was not clothes
but that we saw the king

in silk and us in rags. I believe
every generation has its cause.
I admire you."
"Then will you help me?"
"Oh no," the advisor said, "I'm
too old for that. And I have so
many things to do. I must show
you my collection of brass rub
bing some day."
About this time, exams came
along, and the little boy had to
put the question out of his mind.
But a few months later he took
this pill and saw a lot of really
far out things. And one of them
was the Emperor without any
clothes on. At the time he
scrawled a note about it, which
read, "The Emperor wears no
clothes because he is completely
dressed." It had seemed to make
sense at the time, but later, he
forgot the meaning.
So he asked one of his hip
friends about it, who said, "Well,
that's his bag!"
"Yeah, man," the little boy
said, "But you can get popped
for not bowing down to his
bag!"
"Groove on it, baby. Bowing
down can be a trip. It's all in
your head. The aim is affection
ate detachment."
And so things went, until one

day a lot of people started get
ting upset. It seemed that
around the time of the lunar
new year, the king stepped on a
tack. While few went so far as
to admit that the king had not
been wearing clothes, a few
courageous professors signed a
petition humbly suggesting that
perhaps the king had forgotten
his shoes.
You know the rest, the an
atomy teach-ins, the blanket
parties, finally the poll showing
that 78 percent of the people
now thought that the king
should dress differently, what
ever he used to wear. And a
hero emerged. He said:
"I'm glad you asked me that.
The king's problem has two
parts: First, the weather is get
ting colder. Second, you can see
his scar. When I am elected,
although suggesting attire
would upset things now, you
can be sure I will change kingly
style."
The kingdom was overjoyed,
and peace reigned. Until one day
when a little boy said, "The
king is running around with no
clothes on painted green!"
Moral: "Even the President of
the United States must some
times have to stand naked."
Once upon a time, there was
a foolish Emperor, who kept
strutting around the streets
with no clothes on, thinking he
was finely dressed. All the peo
ple had to bow down to him or
be thought silly for not seeing
the sheer garments—or, worse,
be thought disloyal.
Then one day, a little boy, sit
ting on his father's shoulders
as the royal parade went by
said, "The Emperor isn't wear
ing any clothes!" Immediately,
the king's guards came and
clubbed the little boy and all
the people around him, while
the greater part of the crowd
cried, "Support your local yeo
man!"
When the little boy's head
healed he left Chicago. Although

his vision had been slightly im
paired by the beating, he still
saw straight enough to know
that the Emperor was continu
ing to trot around stark naked.
So he went to the University.
First, he wrote an essav in
his English class on "The Em
peror's New Clothes." It came
back with an A+-, and the com
ment, "Brilliant! Original, verg
ing on black humor." Encour
aged, he sought out his English
teacher and asked, "Since you
seem to see my point about the
Emperor's clothes, why don't
you help me get him dressed?"

response? Or does it relate sem
antically to something that
does?"
"I don't know," said the little
boy.
"Exactly," said the philosopher,
"Next question?"
Somehow feeling a vague de
sire to reenter the "real" world,
the little boy visited his ROTC
instructor. The instructor said,
"You know, some enemy propa
ganda to that effect has been
coming across. We monitor the
broadcasts. And it's very clever.
To an idealistic young person,
it might very well look like the
Emperor wasn't wearing any
clothes. But he is privy to in
formation that we don't have.
It's very possible he is wearing
a suit made of material which,
if revealed, would change the
world-security picture."
The little boy was beginning
to feel there was something
wrong with him. Apparently he
was a dupe of something, some
optical conspiracy aided by for
eign substances in the drinking
water. Dejected, he went to see
his advisor. After trying his of
fice hours for a week without
success, he ran across his ad
visor at a coffee hour in the
dorm.
"You know,"the advisor said,
"when I was your age I felt
the same way. Of course, the
issue then was not clothes
but that we saw the king

in silk and us in rags. I believe
every generation has its cause.
I admire you."
"Then will you help me?"
"Oh no," the advisor said, "I'm
too old for that. And I have so
many things to do. I must show
you my collection of brass rub
bing some day."
About this time, exams came
along, and the little boy had to
put the question out of his mind.
But a few months later he took
this pill and saw a lot of really
far out things. And one of them
was the Emperor without any
clothes on. At the time he
scrawled a note about it, which
read, "The Emperor wears no
clothes because he is completely
dressed." It had seemed to make
sense at the time, but later, he
forgot the meaning.
So he asked one of his hip
friends about it, who said, "Well,
that's his bag!"
"Yeah, man," the little boy
said, "But you can get popped
for not bowing down to his
bag!"
"Groove on it, baby. Bowing
down can be a trip. It's all in
your head. The aim is affection
ate detachment."
And so things went, until one

day a lot of people started get
ting upset. It seemed that
around the time of the lunar
new year, the king stepped on a
tack. While few went so far as
to admit that the king had not
been wearing clothes, a few
courageous professors signed a
petition humbly suggesting that
perhaps the king had forgotten
his shoes.
You know the rest, the an
atomy teach-ins, the blanket
parties, finally the poll showing
that 78 percent of the people
now thought that the king
should dress differently, what
ever he used to wear. And a
hero emerged. He said:
"I'm glad you asked me that.
The king's problem has two
parts: First, the weather is get
ting colder. Second, you can see
his scar. When I am elected,
although suggesting attire
would upset things now, you
can be sure I will change kingly
style."
The kingdom was overjoyed,
and peace reigned. Until one day
when a little boy said, "The
king is running around with no
clothes on painted green!"
Moral: "Even the President of
the United States must some
times have to stand naked."
Once upon a time, there was
a foolish Emperor, who kept
strutting around the streets
with no clothes on, thinking he
was finely dressed. All the peo
ple had to bow down to him or
be thought silly for not seeing
the sheer garments—or, worse,
be thought disloyal.
Then one day, a little boy, sit
ting on his father's shoulders
as the royal parade went by
said, "The Emperor isn't wear
ing any clothes!" Immediately,
the king's guards came and
clubbed the little boy and all
the people around him, while
the greater part of the crowd
cried, "Support your local yeo
man!"
When the little boy's head
healed he left Chicago. Although

his vision had been slightly im
paired by the beating, he still
saw straight enough to know
that the Emperor was continu
ing to trot around stark naked.
So he went to the University.
First, he wrote an essav in
his English class on "The Em
peror's New Clothes." It came
back with an A+-, and the com
ment, "Brilliant! Original, verg
ing on black humor." Encour
aged, he sought out his English
teacher and asked, "Since you
seem to see my point about the
Emperor's clothes, why don't
you help me get him dressed?"
"Well," the English teacher
said, "I was really commenting
on your style. You see, it doesn't
really matter what you say
here, as long as we teach you
how to think. And it was orig
inal. But now that you mention
it, it was pretty absurd. I'm
changing your grade to B—."
Still clinging to the idea that
it's not how you say it but what
you say, the little boy took a
course in philosophy. In seminar
one day, he brought up—as a
"hypothetical example"— the
question of the Emperor's not
wearing clothes.
"That is a very interesting
case," the philosopher said, "In
fact, I did an article for a jour
nal on that in my salad days.
First of all, how do you know
the Emperor is really there?
Next, what do you define as
clothes? Third, what difference
does it make, that is, does the
sight of what you might believe
is your definition of nudity elicit
an inherent positive or negative
response? Or does it relate sem
antically to something that
does?"
