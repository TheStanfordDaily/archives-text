## Police Everywhere 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
It may be of interest to the
faculty and students at Stanford
to know that plainclothes police
men are operating on campus.
They are not members of the
Stanford Police Department.
Their most obvious activity is to
photograph students who speak
at or merely attend meetings and
rallies held on campus. You need
only to be standing near a crowd
to be photographed.
People engaged in lawful
speech and assembly are now
subjected to intimidation. We
can not see any legitimate use
for police photographs of stu
dents exercising their constitu
tional rights. We had hoped that
the police were not keeping rec-

mi
w m
ords of those who engage in law
ful protest and speech. It is ob
vious that these photographs
serve no constructive purpose
and are potentially repressive.
There is also a possible long
term effect. Students applying
for security clearances may have
them denied on the basis of their
"assumed" campus associations
through the use of these photo
graphs. What we want to know
is under what conditions can the
police operate on campus? Is the
administration prepared to op
pose this activity or are they
in fact involved?
