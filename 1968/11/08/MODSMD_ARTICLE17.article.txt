# Cuth bertson Says Stanford Can Sustain Budget Deficit

### 
Thanks to past budget prac
tices, Stanford can sustain a
temporary budget deficit this
year, Vice President Kenneth
Cuthbertson said in a panel dis
cussion on University govern
ance Wednesday.
However, funds built up over
the past 15 years for just such a
contingency amount to only 10
per cent of a single year's oper
ating expenditures, "so we have
to use the time to correct the
situation" and bring income and
spending into balance as rapidly
as possible," he added.
Stanford still spends fewer
dollars per student than other
major private universities, Cuth
bertson said. But the rate of in
crease has been "far more rapid
here" than at comparable East
ern institutions.

Thrugh matching funds pro
vided from the Ford Foundation
during the PACE campaign
1961-63), the University has
moved from a second-level to a
front-ranking position in private
gift support. In addition, "the
faculty has made far better use
of the availability of (federal)
funds in strengthening the insti
tion" than other institutions.
More Active
"We're going to have to be
come more active on the legisla
tive front in seeing that the val
ue of national institutions is
kept in mind," Cuthbertson said.
While the University assumed a
leveling in federal programs for
the current year, "we got cut
off at the knees" when Congress
voted sharp cutbacks in re
search, he noted. Faced with a $7

million reduction in federally
sponsored research, the Univer
sity now projects a deficit of
$700,000 for 1968-69 as compared
to a $2,000,000 surplus antici
pated earlier.
Discussing past and future
trends in University governance
at Stanford, Provost Richard W.
Lyman said the institution
"moved very far, very fast" un
der a regime that could be char
acterized as "anarchy tempered
by despotism" in the postwar
period.
"I don't think that a university
is apt to move that far and that
fast without leadership, which is
the positive word for despotism.
Had Stanford been ruled more
democratically around 1950, I'm
not sure the University would
have moved as rapidly."
