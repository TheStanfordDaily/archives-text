# Pacific Eight Athletic Programs Undergoing Year-Long Study
## 
### DAVE NOLAND 
Member schools of the Pacific-
Eight Athletic Conference, Stan
ford included, have decided to
initiate a year-long study of the
current state of health and the
future outlook of their athletic
programs. The examination will
focus mainly upon financial mat
ters and the maintaining of the
relevance of athletics to the Uni
versity community.
Stanford Athletic Director
Charles A. T a y 1 or cautioned,
"We are not making this study
because we think there's some
thing wrong." The examiners
hope rather to anticipate future
problems and work out ways to
solve them.
Presidents Lead Study
The study will be adminis
tered by the president of each
university, who will select a fi

nancal man and an academician
to form a 3-man team. Present
plans call for each team to ex
amine only its own school, but
Taylor did not rule out the pos
sibility of the examiners' check
ing out each other's athletic set
ups.
Because of the current state of
the presidency at Stanford, Pro
vost Richard Lyman will head
the Stanford study.
Stanford in Good Shape
Taylor said that the Stanford
program would stand ud well
under scrutiny. Financially, the
intercollegiate sports program is
completely self-sufficient and re
ceives no funds from the Univer
sity.
During the fiscal year ending
August 31 the Athletic Depart
ment's reserve amounted to $80,-
000. Income totalled more than
$2 million, mainly from gate re
cepits ($960,000, two-thirds of it
from football).
But Taylor pointed out that

the constantly increasing cost of
just about everything could pre
sent serious problems in the fu
ture. An example is the disap
pearance of piston-engine air
liners. Only much more expen
sive jets are now available for
charter by the football team.
Others Suffer Financial Pinch
Other conference schools may
have a tough financial battle
ahead. Because of different ac
counting and administrative set
ups, it is impossible to compare
exact figures, but the ever
present financial pinch of the
State schools could create seri
ous problems for Cal and UCLA.
USC is the only other private in
stitution besides Stanford in the
Pac-8.
Buck Club
A major reason for the rela
tive financial health of Stan
ford's program is the Buck Club,
an alumni fund-raising group
that Taylor calls "the best in the
country."

Buck Club contribiions com
pletely finance the gints-in-aid
given to student athites who
do not already have diversity
scholastic scholarships who
need financial help. Jim iunkett
and Gene Washington areunong
those receiving grants tin year.
Is It Relevant?
But what is the role cf the
Athletic Department at Stan
ford? Certainly not to turr. out
gym teachers, for there is no
phys. ed. major here. Athlees'
grades approximate those of the
rest of the student body, aid
70% go on to grad school.
Taylor pointed out that the
department is an integral ser
vice to the Stanford Community.
Facilities are available to all stu
dents and staff, and the Intra
mural Program counts 5,000 par
ticipants every year. Both the
intramural and physical educa
tion programs are partly fi
nanced by income from intercol
legiate sports.
