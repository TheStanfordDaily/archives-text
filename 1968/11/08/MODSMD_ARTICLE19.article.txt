# Dale Harris Tops Balloting In 'Red Hot Profâ€™ Contest
## 
### 
Dale Harris of the English De
partment is 1968's Red Hot Prof.
He proved to have more fans
who would plunk down a penny
or more for the International
Student Fund than any of the
hundred or more faculty mem
bers entered by students. Harris
wins the dubious honor of lead
ing a cheer at Saturday's game
with Washington.
Father John Duryea of the
University Christian Ministry

pressed Harris hard (though
non-violently) in the see-saw
contest. He gained 3300 votes to
Harris' 6331. A late surge of Har
ris votes gave the popular En
glish professor his wide margin.
John Kaplan of the School of
Law was third with 1817 ;
Marshall Clark, cross-cou t y
coach, was fourth with 1396.
In Miscellaneous action, such
perennial put-ins as the Bay
shore Freeway with 47, Demp

ster Dumpster with 32 and
someone known as the Theta
Chi Sadist with 328 gave depth
to the field of candidates.
In the minus column the late
addition of basketballer Mac Mc-
Elwain with 35 votes by his fra
ternity brothers proved to be
enough to overcome a drive by
John Ralston for last.
Of unusual interest was the
150 for the Russian computer
that last Spring defeated a Stan
ford computer in a chess match.
