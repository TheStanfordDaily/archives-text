# New Committees To Study Parking, Low Cost Housing
## 
### 
Robert H. Moulton Jr., associ
ate dean of research, today was
named chairman of a 14-man
ad hoc committee on low cost
housing by Acting President
Robert J. Glaser.
Assistant Prof. John I. Brau
man of the Department of
Chemistry was named chairman
of a 16-man ad hoc group to
study parking problems.
Both groups include students,
faculty, and staff.
In a letter to members of the
housing committee, Glaser said
"the lack of adequate low and
moderate-cost housing concerns
us all," including both members
of the University community
and those who work in the In
dustrial Park.
"By and large, Stanford fac
ulty, except for younger faculty
members, have been provided
for on the campus, and plans
are now moving ahead for
junior faculty housing," Glaser
said.
"On the other hand, it now
appears that students, particu
larly graduate students, and
Stanford staff members may

have significant unmet needs for
low-cost housing."
He suggested the group
should study the likely demand
for low or moderate income
housing, financing opportunities
under existing federal programs,
and the comparative advantages
of private versus University de
velopment for any housing that
might be proposed.

In his letter to members of
the parking committee, Glaser
said "our present approach to
enforcement is unsatisfactory."
Noting "serious inequities" in
enforcement, he said, "some
members of the faculty and staff
simply ignore notices of parking
violations.

"A significant number of in
dividuals have more than 20 un
heeded violations. Under the cir
cumstances, it is understandable
that the students cannot be ex
pected to observe the regula
tions. . . .
"If the final study cannot be
completed within a matter of

indeed to have some interim en
forcement regulation proposed
that can be instituted until your
final report has been adopted."

named chairman of a 14-man
ad hoc committee on low cost

Robert J. Glaser.
Assistant Prof. John I. Brau
man of the Department of
Chemistry was named chairman
of a 16-man ad hoc group to
study parking problems.
Both groups include students,
faculty, and staff.
In a letter to members of the
housing committee, Glaser said
"the lack of adequate low and
moderate-cost housing concerns
us all," including both members
of the University community
and those who work in the In
dustrial Park.
"By and large, Stanford fac
ulty, except for younger faculty
members, have been provided
for on the campus, and plans
are now moving ahead for
junior faculty housing," Glaser
said.
"On the other hand, it now
appears that students, particu
larly graduate students, and
Stanford staff members may

have significant unmet needs for
low-cost housing."
He suggested the group
should study the likely demand
for low or moderate income
housing, financing opportunities
under existing federal programs,
and the comparative advantages
of private versus University de
velopment for any housing that
might be proposed.

In his letter to members of
the parking committee, Glaser
said "our present approach to
enforcement is unsatisfactory."
Noting "serious inequities" in
enforcement, he said, "some
members of the faculty and staff
simply ignore notices of parking
violations.
