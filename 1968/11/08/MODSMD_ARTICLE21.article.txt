# Host Huskies Tomorrow
## Indians Strive To End Win Famine 
### GARY CAVALLI 
Still submerged in the depths
of a month-long victory drought,
Stanford hosts a rugged Wash
ington Husky eleven tomorrow
afternoon at 1:30 in the Tribe's
final home game of the 1968
campaign.
Both the Indians (3-3-1) and
the Huskies (2-3-2) have olaved

better than their records indi
cate. Stanford -leading the con
ference in points scored, total
offense, and passing offense —
has deserved a much better fate
than 27-24 loss to USC, a 21-all
tie with WSU, and a 20-17 loss
to UCLA.
Washington — second in the
Pac-8 in total defense, passing

defense, and rushing offense—
outplayed USC before being
stopped on the one-yard line in
the closing moments of the game
and losing 14-7, and battled Cal
to a 7-7 standstill last week in
Spokane.
The Huskies, who will be look
ing for their first conference win
tomorrow, haven't lost at Stan
ford Stadium since 1958. Before
Stanford edged them 14-7 in
Spokane last year, the Huskies
had won the previous eight
meetings between the two clubs.
Two outstanding senior de
fenders, A 1 Worley and George
Jugum, anchor a stingy Husky
defense which has hopes of con
taining the Tribe's vaunted aer
ial attack tomorrow.
Worley, known as "The Thief"
to the fans in Spokane, may well
be the top defensive back in the
country. He has already inter
cepted 13 passes this year, tying
the conference and NCAA rec
ords, and should have no trouble
breaking both marks in his re
maining three games.
Washington vs. Worley
Tomorrow Worley will have
his toughest assignment, cover
ing Tribe flanker Gene Washing
ton. Washington, who has
grabbed 50 passes for 748 yards
and six touchdowns, is current
ly ranked second in the nation
in pass receptions.
A 6-2 senior from Long Beach,
Washington needs only 12 recep
tions, 10 yards and two TD's to
establish new Stanford records
in four categories—career recep
tions, single season receptions,
single season yardage, and sin
gle season TD passes.
Husky linebacker George Jug
um, who Owens claims is the
"best linebacker on the Coast,"

made 25 tackles last week in the
Cal-Washington standoff. This
type of thing is becoming rou
tine for Jugum, who collected 28
tackles against Oregon three
weeks ago and has 121 for the
year.
Parish vs. Jugum
Stanford coach John Ralston
has a lot of respect for Jugum,
but believes he has a better line
backer in junior Don Parish.
"They claim to have one of the
best linebackers in the country
in Jugum," Ralston remarked,
"but if he's better than Parish
we've got to see it."
Parish, who had an outstand
ing day against Oregon State
Saturday with 23 tackles, has
been the mainstay on Stanford's
defense all year, with 108 tackles
to his credit.
Offensively, the Huskies con
centrate mainly on the ground
game, with tailback Harvey
Blanks, halfback Jim Cope, and
fullback Carl Wojciechowski
combining to give them an ex
cellent inside-outside attack.
"They have five good running
backs," Ralston commented,
with a tight slot, inside reverse
game. They have good blocking
and a lot of power."
Blanks, a 5-7 senior speedster
from Chicago, ranks sixth in the
conference in rushing with 422
yards in 74 carries. He also leads
the Huskies in pass receiving,
kickoff returns and punt re
turns.
Jerry Kaloper, a senior who
saw no action last year, has won
the starting quarterback spot
from junior Tom Manke. Kalo
per, the stronger passer of the
two, ranks seventh in the Pac-8
with 34 completions in 90 at
tempts for 462 yards.

Manke, an excellent runner
who scored the Huskies' lone TD
against Stanford last year on an
81-yard gallop, has thrown but
nine times this season, complet
ing two for 64 yards. Sophomore
Gene Willis has also seen action,
hitting four of ten passes for
39 yards.
While Owens has stuck with
Kaloper most of the time this
year, he may decide to go with
Manke tomorrow since Stanford
has had trouble containing roll
out quarterbacks this season.
Pass Blocking Vital
The Indians will have to im
prove their pass protection and
running attack, both of which
were lacking last week against
OSU, to beat Washington tomor
row.
"We need to get the pressure
off Plunkett," Ralston asserted.
"And establishing a running
game would be one way of doing
it." Plunkett, who leads the con
ference in passing and ranks
ninth in the country, was
dropped behind the line five
times last week by a strong
Beaver pass rush.
Both teams figure to be at full
strength tomorrow, although
Stanford tight end Bob Moore
may not start due to a pulled
hamstring muscle and a broken
nose.
"Moore's a little hobbled —
more so than in the last two
weeks," Ralston said, "so right
now he's a question mark." The
Tribe mentor indicated that
while Ron Kadziel might start in
his place, Moore would definite
ly see action.
In one lineup change, Ralston
announced that senior Andy
Carrigan had moved ahead of
Pat Preston and will start at
linebacker tomorrow.

Worley, known as "The Thief"
to the fans in Spokane, may well
be the top defensive back in the
country. He has already inter
cepted 13 passes this year, tying
the conference and NCAA rec
ords, and should have no trouble
breaking both marks in his re
maining three games.
Washington vs. Worley
Tomorrow Worley will have
his toughest assignment, cover
ing Tribe flanker Gene Washing
ton. Washington, who has
grabbed 50 passes for 748 yards
and six touchdowns, is current
ly ranked second in the nation
in pass receptions.
A 6-2 senior from Long Beach,
Washington needs only 12 recep
tions, 10 yards and two TD's to
establish new Stanford records
in four categories—career recep
tions, single season receptions,
single season yardage, and sin
gle season TD passes.
Husky linebacker George Jug
um, who Owens claims is the
"best linebacker on the Coast,"

made 25 tackles last week in the
Cal-Washington standoff. This
type of thing is becoming rou
tine for Jugum, who collected 28
tackles against Oregon three
weeks ago and has 121 for the
year.
Parish vs. Jugum
Stanford coach John Ralston
has a lot of respect for Jugum,
but believes he has a better line
backer in junior Don Parish.
"They claim to have one of the
best linebackers in the country
in Jugum," Ralston remarked,
"but if he's better than Parish
we've got to see it."
Parish, who had an outstand
ing day against Oregon State
Saturday with 23 tackles, has
been the mainstay on Stanford's
defense all year, with 108 tackles
to his credit.
Offensively, the Huskies con
centrate mainly on the ground
game, with tailback Harvey
Blanks, halfback Jim Cope, and
fullback Carl Wojciechowski
combining to give them an ex
cellent inside-outside attack.
"They have five good running
backs," Ralston commented,
with a tight slot, inside reverse
game. They have good blocking
and a lot of power."
Blanks, a 5-7 senior speedster
from Chicago, ranks sixth in the
conference in rushing with 422
yards in 74 carries. He also leads
the Huskies in pass receiving,
kickoff returns and punt re
turns.
Jerry Kaloper, a senior who
saw no action last year, has won
the starting quarterback spot
from junior Tom Manke. Kalo
per, the stronger passer of the
two, ranks seventh in the Pac-8
with 34 completions in 90 at
tempts for 462 yards.

Manke, an excellent runner
who scored the Huskies' lone TD
against Stanford last year on an
81-yard gallop, has thrown but
nine times this season, complet
ing two for 64 yards. Sophomore
Gene Willis has also seen action,
hitting four of ten passes for
39 yards.
While Owens has stuck with
Kaloper most of the time this
year, he may decide to go with
Manke tomorrow since Stanford
has had trouble containing roll
out quarterbacks this season.
Pass Blocking Vital
The Indians will have to im
prove their pass protection and
running attack, both of which
were lacking last week against
OSU, to beat Washington tomor
row.
"We need to get the pressure
off Plunkett," Ralston asserted.
"And establishing a running
game would be one way of doing
it." Plunkett, who leads the con
ference in passing and ranks
ninth in the country, was
dropped behind the line five
times last week by a strong
Beaver pass rush.
Both teams figure to be at full
strength tomorrow, although
Stanford tight end Bob Moore
may not start due to a pulled
hamstring muscle and a broken
nose.
"Moore's a little hobbled —
more so than in the last two
weeks," Ralston said, "so right
now he's a question mark." The
Tribe mentor indicated that
while Ron Kadziel might start in
his place, Moore would definite
ly see action.
In one lineup change, Ralston
announced that senior Andy
Carrigan had moved ahead of
Pat Preston and will start at
linebacker tomorrow.

"but if he's better than Parish
we've got to see it."
Parish, who had an outstand
ing day against Oregon State
Saturday with 23 tackles, has
been the mainstay on Stanford's
defense all year, with 108 tackles
to his credit.
Offensively, the Huskies con
centrate mainly on the ground
game, with tailback Harvey
Blanks, halfback Jim Cope, and
fullback Carl Wojciechowski
combining to give them an ex
cellent inside-outside attack.
"They have five good running
backs," Ralston commented,
with a tight slot, inside reverse
game. They have good blocking
and a lot of power."
Blanks, a 5-7 senior speedster
from Chicago, ranks sixth in the
conference in rushing with 422
yards in 74 carries. He also leads
the Huskies in pass receiving,
kickoff returns and punt re
turns.
Jerry Kaloper, a senior who
saw no action last year, has won
the starting quarterback spot
from junior Tom Manke. Kalo
per, the stronger passer of the
two, ranks seventh in the Pac-8
with 34 completions in 90 at
tempts for 462 yards.

Manke, an excellent runner
who scored the Huskies' lone TD
against Stanford last year on an
81-yard gallop, has thrown but
nine times this season, complet
ing two for 64 yards. Sophomore
Gene Willis has also seen action,
hitting four of ten passes for
39 yards.
While Owens has stuck with
Kaloper most of the time this
year, he may decide to go with
Manke tomorrow since Stanford
has had trouble containing roll
out quarterbacks this season.
Pass Blocking Vital
The Indians will have to im
prove their pass protection and
running attack, both of which
were lacking last week against
OSU, to beat Washington tomor
row.
"We need to get the pressure
off Plunkett," Ralston asserted.
"And establishing a running
game would be one way of doing
it." Plunkett, who leads the con
ference in passing and ranks
ninth in the country, was
dropped behind the line five
times last week by a strong
Beaver pass rush.
Both teams figure to be at full
strength tomorrow, although
Stanford tight end Bob Moore
may not start due to a pulled
hamstring muscle and a broken
nose.
"Moore's a little hobbled —
more so than in the last two
weeks," Ralston said, "so right
now he's a question mark." The
Tribe mentor indicated that
while Ron Kadziel might start in
his place, Moore would definite
ly see action.
In one lineup change, Ralston
announced that senior Andy
Carrigan had moved ahead of
Pat Preston and will start at
linebacker tomorrow.

ALL-AMERICAN CANDIDATE —The nation's second-ranked re
ceiver, Tribe flanker Gene Washington, grabs a Jim Plunkett aerial
and streaks down the sidelines against UCLA. Washington is now
within striking distance of four all-time Stanford pass-receiving
records.
Still submerged in the depths
of a month-long victory drought,
Stanford hosts a rugged Wash
ington Husky eleven tomorrow
afternoon at 1:30 in the Tribe's
final home game of the 1968
campaign.
Both the Indians (3-3-1) and
the Huskies (2-3-2) have olaved

better than their records indi
cate. Stanford -leading the con
ference in points scored, total
offense, and passing offense —
has deserved a much better fate
than 27-24 loss to USC, a 21-all
tie with WSU, and a 20-17 loss
to UCLA.
Washington — second in the
Pac-8 in total defense, passing

defense, and rushing offense—
outplayed USC before being
stopped on the one-yard line in
the closing moments of the game
and losing 14-7, and battled Cal
to a 7-7 standstill last week in
Spokane.
The Huskies, who will be look
ing for their first conference win
tomorrow, haven't lost at Stan
ford Stadium since 1958. Before
Stanford edged them 14-7 in
Spokane last year, the Huskies
had won the previous eight
meetings between the two clubs.
Two outstanding senior de
fenders, A 1 Worley and George
Jugum, anchor a stingy Husky
defense which has hopes of con
taining the Tribe's vaunted aer
ial attack tomorrow.
Worley, known as "The Thief"
to the fans in Spokane, may well
be the top defensive back in the
country. He has already inter
cepted 13 passes this year, tying
the conference and NCAA rec
ords, and should have no trouble
breaking both marks in his re
maining three games.
Washington vs. Worley
Tomorrow Worley will have
his toughest assignment, cover
ing Tribe flanker Gene Washing
ton. Washington, who has
grabbed 50 passes for 748 yards
and six touchdowns, is current
ly ranked second in the nation
in pass receptions.
A 6-2 senior from Long Beach,
Washington needs only 12 recep
tions, 10 yards and two TD's to
establish new Stanford records
in four categories—career recep
tions, single season receptions,
single season yardage, and sin
gle season TD passes.
Husky linebacker George Jug
um, who Owens claims is the
"best linebacker on the Coast,"

made 25 tackles last week in the
Cal-Washington standoff. This
type of thing is becoming rou
tine for Jugum, who collected 28
tackles against Oregon three
weeks ago and has 121 for the
year.
Parish vs. Jugum
Stanford coach John Ralston
has a lot of respect for Jugum,
but believes he has a better line
backer in junior Don Parish.
"They claim to have one of the
