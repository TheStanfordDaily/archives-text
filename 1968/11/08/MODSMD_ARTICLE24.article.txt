faith, intent on pursuing theo
logical questions of meaning,
purpose, decision-making and
life-style in the context of an
urban-technological age.
Many schools are re-formula
ting curriculum from traditional
content and methodology to a
course that has its basis built
cf involvement and participa
tion in community and societal
problems. The attempt is to in
tegrate thought and action with
the multitude of other problems.

ence or community organization.
