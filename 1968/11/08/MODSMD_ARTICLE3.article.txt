# Draft Refusal Goes To Court
## 
### 
A Palo Alto mother and for
mer Stanford employee asked a
federal court yesterday to stop
punishment of her 18 year old
son for refusing to register for
the draft.
Mrs. Evelyn Whitehorn, who
quit as a Library Assistant at
the University Library Circula
tion Division earlier this year,

asked for a court injunction to
ban prosecution of her son Erik,
18, for refusing to register.
Mrs. Whitehorn said she in
structed her son, Erik, to refuse
Selective Service registration.
As a minor, Erik is required un
der law to obey his parents, she
insisted.
Her complaint declared that
she acted on her conviction that
the Vietnam War is immoral.
She said that Erik acted out of
conscience based on her moral
teaching.
Constitutionality Challenged
Aubrey Grossman, their attor
ney, challenged the constitution
ality of the Selective Service
law. He argued that the moral
authority of a parent must be
held superior to the draft act.
Since resigning from the Uni
versity job, Mrs. Whitehorn has
become a real estate agent in
Palo Alto for the firm of Hare-
Brewer and Kelley.
According to the 47 year old
Mrs. Whitehorn, "I was ironing
one of my boys' shirts last
spring, while I listened to Dean
Rusk say we had to escalate the
war. It was then I realized the
legal responsibilities parents
have for their children."
Erik faces possible indictment
November 12 should U.S. Attor
ney Cecil Pool review the case.
If convicted he faces a possible
five years in jail or a fine of ten
thousand dollars.
Attorney Grossman said that
"any law which thwarts or re
stricts the family in its exercise
of the fundamental function of
moral education and training
cannot coexist with the Consti
tution."
He declared the draft act vio
lates the Constitution's First
Amendment if Erik can be sent
to prison for up to five years
because of his mother's moral
influence.
Moral Education Restricted
He said the law so applied
"suppresses, inhibits, and intimi
dates parents in the moral edu
cation of their children â€” the
most important form that free
dom of speech could possibly
take."
In addition to Erik Mrs.
Whitehorn has three other sons,
two of draft age.
Mrs. Whitehorn and Erik de
clared their refusal to register
before Selective Service Board
62 in San Jose on October 23.
On the same day, Erik's broth
er, Robert, 21, refused induction
in Oakland.
Another brother, John, 23, has
served three years in the Navy
as a volunteer.
Draft board 62, after a hearing
at which Erik and his mother
appeared, has ordered his case
turned over to the U.S. attorney
for prosecution if he fails to
register by November 12.
