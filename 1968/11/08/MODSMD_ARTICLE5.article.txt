Despite a series of incidents,

Vcre Pontony, said only two to

three per cent of the students
stayed away from classes.
A protest Wednesday by rov
ing bands of campus militants
shut down the 18,000-student col
lege.
The strike was called by the

a Black Panther, and upgrading
of the Black Studies Depart
ment.
White militants joined the

interrupting classes. Student pic
kets marched outside entrances
to campus and tried to win sup
port for their strike effort. Sev
eral students going to class scuf
fled with the protesters but no

injuries were reported.
A window in the Business and
Social Science Building was bro
ken and several fires were re
ported, one in a telephone booth
and another in a newspaper rack.

desk.
Meanwhile, in Los Angeles,
faculty members voiced support

charges against students who
seized the San Fernando Valley
State College administration
building, but agreed to bail out
those who surrendered to po
lice.
Twenty-two of 24 students
charged with felonies ranging
from kidnapping to assault
of nine charged with misdemean
ors also surrendered.
