# Undergrad Engineering
## Program Review Set 
### 
Faculty of the engineering
school have unanimously ap
proved plans for a new Under
graduate Council with broad
powers covering undergraduate
engineering education, Dean
Joseph Pettit disclosed yester
day.
The Council will include 24
professors, chosen from those
directly involved in undergrad
uate education. Six will be
elected by senior students in en
gineering, six by their faculty
colleagues, six by department
chairmen, and six by the dean.
The initial group will serve
staggered terms, with new mem
bers selected annually in the
spring quarter.
Students Selected
About 140 engineering seniors
are participating in the initial
vote this week, choosing from
approximately 80 professors.
The entire selection process is
expected to be complete next
week.
"The selection process should

insure that the Council includes
members with interest, compet
ence, and leadership in provid
ing excellent teaching and up-to
date programs" for undergradu
ates, according to the proposal
approved by the faculty.
Pettit said he felt the student
vote was "an innovative, mean
ingful way for students to con
tribute their knowledge to the
academic process."
All standing committees of
the school now concerned with
undergraduate matters will be
come committees of the Under
graduate Council and will have
student members. These include
committees on counseling and
advising, registration and grad
uation, schedule and curriculum,
and general education. Ad hoc
task forces also could be ap
pointed by the Council.
Changes Proposed
The new Council's initial con
cerns will include implementa
tion of recommendations from
the Student of Engineering Edu
cation at Stanford (SEES).
These included a substantial re
duction in total required course
units for engineering under
graduates, greater flexibility,
and more inter-disciplinary pro
grams. The Council also will
consider recommendations from
the Study of Education at Stan
ford which affect the School's
undergraduates.
The Council will have broad
responsibilities in the entire field
of undergraduate engineering
education at Stanford. Its de
cisions may be appealed to the
entire engineering faculty,
which previously had primary
responsibility for approving
changes in undergraduate re
quirements and curricula, so far
as these are set by the School
and its departments.
Both the Engineering Student-
Faculty Liaison Committee and
Tau Beta Pi, national scholastic
honorary society in engineering,
helped stimulate student in
volvement in SEES last year. In
all, 50 to 60 students helped de
velop its recommendations,
which are concerned mainly

with undergraduate education.
Many of the detailed proced
ures and working relationships
for the new Undergraduate
Council still have to be worked
out, according to Pettit.
In general, the Undergrad
uate Council's relationship to
the engineering faculty will be
comparable to that which now
exists between the Senate and
the Academic Council of the
University.
