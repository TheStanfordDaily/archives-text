(AP) â€” Voters in five states
were still waiting Thursday
night to find out who they chose
in Tuesday's election. Presiden
tial electoral votes were at stake
in four cases and a Senate race
in the fifth.
The electoral votes involved,
however, would not be enough
to change the outcome, even if
all the states went to Hubert H.
Humphrey.
Richard Nixon led Alaska,
Missouri, and Washington, but
trailed in Maryland, home state
of Vice President-elect Spiro Ag
new. Thirty-four electoral votes
are at stake in those states.
In Oregon the undecided con
test was between veteran Sen.
Wayne Morse, a Democrat, and
Republican challenger Robert
Packwood. The latest total was
Packwood, 399,250 and Morse,
395,424. There were still almost
5,000 absentee ballots to be tal
lied, however, and many of them
were from Morse's home coun
ty.
