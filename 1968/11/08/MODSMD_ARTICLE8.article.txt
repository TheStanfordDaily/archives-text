# Draft Counseling Co-op Formed
## 
### BOB WOLF 
A group of ten young people
recently formed a draft counsel
ing and information service in
downtown Palo Alto, the Draft
Co-op. The co-op is open (and
free) to all members of the com
munity. We have enough coun
selors, with varying areas of in
terest, to handle a wide range
of problems.
Unlike most independent draft
counseling organizations, the Co
op does not emphasize one par
ticular attitude toward the Se
lective Service System, such as
resistance or conscientious ob
jection. Essentially, we answer
questions and explain legal al

ternatives to the draft, including
deferments, conscientious objec
tion, etc. Our primary goal is to
help individuals plan their own
lives, we do not try to plan their
lives for them.
The Draft Co-op is located in
the basement of 359 Bryant
Street ("Lytton House"). In gen
eral, counselors are on hand
every weekday 4-10 p.m., Satur
day noon-6 p.m. and Sunday 5-8
p.m. To be on the safe side, how
ever, people are encouraged to
call the Co-op at 328-3966 before
coming in.
The Selective Service regula
tions and policies are so com
plex that any registrant, even a
student who expects to be de
ferred for several more years,
owes it to himself to be aware
of some of the finer points. As
an example, consider the ques
tion of the eligibility of gradu
ate students for I-S deferments.
This may well be the most con
fusing area in the entire laby
rinth of S. S. S. deferment pol
icy.

The common notion is that
grad students are ineligible for
I-S deferments. This is fairly
accurately based on the S. S. S.
regulations, which deny a I-S to
any grad student who has ever
had a 11-S. Obviously, the latter
qualification is almost inconse
quential. However, a clarification
to this regulation was issued by
General Hershey in Local Board
Memo No. 87: the exclusion from
a I-S applies only to a grad stu
dent who has held a 11-S since
July 1967.
This qualification also affects
very few people, but there is evi
dence that the memo was meant
to exclude only grad stutdents
who requested and received a
11-S since July 1967. (The memo
was written to summarize and
replace Operations Bulletin 311,
which did have this more liberal
provision). So any grad student
who did not request his 11-S last
year should be aware that he
may be entitled to a I-S.
These variations are interest
ing, but only a few people can

be affected by them. The really
significant discrepancy is be
tween any of the above provi
sions and that given in the Se
lective Service Law. Few people
bother to read the law because
it is assumed that the regula
tions interpret it correctly. But
checking the law can be valua
ble, since if a regulation is not
written in accordance with the
law, it has no legal validity.
The provision in the law con
cerning I-S deferments is par
ticularly ambiguous, but there
are many people (including the
authors of the Selective Service
Law Reporter, probably the
most comprehensive work on the
draft ever written) who think it
says that any student can get a
I-S except a grad student who
has requested and received an
undergraduate 11-S since July
1967.
This qualification is quite im
portant since it would mean that
any grad student now beyond
his first year could get a I-S.
Unfortunately, most local boards
probably will not accept this le
gal opinion, nor does General
Hershey seem likely to. And, al
though a resistrant would have
a chance to win a I-S through a
court case, he would be taking a
large risk in doing so.
Still, a second year grad stu
dent has much better legal
grounds for a I-S than for any
other deferment. Another group
of students who should consider
a I-S over a 11-S are those who
will finish school this year and
who did not request and receive
a 11-S last year. Such people will
permanently be barred from fa
therhood deferment if they re
quest and receive a 11-S this
year, but not if they use a I-S
instead.

large risk in doing so.
Still, a second year grad stu
dent has much better legal
grounds for a I-S than for any
other deferment. Another group
of students who should consider
a I-S over a 11-S are those who
will finish school this year and
who did not request and receive
a 11-S last year. Such people will
permanently be barred from fa
therhood deferment if they re
quest and receive a 11-S this
year, but not if they use a I-S
instead.
Confusing? See you at the
Draft Co-op.
A group of ten young people
recently formed a draft counsel
ing and information service in
downtown Palo Alto, the Draft
Co-op. The co-op is open (and
free) to all members of the com
munity. We have enough coun
selors, with varying areas of in
terest, to handle a wide range
of problems.
Unlike most independent draft
counseling organizations, the Co
op does not emphasize one par
ticular attitude toward the Se
lective Service System, such as
resistance or conscientious ob
jection. Essentially, we answer
questions and explain legal al

ternatives to the draft, including
deferments, conscientious objec
tion, etc. Our primary goal is to
help individuals plan their own
lives, we do not try to plan their
lives for them.
The Draft Co-op is located in
the basement of 359 Bryant
Street ("Lytton House"). In gen
eral, counselors are on hand
every weekday 4-10 p.m., Satur
day noon-6 p.m. and Sunday 5-8
p.m. To be on the safe side, how
ever, people are encouraged to
call the Co-op at 328-3966 before
coming in.
The Selective Service regula
tions and policies are so com
plex that any registrant, even a
student who expects to be de
ferred for several more years,
owes it to himself to be aware
of some of the finer points. As
an example, consider the ques
tion of the eligibility of gradu
ate students for I-S deferments.
This may well be the most con
fusing area in the entire laby
rinth of S. S. S. deferment pol
icy.

The common notion is that
grad students are ineligible for
I-S deferments. This is fairly
accurately based on the S. S. S.
regulations, which deny a I-S to
any grad student who has ever
had a 11-S. Obviously, the latter
qualification is almost inconse
quential. However, a clarification
to this regulation was issued by
General Hershey in Local Board
Memo No. 87: the exclusion from
a I-S applies only to a grad stu
dent who has held a 11-S since
July 1967.
This qualification also affects
very few people, but there is evi
dence that the memo was meant
to exclude only grad stutdents
who requested and received a
11-S since July 1967. (The memo
was written to summarize and
replace Operations Bulletin 311,
which did have this more liberal
provision). So any grad student
who did not request his 11-S last
year should be aware that he
may be entitled to a I-S.
These variations are interest
ing, but only a few people can

be affected by them. The really
significant discrepancy is be
tween any of the above provi
sions and that given in the Se
lective Service Law. Few people
bother to read the law because
it is assumed that the regula
tions interpret it correctly. But
checking the law can be valua
ble, since if a regulation is not
written in accordance with the
law, it has no legal validity.
The provision in the law con
cerning I-S deferments is par
ticularly ambiguous, but there
are many people (including the
authors of the Selective Service
Law Reporter, probably the
most comprehensive work on the
draft ever written) who think it
says that any student can get a
I-S except a grad student who
has requested and received an
undergraduate 11-S since July
1967.
This qualification is quite im
portant since it would mean that
any grad student now beyond
his first year could get a I-S.
Unfortunately, most local boards
probably will not accept this le
gal opinion, nor does General
Hershey seem likely to. And, al
though a resistrant would have
a chance to win a I-S through a
court case, he would be taking a
large risk in doing so.

most comprehensive work on the
draft ever written) who think it
says that any student can get a
I-S except a grad student who
has requested and received an
undergraduate 11-S since July
1967.
This qualification is quite im
portant since it would mean that
any grad student now beyond
his first year could get a I-S.
Unfortunately, most local boards
probably will not accept this le
gal opinion, nor does General
Hershey seem likely to. And, al
though a resistrant would have
a chance to win a I-S through a
court case, he would be taking a
large risk in doing so.
Still, a second year grad stu
dent has much better legal
grounds for a I-S than for any
other deferment. Another group
of students who should consider
a I-S over a 11-S are those who
will finish school this year and
who did not request and receive
a 11-S last year. Such people will
permanently be barred from fa
therhood deferment if they re
quest and receive a 11-S this
year, but not if they use a I-S
instead.
Confusing? See you at the
Draft Co-op.
A group of ten young people
recently formed a draft counsel
ing and information service in
downtown Palo Alto, the Draft
Co-op. The co-op is open (and
free) to all members of the com
munity. We have enough coun
selors, with varying areas of in
terest, to handle a wide range
of problems.
Unlike most independent draft
counseling organizations, the Co
op does not emphasize one par
ticular attitude toward the Se
lective Service System, such as
resistance or conscientious ob
jection. Essentially, we answer
questions and explain legal al

ternatives to the draft, including
deferments, conscientious objec
tion, etc. Our primary goal is to
help individuals plan their own
lives, we do not try to plan their
lives for them.
The Draft Co-op is located in
the basement of 359 Bryant
Street ("Lytton House"). In gen
eral, counselors are on hand
every weekday 4-10 p.m., Satur
day noon-6 p.m. and Sunday 5-8
p.m. To be on the safe side, how
ever, people are encouraged to
call the Co-op at 328-3966 before
coming in.
The Selective Service regula
tions and policies are so com
plex that any registrant, even a
student who expects to be de
ferred for several more years,
owes it to himself to be aware
of some of the finer points. As
an example, consider the ques
tion of the eligibility of gradu
ate students for I-S deferments.
This may well be the most con
fusing area in the entire laby
rinth of S. S. S. deferment pol
icy.

The common notion is that
grad students are ineligible for
I-S deferments. This is fairly
accurately based on the S. S. S.
regulations, which deny a I-S to
any grad student who has ever
had a 11-S. Obviously, the latter
qualification is almost inconse
quential. However, a clarification
to this regulation was issued by
General Hershey in Local Board
Memo No. 87: the exclusion from
a I-S applies only to a grad stu
dent who has held a 11-S since
July 1967.
This qualification also affects
very few people, but there is evi
dence that the memo was meant
to exclude only grad stutdents
who requested and received a
11-S since July 1967. (The memo
was written to summarize and
replace Operations Bulletin 311,
which did have this more liberal
provision). So any grad student
who did not request his 11-S last
year should be aware that he
may be entitled to a I-S.
These variations are interest
ing, but only a few people can

be affected by them. The really
significant discrepancy is be
tween any of the above provi
sions and that given in the Se
lective Service Law. Few people
bother to read the law because
it is assumed that the regula
tions interpret it correctly. But
checking the law can be valua
ble, since if a regulation is not
written in accordance with the
law, it has no legal validity.
The provision in the law con
cerning I-S deferments is par
ticularly ambiguous, but there
are many people (including the
authors of the Selective Service
Law Reporter, probably the
most comprehensive work on the
draft ever written) who think it
says that any student can get a
I-S except a grad student who
has requested and received an
undergraduate 11-S since July
1967.
This qualification is quite im
portant since it would mean that
any grad student now beyond
his first year could get a I-S.
