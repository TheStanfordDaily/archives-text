I May Be Best
I For You
y Biggest isn't always best.
k You don't need a 10-foot-long highway monster for
I city driving and parking.
And though our 17-watt super-sensitive stereo re-
I ceiver has been getting top ratings, you many not
I need it for metropolitan area apartment or small
I home.
€ Our LR-1000T "second best 1 receiver has also been
I getting rave reviews from hi-fi mags with quotes
I like these:
| "It ranks with the best we have tested .. . one of the most
I sensitive FM tuners we have used . . . clearly one of the best buys
lin audio . . . Although intended for the budgeted consumer, it
M offers most of the refinements (and performance) typical of receivers
■ selling for twice Its price."
This AM/FM stereo receiver may be just right for I
I your music system; merely add turntable and speakers B
lof your choice. Modestly priced at only $251.95—and I
I featured in complete systems from $313—it's top qual- I
I ity and top value.
I Before you buy stereo at any price, visit Lafayette! I
