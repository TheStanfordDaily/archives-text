# Board President Fuller
## 'More Communication Needed' 
### SUSAN SWARD 
Student interpersonal relations "have moved out
of the rumble seat and into the co-ed dorm," joked
W. Palmer Fuller 111 recently.
"The philosophy of 'it-wasn't-thatway-in-my-day'
doesn't work because the times have changed so tre
mendously," added the President of the Board of
Trustees.
Fuller must know what he is talking about, for 65
members of the Fuller family have attended Stan
ford. Fuller's great-grandfather was the founder of
W. P. Fuller and Co., the paint company. His father
is a past President of the Stanford Trustees also.
For the past two weeks Fuller has been in the
Stanford Hospital recovering from hip surgery. On
December 13, last year, Fuller was in a traffic acci
dent in Los Angeles. In the accident his hip was bro
ken, and this is the second time he has undergone
surgery for the injury. His hospitalization gave The
Daily an opportunity to interview him.
In his discussion of the role of the Board of Trus
tees, Fuller emphasized again and again that the
Board members are not motivated by their own selfish
interests.
Motivated By Aection
"The Board is motivated by affection and interest
in Stanford and not by anything else in God's green
earth," said Fuller. "The Board is a dedicated, hard
working group of individuals, and that's why it's so
aggravating when they're accused of motives of per
sonal gain."
"These people are doing what they're doing out
of an intense interest in the University. The charge of
personal gain is appalling. When I sit on the Board,
I should not be representing the glass business."
Fuller realizes that "the pressure is on" to bring
students and faculty closer to the Board. "This move
should be made within the context of the university
which is administered by its administration and not
by its Board of Trustees. The Board is quite definitely
interested in expanding communication between the
Board and other elements within the university."

Speaking about possible changes in the Board's
structure, Fuller said, "Perhaps twenty years' service
on the Board is too long. We should definitely have
some younger members. Right now there is only
one member under 50, but not so long ago there were
very few members under 70."
Distinguished Faculty
"We should have some distinguished faculty mem
bers on the Board. It would probably be better to
have the faculty members be from institutions other
than Stanford."
"The spectrum from which the Board is drawn
should be wider," Fuller admitted, "but the spectrum
isn't as narrow as some people think it is. Certainly
I've heard it said that members of the Board ap
proach problems in the same way. This is not true.
There are wide areas of disagreement on the Board."
Specifying his tasks as President of the Board,
Fuller noted, "It is the President who must keep in
constant touch with the administration. He is the
fellow who is looked to in times of crisis for advice.
He presides over meetings and receives the majority
of alumni mail."
According to Fuller, being President of the Board
is by no means merely an honorary title. It is an
honor that entails many duties.
"The President's position on the Board carries
a little more weight than the average member's. The
position of the President of the University has a
great deal of weight, of course, and there are always
several Board members that are highly influential."
Faculty Is The University
Touching on the faculty's role in the university
system, Fuller said, "No matter how you characterize
the faculty, no university administration can be suc
cessful without faculty support. This involves com
munication between faculty and administration. If
I were going to be extreme about it, the faculty is
the university. That's what the students come here
for."
Fuller is basically very enthusiastic about the stu
dent body at Stanford.

"I am not saying that students are always right or
that the university should always do what they
want. All I can say about students today is that th n y
are bright, well-informed and conscious of the diffi
cult social problems that exist. That may sound plati
tudinous, but it's the way I feel."
"Comparisons between students today and stu
dents 40 years ago aren't possible because the world
is so different," Fuller concluded.
Fuller graduated from Stanford iri 1934 and from
Harvard Law School in 1937. He was Vice President
and Director of W. P. Fuller and Co. in 19G2 when he
resigned to join Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company
(presently PPG Industries). In August of 1967 he
was appointed Vice President — Western Region.
Outside activities of Fuller include: Board of Di
rectors, Western Pacific Railroad; Board of Direc
tors, Wells Fargo Bank; Board of Directors, Yosemite
Park and Curry Co.; Board of Directors, Pacific Mu
tual Life Insurance. He is also an ex-ofTicio member
of the Board of Directors of Stanford Research In
stitute.
Except to groups like the Students for a Democartic
Society, who have done research on the Trustees,
W. Parmer Fuller 111 is largely an unknown quantity.
When asked the name of the President of the
Stanford Trustees, several students looked abashed
and answered, "I really don't know." Some students
named Robert Guggenhime, who was President of
the Board two years ago.
While the President of the Board continually
stresses the importance of communication, he re
mains unknown or, worse still, unnamed by many
Stanford students. Partly this anonymity results from
Stanford students' traditional apathy. Partly it re
sults from the phenomenom one student described
as "the over-use of the word 'communication' — heavy
on the emphasis and light on the application."
The problem runs deeper than this, however. As a
senior in Roble noted, "Communication can rarely be
a golden key if personal value systems are radically
in opposition."
