Wo are living in the midst of
one of history's greatest gran
falloons. For clarification, let's
turn to Kurt Vonnegut, erst
while student of Bokonon, and
author of Cat's Cradle.
"Hazel's obsession with Hoos
iers around the world was a
textbook example of a false HA
RASS, of a seeming team that
was meaningless in terms of the
way Cod get« things done, a
textbook example of what Boko
non calls a GRANFALLOON.
Other examples of granfalloons
are the Communist Party, the
Daughters of the American Rev
olution, the General Electric
Company, the International Or
der of Odd Fellows —and any na
tion, anytime, anywhere.
"As Bokonon invites us to sing
along with him:
If you wish to study a gran
falloon
Just remove the skin of a toy
balloon."
Today seems like an appropri
ate time to discuss the inordi
nate number of minor granfal
loons which go to make up the
greater vapid entity—the U.S.A.
which isn't to say that other na
tions are not meaningless in
their own way—it's just that I
know this one best, and we have
such a way of exposing our
selves in magnificent, world-wide
absurdity.
The presidential elections
aside—as well they should be—
I would like to discuss ever so
briefly the ever comic, inordi
nately tragic war in Vietnam.
For many years, we have la
bored to create a false karass,
"a viable, free, enterprising an
ti-communist State", in South

east Asia. True, there wasn't
much to work with, but wo have
always been buoyed up by the
faith of Christians. In the face
of insurmountable odds, we in
vested billions of dollars, thou
sands of young men, an adminis
tration and tons of propaganda.
But to no avail.
Finally, last Spring the then
president began to admit the
obvious—a bit at a time. In our
own mock-heroic way, we of
fered to go anywhere, anytime
to talk about peace. Or almost
anywhere, it turned out. After
a few weeks of game-playing
led by the witty North Vietna
mese (who offered, in the proc
ess, to stop bombing New York
if we laid off Hanoi) we met in
Paris. And the war went on.
Corpses piled up; Korea, Pt. 11.
In the meantime, it seemed
that the election might be lost
to the granfalloon party in
power. So the draft calls fell
off. The trials stopped. The
peace feelers went out, looking
for a bombing halt. The cities

prepared over-kill to keep the
niggers quiet. Troops tried to
hold a quiet convention. The
country was responding earnest
ly to the central problem of
modern man: how to keep
power.
With only a few days to go,
the Old Master put out a last
minute contortion: a bombing
halt and a four-sided barbecue
in Paris. It was almost too much
to believe, until it outdid itself.
We had come full-circle, and
finally created a "viable, free
enterprising, a nt i - communist
state", which—unlike its cow
ardly, hypocritical benefactor
refused to sit down and talk
with those Communists it op
posed. Better late than never,
we always say. A fine example
of nation-building; perhaps the
theory isn't so bankrupt as we
thought.
So, here we sit, with a winner
on our hands, which isn't really
a winner at all, at a time when
we most need a loser to save

face, which has been lost time
and time again. And throughout
the many riotous convolutions
of our fate, we condemn to death
thirty Americans and two-hun
dred Vietnamese daily.
Perhaps it is time to pop the
balloon, to lower the flag, to get
serious, for Christ's sake. It
seems like the facts are there,
for those who eare to look.
On election night many hun
dred of us marched in an elec
toral wake, shortly before the
choosing of our next corpse was
official. He confirmed his lively
vision in an acceptance speech
which no one will remember—
except maybe the Humphrey
kids who he encouraged to stay
right in there plugging until '72
or later.
Later in the week, the new,
higher draft calls were an
nounced, indictments for induc
tion refusals began again, and
the state of the bombing halt
seemed delicate. At least one
contest was over.

Wo are living in the midst of
one of history's greatest gran
falloons. For clarification, let's
turn to Kurt Vonnegut, erst
while student of Bokonon, and
author of Cat's Cradle.
"Hazel's obsession with Hoos
iers around the world was a
textbook example of a false HA
RASS, of a seeming team that
was meaningless in terms of the
way Cod get« things done, a
textbook example of what Boko
non calls a GRANFALLOON.
Other examples of granfalloons
are the Communist Party, the
Daughters of the American Rev
olution, the General Electric
Company, the International Or
der of Odd Fellows —and any na
tion, anytime, anywhere.
"As Bokonon invites us to sing
along with him:
If you wish to study a gran
falloon
Just remove the skin of a toy
balloon."
Today seems like an appropri
ate time to discuss the inordi
nate number of minor granfal
loons which go to make up the
greater vapid entity—the U.S.A.
which isn't to say that other na
tions are not meaningless in
their own way—it's just that I
know this one best, and we have
such a way of exposing our
selves in magnificent, world-wide
absurdity.
The presidential elections
aside—as well they should be—
I would like to discuss ever so
briefly the ever comic, inordi
nately tragic war in Vietnam.
For many years, we have la
bored to create a false karass,
"a viable, free, enterprising an
ti-communist State", in South

east Asia. True, there wasn't
much to work with, but wo have
always been buoyed up by the
faith of Christians. In the face
of insurmountable odds, we in
vested billions of dollars, thou
sands of young men, an adminis
tration and tons of propaganda.
But to no avail.
Finally, last Spring the then
president began to admit the
obvious—a bit at a time. In our
own mock-heroic way, we of
fered to go anywhere, anytime
to talk about peace. Or almost
anywhere, it turned out. After
a few weeks of game-playing
led by the witty North Vietna
mese (who offered, in the proc
ess, to stop bombing New York
if we laid off Hanoi) we met in
Paris. And the war went on.
Corpses piled up; Korea, Pt. 11.
In the meantime, it seemed
that the election might be lost
to the granfalloon party in
power. So the draft calls fell
off. The trials stopped. The
peace feelers went out, looking
for a bombing halt. The cities

prepared over-kill to keep the
niggers quiet. Troops tried to
hold a quiet convention. The
country was responding earnest
ly to the central problem of
modern man: how to keep
power.
With only a few days to go,
the Old Master put out a last
minute contortion: a bombing
halt and a four-sided barbecue
in Paris. It was almost too much
to believe, until it outdid itself.
We had come full-circle, and
finally created a "viable, free
enterprising, a nt i - communist
state", which—unlike its cow
ardly, hypocritical benefactor
refused to sit down and talk
with those Communists it op
posed. Better late than never,
we always say. A fine example
of nation-building; perhaps the
theory isn't so bankrupt as we
thought.
So, here we sit, with a winner
on our hands, which isn't really
a winner at all, at a time when
we most need a loser to save

face, which has been lost time
and time again. And throughout
the many riotous convolutions
of our fate, we condemn to death

By PAUL RUPERT
Wo are living in the midst of
one of history's greatest gran
falloons. For clarification, let's
turn to Kurt Vonnegut, erst
while student of Bokonon, and
author of Cat's Cradle.
"Hazel's obsession with Hoos
iers around the world was a
textbook example of a false HA
RASS, of a seeming team that
was meaningless in terms of the
way Cod get« things done, a
textbook example of what Boko
non calls a GRANFALLOON.
Other examples of granfalloons
are the Communist Party, the
Daughters of the American Rev
olution, the General Electric
Company, the International Or
der of Odd Fellows —and any na
tion, anytime, anywhere.
"As Bokonon invites us to sing
along with him:
If you wish to study a gran
falloon
Just remove the skin of a toy
balloon."
Today seems like an appropri
ate time to discuss the inordi
nate number of minor granfal
loons which go to make up the
greater vapid entity—the U.S.A.
which isn't to say that other na
tions are not meaningless in
their own way—it's just that I
know this one best, and we have
such a way of exposing our
selves in magnificent, world-wide
absurdity.
The presidential elections
aside—as well they should be—
I would like to discuss ever so
briefly the ever comic, inordi
nately tragic war in Vietnam.
For many years, we have la
bored to create a false karass,
"a viable, free, enterprising an
ti-communist State", in South

east Asia. True, there wasn't
much to work with, but wo have
always been buoyed up by the
faith of Christians. In the face
of insurmountable odds, we in
vested billions of dollars, thou
sands of young men, an adminis
tration and tons of propaganda.
But to no avail.
Finally, last Spring the then
president began to admit the
obvious—a bit at a time. In our
own mock-heroic way, we of
fered to go anywhere, anytime
to talk about peace. Or almost
anywhere, it turned out. After
a few weeks of game-playing
led by the witty North Vietna
mese (who offered, in the proc
ess, to stop bombing New York
if we laid off Hanoi) we met in
Paris. And the war went on.
Corpses piled up; Korea, Pt. 11.
In the meantime, it seemed
that the election might be lost
to the granfalloon party in
power. So the draft calls fell
off. The trials stopped. The
peace feelers went out, looking
for a bombing halt. The cities

prepared over-kill to keep the
niggers quiet. Troops tried to
hold a quiet convention. The
country was responding earnest
ly to the central problem of
modern man: how to keep
power.
With only a few days to go,
the Old Master put out a last
minute contortion: a bombing
halt and a four-sided barbecue
in Paris. It was almost too much
to believe, until it outdid itself.
