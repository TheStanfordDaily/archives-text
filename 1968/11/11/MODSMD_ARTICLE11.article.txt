## Political Police Power 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
According to the Palo Alto
Times, Saturday November 9, a
warrant has been issued for the
arrest of Marc Sapir, 4th year
Stanford medical student, on
charges of "failure to disperse"
during the Election Wake at
Lytton Plaza November 5.
Six people were arrested dur
ing the Wake and demonstra
tion.
On Friday November 8, Pro
fessor Bruce Franklin was ap
prehended by the police also on
the charge of failing to disperse.
He is now out of jail after post
ing $350 bail.
Marc has not yet been arrest
ed.
There seems to be no doubt

that the issuing of these war
rants represents a clear case of
the use of police authority for
purposes of political intimida
tion: were this not so, would
Marc and Bruce not have been
arrested at the time they were
"failing to disperse" instead of
3 days later?
It is the responsibility of those
who used this demonstration to
express their own political opin
ions to protect those who are
now being asked to pay for
theirs with prison.
This is not the first time that
police power has been used to
intimidate outspoken political
activists in the Palo Alto com
munity. Recently, Bob Cullen
bine and Barry Greenberg were

singled out of a much larger
group at Lytton Plaza for arrest
on misdemeanor charges.
As a result of last Tuesday's
demonstration, Chris Menchine
has been singled out for arrest
on a felony charge — "inciting
to riot."
It seems clear that political
arrest has become a policy of
the Palo Alto police department,
designed to stifle dissent. The
time has come for members of
the Stanford and Palo Alto com
munities who value free expres
sion of political belief to unify
in opposition to this form of po
litical repression.
Can those who value freedom
of thought accept police intimi
dation of others without feeling
that their own freedom may
someday be curtailed?
An open meeting will be held
Monday, November 11, at 8 p.m.
in Branner lounge, to discuss
these issues and formulate ac
tion to support those who have
been charged.

Editor, THE DAILY:
According to the Palo Alto
Times, Saturday November 9, a
warrant has been issued for the
arrest of Marc Sapir, 4th year
Stanford medical student, on
charges of "failure to disperse"
during the Election Wake at
Lytton Plaza November 5.
Six people were arrested dur
ing the Wake and demonstra
tion.
On Friday November 8, Pro
fessor Bruce Franklin was ap
prehended by the police also on
the charge of failing to disperse.
He is now out of jail after post
ing $350 bail.
Marc has not yet been arrest
ed.
There seems to be no doubt

that the issuing of these war
rants represents a clear case of
the use of police authority for
purposes of political intimida
tion: were this not so, would
Marc and Bruce not have been
arrested at the time they were
"failing to disperse" instead of
3 days later?
It is the responsibility of those
who used this demonstration to
express their own political opin
ions to protect those who are
now being asked to pay for
theirs with prison.
This is not the first time that
police power has been used to
intimidate outspoken political
activists in the Palo Alto com
munity. Recently, Bob Cullen
bine and Barry Greenberg were

singled out of a much larger
group at Lytton Plaza for arrest
on misdemeanor charges.
As a result of last Tuesday's
demonstration, Chris Menchine
has been singled out for arrest
on a felony charge — "inciting
to riot."
It seems clear that political
arrest has become a policy of
the Palo Alto police department,
designed to stifle dissent. The
time has come for members of
the Stanford and Palo Alto com
munities who value free expres
sion of political belief to unify
in opposition to this form of po
litical repression.
Can those who value freedom
of thought accept police intimi
dation of others without feeling
that their own freedom may
someday be curtailed?
An open meeting will be held
Monday, November 11, at 8 p.m.
in Branner lounge, to discuss
these issues and formulate ac
tion to support those who have
been charged.
