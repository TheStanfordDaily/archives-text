# POLITICAL ARRESTS
## 
### 
The Palo Alto Police Department, until recently considered an
exemplary peace force, has moved into the mainstream of Ameri
can political repression.
Their indiscriminate use of "failure to disperse" ordinances
both during and after civic activities in Palo Alto is offensive
to every American principle of justice.
Last Tuesday night as the crowd was beginning to dwindle
at the Lytton Plaza dance, Police Chief Hydie decided that the
situation at the corner of University and Emerson was potentially
dangerous.
After massing his troops in the area, he informed the crowd
of his decision, ordered them to disperse immediately, and set
his men to work erratically and often frenetically clearing down
town Palo Alto.
The need for the tactics or the dispersal order itself was ques
tionable. Moreover, the precepts of freedom of speech and as
sembly challenge the constitutionality of any dispersal laws.
But last Friday, the long political arm of Chief Hydie reached
out and arrested English Prof. Bruce Franklin for failing to dis
perse on Tuesday.
A dispersal order is intended to clear up a dangerous situation
at that time. According to the logic of the law if someone refuses
to comply, then he should be arrested immediately to make the
situation less dangerous.
Arresting someone several days later has nothing to do with
preserving order. In fact, it is a myopic desire on the part of Chief
Hydie and his men to suppress political dissent by harassing the
so-called "trouble-makers" or "leaders."
We hope the police will drop their charges against the people
arrested for failure to disperse or that the courts will vindicate
them.
Further, we warn Chief Hydie that to continue dealing in
political suppression will only mean a further undermining of the
respect for the Palo Alto police and bringing on more violent
upheavals for Palo Alto.
