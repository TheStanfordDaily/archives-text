# ANOTHER ELECTION
## 
### 
Last week's short-lived campus election, suspended because
of voting irregularities, will be held today and tomorrow. On the
ballot are several propositions of major import for the future
of coherent student power at Stanford.
The first proposition concerns amendments to the ASSU con
stitution, specifically calling for replacement of the cumbersome,
impotent LASSU by a student senate with 20 members. For too
many years, student government here has been incapacitated by
the heavy-handed machinations of LASSU. There is great need
for a student senate in which decisions can be intelligently and
effectively made. Proposition 1 deserves everyone's vote.
Propositions 2a and 2b are entirely different matters. Propo
sition 2a suggests the administration "not accede to any demands
or yield to any coercive tactics" made by students without con
sidering "the majority opinion of the students of Stanford Uni
versity."
Obviously the administration should not disregard the opinions
of many students in times of crisis, but passage of proposition 2a
would provide the administration with an easy excuse for delay
ing action on issues until campus referendums have been held.
Waiting for such a vote can take many days, and there is no
guarantee majority opinion would necessarily reflect a true under
standing of issues.
Furthermore, the wording of proposition 2a is ambiguous and
seeks to attract anti-protest votes without clearly defining the
implications of such votes. It should be defeated.
Proposition 2b advocates establishment of a joint student
faculty-administration committee to advise the University in
crisis periods and serve as an arbitrative body. Such a body is
unnecessary. The Committee of Fifteen and the Student Conduct
Legislative Council serve these roles.
The final proposition condemns the U.S. Olympic Committee
for its suspension of two black sprinters, Tommie Smith and Juan
Carlos. We support this proposition.
As for head yell leader—let's worry about a new coach first.
