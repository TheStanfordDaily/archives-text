# PHILOPHOBIA: the establishment is where you find it
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
In this day of the anti-Estab
lishment polemic, rebellious
young authors should be warned
that the object of their disdain
is planning a counterattack.
Even today, as New Leftists
sleep, the giant is beginning to
stir, and at Stanford, rumblings
can be recorded at the nearby
Stanford Industrial Park.
An example from a magazine
published for the employees of
Hewlett-Packard: (radicals with
weak hearts should proceed with
extreme care)
"WHO'S MINDING THE
STORE?" (title)
"Notwithstanding the pot
smoking, bead-swinging, free
loving, law-taunting, card-burn
ing elements of the population,
the Establishment is probably
the only thing on God's slightly
scorched earth that can provide
any meaningful amonnt of sta
bility.
"And YOU are the Establish
ment.
"No matter what your age,
sex, race, location, job, educa
tion, or maritial status—you are
it.
"Your sens* 1 ! of responsibility
for your fellownien, and for
yourself, is the glue that holds
the whole thing together. With
out this sense of r<*sponsibility
there is only disregard, discon
tentment, and dissolution. With
it there is service, satisfaction,
and strength.
"From any angle the key ele
ment is service. That's what
nuikes the Establishment go. A
desire to serve. On and off the
job.
"You affirm your support of
this position through your re
gard for your family, your
neighbors, and your community.
You reaffirm it every workday
in doing the job to the best of
your ability.
"The f>ages that follow show
examples of how you and more
than 12,000 othef Hewlett-Pack
ard people are contributing
through service to others each
day?
"Who's minding the store?
"You jye."
As with any true Classic, there
is nothing to add.

I stumbled across the above
my first day on the job at Hew
lett-Packard (H-P) last sum
mer. Already somewhat nervous
at the prospect of joining a big
business for three months, I sud
denly longed for an offered-but
turned-down job at a day camp
in Connecticut.
The first question: "Was the
H-P article for real?"
"Yes."
The second question: "Did em
ployees believe it?"
"Yes."
The third question: "Where is
the nearest exit?"
"There are none. YOU are
part of the Eestablishment."
Three months later I found
my way out of Hewlett-Packard,
back to the refuge of Stanford.
During the three months, how
ever, it had become quite clear
the voice was right. There are
no exits.
Not just at H-P. Stanford is
"minding the store" equally well.
Students for a Democratic So
ciety (SDS) keep talking about
the Stanford store, but they
seem to be shopping at only one
branch.
The Stanford Research Insti
tute (SRI), the Applied Elec
tronics Lab (AEL) and other
ventures described as "imperial
ist" by SDS are the window dis
plays at the science branch.
There are also student and fac
ulty divisions, and, of course,
the alumni branch.
At all locations, Stanford sells
nothing but the best. The Estab
lishment comes here to shop
every year and can choose
among the "in" products at the
business branch, the law coun
ter, or the mcdical department.
Quality is guaranteed, with a
two year, money-back warranty.
It is easy to forget. Everyone
at Stanford is intelligent. The
campus is a secluded, beautiful
retreat. The population is pre
dominently young, white, and
clean-cut. It is the kind of Es
tablishment that deceives its
members. It's not the money
grubbing, retired businessman
type.'Stanford looks, smells and
feels great.
Rut even SDS, with all its an
ti-Establishment rhetoric, is it

self a central display for the stu
dent branch. SDS is the latest
style advertised at the Stanford
store—it's the anti-Establish
ment Establishment.
Work shirts, beards, sideburns,
sandals, and bluejeans only give
the Establishment a different
face. Someone should count the
number of high price stereos
owned by members of SDS.
It takes a ride on the New
York subway to shake one out
of the Stanford environment.
The real world rides the IRT,
IND, and BMT. It's a world that

includes crushed crowds and
empty trains, people who can
barely walk and children who
can't sit still, the stink of urine
and the fragrance of Chanel,
garbage, rats, roaches, robbery,
and humor.
People at Stanford are differ
ent, but they differ in the same
mold. Stanford is the WASP Es
tablishment.
Before I laughed at Hewlett-
Packard prose, I should have
looked across the fields at Stan
ford. I might not have laughed
so hard.

I stumbled across the above
my first day on the job at Hew
lett-Packard (H-P) last sum
mer. Already somewhat nervous
at the prospect of joining a big
business for three months, I sud
denly longed for an offered-but
turned-down job at a day camp
in Connecticut.
The first question: "Was the
H-P article for real?"
"Yes."
The second question: "Did em
ployees believe it?"
"Yes."
The third question: "Where is
the nearest exit?"
"There are none. YOU are
part of the Eestablishment."
Three months later I found
my way out of Hewlett-Packard,
back to the refuge of Stanford.
During the three months, how
ever, it had become quite clear
the voice was right. There are
no exits.
Not just at H-P. Stanford is
"minding the store" equally well.
Students for a Democratic So
ciety (SDS) keep talking about
the Stanford store, but they
seem to be shopping at only one
branch.
The Stanford Research Insti
tute (SRI), the Applied Elec
tronics Lab (AEL) and other
ventures described as "imperial
ist" by SDS are the window dis
plays at the science branch.
There are also student and fac
ulty divisions, and, of course,
the alumni branch.
At all locations, Stanford sells
nothing but the best. The Estab
lishment comes here to shop
every year and can choose
among the "in" products at the
business branch, the law coun
ter, or the mcdical department.
Quality is guaranteed, with a
two year, money-back warranty.
It is easy to forget. Everyone
at Stanford is intelligent. The
campus is a secluded, beautiful
retreat. The population is pre
dominently young, white, and
clean-cut. It is the kind of Es
tablishment that deceives its
members. It's not the money
grubbing, retired businessman
type.'Stanford looks, smells and
feels great.
Rut even SDS, with all its an
ti-Establishment rhetoric, is it

self a central display for the stu
dent branch. SDS is the latest
style advertised at the Stanford
store—it's the anti-Establish
ment Establishment.
Work shirts, beards, sideburns,
sandals, and bluejeans only give
the Establishment a different
face. Someone should count the
number of high price stereos
owned by members of SDS.
It takes a ride on the New
York subway to shake one out
of the Stanford environment.
The real world rides the IRT,
IND, and BMT. It's a world that

includes crushed crowds and
empty trains, people who can
barely walk and children who
can't sit still, the stink of urine
and the fragrance of Chanel,
garbage, rats, roaches, robbery,
and humor.
People at Stanford are differ
ent, but they differ in the same
mold. Stanford is the WASP Es
tablishment.
Before I laughed at Hewlett-
Packard prose, I should have
looked across the fields at Stan
ford. I might not have laughed
so hard.
In this day of the anti-Estab
lishment polemic, rebellious
young authors should be warned
that the object of their disdain
is planning a counterattack.
Even today, as New Leftists
sleep, the giant is beginning to
stir, and at Stanford, rumblings
can be recorded at the nearby
Stanford Industrial Park.

through service to others each
day?
"Who's minding the store?
"You jye."
As with any true Classic, there
is nothing to add.

I stumbled across the above
my first day on the job at Hew
lett-Packard (H-P) last sum
mer. Already somewhat nervous
at the prospect of joining a big
business for three months, I sud
denly longed for an offered-but
turned-down job at a day camp
in Connecticut.
The first question: "Was the
H-P article for real?"
"Yes."
The second question: "Did em
ployees believe it?"
"Yes."
The third question: "Where is
the nearest exit?"
"There are none. YOU are
part of the Eestablishment."
Three months later I found
my way out of Hewlett-Packard,
back to the refuge of Stanford.
During the three months, how
ever, it had become quite clear
the voice was right. There are
no exits.
Not just at H-P. Stanford is
"minding the store" equally well.
Students for a Democratic So
ciety (SDS) keep talking about
the Stanford store, but they
seem to be shopping at only one
branch.
The Stanford Research Insti
tute (SRI), the Applied Elec
tronics Lab (AEL) and other
ventures described as "imperial
ist" by SDS are the window dis
plays at the science branch.
There are also student and fac
ulty divisions, and, of course,
the alumni branch.
At all locations, Stanford sells
nothing but the best. The Estab
lishment comes here to shop
every year and can choose
among the "in" products at the
business branch, the law coun
ter, or the mcdical department.
Quality is guaranteed, with a
two year, money-back warranty.
It is easy to forget. Everyone
at Stanford is intelligent. The
campus is a secluded, beautiful
retreat. The population is pre
dominently young, white, and
clean-cut. It is the kind of Es
tablishment that deceives its
members. It's not the money
grubbing, retired businessman
type.'Stanford looks, smells and
feels great.
Rut even SDS, with all its an
ti-Establishment rhetoric, is it

self a central display for the stu
dent branch. SDS is the latest
style advertised at the Stanford
store—it's the anti-Establish
ment Establishment.
Work shirts, beards, sideburns,
sandals, and bluejeans only give
the Establishment a different
face. Someone should count the
number of high price stereos
owned by members of SDS.
It takes a ride on the New
York subway to shake one out
of the Stanford environment.
The real world rides the IRT,
IND, and BMT. It's a world that

includes crushed crowds and
empty trains, people who can
barely walk and children who
can't sit still, the stink of urine
and the fragrance of Chanel,
garbage, rats, roaches, robbery,
and humor.
People at Stanford are differ
ent, but they differ in the same
mold. Stanford is the WASP Es
tablishment.
Before I laughed at Hewlett-
Packard prose, I should have
looked across the fields at Stan
ford. I might not have laughed
so hard.
In this day of the anti-Estab
lishment polemic, rebellious
young authors should be warned
that the object of their disdain
is planning a counterattack.
Even today, as New Leftists
sleep, the giant is beginning to
stir, and at Stanford, rumblings
can be recorded at the nearby
Stanford Industrial Park.
An example from a magazine
published for the employees of
Hewlett-Packard: (radicals with
weak hearts should proceed with
extreme care)
"WHO'S MINDING THE
STORE?" (title)
"Notwithstanding the pot
smoking, bead-swinging, free
loving, law-taunting, card-burn
ing elements of the population,
the Establishment is probably
the only thing on God's slightly
scorched earth that can provide
any meaningful amonnt of sta
bility.
"And YOU are the Establish
ment.
"No matter what your age,
sex, race, location, job, educa
tion, or maritial status—you are
it.
"Your sens* 1 ! of responsibility
for your fellownien, and for
yourself, is the glue that holds
the whole thing together. With
out this sense of r<*sponsibility
there is only disregard, discon
tentment, and dissolution. With
it there is service, satisfaction,
and strength.
"From any angle the key ele
ment is service. That's what
nuikes the Establishment go. A
desire to serve. On and off the
job.
"You affirm your support of
this position through your re
gard for your family, your
neighbors, and your community.
You reaffirm it every workday
in doing the job to the best of
your ability.
"The f>ages that follow show
examples of how you and more
