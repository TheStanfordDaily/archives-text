A fine sight they are too, the
believers in non-violence, saying

that they are neither execution
ers nor victims. Very well then;
if you're not victims when the
government which you've voted
for, When the army in which
your . . . brothers are serving'
without hesitation or remorse
have undertaken race murder,
you are, without a sluulow of
doubt, executioners.
— J. P. Sartre
Few students here at Stan
ford would lay claim to being the
executioners. Rather we are
forced to become conscious that
our place in the system as stu
dents is closer to that of black
people at home and yellow peo
ple abroad. We are all victims.
It is an administration domi
nated by trustees who are in
a very .iteral sense the execu
tioners.
Why uoes the government in
sist on continuing to fight its
race war? Perhaps we should
ask the Stanford Trustees —
they have "connections" in high
places from the Graduate School
of Business to the Pentagon,
from Thailand to Peru, from the
Old Union Building to Stanford
Research Institute. Perhaps we
should ask them, since they seem
to have a very broad view of the
situation, why it is that we stu
dents are victims along with
black and yellow and red and
brown people.
Why are we forced to remain
students, unable to leave for fear
of General Hershey's boys? Why
are we forced to remain under
the tutelage of paternal profes
sors who hold the sanction of a
grade over our heads to insure
that in each of our particular
classes we are moving in the
right direction, that is, the di
rection they want? Why is a
committee like SCLC set up,
which explains for pages how Its
jurisdiction "shall extend to mat
ters of student conduct involv
ing the Honor Code and to such
non-academic conduct as may
wrrrant disciplinary sanctions
against individual students or
against membership organiza
tions of students," and then
makes the whole thing bullshit
with catch-22 which says "noth
ing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit
the authority and power of the
President to promulgate and en
force regulations governing stu
dent conduct at Stanford Univer
sity."
The administration, the Presi
dent, and the Board of Trustees

must stop victimizing students
with their bogus bureaucratic
committee structure which with
holds all but advisory power —
which is no power — from the
students.

with catch-22 which says "noth
ing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit
the authority and power of the
President to promulgate and en
force regulations governing stu
dent conduct at Stanford Univer
sity."
The administration, the Presi
dent, and the Board of Trustees

must stop victimizing students
with their bogus bureaucratic
committee structure which with
holds all but advisory power —
which is no power — from the
students.
A fine sight they are too, the
believers in non-violence, saying

that they are neither execution
ers nor victims. Very well then;
if you're not victims when the
government which you've voted
for, When the army in which
your . . . brothers are serving'
without hesitation or remorse
have undertaken race murder,
you are, without a sluulow of
doubt, executioners.
— J. P. Sartre
Few students here at Stan
ford would lay claim to being the
executioners. Rather we are
forced to become conscious that
our place in the system as stu
dents is closer to that of black
people at home and yellow peo
ple abroad. We are all victims.
It is an administration domi
nated by trustees who are in
a very .iteral sense the execu
tioners.
Why uoes the government in
sist on continuing to fight its
race war? Perhaps we should
ask the Stanford Trustees —
they have "connections" in high
places from the Graduate School
of Business to the Pentagon,
from Thailand to Peru, from the
Old Union Building to Stanford
Research Institute. Perhaps we
should ask them, since they seem
to have a very broad view of the
situation, why it is that we stu
dents are victims along with
black and yellow and red and
brown people.
Why are we forced to remain
students, unable to leave for fear
of General Hershey's boys? Why
are we forced to remain under
the tutelage of paternal profes
sors who hold the sanction of a
grade over our heads to insure
that in each of our particular
classes we are moving in the
right direction, that is, the di
rection they want? Why is a
committee like SCLC set up,
which explains for pages how Its
jurisdiction "shall extend to mat
ters of student conduct involv
ing the Honor Code and to such
non-academic conduct as may
wrrrant disciplinary sanctions
against individual students or
against membership organiza
tions of students," and then
makes the whole thing bullshit
with catch-22 which says "noth
ing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit
the authority and power of the
President to promulgate and en
force regulations governing stu
dent conduct at Stanford Univer
