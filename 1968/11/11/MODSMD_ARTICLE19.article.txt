The Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council is a structure — a
structure invented by the Com
mittee of Fifteen, prompted by
the May sit-in, and accepted this
fall by a complacent student
body. It is a structure which will
give birth to more structures —
rules of conduct, disciplinary
sanctions, etc. — to be enforced
by another structure, the Stan
ford Judicial Council. It also
adds the words SCLC and SJC
to the Stanford vocabulary. But
what about the people? (That's
you.)
The commentary I wish to
make in the few lines permitted
is a reflection upon our empha
sis to change structures rather
than people. For example, we
had two demonstrations last
year (not counting the Stanford
band demonstration): one
against the CIA and one against
the suspensions. As a result, we
now have SCLC to formulate
policies concerning such demon
strations, but this will by no
means prevent another demon
stration.
We are still very much un
aware of what last year was
about, of what our society is
about, and of where our society
is going — and wherever that is,
that's where it is taking us. Only
when we become critical agents
in that society will we have con
victions to act upon.
Does it matter? As Cleaver
said, there is no middle ground.
Everyone "is part of the solu
tion or part of the problem."
