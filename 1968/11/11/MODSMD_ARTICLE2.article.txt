Store In Menlo Park
The Free University store
where Franklin was arrested is
in Menlo Park. He was picked
up by, among others, Palo Alto
police sergeant Antony Poso.
Sgt. Poso was seen at last
Wednesday's White Plaza rally
sponsored by the same group that
sponsored the Election Wake.
Palo Alto police chief William
Hydie yesterday told The Daily
that Poso had not been on White
Plaza, on police duty. At the

time, Poso said he, and two
Menlo Park officers who were
at the noontime rally were there
on their "lunch hour." A picture
of Poso and the two Menlo Park
officers was in The Daily last
Thursday.
Franklin also told The Daily
that he was meeting with his
lawyer, Jim Wolpman, at the
Free University store when he
was arrested. He accused the po
lice of tapping his phone be
cause, he said, there was no
other way the Palo Alto police
could have known he was going
to be at the store.
The fact that it was the Palo
Alto police who picked him up
is further evidence, Franklin
said, that his phone is being
tapped. He said he had phoned
Wolpman shortly before going
to the store and asked the law
yer to meet him there. Franklin
said the police showed up at the
store within five minutes after
his arrival there.
Arrests Attacked
In a letter published in today's
Daily several medical students
attacked the moves against
Franklin and Sapir. The letter
questions the logic of arresting
someone for "failure to dis
perse" three days after the of
fense occurred. The charge has
also been attacked by others as
being in violation of the right
of free assembly.
Chief Hydie said police issued
the warrants several days after
the offense because "we know
who remained on the scene" af
ter orders were given to the
crowd to disperse.
Hydie further stated that one
reason the pair was not arrested
Tuesday night was that police
"were not trying to make mass
arrests" on the scene.
More Arrests?
The police chief continued,
"There are others we have been

considering depending on how
much evidence we can establish.
These two aren't the only ones.
There is a possibility there may
be others." He did not elaborate
on this.
Hydie said police were not ac
tively searching for Sapir. "As
for any active search, we don't
have any. When we come about
him, we'll arrest him." The po
lice chief's comments were
given in a phone interview with
The Daily.
The arrest of Franklin brings
to eight the number apprehend
ed as a result of the election
night demonstration. Most of the
others were also charged with
failure to disperse. Menchine is
the only one charged with a fel
ony.
Stanford ites Arrested
Stanford students arrested
Tuesday night include Fred Co
hen, a leader of the Stanford
SDS, and Robert Shinkosky, a
member of the conservative
Young Americans for Freedom.
Both Sapir and Franklin have
been involved in many demon
strations against the war in the
past several years. Sapir was
prosecuted, in the campus judi
cial system, for his role in last
year's anti-CIA demonstration.
Franklin also participated in
the demonstration, but no ac
tion was taken against him be
cause the judicial system in ef
fect at that time did not apply
to faculty and staff. The new
judicial system was recently ex
tended to cover faculty as well
as students.
Some faculty members feel
that this extension of jurisdic
tion can be traced to Franklin's
past activities.
Singled Out?
Sapir termed the recent ar
rests "selective" ones. He added
that "selective justice should not
be tolerated." Other sources also
suggested that the arrests of
Franklin and Sapir are moves
by police to single out promi
nent demonstrators. The letter
published in today's Daily sug
gests that the police are at
tempting such a tactic.
In a phone interview with
The Daily Franklin's wife said,
"It's very political. They're ar
resting known activists. . . . You
can understand why people
break cameras." She continued,
"I think they're going to bust
as many activists as they can
and harass them. ... I think
they're trying to isolate them."
Franklin is a tenured associ
ate professor of English who has
often been called "the only Mao
ist teaching at Stanford." He
freely admits he is a Marxist of
the Mao Tse Tung school. He
is on sabbatical leave this year
and has been active in several
high school demonstrations in
the Bav Area.

Palo Alto police chief William

Menlo Park officers who were
at the noontime rally were there
on their "lunch hour." A picture

Franklin also told The Daily
that he was meeting with his
lawyer, Jim Wolpman, at the
Free University store when he
was arrested. He accused the po

cause, he said, there was no
other way the Palo Alto police
could have known he was going

The fact that it was the Palo
Alto police who picked him up
is further evidence, Franklin
said, that his phone is being

Wolpman shortly before going

said the police showed up at the
store within five minutes after
his arrival there.
Arrests Attacked
In a letter published in today's
Daily several medical students
attacked the moves against
Franklin and Sapir. The letter
questions the logic of arresting
someone for "failure to dis
perse" three days after the of
fense occurred. The charge has
also been attacked by others as
being in violation of the right
of free assembly.
Chief Hydie said police issued
the warrants several days after
the offense because "we know
who remained on the scene" af
ter orders were given to the
crowd to disperse.
Hydie further stated that one
reason the pair was not arrested
Tuesday night was that police
"were not trying to make mass
arrests" on the scene.
More Arrests?
The police chief continued,
"There are others we have been

considering depending on how
much evidence we can establish.
These two aren't the only ones.
There is a possibility there may
be others." He did not elaborate
on this.
Hydie said police were not ac
tively searching for Sapir. "As
for any active search, we don't
have any. When we come about
him, we'll arrest him." The po
lice chief's comments were
given in a phone interview with
The Daily.
The arrest of Franklin brings
to eight the number apprehend

night demonstration. Most of the
others were also charged with
failure to disperse. Menchine is
the only one charged with a fel
ony.
Stanford ites Arrested
Stanford students arrested
Tuesday night include Fred Co

SDS, and Robert Shinkosky, a
member of the conservative
Young Americans for Freedom.
Both Sapir and Franklin have
been involved in many demon
strations against the war in the
past several years. Sapir was
prosecuted, in the campus judi
cial system, for his role in last
year's anti-CIA demonstration.
Franklin also participated in
the demonstration, but no ac
tion was taken against him be
cause the judicial system in ef
fect at that time did not apply
to faculty and staff. The new
judicial system was recently ex
tended to cover faculty as well
as students.
Some faculty members feel
that this extension of jurisdic
tion can be traced to Franklin's
past activities.
Singled Out?
Sapir termed the recent ar
rests "selective" ones. He added
that "selective justice should not
be tolerated." Other sources also
suggested that the arrests of
Franklin and Sapir are moves
by police to single out promi
nent demonstrators. The letter
published in today's Daily sug
gests that the police are at
tempting such a tactic.
In a phone interview with
The Daily Franklin's wife said,
"It's very political. They're ar
resting known activists. . . . You
can understand why people
break cameras." She continued,
"I think they're going to bust
as many activists as they can

they're trying to isolate them."
Franklin is a tenured associ

often been called "the only Mao

freely admits he is a Marxist of
the Mao Tse Tung school. He
is on sabbatical leave this year

Franklin also told The Daily

said the police showed up at the

Arrests Attacked
In a letter published in today's
Daily several medical students
attacked the moves against
Franklin and Sapir. The letter
questions the logic of arresting
someone for "failure to dis
perse" three days after the of
fense occurred. The charge has
also been attacked by others as
being in violation of the right
of free assembly.
Chief Hydie said police issued
the warrants several days after
the offense because "we know
who remained on the scene" af
ter orders were given to the
crowd to disperse.
Hydie further stated that one
reason the pair was not arrested
Tuesday night was that police
"were not trying to make mass
arrests" on the scene.
More Arrests?
The police chief continued,
"There are others we have been

considering depending on how
much evidence we can establish.
These two aren't the only ones.
There is a possibility there may
be others." He did not elaborate
on this.
Hydie said police were not ac
tively searching for Sapir. "As
for any active search, we don't
have any. When we come about
him, we'll arrest him." The po
lice chief's comments were
given in a phone interview with
The Daily.
The arrest of Franklin brings
to eight the number apprehend
ed as a result of the election
night demonstration. Most of the
others were also charged with
failure to disperse. Menchine is
the only one charged with a fel
ony.
Stanford ites Arrested
Stanford students arrested
Tuesday night include Fred Co
hen, a leader of the Stanford
SDS, and Robert Shinkosky, a
member of the conservative
Young Americans for Freedom.
Both Sapir and Franklin have
been involved in many demon
strations against the war in the
past several years. Sapir was
prosecuted, in the campus judi
cial system, for his role in last
year's anti-CIA demonstration.
Franklin also participated in
the demonstration, but no ac
tion was taken against him be
cause the judicial system in ef
fect at that time did not apply
to faculty and staff. The new
judicial system was recently ex
tended to cover faculty as well
as students.
Some faculty members feel
that this extension of jurisdic
tion can be traced to Franklin's
past activities.
Singled Out?
Sapir termed the recent ar
rests "selective" ones. He added
that "selective justice should not
be tolerated." Other sources also
suggested that the arrests of
Franklin and Sapir are moves
by police to single out promi
nent demonstrators. The letter
published in today's Daily sug
gests that the police are at
tempting such a tactic.
In a phone interview with
The Daily Franklin's wife said,
"It's very political. They're ar
resting known activists. . . . You
can understand why people
break cameras." She continued,
"I think they're going to bust
as many activists as they can
and harass them. ... I think
they're trying to isolate them."
Franklin is a tenured associ

often been called "the only Mao

freely admits he is a Marxist of
the Mao Tse Tung school. He
is on sabbatical leave this year
and has been active in several
