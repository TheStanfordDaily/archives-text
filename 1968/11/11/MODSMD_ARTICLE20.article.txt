The Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council can develop sensi

ble, effective, and liberal guide
lines to protect student freedom
on campus, if those elected to its
membership recognize and are
capable of showing both per
sonal and institutional responsi
bility. Neither a dreamy, nihilis
tic view of the University as an
Evil Establishment, nor its op
posite, a belief that the Univer
sity should act in loco parentis
for students, suits the times or
the campus. I am strongly op
posed to SDS philosophy be
cause I believe it to be against
freedom and justice, and boldly
for a transfer of power to a new
tyranny. I also strongly oppose
an entirely Trustee-run Univer
sity.
I believe I would be an effec
tive representative on the SCLC
for those who hold as I do that
carefully reasoned, thoughtful
discussion and analysis of prob
lems, tempered by the knowl
edge that opposition deserves
close study for its possible Tight
ness, is the most likely way to
improve affairs at Stanford.
Among the issues I would put
before the SCLC are the follow
ing:
1) Updating housing regula
tions.
2) What penalties, if any,
should the University apply for
nonacademic offenses?
3) Should the University cam
pus be a legal enclave with re
spect to civil and criminal law,
or should it deal only with aca
demic issues and leave all en
forcement and prosecution to
Santa Clara County?
