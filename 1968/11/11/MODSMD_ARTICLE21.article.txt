The Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council (SCLC) is a fancy
title for the new rule making
body on campus. Press releases
from Stanford constantly refer
to it as the body which will for
mulate rules for student con
duct and "discipline." Readers
could get the notion that SCLC
will restore "Law and Order" on
campus. Perhaps some readers
on and off campus draw that
conclusion in hopes strict guide
lines for student conduct will be

formulated by SCLC, ridding the
campus of drugs, sex, and mili
tant activism.
I would rather Stanford rid
itself of strict guidelines. There
are certainly pragmatic obsta
cles in the path of abolishing all
rules. Such considerations, how
ever, should temper but not over
power efforts directed at that
end. Stanford does not need a
reclarification, restatement, or
redefinition of drug rules and
open house hours. It's time some
one publicly a nnounced such
rules are antiquated, impractical,
and unnecessary.
SCLC should be a powerful in
fluence in extending students'
freedom at Stanford. If rules arc
to be made and enforced, they
should be directed at reinforc
ing student rights in the face of
long standing second rate citi
zenship to trustees, administra
tors, faculty members and their
departments.
