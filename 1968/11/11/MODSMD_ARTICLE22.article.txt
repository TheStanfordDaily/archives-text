The Legislative and Judicial
Charter of 1968 gave to students
the largest measure of self-gov
ernment that they have ever en
joyed. It will become a larger or
smaller measure as the expres
sion of student viewpoints on
the Legislative and Judicial
Councils is more or less vigor
ous and persuasiveâ€”hence the
responsibility of the student
body to elect effective spokes

mon for the student point of
view.
The SCLC is charged with
regulating student conduct. Im
plicit in that charge is the
Council's capacity to define (1)
the sorts of conduct that may
and may not be regulated and
(2) the method of regulation.
Under the first implied charge,
the Council should give high
priority to setting forth, in ad
dition to what is unpermitted,
what is permitted. Its goal in
doing so should be the elimina
tion of the remaining instances
of the doctrine of in loco paren
tis.
Under the second implied
charge, the Council has two du
ties of utmost importance.
One is to guarantee to stu
dents a fair hearing in cases of
alleged misconduct. There are
at present certain loopholes,
such as a forced leave of ab
sence for psychiatric disability,
through which students may be
disciplined without an impartial
review.
Of special importance is en
suring that students are given a
hearing by the Judicial Council
whenever they are accused of an
Honor Code violation. In a re
cent statement to the Academic
Council, Professor Marshall re
ported that some faculty mem
bers dispose of such cases extra
judicially.
My legal training and exper
ience as a member of the ASSU
Judicial Council have hopefully
given me some insight into the
problems of regulating student
conduct, and have certainly
caused me to be committed to
the protection of student rights
and interests.
