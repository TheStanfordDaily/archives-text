# Biologist Criticizes Pope's Stand On Contraceptives
## 
### 
A Roman Catholic Stanford
biologist flayed Pope Paul VI for
maintaining the church prohibi
tion against the use of contra
ceptives in birth control in a
speech Saturday at St. John's
College.
"Pope Paul VI is a tragic fig
ure in our times," said Doctor
John H. Thomas, a Stanford lec
turer. "So are many members
of the Roman Catholic hier
archy.
Archbishop Joseph McGuckcn
of San Francisco, for instance,
told me there was not a human

population problem." This
comes at a time when the sur
vival of our civilization depends
on achieving a "zero growth
rate" in the world's population,
he said.
"Most Christian churches are
more concerned with mainten
ance of doctrinal differences,
outmoded laws, and their own
prestige," Dr. Thomas said. "It
was disappointing enough when
Pope Paul VI said on his flying
trip to the United Nations in
October of 1965:
"Your task is to ensure that
there is enough bread on the
table of mankind, and not to
favor an artificial control of
births, which would be irration
al, in order to lessen the num
ber of guests at the banquet
of life.' "
"Paul was not recognizing the
problem and in addition does not
understand life when he makes
such statements," the Stanford
biologist asserted. "Neither you
nor I are guests at the banquet
of life. We are part of life and
subject to, not excluded from,
its biological and ecological
laws.
