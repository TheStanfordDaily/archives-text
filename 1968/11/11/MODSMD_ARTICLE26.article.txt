# Bunce Leads Resurgent Tribe Past Huskies
## 
### GARY CAVALLI 
Stanford finally found the pot
of gold at the end of the rain
bow Saturday afternoon, as the
Indians snapped a four-game
winless streak with a 35-20 vic
tory over Washington.
The triumph, Stanford's first
since Oct. 5, was a very satisfy
ing one for the Indians, who
played without six starters. San
dy-haired sophomore quarter
back Don Bunce came off the
bench to throw three touchdown
passes and score another one
himself after Jim Plunkett was
sidelined with bruised ribs.
"We really regained our pride
in a lot of respects today," a
delighted John Ralston re
marked after the game. "The
team had to show courage and
determination."
Receivers Jack Lasater and
Bob Moore, and defensive back
Tom Massey failed to suit up
because of injuries, safety-end
Mark Marquess was in Mexico
playing baseball, a hip pointer
limited Bubba Brown to running
only one play from scrimmage,
and the brilliant Plunkett missed
2V2 quarters.
Exit Plunkett
Plunkett hobbled off the field
with 14:51 left in the second
quarter. He was hurt on the
Tribe's first scoring play, an 11-
yard run-lateral worked with
Howie Williams.
The Stanford field-general
rolled to his right, was hit at
the six, then spun and lateraled
to Williams, who sprinted into
the end zone. But for all intents
and purposes, Plunkett was
through for the afternoon. He
was having a lot of trouble
breathing, and said after the
game that his ribs felt "pretty
sore."
Yesterday Coach Ralston re
vealed that Plunkett's x-rays
had shown nothing, so the 6-3
sophomore "will be ready to go"
next week in Stockton against
UOP.
The Indians didn't panic when
Plunkett departed. "We didn't
worry too much when Plunkett
got hurt. The competition is so

tough on this team that we fig
ure the guy on the second string
is as good as the starter," said
"Back of the Game" Howie Wil
liams, who should be an expert
on competition. He and Brown
have battled for the starting
tailback spot all year, with
Brown getting the nod the past
five weeks.
But Saturday Williams had
the best day of his career, gain
ing 133 yards on 22 carries. He
scored his second TD a minute
before the half on a 3-yard toss
from Bunce, after his slashing,
tackle-breaking 28-yard run had
put the ball on the 7.
Enter Bunco
Bunce had a few jitters after
taking over the reigns from
Plunkett.
"I was kind of nervous at the
start," the good-natured Bunce
admitted after the game. "But
after the first play you usually
get confidence in yourself. We
realized we had a job to do."
With the exception of one play
just before the half, Bunce did
the job well.
After Pat Preston picked off
a Gene Willis aerial at midfield
and returned it to the Washing
ton 20, Husky linebacker George
Jugum intercepted a Bunce pass
at the 15 and ran 85 yards like
a frightened colt for a touch
down. It was Jugum's second in
terception of the game. Earlier
he had picked off a Plunkett aer
ial and raced 39 yards to set up
Washington's first touchdown, a
5-yard burst by Bo Cornell.
From that point on, Bunce
was sensational. Late in the
third quarter he rolled out to his
right from the Stanford 20, and
rifled a 55-yard strike to All-
American flanker Gene Wash
ington, who gathered it in on the
Husky 25 and sped untouched
into the end zone for an 80-yard
touchdown.
Bunce described the play this
way: "I looked at Washington
first and saw the defense was
up on him pretty close. Then I
saw Ron Kadziel (the sopho
more who did a great job in
place of Moore at tight end) and

was about to throw to him when
I caught another glimpse of
Gene. He was wide open, so I de
cided to go for broke."
Rough Day For Worley
Washington had beaten A 1
Worley, reputedly one of the
finest defensive backs in the
country, by about 10 yards. It
was like that all afternoon.
Stu Kellner, who blocked two
field goal attempts and was
voted "Lineman of the Game,"
recovered a Husky fumble at
midfield just before time ran
out in the third quarter. With
Williams gaining 25 yards in 2
carries, the Indians scored in 6
plays, with Bunce taking it in
himself from the 1.
Washington fullback Carl
Wojciechowski fumbled the ball
right back to Stanford on the
Husky 28, as middle guard
George Buehler recovered for
Stanford.
Bunce wasted no time. He
faded back on first down and
lofted a perfect pass into the
left corner of the end zone to
Washington. Dan Spriesterback
and Bill Sprinkle had Gene tight
ly covered, but the pass was
there and Washington made an
unbelievable catch with a head
long dive. Bill Shoemaker's fifth
straight PAT made it 35-14.
The Huskies got a tainted
touchdown with 11 minutes left
when a pass interference call on

Rich Keller in the end zone gave
Washington a first down at the
one. Keller, covering Harrison
Wood, seemed to make a "hell
of a play" in Ralston's estima
tion, reaching in front of Wood
to flick the ball away at the last
instant.
Asked about the call after the
game, Keller admitted "I was
pretty upset at the time, but I'll
have to see the films. I know I
didn't get him with this hand
(indicating his right hand, which
deflected the ball) but the films
may show I rested my back
hand (left) on his shoulder. But
I don't think I did."
The Husky TD did little to
dampen Stanford's excitement
over the win. "We had a great
week of practice," said Kadziel,
who played the entire game with
a sprained shoulder since Moore
was unavailable. "We really
wanted to win this one."
To a man, the Indians wanted
this one for Ralston, using the
win as a response to the second
guessers who have been calling
for the coach's dismissal.
"I think you might see a move
ment from the team next week
asking that Coach Ralston be re
tained," both Williams and
Bunce said. "We should have
been winning them for Coach
Ralston like this all year," de
fensive back Brian Porter
agreed.

HERK WE GO AGAIN —Stanford quarterback Don Bunce lets fly to Gene Washington for eleven
yards on a down-and-out pattern against the Washington Huskies Saturday. Bunce came off the bench
when starter Jim Piunkett was injured, and sparked the Tribe to a 35-20 win. He completed 5 of 7
passes for 137 yards and three touchdowns, and ran in a fourth TD himself.
All-American flanker Washington (calling him an All-Ameriean "candidate" is getting to be a hit
superfluous) grabbed 0 passes for 2 touchdowns and 170 yards, setting all-time Stanford records for
single season yardage and touchdown passes.

the end zone. But for all intents
and purposes, Plunkett was
through for the afternoon. He
was having a lot of trouble
breathing, and said after the
game that his ribs felt "pretty
sore."
Yesterday Coach Ralston re
vealed that Plunkett's x-rays
had shown nothing, so the 6-3
sophomore "will be ready to go"
next week in Stockton against
UOP.
The Indians didn't panic when
Plunkett departed. "We didn't
worry too much when Plunkett
got hurt. The competition is so

tough on this team that we fig
ure the guy on the second string
is as good as the starter," said
"Back of the Game" Howie Wil
liams, who should be an expert
on competition. He and Brown
have battled for the starting
tailback spot all year, with
Brown getting the nod the past
five weeks.
But Saturday Williams had
the best day of his career, gain
ing 133 yards on 22 carries. He
scored his second TD a minute
before the half on a 3-yard toss
from Bunce, after his slashing,
tackle-breaking 28-yard run had
put the ball on the 7.
Enter Bunco
Bunce had a few jitters after
taking over the reigns from
Plunkett.
"I was kind of nervous at the
start," the good-natured Bunce
admitted after the game. "But
after the first play you usually
get confidence in yourself. We
realized we had a job to do."
With the exception of one play
just before the half, Bunce did
the job well.
After Pat Preston picked off
a Gene Willis aerial at midfield
and returned it to the Washing
ton 20, Husky linebacker George
Jugum intercepted a Bunce pass
at the 15 and ran 85 yards like
a frightened colt for a touch
down. It was Jugum's second in
terception of the game. Earlier
he had picked off a Plunkett aer
ial and raced 39 yards to set up
Washington's first touchdown, a
5-yard burst by Bo Cornell.
From that point on, Bunce
was sensational. Late in the
third quarter he rolled out to his
right from the Stanford 20, and
rifled a 55-yard strike to All-
American flanker Gene Wash
ington, who gathered it in on the
Husky 25 and sped untouched
into the end zone for an 80-yard
touchdown.
Bunce described the play this
way: "I looked at Washington
first and saw the defense was
up on him pretty close. Then I
saw Ron Kadziel (the sopho
more who did a great job in
place of Moore at tight end) and

was about to throw to him when
I caught another glimpse of
Gene. He was wide open, so I de
cided to go for broke."
Rough Day For Worley
Washington had beaten A 1
Worley, reputedly one of the
finest defensive backs in the
country, by about 10 yards. It
was like that all afternoon.
Stu Kellner, who blocked two
field goal attempts and was
voted "Lineman of the Game,"
recovered a Husky fumble at
midfield just before time ran
out in the third quarter. With
Williams gaining 25 yards in 2
carries, the Indians scored in 6
plays, with Bunce taking it in
himself from the 1.
Washington fullback Carl
Wojciechowski fumbled the ball
right back to Stanford on the
Husky 28, as middle guard
George Buehler recovered for
Stanford.
Bunce wasted no time. He
faded back on first down and
lofted a perfect pass into the
left corner of the end zone to
Washington. Dan Spriesterback
and Bill Sprinkle had Gene tight
ly covered, but the pass was
there and Washington made an
unbelievable catch with a head
long dive. Bill Shoemaker's fifth
straight PAT made it 35-14.
The Huskies got a tainted
touchdown with 11 minutes left
when a pass interference call on

Rich Keller in the end zone gave
Washington a first down at the
one. Keller, covering Harrison
Wood, seemed to make a "hell
of a play" in Ralston's estima
tion, reaching in front of Wood
to flick the ball away at the last
instant.
Asked about the call after the
game, Keller admitted "I was
pretty upset at the time, but I'll
have to see the films. I know I
didn't get him with this hand
(indicating his right hand, which
deflected the ball) but the films
may show I rested my back
hand (left) on his shoulder. But
I don't think I did."
The Husky TD did little to
dampen Stanford's excitement
over the win. "We had a great
week of practice," said Kadziel,
who played the entire game with
a sprained shoulder since Moore
was unavailable. "We really
wanted to win this one."
To a man, the Indians wanted
this one for Ralston, using the
win as a response to the second
guessers who have been calling
for the coach's dismissal.
"I think you might see a move
ment from the team next week
asking that Coach Ralston be re
tained," both Williams and
Bunce said. "We should have
been winning them for Coach
Ralston like this all year," de
fensive back Brian Porter
agreed.

HERK WE GO AGAIN —Stanford quarterback Don Bunce lets fly to Gene Washington for eleven
yards on a down-and-out pattern against the Washington Huskies Saturday. Bunce came off the bench
when starter Jim Piunkett was injured, and sparked the Tribe to a 35-20 win. He completed 5 of 7
passes for 137 yards and three touchdowns, and ran in a fourth TD himself.
All-American flanker Washington (calling him an All-Ameriean "candidate" is getting to be a hit
superfluous) grabbed 0 passes for 2 touchdowns and 170 yards, setting all-time Stanford records for
single season yardage and touchdown passes.
Stanford finally found the pot
of gold at the end of the rain
bow Saturday afternoon, as the
Indians snapped a four-game
winless streak with a 35-20 vic
tory over Washington.
The triumph, Stanford's first
since Oct. 5, was a very satisfy
ing one for the Indians, who
played without six starters. San
dy-haired sophomore quarter
back Don Bunce came off the
bench to throw three touchdown
passes and score another one
himself after Jim Plunkett was
sidelined with bruised ribs.
"We really regained our pride
in a lot of respects today," a
delighted John Ralston re
marked after the game. "The
team had to show courage and
determination."
Receivers Jack Lasater and
Bob Moore, and defensive back
Tom Massey failed to suit up
because of injuries, safety-end
Mark Marquess was in Mexico
playing baseball, a hip pointer
limited Bubba Brown to running
only one play from scrimmage,
and the brilliant Plunkett missed
2V2 quarters.

after the first play you usually
get confidence in yourself. We
realized we had a job to do."
With the exception of one play
just before the half, Bunce did
the job well.
After Pat Preston picked off
a Gene Willis aerial at midfield
and returned it to the Washing
ton 20, Husky linebacker George
Jugum intercepted a Bunce pass
at the 15 and ran 85 yards like
a frightened colt for a touch
down. It was Jugum's second in
terception of the game. Earlier
he had picked off a Plunkett aer
ial and raced 39 yards to set up
Washington's first touchdown, a
5-yard burst by Bo Cornell.
From that point on, Bunce
was sensational. Late in the
third quarter he rolled out to his
right from the Stanford 20, and
rifled a 55-yard strike to All-
American flanker Gene Wash
ington, who gathered it in on the
Husky 25 and sped untouched
into the end zone for an 80-yard
touchdown.
Bunce described the play this
way: "I looked at Washington
first and saw the defense was
up on him pretty close. Then I
saw Ron Kadziel (the sopho
more who did a great job in
place of Moore at tight end) and

was about to throw to him when
I caught another glimpse of
Gene. He was wide open, so I de
cided to go for broke."
Rough Day For Worley
Washington had beaten A 1
Worley, reputedly one of the
finest defensive backs in the
country, by about 10 yards. It
was like that all afternoon.
Stu Kellner, who blocked two
field goal attempts and was
voted "Lineman of the Game,"
recovered a Husky fumble at
midfield just before time ran
out in the third quarter. With
Williams gaining 25 yards in 2
carries, the Indians scored in 6
plays, with Bunce taking it in
himself from the 1.
Washington fullback Carl
Wojciechowski fumbled the ball
right back to Stanford on the
Husky 28, as middle guard
George Buehler recovered for
Stanford.
Bunce wasted no time. He
faded back on first down and
lofted a perfect pass into the
left corner of the end zone to
Washington. Dan Spriesterback
and Bill Sprinkle had Gene tight
ly covered, but the pass was
there and Washington made an
unbelievable catch with a head
long dive. Bill Shoemaker's fifth
straight PAT made it 35-14.
The Huskies got a tainted
touchdown with 11 minutes left
when a pass interference call on

Rich Keller in the end zone gave
Washington a first down at the
one. Keller, covering Harrison
Wood, seemed to make a "hell
of a play" in Ralston's estima
tion, reaching in front of Wood
to flick the ball away at the last
instant.
Asked about the call after the
game, Keller admitted "I was
pretty upset at the time, but I'll
have to see the films. I know I
didn't get him with this hand
(indicating his right hand, which
deflected the ball) but the films
may show I rested my back
hand (left) on his shoulder. But
I don't think I did."
The Husky TD did little to
dampen Stanford's excitement
over the win. "We had a great
week of practice," said Kadziel,
who played the entire game with
a sprained shoulder since Moore
was unavailable. "We really
wanted to win this one."
To a man, the Indians wanted
this one for Ralston, using the
win as a response to the second
guessers who have been calling
for the coach's dismissal.
"I think you might see a move
ment from the team next week
asking that Coach Ralston be re
tained," both Williams and
Bunce said. "We should have
been winning them for Coach
Ralston like this all year," de
fensive back Brian Porter
agreed.

HERK WE GO AGAIN —Stanford quarterback Don Bunce lets fly to Gene Washington for eleven
yards on a down-and-out pattern against the Washington Huskies Saturday. Bunce came off the bench
when starter Jim Piunkett was injured, and sparked the Tribe to a 35-20 win. He completed 5 of 7
passes for 137 yards and three touchdowns, and ran in a fourth TD himself.
All-American flanker Washington (calling him an All-Ameriean "candidate" is getting to be a hit
superfluous) grabbed 0 passes for 2 touchdowns and 170 yards, setting all-time Stanford records for
single season yardage and touchdown passes.
Stanford finally found the pot
of gold at the end of the rain
bow Saturday afternoon, as the
Indians snapped a four-game
winless streak with a 35-20 vic
tory over Washington.
The triumph, Stanford's first
since Oct. 5, was a very satisfy
ing one for the Indians, who
played without six starters. San
dy-haired sophomore quarter
back Don Bunce came off the
bench to throw three touchdown
passes and score another one
himself after Jim Plunkett was
sidelined with bruised ribs.
"We really regained our pride
in a lot of respects today," a
delighted John Ralston re
marked after the game. "The
team had to show courage and
determination."
Receivers Jack Lasater and
Bob Moore, and defensive back
Tom Massey failed to suit up
because of injuries, safety-end
Mark Marquess was in Mexico
playing baseball, a hip pointer
limited Bubba Brown to running
only one play from scrimmage,
and the brilliant Plunkett missed
2V2 quarters.
Exit Plunkett
Plunkett hobbled off the field
with 14:51 left in the second
quarter. He was hurt on the
Tribe's first scoring play, an 11-
yard run-lateral worked with
Howie Williams.
The Stanford field-general
rolled to his right, was hit at
the six, then spun and lateraled
to Williams, who sprinted into
the end zone. But for all intents
and purposes, Plunkett was
through for the afternoon. He
was having a lot of trouble
breathing, and said after the
game that his ribs felt "pretty
sore."
Yesterday Coach Ralston re
vealed that Plunkett's x-rays
had shown nothing, so the 6-3
sophomore "will be ready to go"
next week in Stockton against
UOP.
The Indians didn't panic when
Plunkett departed. "We didn't
worry too much when Plunkett
got hurt. The competition is so

tough on this team that we fig
ure the guy on the second string
is as good as the starter," said
"Back of the Game" Howie Wil
liams, who should be an expert
on competition. He and Brown
have battled for the starting
tailback spot all year, with
Brown getting the nod the past
five weeks.
But Saturday Williams had
the best day of his career, gain
ing 133 yards on 22 carries. He
scored his second TD a minute
before the half on a 3-yard toss
from Bunce, after his slashing,
tackle-breaking 28-yard run had
put the ball on the 7.
Enter Bunco
Bunce had a few jitters after
taking over the reigns from
Plunkett.
"I was kind of nervous at the
start," the good-natured Bunce
admitted after the game. "But

Rough Day For Worley
Washington had beaten A 1
Worley, reputedly one of the
finest defensive backs in the
country, by about 10 yards. It
was like that all afternoon.
Stu Kellner, who blocked two
field goal attempts and was
voted "Lineman of the Game,"
recovered a Husky fumble at
midfield just before time ran
out in the third quarter. With
Williams gaining 25 yards in 2
carries, the Indians scored in 6
plays, with Bunce taking it in
himself from the 1.
Washington fullback Carl
Wojciechowski fumbled the ball
right back to Stanford on the
Husky 28, as middle guard
George Buehler recovered for
Stanford.
Bunce wasted no time. He
faded back on first down and
lofted a perfect pass into the
left corner of the end zone to
Washington. Dan Spriesterback
and Bill Sprinkle had Gene tight
ly covered, but the pass was
there and Washington made an
unbelievable catch with a head
long dive. Bill Shoemaker's fifth
straight PAT made it 35-14.
The Huskies got a tainted
touchdown with 11 minutes left
when a pass interference call on

Rich Keller in the end zone gave
Washington a first down at the
one. Keller, covering Harrison
Wood, seemed to make a "hell
of a play" in Ralston's estima
tion, reaching in front of Wood
to flick the ball away at the last
instant.
Asked about the call after the
game, Keller admitted "I was
pretty upset at the time, but I'll
have to see the films. I know I
didn't get him with this hand
(indicating his right hand, which
deflected the ball) but the films
may show I rested my back
hand (left) on his shoulder. But
I don't think I did."
The Husky TD did little to
dampen Stanford's excitement
over the win. "We had a great
week of practice," said Kadziel,
who played the entire game with
a sprained shoulder since Moore
was unavailable. "We really
wanted to win this one."
To a man, the Indians wanted
this one for Ralston, using the
win as a response to the second
guessers who have been calling
for the coach's dismissal.
"I think you might see a move
ment from the team next week
asking that Coach Ralston be re
tained," both Williams and
Bunce said. "We should have
been winning them for Coach
Ralston like this all year," de
fensive back Brian Porter
agreed.

HERK WE GO AGAIN —Stanford quarterback Don Bunce lets fly to Gene Washington for eleven
yards on a down-and-out pattern against the Washington Huskies Saturday. Bunce came off the bench
when starter Jim Piunkett was injured, and sparked the Tribe to a 35-20 win. He completed 5 of 7
passes for 137 yards and three touchdowns, and ran in a fourth TD himself.
All-American flanker Washington (calling him an All-Ameriean "candidate" is getting to be a hit
superfluous) grabbed 0 passes for 2 touchdowns and 170 yards, setting all-time Stanford records for
single season yardage and touchdown passes.
Stanford finally found the pot
of gold at the end of the rain
bow Saturday afternoon, as the
Indians snapped a four-game
winless streak with a 35-20 vic
tory over Washington.
The triumph, Stanford's first
since Oct. 5, was a very satisfy
ing one for the Indians, who
played without six starters. San
dy-haired sophomore quarter
back Don Bunce came off the
bench to throw three touchdown
passes and score another one
himself after Jim Plunkett was
sidelined with bruised ribs.
"We really regained our pride
in a lot of respects today," a
delighted John Ralston re
marked after the game. "The
team had to show courage and
determination."
Receivers Jack Lasater and
Bob Moore, and defensive back
Tom Massey failed to suit up
because of injuries, safety-end
Mark Marquess was in Mexico
playing baseball, a hip pointer
limited Bubba Brown to running
only one play from scrimmage,
and the brilliant Plunkett missed
2V2 quarters.
Exit Plunkett
Plunkett hobbled off the field
with 14:51 left in the second
quarter. He was hurt on the
Tribe's first scoring play, an 11-
yard run-lateral worked with
Howie Williams.
The Stanford field-general
rolled to his right, was hit at
the six, then spun and lateraled
to Williams, who sprinted into
the end zone. But for all intents
and purposes, Plunkett was
through for the afternoon. He
was having a lot of trouble
breathing, and said after the
game that his ribs felt "pretty
sore."
Yesterday Coach Ralston re
vealed that Plunkett's x-rays
had shown nothing, so the 6-3
sophomore "will be ready to go"
next week in Stockton against
UOP.
The Indians didn't panic when
Plunkett departed. "We didn't
worry too much when Plunkett
got hurt. The competition is so

tough on this team that we fig
ure the guy on the second string
is as good as the starter," said
"Back of the Game" Howie Wil
liams, who should be an expert
on competition. He and Brown
have battled for the starting
tailback spot all year, with
Brown getting the nod the past
five weeks.
But Saturday Williams had
the best day of his career, gain
ing 133 yards on 22 carries. He
scored his second TD a minute
before the half on a 3-yard toss
from Bunce, after his slashing,
tackle-breaking 28-yard run had
put the ball on the 7.
Enter Bunco
Bunce had a few jitters after
taking over the reigns from
Plunkett.
"I was kind of nervous at the
start," the good-natured Bunce
admitted after the game. "But
after the first play you usually
get confidence in yourself. We
realized we had a job to do."
With the exception of one play
just before the half, Bunce did
the job well.
After Pat Preston picked off
a Gene Willis aerial at midfield
and returned it to the Washing
ton 20, Husky linebacker George
Jugum intercepted a Bunce pass
at the 15 and ran 85 yards like
a frightened colt for a touch
down. It was Jugum's second in
terception of the game. Earlier
he had picked off a Plunkett aer
ial and raced 39 yards to set up
Washington's first touchdown, a
5-yard burst by Bo Cornell.
From that point on, Bunce
was sensational. Late in the
third quarter he rolled out to his
right from the Stanford 20, and
rifled a 55-yard strike to All-
American flanker Gene Wash
ington, who gathered it in on the
Husky 25 and sped untouched
into the end zone for an 80-yard
touchdown.
Bunce described the play this
way: "I looked at Washington
first and saw the defense was
up on him pretty close. Then I
saw Ron Kadziel (the sopho
more who did a great job in
place of Moore at tight end) and

was about to throw to him when
I caught another glimpse of
Gene. He was wide open, so I de
cided to go for broke."
