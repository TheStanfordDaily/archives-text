# Pinter's 'Birthday Party' Will Open Wednesday
## 
### 
"The Birthday Party," open
ing Nov. 13, is the first under
graduate production of the year
1o bo presented by the Depart
ment of Speech and Drama.
The play is directed by Pro
fessor William Sharp and fea
tures Chris Bennion as McMann,
John Davis as Petey, Carrillo
Gantner as Goldberg, Gail Hoff
man as Lulu, Louise Shimmel as
Meg, and Bert Nagel as Stanley.
Set and costume design are by
Wendell Cole and lighting is by
Steven M. Vickers.
The Birthday Party concerns
a man who tries to escape the
real world by isolating himself
in a rooming house in a seaside
town. His privacy and sanity are
broken when his motherly land

lady and two others plan a birth
day party for him which turns
into something shockingly dif
ferent. Pinter has created a
drama of the private terrors and
personal farce of everyday life.
Pinter, described by the Lon
don Times as "the most original,
disturbing, and arresting talent
in theatrical London," has in
just ten years reached the fore
front of the new British drama.
His work has been described as
"angry" or "absurdist". Pinter
himself has denied any allegori
cal, philosophical, or symbolic
interpretations of his plays.
Zerlina will be sung by Jean
nette Pilou who made her first
appearance in San Francisco as
Madame Butterfly earlier this

season. The Italian bass Ugo
Trama return to sing Leporello
which he performed here in
19<>5 when the opera was last
presented. Allan Monk, a young
Canadian baritone is Maseto.
"The Birthday* Party" will
leave many unanswered ques
tions. One never understands
exactly why Stanley is threat
ened or even if it is his birth
day. As Sharp says,"It is not
art's business to explain, only to
stimulate. Art fails only when
it is forgotten." "The Birthday
Party" is certainly a play not
easy to forget.
"The Birthday Party" plays at
8 p.m. Wednesday through Sat
urdays beginning November 13
and continuing through Novem
ber 23 at The Nitery in the Old
Union. Tickets are available
from the Memorial Hall Box O!-
fice, 321-2300, ext. 2934.
