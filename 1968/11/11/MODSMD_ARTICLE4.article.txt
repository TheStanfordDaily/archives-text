# ASSU Voting Opens Today
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
ASSU elections, closed down
last week on the basis of a num
ber of By-Laws violations, will
begin again this week at three
polling places on campus.
Polls will be open from 9:30
a.m. to 4 p.m. today and tomor
row in front of the Post Office,
the physics tank, and engineer
ing corner.
Six candidates are vying for
the student posts on the Student
Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC>. Seven candidates or
teams teams are seeking the
Head Y-ll Leader position.
Referendum Questions
The four referendum ques
tions on the ballot deal with an
amendment to the ASSU con
stitution, administration action
on issres vital to student
groups, and suspension of Tom
my Smith and John Carlos from
the U.S. Olympic team.
Statements by five of the
SCLC candidates appear on page
four of today's Daily. Candi
dates for the post include: Eric
Aspen, junior, philosophy; Jeff
Kane, junior in an inter-depart
mental major; Anthony Maran,
graduate student, physics; Geri
Palast, freshman, general stud
ies; Richard Such, law student;
and Philip Taubman, junior, his
tory.
LASSU ruled at its last meet
ing that there be at least one
graduate and one undergraduate
student on SCLC.
SCLC, as defined by the Com
mittee of Fifteen statement of
last spring and accepted by the
student body earlier this fall,
consists of six faculty and five
student members. The ASSU
President and the LASSU
Speaker are the other student
members.
The group is empowered to
legislate matters of "student
conduct involving the Honor
Code and such non-academic
conduct as may warrant discip
linary sanctions against either
students or their organizations.
Yell Leader
Candidates or teams of can
didates for Head Yell Leader
include: Richard Bogart, junior,
physics; Richard Borchers,
sophomore, general studies;
Steve Cronenberg and Mike
Pete, juniors in statistics and
biology; Don Hearn and Gary
Griffieth, freshmen in general
studies; Scott "The Cosmic As
paragus" Keeney, junior, Eng
lish; Gerodie Lawry, sophomore,
general studies; and Willie
Wauters, a sophomore in gen
eral studies, and Ty Gerard,

terminal graduate student in ap
plied physics.
If the proposed amendment
receives the support of two
thirds of the students voting on
the issue, LASSU would be re
instituted as a Senate with ten
undergraduate and ten graduate
student members. The ASSU
President and the Financial
Manager would serve as ex
ofTicio members without a vote.
Election of the undergraduate
representatives would be by the
Hare system of proportional
representation, as adopted by
the student body in the last
election.
Financial Matters
The amendment's suggestion
on financial matters repeats an
earlier proposal that the Senate
establish student fees essential
to operation of student govern
ment. Fees over and above that
would have to be approved by a
majority vote of the student
body.
The Financial Manager would
be appointed after the spring
election of President and Vice-
President by a committee com
posed of the outgoing Financial
Manager, the incoming Presi
dent, and one graduate and one
undergraduate student chosen
by the Senate.
The three other propositions
are as follows:
• It is the opinion of the stu
dents of Stanford University
that the Administration of Stan
ford University shall not accede
to any demands or yield to any
coercive tactics made by any
group or organization of stu
dents without considering and
if necessary determining by
vote, the majority opinion of
the students of Stanford Uni
versity.
• As a constructive alterna
tive to coercive tactics, we pro
pose that a representative body
of students, faculty, and admin
istration: a) develop procedures
for the determination and com
munication of facts associated
with important issues, and b)
establish a legal procedure for
the effective expression of opin
ion, grievances, and suggested
policy changes.
• The Associated Students of
Stanford University voice their
strong disapproval of the recent
actions of the U.S. Olympic
Committee with respect to the
suspension of Tommie Smith
and John Carlos. We further
more strongly support Mr.
Smith and Mr. Carlos in their
endeavors working for social
justice.

and Philip Taubman, junior, his

LASSU ruled at its last meet
ing that there be at least one
graduate and one undergraduate
student on SCLC.
SCLC, as defined by the Com
mittee of Fifteen statement of
last spring and accepted by the
student body earlier this fall,
consists of six faculty and five
student members. The ASSU
President and the LASSU
Speaker are the other student
members.
The group is empowered to
legislate matters of "student
conduct involving the Honor
Code and such non-academic
conduct as may warrant discip
linary sanctions against either
students or their organizations.
Yell Leader
Candidates or teams of can
didates for Head Yell Leader
include: Richard Bogart, junior,
physics; Richard Borchers,
sophomore, general studies;
Steve Cronenberg and Mike
Pete, juniors in statistics and
biology; Don Hearn and Gary
Griffieth, freshmen in general
studies; Scott "The Cosmic As
paragus" Keeney, junior, Eng
lish; Gerodie Lawry, sophomore,
general studies; and Willie
Wauters, a sophomore in gen
eral studies, and Ty Gerard,

terminal graduate student in ap
plied physics.
If the proposed amendment
receives the support of two
thirds of the students voting on
the issue, LASSU would be re
instituted as a Senate with ten
undergraduate and ten graduate
student members. The ASSU
President and the Financial
Manager would serve as ex
ofTicio members without a vote.
Election of the undergraduate
representatives would be by the
Hare system of proportional
representation, as adopted by
the student body in the last
election.
Financial Matters
The amendment's suggestion
on financial matters repeats an
earlier proposal that the Senate
establish student fees essential
to operation of student govern
ment. Fees over and above that
would have to be approved by a
majority vote of the student
body.
The Financial Manager would
be appointed after the spring
election of President and Vice-
President by a committee com
posed of the outgoing Financial
Manager, the incoming Presi
dent, and one graduate and one
undergraduate student chosen
by the Senate.
The three other propositions
are as follows:
• It is the opinion of the stu
dents of Stanford University
that the Administration of Stan
ford University shall not accede
to any demands or yield to any
coercive tactics made by any
group or organization of stu
dents without considering and
if necessary determining by
vote, the majority opinion of
the students of Stanford Uni
versity.
• As a constructive alterna
tive to coercive tactics, we pro
pose that a representative body
of students, faculty, and admin
istration: a) develop procedures
for the determination and com
munication of facts associated
with important issues, and b)
establish a legal procedure for
the effective expression of opin
ion, grievances, and suggested
policy changes.
• The Associated Students of
Stanford University voice their
strong disapproval of the recent
actions of the U.S. Olympic
Committee with respect to the
suspension of Tommie Smith
and John Carlos. We further
more strongly support Mr.
Smith and Mr. Carlos in their
endeavors working for social
justice.

biology; Don Hearn and Gary
Griffieth, freshmen in general
studies; Scott "The Cosmic As
paragus" Keeney, junior, Eng
lish; Gerodie Lawry, sophomore,
general studies; and Willie
Wauters, a sophomore in gen
eral studies, and Ty Gerard,

terminal graduate student in ap
plied physics.
If the proposed amendment
receives the support of two
thirds of the students voting on
the issue, LASSU would be re
instituted as a Senate with ten
undergraduate and ten graduate
student members. The ASSU
President and the Financial
Manager would serve as ex
ofTicio members without a vote.
Election of the undergraduate
representatives would be by the
Hare system of proportional
representation, as adopted by
the student body in the last
election.
Financial Matters
The amendment's suggestion
on financial matters repeats an
earlier proposal that the Senate
establish student fees essential
to operation of student govern
ment. Fees over and above that
would have to be approved by a
majority vote of the student
body.
The Financial Manager would
be appointed after the spring
election of President and Vice-
President by a committee com
posed of the outgoing Financial
Manager, the incoming Presi
dent, and one graduate and one
undergraduate student chosen
by the Senate.
The three other propositions
are as follows:
• It is the opinion of the stu
dents of Stanford University
that the Administration of Stan
ford University shall not accede
to any demands or yield to any
coercive tactics made by any
group or organization of stu
dents without considering and
if necessary determining by
vote, the majority opinion of
the students of Stanford Uni
versity.
• As a constructive alterna
tive to coercive tactics, we pro
pose that a representative body
of students, faculty, and admin
istration: a) develop procedures
for the determination and com
munication of facts associated
with important issues, and b)
establish a legal procedure for
the effective expression of opin
ion, grievances, and suggested
policy changes.
• The Associated Students of
Stanford University voice their
strong disapproval of the recent
actions of the U.S. Olympic
Committee with respect to the
suspension of Tommie Smith
and John Carlos. We further
more strongly support Mr.
Smith and Mr. Carlos in their
endeavors working for social
justice.
