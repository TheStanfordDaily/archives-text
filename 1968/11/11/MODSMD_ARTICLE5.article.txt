# Senate Votes To Liberalize Lab Science Requirements
## 
### KIM THORBURN 
S'anford students who claim
they faint at the sight of a dis
sected frog are no longer forced
to put off taking biology until
their senior year. Under a reso
lution adopted by the Academic
Senate last week, students who
haven't taken biology in high
school are not required to take
it for graduation here.
In addition, students who have
not had high school chemistry or
physics are not required to take
a series of one of the physical
sciences.

There is no change in the num
ber of units required in natural
science. However, the resolu
tion, effective immediately, al
lows for greater flexibility in
fulfilling the requirements, but
it is still impossible for them
to be met without a laboratory
sequence.
Under the resolution, recom
mended by the Committee on
General Studies, students will
no longer be compelled to take
science courses that they pur
posefully avoided in high school.
The courses that are most di

rectly affected are Biology 4, 5;
the Physics 20 series; Physical
Science 1, 2, 3; Chemistry 1,
2, 3; and Geoscience 1, 2.
David Regnery, Professor of
Biology and a member of the
General Studies Committee, feels
that most students at the Uni
versity have already had both
biology and physical sciences in
high school so the change will
have little effect on them.
Many students study biology
because they are frightened by
the "mystical, mathematical na
ture" of the physical sciences,

Rpgnery says. Ho adds that some
students avoid biology because
they thing of it as a "dirty, nasty
subject."
Physical Science 1, 2, 3 may
be hit harder by the change. As
sociate Professor Julien Ripley
feels that many students will
now avoid this course because
of the math, and more students
will take biology.
The Physics 20 series and
Chemistry 1, 2, 3, will not be so
directly affected. Arthur Schaw
low, Head of the Physics De
partment and teacher of the ba
sic physics series, says that his
class is bigger this year. Gener
ally the dropout rate in this
series is very low so the number
of students who continue in
Physics 23 in winter quarter
may indicate the effect the reso
lution will have on the size of
the courses.
Richard Eastman, Professor of
Chemistry, says the change will
have "little impact" on Chemis
try 1, 2, 3 "because most stu
dents are taking them in prepa
ration for more specific areas
of study." Chemistry is a "ser
vice course" for biology, medi
cine and other sciences.
Professor Robert Compton of
Geology says that he hopes that
change will reduce the enroll
ment in Geoscience 1, 2. Smaller
classes allow "more latitude with
respect to what we can do."
More specifically, he mentions
field trips to Yosemite.
Professor Compton says that
a reduction in the number of stu
dents taking Geoscience 1. 2
won't necessarily affect "the
quality of interest or of the
class." This would occur with an
elimination of the science re
quirements altogether.
