# Discussions To Continue For Increased TA Salaries
## 
### 
Administration officials and
representatives of teaching as
sistants (TA's) will meet today
for a second negotiation session
over TA demands for salary
raises.
Today's session follows an
Oct. 24 meeting at which politi
cal science TA's presented de
mands for a $700 yearly salary
rise to $3,000 plus an additional
$300 for each dependent.
At that meeting, Vice Provost
E. Howard Brooks explained
that immediate salary raises
could be implemented only at
great cost to other programs,
since there are no unallocated
funds. Such a rise in the stipends
of all 350 TA's would cost the
University an additional $245,-
000 per year, he claimed.
And although Brooks saw lit

tle possibility for squeezing the
budget for salary increases for
next year, he agreed with politi
cal science TA steward Richard
Young that the University is
"substantially behind" TA sal
ary levels of other universities.
Counter-Proposal
A counter-proposal from Uni
versity administrators is expect
ed at this afternoon's negotia
tion session, to be held at 4:00
in the humanities and sciences
conference room.
Young, representing the 11 po
litical science TA's, has listed a
Nov. 30 deadline for the comple
tion of the negotiations. The
specter of a TA strike if a satis
factory conclusion has not been
reached by that date has been
raised by several graduate stu
dents.
Young will be joined at to

day's negotiations by TA's from
the English and anthropology
departments and a representa
tive of the Stanford graduate
student union.
The TA's from both depart
ments have passed resolutions
asking similar increases in
benefits. Brooks has made it
clear, however, that any action
taken in the form of increased
stipends would be applied uni
formly to all of the University's
TA's.
Graduate students in biology
added their support to the de
mands last Tuesday. By a 35-7
vote, with four abstentions, the
biology students joined the TA's
of three other departments, the
graduate student union local,
and the local Students for a
Democratic Society chapter in
voicing support for the demands.
