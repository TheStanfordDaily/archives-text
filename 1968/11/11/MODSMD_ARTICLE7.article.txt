## Support For TA's 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
On November 7, 1968, the un
dersigned Teaching Assistants
from the Undergraduate Special
course in Racism and Prejudice
(U.5.170A) voted to endorse the
demands of the Political Science
graduate students.
We support them in their ne
gotiations with the University
administration and urge the
adoption of a minimum salary
of $3000 per year plus a $300
dependency allowance for all
Teaching and Research Assist
ants effective Winter Quarter.

• Faculty Freedom
Editor, The Daily:
While the California Regents
are being criticized for abridg
ing "academic freedom," there
has not been the same outpour
ing of criticism for University
faculty members who are
abridging "academic responsi
bility."
It certainly is not a respons
ible use of University authority
to signify as an instructor a
convicted felon whose language
is strictly from the gutter.
As an object of study, Cleaver
and his views may hold some
interest, but these can be quite
adequately studied while the
subject remains where the
courts have decided he belongs
—in jail.
