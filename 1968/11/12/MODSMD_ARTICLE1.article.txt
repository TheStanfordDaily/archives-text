# Cal Regent, Hoover Institution Head Reflects On Student Grievances
## 
### MARGIE WOLF 
Hoover Institution Director
and University of California Re
gent Glenn Campbell curled his
right wrist behind his ear. From
behind half-wire glasses his eyes
lingered briefly on the fog on
the ground below Hoover
Tower's eleventh level.
"I want to go on record as
saying," he stated with carefully
meted firmness, that "students
have legitimate and important
grievance.*."
The words were precisely
measured by a man who has
himself be.?n pestered with con
troversy. Campbell has been
forced to defend the Institution's
role since his arrival in early
1960 and his views as a regent
since his appointment last year.
He suggested that "growth
and de-personalization" of uni
versities and especially the lack
of contact between the students,
faculty and administration are
part of the cause for unrest.
Campus dissent is "undoubt
edly both" a product of and
contributor to dissatisfaction in
society, Campbell judged. "A
small group of people are trying
to use the university to disrupt
society," he continued, "But stu
dents have legitimate com
plaints."
Communication Problems
The soft-spoken former Har
vard economist concluded that
many difficulties were "prob
lems of communication."
With shy pride he related how
students had voted him most
popular in his department at
Harvard, and attributed the fav
or to the "general interest" he
took in students.
Campbell's woes began with
attacks on the aims of his
charge, the Hoover Institution
on War, Revolution, and Peace.
His views on California Regents'
decisions, especially concerning

Eldridge Cleaver, have again
brought him into crossfire this
year.
Cleaver Issue
The regent explained the fight
over 139 X, the course in which
Cleaver lectures, saying it is
"no free speech issue, in my
opinion."
"I feel very strongly that the
Eldridge Cleaver matter should
never have come to the Board
of Regents," Campbell continued
firmly, suggesting the course
plans should have been scrutin
ized and modified in customary
channels, including by the chan
cellor.
'Cleaver Not Qualified'
"In my opinion Cleaver is not
qualified" to merit ten lectures,
Campbell quietly asserted. He
termed the black militant "irre
sponsible" and "racist", then
quickly rifled his inside coat
pocket for documentation.
He produced a neatly typed
message from Cleaver's own
book, "Soul On Ice."
"We are a very sick country—
I, perhaps, am sicker than most.
But I accept that. I told you in
the beginning that I am extrem
ist by nature—so it is only right
that I should be extremely sick,"
the quote said.
One lecture would have been
all right, but the course has he
come "much more by than
about" the Black Panther,
Campbell said.
Reagan's Resolution
At its last meeting the Board
of Regents, because of prev
iously determined rules, put off
considering a resolution offered
by Gov. Ronald Reagan concern
ing .Regents' powers and 139 X.
Campbell regretted postpone
ment of the discussion. He said
students seeking credit for the
course could not now be an
swered. Reagan's motion would
"reassure the people of Cali

fornia", Campbell felt, and was
merely a "restatement" of Re
gent's powers.
its function as a center for ad-
Words came more urgently as
the cautious figure defended his
controversial stance.
Supports Heyns
Campbell refuted charges that
he didn't support Berkeley chan
cellor Roger Heyns, "I can't be
too high in praise" of his actions
during the week of trouble, he
said. Heyns responded "firmly
and fairly," Campbell added.
"I'm hopeful the whole mat
ter can be resolved amicably
and with an understanding
spirit," he concluded. The drizzle
of words petered out.
Campbell mused over changes
in the university and in the role
of a university as he stared
through the fog toward Palo
Alto.

Universities and university
personnel are taking a "more
active role" in national prob
lems, he thought, especially in
scientific fields. He hoped the
involvement would "advance the
national interest."
But Campbell termed direct
political action "a catastrophe."
Hoover Institution has been crit
icized as biased toward the right
political wing, and has been
haunted by a strong anti-Com
munist directive from its found
er, Herbert Hoover.
'Promotion Of Peace'
The director, familiar with the
charge, wearily asserted the In
stitution's primary role is "the
promotion of peace," and noted
vanced study and research, open
to all. Campbell said the Insti
tution "does not want to be in
volved" in public controversies.
Since Campbell's appointment,
the Institution has procured 700

archives and now annually at
tracts five times as many visit
ors as it did in 1959.
He continued, "It's only na
tural that an institution tends
to go where the main problems
are," including Communist
China and Africa as such prob
lem subjects.
Political Involvement
Regarding American politics,
the director said that if his staff
became "involved in a major
way," they had to go on leave.
Campbell left Hoover in 1964
to join Barry Goldwater's Presi
dential quest. He related that
Richard Allen, of the Institution
staff had taken a leave of ab
sence to assist Richard Nixon.
Chin in hand Campbell mo
mentarily pondered student in
volvement on and off campus,
but withheld judgment of its
significance.
"It's to early to tell" the ex

tent of change within the uni
versity and in the university's
role, he said.
There should be a balance be
tween academic objectivity and

involvement, Campbell con
cluded. He shifted slightly in
his seat, framed in the gray
view of city and campus, eleven
floors below.

and University of California Re
gent Glenn Campbell curled his
right wrist behind his ear. From
behind half-wire glasses his eyes
lingered briefly on the fog on
the ground below Hoover
Tower's eleventh level.
"I want to go on record as
saying," he stated with carefully
meted firmness, that "students
have legitimate and important
grievance.*."
The words were precisely
measured by a man who has
himself be.?n pestered with con
troversy. Campbell has been
forced to defend the Institution's
role since his arrival in early
1960 and his views as a regent
since his appointment last year.
He suggested that "growth
and de-personalization" of uni
versities and especially the lack
of contact between the students,
faculty and administration are
part of the cause for unrest.
Campus dissent is "undoubt
edly both" a product of and
contributor to dissatisfaction in
society, Campbell judged. "A
small group of people are trying
to use the university to disrupt
society," he continued, "But stu
dents have legitimate com
plaints."
Communication Problems
The soft-spoken former Har
vard economist concluded that
many difficulties were "prob
lems of communication."
With shy pride he related how
students had voted him most
popular in his department at
Harvard, and attributed the fav
or to the "general interest" he
took in students.
Campbell's woes began with
attacks on the aims of his
charge, the Hoover Institution
on War, Revolution, and Peace.
His views on California Regents'
decisions, especially concerning

Eldridge Cleaver, have again
brought him into crossfire this
year.
Cleaver Issue
The regent explained the fight
over 139 X, the course in which
Cleaver lectures, saying it is
"no free speech issue, in my
opinion."
"I feel very strongly that the
Eldridge Cleaver matter should
never have come to the Board
of Regents," Campbell continued
firmly, suggesting the course
plans should have been scrutin
ized and modified in customary
channels, including by the chan
cellor.
'Cleaver Not Qualified'
"In my opinion Cleaver is not
qualified" to merit ten lectures,
Campbell quietly asserted. He
termed the black militant "irre
sponsible" and "racist", then
quickly rifled his inside coat
pocket for documentation.
He produced a neatly typed
message from Cleaver's own
book, "Soul On Ice."
"We are a very sick country—
I, perhaps, am sicker than most.
But I accept that. I told you in
the beginning that I am extrem
ist by nature—so it is only right
that I should be extremely sick,"
the quote said.
One lecture would have been
all right, but the course has he
come "much more by than
about" the Black Panther,
Campbell said.
Reagan's Resolution
At its last meeting the Board
of Regents, because of prev
iously determined rules, put off
considering a resolution offered
by Gov. Ronald Reagan concern
ing .Regents' powers and 139 X.
Campbell regretted postpone
ment of the discussion. He said
students seeking credit for the
course could not now be an
swered. Reagan's motion would
"reassure the people of Cali

fornia", Campbell felt, and was
merely a "restatement" of Re
gent's powers.
its function as a center for ad-
Words came more urgently as
the cautious figure defended his
controversial stance.
Supports Heyns
Campbell refuted charges that
he didn't support Berkeley chan
cellor Roger Heyns, "I can't be
too high in praise" of his actions
during the week of trouble, he
said. Heyns responded "firmly
and fairly," Campbell added.
"I'm hopeful the whole mat
ter can be resolved amicably
and with an understanding
spirit," he concluded. The drizzle
of words petered out.
Campbell mused over changes
in the university and in the role
of a university as he stared
through the fog toward Palo
Alto.

Universities and university
personnel are taking a "more
active role" in national prob
lems, he thought, especially in
scientific fields. He hoped the
involvement would "advance the
national interest."
But Campbell termed direct
political action "a catastrophe."
Hoover Institution has been crit
icized as biased toward the right
political wing, and has been
haunted by a strong anti-Com
munist directive from its found
er, Herbert Hoover.
'Promotion Of Peace'
The director, familiar with the
charge, wearily asserted the In
stitution's primary role is "the
promotion of peace," and noted
vanced study and research, open
to all. Campbell said the Insti
tution "does not want to be in
volved" in public controversies.
Since Campbell's appointment,
the Institution has procured 700

archives and now annually at
tracts five times as many visit
ors as it did in 1959.
He continued, "It's only na
tural that an institution tends
to go where the main problems
are," including Communist
China and Africa as such prob
lem subjects.
Political Involvement
Regarding American politics,
the director said that if his staff
became "involved in a major
way," they had to go on leave.
Campbell left Hoover in 1964
to join Barry Goldwater's Presi
dential quest. He related that
Richard Allen, of the Institution
staff had taken a leave of ab
sence to assist Richard Nixon.
Chin in hand Campbell mo
mentarily pondered student in
volvement on and off campus,
but withheld judgment of its
significance.
"It's to early to tell" the ex

tent of change within the uni
versity and in the university's
role, he said.
There should be a balance be
tween academic objectivity and

involvement, Campbell con
cluded. He shifted slightly in
his seat, framed in the gray
view of city and campus, eleven
floors below.

right wrist behind his ear. From
behind half-wire glasses his eyes
lingered briefly on the fog on
the ground below Hoover
Tower's eleventh level.
"I want to go on record as
saying," he stated with carefully
meted firmness, that "students
have legitimate and important
grievance.*."
The words were precisely
measured by a man who has
himself be.?n pestered with con
troversy. Campbell has been
forced to defend the Institution's
role since his arrival in early
1960 and his views as a regent
since his appointment last year.
He suggested that "growth
and de-personalization" of uni
versities and especially the lack
of contact between the students,
faculty and administration are
part of the cause for unrest.
Campus dissent is "undoubt
edly both" a product of and
contributor to dissatisfaction in
society, Campbell judged. "A
small group of people are trying
to use the university to disrupt
society," he continued, "But stu
dents have legitimate com
plaints."
Communication Problems
The soft-spoken former Har
vard economist concluded that
many difficulties were "prob
lems of communication."
With shy pride he related how
students had voted him most
popular in his department at
Harvard, and attributed the fav
or to the "general interest" he
took in students.
Campbell's woes began with
attacks on the aims of his
charge, the Hoover Institution
on War, Revolution, and Peace.
His views on California Regents'
decisions, especially concerning

Eldridge Cleaver, have again
brought him into crossfire this
year.
Cleaver Issue
The regent explained the fight
over 139 X, the course in which
Cleaver lectures, saying it is
"no free speech issue, in my
opinion."
"I feel very strongly that the
Eldridge Cleaver matter should
never have come to the Board
of Regents," Campbell continued
firmly, suggesting the course
plans should have been scrutin
ized and modified in customary
channels, including by the chan
cellor.
'Cleaver Not Qualified'
"In my opinion Cleaver is not
qualified" to merit ten lectures,
Campbell quietly asserted. He
termed the black militant "irre
sponsible" and "racist", then
quickly rifled his inside coat
pocket for documentation.
He produced a neatly typed
message from Cleaver's own
book, "Soul On Ice."
"We are a very sick country—
I, perhaps, am sicker than most.
But I accept that. I told you in
the beginning that I am extrem
ist by nature—so it is only right
that I should be extremely sick,"
the quote said.
One lecture would have been
all right, but the course has he
come "much more by than
about" the Black Panther,
Campbell said.
Reagan's Resolution
At its last meeting the Board
of Regents, because of prev
iously determined rules, put off
considering a resolution offered
by Gov. Ronald Reagan concern
ing .Regents' powers and 139 X.
Campbell regretted postpone
ment of the discussion. He said
students seeking credit for the
course could not now be an
swered. Reagan's motion would
"reassure the people of Cali

fornia", Campbell felt, and was
merely a "restatement" of Re
gent's powers.
its function as a center for ad-
Words came more urgently as
the cautious figure defended his
controversial stance.
Supports Heyns
Campbell refuted charges that
he didn't support Berkeley chan
cellor Roger Heyns, "I can't be
too high in praise" of his actions
during the week of trouble, he
said. Heyns responded "firmly
and fairly," Campbell added.
"I'm hopeful the whole mat
ter can be resolved amicably
and with an understanding
spirit," he concluded. The drizzle
of words petered out.
Campbell mused over changes
in the university and in the role
of a university as he stared
through the fog toward Palo
Alto.

Universities and university
personnel are taking a "more
active role" in national prob
lems, he thought, especially in
scientific fields. He hoped the
involvement would "advance the
national interest."
But Campbell termed direct
political action "a catastrophe."
Hoover Institution has been crit
icized as biased toward the right
political wing, and has been
haunted by a strong anti-Com
munist directive from its found
er, Herbert Hoover.
'Promotion Of Peace'
The director, familiar with the
charge, wearily asserted the In
stitution's primary role is "the
promotion of peace," and noted
vanced study and research, open
to all. Campbell said the Insti
tution "does not want to be in
volved" in public controversies.
Since Campbell's appointment,
the Institution has procured 700

archives and now annually at
tracts five times as many visit
ors as it did in 1959.
He continued, "It's only na
tural that an institution tends
to go where the main problems
are," including Communist
China and Africa as such prob
lem subjects.
Political Involvement
Regarding American politics,
the director said that if his staff
became "involved in a major
way," they had to go on leave.
Campbell left Hoover in 1964
to join Barry Goldwater's Presi
dential quest. He related that
Richard Allen, of the Institution
staff had taken a leave of ab
sence to assist Richard Nixon.
Chin in hand Campbell mo
mentarily pondered student in
volvement on and off campus,
but withheld judgment of its
significance.
"It's to early to tell" the ex

tent of change within the uni
versity and in the university's
role, he said.
There should be a balance be
tween academic objectivity and

involvement, Campbell con
cluded. He shifted slightly in
his seat, framed in the gray
view of city and campus, eleven
floors below.
