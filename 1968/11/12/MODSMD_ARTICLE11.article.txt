MOM ASKS ROBERT McAFEE
BROWN: "IS JACKIE A PUBLIC
SINNER?"
By CISSIE BONIM
MOM: "Dr. Brown, the Vatican City
magazine L'Osservatore Delia Domen
ica, recently condemned Jacqueline
Kennedy as a "public sinner in a state
of spiritual degradation." What are
your views on this?
DR. BROWN: "Nixon took a Greek
running-mate. Why not Jackie? I stand
four-squarely behind my own spiritual
advisor, Richard Cardinal Cushing, who
said she should be allowed to marry
anyone she pleases. Although, even I
wouldn't want my daughter to marry a
Greek billionaire."
MOM: "The Vatican paper said that
when a Catholic who is free to marry

weds a non-Catholic who is not in con
dition to do so, the Catholic Church re
gards the marriage as non-existent."
What, in theological terms constitutes
not in a condition to marry?"
DR. BROWN: "I consider having a
wife a formidable barrier to marrying.
Of course, that's speaking from a
strictly traditionalist point of view.
The barriers to marriage increase
in geometrical proportion after the age
of seventy. Since theologians always
have three reasons, I'll keep searching
for a third and conclusive one.
Lack of love could constitute the
third barrier. But that's speaking from
a strictly modernist liberal point of
view."
MOM: "Isn't including love in mar
riage a bit radical?"
DR. BROWN: "Well, yes ... , but it's

a romantic type of radicalism as op
posed to the stern grim type. There
was a time in Church history when the
vow of celibacy was considered a bar
rier to marriage. It's hard to say that
in other than the past conditional mood
anymore.
I would like to say that—under all
these barriers—it seems unlikely that
Cardinal Cushing will marry on his re
tirement. I offer him as someone who
takes these barriers seriously and deals
with them on his own terms. Orie can
not, however, make a confirmative pre
diction here."
MOM: "Dr. Brown, an article in the
September "Christianity and Crisis"
deals with the future discovery (in
1984) of Pope Paul's private diary. This

document reveals that Pope Paul not
only anticipated the storm of protest
on his birth-control encyclical, Hu
nmnae Vitae, but that he deliberately
provoked the violent criticism as an
ecumenical gesture to lay to rest Pro
testant fears about papal power.
He planned on the "benevolent dis
regard" of the faithful to indicate to
the "separated brethern" that they
needn't obey the Papal teaching power
if they return to the <:'old. According
to a recent study by some computer
linguistics experts, this article is in
your writing style and your humor."
DR. BROWN: "Yes, I'm predisposed
to believe in my own authorship. But
all of these questions are peripheral to
the real issue gripping theologians to
day: "Can a Democrat have an I-Thou
relationship with Richard Nixon?"

MOM: "Isn't including love in mar
riage a bit radical?"
DR. BROWN: "Well, yes ... , but it's

a romantic type of radicalism as op
posed to the stern grim type. There
was a time in Church history when the
vow of celibacy was considered a bar
rier to marriage. It's hard to say that

I would like to say that—under all
these barriers—it seems unlikely that

BROWN: "IS JACKIE A PUBLIC
SINNER?"
By CISSIE BONIM
MOM: "Dr. Brown, the Vatican City
magazine L'Osservatore Delia Domen
ica, recently condemned Jacqueline
Kennedy as a "public sinner in a state
of spiritual degradation." What are
your views on this?
DR. BROWN: "Nixon took a Greek
running-mate. Why not Jackie? I stand
four-squarely behind my own spiritual
advisor, Richard Cardinal Cushing, who
said she should be allowed to marry
anyone she pleases. Although, even I
wouldn't want my daughter to marry a
Greek billionaire."
MOM: "The Vatican paper said that
when a Catholic who is free to marry

weds a non-Catholic who is not in con
dition to do so, the Catholic Church re
gards the marriage as non-existent."
What, in theological terms constitutes
not in a condition to marry?"
DR. BROWN: "I consider having a
wife a formidable barrier to marrying.
Of course, that's speaking from a
strictly traditionalist point of view.
The barriers to marriage increase
in geometrical proportion after the age
of seventy. Since theologians always
have three reasons, I'll keep searching
for a third and conclusive one.
