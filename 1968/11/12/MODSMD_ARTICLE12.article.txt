## Cook County's Supervoters 
### ART BUCHWALD 
There are a lot of post-mor
tems going on now as to why
Vice President Hubert Hum
phrey lost the election. I have
been conducting one myself, and
the conclusion I have come to is
that the one person responsible
for Humphrey's defeat was May
or Richard Daley of Chicago.
To understand what hap
pened, you have to have some
background on Cook County
politics. The Democratic people
of Cook County are among the
most patriotic in the country.
Some of them not only vote
once, but twice and three times
if they're interested in the elec
tion. Tradition has it in Cook
County that even after you die
you still don't lose your right
to vote.
Every election year, ballot
boxes are prepared for different
precincts in Cook County. Then,
depending on how many votes
the Democrats need in Illinois

to win, the boxes are sent in.
Some years very few boxes are
needed. Other years the machine
needs every one they can get.
This year, everything was in
readiness for the presidential
election. The ballot boxes were
stuffed to the brim, and it was
just a question of getting the
word from Mayor Daley when
they should be released.
But something happened this
presidential election year to
Mayor Daley, as we shall see.
At about 11 p.m., election
night, a Cook County precinct
captain called in to City Hall to
find out when he could start re
leasing the ballot boxes.
"We're not releasing any this
year," the man on the other end
of the phone said.
"Are you crazy?" the precinct
captain yelled. "Humphrey could
lose Illinois."
"The mayor says that he will
not tolerate any skullduggery in
Cook County voting."
"You got to be kidding," the
precinct captain said. "I have

three cemeteries still waiting to
vote."
The man on the other end of
the line said, "I know it's hard
to understand, but something
happened to the mayor at the
Democratic convention. He be
came the symbol of law and or
der to millions and millions of
Americans, and he doesn't want
to hurt that image."
"But what about Cook Coun
ty's image?" the precinct cap
tain cried. "We've been able to
deliver the vote here for 50
years. If Cook County can't con
trol Illinois, the election will be
up for grabs."
"The mayor told me to tell
you that if he hears of one false
ballot being cast this year, he'll
send the police into your pre
cinct and break every car win
dow in the neighborhood."
"I can't believe it. We've
worked day and night on these
ballot boxes. We registered peo
ple who moved away from Chi
cago 20 years ago. We've had
people voting who haven't been
born yet. Don't tell us all our

work has, been for naught. What
are we supposed to do with all
the boxes?"
"The mayor doesn't care. He
told me to tell you that if he
can't win honestly in Cook
County, he doesn't want to win
at all."
"Even if it means losing the
Presidency of the United
States?"
"I asked him that and he said,
'What is a man profited if he
shall gain the election but lose
his own soul?"'
"I got to hear it from him,"
tht? precinct man said unbeliev
ingly.
"You can't. He's out in Grant
P.irk planting chrysanthemums
that the Yippies tore up in Aug
ust."
The next morning, as the sun
came up over the Conrad Hilton
hotel, ballot boxes were being
burned in every part of Cook
County, and with them, going
up in smoke, went Hubert Ho
ration Humphrey's chances of
becoming the 37th President of
the United States.
