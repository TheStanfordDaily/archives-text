We, graduate students in the
Department of Biology, support
the demands of the teaching
assistants in the Department of
Political Science.
Although Biology graduate
students earn more than Politi
cal Science teaching assistants,
we can well understand their
problems in supporting them
selves and their families on
$2,300 per year. We look for
ward to the day when aU grad
uate students, in all depart ments
of the University, will earn at
least $3,000 per year, and, fur
thermore, we urge that the
added expense of supporting a
family be recognized and com
pensated.
Thus, we await the outcome
of the current negotiations with
great interest.

Editor, The Daily:
Candles flickered proudly,
moving together—a beautiful
unity. Singing softly, we march
ed to Palo Alto. Stopping finally,
we were moved by the quiet
courage of those who turned in
their draft cards. Dignity per
vaded the night air. . . .
But the march then broke up.
The unity was shattered. Ob
scene passions flowed in the
streets. Some initiated it, some
joined in, some watched—we
left. It was not the time or the
