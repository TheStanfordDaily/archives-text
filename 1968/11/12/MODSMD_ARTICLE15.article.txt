## 'Job Fair' Successful 
### RHEA RAIHALA 
A man in a turtleneck sweater
sat behind the long table. A mid
dle-aged Negro woman in a
checkered suit approached hesi
tantly and sat down before him
in one of the folding chairs.
"What kind of a job are you
looking for?" the young man
asked.
"What kind do you have?" she
countered.
"We have lots of clerical posi
tions," he replied.
"They don't pay very well, do
they?" the woman asked warily.
The young man grinned. "We
have some that pay $400 per
month," he said.
The woman's face broke into a
smile. "Those are the one's I'm
looking for," she said, reaching
for an application form.
The scene was the East Palo
Alto Adult Job Fair, held Satur
day at Ravenswood High School
in the heart of EPA. The young
man was Mike Ravizza, an em
ployment representative was
manning the Stanford booth.
Job Fair Organization
The idea of a Job Fair to bring
together Peninsula employers
with potential minority group
employees was the brain child
of Herb Rhodes, Co-Chairman of
the Job Fair, who is another
Stanford employment represen
tative. Rhodes, a Negro, and
Ravizza, a white, form a team
which is responsible for minori
ty group employment on the
Stanford campus.
"The aim of the Job Fair was
to assist members of minority
groups who were unemployed or
felt qualified for better jobs than
they held," Rhodes said. Partici
pating employers included some
30 Peninsula firms and govern
ment agencies which "had jobs
to offer, not just promises."
In total, over 620 applicants
were either offered jobs at the
Fair or signed up for further
interviewing and testing. "May
be only 5 per cent get jobs on
the spot," said Bob Hardaway of
Philco-Ford, Co-Program Chair
man of the Fair, "but all the

companies who ask applicants
to come in for further inter
views are sincerely interested in
them as prospective employees."
The tone of the fair was frank
and informal. Eight hostesses
greeted the applicants as they
entered Ravenwood's multi-pur
pose room and had each one fill
out a registration card.
Casual Chats
The applicants, who arrived in
everything from blue jeans to
suits, were then free to stroll
among the 26 curtained booths
to look at posters, pick up free
job-opportunity literature, and
chat with company representa
tives.
The company personnel, most
of whom had also broken away
from the coat-and-tie syndrome,
sat in sweaters or shirt sleeves
listening attentively to the ap
plicants questions and then ask
ing a few of their own.
Carefully briefed by the Job
Fair Steering Committee that
honesty was the best policy,
company representatives pulled
no punches. This approach drew
equal frankness from the appli
cants.
"How much schooling have
you had?" a representative
asked a Negro youth.
"Well, I finished high school,"
he replied.
"Got your diploma? Great. It
opens a lot of doors nowadays,"
the representative said, handing
the young man a form to fill out.
Inter-racial Teamwork
Nearly every participating
firm had both black and white
representatives in its booth, evi
dence of the inter-racial team
work that has permeated the en
tire Job Fair effort, from its ear
liest planning stages last Aug
ust. Co-chairmen of the Fair
along with Rhodes were Henry
P. Organ, a Negro, and Bruce
Hinchliffe who is white.
The Fair was an outgrowth of
a similar effort last April that
aimed at finding summer jobs
for minority group high school
students, as well as positions for

adults. The April fair was ex
tremely successful, resulting ifl
some 800 to 1,100 job openings
in both participating and non
participating firms.
The impressive April Job Fair
statistics encouraged participa
tion in the November Fair, ac
cording to Co-chairman Hinch
liffe. "At first people questioned
the Job Fair concept," Hinch
liffe said. "White businessmen
especially didn't know if there
would be enough community in
terest to make it worthwhile.
I'm no 'ghetto-ologist,' but I'm
impressed with how the black
community has trust in each
other. Community interest seems
to be built-in. We've had good
turnout for both Fairs."
The general satisfaction with
the past two Fairs has led to
plans for another student-adult
Job Fair, tentatively scheduled
for the spring of 1969.
