# Police, Fire Stations Move
## 
### 
"We've discussed this thing
for 25 years so I wouldn't bet
on it yet," said Fire Chief John
Marston before he moved into
the new Stanford fire and police
building at 711 Sena Street. But
his fears were unfounded.
The 14 students and 40 regu
lar members of the Fire Depart
ment and twenty-nine members
of the Police Department moved
into their new headquarters Oc
tober 15.
Police Chief Tom Bell said,
'The Fire and Police Depart
ments will be housed together
for economy. Although both are
public safety operations, they
are two separate jobs."
The new station boasts wood
paneling, piped-in music, a
stand-by power generator, a sun
deck, and a dishwasher with a
three-and-one-hali-minute cycle.
This stands in contrast to the
oJd stations, which were handi

capped by a lack of space for
men and equipment.
PoKw Added
The Fire Department will
gain two twenty-four-foot poles,
which men slide down using
only their legs, a hose drying
machine, and dormitories for
students and men.
Behind the Fire Department
is a forty-five foot training
tower, built to simulate a high
building. According to Assistant
Fire Chief Harold Lund, men
will be trained to use ropes and
ladders on the tower while pro
tected below by a life net. The
tower also includes a room
where men can learn to extin
guish practice fires.
Chief Marston's only worry
about the new station is that his
eight pieces of major equipment
may look lost in the large ga
rage.
1904 Construction
The present fire station was
built in 1904 and originally was

located on Salvatierra Street. It
was later moved so artisans
working in the square behind
the present station could help
with alarms.
The department began using
students during the depression
to help them earn their way
through Stanford.
Today the fourteen students
at the fire station receive their
room free and $100 a month.
These students must complete
a 120-hour training program in
three weeks and be prepared to
leave class at any time should
a fire alarm be set off at any
one of the 152 alarm boxes on
campus.
They must also be skilled in
first aid as one-fourth of the

department's 7(XI yearly calls
are for first aid.
Expanded Facilities
In the new building the Po
lice Department has the ad
vantages of added parking, lock
er rooms, an interrogation room,
and a dark room.
Basically set up to receive
calls but also to practice pre
ventive security, the Police De
partment strives to "protect life
and property."
Policemen issue about 22,500
parking tickets yearly.
The old police building will
become an office for engineering
professors while the fire station
is being considered for a pizza
parlor, according to Chiefs Bell
and Marston.


NEW STATION — The Stanford Police and Fire departments have
just moved into new quarters with such luxuries as a sun-deck
piped-in music, two shiny new pol<»s, and a training tower whert
Stanford students learn to be firemen.
