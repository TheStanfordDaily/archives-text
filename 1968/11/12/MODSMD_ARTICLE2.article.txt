# Students Help Select Pitzer's Successor

(Reprinted In part from Till
RICE THRESHER)
The successor to Kenneth Pi
zer at Rice is being selected with
the aid of a student-faculty
search committee. The selection
of Pitzer as Stanford's president
drew fire earlier this year be
cause students were not in
volved in the selection process.
Student body president Denis
Hayes and Daily editor Dan
Snell were among those critical
of the manner of selection of
the new president.
A nine-member committee,
composed of six faculty, two
undergraduates, and one grad
uate student, will be formed
to "assist and advise" the Rice
Board of Governors in the
search for a new president of
the University, Rice Dean of
Undergraduate Affairs Michael
McEnany announced recently.
The student members of the
committee will be consultants,
and thus will not have voting
privileges. However, McEnany
doubted that actual votes would
play a large role in the advisory
committee's operations. He said
he felt the committee would be
mainly concerned with discuss
ing candidates and the issues

involved with them, and making
recommendations to the Board.
Neither the students nor the
faculty members of the com
mittee will actually have a vote
on the final selection of a can
didate, which will be made by
a committee of the Board of
Governors.
A plan has been adopted
whereby the two undergraduate
representatives on the commit
tee will be selected by a group
of eleven students from among
their own number. Four of the
eleven will be selected by the
Student Association, and one
representative will be chosen
from each college.
Hayes indicated during the
summer that he would call a
student referendum on Pitzer's
selection. However, he changed
hit; mind shortly before the be
ginning of school. In a speech
to I he freshmen during prereg
istration Hayes said "You can
not destroy the university in or
der to save it."
His change of mind, Hayes
said, was not due to a change
in feeling about the impropriety
of Pi . v zer's selection. Rather, it
was prompted by a feeling that
to hold a referendum would only
serve to increase tension on

campus and possibly provoke
"another Columbia."
Stanford Trustee President W.
Parmer Fuller has indicated that
he strongly believes students
will be included in the next sel
ection of a Stanford president.
Late last week the University
Administration announced that
the new director of admissions
would be selected by a student
faculty committee.
