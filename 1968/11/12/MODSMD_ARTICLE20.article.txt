## Shirley's Demise 
### HELEN SHANNON 
Nineteen sixty-eight will go
down as the year of political sur
prises. But even last year's Con
gressional election in San Mateo
County, which presaged many
of this year's events, held a ma
jor surprise: Paul N. "Pete" Mc-
Closkey, "small town lawyer
from Portola Valley" beat Shir
ley Temple Black, former child
movie star.
The story of the election Is
told in The Sinking of the Lolli
pop, by Rodney G. Minott. The
book is not an unbiased account.
The author gives us a devastat
ing portrait of Mrs. Black, while
he speaks of McCloskey in he
roic terms. It is not until we al
most finish the book that Mr.
Minott tells us that he was a
volunteer for Pete McCloskey.
Much of what we have learned
about this year's election from
the San Mateo race can only be
seen in retrospect. It would have
been nearly impossible to have
predicted national consequences
from a Congressional election.
Democrat Support
Patterns of voting changed.
Many people voted for the man,
instead of the party. Thousands
of Democrats, crossing party
lines, chose McCloskey, a Repub
lican, for their candidate.

Although, in California, a po
litical party can not endorse a
candidate in a primary, Shirley
Temple Black was the darling
of Republican leaders. Well be
fore the election she received a
high state post from Governor
Reagan and visited both Wash
ington and Sacramento. And yet
McCloskey, who had on several
occasions antagonized the state
party, won in the four-man Re
publican race. And besides that,
he was running as a liberal Re
publican in an area called "the
Orange County of the North."
But why did Shirley, who was
the nation-wide, odds-on choice,
lose? One explanation dealt with
that elusive quality "image."
McCloskey's was m u c h better
than Mrs. Black's. Thousands of
people remembered Shirley Tem
ple as a fair-haired, charming,
unspoiled little girl. But now, in
her late thirties, she appeared as
a black-haired, once-divorced, so
ciety matron.
McCloskey's Appeal
McCloskey had no such con
flict. He seemed to have that in
tegrity and rugged independence
that Americans still admire. Mc-
Closkey's campaign managers
relied heavily on the mass media
to display this image, illustrating

their increasing importance in
our nation's polities.
Perhaps what cost Mrs. Black
the election was her own politi
cal ineptitude. She faced the is
sues (when she confronted,
them i with simplistic, almost!
naive statements. Rioting blacks
were compared to a child throw- i
ing a temper tantrum. She sug
gested that we had not yet begun
to bomb North Vietnam.
'Forgotten' Man
Pete McCloskey, on the other
hand, showed his mature con
cern in his broad platform that
appealed to conservationists,
peace advocates, blacks, Demo
crats, Republicans and indepen
dents. Even with such a breadth
of ideas, McCloskey's appeal is
still somewhat limited to the ty
pical San Matean, a member of
the suburban middle-class.
One of the interesting phe
nomena was the active participa
tion of this political animal, the
"forgotten man", in the political
game. Thousands of suburban
ites walked precincts for McClos
key, the kind of work that had
been long successful in large cit
ies where it could be done by
political machines.
So, in 1967, did two political
neophytes run for the San Ma
teo County Crogressional seat.
Pete McCloskey is now in Wash
ington. Shirley Temple Black is
back in Woodside, presumably
salvaging the Good Ship Lolli
pop, which, according to Mrs.
Black in a statement approach
ing petulance, will soon set sail
again.
