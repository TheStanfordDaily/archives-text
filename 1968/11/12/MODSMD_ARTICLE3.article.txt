# Visiting Restrictions Waived At Columbia
## 
### 
Columbia College has ended
all restrictions on dormitory vis
iting hours.
"There is after all nothing
people can do at one time that
they cannot do at another,"
Columbia Dean Carl Hovde said
following a decision by a student
group that controls dormitory
regulations.
"It is in my opinion alto
gether unlikely that alterations
in visiting hours will have any
effect on sexual behavior,"
Hovde noted.
Current Stanford regulations
are roughly equivalent to the
Columbia women's visiting
hours before the recent change.
Previously, Columbia's visiting
hours for women in the dorms
of the all-men college were 5 to
10 p.m. Monday through Thurs
day, 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. Fridays,
noon to 2 a.m. Saturdays and
noon to ten p.m. Sundays.
This ruling, an example of the
new authority of the Undergrad
uate Dormitory Council at Col
umbia, makes it the first Ivy-
League College with no restric
tions on women's visiting hours.
A ruling barring unescorted
women above the main floor of
the dormitories was also passed.
Hovde delegated the responsi
bility for rule-making and en

forcement of rules to the coun
cil after discussions with the
officers of the council. The dean
does, however, retain the power
of veto over the council's de
cisions, but could not forsee
using it.
