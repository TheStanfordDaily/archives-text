United Nations today to seat
Red China as the lawful repre

comfort to a bogus regime."

Cambodian Ambassador Huot
Sambath called on the 125-na

to an end "the injustice perpe
trated by the U.S. government
against the Chinese people."
As soon as Nationalist Chi

have predicted that the resolu
tion to seat Red China will suf
