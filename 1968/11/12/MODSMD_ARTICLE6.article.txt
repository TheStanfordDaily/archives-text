# S.F. State Resumes Classes After Veterans' Day 'Break'
## 
### 
Classes reopen today at San
Francisco State College after the
three day Veterans' Day Holiday
lull. In the wake of last week's
disruptions the situation ap
pears as volatile as ever.
A group of faculty members
which said it represented about
10 per cent of the college's 1,000
instructors threatened to strike
Wednesday unless Black Pan
ther George Murray was rein
stated to the faculty.
Last week a student strike,
brought police on campus to
halt sporadic violence and van
dalism, which protested against
Murray's suspension and de
manded upgrading of the Black
Studies Department.
Murray's suspension was or
dered by State College Chan
cellor Glenn Dumke after a
speech in which the black milit
ant allegedly urged Negro stu
dents to arm themselves with
guns while on campus.
Opposes Intervention
College President Robert
Smith opposed the intervention
by Dumke but eventually fol
lowed the order and suspended

Murray as a graduate student
and a faculty member.
Friday night 35 faculty mem
bers stated that if the admini
stration takes action to suspend
the Black Student Union and
other militant organizations be
cause they are found to have
instigated the violence this
week, more serious disruptions
are likely to occur.
Classes were cancelled Wed
nesday after the original dis
ruption and sporadic troubles
continued Thursday and Friday
as police arrested five persons.
Over the weekend the student

strike spread to the football
team as 14 varsity and 13 fresh
man players refused to partici
pate in sports over the week
end. Only 200 fans showed for
the game, the smallest crowd
to see a San Francisco State
contest in two decades.
Only one Negro player defied
the boycott and played in State's
non-conference victory Saturday
over Southern Oregon. The
other players were in the stands
as Gloria Tzua, a black student
from Marin City, Calif., was
honored as the 1968 homecom
ing queen.
