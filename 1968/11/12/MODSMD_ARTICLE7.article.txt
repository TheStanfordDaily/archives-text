## Cal Pair Continues Protest 
### CRAIG WILSON 
BERKELEY —A Sunday after
noon at Berkeley is something
to behold—bongos banging, foot
balls flying, endless numbers of
students walking, sitting, talk
ing everywhere. Things more
quiet than usual—but quiet as
they ever get here.
Yet there was considerably
less tension there this weekend
than just a week or two ago.
Now it's almost as if everything
has been forgotten.
A stroll across the plaza out
side the student center is an ex
perience in itself. Students still
speak of things "blowing up,"—
but references are always to
"they"- and of the university
collapsing if these forces are un
leashed.
No one seems to know who
"they" are. But it makes for
great conversation.
There is something particu
larly different about a lazy Sun
day afternoon—a university
without classes, students with
out schedules, buildings with no
reason. It is as if all else is for
gotten and students catch up on
being alive. Or so it seems.
But two Cal students have
been on a 15-day fast, and some
how all the pleasantry of a Sun
day afternoon is lost to them.
The fast began as a protest

against what they said was the
lack of faculty autonomy, aca
demic freedom, and student par
ticipation in their own educa
tion.
If results have been insignifi
cant in terms of response from
those to whom the appeal is di
rected, Konstantin Berlandt, edi
tor of the Daily Californian, and
Charles Palmer, president of
(ASUC) can testify that they
themselves have been respond
ing.
Berlandt, in his characteristic
ally giddy manner, confesses
"my mind is slowing down. I
am frustrated, depressed, hun
gry, and I get angry a lot."
Somehow one gets the feeling he
is being funny, or at least in
some strange way enjoying it
all.
But he has lost 11 pounds -
he now weighs 123- and drinks
only fruit juices, along with
vitamin pills and doses of salt,
and well, things could be fun
nier.
Palmer, in a serious manner,
complains of an inahility to con
centrate. He has lost 15 pounds
thus far. He was overweight to
begin with, but fasting is a
strange way to di°t.
The pair isn't completely
alone. Support seems wide
spread. Several students have

joined in the fast, including 19
girls from one of the campus
living groups who began a five
day fast.
Messages from various cam
puses including Stanford have
voiced support for what Ber
landt and Palmer call the stu
dents feeling of being "disen
franchised and impotent."
Berlandt and Palmer meet
with students each day for two
hours and exchange thoughts on
anything they wish to speak
about.
They are seeing a physician
daily who takes blood pressure
and looks for any signs of ab
nomality—but at this point ab
normality is a pretty relative
thing.
Neither of the two have any
vague notion of when they will
end the fast—although sooner or
later they won't have to decide.
Said Berlandt, "We are look
ing for some response in the
system. If it does not react we
will be forced to either drop out
or violence. This is what we are
seeking to find out. That is our
end."
There has been no reaction so
far, and nothing concrete seems
to be in the offing.
A Sunday afternoon in Berke
ley is a pleasant experience, but
apparently not all is forgotten.
