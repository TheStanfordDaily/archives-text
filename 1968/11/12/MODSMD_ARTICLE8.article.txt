# TA's Threaten Strike Over Salary Demands
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
A strike by teaching assis
tants (TA's) that would immo
bilize the University is "highly
likely" if a compromise is not
reached on TA demands for
salary raises, TA leaders said
yesterday.
Counterproposals by adminis
trators to recent TA demands
for immediate salary boosts
were flatly rejected by graduate
student representatives from the
political science, anthropology,
and English departments.
Eleven TA's from the three
departments met with Univers
ity officials yesterday afternoon
to discuss demands made Oct.
24 by political science TA's.
In response to TA demands
for an immediate pay increase
from $2,300 to $3,000 per year
plus an additional $300 per de
pendent, Vice Provost E. How
ard put forth a proposal that
would increase salaries for all

University TA's by $400 for the
1969-70 academic year.
Brooks' counterproposal also
allowed for the institution of "a
small emergency fund of grants
in-aid that would be awarded
by demonstration of need to
married TA's with children."
Reductions Elsewhere
Brooks' proposed across the
board increase, "more than was
originally intended" for next
year, will cost $160,000 annually
and "result in some reductions
in other academic priorities," he
said.
But Brooks added that there
would be no added funds to fi
nance TA salary increases for
this academic year.
Political science representa
tive Richard Young told Brooks
and several other administrators
present at the meeting that the
counterproposals were unreal
istic, not serious, and showed
that the administrators were
"completely unwilling to com
promise."
Young claimed that the Ad
ministration "hasn't walked one
step toward meeting our de
mands."
Confrontation Sought?
Both groups agreed at the last
TA-Administration meeting that
there was an immediate need to
bring TA salaries up to a living
wage, Young stated. He cited
this as evidence that the propos
al of a $400 increase was an at
tempt on the part of the Admin
istration to provoke a confron
tation.
Young made it clear that his
group and the other depart
mental organizations that have
endorsed their demands would
be willing to compromise with
"reasonable" proposals on the
part of University officials.
But he added "we can make
no compromise until they make
a reasonable proposal. They

have offered nothing for this
year."
"It will cost you more to deal
with confrontation than with
compromise," Young told
Brooks.
Another Meeting
He and Brooks agreed to meet
again by Nov. 22, by which time
administrators will have put
together a new salary proposal.
Young added after the meet
ing that "the Administration re
gards us as objects rather than
persons. We are talking about
concrete financial problems that
the Administration agrees ex
ists," but refuses to deal with.
Earlier, Young spelled out for
Brooks, Graduate Dean Virgil
Whitaker, Acting Humanities
and Sciences Dean Halsey Roy
den, and Assistant Provost Ray
mond Bacchetti what he thought
a TA strike would mean to the
University.
Young called the likelihood of
a strike "extremely high" if the
demands were not met by Nov.
30, a negotiations deadline that
Young previously set.
"We're not planning to sit-in,
we plan to walk out," he said.
"You need us more than we need
you. We are talking about hu
man beings, performing a ser
vice; as humans, we need a liv
ing wage."
Young said that "at least"
1,000 undergraduate students
would be effected by a TA
walkout, causing a "major dis
ruption" in classroom activities.
He stated that many students
would demand refunds for un
completed classes.
A Costly Strike
Young added that a continued
TA strike would necessitate the
hiring of a large, highly-paid
staff to do the work previously
done by graduate students. He
claimed that this step would cer
tainly be more costly than grant
ing current demands for salary
hikes.
Young later hinted that more
than 100 TA's are presently
firmly committed to a strike if
a settlement is not reached. He
said that many others from oth
er departments would join the
strike "out of sympathy" on an
individual basis.
The possibility of a shutdown
of the University cannot be dis
counted, Young asserted. He
said that yesterday's proposal on
the part of the Administration
"forces" him to apply to local
AFL-CIO headquarters for sanc
tions in the event of a strike. If
sanction is granted, no union em
ployees, many of whom perform
supply services for Stanford,
would be allowed to cross picket
lines.
Frank Cady, spokesman for
English department TA's, said
his colleagues were "fairly
angry" about their stipends. A
survey of 30 of the 55 TA's in
the department showed a me
dian work load of 25 hours per
week and an average indebted
ness of $1300, ranging from $200
to $8,000.
Shirley Anderson, TA in an
thropology, said only six of 14
quarters of TA work in her de
partment were paid, with the
rest handled without compensa
tion by those on fellowships.
Young pointed out that there are
"fantastic variations" in the
work load and effective compen
sation of teaching assistants.
Brooks and Bachetti agreed
that this "deserves serious
study" by the faculty Senate.
