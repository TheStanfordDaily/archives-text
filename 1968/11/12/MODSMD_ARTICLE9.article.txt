## The 						Black Death In Bio-War 
### JOSHUA LEDERBERG 
In mid-14th century, the Cri
mean seaport of Caffa (now
called Feodosia) was an import
ant fortified outpost of Genoese
traders. For the previous 50
years, Genoa had been in inter
mittent conflict with Venice and
with factions of the Mongol
Golden Horde.
In the year 1346, Caffa was
again besieged by the Mongols.
During this same time, a vast
epidemic of bubonic plague had
rapidly spread through the Mon
gol empire.
In the words of Gabriel de
Mussis, a contemporary chron

icier, "The Tartars, fatigued by
such a plague and pestiferous
disease, stupified and amazed,
observing themselves dying
without hope of health ordered
cadavers placed on their cata
pults and thrown into the city
of Caffa, so that by means of
these intolerable passengers the
defenders died widely."
After this bacteriological at
tack, the survivors abandoned
the city and returned to Genoa
as best they could. By 1348, the
Black Death had devastated
Europe.
Dr. V. J. Derbes of Tulane
Medical School, writing in the

Journal of the American Medi
cal Association (April 4, 1966),
pointed out that the plague
would undoubtedly have reached
Europe by trade routes, regard
less of this incident.
The Black Death raged across
Europe for the next two years
and burned itself out only after
killing at least a fourth of the
population.
As the epidemic became more
intense, an increasing propor
tion of the cases were of the so
called pneumonic form, spread
directly from the infected lungs
of one victim via airborne drop
lets inhaled by the next—essen
tially like the common cold or
the more usual forms of tuber
culosis.
Plague is still with us. It is
usually associated with tropical,
rat-infested environments, and
indeed it was again killing a mil
lion people a year, mostly in In
dia, at the time of World War I.
Since World War 11, vigorous
rat-eradication programs have
succeeded in holding plague
deaths down to a few hundred.
The disease has, however,
gradually spread to native, wild
rodents throughout the world,
where it smolders, only to break
out in an isolated case or small
epidemic of "sylvatic" or forest
living plague. The deprivations
of war, as in Viet Nam, also
foster new outbreaks of plague.
As far as we know, these out
breaks are caused by the same
bacillus that spread the Black
Death. However, the organism
does show considerable varia
tion under laboratory conditions.
An epidemic of the Black
Death may have reflected the
evolution of some especially vir
ulent and contagious form of the
bacillus. Fortunately, streptomy
cin and a few other antibiotics
are remarkably effective.
Nevertheless, human ingenu
ity is quite capable of wasting
the good fortune of the human
species. Mutant strains of the
bacillus that are indifferent to

antibiotic therapy are easily cul
tured. The potential of plague
for biological warfare is obvious
in the light of the historic pre
cedents.
Any intelligent program of
BW research, especially if its
main mission were "defensive,"
would have to develop such ag
gressive, drug-resistant bacilli
in order to evaluate them as a
military threat.
BW research must also be
concerned with the factors that
encourage the airborne spread
of pneumonic plague. Basic
knowledge of such phenomena
cannot be denied to the most
impoverished, psychotically hos
tile nations or even individuals.
The Black Death of 1346 prob
ably could have been contained
with the resources of modem
medicine. When hostile bacilli
have been augmented by human
intelligence, however, any con
fidence that they can be con
tained is a delusion.
The disastrous course of pres
ent-day Soviet militarism makes
it vastly harder to attempt a
world settlement for the surveil
lance and control of BW agents.
But BW can add nothing to the
strategic power of nuclear
armed states. If in nothing else,
we should be able to find a com
mon cause in protecting our
selves from a recurrence of
pestilence.
Or must we console ourselves
with the recollection that the
Black Death helped pave the
way to the .Renaissance?

Plague is still with us. It is
usually associated with tropical,
rat-infested environments, and
indeed it was again killing a mil
lion people a year, mostly in In
dia, at the time of World War I.
Since World War 11, vigorous
rat-eradication programs have
succeeded in holding plague
deaths down to a few hundred.
The disease has, however,
gradually spread to native, wild
rodents throughout the world,
where it smolders, only to break
out in an isolated case or small
epidemic of "sylvatic" or forest
living plague. The deprivations
of war, as in Viet Nam, also
foster new outbreaks of plague.
As far as we know, these out
breaks are caused by the same
bacillus that spread the Black
Death. However, the organism
does show considerable varia
tion under laboratory conditions.
An epidemic of the Black
Death may have reflected the
evolution of some especially vir
ulent and contagious form of the
bacillus. Fortunately, streptomy
cin and a few other antibiotics
are remarkably effective.
Nevertheless, human ingenu
ity is quite capable of wasting
the good fortune of the human
species. Mutant strains of the
bacillus that are indifferent to

antibiotic therapy are easily cul
tured. The potential of plague
for biological warfare is obvious
in the light of the historic pre
cedents.
Any intelligent program of
BW research, especially if its
main mission were "defensive,"
would have to develop such ag
gressive, drug-resistant bacilli
in order to evaluate them as a
military threat.
BW research must also be
concerned with the factors that
encourage the airborne spread
of pneumonic plague. Basic
knowledge of such phenomena
cannot be denied to the most
impoverished, psychotically hos
tile nations or even individuals.
The Black Death of 1346 prob
ably could have been contained
with the resources of modem
medicine. When hostile bacilli
have been augmented by human
intelligence, however, any con
fidence that they can be con

The disastrous course of pres
ent-day Soviet militarism makes
it vastly harder to attempt a
world settlement for the surveil
lance and control of BW agents.
But BW can add nothing to the
strategic power of nuclear
armed states. If in nothing else,
we should be able to find a com

selves from a recurrence of
pestilence.
Or must we console ourselves
with the recollection that the
Black Death helped pave the

In mid-14th century, the Cri
mean seaport of Caffa (now
called Feodosia) was an import
ant fortified outpost of Genoese
traders. For the previous 50
years, Genoa had been in inter
mittent conflict with Venice and
with factions of the Mongol
Golden Horde.
In the year 1346, Caffa was
again besieged by the Mongols.
During this same time, a vast
epidemic of bubonic plague had
rapidly spread through the Mon
gol empire.
In the words of Gabriel de
Mussis, a contemporary chron

icier, "The Tartars, fatigued by
such a plague and pestiferous
disease, stupified and amazed,
observing themselves dying
without hope of health ordered
cadavers placed on their cata
pults and thrown into the city
of Caffa, so that by means of
these intolerable passengers the
defenders died widely."
After this bacteriological at
tack, the survivors abandoned
the city and returned to Genoa
as best they could. By 1348, the
Black Death had devastated
Europe.
Dr. V. J. Derbes of Tulane
Medical School, writing in the

Journal of the American Medi
cal Association (April 4, 1966),
pointed out that the plague
would undoubtedly have reached
Europe by trade routes, regard
less of this incident.
The Black Death raged across
Europe for the next two years
and burned itself out only after
killing at least a fourth of the
population.
As the epidemic became more

in order to evaluate them as a
military threat.
BW research must also be
concerned with the factors that
encourage the airborne spread
of pneumonic plague. Basic
knowledge of such phenomena
cannot be denied to the most
impoverished, psychotically hos
tile nations or even individuals.
The Black Death of 1346 prob
ably could have been contained
with the resources of modem
medicine. When hostile bacilli
have been augmented by human
intelligence, however, any con
fidence that they can be con
tained is a delusion.
The disastrous course of pres
ent-day Soviet militarism makes
it vastly harder to attempt a
world settlement for the surveil
lance and control of BW agents.
But BW can add nothing to the
strategic power of nuclear
armed states. If in nothing else,
we should be able to find a com
mon cause in protecting our
selves from a recurrence of
pestilence.
Or must we console ourselves
with the recollection that the
Black Death helped pave the
way to the .Renaissance?
