# TA Strike? Grad Students Take Sides
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
Immediate reaction among
teaching assistants (TA's) var
ied greatly from department to
department to a threatened
strike stemming from salary de
mands placed before the Admin
istration recently.
In general, TA's from the so
cial sciences and humanities
backed the demands and possi
ble strike much more enthusi
astically than science TA's.
Graduate student representa
tives from the English, political
science, and anthropology de
partments on Monday rejected
as inadequate Administration
proposals for an increase in all
TA salaries of $400 next year.
The TA's last month demand
ed immediate yearly raises of
$700, plus a dependent allow
ance. A strike, to begin Nov. 30,
has been threatened if no ac
ceptable solution has been
reached by that time.
Heavy Work Load
All graduate students inter
viewed sympathized with the po
litical science TA's, citing their
low pay or "heavy work load."
The threat of a strike did not
rece iv e widespread support.
Many TA's indicated that they
would consider striking in sup
port of the political science TA's
or on their own behalf, but most

hinted that they probably would
not.
Science TA's were relatively
satisfied with their pay and
working loads, while they ad
mitted their conditions vvere
better than those in other de
partments. The political science
department was generally cited
as being the most poorly paid
and the most over-worked.
Not Satisfied
Richard Kershner, a TA in En
plish, explained his position on
the threatened strike: "I'm in
the AFT so obviouslv I'm not
entirely satisfied. Generally, I
think the TA's, including my
self, are underpaid for the
amount of work thev do. It's
my impression that other de
partments are paid more for
the amount of work that they
get."
In answer to questions, Bri
gitte Labrantz, a TA in the Ger
man department, stated that she
would support a strike and go
on strike if the time came. "The
demands that are being made
are absolutely fair. We're at the
point that we're getting so lit
tle money that we have difficul
ties xeroxing material for class
and getting books for class."
Miss Labrantz then compared
the TA salaries at Stanford
with those elsewhere. "Living in

Northern California is very ex
pensive. At the University of
California at Irvine it was ex
pected that we would get $3000
per year. We are getting less
here. It's a very humiliating
state."
Need More Money
The physics and engineering
TA's seemed very happy in
their departments. A TA in
nuclear physics, Tom Miller,
said: "The physics department
seems to take reasonable con
cern toward the TA's. The TA's
feel that they need more money
and the physics department
wants to help.
"Now is a horrible time to
ask for more money because of
all the cuts in government aid
to education," he added.
However, Miller indicated that
although in his situation he
would not strike, "If I were in

their (political science) depart
ment and situation I might. A
lot of my friends and myself
are in sympathy with those
TA's who have threatened to
strike."
The anthropology and philoso
phy departments have a differ
ent situation from other depart
ments. In both cases, students
are required to teach as a re
quirement for the departments'
Ph.D. degree.
Lack of TA's
According to Janet Fjellman,
a TA in anthropology, "Under
this system, witli 400 people in
Anthropology I, there are not
enough TA's to go around.
There are only a few TA's in
this department who get paid.
We need fees or something to
pay for grading all these pa
pers, running sections, and so
forth.

"All the TA's in anthropology
have agreed to strike if the de
mands are not met," Miss Fjell
man continued. "What we will
strike for is more paid TAships.
Given only 2 TA's for Anthro
pology I that has an enrollment
each quarter of 250-500 students,
the department does not have
the money to distribute the load
fairly."
The anthropology TA's were
very strong in their support of
the demands of the Political Sci
ence TA's. Miss Fjellman ex
plained: "We are really in sym
pathy with the Poli Sci demands
and we feel that they have a
horrible situation and we would
strike just for them. They have
to work very hard and just don't
have enough money to live on.
Benefits This Year
"I think that the administra
tion thinks that they can get

away with offering things for
next year but the TA's are in
terested in getting something
for this year." She added that
many TA's need higher benefits
this academic year.
According to Lawrence Lom
bard, "People in the philosophy
department are generally satis
fied with the money they make."
But Lombard did not rule out
the possibility that he would
strike. "I would consider strik
ing in sympathy if I felt the
demands are reasonable. This
should just be a way of rein
forcing the reasonableness of
their demands."
Bob Gulliver of the mathemat
ics department indicated a simi
lar feeling about a strike. "For
myself I don't feel that I've been
wronged enough and I don't
feel that strongly that some
thing is wrong here. I would
consider striking, but at the

moment I don't think that I
would."
"Biology Is Wonderful"
At least one biology depart
ment TA seemed quite satisfied
with departmental salaries and
work loads. According to Andy
Moldenke, a TA in Population
Biology, "Biology is wonderful
No other school treats us this
well. When we were admitted
we were guaranteed a salary
for 4 years and we have a teach
ing load of 1 to 2 years. The pay
is adequate, $2600.
"I have sympathy for other
TA's, but the promise of a $400
a year increase for all TA's next
year by the administration is
great, especially because of the
tight money this year. It is cer
tainly reasonable."
Nevertheless, thirty-five grad
uate students in the biology de
partment have signed a petition
supporting the TA's demands.

each quarter of 250-500 students,
the department does not have
the money to distribute the load
fairly."
The anthropology TA's were
very strong in their support of
the demands of the Political Sci
ence TA's. Miss Fjellman ex
plained: "We are really in sym
pathy with the Poli Sci demands
and we feel that they have a
horrible situation and we would
strike just for them. They have
to work very hard and just don't
have enough money to live on.
Benefits This Year
"I think that the administra
tion thinks that they can get

away with offering things for
next year but the TA's are in
terested in getting something
for this year." She added that
many TA's need higher benefits
this academic year.
According to Lawrence Lom
bard, "People in the philosophy
department are generally satis
fied with the money they make."
But Lombard did not rule out
the possibility that he would
strike. "I would consider strik
ing in sympathy if I felt the
demands are reasonable. This
should just be a way of rein
forcing the reasonableness of
their demands."
Bob Gulliver of the mathemat
ics department indicated a simi
lar feeling about a strike. "For
myself I don't feel that I've been
wronged enough and I don't
feel that strongly that some
thing is wrong here. I would
consider striking, but at the

moment I don't think that I
would."
"Biology Is Wonderful"
At least one biology depart
ment TA seemed quite satisfied
with departmental salaries and
work loads. According to Andy
Moldenke, a TA in Population
Biology, "Biology is wonderful
No other school treats us this
well. When we were admitted
we were guaranteed a salary
for 4 years and we have a teach
ing load of 1 to 2 years. The pay
is adequate, $2600.
"I have sympathy for other
TA's, but the promise of a $400
a year increase for all TA's next
year by the administration is
great, especially because of the
tight money this year. It is cer
tainly reasonable."
Nevertheless, thirty-five grad
uate students in the biology de
partment have signed a petition
supporting the TA's demands.

. . . while others complained bitterly about low pay and the "heavy work load."

Immediate reaction among
teaching assistants (TA's) var
ied greatly from department to
department to a threatened
strike stemming from salary de
mands placed before the Admin
istration recently.
In general, TA's from the so
cial sciences and humanities
backed the demands and possi
ble strike much more enthusi
astically than science TA's.
Graduate student representa
tives from the English, political
science, and anthropology de
partments on Monday rejected
as inadequate Administration
proposals for an increase in all
TA salaries of $400 next year.
The TA's last month demand
ed immediate yearly raises of
$700, plus a dependent allow
ance. A strike, to begin Nov. 30,
has been threatened if no ac
ceptable solution has been
reached by that time.
Heavy Work Load
All graduate students inter
viewed sympathized with the po
litical science TA's, citing their
low pay or "heavy work load."
The threat of a strike did not
rece iv e widespread support.
Many TA's indicated that they
would consider striking in sup
port of the political science TA's
or on their own behalf, but most

hinted that they probably would
not.
Science TA's were relatively
satisfied with their pay and
working loads, while they ad
mitted their conditions vvere
better than those in other de
partments. The political science
department was generally cited
as being the most poorly paid
and the most over-worked.
Not Satisfied
Richard Kershner, a TA in En
plish, explained his position on
the threatened strike: "I'm in
the AFT so obviouslv I'm not
entirely satisfied. Generally, I
think the TA's, including my
self, are underpaid for the
amount of work thev do. It's
my impression that other de
partments are paid more for
the amount of work that they
get."
In answer to questions, Bri
gitte Labrantz, a TA in the Ger
man department, stated that she
would support a strike and go
on strike if the time came. "The
demands that are being made
are absolutely fair. We're at the
point that we're getting so lit
tle money that we have difficul
ties xeroxing material for class
and getting books for class."
Miss Labrantz then compared
the TA salaries at Stanford
with those elsewhere. "Living in

Northern California is very ex
pensive. At the University of
California at Irvine it was ex
pected that we would get $3000
per year. We are getting less
here. It's a very humiliating
state."
Need More Money
The physics and engineering
TA's seemed very happy in
their departments. A TA in
nuclear physics, Tom Miller,
said: "The physics department
seems to take reasonable con
cern toward the TA's. The TA's
feel that they need more money
and the physics department
wants to help.
"Now is a horrible time to
ask for more money because of
all the cuts in government aid
to education," he added.
However, Miller indicated that
although in his situation he
would not strike, "If I were in

their (political science) depart
ment and situation I might. A
lot of my friends and myself
are in sympathy with those
TA's who have threatened to
strike."
The anthropology and philoso
phy departments have a differ
ent situation from other depart
ments. In both cases, students
are required to teach as a re
quirement for the departments'
Ph.D. degree.
Lack of TA's
According to Janet Fjellman,
a TA in anthropology, "Under
this system, witli 400 people in
Anthropology I, there are not
enough TA's to go around.
There are only a few TA's in
this department who get paid.
We need fees or something to
pay for grading all these pa
pers, running sections, and so
forth.

"All the TA's in anthropology
have agreed to strike if the de
mands are not met," Miss Fjell
man continued. "What we will
strike for is more paid TAships.
Given only 2 TA's for Anthro
pology I that has an enrollment
each quarter of 250-500 students,
the department does not have

entirely satisfied. Generally, I
think the TA's, including my
self, are underpaid for the
amount of work thev do. It's
my impression that other de
partments are paid more for
the amount of work that they
get."
In answer to questions, Bri
gitte Labrantz, a TA in the Ger
man department, stated that she
would support a strike and go
on strike if the time came. "The
demands that are being made
are absolutely fair. We're at the
point that we're getting so lit
tle money that we have difficul
ties xeroxing material for class
and getting books for class."
Miss Labrantz then compared
the TA salaries at Stanford
with those elsewhere. "Living in

Northern California is very ex
pensive. At the University of
California at Irvine it was ex
pected that we would get $3000
per year. We are getting less
here. It's a very humiliating
state."
Need More Money
The physics and engineering
TA's seemed very happy in
their departments. A TA in
nuclear physics, Tom Miller,
said: "The physics department
seems to take reasonable con
cern toward the TA's. The TA's
feel that they need more money
and the physics department
wants to help.
"Now is a horrible time to
ask for more money because of
all the cuts in government aid
to education," he added.
However, Miller indicated that
although in his situation he
would not strike, "If I were in

their (political science) depart
ment and situation I might. A
lot of my friends and myself
are in sympathy with those
TA's who have threatened to
strike."
The anthropology and philoso
phy departments have a differ
ent situation from other depart
ments. In both cases, students
are required to teach as a re
quirement for the departments'
Ph.D. degree.
Lack of TA's
According to Janet Fjellman,
a TA in anthropology, "Under
this system, witli 400 people in
Anthropology I, there are not
enough TA's to go around.
There are only a few TA's in
this department who get paid.
We need fees or something to
pay for grading all these pa
pers, running sections, and so
forth.

"All the TA's in anthropology
have agreed to strike if the de
mands are not met," Miss Fjell
man continued. "What we will
strike for is more paid TAships.
Given only 2 TA's for Anthro
pology I that has an enrollment
each quarter of 250-500 students,
the department does not have
the money to distribute the load
fairly."
The anthropology TA's were
very strong in their support of
the demands of the Political Sci
ence TA's. Miss Fjellman ex
plained: "We are really in sym
pathy with the Poli Sci demands
and we feel that they have a
horrible situation and we would
strike just for them. They have
to work very hard and just don't
have enough money to live on.
Benefits This Year
"I think that the administra
tion thinks that they can get

away with offering things for
next year but the TA's are in
terested in getting something
for this year." She added that
many TA's need higher benefits
this academic year.
According to Lawrence Lom
bard, "People in the philosophy
department are generally satis
fied with the money they make."
But Lombard did not rule out
the possibility that he would
strike. "I would consider strik
ing in sympathy if I felt the
demands are reasonable. This
should just be a way of rein
forcing the reasonableness of
their demands."
Bob Gulliver of the mathemat
ics department indicated a simi
lar feeling about a strike. "For
myself I don't feel that I've been
wronged enough and I don't
feel that strongly that some
thing is wrong here. I would
consider striking, but at the

moment I don't think that I
would."
"Biology Is Wonderful"
At least one biology depart
ment TA seemed quite satisfied
with departmental salaries and
work loads. According to Andy
Moldenke, a TA in Population
Biology, "Biology is wonderful
No other school treats us this
well. When we were admitted
we were guaranteed a salary
for 4 years and we have a teach
ing load of 1 to 2 years. The pay
is adequate, $2600.
"I have sympathy for other
TA's, but the promise of a $400
a year increase for all TA's next
year by the administration is
great, especially because of the
tight money this year. It is cer
tainly reasonable."
Nevertheless, thirty-five grad
uate students in the biology de
partment have signed a petition
supporting the TA's demands.

. . . while others complained bitterly about low pay and the "heavy work load."

Immediate reaction among
teaching assistants (TA's) var
ied greatly from department to
department to a threatened
strike stemming from salary de
mands placed before the Admin
istration recently.
In general, TA's from the so
cial sciences and humanities
backed the demands and possi
ble strike much more enthusi
astically than science TA's.
Graduate student representa
tives from the English, political
science, and anthropology de
partments on Monday rejected
as inadequate Administration
proposals for an increase in all
TA salaries of $400 next year.
The TA's last month demand
ed immediate yearly raises of
$700, plus a dependent allow
ance. A strike, to begin Nov. 30,
has been threatened if no ac
ceptable solution has been
reached by that time.
Heavy Work Load
All graduate students inter
viewed sympathized with the po
litical science TA's, citing their
low pay or "heavy work load."
The threat of a strike did not
rece iv e widespread support.
Many TA's indicated that they
would consider striking in sup
port of the political science TA's
or on their own behalf, but most

hinted that they probably would
not.
Science TA's were relatively
satisfied with their pay and
working loads, while they ad
mitted their conditions vvere
better than those in other de
partments. The political science
department was generally cited
as being the most poorly paid
and the most over-worked.
Not Satisfied
Richard Kershner, a TA in En
plish, explained his position on
the threatened strike: "I'm in

Biology, "Biology is wonderful
No other school treats us this
well. When we were admitted
we were guaranteed a salary
for 4 years and we have a teach
ing load of 1 to 2 years. The pay
is adequate, $2600.
"I have sympathy for other
TA's, but the promise of a $400
a year increase for all TA's next
year by the administration is
great, especially because of the
tight money this year. It is cer
tainly reasonable."
Nevertheless, thirty-five grad
uate students in the biology de
partment have signed a petition
supporting the TA's demands.

. . . while others complained bitterly about low pay and the "heavy work load."

Immediate reaction among
teaching assistants (TA's) var
ied greatly from department to
department to a threatened
strike stemming from salary de
mands placed before the Admin
istration recently.
In general, TA's from the so
cial sciences and humanities
backed the demands and possi
ble strike much more enthusi
astically than science TA's.
Graduate student representa
tives from the English, political
science, and anthropology de
partments on Monday rejected
as inadequate Administration
proposals for an increase in all
TA salaries of $400 next year.
The TA's last month demand
ed immediate yearly raises of
$700, plus a dependent allow
ance. A strike, to begin Nov. 30,
has been threatened if no ac
ceptable solution has been
reached by that time.
Heavy Work Load
All graduate students inter
viewed sympathized with the po
litical science TA's, citing their
low pay or "heavy work load."
The threat of a strike did not
rece iv e widespread support.
Many TA's indicated that they
would consider striking in sup
port of the political science TA's
or on their own behalf, but most

hinted that they probably would
not.
Science TA's were relatively
satisfied with their pay and
working loads, while they ad
mitted their conditions vvere
better than those in other de
partments. The political science
department was generally cited
as being the most poorly paid
and the most over-worked.
Not Satisfied
Richard Kershner, a TA in En
plish, explained his position on
the threatened strike: "I'm in
the AFT so obviouslv I'm not
entirely satisfied. Generally, I
think the TA's, including my
self, are underpaid for the
amount of work thev do. It's
my impression that other de
partments are paid more for
the amount of work that they
get."
In answer to questions, Bri
gitte Labrantz, a TA in the Ger
man department, stated that she
would support a strike and go
on strike if the time came. "The
demands that are being made
are absolutely fair. We're at the
point that we're getting so lit
tle money that we have difficul
ties xeroxing material for class
and getting books for class."
Miss Labrantz then compared
the TA salaries at Stanford
with those elsewhere. "Living in

Northern California is very ex
pensive. At the University of
California at Irvine it was ex
pected that we would get $3000
per year. We are getting less
here. It's a very humiliating
state."
Need More Money
The physics and engineering
TA's seemed very happy in
their departments. A TA in
nuclear physics, Tom Miller,
said: "The physics department
seems to take reasonable con
cern toward the TA's. The TA's
feel that they need more money
and the physics department
wants to help.
"Now is a horrible time to
ask for more money because of
all the cuts in government aid
to education," he added.
However, Miller indicated that
although in his situation he
would not strike, "If I were in

their (political science) depart
ment and situation I might. A
lot of my friends and myself
are in sympathy with those
TA's who have threatened to
strike."
The anthropology and philoso
phy departments have a differ
ent situation from other depart
ments. In both cases, students
are required to teach as a re
quirement for the departments'
Ph.D. degree.
Lack of TA's
According to Janet Fjellman,
a TA in anthropology, "Under
this system, witli 400 people in
Anthropology I, there are not
enough TA's to go around.
There are only a few TA's in
this department who get paid.
We need fees or something to
pay for grading all these pa
pers, running sections, and so
forth.

"All the TA's in anthropology
have agreed to strike if the de
mands are not met," Miss Fjell
man continued. "What we will
strike for is more paid TAships.
Given only 2 TA's for Anthro
pology I that has an enrollment
each quarter of 250-500 students,
the department does not have
the money to distribute the load
fairly."
The anthropology TA's were
very strong in their support of
the demands of the Political Sci
ence TA's. Miss Fjellman ex
plained: "We are really in sym
pathy with the Poli Sci demands
and we feel that they have a
horrible situation and we would
strike just for them. They have
to work very hard and just don't
have enough money to live on.
Benefits This Year
"I think that the administra
tion thinks that they can get

away with offering things for
next year but the TA's are in
terested in getting something
for this year." She added that
many TA's need higher benefits
this academic year.
According to Lawrence Lom
bard, "People in the philosophy
department are generally satis
fied with the money they make."
But Lombard did not rule out
the possibility that he would
strike. "I would consider strik
ing in sympathy if I felt the
demands are reasonable. This
should just be a way of rein
forcing the reasonableness of
their demands."
Bob Gulliver of the mathemat
ics department indicated a simi
lar feeling about a strike. "For
myself I don't feel that I've been
wronged enough and I don't
feel that strongly that some
thing is wrong here. I would
consider striking, but at the

moment I don't think that I
would."
"Biology Is Wonderful"
At least one biology depart
ment TA seemed quite satisfied
with departmental salaries and
work loads. According to Andy
Moldenke, a TA in Population
Biology, "Biology is wonderful
No other school treats us this
well. When we were admitted
we were guaranteed a salary
for 4 years and we have a teach
ing load of 1 to 2 years. The pay
is adequate, $2600.
"I have sympathy for other
TA's, but the promise of a $400
a year increase for all TA's next
year by the administration is
great, especially because of the
tight money this year. It is cer
tainly reasonable."

uate students in the biology de
partment have signed a petition
supporting the TA's demands.
