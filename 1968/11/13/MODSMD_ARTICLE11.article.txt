Dear Mom,
We have a friend who doesn't
want to have to take History
200. (History 200 is the 10 unit
required course for history ma
jors in which 60 books must be
read.) What can she do?
JHK and
Jim Perloff
Dear JHK and Jim,
I relayed your question to Dr.
David Kennedy who runs His
tory 200. He offered three al
ternatives: (1) she can transfer
to San Jose State: (2) she can
transfer to U.C. Berkeley; (3)
she can change her major to

.roxy s>ci. ne reiusea 10 eitner
confirm or deny the prevalent
rumor that History 200 exams
are graded by the secretary in
the History Office and the
woman who runs the food con
cession in the Law Lounge.
Historically yours,
Mom
Dear Mom,
My parents and friends at
home refuse to believe that I
live in a trailer right in the main
Quad of Stanford University
outside the President's office. My
mother keeps writing, "You
know you can tell us anything
and it hurts us that you won't
confide your address to us. For
$3500/ year the least you can do
is give us your return address."
Thorp are tear stains all over
her letters: I hate to hurt her
and also hate to lose the 3 grand.
What shall I do?

rsewuuereu,
La Caravane Verte
Main Quad Trailer Park
Dear Bewildered,
In times of stress, dear, it is
always good to turn to the Bible
which admonishes us "to honor
thy Mother and What's-his
name." In this case, a little lie
is the most charitable solution.
Write your parents that you arc
living with a psychedelic harem
in the Haight. This will draw
your parents closer together in
their mutual sorrow; give them
a good feeling of their own tol
erance; and enable your Mother
to "one-up" her friends at Bridge
Group whose children are only
blowing pot. This is the least
you can do for your lovely par
ents who have made so many
sacrifices for you.
Maternally,
Mom
