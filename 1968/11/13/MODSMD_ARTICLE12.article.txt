On November 6 I received a nasty message from my
mother, chastising me for not voting and implying that
1 am partly responsible for the success of Richard
Nixon.
Judging from a number of letters received by The
Daily before the election, many members of the
Stanford community feel the same way about electoral
abdication.
*n part I have to agree with those who are dumping
<>n me. As 1 watched the pseudo-event run its televised
rour.-e on election night, I found myself rooting for
I lie pudgy druggist.
But I had conveniently misplaced my absentee bal
lot. And 1 do not think I could have brought myself to
Miake a mark beside that line of alliterative iambic
quadrameter (Hubert Horatio Humphrey indeed!) in
any case.
The critics of nonvoting have said that it would be
impossible for them to help elect Nixon or Wallace,
however negative their contribution might be. Unfor
tunately 1 do not think I could share the responsibility
for President Humphrey any more easily than I could
vote for his two rivals.

America seems to be trying to forget Vietnam as
quickly as possible. This may be possible for those
whose reactions to war were formed between 1942 and
1945. But for me, and, I feel, for many of my contem
poraries, the last six or eight years has seen a drastic
change in our conscious and subconscious assumptions
about our motherland.
From the days of the Plymouth Colony this nation
has regarded itself as a light upon a hill, an actual or
potential example to the rest of the world of how a
rational, prosperous, most-nearly-ideal society might
be achieved. Vietnam has shown us that our attempts
to shed the light of American righteousness have
transformed us into homicidal maniacs.
Like a contagious plague, our doubt has spread un
til it infected our own homes. Who can say there not
a lot of parallels between Harlem or Oakland or Ala
bama and our economic and cultural colonies overseas?
But psychically and perhaps historically most im
portant is the fact that many of us carry in our
brains the image of a charred, torn Asian child dying
an agonizing, unnecessary, and eternal death. We know
that this child is being murdered by Hubert Humphrey,

by the cultural and political values of our society, and
ultimately by each one of us.
At the last moment, when people were crying about
what Richard Nixon might not do for the poor, our
liberals forgot about the Asian child. But Humphrey
never once wavered in his devotion to the world-view
that created the Vietnam tragedy. I would find it
easier to vote for Adolph Eichman. At least he knew
what he was doing.
There remains the question of whether Nixon will
prove to be the disaster for our underprivileged mi
norities that last-minute advocates of Joyful Politics
warned us about. I do not think so.
Republicans have traditionally embodied the stem,
disciplinarian father-principle in our political system,
while Democrats have been our generous, forgiving
mothers. But everyone knows that Ma and Pa are a
team. Dad may spank us, or talk gruffly about keeping
off the streets, while Mom gives us cookies. But Dad is
not going to shut off the cookies any more than Mom
is going to save us from our spanking.
Oh, she may shed a tear or two when we howl, but
we know that they are still going to end up in bed
with each other.

what Richard Nixon might not do for the poor, our
liberals forgot about the Asian child. But Humphrey
never once wavered in his devotion to the world-view
that created the Vietnam tragedy. I would find it
easier to vote for Adolph Eichman. At least he knew
what he was doing.
There remains the question of whether Nixon will
prove to be the disaster for our underprivileged mi
norities that last-minute advocates of Joyful Politics
warned us about. I do not think so.
Republicans have traditionally embodied the stem,
disciplinarian father-principle in our political system,
while Democrats have been our generous, forgiving
mothers. But everyone knows that Ma and Pa are a
team. Dad may spank us, or talk gruffly about keeping
off the streets, while Mom gives us cookies. But Dad is
not going to shut off the cookies any more than Mom
is going to save us from our spanking.
Oh, she may shed a tear or two when we howl, but
we know that they are still going to end up in bed
with each other.
On November 6 I received a nasty message from my
mother, chastising me for not voting and implying that
1 am partly responsible for the success of Richard
Nixon.
Judging from a number of letters received by The
Daily before the election, many members of the
Stanford community feel the same way about electoral
abdication.
*n part I have to agree with those who are dumping
<>n me. As 1 watched the pseudo-event run its televised
rour.-e on election night, I found myself rooting for
I lie pudgy druggist.
But I had conveniently misplaced my absentee bal
lot. And 1 do not think I could have brought myself to
Miake a mark beside that line of alliterative iambic
quadrameter (Hubert Horatio Humphrey indeed!) in
any case.
The critics of nonvoting have said that it would be
impossible for them to help elect Nixon or Wallace,
however negative their contribution might be. Unfor
tunately 1 do not think I could share the responsibility
for President Humphrey any more easily than I could
vote for his two rivals.

America seems to be trying to forget Vietnam as
quickly as possible. This may be possible for those
whose reactions to war were formed between 1942 and
1945. But for me, and, I feel, for many of my contem
poraries, the last six or eight years has seen a drastic
change in our conscious and subconscious assumptions
about our motherland.
From the days of the Plymouth Colony this nation
has regarded itself as a light upon a hill, an actual or
potential example to the rest of the world of how a
rational, prosperous, most-nearly-ideal society might
be achieved. Vietnam has shown us that our attempts
to shed the light of American righteousness have
transformed us into homicidal maniacs.
Like a contagious plague, our doubt has spread un
til it infected our own homes. Who can say there not
a lot of parallels between Harlem or Oakland or Ala
bama and our economic and cultural colonies overseas?
But psychically and perhaps historically most im
portant is the fact that many of us carry in our
brains the image of a charred, torn Asian child dying
an agonizing, unnecessary, and eternal death. We know
that this child is being murdered by Hubert Humphrey,

by the cultural and political values of our society, and
ultimately by each one of us.
At the last moment, when people were crying about
what Richard Nixon might not do for the poor, our
liberals forgot about the Asian child. But Humphrey
