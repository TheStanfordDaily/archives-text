• Chess Challenge
Editor, The Daily:
On Oct. 31, the STANFORD
CHESSPLAYERS issued a chal
lenge to the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley Chess Club
to play a big game day match.
To date there has been no reply.
Some argue that State funds
should not be used to educate
radicals. I disagree but think it
a pity that the taxpayers hard
earned cash goes to educate
cowards.

Editor, TIDS DAILY:
An encounter with partici
pants in the recent anti-technol
ogy sit-out at Stanford Electron
ics Labs has moved me to make
the following observations.
It is curious that even among
the cadres of Students for a
Democratic Society there could
be support for a protest against
basic scientific research. Here is
a drive which is pathetically
anti-intellectual; against work
which has less direct relevance
to the war in Vietnam than the
auto industry, agriculture, or
button production.
The latter can make military
contributions now, but to go
from basic research to some sort
It is curious that even among
of workable device is generally a
very long term process. Of
course, if analyzed down to the
last detail, almost any human
effort of a productive sort has
possible military applications,
and science has indeed acted in
the long term to put greater
power both for good and evil
into the hands of men.
But when the decisions of gov
ernment are the real issue, let's
not obscure it with a smoke
screen of talk over alleged evil
of technology and scientists. In
anity reached its height Tuesday
when one of the demonstrators
went beyond this even to the
point of telling the staff of S.E.L.
what its own motives were for
doing such evil deeds.
The motives cited were, of
course, self aggrandizement and
love of the dollar.
Whether activists picket a de
fense plant or the academicians
at S.E.L., the amount of noise
they make or the nasty things
they may do are not reasons for
the rest of the community to be
impressed with the righteous
ness of their cause. These acts
have strained the goodwill of
those of us who believe the is
sues are not so simple, and we.
who are a majority of diverse
views should be united in this:
a resolve to resist the tactics of
coercion by making sure that
they do not work.
For this reason I have fully
supported the referendum on
activism and coercion, and ferv
ently hope that in the future
the administration, and in par
ticular the faculty, will have

the courage to stick by and
enforce decisions made out of a
consideration for the full spec
trum of views in our commu
nity-
S.D.S. will have to do better
than this. Its members will
either have to sell their ideas or
consign them to the heap of dis
credited dogma, consoling them
selves with the knowledge that
they were so right while an over
whelming majority was so hor
ribly wrong. Perhaps this situa
tion might even cause them to
reexamine some of their own
views.

• On Millions
Editor, The Daily:
Richard Nixon has been our
President-elect only since last
Tuesday, and already the moon
has begun to disappear. I sus
pect that in a week or two it
will be completely gone—and
never return again.

• Pitzer
Editor, The Daily:
It appears that in the present
controversy raging around the
appointment of Kenneth Pitzer
it has become fashionable to ei
ther take an extreme view or
not express one.
In a recent Daily we saw two
letters which seemed to be dia
metrically opposed. One seeming
to speak for the radical students
and the other for the alumni "es
tablishment". Whether either
Dell Martin or Alfred Spalding
are speaking for more than
themselves is irrelevant. In this
case it is the manner in which
they chose to do it.
This they had in common and
this they share with a great
number of the more vocal mem
bers of our society. It is begin
ning to appear that simplicity is
its own reward. To reduce Stan
fords role in defense research
to single-minded pursuit of op
pression takes the same kind of
simplistic reasoning as calling
all demonstrators "obviously
communistically inclined."
In this particular case it seems
that many of the issues have
gotten buried in the epithets. The
Daily's editorial pointed up some
of these issues.
Student responsibility in main
taining the confidential nature of
the selection process was un
justly criticized. Likewise the
student awareness of its own
problems and its "fresh" per
spective are advantages that
could undoubtedly be utilized by
the committee.
However, The Daily, too, is
guilty of only looking at one side
of the issue. By bringing in the
American Revolution and Thom

as Jefferson The Daily forces the
obvious comparison between the
Stanford community and the
American colonies.
This comparison is patently
unjustified for a number of rea
sons. The subtle implications
that Pitzer's selection violates
everything we hold sacred is a
fairly weak form of criticism.
There are issues to be discussed
yet many are still ignored.
Stanford students are here for
a relatively short part of their
life. No doubt the immediate
goals of future generations of
Stanford students will differ
from those of the present group.
Students do, however, have cer
tain things in common.
We should ask what these
things are. Tremendous changes
have taken place at Stanford in
recent years. We should not sac
rifice our right to disagree but
in this context subtle threats of
revolution are likely to hurt
more than help. It seems rela
tively pointless to suggest vio
lent overthrow in a situation
where the only possible result
can be damage to future poten
tial.
Likewise one should be a little
bit more humble in criticizing an
as yet untried president. Dissen

sion has already forced changes
within the system and cannot
help but affect Kenneth Pitzer if
he does indeed prove to be un
able to cope with the complexi
ties of Stanford. We should keep
this in mind as we allow him
a little bit more room in which
to prove himself.

• "Law and Order"
Editor, THE DAILY:
Since one of the three "law
and order" candidates was
elected to the Presidency, we
should pay heed to the admon
ition offered by Jeremy Bentham
back in 1824: "Among the sev
eral cloudy expressions which
have been commonly employed
as cloaks for misgovernment,
there is none more conspicuous
in this atmosphere of illusion
than the word order. This word
is in a peculiar degree adapted
to the purpose of a cloak for
tyranny. . . . The worst order
is as truly order as the best. . . .
What in the eyes of Napoleon
Bonaparte was good order? That
which it had been his pleasure
to establish."
