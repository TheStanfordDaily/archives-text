# Engineers Study Ocean
## An Answer To The Food Crisis? 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
Development of ocean re
sources to help solve world food
problems is this year's project
of Stanford Space Systems En
gineering course. Composed pri
marily of graduate students
from diverse academic fields, the
study group will be concerned
not only with applying tech
nology in order to reap the vast
benefits of underwater resources,
but also with the legal and in

ternational complications of such
proposals
They are given the opportuni
ty to hear guest speakers discuss
proposals and to consult with
these experts. The students la
ter divide into groups to each
analyze a specific aspect of the
project. Results, in the form of
recommendations, are published
in the spring.
In previous years, the teams
of faculty and students have de
signed world satellite weather

systems, global educational tele
vision systems, and an observa
tion system of the earth's re
sources. Final reports are pre
sented to representatives of gov
ernment and space industries,
and distributed nationally and
internationally.
Professor Bruce Lusignan, of
the Electrical Engineering De
partment and faculty coordina
tor of the program, stated that
students are able to gain experi
ence in developing "a serious
contribution to the field that is
researched". Several proposed
ideas have been used in actual
space programs.
Educational TV Satellites
Two past projects were re
cently presented to the Inter
national Astronautical Federa
tion meeting in New York City.
Professor Lusignan discussed
project ASCEND, concerning ed
ucational television developed by
the 1966-67 group. Graduate stu
dent Richard Miles presented
last year's findings, project De
meter, concerned with an earth
resource observation system.
ASCEND, the Advanced Sys
tem for Communications and
Education in National Develop
ment, proposes a preliminary
design of communication and
educational television satellites
for Brazil, India, and Indonesia.

The completed study shows how
educational television via satel
lite can be integrated into the
nation's educational programs,
and how satellite techniques can
be phased into present and fu
ture communication systems.
Professor Lusignan pointed
out that this educational system
is currently being utilized by the
Brazilian government. He added
that several South American stu
dents were able to work on the
proposal.
Earth Resource System
Project Demeter, named after
the Greek goddess of agricul
ture, involves the use of an
earth satellite to report on ag
ricultural, hydrological, oceano
graphic, geological, and atmos
pheric resources.
The proposal was studied in
terms of economic, political, as
well as technical implications. If
put into effect, the plan could
benefit the entire world by mak
ing possible more efficient man
agement and utilization of the
earth's resources.
Demeter's written report also
presents suggestions for "inter
national cooperation and a rec
ommended sequence of imple
mentation" to help solve politi
cal difficulties.
Ownership of Oceans
This year's study on ocean re

sources is confronted by even
greater legal implications, com
mented Professor Lusignan, be
cause of the currently "unknown
ownership of the world's
oceans." As a result, several law
students and special law faculty
advisors are involved in the re
search.
The final report is expected to
inclu d e recommendations of
ways of "setting up internation
al treaties" in order to define le
gal boundaries and to propose
treaties that would guarantee
benefits to developing nations.
Problems would arise, Busig
nan explained, in preventing de
veloped nations from obtaining
most of the benefits since they
would probably provide most of
the needed capital investments.
The final project is to be set
up in order to benefit all devel
oping countries without allowing
for control or manipulation of
one government or interest
group.
"Once students get over the
initial hurdles of acquiring back
ground," commented Prof. Lu
signan on the course, "they real
ize they are doing a real study
that people will look at. They
don't have to wait years and
years after college before they
are able to make a real contri
bution" to a particular field.

students are able to gain experi
ence in developing "a serious
contribution to the field that is
researched". Several proposed
ideas have been used in actual
space programs.
Educational TV Satellites
Two past projects were re
cently presented to the Inter
national Astronautical Federa
tion meeting in New York City.
Professor Lusignan discussed
project ASCEND, concerning ed
ucational television developed by
the 1966-67 group. Graduate stu
dent Richard Miles presented
last year's findings, project De
meter, concerned with an earth
resource observation system.
ASCEND, the Advanced Sys
tem for Communications and
Education in National Develop
ment, proposes a preliminary
design of communication and
educational television satellites
for Brazil, India, and Indonesia.

The completed study shows how
educational television via satel
lite can be integrated into the
nation's educational programs,
and how satellite techniques can
be phased into present and fu
ture communication systems.
Professor Lusignan pointed
out that this educational system
is currently being utilized by the
Brazilian government. He added
that several South American stu
dents were able to work on the
proposal.
Earth Resource System
Project Demeter, named after
the Greek goddess of agricul
ture, involves the use of an
earth satellite to report on ag
ricultural, hydrological, oceano
graphic, geological, and atmos
pheric resources.
The proposal was studied in
terms of economic, political, as
well as technical implications. If
put into effect, the plan could
benefit the entire world by mak
ing possible more efficient man
agement and utilization of the
earth's resources.
Demeter's written report also
presents suggestions for "inter
national cooperation and a rec
ommended sequence of imple
mentation" to help solve politi
cal difficulties.
Ownership of Oceans
This year's study on ocean re

sources is confronted by even
greater legal implications, com
mented Professor Lusignan, be
cause of the currently "unknown
ownership of the world's
oceans." As a result, several law
students and special law faculty
advisors are involved in the re
search.
The final report is expected to
inclu d e recommendations of
ways of "setting up internation
al treaties" in order to define le
gal boundaries and to propose
treaties that would guarantee
benefits to developing nations.
Problems would arise, Busig
nan explained, in preventing de
veloped nations from obtaining
most of the benefits since they
would probably provide most of
the needed capital investments.
The final project is to be set
up in order to benefit all devel
oping countries without allowing
for control or manipulation of
one government or interest
group.
"Once students get over the
initial hurdles of acquiring back
ground," commented Prof. Lu
signan on the course, "they real
ize they are doing a real study
that people will look at. They
don't have to wait years and
years after college before they
are able to make a real contri
bution" to a particular field.

Development of ocean re

proposals

proposals and to consult with
these experts. The students la

project. Results, in the form of

In previous years, the teams
of faculty and students have de

Earth Resource System
Project Demeter, named after
the Greek goddess of agricul
ture, involves the use of an
earth satellite to report on ag
ricultural, hydrological, oceano
graphic, geological, and atmos
pheric resources.
The proposal was studied in
terms of economic, political, as
well as technical implications. If
put into effect, the plan could
benefit the entire world by mak
ing possible more efficient man
agement and utilization of the
earth's resources.
Demeter's written report also
presents suggestions for "inter
national cooperation and a rec
ommended sequence of imple
mentation" to help solve politi
cal difficulties.
Ownership of Oceans
This year's study on ocean re

sources is confronted by even
greater legal implications, com
mented Professor Lusignan, be
cause of the currently "unknown
ownership of the world's
oceans." As a result, several law
students and special law faculty
advisors are involved in the re
search.
The final report is expected to
inclu d e recommendations of
ways of "setting up internation
al treaties" in order to define le
gal boundaries and to propose
treaties that would guarantee
benefits to developing nations.
Problems would arise, Busig
nan explained, in preventing de
veloped nations from obtaining
most of the benefits since they
would probably provide most of
the needed capital investments.
The final project is to be set
up in order to benefit all devel
oping countries without allowing
for control or manipulation of
one government or interest
group.
"Once students get over the
initial hurdles of acquiring back
ground," commented Prof. Lu
signan on the course, "they real
ize they are doing a real study
that people will look at. They
don't have to wait years and
years after college before they
are able to make a real contri
bution" to a particular field.
