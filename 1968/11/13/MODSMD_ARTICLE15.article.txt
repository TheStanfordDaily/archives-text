# Truffaut Art Films To Air
## 
### 
As a finale to its nine-week
repertory of great films, the Los Altos
International Theatre is presenting the
first three feature films of Francois
Truffaut, The 400 Blows, Shoot the
Piano Player and Jules and Jim. The op
portunity to see these three superior and
very influential films en masse should
not be bypassed by any movie buff or by
anyone with even a casual interest in the
cinema.
Truffaut made his first feature, the
autobiographical The 400 Blows, in
1959, won the Grand Prize at Cannes
and was immediately acclaimed as the
leader of the New Wave movement. This
film, made for about $75,000,
sensitively examines the maturation of a
delinquent youth in France and is a su
perbly realized character study, both on
the part of the director and of the young
actor, Jean-Pierre Le'aud.
Shoot the Piano Player, made a
year later, is a much freer and adven
turous film, patterned after the Holly
wood gangster films of the '30's, albeit
being much better. It deals with a small
time piano player (Charles Aznavour)
and his relations to his past and the vari
ous factions of Paris life. It is probably
Truffaut's richest work and by far the
most satisfying to experience.
Truffaut's third Film was Jules and
Jim (1961). Pauline Kael hails it as
". . .one of the most beautiful films ever
made, and the greatest motion picture of

recent years. . but is is significant not
only as art but as an expression of the
moral attitude of "the modern woman,"
despite the fact that the film is set
during World War I. It contains many
direct homages to other directors
(Griffith and Renoir in particular) but
has a distinct tone all its own. Indeed,
the tone prevailing heavily in all of
Truffaut's early work is one of great mel
ancholy: an outlook on life that is both
comic and tragic. This is a feeling, when
interpolated upon the films' plots, which
both lifts and wrenches the heart. Des
pite the critical coolness which Truffaut
reveals in his writing, his films are
undeniably emotional and sensitive.
After, his first four films (after Jules
and Jim came The Soft Skin, which was
in the same vein as his previous efforts),
Truffaut departed from his milieu and
made Fahrenheit 451, a distinct letdown
to many of his followers. Fven if Truffaut
were never to make another film he would
still stand as one of the world's most ex
citing and influential filmmakers on the
basis of his first three films alone.
Jules and Jim,The 400 Blows and
Shoot the Piano Player will be shown
at the Los Altos International Theater
on Nov. 13-19.

wood gangster films of the '30's, albeit
being much better. It deals with a small
time piano player (Charles Aznavour)
and his relations to his past and the vari
ous factions of Paris life. It is probably
Truffaut's richest work and by far the
most satisfying to experience.
Truffaut's third Film was Jules and
Jim (1961). Pauline Kael hails it as
". . .one of the most beautiful films ever
made, and the greatest motion picture of

recent years. . but is is significant not
only as art but as an expression of the
moral attitude of "the modern woman,"
despite the fact that the film is set
during World War I. It contains many
direct homages to other directors
(Griffith and Renoir in particular) but
has a distinct tone all its own. Indeed,
the tone prevailing heavily in all of
Truffaut's early work is one of great mel
ancholy: an outlook on life that is both
comic and tragic. This is a feeling, when
interpolated upon the films' plots, which
both lifts and wrenches the heart. Des
pite the critical coolness which Truffaut
reveals in his writing, his films are
undeniably emotional and sensitive.
After, his first four films (after Jules
and Jim came The Soft Skin, which was
in the same vein as his previous efforts),
Truffaut departed from his milieu and
made Fahrenheit 451, a distinct letdown
to many of his followers. Fven if Truffaut
were never to make another film he would
still stand as one of the world's most ex
citing and influential filmmakers on the
basis of his first three films alone.
Jules and Jim,The 400 Blows and
Shoot the Piano Player will be shown
at the Los Altos International Theater
on Nov. 13-19.
As a finale to its nine-week
repertory of great films, the Los Altos
International Theatre is presenting the
first three feature films of Francois
Truffaut, The 400 Blows, Shoot the
Piano Player and Jules and Jim. The op
portunity to see these three superior and
very influential films en masse should
not be bypassed by any movie buff or by
anyone with even a casual interest in the
cinema.
Truffaut made his first feature, the
autobiographical The 400 Blows, in
1959, won the Grand Prize at Cannes
and was immediately acclaimed as the
leader of the New Wave movement. This
film, made for about $75,000,
sensitively examines the maturation of a
delinquent youth in France and is a su
perbly realized character study, both on
the part of the director and of the young
actor, Jean-Pierre Le'aud.
Shoot the Piano Player, made a
year later, is a much freer and adven
turous film, patterned after the Holly
wood gangster films of the '30's, albeit
being much better. It deals with a small
time piano player (Charles Aznavour)
and his relations to his past and the vari
ous factions of Paris life. It is probably
Truffaut's richest work and by far the
most satisfying to experience.
