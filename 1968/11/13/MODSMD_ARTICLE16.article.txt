# Thomas Paces Indian Cross-Country Sweep
## 
### ALLEN MEREDITH 
In the final home meet of the
1968 cross-country season the
Stanford Varsity swept the top
five places to defeat the San
Jose State Spartans.
An incredible showing against
San Jose, who ran two All-Am
ericans, Darold Dent, and Thom
as Lowrey, begins to verify the
inevitable -Stanford may well
have the best cross-country team
in ihe country. The final score
is proof of their ability as Stan
ford scored the lowest score pos
sible in a meet—ls points—with
San Jose producing nothing bet
ter than 42.
Thomas T/»a<Ls Again
Brook Thomas led the team as
he crossed the finish line of the
six mile course with a time of
2!.'; 10.4. Close behind but evenly
spaced were Chuck Menz, Don
Kardong, A 1 Sanford, and Greg
F.rock with times of 29:52, 29:55,
29:59, and 30:01 respectively.

"I am extremely proud and im
pressed by the team's perform
ance" says coach Clark, "and if
the boys can keep the 15 second
point spread (from Thomas's
first place time of 29:46.4 to
Brock's fifth place time of
30:01), the team may be up with
the best in the nationals."
The Race
San Jose's All-American Dar
old Dent led through the first
mile of the extended Stanford
golf course, but by the second
mile mark it was all over for
San Jose State.
The Stanford five were in
their usual strategic pack-run
ning formation as they filed past
the marker at 10:29. At the 3.9
mile post Thomas edged slightly
ahead of the pack, about 6 sec
onds to be exact, with 20:06, and
the rest of the now four-man
unit were clocked at 20:12.
As the pressure built in the

final stretch, the Indians illu
strated the strength of a cham
pionship team as their final
kicks were outstandingly fast
for having run the six mile
course.
The National*
The team will be traveling to
New York to compete in the na
tionals November 25 at Van
Cortlandt in the Bronx. The
course is at Manhattan College
and will be six miles long. (It's
for this reason that the Stanford
course has been lengthened from
4.2 to 6 miles).
The Stanford Frosh kept the
ball rolling with a 1-2-3-finish,
led by Robert Coe, Jack Lawson,
and Craig Watson. Their com
posite score was 18 to San Jose
State JV's 39.
The final meet of the season
before the all-important nation
als will be against University of
California at Berkeley on Satur
day, November 16 at 10 a.m.


TOP MAN —Team captain Brook
Thomas, looking stronger with
each meet, blazed to a £9:1(5.1
clocking over <l»e six-mile Stan
ford course Saturday to lead
the Indians to a 15-42 whitewash
over San .lose State.


RETURNING TO FORM—After
getting off to a slow start due to
a chest cold this season, Greg
Brock finished a strong fifth
Saturday and shows signs of
regaining the form which made
him Stanford's MVP last year.
