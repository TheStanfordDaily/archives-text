# Stanford Outclassed 19-9
## Spartans Rip Tribe Poloists 
### FRED MANN 
The top ranked water polo
team in the nation, San Jose
Slate, is an impressive group
even before I hey get in the wa
ter. Seven players are physical
education majors, and one is
majoring in law enforcement.
After Friday night's slaughter
in the Spartan pool, Stanford
can most assuredly admit that
the combination of future coach
es and cops can be awfully rug
ged.
The Indians again proved that
they are not a first half team,
falling behind at intermission,
12-1 After the anti-climactic
second half, the final was 19-9.
The ovci How crowd saw a tre
mendous effort by the Spartans
on both offense and defense plus
somewhat inept passing and de
fense by the Tribe. S.J.S. picked
off 22 Card passes, some of them
very easily, while the visitors
intercepted only nine.
S.IS Goalie Impenetrable
Goalie Dennis Lombard was
a monster in the nets for the
winners, saving 11 shots. Five of
Stanford's nine goals came in
the final period when Lombard
was on the bench. Banks Beas
ley was under constant pres
sure in the Indian go.'d and end
ed up with 1(1 saves to his cre
dit.
The first quarter was a good
indication of the way the entire
game went total domination by
San Jor.;e. The ball hardly ever
left the Spartans' attacking

zone and every time Stanford
finally did gain control, the op
ponents would promptly take it
away. A major penalty against
tb" Cards' Rob Jensen gave
S.J.S. at penalty shot which they
hit early in the period. Greg
Hind of the Spartans followed
bis penalty score with another
goal from five feet, minutes
later.
The Stanford offense, terribly
pressured, hurried their passes
and were forced into poor shots.
San Jose made it 3-0 at the
quarter on the strength of Bill
Gerdts. He attempted two short
sin its in a row, both beautifully
blocked by Beasley, but connect
ed on a third when Stanford
again lost the ball.
Second Quarter Blues
The second quarter saw the
Tribe finally get on the score
board, but was not a total suc
cess for Coach Jim Gaughran's
squad. The Spartans banged in
nine goals in the period to ice
the game. After the first min
ute and a half, S.J.S. had scored
three times, taking advantage
of a practically non-existant
Stanford defense. Ken Terry
scored for the Cards on a beau
tiful corner shot, but San Jose
retaliated with four goals from
all over the pool, and two pen
alty shots to pull away.
In the second quarter espe
cially San Jose State showed the
remarkable teamwork, faking
ability, and defense that have
made them the top team in the

country. Stanford did not play
a bad game, but was rmdo to
look inept by the outstanding
work of the Spartans.
The Indians rallied slightly in
the third stanza as their defense
came to life. Dick Roth hit on
a shot from the side and then
Ross Johnson to score again.
The tenth team foul by the
home team proved meaningless
as the amazing Lombard rose
up to block Tom Hill's free pen
alty shot and deny a certain
point to the Cards. Hill came
back later however to score on
a nice backhand lob from the
outside. Dennis Belli pumped in
three goals in the quarter for
S.J.S. and Jim Williamson added
one more.
Hollow Victory
The fourth period was a moral
victory for the losers. It was
evenly played in most respects,
and the Cards even outscored
their foes, 5-3. Hill scored on
two penalty shots, and Roth hit
on two from the field. Rick Ea
gleston got into the scoring act
midway through the quarter,
but over all for Stanford, it
was much too little, way too
late against first class opposi
tion.
Saturday afternoon a surpris
ingly strong De Anza JC team
nearly upset Stanford. But Tom
Hill's three goals offset a great
performance by De Anza's
Lance Dilloway, and the Tribe
escaped with a 9-8 victory.

squad. The Spartans banged in
nine goals in the period to ice
the game. After the first min
ute and a half, S.J.S. had scored
three times, taking advantage
of a practically non-existant
Stanford defense. Ken Terry
scored for the Cards on a beau
tiful corner shot, but San Jose
retaliated with four goals from
all over the pool, and two pen
alty shots to pull away.
In the second quarter espe
cially San Jose State showed the
remarkable teamwork, faking
ability, and defense that have
made them the top team in the

country. Stanford did not play
a bad game, but was rmdo to
look inept by the outstanding
work of the Spartans.
The Indians rallied slightly in
the third stanza as their defense
came to life. Dick Roth hit on
a shot from the side and then
Ross Johnson to score again.
The tenth team foul by the
home team proved meaningless
as the amazing Lombard rose
up to block Tom Hill's free pen
alty shot and deny a certain
point to the Cards. Hill came
back later however to score on
a nice backhand lob from the
outside. Dennis Belli pumped in
three goals in the quarter for
S.J.S. and Jim Williamson added
one more.
Hollow Victory
The fourth period was a moral
victory for the losers. It was
evenly played in most respects,
and the Cards even outscored
their foes, 5-3. Hill scored on
two penalty shots, and Roth hit
on two from the field. Rick Ea
gleston got into the scoring act
midway through the quarter,
but over all for Stanford, it
was much too little, way too
late against first class opposi
tion.
Saturday afternoon a surpris
ingly strong De Anza JC team
nearly upset Stanford. But Tom
Hill's three goals offset a great
performance by De Anza's
Lance Dilloway, and the Tribe
escaped with a 9-8 victory.
The top ranked water polo
team in the nation, San Jose
Slate, is an impressive group
even before I hey get in the wa

education majors, and one is

After Friday night's slaughter
in the Spartan pool, Stanford
can most assuredly admit that
the combination of future coach
es and cops can be awfully rug
ged.
The Indians again proved that
they are not a first half team,
falling behind at intermission,
12-1 After the anti-climactic
second half, the final was 19-9.
The ovci How crowd saw a tre
mendous effort by the Spartans
on both offense and defense plus
somewhat inept passing and de

off 22 Card passes, some of them
very easily, while the visitors
intercepted only nine.
S.IS Goalie Impenetrable
Goalie Dennis Lombard was
a monster in the nets for the
winners, saving 11 shots. Five of
Stanford's nine goals came in
the final period when Lombard
was on the bench. Banks Beas
ley was under constant pres
sure in the Indian go.'d and end
ed up with 1(1 saves to his cre

The first quarter was a good
indication of the way the entire
game went total domination by
San Jor.;e. The ball hardly ever
left the Spartans' attacking

zone and every time Stanford
finally did gain control, the op
ponents would promptly take it
away. A major penalty against
tb" Cards' Rob Jensen gave
S.J.S. at penalty shot which they
hit early in the period. Greg
Hind of the Spartans followed
bis penalty score with another
goal from five feet, minutes
later.
The Stanford offense, terribly
pressured, hurried their passes
and were forced into poor shots.
San Jose made it 3-0 at the
quarter on the strength of Bill
Gerdts. He attempted two short

blocked by Beasley, but connect
