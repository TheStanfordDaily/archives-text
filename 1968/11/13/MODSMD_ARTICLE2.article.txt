# "Do Your Thing" In Dorm Seminars
## 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
This is the season to "do your
own thing," and students in
many Stanford residences are
finding a unique opportunity
for self-expression through par
ticipation in house seminars.
Initiated by special tutors
Resident Advisors, and often
undergraduate residents, these
seminars are enabling students
to informally study specialized
subjects with others in their
own residence.
In Grove House, participation
in a house seminar is required,
and students can receive from
one to five units of academic
credit per quarter for each.
Activities often take partici
pants off-campus, such as a re
cent trip to Mountain View's
Zen Center made by Grove's
Zen Buddhism seminar.
Initiated by graduate student
Mark Fruin, the seminar en
ables students to have both aca
demic and personal contact with
with this Eastern religion. Par
ticipation in both group and
individual mentation sessions
is a required feature of the
study.
Social Madness
The students in "Madness and
History," another Grove semi
nar studying types of madness
in society, recently sp r >nt an en
tire day walking through San
Francisco, observing and think
ing about the city and them
selves.
Another seminar, the "Social
Impact of the Cinema," involves
viewing and criticizing past
present motion pictures. Com
pulsory seminars have been or
ganized at Grove for the last
three years.
Activities in Roble Hall are
planned to pursue both academ
ic and somewhat experimental
subjects. "Anthropological In
vestigations into War" is an
example of a seminar which can
be taken for academic credit
(1-3 units) and involves exten
sive reading related to the
study.
Purpose of Study
According to its initiator,
graduate student Pell Fender,
the study was undertaken be
cause "nobody seems to have
bothered to discuss whether
formal armed conflict is pro
grammed in to the species, is
a form of diversion, a product
of envioronment or anything
else (with the exception of Ber
tram! Russell)."
Roble residents also have a
chance to join seminars includ
ing a study of "News as Fact
and Fiction," a study of the
press and where it's going, a
discussion on "Community Psy
chology", and a workshop on
electronic music.
A special experimental Roble
activity is to be a series of
Psyehodrama Marathons". The
Marathon is a group undertak
ing, lasting some 10 hours, in
which participants act out sit
uations from their past, pres

ent, and future, either real or
imagined. This technique was
developed by expert Husein
Chung, who is sending five peo
ple to Roble, and who hopes to
come later himself.
Seminar Creation
Although credit-yielding sem
inars are usually organized by
special tutors in residences,
non - academic house activities,
almost widespread on campus,
are creations of anyone inter
ested.
In addition to numerous work
shops studying art, drama, and
guitar, activities include non
academic subjects ranging from
Soto's candle-making seminar
to Otero's Hatha Yoga stuiy,
in which organizer Bruce Bell
hopes to "turn people on natu
rally".
Another favorite activity of
"Hostility" seminar, during
which participants release ten
sions through punching each
other and dancing to music
such as the Blue Danube Waltz.
Sense Inspiration
In addition to candle-making,
Soto House, organized under
the theme of creativity, has ini
tiated activities for the inspira
tion of the senses.
In its "Olfactory Factory,"
participants are attempting to
develop sensory acuity of the
nose by smelling such provoc
ative substances as freshly-cut
blades of grass, mimeograph
ink, as well as a wide variety of
foods.
Resident A d v i s or Suzanne
Gould explained, "We are try
ing to what feelings
(people attach with different
.smells; grass makes some peo
ple feel frolicsome, while oth
ers think of their childhood.
.Mimeograph ink often reminds
people of junior high school.
, Future Plans
Plans of the Factory in
elude establishing an olfactory
museum, in which substances
.will be displayed for public
.sniffing and will be labelled in
.two ways: first, by the actual
ingredients, and secondly, by
the feelings or nostalgic impres
sions each subject evokes.
Soto has also organized a

music improvisation workshop
in which students get together
with instruments and other
noise-rendering objects in order
to spontaneously create audio
compositions. Several public per
formances are planned.
Through the organization of
house seminars arid study
groups, the Stanford dormitory
is quickly developing centers of
learning and exploration amid
the blatant cries of electric gui
tars and blaring record player
midnight Fresca and popcorn
orgies, in-room soccer tourna
ments, and the fast-travelling
noises of all-night parties.
