# 'Give Birth Control Not Food,' Says Forum Guest
## 
### 
"We should never send food
to the people of a starving coun
try unless that country has a
vigorous program of birth con
trol," a University of California-
Santa Barbara biologist told the
Population and Environment
Forum last night.
Prof. Garrett Hardin of UCSB
told a gathering in Tresidder
Union's large lounge: "In the
long run, this is the kinder
course to pursue, because any
food sent to a non-birth control
ling country will merely in
crease the number of people
who will ultimately starve."

"The kindest gifts we can
give starving countries are lux
uries and contraceptives," he
said. "Men do not live by bread
alone; they need luxuries to
live a good life. By sending them
luxuries we give them motiva
tion to strive for a better life.
Contraceptives make it possible
for them to achieve it."
By the same token, Prof. Har
din added, we should not accept
immigrants from a starving
country unless they have the
skills we need. And immigration
is no solution anyway, he point

If she exported all of them to
Australia, for example, she
would have another 12 million
to export the year following, so
massive is India's birth rate.
"By taking the motto on the
Statue of Liberty seriously
('Bring us your tired, your
poor') we merely spread the
poverty, not the wealth."
The globe is a finite place,
Prof. Hardin emphasized. There
is just so much tillable land,
just so much other resources to
feed and clothe a limited num
ber of people.
