# Lytton Affair
## Protest March Today 
### 
Resisting what they call "in
creasingly more political sup
pression" the Stanford Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS)
have voted to support a rally at
the Medical School today at
noon.
Palo Alto police chief William
Hydie has been invited to attend
but no response on his possible
appearance has been received.
The vote was taken among an
estimated 125 students who met
Monday in Branner Hall in re
sponse to the post-election flare
up which occurred in Lytton
Plaza last Tuesday.
The "confrontation" as it is
being called in publicity leaflets
issued by the Student Faculty
Medical School Committee
Against Political Intimidation
which is sponsoring the meet
ing, will be followed at 4:30 by
a march from the Oval in front
of the Quad at the end of Palm
Drive to the Palo Alto Police
Station.
A list of demands as yet un
known will then be issued to
police.
Following that, marchers will
proceed to Lytton Plaza for a
demonstration against "political
intimidation."
Sapir To Dare Arrest
The meeting at the Medical
School will include among others
Peter Wright a medical resident,
and Marc Sapir against whom
an arrest warrant has been is
sought for failing to "disperse"
at last Tuesday evening's Lytton
'ast Ti es'lay evening's Lytton
Plaza rally. Eight arrests have
been made on the same charge
stemming from the rally.
Sapir said last night that if he
is not arrested by 4:30 he will
march to the police station and
be present at the Lytton Plaza
rally.

Chief Hydie said yesterday
that he would meet representa
tives of the SDS if they had
information they wanted, to give
him, but he would not discuss
anything in a crowd situation or
anything relating to cases pend
ing court action.
He said, in addition, that he
had not been contacted by SDS
about its plans.
Dances Illegal
Asked about the Lytton Plaza
rally, he said the rally would
appear to violate the stated de
sires of the plaza's owners, but
that dance and rally activities
have been tolerated there in the
past until they become noisy and
unruly.
Hydie said the arrests election
night were made after a series
of warnings that activities had
become illegal and the crowd
should disperse.
Today's rally climaxes a series
of events which has seen seven
arrested for failure to disperse
including Stanford English pro
fessor Bruce Franklin, as well
as one arrest for incitement to
riot—a felony. Those arrested
for failure to disperse face sen
tences of up to a year in prison.
Hydie said yesterday that
"several others may be equally
guilty. A few are being checked."
He said in addition that "the
police officers performed admir
ab'y."
When asked about the appear
ance of Sergeant Poso of the
Palo Alto Police department at
a rally on th" Stanford camnus
last week, Hydie said that Poso
was present on his own time and
"not on orders."

BACK TO THE HOSPITAL — Dr. Robert Glaser reflecting on his
brief three month tenure as Stanford's acting President said that
he "enjoyed getting to know some students and hearing their views
on matters of importance to the University." Glaser added, how
ever, that he is looking forward to going back to the Medical School.
