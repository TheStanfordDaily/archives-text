# President's Reflections
## A 						Short Stay On Top 
### SUSAN SWARD 
Dr. Robert Glaser reads avia
tion journals for relaxation.
But the doctor doesn't have
much time for such leisure these
days. Since Glaser became Stan
ford's acting President on Sept.
1, he has actually had two full
time jobs.
He has also kept his title of
vice president for medical af
fairs and dean of the Stanford
University School of Medicine.
When Dr. Pitzer takes over the
Presidency on Dec. 1, Glaser
will assume his position at the
Medical School again. is look
ing forward to going back.
Education
Robert Glaser was educated
in public schools in St. Louis
and University City, Mo. He re
ceived his A.B. degree at Har
vard in 1940 and his M.D. magna
cum Laude in 1943.
Former president of the Af
filiated Hospitals Center in Bos
ton and professor of social med
icine at Harvard Medical School,
Dr. Glaser came to Stanford in
1965.
Of Glaser's three children,
only Robert, Jr., 15, attends
school in the area. He is a soph
omore at Gunn High School. Jo
seph, 16, is a senior at Milton
Academy in Boston. Sally, 18,
graduated from Gunn High
School and now is a freshman
at Radcliffe.
Glaser's wife Helen is also a
physician and is the Assistant
Medical Director of the Stanford
Children's Convalescent Hospi
tal. "She works a pretty long
day, too," Glaser said.
No Spare Time
The doctor himself has little
spare time. Every night when
he comes home from work he
has two or three hours of cor
respondence and "pertinent
reading" to do.
Discussing his role as acting
President of Stanford, Glaser
said, "I feel very strongly that I
should not make long term deci
sions if they can be deferred. I
maintain close association with
Dr. Pitzer. We both feel there is
a need to enhance communica
tion with faculty and students."
The doctor stressed several
times during an interview with

The Daily that he has made
every effort to be available to
members of the Stanford com
munity.
"I have enjoyed getting to
know some students and hear
ing their views on matters of
importance to the University,"
Glaser said.
Communication
If a student-administration
confrontation were to occur
while Dr. Glaser was in office,
he would communicate with stu
dents and faculty. He would also
keep Dr. Pitzer and the Trustees
informed.
Glaser mentioned that some
students attack members of the
Board of Trustees for unfound
ed reasons. The doctor said, "I
am enthusiastic about having
some students and Trustees
meet together informally to cor
rect some of these misconcep
tions."

To Glaser the question of the
University's role in society is a
very important one. According
to the doctor, this role is chang
ing in many people's minds. The
crucial issue is how society will
benefit most in the long run
from the actions of the Univer
sity.
Glaser remarked, "We need a
balanced effort between re
search, teaching and community
involvement which in sum rep
resents a major kind of contri
bution to the society."
Robert Glaser earnestly wants
to avoid a student-administra
tion confrontation this fall. He
believes that by striving to
widen student-administration
communication channels, he is
helping to construct a more pro
gressive universityâ€”a univer
sity where the students' voice in
issues may be more clearly
heard.
