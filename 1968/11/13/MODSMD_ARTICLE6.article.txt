# Nixon Views NATO As Central To Policy
## 
### 
"NATO has a special place" in
President-elect Richard M. Nix
on's thinking about U.S. foreign
policies, according to Richard
V. Allen of the Hoover Institu
tion.
Allen served as Nixon's direc
tor of foreign policy research
during the 1968 campaign and
is considered a top adviser to
the new Chief Executive in mat
ters of defense and international
relations.
Allen cites both strategic and
personal reasons for Nixon's
particular interest in NATO and
other aspects of trans-Atlantic
cooperation in the current issue
of "U.S. News and World Re
port." "As President, Mr. Nixon
will be concerned with all our
commitments. But NATO has a
special place. That is because,
while there will be great prob
lems and pressures in other
parts of the world, the main
axis of activity still will be Eu

rope, the Middle East, and the
Soviet Union."
In reiterating the President
elect's "absolute willingness to
negotiate with the Soviets," Al
len said of any future Washing
ton-Moscow talks, "From our
side, and apart from Vietnam,
two priority items are to cool
down the Middle East and to
head off an upward swing in the
arms race between the Soviets
and ourselves."
On the latter problem, the
Nixon adviser called "agreement
to stop development of antibal
listic missiles" a potentially
fruitful topic of discussions but
warned, "While these negotia
tions proceed, we must continue
our own efforts. What we should
not do is repeat our recent ex
perience, which resulted in los
ing a year in lead-time develop
ment of the antiballistic missile
in hopes that the Soviets would
agree to stop doing what they
already had started to do."
