## On The Election 
### STANLEY COMMONS 
On Monday before the Presi
dential election The Daily urged
members of the Stanford com
munity to refrain from voting
for any of the three major can
didates. And you did so under
the guise of morality. This was
to be expected.
All who crusade for "great
fvtuses" cloak them in the label
<>112 morality. As usual, however,
your position is anything but
moral. In fact, it represents the
grossest kind of immorality.
Why? What constitutes mor
ality? Is it belief in a few sacred
ideas, such as abolition of the
electoral college, control of nu

clear weapons and solution of
the urban problem?
Or is it not real concern for
the welfare of human beings?
Concern for human beings ob
viously manifests itself in sup
port for specific political issues.
But committment to an idea per
se is not morality. Only constant
and undiminished concern for
people is truly moral.
The Daily has decried the im
personal American social, politi
cal, economic and educational
systems which treat human be
ings as anything but humans.
And yet, you commit the very
same crime yourselves. You
have attached yourselves to an
idea of what you think America
ought to be an idea which
you have made just as imper
sonal as "the system." It is im
personal because you pursue it
regardless of the injury your
pursuit may do to other human
beings. Your position on the elec
tion is a perfect example.
I base my criticism of your
stand upon the assumption that
Hubert Humphrey is a better
choice than is Richard Nixon or
George Wallace. He is a better
choice not because he is the mor
al leader needed so desperately
by this country —- he is not —
but because in terms of human
welfare, he will do more good.
Granted, Hubert Humphrey is
no more than a holding action.
With Humphrey as President,
the United States will not be

turned over night into paradise,
by any stretch of the imagina
tion. But fewer people will go
hungry; fewer dropouts will go
without assistance; fewer jobless
will remain so.
Remember the California gu
bernatoiral election of 1966? Ed
mund Brown wasn't progressive
enough for California Demo
crats. So the thing to do was re
frain from voting. And because
there was "no difference between
Brown and Reagan," the Univer
sity of California, and hence its
students, are suffering immea
surable damage.
Because there was "no differ
ence," thousands of mental
health patients will not receive
anything near adequate help. Be
cause there was "no difference,"
icompensatory education for
Mexican - American and black
children was abolished it was the
most progressive program in
the country), welfare programs
were cut, bills to improve the
horribly inadequate employment
and vocational education pro
grams were vetoed.
"It is too late," your editorial
said on Monday, "to accept the
least of three evils. It happened
in 1964. It has happened in
1968." So from your narrow per
spective of time and events, the
world has come to an end. You
can pick up your bag and leave.
Unfortunately, those millions
who are poor and uneducated
cannot pick up and leave. They
are stuck. And if, in our moral
arrogance, we refuse to do all
that we can within the available
alternatives to make their lives
a little better, they will suffer for
it. And we will be moral.

didates. And you did so under
the guise of morality. This was
to be expected.
All who crusade for "great
fvtuses" cloak them in the label
<>112 morality. As usual, however,
your position is anything but
moral. In fact, it represents the
grossest kind of immorality.
Why? What constitutes mor
ality? Is it belief in a few sacred
ideas, such as abolition of the
electoral college, control of nu

clear weapons and solution of
the urban problem?
Or is it not real concern for
the welfare of human beings?
Concern for human beings ob
viously manifests itself in sup
port for specific political issues.
But committment to an idea per
se is not morality. Only constant
and undiminished concern for
people is truly moral.
The Daily has decried the im
personal American social, politi
cal, economic and educational
systems which treat human be
ings as anything but humans.
And yet, you commit the very
same crime yourselves. You
have attached yourselves to an
idea of what you think America
ought to be an idea which
you have made just as imper
sonal as "the system." It is im
personal because you pursue it
regardless of the injury your
pursuit may do to other human
beings. Your position on the elec
tion is a perfect example.
I base my criticism of your
stand upon the assumption that
Hubert Humphrey is a better
choice than is Richard Nixon or
George Wallace. He is a better
choice not because he is the mor
al leader needed so desperately
by this country —- he is not —
but because in terms of human
welfare, he will do more good.
Granted, Hubert Humphrey is
no more than a holding action.
With Humphrey as President,
the United States will not be

turned over night into paradise,
by any stretch of the imagina
tion. But fewer people will go
hungry; fewer dropouts will go
without assistance; fewer jobless
will remain so.
Remember the California gu
bernatoiral election of 1966? Ed
mund Brown wasn't progressive
enough for California Demo
crats. So the thing to do was re
frain from voting. And because
there was "no difference between
Brown and Reagan," the Univer
sity of California, and hence its
students, are suffering immea
surable damage.
Because there was "no differ
ence," thousands of mental
health patients will not receive
anything near adequate help. Be
cause there was "no difference,"
icompensatory education for
Mexican - American and black
children was abolished it was the
most progressive program in
the country), welfare programs
were cut, bills to improve the
horribly inadequate employment
and vocational education pro
grams were vetoed.
"It is too late," your editorial
said on Monday, "to accept the
least of three evils. It happened
in 1964. It has happened in
1968." So from your narrow per
spective of time and events, the
world has come to an end. You
can pick up your bag and leave.
Unfortunately, those millions
who are poor and uneducated
cannot pick up and leave. They
are stuck. And if, in our moral
arrogance, we refuse to do all
that we can within the available
alternatives to make their lives
a little better, they will suffer for
it. And we will be moral.
On Monday before the Presi
