There can be little doubt that the University's 350 graduate
students who absorb a large part of the little-wanted burden of
teaching undergraduates receive an extremely bad deal from the
University. Salaries are at the poverty level ($2300 plus $1100
in tuition credit), fringe benefits are nonexistent, they are told
not to gain additional employment, and they often sacrifice
steady progress toward their degrees to spend 20 hours or more
per week leading sections, grading papers, and marking exams.
It is dismaying that the university conference room has been
turned into a back , room of union-management gutter fighting,
broadsides, innuendoes, accusations, thrusts and parrys, and
ultimata.
This is the atmosphere that now pervades the negotiations be
tween teaching assistants (TA's) and University administrators
over salary increases for the overburdened and underpaid TA's
from several departments.
Administrators as well as the representatives of the teaching
assistants from the political science, anthropology, and English
departments agree that the plight of the teaching graduate stu
dent is at present far from satisfactory. Both groups realize the
impossibility of working as a TA, continuing studies, providing
for basic human needs, and perhaps even raising a family, all
on a nine-month income of $2300. The need for immediate relief
in the form of across-the-board salary increases is obvious.
The situation is complicated, however, by two factors. First,
there are enormous inequalities in the amount of work required
of teaching assistants within the different departments. While
the freshman English TA spends long hours leading classes and
seminars, reading themes, and meeting individually with his
freshmen, the TA in some departments is asked only to grade
an occasional homework assignment. TA's of one department,
in fact, do absolutely no work in exchange for their depart
ment's TA stipends, treating the TA funds as merely a fellowship.
Inequities such as these make more than clear the necessity
of a full-blown review by an appropriate body, such as the Aca
demic Senate, of the policies of individual departments in order
that a standardized set of requirements might be instituted.
Second, the legitimate claims of these graduate students for an

immediate rise in compensation is being lost in a cloud of charge
and countercharge in the manner of union and management.
Vice Provost E. Howard Brooks and his negotiating assistants
knew quite well that their proposal of a salary increase of $4(X)
for the next academic year would be flatly rejected at Monday's
TA-Administration session. Yet he put forth that proposal any
way, secure in the knowledge that the TA negotiators would
turn up their noses at it, rattle a few sabers, and send the ad
ministrators back to make a more "reasonable" counterproposal.
This year s budget that could yield "not a nickel" two weeks ago
will now undoubtedly be magically squeezed so that a large
enough stipend increase to avert a threatened Nov. 31 TA strike
will pop forth.
Both groups need to cast off the mantle of confrontation and
mutual distrust and get down to the real problems at hand: the
deprived condition of the working graduate student and the in
equalities so apparent from one department to the next.
For Brooks and his colleagues, a precise statement of the
University's financial situation, the possible sources of increased
stipends for this year, and an honest evaluation of the Univer
sities priorities will move future discussions out of the realm of
confrontation into a more academic dissection of how best to
quickly correct the injustice done to a number of graduate stu
dents providing an invaluable service to the university.
Political science TA Richard Young and his fellow graduate
students have brought before the University powers a situation
that they clearly demonstrated cannot be continued. Their de
mands for a $700 raise in yearly salary plus a dependent allow
ance are minimal and past due and we approve of their well
conceived efforts to bring attention to their exploited situation.
But to lose sight of their goals in talk of strike and negotiating
deadlines and confrontation politics would indeed be a shame.
The skills of the conference table are an essential part of a rea
soned solution.
Both groups in this recent debate have demonstrated interest
in settling their differences through reasoned debate and open
discussion. As soon as University officials state clearly and hon
estly what they can reasonably do to aid the human resource of
the working graduate student, talk of union retribution can be
delegated back to the history books.
Any other manner of dealing with this volatile problem could
be a costly mistake.

enough stipend increase to avert a threatened Nov. 31 TA strike
will pop forth.
Both groups need to cast off the mantle of confrontation and
mutual distrust and get down to the real problems at hand: the
deprived condition of the working graduate student and the in
equalities so apparent from one department to the next.
For Brooks and his colleagues, a precise statement of the
University's financial situation, the possible sources of increased
stipends for this year, and an honest evaluation of the Univer
sities priorities will move future discussions out of the realm of
confrontation into a more academic dissection of how best to
quickly correct the injustice done to a number of graduate stu
dents providing an invaluable service to the university.
Political science TA Richard Young and his fellow graduate
students have brought before the University powers a situation
that they clearly demonstrated cannot be continued. Their de
mands for a $700 raise in yearly salary plus a dependent allow
ance are minimal and past due and we approve of their well
conceived efforts to bring attention to their exploited situation.
But to lose sight of their goals in talk of strike and negotiating
deadlines and confrontation politics would indeed be a shame.
The skills of the conference table are an essential part of a rea
soned solution.
Both groups in this recent debate have demonstrated interest
in settling their differences through reasoned debate and open
discussion. As soon as University officials state clearly and hon
estly what they can reasonably do to aid the human resource of
the working graduate student, talk of union retribution can be
delegated back to the history books.
Any other manner of dealing with this volatile problem could
be a costly mistake.
There can be little doubt that the University's 350 graduate
students who absorb a large part of the little-wanted burden of
teaching undergraduates receive an extremely bad deal from the
University. Salaries are at the poverty level ($2300 plus $1100
in tuition credit), fringe benefits are nonexistent, they are told
not to gain additional employment, and they often sacrifice
steady progress toward their degrees to spend 20 hours or more
per week leading sections, grading papers, and marking exams.
It is dismaying that the university conference room has been
turned into a back , room of union-management gutter fighting,
broadsides, innuendoes, accusations, thrusts and parrys, and
ultimata.
This is the atmosphere that now pervades the negotiations be
tween teaching assistants (TA's) and University administrators
over salary increases for the overburdened and underpaid TA's
from several departments.
Administrators as well as the representatives of the teaching
assistants from the political science, anthropology, and English
departments agree that the plight of the teaching graduate stu
dent is at present far from satisfactory. Both groups realize the
impossibility of working as a TA, continuing studies, providing
for basic human needs, and perhaps even raising a family, all
on a nine-month income of $2300. The need for immediate relief
in the form of across-the-board salary increases is obvious.
The situation is complicated, however, by two factors. First,
there are enormous inequalities in the amount of work required
of teaching assistants within the different departments. While
the freshman English TA spends long hours leading classes and
seminars, reading themes, and meeting individually with his
freshmen, the TA in some departments is asked only to grade
an occasional homework assignment. TA's of one department,
in fact, do absolutely no work in exchange for their depart
ment's TA stipends, treating the TA funds as merely a fellowship.
Inequities such as these make more than clear the necessity
of a full-blown review by an appropriate body, such as the Aca
demic Senate, of the policies of individual departments in order
that a standardized set of requirements might be instituted.
Second, the legitimate claims of these graduate students for an

immediate rise in compensation is being lost in a cloud of charge
and countercharge in the manner of union and management.
Vice Provost E. Howard Brooks and his negotiating assistants
knew quite well that their proposal of a salary increase of $4(X)
for the next academic year would be flatly rejected at Monday's
TA-Administration session. Yet he put forth that proposal any
way, secure in the knowledge that the TA negotiators would
turn up their noses at it, rattle a few sabers, and send the ad
ministrators back to make a more "reasonable" counterproposal.
