# 'some of my best friends are conservatives'—Napier
## 
### SUSAN SWARD 
"Some of my best friends are
conservatives and always have
been," Dean Napier said rec
ently.
"There is not a week that goes
by where I don't talk to one or
more conservatives who are crit
ical of what they deem are in
adequacies in my chapel per
formance. Most of these people

are not totally negative," the
Dean of the Chapel added.
Napier, the son of mission
aries, was born in Kuling, China,
in 1915. He went to school in
Shanghai and in Kobe, Japan.
He graduated from Howard Uni
versity in 1936 and from Yale
Divinity School in 1939. He be
came an ordained minister in
the Congregational Church the
same year.
The Dean came to Stanford as
Dean of the Chapel in July of
1966 from Yale University.
In an interview with the
Dally, Napier said, "I was doing
hit-and-run preaching at Yale.
That was one of the reasons I
came to Stanford. Here I am
available to anyone who wants
to come talk to me.
Discussing some of the critic
ism he receives for making pol
itical references in his sermons,
Napier noted, "This may be ar
rogance, but I see myself as
obligated to a prophetic tradi
tion. I think the great voices of
religion have been prophetic,
and this tradition requires tak
ing side on issues."
"What is a man to do?" Na
pier asked. "He will be dishing
out mush if he says nothing

that is controversial to someone.
Jesus and the Prophets were
revolutionaries."
In defense of the use of non
clergy in the chapel service,
Napier stated, 'The university
chapel is an appropriate place
for any word that is in support
of humanity. If any one of my
colleagues speaks In this fash
ion, then I am in favor of letting
him speak in the chapel. I deny

any notion that only ordained
persons are fit to speak in a
university chapel."
Focusing on his successes
since he has come to Stanford,
Napier said, "I am enormously
gratified by the attendance at
university public service. If any
thing, coming into my third year
here, attendance has picked up.
I don't attribute this only to my
self, but also to the care with
which I pick guest speakers. I

won't let anyone speak here
whose power to speak meaning
fully to the university commun
ity has not been proved."
One problem Napier has is
a personal one: he is "thin-skin
ned" and cannot easily brush
aside criticism.
"I wish I had developed thick
er callouses over the years,"
Napier mused. "My position is
such that I am exposed on the

full 360 degrees." Napier em
phasized, however, that he had
always had support where it
was most crucial. "My work at
Stanford," Napier continued,
"has been more exciffng and
fundamentally more rewarding
than any job I have ever had."
Napier went on to point out
that he makes a distinction be
tween the words "church" and
"chapel".
In a sermon last year Napier

said, "We meet in a building
called Memorial Church, but. we
are not a church, and we ought
not to try to be a church. We
function rather, and properly, as
a University chapel."
Napier maintains that the
chapel at Stanford is not a dead
institution.
"The chapel serves a commun
ity of learners that is much
more broadly sensitive than the

world in which they live. The
university public worship on
Sundays at 11 a.m. comes closer
than any other regular function
of the university to being a
celebration of what we are and
what we could be."
Student reaction to Napier is
varied. Individuals in the uni
versity community who are crit
ical of Napier seem to have two
major criticisms.
One is that Napier is not

using the church service for its
proper function — traditional
worship of the Almighty. Har
vey Hukari, a Daily columnist
who has been critical of Napier,
suggested in one of his articles
that Napier should have a ques
tion and answer period after
every sermon.
Napier's reaction to this critic
ism is that he is not one-sided.
"It is not feasible to engage in
open dialogue in the church, so
I have to depend on my own
open stand," he said.
Another criticism of Napier is
that he is trying too hard to be
"in" with students. For example,
Napier's effect of playing the
Beatles or Simon and Garfunkel
during some sermons is looked
upon as pure technique—de
signed to win student approval
and adoration of the Dean.
Napier's response to this criti
cism is that the students have
higher esthetic demands than
people in the average parish
church. They appreciate the
sound techniques that Napier
implements.
The students who are favor
able to Napier seem to respect
him greatly. As one senior in
Lambda Nu who is close to Na
pier said, "It is a matter of trust.

I trust Napier. He is one of the
few men I would leave every
thing for and follow him if he
asked me to."
Harvey Hukari called Napier
"the Sacred Cow of the Stanford
Liberal Establishment." Many
students favorable to Napier and
to what he is trying to do with
the church on campus do not be
lieve this. There is a suspicion
among some of these students
that there is going to be a "get
Napier" drive this year by some
of the more conservative ele
ments of the university.
As a sophomore in Serra said,
"Many students don't go to
church, but they know of Na
pier. If there is an attempt to get
Napier this year because of his
politics, these students will show
their support of the Dean."
Dean Napier himself spoke
about his political orientation
last year in a sermon.
"This country has reared me,"
he said. "It is this country which
had made possible my own ful
fillment of true vocation. Now I
think, in certain respects more
than in others, its present prac
tices and policies stink . . . But
it is still my country . . . and I
*m no more going to split with
it than I am with ray own son."

"Some of my best friends are
conservatives and always have
been," Dean Napier said rec
ently.
"There is not a week that goes
by where I don't talk to one or
more conservatives who are crit
ical of what they deem are in
adequacies in my chapel per
formance. Most of these people

are not totally negative," the
Dean of the Chapel added.
Napier, the son of mission
aries, was born in Kuling, China,
in 1915. He went to school in
Shanghai and in Kobe, Japan.
He graduated from Howard Uni
versity in 1936 and from Yale
Divinity School in 1939. He be
came an ordained minister in
the Congregational Church the
same year.
The Dean came to Stanford as
Dean of the Chapel in July of
1966 from Yale University.
In an interview with the
Dally, Napier said, "I was doing
hit-and-run preaching at Yale.
That was one of the reasons I
came to Stanford. Here I am
available to anyone who wants
to come talk to me.
Discussing some of the critic
ism he receives for making pol
itical references in his sermons,
Napier noted, "This may be ar
rogance, but I see myself as
obligated to a prophetic tradi
tion. I think the great voices of
religion have been prophetic,
and this tradition requires tak
ing side on issues."
"What is a man to do?" Na
pier asked. "He will be dishing
out mush if he says nothing

that is controversial to someone.
Jesus and the Prophets were
revolutionaries."
In defense of the use of non
clergy in the chapel service,
Napier stated, 'The university
chapel is an appropriate place
for any word that is in support
of humanity. If any one of my
colleagues speaks In this fash
ion, then I am in favor of letting
him speak in the chapel. I deny

any notion that only ordained
persons are fit to speak in a
university chapel."
Focusing on his successes
since he has come to Stanford,
Napier said, "I am enormously
gratified by the attendance at
university public service. If any
thing, coming into my third year
here, attendance has picked up.
I don't attribute this only to my
self, but also to the care with
which I pick guest speakers. I

won't let anyone speak here
whose power to speak meaning
fully to the university commun
ity has not been proved."
One problem Napier has is
a personal one: he is "thin-skin
ned" and cannot easily brush
aside criticism.
"I wish I had developed thick
er callouses over the years,"
Napier mused. "My position is
such that I am exposed on the

full 360 degrees." Napier em
phasized, however, that he had
always had support where it
was most crucial. "My work at
Stanford," Napier continued,
"has been more exciffng and
fundamentally more rewarding
than any job I have ever had."
Napier went on to point out
that he makes a distinction be
tween the words "church" and
"chapel".
In a sermon last year Napier

said, "We meet in a building
called Memorial Church, but. we
are not a church, and we ought
not to try to be a church. We
function rather, and properly, as
a University chapel."
Napier maintains that the
chapel at Stanford is not a dead
institution.
"The chapel serves a commun
ity of learners that is much
more broadly sensitive than the

world in which they live. The
university public worship on
Sundays at 11 a.m. comes closer
than any other regular function
of the university to being a
celebration of what we are and
what we could be."
Student reaction to Napier is
varied. Individuals in the uni
versity community who are crit
ical of Napier seem to have two
major criticisms.
One is that Napier is not

using the church service for its
proper function — traditional
worship of the Almighty. Har
vey Hukari, a Daily columnist
who has been critical of Napier,
suggested in one of his articles
that Napier should have a ques
tion and answer period after
every sermon.
Napier's reaction to this critic
ism is that he is not one-sided.
"It is not feasible to engage in
open dialogue in the church, so
I have to depend on my own
open stand," he said.
Another criticism of Napier is
that he is trying too hard to be
"in" with students. For example,
Napier's effect of playing the
Beatles or Simon and Garfunkel
during some sermons is looked
upon as pure technique—de
signed to win student approval
and adoration of the Dean.
Napier's response to this criti
cism is that the students have
higher esthetic demands than
people in the average parish
church. They appreciate the
sound techniques that Napier
implements.
The students who are favor
able to Napier seem to respect
him greatly. As one senior in
Lambda Nu who is close to Na
pier said, "It is a matter of trust.

I trust Napier. He is one of the
few men I would leave every
thing for and follow him if he
asked me to."
Harvey Hukari called Napier
"the Sacred Cow of the Stanford
Liberal Establishment." Many
students favorable to Napier and
to what he is trying to do with
the church on campus do not be
lieve this. There is a suspicion
among some of these students
that there is going to be a "get
Napier" drive this year by some
of the more conservative ele
ments of the university.
As a sophomore in Serra said,
"Many students don't go to
church, but they know of Na
pier. If there is an attempt to get
Napier this year because of his
politics, these students will show
their support of the Dean."
Dean Napier himself spoke
about his political orientation
last year in a sermon.
"This country has reared me,"
he said. "It is this country which
had made possible my own ful
fillment of true vocation. Now I
think, in certain respects more
than in others, its present prac
tices and policies stink . . . But
it is still my country . . . and I
*m no more going to split with
it than I am with ray own son."

"Some of my best friends are
conservatives and always have
been," Dean Napier said rec
ently.
"There is not a week that goes
by where I don't talk to one or
more conservatives who are crit
ical of what they deem are in
adequacies in my chapel per
formance. Most of these people

are not totally negative," the
Dean of the Chapel added.
Napier, the son of mission
aries, was born in Kuling, China,
in 1915. He went to school in
Shanghai and in Kobe, Japan.
He graduated from Howard Uni
versity in 1936 and from Yale
Divinity School in 1939. He be
came an ordained minister in
the Congregational Church the
same year.
The Dean came to Stanford as
Dean of the Chapel in July of
1966 from Yale University.
In an interview with the
Dally, Napier said, "I was doing
hit-and-run preaching at Yale.
That was one of the reasons I
came to Stanford. Here I am
available to anyone who wants
to come talk to me.
Discussing some of the critic
ism he receives for making pol
itical references in his sermons,
Napier noted, "This may be ar
rogance, but I see myself as
obligated to a prophetic tradi
tion. I think the great voices of
religion have been prophetic,
and this tradition requires tak
ing side on issues."
"What is a man to do?" Na
pier asked. "He will be dishing
out mush if he says nothing

that is controversial to someone.
Jesus and the Prophets were
revolutionaries."
In defense of the use of non
clergy in the chapel service,
Napier stated, 'The university
chapel is an appropriate place
for any word that is in support
of humanity. If any one of my
colleagues speaks In this fash
ion, then I am in favor of letting
him speak in the chapel. I deny

any notion that only ordained
persons are fit to speak in a
university chapel."
Focusing on his successes
since he has come to Stanford,
Napier said, "I am enormously
gratified by the attendance at
university public service. If any
thing, coming into my third year
here, attendance has picked up.
I don't attribute this only to my
self, but also to the care with
which I pick guest speakers. I

won't let anyone speak here
whose power to speak meaning
fully to the university commun
ity has not been proved."
One problem Napier has is
a personal one: he is "thin-skin
ned" and cannot easily brush
aside criticism.
"I wish I had developed thick
er callouses over the years,"
Napier mused. "My position is
such that I am exposed on the

full 360 degrees." Napier em
phasized, however, that he had
always had support where it
was most crucial. "My work at
Stanford," Napier continued,
"has been more exciffng and
fundamentally more rewarding
than any job I have ever had."
Napier went on to point out
that he makes a distinction be
tween the words "church" and
"chapel".
In a sermon last year Napier

said, "We meet in a building
called Memorial Church, but. we
are not a church, and we ought
not to try to be a church. We
function rather, and properly, as
a University chapel."
Napier maintains that the
chapel at Stanford is not a dead
institution.
"The chapel serves a commun
ity of learners that is much
more broadly sensitive than the

world in which they live. The
university public worship on
Sundays at 11 a.m. comes closer
than any other regular function
of the university to being a
celebration of what we are and
what we could be."
Student reaction to Napier is
varied. Individuals in the uni
versity community who are crit
ical of Napier seem to have two
major criticisms.
One is that Napier is not

using the church service for its
proper function — traditional
worship of the Almighty. Har
vey Hukari, a Daily columnist
who has been critical of Napier,
suggested in one of his articles
that Napier should have a ques
tion and answer period after
every sermon.
Napier's reaction to this critic
ism is that he is not one-sided.
"It is not feasible to engage in
open dialogue in the church, so
I have to depend on my own
open stand," he said.
Another criticism of Napier is
that he is trying too hard to be
"in" with students. For example,
Napier's effect of playing the
Beatles or Simon and Garfunkel
during some sermons is looked
upon as pure technique—de
signed to win student approval
and adoration of the Dean.
Napier's response to this criti
cism is that the students have
higher esthetic demands than
people in the average parish
church. They appreciate the
sound techniques that Napier
implements.
The students who are favor
able to Napier seem to respect
him greatly. As one senior in
Lambda Nu who is close to Na
pier said, "It is a matter of trust.

I trust Napier. He is one of the
few men I would leave every
thing for and follow him if he
asked me to."
Harvey Hukari called Napier
"the Sacred Cow of the Stanford
Liberal Establishment." Many
students favorable to Napier and
to what he is trying to do with
the church on campus do not be
lieve this. There is a suspicion
among some of these students
that there is going to be a "get
Napier" drive this year by some
of the more conservative ele
ments of the university.
As a sophomore in Serra said,
"Many students don't go to
church, but they know of Na
pier. If there is an attempt to get
Napier this year because of his
politics, these students will show
their support of the Dean."
Dean Napier himself spoke
about his political orientation
last year in a sermon.
"This country has reared me,"
he said. "It is this country which
had made possible my own ful
fillment of true vocation. Now I
think, in certain respects more
than in others, its present prac
tices and policies stink . . . But
it is still my country . . . and I
