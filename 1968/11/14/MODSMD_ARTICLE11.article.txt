# Management At Work
## Internship Offered 
### CRAIG WILSON 
Started four years ago by a
group of students who were
alarmed at the stereotype of
"dull" "impersonal", and profit
eering" the Stanford Manage
ment Intern Program (SMIP) is
back again offering well paid
summer jobs and the opportun
ity to crack the big business
myth.
The program which has set its
annual orientation program for
Thursday at 4 p.m. in the Tre
sidder Large Lounge is spon
sored by the ASSU in coopera
tion with more than two dozen
major corporations and financial
institutions.
The program gives close view
of management at work and
parallels the successful Stan
ford - in - Washington program,
run by the Alumni Association,
which now sends about 100 stu
dents to work every summer
with Congressmen and federal
agencies.

According to Brooke Seawell,
Director of the program, "the
essential role is to find a place
of responsibility and challenge
for an intern in the corporate
structure with a goal toward
allowing the intern to observe,
study and participate to the best
of his ability in a business at
mosphere.'
He emphasizes that the "edu
cational experience" for those
involved is the most important
aspect of the program.
"The characteristics of the in
dividual company will determine
the exact substance of the in
tern's work. An intern is not,
and should not be, a prima
donna. As a temporary em
ployee of the company, he is

there to be useful; he asks, how
ever, for participation on a level
which will introduce him to the
challenges and demands of
management."
Screening Process
The program utilizes a simple
process of screening in which
applicants are interviewed on
campus and funneled into di
visions based on geographic, de
partmental, and organizational
preference.
Following this representatives
from each company visit the
campus and make final decisions
on students they wish to em
ploy.
Earnings for management in
terns range generally between
$400-$6OO per month, but, as
Seawell stresses, the ultimate
reason for entering the program
is not the salary.
Better View
The program is set up to give
students a much better view of
business for 10-12 weeks over
the summer to investigate the
challenges—and shortcomings—
afforded by careers in business
before reaching their own career
decisions.
General criteria for accept
ances as an intern candidate are
that the applicant be an under
graduate, and generally a Lib
eral Arts major with high lead
ership potential. Further judg
ments are made for high aca
demic ability, interest and initi
ative, ability to write and speak
well, and suitability of character
and personality.
Most SMIP interns, at least
based on past experience, are
juniors who thus return to Stan
ford for a full year. It is under
stood however that those appli
cants who according to Seawell

"obviously are not qualified to
participate will not be accepted."
Last year ten applicants were
turned down for that reason.
The program generally is one
for the higher income bracket
students. In spite of the high
salaries, costs of board and
room offset income, and make
experience the true profit of
those participating.
In the past some efforts have
been made to help those who
cannot afford work for experi
ence. But generally Seawell says
such efforts cannot be made to
make it "a major part of the
program."
Students and business firms
have all reacted well to the pro
gram. For students it has ac
complished its objectives almost
completely. They get a chance to
find out what a business career
might entail. As for the partici
pating companies, they get a
job done during the summer
(usually at a pretty high level),
they perform something of a
public service and, most im
portant of all, they come into
contact with—and have a chance
to evaluate—a potential em
ployee. For intern and company,
its a face-to-face confrontation
that pays for both.

Students and business firms
have all reacted well to the pro

Started four years ago by a

alarmed at the stereotype of
"dull" "impersonal", and profit

back again offering well paid
summer jobs and the opportun
ity to crack the big business
myth.
The program which has set its
annual orientation program for
Thursday at 4 p.m. in the Tre
sidder Large Lounge is spon
sored by the ASSU in coopera
tion with more than two dozen
major corporations and financial
institutions.
The program gives close view
of management at work and
parallels the successful Stan
ford - in - Washington program,
run by the Alumni Association,
which now sends about 100 stu
dents to work every summer
with Congressmen and federal
agencies.

According to Brooke Seawell,
Director of the program, "the
essential role is to find a place
of responsibility and challenge
for an intern in the corporate
structure with a goal toward
allowing the intern to observe,
study and participate to the best
of his ability in a business at
mosphere.'
He emphasizes that the "edu
cational experience" for those
involved is the most important
aspect of the program.
"The characteristics of the in
dividual company will determine
the exact substance of the in
tern's work. An intern is not,
and should not be, a prima
donna. As a temporary em
ployee of the company, he is

there to be useful; he asks, how
ever, for participation on a level
which will introduce him to the
challenges and demands of
management."
Screening Process
The program utilizes a simple
process of screening in which
applicants are interviewed on
campus and funneled into di
visions based on geographic, de
partmental, and organizational
preference.
Following this representatives
from each company visit the
campus and make final decisions
on students they wish to em
ploy.
Earnings for management in
terns range generally between
$400-$6OO per month, but, as
Seawell stresses, the ultimate
reason for entering the program
is not the salary.
Better View
The program is set up to give
students a much better view of
business for 10-12 weeks over
the summer to investigate the
challenges—and shortcomings—
afforded by careers in business
before reaching their own career
decisions.
General criteria for accept
ances as an intern candidate are
that the applicant be an under
graduate, and generally a Lib
eral Arts major with high lead
ership potential. Further judg
ments are made for high aca
demic ability, interest and initi
ative, ability to write and speak
well, and suitability of character
and personality.
Most SMIP interns, at least
based on past experience, are
juniors who thus return to Stan
ford for a full year. It is under
stood however that those appli
cants who according to Seawell

"obviously are not qualified to
participate will not be accepted."
Last year ten applicants were
turned down for that reason.
The program generally is one
for the higher income bracket
students. In spite of the high
salaries, costs of board and
room offset income, and make
experience the true profit of
those participating.
