# Exile Describes Czech Economy
## 
### ANN DENTON 
Exiled Eugen Lobl, the man
who was second in command in
the economic reform of Czecho
slovakia before the Russians en
tered, spoke Tuesday before a
Tresidder crowd of fifty people
on the topic "Marxism, Commu
nism, and Eastern Europe."
Lobl, who left the country dur
ing the Russian invasion, was
previously sentenced to life im
prisonment in the anti-Semitic
trials held in 1949. He served 12
years of his sentence and was
then "rehabilitated."
Lobl's lecture consisted of
three main points. He empha
sized his opinion that in highly
industrialized countries the key
difference between economies is
not the form of ownership, but
the difference in the level of in
tellectual development.
Lobl implied that the social,
economic and political systems
that now exist in Eastern Eu
rope are not true socialism. The
effect of the present system has
been to concentrate ownership
in the hands of a very small
elite.
The implication was that what
was happening in Czechoslova
kia before the invasion by the
Soviet Union was really a form
of social revolution in which the

control of the means of produc
tion was being transferred to a
new and larger social class.
The third point in Lobl's thesis
was that the intelligentsia is the
key to economic and social de
velopment in the more devel
oped states of both Eastern Eu
rope and the capitalist world.
According to Lobl, if the intel
lectuals are not allowed to fol
low their own paths, the eco
nomic and social life of devel
oped countries will stagnate.
In the question and answer pe
riod that followed the speech,
Lobl several times attacked capi
talism and defended the role of
the intellectuals.
He further stated, "The great
est shortcoming in the capitalist
world is looking at economic
problems as only economic prob
lems. An economy should be
based on the problem of man;
it should be looked at from the
human aspect—how it affects
cultural and private life."
Projecting into the future,
Lobl reasons, "Neither capital
ism nor the proletariat can lead
the world. It is up to the intelli
gentsia—or else the rest of the
world will have to face the same
fate as we (in Czechoslovakia)
face today."

kia before the invasion by the
Soviet Union was really a form
of social revolution in which the

control of the means of produc
tion was being transferred to a
new and larger social class.
The third point in Lobl's thesis
was that the intelligentsia is the
key to economic and social de
velopment in the more devel
oped states of both Eastern Eu
rope and the capitalist world.
According to Lobl, if the intel
lectuals are not allowed to fol
low their own paths, the eco
nomic and social life of devel
oped countries will stagnate.
In the question and answer pe
riod that followed the speech,
Lobl several times attacked capi
talism and defended the role of
the intellectuals.
He further stated, "The great
est shortcoming in the capitalist
world is looking at economic
problems as only economic prob
lems. An economy should be
based on the problem of man;
it should be looked at from the
human aspect—how it affects
cultural and private life."
Projecting into the future,
Lobl reasons, "Neither capital
ism nor the proletariat can lead
the world. It is up to the intelli
gentsia—or else the rest of the
world will have to face the same
fate as we (in Czechoslovakia)
face today."
Exiled Eugen Lobl, the man
who was second in command in
the economic reform of Czecho
slovakia before the Russians en
tered, spoke Tuesday before a
Tresidder crowd of fifty people
on the topic "Marxism, Commu
nism, and Eastern Europe."
Lobl, who left the country dur
ing the Russian invasion, was
previously sentenced to life im
prisonment in the anti-Semitic
trials held in 1949. He served 12
years of his sentence and was
then "rehabilitated."
Lobl's lecture consisted of
three main points. He empha
sized his opinion that in highly
industrialized countries the key
difference between economies is
not the form of ownership, but
the difference in the level of in
tellectual development.
Lobl implied that the social,
economic and political systems
that now exist in Eastern Eu
rope are not true socialism. The
effect of the present system has
been to concentrate ownership
in the hands of a very small
elite.
The implication was that what
was happening in Czechoslova
kia before the invasion by the
Soviet Union was really a form
of social revolution in which the

control of the means of produc
tion was being transferred to a
new and larger social class.
