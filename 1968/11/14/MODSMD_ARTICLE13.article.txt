# "Funny Thing‚Äù To Happen On The Way To Big Game
## 
### NANCY ETTENHEIM 
Sex is to be the subject of the
Big Game show being presented
this year by the Mafia. Are they
featuring Dr. Kinsey? Not real
ly. Perhaps on a lighter vein is
their production of "A Funny
Thing Happened on the Way to
the Forum."
This show, unlike past Big
Game productions, is a bona
fide Broadway hit, which has
been unchanged for its produc
tion at Stanford. "Funny Thing"
will be presented on the four
nights preceding Big Game.
To Replace "Gaieties"
This season's Big Game Show
was originally scheduled to be
a Ram's Head production of
"Gaieties", but the show never
materialized.
When asked why the Mafia is
presenting this year's show, Di
rector Robert Walter stated,
"Because I believe that theatre
is a ritual which draws all ele
ments of a community together,
I was particularly distressed at
the possibility that the Big
Game show might die this
year."
In order to produce this show,
the Mafia was granted a loan
of $5000 from the ASSU treas
ury.

The Mafia is a core group of
between 30 and 40 Master of
Fine Arts Candidates in the
Speech and Drama Department.
These grad students also pro
duce the Midnight Mafia, a.week
ly presentation of short plays,
which is held in the Nitery on
Saturday evenings at 11:30.
Experienced Cast
Despite a lack of adequate
time, the cast of "Funny Thing"
boasts a number of highly ex
perienced members. Leading the
show and playing the role of
Pseudolus, a clever slave bent
on gaining his freedom, is Ste
phen Jay Book. Book, who is a
second year grad student in di
recting, was the director of last
year's highly successful "Roar
of the Grease Paint, Smell of
the Crowd." He also was in the
recent Palo Alto Community
Theatre's production of "Enter
Laughing." In addition, Book
has had both acting and direc
torial experience on Broadway.
The leading female role, Phil
ia, is being played by Gretchen
Grant, who has also been active
in "Gaieties", and a number of
other Ram's Head productions,

including "Roar of the Grease
Paint" and "Carnival." She is a
second year MFA candidate in
acting.
Roger Kozol, who recently
starred in the SRT production of
"Andromache" is producing this
Big Game Show. Kozol, along
with Musical t Director, Robert
Hoffman are both first year grad
students, who spent their under
grad years at Harvard.
Light Comedy
"Funny Thing" is much in
keeping with the traditional Big
Game shows, in that it is a light
comic performance. According
to Director Walter, the show is
"rowdy, fast-paced, and quite
contemporary in its treatment
of sex."
Performances of "Funny
Thing" are on November 19, 20,
21, and 22 at Memorial Audito
rium, at 8:30 p.m. Tickets are
available at Tresidder Box Of
fice, Memorial Auditorium, and
will be on sale in White Plaza
next week. In addition to group
rates for groups of over 25, spe
cial discount rates are in effect
for student tickets for perform
ances on November 19 and 20.

Despite a lack of adequate
time, the cast of "Funny Thing"
boasts a number of highly ex
perienced members. Leading the
show and playing the role of
Pseudolus, a clever slave bent
on gaining his freedom, is Ste
phen Jay Book. Book, who is a
second year grad student in di
recting, was the director of last
year's highly successful "Roar
of the Grease Paint, Smell of
the Crowd." He also was in the
recent Palo Alto Community
Theatre's production of "Enter
Laughing." In addition, Book
has had both acting and direc
torial experience on Broadway.
The leading female role, Phil
ia, is being played by Gretchen
Grant, who has also been active
in "Gaieties", and a number of
other Ram's Head productions,

including "Roar of the Grease
Paint" and "Carnival." She is a
second year MFA candidate in
acting.
Roger Kozol, who recently
starred in the SRT production of
"Andromache" is producing this
Big Game Show. Kozol, along
with Musical t Director, Robert
Hoffman are both first year grad
students, who spent their under
grad years at Harvard.
Light Comedy
"Funny Thing" is much in
keeping with the traditional Big
Game shows, in that it is a light
comic performance. According
to Director Walter, the show is
"rowdy, fast-paced, and quite
contemporary in its treatment
of sex."
Performances of "Funny
Thing" are on November 19, 20,
21, and 22 at Memorial Audito
rium, at 8:30 p.m. Tickets are
available at Tresidder Box Of
fice, Memorial Auditorium, and
will be on sale in White Plaza
next week. In addition to group
rates for groups of over 25, spe
cial discount rates are in effect
for student tickets for perform
ances on November 19 and 20.
Sex is to be the subject of the
Big Game show being presented
this year by the Mafia. Are they
featuring Dr. Kinsey? Not real
ly. Perhaps on a lighter vein is
their production of "A Funny
Thing Happened on the Way to
the Forum."
This show, unlike past Big
Game productions, is a bona
fide Broadway hit, which has
been unchanged for its produc
tion at Stanford. "Funny Thing"
will be presented on the four
nights preceding Big Game.
To Replace "Gaieties"
This season's Big Game Show
was originally scheduled to be
a Ram's Head production of
"Gaieties", but the show never
materialized.
When asked why the Mafia is
presenting this year's show, Di
rector Robert Walter stated,
"Because I believe that theatre
is a ritual which draws all ele
ments of a community together,
I was particularly distressed at
the possibility that the Big
Game show might die this
year."
In order to produce this show,
the Mafia was granted a loan
of $5000 from the ASSU treas
ury.

The Mafia is a core group of
between 30 and 40 Master of
Fine Arts Candidates in the
Speech and Drama Department.
These grad students also pro
duce the Midnight Mafia, a.week
ly presentation of short plays,
which is held in the Nitery on
Saturday evenings at 11:30.
