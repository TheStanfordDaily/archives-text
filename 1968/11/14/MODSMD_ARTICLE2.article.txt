SAN FRANCISCO--San Fran
cisco State College President
Robert Smith ordered the school
closed indefinitely after eight
demonstrators were arrested and
the police tactical squad again
came on campus to break up
student protests.
Meanwhile faculty members
met and voted to stay "in con
tinuous session," thus suspend
ing instruction, in the aftermath
of the suspension of English in
structor and Black Panther
George Murray.
Smith's statement came at a
late afternoon press conference
which followed a day of speech
es and violence.
"We will keep the campus
closed until we can open and
operate on a rational basis,"
Smith declared, after meeting
with his academic deans, the
president of the Academic Sen
ate, and other officials.
Smith also noted he had
spoken to State College Chan
cellor Glenn Dumke, but de
clined to comment on what had
been said.
The Black Student Union is in
the second week of a strike
called to enforce demands which
include reinstatement of part
time instructor George Murray,
a Black Panther, who called for
students to arm themselves on
campus.
Most of the 18,000 students,

predominantly white, had con
tinued to attend classes through
the strike.
The day's activities began
with a press conference held by
the BSU at 12:30. The speakers,
including Murray, enumerated
the demands of BSU and Third
World students have made to
the administration.
Shortly after the conference
concluded, ten members of the
San Francisco Police Tactical
Squad moved on campus. Stu
dents began shouting "Pigs off
campus." Some rocks were
thrown.
The police then moved in on
the crowd, breaking it up and
arresting several protestors.
This procedure continued for
about half an hour, with the tac
tical squad moving from group
to group, dispersing each and
making arrests.
The reason the police were
called on campus is still not
clear. Smith said the action was
taken by "one of my staff while
I was off campus"—h avi n g
lunch. "A person was injured,"
he continued, "and it was neces
sary to call it (the tactical
squad) in to protect the safety
of the individual."
Other reports do not support
this version. The injured per
son, a cameraman for KGO, was
not hurt until after the tactical
squad appeared, others report
ed.

Scuffle With Cameraman
The cameraman was sur
rounded by several students and
kicked by at least one of them
after he hit a spectator with his
camera. The spectator, a stu
dent, had refused to get out of
his line of vision.
One rumor was that the po
lice moved in after there was a
break in communications be
tween the tactical squad and a
plainclothesman, reporting via a
walkie-talkie.
Some policemen seemed to be
acting as "spotters" for the tac
tical squad, looking for leaders
of the protest and then instruct
ing the squad to move in on
them.
After the arrests, a faculty
picket line appeared, and the
students moved to the Commons
area to hold an impromptu ral
ly. They then moved to the steps
of the Administration Building,
which contains the president's
office.
350 Profs Attend Meeting
While the students harrangued
Smith from outside the build
ing, the faculty met. About 350
professors attended the meeting.
Besides voting to suspend in
struction, they considered a mo
tion asking for the resignation
of Chancellor Dumke.
A vote of this resolution will
be taken at another meeting to
day.
One professor, Jerry Wethei
mer, left the meeting to inform
the students of the decision to
close classes.
Smith then appeared and
asked the students to leave, stat
ing that he would make an an
nouncement later in the day. The
crowd, then nearly 2,000 strong,
jeered him.
The students eventually moved
back to the commons to plan the
strike for today—a move which
turned out to be unnecessary
when Smith closed the school.
Some professors will meet
their classes off campus today.
Dumke also announced he will
meet today with faculty and
staff, especially blacks and oth
er minority group members "to
define the issues and then ex
tend the issues as we can.
"It is clear," Smith added, in
explaining his decision to close
the school, "that as . . . "as a
result of the pattern of confron
tation and violence we don't be
lieve it possible to conduct a
constructive educational pro
gram."
"Bringing in the police in an
effort to keep the campus open,"
Smith noted, "has not worked
in this situation—at least not to
my satisfaction."
