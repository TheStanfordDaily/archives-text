The resolution on "Uninvited Police Intrusion" suggests that all
uninvited police officers at any lawful student assembly be asked

The accompanying resolution further suggests that a committee
be appointed to investigate those cases where police come on cam

the Food Service and residence management. It further empowers
the committee to make "specific recommendations for improved
liaison in the future."
The resolution, according to sponsor Jim Sprickard, would help
students "find out what is going on in the business office." He also
