# City Police Make On-Campus Arrests For Election Protests
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
Moving with speed and with
out warning, the Palo Alto po
lice force served warrants and
made two arrests on the Stan
ford campus yesterday in con
nection with last week's disturb
ances in Palo Alto. One of the
arrests was in the Tresidder Un
ion cafeteria.
The arrests were the first
made in memory on campus by
the Palo Alto police department
for non-traffic violations.
Charged with failure to dis
perse were Marc Sapir, a fourth
year medical student here, and
Jim Johnson, a chemical engi
neering senior. Both are mem
bers of the Students for a Demo
cratic Society. Johnson's arrest
included the additional charge
of disturbing the peace.
Both arrests were made fol
lowing a rally in the medical
center and preceded a march
from Stanford to the Palo Alto
Police Department by some 200
students later in the afternoon.
Sapir's arrest came immedi
ately after the noon meeting at
which he was present and made
a short talk. Preceding the
meeting he had said that if he
was not arrested by 4:30 he
would march to the police sta
tion and be present at the Lyt
ton Plaza rally.
The officers who arrested Sa
pir were identified as Captain
George Wathen and Sergeant
Allan Bowra.
Off To Jail
Just after discussion con
cluded, Sapir was arrested in a
courtyard of the center and
taken into custody. He was then
escorted in handcuffs through
the hospital to the other side of
the building and taken to the
North County Jail, where he was
booked.
As he was being taken from
the courtroom of the jail, Sapir

said, "It was just political—pure
and simple: they helped to prove
it was political by coming onto
the campus to arrest me."
Dean of Students Joel Smith
and Provost Richard Lyman
both indicated to The Daily their
"anger" over the arrests.
. Dean Smith said, "I am dis
tressed and angered by what
happened. The police exercised
poor judgment with unfortunate
consequences . . . both at the
University and in the Palo Alto
community."
Lyman added, "What's getting
us in trouble is that politics and
the law are getting all mixed up
together."
Associate Dean of Students
Bill Wyman agreed saying that
"the handling of the arrest in
Tresidder made more provoc
ative an already tense situation."
Tresidder Arrest
Johnson was arrested shortly
after 3 p.m. in the Tresidder Un
ion cafeteria. When arrested he
was sitting at a table with En
glish Prof. Bruce Franklin who
was arrested on a similar charge
Friday.
The arrest was made by Palo
Alto police Sergeant Poso, who
also arrested Franklin.
Poso was assisted in John
son's arrest by Stanford police
inspector Lillie, a plain clothes
investigator, according to Stan
ford Police Chief Tom Bell.
The medical center where Sa
pir was arrested is within the
city limits of Palo Alto and is
the only portion of the Stanford
campus under Palo Alto police
jurisdiction. This stems from the
earlier co-ownership of the hos
pital by Stanford and the City
of Palo Alto.
Permission Granted
Tresidder Union, however, is
located in an unincorporated
area of Santa Clara County. The
Palo Alto police obtained per

mission from the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Office to make
the arrest. Permission is re
quired under a state law passed
recently.
Previously officers outside
their normal jurisdiction could
only make arrests when accom
panied by a local police officer.
The warrant for Sapir's ar
rest was issued Friday along
with Franklin's. But no action
had been taken on Sapir until
yesterday's arrest.
Johnson was among those
present at a rally in White Plaza
last week at which Sergeant
Poso and two other officers were
present. At that time The Daily
reported that Poso questioned a
photographer concerning some
of those present. Johnson was
among those Poso was appar
ently seeking to identify.
North County
Johnson was also taken to the
North County Jail and booked.
He later posted bond for $315.
Following the arrests students
assembled at 4:30 in front of
the campus for a pre-arranged
march to the police department
to be followed by a rally in
Lytton Plaza.
A procession of some 200 stu
dents marched their way singing
and chanting to the Palo Alto
police station where they pre
sented four demands to an as
sistant police chief.
Demands included an end to
all political arrests on the Stan
ford campus, freedom for all
those arrested, the dropping of
charges against those arrested
Nov. 5, and the making avail
able, of Lytton Plaza for all pub
lic gatherings.
Present Demands
Helmeted policemen stood out
side the station standing guard
as two students, Bill Gray and
Jim Ransom were allowed inside
to present the oemands.
Policemen on a balcony atop
the building stood with movie
cameras taking pictures of the
marchers.
The marchers had disrupted
auto traffic and caused a traffic
jam along the path down Uni
versity Ave. to the police sta
tion. As they left, the marchers
were given an escort by police
who closed off a lane for the
marchers to return.
Phone Tap?
Earlier in the day Bruce
Franklin said at the afternoon
medical center gathering that
his phone had been tapped as
far back as 1965.
Wednesday morning Hydie said
in a phone interview with The
Daily that "I have no knowledge

of this whatsoever. I believe
this is a fiction of someone's
imagination."
Franklin went on to say that
after he was arrested last Fri
day, he was subjected to "red
baiting" by the arresting officer
and was treated as if he was a
wild desperado trying to flee.
He also claimed that while be
ing taken to the police station
he was shown a section of the
California Veterans Code which
allegedly makes it a felony to
display a red flag in public.
"They told me if I was to dis
play a red flag they would bust
me on the spot," Franklin said.
Flags
He then called for marchers
to carry flags later in the after
noon and offered to carry one
himself. The result was that the
march featured a plethora of red
flags intermixed with black
flags. But no arrests were made
for the alleged violation.
According to Hydie yester
day's campus arrests were not
specifically authorized by him.
He stated they were made by
the investigations division.
Stanford Police Chief Tom
Bell said he didn't think such
arrests by the Palo Alto police
force on the Stanford campus,
other than traffic violations, had
ever taken place before.
Reaction to the arrests, among
those questioned was generally
astonishment.
Acting President Robert
Glaser said that he was dis
turbed by the arrests and upset
at the chain of events. He was
particularly concerned about the
"time lag" and the arrests "done
where it was done."
Irritated
ASSU President Denis Hayes
issuing a late statement said
that 'Those profoundly stupid
arrests by the Palo Alto cops
will probably unite this campus
as nothing else could. I have met
nothing but outraged students,
outraged faculty, and outraged
administrators. Even the trustee
I called was irritated."
"I hope this whole matter of
police action on campus will be
taken up by the faculty Senate
tomorrow afternoon; I certainly
intend to raise the issue in the
student legislature tomorrow
night."
Yale Braunstein, speaker of
LASSU said that a bill will be
introduced this evening at the
biweekly meeting to recreate
the Stanford student police force
and empower them to remove
any unauthorized policemen on
campus.


NOON RALLY —Marc Sapir (above, speaking) addressed a noon
time rally at (ho medical school yesterday. Shortly after the rally
finished Sapir was arrested by Paio Alto police on a charge of "fail
ure to disperse." The charge stems from last week's Lytton Plaza
demonstration. Seen in the background, among others, is English
Prof. Bruce Franklin who was arrested on a similar charge last
Friday. Jim Johnson, a Stanford student, was arrested on the same
charge yesterday afternoon in the Tresidder cafeteria.
