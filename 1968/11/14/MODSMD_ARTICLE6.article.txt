• HowToPayTA's?
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the November 12 issue of
the Daily, I am represented as
saying that "only six of 14 quar
ters of TA work in (my) depart
ment were paid, with the rest
handled without compensation
by those of fellowships." This
statement, which was of course
not a direct quote, misrepresents
the actual problem which I was
trying to explain to the univer
sity administration. The way
payment of TA's is handled

within the department has va
ried over the past few years.
A continuing problem, how
ever, has been that the admin
istration has provided the de
partment with two paid teach
ing assistantships ($4600), or six
paid quarters, while the depart
ment provides the university
with 12-14 quarters of TA ser
vice. Our complaint, then, was
that the university should pay
for services it receives, and not
put our department in the im
possible position of trying to
give quality undergraduate
courses and pay graduate stu

dents for services, with insuffi
cient resources. For example, we
surely are not expected to han
dle Anthropology I, with an en
rollment of 400 people, with only
two TA's.

• War Courses
Editor, THE DAILY:
The recent concern of Stan
ford University students for gov
ernment funded programs of re
search directed at germ war
fare, nerve gas, and so on, is in
deed praiseworthy. It is certain
ly poor philosophy to spend
much time and effort on the de
struction of man.
However, perhaps the students
would do as well to look at the
Stanford University Bulletin un
der "Naval Science," where the
following courses are offered,
among others:
"Naval Weapons I," "Naval
Weapons II," "Evolution of the
Art of War I and II," "Amphibi
ous Warfare I and II."

• Turns In Draft Card
Editor, THE DAILY:
At noon today in White Plaza
I will return my draft card. My
reasons include:
1. The Selective Service vio
lates my constitutional rights
guaranteeing my freedom from
"involuntary servitude" (13th
amendment).
2. I cannot cooperate with any
group or person contributing to
war or genocide and the associ
ated dehumanization of all those
involved.
3. The United States domestic
and foreign policies too often re
sult in tragedy. I cannot tolerate
the spending of thousands of
human lives and vast resources
to maintain the power of those
few men entrusted with govern
ing.
4. I owe my service to all hu
man beings, not just those of
this country. I will not serve any
government where it fails to act
in the best interest of humanity.
