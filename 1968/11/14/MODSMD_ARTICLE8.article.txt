The arrest of a student in Tresidder Union
yesterday afternoon by Palo Alto police spills
open a Pandoras box of legal and political
problems for Stanford centering on the extent
of University responsibility for student conduct
off campus. The problems demand both im
mediate and long range examination and solu
tion.
In the immediate sphere, yesterday's events
exemplify a sorrowful lack of contact between
Stanford and the Palo Alto police. The Uni
versity has developed a cooperative and mu
tually beneficial relationship with the Santa
Clara sheriffs office, providing the sheriff with
a clear understanding of campus atmosphere,
particularly student and faculty attitudes about
police. This force thus operates with extreme
care in campus operations.
The Palo Alto force operates without the
slightest knowledge of University atmosphere.
Arresting a student in the Union is a provoca
tive and, as one administrator said, "dumb-ass
move." There's little reason the administration
cannot open communication with the Palo Alto
police. There is no need to communicate on
drunk driving violations, but some busy work
should be endured to avoid further mistakes of
yesterday's magnitude.
Beyond the immediate, events of the past
week and yesterday leave the University floun
dering in a morass of ambiguity and confusion
about the breadth of its responsibility for stu
dent actions off campus.
In the early 1950's universities officially and
publicly came to the defense of faculty mem
bers being attacked by McCarthy. In 1968
Stanford University appears unwilling to de
fend students under attack by the Palo Alto
establishment. There is obviously divergent

opinion about the legality or illegality of stu
dent actions in Lytton Plaza last Tuesday;
there are equally differing views about the
political or nonpolitical motivation of police
actions. Unquestionably, however, the arrests
are surrounded by some doubt. A neutral stance
by the University is a stance supporting the
police, and that is unacceptable. There is no
necessity for the University actively to defend
students, but it should establish structures to
insure they receive fair hearing with capable
lawyers. The University should face the simple
fact that students will increasingly be active in
off-campus concerns, sometimes ending in jail.
It is time a review board be established to offer
legal defense and financial support to students
involved in cases of doubt. If someone is ar
rested for drunk driving, c'est la vie. But if
someone is arrested on charges with possible
political, social, or moral overtones, it's in
cumbent on Stanford to insure "the possible"
is fully explored.
This week there is no such board so it is
more than necessary for administrators and fac
ulty members to be present at Lytton Plaza
on Friday night personally to observe the activ
ity and view first hand the intensity of student
and police action. We hope neutrality this week
is simply based on ignorance.
To students, we recommend a massive turn
out of support at the Lytton Plaza demonstra
tion Friday to show the police and their allies
that questionable arrests will not be meekly
accepted. The demonstration should be orderly
or the cycle of arrests and demonstrations will
continue indefinitely. The police, in turn, should
use their minds rather than their clubs and
handcuffs by closing off part of University Ave.

yesterday afternoon by Palo Alto police spills
open a Pandoras box of legal and political
problems for Stanford centering on the extent
of University responsibility for student conduct
off campus. The problems demand both im
mediate and long range examination and solu
tion.
In the immediate sphere, yesterday's events
exemplify a sorrowful lack of contact between
Stanford and the Palo Alto police. The Uni
versity has developed a cooperative and mu
tually beneficial relationship with the Santa
Clara sheriffs office, providing the sheriff with
a clear understanding of campus atmosphere,
particularly student and faculty attitudes about
police. This force thus operates with extreme
care in campus operations.
The Palo Alto force operates without the
slightest knowledge of University atmosphere.
Arresting a student in the Union is a provoca
tive and, as one administrator said, "dumb-ass
move." There's little reason the administration
cannot open communication with the Palo Alto
police. There is no need to communicate on
drunk driving violations, but some busy work
should be endured to avoid further mistakes of
yesterday's magnitude.
Beyond the immediate, events of the past
week and yesterday leave the University floun
dering in a morass of ambiguity and confusion
about the breadth of its responsibility for stu
dent actions off campus.
In the early 1950's universities officially and
publicly came to the defense of faculty mem
bers being attacked by McCarthy. In 1968
Stanford University appears unwilling to de
fend students under attack by the Palo Alto
establishment. There is obviously divergent

opinion about the legality or illegality of stu
dent actions in Lytton Plaza last Tuesday;
there are equally differing views about the
political or nonpolitical motivation of police
actions. Unquestionably, however, the arrests
are surrounded by some doubt. A neutral stance
by the University is a stance supporting the
police, and that is unacceptable. There is no
necessity for the University actively to defend
students, but it should establish structures to
insure they receive fair hearing with capable
lawyers. The University should face the simple
fact that students will increasingly be active in
off-campus concerns, sometimes ending in jail.
It is time a review board be established to offer
legal defense and financial support to students
involved in cases of doubt. If someone is ar
rested for drunk driving, c'est la vie. But if
someone is arrested on charges with possible
political, social, or moral overtones, it's in
cumbent on Stanford to insure "the possible"
is fully explored.
This week there is no such board so it is
more than necessary for administrators and fac
ulty members to be present at Lytton Plaza
on Friday night personally to observe the activ
ity and view first hand the intensity of student
and police action. We hope neutrality this week
is simply based on ignorance.
To students, we recommend a massive turn
out of support at the Lytton Plaza demonstra
tion Friday to show the police and their allies
that questionable arrests will not be meekly
accepted. The demonstration should be orderly
or the cycle of arrests and demonstrations will
continue indefinitely. The police, in turn, should
use their minds rather than their clubs and
handcuffs by closing off part of University Ave.
if necessary to avoid confrontations. Patience
and cleverness have been sorely lacking recent
