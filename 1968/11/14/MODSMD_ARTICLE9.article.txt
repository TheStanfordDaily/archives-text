The Non-Cooperator
Men become non-cooperators
with Selective Service in various
ways and for a variety of reas
ons. It is not our purpose in this
column to judge the position of
non-cooperators or to assess
how appropriate it is for a spe
cific individual. Each person's
situation presents unique prob
lems and consequences, but
there are several somewhat
typical kinds of non-cooperators,
among them the following.
First of all, there is the con
scientious objector who has ex
hausted all appeals and admin
istrative remedies within Selec
tive Service without being rec
ognized as a CO, and who first
become a non-cooperator by re
fusing induction. Although it
may have been his original in
tent to act legally within the
framework of the law, refusing
induction may become the only
way he can continue to act con
sistent with his belief.
It is also generally the only
way he can obtain even a limited
judicial review of the actions
which have been taken by Selec
tive Service in considering his
claim as a conscientious objec
tor. This may change in the fu
ture, however, since a case now
before the Supreme Court (Ga
briel v. Clark) may establish in
certain cases the right to such

a judicial review before a man
is forced to commit the federal
felony of refusing induction.
When such a man is brought
to trial, the court will generally
find him guilty of refusing a
valid induction order and pass
sentence, unless the man has
been able to establish in court
any of the following points: 1)
There was no basis in fact for
the local board's refusal to class
ify him as a CO, 2) There were
procedural errors made by Se
lective Service which violate its
own regulations, 3) There was
some violation of the regis
trant's constitutional rights.
A second kind of non-cooper
ator is the man who has regis
tred and cooperated for some
time with the draft, but then
decides he can no longer be part
of the Selective Service System.
He may express his non-cooper
ation in such ways as returning
or destroying his draft card or
returning unopened all Selective
Service correspondence.
Such a non-cooperator may be
prosecuted directly for destroy
ing or refusing to carry his
draft card, or he may be re
classified I-A delinquent and or
dered for priority induction. If
he is ordered for induction and
reports and refuses, he will be
treated in some federal courts
much like the man who has
tried unsuccessfully to be recog
nized as a CO. If he does not
report for induction, there will
ordinarily be no consideration
by the court of anything except
to the extent of formally refus
ing induction, he may face pros
ecution and conviction with little
opportunity to establish in court
what he is doing and why. How
ever, many federal judges make
whether he willfully failed to
report for induction.
A third kind of non-cooperator
is the man who opposes the
draft itself and refuses from the
beginning to register or to co-

operate in any way. Such a man
may be involuntarily registered
and ordered to report lor induc
tion. If he refuses to cooperate
an effort to find this out from
the 18-year old non-registrant.
While there is usually no ques
tion that such a person will be
found guilty as charged, the
court may be influenced in sen
tencing by what it perceives to
be the motives of the individual
concerned.
The non-cooperator should, of
course, be clear about what he
is doing, why he is doing it, and
what the consequences are
likely to be. Otherwise, his ac
tion may not express this real
intent and he may be unpre
pared for what follows. He
should know that practices vary
widely in different federal court
districtsâ€”from courts which
hand down five year sentences
almost automatically to courts
which often give probationary
sentences without imprisonment
if convinced that the non-coop
eration is a matter of consci
ence. And he should know what
to do to come to trial in a par
ticular federal district if he so
desires. In short, he needs to
confer with a counselor or law
yer in order to be as fully aware
as possible of the consequences
and implications of whatever
course of action he is consider
ing.
