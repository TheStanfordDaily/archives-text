# Black Panel Calls Athlete A 'Tom'
## 
### KIM THORBURN JACK KAPLAN 
Yesterday afternoon's com
paratively mild panel discussion
on the role of the black athlete
turned into a heated argument
among blacks about whether
star Stanford flanker Gene
Washington is being an Uncle
Tom or is expressing his black
ness through his feats on the
football field.
Gold medalist sprinter Tom
mie Smith, Stanford ex-football
star Nate Kirtman and ex-Stan
ford and Berkeley football play
er Dale Rubin agreed that a
black athlete who doesn't use
his talent to help other blacks
is betraying his people. He is a
"Tom", in Rubin's words; a col
ored man rather than a black
man, according to Smith.
"Black athletes are seen only
in their athletic role, not as
men," according to Rubin. "And
they haven't acted as men."
Smith, Kirtman, Rubin, and
assistant football coach Bill Mul
trie comprised the panel, which
was moderated by Sam Skinner
of KGO. The program, which
will be broadcast November 30,
took place at Dinkelspiel Audi
torium in front of about 200 peo
ple.
'Conservative' Athlete
During the panel discussion,
Skinner called an unnamed
Stanford football player a "con
servative." Smith had earlier de
fined a black conservative as a
Tom. Skinner equated conserva
tism to such people as Barry
Goldwater, Max Rafferty, and
Judas. Members of the audience
tried to enter the discussion at
this point, but Skinner said
questions would be entertained
later.
As soon as Skinner opened the
floor to questions, a black, who
identified himself as Fuller,
asked Skinner under what au
thority he charged the still un
named football player with being
a Tom. "You're just a fat black
man who's let your ego get
away," he told the overweight
Skinner.
Fuller then went on to iden

tify the football player as Gene
Washington, and to attack Skin
ner not only for what he said at
Dinkelspiel, but for other criti
cisms of Washington that he
spoke on his radio program the
previous night. That program
apparently revolved around
ouotes from Washington which
appeared in an article in Wed
nesday's Chronicle.
Militancy Easy
That article, written bv Art
Rosenbaum. ouoted Washington
as savinrr, "Rieht now it would
he easv to follow the Groove of
militancy, but I sc l it onlv as
a temporary flare. After the ini
tial outburst, a more positive
kind of cooperative activism
will emerge. Most black persons
arc in favor of a sound struc
ture, not a burning one."
In an interview last nir r ht with
The Duilv, Washington said that
th° article was ba c ed on state
ments rrmdo last Marrh, but that
th«v reflect his present beliefs.
"The label 'conservative' was the
columnists's interpretation, not
my own." he a^d^d.
"I think all Negroes are mili
tant. Militancy to a black is dif
ferent than militancy to a
white."
No Animosity
"I feel no animosity to those
who called me a Tom. I think
they're being narrow-minded.
Thev think their bag is the only
way."
John Parish, brother of Stan
ford defensive linebacker Don
Parish, then entered the debate.
"The conservative black," he
shouted, "knows how to express
his blaekness,"
Rubin called Parish's position
"immediately .suspect" because
it received applause from some
white members of the audience.
At one point Smith asked that
whites who applauded Parish ex
plain why they clapped. A white
student then began explaining
his views, but Smith interrupted
him. Pounding on the table, he
exclaimed, "That's the trouble
with the black man today.
Whites have been giving him ad
vice for too damn long."
