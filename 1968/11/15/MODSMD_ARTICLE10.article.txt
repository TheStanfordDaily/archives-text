## The 						Democrats In Opposition 
### SKIP HARRIS 
The predominant theme of
this election, be it either "things
are messed up," "Things could
be better," or "If necessary we
gonna crack some heads" was a
repudiation of the Johnson ad
ministration and the events sur
rounding it. People were at least
aware of the problems even if
they weren't really sensitive to
them.
To unify the country Nixon
has expressed an interest in a
coa'ition government. He means
to bring Democrats into his ad
ministration. There has even
been some speculation that Vice
President Humphrey might get
a cabinet post.
To some this shows a genuine
attempt to heal the rifts in

America by cooperating with
and utilizing the talents of the
opposition party. To others this
plainly demonstrates that there
is no real difference between the
Democrats and the GOP.
It remains to be seen whom
Mr. Nixon will choose as his ad
visors. It remains to be seen if
he is sensitive to those needs.
Will he call on the Lindsays and
thte John Gardners or will he
choose the Spiro Agnews and
the Strom Thurmonds? By ex
pressing a desire to work with
Mr. Humphrey he seems to lean
to the former. But can he divorce
himself from the latter?
It seems very doubtful that he
will be able to do. He will have
to endorse both Reagan and
Lindsay. By trying to please ev
eryone, Mr. Nixon and Mr. Hum

phrey are going to find them
selves in the Eisenhower middle
of-the-road.
There arc some areas in our
country, especially the Urban
Problems, that have to be faced
very soon. They need unhamp
ered attention, not with an eye
to the symptoms but the disease.
And contrary to what a large
comfortable portion of this coun
try believes, the situation is get
ting worse not better.
Here is where the Democratic
Party should step in. As the
"Loyal Opposition" and the ma
jority in Congress it should force
the administration to act on un
comfortable issues. It should not
be a part of the administration
because that subjects it to the
same ties that are on Mr. Nix
on.

The Democrats, long a coali
tion of minorities, should re
examine what the disenchanted
•» minorities are in this country
and work to their benefit .In Chi
cago it seemed that the Coalition
had fallen apart. They were
fighting the minorities instead
of drawing on them for support.
Now, however, it is obvious
that a painful self-evaluation in
the Party is past due. Even Da
ley's machine could not carry
Illinois. The old guard can't do
ft any longer.
To chant?" things on n must
have a position of power.
With Mr. Humphrey's defeat
and probable abdication as the
leader of the opposition there is
a power vacuum in the Demo
cratic Party. If the old guard

can't do it a now one will have
to bo found.
Hero is whore the young can
make their presence felt. As Nix
on did in 1964, they can begin to
work for the next election. The
Democrats need the young peo
ple's drive and commitment.
They need their sensitivity and
new perspective.
The obvious goal is 1970 in
California. .Ronald Reagan can
not be tolerated for another four
years and it is the Democratic
Party that is going to have to
oust him. The Democratic Party
does not deserve our support
but in many cases it needs to
survive. In turn the Party can
offer a power base for those who
stand opposed to unresponsive
government.

work for the next election. The
Democrats need the young peo

They need their sensitivity and

The obvious goal is 1970 in
California. .Ronald Reagan can
not be tolerated for another four
years and it is the Democratic
Party that is going to have to
oust him. The Democratic Party
does not deserve our support

offer a power base for those who
stand opposed to unresponsive
government.
The predominant theme of
this election, be it either "things
are messed up," "Things could
be better," or "If necessary we
gonna crack some heads" was a
repudiation of the Johnson ad
ministration and the events sur
rounding it. People were at least
aware of the problems even if
they weren't really sensitive to
them.
To unify the country Nixon
has expressed an interest in a
coa'ition government. He means
to bring Democrats into his ad
ministration. There has even
been some speculation that Vice
President Humphrey might get
a cabinet post.
To some this shows a genuine
attempt to heal the rifts in

America by cooperating with
and utilizing the talents of the
opposition party. To others this
plainly demonstrates that there
is no real difference between the
Democrats and the GOP.
It remains to be seen whom
Mr. Nixon will choose as his ad
visors. It remains to be seen if
he is sensitive to those needs.
Will he call on the Lindsays and
thte John Gardners or will he
choose the Spiro Agnews and
the Strom Thurmonds? By ex
pressing a desire to work with
Mr. Humphrey he seems to lean
to the former. But can he divorce
himself from the latter?
It seems very doubtful that he
will be able to do. He will have
to endorse both Reagan and
Lindsay. By trying to please ev
eryone, Mr. Nixon and Mr. Hum

phrey are going to find them
selves in the Eisenhower middle
of-the-road.
There arc some areas in our
country, especially the Urban
Problems, that have to be faced

Here is where the Democratic
Party should step in. As the
"Loyal Opposition" and the ma
jority in Congress it should force
the administration to act on un

be a part of the administration
because that subjects it to the

on.

The Democrats, long a coali

of drawing on them for support.
Now, however, it is obvious
that a painful self-evaluation in
