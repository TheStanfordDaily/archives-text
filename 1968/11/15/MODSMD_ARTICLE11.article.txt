ASSU PRESIDENT DENIS
HAYES recently redecorated his
offices in the Student Union.
Sources close to the president re
port that the positioning of his
desk is of special interest. He is
now up against the wall. Shades
of Peter Lyman?

NATIONAL MAGAZINES have
begun speculating about Vice
Presidential loser Sen. Edmund
Muskie's Presidential chances
the next time around. And ac
cording to one of the newsmen
who covered Muskie, the Maine
senator has inspired "ten to
twelve" of his press corps to say
"they would give up a year of
their lives" to make his Presi
dent.
During this past election the
press corps has br>en rather con
sistently disgusted with the can
didates. The only candidate be
sides Muskie who's managed to
charm the press: Sen. Eugene
McCarthy.

OPPONENTS OF THOSE NON
UNION California table grapes:
where have you been?
Those round, juicy items
(grapes) are gone from Tresid
der Union and most student cam
pus residences, but live on at
the Faculty Club.
Faculty C'ub Manager Forrest
Tregea verified that grapes still
appear occasionally on the din
ing room's buffet table.
"If they are in season, and if
they are of good quality, then
we put them on the table along
with other fruits. Those who
don't want them can leave
them," Tregea said.
Purchases have been low re
cently, with only 20 or 30 pounds
the normal for a month, Tregea
commented. But in TYesidder
Union, which Tregea also man
ages, grape purchases have
ceased completely, due to "stu
dent wishes" manifest by a re
cent student referendum asking
that grapes not be served, he
added.
The decision to continue put
ting the controversial fruit on
Faculty Club Tables came from
the club's board of directors, who
decided that the matter should
be one of "personal choice."
Although the decision was
"not really satisfactory to any
one," the 10-member board left

the question of eating the item
"up to individual members," ac
cording to Engineering Prof. Hu
bert HelTner, president of the
club board of directors.
HefTner explained that he had
received "no complaints from
faculty members, but would
"reopen the matter if members
bring the question to my atten
tion."
A Faculty Club student hasher
told The Daily that "many fac
ulty people were upset" when
grapes appeared on the lunch
bufTet table recently after a 10-
day absence. "About 50 per cent
of the people there expressed
concerned," he said, by making
comments or writing notes on
their bills. 4*

TWICE IN THE PAST WEEK
letter-to-the-editor writers have
called The Daily and withdrawn
their contributions just before
press time. Both letters were cri
tical of the ASSU's grossly mis
managed elections. In both cases
the individuals had proven the
irresponsibility of polling place
monitors. One student, during
the first (aborted) election,
walked off with a fistfull of bal
lots. The other voted twice in
the second go-round.
We will not print letters
against the wishes of their au
thors. But who is covering up
for whom?

ASSU PRESIDENT DENIS
HAYES recently redecorated his
offices in the Student Union.
Sources close to the president re
port that the positioning of his
desk is of special interest. He is
now up against the wall. Shades
of Peter Lyman?

NATIONAL MAGAZINES have
begun speculating about Vice
Presidential loser Sen. Edmund
Muskie's Presidential chances
the next time around. And ac
cording to one of the newsmen
who covered Muskie, the Maine
senator has inspired "ten to
twelve" of his press corps to say
"they would give up a year of
their lives" to make his Presi
dent.
During this past election the
press corps has br>en rather con
sistently disgusted with the can
didates. The only candidate be
sides Muskie who's managed to
charm the press: Sen. Eugene
McCarthy.

OPPONENTS OF THOSE NON
UNION California table grapes:
where have you been?
Those round, juicy items
(grapes) are gone from Tresid
der Union and most student cam
pus residences, but live on at
the Faculty Club.
Faculty C'ub Manager Forrest
Tregea verified that grapes still
appear occasionally on the din
ing room's buffet table.
"If they are in season, and if
they are of good quality, then
we put them on the table along
with other fruits. Those who
don't want them can leave
them," Tregea said.
Purchases have been low re
cently, with only 20 or 30 pounds
the normal for a month, Tregea
commented. But in TYesidder
Union, which Tregea also man
ages, grape purchases have
ceased completely, due to "stu
dent wishes" manifest by a re
cent student referendum asking
that grapes not be served, he
added.
The decision to continue put
ting the controversial fruit on
Faculty Club Tables came from
the club's board of directors, who
decided that the matter should
be one of "personal choice."
Although the decision was
"not really satisfactory to any
one," the 10-member board left

the question of eating the item
"up to individual members," ac
cording to Engineering Prof. Hu
bert HelTner, president of the
club board of directors.
HefTner explained that he had
received "no complaints from
faculty members, but would
"reopen the matter if members
bring the question to my atten
tion."
A Faculty Club student hasher
told The Daily that "many fac
ulty people were upset" when
grapes appeared on the lunch
bufTet table recently after a 10-
day absence. "About 50 per cent
of the people there expressed
concerned," he said, by making
comments or writing notes on
their bills. 4*

TWICE IN THE PAST WEEK
letter-to-the-editor writers have
called The Daily and withdrawn
their contributions just before
press time. Both letters were cri
tical of the ASSU's grossly mis
managed elections. In both cases
the individuals had proven the
irresponsibility of polling place
monitors. One student, during
the first (aborted) election,
walked off with a fistfull of bal
lots. The other voted twice in
the second go-round.
We will not print letters
against the wishes of their au
thors. But who is covering up
for whom?
