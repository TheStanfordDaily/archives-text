### JOHNIE SCOTT 
Franz Kafka once wrote a very entertaining short
story entitled "The Metamorphosis." It was so enter
taining, in fact, that it survived Kafka's lifetime, sur
vived that history, in fact, survived through Time just
long enough to guarantee itself continued life —for
many colleges, indeed, for many high schools, it is now
basic reading for English.
The plot was short and sweet. A man "woke up" one
morning to find himself no longer a "man," but a
roach. His family's reactions were interesting. His fa
ther turned away from him. His mother sympathized
with him, and then, as his "case" continued to linger,
grew ashamed of him. She hid his "plight" from the
world.
His sister, although highly sympathetic and thoroug
ly imbued with the loyalty one would expect within
families, was finally moved to see her "brother" for
what he was, in fact—something alien, something not
quite human, something outcast. More important,
something that in its difference was making herself
"different."
She smiled a sigh of relief onee her brother's re
mains, that is, once the remains of the roach, were dis
posed of. Color, or what had been the lack of it, flooded
into her face. And there, the story ended.
Note a "cockroach" is a straight-winged insect with
a flat, yellowish-brown or black body, slender legs and
long feelers; it is a common kitchen pest, especially in
warm, damp places. (Webster's New World Diction
ary ).
Note—a "cockroach" is a name generally applied to
the quiet and retiring among us, we, who are content
to merely let events take their course; we, who are
content to merely leech off the breadcrumbs thrown
out by the System; we, who are vermin even unto our
selves. (Scott's "New World" Dictionary).
November 14, 19G8. 3:30 p.m.: a "cockroach" was
discovered in the cafeteria. It had been sitting quietly
with another cockroach when two Exterminators ap
proached to remove it. Said this cockroach to the other,
"Looks like your friends are back to get you this time."
At which said time, the cockroach was promptly
smashed with a copy of the San Francisco Chronicle
Said that issue of the Chronicle, the cockroach's
blood smeared across the headlines "SF STATE OR
DERED SHUT DOWN!" Cockroaches were on the
march everywhere, invading cafeterias and bookstores

in places as faraway as Santa Cruz, Mexico City. It'was
strange that they seemed to be focusing on the schools,
especially the universities. These had appeared to be
such clean places, with irrtmaculate housekeeping.
The students at these schools were clean, well
groomed, and came from decent, self-respecting homes
not at all similar to those in the gutty sections of the
city. The kids, in the words of many a college and
university president, "sincerely wanted to be allowed
to study."
I agreed, reading these headlines, quips and quotes.
What business had students engaged in study to have
their classroom doors broken open so that a horde of
cockroaches could swarm in?
What business had these cockroaches confronting
actual human beings, decent people who possessed the
power to destroy these rude insects but who, in their
magnamity, tolerated the creatures so long as they
maintained the agreements in the compromise?—that
they, the cockroaches, remain in the dark, damp places!
I shuddered when hearing of this, but took comfort
in the fact that my strength and refuge was my school,
my knowledge that my own position as one of "the
chosen few" afforded me security not available through
life insurance policies, realty holdings, or stocks and
bonds.
It was so easy to forget and concentrate on the more
relevant, for me. Get my life-plan together, so that
those with whom I mingle and consort might remem
ber me in their older, and probably (no maybe's in
volved ) philanthropic years as an aspiring young artist.
After all, a war between cockroaches and humans.
Impossible to conceive! A madman's dream, bound to
make good science fiction reading one day!
Until a short, stubby, black cockroach was discovered
and routed out of the cafeteria Wednesday, I was able
to obfuscate these thoughts. But now, well, I have to
remember.
There are and will be among you those who wonder
why I wotild come out with this, but I have to take
the line and tell the truth, as I see it.
I am no racist. I am no callous body from the pit of
Hell. I am no screamer. But I will stand up for myself
and it is interesting to see that the police forces have
finally told the Stanford Administration, in effect, to go
"fuck themselves and in loco parentis, too," while no
body knows what is going on.
Eldridge Cleaver has already told you what is hap

pening, in SOI L ON ICE, in his speeches, in what
happened to Huey Newton, in what happened to Mal
com X, in what happened to King, in what happened
to so many, Schwerner and Goodman and Chaney and
Co:
"There is in America today u generation of white
youth that is truly worthy of a black man's respect,
and this is a rare event in the foul annals of American
history. From the beginning of the contact l>etween
blacks and whites, there has been very little reason
for a black man to respect a white, with such excep
tions us John Brown and others lesser known. But re
spect commands itself and it can neither be given nor
withheld when it is due.
If a man like Malcolm X could change and repudiate
racism, if I myself and other former Muslims can
change, if young whites can change, then there is hope
for America. It was certainly strange to find myself,
while steeped in the doctrine that all whites were
devils by nature, commanded by the heart to applaud
and acknowledge respect for these young whites —de-
spite the fact that they are descendants of the masters
and I the descendant of slaves.
The sins of the father are visited upon the heads of
the children —but only if the children continue in the
evil deeds of the fathers."
Change is coming to this country, profound change
arising out of the most basic problem of schizophrenic
America that of its innate "manifest destiny" com
plex that would have this country forever the world
power, forever the world bully, forever able to invade
and take over whenever and wherever they will.
You kids better realize that like the Bob Dyland song
says,"It ain't too much that's really scared." Jim
Johnson, who was wasted in Tresidder Wednesday,
could have been anyone of you people. I know him to
be one of the quitest blacks on the campus, but at the
same time a person who really cares and believes in
the humanity of all.
Know what he was doing in Lytton Plaza (cause for
his being busted*? After the "Peace Vigil" had con
cluded, Jim approached the Palo Alto police after they
had collared his white roommate and said, "Don't hurt
him, leave him alone." And did this quietly, aside from
the rock-throwing melee going on all around.
Johnson, whether he likes it or not, made himself a
martyr for the White Man and now, out there alone,
has to learn to deal with it that way.
