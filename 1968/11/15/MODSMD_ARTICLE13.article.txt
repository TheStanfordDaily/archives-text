# Radical Critique
## On Righteous Politics 
### JOHN SHIPPEE 
The main problem for present
day political action, whether
conducted in Chicago, along the
Pedernales, in Moscow, or on
University Avenue is Ihe cul
tural myth that effective ac
tion is indissolubly bound up
with knowledge of the"truth".
We also accept the corollary
myth thai (his knowledge is
somehow possible to attain.
Erudite texts on existential
thinking and the sociology of
knowledge have done little to
shake these beliefs.
This is only natural. Early in
life someone told each one of
us that in order to make it, he
had to have all the right an
swers. He was a liar.
The lie, however, is a plaus
ible one. Ever since Socrates,
Western Civilization has en
gaged, off and on, in what has
been termed (rather grotesque
ly, considering the results) "the
search for truth." In itself, this
isn't so bad; the process is con
ducive to finding out how little
it is possible to actually know.
The latter discovery can bring
about an enlightened humility
which in itself is a useful start
ing point.
The danger comes in the con
comitant supposition that truth

itself is discoverable and that
having found it, we can proceed
to build Utopia.
The twelve year indoctrination
process which this society en
forces on its members is a min
aturization and further bastardi
zation of the above. Those who
rio best at it win the prize: four
to ten years of further indoctrin
ation at places like Stanford.
In the process, the intellectual
presupposition that truth is to
be found in the pot at the end
of this particular rainbow usu
ally is transformed into a moral
imperative. If we don't know it
by now we cerlainly should. If
we should make the awful dis
covery that we do not—BANG!
twenty years of carefully con
structed self-image shot straight
to hell.
For political action, radical
and otherwise, the resulting
compulsive self righteousness
can easily lead to disaster.
Its absurdity is mirrored in
conventional political behavior.
The day before the election can
didate Tweedle-A states that the
election of candidate Tweedle-B
would be a national catastrophe
of such magnitude that even
those who are fed up with
tweedle-politics must vote for
Tweedle-A. The day after
Tweedle-B wins. Tweedle-A is
helping unify the nation behind
his administration.
The tragedy is in the mani
festation of political self-right
eousness in those who are at
tempting to make radical
changes in a society in which
political tweedle-ness is itself
a major cause of catastrophe.
Radical change, in order to ful
fill itself ought not to be based
on the same premises as the
system which it is trying to re
make. Insofar as it is, the an
ticipated change can never take
place. The left will find itself
in precisely this dilemma as

long as it chooses to worship the
illusion of its own perfection.
A closely related symptom of
political self-righteousness is the
tendency to conclude that
"everybody who does not go
down the line with me is against
me." This, of course, has been
an underlying tenet of U.S. and
Soviet foreign policy for many
years. It also increasingly char
acterizes the left-wing world
view particularly as it relates to
the questions of violence and
confrontation.
Self-righteousness cripples the
potential for effecting change in
several ways. Differences of
view within an organization can
tear it apart.
For example: "Everyone here
is a (commie, revisionist, nark,
secret liberal, etc.) except me
and thee, and I'm checking your
dossier again in the morning."
It also leads to increasing reli
ance on catch-words and slogans
("political arrests", "soft on
'•communism," "dirty hippies,"
"American imperialism," etc.)
which are meaningful to the
convinced inner circle but are
empty banalities to many poten
tial sympathizers and recruits.
Perhaps most importantly it
dehumanizes relationships with
in the group and with the indi
viduals who comprise the insti
tutions one is presumably try
ing to restructure.
Change is necessary if we are
to build a viable, or even (fool
ish dream) just society and
avoid sucking the rest of the
world dry at the same time. In
order to do it many of us are
making and will in the future
have to make personal sacrifices.
It is important that they be
made for something that trans
cends the self-confirming un
reality, inflexibility, and par
anoia which have the potential
to destroy our ability to act
meaningfully.

can easily lead to disaster.
Its absurdity is mirrored in
conventional political behavior.
The day before the election can
didate Tweedle-A states that the
election of candidate Tweedle-B
would be a national catastrophe
of such magnitude that even
those who are fed up with
tweedle-politics must vote for
Tweedle-A. The day after
Tweedle-B wins. Tweedle-A is
helping unify the nation behind
his administration.
The tragedy is in the mani
festation of political self-right
eousness in those who are at
tempting to make radical
changes in a society in which
political tweedle-ness is itself
a major cause of catastrophe.
Radical change, in order to ful
fill itself ought not to be based
on the same premises as the
system which it is trying to re
make. Insofar as it is, the an
ticipated change can never take
place. The left will find itself
in precisely this dilemma as

long as it chooses to worship the
illusion of its own perfection.
A closely related symptom of
political self-righteousness is the
tendency to conclude that
"everybody who does not go
down the line with me is against
me." This, of course, has been
an underlying tenet of U.S. and
Soviet foreign policy for many
years. It also increasingly char
acterizes the left-wing world
view particularly as it relates to
the questions of violence and
confrontation.
Self-righteousness cripples the
potential for effecting change in
several ways. Differences of
view within an organization can
tear it apart.
For example: "Everyone here
is a (commie, revisionist, nark,
secret liberal, etc.) except me
and thee, and I'm checking your
dossier again in the morning."
It also leads to increasing reli
ance on catch-words and slogans
("political arrests", "soft on
'•communism," "dirty hippies,"
"American imperialism," etc.)
which are meaningful to the
convinced inner circle but are
empty banalities to many poten
tial sympathizers and recruits.
Perhaps most importantly it
dehumanizes relationships with
in the group and with the indi
viduals who comprise the insti
tutions one is presumably try
ing to restructure.
Change is necessary if we are
to build a viable, or even (fool
ish dream) just society and
avoid sucking the rest of the
world dry at the same time. In
order to do it many of us are
making and will in the future
have to make personal sacrifices.
It is important that they be
made for something that trans
cends the self-confirming un
reality, inflexibility, and par
anoia which have the potential
to destroy our ability to act
meaningfully.
The main problem for present
day political action, whether
conducted in Chicago, along the
Pedernales, in Moscow, or on
University Avenue is Ihe cul
tural myth that effective ac
tion is indissolubly bound up
with knowledge of the"truth".
We also accept the corollary
myth thai (his knowledge is
somehow possible to attain.
Erudite texts on existential
thinking and the sociology of
knowledge have done little to
shake these beliefs.
This is only natural. Early in
life someone told each one of
us that in order to make it, he
had to have all the right an
swers. He was a liar.
The lie, however, is a plaus
ible one. Ever since Socrates,
Western Civilization has en
gaged, off and on, in what has
been termed (rather grotesque
ly, considering the results) "the
search for truth." In itself, this
isn't so bad; the process is con
ducive to finding out how little
it is possible to actually know.
The latter discovery can bring
about an enlightened humility
which in itself is a useful start
ing point.
The danger comes in the con
comitant supposition that truth

itself is discoverable and that
having found it, we can proceed
to build Utopia.
The twelve year indoctrination
process which this society en
forces on its members is a min
aturization and further bastardi
zation of the above. Those who
rio best at it win the prize: four
to ten years of further indoctrin
ation at places like Stanford.
In the process, the intellectual
presupposition that truth is to
be found in the pot at the end
of this particular rainbow usu
ally is transformed into a moral
imperative. If we don't know it
by now we cerlainly should. If
we should make the awful dis
covery that we do not—BANG!
twenty years of carefully con
structed self-image shot straight
to hell.
For political action, radical
and otherwise, the resulting
compulsive self righteousness
can easily lead to disaster.
