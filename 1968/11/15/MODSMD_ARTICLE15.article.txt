# There Is A War...

(EDITOR'S NOTE: The following letter was written by Steve
Siporin, a Stanford Senior, to his young nieee. Siporin turned
in his draft card at a White Plaza rally yesterday.)
Dearest Susan,
Now, as I write, you are 20 months old, a beautiful child.
And as you read, you may be many different ages. I am 21. I
met a man yesterday who was 70. We are all the same, Susan,
we are all the same. We are all good and valuable. And none
of us knows very much.
There is a war being fought today. Young men my age are
asked either to kill or quietly accept this killing. Thinking of
you, of your children someday and everything that loves to
breathe, I cannot choose either. Tomorrow, Nov. 14, 1968, I
will return my draft card in order to tell the people in Amer
ica that neither choice is acceptable. I want to ask them to
think about what they are doing.
Susan, if you had been born in Vietnam, the chances are
great that you;would not be alive now. But I have these pic
tures of .you alive and I know that nothing in the world could
justify my killing you or sending someone else to do it. So
I'm refusing, and hoping this act will help others to think.
As you see this is more than a political act. Righteousness
is not measured by success but by how one feels. I feel liber
ated. I feel free. I feel a great deal of love.
