• Disturbed
Editor, The Daily:
Your Monday editorial con
cerning the crowd dispersal and
arrests which climaxed last
Tuesday evening's lengthy "elec
tion wake" is disturbing on two
counts:
(1) the label "political sup
pression" which you apply to
the action of the Palo Alto po
lice;
(2) your warning to Chief Hy
die that "to continue dealing in
political suppression will only
mean a further undermining of

the respect for the Palo Alto po
lice and bringing on more vio
lent upheavals for Palo Alto."
The "suppression" to which
you object did not include, ap
apparently, interfering with the
march. The scene which greeted
my arrival later on was a crowd
spilling from Lytton Plaza out
into the streets, and a complete
absence of uniformed police of
ficers. It had aspects of a re
union of those who had gath
ered before at the Plaza and the
Old Union. There was no sup
pression, even after the police
marched up.
Finally most of us went back
to watching the election returns.
In the meantime, those who had
more than reunion or witness in
mind seemed to have license to
do their thing even though it
included burning trash contain
ers in the street, setting a plas
tic lamp shade on fire in the
Plaza, breaking a squad car
window, halting traffic, etc.
Except for a half-hearted at
tempt to clear the intersection,
the officers stood meekly by.
They might have been meditat
ing. Conceivably a few shared
some of the same frustrations
which called forth the wake.
It is too bad that some of the
"mourners" stuck around to see
the last dog hung. It seems likely
that those arrested got only
what they sincerely wanted. Un
der the circumstances, your
warning to the Chief seems ill
advised.

Your November 13 editorial re
garding TA demands stated that
"Salaries are at the poverty lev
el" ($2300 plus $1100 tuition
credit). In an effort to find a
definition for poverty level I con
verted the 32 weeks of half-time
work to full time for 12 months
and find the poverty level sal
ary to be $11,000 per year.

Editor, The Daily:
What a wonderful new order
we approach. Included in this
new order will be two groups
which, after Orwell, I will call
the "more equal" and the "less
equal." The New Ethics, though
not finalized, seem to include the
following:
It is all right for the more
equal to block traffic of cars
driven by the less equal.
It is all right for the more
equal to take over a city plaza
arid cause any disturbance they
wish, so long as the only people
disturbed are the less equal.
It is all right for the more
equal to start fires on city
streets. It is up to the less equal
to put them out.
It is all right for the more
equal to throw bricks at the less
equal.
The more equal are not to be
punished for breaking laws
made for the less equal.
I suppose I should join the
more equal before they throw a
brick at me.

Anyone is a baby who wants
the University to operate as a

mune to responsibility for his

PAT BLACK

Editor, The Daily:
Your Monday editorial con
cerning the crowd dispersal and
arrests which climaxed last
Tuesday evening's lengthy "elec
tion wake" is disturbing on two
counts:
(1) the label "political sup
pression" which you apply to
the action of the Palo Alto po
lice;
(2) your warning to Chief Hy
die that "to continue dealing in
political suppression will only
mean a further undermining of

the respect for the Palo Alto po
lice and bringing on more vio
lent upheavals for Palo Alto."
The "suppression" to which
you object did not include, ap
apparently, interfering with the
march. The scene which greeted
my arrival later on was a crowd
spilling from Lytton Plaza out
into the streets, and a complete
absence of uniformed police of
ficers. It had aspects of a re
union of those who had gath
ered before at the Plaza and the
Old Union. There was no sup
pression, even after the police
marched up.
Finally most of us went back
to watching the election returns.
In the meantime, those who had
more than reunion or witness in
mind seemed to have license to
do their thing even though it
included burning trash contain
ers in the street, setting a plas
tic lamp shade on fire in the
Plaza, breaking a squad car
window, halting traffic, etc.
Except for a half-hearted at
tempt to clear the intersection,
the officers stood meekly by.
They might have been meditat
ing. Conceivably a few shared
some of the same frustrations
which called forth the wake.
It is too bad that some of the
"mourners" stuck around to see
the last dog hung. It seems likely
that those arrested got only
what they sincerely wanted. Un
der the circumstances, your
warning to the Chief seems ill
advised.

What a wonderful new order
we approach. Included in this
new order will be two groups
which, after Orwell, I will call
the "more equal" and the "less

following:
It is all right for the more
equal to block traffic of cars
driven by the less equal.
It is all right for the more
equal to take over a city plaza
arid cause any disturbance they

disturbed are the less equal.
It is all right for the more
