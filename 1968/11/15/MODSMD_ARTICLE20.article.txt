# Biologist Ehrlich 'Scared' Of Over-Population Threat
## 
### JEFF SCHUTT 
Stanford biologist Paul R.
Ehrlich is rather depressed these
days. His lack of good cheer is
due to his pessimism about
man's chances for avoiding
worldwide famine, plagues and
wars caused by overpopulation.
"It is within man's power to
change the odds more in our
favor, but we aren't doing it,"
he said in a recent interview.
Professor Ehrlich has been
crusading for the last several
years, trying to halt the growth
of world population. He has
spoken before groups like teach
ers' and physicians' organiza
tions, written articles and books,
and presented his views over
radio and television across the
nation.
Ehrlich's owh evaluation of
the results of this intense ac
tivity is not encouraging. If the
number of people you have
talked to is an index of success,
then, he said, he has done very
well by reaching millions of
people through television and
radio around the country. "But
it is much more difficult to mea
sure the attitude change," he
noted.
There have been polls In the
past indicating that as few as
one per cent of U.S. citizens
consider overpopulation a real
problem. Ehrlich feels that if
this percentage were found to
be greater today, it would be a
positive indication of his having
had some effect. His mail is 97
per cent favorable. But it is im
possible to say whether or not
this just means that only people
who are aroused and aware of
the problem bother to write.
Party Platforms
"There has been some prog
ress with the Establishment:
brief statements buried in the
platforms of both major parties
and recognition of the problem
by McNamara, Humphrey, and
Johnson," he admits. There has
definitely been slow and steady
movement forward, but the
problem is definitely not moving
slowly, Ehrlich says.
"Many factors other than food
are rapidly becoming critical,
any one of which could wreck
things completely," Ehrlich said.
Pollution could literally poison
the world. In this age of mobility
and malnutrition a plague, espe
cially one caused by a man-made
biological warfare germ, could
spread rapidly. Increased popu
lation also adds to political un
rest and raises the chance of
nuclear war.
Ehrlich has received much

support from other biologists.
Ecologists and population biolo
gists have been virtually unani
mous on his behalf. But Ehrlich
says that "technological opti
mists, who refuse to look at re
sources more than 30 years
ahead and then somehow plan
to repeal the laws of thermo
dynamics, keep lulling the peo
ple to sleep."
Unhelpful Colleague
An example of an unhelpful
scientist is near at hand. Stan
ford Emeritus Professor Karl
Brandt, in the Sept. 15 Sunday
Examiner and Chronicle stated
that there should be more peo
ple. He felt that every nation
which made the effort could pro
duce enough food to feed its
population. Ehrlich called these
views "preposterous." "Brandt,"
he said, with one press release,
"undid everything I could have
done in the last year."
The Population Bomb, Ehr
lich's latest book, was published
July 8. The original edition, pub

lished by Ballantlne Books, was
paperbound. Normal practice is
to first publish a hardcover edi
tion before publishing a paper
back, but he wanted to have the
book available to as many peo
ple as possible during the elec
tion year. The book has been a
success relative to other books
on the subject, he said, largely
because it is less technical. But
the main impact of it has been
in increased access to television
time, as he feels that "the be
havior of people is unlikely to
be changed with anything that
has to be read."
Of his cause, Ehrlich says,
"I'm scared out of my mind." He
would like to see the world go
on for more than 10 or 15 years.
But no nation has stabilized its
population or appears able to
do so. "We emphasize only the
people - food - resources relation
ship, not the environmental
changes," he said. "My daughter
will not have the chance to live
the kind of life that I have now."
