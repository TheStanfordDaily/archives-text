### 
A first-of-a-kind program de
signed to develop small business
in Bay Area ghettos has been
launched by the Graduate
School of Business in conjunc
tion with Volunteers In Service
To America (VISTA).
Ten VISTA volunteers, includ
ing eight men with graduate
business training from Stanford,

entrepreneui's and co-operative
groups increase the number of
ghetto-owned and ghetto-man
aged businesses.
The eight men are Frank W.
Wentworth, David S. Gordon,
John W. Schelling, James M.
Gullard, Reese Shepard, Eric L.

week orientation for the volun
teers and acts as liaison between
VISTA and the volunteers. The
orientation included three weeks
of special small business train
ing at the Stanford Business
School.
This is the first known VISTA
program to make such use of
specialized business skills., Ac

to requests for help. "They're
telling us what it is they want,"
said Tooker.

gram, the volunteers are assign
ed to work only through com
munity organizations which
have requested help from

management training and
searching for increased capital
investment in local businesses.

and supervision. The volunteers
are required to reside as well
as work in the ghettos during
their one-year tours of service.
Each receives a $150-a-month

The program coordinator, Dr.
Gary G. Williams, directed a six
week orientation for the volun
teers and acts as liaison between
VISTA and the volunteers. The
orientation included three weeks
of special small business train
ing at the Stanford Business
School.
This is the first known VISTA
program to make such use of
specialized business skills., Ac

cording to Charles Tooker,
VISTA's western regional di
rector, the Stanford-VISTA pro
ject was developed in response
to requests for help. "They're
telling us what it is they want,"
said Tooker.
Under the terms of the pro
gram, the volunteers are assign
ed to work only through com
munity organizations which
have requested help from
VISTA. Their primary activities
include management assistance,
management training and
searching for increased capital
investment in local businesses.
Some of the cooperating com
munity organizations include
the San Francisco Local De
velopment Corporation, the Oak
land Small Business Develop
ment. Center and the Black Com
munity Relations Association in
East Palo Alto, a VISTA-funded
agency concerned with economic
and community development.
Stanford participation is sup
ported by a VISTA grant of
$15,000 which covers training
and supervision. The volunteers
are required to reside as well
as work in the ghettos during
their one-year tours of service.
Each receives a $150-a-month
stipend for living expenses.
