(AP) — Dissident faculty
members at San Francisco State
College jammed State's Little
Theatre to discuss closing of the
school, ordered abruptly Wed
nesday night after a week of
violence and vandalism by strik
ing students.
The 500 teachers at the emer
gency session agreed to 'respect
fully' ask for the reinstatement
of George Murray, a controver
sial black instructor.
A spokesman for Glenn Dum
ke, state college chancellor, said
that "Mr. Dumke will not rein
state Mr. Murray."
The action came during a two
hour meeting on the almost de
serted campus. The resolution
was approved by a narrow mar
gin. It asked Dumke to "imme
diately withdraw his order in
respect to George Murray.
Murray, an English instructor
and member of the Black Pan
ther Party for Self-Defence, was
ordered suspended by Dumke
with pay for 30 days for urging
black students to carry guns on
campus. The faculty resolution
urged that "the normal disci
plinary procedures of this col
lege" should be used to deal
with the situation.
President Robert D. Smith,
who ordered the suspension of
classes, addressed the crowded
meeting. He indicated that he
was in no hurry to reopen the
campus until all the problems
have been resolved.
An action that may in some
degree ease tensions was anoth
er resolution passed at the fac
ulty meeting. By voice vote, the
teachers approved a motion ask
ing Smith to "give substance to
the Black Studies Department,"
a major issue leading to cam
pus violence.
The faculty members called
for authorization of eleven
teaching posts in the department
by next spring, the program get
ting under way while funds are
being allocated.
"Once the faculty is assigned
and curriculum is developed the
Black Studies Department will
be conceived in the same way as
other departments with the same
degree of autonomy and con
trol," said the resolution.
"Ultimately, but not immedi
ately, it will be expected to justi
fy its faculty allotment by the
same criteria as other depart
ments."
There was also an accompany
ing referendum to be presented
to the entire faculty which con
tain eleven points to be voted
upon. They coyer the entire

spectrum of the college's pro
grams—social, academic, a pos
sible censure of Dumke, the
questions surrounding instruc
tor Murray, the feasibility of a
faculty strike, and the 10 de
mands of the Black Student Un
ion.
The reaction of various state
officials is in no way surprising.
Gov. Ronald Reagan issued a
statement calling the closure
"an unprecedented act of irre
sponsibility" and accused the
school administration of "capitu
lation . . . surrender." He called
for a prompt repoening of the
strife-torn campus.
"The people of this state, the
people who pay the bills, want
it that way. And that is the way
it will be," Reagan said.
