# Host Countries Aiding Peace Corps Program
## 
### 
"Two years ago I wouldn't
have set foot in the United
States," says John Exeter, a 26-
year old teacher from Guyana,
in South America. "Since then
the Peace Corps has come to
my school and I have come to
realize how much we have to
contribute to each other."
Exeter is still a citizen of Guy
ana, but this year he will spend
most of his time visiting US col
leges and universities as a re
cruiter for the Peace Corps. He
will be part of a five-man team
to visit Stanford next week
(November 18-22) as Peace
Corps undertakes to sign up vol
unteers for its 1969 programs.
It is the first time in the seven
year history of the Peace Corps
that nationals of Peace Corps
host countries have joined in
the agency's recruiting effort.
Before the current academic
year ends, the Peace Corps
hopes to have a total of 16 host
country nationals in recruiting
—four at each of four Peace
Corps regional centers—accord
ing to Bill Niederberger, repre
sentative for the Peninsula area.
Host Country Recruiters
All the host country recruiters
have previously worked with the
Peace Corps, either in their
homelands or at training sites in
the United States. They were
chosen jointly by the Peace
Corps and their governments,
and in most cases their trans
portation to the United States
was paid by the host country.
"Increasingly, host country
nationals are playing important
parts in Peace Corps planning,
operations and training," said
agency director Jack Vaughn. "I

am especially pleased that they
are now participating in the re
cruitment of volunteers."
For Exeter, it is his first trip
to the United States, the coun
try that two years ago he had
thought he would never visit. He
recalled his first reaction to the
Peace Corps:
'American Nonsense'?
"When Volunteers first came
to Guyana, I thought it was just
some American nonsense, or
maybe part of the CIA—I didn't
have a very good opinion of the
United States, you see.
"Then the Peace Corps sent a
young lady to teach at the school
where I taught. Bless her soul,
she was very patient with me,

because I did not give her a very
kind welcome.
"But we began to talk," he
continued, "and I met other
members of the Peace Corps and
saw they were not what I had
expected — these were young
Americans, young people, who
really wanted to make an effort,
not just for the United States,
but for my country and for hu
man understanding as well."
The Peace Corps group plans
to work extensively with the
Stanford Committee of Returned
Volunteers and the International
Center. A schedule of events for
the recruiting week will be an
nounced later.
