## Birthday Party 
### GARY SALT 
There is a good thing in a
small package at the Nitery
Theatre. The production of The
Birthday Party, which opened
last Wednesday evening, is well
conceived and generally well
acted. Both director and cast
have achieved some measure of
success in penetrating the im
probable, recondite situation
that Pinter has created.
Pinter's dialogue and action
have a recognizable style—
words are elusive, chaotic, nasty
and often very funny, the action
is intriguing but usually oblique
and superficial, concealing cruel
and dense implications.
The play is set in the soot
smeared, lower middle-class flat
of Meg and Petey Boyles. Petey
is an insouciant, good-natured
man, willing to suffer quietly
through breakfasts of fried
bread and capable of making a
living as a deck chair attendant.
Meg shuffles from kitchen to
supermarket and constantly
wears the vacant, quirky grin
reserved for those who are
slightly pixilated. It's Meg's pol
icy to be concerned about what's
going on around her even
though she is bewildered by it.
Louise Schimmel . is delightful
as Meg. She captures a little bit
of everybody's mother in her
characterization as well as the
sense of Meg's harmless yet
pathetic ignorance. John Davis
turns in a solid performance and
plays accurately beside Miss
Schimmel.
Petey and Meg have a boarder
named Stanley and insofar as
we can be secure with any in
formation Pinter gives us, we
may say that Stanley has been
a refugee in their household for
about a year.
Stanley purports to be an ex

concert pianist who has, for
some reason, become a full-time
fugitive from the world. He's a
grubby, disheveled loafer who
doesn't give a damn about any
thing until two curious visitors
pop up. Goldberg, the apparent
leader, is a smartly attired Jew
who maintains a good "position"
and lives by the best Christian
principles. McCann is a burly,
Irish "enforcer" who resembles
appropriately enough, a do
frocked priest.
Like two garbagemen, they
have come to collect Stanley and
in the process they became a fe
rocious demolition team. Carillo
Gantner and Chris Bennion are
both strong performers and the
play's tempo is spirited when
ever they are around. These two
neatly execute what is surely
the highlight of the play—a rit
ualized interrogation of Stanley,
moving around him, bombard
ing him with insults and ques
tions, mesmerizing him with a
flashlight during the party,
gnawing unmercifully, until he
is reduced to a mental corpse,
a well-adjusted Mensch.
Stanley's Disintegration
Bert Nagel siezes beautifully
on the numbness and vulgarity
of Stanley's disintegration, or
perhaps it is his re-integration,
and clearly comes to grips with
the problems of restless inactiv
ity and eventual mental and
physical collapse.
All three, Gantner, Bennion,
and Nagel develop Stanley's con
dition with precision. Stanley
could be a Kafkian hero but,
to the credit of William Sharp,
he is not. Stanley knows what is
happening. The problem is to
outfit us, as audience, with
enough equipment to be able
to assess his situation. This pro
duction does that.

fugitive from the world. He's a
grubby, disheveled loafer who
doesn't give a damn about any
thing until two curious visitors
pop up. Goldberg, the apparent
leader, is a smartly attired Jew
who maintains a good "position"
and lives by the best Christian
principles. McCann is a burly,
Irish "enforcer" who resembles
appropriately enough, a do
frocked priest.
Like two garbagemen, they
have come to collect Stanley and
in the process they became a fe
rocious demolition team. Carillo
Gantner and Chris Bennion are
both strong performers and the
play's tempo is spirited when
ever they are around. These two
neatly execute what is surely
the highlight of the play—a rit
ualized interrogation of Stanley,
moving around him, bombard
ing him with insults and ques
tions, mesmerizing him with a
flashlight during the party,
gnawing unmercifully, until he
is reduced to a mental corpse,
a well-adjusted Mensch.
Stanley's Disintegration
Bert Nagel siezes beautifully
on the numbness and vulgarity
of Stanley's disintegration, or
perhaps it is his re-integration,
and clearly comes to grips with
the problems of restless inactiv
ity and eventual mental and
physical collapse.
All three, Gantner, Bennion,
and Nagel develop Stanley's con
dition with precision. Stanley
could be a Kafkian hero but,
to the credit of William Sharp,
he is not. Stanley knows what is
happening. The problem is to
outfit us, as audience, with
enough equipment to be able
to assess his situation. This pro
duction does that.
There is a good thing in a
small package at the Nitery
Theatre. The production of The
Birthday Party, which opened
last Wednesday evening, is well
conceived and generally well
acted. Both director and cast
have achieved some measure of
success in penetrating the im
probable, recondite situation
that Pinter has created.
Pinter's dialogue and action
have a recognizable style—
words are elusive, chaotic, nasty
and often very funny, the action
is intriguing but usually oblique
and superficial, concealing cruel
and dense implications.
The play is set in the soot
smeared, lower middle-class flat
of Meg and Petey Boyles. Petey
is an insouciant, good-natured
man, willing to suffer quietly
through breakfasts of fried
bread and capable of making a
living as a deck chair attendant.
Meg shuffles from kitchen to
supermarket and constantly
wears the vacant, quirky grin
reserved for those who are
slightly pixilated. It's Meg's pol
icy to be concerned about what's
going on around her even
though she is bewildered by it.
Louise Schimmel . is delightful
as Meg. She captures a little bit
of everybody's mother in her
characterization as well as the
sense of Meg's harmless yet
pathetic ignorance. John Davis
turns in a solid performance and
plays accurately beside Miss
Schimmel.
Petey and Meg have a boarder
named Stanley and insofar as
we can be secure with any in
formation Pinter gives us, we
may say that Stanley has been
a refugee in their household for
about a year.
Stanley purports to be an ex

concert pianist who has, for
some reason, become a full-time
