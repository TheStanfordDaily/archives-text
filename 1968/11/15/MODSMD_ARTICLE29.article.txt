## Stanford Indian On Display

Remains of the earliest known
inhabitants of Ihe San Francisco
Bay Area are on exhibit in the
lobby of the Anthropology De
partment on the Inner Quad.
The artifacts and other items
were discovered in 1951 — dur
ing construction of an East Palo
Alto housing development. Stan
ford professor Bert A. Gerow
directed the excavation of nearly
60 graves in the former burial
grounds.
It is speculated that the East
Palo Alto Indians were refugees
from a more warlike people who
drove them out of the richer
Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley
region.
"We are of the opinion that
the number of graves and the
quantity of associated grave
goods . . . are sufficient to estab
lish the presence, approximately
3,000 to 3,500 years ago, of an
Early Period type of culture at
the south end of San Francisco
Bay," explains Gerow.
The East Palo Alto Indians
seem to be much more closely
related to some of the earliest
known peoples of California
than to the Delta Indians, he
says in a report of the findings.
"Of 43 skeletons, 35 are classi

fiahle as adults, four as adoles
cents, three as children, and one
as an infant," said Prof. Gerow.
"The general state of preserva
tion of human and animal bone
and artifacts other than stone is
poor, but highly variable. Leach
ing and the deposition of calci
um deposits on the one hand,
and the human practice of pre
interment burning pit fires on
the other, seem chiefly responsi
ble for their condition.
Burial PraxTtiees
"Apparently a shallow grave
pit was first dug, and the fire
built on the bottom. The body,
along with the grave offerings or
possessions of the deceased, was
then placed on the hot coals. Fi
nally, the consuming action of
the fire was halted by throwing
dirt over the body.
"Since evidence of the pre
interment burnings was most no
ticeable in the case of the richest
graves, it is possible this prac
tice was reserved for more im
portant individuals," Gerow said.
In aboriginal times the Bay
Area appears to have been a cul
turally backward region, Gerow
said. The contents of the Delta
burials, for example, included
more elaborate tools and jewel
ry; bodies were interred in an
extended position, on their stom
achs, and pointed westward.
Random Positions
Flexed or seated burial posi
tions in random directions char
acterized the East Palo Alto
graves, together with quantities
of powdered red ochre, whole
shell beads, stone seed-grinding
implements, and bone fishhooks.
These indicate a closer relation
to some of the earliest Indians
found buried in Southern Cali
fornia and on its Channel Is
lands.
Furthermore, the East Palo
Altans appeared to have been
longer-browed and smaller in
stature than the Delta Indians,
again relating them more closely

to the Southern Californians.
Similar characteristics also have
been noted among Indian burials
in the extreme northern part of
the state, Gerow said.
The Stanford anthropologist
theorized that the Delta Indians,
who spoke the Penutian lan
guage, were stronger, more war
like people who drove the Ho
kan - speaking Indians out of
Central California areas such as
the Delta region, rich in fish,
game, and lush growth. Remains
of the older Hokan-speakers are
thus found in peripheral areas of
the state to which they may have
retreated.
Plant Foods Important
"Plant foods were undoubtedly
important in the aboriginal diet,"
he said, "judging from the num
ber of mortars and pestles re
covered. But actual evidence is
limited to a few charred wild on
ion bulbs which were a grave
association.
"The relatively large number
of graves in relation to the small
amount of human (refuse) tends
to characterize the site as a
cemetery which was visited and
camped upon from time to time,
rather than as a permanent set
tlement," Gerow concluded.


EAST PALO ALTO DIG —yielded remains of the oldest known in
habitants of the San Francisco Bay Area. Stanford Anthropology
Prof. Bert A. Gerow and Mrs. Maryanne Force, wife of his co-in
vestigator on the project, are seen uncovering one of the Indian
graves at the time of their discovery during construction of a hous
ing development.
