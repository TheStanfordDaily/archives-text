## 
### 
In the aftermath of Wednes
day's campus arrests the Aca
demic Senate yesterday voted to
deplore the action of the Palo
Aito Police Department in mak
ing arrests on campus without
consulting University officials.
Faculty representatives adopt
ed the carefully worded resolu
tion by voice vote. The resolu
tion said in part that the Sen
ate "deplored the action of the
Palo Alto Police Department
in making arrests on campus
without consulting the proper
University officials as to the
possible conseqeunees for the

University and the surrounding
communities."
The representatives unani
mously urged improved com
munication "through efforts by
the Administration to apprise
the Palo Alto Police Department
of the special nature and prob
lems of an academic commun
ity."
The action followed several
discussions throughout the day
between Acting President Rob
ert J. Glaser, Provost Richard
Lyman, Student Body President
Denis Hayes, Palo Alto City
Manager George Morgan, and
Police Chief William Hydie.
"Productive Session"
In an interview with The
Daily Glaser characterized his
discussion with City Manager
Morgan as a "productive ses
sion."
He said that he and Richard
Lvman spoke to Morgan of
Wednesday's events in some
length in an effort "to avoid
problems of this sort in the fu
ture." He emphasized that Mor
gan was "extremely coopera
tive."
Earlier Glaser conferred with
a five-man faculty group estab
lished by the Academic Senate
at his request to provide advice
and counsel in "handling situa
tions where disruption of Uni
versity activities is threatened."
The group includes Prof. Wil
liam Clebsch, religion and hu
manities; Jonathan Friedman,
psychology; Gerland Gunther,
Arthur Kornberg, biochemistry
and William Rambo, electrical
engineering.
Freed yesterday on hail were
Marc Sapir. fourth year medical
student from East Palo Alto
charged with failure to disperse
and sought since Nov. 8 and
James E. Johnson, senior in
chemical engineering, also from

East Palo Alto.
Johnson was charged with
"failure to disperse" and "dis
turbing the peace" a few hours
before his arrest in Tresidder
Memorial Union.
Johnson was arrested shortly
after 3 p.m. while eating with
Associate Prof. H. Bruce Frank
lin of the English Department,
who is free on bail after being
charged with "failure to dis
perse" at the Nov. 5 downtown
rally.
Poso said the warrant for
Johnson was issued Wednesday
morning. After clearing with the
County Sheriff's Office. Poso
went to the Stanford Police De
partment around 2 p.m. Look
ing up Johnson in the Student
Directory, he asked Stanford
Police Inspector Donald Lilly to
accompany him around campus
—a practice normally followed
by officers making an arrest out
side their immediate jurisdic
tion.
They went to Tresidder Union,
checking the bowling alley, cof
fee house, and pool room before
Poso spotted Johnson in the
cafeteria and made the arrest.
Poso said he has made num
erous arrests on campus for
a variety of complaints. About
six to eight months ago, he ar
rested a woman employee on a
check passing charge. He said
he had made no attempt to con
tact Johnson at home because
he felt he would probably be
on campus.
Police Chief Hydie said there
was "nothing irregular" in the
way the campus arrests were
made. He also maintained there
was "no unusual elapse of time"
between the alleged violation
and the arrest, saying that time
was needed to establish identi
fication. check witnesses, and file
a complaint.
