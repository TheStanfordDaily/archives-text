# Adding A Story?
## Bookstore May Expand 
### MARYBETH FOX 
Negotiating to double the size
of the building, calling London
to trace a book, ordering books
for next quarter, and planning
to improve service are among
the activities of the Stanford
bookstore.
Founded in 1897, the book
store is incorporated as an in
dependent non-profit coopera
tive association whose purpose
is to serve the student body and
faculty.
Thirty faculty members from
all disciplines make up the asso
ciation. This group elects a
president, vice-president, secre
tary, and two board members.
The Stanford bookstore is the
only college bookstore in the
country to offer a discount at
the time of sale. While the Yale
bookstore gives a discount of
eleven per cent to those who
save their sales slips over a se
mester, the Stanford store ex
tends its discount of eight per
cent to all students and faculty
members.
Variety of Items
The board of directors tries to
limit items to those that are
needed for classes, but some con
veniences such as alarm clocks
are sold. Posters, records, and
prints are carried because they
are regarded as educational
items.
Books are chosen not only on
the basis of what students nor
mally read. According to Ivan
Sanderson, associate general
manager, an educational book
store should "present a chal
lenge and show both sides of a
picture." The bookstore current
ly has a display concerning
Communist China and North
Vietnam.
The bookstore's bestsellers in
clothbound fiction are "First
Circle" by Solzhenitsyn, "Home
Fires Burning" by Harris, and
"Preserve and Protect" by Dru
ry. The paperbound fiction best
sellers are "Man With a Maid"

by Avon, "Favorite Game" by
Cohen, and "Walking Stick" by
Graham.
Non-fiction
Clothbound nonfiction best
sellers are "Soul on Ice" by
and Cobbs, and "How to Kill a
Cleaver, "Black Rage" by Frier
Golden State" by Bronson. "Pop
lation Bomb by Erlich, "Auto
biography of Malcolm X" by
Haley, and "Death at an Early
Age" by Kozol are the paper
bound non-fiction favorites. Sier
ra Club posters are the most
popular.

One of the bookstores main
problems is fast operation. San
derson said, "I was appalled at
the lines at the beginning of
the quarter."
If the board of trustees in De
cember approves plans to add
onto the bookstore, the book
store will be able to move its
warehouse to the campus and
have a complete new top floor
for texts. The addition would be
to the south of the present build
ing, and architecture would aim
at "synthesizing the old and
new."
