# Shockley, Bleymaier Star
## Papooses Subdue SJS 
### BOB FEDUNIAK 
The Stanford Papooses redis
covered their ground game last
week and combined it with Ted
Bleymaier's passing to defeat
San Jose State 40-30 in their
season finale.
Fullback Hilary Shockley
rushed for 106 yards and 3 TD's
in 19 carries, while halfback
Jackie Brown scored once and
netted 96 yards in 20 attempts.
Meanwhile, Bleymaier completed
15 of his 20 passes for 190
yards and another tally to round
out the impressive offensive dis
play.
San Jose opened the scoring
with a two-yard plunge by Bill
Jones in the first quarter, but
then Stanford reeled off five
straight TD's while completely
containing the Spartan offense.
The first Indian score came
on a beautiful 26-yard aerial
from Bleymaier to flanker Don
Alvarado, who had another out
standing day with six receptions
for 121 yards.
Shockley then scored twice in
the second period on one yard
plunges, and the Indians left the

field at halftime leading 21-6.
After intermission, Brown
chalked up his first score of the
year on a six-yard carry, and
Shockley followed with another
one-yarder to run the tally to
33-6 and put the game out of the
Spartans' reach.
Throughout this onslaught,
San Jose was relying heavily on
a ground game that looked as
though it wouldn't net 20 yards
for the whole game. It didn't.
Former high school All-America
Pete Lazetich, making his first
appearance of the year after re
covering from a leg injury, led
an aggressive defensive line that
completely shut off the run,
while putting heavy pressure on
the Spartan quarterback.
Too Little, Too Late
Finally, down by 27 points late
in the third period, San Jose
discovered they could move the
ball with long passes. This they
did, covering 83 yards in three
plays to narrow the gap to 33-14
on a ten-yard pass play and a
two point conversion.
But it was to no avail, as Pa
poose lineman Dave Grossi

upped the margin again by re
covering a blocked Spartan punt
in the end zone early in the
fourth quarter. Greg Sampson
converted his third PAT of the
afternoon to make it 40-14.
San Jose scored twice more
in the final period, moving the
ball well with more long passes,
but the outcome of the game
was never in doubt. When the
gun sounded, Coach Jim Tropp
man and his team left the field
with an impressive victory, a 2-2
record, and the wish that their
season could last just a little bit
longer.
Season statistics revealed that
fullback Shockley was the
team's leading ballcarrier, gain
ing 294 yards on 66 attempts.
He also led the team in scoring,
with four touchdowns.
Potent Pass Game
The Bleymaier -to - Alvarado
combination gave Stanford a
lethal passing attack throughout
the season, and the statistics
bear this out. Bleymaier com
pleted 39 of 72 aerials for 571
yards and 3 touchdowns. Alva
rado caught 19 passes for 308
yards and 2 touchdowns.
Defensively, linebacker Jeff
Siemon led the team in tackles,
despite playing only two games.
Siemon made 12 unassisted stops
and was in on 35 others, for a
total of 47 tackles in two con
tests.
Defensive halfback Jim Loda
to, middle guard Grossi, and
tackle Mike Reinhard also were
outstanding defensive efforts
cited by Coach Troppman for
during the year.

PAPOOSE WORKHORSE —Freshman fullback Hilary Shockley drives through a hole over center
during last week's 40-30 victory over San Jose State. Shockley, who scored three touchdowns for
Coach Jim Troppman's crew, wound up as the team's leading scorer and ground-gainer for the sea
son.
The Stanford Papooses redis
covered their ground game last
week and combined it with Ted
Bleymaier's passing to defeat
San Jose State 40-30 in their
season finale.
Fullback Hilary Shockley
rushed for 106 yards and 3 TD's
in 19 carries, while halfback
Jackie Brown scored once and
netted 96 yards in 20 attempts.
Meanwhile, Bleymaier completed
15 of his 20 passes for 190
yards and another tally to round
out the impressive offensive dis
play.
San Jose opened the scoring
with a two-yard plunge by Bill
Jones in the first quarter, but
then Stanford reeled off five
straight TD's while completely
containing the Spartan offense.
The first Indian score came
on a beautiful 26-yard aerial
from Bleymaier to flanker Don
Alvarado, who had another out
standing day with six receptions
for 121 yards.
Shockley then scored twice in
the second period on one yard
plunges, and the Indians left the

field at halftime leading 21-6.
After intermission, Brown
chalked up his first score of the
year on a six-yard carry, and
Shockley followed with another
one-yarder to run the tally to
33-6 and put the game out of the
Spartans' reach.
Throughout this onslaught,
San Jose was relying heavily on
a ground game that looked as
though it wouldn't net 20 yards
for the whole game. It didn't.
Former high school All-America
Pete Lazetich, making his first
appearance of the year after re
covering from a leg injury, led
an aggressive defensive line that
completely shut off the run,
while putting heavy pressure on
the Spartan quarterback.
Too Little, Too Late
Finally, down by 27 points late
in the third period, San Jose
discovered they could move the
ball with long passes. This they
did, covering 83 yards in three
plays to narrow the gap to 33-14
on a ten-yard pass play and a
two point conversion.
But it was to no avail, as Pa
poose lineman Dave Grossi

upped the margin again by re
covering a blocked Spartan punt
in the end zone early in the
fourth quarter. Greg Sampson
converted his third PAT of the
afternoon to make it 40-14.
San Jose scored twice more
in the final period, moving the
ball well with more long passes,
but the outcome of the game
was never in doubt. When the
gun sounded, Coach Jim Tropp
man and his team left the field
with an impressive victory, a 2-2
record, and the wish that their
season could last just a little bit
longer.
Season statistics revealed that
fullback Shockley was the
team's leading ballcarrier, gain
ing 294 yards on 66 attempts.
He also led the team in scoring,
with four touchdowns.
