### FRED LEESON 
Freshman Paul Gerken en
trenched himself as the univer
sity's top tennis player Monday
afternoon, easily winning the
Stanford Tennis championships.
Gerken vanquished Paul Mari
enthal in sets of 6-0 and 6-1 to
claim the title.
"He hardly made a mistake in
the whole match," commented

number one varsity singles play

Mac Claflin 6-1, 3-6, 7-5, who had

15-13.
"We had a lot of good
matches," Gould added, pointing
to a number of surprises.
In the second round, freshman
John Wright upset Dean Schlo

bohm, senior, 1-6, 6-2, 6-3, and
Rick Evans, another freshman,
battled Spiegel to sets of 5-7 and
8-8 before defaulting with a back
ailment.
Tomorrow the Stanford var
sity and freshman teams will
play in the Pajaro Dunes Exhibi
tion, an event which Gould rates
as the top exhibition in northern
California this fall.
The varsity will play seven
singles and three doubles
matches against the freshmen,
and two other special exhibitions
have also been scheduled. Play
will begin at 11 a.m.
Spiegel and Gerken will square
off in first singles and Marien
thal and Claflin will face each
other in second singles.
Pasarell will meet Wright and
Chuck Alloo will take on Chris
Chapin in third and fourth sin
gles. The fifth will feature Ron
Kahn and Evens, followed by

plete surprise. Earlier this year the talented freshman upset the
nation's top-ranked tennis player, Arthur Ashe.
Freshman Paul Gerken en
trenched himself as the univer
sity's top tennis player Monday
afternoon, easily winning the
Stanford Tennis championships.
Gerken vanquished Paul Mari
enthal in sets of 6-0 and 6-1 to
claim the title.
"He hardly made a mistake in
the whole match," commented
Coach Dick Gould concerning
the finale. Gerken was never
pushed to a full three sets in
any of his five matches, his clos
est win being a 6-3, 6-4 victory
over John Spiegel, last season's
number one varsity singles play
er.
Marienthal reached the title
match by defeating freshman
Mac Claflin 6-1, 3-6, 7-5, who had
in turn upset Stan Pasarell, last
year's top frosh player, 6-3, 3-6,
15-13.
"We had a lot of good
matches," Gould added, pointing
to a number of surprises.
In the second round, freshman
John Wright upset Dean Schlo

bohm, senior, 1-6, 6-2, 6-3, and
Rick Evans, another freshman,
battled Spiegel to sets of 5-7 and
8-8 before defaulting with a back
ailment.
Tomorrow the Stanford var
sity and freshman teams will
play in the Pajaro Dunes Exhibi
tion, an event which Gould rates
as the top exhibition in northern
California this fall.
The varsity will play seven
singles and three doubles
matches against the freshmen,
and two other special exhibitions
have also been scheduled. Play
will begin at 11 a.m.
Spiegel and Gerken will square
off in first singles and Marien
thal and Claflin will face each
other in second singles.
Pasarell will meet Wright and
Chuck Alloo will take on Chris
Chapin in third and fourth sin
gles. The fifth will feature Ron
Kahn and Evens, followed by
Brad Cornell against Bill Rompf,
and John Shepard playing Robin
Fry in sixth and seventh singles.
Line-ups for the doubles have
yet to be announced.
