# Indians Eye Sky-High Tigers
## 
### GARY CAVALI 
Stanford takes a day off from
the Pacific-8 football wars to
morrow, but it will be anything
but a vacation.
The Indians, who regained
their winning form last week
against Washington, will battle
a streaking University of Pacific
team in Stockton at 2:00 p.m.
The Tigers have won their last
five games in a row, and have
an extremely fast, explosive
ballclub. The only common op
ponent for Stanford and UOP
has been San Jose State, who
the Indians crushed 68-20 and
the Tigers shut out 28-0.
Saturday's game will be
Homecoming for the Tigers,
who figure to be out to prove

they can beat a big-name schooL
"They'll be so fired up over
there that it's unbelievable," re
marked Stanford coach John
Ralston early this week. Yester
day UOP coach Doug Scovil re
ported his squad was "higher
than a kite" after a great week
of practice.
UOP started the '68 campaign
with an impressive 21-20 upset
of Miami of Ohio, but then ab
sorbed back-to-back losses to
West Texas State and Idaho.
The following week against
Santa Clara the offense jelled,
as the Tigers prevailed 30-22.
Since then it's been all uphill,
as roll-out quarterback Mickey
Ackley, fullback A 1 Namanny,
and halfback Chuck Camy have

paced the Stockton squad to
easy wins over Utah State, Colo
rado State, San Jose State, and
UC Santa Barbara.
Ackley, a southpaw who leads
the team in total offense with
1164 yards, chipped his left
thumb against Santa Barbara
and may see only part-time duty
tomorrow.
Whenever Ackley isn't avail
able, Pacific coach Doug Scovil
will counter with junior Dand
Bergstrom, an excellent thrower.
QB Shuffle
Scovil indicated early this
week that he plans to use both
quarterbacks tomorrow in hopes
of confusing the Tribe defense.
This strategy worked very well
against Santa Barbara last

week, with Ackley sprinting 67
yards for one score and Berg
strom throwing a decisive touch
down pass later in the game.
Fullback Namanny, former
JC All-American from San Ma
teo, is "an outstanding runner,"
in Ralston's estimation. Camy, a
hard-driving 200-pounder, forms
the other half of Scovil's "bull
backfield."
Defensively, the Tigers have
improved with each week, shut
ting out three opponents in their
last five games. Defensive back
Rudy Redmond, a Senior Bowl
selection, lineman Jerry Heinz
and middle guard Tom Sur
bridge have been the mainstays
of the Pacific defense.
Medical Bulletin
Ralston, who expects "a real
battle" from "a big, strong,
physical" UOP team, may be
lucky to have enough men to
field an offense and defense. The
Indians have literally been the
walking wounded in recent
weeks.
Tight ends Bob Moore (pulled
hamstring, broken nose) and
Ron Kadziel (sprained shoul
der), halfback Bubba Brown
(hip pointer), safety Tom Mas
sey (bruised chest), quarterback
Jim Plunkett (bruised ribs,
strained back), linebacker Tim
McClure (sprained ankle),
tackle Dave Sharp (pinched
nerve) and Guard Don Hcffer
nan (bruised knee) have all
been sidelined within the past
two weeks.
Yesterday Ralston listed Mas
sey, Plunkett, Sharp and Mc-
Clure as "ready to go."
Plunkett has gotten legitimate
competition from sophomore
Don Bunce, who threw three TD
passes after taking over for the
injured Plunkett against Wash
ington. Ralston expects Bunce
to play quite a bit tomorrow.
"We'll try to exploit a one-two
punch," the coach commented,
possibly planning to give Scovil
a dose of his own medicine.
Tight End Troubles
"The tight ends and Brown
are still question marks," Ral
ston revealed, "but Moore is
getting stronger all the time."
Ralston indicated that Moore
will probably start, though Kad
ziel and Craig Lusiani should
see action.
The Tribe mentor also an
nounced that Howie Williams,
who gained 133 yards and scored
two touchdowns last Saturday,
will start again at halfback,
while Jack Schultz (who had
been switched to split end in
Mark Marquess's place) will
move back to the halfback spot,
where he will see action.
Marquess, having returned
from the International Baseball
Tournament in Mexico, has
moved right back into the start
ing split end berth which he
took over against UCLA.

Four Stanford records will be
in jeopardy tomorrow, all from
the Plunkett to Gene Washing
ton passing combination.
Plunkett, who has 1754 yards
passing this year, should break
Dick Norman's record of 1963
yards gained passing in one
season either tomorrow or next
week in Berkeley.
Washington, who eclipsed all
time Stanford receiving records
in single-season yardage and
touchdown receptions against
Washington, has a shot at three
more receiving records. He
needs only six catches and 62
yards to break Bill McColl's
records of 61 grabs in one sea
son, 112 career receptions, and
1648 yards gained. McColl's
mark of 14 career touchdowns
may be out of Washington's
reach. Gene has 10 six-pointers
in his Stanford career.

BACK OF THE GAMEâ€”Stanford halfback Howie Williams follows fullback Greg Broughton around
the right side and moves for a sizeable gain against Washington. Williams carried 22 times for 133
yards and scored two touchdowns in the finest performance of his career. With Bubba Brown stall
sidelined by a hip pointer, Coach Ralston is counting on Williams for the same type of effort tomor
row in Stockton.
