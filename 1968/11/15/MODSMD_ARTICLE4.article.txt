# Federal Aid Cut
## Deficit Anticipated 
### 
The Academic Senate yester
day authorized drawing on Uni
versity financial rcerws "to
maintain the present quality of
education at Stanford."
Their action, taken unanimous
ly by voice vote, followed a re
port from Kenneth M. Culhbert
son, vice president for financ\
indicating the University may
face a second year of deficit fi
nancing in 1969-70.
The presentation by Cuthbert
son precedes the formal presen
tation of budget guidelines to
the trustees 'ater this month.
Budget Goals Reviewed
Reviewing Stanford's broad
bi dget goals, Cuthbertson said
total expenditures, which have
increased at an average annual
rate of 12 per cent ovt the nast
five years, may grow at about
ha'f that rate in the next few
years.
Much of this growth has been
fueled by a sustained gain in
sponsored research, which now
totals about $46 million annual
ly.
The University, which had an
ticipated a $250,000 operating
surplus for 196cS-69, now faces a
$700,000 deficit, mainly because
of an unanticipated cut of $7
million in federally financed re
search.
Reserve funds built up over
the past decade to cover such a
contingency may be fully com

mitted in a few moro years.
Those rcorves came in part
from proe oris of the $113 mil
lion P A C E fundraising cam
paign. competed in 1963.
Stepped Up Kfl'opl
Cuthbertson indicated stepped
up efforts to secure private sup
port will he needed to keen Uni
versity ineom ' and exp -nditures
in halanc".
The relatively sharp rise in
research and training revenues
in recent years has been ac
companied by a growth in grad
uate student enrollment, he
noted, but "simi'ar enrollment
increases are not contemplated"
in the near future.
"The combination of 112 deral
cuts in sponsor d research and
the draft has a-Med substantial
rncertainties to the income pie
tun.'," he dec'ared.
Knowledge Nocevsary
Provost Richard W. Lyman
told the Senate that "if the fac
ulty are to have more influence
than in the past over the allo
cation of resources, it will be
essential for the faculty to be
come more knowledgeable about
this subject.
"This will mean more work for
you, as well as for us." He noted
that an operations review com
mittee, headed by Prof. Robert
Jaedicke of th • Graduate School
of Business is now seeking ways
in which economies may be

achieved "with little or no loss
of Stanford's effectiveness as
an educational institution."
Tuition Increases
Cuthbertson indicated that tui
'tion increases will be a major
source of new revenue for the
next two years, as Stanford
gradually closes the present $125
to $150 gap between its rates
and those of leading Eastern in
stitutions.
Three students on a budget
committee heard the presenta
tion. They included Thomas
Dawson, news editor of The
Stanford Daily, Student Legisla
iure Speaker Yale Braunstein,
and Michael No'an, a student in
the Graduate School of Business.
They were appointed earlier this
by Acting President Rob
ert J. Glaser on recommendation
of Student Body President Denis
Hayes.
