# White Plaza 'Voting'
## Nine Turn In Draft Cards 
### DAVID DAVENPORT 
As the broken army helmet
laid on the wet cement, preoared
to receive the cards, former
Stanford students Dave Harris
and Peter Ware invited young
men to come forward and cast
their "votes" yesterday noon on
White Plaza. The "ballots" were
Selective Service cards, and the
casting of the ballots was to be
"a vote for humanity."
First a woman approached the
mike, and ti rned in a registra
tion and a classification card
which she had taken from two
men. She burned them, "releas
ing the elements in the name of
humanity," at the rally spon
sored by The Resistance.
She was followed by eight
young men who offered their
cards to the broken helmet.
Resistance spokesman Dave
Harris then assumed the micro
phone. The original crowd of
200 steadily grew as he began to
describe the purpose of resisting
the draft.
Suits and Briefcases
Several men with suits and
briefcases stood together on the
fringe of the crowd. Many stu
dents straddled their bicycles
with books beneath their arms.

Others just sat on the cold con
crete. A few were eating sand
wiches. Harris, a former student
body president, had obviously
addressed such crowds before,
and everyone pressed in as he
opened the rally.
He told the crowd that it was
time to cast a vote for those peo
ple who had been exploited, bro
ken, and were unable to find
their voices. He encouraged the
audience to reject the institu
tions that step on other people.
Ix>ve For Humanity
Harris expressed a love for
all of humanity. In closing his
speech, he warned that "we'll
walk through anything that sep
arates us from those people. To
day we overtake the first road-
Dlock: military conscription."
The cold of the wind slapped at
the crowd, yet it continued to
grow to its peak of nearly 300.
Harris was fol'owed by Peter
Ware, a former student at Stan
ford's Graduate School of Busi
ness. Ware had joined 15 others
in burning their draft cards in
the Electoral Wake last Tuesday
night.
Ware cited three reasons for
burning his draft card. He
wanted to deny the legitimacy of

Selective Service channeling his
life into what it calls appropriate
areas of service. He felt a need
to reject the fear of Selective
Service. And he wanted to use
the political impact to inspire
others to act against the draft.
San Francisco Rally
The ceremony was closed with
an invitation for all to attend a
2:30 rally in San Francisco. Be
fore the crowd dispersed, the
hat was passed to cover rally
costs and bail money for those
arrested in the Electoral Wake.
The crowd was cold and wet. The
eight men claimed to be "more
honest, loving and humane."
In San Francisco, two persons
were arrested on federal charges
after a U.S. flag was burned
during a rain-soaked rally out
side the Federal Building.
FBI agents arrested John H.
Kangas, 25, who gave his address
as Michigan, and Morama Lou
ise Ferguson, 21, of New York,
on charges of desecration of the
U.S. flag, a new statute.
An estimated 150 to 250 per
sons were at the rally also spon
sored by The Resistance. About
100 alleged draft cards were re
ported turned in to federal of
ficials.

Resistance spokesman Dave
Harris then assumed the micro
phone. The original crowd of
200 steadily grew as he began to
describe the purpose of resisting
the draft.
Suits and Briefcases
Several men with suits and
briefcases stood together on the
fringe of the crowd. Many stu
dents straddled their bicycles
with books beneath their arms.

Others just sat on the cold con
crete. A few were eating sand
wiches. Harris, a former student
body president, had obviously
addressed such crowds before,
and everyone pressed in as he
opened the rally.
He told the crowd that it was
time to cast a vote for those peo
ple who had been exploited, bro
ken, and were unable to find
their voices. He encouraged the
audience to reject the institu
tions that step on other people.
Ix>ve For Humanity
Harris expressed a love for
all of humanity. In closing his
speech, he warned that "we'll
walk through anything that sep
arates us from those people. To
day we overtake the first road-
Dlock: military conscription."
The cold of the wind slapped at
the crowd, yet it continued to
grow to its peak of nearly 300.
Harris was fol'owed by Peter
Ware, a former student at Stan
ford's Graduate School of Busi
ness. Ware had joined 15 others
in burning their draft cards in
the Electoral Wake last Tuesday
night.
Ware cited three reasons for
burning his draft card. He
wanted to deny the legitimacy of

Selective Service channeling his
life into what it calls appropriate
areas of service. He felt a need
to reject the fear of Selective
Service. And he wanted to use
the political impact to inspire
others to act against the draft.
San Francisco Rally
The ceremony was closed with
an invitation for all to attend a
2:30 rally in San Francisco. Be
fore the crowd dispersed, the
hat was passed to cover rally
costs and bail money for those
arrested in the Electoral Wake.
The crowd was cold and wet. The
eight men claimed to be "more
honest, loving and humane."
In San Francisco, two persons
were arrested on federal charges
after a U.S. flag was burned
during a rain-soaked rally out
side the Federal Building.
FBI agents arrested John H.
Kangas, 25, who gave his address
as Michigan, and Morama Lou
ise Ferguson, 21, of New York,
on charges of desecration of the
U.S. flag, a new statute.
An estimated 150 to 250 per
sons were at the rally also spon
sored by The Resistance. About
100 alleged draft cards were re
ported turned in to federal of
ficials.
As the broken army helmet
laid on the wet cement, preoared
to receive the cards, former
Stanford students Dave Harris
and Peter Ware invited young
men to come forward and cast
their "votes" yesterday noon on
White Plaza. The "ballots" were
Selective Service cards, and the
casting of the ballots was to be
"a vote for humanity."
First a woman approached the
mike, and ti rned in a registra
tion and a classification card
which she had taken from two
men. She burned them, "releas
ing the elements in the name of
humanity," at the rally spon
sored by The Resistance.
She was followed by eight
young men who offered their
cards to the broken helmet.
