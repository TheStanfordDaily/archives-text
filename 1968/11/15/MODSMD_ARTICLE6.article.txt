# References Hard To Find For Seniors
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
For many seniors, perhaps more than half
(he class, applying to graduate school is an
odyssey in loneliness as they desperately
search the campus for professors to write
recommendations.
This fall, as in past years, seniors have
searched in vain for friends among the fac
ulty. Some end the odyssey in the .lean of
students office, facing the frustrating and de
pressing realization that they know no por
fessors and must seek recommendations from
strangers.
Others eventually got recommendations from
professors who are willing to write from only
the most limited contact with a student.
The words of one frustrated senior speak
for many. "I've been here for three years. It's
hard to figure I don't know anyone. I guess
I never really tried to talk with a professor,
but they never said anything to me aside from
giving lectures. I just got grades."
The phenomenon of the anonymous student
exists across the campus, cutting through de
partments. advising, and residences. A few
departments are beginning to expand ehnn

nels for student-faculty contact, but there are
lost students from all departments who find
the end of the line in the dean's office, the
counseling and testing center, or at the office
of a former, hardly-known professor,
r Anonymity Count
It is impossible to get an exact count of the
number of students plagued by anonymity.
Relatively few entirely fail to locate a pro
fessor willing to write recommendations, but
many such contacts are little better than go
ing to strangers in the dean's office for help.
A spot check of two dozen professors from
fifteen departments, indicates more than half
the senior class gets recommendations from
professors with whom they have had very
limited contact.
Every professor interviewed by The Daily
recounted many instances of seniors request
ing recommendations on the basis of taking
lecture courses as freshmen. The professors
admitted having great difficulty remembering
faces. It is quite impossible, they said, to re
member academic work.
Merrill Carlsmith, assistant professor of
psychology, notes that ten to fifteen seniors
come to him for recommendatins each year,
most reminding him they took Psychology 1 or
anther lecture course and wrote a paper that
received a good grade.
Out of 300
Says Carlsmith, "There are some seniors
who come in having done nothing but take
Psych 1 and expect me to remember them out
of a class of 300. The saddest cases, however,
are students who say 'You asked for a copy
of my term paper and I thought you would
remember me.' "
Carlsmith sadly commented, "The truth is
I .often don't remember names, and there are

a few I could swear I've never seen before in
my life."
Numerous seniors come to professors out
side their major department. The failure here
seems to be in departmental advising systems
and the emphasis on large lecture courses.
One student with an 'A' average in history
says he has yet to come in close contact with
a professor because of the "predominance 112
lecture courses and badly planned independent
reading programs in which pr nfr \ssors are
conspicuous by their absence."
Time Or Interest
A hitter student in communications claims,
"It is important for me to get into an exciting
graduate program. However, professors have
neither the time nor the interest to know me
well enough to recommend me individually—
for a specific course of study, much less to
assure a restrictive graduate school that I
have the enthusiasm or ability for it."
For the senior who can find no professor,
the clean of students oflice becomos his source
of recommendations. Four or five students
per week wander up to th n third floor of the
Old Union and ask the receptionist, "Is there
anyone here who can write me a recommenda
tion?"
These seniors are directed to Associate Dean
John Hanson who makes thirty minute ap
pointments to meet the student and then
writes the requested recommendations or
sends the student to what Hanson calls "a
svm pathetic professor.
Commenting on the cases he encounters,
Hanson says,"The great majority of students
coming up here simply want us to fill out a
clearance form for graduate school. For ex
ample, we now have a form letter prepared
to send to tin- U.C.L.A. medical school, one of

the favorites. But there are some students,
perhaps five a week, who come here totally
lost wanting personal recommendations writ
ten.
Level-Headed
"These are usually good students, very or
ganized about the application business, with
level headed aspirations for graduate school.
The only problem is they don't know any pro
fessor. Of course, the majority are transfer
students."
Hanson continued, "Sometimes, if a student
is looking for comments on his academic abil
ity, I will direct him to Jim Watkns n the
Political Science department. Prof. Watkins
never says no to a student."
"These cases," concluded Hanson, "are a
poor reflection on our basic advising system.
Someone should know these students better
than I can after a thirty-minute interview,
but plainly this is nt happening."
Hanson's criticism of the system is echoed
and expanded by others in the Stanford com
munity who feel the problem of getting rec
ommendations is just one example of a
broader malaise here —Stanford is just not a
very friendly place for faculty-student contact.
Revealing Symptom
Joseph Katz, executive director of the In
stitute for the Study of Human Problems and
an observer of the Stanford scene, believes,
"The difficulty seniors face in finding profes
sors they know is a very revealing symptom.
It shows something about the whole process
at Stanford. Studies I have made show there
is only very small contact between students
and faculty outside simply sitting in large
lectures.
"The campus, though it is better off in this
respect than Berkeley, needs more adults will

ing to encourage and lead students toward
friendships. Stanford should be more of an
interacting campus."
Katz quoted a 1965 study of Stanford and
Berkeley seniors in which the question was
asked, "To what would you attribute changes
in yourself during the college years?" The
study reported that only 15 per cent of the
men at Stanford selected "Much" on a scale
of "Little, moderate, much" under the head
ing "Close relations with teachers or other
adults." Sixteen per cent of the Stanford
women picked "Much." At Berkeley, the re
sults were 6 per cent of the men and 14 per
cent of the women.
In comparison, among Stanford students,
36 per cent of the men and 50 per cent of the
women attributed "Much" change in them
selves to "close relations with friends of the
same sex." Forty-one per cent of the men
and 66 per cent of the women thought "Much"
change had occured from close contact with
members of the opposite sex.
Difficult
Edwin Good, associate professor of religion
and Hebrew, chaired a Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) committee on advising and
counseling. Good discussed the problem of
senior recommendations recently. He said,
"Our committee was well aware of the prob
lem, but it is extremely difficult to get data
on the topic.
"I think there are probably two causes for
the problem. One is students don't take ad
vantage of the opportunities for meeting pro
fessors. For example, in Biology 4 and 5 the
professors have compalined that they wait
long hours to see students but no one bothers
to come."
The second cause, says Good,
"is the prevelance of large lec
ture courses at Stanford. There
are far too few seminars in
which students can show their
academic abilities to a pro
fessor."
The SES committee will rec
ommend the creation of a new
advising post at Stanford, "the
University Advisor." Good says
this post was created partially
in response to the recommenda
tions crisis.
The University Advisor will
be a nondepartmental advisor
for students, selected individ
ually by the student. Good hopes
this will bring together a fac
ulty member and student with
genuine interest in one another.
