## Mom Confronts A.S.S. 
### 
Dear Mom,
I am a member of the Anar
chist Socialist Society (A.S.S.),
and in true A.S.S. fashion we
were a bit late in making de
mands of the administration.
The climate seems to have
changed around Stanford. Here
is the reply we got:
Dc.ar Gentlemen:
We note your threat to take
what you call 'direct action' un
less your demands are immedi
ately met.
We feel it is only sporting to
let you know that our governing
body includes three experts in
chemical warfare, two ex-com
mandos skilled with dynamite

and in torturing prisoners, four
qualified marksmen in both
small-arms and rifles, two ex
artillerymen, one holder of the
Congressional .Medal, four ka
rate experts and a eliaplin. The
governing body has authorized
me to tell you that we look for
ward with confidence to what
you eall a "confrontation," and
I may say, even with anticipa
tion.
Your obedient servants, (etc.)
Dear Mom, my question is, do
you think the administration is
trying to tell us something?

Dear Mr. Proudhon,
I think your interesting letter
reflects the new "soft" attitude
of the administration toward ac
tivists. It also exemplifies a deep
patriotism on the part of the

admin. I was especially reas
sured that they are "looking for
ward" to a confrontation. This
bears out my firm belief that,
underneath, we're all just folks,
and that all our differences can
be ironed out by getting toge
ther for a nice homey chat. (I've
invited some S.R.I. people and
some S.D.S. folks over to toast
marshmallows this Friday.)
Your loving
MOM.
Dear Mom,
My room-mate is always "one
upping" everyone. For example,
she wears Chanel Number six
and drives a Mark V.

Dear Annoyed,
She is over-bearing about ma
terial things when she should be
"slimming herself for the eye
of the needle." You can one-up
her intellectually. Refer to T. S.
Eliot as "Thomas Stearns E."
And begin conversations with,
"As I was parsing Druid verbs
this afternoon . . ." (what a
druidful response, eh?)
Yer intellecshul fren,
MOM
