# Reality According to Palo Alto Times
## 
### 
Our country cousins across El Camino, the Palo Alto Times,
have always harbored a certain disdain for the Stanford commu
nity and its ideas. For this we cannot really blame the editors, for
both they and their suburban audience lack an academic perspec
tive. But the Times has allowed itself to be caught up in the
fears and uncertainties that are sweeping the rest of the country,
fanning emotions to irrational levels.
In three of four days this week, our Palo Alto family news
paper has editorialized: (a) that universities should ban the
Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and the Black Students
Union (BSU) from the college campus; (b) that academic com
munities should "purge" radicals, whom the newspaper termed
"political parasites," from among their faculties; and (c) that the
city and its citizens beware of the "hippie subculture" that may
try to "invade" the tranquility of the middle class community.
The Times demonstrates quite aptly in these three editorials
that it has completely closed its mind to the ideas, motivations,
stresses, and accomplishments of young people and their teach
ers. It seems that the Times will settle for nothing less than a
McCarthyite purge that would overshadow the accomplishments
of the 19505.
The violence and dangerous situations that breed at San Fran
cisco State, the Haight-Ashbury, and our own Lytton Plaza
pleases us no more than it does other citizens, including Alexan
der Bodi, Times' editor.

But the Times has demonstrated absolutely no understanding
of the pernicious student organizations and leftist professors
that they so angrily excoriate. The editors see no more motivation
behind the actions of BSU members at San Francisco State than
a desire for "terrorism" and "roughing up" professors. SDS mom
bers, they say, have no aims other than "taking our society apart
by Marxian agitational methods."
Danger to the entire educational system comes not from po
litical interference on the part of boards of trustees or regents,
but "from the radicals who have been allowed to infiltrate the
faculties and are using their positions to try to wreck the colleges
and the country itself, the 1 imes claims. And the "invasion" of
hippies into Palo Alto could have no other effect than to leave
behind them too many shattered youngsters and families."
This is all nonsense.
We warmly welcome the addition of the BSU, SDS, free think
ing profs, and hippie subculture into our midst. We would all do
well to listen more carefully to the threats of the young black
man, the vision of the corrupt society that the SDSer holds, the
new perspective and vibrant communication of the radical pro
fessor, and the refreshing life view of the hippie.
For all their idealism, weird notions, and occasionally arro
gant nature, these new forces cannot be merely suppressed. They
must be dealt with, approached, and understood. We might all
leain from them something about ourselves, our society, our en
tire way of life.
