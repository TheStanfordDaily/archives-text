# 'Alternatives To Violence Needed': Medical Symposium
## 
### DENNIS PERLUSS 
Violence as a factor for men
trying to adjust to stress in
fheir lives and the need for men
to find other means to adapt
to their environment were the
themes of Saturday's sympos
ium on violence, sponsored by
the Committee on Violence of
the Psychiatry Department of
the Medical School.
Doctors at the day-long sym
posium concluded that violence
emerges as one factor in the
struggle to resolve stress, either
planned and sanctioned as in
war, or impulsive and personal
as is often the case with homi
cide.
But the long-term survival val
ue of violent action is rapidly
deteriorating, it was decided. In
creasingly there is a need for
"adaptive alternatives to the
anachronism of violence."
Violence was described as
basically maladaptive, by Thom
as Bittker, resident in psychi
atry, in his paper "The Choice
of Violence for Resolution of
Conflict" although violence might
be functional for oppressed
groups. That such forms of vio
lence are being increasingly em
ployed was one of the reasons
for the Symposium on Violence.
Bittker outlined surveys con
ducted to determine the differ
ences between rioters and non
rioters in several black ghettos.
The blacks who riot are neither
poorer nor less educated nor
more recent arrivals to the
slums than non-rioters. Rather
they are those blacks who ex

press the most ambition and
who realize the disparity be
tween those aspirations and ob
jective reality.
These blacks, Bittker contin
ued, are unable to accept non
violent methods to gain what
they desire; for although these
may prove successful, they re
quire time and money—things
they do not have.
"Soul Power"
Frederick Ilfeld, another resi
dent in psychiatry, directed his
remarks to possible alternatives
to collective violence, despite the
positive aspects of violence for
oppressed groups.
• Collective violence is a pol
arizing factor that blocks inter
group communication.
• If successful the incidents
of collective violence could only
increase.
• Collective violence will not
work for groups who do not
have sufficient strength.
• Any such violence involves
tremendous waste.
Despite the difficulties of a
non-violent strategy, "soul
power" was termed an effective
alternative to violence because
rather than stimulating the ad
versary to fight back, it inhibits
and demoralizes him.
Other alternatives to violence
cited by Ilfeld were an over-rid
ing authority, consisting of a
true consensus on the rules and
structure of society; a new pos
itive identity for oppressed
groups that is respected and en
couraged by the establishment;
over-lapping group memberships

to reduce tension and increase
communication; and the recog
nition of super-ordinate goals,
those ends desired by all mem
bers of our society which can
only be gained by true inter
group co-operation.
A government more respons
ive to the needs of its people
and a more effective mechanism
for the expression of those
grievances were also called es
sential if a true alternative to
violence is to be found.
T.V. Teaches Violence
"Mass Media and Violence,"
the day's first paper, labeled
television as one of the prime
teachers of violence in Ameri
can society. Alberta Siegel, asso
ciate professor of psychology,
explained that modern learning
theory understands that rewards
or punishments are instru
mental only in the performance
of actions and not in their
acquisition. Observation is all
that is necessary to learn.
Since television portrays vio
lence as a good way to get the
job done, explained Psychology
Prof. Albert Bandura, the child
grows up considering violent
acts as an acceptable conflict
resolving mechanism. Thus be
sides teaching aggressive pat
terns, televison viewing pro
duces a reduction in inhibition
about acting in a violent man
ner.
The paper on the "Biological
Aspects of Violence" attempted
to shed light on the complex
relationship of the biological
and social factors of violence.

Despite the fact that animal
studies have allowed the isola
tion of sectors of the brain
which seem to control emotions
including aggression, R. Charles
Boelkins pointed out that before
information can reach those
area it must first pass through
the cerebral cortex. Consequent
ly any aggressive action is sub
ject to learned social behavior.

Psychiatric resident Robert
Taylor's presentation of "The
Phenomenon of Assassination"
dealt with the specialized area
of attempted and successful
Presidential assassinations.
From historical and psycholog
ical material a picture of the
assassins emerged. They were
typically young men, alienated

from their society and in deter
iorating socio-economic states,
who were troubled by persistent
delusions of both persecution
and grandeur.
Their jobs, Taylor states, were
made much easier by Presidents
who recklessly exposed them
selves—perhaps as a way of
denying that a real danger ex
isted.

Society which through the use
of capital punishment and war
implies that killing in certain
circumstances is a legitimate
means of dealing with great
social problems lends additional
support to the killers.
Taylor concluded that there
exists a need for stronger gun
laws, less exposure of the Presi
dent to large crowds at an
nounced times and places, and a
political system which allows
for greater expression of griev
ances so that those with irra
tional complaints will be able
to bo identified.
Crimes By The Mentally HI
"Mental Illness and Violence"
tried to examine the popular
conception that the mentally ill
are more likely to commit acts
of violence than "normal" peo
ple. Prof. George Gulivich com
piled several decades of studies
to come to the conclusion that no
conclusion was possible. People
discharged frm mental hospitals
are capable of committing any
act of violence but are not more
likely to do so than the general
population.
Prof. Thomas Gonda, associ
ate dean of the school of Medi

cine, concluded the formal part
of the program, attended by an
overflow crowd of nearly 250
(some of whom were forced to
watch on closed-circuit tele
vision).
Recognizing that our society,
through the Selective Service
Act, has "rounded up its youth
and taught them how to search
and destroy," he expressed a
hope for the future: "If such
violent forms of behavior can be
taught, then I say so can non
violent ones."

Violence as a factor for men
trying to adjust to stress in
fheir lives and the need for men
to find other means to adapt
to their environment were the
themes of Saturday's sympos
ium on violence, sponsored by
the Committee on Violence of
the Psychiatry Department of
the Medical School.
Doctors at the day-long sym
posium concluded that violence
emerges as one factor in the
struggle to resolve stress, either
planned and sanctioned as in
war, or impulsive and personal
as is often the case with homi
cide.
But the long-term survival val
ue of violent action is rapidly
deteriorating, it was decided. In
creasingly there is a need for
"adaptive alternatives to the
anachronism of violence."
Violence was described as
basically maladaptive, by Thom
as Bittker, resident in psychi
atry, in his paper "The Choice
of Violence for Resolution of
Conflict" although violence might
be functional for oppressed
groups. That such forms of vio
lence are being increasingly em
ployed was one of the reasons
for the Symposium on Violence.
Bittker outlined surveys con
ducted to determine the differ
ences between rioters and non
rioters in several black ghettos.
The blacks who riot are neither
poorer nor less educated nor
more recent arrivals to the
slums than non-rioters. Rather
they are those blacks who ex

press the most ambition and
who realize the disparity be
tween those aspirations and ob
jective reality.
These blacks, Bittker contin
ued, are unable to accept non
violent methods to gain what
they desire; for although these
may prove successful, they re
quire time and money—things
they do not have.
"Soul Power"
Frederick Ilfeld, another resi
dent in psychiatry, directed his
remarks to possible alternatives
to collective violence, despite the
positive aspects of violence for
oppressed groups.
• Collective violence is a pol
arizing factor that blocks inter
group communication.
• If successful the incidents
of collective violence could only
increase.
• Collective violence will not
work for groups who do not
have sufficient strength.
• Any such violence involves
tremendous waste.
Despite the difficulties of a
non-violent strategy, "soul
power" was termed an effective
alternative to violence because
rather than stimulating the ad
versary to fight back, it inhibits
and demoralizes him.
Other alternatives to violence
cited by Ilfeld were an over-rid
ing authority, consisting of a
true consensus on the rules and
structure of society; a new pos
itive identity for oppressed
groups that is respected and en
couraged by the establishment;
over-lapping group memberships

to reduce tension and increase
communication; and the recog
nition of super-ordinate goals,
those ends desired by all mem
bers of our society which can
only be gained by true inter
group co-operation.
A government more respons
ive to the needs of its people
and a more effective mechanism
for the expression of those
grievances were also called es
sential if a true alternative to
violence is to be found.
T.V. Teaches Violence
"Mass Media and Violence,"
the day's first paper, labeled
television as one of the prime
teachers of violence in Ameri
can society. Alberta Siegel, asso
ciate professor of psychology,
explained that modern learning
theory understands that rewards
or punishments are instru
mental only in the performance
of actions and not in their
acquisition. Observation is all
that is necessary to learn.
Since television portrays vio
lence as a good way to get the
job done, explained Psychology
Prof. Albert Bandura, the child
grows up considering violent
acts as an acceptable conflict
resolving mechanism. Thus be
sides teaching aggressive pat
terns, televison viewing pro
duces a reduction in inhibition
about acting in a violent man
ner.
The paper on the "Biological
Aspects of Violence" attempted
to shed light on the complex
relationship of the biological
and social factors of violence.

Despite the fact that animal
studies have allowed the isola
tion of sectors of the brain
which seem to control emotions
including aggression, R. Charles
Boelkins pointed out that before
information can reach those
area it must first pass through
the cerebral cortex. Consequent
ly any aggressive action is sub
ject to learned social behavior.

Psychiatric resident Robert
Taylor's presentation of "The
Phenomenon of Assassination"
dealt with the specialized area
of attempted and successful
Presidential assassinations.
From historical and psycholog
ical material a picture of the
assassins emerged. They were
typically young men, alienated

from their society and in deter
iorating socio-economic states,
who were troubled by persistent
delusions of both persecution
and grandeur.
Their jobs, Taylor states, were
made much easier by Presidents
who recklessly exposed them
selves—perhaps as a way of
denying that a real danger ex
isted.

Society which through the use
of capital punishment and war
implies that killing in certain
circumstances is a legitimate
means of dealing with great
social problems lends additional
support to the killers.
Taylor concluded that there
exists a need for stronger gun
laws, less exposure of the Presi
dent to large crowds at an
nounced times and places, and a
political system which allows
for greater expression of griev
ances so that those with irra
tional complaints will be able

Recognizing that our society,
through the Selective Service
Act, has "rounded up its youth
and taught them how to search
and destroy," he expressed a
hope for the future: "If such
violent forms of behavior can be
taught, then I say so can non
violent ones."
Violence as a factor for men
trying to adjust to stress in
fheir lives and the need for men
to find other means to adapt
to their environment were the
themes of Saturday's sympos
ium on violence, sponsored by
the Committee on Violence of
the Psychiatry Department of
the Medical School.
Doctors at the day-long sym
posium concluded that violence
emerges as one factor in the
struggle to resolve stress, either
planned and sanctioned as in
war, or impulsive and personal
as is often the case with homi
cide.
But the long-term survival val
ue of violent action is rapidly
deteriorating, it was decided. In
creasingly there is a need for
"adaptive alternatives to the
anachronism of violence."
Violence was described as
basically maladaptive, by Thom
as Bittker, resident in psychi
atry, in his paper "The Choice
of Violence for Resolution of
Conflict" although violence might
be functional for oppressed
groups. That such forms of vio
lence are being increasingly em
ployed was one of the reasons
for the Symposium on Violence.
Bittker outlined surveys con
ducted to determine the differ
ences between rioters and non
rioters in several black ghettos.
The blacks who riot are neither
poorer nor less educated nor
more recent arrivals to the
slums than non-rioters. Rather
they are those blacks who ex

press the most ambition and
who realize the disparity be
tween those aspirations and ob
jective reality.
These blacks, Bittker contin
ued, are unable to accept non
violent methods to gain what
they desire; for although these
may prove successful, they re
quire time and money—things
they do not have.
"Soul Power"
Frederick Ilfeld, another resi
dent in psychiatry, directed his
remarks to possible alternatives
to collective violence, despite the
positive aspects of violence for
oppressed groups.
• Collective violence is a pol
arizing factor that blocks inter
group communication.
• If successful the incidents
of collective violence could only
increase.
• Collective violence will not
work for groups who do not
have sufficient strength.
• Any such violence involves
tremendous waste.
Despite the difficulties of a
non-violent strategy, "soul
power" was termed an effective
alternative to violence because
rather than stimulating the ad
versary to fight back, it inhibits
and demoralizes him.
Other alternatives to violence
cited by Ilfeld were an over-rid
ing authority, consisting of a
true consensus on the rules and
structure of society; a new pos
itive identity for oppressed
groups that is respected and en
couraged by the establishment;
over-lapping group memberships

to reduce tension and increase
communication; and the recog
nition of super-ordinate goals,
those ends desired by all mem
bers of our society which can
only be gained by true inter
group co-operation.
A government more respons
ive to the needs of its people
and a more effective mechanism
for the expression of those
grievances were also called es
sential if a true alternative to
violence is to be found.
T.V. Teaches Violence
"Mass Media and Violence,"
the day's first paper, labeled
television as one of the prime
teachers of violence in Ameri
can society. Alberta Siegel, asso
ciate professor of psychology,
explained that modern learning
theory understands that rewards
or punishments are instru
mental only in the performance
of actions and not in their
acquisition. Observation is all
that is necessary to learn.
Since television portrays vio
lence as a good way to get the
job done, explained Psychology
Prof. Albert Bandura, the child
grows up considering violent
acts as an acceptable conflict
resolving mechanism. Thus be
sides teaching aggressive pat
terns, televison viewing pro
duces a reduction in inhibition
about acting in a violent man
ner.
The paper on the "Biological
Aspects of Violence" attempted
to shed light on the complex
relationship of the biological
and social factors of violence.

Despite the fact that animal
studies have allowed the isola
tion of sectors of the brain
which seem to control emotions
including aggression, R. Charles
Boelkins pointed out that before
information can reach those
area it must first pass through
the cerebral cortex. Consequent
ly any aggressive action is sub
ject to learned social behavior.

Psychiatric resident Robert
Taylor's presentation of "The
Phenomenon of Assassination"
dealt with the specialized area
of attempted and successful
Presidential assassinations.
From historical and psycholog
ical material a picture of the
assassins emerged. They were
typically young men, alienated

from their society and in deter
iorating socio-economic states,
who were troubled by persistent
delusions of both persecution
and grandeur.
Their jobs, Taylor states, were
made much easier by Presidents
who recklessly exposed them
selves—perhaps as a way of
denying that a real danger ex
isted.

Society which through the use
of capital punishment and war
implies that killing in certain
circumstances is a legitimate
means of dealing with great
social problems lends additional
support to the killers.
Taylor concluded that there
exists a need for stronger gun
laws, less exposure of the Presi
dent to large crowds at an
nounced times and places, and a
political system which allows
for greater expression of griev
ances so that those with irra
tional complaints will be able
to bo identified.
