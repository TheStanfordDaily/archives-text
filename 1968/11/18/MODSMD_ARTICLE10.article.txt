# Dumke's Actions Provoke SF State Crisis
## 
### 
We find ourselves in the unusual position of
agreeing with Ronald Reagan. Almost. The
Republican governor says San Francisco State
College should be reopened Tuesday. We
agree. The continued closing of the college is
against the best interests of both students and
faculty.
However, Reagan persists in attacking the
college administration, faculty and students
for the explosive situation at State. He does
not seem to realize that it was state college
Chancellor Glenn Dumke who provoked the
present crisis.
The statements of black English instructor
George Murray have received wide publicity
and, understandably, caused much apprehen
sion. Condoning the use of firearms on a college
campus, or anywhere, is indeed controversial.
In addition, Murray's teaching credentials have
come under some attack.
An arbitrary suspension is not the answer
to the charges against Murray. Lost in the
furor is the fact that a faculty committee began
investigating the charges against Murray before
Dumke acted. The standing committee is the
proper group to handle the Murray case, rather
than Dumke's preemptive move that challenges
the autonomy of the college.
Unfortunately, the committee has canceled
its investigation. The reason given is that "due
process" was not being observed. The addi
tion of new charges in the midst of the investi
gation is a violation of due process, according
to the committee chairman.

The San Francisco State Administration has
called the dropping of the investigation "ridicu
lous." We agree and urge the committee to re
open the investigation. The governance of the
college must not be left in the hands of Chan
cellor Dumke or state politics.

The issues of political intimidation and the
entrance onto campus of uninvited police forces
are far from dead. In addition to strongly
worded statements from both faculty and stu
dent constituencies, several administrators are
now working to make the university's position
in relation to surrounding communities clear.
A concerted effort on the Administration's part
is essential to guarantee that there be no fur
ther intrusions such as we have witnessed the
past two weeks.
As far as students are concerned, we must
show continued support for the victims of
recent events. Since last Friday's Lytton Plaza
gathering was cancelled due to weather condi
tions, our concern must be made clear to mis
guided authorities in some other manner.
We suggest that this morning's arraignment
of the six people arrested in connection with
the election protest in Pale Alto would be an
appropriate time to add the student presence
to the University's interest in maintaining its
rights. The time is 10 a.m., the place is the
North County Courthouse, the address is 270
Grant Ave., Palo Alto.

Unfortunately, the committee has canceled
its investigation. The reason given is that "due
process" was not being observed. The addi
tion of new charges in the midst of the investi
gation is a violation of due process, according
to the committee chairman.

The San Francisco State Administration has
called the dropping of the investigation "ridicu
lous." We agree and urge the committee to re
open the investigation. The governance of the
college must not be left in the hands of Chan
cellor Dumke or state politics.

The issues of political intimidation and the
entrance onto campus of uninvited police forces
are far from dead. In addition to strongly
worded statements from both faculty and stu
dent constituencies, several administrators are
now working to make the university's position
in relation to surrounding communities clear.
A concerted effort on the Administration's part
is essential to guarantee that there be no fur
ther intrusions such as we have witnessed the
past two weeks.
As far as students are concerned, we must
show continued support for the victims of
recent events. Since last Friday's Lytton Plaza
gathering was cancelled due to weather condi
tions, our concern must be made clear to mis
guided authorities in some other manner.
We suggest that this morning's arraignment
of the six people arrested in connection with
the election protest in Pale Alto would be an
appropriate time to add the student presence
to the University's interest in maintaining its
rights. The time is 10 a.m., the place is the
North County Courthouse, the address is 270
Grant Ave., Palo Alto.
We find ourselves in the unusual position of
agreeing with Ronald Reagan. Almost. The
Republican governor says San Francisco State
College should be reopened Tuesday. We
agree. The continued closing of the college is
against the best interests of both students and
faculty.
However, Reagan persists in attacking the
college administration, faculty and students
for the explosive situation at State. He does
not seem to realize that it was state college
Chancellor Glenn Dumke who provoked the
present crisis.
The statements of black English instructor
George Murray have received wide publicity
and, understandably, caused much apprehen
sion. Condoning the use of firearms on a college
campus, or anywhere, is indeed controversial.
In addition, Murray's teaching credentials have
come under some attack.
An arbitrary suspension is not the answer
to the charges against Murray. Lost in the
furor is the fact that a faculty committee began
investigating the charges against Murray before
Dumke acted. The standing committee is the
proper group to handle the Murray case, rather
than Dumke's preemptive move that challenges
the autonomy of the college.
