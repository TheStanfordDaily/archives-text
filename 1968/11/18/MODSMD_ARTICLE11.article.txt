• Stability in Greece
Editor, THE DAILY:
Last week George Papandre
ou, a prominent precoup Greek
politician, died in Athens. The
Athenians upon hearing the
news took to the streets and,
in an act of open defiance to the
military government, demanded
that an election day be set. De
mocracy may be dead in Greece
but this incident showed that it
is very much alive in the Greek
mind. As if reacting to the same
news, Vice President-elect Spiro
Agnew repeated his endorsement
of the government in such terms
as to make it clear that the jun
ta will enjoy the full support
of the Nixon administration.
Why Mr. Nixon? Why Mr. Ag
new? No great political astute
ness is necessary for one to rea

lize that the American govern
ment is again in a position
where it is backing a foreign
government which does not have
the support of its people. It hap
pened in Vietnam, in Cuba, in
the Dominican Republic; this is
exactly what is happening in
Greece now.
It is clear to everybody that
the military regime and all that
it stands for runs contrary to all
basic philosophical, ethical and
political beliefs of the United
States. Putting philosopnical and
moral arguments aside, is the
support of the junta even an act
of political common sense?
It has been said that under the
military regime Greece will be
able to effectively fulfill its role
as the southeastern flank of
NATO. It should be noted that
the junta avoided a Greco-Turk
war last year for, among other
reasons, it was not sure of the
loyalty of the troops. NATO's
benefit from an ally who cannot
rely on the loyalty of its army
is disputable, to say the least.
It has been said that the jun
ta stopped Greece from going
communist. Funny! The Com
munist party which mustered a
mere 12 per cent in the last elec
tions became such a threat over
night?
It has been said that the jun
ta brought stability to the coun
try. Undoubtedly it has; the kind
of stability that followed the
Diem regime, the Batista regime,
the Trujillo regime, ad infinitum
. . . A dubious stability. A dubi
ous political common sense may
I add?

Editor, THE DAILY:
The student firemen at Stan
ford sincerely appreciate the
coverage given us in Tuesday's
Dally. We are very happy to
have the University community
know more about us and the
jobs that we perform. We feel
both pride and responsibility
with these jobs that we hold.
We thought that the Univer
sity community would be inter
ested in the details of the 120
hour program that each student
fireman must go through in his
first three weeks in the depart
ment. Typical simple routines
that are learned include the
climbing of an 1 bit" rope sus
pended from the aerial ladder
fully extended (85' high) using

one hand only while carrying a
50 lb. extension ladder with the
other hand. Those beginning
student firemen who are unable
to do this within 20 seconds at
the end of the three weeks are
summarily dropped from the de
partment.
On the training tower we are
taught how to scale a solid con
crete wall using only spikes and
pitons. With this training, stu
dent fireman were able to pre
vent the mass suicide of 15 so
cially frustrated Stanford dol
lies on the Hoover Tower (which
cannot be reached by the aerial
ladder) in a truly spectacular
rescue last year.
In the three weeks we also
try to develop a minimal stan
dard of physical conditioning; a
long jump of 30 ft., a high jump
of 8 ft., a pole vault of 18 ft.,
and other necessary physical
abilities.
While you mentioned our ex
cellent salary of $100 a month,
you neglected to state the fact
that while we were originally of
fered $200 a month, we magnam
inously decided to accept a cut
so that Stanford TA's could bet
ter support their nine kids
apiece with additional pay from
the University. However, there
is no doubt that we are still
more valuable to the University
community.
Again, thank you for your
good coverage of the student
firemen. The Daily's consistently
accurate reporting have made it
one of the truly great college
dailies.

• Finish With A Fizzle
Editor, The Dally:
In opposition to Mr. Cavalli's
article in the Daily of Novembei
6, 1968 it is puzzling to me that
a school which will not accept
status quo of any sort is tolerant
of a football coach whose season
ending record and season prog
ress can be predicted every year
before the season begins.
Maybe the answer is in de
emphasis of football and if this
is the case, I wonder if the play
ers are aware of this before they
sign their tenders. Or maybe that
guiding force, apathy, is the
reason for the general content.
Anyway, from the writing on
the wall, we all know next sea
son our team will start off with
a bang and finish with a fizzle.

politician, died in Athens. The
Athenians upon hearing the
news took to the streets and,
in an act of open defiance to the
military government, demanded
that an election day be set. De
mocracy may be dead in Greece
but this incident showed that it
is very much alive in the Greek
mind. As if reacting to the same
news, Vice President-elect Spiro
Agnew repeated his endorsement
of the government in such terms
as to make it clear that the jun
ta will enjoy the full support
of the Nixon administration.
Why Mr. Nixon? Why Mr. Ag
new? No great political astute
ness is necessary for one to rea

lize that the American govern
ment is again in a position
where it is backing a foreign
government which does not have
the support of its people. It hap
pened in Vietnam, in Cuba, in
the Dominican Republic; this is
exactly what is happening in
Greece now.
It is clear to everybody that
the military regime and all that
it stands for runs contrary to all
basic philosophical, ethical and
political beliefs of the United
States. Putting philosopnical and
moral arguments aside, is the
support of the junta even an act
of political common sense?
It has been said that under the
military regime Greece will be
able to effectively fulfill its role
as the southeastern flank of
NATO. It should be noted that
the junta avoided a Greco-Turk
war last year for, among other
reasons, it was not sure of the
loyalty of the troops. NATO's
benefit from an ally who cannot
rely on the loyalty of its army
is disputable, to say the least.
It has been said that the jun
ta stopped Greece from going
communist. Funny! The Com
munist party which mustered a
mere 12 per cent in the last elec
tions became such a threat over
night?
It has been said that the jun
ta brought stability to the coun
try. Undoubtedly it has; the kind
of stability that followed the
Diem regime, the Batista regime,
the Trujillo regime, ad infinitum
. . . A dubious stability. A dubi
ous political common sense may
I add?

Editor, THE DAILY:
The student firemen at Stan
ford sincerely appreciate the
coverage given us in Tuesday's
Dally. We are very happy to
have the University community
know more about us and the
jobs that we perform. We feel
both pride and responsibility
with these jobs that we hold.
We thought that the Univer
sity community would be inter
ested in the details of the 120
hour program that each student
fireman must go through in his
first three weeks in the depart
ment. Typical simple routines
that are learned include the
climbing of an 1 bit" rope sus
pended from the aerial ladder
fully extended (85' high) using

one hand only while carrying a
50 lb. extension ladder with the
other hand. Those beginning
student firemen who are unable
to do this within 20 seconds at
the end of the three weeks are
summarily dropped from the de
partment.
On the training tower we are
taught how to scale a solid con
crete wall using only spikes and
pitons. With this training, stu
dent fireman were able to pre
vent the mass suicide of 15 so
cially frustrated Stanford dol
lies on the Hoover Tower (which
cannot be reached by the aerial
ladder) in a truly spectacular
rescue last year.
In the three weeks we also
try to develop a minimal stan
dard of physical conditioning; a
long jump of 30 ft., a high jump
of 8 ft., a pole vault of 18 ft.,
and other necessary physical
abilities.
While you mentioned our ex
cellent salary of $100 a month,
you neglected to state the fact
that while we were originally of
fered $200 a month, we magnam
inously decided to accept a cut
so that Stanford TA's could bet
ter support their nine kids
apiece with additional pay from
the University. However, there
is no doubt that we are still
more valuable to the University
community.
Again, thank you for your
good coverage of the student
firemen. The Daily's consistently
accurate reporting have made it
one of the truly great college
dailies.

In opposition to Mr. Cavalli's
article in the Daily of Novembei

a school which will not accept

of a football coach whose season

Maybe the answer is in de

in an act of open defiance to the
military government, demanded
that an election day be set. De
mocracy may be dead in Greece
but this incident showed that it
is very much alive in the Greek
mind. As if reacting to the same
news, Vice President-elect Spiro
Agnew repeated his endorsement
of the government in such terms
as to make it clear that the jun
ta will enjoy the full support
of the Nixon administration.
Why Mr. Nixon? Why Mr. Ag
new? No great political astute
ness is necessary for one to rea

lize that the American govern
ment is again in a position
where it is backing a foreign
government which does not have
the support of its people. It hap
pened in Vietnam, in Cuba, in
the Dominican Republic; this is
exactly what is happening in
Greece now.
It is clear to everybody that
the military regime and all that
it stands for runs contrary to all
basic philosophical, ethical and
political beliefs of the United
States. Putting philosopnical and
moral arguments aside, is the
support of the junta even an act
of political common sense?
It has been said that under the
military regime Greece will be
able to effectively fulfill its role
as the southeastern flank of
NATO. It should be noted that
the junta avoided a Greco-Turk
war last year for, among other
reasons, it was not sure of the
loyalty of the troops. NATO's
benefit from an ally who cannot
rely on the loyalty of its army
is disputable, to say the least.
It has been said that the jun
ta stopped Greece from going
communist. Funny! The Com
munist party which mustered a
mere 12 per cent in the last elec
tions became such a threat over
night?
It has been said that the jun
ta brought stability to the coun
try. Undoubtedly it has; the kind
of stability that followed the
Diem regime, the Batista regime,
the Trujillo regime, ad infinitum
. . . A dubious stability. A dubi
ous political common sense may
I add?

• Student Firemen
Editor, THE DAILY:
The student firemen at Stan
ford sincerely appreciate the
coverage given us in Tuesday's
Dally. We are very happy to
have the University community
know more about us and the
jobs that we perform. We feel
both pride and responsibility
with these jobs that we hold.
We thought that the Univer
sity community would be inter
ested in the details of the 120
hour program that each student
fireman must go through in his
first three weeks in the depart
ment. Typical simple routines
that are learned include the
climbing of an 1 bit" rope sus
pended from the aerial ladder
fully extended (85' high) using

one hand only while carrying a
50 lb. extension ladder with the
other hand. Those beginning
student firemen who are unable
to do this within 20 seconds at
the end of the three weeks are
summarily dropped from the de
partment.
On the training tower we are
taught how to scale a solid con
crete wall using only spikes and
pitons. With this training, stu
dent fireman were able to pre
vent the mass suicide of 15 so
cially frustrated Stanford dol
lies on the Hoover Tower (which
cannot be reached by the aerial
ladder) in a truly spectacular
rescue last year.
In the three weeks we also
try to develop a minimal stan
dard of physical conditioning; a
long jump of 30 ft., a high jump
of 8 ft., a pole vault of 18 ft.,
and other necessary physical
abilities.
While you mentioned our ex
cellent salary of $100 a month,
you neglected to state the fact
that while we were originally of
fered $200 a month, we magnam
inously decided to accept a cut
so that Stanford TA's could bet
ter support their nine kids
apiece with additional pay from
the University. However, there
is no doubt that we are still
more valuable to the University
community.
Again, thank you for your
good coverage of the student
firemen. The Daily's consistently
accurate reporting have made it
one of the truly great college
dailies.

• Finish With A Fizzle
Editor, The Dally:
In opposition to Mr. Cavalli's
article in the Daily of Novembei
6, 1968 it is puzzling to me that
a school which will not accept
status quo of any sort is tolerant
of a football coach whose season
ending record and season prog
ress can be predicted every year
before the season begins.
Maybe the answer is in de
emphasis of football and if this
is the case, I wonder if the play
ers are aware of this before they
sign their tenders. Or maybe that
guiding force, apathy, is the
reason for the general content.
Anyway, from the writing on
the wall, we all know next sea
son our team will start off with
a bang and finish with a fizzle.
