You mothers are now stuck
with a LASSU which you will
soon come to hate with your usu
al intensity, a LASSU you care
about so much that you won't
even fill its vacant positions.
Every interested grad in human
ities and sciences, and every in
terested undergraduate who lives
off-campus, (who got 15 signa
tures on a petition) is now on
the legislature — without even
standing for election — because
there were more spaces avail
able than there are students will
ing to fill them.
And who can blame the rest
for their apathy? Who the hell
wants to spend every other
Thursday evening cooped up
with a bunch of raging imbe
ciles?
Some of us have been trying
to win a position of respecta
bility for students in this place,

a position of power. And things
are opening up a little.
I was told last year that stu
dents would never sit in judg
ment on faculty members — but
they do, on the new Judicial
Council. I was told last year that
students would never be mem
bers of the Research Committee,
but two days ago the faculty de
cided to include us as full voting
members. I was told last year
that I would hit nothing but
brick walls with the administra
tion this fall, but I've found Dr.
Glaser to be responsive to every
student concern, from low-cost
housing and the food service to
S.R.I, and R.O.T.C.
But how do I argue for an in
crease in student power when
you insist on saddling yourselves
with a L.A.S.S.U. split down the
middle between anarchists and
fascists, yet having "final legis
lative authority" for the Asso
ciation?
How do I argue for an increase
in student responsibility when
you refuse to accept an oppor
tunity to control your own ASSU
office, to set your own fees, to
hire and fire your own employ
ees?

We're working like hell, and
we're making progress. Some
significant changes are going to
be coming to Stanford, and stu
dents will be in the vanguard.
But change will be slow until
you cut this albatross of a
LASSU off your collective neck.
I'm reminded of a statement
by George Lichtenberg:
"I do not know whether, If
things change, they will get bet
ter. But what I do know is this:
if things are to get better, then
they must change."
Last spring I went on record
as favoring a number of changes
in the structural make-up of the
ASSU. These proposed changes
were not revolutionary, but they
were workable and they would
have served to increase the le
gitimacy of the organization in
the eyes of the students, and
therefore in the eyes of the
other constituencies.
Because I'd publicly endorsed
the proposed improvements, I
felt an obligation to try to see
them realized. Toward that end
I analyzed several constitutions
from other universities, sought
out student opinion in clubs, res
idences, and elsewhere at Stan

ford, and had lengthy discus
sions with representatives of all
our graduate student associa
tions. Gradually we accumulated
a group of students interested in
serious reform.
We formulated a series of con
stitutions and submitted them to
searching scrutiny by the Gov
ernment committes of the
S.E.S. and the A.A.U.P. We dis
cussed the legal questions in
volved with five different attor
neys, and we explored the ramifi
cations of various approaches at
great depth with damned near
everyone of any significance in
this institution.
We submitted a new constitu
tion to a student vote last spring.
It passed, but was ruled out-of
order because The Daily had not
published it twice.
We submitted a greatly
improved version of that same
constitution to a student vote
three weeks ago. It received
65% of the vote, but it failed to
garner the necessary two-thirds.
We took the two most signifi
cant sections from the defeated
constitution, revised them slight
ly, won unanimous support for
them from the C.S.R. which had

approved them in the previous
election, and placed them up for
another vote.
And, at great expense, The
Daily printed the damned things
again. Twice. It even came out
and editorially endorsed them.
Which may have been the kiss
of death.
Foiled Aguin -
In any case, they were de
feated. This time they won only
607 c of the vote.
So I'm through with constitu
tions.
To the students who care, I'm
sorry. To the scores who gave
generously of their time, energy
and ideas over the past six
months, I can only say thanks.
And to those who will wage the
inevitab'e future constitutional
battles, I wish good luck.
But I've invested well over 300
hours of my time in this bloody
thing, I've offered the student
body three chances to adopt
some significant improvements,
the whole bag has been thrice
rejected without a single cogent
reason having been advanced for
the rejection, and I consider my
obligations in this regard to be
over.

65% of the vote, but it failed to
garner the necessary two-thirds.
We took the two most signifi
cant sections from the defeated
constitution, revised them slight
ly, won unanimous support for
them from the C.S.R. which had

approved them in the previous
election, and placed them up for
another vote.
And, at great expense, The
Daily printed the damned things
again. Twice. It even came out
and editorially endorsed them.
Which may have been the kiss
of death.
Foiled Aguin -
In any case, they were de
feated. This time they won only
607 c of the vote.
So I'm through with constitu
tions.
To the students who care, I'm
sorry. To the scores who gave
generously of their time, energy
and ideas over the past six
months, I can only say thanks.
And to those who will wage the
inevitab'e future constitutional
battles, I wish good luck.
But I've invested well over 300
hours of my time in this bloody
thing, I've offered the student
body three chances to adopt
some significant improvements,
the whole bag has been thrice
rejected without a single cogent
reason having been advanced for
the rejection, and I consider my
obligations in this regard to be
over.

You mothers are now stuck
with a LASSU which you will
soon come to hate with your usu
al intensity, a LASSU you care
about so much that you won't
even fill its vacant positions.
Every interested grad in human
ities and sciences, and every in
terested undergraduate who lives
off-campus, (who got 15 signa
tures on a petition) is now on
the legislature — without even
standing for election — because
there were more spaces avail
able than there are students will
ing to fill them.
And who can blame the rest
for their apathy? Who the hell
wants to spend every other
Thursday evening cooped up
with a bunch of raging imbe
ciles?
Some of us have been trying
to win a position of respecta
bility for students in this place,

a position of power. And things
are opening up a little.
I was told last year that stu
dents would never sit in judg
ment on faculty members — but
they do, on the new Judicial
Council. I was told last year that
students would never be mem
bers of the Research Committee,
but two days ago the faculty de
cided to include us as full voting
members. I was told last year
that I would hit nothing but
brick walls with the administra
tion this fall, but I've found Dr.
Glaser to be responsive to every
student concern, from low-cost
housing and the food service to
S.R.I, and R.O.T.C.
But how do I argue for an in
crease in student power when
you insist on saddling yourselves
with a L.A.S.S.U. split down the
middle between anarchists and
fascists, yet having "final legis
lative authority" for the Asso
ciation?
How do I argue for an increase
in student responsibility when
you refuse to accept an oppor
tunity to control your own ASSU
office, to set your own fees, to
hire and fire your own employ
ees?

We're working like hell, and
we're making progress. Some
significant changes are going to
be coming to Stanford, and stu
dents will be in the vanguard.
But change will be slow until
you cut this albatross of a
LASSU off your collective neck.
I'm reminded of a statement
by George Lichtenberg:
"I do not know whether, If
things change, they will get bet
ter. But what I do know is this:
if things are to get better, then
they must change."
Last spring I went on record
as favoring a number of changes
in the structural make-up of the
ASSU. These proposed changes
were not revolutionary, but they
were workable and they would
have served to increase the le
gitimacy of the organization in
the eyes of the students, and
therefore in the eyes of the
other constituencies.
Because I'd publicly endorsed
the proposed improvements, I
felt an obligation to try to see
them realized. Toward that end
I analyzed several constitutions
from other universities, sought
out student opinion in clubs, res
idences, and elsewhere at Stan

ford, and had lengthy discus
sions with representatives of all
our graduate student associa
tions. Gradually we accumulated
a group of students interested in
serious reform.
We formulated a series of con
stitutions and submitted them to
searching scrutiny by the Gov
ernment committes of the
S.E.S. and the A.A.U.P. We dis
cussed the legal questions in
volved with five different attor
neys, and we explored the ramifi
cations of various approaches at
great depth with damned near
everyone of any significance in
this institution.
We submitted a new constitu
tion to a student vote last spring.
It passed, but was ruled out-of
order because The Daily had not
published it twice.
We submitted a greatly
improved version of that same
constitution to a student vote
three weeks ago. It received
65% of the vote, but it failed to
garner the necessary two-thirds.

have served to increase the le
gitimacy of the organization in
the eyes of the students, and
therefore in the eyes of the
other constituencies.
Because I'd publicly endorsed
the proposed improvements, I
felt an obligation to try to see
them realized. Toward that end
I analyzed several constitutions
from other universities, sought
out student opinion in clubs, res
idences, and elsewhere at Stan

ford, and had lengthy discus
sions with representatives of all
our graduate student associa
tions. Gradually we accumulated
a group of students interested in
serious reform.
We formulated a series of con
stitutions and submitted them to
searching scrutiny by the Gov
ernment committes of the
S.E.S. and the A.A.U.P. We dis
cussed the legal questions in
volved with five different attor
neys, and we explored the ramifi
cations of various approaches at
great depth with damned near
everyone of any significance in
this institution.
We submitted a new constitu
tion to a student vote last spring.
It passed, but was ruled out-of
order because The Daily had not
published it twice.
We submitted a greatly
improved version of that same
constitution to a student vote
three weeks ago. It received
65% of the vote, but it failed to
garner the necessary two-thirds.
We took the two most signifi
cant sections from the defeated
constitution, revised them slight
ly, won unanimous support for
them from the C.S.R. which had

approved them in the previous
election, and placed them up for
another vote.
And, at great expense, The
Daily printed the damned things
again. Twice. It even came out
and editorially endorsed them.
Which may have been the kiss
of death.
Foiled Aguin -
In any case, they were de
feated. This time they won only
607 c of the vote.
So I'm through with constitu
tions.
To the students who care, I'm
sorry. To the scores who gave
generously of their time, energy
and ideas over the past six
months, I can only say thanks.
And to those who will wage the
inevitab'e future constitutional
battles, I wish good luck.
But I've invested well over 300
hours of my time in this bloody
thing, I've offered the student
body three chances to adopt
some significant improvements,
the whole bag has been thrice
rejected without a single cogent
reason having been advanced for
the rejection, and I consider my
obligations in this regard to be
over.

You mothers are now stuck
with a LASSU which you will
soon come to hate with your usu
al intensity, a LASSU you care
about so much that you won't
even fill its vacant positions.
Every interested grad in human
ities and sciences, and every in
terested undergraduate who lives
off-campus, (who got 15 signa
tures on a petition) is now on
the legislature — without even
standing for election — because
there were more spaces avail
able than there are students will
ing to fill them.
And who can blame the rest
for their apathy? Who the hell
wants to spend every other
Thursday evening cooped up
with a bunch of raging imbe
ciles?
Some of us have been trying
to win a position of respecta
bility for students in this place,

a position of power. And things
are opening up a little.
I was told last year that stu
dents would never sit in judg
ment on faculty members — but
they do, on the new Judicial
Council. I was told last year that
students would never be mem
bers of the Research Committee,
but two days ago the faculty de
cided to include us as full voting
members. I was told last year
that I would hit nothing but
brick walls with the administra
tion this fall, but I've found Dr.
Glaser to be responsive to every
student concern, from low-cost
housing and the food service to
S.R.I, and R.O.T.C.
But how do I argue for an in
crease in student power when
you insist on saddling yourselves
with a L.A.S.S.U. split down the
middle between anarchists and
fascists, yet having "final legis
lative authority" for the Asso
ciation?
How do I argue for an increase
in student responsibility when
you refuse to accept an oppor
tunity to control your own ASSU
office, to set your own fees, to
hire and fire your own employ
ees?

We're working like hell, and
we're making progress. Some
significant changes are going to
be coming to Stanford, and stu
dents will be in the vanguard.
But change will be slow until
you cut this albatross of a
LASSU off your collective neck.
I'm reminded of a statement
by George Lichtenberg:
"I do not know whether, If
things change, they will get bet
ter. But what I do know is this:
if things are to get better, then
they must change."
Last spring I went on record
as favoring a number of changes
in the structural make-up of the
ASSU. These proposed changes
were not revolutionary, but they
were workable and they would
have served to increase the le
gitimacy of the organization in
the eyes of the students, and
therefore in the eyes of the
other constituencies.
