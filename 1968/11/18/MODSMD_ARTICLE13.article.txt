# OPINION: Unless we redistribute power right here in the university, we can't control our own lives

"But a new politics—a politics
of the street — was replacing
the old politics — the politics
of the assembly hall."
— Jesse Lemich, from "The
American Revolution from the
Bottom Up."
"money doesn't talk, it swears
. . . ." — Dylan

Campus reactions to what the
police did at the battle of Lytton
Plaza oscillated between indigna
tion and uneasy acceptance. Con
stitutional rights and proper po
lice procedure were violated, but
brutality and free assembly and
speech weren't the gut issues.
The arrests at Lytton Plaza and
those that followed were about
economic and political power. Is
sues of free speech and police
actions are manifestations of an
unequal distribution of power.
Before the crowd was "dis
persed," some people who have
talked and organized about the
distribution of power were asked
to leave by Chief Hydie. It seems
as if it was more illegal for
Bruce Franklin, Mark Sapir, and
myself to be on Lytton Plaza
than for other people. The po
lice managed to arrest me that
night but had to wait three days
to get warrants for Bruce and
Mark and a week to grab Jim
Johnson in front of Tresidder.
Unless these people didn't dis
perse as well as two or three
hundred others, their arrests
were clear cases of attempted
political intimidation.
The question is why individ
uals are being singled out; how
Chief Hydie has the power to do
this. The central problem is that
of the distribution of power, not
the high-handedness of a po
lice chief. Chief Hydie didn't risk
his job attempting to intimidate
the demonstrators.
The men who own and control
Palo Alto know that the activ
ists' interests are not compatible
with their own. To bring it
home, many of the same hands
that control Palo Alto control
Stanford.
Political Intimidation
Political intimidation is not

new here, but on Tuesday night
last week, police were used for
the first time. Once there was an
economist at Stanford named
Paul Baran. He was a Socialist.
Paul Baran's salary was frozen
because the politics he advocated
would have crumbled the foun
dations of David Packard's love
ly penthouse. Now that Baran is
surely dead, there is a Paul Ba
ran chair in the Economics De
partment. There is talk that
Bruce Franklin's salary might
be frozen.
Last year seven students felt
tho keen edge of Stanford's
"non-political" axe. They were
suspended for a demonstration
against the CIA. Tho students
know they were sitting at the
bottom of the power see-saw at
Stanford, which has some fine
smiling corporation directors
perched on top. I gi ess the cor
porate liberals look at the CIA
from a different perspective than
we do.
Anyway, you never can tell
when the CIA might have to pro
tect trustee Arthur Stewart's oil
investments in Thailand. Provid
ing, of course, that ClA's Air
America, the Agency's National
ist Chinese cadres in North Thai
land, the Thai police, and Sea
Trades Company in Bangkok can
take time off from the opium
derivative business.
New Crises
We activated our political pow
er last year at the Old Union and
we won. But in spite of the sit-in,

the ultimate distribution of pow
er at Stanford stayed the same,
and new crises seem imminent.
The interests of the trustees
don't end in the industrial park
or the mines of Peru. They are
in Palo Alto. While high school
kids and Free U. people might
think that the streets are for
all the people, some men have
other ideas.
A plan to turn downtown Palo
Alto into a financial center so
local wealth can gain indepen
dence from Montgomery Street
has been put forward by a group
of local businessmen who are
well represented on the Farm.
Stock brokers aren't happy in
an atmosphere of liberation fes
tivals and anti-war protests.
Concentration of Power
Last Spring's sit-in and Tues
day's action were both caused by
the concentration of power in a
few hands. The fear of those at
the top of the see-saw is that
Blacks and college kids are going
to knock down their palaces.
And they're right on.
As long as this university is
controlled by men who aren't
educators and whose ideology re
flects their business interests,
conflict can be expected. The
S.D.S. demands about Southeast
Asia are clearly in contradiction
to the interests of the trustees,
and it's very long odds that Er
nest Arbuckle will resign as a
trustee or give up his business
posts. We can play rational dia
logue all year long, but it won't

stop the money and blood from
flowing into Thailand.
So S.D.S. will talk about pow
er, and do something about it,
because the allocation of power
is as much a factor at Stanford
as in the Third World.
Channeling
While S.R.I, reaps Defense De
partment money, some gradu
ates are going to get induction
notices to frame with their di
plomas. But if you don't take an
N.L.F. bullet defending the "na
tional interest," your troubles
have just started. Social and
hard scientists will find that re
search grants usually flow from
loaded pockets, and right now
the money is for defense. It
doesn't look like that will change.
A science major may find
himself faced with the option of
teaching in high school and not
doing anything approaching re
search, or working for the mis
sile business. This form of chan
neling blurs into intimidation
within the corporate structure,
as many liberal students may
sadly find out.
The following paragraph was

in The Wall Street Journal of
November 12, 1968.
.... Political activity on be
half of Democrats hampers
an executive's career say 31%
of 2,500 managers surveyed
by Harvard Business Review;
only 9% thought such activity
aided their chance of getting
ahead. But 34% believe poli
ticking for Republicans can
advance an executive career,
while only 9% thing it harm
ful. .. .
Redistribute Power
When you don't get a raise be
cause you worked for Cranston,
something is very wrong. But
there's no reason to give in. We
can nullify the power that op
presses us if we just get our
selves to gether. It means orga
nization and work.
It is imperative that we re
distribute power right here in
the university. Unless we do
this, we can't control our own
lives. It's that or continue to
witness and suffer political in
timidation.
