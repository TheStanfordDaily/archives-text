# Man Accosts Two Flo Mo Residents
## 
### 
A white male adult clad only
in a white tee-shirt and carrying
a knife accosted two women in
separate incidents in the Tre
sidder parking lot, Thursday
evening creating a scare in La
gunita Court and, to a lesser ex
tent, Roble Hall.
Two different women were
accosted, the first about 5:45,
the second around 6 p.m. Both
were Florence Moore residents.
Apparently the man asked di
rections and when the victim
approached the car he exposed
himself.
The incidents were reported to

Stanford Police about two hours
later. At 9:30 p.m., Florence
Moore director Margery Goldkin
called Margaret Burk, Lagun
ita's director, to alert her to the
incidents. Miss Burk posted a
notice on the entrance doors to
Lagunita advising women
against going out alone. This
notice also included a descrip
tion of the attacker and his car.
Early accounts said seven
women were accosted, but Stan
ford police sergeant Harman G.
Williams knew only of two re
ported from Florence Moore. He
denied the higher figure.
