# Malcolm Coauthor Speaks
## Violence A Sign Of Awakening 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Black violence is simply the
first manifestation of the awak
ening of black potential, a black
author asserted Friday.
Alex Haley, co-author of the
noted work Autobiography of
Malcolm X and interviewer for
Playboy magazine, told a crowd
of 400 that America will soon

witness a "flowering of black
talent."
Haley sees current unrest in
the nation's ghettos as the pent
up fury from 200 years of op
pression that may soon be
channeled into a "flood of tal
ents."
It is through the addition of
this heretofore "untapped re
source" that America has "the
potential to become the greatest
country in the world," he re
lated.
The Heritage of Africa
Haley built his talk, "The Vir
us of Violence," on the common
heritage of all black people—
Africa.
"When I see a black person,"
he said, "I find it's like looking
at the background of all 22 mil
lion of us. It's behind us all."
His upcoming book, Before
This Anger, is the result of five
years of research and travel in

Africa, Europe, and America.
During this time he searched
through every available record
and traced his family back to the
day an ancestor arrived on a
slave ship from Africa.
Family Lineage
Haley related his family line
age and his manner of research
to the Dinkelspiel Auditorium
audience, and added that there
is a similar story "for all 22 mil
lion of us."
"We black people need to
know the background of our
lives that was forcibly removed
from us in order to understand
what we are. We all spring from
the same thing," he commented.
Haley explained that Ameri
ca has so far "failed to deal with
reality" of the "15 million Afri
cans who were snatched away
as unwilling immigrants."
From this neglect of the black
man's history and humanity
springs today's violent society.

"You can't expect that the 200
years of slavery, oppression, and
degredation would not be paid
for," he asserted.
Details of Family History
The author, who is currently
a writer-in-residence at Hamil
ton College in New York,
amazed his audience with de
tails he has unearthed about his
family history, going back nine
generations.
Haley told of as a child hear
ing his grandmother's stories
that related the details of his
heritage, going all the way back
to a Virginia slave who arrived
from Africa two centuries be
fore.
His attempts to pin down the
circumstances of that slave's ar
rival in America has led Haley
to "every library, archive, and
museum in the western world,"
and has cost him $31,000 in air
plane tickets.
History-hunting Safari
The highlight of his investi
gations came on a safari to a
back country village in Africa—
"the first safari to hunt black
history"—that found an old
tribesman who knew his tribe's
lineage back to the time of the
capture of tribespeople by white
slave traders. And that tribes
man mentioned the name of that
same young man who turned up
in Virginia as a member of the
tribe who disappeared one day
from the village.
Haley opened his talk with a
description of his relationship
with the late Malcolm X, a black
nationalism spokesman.
Haley conjectured that had
Malcolm X not been felled by an
assassin's bullet, "his direction
would have been toward build
ing bridge between black people
and Africa."

FIREFIGHTERS cool a flaming truck of liquid hydrogen near a storage tank at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC). The truck's contents was ignited by a leak in a line from the tank to the
truck, as the vehicle was being filled. The fire which began at 6:30 p.m. last Friday caused no "serious
danger to the community ... or to the linear accelerator," according to Dr. Edward Seppi, head of the
Research Area Department. Non-combustable helium, used to blanket the burning hydrogen, Anally
extinguished the blaze.
