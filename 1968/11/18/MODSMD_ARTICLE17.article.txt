# Washington Record Spree
## Tribe Romps To Fifth Win, 24-0 
### FRED LEESON 
Stanford's football varsity
emerged from an unhospitable
reception in Stockton Saturday
afternoon with feelings of relief
and a 24-0 win over a battling
band of University of Pacific Ti
gers.
For the Indians there were
many highlights in the some
times ragged and incessantly
rugged struggle in which tem
pers stayed consistently just be
low the flaring point. Among
them:
• Gene Washington, who has
made exceptional performances
his routine, broke the Pacific-8
season record for pass receiving
yardage and demolished four
Stanford marks for year and ca
reer records in receptions and
yardage.
• The Tribe defense, whoch
had given up 20 or more points
in six games this season regis
tered its first shutout.
• Tim Abena ran back Stan
ford's first kick return for a
touchdown this year, a smooth
94-yard jaunt on the opening
kickoff.
• Howie Williams turned in
another fine afternoon of rush
ing with 129 yards including
scoring sprints of 49 and five
yards.
• And finally, there was a bi
zarre, inter-band fracas in the
fourth quarter which delayed the
game and put players on both
sides in unaccustomed roles as
spectators rather than partici
pants in their own spectacle.
No Patsies
The Tigers, hoping to impress
their homecoming crowd, to keep
a five game winning streak alive
and to prove they could compete
with teams of major university
caliber, played hard.
"Pacific hung in tough," Coach
John Ralston said afterward.
"They'd be a good representative
for the little Rose Bowl ... in
fact, they'd be an excellent rep
resentative for the west coast."
Assessment of the numerous
scrapes and bruises after the
hard-fought game indicated
there were no injuries more seri
ous than Greg Broughton's char
ley horse and Dick Keller's jar
ring head bump.
Ralston kept Bubba Brown
and Ron Kadziel out of the game,
giving them a rest and assuring
Stanford that everybody should
be in excellent shape for next
week's game with California.
Abena Stunner
Abena neutralized Pacific's
psychological advantage on the
first play of the game, stunning
the boisterous crowd of 20,500
with a 15 second, 93 yard touch
down run on the opening kickoff.
He shook off the last tackier on
the UOP 17 and Bill Shoemaker
made it 7-0 with his first of
three PAT's.
The Indians struck two more
times in the first half, Williams
scoring both touchdowns on the
ground.
Keller intercepted a Rand
Bergstrom pass on the Stanford
46 with 13:22 left in the half and
Jim Plunkett fired successive

passes to Washington on the
Pacific 37 and five.
Williams then took a pitchout
from Plunkett and angled into
the right corner for the score.
Records for Gene
Washington caught eight
passes for 109 yards in the three

quarters he played, bringing his
total to 64 receptions and 1029
yards, a new Pacific-8 record.
Plunkett hit on 12 of 21 passes
for 161 yards and Don Bunce
added two of four for 23 yards.
Mark Marquess, back from
baseball in Mexico and playing
before his home town fans, cap
tured a Tiger fumble on Stan
ford's 31 and then caught a 21
yard Plunkett aerial to set up
William's 49 yard scoring scam
per with 2:18 in the half.
Williams burst over right
guard, picked up blocks in the
secondary and was suddenly all
alone.
Though Stanford picked up 16
first downs and 360 total yards,
it couldn't move the ball con
sistently against the battling Ti
gers. The Indians put together a
string of three first downs once,
and that was with Bunce at the
controls and leading 24-0 in the
final period.
An intercepted pass, one of
two, ended that drive.
Stanford scored its final points
early in the third quarter, with
Shoemaker booting a field goal
from the Tiger 10. Pacific fum
bled on its first play after the
second half kickoff and Williams,
John Huss and Plunkett drove
from the Pacific 20 to the three.
Plunkett had no chance of hit
ting Washington on third down
who was completely covered in
the end zone, and the visitors
settled for the field goal.
Kellner Blocks FG
Pacific, which made 212 total
yards, never threatened until the
second half. Doug McKenzie and
Stu Kellner stopped one Tiger
drive, McKenzie dropping two
Tigers for losses from the Tribe
28 to 34 and Kellner blocking a
field goal rttempt from the 38.
After a Bunce fumble with
eight minutes left in the game,
Pacific drove to the Tribe three

where Terrell Smith grabbed a
fumble from Tony Plummer who
shot into the end zone without
the ball.
Tiger quarterback Mickey Ack
ley passed for 89 yards, hitting
7 of 18 attempts, mostly short
look-in and jump passes.
Band Fracas
The game was delayed with 11
minutes remaining when two
young Tiger fans raced off with
the ramrod from Stanford's can
non and carried it to the Pacific
band on the east side.
Indian bandsmen then raced
across the field from the west
side in pursuit, joined by nu
merous little kids. A few
players from the Pacific bench,
whose intentions were not clear,
joined the fracas and the Stan
ford band retreated without re
claiming its ramrod.
With the area finally cleared
and the officials about to resume
play, ten powder-blue helmeted
police sallied across the field to
man the already-created buffer
zone between bands.
The game was ultimately fin
ished and Stanford, content with
its victory and happy that no
body was injured, was glad to
leave Stockton.
And the Tribe — from Chief
•Ralston clear down to the low
liest of Indians — would like
to leave Berkeley the same way
next Saturday.
