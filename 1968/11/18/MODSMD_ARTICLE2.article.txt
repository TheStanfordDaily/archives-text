# Soto House
## Creativity Theme Continues 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
The striking thing about Soto
House as it exists on the western
edge of Wilburness, is that there
is nothing unique about the situ
ation: it is the residents that
are distinctive.
In the second year of co-educa
tional living centered around an
academic theme, the house has
not escaped university-wide at
tention. To some it is a whirl
wind of activity, to others a case
of creativity gone wild.
Tom Hause, who is spending
his third year as a tutor in
Soto, notes that students in the
house take "a sort of mutual in
dulgence in the fact that people
are active. No one here is trying
to convert anyone else."
Residents are quick to point
out that their orientation is not
an "artsy-craftsy" one. Nor is
the scope of their activity neces
sarily limited to creative inter
ests.
LASSU representatives are es
pecially familiar with Soto
House's legislative advocate,
Lawrence Pickup. He drew his
usual reception of laughter and
groans last week when, in the
midst of the debate on student
appointments to the Committee
of Fifteen, he rose to make some
extended comments in his comic
prose style.
Proposals originated by mem
bers of the house have brought
them in contact, and sometimes
confrontation, with the Univer
sity administration. Recent con
cern has centered around the
Food Service.
A Large Share
One administrator recently re
marked that a large share of ad
ministrative time goes just to
answer Soto House problems.
Like everything else connected
with the house, Soto manages to
get involved in these projects
without even a semblance of a
formal governing structure.
Jenny Holliday, who is one of
three house presidents, points
out that her selection evolved
over the dinner table one eve
ning. The resulting title of "tri
parte consortium representing
the people's will" is one of over
forty that members assigned to
each other.
Hause maintains that on the
third floor alone where he serves
as tutor there "are at least seven
different groups of people."
"The structure of the house,"
says Cherie Greene, a senior in
psychology, "encourages individ
uals that have something they
enjoy doing to put up a list. It is
a matter of being able to dare to
ask people to join in."
Students have rejected having
programs forced on them, says
faculty resident John Chowning.
For the first year of co-ed liv
ing in Soto, Chowning and the
tutors arranged for a member of

faculty to come and give talks
in the lounge after dinner. De
spite an expression of student
enthusiasm for this approach,
turn out was very small.
"Now, we don't push a pro
gram unless a student wants to
take it over," Chowning says.
A talk by Dr. John Mauer
from the Health Service on drug
usage drew a crowd of approxi
mately forty students last week.
Another student - planned pro
gram for next Tuesday will cen
ter around "student response to
the urban crisis".
Many Eating Associates
The house maintains its full
complement of eating associates,
and lots of people come by the
house to eat mea's with friends.
Approximately 180 people use
the dining room during an av
erage evening meal.
But this response has left Soto
with its share of problems. Resi
dents have complained that a
large number of the students
from Crothers Hall who eat in
Wilbur use the Soto dining room.
To deal with this problem, and
other "common grievances",
Hause and other Wilbur and
Branner students formed a com
mittee to meet with members of
the University Food Service and
offer suggestions.
Even though changes have oc
curred, Hause is far from satis
fied. "My whole view of student
power is transformed as a result
of this process," he says.
Changes to date include chang
ing the hours breakfast is
served, placing toasters in the in
dividual dining halls, and no
longer charging $10 for lost meal
tickets.
Residents are reluctant to at
tach any one political label to
the house as a whole. Concensus
seems to be that the house is
"somewhat left".
"Last year when the chips
were down for some particular
activity, I think that Soto turned
out more people than any other
house," says Rich Humber, a
senior in biology.
"It was a kind of latent politi
cal activism," he says. "But it
hasn't been here this year. Peo
ple just didn't get too excited
about the presidential race, al
though we did have one guy
work for Nixon."
Political Activists
Joel Primack. another tutor in
the house, sees Soto a focal point
for political activists. "They are
not necessarily people who live
here now," he says, "but those
who have lived here in the past
and now come back as eating as
sociates, friends, or as boy
friends of people in the house."
Last year Soto students or
ganizing a pottery seminar as
sisted in the construction of
Stanford's first pottery work
shop. The activity now involves

students in all of Wi'bur, as well
as other Stanford students.
"The response has been so fa
vorable, in fact," Chowning says,
"that the workshop could easily
be expanded to two to three
times its present size."
Along with these features of

Soto, there Is the aspect of the
house that most often occurs in
the minds of other University
residents. "Lots of people are fa
miliar with Lawrence Pickup,
the personality," explains one
Soto co-ed.
Last winter Soto presented an

original melodrama production,
"Chastity Is Its Own Punish
ment", for a two week run in
the residence's dining room.
Members of the house wrote, di
rected, produced, and performed
the whole show.
This year interest in some sort
of similar production proceeded
from initial planning stages
through script writing to pre
liminary try-out for parts in
three days.
Entitled "How the Grinch Stole
Christmas", the one-act play
draws heavily on Dr. Seuss's no
vel. It is scheduled to be pre
sented at the end of dead week.

Members of the house also or
ganize music evenings for peo
ple who share a common interest
in or who want to get together
in a congenial atmosphere for an
evening.
According to Cheri Greene, a
"very warm feeling" pervades
(he whole group. Students sit
around the fireplace eating
cheese and drinking wine, while
other students play their flute,
harp, piano, guitar, or whatever

musical instrument they bring
along.
Soto students, by and large,
insist that there is no drug prob
lem in their house. Much of the
association of Soto with drug
usage, one person suggested,
dates back to last year when a
number of people from through
out the university found the
house an easy place to congre
gate for usage.
Residents estimate that 80 per
cent of their number have tried
pot some time while they have
been at college. "It is the thing
to do in a group here to get
stoned, rather than to get
smashed on beer, like in a fra
ternity," says Hause.
Some thirty house members
have taken part in the body
massage seminar. Hause ob
tained the formula for a spe
cially concocted lotion consist
ing of peanut oil, olive oil, green
soap, turpentine, and the oil of
cloves, camphor, and winter
green.
"For most people it is mainly
a back rub," explains John
Weeks. "There are some people
who are more dedicated and go
on with a full body massage."
Weeks, who coordinates the
sessions, insists that sexual
gratification is not participants'
motive.
"People are interested in mas
sage, rather than in tricking
someone into something," he
says.
Future house plans call for
inviting people successful in any
field of creative endeavor to
spend a day in Soto. "Life style
is very contagious," explains
Primack. "And this is something
that students could get a lot
out of."
At any rate, Soto will continue
to meet the standards expressed
by one student, "creative and
ongoing."

"For most people it is mainly

A Large Share
One administrator recently re
marked that a large share of ad
ministrative time goes just to
answer Soto House problems.
Like everything else connected
with the house, Soto manages to
get involved in these projects
without even a semblance of a
formal governing structure.
Jenny Holliday, who is one of
three house presidents, points
out that her selection evolved
over the dinner table one eve
ning. The resulting title of "tri
parte consortium representing
the people's will" is one of over
forty that members assigned to
each other.
Hause maintains that on the
third floor alone where he serves
as tutor there "are at least seven
different groups of people."
"The structure of the house,"
says Cherie Greene, a senior in
psychology, "encourages individ
uals that have something they
enjoy doing to put up a list. It is
a matter of being able to dare to
ask people to join in."
Students have rejected having
programs forced on them, says
faculty resident John Chowning.
For the first year of co-ed liv
ing in Soto, Chowning and the
tutors arranged for a member of

faculty to come and give talks
in the lounge after dinner. De
spite an expression of student
enthusiasm for this approach,
turn out was very small.
"Now, we don't push a pro
gram unless a student wants to
take it over," Chowning says.
A talk by Dr. John Mauer
from the Health Service on drug
usage drew a crowd of approxi
mately forty students last week.
Another student - planned pro
gram for next Tuesday will cen
ter around "student response to
the urban crisis".
Many Eating Associates
The house maintains its full
complement of eating associates,
and lots of people come by the
house to eat mea's with friends.
Approximately 180 people use
the dining room during an av
erage evening meal.
But this response has left Soto
with its share of problems. Resi
dents have complained that a
large number of the students
from Crothers Hall who eat in
Wilbur use the Soto dining room.
To deal with this problem, and
other "common grievances",
Hause and other Wilbur and
Branner students formed a com
mittee to meet with members of
the University Food Service and
offer suggestions.
Even though changes have oc
curred, Hause is far from satis
fied. "My whole view of student
power is transformed as a result
of this process," he says.
Changes to date include chang
ing the hours breakfast is
served, placing toasters in the in
dividual dining halls, and no
longer charging $10 for lost meal
tickets.
Residents are reluctant to at
tach any one political label to
the house as a whole. Concensus
seems to be that the house is
"somewhat left".
"Last year when the chips
were down for some particular
activity, I think that Soto turned
out more people than any other
house," says Rich Humber, a
senior in biology.
"It was a kind of latent politi
cal activism," he says. "But it
hasn't been here this year. Peo
ple just didn't get too excited
about the presidential race, al
though we did have one guy
work for Nixon."
Political Activists
Joel Primack. another tutor in
the house, sees Soto a focal point
for political activists. "They are
not necessarily people who live
here now," he says, "but those
who have lived here in the past
and now come back as eating as
sociates, friends, or as boy
friends of people in the house."
Last year Soto students or
ganizing a pottery seminar as
sisted in the construction of
Stanford's first pottery work
shop. The activity now involves

students in all of Wi'bur, as well
as other Stanford students.
"The response has been so fa
vorable, in fact," Chowning says,
"that the workshop could easily
be expanded to two to three
times its present size."
Along with these features of

Soto, there Is the aspect of the
house that most often occurs in
the minds of other University
residents. "Lots of people are fa
miliar with Lawrence Pickup,
the personality," explains one
Soto co-ed.
Last winter Soto presented an

original melodrama production,
"Chastity Is Its Own Punish
ment", for a two week run in
the residence's dining room.
Members of the house wrote, di
rected, produced, and performed
the whole show.
This year interest in some sort
of similar production proceeded
from initial planning stages
through script writing to pre
liminary try-out for parts in
three days.
Entitled "How the Grinch Stole
Christmas", the one-act play
draws heavily on Dr. Seuss's no
vel. It is scheduled to be pre
sented at the end of dead week.

Members of the house also or
ganize music evenings for peo
ple who share a common interest
in or who want to get together
in a congenial atmosphere for an
evening.
According to Cheri Greene, a
"very warm feeling" pervades
(he whole group. Students sit
around the fireplace eating
cheese and drinking wine, while
other students play their flute,
harp, piano, guitar, or whatever

musical instrument they bring
along.
Soto students, by and large,
insist that there is no drug prob
lem in their house. Much of the
association of Soto with drug
usage, one person suggested,
dates back to last year when a
number of people from through

Last winter Soto presented an

original melodrama production,
"Chastity Is Its Own Punish
ment", for a two week run in
the residence's dining room.
Members of the house wrote, di
rected, produced, and performed
the whole show.
This year interest in some sort
of similar production proceeded
from initial planning stages
through script writing to pre
liminary try-out for parts in
three days.
Entitled "How the Grinch Stole
Christmas", the one-act play
draws heavily on Dr. Seuss's no
vel. It is scheduled to be pre
sented at the end of dead week.

Members of the house also or
ganize music evenings for peo
ple who share a common interest
in or who want to get together
in a congenial atmosphere for an
evening.
According to Cheri Greene, a
"very warm feeling" pervades
(he whole group. Students sit
around the fireplace eating
cheese and drinking wine, while
other students play their flute,
harp, piano, guitar, or whatever

musical instrument they bring
along.
Soto students, by and large,
insist that there is no drug prob
lem in their house. Much of the
association of Soto with drug
usage, one person suggested,
dates back to last year when a
number of people from through
out the university found the
house an easy place to congre
gate for usage.
Residents estimate that 80 per
cent of their number have tried
pot some time while they have
been at college. "It is the thing
to do in a group here to get
stoned, rather than to get
smashed on beer, like in a fra
ternity," says Hause.
Some thirty house members
have taken part in the body
massage seminar. Hause ob
tained the formula for a spe
cially concocted lotion consist
ing of peanut oil, olive oil, green
soap, turpentine, and the oil of
cloves, camphor, and winter
green.
"For most people it is mainly
a back rub," explains John
Weeks. "There are some people
who are more dedicated and go
on with a full body massage."
Weeks, who coordinates the
sessions, insists that sexual
gratification is not participants'
motive.
"People are interested in mas
sage, rather than in tricking
someone into something," he
says.
Future house plans call for
inviting people successful in any
field of creative endeavor to
spend a day in Soto. "Life style
is very contagious," explains
Primack. "And this is something
that students could get a lot
out of."
At any rate, Soto will continue
to meet the standards expressed
by one student, "creative and
ongoing."
The striking thing about Soto
House as it exists on the western
edge of Wilburness, is that there
is nothing unique about the situ

are distinctive.
In the second year of co-educa

academic theme, the house has
not escaped university-wide at
tention. To some it is a whirl
wind of activity, to others a case
of creativity gone wild.
Tom Hause, who is spending
his third year as a tutor in
Soto, notes that students in the
house take "a sort of mutual in
dulgence in the fact that people
are active. No one here is trying
to convert anyone else."
Residents are quick to point
out that their orientation is not
an "artsy-craftsy" one. Nor is
the scope of their activity neces

LASSU representatives are es
pecially familiar with Soto
House's legislative advocate,
Lawrence Pickup. He drew his
usual reception of laughter and
groans last week when, in the

A Large Share
One administrator recently re
marked that a large share of ad
ministrative time goes just to
answer Soto House problems.
Like everything else connected
with the house, Soto manages to
get involved in these projects
without even a semblance of a
formal governing structure.
Jenny Holliday, who is one of
three house presidents, points
out that her selection evolved
over the dinner table one eve
ning. The resulting title of "tri
parte consortium representing
the people's will" is one of over
forty that members assigned to
each other.
Hause maintains that on the
third floor alone where he serves
as tutor there "are at least seven
different groups of people."
"The structure of the house,"
says Cherie Greene, a senior in
psychology, "encourages individ
uals that have something they
enjoy doing to put up a list. It is
a matter of being able to dare to
ask people to join in."
Students have rejected having
programs forced on them, says
faculty resident John Chowning.
For the first year of co-ed liv
ing in Soto, Chowning and the
tutors arranged for a member of

faculty to come and give talks
in the lounge after dinner. De
spite an expression of student
enthusiasm for this approach,
turn out was very small.
"Now, we don't push a pro
gram unless a student wants to
take it over," Chowning says.
A talk by Dr. John Mauer
from the Health Service on drug
usage drew a crowd of approxi
mately forty students last week.
Another student - planned pro
gram for next Tuesday will cen
ter around "student response to
the urban crisis".
Many Eating Associates
The house maintains its full
complement of eating associates,
and lots of people come by the
house to eat mea's with friends.
Approximately 180 people use
the dining room during an av
erage evening meal.
But this response has left Soto
with its share of problems. Resi
dents have complained that a
large number of the students
from Crothers Hall who eat in
Wilbur use the Soto dining room.
To deal with this problem, and
other "common grievances",
Hause and other Wilbur and
Branner students formed a com
mittee to meet with members of
the University Food Service and
offer suggestions.
Even though changes have oc
curred, Hause is far from satis
fied. "My whole view of student
power is transformed as a result
of this process," he says.
Changes to date include chang
ing the hours breakfast is
served, placing toasters in the in
dividual dining halls, and no
longer charging $10 for lost meal
tickets.
Residents are reluctant to at
tach any one political label to
the house as a whole. Concensus
seems to be that the house is
"somewhat left".
"Last year when the chips
were down for some particular
activity, I think that Soto turned
out more people than any other
house," says Rich Humber, a
senior in biology.
"It was a kind of latent politi
cal activism," he says. "But it
hasn't been here this year. Peo
ple just didn't get too excited
about the presidential race, al
though we did have one guy
work for Nixon."
Political Activists
Joel Primack. another tutor in
the house, sees Soto a focal point
for political activists. "They are
not necessarily people who live
here now," he says, "but those
who have lived here in the past
and now come back as eating as
sociates, friends, or as boy
friends of people in the house."
Last year Soto students or
ganizing a pottery seminar as
sisted in the construction of
Stanford's first pottery work
shop. The activity now involves

students in all of Wi'bur, as well
as other Stanford students.
"The response has been so fa
vorable, in fact," Chowning says,
"that the workshop could easily
be expanded to two to three
times its present size."
Along with these features of

Soto, there Is the aspect of the
house that most often occurs in
the minds of other University
residents. "Lots of people are fa

out more people than any other
house," says Rich Humber, a
senior in biology.
"It was a kind of latent politi
cal activism," he says. "But it
hasn't been here this year. Peo
ple just didn't get too excited
about the presidential race, al
though we did have one guy
work for Nixon."
Political Activists
Joel Primack. another tutor in
the house, sees Soto a focal point
for political activists. "They are
not necessarily people who live
here now," he says, "but those
who have lived here in the past
and now come back as eating as
sociates, friends, or as boy
friends of people in the house."
Last year Soto students or
ganizing a pottery seminar as
sisted in the construction of
Stanford's first pottery work
shop. The activity now involves

students in all of Wi'bur, as well
as other Stanford students.
"The response has been so fa
vorable, in fact," Chowning says,
"that the workshop could easily
be expanded to two to three
times its present size."
Along with these features of

Soto, there Is the aspect of the
house that most often occurs in
the minds of other University
residents. "Lots of people are fa
miliar with Lawrence Pickup,
the personality," explains one
Soto co-ed.
Last winter Soto presented an

original melodrama production,
"Chastity Is Its Own Punish
ment", for a two week run in
the residence's dining room.
Members of the house wrote, di
rected, produced, and performed
the whole show.
This year interest in some sort
of similar production proceeded
from initial planning stages
through script writing to pre
liminary try-out for parts in
three days.
Entitled "How the Grinch Stole
Christmas", the one-act play
draws heavily on Dr. Seuss's no
vel. It is scheduled to be pre
sented at the end of dead week.

Members of the house also or
ganize music evenings for peo
ple who share a common interest
in or who want to get together
in a congenial atmosphere for an
evening.
According to Cheri Greene, a
"very warm feeling" pervades
(he whole group. Students sit
around the fireplace eating
cheese and drinking wine, while
other students play their flute,
harp, piano, guitar, or whatever

musical instrument they bring
along.
Soto students, by and large,
insist that there is no drug prob
lem in their house. Much of the
association of Soto with drug
usage, one person suggested,
dates back to last year when a
number of people from through
out the university found the
house an easy place to congre
gate for usage.
Residents estimate that 80 per
cent of their number have tried
pot some time while they have
been at college. "It is the thing
to do in a group here to get
stoned, rather than to get
smashed on beer, like in a fra
ternity," says Hause.
Some thirty house members
have taken part in the body
massage seminar. Hause ob
tained the formula for a spe
cially concocted lotion consist
ing of peanut oil, olive oil, green
soap, turpentine, and the oil of
cloves, camphor, and winter
green.
"For most people it is mainly
a back rub," explains John
Weeks. "There are some people
who are more dedicated and go
on with a full body massage."
Weeks, who coordinates the
sessions, insists that sexual
gratification is not participants'
motive.
"People are interested in mas
sage, rather than in tricking
someone into something," he
says.
Future house plans call for
inviting people successful in any
field of creative endeavor to
spend a day in Soto. "Life style
is very contagious," explains
Primack. "And this is something
that students could get a lot
out of."
At any rate, Soto will continue
to meet the standards expressed
by one student, "creative and
ongoing."
The striking thing about Soto
House as it exists on the western
edge of Wilburness, is that there
is nothing unique about the situ
ation: it is the residents that
are distinctive.
In the second year of co-educa
tional living centered around an
academic theme, the house has
not escaped university-wide at
tention. To some it is a whirl
wind of activity, to others a case
of creativity gone wild.
Tom Hause, who is spending
his third year as a tutor in
Soto, notes that students in the
house take "a sort of mutual in
dulgence in the fact that people
are active. No one here is trying
to convert anyone else."
Residents are quick to point
out that their orientation is not
an "artsy-craftsy" one. Nor is
the scope of their activity neces
sarily limited to creative inter
ests.
LASSU representatives are es
pecially familiar with Soto
House's legislative advocate,
Lawrence Pickup. He drew his
usual reception of laughter and
groans last week when, in the
midst of the debate on student
appointments to the Committee
of Fifteen, he rose to make some
extended comments in his comic
prose style.
Proposals originated by mem
bers of the house have brought
them in contact, and sometimes
confrontation, with the Univer

Food Service.
A Large Share
One administrator recently re
marked that a large share of ad
ministrative time goes just to
answer Soto House problems.
Like everything else connected
with the house, Soto manages to
get involved in these projects
without even a semblance of a
formal governing structure.
Jenny Holliday, who is one of
three house presidents, points
out that her selection evolved
over the dinner table one eve
ning. The resulting title of "tri
parte consortium representing
the people's will" is one of over
forty that members assigned to
each other.
Hause maintains that on the
third floor alone where he serves
as tutor there "are at least seven
different groups of people."
"The structure of the house,"
says Cherie Greene, a senior in
psychology, "encourages individ
uals that have something they
enjoy doing to put up a list. It is
a matter of being able to dare to
ask people to join in."
Students have rejected having
programs forced on them, says
faculty resident John Chowning.
For the first year of co-ed liv
ing in Soto, Chowning and the
tutors arranged for a member of

faculty to come and give talks
in the lounge after dinner. De
spite an expression of student
enthusiasm for this approach,
turn out was very small.
"Now, we don't push a pro
gram unless a student wants to
take it over," Chowning says.
A talk by Dr. John Mauer
from the Health Service on drug
usage drew a crowd of approxi
mately forty students last week.
Another student - planned pro
gram for next Tuesday will cen
ter around "student response to
the urban crisis".
Many Eating Associates
The house maintains its full
complement of eating associates,
and lots of people come by the
house to eat mea's with friends.
Approximately 180 people use
the dining room during an av
erage evening meal.
But this response has left Soto
with its share of problems. Resi
dents have complained that a
large number of the students
from Crothers Hall who eat in
Wilbur use the Soto dining room.
To deal with this problem, and
other "common grievances",
Hause and other Wilbur and
Branner students formed a com
mittee to meet with members of
the University Food Service and
offer suggestions.
Even though changes have oc
curred, Hause is far from satis
fied. "My whole view of student
power is transformed as a result
of this process," he says.
Changes to date include chang
ing the hours breakfast is
served, placing toasters in the in
dividual dining halls, and no
longer charging $10 for lost meal
tickets.
Residents are reluctant to at
tach any one political label to
the house as a whole. Concensus
seems to be that the house is
"somewhat left".
"Last year when the chips
were down for some particular
activity, I think that Soto turned
out more people than any other
house," says Rich Humber, a
senior in biology.
"It was a kind of latent politi
