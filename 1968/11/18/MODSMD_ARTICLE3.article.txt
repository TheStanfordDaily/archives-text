# Trustee Meeting Called About SFS
## 
### 
The State College Board of
Trustees meets in emergency
session in Los Angeles today
under pressure from Gov. Rea
gan to reopen San Francisco
State College Tuesday.
SF State President Robert D.
Smith, who also set Tuesday as
a target for resuming classes,
requested the school's 18,000 stu
dents to return to campus Mon
day "to exchange ideas" with
faculty members. He said there
would be no formal classes.
Reagan demanded Saturday
that the campus be reopened

Tuesday. He said the shutdown
ordered last Wednesday by
Smith after students tossed
rocks and bottles at city police
summoned to the school was
"unnecessary to protect persons
and property."
He added: "I have also re
ceived full assurance from po
lice officials that they can pro
vide the support necessary to
maintain order at the school
when it reopens."
Gov. Reagan, an ex-ofUcio
member of the board of trustees,
was critical of the college ad
ministration.

"By capitulating to a small
group of faculty and student
troublemakers," Reagan said,
"the San Francisco State College
Administration showed a woeful
lack of understanding of the di
visive tactics which were used
to disrupt the campus."
Confidence
The governor expressed con
fidence that the trustees will
"exercise their responsibility to
the people of California by tak
ing whatever measures are nec
essary" to reopen the school
Tuesday.
