# Campus Pushers
## Marijuana Use Steady 
### PATRICK McMAHON 
Marijuana use steady. Num
ber of users increasing.
Drug use down.
Prices remain stable after a
late summer rise.
That is the "state-of-the-art"
drawn from a series of inter
views with several "pushers" on
campus. According to six stu
dents and non-student dealers
interview over the last two
weeks, more student smoke
"grass," but less often this year.
One said, "Some people in
Hall are stoned all the time, so
you don't notice it so much."
Most of these pushers don't
see their rol s as "entrepre
neurs," but do it "to make a lit

tie spending money," or "to sup
ply the house."
A student in Stern Hall de
scribed the pot and drug market
as "a classical black market."
There is a great decentralization
in the Stanford market—"no
body asks anyone else any ques
tions about where the stuff
comes from,"and there appears
to be no central supply.
One student makes several
"runs" each year to Mexico,
while another says he gets the
"small amount" that he sells
from a friend off campus.
Not Atypical
Stanford drug and marijuana
use is not atypical. However, un
like most universities and col

leges, there is a feeling among
many students that the Stanford
campus is a "sanctuary" from
the police.
Last spring, however, Stan
ford officials upset by this feel
ing of sanctuary by students is
sued a statement that Stanford
"will not serve as a sanctuary
from enforcement of drug laws."
Two students were arrested
last spring by Stanford police
for marijuana possession on the
campus, but the case was
dropped because the police had
no warrant to enter the private
Breakers Eating Club.
Stanford psychologist Richard
Blum of the Institute for the
Study of Human Problems esti
mated that twenty per cent of
Stanford students have tried
marijuana and four per cent
have used it more often than
once a week.
A poll of Stern Hall residents
last year indicated that in that
particular residence nearly two
thirds of the students had "ex
perimented with marijuana," but
only one-fourth used it often or
regularly.
Want To Try It
The pushers estimated that
the majority of their sales were
to people who wanted to "try it,
but were not anxious for large
quantities for prolonged usage."

However, one person who has
been "dealing in this area for
three or four years," reports
that "hash" (hashish) and speed
amphetamines) are popular,
but acid (LSD) usage is down.
The price of marijuana "is
now about $15 a lid (an ounce)
for good stuff, but $10-12 for
mediocre stuff." The cost has
risen during the summer, "be
cause it has just been harder
to get in the area."
The dealers don't look forward
with glee to new business. Said
one: "With the Palo Alto police
and Richard Nixon going where
they're going, things will get
rougher."
Another however, insisted that
there "is a new market in fra
ternities. While coeducational
dorms have always been better
markets, the frats are really
turning on!" He cited several
well established fraternities on
campus.
"With a new emphasis here
on community action and con
cern for politics and less interest
in introspection, the hard-core
drug users are disappearing.
There will always be a market
for marijuana's sociable aspects,
but as a stepping stone to fur
ther usage, it's all through," he
added.

The dealers don't look forward
with glee to new business. Said
one: "With the Palo Alto police
and Richard Nixon going where
they're going, things will get
rougher."
Another however, insisted that
there "is a new market in fra
ternities. While coeducational
dorms have always been better
markets, the frats are really
turning on!" He cited several
well established fraternities on
campus.
"With a new emphasis here
on community action and con
cern for politics and less interest
in introspection, the hard-core
drug users are disappearing.
There will always be a market
for marijuana's sociable aspects,
but as a stepping stone to fur
ther usage, it's all through," he
added.
Marijuana use steady. Num
ber of users increasing.
Drug use down.
Prices remain stable after a
late summer rise.
That is the "state-of-the-art"
drawn from a series of inter
views with several "pushers" on
campus. According to six stu
dents and non-student dealers
interview over the last two
weeks, more student smoke
"grass," but less often this year.
One said, "Some people in
Hall are stoned all the time, so
you don't notice it so much."
Most of these pushers don't
see their rol s as "entrepre
neurs," but do it "to make a lit

tie spending money," or "to sup
ply the house."
A student in Stern Hall de
scribed the pot and drug market
as "a classical black market."
There is a great decentralization
in the Stanford market—"no
body asks anyone else any ques
tions about where the stuff
comes from,"and there appears
to be no central supply.
One student makes several
"runs" each year to Mexico,
while another says he gets the
"small amount" that he sells
from a friend off campus.
Not Atypical
Stanford drug and marijuana
use is not atypical. However, un
like most universities and col

leges, there is a feeling among
many students that the Stanford
campus is a "sanctuary" from
the police.
Last spring, however, Stan
ford officials upset by this feel
ing of sanctuary by students is
sued a statement that Stanford
"will not serve as a sanctuary
from enforcement of drug laws."
Two students were arrested
last spring by Stanford police
for marijuana possession on the
campus, but the case was
dropped because the police had
no warrant to enter the private
Breakers Eating Club.
Stanford psychologist Richard
Blum of the Institute for the
Study of Human Problems esti
mated that twenty per cent of
Stanford students have tried
marijuana and four per cent
have used it more often than
once a week.
A poll of Stern Hall residents
last year indicated that in that
particular residence nearly two
thirds of the students had "ex
perimented with marijuana," but
only one-fourth used it often or
regularly.
Want To Try It
The pushers estimated that
the majority of their sales were
to people who wanted to "try it,
but were not anxious for large
quantities for prolonged usage."

However, one person who has
been "dealing in this area for
three or four years," reports
that "hash" (hashish) and speed
amphetamines) are popular,
but acid (LSD) usage is down.
The price of marijuana "is
now about $15 a lid (an ounce)
for good stuff, but $10-12 for
mediocre stuff." The cost has
risen during the summer, "be
cause it has just been harder
to get in the area."
