"We're over at Stanford. We've been kidnapped. Tell everybody.
This is Amy." Click.
Amy Purrington breathlessly put the receiver down.
She was led out of the booth over to the Plaza. There she grinned
broadly with her arm upraised giving the victory sign with her
fingers as her picture was taken.
To many it seemed a little early for "Big Game" pranks but for
Amy Purrington and Mary Haley, a pair of Berkeley pom-pom
dollies, early was over last Tuesday.
Telephone Call
It all began with an evening telephone call Tuesday to the Daily
Californian.
A Stanford student identified himself under the hastily devised
name of Bert Kempert ("all I could think of was Bert Kaemphert,
the musician") a student reporter from the San Francisco Chroni
cle, inquiring the names and addresses of the Berkeley pom-pom
girls.
The always cooperative student newspaper gave Kempert the
name of Kappa Kappa Gamma Sorority pointing out that at least
one pom-pom girl lived there.
Appointment
Kempert and a band of equally daring henchmen made an ap
pointment Saturday morning ostensibly to take a few pictures for
a comparison story between Stanford and Berkeley pom-pom doll
ies. Kempert, described it from there.
"We told her we wanted to take some pictures of them at both
the fountain and at the gate. She offered to bring all the cheer
leaders, but we only had room for a few. So she gave us the name
and number of Mary Haley. We called her up and made the ar
rangements."
Conspiracy
That set up a chain of events which may go down as one of the
all-time great conspiracies.
A collection was made in Arroyo and Florence Moore Halls for
the Blitz Cal fund. Not much later garbed in Cal Tee shirts the
group made a similar collection this time at Berkeley for the Blitz
Stanford fund.
Saturday they pulled around the corner at ten-o'clock with the
freshly painted words San Francisco Chronicle still running on the
side of the car.
Abduction
After that it was a simple process of getting the girls into the
car. About that time someone walked up who identifying himself
as John Stillman a reporter from the Daily Californian and he was
promptly escorted into the car as well. At this point the girls were
sandwiched between two guys with one in the front and one in the
back seat of the car driven by one of the truly imaginative names—
Knatty Bumpo.
"They still weren't suspicious but when we turned left at College
(which is in the direction leading away from the University) they
became uneasy. They still didn't say anything when wo began
crossing the Bay Bridge.
It was at this point all was told, and one of the girls mentioned
the rather blatant fact, "My father is a lawyer," to which was heard
the equally blatant reply by one of the nameless, "so is mine."
Picture Taking
When they arrived at Stanford the conspirators wasted no time
taking pictures at the top of Hoover tower, in front of the fountain
at White Plaza, and in various other locations.
From there they were led blissfully ("If you don't cooperate
you may never get back") for more pictures.
They were later taken back—in time for the second quarter of
the Oregon-California football game.
The abduction has been recorded for posterity. Radio station
KZSU was along also recording the events as they occurred. Broad
cast of the affair has been set for 3 p.m. today.
More is in store according to Kempert. Already he has sent a note
back to Berkeley asking for a date with one of the girls.
But for the moment the group is just relaxing drinking from the
keg they bought with the collection money from the Beat Stanford
fund.


PRANK VICTIMS —"Biff Game" prank playing got off to an early start over the weekend as these
California pom-pom girls will readily testify. The two were abducted from Berkeley over the week
end much to their surprise for an unexpected picture taking journey to Stanford.

side of the car.
Abduction
After that it was a simple process of getting the girls into the
car. About that time someone walked up who identifying himself
as John Stillman a reporter from the Daily Californian and he was
promptly escorted into the car as well. At this point the girls were
sandwiched between two guys with one in the front and one in the
back seat of the car driven by one of the truly imaginative names—
Knatty Bumpo.
"They still weren't suspicious but when we turned left at College
(which is in the direction leading away from the University) they
became uneasy. They still didn't say anything when wo began
crossing the Bay Bridge.
It was at this point all was told, and one of the girls mentioned
the rather blatant fact, "My father is a lawyer," to which was heard
the equally blatant reply by one of the nameless, "so is mine."
Picture Taking
When they arrived at Stanford the conspirators wasted no time
taking pictures at the top of Hoover tower, in front of the fountain
at White Plaza, and in various other locations.
From there they were led blissfully ("If you don't cooperate
you may never get back") for more pictures.
They were later taken back—in time for the second quarter of
the Oregon-California football game.
The abduction has been recorded for posterity. Radio station
KZSU was along also recording the events as they occurred. Broad
cast of the affair has been set for 3 p.m. today.
More is in store according to Kempert. Already he has sent a note
back to Berkeley asking for a date with one of the girls.
But for the moment the group is just relaxing drinking from the
keg they bought with the collection money from the Beat Stanford
fund.


PRANK VICTIMS —"Biff Game" prank playing got off to an early start over the weekend as these
California pom-pom girls will readily testify. The two were abducted from Berkeley over the week
end much to their surprise for an unexpected picture taking journey to Stanford.
"We're over at Stanford. We've been kidnapped. Tell everybody.
This is Amy." Click.
Amy Purrington breathlessly put the receiver down.
She was led out of the booth over to the Plaza. There she grinned
broadly with her arm upraised giving the victory sign with her
fingers as her picture was taken.
To many it seemed a little early for "Big Game" pranks but for
Amy Purrington and Mary Haley, a pair of Berkeley pom-pom
dollies, early was over last Tuesday.
Telephone Call
It all began with an evening telephone call Tuesday to the Daily
Californian.
A Stanford student identified himself under the hastily devised
name of Bert Kempert ("all I could think of was Bert Kaemphert,
the musician") a student reporter from the San Francisco Chroni
cle, inquiring the names and addresses of the Berkeley pom-pom
girls.
The always cooperative student newspaper gave Kempert the
name of Kappa Kappa Gamma Sorority pointing out that at least
one pom-pom girl lived there.
Appointment
Kempert and a band of equally daring henchmen made an ap
pointment Saturday morning ostensibly to take a few pictures for
a comparison story between Stanford and Berkeley pom-pom doll
ies. Kempert, described it from there.
"We told her we wanted to take some pictures of them at both
the fountain and at the gate. She offered to bring all the cheer
leaders, but we only had room for a few. So she gave us the name
and number of Mary Haley. We called her up and made the ar
rangements."
Conspiracy
That set up a chain of events which may go down as one of the
all-time great conspiracies.
A collection was made in Arroyo and Florence Moore Halls for
the Blitz Cal fund. Not much later garbed in Cal Tee shirts the
group made a similar collection this time at Berkeley for the Blitz
Stanford fund.
Saturday they pulled around the corner at ten-o'clock with the
freshly painted words San Francisco Chronicle still running on the
side of the car.
