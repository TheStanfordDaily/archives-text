"The diversity

"At IBM you're constantly working with people in
a lot of different fields," says Gary Kozak.
A Ph.D. in analytical-physical chemistry, Gary's an
IBM Development Chemist and Project Manager. "The
# diversity helps you keep up to date," he says. "You
find out what's new in fields that affect your specialty,
and you get a better idea of where you fit into the total
picture."
Gary describes how people with different back
grounds work together on the solid logic technology
used in our System/360 computers:
"An E.E. tells you how many conductors you'll have,
where they go, and what should be at the terminals.
An M.E. designs fixturing and automatic processes.
A polymer chemist formulates insulators and says how
they should be used. The metallurgist specifies alloy
compositions. The physicist decides how to optimize
a process for producing transistors and diodes. And
all these people have to talk with each other and help
each other."
An informal atmosphere
A constant mesh of people in different fields would
be impossible in a rigid working environment. So we
makesureours is relaxed and informal. "Nobody
standsover your shoulder," says Gary. "It's a great
place for a scientist to develop his potential." That
could be one reason IBM has pioneered such major
advances as the injection laser and the Gunn effect.
