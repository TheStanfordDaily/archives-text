# Palo Alto Police Chief Views Wake Arrests
## 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON 
Palo Alto Police Chief William
Hydie thinks he and his men
have gotten a raw deal.
Hydie especially has come un
der attack from students, facul
ty, and administrators for last
week's on-campus arrests by the
Palo Alto police.
The arrests for "failure to dis
perse" stemmed from the "Elec
toral Wake" election night in
Lytton Plaza in Palo Alto. Ac
counts vary as to exactly what
happened but most involved
agree that several trash fires
were set on University Ave., a
police car had two windows bro
ken, and the Palo Alto police
ordered the crowd to disperse.
Chief Hydie further states that
one officer was hit in the face
with a rock. In an interview with
The Daily, Hydie said, "There
has been little explanation of the
problem the community faced
that night."
Reaction Expected
The 30-year police veteran said
he had expected unfavorable re
action from part of the univer
sity community over the on

campus arrests of Mark Sapir
and Jim Johnson last Wednes
day. The sources of the reaction
"surprised" him, however. The
Academic Senate, the student
legislature and the acting presi
dent all voiced apprehension over
the arrests, particularly John
son's.
Hydie believes the arrests of
Sapir and Johnson as well as
that of English Prof. Bruce
Franklin were "very valid." He
said that the time lag between
the demonstration and the is
suance of arrest warrants, two
and-a-half days for Franklin
and Sapir and seven days for
Johnson, was "relatively short."
He says the six day lag oc
curred in the Johnson case be
cause "we simply didn't know
who he was." Hydie also empha
sizes that the three warrants
were issued only after the dis
trict attorney and a judge agreed
that the evidence justified issu
ing an arrest warrant.
Time Needed
"It takes time to document the
investigation, see the district at
torney and then the judge," Hy

die said. "It is not just a matter
of the police arresting them
without examining the evidence,"
he continued.
Hydie flatly denied tapping
Franklin's ph on e. Franklin
alleges that his phone is being
tapped, offering as support that
the arrival of Palo Alto police at
a rendezvous with his lawyer
before Franklin himself arrived.
Arrangements for the meeting
had been made over the phone,
according to Franklin.
The police chief did concede
that his men arrived on the scene
at a fortunate moment. "If in
the daily pursuit of our duty, all
our arrests were made this fast,
our job would be much easier,"
Hydie said.

The arrest of Sapir at the
medical school has drawn some
criticism because the Palo Alto
officers almost arrested the
wrong man, Kim Woodard of the
Free University. Woodard and
Sapir both have beards and Hy
die says, "There is some resem
blance."
Hydie revealed that the ar
resting officers have made a re
port on the "momentary mista
ken identity." He denied a re
port in the Peninsula Observer
that Woodard was actually ar
rested. "No one was placed under
arrest then," he asserted.
"The officer readily admits he
first went to Woodard," Hydie
continued. The arresting officers
were Capt. Guy Wathen and
Sgt. Allan Bowra. According to
Hydie, Wathen mistakenly ap
proached Woodard. The Penin
sula Observer reports Bowra
made the approach.
Tresidder Arrest
The arrest of Johnson in Tre
sidder Union has aroused the
most reaction at Stanford. He
was arrested Wednesday after
noon on a warrant issued that
morning.
Johnson was arrested by Palo
Alto Sgt. Anthony Poso who
also arrested Franklin. He was
accompanied by Stanford Police
Inspector Don Lillie. Hydie said
"It is a longstanding procedure,
if we go into any other com
munity, to tell the local officers."

In this case the Santa Clara
Sheriff's Office was contacted as
well as the Stanford Police.
Hydie revealed that no in
vestigations are currently being
conducted "regarding any indi
vidual." He did say that several
people had been regarded as
suspects under the failure to dis
perse law but that there was
not enough evidence to support
the charge.
University Community
Reflecting on law enforcement
in a university community, Hy
die said "police problems are
considerably different in a uni
versity community, though
there are fewer problems here
than where most of the state
universities are."
He regrets the fact that the
Palo Alto police have not been
able to establish a smooth work
ing relationship with Stanford.
This is, in part, due to the in
creasing preoccupation of the
police with Palo Alto com
munity relations "so the citizens
can better assess the police's
functions," leaving little time
to work with the university, he
commented.
"I hope people will feel most
welcome to come in here to
assess our policies and profes
sional manners," he continued.
The interview concluded with
Hydie saying, "Those offenses
were not against the police, they
were against other people's
rights."

feels too much attention has been given to the fact that two stu
dents were arrested on campus and not enough to the "dangerous
situation" that existed on Election night. In an interview with THE
DAILY yesterday, Hydie called the arrests of students Jim Johnson
and Marc Sapir as well as English Prof. Bruce Franklin "valid."
