# Jailhouse Blues
## Special Treatment For Jim 
### JAMES JOHNSON 
The Stanford Student Body seems to be upset by the fact that I
was arrested on campus. It seems to me that most people are
missing the political and racial (yes, racial) implications of my
arrest. The campus should be concerned by the fact that the people
who were singled out for delayed arrest (Bruce, Marc, and myself)
are people whom the police identify as politicos or troublemakers.
I probably look like a trouble-maker, since I'm not really sure
of my politics. Sgt. Poso saw me at the bail rally the day after
Election Day. He tried to identify me. No one would tell him who
that little smart-assed nigger with the toy gun was. That was my
only protection against the local law enforcement agency. They had
made the big time the night before: clubbed some of those punks'
heads.
It took the sergeant a week to identify me and get enough evi
dence (?) to have a warrant issued for my arrest. I wonder if the
police make an effort to catch crooks in the same manner. In the
past two years I've had a thousand dollars in TV's, stereos, and
cameras stolen from me, the police havn't come up with so much
as a trace. But they are good at repressing people.
The administration is concerned about the "time lag." I hope
they discussed this with the Palo Alto Chief of Police Friday morn
ing. I wonder if they questioned the nature of the arrests or were
they concerned that the police had brought a little of the real world
to the campus and were provoking students by making arrests on
campus?
There is some significance to the fact that they arrested Marc
and me on campus. Are they afraid to come to East Palo Alto? The
only reason I didn't head home that afternoon was because I saw
Bruce Franklin in the Union, most of my brothers had split. I
didn't go to the demonstration at the med-school and I hadn't
planned to go on the march that afternoon. My brothers' admoni
tions about "the fly in the buttermilk" were beginning to bother me
again.
I felt that there might be trouble on the march and I didn't want
to be there when the police started cracking heads, seeing as black
heads seem to gather clubs more rapidly than white. At the "Wake"

one of my brothers was clubbed and left lying face down in the
street. They didn't even bother to arrest him. I can't see trying tc
fight someone who has a club and a gun and is more than half s
foottaller than I am.
On the way down to the county jail Sgt. Poso made a remark
about Bruce and myself. He said that we were pretty brave wher
we had a thousand people behind us. Sgt. Bozo was pretty brave
implying that I was a coward when my hands were cuffed behinc
my back. I'm not afraid of any fat punk like him. Maybe I should
be since you don't have to be very brave to pull a trigger, especially
if you're shooting at a nigger. But cowardice doesn't run in my
family or my race. One day chumps like him won't be able to hide
behind a badge and a gun.
Sgt. Bozo probably thought he could teach this little black boy a
lesson. He tried to bait me. I was searched three times. The seconc
time he claimed he felt something hard in the front of my pants
He ordered me to the drunk tank and made me take down my pants
and, finding nothing there except my penis, made me bend over and
spread my cheeks to make sure I hadn't put that hard thing up my
At the time when he felt something hard he said he'd have tc
check, referring to some incident where a gun had gotten into juve
nile hall. I was the only one arrested on a misdemeanor that was
searched in this manner. It's little things like this that cause b
brother to have little faith in this country.
One more little thing that causes a click in a black man's mind
my mind: Bruce and Marc weren't released on their own recogni
cance. I didn't bother to ask. They said I'd have to stay overnight
before I'd see a judge. Click! That cop who murdered George Bask
ett in San Francisco was released when he was charged with mur
der.
Blacks will be watching my trail to see if a black man can get
justice in a white judicial system. BLIND justice. It certainly is,
when it comes to black people. If The Palo Alto Times reflects the
attitude of the white community when they say that BSU should be
thrown off-campus, then I don't have much of a chance.
I'm a dues paying member of one organization: the Black Stu
dents' Union.
