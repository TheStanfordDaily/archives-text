## I Weep For You, The Walrus Said 
### JANE FRANKLIN 
" 'I weep for you,' the Walrus
said:
'I deeply sympathize.'
With sobs and tears he sorted
out
Those of the largest size,
Holding his pocket
handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes."
Bay Area newspapers report a
flurry of anger and concern from
Stanford because Palo Alto po

lice came on the campus to ar
rest two students. Associate
Provost and Dean of Students
Joel Smith and Associate Dean
of Students William Wyman are
among those deploring that such
arrests were made without con
sultation with the proper uni
versity officials.
Provost Richard Lyman and
Acting President Robert Glaser
discussed proper procedures with
the proper Palo Alto official, City
Manager George Morgan. Down
the hierarchy a bit Student Body
President Denis Hayes met with
Palo Alto Police Chief William
Hydie.
Wooden Leg
Meanwhile the current issue

of Life features page after page
of the heroic struggle of a Viet
namese child. This little girl
dared to pick wild vegetables in
a "free fire zone." A U.S. heli
copter's gunman shot half her
leg off. But the story has a hap
py ending. The U.S. soldiers
landed and, finding that she was
not a dirty commie, gently took
hor aboard.
Now she has been fitted with a
wooden leg and is bravely learn
ing to use it. One picture shows
her with some second-grade
classmates. She has had to move
so often (her original village was
completely destroyed by U.S.
fire power because the U.S. was
saving it from the Viet Cong)

that she is now five years older
than most of her classmates. She
is one of Vietnam's "refugees."
These "refugees" flee the dirty
commies at the gunpoint of clean
marines, who raze their villages
and herd the people into "stra
tegic hamlets," where they live
under the power that comes out
of the barrel of U.S. guns. Now
you may think I'm straying off
course — like some of our bomb
ers — by leaping from orderly
Stanford to war-torn Vietnam;
so I'll complete the circle, zero
ing in to the core of academia,
to "pure" research, objective an
alysis — where people are an
alyzed as if they were objects.
For another name for the stra
tegic hamlet plan is the Staley
Plan. Dr. Eugent Staley is in
the education department at
Stanford. He is a nice, even
thoughtful, man. But he went to
Saigon for a few weeks in 1961
and returned with a military pro
posal for handling South Viet
namese civilians.
CIA PROTEST
Last fall students, faculty, and
— beware — people from the
surrounding communities dem
onstrated against the Universi
ty's offering its facilities for the
use of the CIA, which all of us
by now, must know is actively
using "coercive tactics" against
most of the world's people. Joel
Smith and Bill Wyman played
key roles in the persecution of
seven of those demonstrators.
The seven were chosen from the
many because Bill Wyman,
whom some of them had con
sidered a friend, knew them and
knew they were activists.
None of these administrators
with his own hands would de
foliate anyone's food crops, caus
ing, as the most immediate re
sult, the starvation of infants;
yet they work hand in glove with
nine of the directors of SRI
(trustees of the University)
where research for developing
defoliants is carried out. Surely
none of them would shoot at a
child like the little girl in the
"free fire zone;" yet the latest
"Stanford Observer" says, under
the headline "Only 16 of 1600
projects are Classified" ("Don't
look at us that way — in 1967-68
there were 1600 things to do and
only 16 were things we can't talk
about."), that Lyman and Prof.
William Baxter's new report on
research at Stanford shows that
"Defense" projects provided
more money ($17,839,300) than
any other agency.
The contradiction between
working to uphold the values of
a University which actively sup
ports wars against the people
and being a friend to anyone

who opposes those wars with ac
tion and not just words — tha.
contradiction has placed these
men in a contradictory position.
New Committee*
Since the sit-in of last spring,
the University has moved as
only powerful bodies can move
to "correct" the situation. New
rules have been set. Many co./i
-mittees have been formed. One
is to study SRI and its relation
to the University. There will be
plenty of time for "the deliber
ative bodies of the University"
to act in "the spirit of rational
discussion and the critical ex
amination of issues, without
which a University cannot func
tion" (wording from statement
condemning campus coercion).
Still another committee will
"advise and counsel" about po
tential demonstrations on the
campus. One of the members is
Dean Rambo, who in the spring
of 1966 had the only secret CIA
contract that the Stanford Com
mittee for Peace in Vietnam
could find out about. That is,
we found that it existed; of
course, its nature remained sec
ret, contrary to the "spirit of
rational discussion and the criti
cal examination of issues" and
all those "deliberative" values.
So let us not get lost in the
haze of protesting the presence
of off-campus police on campus.
The Palo Alto police are minor
compared to what is already on
campus. Let's ask instead that
those 270 professors who signed
the statement condemning cam
pus coercion speak out now
against the coercive tactics that
are depriving this and all other
American communities of the
right to live as free human be
ings, of the right to refuse to be
coerced into supporting those
parts of the University which
actively work for the overthrow
or prevention of people's govern
ments and actively contribute to
the consequent starvation and
murder of our brothers and sis
ters. Let those who are truly
human, that is, humane, make
the choice, for let's face it, the
middle ground is slipping away.
Try to understand this at any
rate: "If violence began this very
evening and if exploitation and
oppression had never existed on
the earth, perhaps the slogans
of non-violence might end the
quarrel. But if the whole regime,
even your non-violent ideas, are
conditioned by a thousand-year
old oppression, your passivity
serves only to place you in the
ranks of the oppressors."

is to study SRI and its relation
to the University. There will be
plenty of time for "the deliber
ative bodies of the University"
to act in "the spirit of rational
discussion and the critical ex
amination of issues, without
which a University cannot func
tion" (wording from statement
condemning campus coercion).
Still another committee will
"advise and counsel" about po
tential demonstrations on the
campus. One of the members is
Dean Rambo, who in the spring
of 1966 had the only secret CIA
contract that the Stanford Com
mittee for Peace in Vietnam
could find out about. That is,
we found that it existed; of
course, its nature remained sec
ret, contrary to the "spirit of
rational discussion and the criti
cal examination of issues" and
all those "deliberative" values.
So let us not get lost in the
haze of protesting the presence
of off-campus police on campus.
The Palo Alto police are minor
compared to what is already on
campus. Let's ask instead that
those 270 professors who signed
the statement condemning cam
pus coercion speak out now
against the coercive tactics that
are depriving this and all other
American communities of the
right to live as free human be
ings, of the right to refuse to be
coerced into supporting those
parts of the University which
actively work for the overthrow
or prevention of people's govern
ments and actively contribute to
the consequent starvation and
murder of our brothers and sis
ters. Let those who are truly
human, that is, humane, make
the choice, for let's face it, the
middle ground is slipping away.
Try to understand this at any
rate: "If violence began this very
evening and if exploitation and
oppression had never existed on
the earth, perhaps the slogans
of non-violence might end the
quarrel. But if the whole regime,
even your non-violent ideas, are
conditioned by a thousand-year
old oppression, your passivity
serves only to place you in the
ranks of the oppressors."
Jean-Paul Sartre
Preface to
Wretched of the Earth
" 'I weep for you,' the Walrus

With sobs and tears he sorted

Wooden Leg
Meanwhile the current issue

of Life features page after page
of the heroic struggle of a Viet
namese child. This little girl
dared to pick wild vegetables in
a "free fire zone." A U.S. heli
copter's gunman shot half her
leg off. But the story has a hap
py ending. The U.S. soldiers
landed and, finding that she was
not a dirty commie, gently took
hor aboard.
Now she has been fitted with a
wooden leg and is bravely learn
ing to use it. One picture shows
her with some second-grade
classmates. She has had to move
so often (her original village was
completely destroyed by U.S.
fire power because the U.S. was
saving it from the Viet Cong)

that she is now five years older
than most of her classmates. She
is one of Vietnam's "refugees."
These "refugees" flee the dirty
commies at the gunpoint of clean
marines, who raze their villages
and herd the people into "stra
tegic hamlets," where they live
under the power that comes out
of the barrel of U.S. guns. Now
you may think I'm straying off
course — like some of our bomb
ers — by leaping from orderly
Stanford to war-torn Vietnam;
so I'll complete the circle, zero
ing in to the core of academia,
to "pure" research, objective an
alysis — where people are an
alyzed as if they were objects.
For another name for the stra
tegic hamlet plan is the Staley
Plan. Dr. Eugent Staley is in
the education department at
Stanford. He is a nice, even
thoughtful, man. But he went to
Saigon for a few weeks in 1961
and returned with a military pro
posal for handling South Viet
namese civilians.
CIA PROTEST
Last fall students, faculty, and
— beware — people from the
surrounding communities dem
onstrated against the Universi
ty's offering its facilities for the
use of the CIA, which all of us
by now, must know is actively
using "coercive tactics" against
most of the world's people. Joel
Smith and Bill Wyman played
key roles in the persecution of
seven of those demonstrators.
The seven were chosen from the
many because Bill Wyman,
whom some of them had con
sidered a friend, knew them and
knew they were activists.
None of these administrators
with his own hands would de
foliate anyone's food crops, caus
ing, as the most immediate re
sult, the starvation of infants;
yet they work hand in glove with
nine of the directors of SRI
(trustees of the University)
where research for developing
defoliants is carried out. Surely
none of them would shoot at a
child like the little girl in the
"free fire zone;" yet the latest
"Stanford Observer" says, under
the headline "Only 16 of 1600
projects are Classified" ("Don't
look at us that way — in 1967-68
there were 1600 things to do and
only 16 were things we can't talk
about."), that Lyman and Prof.
William Baxter's new report on
research at Stanford shows that
"Defense" projects provided
more money ($17,839,300) than
any other agency.
The contradiction between
working to uphold the values of
a University which actively sup
ports wars against the people
and being a friend to anyone

who opposes those wars with ac
tion and not just words — tha.
contradiction has placed these
men in a contradictory position.

CIA PROTEST
Last fall students, faculty, and
— beware — people from the
surrounding communities dem
onstrated against the Universi
ty's offering its facilities for the
use of the CIA, which all of us
by now, must know is actively
using "coercive tactics" against
most of the world's people. Joel
Smith and Bill Wyman played
key roles in the persecution of
seven of those demonstrators.
The seven were chosen from the
many because Bill Wyman,
whom some of them had con
sidered a friend, knew them and
knew they were activists.
None of these administrators
with his own hands would de
foliate anyone's food crops, caus
ing, as the most immediate re
sult, the starvation of infants;
yet they work hand in glove with
nine of the directors of SRI
(trustees of the University)
where research for developing
defoliants is carried out. Surely
none of them would shoot at a
child like the little girl in the
"free fire zone;" yet the latest
"Stanford Observer" says, under
the headline "Only 16 of 1600
projects are Classified" ("Don't
look at us that way — in 1967-68
there were 1600 things to do and
only 16 were things we can't talk
about."), that Lyman and Prof.
William Baxter's new report on
research at Stanford shows that
"Defense" projects provided
more money ($17,839,300) than
any other agency.
The contradiction between
working to uphold the values of
a University which actively sup
ports wars against the people
and being a friend to anyone

who opposes those wars with ac
tion and not just words — tha.
contradiction has placed these
men in a contradictory position.
New Committee*
Since the sit-in of last spring,
the University has moved as
only powerful bodies can move
to "correct" the situation. New
rules have been set. Many co./i
-mittees have been formed. One
is to study SRI and its relation
to the University. There will be
plenty of time for "the deliber
ative bodies of the University"
to act in "the spirit of rational
discussion and the critical ex
amination of issues, without
which a University cannot func
tion" (wording from statement
condemning campus coercion).
Still another committee will
"advise and counsel" about po
tential demonstrations on the
campus. One of the members is
Dean Rambo, who in the spring
of 1966 had the only secret CIA
contract that the Stanford Com
mittee for Peace in Vietnam
could find out about. That is,
we found that it existed; of
course, its nature remained sec
ret, contrary to the "spirit of
rational discussion and the criti
cal examination of issues" and
all those "deliberative" values.
So let us not get lost in the
haze of protesting the presence
of off-campus police on campus.
The Palo Alto police are minor
compared to what is already on
campus. Let's ask instead that
those 270 professors who signed
the statement condemning cam
pus coercion speak out now
against the coercive tactics that
are depriving this and all other
American communities of the
right to live as free human be
ings, of the right to refuse to be
coerced into supporting those
parts of the University which
actively work for the overthrow
or prevention of people's govern
ments and actively contribute to
the consequent starvation and
murder of our brothers and sis
ters. Let those who are truly
human, that is, humane, make
the choice, for let's face it, the
middle ground is slipping away.
Try to understand this at any
rate: "If violence began this very
evening and if exploitation and
oppression had never existed on
the earth, perhaps the slogans
of non-violence might end the
quarrel. But if the whole regime,
even your non-violent ideas, are
conditioned by a thousand-year
old oppression, your passivity
serves only to place you in the
ranks of the oppressors."

Wretched of the Earth
" 'I weep for you,' the Walrus

Bay Area newspapers report a
flurry of anger and concern from
Stanford because Palo Alto po

lice came on the campus to ar

Provost and Dean of Students
Joel Smith and Associate Dean
of Students William Wyman are

arrests were made without con

Wooden Leg
Meanwhile the current issue

of Life features page after page
of the heroic struggle of a Viet
namese child. This little girl
dared to pick wild vegetables in
a "free fire zone." A U.S. heli
copter's gunman shot half her
leg off. But the story has a hap
py ending. The U.S. soldiers
landed and, finding that she was
not a dirty commie, gently took
hor aboard.
Now she has been fitted with a
wooden leg and is bravely learn
ing to use it. One picture shows
her with some second-grade
classmates. She has had to move
so often (her original village was
completely destroyed by U.S.
fire power because the U.S. was
saving it from the Viet Cong)

that she is now five years older
than most of her classmates. She
is one of Vietnam's "refugees."
These "refugees" flee the dirty
commies at the gunpoint of clean
marines, who raze their villages
and herd the people into "stra
tegic hamlets," where they live
under the power that comes out
of the barrel of U.S. guns. Now
you may think I'm straying off
course — like some of our bomb
ers — by leaping from orderly
Stanford to war-torn Vietnam;
so I'll complete the circle, zero
ing in to the core of academia,
to "pure" research, objective an
alysis — where people are an
alyzed as if they were objects.
For another name for the stra
tegic hamlet plan is the Staley
Plan. Dr. Eugent Staley is in

Stanford. He is a nice, even
thoughtful, man. But he went to

among those deploring that such
arrests were made without con
sultation with the proper uni
versity officials.
Provost Richard Lyman and
Acting President Robert Glaser
discussed proper procedures with
the proper Palo Alto official, City
Manager George Morgan. Down
the hierarchy a bit Student Body
President Denis Hayes met with
Palo Alto Police Chief William
Hydie.
Wooden Leg
Meanwhile the current issue

of Life features page after page
of the heroic struggle of a Viet
namese child. This little girl
dared to pick wild vegetables in
a "free fire zone." A U.S. heli
copter's gunman shot half her
leg off. But the story has a hap
py ending. The U.S. soldiers
landed and, finding that she was
not a dirty commie, gently took
hor aboard.
Now she has been fitted with a
wooden leg and is bravely learn
ing to use it. One picture shows
her with some second-grade
classmates. She has had to move
so often (her original village was
completely destroyed by U.S.
fire power because the U.S. was
saving it from the Viet Cong)

that she is now five years older
than most of her classmates. She
is one of Vietnam's "refugees."
These "refugees" flee the dirty
commies at the gunpoint of clean
marines, who raze their villages
and herd the people into "stra
tegic hamlets," where they live
under the power that comes out
of the barrel of U.S. guns. Now
you may think I'm straying off
course — like some of our bomb
ers — by leaping from orderly
Stanford to war-torn Vietnam;
so I'll complete the circle, zero
ing in to the core of academia,
to "pure" research, objective an
alysis — where people are an
alyzed as if they were objects.
For another name for the stra
tegic hamlet plan is the Staley
Plan. Dr. Eugent Staley is in
the education department at
Stanford. He is a nice, even
thoughtful, man. But he went to
Saigon for a few weeks in 1961
and returned with a military pro
posal for handling South Viet
namese civilians.
CIA PROTEST
Last fall students, faculty, and
— beware — people from the
surrounding communities dem
onstrated against the Universi
ty's offering its facilities for the
use of the CIA, which all of us
by now, must know is actively
using "coercive tactics" against
most of the world's people. Joel
Smith and Bill Wyman played
key roles in the persecution of
seven of those demonstrators.
The seven were chosen from the
many because Bill Wyman,
whom some of them had con
sidered a friend, knew them and
knew they were activists.
None of these administrators
with his own hands would de
foliate anyone's food crops, caus
ing, as the most immediate re
sult, the starvation of infants;
yet they work hand in glove with
nine of the directors of SRI
(trustees of the University)
where research for developing
defoliants is carried out. Surely
none of them would shoot at a
child like the little girl in the
"free fire zone;" yet the latest
"Stanford Observer" says, under
the headline "Only 16 of 1600
projects are Classified" ("Don't
look at us that way — in 1967-68
there were 1600 things to do and
only 16 were things we can't talk
about."), that Lyman and Prof.
William Baxter's new report on
research at Stanford shows that
"Defense" projects provided
more money ($17,839,300) than
any other agency.
The contradiction between
working to uphold the values of
a University which actively sup
ports wars against the people
and being a friend to anyone

who opposes those wars with ac
tion and not just words — tha.
contradiction has placed these
men in a contradictory position.
New Committee*
Since the sit-in of last spring,
the University has moved as
only powerful bodies can move
to "correct" the situation. New
rules have been set. Many co./i
-mittees have been formed. One
is to study SRI and its relation
to the University. There will be
plenty of time for "the deliber
ative bodies of the University"
to act in "the spirit of rational
discussion and the critical ex
amination of issues, without
which a University cannot func
tion" (wording from statement
condemning campus coercion).
Still another committee will
"advise and counsel" about po
tential demonstrations on the
campus. One of the members is
Dean Rambo, who in the spring
of 1966 had the only secret CIA
contract that the Stanford Com
mittee for Peace in Vietnam
could find out about. That is,
we found that it existed; of
course, its nature remained sec
ret, contrary to the "spirit of
rational discussion and the criti
cal examination of issues" and
all those "deliberative" values.
So let us not get lost in the
haze of protesting the presence
of off-campus police on campus.
The Palo Alto police are minor
compared to what is already on
campus. Let's ask instead that
those 270 professors who signed
the statement condemning cam
pus coercion speak out now
against the coercive tactics that
are depriving this and all other
American communities of the
right to live as free human be
ings, of the right to refuse to be
coerced into supporting those
parts of the University which
actively work for the overthrow
or prevention of people's govern
ments and actively contribute to
the consequent starvation and
murder of our brothers and sis
ters. Let those who are truly
human, that is, humane, make
the choice, for let's face it, the
middle ground is slipping away.
Try to understand this at any
rate: "If violence began this very
evening and if exploitation and
oppression had never existed on
the earth, perhaps the slogans
of non-violence might end the
quarrel. But if the whole regime,
even your non-violent ideas, are
conditioned by a thousand-year
old oppression, your passivity
serves only to place you in the
ranks of the oppressors."
