# It's No Joke
## 
### DICK GREGORY 
By the faintest whimper of
popular mandate, Richard Nix
on has become the President
elect. He made no play for the
support of the black electorate
nor did the black ballots cast ap
preciably increase Nixon's total.
Yet a different attitude in the
black community could have
produced a Nixon defeat.
Figures compiled by the Dem
ocratic National Committee in
dicate that some 6 million black
voters went to the polls on elec
tion day, out of the potential
7.2 million. About 91 per cent of
those voters cast their ballots
for Vice-President Humphrey,
the remaining votes going to
Nixon or "other" candidates.
It is clear that the total black
electorate did not panic when
faced with the possibility of a
Nixon administration. Such pan
ic would have produced an even
larger black presence at the
polls and a greater percentage
for Mr. Humphrey. That is, if
the black votes cast for indepen
dent candidates were combined
with a larger voting percentage
in the black community, the
Humphrey-Muskie ticket would

now be looking forward to In
augaration Day. In a negative
yet very real sense, Nixon owes
his victory to the black commu
nity and the attitude it assumed.
Political Ressurection
Richard Nixon now occupies
a unique place in the history of
American political life. He is a
man who has literally had the
taste of the Presidency in his
mouth for 16 years and he has
finally won the nation's highest
political honor. To do so he had
to survive both a defeat on the
national level in 1960 and the
rejection of California voters in
his subsequent gubernatorial
bid. He has calculatedly admin
istered self-respiration to his
political image after having been
pronounced politically dead by
analysts the country over.
Nixon knew that he could not
enlist massive support from the
black community during this
year's Presidential bid. Nor
could he expect to win the fa
vor of disenchanted young
voters who originally supported
Eugene McCarthy or Bobby
Kennedy. But youth and blacks
comprise only about 25 per cent
of the total electorate and Nix

on knew his strength must
come from the remaining 75
per cent.
Nixon also knows that it will
be a different ball game in 1972.
And it is also safe to assume
that he will not be privately con
tent with a one-term Presiden
cy. The Republican Party now
ranks third in commanding the
allegience of registered voters
in this country, trailing the
Democratic Party and regis
tered independents with a total
registration of about 24 per cent.
But by the 1972 elections, mil
lions of new voters will have
been registered from the black
community and from the ranks
of youth, bclh black and white.
It is safe to assume that in
creasingly alienated youth will
not be registering into either of
the two major parties. Thus
Nixon will face that election year
(barring the unleashing of un
predictable circumstances which
have become increasingly com
monplace in this country) as the
incumbent President of a part
representing less than 20 per
cent of the total electorate. He
will need the support of both
blacks and youth.

Nixon must begin immediate
ly to do what Vice-President
Humphrey urged upon the
voters in his own behalf during
the campaign—establish a cli
mate of trust in this country.
But trust dare not be requested
until grounds for it have been
demonstrated. Nixon can be the
first man in American history
to show that young voters and
black voters will support the
Republican party when it is war
ranted. If Nixon establishes a
trust fund of concrete action in
the next 2 years, he has every
reason to expect returns on his
investment for the Republican
Party in the Congressional elec
tions of 1970.
In my telegram of concession
to Mr. Nixon, sent in the wee
small-hours of post-election
morn, I urged him to act imme
diately to establish a climate of
trust. The partial contents of
that telegram follow:
Human Dignity
"Your leadership in the next
four years will determine if our
government will regard injus
tice at home to be as dangerous

as Communism abroad. If the
power of your high office is used
to set moral standards in which
a citizen's right to human dig
nity is enforced as strictly as the
collection of income tax then
American democracy will set an
example for the world to fol
low.
"The millions of people emer
ging from colonialism in Africa
and Asia are watching not only
the struggle of black people,
Mexican-Americans and Puerto
Ricans to obtain their fair share
of America's future but particu

dian brothers who are the in
digenous heirs of the territory
we now claim as the United
States of America.
"I urge you to undertake as
your first order of business the
restoration of rights granted un

freedom we undertook wars
abroad to free native popula

It is clear that the total black
electorate did not panic when
faced with the possibility of a
Nixon administration. Such pan
ic would have produced an even
larger black presence at the
polls and a greater percentage
for Mr. Humphrey. That is, if
the black votes cast for indepen
dent candidates were combined
with a larger voting percentage
in the black community, the
Humphrey-Muskie ticket would

now be looking forward to In
augaration Day. In a negative
yet very real sense, Nixon owes
his victory to the black commu
nity and the attitude it assumed.
Political Ressurection
Richard Nixon now occupies
a unique place in the history of
American political life. He is a
man who has literally had the
taste of the Presidency in his
mouth for 16 years and he has
finally won the nation's highest
political honor. To do so he had
to survive both a defeat on the
national level in 1960 and the
rejection of California voters in
his subsequent gubernatorial
bid. He has calculatedly admin
istered self-respiration to his
political image after having been
pronounced politically dead by
analysts the country over.
Nixon knew that he could not
enlist massive support from the
black community during this
year's Presidential bid. Nor
could he expect to win the fa
vor of disenchanted young
voters who originally supported
Eugene McCarthy or Bobby
Kennedy. But youth and blacks
comprise only about 25 per cent
of the total electorate and Nix

on knew his strength must
come from the remaining 75
per cent.
Nixon also knows that it will
be a different ball game in 1972.
And it is also safe to assume
that he will not be privately con
tent with a one-term Presiden
cy. The Republican Party now
ranks third in commanding the
allegience of registered voters
in this country, trailing the
Democratic Party and regis
tered independents with a total
registration of about 24 per cent.
But by the 1972 elections, mil
lions of new voters will have
been registered from the black
community and from the ranks
of youth, bclh black and white.
It is safe to assume that in
creasingly alienated youth will
not be registering into either of
the two major parties. Thus
Nixon will face that election year
(barring the unleashing of un
predictable circumstances which
have become increasingly com
monplace in this country) as the
incumbent President of a part
representing less than 20 per
cent of the total electorate. He
will need the support of both
blacks and youth.

Nixon must begin immediate
ly to do what Vice-President
Humphrey urged upon the
voters in his own behalf during
the campaign—establish a cli
mate of trust in this country.
But trust dare not be requested
until grounds for it have been
demonstrated. Nixon can be the
first man in American history
to show that young voters and
black voters will support the
Republican party when it is war
ranted. If Nixon establishes a
trust fund of concrete action in
the next 2 years, he has every
reason to expect returns on his
investment for the Republican
Party in the Congressional elec
tions of 1970.
In my telegram of concession
to Mr. Nixon, sent in the wee
small-hours of post-election
morn, I urged him to act imme
diately to establish a climate of
trust. The partial contents of
that telegram follow:
Human Dignity
"Your leadership in the next
four years will determine if our
government will regard injus
tice at home to be as dangerous

as Communism abroad. If the
power of your high office is used
to set moral standards in which
a citizen's right to human dig
nity is enforced as strictly as the
collection of income tax then
American democracy will set an
example for the world to fol

"The millions of people emer

black community could have
produced a Nixon defeat.

ocratic National Committee in

voters went to the polls on elec

American political life. He is a
man who has literally had the
taste of the Presidency in his
mouth for 16 years and he has
finally won the nation's highest
political honor. To do so he had
to survive both a defeat on the
national level in 1960 and the
rejection of California voters in
his subsequent gubernatorial
bid. He has calculatedly admin
istered self-respiration to his
political image after having been
pronounced politically dead by
analysts the country over.
Nixon knew that he could not
enlist massive support from the
black community during this
year's Presidential bid. Nor
could he expect to win the fa
vor of disenchanted young
voters who originally supported
Eugene McCarthy or Bobby
Kennedy. But youth and blacks
comprise only about 25 per cent
of the total electorate and Nix

on knew his strength must
come from the remaining 75
per cent.
Nixon also knows that it will
be a different ball game in 1972.
And it is also safe to assume
that he will not be privately con
tent with a one-term Presiden
cy. The Republican Party now
ranks third in commanding the
allegience of registered voters
in this country, trailing the
Democratic Party and regis
tered independents with a total
registration of about 24 per cent.
But by the 1972 elections, mil
lions of new voters will have
been registered from the black
community and from the ranks
of youth, bclh black and white.
It is safe to assume that in
creasingly alienated youth will
not be registering into either of
the two major parties. Thus
Nixon will face that election year
(barring the unleashing of un
predictable circumstances which
have become increasingly com
monplace in this country) as the
incumbent President of a part
representing less than 20 per
cent of the total electorate. He
will need the support of both
blacks and youth.

Nixon must begin immediate
ly to do what Vice-President
Humphrey urged upon the
voters in his own behalf during
the campaign—establish a cli
mate of trust in this country.
But trust dare not be requested
until grounds for it have been
demonstrated. Nixon can be the
first man in American history
to show that young voters and
black voters will support the
Republican party when it is war
ranted. If Nixon establishes a
trust fund of concrete action in
the next 2 years, he has every
reason to expect returns on his
investment for the Republican
Party in the Congressional elec
tions of 1970.
In my telegram of concession
to Mr. Nixon, sent in the wee
small-hours of post-election
morn, I urged him to act imme
diately to establish a climate of
trust. The partial contents of
that telegram follow:
Human Dignity
"Your leadership in the next
four years will determine if our
government will regard injus
tice at home to be as dangerous

as Communism abroad. If the
power of your high office is used
to set moral standards in which
a citizen's right to human dig
nity is enforced as strictly as the
collection of income tax then
American democracy will set an
example for the world to fol
low.
"The millions of people emer
ging from colonialism in Africa
and Asia are watching not only
the struggle of black people,
Mexican-Americans and Puerto
Ricans to obtain their fair share
of America's future but particu
larly the treatment of our In
dian brothers who are the in
digenous heirs of the territory
we now claim as the United
States of America.
"I urge you to undertake as
your first order of business the
restoration of rights granted un
der the original treaties to na
tive Americans who have been
denied their freedom for genera
tions while in the name of that
freedom we undertook wars
abroad to free native popula
tions from the oppression of
Communism."
By the faintest whimper of
popular mandate, Richard Nix
on has become the President
elect. He made no play for the
support of the black electorate
nor did the black ballots cast ap
preciably increase Nixon's total.
Yet a different attitude in the
black community could have
produced a Nixon defeat.
Figures compiled by the Dem
ocratic National Committee in
dicate that some 6 million black
voters went to the polls on elec
tion day, out of the potential
7.2 million. About 91 per cent of
those voters cast their ballots
for Vice-President Humphrey,
the remaining votes going to
Nixon or "other" candidates.
It is clear that the total black
electorate did not panic when
faced with the possibility of a
Nixon administration. Such pan
ic would have produced an even
larger black presence at the
polls and a greater percentage
for Mr. Humphrey. That is, if
the black votes cast for indepen
dent candidates were combined
with a larger voting percentage
in the black community, the
Humphrey-Muskie ticket would

now be looking forward to In
augaration Day. In a negative
yet very real sense, Nixon owes
his victory to the black commu
nity and the attitude it assumed.
