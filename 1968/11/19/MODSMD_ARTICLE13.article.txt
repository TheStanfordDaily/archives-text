# Gripes And Grapes
## 
### RAY WHITE 
As I was a-jogging, a-jogging
one day,
I passed a fair market, well
known as Safeway;
Around it was gathered a
middle-sized crowd,
Not very quiet and not
very loud.
Well, I ceased my ambulatory
exercise to see who was hurt and
bleeding. Strolling up to the
edge of the obviously collegiate
group, I found them centered
around a clearing in the parking
lot. In the center of the clearing
a small, bruised bunch of grapes
let its watery gaze weave to and
fro across the faces of the sur
rounding people.
The apparent leader of the
group (whom I later learned was
Hairy Sapp, local wheel in the
Association for systematic Sub
version) seemed to be exhorting
the horticultured grapes: "Your
existence and continued sale per
petuate an evil system which
must end. You are an instrument
in the capitalist oppression of the
working classes. Would that you
had withered on the vine for the
crimes in which you participate!
How dare you show your skins
in the market place?" he shouted.
Looking a little frightened, but
remembering that the grape
juice of Alexander and Moby rein
in his tracheids, the bunch at
tempted to reply: "No, no, you
have it wrong. I was picked by
a happy, reasonably paid work
er with clean hands and no union
dues to pay."
"Not a union member," de
nounced Hairy (himself a found
ing member of several unions
and a pretender to the 8.5. U.),
"that proves he was dirty! Who
ever heard of a clean scab, or
even a happy one? As a dyed
in-the-wool knit-picker I'd love
to get my fingernails under
him."
A gaunt woman intoned sol
emnly: "Ye must render unto
the Union the Union's due, and
worship the Union Head above
the Family Head and yea, even
above the Head of State."
The grapes, flushed slightly in
reverence said, "If you were
closer to the situation you'd un
derstand what is going on bet
ter."
"Even if I still lived in New

York City I'd be close enough to
know that non-Union grapes are
inherently evil!" screamed a
pale, plump woman in her late
twenties, wrathfully.
"But don't you see," pleaded
the grapes, "the grape pickers
came before the union, at this
point live better without the un
ion, and may outlast the union?"
"Heresy against the Dogma!"
the woman shouted, "For the
Union precedes all, is all, and
has staying power beyond all."
"Not Sexual Union," whispered
her friend.
Somehow I became distracted
at this point and involved in a
conversation with a (unionized)
grocery clerk who was directing
traffic around the crowd. I asked
him how the grapes had gotten
out of their stall in the store.
He said, "Well, we had to do
something. These people seemed
to have some gripes and they
converged on the store and tried
to exchange them for grapes.
They said they would only take
grapes, nothing else. We even
offered them a couple of rotten
apples and a bad egg, but they
wouldn't be pacified, so we had
to give in."
Approaching the ruined grapes
I discovered an uncrushed one
cringing next to the curb. I
asked him how he thought this
would affect future generations
of grapes.
He plucked at his peeling skin
and replied, "Raisin' a grape is
a tough bag. I guess this shows
we'll all have to bunch together
or get stomped."
