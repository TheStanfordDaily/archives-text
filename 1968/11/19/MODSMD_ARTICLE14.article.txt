Editor, The Daily:
In reply to L. F. McGhie's let
ter: Perhaps Mr. McGhie wishes
teaching assistants to make oth
er aspects of their lives corre
spond to their part-time teaching
salary; for example, TA's should
eat only part-time (half their
customary meals), pay rent part
time (six months per year),
buy only half as much auto in
surance and give their children
only half the food and clothing
they would on full-time salary.
Further, the "poverty level"
salary — $2300 in some depart
ments — for most teaching as
sistants is the only income they
earn in a year. TA's are not per
mitted outside employment with
out first clearing it with the
University; most TA's do not
want it, since it would further
cut into the study time taken up
by teaching duties and thus fur
ther impede progress to the de
gree. For the same reason, most
TA's study through the summer,
rather than take gainful em
ployment, in order to "catch up"
on the course time and indepen
dent study time lost in the aca
demic year through teaching.
For Mr. McGhie's information,

the Graduate Division here puts
a great deal of emphasis on earn
ing the Ph.D. degree in four
years, and makes it clear that
hangers-on are not too wel
come.
