# Soto Replies To The Daily
## 
### 
I would like to correct a ser
ious misstatement in yesterday's
front-page Daily article on Soto
House. The article quoted me as
saying that, "it is the thing to
do in a group here (in Soto)
to get stoned, rather than to get
smashed on beer, as in a fra
ternity." In fact, I never made
this statement.
On the- contrary, I went out
of my way to urge upon the
reporter that pot-smoking is no
greater in Soto than in any
other co-ed residence. I had the
distinct impression throughout
this phase of the interview that
the reporter was trying to
squeeze out of the conversation
some kind of sensationalistic
expose on pot-smoking in Soto.
Unable to elicit the desired
response from me on this ques
tion, the reporter then asked me
to speculate on whether I
thought marijuana usage was
greater in co-ed dorms than else
where on campus in an explicit
ly hypothetical manner, I thon
surmised that pot-smoking was
probably slightly higher in a
co-ed dorm than, for example,
in Arroyo (all freshmen
women).

But clearly, the above state
ment is not tantamount to say
ing that pot-smoking "is the
thing to do in a group . . in
Soto.
