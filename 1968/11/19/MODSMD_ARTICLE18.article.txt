# A 						Funny Thing...
## 'Something For Everybody' 
### 
Something for everybody will
be found in this year's big game
show, "A Funny Thing Hap
pened on the Way to the For
um" according to director Rob
ert P. Walter.
Inspired by a "pile of comic
books", Jim Walsh, who builds
ferris wheels in his spare time,
has designed a colorful set
which will receive the lighting
efforts of Michael Watson. Wat
son offers instructions on cur
ing ulcers and growing mous
taches. Richard Banigan, the

costume designer, splits his time
between flying airplanes and
writing hard-core pornography.
For those with a weak heart,
Robert S. Hoffman, the musical
director, is also a medical stu
dent. Hoffman received a degree
from Harvard in psychology and
how he came to be a musician
is a mystery.
Director Walter is a veteran
of 53 productions and has the
needle marks in his arm to
prove it. His nerves have been
further shattered by acting in a
like number of plays. He claims
his first mistake was founding
and becoming executive director

of Theatre Mobius of Chicago, a
coffeehouse theatre center and
touring group. He will attempt a
complete nervous breakdown in
March when he directs the first
non-professional production of
Paul Foster's "Tom Paine" here
at Stanford.
"A Funny Thing Happened on
The Way to the Forum" opens
tonight, and runs through Fri
day in Memorial Auditorium.
Tickets are available through
the Tresidder Box Office and at
the door. Curtain time is 8:30
and the cast and crew collapses
nightly two and one-half hours
later.
