## 'Radiant' Opera 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
Staging a truly grand opera
tastefully and entrancingly is a
near-impossible, thankless task
in this cynical, streamlined age,
yet the San Francisco Opera has
succeeded with a radiant, co
hesive Turandot.
Turandot is Puccini's answer
to Aida. The locale, the Imperial
Court of China, calls for a huge
chorus, many supernumeraries,
elaborate costumes and Wall-of-
China sets. The San Francisco
production meets these demands
with eye-boggling flair.
Puccini's thick, stately orches
tration infuses this story of the
frigid (please, not in the Freud
ian sense) virgin Princess Tur
andot and the three riddles her
suitors must answer (or be de
capitated for their failure — 13
losers in one year!). Puccini's
music (he relies heavily upon the
pentatonic scale) wonderfully
captures the exoticism and bar
barian savagery of this oriental
tale.
Although the principals—Amy
Shuard as Turandot and Ludo
vic Spiess as her successful sui
tor Prince Calaf — sang well, the
hero of the evening was the

chorus, which assumes almost
classical Greek importance in
Turandot. Its power, richness
and sharp attack are the high
est compliment to the Opera's
new chorusmaster, Aldo Dani
eli. We can only be thankful for
the much - belated recognition
that a first-rate opera company
cannot survive with a second
rate chorus.
A Promising Career
Both Shuard and Spiess relied
upon immense vocal resources,
floating their high tessitura over
the large chorus and orchestra.
Spiess, a momanian tenor mak
ing his debut in this country,
clearly has a promising career
ahead of him. He has, thank God.
resisted the temptation to be
come a tenor stentore; his shin
ing, power-house voice is cleanly
and smartly produced.
The roles of Timur (Calafs
father) and Liu (a slave-girl ap
pendage to the plot) were ably
sung by Ara Berberian and Jane
Marsh. Ingvar Wixell (Ping),
Raymond Manton (Pang), and
Alan Crofoot (Pong) made a
winsomely effusive threesome of
palace advisers, prattling effort
lessly through their clever stage
business. Conductor Giuseppe
Patane compounded his success
earlier in the season with Lucia
di Lamniermoor.

Staging a truly grand opera
tastefully and entrancingly is a
near-impossible, thankless task
in this cynical, streamlined age,
yet the San Francisco Opera has
succeeded with a radiant, co
hesive Turandot.
Turandot is Puccini's answer
to Aida. The locale, the Imperial
Court of China, calls for a huge
chorus, many supernumeraries,
elaborate costumes and Wall-of-
China sets. The San Francisco
production meets these demands
with eye-boggling flair.
Puccini's thick, stately orches
tration infuses this story of the
frigid (please, not in the Freud
ian sense) virgin Princess Tur
andot and the three riddles her
suitors must answer (or be de
capitated for their failure — 13
losers in one year!). Puccini's
music (he relies heavily upon the
pentatonic scale) wonderfully
captures the exoticism and bar
barian savagery of this oriental
tale.
Although the principals—Amy
Shuard as Turandot and Ludo
