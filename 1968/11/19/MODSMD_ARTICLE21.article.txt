# Tribe Booters Rout Hapless Menlo, 8-1
## SPORTS 
### 
The Stanford soccer team ex
ploded with an eight-goal out
burst to down Menlo College 8-1
Saturday afternoon.
The contest was dominated
throughout by Stanford's reju
vinated forward line. Right wing
Chip Jessup, the Tribe's most
consistent scorer all season,
paced the Indian effort with
three goals. Sophomore Mark
Smith booted home a pair, and
single goals were tallied by Ben
White, Gary Cook, and Pete
Moock.
The victory marked the sec
ond win in three games for the
resurgent Indians, who got off
to an incredibly slow start this
year.
Some of the credit for the In
dians' recent success should be
given to coaches Priddle and
Rickard, whose successful jug
gling of the line-up has pro
duced an offense that has aver

aged seven goals a game and a
defense that has permitted only
three goals per game.
But the primary reason for
the Tribe's improvement has
been the development of inex
perienced players like sopho
mores Smith and White, and
juniors Cook and Jessup.
Coach Priddle is optimistic
about the team's chances in their
remaining three encounters. To
morrow afternoon the booters
face Merrit Jr. College, and Sat
urday they oppose St. Mary's
College in a 10:00 contest.
The season closes November
30 with a game against the Cor
inthians, a rugged amateur
team.
