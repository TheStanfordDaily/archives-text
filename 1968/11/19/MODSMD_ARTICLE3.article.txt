# Curriculum Study Launched In 1954
## 
### ALAN GLAROS 
In a memo dated October 1,
1954, J. Wallace Sterling, then
President of Stanford, informed
the faculty of the creation of the
Stanford Study of Undergradu
ate Education. It was this study
which established the General
Studies program.
The General Studies program
is still with us, much attacked
and little defended. The current
Study of Education at Stanford
is examining the precepts of the
General Studies program. It
might be well for us to examine
the study that set up the Gen
eral Studies program.
According to Dr. Friedrich W.
Strothmann, executive head of
the German department, the
Study was set up because "the
Lower Division requirements
were unsatisfactory." The Low
er Division was established
"sometime around 1918," said
Strothmann, and was some
what like the present General
Studies program but concen
trated into two years.
When the study got under way
late in 1954, the Executive Com
mittee of the study, chaired by
President Sterling, formulated
three broad sets of questions to
defiine the scope of the Study:
• What can be done to in
crease the effectiveness of un
dergraduate teaching?
• What steps can be taken
to improve the intellectual mo
tivation of Stanford undergrad
uates?
• What changes in curricula
are needed?
Embarrassing Findings
To help gain some idea of the
academic abilities of entering
freshman, the Study had the
Educational Testing Service
(who administer the Scholastic
Aptitude Tests and Achieve
ments Tests) give the English
Composition test and two other
achievement tests to all fresh
men in the fall of 1955. The
Study was somewhat embar
rassed and dismayed with the
findings.
When the scores of Stanford
freshmen were compared with
those from sixteen other leading
colleges and universities, the
Executive Committee discovered
that Stanford freshmen rank on
a par with freshmen from other
prestigious institutions when
aptitude test scores were com
pared. But when achievement
test scores were compared, Stan
ford freshmen scored signifi
cantly lower in all fields except
Intermediate and Advanced
Mathematics.
To help remedy this embar
rassing state of affairs, the
Study urged the adoption of a
stiffened set of admissions re
quirements.
Teaching- Neglected
But when the Study tackled
the problem of the quality of

undergraduate teaching, the
Study was again embarrassed.
According to the Stanford Sur
vey of the Behavioral Sciences,
done in 1953-54, undergraduate
teaching was neglected in favor
of research and publishing.
The new curriculum was, for
students, the most important
part of the Study. The new Gen
eral Studies program replaced
the old Lower Division require
mens. According to Dr. Robert
A. Walker, now chairman of the
General Studies committee and
former chairman of the Studies
subcommittees on curriculum,
the requirements of the new
program were "roughly"' the
same as for the old Lower Divi
sion.
Requirements
Walker stated that one of
the major changes involved in
the new program was the
spreading out of requirements
over four years instead of two,
the addition of requirements for
A.B. candidates, and the senior
soloquia. He stated that these
changes brought much more
flexibility to undergraduate edu
cation. He mentioned that in
1955, "no major changes had
been accepted by the Academic
Council in 37 years."
The new curriculum was set
up to expose the incoming stu
dent "to the major areas of
knowledge ... in order to per
mit full exploration of each stu
dent's possible interests." Ac
cording to Strohmann, the
faculty thought that the new
curriculum would provide "an
all-around education — not re
stricted to professional train
ing," although he felt there
would be "no complaint from
students for professional train
ing."
Languages Not Studied
Some of the questions of cur
riculum were thoroughly stud
ies; others were not. "The ques
tion of the value, an sich, of the
study of foreign language, or of
its proper place, philosophically,
within liberal education, was
never examined formally in the
course of the Study of Under
graduate Education. The same
can be said, for that matter,
about the study of mathemat
ics."
Yet, one of the reports of the
Study said about the language
requirement, "all arguments
against it are, in our opinion,
totally irrational. The famous
argument about 'the potential
loss of the highly gifted student
who doesn't know anything yet

at the age of 18,' when realistic
ally analyzed, dissolves like the
cat in Alice in Wonderland."
Strothmann also indicated
that the Executive Committee
was concerned about making so
many requirements. "A student
will take a course just as a re
quire m en t," said Stroth
mann, "but by making a fasci
nating experience a requirement,
will you kill it?"
Some professors involved in
the Study objected to the use
of student opinion in helping
shape the outcome of the Study.
According to them, asking stu
dents what they thought of their
education at Stanford was akin
to "asking the patient to diag
nose his own ill ne s s." Said
Walker, "We knocked ourselves
out talking to students." It may
have been that the "Silent Gene
ration" of the fifties had little to
say.

many requirements. "A student
will take a course just as a re
quire m en t," said Stroth
mann, "but by making a fasci
nating experience a requirement,
will you kill it?"
Some professors involved in
the Study objected to the use
of student opinion in helping
shape the outcome of the Study.
According to them, asking stu
dents what they thought of their
education at Stanford was akin
to "asking the patient to diag
nose his own ill ne s s." Said
Walker, "We knocked ourselves
out talking to students." It may
have been that the "Silent Gene
ration" of the fifties had little to
say.
In a memo dated October 1,
1954, J. Wallace Sterling, then
President of Stanford, informed
the faculty of the creation of the
Stanford Study of Undergradu
ate Education. It was this study
which established the General
Studies program.
The General Studies program
is still with us, much attacked
and little defended. The current
Study of Education at Stanford
is examining the precepts of the
General Studies program. It
might be well for us to examine
the study that set up the Gen
eral Studies program.
According to Dr. Friedrich W.
Strothmann, executive head of
the German department, the
Study was set up because "the
Lower Division requirements
were unsatisfactory." The Low
er Division was established
"sometime around 1918," said
Strothmann, and was some
what like the present General
Studies program but concen
trated into two years.
When the study got under way
late in 1954, the Executive Com
mittee of the study, chaired by
President Sterling, formulated
three broad sets of questions to
defiine the scope of the Study:
• What can be done to in
crease the effectiveness of un
dergraduate teaching?
• What steps can be taken
to improve the intellectual mo
tivation of Stanford undergrad
uates?
• What changes in curricula
are needed?
Embarrassing Findings
To help gain some idea of the
academic abilities of entering
freshman, the Study had the
Educational Testing Service
(who administer the Scholastic
Aptitude Tests and Achieve
ments Tests) give the English
Composition test and two other
achievement tests to all fresh
men in the fall of 1955. The
Study was somewhat embar
rassed and dismayed with the
findings.
When the scores of Stanford
freshmen were compared with
those from sixteen other leading
colleges and universities, the
Executive Committee discovered
that Stanford freshmen rank on
a par with freshmen from other
prestigious institutions when
aptitude test scores were com
pared. But when achievement
test scores were compared, Stan
ford freshmen scored signifi
cantly lower in all fields except
Intermediate and Advanced
Mathematics.
To help remedy this embar
rassing state of affairs, the
Study urged the adoption of a
stiffened set of admissions re
quirements.
Teaching- Neglected
But when the Study tackled
the problem of the quality of

undergraduate teaching, the
Study was again embarrassed.
According to the Stanford Sur
vey of the Behavioral Sciences,
done in 1953-54, undergraduate
teaching was neglected in favor
of research and publishing.
The new curriculum was, for
students, the most important
part of the Study. The new Gen
eral Studies program replaced
the old Lower Division require
mens. According to Dr. Robert
A. Walker, now chairman of the
General Studies committee and
former chairman of the Studies
subcommittees on curriculum,
the requirements of the new
program were "roughly"' the
same as for the old Lower Divi
sion.
Requirements
Walker stated that one of
the major changes involved in
the new program was the
spreading out of requirements
over four years instead of two,
the addition of requirements for
A.B. candidates, and the senior
soloquia. He stated that these
changes brought much more
flexibility to undergraduate edu
cation. He mentioned that in
1955, "no major changes had
been accepted by the Academic
Council in 37 years."
The new curriculum was set
up to expose the incoming stu
dent "to the major areas of
knowledge ... in order to per
mit full exploration of each stu
dent's possible interests." Ac
cording to Strohmann, the
faculty thought that the new
curriculum would provide "an
all-around education — not re
stricted to professional train
ing," although he felt there
would be "no complaint from
students for professional train
ing."
Languages Not Studied
Some of the questions of cur
riculum were thoroughly stud
ies; others were not. "The ques
tion of the value, an sich, of the
study of foreign language, or of
its proper place, philosophically,
within liberal education, was
never examined formally in the
course of the Study of Under
graduate Education. The same
can be said, for that matter,
about the study of mathemat
ics."
Yet, one of the reports of the
Study said about the language
requirement, "all arguments
against it are, in our opinion,
totally irrational. The famous
argument about 'the potential
loss of the highly gifted student
who doesn't know anything yet

at the age of 18,' when realistic
ally analyzed, dissolves like the
cat in Alice in Wonderland."
Strothmann also indicated

never examined formally in the
course of the Study of Under
graduate Education. The same
can be said, for that matter,
about the study of mathemat
ics."
Yet, one of the reports of the
Study said about the language
requirement, "all arguments
against it are, in our opinion,
totally irrational. The famous
argument about 'the potential
loss of the highly gifted student
who doesn't know anything yet

at the age of 18,' when realistic
ally analyzed, dissolves like the
cat in Alice in Wonderland."
Strothmann also indicated
that the Executive Committee
was concerned about making so
many requirements. "A student
will take a course just as a re
quire m en t," said Stroth
mann, "but by making a fasci
nating experience a requirement,
will you kill it?"
Some professors involved in
the Study objected to the use
of student opinion in helping
shape the outcome of the Study.
According to them, asking stu
dents what they thought of their
education at Stanford was akin
to "asking the patient to diag
nose his own ill ne s s." Said
Walker, "We knocked ourselves
out talking to students." It may
have been that the "Silent Gene
ration" of the fifties had little to
say.
In a memo dated October 1,
1954, J. Wallace Sterling, then
President of Stanford, informed
the faculty of the creation of the
Stanford Study of Undergradu
ate Education. It was this study
which established the General
Studies program.
The General Studies program
is still with us, much attacked
and little defended. The current
Study of Education at Stanford
is examining the precepts of the
General Studies program. It
might be well for us to examine
the study that set up the Gen
eral Studies program.
According to Dr. Friedrich W.
Strothmann, executive head of
the German department, the
Study was set up because "the
Lower Division requirements
were unsatisfactory." The Low
er Division was established
"sometime around 1918," said
Strothmann, and was some
what like the present General
Studies program but concen
trated into two years.
When the study got under way
late in 1954, the Executive Com
mittee of the study, chaired by
President Sterling, formulated
three broad sets of questions to
defiine the scope of the Study:
• What can be done to in
crease the effectiveness of un
dergraduate teaching?
• What steps can be taken
to improve the intellectual mo
tivation of Stanford undergrad
uates?
• What changes in curricula
are needed?
Embarrassing Findings
To help gain some idea of the
academic abilities of entering
freshman, the Study had the
Educational Testing Service
(who administer the Scholastic
Aptitude Tests and Achieve
ments Tests) give the English
Composition test and two other
achievement tests to all fresh
men in the fall of 1955. The
Study was somewhat embar
rassed and dismayed with the
findings.
When the scores of Stanford
freshmen were compared with
those from sixteen other leading
colleges and universities, the
Executive Committee discovered
that Stanford freshmen rank on
a par with freshmen from other
prestigious institutions when
aptitude test scores were com
pared. But when achievement
test scores were compared, Stan
ford freshmen scored signifi
cantly lower in all fields except
Intermediate and Advanced
Mathematics.
To help remedy this embar
rassing state of affairs, the
Study urged the adoption of a
stiffened set of admissions re
quirements.
Teaching- Neglected
But when the Study tackled
the problem of the quality of

undergraduate teaching, the
Study was again embarrassed.
According to the Stanford Sur
vey of the Behavioral Sciences,
done in 1953-54, undergraduate
teaching was neglected in favor
of research and publishing.
The new curriculum was, for
students, the most important
part of the Study. The new Gen
eral Studies program replaced
the old Lower Division require
mens. According to Dr. Robert
A. Walker, now chairman of the
General Studies committee and
former chairman of the Studies
subcommittees on curriculum,
the requirements of the new
program were "roughly"' the
same as for the old Lower Divi
sion.
Requirements
Walker stated that one of
the major changes involved in
the new program was the
spreading out of requirements
over four years instead of two,
the addition of requirements for
A.B. candidates, and the senior
soloquia. He stated that these
changes brought much more
flexibility to undergraduate edu
cation. He mentioned that in
1955, "no major changes had
been accepted by the Academic
Council in 37 years."
The new curriculum was set
up to expose the incoming stu
dent "to the major areas of
knowledge ... in order to per
mit full exploration of each stu
dent's possible interests." Ac
cording to Strohmann, the
faculty thought that the new
curriculum would provide "an
all-around education — not re
stricted to professional train
ing," although he felt there
would be "no complaint from
students for professional train
ing."
Languages Not Studied
Some of the questions of cur
riculum were thoroughly stud
ies; others were not. "The ques
tion of the value, an sich, of the
study of foreign language, or of
its proper place, philosophically,
within liberal education, was
never examined formally in the
course of the Study of Under
graduate Education. The same
can be said, for that matter,
about the study of mathemat
ics."
