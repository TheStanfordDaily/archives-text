## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” State
college trustees ordered embat
tled San Francisco State college
opened "immediately" after an
all day session Monday at which
tenure of the school's president
reportedly was discussed.
The trustees made it clear,
however, they do not expect the
college to open again until
Wednesday.
This was the date the San
Francisco president, Robert R.
Smith, had said earlier he was
aiming for.
Gov. Reagan, who attended
the session, said "yes" when
asked if he approved of the
action. Before the session he
had demanded an immediate re
opening.
Smith closed the 18,000-stu
dent campus last Wednesday be
cause of violence over demands
for more aid to Negro students
and the suspension of a Negro
militant, George Murray, as a
part-time instructor.
Bomb Explodes
Just before the trustees met
here a crude bomb, made of
black powder and various types
of shells for guns, exploded
backstage of an auditorium at
the San Francisco campus. No
one was in the vicinity.

Smith told the trustees that
there was "very little evidence
that the Black Students Union
members . . . were the people
who were using bombs and
some of the other violence."
Most of the school's students
are white.
Assemblyman John L. Burton
of San Francisco released a let
ter he said he had sent to the
governor on the reopening of
the college, closed last week in
the wake of student violence.
Burton said if Reagan would
be at the campus this morning
to take the first student to class,
"This would indicate that you
are really personally committed
to the position that the college
must be reopened today."
Dumke Support
The San F'-ancisco State Col
lege unit of California College
Republicans has called for a
"solid wa 11 of resistance"
against radical forces which it
claims are responsible for cur
rent unrest on the campus.
The unit, at a meeting Satur
day afternoon, passed resolu
tions supporting State College
Chancellor Glenn S. Dumke, con
demning Black Panther George
Murray, and reprimanding the
current student government.

Smith will deliver a "state of
the campus" address today and
classrooms will remain closed
for the fourth school day.
Smith called for a general
faculty meeting at 10 a.m. His
campus-wide message comes at
2 p.m. Both take place in the
creative arts auditorium.
