## Teachers' Strike Over In NY 
### 
NEW YORK (AP)—A teach
ers' union voted an end Monday
to the worst educational tieup in
the nation's history, a citywide
strike that kept the vast major
ity of New York's 1.1 million
public school children out of
classes for seven weeks.
The tentative agreement was
announced Sunday after nearly
27 hours of continuous negotia
tions at Gracie Mansion, Mayor
John V. Lindsay's official resi
dence.
Previous Walkouts
It marked the third time since
the strike began Sept. 9 that the
AFL-CIO United Federation of
Teachers, a predominantly white
union of 55,000 members, re
turned to classrooms. On two
previous occasions, the walkout
was renewed.
This time, however, a state
watchdog committee was desig
nated to oversee the return of

79 white teachers, whose ouster
from the Negro and Puerto Ri
can Ocean Hill-Brownsville de
centralized school district led to
the strike.
Ocean Hill-Brownsville is 71
per cent Negro, 24 per cent
Puerto Rican, 4 per cent white,
and 1 per cent Oriental.
Sympathy Strike
Several hundred teachers
walked out in sympathy with
their colleagues and the local
group refused to let any of the
teachers return to their class
rooms this fall.
The settlement provides for

the return of the disputed teach
ers-voluntary transfers and re
tirements have reduced their
number to 79—to specific class
room assignments.
Three Ocean Hill principals
were ordered removed, pending
outcome of a court test of the
validity of their original ap
pointments. Others were re
tained, conditional upon their
compliance with orders from the
trustees.
