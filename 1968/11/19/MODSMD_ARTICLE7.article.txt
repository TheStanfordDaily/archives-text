# Hunger Strike At Cal Ended
## 
### 
Konstantin Berlandt, editor-in
chief of the Daily Californian,
and Charles Palmer, president
of the Associated Students of
the University of California, end
ed their 16-day hunger strike
last Friday.
Their decision came after the
two received no response to their
demands made to the Regents of
the University of California.
"Continued fasting," they con
cluded last Thursday, "would be
to no purpose."
The two students believe, how
ever, that through press cover
age of their strike "a good num
ber of people have learned more
about the issues" that they were
trying to clarify.
"We have received support
from across the nation," they
stated last Thursday, "and the
general awareness of the prob
lem has been heightened."
The two also stated that they
had gotten no response from the
faculty on their proposals for
increased student participation
in University government, and
only limited response from the
administration.
