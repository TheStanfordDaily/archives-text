# Mexican-American Says
## 'People Don't Give A Damn' 
### CRAIG WILSON 
"We are spreading ourselves
thin. People just don't give a
damn. They should realize that
when they are helping somebody
else, they are really helping
themselves."
Sy'via Lemus of the Mexican-
American Student Federation
(MASK) spoke with exaspera
tion in her voice.
"The need to organize cannot
be overemphasized. The day has
passed where a person can be
identified as Spanish instead of
Mexican - American. There are
lots of people like that still on
campus."

Miss Lemus, speaking to The
Daily in an interview yesterday,
is one of 27 members of MASK,
a newly formed Mexican-Ameri
can organization at Stanford.
The group, which is character
ized by its chairman Luis No
gales as the beginning of what
he feels will grow into "an in
fluential pressure group", has set
two objectives: to bring more
Mexican-American (Chicanos) to
Stanford, and to bring those
Mexican-Ameicans at Stanford
into the organization to main
tain an interest and concern for
problems of Mexican-Americans.
Problems Forgotten
Noga'es said "what usually oc
curs is that people arrive here
and set themselves aside by
going on to higher education.
They tend to dissassociate and
forget problems that they used
to understand very well."
"Often times Stanford does
not help to solve problems of
the Mexican-Americans at all.
We must emphasize the need for
Mexican-American students to
identify and try to help their
people. Otherwise their wi'l be
a polarization in our society."
In a memorandum issued ear
lier in the year Nogales points
to the problem the Chicano has
in emerging from the barrio, the
Mexican ghetto.
"There are some five and one
half million Americans of Mexi

can descent or birth in the south
western United States. California
accounts for about half of this
group. Mexican-Americans out
number Blacks almost two to
one in California.
"A few statistics from census
figures and other studies show
the Mexican - American to be
worse off in every respect than
the non-whites (Blacks, Indians,
and Orientals), not to mention
the dominant "Anglos" (every
body else).
"Unemployment among Mexi
can-Americans is high, roughly
twice the rate for everybody else
except Blacks. Mexican-Ameri
cans receive less education. The
school drop-out rate is higher
than that of any other group
and very few of those who do
graduate from high school move
on to college.
Two Percent in College
"Only two percent of the four
year co'lege enrollment in Cali
fornia is Mexican - American,
while Mexican-Americans consti
tute about 12 percent of the to
tal population, and a much high
er percentage of the school age
population."
To date MASK has placed stu
dents on every committee on
campus connected with admis
sion. It is also working on a
Mexican-American lecture series
which may begin next quarter.
Nogales attributes much of
the gains which Mexican-Ameri
can students have made in the
past few years to the efforts of
the Black Student Union (BSU)
which presented a list of de
m a n d s to administrators last
year.
Since that time a substantial
increase in minority group mem
bers has occurred particularly
in the Mexican-American brac
ket.
Few Chicanos Here
Nogales says"I feel the ur
gency to keep things moving as
rapidly as possible."
But he points to the fact that
many members of the surround
ing Mexican - American com
munity are concerned over the
fact that there are few Mexican-
Americans at Stanford. "Pro
grams," he says, "seem to be
weighted toward black students."
"It should be noted that Mexi
can -Americans outnumber
Blacks 11-1 in Santa Clara Coun
ty," according to Nogales.
In an effort to seek dialogue
with administrators, Mexican -
Americans from the community
have scheduled a meeting in the
Old Union at 3:30 Thursday.
In the meantime, the student
run MASK will continue its ef
forts to "build bridges" as No
gales puts it "between the com
munity and the mainstream of
American Society."
The organization meets every
Sunday evening at 7 p.m. in Tre
sidder Memorial Union.

SWINGING SOTOâ€”This lovely Stanford dolly (who shall remain
nameless) is a resident of Soto House in the Wilhurness. Soto,
which was featured in THE DAILY yesterday, is the home of
Lawrence Pickup. Mr. Pickup's room (also shown above) is ru
mored to he the most completely furnished residence at Stanford.
It's certainly a long; way from mother.
