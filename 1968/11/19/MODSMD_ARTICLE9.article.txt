Editor, THE DAILY:
God is not dead. He lives in
Mem Chu. He lives in the words
and deeds of B. Davie Napier.
Occasionally He may be as ir
reverent to interrupt a sermon
or to remind a preacher to keep
it short; but He lives, just as
He did for Moses, Jeremiah, and
Paul (the saint, not the Pope
VI).
To take an ancient religion,
one often hamstrung by its own
traditions, and make it speak
to today requires great skill, in

sight, and motivation. Mir
aculously B. Davie Napier is
here, now.

This is silly! Obviously
Messr's. Franklin, Johnson, and
Sapir, arrested on campus for
"failure to disperse," dispersed
so fast on Tuesday night that
the Palo Alto police were un
able to apprehend them.
Let there be a trial—l'm bet
ting on the defendants.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to correct a minor
error in the November 15 issue
of The Daily. You referred to
that day as the Ides of Novem
ber, but actually the Ides of
November is November 13.
The Ides is the 15th day of
March, May, July, and October,
but it is the 13th day of all the
other months.

The November 12 Stanford
Daily quoted Mr. Glenn Camp
bell: "A small group of people
are trying to use the university
to disrupt society." Mr. Camp
bell, a large group of people are
trying to use the university to
change society. At Berkeley, the
Regents have manifested their
intention to obstruct all efforts
toward creative social thought.
I agree with Mr. Campbell
that the appearance of Eldridge

is "no free speech issue." The
issue is, in one word, power.
What individual or group has
the final authority to make en
forceable decisions concerning
the substance of courses taught
at the university? The denial of
credit for 139 X clearly demon
strates that this power ultimate
ly rests with the Regents. Mr.
Reagan's proposed resolution
presented to the Regents at
their October meeting claimed
for the Regents the power to
review all courses, all faculty
appointments, and all degrees.
What possible vestige of aca
demic freedom can survive un
der such authoritarian repres
sion?
In Mr. Reagan's resolution,
the word power appears eight
times in as many sentences. Un
der this resolution, the very guts
and spirit of the university must
answer to a political establish
ment. And of course the Re
gents do have the power—the
police, the money, and the news
media. They can control the uni
versity; they can destroy it.
