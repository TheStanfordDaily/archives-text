# Union Sanctions TA Strike If Negotiations Unsuccessful
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
If Stanford doesn't move soon
toward acceptance of salary de
mands made by political science,
English, and anthropology
teaching assistant's (TA's), the
University might have a major
strike on its hands.
The Central Labor Council of
the Santa Clara County AFL
CIO Monday night gave its offi
cers the power to grant Stan
ford's local of the American
Federation of Teachers (AFT)
a strike sanction at any time.
The move was made after
Acting President Robert J.
Glaser refused to send a Uni
versity official to the Council's
regular meeting, as the group
had requested.
After granting strike sanction
to its officers, the Council also
decided to ask the University
for permission to send four rep
resentatives to a meeting be
tween the AFT local and the ad
ministration scheduled for Fri
day to discuss the salary de
mands.
Fact Gathering
But the session has since been
postponed until next week, in
order to give Stanford officials
more time to gather facts and
prepare a new salary offer for
the TAs, according to Vice-Pro
vost E. Howard Brooks. (See
accompanying story for details
of negotiations.)
A strike, sanctioned by the
AFL-CIO, would not only dis
rupt undergraduate instruction
but also might put a halt to
construction work, deliveries to
campus, and work in the Stan
ford Press—strikes by members
of other AFL-CIO unions, ser
vicing the campus.
It appears, however, that the
University, fearing a strike, is

ready partially to meet the TAs'
demands of a $700 a year salary
hike, plus an extra $300 per de
pendent.
About-Face Indicated
The school's previous offer
was an increase of $400 next
year, but no wage boost this
year. Present indications point
to an about-face on the latter
position, with a salary hike
large enough to satisfy the AFT,
but not as large as the one re
quested.
But despite the administra
tion's probable willingness to
make an acceptable offer to the
TA's, it seems very likely Coun
cil representatives will not be
allowed to attend the meeting
with the TA's next week.
The reason for this reticence
is the feeling of most Stanford
administrators that such action
would be tantamount to giving
official recognition to the AFT
local—so m e th in g they are
staunchly opposed to.
As Cassius Kirk, University
counsel said, "The administra
tion does not recognize the
group as representatives for all
TAs."
Strike Sanction Asked
The present crisis arose when
the AFT requested a strike
sanction from the Central Labor
Council. The Council then sent
a letter to Brooks, the adminis
tration's spokesman in the ne
gotiations.
The letter asked him "to ap
pear at the next regular meet
ing of the Central Labor Council
to show cause why Stanford
should not conclude negotiations
and sign a satisfactory agree
ment with the Union (the
AFT)."
Glaser replied Monday, say

ing the University "cannot ac
cept your request.
"So far as the University is
aware," he continued, "no mem
ber of your Council has any
standing, legal or otherwise, to
purport to speak or act for any
member of the Stanford aca
demic community. . .
Meetings Held
"Members of the University
administration have met with
certain of the University's grad
uate students to discuss changes
in their salaries and other con
ditions of employment. . . . We
fully expect that these problems
and any others which arise in
the future will be worked out
satisfactorily within the Uni
versity by appropriate discus
sions between the administra
tion, faculty and students."
The logic behind this state
ment is based on Stanford's in
sistence that the AFT is not a.
legitimate representative of the
school's TA's.
Even though Stanford refuses
to officially recognize the union,
the AFT is leading the negoti
ations. Apparently, enough pres
sure has been applied to force
the University to raise TA sal
aries this year.
But this is still not certain.
What would it take to prevent
the strike?
Reasonable Offer
"It would depend on the ad
ministration making some reas
onable offer this year—not just
reading off what they're going
to do," according to Ed Nelson,
graduate student in computer
science and president of the
AFT local.
Besides finding the money,
there is another problem in solv
ing the dispute, Nelson says.
"My feeling is the real hang

up is the union issue. They
don't want to negotiate with a
union. They don't want to have
anything to do with a union. If
we were the Graduate Student

Association then a lot might bo
different."
As Vice-Provost Brooks said,
dealing with a union "is not the
traditional way to run a uni
versity."

hike, plus an extra $300 per de
pendent.
About-Face Indicated
The school's previous offer
was an increase of $400 next
year, but no wage boost this
year. Present indications point
to an about-face on the latter
position, with a salary hike
large enough to satisfy the AFT,
but not as large as the one re
quested.
But despite the administra
tion's probable willingness to
make an acceptable offer to the
TA's, it seems very likely Coun
cil representatives will not be
allowed to attend the meeting
with the TA's next week.
The reason for this reticence
is the feeling of most Stanford
administrators that such action
would be tantamount to giving
official recognition to the AFT
local—so m e th in g they are
staunchly opposed to.
As Cassius Kirk, University
counsel said, "The administra
tion does not recognize the
group as representatives for all
TAs."
Strike Sanction Asked
The present crisis arose when
the AFT requested a strike
sanction from the Central Labor
Council. The Council then sent
a letter to Brooks, the adminis
tration's spokesman in the ne
gotiations.
The letter asked him "to ap
pear at the next regular meet
ing of the Central Labor Council
to show cause why Stanford
should not conclude negotiations
and sign a satisfactory agree
ment with the Union (the
AFT)."
Glaser replied Monday, say

ing the University "cannot ac
cept your request.
"So far as the University is
aware," he continued, "no mem
ber of your Council has any
standing, legal or otherwise, to
purport to speak or act for any
member of the Stanford aca
demic community. . .
Meetings Held
"Members of the University
administration have met with
certain of the University's grad
uate students to discuss changes
in their salaries and other con
ditions of employment. . . . We
fully expect that these problems
and any others which arise in
the future will be worked out
satisfactorily within the Uni
versity by appropriate discus
sions between the administra
tion, faculty and students."
The logic behind this state
ment is based on Stanford's in
sistence that the AFT is not a.
legitimate representative of the
school's TA's.
Even though Stanford refuses
to officially recognize the union,
the AFT is leading the negoti
ations. Apparently, enough pres
sure has been applied to force
the University to raise TA sal
aries this year.
But this is still not certain.
What would it take to prevent
the strike?
Reasonable Offer
"It would depend on the ad
ministration making some reas
onable offer this year—not just
reading off what they're going
to do," according to Ed Nelson,
graduate student in computer
science and president of the
AFT local.
Besides finding the money,
there is another problem in solv
ing the dispute, Nelson says.
"My feeling is the real hang

up is the union issue. They
don't want to negotiate with a
union. They don't want to have
anything to do with a union. If
we were the Graduate Student

Association then a lot might bo
different."
As Vice-Provost Brooks said,
dealing with a union "is not the
traditional way to run a uni
versity."
If Stanford doesn't move soon
toward acceptance of salary de
mands made by political science,
English, and anthropology
teaching assistant's (TA's), the
University might have a major
strike on its hands.
The Central Labor Council of
the Santa Clara County AFL
CIO Monday night gave its offi
cers the power to grant Stan
ford's local of the American
Federation of Teachers (AFT)
a strike sanction at any time.
The move was made after
Acting President Robert J.
Glaser refused to send a Uni
versity official to the Council's
regular meeting, as the group
had requested.
After granting strike sanction
to its officers, the Council also
decided to ask the University
for permission to send four rep
resentatives to a meeting be
tween the AFT local and the ad
ministration scheduled for Fri
day to discuss the salary de
mands.
Fact Gathering
But the session has since been
postponed until next week, in
order to give Stanford officials
more time to gather facts and
prepare a new salary offer for
the TAs, according to Vice-Pro
vost E. Howard Brooks. (See
accompanying story for details
of negotiations.)
A strike, sanctioned by the
AFL-CIO, would not only dis
rupt undergraduate instruction
but also might put a halt to
construction work, deliveries to
campus, and work in the Stan
ford Press—strikes by members
of other AFL-CIO unions, ser
vicing the campus.
It appears, however, that the
University, fearing a strike, is

ready partially to meet the TAs'
demands of a $700 a year salary
hike, plus an extra $300 per de
pendent.

standing, legal or otherwise, to
purport to speak or act for any
member of the Stanford aca
demic community. . .
Meetings Held
"Members of the University
administration have met with
certain of the University's grad
uate students to discuss changes
in their salaries and other con
ditions of employment. . . . We
fully expect that these problems
and any others which arise in
the future will be worked out
satisfactorily within the Uni
versity by appropriate discus
sions between the administra
tion, faculty and students."
The logic behind this state
ment is based on Stanford's in
sistence that the AFT is not a.
legitimate representative of the
school's TA's.
Even though Stanford refuses
to officially recognize the union,
the AFT is leading the negoti
ations. Apparently, enough pres
sure has been applied to force
the University to raise TA sal
aries this year.
But this is still not certain.
What would it take to prevent
the strike?
Reasonable Offer
"It would depend on the ad
ministration making some reas
onable offer this year—not just
reading off what they're going
to do," according to Ed Nelson,
graduate student in computer
science and president of the
AFT local.
Besides finding the money,
there is another problem in solv
ing the dispute, Nelson says.
"My feeling is the real hang

up is the union issue. They
don't want to negotiate with a
union. They don't want to have
anything to do with a union. If
we were the Graduate Student

Association then a lot might bo
different."
As Vice-Provost Brooks said,
dealing with a union "is not the
traditional way to run a uni
versity."
If Stanford doesn't move soon
toward acceptance of salary de
mands made by political science,
English, and anthropology
teaching assistant's (TA's), the
University might have a major
strike on its hands.
The Central Labor Council of
the Santa Clara County AFL
CIO Monday night gave its offi
cers the power to grant Stan
ford's local of the American
Federation of Teachers (AFT)
a strike sanction at any time.
The move was made after
Acting President Robert J.
Glaser refused to send a Uni
versity official to the Council's
regular meeting, as the group
had requested.
After granting strike sanction
to its officers, the Council also
decided to ask the University
for permission to send four rep
resentatives to a meeting be
tween the AFT local and the ad
ministration scheduled for Fri
day to discuss the salary de
mands.
Fact Gathering
But the session has since been
postponed until next week, in
order to give Stanford officials
more time to gather facts and
prepare a new salary offer for
the TAs, according to Vice-Pro
vost E. Howard Brooks. (See
accompanying story for details
of negotiations.)
A strike, sanctioned by the
AFL-CIO, would not only dis
rupt undergraduate instruction
but also might put a halt to
construction work, deliveries to
campus, and work in the Stan
ford Press—strikes by members
of other AFL-CIO unions, ser
vicing the campus.
It appears, however, that the
University, fearing a strike, is

ready partially to meet the TAs'
demands of a $700 a year salary
hike, plus an extra $300 per de
pendent.
About-Face Indicated
The school's previous offer
was an increase of $400 next
year, but no wage boost this
year. Present indications point
to an about-face on the latter
position, with a salary hike
large enough to satisfy the AFT,
but not as large as the one re
quested.
But despite the administra
tion's probable willingness to
make an acceptable offer to the
TA's, it seems very likely Coun
cil representatives will not be
allowed to attend the meeting
with the TA's next week.
The reason for this reticence
is the feeling of most Stanford
administrators that such action
would be tantamount to giving
official recognition to the AFT
local—so m e th in g they are
staunchly opposed to.
As Cassius Kirk, University
counsel said, "The administra
tion does not recognize the
group as representatives for all
TAs."
Strike Sanction Asked
The present crisis arose when
the AFT requested a strike
sanction from the Central Labor
Council. The Council then sent
a letter to Brooks, the adminis
tration's spokesman in the ne
gotiations.
The letter asked him "to ap
pear at the next regular meet
ing of the Central Labor Council
to show cause why Stanford
should not conclude negotiations
and sign a satisfactory agree
ment with the Union (the
AFT)."
Glaser replied Monday, say

ing the University "cannot ac
cept your request.
"So far as the University is
aware," he continued, "no mem
ber of your Council has any
standing, legal or otherwise, to
purport to speak or act for any
member of the Stanford aca
demic community. . .
