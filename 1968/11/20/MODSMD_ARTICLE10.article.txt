## Strike Imminent? 
### ANDREW MOSS 
We may have a strike on this
campus. That should boggle
your mind because it has never
happened before. In fact, as far
as I know, this is the first time
a part of the academic commu

nity has banded together as a
union to say to the University,
"You have no right to determine
my life."
Organising yourself in a union
differentiates you from em
ployee associations, graduate
student associations or any oth
er group that accepts client sta
tus. To set up as a union is to
declare to your employer that
you regard yourself as his equal
and that, if necessary, you will
use the power you have, the
power of withdrawing your la
bor, to assert that equality.
This has the ring of confronta
tion politics and the power to
confront is just what a union
holds in reserve. But confronta
tion only becomes necessary
when one party in a dispute will
not accept the right of the other
party to share in decision mak
ing.
The history of the American
Federation of Teachers' (AFT)
attempts to share in decision
making about its own members'
living conditions has been one
of continuous frustration, typi
fied by last year's attempt to
collect basic information about
conditions of work, an attempt
that was deliberately frustrated
by Provost Lyman.
The administration of this
University does not seem to
want students, even those work
ing for the University, to take
a serious share in running it.
This attitude appeared last
week at the meeting between
Teaching Assistants' (TA's) rep
resentatives and administrators,
when Vice-Provost Bacchetti re
affirmed the basic administra
tion position: students are just
students, whether they work for
the University or not. They
should not expect a living wage.
They are not entitled access
to University records. Yet at the
same meeting Vice-Provost
Brooks asked the TA represen
tatives for suggestions on
sources of funds for a raise.
There is a contradiction here
in the implicit view of the TA's:
they are to be responsible citi
zens. adult in their decision mak
ing and confining their political
activity to "respectable" chan
nels, but they are not to be
treated as adults, not to be given
control over their own lives or
the status of employees or any
access to information.
This contradiction shows in
other activities of the Univer
sity. Students in general are to
abide by elaborate rules of con
duct but are denied real partici

pation in the running of the
University. Staff and library
workers are exploited and can
not unionize. Students and low
paid workers are forced out of
redeveloped downtown Palo Alto
with no recourse.
In no case is there any possi
bility of reasoned discussion be
cause there is no real parity be
tween the sides in the dispute.
Yet the University expects rea
soned discussion.
The justification of the exploi
tation and the lack of real par
ticipation is the supposed non
profit nature of the university.
Stanford, like every major uni
versity, operates in a cloud of
public-relations myths about the
nature of academic work and
the altruism of those who en
gage in it. On this ground those
who are exploited are suppose
to acquiesce in their exploita
tion.
This justification is false. Stan
ford is a profit-making institu
tion. Its profits, unfortunately,
go to the users of its academic
services, the corporations that
depend on it for talent, and to
consultancy fees and faculty and
administration salaries.
When you consider the TA de
mands ask yourself what the
average faculty salary is, the
yearly raise, the average admin
istrative salary, the profit Hew
lett-Packard draws from it.
Since most of these profits do
not return to general use, the
other academic needs of the Uni
versity get pauperied. No money
for TA's. (And since the State,
which pays most of the costs of
graduate education, gets little of
the profit, no money for most
graduates).
When a demand is made for a
raise the University is thus
forced to reallocate priorities, a
reallocation which calls those
priorities into question. Hence
the administration's hostility.
The T.A. representatives at
the recent meeting felt that the
administrators' hostility was
ideological, based on a refusal to
give way to any student-raised
demands. It seems clear that the
University can find the money
for an immediate raise if it
chooses to but it seems the ad
ministration will not give way
on the principle.
One can only see this intran
sigence as an indication that the
administration is unwilling to
consider its priorities, and un
willing to face the fact that stu
dent participation may mean a
change in those priorities.

public-relations myths about the
nature of academic work and
the altruism of those who en
gage in it. On this ground those
who are exploited are suppose
to acquiesce in their exploita
tion.
This justification is false. Stan
ford is a profit-making institu
tion. Its profits, unfortunately,
go to the users of its academic
services, the corporations that
depend on it for talent, and to
consultancy fees and faculty and
administration salaries.
When you consider the TA de
mands ask yourself what the
average faculty salary is, the
yearly raise, the average admin
istrative salary, the profit Hew
lett-Packard draws from it.
Since most of these profits do
not return to general use, the
other academic needs of the Uni
versity get pauperied. No money
for TA's. (And since the State,
which pays most of the costs of
graduate education, gets little of
the profit, no money for most
graduates).
When a demand is made for a
raise the University is thus
forced to reallocate priorities, a
reallocation which calls those
priorities into question. Hence
the administration's hostility.
The T.A. representatives at
the recent meeting felt that the
administrators' hostility was
ideological, based on a refusal to
give way to any student-raised
demands. It seems clear that the
University can find the money
for an immediate raise if it
chooses to but it seems the ad
ministration will not give way
on the principle.
One can only see this intran
sigence as an indication that the
administration is unwilling to
consider its priorities, and un
willing to face the fact that stu
dent participation may mean a
change in those priorities.
We may have a strike on this
campus. That should boggle
your mind because it has never
happened before. In fact, as far
as I know, this is the first time
a part of the academic commu

nity has banded together as a
union to say to the University,
"You have no right to determine
my life."
Organising yourself in a union
differentiates you from em
ployee associations, graduate
student associations or any oth
er group that accepts client sta
tus. To set up as a union is to
declare to your employer that
you regard yourself as his equal
and that, if necessary, you will
use the power you have, the
power of withdrawing your la
bor, to assert that equality.
This has the ring of confronta
tion politics and the power to
confront is just what a union
holds in reserve. But confronta
tion only becomes necessary
when one party in a dispute will
not accept the right of the other
party to share in decision mak
ing.
The history of the American
Federation of Teachers' (AFT)
attempts to share in decision
making about its own members'
living conditions has been one
of continuous frustration, typi
fied by last year's attempt to
collect basic information about
conditions of work, an attempt
that was deliberately frustrated
by Provost Lyman.
The administration of this
University does not seem to
want students, even those work
ing for the University, to take
a serious share in running it.
This attitude appeared last
week at the meeting between
Teaching Assistants' (TA's) rep
resentatives and administrators,
when Vice-Provost Bacchetti re
affirmed the basic administra
tion position: students are just
students, whether they work for
the University or not. They
should not expect a living wage.
They are not entitled access
to University records. Yet at the
same meeting Vice-Provost
Brooks asked the TA represen
tatives for suggestions on
sources of funds for a raise.
There is a contradiction here
in the implicit view of the TA's:
they are to be responsible citi
zens. adult in their decision mak
ing and confining their political
activity to "respectable" chan
nels, but they are not to be
treated as adults, not to be given
control over their own lives or
the status of employees or any
access to information.
This contradiction shows in
other activities of the Univer
sity. Students in general are to
abide by elaborate rules of con
duct but are denied real partici

pation in the running of the
University. Staff and library
workers are exploited and can
not unionize. Students and low
paid workers are forced out of
redeveloped downtown Palo Alto
with no recourse.
In no case is there any possi
bility of reasoned discussion be
cause there is no real parity be
tween the sides in the dispute.
Yet the University expects rea
soned discussion.
The justification of the exploi
tation and the lack of real par
ticipation is the supposed non

ing for the University, to take
a serious share in running it.
This attitude appeared last
week at the meeting between
Teaching Assistants' (TA's) rep
resentatives and administrators,
when Vice-Provost Bacchetti re
affirmed the basic administra
tion position: students are just
students, whether they work for
the University or not. They
should not expect a living wage.
They are not entitled access
to University records. Yet at the
same meeting Vice-Provost
Brooks asked the TA represen
tatives for suggestions on
sources of funds for a raise.
There is a contradiction here
in the implicit view of the TA's:
they are to be responsible citi
zens. adult in their decision mak
ing and confining their political
activity to "respectable" chan
nels, but they are not to be
treated as adults, not to be given
control over their own lives or
the status of employees or any
access to information.
This contradiction shows in
other activities of the Univer
sity. Students in general are to
abide by elaborate rules of con
duct but are denied real partici

pation in the running of the
University. Staff and library
workers are exploited and can
not unionize. Students and low
paid workers are forced out of
redeveloped downtown Palo Alto
with no recourse.
In no case is there any possi
bility of reasoned discussion be
cause there is no real parity be
tween the sides in the dispute.
Yet the University expects rea
soned discussion.
The justification of the exploi
tation and the lack of real par
ticipation is the supposed non
profit nature of the university.
Stanford, like every major uni
versity, operates in a cloud of
public-relations myths about the
nature of academic work and
the altruism of those who en
gage in it. On this ground those
who are exploited are suppose
to acquiesce in their exploita
tion.
This justification is false. Stan
ford is a profit-making institu
tion. Its profits, unfortunately,
go to the users of its academic
services, the corporations that
depend on it for talent, and to
consultancy fees and faculty and
administration salaries.
When you consider the TA de
mands ask yourself what the
average faculty salary is, the
yearly raise, the average admin
istrative salary, the profit Hew
lett-Packard draws from it.
Since most of these profits do
not return to general use, the
other academic needs of the Uni
versity get pauperied. No money
for TA's. (And since the State,
which pays most of the costs of
graduate education, gets little of
the profit, no money for most
graduates).
When a demand is made for a
raise the University is thus
forced to reallocate priorities, a
reallocation which calls those
priorities into question. Hence
the administration's hostility.
The T.A. representatives at
the recent meeting felt that the
administrators' hostility was
ideological, based on a refusal to
give way to any student-raised
demands. It seems clear that the
University can find the money
for an immediate raise if it
chooses to but it seems the ad
ministration will not give way
on the principle.
One can only see this intran
sigence as an indication that the
administration is unwilling to
consider its priorities, and un
willing to face the fact that stu
dent participation may mean a
change in those priorities.
We may have a strike on this
campus. That should boggle
your mind because it has never
happened before. In fact, as far
as I know, this is the first time
a part of the academic commu

nity has banded together as a
union to say to the University,
"You have no right to determine
my life."
Organising yourself in a union
differentiates you from em
ployee associations, graduate
student associations or any oth
er group that accepts client sta
tus. To set up as a union is to
declare to your employer that
you regard yourself as his equal
and that, if necessary, you will
use the power you have, the
power of withdrawing your la
bor, to assert that equality.
This has the ring of confronta
tion politics and the power to
confront is just what a union
holds in reserve. But confronta
tion only becomes necessary
when one party in a dispute will
not accept the right of the other
party to share in decision mak
ing.
The history of the American
Federation of Teachers' (AFT)
attempts to share in decision
making about its own members'
living conditions has been one
of continuous frustration, typi
fied by last year's attempt to
collect basic information about
conditions of work, an attempt
that was deliberately frustrated
by Provost Lyman.
The administration of this
University does not seem to
want students, even those work
ing for the University, to take
a serious share in running it.
