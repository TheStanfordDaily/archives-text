## Tale Of A Naive Freshman 
### CISSIE BONINI 
(Editor's Note: This is the first
in a series of true-life, exciting
adventures of Honeybunch
Dornhoffer, freshman, Tanmore
University. Every young woman
of today can draw strength and
inspiration from Honeybunch's
courageous "yes" to woman
hood, to Tanmore, and —unfor-
tunately —to her boyfried, that
dashing T.A., Comely Steam
glasses. )
Honeybunch drew deep re
freshing breaths of pure Cali
fornia air. After the initial verti
go induced by the impurities
had subsided, she looked up at
the stars and thought of her
first class in Astronomy here at
Tanmore. (The best of all pos
sible Universities, in the best of
all possible states, in the best
of all possible countries, and all
that jazz.)
The field trip in Astronomy 1
was to lie flat on your back
in a field behind the campus and
gaze at the stars. Or, at least,
that's what the T.A., Comely
Steamglasses, had said was the
field trip. Anyway, Honeybunch
had learned some important
Wessons that first night: (1)
•classes at Tanmore always de
manded a great deal more than
you had planned on contribut
ing; (2) never trust a T.A.; (3)
it's hard to explain to your
mother how you got grass-stain
on the shoulder blade area of
your blouse in Astronomy 1.
At first, Honeybunch laughed
to recall, she had had a feeling
of isolation at Tanmore—as
though no one would look you
in the eye. Later, of course, she

realized that was due to the
male-female ratio. Like many
subjugated races, the males at
Tanmore kept their eyes re
spectfully to the ground and
many burst into tears of grati
tude when addressed in a friend
ly manner.
In the beginning, Honeybunch
had difficulty cutting off conver
sations with a frozen sneer and
tapping the ashes of her cigar
ette into her escorts' cupped
hands; let alone grinding out
her Tareytons in the smalls of
their back. (Small of their
backs?) Anyway, her kindly and
compassionate roomie Flouncy
Taut, had explained that this
was just a conditioned response
emanating from her bourgeois
family's maudlinly sentimental
attitude toward household pets.
After Comely had gone to
Persia to complete research on
his Ph.D. Thesis: "Some Astro
nomical Evidence in Support of
the Contention that Cancer Peo
ple Really Are Homebodies",
Honeybunch's social situation
was desparate.
After mastering the male
spurning situation, she achieved
the ultimate victory for Tan
more women: no one called her
for dates. Unfortunately, even
Tanmore girls crave male in
tellectual stimulation.
And—once again—resourceful
Flouncie Taut came to the res
cue with a blind date: a junior
from Paly High.

MORAL: Always treat people
as equals, if all else fails.
• Letters To Mom
Dear Mom,
Congratulations on your new
column. Don't tell any of the
things we discussed at the
neighborhood coffee.
Your loving neighbors In
Pine Hill, Stanford
Dear Neighbors,
I have received 46 letters con
gratulating me on the column
and requesting me "not to tell."
Don't worry darlings. I will only
publish deeply personal or un
usual events in your lives that

would help the dear students to
realize that even the faculty
have their little faults and flaws.
God doesn't expect any of us
to be perfect. Like the last Fac
ulty Club dance when. . . .
Reininiscently,
Mom
Dear Mom,
I recently attended an Ameri
can Economic Society meeting
and had to pay $30 in crating
fees to transport my dog. The
dog did give a paper at the
meeting, but it was not well
received. Can I deduct his travel
cost as a business expense?
John C.
Graduate School of Business

Dear John,
If your dog is a full-time tui
tion paying Stanford student
you may not deduct his travel
fees as a legitimate business ex
pense. However, if he is teach
ing economics, they may be de
ductible as legitimate business
expenses. (Assuming the dog is
legitimate. I personally feel this
shouldn't matter just so he is
a nice person.)
I had heard there were a lot
of dogs attending Stanford,
especially from the Row Houses,
and I want to say again, "Wel
come" and "Stanford welcomes
diversity in her students."
Doggedly yours,
Mom
