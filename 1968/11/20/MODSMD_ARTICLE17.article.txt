Editor, THE DAILY:
In his Daily article, "Refer
ences Hard to Find for Seniors,"
Philip Taubman dramatically
pointed up a critical problem on
this campus, which has been
chronic for several years.
It is ironic and tragic that, in
a private university of modest
enrollment, students can reach
the senior year knowing hardly
a single professor well enough
to approach him as a reference
for graduate school application.
Where student anonmity is of
such proportions, the education

al process somehow is not work
ing.
So the student ends up in des
peration in the Dean of Stu
dents' Office, and Associate
Dean John Hanson tries to im
provise a solution.
His experience is replicated
many times each year by coun
selors in the Counseling and
Testing Center. Usually these
are students who earlier had
some three or four counseling
interviews with the counselor.
And they bring the familiar and
rather wistful refrain, "I guess
you know me, and my profes

sors don't, and I've got to have
a reference from somebody for
graduate school."

Editor, THE DAILY:
I was shocked Monday morn
ing to see on the front page of
the Daily, a photograph depict
ing a twenty dollar bill being
paid for "a lid of marijuana."
Prices like this are outrageous
and have no place in the stu
dent community.
