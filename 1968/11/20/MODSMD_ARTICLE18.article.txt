# Yale Goes Coed
## 
### 
Stanford's admission office had
a big let down last week.
Yale University has joined the
ranks of the major pr ivate uni
versities with co-education.
Announced last Friday the
move is being made at Yale in
order to "enhance its contribu
tion to the generations ahead."
Kingman Brewster Jr., the

President of Yale made the an
nouncement saying that 500 girls
would be enrolled in September
and that their experience would
"determine the pattern" for full
co-education.
The girls will be Yale students
in every sense, eligible for the
same courses as men and treated
no differently by the administra
tion.
The university's ultimate goal
Brewster said, is to have at least
1500 women undergraduates,
without reducing the male un
dergraduate enrollment, which
is 4000. He estimated the cost
at $55 million.
The decision comes one year
after Vassar College rejected an
overture toward co-education.
The news has drawn enthusi
astic approval of most students
and teachers across the country.
