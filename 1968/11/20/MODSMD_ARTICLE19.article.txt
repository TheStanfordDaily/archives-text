• Italy Premier Quits
ROME (AP)—Premier Gio
vanni Leone's five-month-old
Christian Democrat minority
Cabinet resigned Tuesday and
opened a government crisis in
the middle of the worst nation
wide strike by state employees
in the past decade.
As two million government
employees walked off their jobs
and paralyzed the nation in a
24-hour boycott, Leone told
President Giuseppe Saragat he
was quitting to clear the way
for a new center-left majority
coalition. This would embrace
the Socialists, the Republicans

and his own Christian Demo
crats.
Leone's government the 28th
in postwar Italy—bowed out
with the country in labor chaos.

• Welfare Broadening?
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
government proposed Tuesday
that people be made eligible for
welfare on the basis of a simple
statement of need.
The proposed new approach,
which would eliminate involved
investigations, could mean that
more eligible people would be
added to the swelling welfare
roles, officials said. Rut they said
little abuse would be expected
because investigations have
found only about one-half of one
per cent of infractions.
