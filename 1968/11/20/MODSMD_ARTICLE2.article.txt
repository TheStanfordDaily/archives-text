## Depression Common 
### ALAN GLAROS 
"I'm just getting to know the
environment, but I find my work
immensely enjoyable," said Dr.
David Dorosin, now director of
psychiatric services at the
Cowell Student Health Center in
a recent Daily interview.
Dr. Dorosin, the only full
time medical school faculty
member now working at Cowell,
assumed his new post last Sep
tember. He heads a staff of
three full-time psychiatrists, one
half-time psychiatrist who
works with medical students,
and a half-time social worker.
Dorosin stated that between
four and ten per cent of Stan
ford students consult the psychi
atric service at least once each
year. He stated that ho was told
to expect freshmen, transfer
students, and new graduate stu
dents to occupy most of his time
during the first part of this
quarter, but this apparently has
not been the case.
Instead, Dr. Dorosin stated
that he was "impressed with the
differences" between students

and the "randomness of duress"
which brings them to Cowell.
Most of the students which
Dr. Dorosin sees are troubled
with depression or anxiety,
which stemmed from the prob
lems of "boys and girls break
ing up, or concern with a de
cision of curriculum or major."
"Situational" Problems
Dorosin also added that most
of these problems were "situa
tional," stating that most of the
students were "healthy."
But, like the national average
for college age people, about
two severe psychiatric cases per
thousand students appear at
Stanford each year. "Surpris
ingly enough," stated Dorosin,
"this national average doesn't
change in this age group
through the years."
He also noted, "Suicide is a
real problem. According to stud
ies done by Farnsworth at Har
vard, (he suicide rates of college
students are not much higher
than for other people of the
same age group."
Because of the "climate of
higher expectations" found at
universities, some students see
suicide as "the only way out."
For the Stanford student, the
problem becomes "If I'm not at
the top, can my life have any
meaning?"
Twenty New Patients A Week
Dr. Dorosin estimated that the
psychiatric services see about
twenty new patients a week. In
addition to psychotherapy, the
members of the psychiatric ser
vices make use of the infirmary,
various drugs, and the group
therapy and conference room in
the basement of the health cen
ter.
"Unfortunately, we cannot
serve all the needs we know
exist." he stated. Because of the

number of students who come
to the psychiatric services of
fered at Cowell and the small
number of staff, the treatment is
limited to short-term therapy.
In this way, he noted "Any stu
dent who wants to consult us
can" and also have the advant
age of "immediate consultation."
If a student should need long
term therapy, he is referred to
the psychiatric clinic at the med
ical school or to a private psy
chiatrist in Palo Alto.
Dr. Borosin also expressed
concern over the large number
of encounter groups and T
groups flourishing at Stanford.
He stated that the expectations
of the groups might be "a little
over-rated." But, he added, "I'd
like to learn more," so that he
could base his opinion on profes
sional judgment.
Noting that the university was
in an "age of intimacy," Dorosin
stated that he would like "to
meet people on their home
grounds, to know more about
the social environment of the
university."

fered at Cowell and the small
number of staff, the treatment is
limited to short-term therapy.
In this way, he noted "Any stu
dent who wants to consult us
can" and also have the advant
age of "immediate consultation."
If a student should need long
term therapy, he is referred to
the psychiatric clinic at the med
ical school or to a private psy
chiatrist in Palo Alto.
Dr. Borosin also expressed
concern over the large number
of encounter groups and T
groups flourishing at Stanford.
He stated that the expectations
of the groups might be "a little
over-rated." But, he added, "I'd
like to learn more," so that he
could base his opinion on profes
sional judgment.
Noting that the university was
in an "age of intimacy," Dorosin
stated that he would like "to
meet people on their home
grounds, to know more about
the social environment of the
university."


DR. DAVID DOROSIN
"I'm just getting to know the
environment, but I find my work
immensely enjoyable," said Dr.
David Dorosin, now director of
psychiatric services at the
Cowell Student Health Center in
a recent Daily interview.
Dr. Dorosin, the only full
time medical school faculty
member now working at Cowell,
assumed his new post last Sep
tember. He heads a staff of
three full-time psychiatrists, one
half-time psychiatrist who
works with medical students,
and a half-time social worker.
Dorosin stated that between
four and ten per cent of Stan
ford students consult the psychi
atric service at least once each
year. He stated that ho was told
to expect freshmen, transfer
students, and new graduate stu
dents to occupy most of his time
during the first part of this
quarter, but this apparently has
not been the case.
Instead, Dr. Dorosin stated
that he was "impressed with the
differences" between students

and the "randomness of duress"
which brings them to Cowell.
Most of the students which
Dr. Dorosin sees are troubled
with depression or anxiety,
which stemmed from the prob
lems of "boys and girls break
ing up, or concern with a de
cision of curriculum or major."
"Situational" Problems
Dorosin also added that most
of these problems were "situa
tional," stating that most of the
students were "healthy."
But, like the national average
for college age people, about
two severe psychiatric cases per
thousand students appear at
Stanford each year. "Surpris
ingly enough," stated Dorosin,
"this national average doesn't
change in this age group
through the years."
He also noted, "Suicide is a
real problem. According to stud
ies done by Farnsworth at Har
vard, (he suicide rates of college
students are not much higher
than for other people of the
same age group."
Because of the "climate of
higher expectations" found at
universities, some students see
suicide as "the only way out."
For the Stanford student, the
problem becomes "If I'm not at
the top, can my life have any
meaning?"
Twenty New Patients A Week
Dr. Dorosin estimated that the
psychiatric services see about
twenty new patients a week. In
addition to psychotherapy, the
members of the psychiatric ser
vices make use of the infirmary,
various drugs, and the group
therapy and conference room in
the basement of the health cen
ter.
"Unfortunately, we cannot
serve all the needs we know
exist." he stated. Because of the

number of students who come
to the psychiatric services of
fered at Cowell and the small
number of staff, the treatment is
limited to short-term therapy.
