# Students Vie For Admission To Summer Intern Program
## 
### 
Although we're still in the
midst of fall quarter and
Thanksgiving is still one week
away, students who want to ap
ply for a summer internship
through the Stanford In Wash
ington (SIW) program are
urged to pick up their applica
tions today at 4:15 in the Large
Lounge in Tresidder Union.
Organized in 1963 by a com
mittee of students and faculty
SIW lobbies for jobs in Congres
sional offices and federal agen
cies, sponsors an orientation
program, and offers a series of
meetings and seminars while in
Washington and upon return to
the campus in the fall.
In spite of the official cut in
Washington's summer intern
program, Stanford University
placed into government offices
this past summer approximate
ly 100 students, again making it
the largest as well as the oldest
intern program on the "Hill."
According to Karen Bjork
lund, Chairman of the Stanford
in-Washington program, "The
primary objective of the pro
gram is to enable qualified Stan
ford students to become ac
quainted with the processes of
the federal government through

direct contact with it." Interns
are almost unanimously enthu
siastic about the program and
the opportunity it gives them to
gain first-hand knowledge and
understanding of the workings
of government.
Although jobs and responsi
bilities vary, students repeated
ly stress the summer's value as
"an intensive learning experi
ence." One student comments,
"One summer in Washington
was easily worth as much as a
year in school."
The congressional intern has
the opportunity to participate in
the activities and responsibilities
of Congressmen, Senators, and
government officials. As one in
tern comments, "After working
in Washington, I am sure that
I want to return after gradua
tion. No where else are people
so aware of and concerned about
what's happening."
Responsibilities assigned to
interns are numerous. Work
ranges from the mechanical fil
ing and shuffling of papers to
the research and preparation of
reports, letters, and legislation.
Even if at first an intern is
shunted into a corner, personal
initiative usually will get him

out of it.
Most officers allow the interns
sufficient free time to attend
Stanford meetings, committee
hearings, floor debates, and oth
er intern programs during the
summer.
Employment in federal agen
cies is normally handled through
the Civil Service Commission.
SIW provides the various re
quired forms and advises stu
dents about the Civil Service
Exam. Job placement is deter
mined competitively on the basis
of exam scores, academic record,
and recommendations.
Each fall quarter letters are
sent to Congressmen, Senators,
and committee staffs, to deter
mine interest in employing a
Stanford student. Correspon
dence is maintained with those
who reply affirmatively. A num
ber of federal agencies are also
contacted to investigate the
availability of agency positions.
The selection of Stanford in
terns is based on an application
form provided by the SIW Advi
sory Board, and an interview
with members of the SIW com
mittee.
Winter quarter, SIW repre
sentatives fly to Washington to

confirm job offers and seek ad
ditional internships on Capitol
Hill. Final selection of interns
is in the hands of prospective
employers.
Congressmen are no longer al
lotted $750 for a summer in
tern's salary. Therefore, salaries
vary according to what each in
dividual Congressman feels he
can afford.
No Senators are generally in
the same position, but they do
have larger budgets and can us
ually afford to pay an intern a
reasonable salary.
With the costs of transporta
tion and living expenses con
sidered, one cannot expect to
make much money in Washing
ton. For those who are in need
of financial aid in order to take
advantage of the intern pro
gram, SIW grants a number of
stipends which generally cover
transportation and living ex
penses.
The prospective intern must
be a Stanford student in good
standing. Evaluations are based
on academic standing, personal
initiative, recommendations, and
qualities such as writing, speak
ing, and leadership abilities.
