## Comedy: A Funny Thing 
### ROBIN LAKE 
If you want to catch a Cour
tesan there's still time! Hurry
on down to Mem. Aud. any night
through Friday at 8:30 p.m. In
place of the traditional Gaieties,
and with a financial boost from
ASSU, the Mafia is presenting
A Funny Thing Happened On
The Way To The Forum. And a
whole two hours of funny things
do indeed happen, onstage and
off, with the emphasis very
much on gaiety. Due to the
problems of publicity and dead
lines I was invited to review
the preview Monday night.
'Forum' has as an excuse for
a plot a certain Pseudolus, a
cocky slave bound for freedom
by hook or crook—or by both—
if he can help his young master,
Hero, to a Cretan virgin. Steph
en J. Book is Pseudolus: master
of the split line, slow take,
throw away, world in a gesture,
double take and all the other
techniques which make up the
comic's bag.
Mr. Book's performance is
without question the highlight
of the evening and almost a
sufficient reason unto itself for
the choice of this show. He takes
the audienc irthis talented stride
and shares with us his tricks
and laughter.
He is ably backed by two wel
come newcomers, Gene L. Eu
gene as Lycus, a procuror, and
Richard Geldard as Senex. Mr.

Engene turns in the most con
sistently solid comic perform
ance of the show—always me
ticulously detailed without ever
becoming over-busy. Geldard's
Senex is a delightfully individ
ual portrayal of what could have
been merely a stock comic char
acter.
'Forum' is undoubtedly a male
show as far as the leads go.
Gene Parseghian adds to his
successful credits at Stanford
("The Gargoyle," and"Tlie Ti
ger"), with another excellently
conceived and executed perform
ance as Hysterium. His variety
of moods and pace does much
to sustain the show through
some of its weaker moments.
Norman Hargreaves as Erron
ius supplies the correct amount
of befuddled senility to supply
the running gag of all time;
and there are two crazy, hard
working comics who triple as
Proteans, eunuchs, soldiers, etc.
and answer to the call of Denny
Kerwin and Dennis Beaulieu.
The only weak link in the
male chain at the preview was
Miles Gloriosus. Unfortunately
mere height is not a substitute
for the skill this stock figure
requires. Perhaps a lot of pad
ding might help the swagger.
His voice, while adequate in dia
logue, dissipated in song.
However, in this circumstance
he is not alone since it cannot
be denied that none of the men

can sing. Several attempt a
plausible substitute: Book
clarity, projection and sheer vi
tality; Geldard through inuendo
and timing; and Parseghian
with charm and perhaps the
truest ear.
The only male who comes
close to actually singing is our
young lover, Hero, played by
Dennis Whitaker. The roles of
the young couple are seldom
very rewarding and he and
Gretchen Grant, enticing as
Philia, struggle along gallantly
with what little they are given
to do.
On the female side there is
Senex' shrewish wife, Domina,
well sustained by Stephanie Kel
vin. And last, but certainly far
from least, there are the ten
deadly sins in the form of fleshy
Courtesans, one of whom could
be yours (fellows) if you ar
rive early and grab an aisle seat
near the middle (there are no
reserved seats). A special trib
ute to Carlisle Ellis as Gym
nasia.
'Forum' is conceived in a to
tally theatrical form from the
Prologue, through audience in
volvement, the intermission, the
fantastic chase, and the numer
ous devices of slapstick and
farce which have kept people
laughing and the theatrical tra
dition alive through the bleakest
periods of history.
This is where much of true
theatre is at.

The score is not one that will
bring you to your feet but there
are moments, under the musical
direction of Robert S. Hoffman,
when the orchestration at its
best catches one foot-tapping.
Such moments for the most part
were not fully realised in the
choreography, but I suspect that
this was the one area that suf
fered most from the pressure of
time-limit and production dead
line for Big Game week. Musical
numbers which stay with me
are "Everybody ought to have
a maid" with its clever building
reprises by the four men, and
"You're Lovely" by Pseudolus
and Hysterium.
There were other problems
Monday night which may well
work themselves out in per
formance—at least the technical
and the pacing problems. A bou
quet to the spot-men in passing.
Yes, the show has its faults and
is by no means perfect. It will
require constant hard work
(which I am confident it will
get) till the closing curtain, the
performers never allowing them
selves to relax for an instant.
However, as directed by Ro
bert P. Walter it is a very am
bitious project which has
emerged through great odds into
an already delightful evening.
The show almost deserves to
succeed on the merit of its cour
age and audacity—but it has
much more to sustain it besides
these qualities.
