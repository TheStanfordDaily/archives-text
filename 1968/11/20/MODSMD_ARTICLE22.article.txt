# Overtime Thriller
## Dislocations Grab IM Grid Crown 
### BRUCE HOWARD 
Relying as they have all sea
son long on defense, the Dislo
cations today sneaked by the
Phi Delts in an overtime thriller
12-6 to win the intramural touch
football championship.
Tied 6-6 at the end of regula
tion play, the game went into
an overtime period in which each
team is given four downs. The
winner is the team gaining the
most yards in the four plays. On
the last play of the Phi Delts'
series, defender Craig Barrett
intercepted a Mike Bush pass
and raced 80 yards for the touch
down.
The game was won on the
interception alone, because the
Dislocations had outgained the
Phi Delts in the four plays, but
the touchdown gave the Dislo
cations a scoring edge as well.
The game was a frustrating
one for both offenses as each
was able to move consistently in
the middle of the field, but could
not seem to score.
The Phi Delt pass rush, led by

Clem Richardson and Dave Bail
ey, kept the pressure on Dislo
cation quarterback Mike Evans
throughout the game, forcing
many hurried throws and catch
ing him for losses three times.
As a result, the Dislocations had
to punt twice and lost the ball
on downs three times.
On the other side, the Dislo
cation defense was equally
strong, intercepting three passes
and breaking up four passes in
their own end zone, two in the
last twenty seconds of the game.
The Phi Delts were able to
score only after a penalty gave
them a first down on the Dislo
cation 3. Two plays later, Greg
Kowal scored on a pass fro m
Bush.
The Dislocations scored two
minutes later on a fourth-down
pass from Evans to Bob Maddox
on his knees in the end zone.
An incomplete PAT pass left
the score tied and set the scene
for the climactic overtime period
and a happy reunion of the Dis
location team later on at the
Oasis.
