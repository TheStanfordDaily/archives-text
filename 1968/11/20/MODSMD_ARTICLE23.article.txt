# Tribe Poloists Split Final Pair
## 
### FRED MANN 
Stanford's youthful varsity
water polo team ended their
1968 campaign last weekend on
both a high and low note.
The only high note of the en
tire year came Friday night
when the Cards finally won an
important contest, defeating the
powerful San Francisco Olym
pic Club 14-13 in overtime. The
next morning however, Stan
ford returned to conference play
and was clobbered by California,
15-7, to end the season in the
cellar.
"Of course I'm never happy
when we lose, but I'm not di
appointed about the season,"
commented Coach Jim Gaugh
ran. "The victory over the Olym
pic Club was just great. The
team was up against the out
standing graduate college play
ers in the area, and came up
winners."
The Cal game was a different
story. Berkeley's John Shores
and Peter Ash, both nationally
recognized players, made the
difference, as they provided the
powerful scoring punch that
pushed Cal into a second place
tie with USC in the final stand
ings. UCLA repeated as league
champs with Stanford well out
of it.
"The whole difference in the i
California game and all season !
long was our inexperience," j
Gaughran remarked. "Before we
even started practice, I could
see the losses coming from such
a tough league. I'm not upsetâ€”
the boys did a great job."
The Indians finished with a
7-10 record, lowest in years. The
schedule was one of the tough- j
est in the nation as nearly every
opponent was a ranked power.
Walt 'Til Next Year
The losing streak for Gaugh- j
ran's water polo squad figures
to stop at one year. Only Jeff
Hammett will be missing from
next season's line-up and the
experience gained by such out
standing players as Joe Welsh,
Ross Johnson, Ken Terry, Rob j
Jensen, and Ray Collins should ,
be enough to put the Cards back :
on top.
Also returning is the team's
leading scorer, Tom Hill. "No
doubt about it. Hill was our out
standing player all year long,"
said the coach. "He was every
place."
An important addition to next
year's team will be Mitch Ivey,
the leading scorer on the '67
freshman team who did not

compete this year. Ivey spent
the water polo season in Mexico
participating in the Olympics.
Although he returned in time to
play in the Tribe's last three
games, Gaughran held Ivey out
so his year of eligibility wasn't
wasted.
Senior Luis Nicolao, who also
competed in the Olympics, will
likewise have a year of eligi
bility remaining, and Gaughran
plans to use him if he's still at
Stanford. Right now Nicolao is j
one quarter behind, so there is
a chance he will be here in fall
quarter '69.
Itieh Frosh Crop
Adding to the impressive line
up for next year will be the
mainstays of this season's
powerful freshman team, high
scorer Rick Massimino and
goalie Pete Gadd. The frosh won
the Northern California "B"
Tournament last weekend with a
9-3 victory over College of San
Mateo, a team that had beaten
them earlier in the season. Mas
simino was named Most Val
uable Player for his efforts.
"The addition of Massimino to

the varsity will help Hill's play,"
revealed Gaughran. "With Rick
playing in the hole, Tommy will
be able to move around more
easily. And don't forget Gadd.
He's got some tremendous
moves in that goal," smiled the
Tribe chieftan.
Visions of the next spring
practice were already beginning
to erase the memories of an un
hannv season
