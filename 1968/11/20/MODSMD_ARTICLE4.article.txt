# Meeting Delayed
## 
### 
Friday's planned meeting be
tween teaching assistants (TA's)
and administrators was post
poned yesterday.
The Administration bargain
ing team, led by Vice Provost E.
Howard Brooks, was scheduled
to respond for a second time to
TA demands for immediate sal
ary raises.
The meeting is doubly impor
tant since the administrators
have a Nov. 30 strike deadline
hanging over their heads, a
strike that apparently would be
backed up by a strike sanction
from the local AFL-CIO council.
In asking for a postponement
for "three or four days," Brooks
stated that his group was "not
quite ready" to respond to the
demands.
Nothing This Year
Brooks added that administra
tors "are still gathering infor
mation. We are conducting a
very extensive consultation so
that certain steps can be taken
this year." The TA's last week
rejected a University counter
proposal that made no provision
for salary boosts this year.
Brooks explained that the pro
vost's office is investigating the
work requirements and pay
scales for teaching assistants in
all departments. Inequalities
and other pressure points be
sides graduate students in po
litical science, English, and an
thropology—the three depart
ments that presented the de
mands—can then be dealt with,
he added.
The delay in the negotiation
session "is riot a put-off job,"
Brooks claimed.
Graduate student Richard
Young, a teaching assistant in
elementary political science
courses, viewed Brooks' move
with some skepticism. Young is
steward for his department's
TA's, who first presented the de
mands.
"Rather Disturbed"
"I am rather disturbed at the
unilateral cancellation of the
meeting," Young commented.
"But I do have the impression
that the administration is now
in the process of seriously re
sponding to our demands," he
added.
Young conjectured that a
strike is now "unlikely," com
menting, "We have been reason
able, and at long last I am Ret
ting indications that the admin
istration is becoming reason
able."
Edward Nelson, recently elect
ed president of the local gradu
ate student union, drew similar
conclusions.

"If they are really going to
make serious proposals, a post
ponement for a few days is not
serious. On the other hand, by
just postponing, procrastinat
ing, and not desiring a negoti
ated settlement, they are in
creasing the likelihood of a
strike."
Nelson announced a dinner
meeting of the union, Local 1816
of the American Federation of
Teachers, for 6 p.m. tonight in
the Tresidder cafeteria. Mem
bers are expected to discuss the
possible usage of expected forth
coming strike sanctions from the
local labor council.
