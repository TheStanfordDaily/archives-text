# Consensus Politics Urged To Settle Campus Disputes
## 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
Two professors have written
a paper proposing that consen
sus politics be used to settle dis
putes within the University com
munity.
In a paper submitted to an ad
hoc faculty committee advising
Acting President Robert Glaser
on handling potentially disrup
tive situations, Prof. Stephen
Kline, of engineering, and Assoc.
Prof. Edwin Good, of religion
and Hebrew, advised that "real,
tough continuing discussions be
tween responsible administra
tors, faculty, and students must
occur.
"The time has come to seek
specific, constructive resolutions
to our problems: this implies to
us several things: cessation of
tactics that lead to war; clear,
specific identification of issues:
and prolonged real discussions
leading to consensus and solu
tion."
Atmosphere of Trust
Kline and Good also said that
an atmosphere of trust must
exist between those parties tak
ing part in the discussions. They
stated that the trust can easily
be destroyed.
"We believe it is of the es
sence to make a distinction bc

tween those seeking construc
tive change and those who,
whatever their motives, are be
having in a way that prevents
constructive change and hence
acerbates the problems," they
continued.
In an interview with The
Daily, Prof. Kline added, "I be
lieve in action, constructive ac
tion. But coercion frequently
tends to create polariation and
bring an overreaction which only
makes things worse."
He then cited as an example
the $250 million state bond issue
defeated in the election. He said
that the disruptions at Univer
sity of California campuses were
the major cause of the defeat
of the bond issue.
Kline said that the radicals
who disrupted the Cal campus
helped defeat a measure which
would have aided the very peo
ple they were trying to aid:
ghetto blacks.
Basic Grievances
Kline and Good also discussed
what they feel to be the students
five basic grievances:
• the doctrine of In loco par
entis
• improvement of housing,
and the food service
• a less rigid curriculum

• an increase in decision mak
ing powers
• participation of universities
as active agents of social change,
particularly relating to race and
ghetto problems.
All Faculty Conservatives
In the paper, they cited as po
litically paranoid statements
phrases like "all faculty are con
servatives interested only in sal
ary and tenure" and "all admin
istrators are tools of the mili
tary-industrial complex."
Both Prof. Kline and Good
feel that in order to achieve the
goals of the university, coercion
must be avoided. "Coercion is
the least desirable way of re
solving anything, particularly in
a university, which should have
a consensus," Prof. Kline said.
The paper also lists two other
tests for political paranoia:
• "Does one prejudge issues
without consultation and use au
thority, coercion, or tactics that
will force coercion as a response
to impose the will of the mi
nority?
• "Does one make demands
with threat of violence or coer
cion which are clearly unrealiza
ble in time, money or for other
reasons?"
