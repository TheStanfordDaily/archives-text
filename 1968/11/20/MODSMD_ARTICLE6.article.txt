rock-soul dance with music pro
vided by the "Gropus Cackus
Band." The dance will tak place

as a framework for the piles of
surplus lnmber that will be ig

have been constructing an effigy
of a Cal bear which will be hung
and burned in the midst of the
night's festivities. Freshmen

to guard the site of the bonfire,
while the female members of
the class have been serving re

freshments and keeping the men
company.
The Stanford Band, in addi
tion to playing at the rallies and
various functions during the
rest of the week, will attempt
to make a complete musical tour

of all the residences Thursday.
After the bonfire Friday, the
Band will proceed to San Fran
cisco, where they will perform
at alumni reunions and parade
through the streets of the city
as a final preparation for Sat
urday's Big Game.


"BURN, BEAR, BURN" â€”On Friday night a bear, Cal's mascot, will
be burned in effigy on top of a huge bonfire at Lake Lagunita. This
is part of a rally to incite spirit for Saturday's Big game against
Cal.
