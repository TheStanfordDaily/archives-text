# Blacks Pressure Hayward Editor
## 
### MIKE HALL Reprinted from the DAILY CALIFORNIAN 
The normally placid California
State College campus at Hay
ward has been rocked this past
week with the resignation of
the student newspaper editor
and the controversy surrounding
it.
The issue came to life Oct. 25
when editor Sharon Holzmeister
ran an editorial in an issue of
The Pioneer which condemned
Black Power salute protest made
by Tommie Smith and John Car
los at the Mexico Olympics.
Members of the campus Black
Student Union became extreme
ly angry over the publication of
the editorial feeling that "it was
an insult to black dignity."
About eighty black students
and a small number of white
students appeared soon after in
the Pioneer office and waited
while a black girl typed out a
letter of resignation which they
presented to Miss Holzmeister

asking for her to sign. She
signed an hour later saying it
was "for the good of the col
lege."
After more than two weeks
waiting she said the school ad
ministration finally "gave me a
vote of confidence" when the
College's acting President Ellis
E. McCune informed her that
he was rejecting her resigna
tion. In the meantime she has
charged that "The Pioneer is in
danger of being taken over by
various groups on campus. They
all want us to be their mouth
organ."
The student legislature at the
school has already demanded
her permanent resignation.
Miss Holzmeister has termed
the student council hearing
against her "an attempt to get
me in a kangaroo court." She
says she wants an open Pub
lishers Board meeting to review
charges against her. Last week
a closed Board meeting refused
to either accept or reject her
resignation.
