# SF State Reopens Today; Police To Enforce Order

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —President Robert Smith told San Fran
cisco State College students and faculty Tuesday that police pro
tection will be necessary when campus reopens Wednesday as
ordered by state college trustees.
Smith, in a .statement issued Tuesday night, said he and the
deans of the seven schools had decided to resume a full class sched
ule beginning at 8 a.m. Wednesday.
This was an apparent rejection of a new faculty proposal, ap
proved by a majority of 800 tenured professors, that one big
campus-wide class be held Wednesday.
The faculty had suggested that a dialogue between Smith and the
Black Student Union be telecast and broadcast to students in their
own classrooms.
Boos and jeers filled the audience when Smith said:
"It is crucial that we turn more to the community—to law en
forcement agencies—to try to control violence on this campus."
Smith closed the campus last Thursday after violent confronta
tions involving police, campus radicals and black power advocates.
The violence stemmed from protests against the order by Dr.
Glenn Dumke, state college system chancellor, that George Mur
ray, a Black Panther, be dismissed from his faculty post as part
time instructor. Murray reportedly had urged black students to
carry guns on campus.
Meanwhile, the suspension of 21 students in the armed seizure
Nov. 4 of a campus building was lifted Tuesday by Dr. Paul Blom
gren, acting president of San Fernando Valley State College.
Dr. Blomgren said campus charges against the students were not
dropped. He said campus and civil authorities were still working in
cases where students had been charged with criminal offenses.
About 30 persons, allegedly members of the militant Black Stu
dent Union, have been arraigned on a variety of felony charges.
