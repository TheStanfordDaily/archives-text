## MASC Hits Chicano Stereotype 
### AGUSTIN MEDINA JR 
"You're so smart for a Mexi
can!" This comment, overheard
by this writer in a conversation
between a Mexican youth and
his Anglo date, aptly illustrates
the manner in which Mexican
Americans are stereotyped by
White society.
Outside of the Southwest,
most people are largely unaware
of the Mexican's existence, but
in the Southwest, where the ma
jority of Chicanos reside, the
Anglo's encapsulated view of the
former is, more likely than not,
to conform to the above image.
Another stereotype, that of the
mustachioed and villanous Mexi
can, complete with the Bill Dana
accent, is today largely perpetu
ated through commercials and
movies. One example is the Taco
Bell advertisements carried on
many local radio stations ("I

don't got to show you no stink
ing badge"). In a recent movie,
The Professionals, one of the
main characters, Jesus Raza, fits
the classic stereotype of the vil
lanous and lecherous, but never
theless likeable, Mexican.
Neither was it uncommon in
the past to attempt to explain
certain supposed characteristics
of Mexicans by reference to cul
tural and genetic factors. A 1942
Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department report on Mexican
American juvenile delinquency
attempted to do just this. In the
1950'5, then Los Angeles Chief
of Police William Parker stated
publicly something to the effect
that one could not expect civil
ized behavior from Mexican
Americans due to the fact that
they were recently emerged
from living as wild tribes in
Mexico. Blatantly racist views
such as these, accepted wholly
and uncritically by many An
glos, culminated in the 1930's
and 1950's in massive repatria
tion drives of Mexicans back to
Mexico.
There is, on the other hand, a
diametrically opposed view of
Mexicans (but an equal distor
tion of reality), carried largely
through the meager body of re
search literature on this group.
Scholars with a romantic com
mitment to Spanish-speaking
peoples often project the image
of Mexicans as a poor, but proud
and cohesive people, uninterest
ed in the amenities which
American society has to offer to
the successful individual. In
deed, to the extent that Anglos
can regard Chicanos in compli

mentary tones, we are apt to be
seen along the lines of, "the last
romantic vestiges of a great
Spanish tradition in the South
west."
The myths and stereotypes of
the Mexican American held by
the dominant society are the re
sult of a long history of mutual
distrust and conflict between An
glos and Mexicans here in the
Southwest. Just as history texts
do not mention outright the
genocide carried out against the
American Indian in the name of
"manifest destiny," neither does
one ever hear of the violence
perpetrated against Mexicans in
the Southwest of Whites. To be
sure, Mexicans reacted in kind,
and long before Messrs. Carmi
ehael and Brown urged the arm
ing of Black people as a defense
against the White oppressor,
Mexicans did just this. In the
1850's, Anglo miners in the form
of vigillante committees helped
to round up Mexican miners un
der the guise of enforcing a
California foreign miner's li
cense tax. Some Mexicans re

sponded by becoming outlaws
and terrorizing Anglo settle
ments.
Although it appears that, at
least with respect to Mexicans,
Anglos have become more civil
ized in their behavior (the last
reported lynching of a Mexican
took place in Orange County in
the 1890's). This heritage of con
flict has continued into the twen
tieth century. In the 1930's it
was the repatriation drives, and
in the 1940's it was the "zoot
suit" riots. Today, this conflict
is largely kept alive by the
youth. In recent years, gang
warfare has been common in
many Southern California com
munities involving Mexicans and
"surfers." This type of conflict
is the theme of a new movie,
Born Wild, which portrays the
discrimination and humiliation
suffered by Mexican American
high school youth in an Anglo
dominated community.
The most tragic aspect of the
problem of stereotypes is that,
to a large extent, Mexicans ac
cept the conceptualiation of

themselves as "greasers" and
"dumb Mex." Efforts on the part
of Mexican American college
students to go back to the bar
rios and recruit Mexicans for
entry into college are often
thwarted because many of these
kids feel that they could never
make it in college. For them, a
Chicano in college is not in the
natural order of things. In fact,
it is not too speculative to sug
gest that many Mexican Ameri
can students at Stanford, for in
stance, would rather not be iden
tified as Mexicans simply be
cause their social mobility is de
pendent upon not being associ
ated with the typical "taco-bend
er." The situation is certainly
unfortunate to say the least, and
it is about time that Anglos re
cast their views of the Mexican
American and look upon him
other than in negative terms.
Finally, Mexicans for their part,
must launch a concerted attack
upon book publishers, movie
companies and other media
which continue portraying Mexi
cans in worn stereotypes. YA
BASTA!

cause their social mobility is de
pendent upon not being associ
ated with the typical "taco-bend
er." The situation is certainly
unfortunate to say the least, and
it is about time that Anglos re
cast their views of the Mexican
American and look upon him
other than in negative terms.

BASTA!
"You're so smart for a Mexi
can!" This comment, overheard
by this writer in a conversation
between a Mexican youth and
his Anglo date, aptly illustrates
the manner in which Mexican
Americans are stereotyped by
White society.
Outside of the Southwest,
most people are largely unaware
of the Mexican's existence, but
in the Southwest, where the ma
jority of Chicanos reside, the
Anglo's encapsulated view of the
former is, more likely than not,
to conform to the above image.
Another stereotype, that of the
mustachioed and villanous Mexi
can, complete with the Bill Dana
accent, is today largely perpetu
ated through commercials and
movies. One example is the Taco
Bell advertisements carried on
many local radio stations ("I

don't got to show you no stink
ing badge"). In a recent movie,
The Professionals, one of the
main characters, Jesus Raza, fits
the classic stereotype of the vil
lanous and lecherous, but never
theless likeable, Mexican.
Neither was it uncommon in
the past to attempt to explain
certain supposed characteristics
of Mexicans by reference to cul
tural and genetic factors. A 1942
Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department report on Mexican
American juvenile delinquency
attempted to do just this. In the
1950'5, then Los Angeles Chief
of Police William Parker stated
publicly something to the effect
that one could not expect civil
ized behavior from Mexican
Americans due to the fact that
they were recently emerged
from living as wild tribes in
Mexico. Blatantly racist views
such as these, accepted wholly
and uncritically by many An
glos, culminated in the 1930's
and 1950's in massive repatria
tion drives of Mexicans back to
Mexico.
There is, on the other hand, a
diametrically opposed view of
Mexicans (but an equal distor
tion of reality), carried largely
through the meager body of re
search literature on this group.
Scholars with a romantic com
mitment to Spanish-speaking
peoples often project the image
of Mexicans as a poor, but proud
and cohesive people, uninterest
ed in the amenities which
American society has to offer to
the successful individual. In
deed, to the extent that Anglos
can regard Chicanos in compli

mentary tones, we are apt to be
seen along the lines of, "the last
romantic vestiges of a great
Spanish tradition in the South
west."
The myths and stereotypes of
the Mexican American held by
the dominant society are the re
sult of a long history of mutual
distrust and conflict between An
glos and Mexicans here in the
Southwest. Just as history texts
do not mention outright the
genocide carried out against the
American Indian in the name of
"manifest destiny," neither does
one ever hear of the violence
perpetrated against Mexicans in
the Southwest of Whites. To be
sure, Mexicans reacted in kind,
and long before Messrs. Carmi
ehael and Brown urged the arm
ing of Black people as a defense
against the White oppressor,
Mexicans did just this. In the
1850's, Anglo miners in the form
of vigillante committees helped
to round up Mexican miners un
der the guise of enforcing a
California foreign miner's li
cense tax. Some Mexicans re

sponded by becoming outlaws
and terrorizing Anglo settle
ments.
Although it appears that, at
least with respect to Mexicans,
Anglos have become more civil
ized in their behavior (the last
reported lynching of a Mexican
took place in Orange County in
the 1890's). This heritage of con
flict has continued into the twen
tieth century. In the 1930's it
was the repatriation drives, and
in the 1940's it was the "zoot
suit" riots. Today, this conflict
is largely kept alive by the
youth. In recent years, gang
warfare has been common in
many Southern California com
munities involving Mexicans and
"surfers." This type of conflict
is the theme of a new movie,
Born Wild, which portrays the
discrimination and humiliation
suffered by Mexican American
high school youth in an Anglo
dominated community.
The most tragic aspect of the
problem of stereotypes is that,
to a large extent, Mexicans ac
cept the conceptualiation of

themselves as "greasers" and
"dumb Mex." Efforts on the part
of Mexican American college
students to go back to the bar
rios and recruit Mexicans for
entry into college are often
thwarted because many of these
kids feel that they could never
make it in college. For them, a
Chicano in college is not in the
natural order of things. In fact,
it is not too speculative to sug
gest that many Mexican Ameri
can students at Stanford, for in

themselves as "greasers" and
"dumb Mex." Efforts on the part
of Mexican American college
students to go back to the bar
rios and recruit Mexicans for
entry into college are often
thwarted because many of these
kids feel that they could never
make it in college. For them, a
Chicano in college is not in the
natural order of things. In fact,
it is not too speculative to sug
gest that many Mexican Ameri
can students at Stanford, for in
stance, would rather not be iden
tified as Mexicans simply be
cause their social mobility is de
pendent upon not being associ
ated with the typical "taco-bend
er." The situation is certainly
unfortunate to say the least, and
it is about time that Anglos re
cast their views of the Mexican
American and look upon him
other than in negative terms.
Finally, Mexicans for their part,
must launch a concerted attack
upon book publishers, movie
companies and other media
which continue portraying Mexi
cans in worn stereotypes. YA
BASTA!
"You're so smart for a Mexi
can!" This comment, overheard
by this writer in a conversation
between a Mexican youth and
his Anglo date, aptly illustrates
the manner in which Mexican
Americans are stereotyped by
White society.
Outside of the Southwest,
most people are largely unaware
of the Mexican's existence, but
in the Southwest, where the ma
jority of Chicanos reside, the
Anglo's encapsulated view of the
former is, more likely than not,
to conform to the above image.
Another stereotype, that of the
mustachioed and villanous Mexi
can, complete with the Bill Dana
accent, is today largely perpetu
ated through commercials and
movies. One example is the Taco
Bell advertisements carried on
many local radio stations ("I

don't got to show you no stink
ing badge"). In a recent movie,
The Professionals, one of the
main characters, Jesus Raza, fits
the classic stereotype of the vil
lanous and lecherous, but never
theless likeable, Mexican.
Neither was it uncommon in
the past to attempt to explain
certain supposed characteristics
of Mexicans by reference to cul
tural and genetic factors. A 1942
Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department report on Mexican
American juvenile delinquency
attempted to do just this. In the
1950'5, then Los Angeles Chief
of Police William Parker stated
publicly something to the effect
that one could not expect civil
ized behavior from Mexican
Americans due to the fact that
they were recently emerged
from living as wild tribes in
Mexico. Blatantly racist views
such as these, accepted wholly
and uncritically by many An
glos, culminated in the 1930's
and 1950's in massive repatria
tion drives of Mexicans back to
Mexico.
There is, on the other hand, a
diametrically opposed view of
Mexicans (but an equal distor
tion of reality), carried largely
through the meager body of re
search literature on this group.
Scholars with a romantic com
mitment to Spanish-speaking
peoples often project the image
of Mexicans as a poor, but proud
and cohesive people, uninterest
ed in the amenities which
American society has to offer to
the successful individual. In
deed, to the extent that Anglos
can regard Chicanos in compli

mentary tones, we are apt to be
seen along the lines of, "the last
romantic vestiges of a great
Spanish tradition in the South
west."
The myths and stereotypes of
the Mexican American held by
the dominant society are the re
sult of a long history of mutual
distrust and conflict between An
glos and Mexicans here in the
Southwest. Just as history texts
do not mention outright the
genocide carried out against the
American Indian in the name of
"manifest destiny," neither does
one ever hear of the violence
perpetrated against Mexicans in
the Southwest of Whites. To be
sure, Mexicans reacted in kind,
and long before Messrs. Carmi
ehael and Brown urged the arm
ing of Black people as a defense
against the White oppressor,
Mexicans did just this. In the
1850's, Anglo miners in the form
of vigillante committees helped
to round up Mexican miners un
der the guise of enforcing a
California foreign miner's li
cense tax. Some Mexicans re

sponded by becoming outlaws
and terrorizing Anglo settle
ments.
Although it appears that, at
least with respect to Mexicans,
Anglos have become more civil
ized in their behavior (the last
reported lynching of a Mexican
took place in Orange County in
the 1890's). This heritage of con
flict has continued into the twen
tieth century. In the 1930's it
was the repatriation drives, and
in the 1940's it was the "zoot
suit" riots. Today, this conflict
is largely kept alive by the
youth. In recent years, gang
warfare has been common in
many Southern California com
munities involving Mexicans and
"surfers." This type of conflict
is the theme of a new movie,
Born Wild, which portrays the
discrimination and humiliation
suffered by Mexican American
high school youth in an Anglo
dominated community.
The most tragic aspect of the
problem of stereotypes is that,
to a large extent, Mexicans ac
cept the conceptualiation of

themselves as "greasers" and
"dumb Mex." Efforts on the part
of Mexican American college
