[Half Safe
With Half
a Radio?
In these parts, an ordinary broadcast band
radio is only half a radio. Because there are
as many local stations broadcasting on FM
as on that old-fashioned AAA band, and
with different programs, too.
So if your little whatcha-may-call-it
doesn't have an FM band, come in to La
fayette and get one that does. Hear how
the other half broadcasts!
Prices start at $15.95
