# Stanford Summer Festival May Be Discontinued

### JENNY MATTHEWS 
Stanford University may become a cultural
ly barren community this summer.
According to Stephen Baffrey of the Univer
sity Relations Office, the annual Summer Fes
tival may be discontinued because of financial
difficulties.
Baffrey described the Festival which he has
produced for the past five years as "the ideal
program of cultural enlivenment of a previous
ly adyllic summer campus." Its purpose has
been to bring artists to the campus that will
both perform and lead discussions in their
various fields.
The future of the Festival is currently in
the hands of the Board of Trustees. The Board
is expected to decide at today's meeting in
San Francisco whether the University can
support another such cultural program next
summer.
The Festival is financed either by specific
donations or by the general fund "when the
budget allows," Baffrey explained.
Guarded Optimism
Baffrey is "hopeful" that the Festival will be
allowed to continue. "After five successful sea
sons," he stated, "it seems that it would be
difficult for the University to cut out the proj
ect altogether.
"On the other hand, with the current federal
cutback of funds and a tighter budget, the
University might have to dispense with the
program," he added.
"Like any other major cultural program,"
Baffrey reported, "it would be folly to think
that the summer festival could be anything
other than a deficit operation."

Last summer's deficit, however, was 80 per
cent higher than anticipated.
Sixth Coming Up
The Festival —which consists of about 110
cultural presentations in such fields as dance,
opera, contemporary music, art, drama —will
bo in its sixth year if continued.
Performers such as Ravi Shankar, the New
York Opera Company, the Preservation Hall
Jazz Band, and the New York Pro Musica are
invited to participate not only for their ability
on stage but for their potential "academic
contribution" to Stanford.
All performers in the Festival are requested
to give "additional enlightenment" to the com
munity by instructing master classes, work

shops, or by giving lectures. Since the per
formers are invited to live on campus, resi
dents also have the unique opportunity of in
formally meeting and "discussing things over
coffee" with many of the artists.
Last Summer's festival hosted 126 events to
an estimated 71,000 people.
"The Festival is very important to the uni
versity, Baffrey stated optimistically, "and the
Trustees might stick their necks out to allo
cate funds for it." Baffrey is hopeful that the
University will find donations from outside
sources.
He emphasized, however, that it is not the
wish of the Summer Festival Committee to

have the program "take priority over other
academic projects."
Only a limited amount of regular Stanford
students are able to participate in the program
because it occurs outside the regular school
year.
The Summer Festival began in 19(54, fi
nanced by an anonymous gift of $100,000 to
the university. The gift, according to Baffrey,
was "earmarked for a major celebration dur
ing the 400 th anniversary of Shakespeare."
The Shakespeare festival proved to be such a
success that "the idea of summer festivals was
continued ... in an attempt to enliven the
cultural program of the previous summer dol
drum period."

The idea of a central theme has been
dropped this year because of the "late start"
of preparation. Baffrey explained that if work
on next year's festival were almost com
pleted, and his committee were currently
working on 1970's festival, then a theme could
be chosen.
Baffrey described the lack of time as "aggra
vating." He has done "a lot of thinking, but
not enough action."
"We might bo forced to accept packages of
things — festival-type presentations already
available instead of generating up things our
selves."
"Ideally our schedule of operations would
have 19(59 all sewn up and we would be ac
tively negotiating for 1970 and 1971. As it is,
I haven't negotiated one contract for next year
yet."
A possible solution to coming financial prob
lems would be "a gift equal to the size of the
original grant." Baffrey conjectured that such
a gift "would probably be able to cover the
major core of expenses for the next two or
three seasons." The University shoulders some
of the expenses through the furnishing of per
formance halls, press releases, and publicity.
Baffrey admitted that it is "possible to break
even because of the way the budget is
planned."
"If we sell every ticket to every event," Baf
frey explained, "we will break completely even
—no deficit, no profit. It is obvious that we
aren't ever going to do that, but someday I'd
love to see it happen."
States; it has previously stood
011 par with most of the festivals
in Europe."
Baffrey feels obligated to pre
sent quality performers that
will instill "excitement In the
community."
As a result, other campus pro
duction groups are considerably
"dwarfed" during the summer
by the festival's productions.
"We are essentially given free
reign . . . Other potential pro
ducers are usually inactive at
that time.
Although many previous per
formers will be rescheduled, if
the '69 Festival materializes,
Baffrey admitted that "we don't
like to repeat acts even though
they are very popular. Our goal
is to appeal to popular demands,
but at the same time add new
dimensions to the culture of the
community . . . Repetition
would make the festival some
what less than innovative."
"Sometimes we repeat the
same acts if they are creating
new things," he stated.
Baffrey enthusiastically appre
ciates his position as producer
of the festival as a "good oppor
tunity to keep current with
things going on in the Univer
sity and to get involved with
them." Although he is con
cerned primarily with the hu
manities departments in his
planning, Baffrey remarked that

he is usually given "large sup
port" for the festival from the
science areas.
"We are extremely pleased,
BafTrey concluded, to have been
able to touch base with the vari
ous tastes of the community . . .
We have so far touched every
major form of art with our pre
sentations. Through a wide
range of cultural events, we aim
to please the broad spectrum of
the community."
Baffery expressed his delight
that the Summer Festival Com
mittee, composed of heads of in
volved departments, has been
adventurous" in the booking of
unusual performers.
He believes that Stanford's
fest. is "by far the best such
cultural program in the United
States.
