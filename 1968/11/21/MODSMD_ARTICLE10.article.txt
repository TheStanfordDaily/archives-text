# "LET THEM EAT CAKE"
## 
### 
Four years ago a group of enterprising stu
dents undertook the creation of the Stanford
Management Intern Program. The program was
begun as an attempt to break down what pres
ent Director Brooke Seawell calls the "big busi
ness stereotype" by offering students summer
jobs and giving them first-hand experience in
business.
The program has since developed rapidly
and at present has many more candidates for
summer positions than can possibly be placed.
At its inception the program was available to
all undergraduates, though liberal arts students
were preferred. Judgments were also made on
"academic ability, interest and initiative, ability
to write and speak well, and suitability of char
acter and personality."
Since that time one other characteristic has
been added—much to the detriment of the en
tire program.
The present criteria include the implicit de
mand that applicants be "higher income brack
et" students. As Seawell put it last week, living
expenses offset summer salaries and make profit
prohibitive. You chalk it up to experience.

What this has done is to create a program
available only to a certain segment of the stu
dent body—namely those who needn't worry
about summer earnings. It quite effectively cuts
off students who must work during the summer
to pay educational expenses.
The result has been that the image of imper
sonal and profiteering business still lingers, and
is probably reinforced among many of those
students who have disqualified themselves be
cause of financial need.
We suggest the program, if it is sincerely in
terested in the goals it professes, make an ef
fort to involve as many as possible by imple
menting a system whereby students are not
eliminated on the basis of financial status.
We realize it may be difficult to convince the
hiring companies that it is worth their while
to pay an intern a little more than usual to en
able him to work with them. But American
business will never be able to break out of its
upper-middle-class mentality unless it interests
some new, and at the moment economically
poorer, blood.
