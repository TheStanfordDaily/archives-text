# BEAT CAL
## The

### JOHNIE SCOTT 
Proclaimed "King of the Afri
can Kongos," drummer Big
Black and his entire group are
to converge upon Stanford this
Sunday afternoon for a BSU
sponsored "Jazz Casual" that
promises to be quite an affair
after so many weeks of tedium,
frustration, oppression, and cul
tural castration.
Ordinarily, this column would
not dwell upon anybody's musi
cal event (not from my presup
posed sense of fair play, but my
distaste at having to turn down
the offers of other interest
groups who would like to have
me plug their socials. Liken my
reflections to Prufrock's in such
instances, "In and out the Peo
ple go, talking of Michael
angelo.").
But BIG BLACK is something
different, someone wonderful.
Adjectives, metaphors, similes
have to all be thrown out of the
window where his sound, his
musical concepts, his rhythmic
heritage originates. (And if I
sound tired it is only because 1
am entering my "third day with
out sleep," being up all of these
hours playing catch-up with
where the classes were two,
three weeks ago.).
He forces you to turn your
body energies into the world and
sensibilities of colored peoples
(that is, the force as it affects
whites). To be able to accom
plish this turning-on is quite a
feat, something I can witness to
personally from my own experi
ences when giving poetry read
ings in the strangest places

(from back houses in Watts to
Chino State Prison^.
White People, and I refer con
sciously to the White Boys and
White Girls too caught up in
couth and veneer (to whom
Jackie Onassis is now a very
wealthy Virgin Mary, and so no
body to be sneered upon) to
ever manage a twitching in their
asses so that the Twist took a
long time to really catch on but
Lord when it did it seemed like
it would never go out of style
(meanwhile, we were in dark
places doing the Bounce, Hully
Gully, Slop, Bop, Boogie).
BIG BLACK Is an event well
worth taking your girlfriend to
see (and it works both ways, if
Dutch-treat is the thing, or your
money happens to be short, how
ever it comes down). His rhy
thms, born of hands that rise
and fall no more than inches,
fractions of inches, from the
drumskins, will fascinate, in
trigue, and even frighten (which
should not dismay anyone, after
all, when was the last time any
of you were ever able to go
check out The Supremes, The
Miracles, The Temptations.).
He is no classic, or typical,
Motown show (every bead of
sweat right in place, not one
strand of that processed hair
out of place—but then again, so
did Sugar Ray Robinson look
after every classic exhibition he
indulged the fight fans in, pugs
like Carmen Basilio bleeding
like gored pigs at the fight's end
while the Sugar Man tamped
down his "do").

Color exudes and surrounds
the show (again, once again,
cheek the Man out this Sunday
and find out. BIG BLACK is a
cultural hero, he is our Ariel
keeping watch from the highest
point in the heavens on the
movements and feelings of those
below). In fact, the Stanford De
partment of Music should make
it mandatory for music majors
to attend his performance, see
ing as how white kids seldom
have the chance to enter the
ghetto for anything approaching
his virtuosity.
(But here, I have to stop. I
would be doing BSU a disservice
were I to continue in providing
reasons for the white folks to
check the Brother out. I would
be doing You White Folks a dis
service and a slur were I to con
tinue as anybody's or anyone's
conga-beating afficionado. I
would be doing my own self the
Ultimate Disservice — "When
Great men speak, Small Men
should be silent and listen.")
Check this out for a minute.
When a cat is doing his thing,
and ain't worried too much
about what you or me or any
of us is thinking in our heads,
he warrants more of a look
than that simple one which
goes under the name of another
Miles Davis bag (playing with
your back to the audience, if
they dig what you're doing, then
fine. If they don't, then to hell
with them. Miles got into many
a thump with dissatisfied cus
tomers over this one small
item).
BIGBLACKis not "Third-
Stream Jazz." He is not the
MJQ, Fresh Cream's Ginger
Baker, or one more Max Roach
from back home. Though from
Harlem, though his typical
dress is African garb (this, long
before dashikis became the
"hip" thing to wear out in the
public, when to express your
self when you were black was
to quickly attract the label of
madman, mystic). At the same
time, one cannot truthfully de
scribe his playing as typical of
the avant-garde.
Nobody goes to see BIG
BLACK only to walk away from
the show talking about how
"that cat ain't doing nothing no
different than any hundred oth

er cats I done dug blowing some
skins!" Do you think that this
man, who has such tremendous
personal warmth and love (a
perfect complement to that omi
nous stage-presence he com
mands/projects), would have
gotten this far without being
into something totally together!
Let's make sense!
I said before that it would be
groove to see someone "Offi
cial," as opposed to officious,
fxom the Department of Music
there to see and welcome BIG
BLACK to Stanford and Dinkel
spiel Sunday afternoon. But
there fire other peoples and
types who should make a point
of being there.
The "Racism and Prejudice"
people, it goes without a wink,
ought to be in the first rows.
Those fellows upstairs in the
Administration (Old Union, En
cina Hall, etc.), since you pro
fess to have so much interest in
wanting to know what "this
Black Cultural Movement" is all
about, it naturally follows that
All of You be there. Why not?
You'll buy tickets for BIG
GAME years before cleat ever
tears up turf!
Those folk who profess to
have such an interest in rede
fining "what it means to be a
conservative" have no right to
absent themselves. If this is your
school, aw, all I can say is that
I get sick and tired of prosti
tuting my people's art for the
sake of your vanities (You, Egg
head, who was never gifted. No,
you only possessed solid ground
ing in how to do homework most
efficiently, more efficiently than
98 per cent of your fellow peers
across the land, so that you
could come to Stanford near
about when you damn well
pleased).
I speak to the Harvey Hukar
is, the Tim Haights, the ARENA
people, those from the fraterni
ties but most of all, to the girls.
For it is you (Girls), finally, who
stand to have the greatest treat.
There for you on that stage Sun
day will be somebody who has
always known poverty in spite
of his gift yet who still plays.
Lay aside that microbiology and
freshman English for a while
and have some fun for a couple
of hours. You owe it to your
selves!
