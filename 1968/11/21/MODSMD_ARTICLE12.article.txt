Editor, THE DAILY:
Margie Wolf's front page
November 12 article on Glenn
Campbell and the Hoover Insti
tute was inadequate in many
ways. Nonetheless, it success
fully reflected some of the
symptoms of the malaise which
docs in fact afflict the distin
guished institution housed in
that architecturally sterile mon
ument to the genitals and geni
us of Herbert Hoover.
No one can challenge the fact
that the Hoover Library is one
of the great archival libraries
in the world, in spite of the con
tinual identity crisis it seems to
suffer. But the greatness of such
an institution cannot be mea
sured solely in terms of the
number of archives it possesses
or the amount of money it
raises for continuing expansion
—areas of success for which Mr.
Campbell is largely responsible
and justifiably proud. The true
greatness of any institution is
based on its spiritual or philo
sophical foundations. These
foundations are unfortunately
weak at the Hoover.
Conceived in the conservative,
pre-depression philosophy of
Herbert Hoover, the library that
bears his name has never suc
cessfully risen above or gone
beyond the associations which
identify with that philosophy.

The well-publicized words and
actions of Mr. Campbell are the
most outstanding and convinc
ing proof of this assertion. The
predomoinant attitude of the
staff and research fellows at the
Hoover, some of whom seem to
have never reconciled them
selves to the events of 1917, if
not to those of 1789, is further
persuasive evidence for this con
clusion. Footnotes are hardly
necessary here.
The "out-of-touehness" which
Mr. Campbell apparently feels
with regard to students is but
a microcosmic reflection of the
general remoteness of the Hoo
ver in relation to the social and
political realities of 1968. Mr.
Campbell has no one to blame
but himself for this situation.
Indeed, he has actively encour
aged it by his position as Regent
and his proud association with
Raffertys and Reagans. Simul
taneously, he has withdrawn in
to the top of the Tower from a
world whose complexities he is
no longer able to comprehend—
a world whose students have
"legitimate grievances," but to
which Mr. Campbell and his as
sociates on the Board of Regents
apparently have no creative re
sponse.
The ultimate irony is that Mr.
Campbell embodies the anti
thesis of his own ideal: that in

academic institutions there
should be a balance between "in
volvement and academic objec
tivity." One hopes that this para
dox is the result of a lack of
awareness rather than hypocrisy
on his part. If he would realize
his ideal it seems there are only
two alternatives open: to resign
as Director of the Hoover Insti
tute and devote full time to the
problems of the Board of
Regents and thus accept full re
sponsibility for the political in
volvement this office implies, or
to resign his position as Regent
and devote himseLf to trying to
mold the Hoover into a genuine
reflection of all shades of politi
cal philosophy, rather than en
couraging its reputation as the
last bastion of arch-consevatism.
Perhaps the latter alternative
is akin to proposing that an
elephant trade in his trunk for
an asses' tail. Nevertheless,
something of this sort is neces
sary if the Hoover is to achieve
its full potential as a uniquely
endowed institution where aca
demic objectivity and involve
ment serve as a generating froce
of new ideas capable of respond
ing to the complex and contin
ually changing problems of our
times.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The undersigned members of
Soto House protest most em
phatically The Daily article of
October 18 about us.
What "Soto problems" the
administrators may have had
have stemmed entirely from in
flexible and oppressive policies
foisted on university residences
in the past. The so-called "crea
tivists," who would otherwise
live off campus, have attacked
these policies by peaceful
means, the Food Service and
Business Office being notable ex
amples. Your reporter "noted
"nothing unique . . ." but ". . .
the residents" because the Hous
ing Office has successfully de
molished or blocked any crea
tive project that has or would
have distinguished the house.
Your allegations as to illegal
drug usage in the house are
fanciful in the extreme. Soto Is
not and never has been a hash
ishin sanctuary.
Finally, if you find more than
46 signatures on this letter our
lack of a "governing structure"
makes it a House Resolution
and you may consider your
selves officially censured on be
half of the Praesidium of the
People's Will. If not., only the
activists are out for you.
