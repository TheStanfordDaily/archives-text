Class I-Y and Class FV-F
Selective Service Regulations
state: "In Class I-Y shall be
placed any registrant who . . .
would be classified in Class I-A,
Class I-A-O, or Class I-O but for
the fact that he is found under
applicable physical, mental, and
moral standards to be not cur
rently qualified for service in
the Armed Forces and who
would be qualified for such ser
vice in time of war or national
emergency declared by the Con
gress."
A registrant shall be placed in
Class IV-F if he is unqualified
under any conditions. An indi
vidual placed in Class I-Y may
be reexamined periodically. Re
examination will depend upon
the discretion of the local board
concerning the nature of the
condition.
Two steps should be followed
in establishing that an individ
ual, in fact, has a disqualifying
physical or mental condition or
defect. First, the registrant
should provide his local board
all information relevant to this
condition or defect.
Second, the registrant should
secure the judgment of the Se
lective Service System by spe
cifically claiming in writing
that he feels that the condition
makes him unacceptable for
military service. The local
board, the pre-induction physi
cal, or the induction physical
may find him unacceptable for
military service.
With respect to informing the
local board of the condition, the
registrant should remember
that "each classified registrant
. . . shall within 10 days after
it occurs, report to the local
board in writing any fact that
might result in the registrant
being placed in a different clas
sification, such as . . . any
change in his . . . physical con
dition."
With respect to physical con
dition, the registrant is advised
to provide all relevant informa
tion, which may include X-rays,
doctors' statements, and any
other accounting of the prob
lem. Objective medical informa
tion, along with interpretation
by an expert (M.D.), is desir
able.

It is very important that the
doctor make specific statements
as to how the registrant's phys
ical condition or defect might
make it impossible for him to
take part in certain activities.
Once the information is in the
registrant's file, the board may,
on its own motion, consider the
information and reclassify the
registrant. Or the registrant
may initiate action to see that
this information is given full
consideration.
An important step in insur
ing full consideration of the po
tentially disqualifying condition
or defect may be an interview
with the medical adviser to the
local board. The importance of
the medical history in the folder
becomes evident in light of the
limitation placed on the medical
adviser. "The medical adviser
shall make only such examina
tion as he deems necessary. . . .
No laboratory or X-ray work

shall be authorized, but reports
of laboratory or X-ray work
performed previously and pre
sented by the registrant may be
given consideration."
The registrant should be
aware that if following the in
terview with the medical ad
viser the registrant is not de
termined to be unacceptable, the
local board should then sched
ule him for a pre - induction
physical.
If the registrant presents new
medical information after the
pre - induction physical, the
board should send that informa
tion to an Examining Station
for evaluation.
In the event that all procc
dures have been pursued
through the Selective Service
System and the registrant still
feels that his situation has been
mishandled, he may then wish
to write to the Surgeon Gen
eral's office.
