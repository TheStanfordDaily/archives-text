# 'Clively' Films
## Prof Fosters Flicks 
### BROOKE SHEARER 
Father of the freshman film
series and campus idol in his
own right, Clive Miller dreams
of converting Geology Room
320, site of his bi-weekly mov
ies, into a real theater with a
children's section, matrons pa
trolling the aisles, and couples
making out in the back row.
"I would like to hire new
couples each week," Miller com
ments in his thick New York
accent.
Born Clive Trepel Miller in
Brooklyn on May 4, 1938, he
moved from PS 139 as a second
grader to attend the Adelphi
Academy. In 1959 he entered
Harvard University. Hero his
early career as a child prodigy
culminated in the publication of
his first novel, "This Passing
Night."
Miller came to Stanford with
his wife, the former Sophia
Dhimitri, in 1966 after three
years in Europe. He taught
English as a member of Voice
Project, a government - spon
sored program in experimental
teaching. He is now working on
his second novel while teaching
several freshman English
classes and managing his film
series.
"There was a fundamental
condescension to Hollywood
movies which I didn't like," Mil

ler asserts, explaining what pro
voked him to start his film se
ries.
"At the time I began showing
flicks only foreign films were
being shown on the campus.
Students had no sense of cur
rent culture. This is especially
unfortunate in California where
everything was built a couple of
days ago and will last only a
couple more. Students had no
idea of the development of Hol
lywood films. Good God, they
had never heard of Mae West.
Complete Put-on
"Every movie today is a com
plete put - on," Miller added.
"Take 'Alice B. Toklas,' for ex
ample. There's a great distance
between the audience and the
actors. The audience is totally
uninvolvod. No risk is taken.
There's real discomfort from
any stated emotion. The audi
ence's reaction has become to
tally intellectual and acutely
cynical."
The films which Miller has
run have ranged from W. C.
Fields and Alfred Hitchcock
flicks to those featuring the
Marx brothers and Fred As
taire.
"But I enjoy the movies from
the '30's more than any others,"
he says. "These movies are
unpretentious, unselfconscious
works of art. The French direc

tors, Truffaut and Goddard,
learned everything they know
from these Hollywood produc
tions. I believe they inadver
tently intelleetualized films."
Folk Rock Repla***, Flicks
Miller believes that folk rock
music has taken the place of the
movies. "Kids immerse them
selves in Jimmy Hendricks' mu
sic as we did in Judy Garland's
films. They know the names and
the styles of each of the musi
cians; we knew the costume de
signers and the big producers."
Miller does the research,
writes up the programs for each
week's frosh film, and chooses
the movies.
As a part of his cinematic pol
icy he demands that the Fresh
man Flicks be free. "As kids
when we went to the movies we
didn't pay. Our parents did. You
have a totally different reaction
to a film when you pay five
dollars a couple or even a quar
ter."
The sense of community that
has grown up around Clive Mil
ler's film series is rare at Stan
ford. Students wonder what will
replace him and his films after
he leaves this winter. "Perhaps
the coffee house," he muses.

Bennion as McCann appear in Harold Pinter's disturbing contempo

Miller came to Stanford with
his wife, the former Sophia
Dhimitri, in 1966 after three
years in Europe. He taught
English as a member of Voice
Project, a government - spon
sored program in experimental
teaching. He is now working on
his second novel while teaching
several freshman English
classes and managing his film
series.
"There was a fundamental
condescension to Hollywood
movies which I didn't like," Mil

ler asserts, explaining what pro
voked him to start his film se
ries.
"At the time I began showing
flicks only foreign films were
being shown on the campus.
Students had no sense of cur
rent culture. This is especially
unfortunate in California where
everything was built a couple of
days ago and will last only a
couple more. Students had no
idea of the development of Hol
lywood films. Good God, they
had never heard of Mae West.
Complete Put-on
"Every movie today is a com
plete put - on," Miller added.
"Take 'Alice B. Toklas,' for ex
ample. There's a great distance
between the audience and the
actors. The audience is totally
uninvolvod. No risk is taken.
There's real discomfort from
any stated emotion. The audi
ence's reaction has become to
tally intellectual and acutely
cynical."
The films which Miller has
run have ranged from W. C.
Fields and Alfred Hitchcock
flicks to those featuring the
Marx brothers and Fred As
taire.
"But I enjoy the movies from
the '30's more than any others,"
he says. "These movies are
unpretentious, unselfconscious
works of art. The French direc

tors, Truffaut and Goddard,
learned everything they know
from these Hollywood produc
tions. I believe they inadver
tently intelleetualized films."
Folk Rock Repla***, Flicks
Miller believes that folk rock
music has taken the place of the
movies. "Kids immerse them
selves in Jimmy Hendricks' mu
sic as we did in Judy Garland's
films. They know the names and
the styles of each of the musi
cians; we knew the costume de
signers and the big producers."
Miller does the research,
writes up the programs for each
week's frosh film, and chooses
the movies.
As a part of his cinematic pol
icy he demands that the Fresh
man Flicks be free. "As kids
when we went to the movies we
didn't pay. Our parents did. You
have a totally different reaction
to a film when you pay five
dollars a couple or even a quar
ter."
The sense of community that
has grown up around Clive Mil
ler's film series is rare at Stan
ford. Students wonder what will
replace him and his films after
he leaves this winter. "Perhaps
the coffee house," he muses.
