# Grad Association Defines Goals For Improvement
## 
### 
The ASSU Graduate Student
Association has defined three
basic goals this year for the
improvement of graduate edu
cation and student life at Stan
ford.
These goals consist of:

• Communicating the special
needs of graduate students to
the administration, and to our
individual departments and
schools.
• Improving universty ser
vices for graduate students.

• Sponsoring activities to in
crease intellectual and social
contact between members of
different departments.
The Association will be spon
soring luncheon debates, discus
sion groups and social get-to
gethers. Included are the Friday
afternoon TGIF parties and Fri
day night Discotheques at the
I-Center, co-sponsored by the
International Association.
The Association is also plan
ning a series of university fo
rums on topics such as prob
lems and prospects of American
graduate education, recruiting
of minority students for grad
uate work at Stanford, the role
of the graduate student in uni
versity teaching, and university
governance.
New ideas to be considered in
clude a fall orientation program
for new graduate students and
a graduate newsletter.
According to Barry Askinas,
chairman of ASSU Graduate
Association, these proposed
steps toward improvement of
graduate education have met
met with some difficulty.
"In our discussions with
prominent University adminis
trators, Askinas explained,
"we have found them sympa
thetic, but in general unwilling
to make commitments toward
solutions of major problems.
Improvement of graduate edu
cation seems to be on the bot
tom of the University's list of
priorities. The so-called financial
crisis in the University is often
used as an excuse for inaction."
