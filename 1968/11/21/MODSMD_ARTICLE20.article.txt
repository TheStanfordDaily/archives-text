Rumors that the San Fran
cisco 49ers of the National
Football League might play
their home games next season
in Stanford Stadium were
squelched yesterday by the ath
letic department.
"There is no chance that the
49ers will play any regular sea
son games at Stanford," de
clared Chuck Taylor, director of
athletics.
The 49ers, who have an
nounced publicly their dissatis
facton wth the inadequate fa
cilities at Kezar Stadium in
Golden Gate Park, are current
ly looking for a new home
somewhere in the Bay Area.
Aside from Candlestick Park
which would require $7-10 mil
lion in renovation, Stanford
Stadium is the only facility in
the area which seats more than
50,000, the approximate mini
mum required by the NFL.
The 49ers have made no spe
cific inquiry about the use of
Stanford Stadium but have em
ployed Optimum Systems Inc.,
a Palo Alto research firm, to
study possibilities throughout
the bay Area.
"There are just too many

problems with the University—
like taxes and assessors," Tay
lor said concerning the use of
the Stanford facility. There is a
possibility that income from
professional sources might en
danger the University's tax ben
efits as an educational institu
tion.
"Besides," Taylor added, "we
would be cutting our own

throats. The entertainment dol
lar would be split too man]
ways," referring to the imme
diate area.


STRATEGY MEETING —Coach ,lohn Ralston talks to quarterback
Don Bunce during the Washington game, in which Bunee flred two
touchdown passes and scored a third after Jim Plunkett's injury.
Ralston wouldn't mind getting three touchdowns Saturday against
California —from each of his quarterbacks.
