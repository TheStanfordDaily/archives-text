# Ralston Looks Toward 'Best Game'
## 
### 
Darby, Gary Fowler, and John
McGafTle.
The pass combination of
Humphries to Wayne Stewart
is what killed us last year. This
season Humphries has kept
their drives going with passes
to Stewart and Paul Williams.
They've used Williams very ef
fectively on the Hanker reverse
play. Every game he's come
close to breaking loose.
Q. Will the home field lie
any advantage to Cal?
It won't make much differ
ence Saturday. Normally you
figure that the home team has
a six - point advantage. But it
should be cut down to two or
three points in this case.
Q. It goes without saying
that both teams will be up
for the game, and since It fig
ures to be a very close game,
do you tliiuk tliat breaks will
be decisive?
Always. In a close game the
breaks are always decisive since
momentum comes from those
breaks. One thing Cal has been
able to do all year is maintain
the momentum once they've
gotten ahead. They have an ex
cellent kicking game, and this
has been a key factor.
Q. Right now Stanford ls
5-3-1. A win would make your
record an impressive 6-3-1, but
a loss would drop it to 5-4-1.
Will this game determine
whether or not the season
has been a success?
This is a better team thar, a

Daily Spurts Editor Gary Ca
valli talked with head football
coach John Ralston yesterday.
Here is their conversation:
Q. Saturday's same has
been hilled as a contest Im>-
twe*'ii Cal's defense —one of
the best in the nation —and
Stanford*' offense — which is
the best in the conference.
With this in mind, do you feel
the game will hinge on how
well Stanford's pass protec
tion holds up, and how well
you establish a running
game?
That will definitely be a fac
tor, but you have to look at two
different games. Our offense
versus their defense could turn
out to be a stalemate, so their
offense against our defense may
well decide the ballgame.
What will Stanford have
to do defensively to win Sat
urday?
We'll have to stop the roll
out running and passing of
their quarterback, Randy Hum
phries. He's played very well
this year. They also have three
good running backs — Bob

5-3-1 record iridcates. We've
really only gotten beaten once,
against Oregon Statp. We built
up too much for that game with
USC, and then went flat for
three weeks. I'm confident, that
if we could play those four
games over we'd win at least
three of them.
The success of the entire sea
son depends on this game. Of
course you're striving for the
8-1-1, or the 9-1, or the 10-0 sea
son, but 6-3-1 in this conference
isn't bad. We have not had a
losing season in live years. Sat
urday we should be prepared to
play our best game of the sea
son.
Q. What kind of physical
shape Ls the team In?
Jack Lasater (split end) is the
only one who's still out We
can't run the risk of playing
him and having the shoulder se
riously damaged. Our tight ends
are both back. Bob Moore
looked very strong in practice
last night and he'll start. Ron
Kadziel is fit to play.
We're a little worried about
Greg Broughton (fullback), who

got a charley horse Saturday.
He will probably start but if not
Jon Huss, 11m Abena and Jack
Alustiza are all capable replace
ments. We've been real pleased
with the play of Alustiza the
past couple of days.
Q. Is Bubba Brown ready
to go? If so, will he or Howie
Williams start at halfback?
Brown ran real well in scrim
mage last night. Williams, who
has done a great job the past
two weeks, will start, with

Bubba backing him up. Brown
will sec plenty of action, though.
Q. Sophomore quarterback
-Flm Plunkett will undoubted
ly be under gTeat pressure
Saturday from the Cal defen
sive line. How well do yon
think he'll hold up under the
pressure?
We're banking on a good,
solid performance from Plun
kett Saturday. You cant' say
enough about the way he's
played this year.

two weeks, will start, with

Bubba backing him up. Brown
will sec plenty of action, though.
Q. Sophomore quarterback
-Flm Plunkett will undoubted
ly be under gTeat pressure
Saturday from the Cal defen
sive line. How well do yon
think he'll hold up under the
pressure?
We're banking on a good,
solid performance from Plun
kett Saturday. You cant' say
enough about the way he's
played this year.
Darby, Gary Fowler, and John
McGafTle.
The pass combination of
Humphries to Wayne Stewart
is what killed us last year. This
season Humphries has kept
their drives going with passes
to Stewart and Paul Williams.
They've used Williams very ef
fectively on the Hanker reverse
play. Every game he's come
close to breaking loose.
Q. Will the home field lie
any advantage to Cal?
It won't make much differ
ence Saturday. Normally you
figure that the home team has
a six - point advantage. But it
should be cut down to two or
three points in this case.
Q. It goes without saying
that both teams will be up
for the game, and since It fig
ures to be a very close game,
do you tliiuk tliat breaks will
be decisive?
Always. In a close game the
breaks are always decisive since
momentum comes from those
breaks. One thing Cal has been
able to do all year is maintain
the momentum once they've
gotten ahead. They have an ex
cellent kicking game, and this
has been a key factor.
Q. Right now Stanford ls
5-3-1. A win would make your
record an impressive 6-3-1, but
a loss would drop it to 5-4-1.
Will this game determine
whether or not the season
has been a success?
This is a better team thar, a

Daily Spurts Editor Gary Ca
valli talked with head football
coach John Ralston yesterday.
Here is their conversation:
Q. Saturday's same has
been hilled as a contest Im>-
twe*'ii Cal's defense —one of
the best in the nation —and
Stanford*' offense — which is
the best in the conference.
With this in mind, do you feel
the game will hinge on how
well Stanford's pass protec
tion holds up, and how well
you establish a running
game?
That will definitely be a fac
tor, but you have to look at two
different games. Our offense
versus their defense could turn
out to be a stalemate, so their
offense against our defense may
well decide the ballgame.
What will Stanford have
to do defensively to win Sat
urday?
We'll have to stop the roll
out running and passing of
their quarterback, Randy Hum
phries. He's played very well
this year. They also have three
good running backs — Bob

5-3-1 record iridcates. We've
really only gotten beaten once,
against Oregon Statp. We built
up too much for that game with
USC, and then went flat for
three weeks. I'm confident, that
if we could play those four
games over we'd win at least
three of them.
The success of the entire sea
son depends on this game. Of
course you're striving for the
8-1-1, or the 9-1, or the 10-0 sea
son, but 6-3-1 in this conference
isn't bad. We have not had a
losing season in live years. Sat
urday we should be prepared to
play our best game of the sea
son.
Q. What kind of physical
shape Ls the team In?
Jack Lasater (split end) is the
only one who's still out We
can't run the risk of playing
him and having the shoulder se
riously damaged. Our tight ends
are both back. Bob Moore
looked very strong in practice
last night and he'll start. Ron
Kadziel is fit to play.
We're a little worried about
Greg Broughton (fullback), who

got a charley horse Saturday.
He will probably start but if not
Jon Huss, 11m Abena and Jack
Alustiza are all capable replace
ments. We've been real pleased
with the play of Alustiza the
past couple of days.
Q. Is Bubba Brown ready
to go? If so, will he or Howie
Williams start at halfback?
Brown ran real well in scrim
mage last night. Williams, who
has done a great job the past
two weeks, will start, with

Bubba backing him up. Brown
will sec plenty of action, though.

got a charley horse Saturday.
He will probably start but if not
Jon Huss, 11m Abena and Jack
Alustiza are all capable replace
ments. We've been real pleased
with the play of Alustiza the
past couple of days.
Q. Is Bubba Brown ready
to go? If so, will he or Howie
Williams start at halfback?
Brown ran real well in scrim
mage last night. Williams, who
has done a great job the past
two weeks, will start, with

Bubba backing him up. Brown
will sec plenty of action, though.
Q. Sophomore quarterback
-Flm Plunkett will undoubted
ly be under gTeat pressure
Saturday from the Cal defen
sive line. How well do yon
think he'll hold up under the
pressure?
We're banking on a good,
solid performance from Plun
kett Saturday. You cant' say
enough about the way he's
played this year.
Darby, Gary Fowler, and John
McGafTle.
The pass combination of
Humphries to Wayne Stewart
is what killed us last year. This
season Humphries has kept
their drives going with passes
to Stewart and Paul Williams.
They've used Williams very ef
fectively on the Hanker reverse
play. Every game he's come
close to breaking loose.
Q. Will the home field lie
any advantage to Cal?
It won't make much differ
ence Saturday. Normally you
figure that the home team has
a six - point advantage. But it
should be cut down to two or
three points in this case.
Q. It goes without saying
that both teams will be up
for the game, and since It fig
ures to be a very close game,
do you tliiuk tliat breaks will
be decisive?
Always. In a close game the
breaks are always decisive since
momentum comes from those
breaks. One thing Cal has been
able to do all year is maintain
the momentum once they've
gotten ahead. They have an ex
cellent kicking game, and this
has been a key factor.
Q. Right now Stanford ls
5-3-1. A win would make your
record an impressive 6-3-1, but
a loss would drop it to 5-4-1.
Will this game determine
whether or not the season
has been a success?
This is a better team thar, a

Daily Spurts Editor Gary Ca
valli talked with head football
coach John Ralston yesterday.
Here is their conversation:
Q. Saturday's same has
been hilled as a contest Im>-
twe*'ii Cal's defense —one of
the best in the nation —and
Stanford*' offense — which is
the best in the conference.
With this in mind, do you feel
the game will hinge on how
well Stanford's pass protec
tion holds up, and how well
you establish a running
game?
That will definitely be a fac
tor, but you have to look at two
different games. Our offense
versus their defense could turn
out to be a stalemate, so their
offense against our defense may
well decide the ballgame.
What will Stanford have
to do defensively to win Sat
urday?
We'll have to stop the roll
out running and passing of
their quarterback, Randy Hum
phries. He's played very well
this year. They also have three
good running backs — Bob

5-3-1 record iridcates. We've
really only gotten beaten once,
against Oregon Statp. We built
up too much for that game with
USC, and then went flat for
three weeks. I'm confident, that
if we could play those four
games over we'd win at least
three of them.
The success of the entire sea
son depends on this game. Of
course you're striving for the
8-1-1, or the 9-1, or the 10-0 sea
son, but 6-3-1 in this conference
isn't bad. We have not had a
losing season in live years. Sat
urday we should be prepared to
play our best game of the sea
son.
Q. What kind of physical
shape Ls the team In?
Jack Lasater (split end) is the
only one who's still out We
can't run the risk of playing
him and having the shoulder se
riously damaged. Our tight ends
are both back. Bob Moore
looked very strong in practice
last night and he'll start. Ron
Kadziel is fit to play.
