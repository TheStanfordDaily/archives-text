## Troubled Campus Reopens 
### MARSHALL E. SCHWARTZ 
SAN FRANCISCO—San Fran
cisco State College opened its
doors again yesterday—more or
less.
After being closed since last
Thursday, classes were ordered
to resume by school President

Robert D. Smith, after receiv
ing an edict from an emergency
session of the State College
Board of Trustees Tuesday.
But few of those students
who decided to go to class—the
strike originally called by the
Black Student Union (BSU) is
still on—found teachers there.
Open Discussion
Because the Academic Senate
voted Tuesday night to hold an
open discussion between fac
ulty, administrators, and dissi
dent studentsi nstead of teach
ing classes.
Some professors went against
the decision, however, so a few
classes met.
But most of the day—from 10

a.m. until 4 p.m., with a break
for lunch—was spent discussing
the issues that caused the stu
dent strike and closed the cam
pus for nearly a week.
Hundreds of professors and
students filled the main audi
torium to hear the panel as
thousands of other students
watched the meeting on closed
circuit television.
Identifying Contradictions
In the words of Jack Alexis,
a BSU leader, it was a day of
"identifying the contradictions"
that have caused all the prob
lems on the troubled campus.
And the contradictions and
hang-ups seemed to be clear to
almost all of the audience by
the time the day was over. But
it appeared that the administra
tion was boxed in by traditional
positions and traditional views
—and really couldn't see what it
was all about.
And this may be the biggest
problem San Francisco State
has.
Two major theses about the
restructuring of the college
emerged from yesterday's dia
logue—which resumes at 10 this
morning, with classes again be

ing held at the option of the in
structor.
Superficial Solutions
But President Smith and his
staff seemingly failed to grasp
these points, merely offering su
perficial solutions to the present
obstacles.
And if this inability to see to
the heart of the issues contin
ues, SF State may be headed for
an even bigger crisis than the
one that presently exists.
The two basic ideas that were
brought out were changing the
focus of today's urban univer
sity, and giving minority group
students control of their own
programs.
The black and third world
students made it clear — al
though not stating it directly—
that the traditional concept of
the university as a place for the
preservation and furthering of
human knowledge is not appli
cable to today's college, espe
cially an urban institution.
'Regear' University
As Joseph White, dean of un
dergraduate education and a
black, said, the university must
be "regeared" to face the world
outside.
The position of the minority
students is simple: the school
must step out of its academic
cocoon and take a hand in re
dressing the social ills that
abound in the society—the real
world—around it.
The proposed means to this
end is the establishment of an
ethnic studies program. But the
gap between the third world
students and the administration
lies in their differing concepts
of the program.
Task Force Established
Smith and his staff fully sup
port the idea of "ethnic studies."
In fact, the Academic Senate
has established a task force to
study the question.
But students want the courses
directed toward today's prob
lems—and how to solve them.
Past history is of no importance
to them unless it helps them
understand today's conflicts.
The other question is control
of the content of black studies
courses. The trustees have ap
proved the establishment of a
Black Studies Department for
next fall, but the BSU wants it
instituted now.
There may be many road
blocks to peace before the pres
ent conflict is finally settled.
