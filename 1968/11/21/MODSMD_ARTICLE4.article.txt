# Richard Lyman
## "Traffic Coming From Both Directions" 
### SUSAN SWARD 
"I've had the experience of
being in the middle of the
road and having the traffic
come at me from both direc
tions," said Richard Lyman.
It's no wonder that Stan
ford's vice president and pro
vost feels harried. New pres
sures are constantly being
heaped on oid problems that
are eventually finding their
way to Lyman's desk.

"It can be wearing," he
admitted. The 14-hour day as
Stanford's chief troubleshoot
er is not an easy one.
Lyman's professional field
is the first to suffer from his
administrative duties. "Right
now I'm in rebellion because
I have so little free time. In
the last few years I've kept
up less and less with my
special field of interest —con-
temporary British political
history," he laments.
Harvard Or ad
Lyman began his academic
career at Swarthmore and
Harvard, receiving his Ph.D.
from Harvard in 1954. He
taught at Harvard, Washing
ton University in St. Louis,
and Swarthmore before he
came to Stanford in 1958 as
an assistant professor in his
tory. His rise was rapid from
then on.
In 1954 Lyman was named
associate dean of humanities
and sciences. He was ap
pointed vice president and
provost by Wallace Sterling
in 1966.
Commenting on the role of
the administrator, Lyman
said, "Nothing is more de
humanizing than assuming
that because someone is in
the administration, he is
some kind of bureaucratic
nincompoop.
IVIany Pressures
"The administration is
changing in response to a
greatly heightened demand
for participation by almost
every other faction in the
university," Lyman noted. He
went on to say that good aca
d e m i c administrators are
worried about "the pressure
on them that prevents them
from having time to read and
think."
Speaking about efforts for
social change, Lyman said,
"I have never argued that no
good can come out of a sit-in
or demonstration. As a po
litical historian, I could never
argue that. Some good does
come out of confrontation
politics. What I fear is that
people will come to think
confrontation politics is Ihe

only way to reach a solution.
"If enough people come to
believe this, people like me
will be fighting fires 100 per
cent of the time. Then the
only way to get our attention
will be to create a serious
threat of some kind." Lyman
went on to admit that there
are definitely times when it is
necessary to raise hell. "But
the threshold is going down
and down."
"Self-Education"
Discussing the students'
role in the university, Lyman
said, "No one knows today
where the students' role
should be the strongest and
where it should have limits.
The students' role is, first
and foremost, to educate
himself. I define liberal edu
cation as the effort to ac
quaint students with the
means by which they can or
ganize their own intellectual
capacity. . . ."
Speaking about young peo
ple is not just an academic
question for the provost; a
discussion of student power
is equally extended to his
own family of four children.
"Students have a great deal
more freedom in fact than
they have ever had before.
Young people generally do.
Good lord, my oldest daugh
ter Jennifer has traveled all
over alone."
Speaking of the defense re
search at Stanford, Lyman
said, "People have to ask
themselves, 'Do you want to
he a technologically disarmed
country whilf there are other
technologically armed coun
tries?' "
Who Controls
"The Stanford Research
Institute committee is going
to concern itself with the
question of whether the uni
versity should carry any re
sponsibility for an organiza
tion over which the faculty
and administration have no
control," Lyman said.
Concerning his position as
an administrator, Lyman
made several off • the • cuff
comments.
"Administrators feel they

are being pushed into the
role that has been character
ized for them as paper push
ers. I have some real doubts
about whether the position
of a college president would
be what I want. Sometimes I
think it wouldn't be such a
bad thing to return to teach
ing."
What do the students think
of Richard Lyman?
Many students only know
of Lyman's reaction to the
sit-in last year. One member
of the Students for a Demo
cratic Society said, "Lyman
is the typical liberal adminis
trator who is trying very
hard to line up his job with
his conscience, and I imagine
he isn't succeeding very
well."
One student, a sophomore
in Lambda Nu, remarked
that he only knew Lyman
through his printed spoechos.
"He sounds rather flexible
and very scholarly on the
printed page," the student
said. "I expect he might be
somewhat more inflexible in
reality."
Whatever student opinions,
Lyman is being keot busy
with student demands, com
mittee meetings, and aca
demic, budget, and faculty
matters. Spare time is at a
premium.
Eating dinner with his
family at Serra House every
Tuesday night is one effort
Lyman makes to get out of
the administration building
he "spends too much time
in." There he, Mrs. Lyman,
Holly (16), Christopher (13),
and Timothy (11) get to
know Serra inhabitants. Jen
nifer (18) is a Berkeley
freshman.
Tuesday night expeditions
to Serra House represent one
of the few opportunities Ly
man has to communicate
with students in a relaxed
fashion. Even in the relative
ly carefree setting of Serra,
Lyman admits that his wife
knows more of students than
he does. "I often have to
rush off after the meal," he
said.

"I've had the experience of
being in the middle of the
road and having the traffic
come at me from both direc

went on to say that good aca
d e m i c administrators are
worried about "the pressure
on them that prevents them
from having time to read and
think."
Speaking about efforts for
social change, Lyman said,
"I have never argued that no
good can come out of a sit-in
or demonstration. As a po
litical historian, I could never
argue that. Some good does
come out of confrontation
politics. What I fear is that
people will come to think
confrontation politics is Ihe

only way to reach a solution.
"If enough people come to
believe this, people like me
will be fighting fires 100 per
cent of the time. Then the
only way to get our attention
will be to create a serious
threat of some kind." Lyman
went on to admit that there
are definitely times when it is
necessary to raise hell. "But
the threshold is going down
and down."
"Self-Education"
Discussing the students'
role in the university, Lyman
said, "No one knows today
where the students' role
should be the strongest and
where it should have limits.
The students' role is, first
and foremost, to educate
himself. I define liberal edu
cation as the effort to ac
quaint students with the
means by which they can or
ganize their own intellectual
capacity. . . ."
Speaking about young peo
ple is not just an academic
question for the provost; a
discussion of student power
is equally extended to his
own family of four children.
"Students have a great deal
more freedom in fact than
they have ever had before.
Young people generally do.
Good lord, my oldest daugh
ter Jennifer has traveled all
over alone."
Speaking of the defense re
search at Stanford, Lyman
said, "People have to ask
themselves, 'Do you want to

country whilf there are other
technologically armed coun

Who Controls
"The Stanford Research
Institute committee is going
to concern itself with the
question of whether the uni
versity should carry any re
sponsibility for an organiza
tion over which the faculty
and administration have no
control," Lyman said.
Concerning his position as
an administrator, Lyman
made several off • the • cuff
comments.
"Administrators feel they

are being pushed into the
role that has been character
ized for them as paper push
ers. I have some real doubts
about whether the position
of a college president would
be what I want. Sometimes I
think it wouldn't be such a
bad thing to return to teach
ing."
What do the students think
of Richard Lyman?
Many students only know
of Lyman's reaction to the
sit-in last year. One member
of the Students for a Demo
cratic Society said, "Lyman
is the typical liberal adminis
trator who is trying very
hard to line up his job with
his conscience, and I imagine
he isn't succeeding very
well."
One student, a sophomore
in Lambda Nu, remarked
that he only knew Lyman
through his printed spoechos.
"He sounds rather flexible
and very scholarly on the
printed page," the student
said. "I expect he might be
somewhat more inflexible in
reality."
Whatever student opinions,
Lyman is being keot busy
with student demands, com
mittee meetings, and aca
demic, budget, and faculty
matters. Spare time is at a
premium.
Eating dinner with his
family at Serra House every
Tuesday night is one effort
Lyman makes to get out of
the administration building
he "spends too much time
in." There he, Mrs. Lyman,
Holly (16), Christopher (13),
and Timothy (11) get to
know Serra inhabitants. Jen
nifer (18) is a Berkeley
freshman.
Tuesday night expeditions
to Serra House represent one
of the few opportunities Ly
man has to communicate
with students in a relaxed
fashion. Even in the relative
ly carefree setting of Serra,
Lyman admits that his wife
knows more of students than
he does. "I often have to
rush off after the meal," he
said.

"I've had the experience of
being in the middle of the
road and having the traffic
come at me from both direc
tions," said Richard Lyman.
It's no wonder that Stan
ford's vice president and pro
vost feels harried. New pres
sures are constantly being
heaped on oid problems that
are eventually finding their
way to Lyman's desk.

"It can be wearing," he
admitted. The 14-hour day as
Stanford's chief troubleshoot
er is not an easy one.
Lyman's professional field
is the first to suffer from his
administrative duties. "Right
now I'm in rebellion because
I have so little free time. In
the last few years I've kept
up less and less with my
special field of interest —con-
temporary British political
history," he laments.
Harvard Or ad

career at Swarthmore and
Harvard, receiving his Ph.D.
from Harvard in 1954. He
taught at Harvard, Washing

In 1954 Lyman was named
associate dean of humanities
and sciences. He was ap
pointed vice president and
provost by Wallace Sterling
in 1966.
Commenting on the role of
the administrator, Lyman
said, "Nothing is more de
humanizing than assuming
that because someone is in
the administration, he is
some kind of bureaucratic
nincompoop.
IVIany Pressures
"The administration is
changing in response to a
greatly heightened demand

Who Controls
"The Stanford Research
Institute committee is going
to concern itself with the
question of whether the uni
versity should carry any re
sponsibility for an organiza
tion over which the faculty
and administration have no
control," Lyman said.
Concerning his position as
an administrator, Lyman
made several off • the • cuff
comments.
"Administrators feel they

are being pushed into the
role that has been character
ized for them as paper push
ers. I have some real doubts
about whether the position
of a college president would
be what I want. Sometimes I
think it wouldn't be such a
bad thing to return to teach
ing."
What do the students think
of Richard Lyman?
Many students only know
of Lyman's reaction to the
sit-in last year. One member
of the Students for a Demo
cratic Society said, "Lyman
is the typical liberal adminis
trator who is trying very
hard to line up his job with
his conscience, and I imagine
he isn't succeeding very
well."
One student, a sophomore
in Lambda Nu, remarked
that he only knew Lyman
through his printed spoechos.
"He sounds rather flexible
and very scholarly on the
printed page," the student
said. "I expect he might be
somewhat more inflexible in
reality."
Whatever student opinions,
Lyman is being keot busy
with student demands, com
mittee meetings, and aca
demic, budget, and faculty
matters. Spare time is at a
premium.
Eating dinner with his
family at Serra House every
Tuesday night is one effort
Lyman makes to get out of
the administration building
he "spends too much time
in." There he, Mrs. Lyman,
Holly (16), Christopher (13),
and Timothy (11) get to
know Serra inhabitants. Jen
nifer (18) is a Berkeley
freshman.
Tuesday night expeditions
to Serra House represent one
of the few opportunities Ly
man has to communicate
with students in a relaxed
fashion. Even in the relative
ly carefree setting of Serra,
Lyman admits that his wife
knows more of students than
he does. "I often have to
rush off after the meal," he
said.

"I've had the experience of
being in the middle of the
road and having the traffic
come at me from both direc
tions," said Richard Lyman.
It's no wonder that Stan
ford's vice president and pro
vost feels harried. New pres
sures are constantly being
heaped on oid problems that
are eventually finding their
way to Lyman's desk.

"It can be wearing," he
admitted. The 14-hour day as
Stanford's chief troubleshoot
er is not an easy one.
Lyman's professional field
is the first to suffer from his
administrative duties. "Right
now I'm in rebellion because
I have so little free time. In
the last few years I've kept
up less and less with my
special field of interest —con-
temporary British political
history," he laments.
Harvard Or ad
Lyman began his academic
career at Swarthmore and
Harvard, receiving his Ph.D.
from Harvard in 1954. He
taught at Harvard, Washing
ton University in St. Louis,
and Swarthmore before he
came to Stanford in 1958 as
an assistant professor in his
tory. His rise was rapid from
then on.
In 1954 Lyman was named
associate dean of humanities
and sciences. He was ap
pointed vice president and
provost by Wallace Sterling
in 1966.
Commenting on the role of
the administrator, Lyman
said, "Nothing is more de
humanizing than assuming
that because someone is in
the administration, he is
some kind of bureaucratic
nincompoop.
IVIany Pressures
"The administration is
changing in response to a
greatly heightened demand
for participation by almost
every other faction in the
university," Lyman noted. He
went on to say that good aca
d e m i c administrators are
worried about "the pressure
on them that prevents them
from having time to read and
think."
Speaking about efforts for
social change, Lyman said,
"I have never argued that no
good can come out of a sit-in
or demonstration. As a po
litical historian, I could never
argue that. Some good does
come out of confrontation
politics. What I fear is that
people will come to think
confrontation politics is Ihe

only way to reach a solution.
"If enough people come to
believe this, people like me
will be fighting fires 100 per
cent of the time. Then the
only way to get our attention
will be to create a serious
threat of some kind." Lyman
went on to admit that there
are definitely times when it is
necessary to raise hell. "But
the threshold is going down
and down."
"Self-Education"
Discussing the students'
role in the university, Lyman
said, "No one knows today
where the students' role
should be the strongest and
where it should have limits.
The students' role is, first
and foremost, to educate
himself. I define liberal edu
cation as the effort to ac
quaint students with the
means by which they can or
ganize their own intellectual
capacity. . . ."
Speaking about young peo
ple is not just an academic
question for the provost; a
discussion of student power
is equally extended to his
own family of four children.
"Students have a great deal
more freedom in fact than
they have ever had before.
Young people generally do.
Good lord, my oldest daugh
ter Jennifer has traveled all
over alone."
Speaking of the defense re
search at Stanford, Lyman
said, "People have to ask
