Arson investigations into the
two fires in the NROTC annex
last year and the fire in the
President's office last July are
"continuing" according to Santa
Clara County Fire Chief Bruce
Wiggins.
"There has been some prog
ress made. Nothing significant
further has developed as far as
physical evidence. The investi
gation has been slanted toward
interviewing people."
Last Feb. 19 the NROTC an
nex, also known as Mahon Hall,
was set on fire causing $6,000
damage but with a replacement
value of $25,000.
The building was two-thirds
refurbished when on May 7 the
building was completely de
stroyed by fire during demon
strations at the Old Student Un
ion. The President's office was
burned on July 5 causing $300,-
000 damage.
Little Damage
Last August a fire was also
set in the papers and file draw
ers located in the basement of
the Student Services Building.
This fire was controlled, how
ever, and caused little monetary
damage.
There is "no doubt that they
(the first three fires) were ar
son," according to Stanford
Fire Chief John Marston. The
investigation is being conducted
by the Santa Clara County Fire
Department with the District
Attorney's office aiding at the
request of the Fire Department.
The FBI was also interested in
the first NROTC fire since fed
eral property was destroyed.
There has been no connection
made between the fires at this
time. Fire Marshal Wiggins
said, "We can't say either the
fires were related or that they

were not."
The President's office is cur
rently being restored with mod
ifications. The ceiling over the
President's office is being low
ered to allow for extra second
story space. The office is ex
pected to be finished by late
February.
In Trailers
In the meantime, the Presi
dent's quarters are located in a
new building nearby and other
administrators are occupying
four trailers in the courtyard of
the main Quad.
With the loss of the NROTC
building, which was the old fac
ulty club and one of the oldest
buildings on campus, Naval Sci
ence courses are being held in
a small building elsewhere on
campus.
Just Like Home
One NROTC student ex
pressed his dismay at the loss
of the building. "Mahon Hall
was a unifying element. The
Unit has lost a lot of spirit and
cohesiveness as a result of the
loss of the building. We had al
most a little family before the
fires."
A $5000 reward for Informa
tion leading to the arrest of the
person or persons responsible
for the burning of the Presi
dent's office was ordered and
has since doubled to $10,000.
The furnishing of new build
ings as a result of the fires is
being paid for by the university,
principally out of money re
ceived from insurance. How
ever, due to the $273,000 fire
losses last year the insurance
companies have now raised the
deductible clause for University
coverage from $1,000 to $25,000.
The companies have also sought
rate increases totaling over
$200,000.
