• Cleaver Loses Parole
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
Eldridge Cleaver, controversial
Black Panther leader and au
thor, lost his last round in Cali
fornia state courts Wednesday
in his fight to remain free on
parole from state prison.
The State Supreme court re
fused to consider Cleaver's ap
peal from a lower court decision
revoking his parole.
The effect of the high court's
action is to require that Clea
ver, 33, be returned to state
prison Nov. 27 as a parole vio
lator.
Charles R. Garry, Cleaver's
attorney, said however that an
immediate appeal will be carried
to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Cleaver, who was nominated
as the Peace and Freedom Par
ty candidate for president in the

November election, was arrested
last April 6 in a Black Panther
shootout with Oakland police.
Cleaver's parole from a 13-
year term for his 1958 Los An
geles convictions on two counts
of assault with intent to commit
murder was revoked immediate
ly by the California Adult Au
thority.
• Czechs Divided
PRAGUE (AP) — Czechoslo
vakia's leaders appealed Wed
nesday night to striking stu
dents to end their massive sit-ins
and "stop in time the danger
which is threatening us."
The joint declaration broad
cast by the presidiums of the
Communist party, the govern
ment, the National Assembly
and the Trade Union Council
said "irresponsible people" were
trying to channel student activi
ty to "divide the working class."
This is a serious accusation In a
Communist country.
The students, protesting a loss
of freedoms under Kremlin
pressure in this Soviet-occupied
country, said they would pro
long for 24 hours the sit-in
strike that had been scheduled
to end at 8 p.m. The strike began
three days ago.
But there were reports that
disagreements among the stu
dents over an ending time had
resulted in a compromise that
would end the strike at noon
Thursday.
The test of wills between the
Communist leaders and the stu
dents intensified when the stu
dents got worker support with
token sympathy strikes in some
Prague plants. Other plants
blasted their whistles and sirens
for 15 minutes to show solidarity
with the students.
Strong police and army pa
trols were on the streets in case
the government decided to use
force against the students or to
stop any demonstrations.
