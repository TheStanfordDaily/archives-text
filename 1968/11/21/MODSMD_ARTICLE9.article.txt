### MAURY M. TRAVIS 
(EDITOR'S NOTE: This latest contribution
from alumni Maury Travis was accompanied
by two newspaper clippings. The first, from a
1966 ROCKY MOUNTAIN NEWS, reported on
"gTowlnjf" evidence that "early and promiscu
ous sexual experience increases a woman's
chances for developing cancer of the cervix
late In life . . The second, from the same
paper but two years newer, was headlined
"University Students Demand 'Pill'
The author's previous writings have been
primarily political In nature and conservative
in outlook. By venturing into the field of sex
ual activity, Travis may be trying to demon
strate for us the unity between politics and
sociology or, more precisely, between mind
and body.)

Students college demand the "Pill,"
The magic potion that cures all ill:

No longer need fear thus procreation
In delights of secret fornication!
Alas! Gone is Commandment Seven,
Moses no longer comes from Heaven:
Delights of sex in all proportion
To forgiveness surgery in abortion.
Cancer is so nice to your liking,
Devil makes cervix disease inviting:
Good - time Cholly ever ready
To make nice coed pregnant steady.
So enjoy intercourse pre-marital,
Playboy hedonist has a ball:
No down payment, good time now,
Final payment later takes a bow.
So little coed sow your oat,
River Styx waits for you in boat:
For foolish virgins who cast away
God's love for any male to make astray
L'envoi
Cancer, hospitals, cemeteries all
Await free cheap adultery's call:
No free rides but double trouble,
Your Fate later lies in gutter rubble!
