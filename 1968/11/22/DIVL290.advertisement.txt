BEAD THE
CLASSIFIED ADS
GOOE
Gremlins were at work on the in
nards of an ad that ran here re
cently for the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants.
The CPA people, after telling us
a bit about the profession, and why
it offers a rosy future for a college
man, offered to send interested
students a booklet with the whole
CPA story.
That part got left out of the ad.
There was just white space, star
ing up blankly at the reader. Dis
concerting. Phantasmal. Spooky
The oooklet, with the whole CPA
story, will be sent to you if you
write: Dept. A-11, AICPA, 666 Fifth
Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10019
