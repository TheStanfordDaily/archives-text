Eve's wardrobe costs a lit
tle more these days—a factor
that bears directly on every
young husband's financial
security. True, you may not
be a young husband. Yet. Sta
tistically, however, the odds
are heavily against the per
manency of that condition.
And it's smart to plan now —
before the wife and family
make the scene.
Here's one way. Invest in a
life insurance program that
can provide the foundation for
a solid financial structure.
Remember, the earlier you
start, the less coverage costs,
and the more security you'll
have a chance to build.
So phone our office today.
Or stop by and let's talk about
it. In the meantime give a
thought to the figleaf—and
how comfortable it feels to
be covered.
