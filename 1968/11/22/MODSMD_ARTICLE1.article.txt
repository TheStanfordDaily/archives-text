# Spirit Of Immortal 21 Sparks Axe Rivalry
## 
### BETTY NISHIOKA 
"Beat Cal"—"Oski Bites'—"Kiss Our Axe
Goodbye."
Red and white buttons containing such
sentiments have been appearing on sweaters
and collars throughout the campus as vis
ual reminders of tomorrow's Big Game
against Berkeley, Stanford's perennial rival.
Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., the Stanford foot
ball team, whose six-year winning streak
was broken last year by Cal's victory score
of 26-3, will tackle their University of Cali
fornia opponents in an effort to recover the
vaunted symbol of the match, the Axe.
If Stanford wins this year, the coach, the
team, and the heads of the rally committees
will race across the field to retrieve the tra
ditional symbol of victory. In the event of
a tie, however, the Axe will remain in Cal's
possession.
Origin of the Axe
When it first originated in April of 1899,
the Axe was never intended to be a trophy
to be passed back and forth between the
hands of the annual Big Game victors.
At that time, the Stanford head yell lead
er Billy Erb devised a clever performance
for a rally aimed at reviving spirit for a
Stanford-Cal baseball game.
At the huge bonfire-rally held two days
before the game, Erb led the fans in shout
ing what became the Axe Yell.
As the crowd screamed "Give 'em the
Axe!", an effigy of a bear appeared on the
scene. Erb chased and caught the beast, be
headed it with a 15-inch red axe, and pro
ceeded to hurl the bear into the fire.
Axe Is Stolen
Erb took the Axe to San Francisco, where
the game was played, and displayed it be
fore the rooters. After the game, the guar
dians of the Axe found themselves defense
less in the midst of a mob of Cal students.
Cal footbad player Paul Castlehun grabbed
the ten-pound chunk of metal and escaped
with it through the streets of the city.
Stanford hurdler Frank Strout recovered
the stolen goods for a while, but was soon
overtaken by Cal's "Wonder Quarterback"
Jim Hopper.

For a long and bitter 31 years, the Indians
were deprived of their tomahawk. A few
attempts to retrieve their stolen Axe did
take place during that time, but all were
unsuccessful. The failure in 1929, for exam
ple, was attributed to the Los Angeles Po
lice Department's refusal to supply tear
gas bombs.
The following year, 1930, however, was
the year of the ingenious caper of the "Im
mortal 21", whose fame will probably live
as long as the Axe tradition itself.
On April Fool's Day, 1930, Don Kropp or
ganized a meeting of a group of Stanford
men to recover their missing Axe. In two
days they completed a master plan which
went into effect the day of the Berkeley ral
ly before a Stanford-Cal baseball game.
At 4:30 p.m. on April 3, three cars deli
vered conspirators to strategic points of ac
tion the bank where the Axe was being
kept, the Greek Theater where the rally
was to take place, and the beginning of the
parade leading to the Theater.
Warning Is Passed
Five minutes before the rally ended, the
men stationed at the bank were informed
that the armored car bearing the Axe was
approaching the bank, in whose vault the
Axe was to be stored. When the car ap
peared, six Stanford men were positioned
on the roof and rumble seat of the vehicle,
and members of the Immortal 21 posing as
photographers persuaded gullible Cal fresh
men guards to step back so that pictures
could be taken.
Norm Horner, the Axe custodian, was
reluctant at first to step out of the truck,
but finally yielded. When Horner hit the
ground, a blinding charge of fiashlight pow
der was released. Stanford's Howard Avery
wrestled the Axe away from Horner's
hands, removed the handle, and passed the
blade down a chain of waiting co-workers.
The Axe finally reached Robert Loofbou
row, who tucked it under his sweater and
nonchalantly walked out of the mob as a
tear gas bomb was exploded.
Believing that he possessed the Axe, the
riotous crowd assaulted Avery, who was

rescued by the heroic efforts of several
Stanford buddies. Other Stanford men
called a meeting at the Campanile to orga
niz • the anarchic masses into search parties
which were sent on false leads.
In the meantime the Axe was traveling
safely on its way home in the getaway car.
The Bay Bridge had not yet been construct
ed at that time, and rather than taking the
risk of meeting Cal pursuers on the San
Mateo-Hayward Bridge, the getaway crew
transported the Axe back to "The Farm"
by way of San Jose.
The old San Mateo Bridge, which was a
drawbridge, was being manned at the time
by Stanford graduate "Red" Okkre who,
when he recognized a car containing Cal
rescue party members, raised the bridge to
delay the angry posse.
Back at Stanford, the Axe was shown to
a rejoicing crowd at a spontaneous parade
and rally. Each of the members of the Im
mortal 21 were later awarded a varsity
block "S" and a gold Axe charm.
The infamous Axe was locked in a Palo
Alto bank vault under permanent authority
of the Board of Athletic Control until three
years later when Stanford and Cal students
decided to award the Axe to the school that
emerged as the winner of the annual Big
Game.
Since 1930, Stanford has lost the Axe
twenty-one times. The most recent burglary
occurred on May 12, 1967, when Cal stu
dents removed it from a showcase in Tres
idder Union by a skillful act that perplexed
both police and students alike. Stanford re
gained possession of the missing Axe for
three hours during the Big Game last year
before it was handed over to the trium
phant Cal team.
Recently the Stanford Bank has informed
Axe Comm that if Stanford regains the Axe
this year, it is "only appropriate that it be
kept in the vault at the Stanford Bank" to
prevent future incidents of thievery and
loss of ownership.
The pageantry continues for yet another
year, and to the winner goes the symbolic
spoils The Stanford Axe.

KEMPERT STRIKES AGAIN —Stanford's infamous pom-pon girl thief has struck again. Bert Kem
pert, left, and an equally daring cohort "The Phantom," right, paid a daring visit to the Berkeley cof
fee shop Tuesday evening and came away with this giant California banner which formerly hung
above Oski, the twelve-foot California Bear. Kempert pulled off the major part of the plot standing
precariously for 2 hours on the frame behind the Bear while janitors were busily cleaning up. Kem
pert finally got the all-clear sign from the Phantom who tapped on the glass from outside. He then
literally scaled the bear, tearing the banner down and replacing it with the word "Stanford" in red
paint. About that time a group of California guards approached. The Phantom then gave the signal,
and the pair fled untouched and booty-laden.

tear gas bomb was exploded.
Believing that he possessed the Axe, the
riotous crowd assaulted Avery, who was

rescued by the heroic efforts of several
Stanford buddies. Other Stanford men
called a meeting at the Campanile to orga
niz • the anarchic masses into search parties
which were sent on false leads.
In the meantime the Axe was traveling
safely on its way home in the getaway car.
The Bay Bridge had not yet been construct
ed at that time, and rather than taking the
risk of meeting Cal pursuers on the San
Mateo-Hayward Bridge, the getaway crew
transported the Axe back to "The Farm"
by way of San Jose.
The old San Mateo Bridge, which was a
drawbridge, was being manned at the time
by Stanford graduate "Red" Okkre who,
when he recognized a car containing Cal
rescue party members, raised the bridge to
delay the angry posse.
Back at Stanford, the Axe was shown to
a rejoicing crowd at a spontaneous parade
and rally. Each of the members of the Im
mortal 21 were later awarded a varsity
block "S" and a gold Axe charm.
The infamous Axe was locked in a Palo
Alto bank vault under permanent authority
of the Board of Athletic Control until three
years later when Stanford and Cal students
decided to award the Axe to the school that
emerged as the winner of the annual Big
Game.
Since 1930, Stanford has lost the Axe
twenty-one times. The most recent burglary
occurred on May 12, 1967, when Cal stu
dents removed it from a showcase in Tres
idder Union by a skillful act that perplexed
both police and students alike. Stanford re
gained possession of the missing Axe for
three hours during the Big Game last year
before it was handed over to the trium
phant Cal team.
Recently the Stanford Bank has informed
Axe Comm that if Stanford regains the Axe
this year, it is "only appropriate that it be
kept in the vault at the Stanford Bank" to
prevent future incidents of thievery and
loss of ownership.
The pageantry continues for yet another
year, and to the winner goes the symbolic
spoils The Stanford Axe.

KEMPERT STRIKES AGAIN —Stanford's infamous pom-pon girl thief has struck again. Bert Kem
pert, left, and an equally daring cohort "The Phantom," right, paid a daring visit to the Berkeley cof
fee shop Tuesday evening and came away with this giant California banner which formerly hung
above Oski, the twelve-foot California Bear. Kempert pulled off the major part of the plot standing
precariously for 2 hours on the frame behind the Bear while janitors were busily cleaning up. Kem
pert finally got the all-clear sign from the Phantom who tapped on the glass from outside. He then
literally scaled the bear, tearing the banner down and replacing it with the word "Stanford" in red
paint. About that time a group of California guards approached. The Phantom then gave the signal,
and the pair fled untouched and booty-laden.
"Beat Cal"—"Oski Bites'—"Kiss Our Axe
Goodbye."
Red and white buttons containing such
sentiments have been appearing on sweaters
and collars throughout the campus as vis
ual reminders of tomorrow's Big Game
against Berkeley, Stanford's perennial rival.
Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., the Stanford foot
ball team, whose six-year winning streak
was broken last year by Cal's victory score
of 26-3, will tackle their University of Cali
fornia opponents in an effort to recover the
vaunted symbol of the match, the Axe.
If Stanford wins this year, the coach, the
team, and the heads of the rally committees
will race across the field to retrieve the tra
ditional symbol of victory. In the event of
a tie, however, the Axe will remain in Cal's
possession.
Origin of the Axe
When it first originated in April of 1899,
the Axe was never intended to be a trophy
to be passed back and forth between the
hands of the annual Big Game victors.
At that time, the Stanford head yell lead
er Billy Erb devised a clever performance
for a rally aimed at reviving spirit for a
Stanford-Cal baseball game.
At the huge bonfire-rally held two days
before the game, Erb led the fans in shout
ing what became the Axe Yell.
As the crowd screamed "Give 'em the
Axe!", an effigy of a bear appeared on the
scene. Erb chased and caught the beast, be
headed it with a 15-inch red axe, and pro
ceeded to hurl the bear into the fire.
Axe Is Stolen
Erb took the Axe to San Francisco, where
the game was played, and displayed it be
fore the rooters. After the game, the guar
dians of the Axe found themselves defense
less in the midst of a mob of Cal students.
Cal footbad player Paul Castlehun grabbed
the ten-pound chunk of metal and escaped
with it through the streets of the city.
Stanford hurdler Frank Strout recovered
the stolen goods for a while, but was soon
overtaken by Cal's "Wonder Quarterback"
Jim Hopper.

For a long and bitter 31 years, the Indians
were deprived of their tomahawk. A few
attempts to retrieve their stolen Axe did
take place during that time, but all were
unsuccessful. The failure in 1929, for exam
ple, was attributed to the Los Angeles Po
lice Department's refusal to supply tear
gas bombs.
The following year, 1930, however, was
the year of the ingenious caper of the "Im
mortal 21", whose fame will probably live
as long as the Axe tradition itself.
On April Fool's Day, 1930, Don Kropp or
ganized a meeting of a group of Stanford
men to recover their missing Axe. In two
days they completed a master plan which
went into effect the day of the Berkeley ral
ly before a Stanford-Cal baseball game.
At 4:30 p.m. on April 3, three cars deli
vered conspirators to strategic points of ac
tion the bank where the Axe was being
kept, the Greek Theater where the rally
was to take place, and the beginning of the
parade leading to the Theater.
Warning Is Passed
Five minutes before the rally ended, the
men stationed at the bank were informed
that the armored car bearing the Axe was
approaching the bank, in whose vault the
Axe was to be stored. When the car ap
peared, six Stanford men were positioned
on the roof and rumble seat of the vehicle,
and members of the Immortal 21 posing as
photographers persuaded gullible Cal fresh
men guards to step back so that pictures
could be taken.
Norm Horner, the Axe custodian, was
reluctant at first to step out of the truck,
but finally yielded. When Horner hit the
ground, a blinding charge of fiashlight pow
der was released. Stanford's Howard Avery
wrestled the Axe away from Horner's
hands, removed the handle, and passed the
blade down a chain of waiting co-workers.
The Axe finally reached Robert Loofbou
row, who tucked it under his sweater and
nonchalantly walked out of the mob as a
tear gas bomb was exploded.
Believing that he possessed the Axe, the
riotous crowd assaulted Avery, who was

rescued by the heroic efforts of several

before the game, Erb led the fans in shout
ing what became the Axe Yell.
As the crowd screamed "Give 'em the
Axe!", an effigy of a bear appeared on the
scene. Erb chased and caught the beast, be
headed it with a 15-inch red axe, and pro
ceeded to hurl the bear into the fire.
Axe Is Stolen
Erb took the Axe to San Francisco, where
the game was played, and displayed it be
fore the rooters. After the game, the guar
dians of the Axe found themselves defense
less in the midst of a mob of Cal students.
Cal footbad player Paul Castlehun grabbed
the ten-pound chunk of metal and escaped
with it through the streets of the city.
Stanford hurdler Frank Strout recovered
the stolen goods for a while, but was soon
overtaken by Cal's "Wonder Quarterback"
Jim Hopper.

For a long and bitter 31 years, the Indians
were deprived of their tomahawk. A few
attempts to retrieve their stolen Axe did
take place during that time, but all were
unsuccessful. The failure in 1929, for exam
ple, was attributed to the Los Angeles Po
lice Department's refusal to supply tear
gas bombs.
The following year, 1930, however, was
the year of the ingenious caper of the "Im
mortal 21", whose fame will probably live
as long as the Axe tradition itself.
On April Fool's Day, 1930, Don Kropp or
ganized a meeting of a group of Stanford
men to recover their missing Axe. In two
days they completed a master plan which
went into effect the day of the Berkeley ral
ly before a Stanford-Cal baseball game.
At 4:30 p.m. on April 3, three cars deli
vered conspirators to strategic points of ac
tion the bank where the Axe was being
kept, the Greek Theater where the rally
was to take place, and the beginning of the
parade leading to the Theater.
Warning Is Passed
Five minutes before the rally ended, the
men stationed at the bank were informed
that the armored car bearing the Axe was
approaching the bank, in whose vault the
Axe was to be stored. When the car ap
peared, six Stanford men were positioned
on the roof and rumble seat of the vehicle,
and members of the Immortal 21 posing as
photographers persuaded gullible Cal fresh
men guards to step back so that pictures
could be taken.
Norm Horner, the Axe custodian, was
reluctant at first to step out of the truck,
but finally yielded. When Horner hit the
ground, a blinding charge of fiashlight pow
der was released. Stanford's Howard Avery
wrestled the Axe away from Horner's
hands, removed the handle, and passed the
blade down a chain of waiting co-workers.
The Axe finally reached Robert Loofbou
row, who tucked it under his sweater and
nonchalantly walked out of the mob as a
tear gas bomb was exploded.
Believing that he possessed the Axe, the
riotous crowd assaulted Avery, who was

rescued by the heroic efforts of several
Stanford buddies. Other Stanford men
called a meeting at the Campanile to orga
niz • the anarchic masses into search parties
which were sent on false leads.
In the meantime the Axe was traveling
safely on its way home in the getaway car.
The Bay Bridge had not yet been construct
ed at that time, and rather than taking the
risk of meeting Cal pursuers on the San
Mateo-Hayward Bridge, the getaway crew
transported the Axe back to "The Farm"
by way of San Jose.
The old San Mateo Bridge, which was a
drawbridge, was being manned at the time
by Stanford graduate "Red" Okkre who,
when he recognized a car containing Cal
rescue party members, raised the bridge to
delay the angry posse.
Back at Stanford, the Axe was shown to
a rejoicing crowd at a spontaneous parade
and rally. Each of the members of the Im
mortal 21 were later awarded a varsity
block "S" and a gold Axe charm.
The infamous Axe was locked in a Palo
Alto bank vault under permanent authority
of the Board of Athletic Control until three
years later when Stanford and Cal students
decided to award the Axe to the school that
emerged as the winner of the annual Big
Game.
Since 1930, Stanford has lost the Axe
twenty-one times. The most recent burglary
occurred on May 12, 1967, when Cal stu
dents removed it from a showcase in Tres
idder Union by a skillful act that perplexed
both police and students alike. Stanford re
gained possession of the missing Axe for
three hours during the Big Game last year
before it was handed over to the trium
phant Cal team.
Recently the Stanford Bank has informed
Axe Comm that if Stanford regains the Axe
this year, it is "only appropriate that it be
kept in the vault at the Stanford Bank" to
prevent future incidents of thievery and
loss of ownership.
The pageantry continues for yet another
year, and to the winner goes the symbolic
spoils The Stanford Axe.

KEMPERT STRIKES AGAIN —Stanford's infamous pom-pon girl thief has struck again. Bert Kem
pert, left, and an equally daring cohort "The Phantom," right, paid a daring visit to the Berkeley cof
fee shop Tuesday evening and came away with this giant California banner which formerly hung
above Oski, the twelve-foot California Bear. Kempert pulled off the major part of the plot standing
precariously for 2 hours on the frame behind the Bear while janitors were busily cleaning up. Kem
pert finally got the all-clear sign from the Phantom who tapped on the glass from outside. He then
literally scaled the bear, tearing the banner down and replacing it with the word "Stanford" in red
paint. About that time a group of California guards approached. The Phantom then gave the signal,
and the pair fled untouched and booty-laden.
"Beat Cal"—"Oski Bites'—"Kiss Our Axe
Goodbye."
Red and white buttons containing such
sentiments have been appearing on sweaters
and collars throughout the campus as vis
ual reminders of tomorrow's Big Game
against Berkeley, Stanford's perennial rival.
Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., the Stanford foot
ball team, whose six-year winning streak
was broken last year by Cal's victory score
of 26-3, will tackle their University of Cali
fornia opponents in an effort to recover the
vaunted symbol of the match, the Axe.
If Stanford wins this year, the coach, the
team, and the heads of the rally committees
will race across the field to retrieve the tra
ditional symbol of victory. In the event of
a tie, however, the Axe will remain in Cal's
possession.
Origin of the Axe
When it first originated in April of 1899,
the Axe was never intended to be a trophy
to be passed back and forth between the
hands of the annual Big Game victors.
At that time, the Stanford head yell lead
er Billy Erb devised a clever performance
for a rally aimed at reviving spirit for a
Stanford-Cal baseball game.

emerged as the winner of the annual Big
Game.
Since 1930, Stanford has lost the Axe
twenty-one times. The most recent burglary
occurred on May 12, 1967, when Cal stu
dents removed it from a showcase in Tres
idder Union by a skillful act that perplexed
both police and students alike. Stanford re
gained possession of the missing Axe for
three hours during the Big Game last year
before it was handed over to the trium
phant Cal team.
Recently the Stanford Bank has informed
Axe Comm that if Stanford regains the Axe
this year, it is "only appropriate that it be
kept in the vault at the Stanford Bank" to
prevent future incidents of thievery and
loss of ownership.
The pageantry continues for yet another
year, and to the winner goes the symbolic
spoils The Stanford Axe.

KEMPERT STRIKES AGAIN —Stanford's infamous pom-pon girl thief has struck again. Bert Kem
pert, left, and an equally daring cohort "The Phantom," right, paid a daring visit to the Berkeley cof
fee shop Tuesday evening and came away with this giant California banner which formerly hung
above Oski, the twelve-foot California Bear. Kempert pulled off the major part of the plot standing
precariously for 2 hours on the frame behind the Bear while janitors were busily cleaning up. Kem
pert finally got the all-clear sign from the Phantom who tapped on the glass from outside. He then
literally scaled the bear, tearing the banner down and replacing it with the word "Stanford" in red
paint. About that time a group of California guards approached. The Phantom then gave the signal,
and the pair fled untouched and booty-laden.
"Beat Cal"—"Oski Bites'—"Kiss Our Axe
Goodbye."
Red and white buttons containing such
sentiments have been appearing on sweaters
and collars throughout the campus as vis
ual reminders of tomorrow's Big Game
against Berkeley, Stanford's perennial rival.
Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., the Stanford foot
ball team, whose six-year winning streak
was broken last year by Cal's victory score
of 26-3, will tackle their University of Cali
fornia opponents in an effort to recover the
vaunted symbol of the match, the Axe.
If Stanford wins this year, the coach, the
team, and the heads of the rally committees
will race across the field to retrieve the tra
ditional symbol of victory. In the event of
a tie, however, the Axe will remain in Cal's
possession.
Origin of the Axe
When it first originated in April of 1899,
the Axe was never intended to be a trophy
to be passed back and forth between the
hands of the annual Big Game victors.
At that time, the Stanford head yell lead
er Billy Erb devised a clever performance
for a rally aimed at reviving spirit for a
Stanford-Cal baseball game.
At the huge bonfire-rally held two days
before the game, Erb led the fans in shout
ing what became the Axe Yell.
As the crowd screamed "Give 'em the
Axe!", an effigy of a bear appeared on the
scene. Erb chased and caught the beast, be
headed it with a 15-inch red axe, and pro
ceeded to hurl the bear into the fire.
Axe Is Stolen
Erb took the Axe to San Francisco, where
the game was played, and displayed it be
fore the rooters. After the game, the guar
dians of the Axe found themselves defense
less in the midst of a mob of Cal students.
Cal footbad player Paul Castlehun grabbed
the ten-pound chunk of metal and escaped
with it through the streets of the city.
Stanford hurdler Frank Strout recovered
the stolen goods for a while, but was soon
overtaken by Cal's "Wonder Quarterback"
Jim Hopper.

For a long and bitter 31 years, the Indians
were deprived of their tomahawk. A few
attempts to retrieve their stolen Axe did
take place during that time, but all were
unsuccessful. The failure in 1929, for exam
ple, was attributed to the Los Angeles Po
lice Department's refusal to supply tear
gas bombs.
The following year, 1930, however, was
the year of the ingenious caper of the "Im
mortal 21", whose fame will probably live
as long as the Axe tradition itself.
On April Fool's Day, 1930, Don Kropp or
ganized a meeting of a group of Stanford
men to recover their missing Axe. In two
days they completed a master plan which
went into effect the day of the Berkeley ral
ly before a Stanford-Cal baseball game.
At 4:30 p.m. on April 3, three cars deli
vered conspirators to strategic points of ac
tion the bank where the Axe was being
kept, the Greek Theater where the rally
was to take place, and the beginning of the
parade leading to the Theater.
Warning Is Passed
Five minutes before the rally ended, the
men stationed at the bank were informed
that the armored car bearing the Axe was
approaching the bank, in whose vault the
Axe was to be stored. When the car ap
peared, six Stanford men were positioned
on the roof and rumble seat of the vehicle,
and members of the Immortal 21 posing as
photographers persuaded gullible Cal fresh
men guards to step back so that pictures
could be taken.
Norm Horner, the Axe custodian, was
reluctant at first to step out of the truck,
but finally yielded. When Horner hit the
ground, a blinding charge of fiashlight pow
der was released. Stanford's Howard Avery
wrestled the Axe away from Horner's
hands, removed the handle, and passed the
blade down a chain of waiting co-workers.
The Axe finally reached Robert Loofbou
row, who tucked it under his sweater and
nonchalantly walked out of the mob as a
tear gas bomb was exploded.
Believing that he possessed the Axe, the
riotous crowd assaulted Avery, who was

rescued by the heroic efforts of several
Stanford buddies. Other Stanford men
called a meeting at the Campanile to orga
niz • the anarchic masses into search parties
which were sent on false leads.
In the meantime the Axe was traveling
safely on its way home in the getaway car.
The Bay Bridge had not yet been construct
ed at that time, and rather than taking the
risk of meeting Cal pursuers on the San
Mateo-Hayward Bridge, the getaway crew
transported the Axe back to "The Farm"
by way of San Jose.
The old San Mateo Bridge, which was a
drawbridge, was being manned at the time
by Stanford graduate "Red" Okkre who,
when he recognized a car containing Cal
rescue party members, raised the bridge to
delay the angry posse.
Back at Stanford, the Axe was shown to
a rejoicing crowd at a spontaneous parade
and rally. Each of the members of the Im
mortal 21 were later awarded a varsity
block "S" and a gold Axe charm.
The infamous Axe was locked in a Palo
Alto bank vault under permanent authority
of the Board of Athletic Control until three
years later when Stanford and Cal students
decided to award the Axe to the school that
emerged as the winner of the annual Big
Game.
Since 1930, Stanford has lost the Axe
twenty-one times. The most recent burglary
occurred on May 12, 1967, when Cal stu
dents removed it from a showcase in Tres
idder Union by a skillful act that perplexed
