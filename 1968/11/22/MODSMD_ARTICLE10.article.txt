Editor, THE DAILY:
Once again, The Stanford
Daily, in its editorial on the
Stanford Management Intern
Program, has sought to smear
an activity by skewing the facts
into its own mold. Now, I can
write a rebuttal, but the damage
has been done—which I am sure
is what The Daily intended in
the first place.
What I said, and what The
Daily conveniently forgot, is
that we offer summer intern
ships in New York, Chicago,
Los Angeles, Anaheim, San
Francisco, Palo Alto, Sunnyvale,
Detroit, Cincinnati, Dayton, In
dianapolis, Tulsa, Rochester,
and Marietta, Ga.
We are hoping to expand the
program this year into Seattle,
San Diego, St. Louis, St. Paul,
Toledo, Canton, and Philadel
phia.
In addition, we offer an in
ternship in marketing anywhere
in the United States. Quite ob
viously, if a student lives in any
of these areas, he can commute
to work. In this case, the stu
dent will net as profit for the
summer his entire salary of be
tween $400 and $600 per month.
If a student does not live in
and cannot commute to any of
the twenty-one cities mentioned
above, and if he is interested
in the marketing internship, he
will necessarily have to live
away from home. Assuming
that a student can live away
from home on $250 per month
or less, his financial profits for
the summer will still be rather
substantial.
In addition to this, the stu
dent will net the valuable man
agerial work experience which
is the goal of the program.
At this point the comparison

with the Stanford in-Washing
ton Program is obvious. Stan
ford-in-Washington offers sum
mer jobs in only two cities, Sac
ramento and Washington, D.C.,
at small and sometimes non
existent salaries. Stanford - in-
Washington's goal is govern
mental work experience, and
for that reason is an extremely
valuable program.
However, if The Daily wishes
to vent its editorial idiocies on
a program, it seems that it
chose the wrong one.
Now, if a student does not live
within commuting distance of
any of the twenty-one cities in
which we have or hope to have
an internship, if he is not in
terested in the marketing in
ternship, if he must be able to
net a summer salary of more
than $350 per month, and if he
cannot make up the financial
deficit in some other way, he
will not be able to accept an in
ternship under our program.
What is the Daily's solution?
—"convince the hiring compa
nies that it is worth their while
to pay an intern a little more
than usual to enable him to
work with them."
What The Daily fails to recog
nize is that the present salary
of between $400 and $600 per
month is excellent and thus
very difficult to increase. Sec
ondly, a minimum net summer
salary of $350 pe.- month is
more than sufficient to enable
most students to cope with their
educational expenses.
Another possibility is for our
program to become a scholar
ship service. I would be de
lighted to do this, but it would
be rather difficult on our pres
ent ASSU budget of $250 per
year. The only other workable
solution, then, is for SMIP to
expand to be able to place an
intern in every major city in
the U.S.—which we are trying
hard to do.
In conclusion, I would like to
suggest that in the future The
Daily surprise the entire cam
pus and get the facts straight

before writing one of its lucid
editorials.

Toledo, Canton, and Philadel
phia.
In addition, we offer an in
ternship in marketing anywhere
in the United States. Quite ob
viously, if a student lives in any
of these areas, he can commute
to work. In this case, the stu
dent will net as profit for the
summer his entire salary of be
tween $400 and $600 per month.
If a student does not live in
and cannot commute to any of
the twenty-one cities mentioned
above, and if he is interested
in the marketing internship, he
will necessarily have to live
away from home. Assuming
that a student can live away
from home on $250 per month
or less, his financial profits for
the summer will still be rather
substantial.
In addition to this, the stu
dent will net the valuable man
agerial work experience which
is the goal of the program.
At this point the comparison

with the Stanford in-Washing
ton Program is obvious. Stan
ford-in-Washington offers sum
mer jobs in only two cities, Sac
ramento and Washington, D.C.,
at small and sometimes non
existent salaries. Stanford - in-
Washington's goal is govern
mental work experience, and
for that reason is an extremely
valuable program.
However, if The Daily wishes
to vent its editorial idiocies on
a program, it seems that it
chose the wrong one.
Now, if a student does not live
within commuting distance of
any of the twenty-one cities in
which we have or hope to have
an internship, if he is not in
terested in the marketing in
ternship, if he must be able to
net a summer salary of more
than $350 per month, and if he
cannot make up the financial
deficit in some other way, he
will not be able to accept an in
ternship under our program.
What is the Daily's solution?
—"convince the hiring compa
nies that it is worth their while
to pay an intern a little more
than usual to enable him to
work with them."
What The Daily fails to recog
nize is that the present salary
of between $400 and $600 per
month is excellent and thus
very difficult to increase. Sec
ondly, a minimum net summer
salary of $350 pe.- month is
more than sufficient to enable
most students to cope with their
educational expenses.
Another possibility is for our
program to become a scholar
ship service. I would be de
lighted to do this, but it would
be rather difficult on our pres
ent ASSU budget of $250 per
year. The only other workable
solution, then, is for SMIP to
expand to be able to place an
intern in every major city in
the U.S.—which we are trying
hard to do.
In conclusion, I would like to
suggest that in the future The
Daily surprise the entire cam
pus and get the facts straight

before writing one of its lucid
editorials.

with the Stanford in-Washing
ton Program is obvious. Stan
ford-in-Washington offers sum
mer jobs in only two cities, Sac
ramento and Washington, D.C.,
at small and sometimes non
existent salaries. Stanford - in-
Washington's goal is govern
mental work experience, and
for that reason is an extremely
valuable program.
However, if The Daily wishes
to vent its editorial idiocies on
a program, it seems that it
chose the wrong one.
Now, if a student does not live
within commuting distance of
any of the twenty-one cities in
which we have or hope to have
an internship, if he is not in
terested in the marketing in
ternship, if he must be able to
net a summer salary of more
than $350 per month, and if he
cannot make up the financial
deficit in some other way, he
will not be able to accept an in
ternship under our program.
What is the Daily's solution?
—"convince the hiring compa
nies that it is worth their while
to pay an intern a little more
than usual to enable him to
work with them."
What The Daily fails to recog
nize is that the present salary
of between $400 and $600 per
month is excellent and thus
very difficult to increase. Sec
ondly, a minimum net summer
salary of $350 pe.- month is
more than sufficient to enable
most students to cope with their
educational expenses.
Another possibility is for our
program to become a scholar
ship service. I would be de
lighted to do this, but it would
be rather difficult on our pres
ent ASSU budget of $250 per
year. The only other workable
solution, then, is for SMIP to
expand to be able to place an
intern in every major city in
the U.S.—which we are trying
hard to do.
In conclusion, I would like to
suggest that in the future The
Daily surprise the entire cam
pus and get the facts straight

before writing one of its lucid
editorials.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Once again, The Stanford
Daily, in its editorial on the
Stanford Management Intern
Program, has sought to smear
an activity by skewing the facts
into its own mold. Now, I can
write a rebuttal, but the damage
has been done—which I am sure
is what The Daily intended in
the first place.
What I said, and what The
Daily conveniently forgot, is
that we offer summer intern
ships in New York, Chicago,
Los Angeles, Anaheim, San
Francisco, Palo Alto, Sunnyvale,
Detroit, Cincinnati, Dayton, In
dianapolis, Tulsa, Rochester,
and Marietta, Ga.
We are hoping to expand the
program this year into Seattle,
San Diego, St. Louis, St. Paul,
Toledo, Canton, and Philadel
phia.
In addition, we offer an in
ternship in marketing anywhere
in the United States. Quite ob
viously, if a student lives in any
of these areas, he can commute
to work. In this case, the stu
dent will net as profit for the
summer his entire salary of be
tween $400 and $600 per month.
If a student does not live in
and cannot commute to any of
the twenty-one cities mentioned
above, and if he is interested
in the marketing internship, he
will necessarily have to live
away from home. Assuming
that a student can live away
from home on $250 per month
or less, his financial profits for
the summer will still be rather
substantial.
In addition to this, the stu
dent will net the valuable man
agerial work experience which
is the goal of the program.
