## Hunger On Campus 
### ART BUCHWALD 
A parent never knows what kind of call he's
going to get these days from his offspring in
college. The other evening a friend of mine re
ceived a call from his daughter who attends a
small Midwest school.
"Hello, Daddy," she said. "Guess what? I'm on
a hunger strike."
My friend gulped. "That's wonderful, Martha.
How long have you been on it?"
"Two days. I'm starving."
"Isn't that nice?'" my friend gulped again.
"Tell me, what are you striking about?"
"Just a minute," his daughter said—and then
he heard her say to someone next to her, "What
are we striking about?"
A moment later she replied, "We're on a hun
ger strike because they're recruiting on campus."
"Who's recruiting on campus?"
"Hold it," she said. In the background he could
hear her say, "Who are we striking against?
Commercial recruiters or military recruiters?"
She came back on the line. "It's commercial,
Daddy. They want people to join the Dow Chem
ical Co."
"How long do you expect to be on your hunger
strike?" my friend asked.
"How long are we going to be on the hunger
strike?" he heard his daughter ask someone.
There was a pause and she came back on the
line. "Nobody knows. This is the first time any
one's done it."
"Can't you give me some idea?" my friend
said.

He could hear her talking with people in the
background. "Susie said that Gandhi went for
60 days without eating or drinking anything but
orange juice."
"But he was in training," my friend said. "He
de-escalated his food intake for months before
he struck."
He heard his daughter say to her friends, "He
says Gandhi trained for his hunger strike."
More background talking. Then his daughter
came on: "That's what we were calling you
about. How long do you think we should stay
on it?"
"I'm flattered that you'd ask me," my friend
said, "but frankly, I've never been involved in
a hunger strike myself. I thought you kids usu
ally took over the administration building."
"It doesn't have the impact of a hunger strike.
You should see the president of the school. He's
practically in tears. Our cheeks are all sallow,
and we groan a lot. The president knows how to
deal with student sit-ins, but he has no idea what
to do with kids who are starving themselves to
death."
"Well, I'm very proud of you," my friend said.
"You're certainly sticking up for your principles.
I'd say I'd give it another day and then you'll
have made your point."
His daughter repeated the decision and my
friend heard a cheer go up from the dorm.
"Thanks, Dad. We'll never forget what you've
done for us."

"You're certainly sticking up for your principles.
I'd say I'd give it another day and then you'll
have made your point."
His daughter repeated the decision and my
friend heard a cheer go up from the dorm.
"Thanks, Dad. We'll never forget what you've
done for us."
A parent never knows what kind of call he's
going to get these days from his offspring in
college. The other evening a friend of mine re
ceived a call from his daughter who attends a
small Midwest school.
"Hello, Daddy," she said. "Guess what? I'm on
a hunger strike."
My friend gulped. "That's wonderful, Martha.
How long have you been on it?"
"Two days. I'm starving."
"Isn't that nice?'" my friend gulped again.
"Tell me, what are you striking about?"
"Just a minute," his daughter said—and then
he heard her say to someone next to her, "What
are we striking about?"
A moment later she replied, "We're on a hun
ger strike because they're recruiting on campus."
"Who's recruiting on campus?"
"Hold it," she said. In the background he could
hear her say, "Who are we striking against?
Commercial recruiters or military recruiters?"
She came back on the line. "It's commercial,
Daddy. They want people to join the Dow Chem
ical Co."
"How long do you expect to be on your hunger
strike?" my friend asked.
"How long are we going to be on the hunger
strike?" he heard his daughter ask someone.
There was a pause and she came back on the
line. "Nobody knows. This is the first time any
one's done it."
"Can't you give me some idea?" my friend
said.

He could hear her talking with people in the
background. "Susie said that Gandhi went for
60 days without eating or drinking anything but
orange juice."
"But he was in training," my friend said. "He
de-escalated his food intake for months before
he struck."
He heard his daughter say to her friends, "He
says Gandhi trained for his hunger strike."
More background talking. Then his daughter
came on: "That's what we were calling you
about. How long do you think we should stay
on it?"
"I'm flattered that you'd ask me," my friend
said, "but frankly, I've never been involved in
a hunger strike myself. I thought you kids usu
ally took over the administration building."
"It doesn't have the impact of a hunger strike.
You should see the president of the school. He's
practically in tears. Our cheeks are all sallow,
and we groan a lot. The president knows how to
deal with student sit-ins, but he has no idea what
to do with kids who are starving themselves to
death."
"Well, I'm very proud of you," my friend said.
"You're certainly sticking up for your principles.
I'd say I'd give it another day and then you'll
have made your point."
His daughter repeated the decision and my
