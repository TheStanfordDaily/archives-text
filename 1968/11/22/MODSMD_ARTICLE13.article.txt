# Haight: Thy neighbor

### TIM HAIGHT 
"Now my friends are acting
strange.
They shake their heads. They
say I've changed.
Well something's lost, but
something's gained
In living every day.
"I've looked at life from both
sides now,
From win and lose, and still
somehow
It's life's illusions I recall.
I really don't know life at all.
—"Clouds (From Both Sides
Now)"
Some people are going from
resistance to revolution (having
gone from dissent to resistance
some time back). Others are go
ing from frustration to disillu
sionment. The erudite quote
"The Second Coming." Accord
ing to a highly placed source,
some people get stoned.

A bummer. The slang left over
from the noble experiment goes
stale on the tongue, along with
"struggle," "cadre" and "politi
cize." The candlelight proces
sion becomes a milktoast cop
out. The liberation festival be
comes a trap.
After all this time, all those
cracked heads, the political peo
ple still can't really answer the
big question: "If it is immoral
to coerce, how do we change
quickly and radically enough?"
People take sides. Joan Baez be
gins to sound a bit schoolmarm
ish. The local communists come
on logical but ugly. And the
nightly news is the same trip.
On another level, people go
their ways, using their fellows
in a symbiosis. The earth, too,
is being eaten. What do they
say, the worst thing for a para
site is a perfect host, because
the parasite eats it all up and

then dies for lark of food? And
man is the parasite and Earth
the host.
And people tell their stories
to other people who are trying
to get words in edgewise to tell
their stories. It becomes some
thing like driving fast on the
freeway, trying to cut in, all
going to the same place but not
toward each other. And when
they go toward each other, the
armor is so hard they collide
instead of meeting.
Deep down in my idealistic
soul, I have this vision of going
to somebody in power and talk
ing to him as one human being
to another. Not eyeball-to-eye
ball, not negotiating, but just
saying, "What are you doing it
all for?" But I've gone that
route. I'm willing to try again.
An exchange of prisoners—one
disillusioned retired graduate
student for, say, an administra
tor of the same rank who's sick
of it, too.
In moments of wisdom, Soc
rates comes through loud and
clear. And Socrates got his. To
day, they treat the gadflies dif
ferently—"Oh, what a luscious
tickle! Do it to me again! (But
don't get carried away and try
to take any power!)"
Start crusading against ra
cism, in the white ego-trip way
(the Omnipotent Administrator
descends to clear things up) and

you get more racist. Start try
ing to save white kids from the
technological society, an educa
tion designed to make them
machines, or whatever else
alienation, that's it — and you
get your mind so crowded with
quotations and statistics and
theories and concepts that you
can't see people any more.
Despair, give up, become
humble and tend the gardens
and the problems keep on grow
ing. That's worse. Then you're
part of the problem even more.
So you fake it, do what you can,
make decisions on the basis of
scanty evidence, hope, and make
so many mistakes. You really
don't know politics at all.
All the war researchers can
relax. I'm not going to bomb
their offices. My morals say kill
ing is bad. I don't know what
their morals say, since they
contribute to the killing over
seas. They have their elaborate
reasons, of course. But a life is
a life is a life. People die one
by one. You will, too.
It will only get better when
the straight people in power
change their ways. Soon it will
be too late. I don't know what
to do.
