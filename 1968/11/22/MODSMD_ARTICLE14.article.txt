## 'Exotic' Computer Uses 
### LARRY CRETAN 
Can a computer play check
ers, recognize a voice, or de
scribe a picture? Answering
such questions has been the
assignment of computer science
graduate students.
According to George For
sythe, head of the computer sci
ence department, computers are
pretty good at checkers and can
recognize a voice if the person
speaks slowly.
However, interesting projects
are not limited to graduate
courses. Students even do some
exotic things In elementary
courses.
One such course, "Computing
In the Social Sciences and Hu
manities" (CS 126), is designed
for the non-math oriented stu
dent. The demand for such
courses is growing rapidly as
computers are being applied to

an ever-increasing number of
fields.
Computers In Humanities
Even In the field of humani
ties, computers are becoming an
indispensable aid. The humani
ties student might use a com
puter to write music, prepare
concordances of books, or de
termine the authors of ancient
works by comparing writing
styles.
Concerning non technical stu
dents who take computer science
courses, Forsythe has comment
ed, "Since a university educates
the future leaders of the com
munity, the students need a
background for making deci
sions in a computerized world.
They need to learn what com
puters are, what they can do,
and what they cannot do."
The department is offering a
new course sequence this year,

"Introduction to Computer Sci
ence" (CS 50A, B). This course
is a combination of the concepts
and basic techniques of com
puter science for students with a
background of Mathematics 21
or 42.
New Building:
CS 50A, B is part of a general
expansion of the computer sci
ence department. Forsythe add
ed that in addition to the new
courses, plans for a new build
ing are under way. He ex
plained, "the department has no
space of its own on campus.
Right now we're poachers in the
computation center building."
The computer science depart
ment, despite its relative youth
(2Va years as an official depart
ment), is one of the most fre
quently consulted departments
on campus. According to For
sythe, "Computer science folk
are missionaries at heart.
"However, we furnish only the
ideas. We don't do the actual
work." Much of the service ill
this area is done by the compu
tation center, which is distinct
from the computer science de
partment.
The computer science depart
ment, along with the computa
tion center, will have about two
thousand students enrolled in
courses this year. Forsythe
added, "since we became a de
partment, over three thousand
students have had some expos
ure to computing."
