# '69 Senior Will Be Vanderbilt Trustee
## 
### 
Beginning in 1969, a senior
student now at Vanderbilt Uni
versity will be seated on the
Board of Trustees of that uni
versity.
In an unprecedented move,
the Board voted to request the
Alumni Association to nominate
from each year's graduating
class one person for election by
the Board as a trustee.
The nominee will be chosen
by the students from among
three persons proposed by a
committee of alumni appointed
largely from the two preceding
classes by the president of the
Alumni Association.
The nominee will take office
during the Board's fall meeting
when he is no longer a student
and will serve a term of four
years.
The action was initiated and
carried out within the Board
before the student body had any
desire for or knowledge of the
move. Student reaction to the
change was, for the most part,
positive.
The purpose of the move, ac

cording to Robert McGaw, sec
retary of Vanderbilt, was to add
the views of students to the
Board. "It was the nearest they
could come to having actual
students on the Board," he said.
Chancellor Alexander Heard
said the Board acted on the rec
ommendation of its Executive
Committee after study by a spe
cial trustee committee and after
endorsement of that commit
tee's conclusions by the Alumni
Association Board of Directors.
"I feel that recent students
can contribute substantially to
the Board's understanding of
undergraduate student affairs
and of ways in which the educa
tional programs of the univer
sity can be enhanced," Chancel
lor Heard said.
"The move will bring the
trustees close to the contempo
rary life of the campus."
Eventually the board will in
clude four "student trustees."
One will be selected from the
previous senior class each year
for the next four years, for
four-year terms.
