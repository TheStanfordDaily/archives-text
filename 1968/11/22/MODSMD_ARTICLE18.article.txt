# Grad Students Present Program
## 
### 
The Graduate Student Associ
ation (CGSA) has presented to
the University a program for
action which they feel would
improve the quality of graduate
education and graduate student
life at Stanford.
The group feels that "while
Stanford's professional schools
are setting an example of inno
vation and relevance for the
rest of the country to follow, in
the more traditional areas of
graduate education Stanford is
retreating from the edge of
greatness at a rapid rate."
They have called upon the
University to take steps to ac
complish the following goals;
• Make inexpensive and ade
quate housing available to all
graduate students. The Gradu
ate Student Asssociation sug
gests that an IBM card with ap
propriate questions be inserted
in the registration packets of
all students to survey housing
needs.
• Build a Graduate Student
Center. The possibility of a cof
fee house in the basement of
one of the Escondido Village
high-rise apartments is now be
ing considered. Also, a swim
ming pool could be constructed
in Escondido Village, open to all
graduate students and their
guests.
• Conduct a thorough inves
tigation of graduate education

at Stanford. The drop-out rate
for students who begin study
for a Ph.D. at Stanford is about
two - thirds. Although this is
lower than the national average
of four-fifths, steps should be
taken to see what is right and
wrong with graduate education.
An administration - financed
study on the scale of the Study
of Education at Stanford, con
ducted under the auspices of the
Graduate Student Association
and the Academic Senate, has
been suggested.
One area that needs particu
lar attention is the recruitment
of graduate students.
• Develop programs to com
municate to students, even be
fore they apply, what graduate
work is all about. Steps are al
ready being taken. The Gradu
ate Student Association has ar
ranged for an orientation pro
gram for new graduate students
beginning in 1969-70 to be ad
ministered through the I-Cen
ter.
In addition, the Bowman
Alumni House and the Dean of
the Graduate Division have put
forth a plan to make use of
alumni from Stanford graduate
schools to see prospective ap
plicants before they apply and
after they are accepted to Stan
ford.
It has also been suggested
that a great deal could be
learned about what is wrong
with graduate education by de
veloping a "de-processing pro
gram for students who leave
Stanford without completing a
degree.
Revisions in graduate educa
tion at Stanford could save the
University millions of dollars,
they say. It costs $120,000 to
$180,000 to produce a Ph.D.
here.
