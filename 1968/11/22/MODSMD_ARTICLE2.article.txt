## Czechs End Sit-In 
### 
PRAGUE (AP) — Thousands
of weary students lugged bed
rolls and guitars from university
halls Thursday. Some were bit
ter that their ending four-day
strike failed to bring guarantees
of freedom, some were elated
that the young Ind engendered
a new political force in their So
viet-occupied country.
Emerging at noon from lec
ture halls and laboratories they
had lived in since Sunday, the
optimists believed they had
alerted the public to resist ero
sion under Soviet pressure of re
forms launched by the Alexan
der Dubcek regime last spring.
Other students were disap
pointed that the Communist gov
ernment had refused to discuss
in detail with them their 10-
point manifesto or to permit its
publication in the censored
press. The 10 points upheld free
dom of speech, assembly, travel
abroad and research and de
manded a six-month limit on
press censorship re-established
after the Soviet-led invasion
Aug. 20.
Tension eased as the universi
ty strikes in west and central
Czechoslovakia also broke up.
The government and party
showed no sign of following up
their sharp Wednesday night
warning to the students, accus
ing them of trying to split the
working class and demanding
that they "stop before it is too
late."
The warning was widely re
garded as a sign of official panic
over scattered factory work
stoppages in sympathy with the
student sit-ins.
The latest student action came
just as party chief Dubek was
campaigning for stricter party
discipline and strengthening of
the Communist role in state and
society.
Estimates of the number of
students who moved into col
leges and universities through
out the regions of Bohemia and
Moravia ranged from 65,000 to
100,000. The strike had been
scheduled to end Wednesday but
was extended a day because of
anger over censored press cov
erage of the sit-ins.
• Devaluation Expected
BONN, Germany (AP) — De
valuation of the French franc
appeared a virtual certainty
early Friday, sources said, after
representatives of the 10 richest
nations recessed without agree
ing on what conditions to attach
to massive credit for France.
From comments of weary
delegates leaving the meeting
after 3 a.m. it appeared that the
French were no longer objecting
to a devaluation of the franc—
now traded at about five to the
U.S. dollar. Not long ago French
President Charles de Gaulle had
said devaluation would be "the
worst possible absurdity."
Apparently not settled was the
question of how great the deval
uation would be and what the
other countries would do in re
turn.
Karl Schiller, West German

economics minister, told news
men: "A final decision will come
when we meet again" at 11 a.m.
Friday.
• Whitehorn Indicted
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A
federal grand jury Wednesday
indicted Erik Whitehorn, 18, who
refused to register for the draft
on his mother's instructions.
Evelyn Whitehorn of Palo
Alto two weeks ago asked a fed
eral court injunction against
prosecution of her son for re
fusing to register.
She asked Thursday for court
recognition of her right to be
punished, instead of her son, for
"her own crime" of telling him
not to register.
U.S. Dist. Judge George B.
Harris denied her request.
He ordered that Erik White
horn, 18, appear in court Tues
day to answer the federal in
dictment charging refusal to
register for selective service.
Mrs. Whitehorn's suit con
tended that Erik as a minor son
was bound to obey her moral
teachings. She directed that he
should not register for the draft.
She said she and her son both
held the Vietnam War immoral.
• Regents Alter Stance
SAN DIEGO (AP) — A Uni
versity of California regents
committee recommended Thurs
day modification of the ruling
that limited Black Panther El
dridge Cleaver and other non
faculty lecturers to one class ap
pearance in courses given for
credit.
But the modification — which
comes before the full board of
regents today—clearly did not

satisfy many faculty members
and some regents. It would per
mit school officials to approve
exceptions to the one-lecture
restriction.
The objections to the new pro
posal drawn up by a regents'
subcommittee centered on issues
of academic freedom and the au
thority of faculty to plan
courses.
Prof. John Searle, Chairman
of the Academic Senate's Aca
demic Freedom Committee, said
of the new resolution: "The fac
ulty are going to feel this is a
further encroachment." He said
the faculty did not want to have
to rely on appeals to administra
tors who weren't necessarily ex
ports on the subject of a course.
• Mine Disaster
MANNINGTON, W. Va. (AP)
A small explosion rumbled
through a burning coal mine
Thursday night, moments after
mine officials expressed only
slight hope for the safety of 78
men trapped 800 feet below the
surface.
The blast, latest in a series
since early Wednesday, spewod
flames and smoke from the
Llewellyn entrance to Mountain
eer Coal Co. No. 9 mine.
James McCartney, a public
re'ations aide for the parent
Consolidation Coal Co., called the
blast "a setback" for attempts
to rescue the trapped miners.
Consolidation Vice President
William Poundstone had said
minutes earlier there still was
hope that the trapped miners
were alive, "but there is still no
reason to be optimistic."
He said continual efforts had
been made to contact the miss
ing men but all were unsuccess
ful.

day modification of the ruling
that limited Black Panther El

But the modification — which

The objections to the new pro

Prof. John Searle, Chairman

• Mine Disaster
MANNINGTON, W. Va. (AP)
A small explosion rumbled
through a burning coal mine
Thursday night, moments after
mine officials expressed only
slight hope for the safety of 78
men trapped 800 feet below the
surface.
The blast, latest in a series
since early Wednesday, spewod
flames and smoke from the
Llewellyn entrance to Mountain
eer Coal Co. No. 9 mine.
James McCartney, a public
re'ations aide for the parent
Consolidation Coal Co., called the
blast "a setback" for attempts
to rescue the trapped miners.
Consolidation Vice President
William Poundstone had said
minutes earlier there still was
hope that the trapped miners
were alive, "but there is still no
reason to be optimistic."
He said continual efforts had
been made to contact the miss
ing men but all were unsuccess
ful.
PRAGUE (AP) — Thousands
of weary students lugged bed
rolls and guitars from university
halls Thursday. Some were bit
ter that their ending four-day
strike failed to bring guarantees
of freedom, some were elated
that the young Ind engendered
a new political force in their So
viet-occupied country.
Emerging at noon from lec
ture halls and laboratories they
had lived in since Sunday, the
optimists believed they had
alerted the public to resist ero
sion under Soviet pressure of re
forms launched by the Alexan
der Dubcek regime last spring.
Other students were disap
pointed that the Communist gov
ernment had refused to discuss
in detail with them their 10-
point manifesto or to permit its
publication in the censored
press. The 10 points upheld free
dom of speech, assembly, travel
abroad and research and de
manded a six-month limit on
press censorship re-established
after the Soviet-led invasion
Aug. 20.
Tension eased as the universi
ty strikes in west and central
Czechoslovakia also broke up.
The government and party
showed no sign of following up
their sharp Wednesday night
warning to the students, accus
ing them of trying to split the
working class and demanding
that they "stop before it is too
late."
The warning was widely re
garded as a sign of official panic
over scattered factory work
stoppages in sympathy with the
student sit-ins.
The latest student action came
just as party chief Dubek was
campaigning for stricter party
discipline and strengthening of
the Communist role in state and
society.
Estimates of the number of
students who moved into col
leges and universities through
out the regions of Bohemia and
Moravia ranged from 65,000 to
100,000. The strike had been
scheduled to end Wednesday but
was extended a day because of

BONN, Germany (AP) — De

dom of speech, assembly, travel
abroad and research and de
manded a six-month limit on
press censorship re-established
after the Soviet-led invasion
Aug. 20.
Tension eased as the universi

Czechoslovakia also broke up.
The government and party
showed no sign of following up
their sharp Wednesday night
warning to the students, accus
ing them of trying to split the
working class and demanding
that they "stop before it is too

The warning was widely re
garded as a sign of official panic
over scattered factory work
stoppages in sympathy with the
student sit-ins.
The latest student action came
just as party chief Dubek was
campaigning for stricter party
discipline and strengthening of
the Communist role in state and

Estimates of the number of
students who moved into col
leges and universities through

Moravia ranged from 65,000 to
100,000. The strike had been
scheduled to end Wednesday but
was extended a day because of
anger over censored press cov

• Devaluation Expected
BONN, Germany (AP) — De
valuation of the French franc
appeared a virtual certainty
early Friday, sources said, after
representatives of the 10 richest
nations recessed without agree
ing on what conditions to attach
to massive credit for France.
From comments of weary
delegates leaving the meeting
after 3 a.m. it appeared that the
French were no longer objecting
to a devaluation of the franc—
now traded at about five to the
U.S. dollar. Not long ago French
President Charles de Gaulle had
said devaluation would be "the
worst possible absurdity."
Apparently not settled was the
question of how great the deval
uation would be and what the
other countries would do in re
turn.
Karl Schiller, West German

economics minister, told news
men: "A final decision will come
when we meet again" at 11 a.m.
Friday.
• Whitehorn Indicted
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A
federal grand jury Wednesday
indicted Erik Whitehorn, 18, who
refused to register for the draft
on his mother's instructions.
Evelyn Whitehorn of Palo
Alto two weeks ago asked a fed
eral court injunction against
prosecution of her son for re
fusing to register.
She asked Thursday for court
recognition of her right to be
punished, instead of her son, for
"her own crime" of telling him
not to register.
U.S. Dist. Judge George B.
Harris denied her request.
He ordered that Erik White
horn, 18, appear in court Tues
day to answer the federal in
dictment charging refusal to
register for selective service.
Mrs. Whitehorn's suit con
tended that Erik as a minor son
was bound to obey her moral
teachings. She directed that he
should not register for the draft.
She said she and her son both
held the Vietnam War immoral.
• Regents Alter Stance
SAN DIEGO (AP) — A Uni
versity of California regents
committee recommended Thurs
day modification of the ruling
that limited Black Panther El
dridge Cleaver and other non
faculty lecturers to one class ap
pearance in courses given for
credit.
But the modification — which
comes before the full board of
regents today—clearly did not

satisfy many faculty members
and some regents. It would per
mit school officials to approve
exceptions to the one-lecture
restriction.
The objections to the new pro
posal drawn up by a regents'
subcommittee centered on issues
of academic freedom and the au
thority of faculty to plan
courses.
Prof. John Searle, Chairman
of the Academic Senate's Aca
demic Freedom Committee, said
of the new resolution: "The fac
ulty are going to feel this is a
further encroachment." He said
the faculty did not want to have
to rely on appeals to administra
tors who weren't necessarily ex
ports on the subject of a course.
• Mine Disaster
MANNINGTON, W. Va. (AP)
A small explosion rumbled
through a burning coal mine
Thursday night, moments after
mine officials expressed only
slight hope for the safety of 78
men trapped 800 feet below the
surface.
The blast, latest in a series
since early Wednesday, spewod
flames and smoke from the
Llewellyn entrance to Mountain
eer Coal Co. No. 9 mine.
James McCartney, a public
re'ations aide for the parent
Consolidation Coal Co., called the
blast "a setback" for attempts
to rescue the trapped miners.
Consolidation Vice President
William Poundstone had said
minutes earlier there still was
hope that the trapped miners
were alive, "but there is still no
reason to be optimistic."
He said continual efforts had
been made to contact the miss
ing men but all were unsuccess
ful.
PRAGUE (AP) — Thousands
