## Kennan's 'Student Left' 
### MARK PAUL 
Democracy and the Student Left by George F. Ken
nan; Bantam paperback, $1.25.
To dismiss Mr. Kennan's book as just so much rub
bish would only serve to confirm his conviction that
the "Student Left" is inhumanly arrogant in both its
analysis and action.
Though such a dismissal is in order, it will remain
unstated here, if only to show Mr. Kennan that the
Left is still willing to listen, however incredulously,
to criticism and admonishment. Plowing through this
book was the ultimate test of that willingness.
The basis of this three-part book is a speech deliv
ered by Mr. Kennan at Swarthmore last fall and sub
sequently reprinted in the New York Times Sunday
Magazine under the title "Rebels Without a Program."
The article provoked such a flood of angry mail from
both students and faculty that Mr. Kennan felt it
necessary to defend and clarify his position. Both of
his articles are included in this volume along with a
selection of the letters that he received.
Catalogue of Faults
According to Kennan, the catalogue of faults of the
Student Left is long and diverse; activist students are
arrogant, disinclined to study, unfeeling toward their
parents, unmannered, overly emotional, idealistic to
the point of simplicity, anxious, angry, humorless, sus
picious of their own society, overexcited, unreflective,
impatient, romantic, and quixotic.
Being above all a realist, he does not allow a hint
of sympathy to overwhelm him; leftist students should
learn to cultivate sadness in the place of anger, to

forsake action and debate for calm study, or face ex
pulsion from universities.
Doesn't Know
The trouble with Mr. Kennan is that he doesn't know
anything about students. His material sounds like it
was culled from Reader's Digest, Ladies Home Jour
nal. Ronald Reagan's speeches, and long-range obser
vations from his ivory tower at Princeton.
On the basis of this solid background, he proceeds
to explain to students the causes for their discontent.
He understands that male students are worried over
the draft and that this anxiety, though overdone and
overstated, is at least comprehensible. He is quick to
noint out, however, that the chances of a student being
killed in Vietnam are slim, especially when compared
to traffic fatality rates for young men.
He also understands and shares the students' con
cern about the war. But he chides them for oversim
plifying the situation by calling Vietnam an immoral
war; lr> feels that history might well classify Vietnam
as a massive imprudence but scarcely as a deliberate
crime. Such a judgment, after all, is unthinkable be
cause it sounds exactly like what Communist propa
gandists have been screaming for fifty years. . . . Such
are the lessons from the ivory tower.
The net effect of this book, after the first wave of
nausea has passed, is to provoke a sense of despair
about the possibility for rational discussion between
the Left and its potential allies. Mr. Kennan is so set
in his ideological preconceptions that student ques
tions about "imperialism" and "power structures" are
automatically preposterous and rnrle

Doesn't Know
The trouble with Mr. Kennan is that he doesn't know
anything about students. His material sounds like it
was culled from Reader's Digest, Ladies Home Jour
nal. Ronald Reagan's speeches, and long-range obser
vations from his ivory tower at Princeton.
On the basis of this solid background, he proceeds
to explain to students the causes for their discontent.
He understands that male students are worried over
the draft and that this anxiety, though overdone and
overstated, is at least comprehensible. He is quick to
noint out, however, that the chances of a student being
killed in Vietnam are slim, especially when compared
to traffic fatality rates for young men.
He also understands and shares the students' con
cern about the war. But he chides them for oversim
plifying the situation by calling Vietnam an immoral
war; lr> feels that history might well classify Vietnam
as a massive imprudence but scarcely as a deliberate
crime. Such a judgment, after all, is unthinkable be
cause it sounds exactly like what Communist propa
gandists have been screaming for fifty years. . . . Such
are the lessons from the ivory tower.
The net effect of this book, after the first wave of
nausea has passed, is to provoke a sense of despair
about the possibility for rational discussion between
the Left and its potential allies. Mr. Kennan is so set
in his ideological preconceptions that student ques
tions about "imperialism" and "power structures" are
automatically preposterous and rnrle
Democracy and the Student Left by George F. Ken
nan; Bantam paperback, $1.25.
To dismiss Mr. Kennan's book as just so much rub
bish would only serve to confirm his conviction that
the "Student Left" is inhumanly arrogant in both its
analysis and action.
Though such a dismissal is in order, it will remain
unstated here, if only to show Mr. Kennan that the
Left is still willing to listen, however incredulously,
to criticism and admonishment. Plowing through this
book was the ultimate test of that willingness.
The basis of this three-part book is a speech deliv
ered by Mr. Kennan at Swarthmore last fall and sub
sequently reprinted in the New York Times Sunday
Magazine under the title "Rebels Without a Program."
The article provoked such a flood of angry mail from
both students and faculty that Mr. Kennan felt it
necessary to defend and clarify his position. Both of
his articles are included in this volume along with a
selection of the letters that he received.
Catalogue of Faults
According to Kennan, the catalogue of faults of the
Student Left is long and diverse; activist students are
arrogant, disinclined to study, unfeeling toward their
parents, unmannered, overly emotional, idealistic to
the point of simplicity, anxious, angry, humorless, sus
picious of their own society, overexcited, unreflective,
impatient, romantic, and quixotic.
Being above all a realist, he does not allow a hint
of sympathy to overwhelm him; leftist students should
learn to cultivate sadness in the place of anger, to

forsake action and debate for calm study, or face ex
pulsion from universities.
