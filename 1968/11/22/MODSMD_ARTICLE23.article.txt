# Portrait Of An All-American

### GARY CAVALLI 
He sweeps down the sidelines in long, grace
ful strides, gives a head-and-shoulder fake to
the inside, then accelerates once again. The de
fender is caught moving the wrong way, turn
ing just in time to glimpse a red-and-white
blur speeding past him. The pass floats gently
into the outstretched fingers, and Gene Wash
ington's long, muscular legs churn once again.
Six points for Stanford.
Gene Washington is quite possibly the finest
receiver in college football. He has the hands,
the moves, and the quickness which are the
hallmarks of a great receiver.
80,000 fans will jam into Berkeley's Memo
rial Stadium Saturday, and at least half of
them will be there to see Washington perform.
He will be playing his last football game for
Stanford.
For two years Washington has been the
most dangerous weapon in Stanford's offensive
arsenal. He has been the game-breaker, the
m;in counted on in the clutch, and inevitahly
the mjin double and iriple-teamed by the oppo
sition.
Through eight games this season, Washing
ton has 64 receptions (first in the conference
and third in the country), 1027 yards (first in
the nation) and 8 touchdowns (first in the con
ference and third in the nation).
"He's the best receiver I've had in 13 years
of coaching," commented Stanford coach John
Ralston recently. "I've had some good receiv
ers, but Gene's the best by far. He's been phe
nomenal. Some of the catches he's made have
been unbelievable."
"Washington's a great receiver," UCLA coach
Tommy Prothro agreed after the Bruin-Stan
lord game in which Gene caught 13 passes to
break a Los Angeles Coliseum record. "If you
single cover him you're in real trouble," Proth
ro readily admitted.
Yet before last season, Washington had
never even played flanker. All the way from

his first football game as a third-grader in the
Long Beach summer recreation program, up
until his junior year at Stanford, Gene was a
quarterback.
Washington starred as a signal-caller at
Long Beach Polytechnic High School, where
h" was student body President and also per
formed in barketball and track.
Before deciding on a college from the 50-odd
schools who sought his talents, Gene deter
mined a couple of pre-requisites. "First of all,
T wanted to go to a 'name' institution," the
personable Washington remembers. "Second, I
wanted to be away from home, because I
thought it would be good for me."
In the end, Gene narrowed it down to a
choice between Stanford and Princeton. Alter
visiting both campuses, he decided to come to
Stanford.
"I liked the area here, and liked the atmos
phere," Gene says of his decision to come to
Stanford. "As a Negro I felt more at ease
here. Another factor was that Art Harris was
here I talked extensively to him."
Quarterback Washington averaged 8.9 yards
per carry and passed for 256 yards, as he led
the Stanford frosh team to a 4-0 record in
1965.
The following year he took over the starting
quarterback spot on the Tribe varsity, and was
among the nation's top 10 in total offense after

four games, before a shoulder injury sidelined
him.
The Move
By the time the 1967 season opened, Wash
ington had been switched to flanker. It turned
out to be the most important move the Stan
ford coaching staff has ever made.
"It was a joint decision between myself and
the coaches," the handsome 6-1, 195 pounder
says of the move. "It was a welcome move as
far as I was concerned. I felt I had more po
tential at flanker. I felt I cou'd have been a
good college quarterback, but that's all, jir t
good I believed I could help the team more at
flanker."
Last year Washington led the Pacific-8 with
48 receptions, was selected All-Coast, and re
ceived honorable mention on the All-American
team, despite missing two games with an an
kle injury.
Northern California football fans wondered
what Gene could do if Stanford came up with
an excellent thrower who could take full ad
vantage of his ability. They found out this year
when Jim Plunkett took over the first-string
quarterback job for the Indians.
Washington credits Plunkett with much of
the team's, and his, success this year.
"Plunkett's helped quite a bit," Gene is
quick to point out. "If a team doesn't have a
quarterback, they're nothing. They can't win.

We're fortunate to have a good thrower in
Plunkett. He's thr> best passer I've seen since
Craig Jim's not as good as he's going
to get, but he's had a great year."
But the man Gene l;>els has helped him most
at Stanford, both on and off the football field,
is Coach Ralston.
"It would be hard to measure the amount of
help Coach Ralston has been to me," Gene af
firms, "not ju ;t in football but as an individual.
ll' l arid the other coaches have been concerned
v/ith mo, and I'm sure it's been that way with
the other players. There were times when
things got rough, and he was there to help.
I can't envision anyone doing a better job."
Like the other members of the Tribe var
sity, Gene was bitterly disappointed after the
Tribe's three-point losses to USC and UCLA.
"I expected at least a 9-1 season this year,"
Washington admits, "and it could have been.
Like anyone else, I wanted to play in the Rose
Bowl, but it didn't materialize. I will be play
ing in three post-season games, though, and
it's quite an honor." The talented flanker
learned early this week that lie has been se
lected to play in the East-West Shrine Game,
the Hula Bowl, and the Senior Bowl.
Pro Ambitions
Washington doesn't expect his football ca
reer to end with the three all-star games. He
plans to play professional football. But unlike

some athletes who have dreamed of a profes
sional career since early childhood. Gene says
his ambitions have progressed gradually,
"When I was a kid I wanted to be a high
school football player," the good-natured
Washington recalls. "In high school I wanted
to be a college player, and now there's only
one more step to take."
It looks as though Gene will have no trouble
taking that step. Officials of the San Francisco
49ers, Chicago Bears, Los Angeles Rams, and
Cincinnati Bengals have all publicly expressed
interest in him.
Veteran 49er quarterback John Brodie has
often said: "Washington will be a number one
draft choice of the pros. He's a natural as a
receiver. He has moves you can't teach. He
can't miss."
Gene doesn't particularly care where he
plays his football, but admits that he'd like to
stay in California.
"It would be ideal to play around here,"
Gene smiles. "California would be a great place
to play pro ball. I couldn't ask for anything
better than to be able to play with the 49ers
or the Raiders. But it really wouldn't matter,
f'd play with any pro team."
Gene Washington, Student
Washington's ambitions don't end on the
gridiron, however. Currently pursuing an hon
ors program in sociology, Gene hopes to attend
graduate school.
"I've always wanted to go to law school, or
business school," he says earnestly. "I won't
feel satisfied until I find out it I can go or not.
What I'd like to do is make an arrangement
to both play football and attend law school,
going in the off season."
Gene Washington stands up to leave. You
are finished asking him questions. He shakes
your hand and thanks you for the interview.
You watch him walk away and somehow you
know that Gene Washington is going to make
it. For him, success is a way of life.
