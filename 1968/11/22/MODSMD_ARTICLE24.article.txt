# Aroused Indians Seek Big Game Upset
## 
### GARY CAVALLI 
The successes and failures of
the past nine weeks will be for
gotten tomorrow.
Stanford and Cal square off
in the 71st renewal of the Big
Game at 1:30 in Berkeley's Me
morial Stadium.
Bear coach Ray Willsey has
told his players that "this is a
game you will live for the rest
of your lives."
Stanford mentor John Ralston
says,"The success of the entire
season depends on this game."
While no Big Game can ever
be classified as ordinary, tomor
row's clash takes on added sig
nificance because of several fac
tors.
High Stakes
The stakes for Stanford will
be 1) revenge (the Bears
snapped the Tribe's six-game se
ries winning streak last year
with a 26-3 upset), 2) the Axe,
3) third place in the Pacific-8 (a

win would give Stanford a 3-3-1
league record compared with
2-2-1 for Cal), and 4) the best
season since the 1951 Rose Bowl
bound Indians went 9-1.
The Bears, seven-point favor
ites, have just as much to shoot
for: 1) retention of the Axe, 2)
cutting the Tribe's series lead to
31-30 (it presently stands at 31-
29-10), 3) a possible second
place finish in the Pac-8 (a Bear
win combined with an Oregon
State loss to Oregon), and 4) the
best season finish since the 1951
Cal eleven wound up 8-2.
Tomorrow's game will mark
the first time since 1951 that
both teams have gone into the
Big Game assured of winning
seasons.
The Bears (6-2-1) have relied
mainly on a savage defense
which ranks sixth in the nation
in total defense, and third in the
nation in defense against scor
ing.

The Indians (5-3-1), by con
trast, are known primarily as an
offensive team, ranking tenth in
the nation in total offense and
eighth in passing offense.
Key Individual Battles
The battle between the Bear
defense and the Stanford offense
may hinge on a couple of indi
vidual matchups between All-
American candidates on both
teams.
Bear defensive guard Ed
White, a 6-3, 245 pounder who
has been ejected from one game
for fighting and warned in nu
merous others, is one of the
toughest pass rushers in the
country. If Cal is to get to Tribe
quarterback Jim Plunkett, White
is the one who will do it.
The job of containing White
will fall on the shoulders of stel
lar Stanford tackle Malcolm Sni
der, who at 6-4 has an inch on
White but will give up nearly
10 pounds. Snider, co-captain of
the Indian eleven, was selected
early this week to play in the
Hula Bowl and East-West Shrine
Game.
The Cal defensive secondary,
led by 6-0, 175 pound safety Ken
Wiedemann, will have to shut off
Stanford's phenomenal flanker
back Gene Washington. The job
of covering Washington will
probably go to one of Cal's fine
defenive halfbacks — Eric Kast

ner or Jim Sheridan—but Wie
demann will undoubtedly help
them out in double-covering the
Stanford great.
Washington has already shat
tered four school marks and one
conference pass receiving rec
ord, and has a shot at another
one Saturday. He needs only six
catches to break the Pac-8 sin
gle-season standard of 69 recep
tions, set by OSU's Vern Burke
in 1962.
Already this season Washing
ton has set Stanford records in
season catches (64) and yardase
1027i, plus career marks in
both (115 and 1695). His season
yardage total is also a new Pac
-8 standard.
While the Cal defense is prob
ably the strongest Stanford has
faced this season, it is also evi
dent that the Tribe offense is by
far the most potent that the
"Bear Minimum" has opposed.
Plunkett has personally ac
counted for 1928 yards, only 165
yards less than all of Cal's nine
prior opponents. Washington's
total of 1027 yards on pass re
ceptions is only 173 yards less
than Cal's nine previous oppo
nents have thrown for.
The Other Side
On the other side of the coin,
Stanford's defense against the
Cal offense, there are also a cou
ple of important matchups.
Cal center Bill Laveroni, a 6-1,
235 pounder, will attempt to
hold off the Tribe's 6-3, 261
pound middle guard George
Buehler, another Hula Bowl,
Shrine Game selection. Laveroni,
as well as the rest of the Cal
line, is in for a rough afternoon.
The Indian defense—with Bueh
ler, co-captain Stu Kellner, and

John Ha y go o d leading the
charge—intend to put a lot of
pressure on Cal quarterbae!:
Randy Humphries.
Perhaps the toughest assign
ment for Stanford's defense will
be in covering Cal split end
Wayne Stewart. Stewart, a high
school quarterback, caught two
touchdown passes in last year's
2(3-3 debacle. He is not an excep
tionally quick or deceptive re
ceiver, but has good hands and
uses his size (6-7, 200) to good
advantage.
The task of covering Stewart
will be handled by Tribe corner
backs Rich Keller (5-11, 180) and
Dick Oliver (6-3, 190). They'll
have their hands full.
Bears Tough At Home
The home field is usually not
much of an advantage in a game
this important, but the Bears
have been nothing short of awe
some in Memorial Stadium this
year. In five games there, Will
sey's crew has scored 174 points
while giving up only 23. Need
less to say, they won all five
games, three by shutouts.
Both teams are in good physi
cal shape for the encounter. The
only sidelined regulars are Stan
ford split end Jack Lasater
(shoulder separation) and Cal
guard Jerome Champion
(pinched nerve).
Ralston has expressed some
concern over fullback Greg
Broughton, who sustained a
charley horse last week in Stock
ton. Yesterday the Tribe chief
tain listed Broughton as a "prob
able starter." Should he be un
able to go at full strength, Ral
ston will use either Jack Alus
tiza, Tim Abena, or Jon Huss in
Broughton's place.

BEAR HATCHET MAN —It's been said that Cal's standout defen
sive guard Ed White spends more time in the opposing team's
baekfield than the backs do themselves. White, who has blocked
two field goals this season and specializes in pressuring the oppo
sition's quarterback, will hook up with Stanford's Malcolm Snider
in the most important individual battle of tomorrow's Big Game.
