Despite rumors in the mass
media to the contrary, the
REALLY, REALLY BIG game
will be played tomorrow morn
ing on top of a parking garage.
In Berkeley.
Yessir, sports fans, it's the
crucial 69th renewal of the An
nual Ink Bowl Classic, a gar
gantuan gridiron extravaganza
pitting the potent pencil-pushers
of The Stanford Daily against
the scrawny scribes of The Daily
Californian.
Versatile Gary Cavalli, the
Daily mentor, is optimistic.
Wincing in pain from a hip
pointer, he declared, "I'm opti
mistic. We've got a slight per
sonnel problem, because 12 of
our 16 men refuse to play any
position except end, and the oth
er four will only play quarter

back. Thus our defensive
strength is questionable." But
Cavalli was still confident that
the Daily gridders could tote the
pigskin across that TD stripe.
Scouting reports from Cal in
dicate that the Bears' front four
will average an awesome 6-4
and 107, due mainly to the fact
that nobody on the Daily Cal
staff has eaten for the last three
months.
The protest apparently con
cerns the University's persistent
censorship of the word "casaba"
in sports stories.
