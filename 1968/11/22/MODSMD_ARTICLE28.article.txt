# Undefeated Harriers Face Nation
## 
### ALLEN MEREDITH 
For the first time in its his
tory, the Stanford varsity cross
country team will proudly rep
resent tho university as a full
force in the NCAA Champion
ship Cross-Country Meet in New
York.
The varsity and the frosh
teams are undefeated in all com
petition for the regular 1968
season; and the best may be just
looming around the bend.
Stanford has compiled an un
believable record with impres
sive victories over teams such
as USC, San Diego, UCLA, and
Berkeley, not to mention victor
ies in the Sacramento All-
Comers Meet and against San
Jose State, who ran two Ail-
Americans.
This coming Monday the team
wi'l face the nation's best—in
cluding USC, San Diego, UCLA
(sound familiar?), Villanova,
Harvard, Air Force, and Michi
gan State, only to mention a few
of the better teams besides Stan

ford with a shot at tho title.
The actual race will take place
at Van Courtlamlt Park, Bronx,
New York, where some 500 run
ners will step up to the starting
line (Can you picture 500 run
ners on any starting line?).
As Coach Clark stresses, "with
that amount of men all in a
single bunch, it's imperative to
not get lost at the beginning."
Now, there is a good point.
The Strategy
"The strategy," says Coach
Clark, "is to start fast; just fast
enough to be together in our
pack-running form which has
helped drive the team to great
success this season. Then we'll
collect our senses, keep under
control, and try not to lose our
selves. These steps are crucial;
otherwise we may find ourselves
either behind or possib'y too far
in front to come through with
strong kicks."
"Our main concern," continues
the coach, "is ju£t keeping
grouped together with a fast

early pace." Without pointing
out the obvious, should a mem
ber of the five man team falter
< as one of the San Jose Spartans
did last year), the team's score
woi Id eliminate any chance they
would otherwise have for a posi
tion in the rankings.
The Squad
Coach Clark comments on the
seven harriers who are on their
way to the nationals today:
• Brook Thomas—a senior, is
the captain of the team. "His
specialty appears to be his great
leg speed during the last section
of the race. He has been clocked
at 1:21 and 1:54 for the 660 and
the half mile respectively, and
is definitely the leader of the
great team."
• Chuck Menz—a junior, was
injured most of last season, and
consequently, is rather new to
the Stanford public. "Chuck is
one of the most dependable run
ners in the second and third slot
and has developed good kicking
speed, which is always pre

cceded by a controlled first mile
with no lull in between."
• Don Kardong—a sophomore,
"has his own reputation as the
'mystery Kardong.'" In the
UCLA meet, the scorers lost him
somewhere in the race and left
him out of the final tally, giving
UCLA the victory. After much
verification, he was credited with
having run and Stanford was
allowed to leave victorious. "Don
is also consistent and very de
pendable- has a strong kick
with good speed, but at times
gets lost from the pack." Don
is also a great half miler in
track.
• Al'en Sanford— a senior, "can
best be described as a 'dynamic'
runner, getting himself keyed up
for races. His strongest asset is
a great kick as he will make his
final move before the opponents
are ready, which discourages
his opposition."
• Greg Brock—a junior, "has
had a lot to live up to from
being MVP last fall. He is begin

ning to come around with great
times and will more than likely
be among the best this Monday."
• Bob Anchondo a senior, "has
had a tough time because the
other five have been so outstand
ing. If one of our top five run
ners were to falter, he would
certainly be there to carry the
weight."
• Duncan Mac Donald—a
more, "has tremendous spec#
and is deadly. If he is near yotf
towards the finish, you'd bettor
be careful because he's going to
beat you." He's also a great
trackman.
The Course
A typical long distance courset'
at Manhattan College in New!.
York, the terrain is both hilly
and fiat, with trails and bottle
necks where, in places, only
three runners can run side by
side. The course is in the form
of a loop which is three miloqi
long, consequently, the runners
will run it twice in the single
race.
With the weather in California
at a comfortable 60 degrees, few
people will remember New York
can be 30 degrees or less about
now. With the possibility of both
snow and rain, the team will be
unaccustomed to the air. Try
picturing California runners
trotting through snow and sleet
with long underwear and sweat
suits!
The team will be leaving San
Francisco airport at noon, spend
ing the rest of the day getting
used to breathing a solidified
air. "Saturday the team will re
view the course and possibly run
sections to perfect their strat
egy," comments the coach. "Sun
day, the team will stretch out,
with a little jogging, but littlq
more. Monday, it's go, and
then. .
Coach Clark summarizes, "It's
going to take nothing short of
a plane crash at Kennedy Air
port to keep us from finishing
high. My main concern from
here on in is keeping the guys
relaxed and letting me do the
worrying for them."
In case anyone's interested,
the entire meet will be shown
on ABC's Wide World of Sports
in a week or so. If it's possible
to recognize any of the 500 fig
ures on your screen, remember,
Stanford's wearing the red and
white.
