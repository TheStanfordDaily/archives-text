# Grape Growers Criticize Union
## 
### 
Two growers from Delano
spoke at Stanford Wednesday
night. They talked for three
hours with a group of over fifty
students at a meeting held un
der the at spices of the Young
Republicans and the Inter-Fra
ternity Council.
The two growers, Louis Lucas
and John Bree, felt that growers
have of late been caught in a
cost-price squeeze. Their costs
are high; the prices they get
are low. The boycott when com
bined with this squeeze and the
fact that grapes are not a food
staple has hit the growers hard.
Grape workers in the Delano
area earn about $2.30 an hour,
well above the $1.69 average for
California farm workers, which
is the highest for any state. Ac
cording to the growers, annual
earnings for full-time grape
workers are from $4,000 to
$10,000, depending on the spe
cific job they hold.
They claimed more than 9 out
of 10 Delano workers rent or
own homes in the community.
He said that "it's quite possible?
to work 11 or 12 months a year"
because of the diversified agri
culture there.
The growers beMeve that
Caesar Chavez of the United
Farm Workers picked the De
lano area as the focus of orga
nizing activity becaus? there was
a well-paid non-migrant popula
tion, one which could sustain a
strike.
The perishable nature of the

fruit they grow was constantly
emphasized by the growers. Bree
also pointed out that
Industries, despite a no-strike
clause in contracts, has had 58
strikes and slowdowns. The
growers are afraid that after
unionization they will be faced
with both a strike and no altern
ative but union 'abor at the time
when the grapes must be picked.
Faced with stiff competition
from Mexico, the movement of
large corporations like Superior
Oil into farming, and problems
with unions and labor, many
growers are liquidating their
farm properties or turning to
mechanization.
