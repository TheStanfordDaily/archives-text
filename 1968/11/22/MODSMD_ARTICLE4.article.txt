# Six Elected To C-15 In LASSU Meeting
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
The order of business at last
night's meeting of the Legisla
ture of the Associated Students
of Stanford University (LASSU)
abruptly halted with numerous
challenges alleging that non
members were voting.
An overflow crowd was pres
ent at the meeting which elected
six new members to the Com
mittee of 15. The meeting then
bogged down over an "emer
gency" appropriation of $4000
for the Speech Association. This
measure led to the voting cre
dential challenges.
Six Elected
A slate of 10 names out of a
field of 40 was presented by the
nominating committee to fill six
vacancies on the Committee of
15. Three additional nominations
were made from the floor after
which each candidate made a
two minute speech. The winners
in the voting after the speeches

were: Cissie Bonini, Bob Cory,
Mary Montle, Jim Schneider,
Eckhard Schultz and Mike Wein
stein.
The "emergency" appropria
tions bill was considered next.
The Speech Association, spon
sors of the debate team, have
spent the $3000 budgeted to
them for the year and were
asking for $4000 more with
which to continue their opera
tions.
Out of Money
Addressing the legislature, a
Speech Association spokesman
stated that they were trying to
make the association financially
independent of LASSU and the
$4000 was needed to establish an
endowment to accomplish this
independence. He also stated
that their programs would be
effectively terminated if the
money was not granted.
It was at this point that a
parliamentary logjam developed

after over 20 per cent of the leg
islators, suspecting that some
non-members were voting, asked
that any further voting be done
by roll call. In the confusion,
however ,at least one more vote
was taken by show of hands.
LASSU Speaker Yale Braun
stein finally announced that nu
merous challenges had been
made and that each person pres
ent would have to be individual
ly questioned to find out whom
he represented or thought he
represented. At least 10 persons
who had been voting were dis
covered not to be members.
The $4000 was finally approved
by a vote of 50 to 25, hut the
question of whether or not a
two-thirds majority was needed
was still undecided when LASSU
adjourned. The $4000 came out
of the contingency fund leaving
a balance of $497.50 for the re
mainder of the year.

The Speech Association, spon
sors of the debate team, have
spent the $3000 budgeted to
them for the year and were
asking for $4000 more with
which to continue their opera
tions.
Out of Money
Addressing the legislature, a
Speech Association spokesman
stated that they were trying to
make the association financially
independent of LASSU and the
$4000 was needed to establish an
endowment to accomplish this
independence. He also stated
that their programs would be
effectively terminated if the
money was not granted.
It was at this point that a
parliamentary logjam developed

after over 20 per cent of the leg
islators, suspecting that some
non-members were voting, asked
that any further voting be done
by roll call. In the confusion,
however ,at least one more vote
was taken by show of hands.
LASSU Speaker Yale Braun
stein finally announced that nu
merous challenges had been
made and that each person pres
ent would have to be individual
ly questioned to find out whom
he represented or thought he
represented. At least 10 persons
who had been voting were dis
covered not to be members.
The $4000 was finally approved
by a vote of 50 to 25, hut the
question of whether or not a
two-thirds majority was needed
was still undecided when LASSU
adjourned. The $4000 came out
of the contingency fund leaving
a balance of $497.50 for the re
mainder of the year.
The order of business at last
night's meeting of the Legisla
ture of the Associated Students
of Stanford University (LASSU)
abruptly halted with numerous
challenges alleging that non
members were voting.
An overflow crowd was pres
ent at the meeting which elected
six new members to the Com
mittee of 15. The meeting then
bogged down over an "emer
gency" appropriation of $4000
for the Speech Association. This
measure led to the voting cre
dential challenges.
Six Elected
A slate of 10 names out of a
field of 40 was presented by the
nominating committee to fill six
vacancies on the Committee of
15. Three additional nominations
were made from the floor after
which each candidate made a
two minute speech. The winners
in the voting after the speeches

were: Cissie Bonini, Bob Cory,
Mary Montle, Jim Schneider,
Eckhard Schultz and Mike Wein
stein.
The "emergency" appropria
tions bill was considered next.
