# Salary Demands
## TA Strike Looms 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
University teaching assistants
(TA's) set machinery in motion
for a possible strike next week,
assuming no settlement of their
salary demands.
Members of the graduate stu
dent union loral, American Fed
eration of Teachers (AFT> Local
1816, will take a strike vote next
Tuesday evening if administra
tion sa'ary proposals are not ac
cepted by that time.
Administrators have thus far
given no indication of when a
meeting will be held to present
counterproposals to recent TA
demands for immediate salary
increases of $700 per year.
TA's have threatened a strike,
effective Nov. 30 at midnight,

that may gain sanction from
local union groups. Support of
AFT grievances by other labor
unions would bring all Univers
ity services to a standstill, TA
leaders claim.
The TA union passed the reso
lution at its Wednesday meeting
that stated that the union will
vote next Tuesday on a possible
strike unless a satisfactory com
promise has been worked out
by the TA's directly involved.
The resolution includes the re
quirement that any settlement
must include a raise in the"de
facto University minimum
wage" for all teaching assis
tants.
Postponement of the TA-ad
ministration negotiation session,
originally scheduled for today,

has given rise to speculation
that University officials may at
tempt to settle political science,
anthropology, and English TA
pay demands without another
meeting.
Administrators are hopelul
that some reevaluation of TA
salaries for the remainder of the
year can be presented to teach
ing assistants from the three de
partments by Monday, according
to Assistant Provost Raymond
Bacchetti, who has been active
in the discussions.
Bacchetti hinted that a further
meeting may be unnecessary if
they are able to present propos
als for salary readjustments for
this year "within the proper
context," which might be merely
a letter.
Whether the administration
responds or not, political science
TA's, who originally made the
demands, plan a Tuesday noon
meeting to appraise the issues,
according to TA leader Richard
Young. They will respond at that
time to any University pro
posals.
Several student leaders specu
lated that the administrators re
luctance to hold further meet
ings arises from a concern that
future salary discussions with
AFT student loaders might con
stitute recognition of the union,
which administrators have fas
tidiously avoided. Administrat
ors also wish to avoid confron
tation over attendance by coun
ty labor representatives a t
negotiation meetings.
Bacchetti noted that adminis
trators had "consistently re
sisted" turning the TA-adminis
tration discussions into formal
negotiations. He said that "no
one wants Nov. 30 to come and
go" without an agreement being
reached.
