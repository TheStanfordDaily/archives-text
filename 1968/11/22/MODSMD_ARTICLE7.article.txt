# Ex-Pilot Receives Third Heart
## 
### 
An airline pilot who had to retire because of heart trouble, and
got a new one by transplant surgery, was in fair condition last
night with a third.
Darrell Hammarley's second heart began beating erratically six
hours after it was implanted at Stanford Hospital Wednesday.
A suitable donor was available so the hospital's surgical team,
headed by Dr. Norman E. Shumway, gave the 50-year-old flier from
San Jose a third heart Wednesday night.
The second operation was called for after what Dr. Shumway
called "erratic rhythm" in the second heart that gave it an overall
performance below normal. Use of a pacemaker, to regulate the
beat, didn't help.
Names and descriptions of the heart donors were withheld.
Shumway declined requests for interviews and news conferences
saying "there is no longer anything unusual about a heart trans
plant." He headed a 12-member surgical team.
Doctors said the removed heart the first transplant would be
autopsied to determine what went wrong. They said it was extreme
ly fortunate that a second donor was available and said it pointed
up the need for organ banks to meet emergencies.
