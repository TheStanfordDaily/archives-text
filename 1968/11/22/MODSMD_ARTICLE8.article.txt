# AN AFRICAN TRAGEDY
## 
### 
A terrified boy is dragged out of the bush
es. He pleads for his life. An ebony faced
officer orders him tied hand and foot. Four
coughs from an automatic weapon. A life
ends. Later the killer is also killed. Television
engraves the brief sequence on the minds of
a hundred million Americans.
Unfortunately electronic media do not
have equal impact when it comes to ex
plaining the fifty years of cultural contact
and disruption which culminated in Nigeria's
trairc civil war.
Both the Nigerians and the Biafrans can
point to a long list of atrocities and political
mimes on the part of their enemies. But nei
ther side has outlined the many ways that
western technological societies have contrib
uted to their disaster.
For decades we have been exporting to
Africa bits and pieces of our religions, eco
nomic and industrial systems, ideologies and
social assumptions. Pleased as we are with
cornucopia culture, we have failed to see
that our contributions to tribe-oriented so
cieties have resulted in an explosive situa
tion. Political federations, for example, may
have worked well in Europe and North
America but that is not guarantee that they
will be successful in sub-Sahara Africa.
Perhaps it was inevitable that the enor
mous cultural energies of the industrialized
West would permeate and destroy African
structures. In any case there is no undoing
what has happened, even if we knew what

is "right" for other people.
But today we are helping to make a bad
situation worse. For short-term political gain
and simply for money, we are providing Afri
cans with the aircraft, bombs, guns, ammuni
tion and instruction that they need to slaugh
ter each other.
Our contributions to the African tragedy
are not limited to Nigeria. Anyone acquain
ted even slightly with the recent history of
Congo or Rwanda, for example, knows that
we have been verv busv in many places.
Nor is the United States the only culprit.
England, France, the Soviet Union, China
and Egypt have all involved themselves in
Nigeria and elsewhere.
We should stop sending arms to Africans
and Africans should stop asking for them.
It is riot likely that either of these things
will happen. But the real point is that foreign
nations should not make decisions for Africa,
implicitly or explicitly. The only outside
force which might conceivably have the
moral prerogative to involve itself there,
even to the extent of keeping the peace, is
the United Nations. And this assumes con
siderably less Western direction of the inter
national agency.
In the meantime we can only hope that
the next generation of African leaders, hav
ing seen both the terrible errors of their
predecessors and the disastrous effects of
foreign meddling, will be able to settle fu
ture conflicts without violence.
