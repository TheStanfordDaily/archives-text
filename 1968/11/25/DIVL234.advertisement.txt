Whenever you're off and flying in Western America,
Western Airlines offers you a way to save money.
Lots of it.
If you haven't reached your 22nd birthday and
hold an Airline Youth Identification Card (available
from Western or any other airline), you're set for
flying on a standby basis. It's a rare flight where
you'll be left standing by, but you save 50%.
That's one-half off the regular Coach fare.
In other words, you can fly round trip for the
price of one way.
anchorage So whenever you're headed home or off to a
SALMON big game, go with Western. All over the map.
